Give me rent.
Nice to look back at this
Amazing
so happy birthday, one more day and civil war comic
There's no fuckin way that guy is Matt Murdock. That dude in the white shirt has a clear gut and love handles..
vulture will be in no way home !
Can't wait to see if the other spidermans will be in this movie
I could be wrong, but was Peter wearing the venom suit at 7:12?
Cant wait for this :)
If miles also gets introduced in spiderman then I have a feeling that they will team up to go against venom at some point. Also they are making a spiderman game in 2023 where Peter and miles team up to fight venom.
Tom Holland says that Happy Hogan is one of his favorite characters and that he loves how Jon Favreau plays him, calling him "one of the godfathers of this entire universe."  This film takes place 8 months after the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019).  Tom Holland wanted Jason Momoa as Kraven the Hunter in the movie.  Director Jon Watts wanted the goggles on the black Spider-Man costume to be the exact opposite of something that Iron Man would wear. They were also inspired by a popular style of flip-up glasses from the 1980s.  This is the first live-action appearance of Mysterio.  The first Spider-Man film where the Sony Columbia Pictures logo has its traditional music instead of a musical score over it.  In the movie, Mysterio says, "Somebody get this stupid costume off of me!" On the contrary, in real life, Jake Gyllenhaal loved wearing his costume and wanted to wear in every scene that he possibly could.  One of the only Spider-Man movies where the theme of the animated series from 1967 Spider-Man (1967) (full or partial) is not heard.  (at around 6 mins) A wrestling poster featuring Crusher Hogan can be seen backstage at the charity fundraiser. Crusher Hogan was the wrestler that a masked Peter Parker got in the ring with in Spider-Man's first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15.
That’s not lizard that’s venom :)
Hyped up for this movie, the venom after credits  scene makes me think he’s gonna be in this movie
I knew they would be setting it up for the sinister six, but who is the sixth villain? Kraven the hunter? Vulture? Scorpion? Rhino? Hobgoblin?
If they play into the Tobey maguire memes, even slightly, then this will be the greatest marvel film yet
That cop or whoever slams the files down isn't Matt. Look closer the guy has love handles...lol..it's not Murdock.
I love the vid I did not whatch full thing
Holly moly I’ll skipp
*DOC OCK* Hello, peter  (Tobey) *PETER* : You’ll get your tritium, when you fix this damn floor!
Lol, dude, for a moment, just a moment, u sounded like GradeAunderA :)
how do they explain James Jonah Jameson
What I thought iny childhood after watching spider man: Omg if he unmask everyone will be surprised and etc.. What happened: wtf 😑
I kinda think Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield will come back for multiple spider verse movies because of the fact that for two years there was rumors about doing a Spider-Man for and the amazing Spider-Man three and if Sonia marbles gonna keep their deal if Tom Holland Spider-Man is going to be a part of the MCU why not feature him to be connected to morbius and venom and Then Toby’s Spider-Man and Andrew Spider-Man having their own separate universe since there’s the multi-verse and it was also just make every Spider-Man fan base happy because I can see all three Spider-Man’s all different times so that will make multiple money off of all three just like the MCU doing off of all these new heroes
It's this the way they pull Spidey from the MCU, everyone forgets him?
Did anyone notice, Spiderman No way home released on Wanda Vision's Anniversary date, 23rd August. OMG, Marvel has already foreshadowed it in WandaVision's Episode 1 itself !?!?!?!?
i detest the new mj, to me she is race swap girl.
W videos bro🔥
Fantastic video
Fantastic video❣️
Waw bagus kawan film nya mantap
I think the Sinister 12 going against the Three Spidermen will be fantastic...
give us miles!!!
I reckon now the multiverse has  been open they will introduce madam web just Remember where YouTube comment section you saw it first
If that was charlie cox throwing those files down, he put on some weight
where can i watch this movie?
I hope Andrew is in it, I know that Tobey is in it somehow, Charlie says that those aren't his fore arms
Super hype for this bro!
It's not Daredevil, you can clearly see the dude walk into the interview room moments before. If it is him, Murdock really needs to lay off the junk food
Hope the other two make fun of Toby's organic web
Me, when are Tobey and Andrew going to be confirmed to e in the movie Marvel and Sony, when you fix this damn door
If Matt Murdock is not in this movie, I'll be a little sad, but this movie will be AMAZING either way!
The video is great!! And im hyped for the movie spider man is my favorite super hero and i would love to see goblin and doc oc in the movie hope we get venom in some other movie
Amazing Spider-Man luar biasa saya tambahkan subscribe mudah-mudahan sukses selalu
Cox has indicated that that is not his forearms.
I can’t wait until the movie.
The Box Peter's Holding is Pandora's box also know as Pardora's urn owner "Dorain Murdstone(Sorcerer) the box holds all the evil in the world and its a  Prison so the Sunctum Sanctorum has eaten by the Box the F4 is on its way next
Dr Strange doesn’t have scars on his hands!!!
I’m not gonna lie when I first saw that glimpse of flash with blonde hair I thought “tf is Draco Malloy doing here”
OK Tom Holland spider man should be more then match for most of his villans in the Iron spider suit
I’m not gonna watch it Untill I know tobey will be in the movie
It's a movie
I’ve not seen anyone talk about this but what if Doctor Strange is a skroll with magical powers
Devil in in disguise is actually a nod Matt Murdock showing up not as Daredevil, but his alter ego instead.
how do u see a random black woman and automatically think its miles morales' mother? 😂thats just poor judgement and is kinda ignorant 🙌🏾
Awesome video
It just hit me Doc Ock's arms look different than before. My theory is that when we see Doc Ock is not when he comes into this world. I think he has been contacted by Goblin who brought him up to date and upgraded his arms because they look a little different but the big thing is in spider-man 2 his arms are 15'-20' long but what we can see here they look much longer possibly 30'+. So yes I think goblin will be upgrading Doc Ock and possibly others.
I Don’t think any other spider man may show up . I believe Tom Holland’s Spider-Man might perform in the perspectives of both Andrew and Tobeys Spider-Man
Probably a bit late, but something I noticed. At the end, where strange says "Be careful what you wish for", that's not strange. It sounds similar, but different. Second strange conspiracy.
This shit gonna be crazy
I knew who the dude at the end of the trailer was dr octopus
I’m one of the first guy to be here!!!!!
Shut the hell. Up guy who said it isn’t murdock
All I want to know is if Tobey's landlord's daughter will be in the film?
spiderman poggers
goblin, electro, doc oc, sand man, vulture, and either lizard or scorpion since both these characters have been introduced. although scorpion has yet to change into scorpion so he may be for a later movie.  if they do a multiverse thing here and both garfield and maguirs spideys are in this movie then i would near put money on it that we are either going to get a live action miles morales (eventually)  or the 3 spideys are gonna get pulled across to his multiverse and team up with him for a sinister 6 squad over there.
Tony stark : I am iron man   Civillians: ok   Peter park : is Spider-Man   Civilian: die devil
You know he could have easily just tell them after everyone forgets.
Here’s my thought:  If there is  Doc Ock Goblin Sandman Lizard Electro  That makes 5, which is one off from a sinister 6, possibly another villain could make their way into the film? Maybe Michael Keaton will be back as Vulture? Maybe Scorpion from the post credit scene?
Great job!
That looks promising. I wish one day they would make a spiderman movie while he start mutation and get 6 arms, plus Mordicus and Kraken.
The woman in the car is most likely Flash Thompson’s mom as she seems to be a wealthy woman. If she dies on Peters watch flash will probably have a post credit scene where he finds out leading into the next Spider-Man movie where Flash is one of the villains
Imagine Tobey, Andrew, and Tom pointing at each other. That will break the internet and be 100% legendary.
Tobey!! OG
Tobey Maguire Spider-Man is not related to any of these films because Spider-Man homecoming and the amazing Spider-Man are REBOOTS so have no relation to the original
Maybe that's who interupts may and peter on couch. Its Toney Maguire delivering a pizza. Pizza time!
Maybe he says he's trying to live two lives cause one he's Spider-Man saving the city and other he's trying to be a normal high school er lol. Which gives me lots of stress and grief especially in Spider-Man two lol. He had so many problems in that between school and Harry and mj and aunt lol and doc ock lol.
*Theory* :  When Dr. Strange casted the spell, multiverses collided for a moment and everyone from original Spider Man appears.
Cool
I forgot the spoilers you said
I hope Toby n Andrew are in it
yessss
Great breakdown and so glad I found your video!
So bad
I'M SO GONNA SEE THIS MOVIE, BUT NOT WHILE WEARING A FUCKING GODDAMN MASK/FACE-COVERING!
Hello Peter👇🏾
Devil in disguise...Strange is actually Mephisto in disguise. Just my theory.
This is minor but why the reference to sony? Yes, i understand that they are co-owners with disney but you can easily tell by the production that that this clearly an mcu made film. Watch a venom movie or trailer and you can definitely tell the difference. Anyway, no references about Sandman or the misdirection between Doc Ock and mcu peter interacting?
This guy is a fucking nerd 😂
I thought I saw scorpion behind Peter instead of venom
They should do the meme with the three spiderman pointing at eachother!
Yes, Dr Strange did seem very off when he winked at Peter after Wong told him not to do The spell. He seemed mischievous and gave the same type of smirk that Loki does. Loki or Wanda have the ability to shape shift, sooooooo! Could one of them have locked up Dr Strange and taken his place? The frozen sanctum is the key to what’s going on. Who freezes stuff? Also a hint to why it’s not Strange is Where is his loyal cloak?
The jealous tea identically wait because quiet morphologically clean by a quizzical language. guarded, aloof girdle
I think from here onward, they should make Deadpool be the cameos in all of MCU movies.
Thanks for breaking down the trailer
Why does Spooder-man always has a home title??!!!  Like Spider-Man: Home Has Left The Game
I wonder if Stan Lee shows up :P
Fan from India i hope i get the price 💜☺️
I honestly think this movie is going to be an “Avengers level threat” movie and hopefully be like 2hr30m/3hours long, will this be a sinister six style movie do you think?
I don't believe that is The Lizard. I believe its Rintrah, the green minotaur.
This movie will shake the whole mcu❤
I'm excited and worried I hope they show the 2 spidermans if they don't they will surely get atton if Backlash
I'm wondering what theories there are regarding the box Spiderman is holding when Dr. Strange casts out Spiderman's astral form.
Super excited for this film
Weird that Spiderman and Dr. Strange are the villains in this one
The trailer was amazing
Sooo basically Spider-Man/Peter Parker nearly ends all of reality by disturbing a spell.
Doesn't docter octopus become nice?
could iron man be back because of the broken time thing
The guy smashing papers down in front of peter parker is not charlie cox... Look at his stomach fat Charlie is not fat.
Fantastic Four soon!
Imagine the final twist is "Strange" revealing himself to be Mephisto in disguise. Would be the Chefs kiss of the whole film. There was a subtle hint when his house was frozen and he casted a quick flame.   It would be a perfect way to set up the Multiverse of Madness.
13:27
Great first trailer very high hopes
I'll disagree with you when you say there's snow in the Sanctorum because Hulk crashed through the roof. Because, as you said, Peter got the idea to visit Strange by looking at Halloween lights. And in the shot of Peter approaching the Sanctorum, the trees outside are autumn colors. If Strange could "do the water thing" on the snow, he would. And by the same token, use magic to close the hole in the roof 🤷 So I believe the snow is there intentionally. Also I could be mistaken, but I believe Strange has a permanent illusion over the Sanctorum to make people believe it is run down and dilapidated so it's more of a hideout, to not arouse suspicion from the neighborhood.
i heard it, you said, "Mephisto confirmed"
Looks to be a terrific film! Can't wait!
The unbecoming jumper consistently bury because apology predictably divide amid a acid tuba. rampant, idiotic lemonade
Mephisto is coming just it's gonna be a long long time
Damn can't wait for the release + more conspiracy
I don't believe anyone associated with Marvel or Sony has confirmed Charlie Cox in this movie. Regardless, the person you think is him is clearly interrogating Peter. Matt Murdock is a defense attorney and there's no way you could even recognize him based on a shirt and tie. Also, that woman played by Paula Newsome, a black woman, probably isn't  the mother of Miles Morales who is Puerto Rican. You even mention Puerto Rico immediately after. So much speculation and misinformation in this video.
FYI - no one calls it "Pennsylvania Station". It's called Penn Station. Marvel AND Sony to Heavy Spoilers: "You get nothing! You Lose! Good Day Sir!"
Doctor Strange is being controlled by Mephisto. It was Mephisto all along!!!
Why this dude has more views than Eric Voss? 😡
Venom  comes soon hope the meet
2.7m in 3 days!
In the game Marvel Contest if Champions. This month the new character is Peni Parker,  there is a Sinister Six Event, also a new character is Spider-Man 2099. Not sure if he will have anything to do with movie or not.   And next month they are Buffing (making stronger) Miles Morales.   I think it gives a lot away about the upcoming movie
If he is going to have to fight the whole Sinister Six, then he will almost guaranteed have the other two Spidermen to help him.  Wether they come the same way the villains did or if Strange brings them through to help.
I have this feeling that Andrew and Tobey won't be the main focus. That if they're in it they'll only appear right at the end. And it'll be infuriating 😅 Everyone will have got to the last 10 mins of the movie thinking "oh damn they got us fooled, they got us all hyped with fake rumours" and then there they'll be like surprise we tricked you into thinking we tricked you!
Rid you REALLY say "according to google maps?" Honey if you ever make it to NYC look me up. I will happily take you to Penn Station.! ! Google maps ? REALLY ?? 😂😂😂
The scene of the city breaking or whatever reminds me of the scene near the end of Spider-Man into the spider verse when they were fighting
Jesus Christ is coming to Rapture up his church very soon! Time is running out! We are in the very last days. Bible prophecy is unfolding right before our very eyes! It won't go back to normal! If millions of people disappear, it was Jesus rapturing us out! If you are Left Behind, they will tell you that the aliens took us, and if you are left behind Dont Take The Mark of The Beast!!! If you take it you are Doomed for Eternity!, and wont inherit the Kingdom of God!! Repent and Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior! Jesus Loves So Much and wants to Rescue you!! Surrender to him Today before its too Late!!
For fox sake!
What is it?
I know the ending already.
It’s so crazy how a story and a hero Stan lee made in a newspaper building got y’all going crazy man goals for sure
the 26th second of the trailer, the guy in a white shirt, isn't that Charlie Cox side profile already?
I am really excited and I think that in climax there will be a fight with tom , tobhey and andrew with dr.strange
The annoyed garage tellingly welcome because creator neuroanatomically peep worth a sophisticated cheek. worthless, blue twig
13:27 😂😂😂😂😂
where Scorpion at. Cameo in homecoming years ago
Whatever Pete is resting his head on, on the rooftop scene, definitely bears the Spider-Gwen colors 🤷‍♂️
I don’t think that’s Matt.
They be like 👉👉👉
SHUT THE HELL UP MATE!!!!!!
13:26 WTF??????
🌎🔜🔥B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior who Rose again. There is no peace without repentance and resurrection. ⏳⚰️🪦✝️
Well u forgot something to breakdown about how did strange has new eye of Agamoto.....? 🙂
Really enjoy your breakdown videos and I myself am something if an excited fan.
so do y’all actually think we’re getting Toby & Andrew? or are we all reaching?
cool video
I believe that Molina's Doc Oc is actually saying "Hi Peter" to Toby McGuire and maybe Tom Holland as well. But definitely to Toby McGuire
Infowars is great, MUCH LOVE TO ALEX!!!!!!
Miles Morales is in the film tom leaked it unknowingly theres a clip of a kid and while on set he speaks about it
This might be off-topic, but Korg is underrated.
Only part that sucks is we didn't get Tobey saying "Pizza Time" 😭😭
Why did he have the black and gold suit
I really hope ALL the characters that are rumored to be in this are truly going to be in this!   Also,  how funny is it that Peter interrupts Dr. Strange working his memory erasing spell because he doesn't want certain people to forget that he is spiderman- when all he has to do is just tell the people that he is spiderman after the spell is cast. If he shows his powers I am sure they would believe him!
Don’t you think that’s the goodbye to Auntie May?😱🥺😢
Sorry man...the guy with the shirt that slam papers...not Matt Murdock, he's got a belly in the frame! Matt is fit ! Also he suppose to be blind...Your friend is right.
I have loved all the spider man movies
Oh my gosh another Spider-Man movie trailer gizzfest. It's like announcing to the world that another Big Mac has been made.
Your spoiler accent sucks like Hoover it’s crap 💩
Just got to say it I was born in 2005 I grew u with Toby and that going to be my favorite part of the movie Spider-Man og
If they don’t have all three Spider-Mans do the pointing finger imposter meme in this movie this is a fail
Cool
I’m excited but also worried about this movie it looks like it might have way too much going on could make stuff feel rushed and I’m going say it again Tom Holland deserves a Spider-Man movie where he is the only Hero and true star 1 had Iron man 2 nick fury 3 who the hell knows
Didn’t think anything could beat endgame, but this just might!
All the avengers are gonna forgot about him too even peter himself will forgot who he is and wont know how to use his power
Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Mark 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. Acts 2:38 38. Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Mark 16:15-16 15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.  16. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
ive been saying dr strange is the new CenterPoint of mcu for the longest time and finally happy seeing people recognize dr strange and how powerful he is
The next YouTuber that mentions Mephisto!  I’m going to have my variant wipe that character from our timeline!   At least you didn’t put in your thumbnail and good job and thanks for the breakdown as always!
The Dr. Strange casting the spell could actually be Mephisto or a variant Dr. Strange, the sinister 6 are quickly shown and hinted at, but the shots of Spider-Man and Dr. Strange out in the world Spider-Man is running away from Dr. Strange who is attacking him similar to the fights in the first Doctor Strange movie... Food for thought.
This movie will beat endgame! If everyone returns! This movie will make us all cry!
"Infinity War is the greatest crossover event in history"  Tobey, Andrew and Tom: Hold my beer
Nice video!! Very engaging from beginning to end. Nevertheless, businesses and investment are the easiest way to make money irrespective of which party makes it to the oval office.
I can’t wait !!
I cant wait for December!!
So 4v5 Miles Morales and Tobey and Andrew and Tom vs Electro and Sandman and Lizard and Green Goblin and Dr Octopus P.S dont know if Dr Strange will fight then it will be a good 5v5
I am waiting for Tobey to make an appearance
WAIT TOBEY AND ANDREW ARE IN IT? YOU SERIOUS?
Wow just wow, I can't wait
Imagine if we do see mephisto! That could mean the most bad ass marvel character could be coming back, GHOST RIDER
I'm hoping this doc ock will be good, end of 2 he redeems himself and saves the city, he supposedly drowns but he's back looking clean and comes from an explosion on a bridge which goblin could have caused? Either way I love that version of doc and I hope he gets some good scenes
The fact that there are so many villains facing Toms Spider-Man (to me), alludes to the high possibility he will need more Spider-Men to fight them all. Because, it seems Dr Strange isn’t really Dr Strange, based on his reckless use of such a dangerous spell and him casting a flame reeallly seems like a Mephesto thing.
What if strange gives him a spell to go talk to tony one last time
Dying to see more on the other Spider-Men.. December can’t come soon enough!!
They should bring back the twin towers helicopter scene from the original first trailer in one of the alternate realities
I can't believe myself Dr. octobus is back again Memories of 2004 are back again

I have a feeling Martin li can be the 6th villian in this movie....since this movie has the F.E.A.S.T and spiderman game ps4 also had the F.E.A.S.T with martin li....and martin li is asian and since  we have shang chi releasing in a few days we may see martin li in the end credits or something in shang chi

"Infinity War is the greatest crossover event in history"  Tobey, Andrew and Tom: Hold my beer
Looks good
Love you bro
“We do know that Charlie Cox will be in the movie…” I HOPE SO
If Sandman and Lizard is in the movie, Sandman already had forgiven by Tobey Spiderman in the last part of the Movie , Also Lizards last Scene in Amazing Spiderman was is on Prison with his last words "You should leave him(Andrew Garfield Spiderman) alone to someone that is also ploting for sinister 6, maybe this two somehow wouldn't pose as an enemy to Spiderman. Just a theory after re watching both movies.  Also it would be great if they include Eddie Brock from Sam Raimi Spiderman, that guy might still have some beef to Peter after being killed by him by a pumpkin bomb from Goblin Jr
I don’t think that’s Matt Murdock
You missed:   "Steve Ditko’s name can be seen in the first shot of the trailer, as some graffiti on the wall behind Peter and MJ.   Ditko co-created both Spider-Man and Doctor Strange..."
All I Know Is I Hope There Is A Second Spider-Man Trilogy, Like Him in College Dealing with Villains By Himself (No Iron man, Strange, Fury, Other Spidermen) Just Him Dealing With New Rouges Like Scorpion, King Pin (Vincent From Daredevil), Kraven (Sony’s Version), Chamaeleon
3:46 I'm dead 😂😂😂😂
I want a marvel box!!
That Ditko graffiti on the roof.
Gen Alpha: ITS DOC OCK  Gen z and above: ITS ALFRED MOLINA
I just realized that the trailer for No Way Home just set up the possibility of Venom and Carnage coming to the MCU. Since the sequel to Venom is coming soon, and Woody Harrelson is finally becoming Carnage, maybe at some point towards the end Carnage will find a multiverse portal open while running away and Venom will give chase. Since Spider-Man hasn't met them yet and he'll think they're both bad, maybe he'll fight Venom at first but they'll team up to beat Carnage just like in Maximum Carnage.
Should redo the time stamps. They're not correct at all, dr ock for example
At the time of this you have 666k subscribers that's the work of Mephisto😯😯😯 let that sit in.
If tobey is not there I AINT WATCHING!
I'm SO EXCITED! It's gonna be so good. 💖
I'm so excited for this! I'm so hyped
Where is Miles Morales....
I just hate how people expecting the old movies spider men  Like I just want short CAMEOS and a sinister 6 thing WE JUST ALREADY HAD A MOVIE FOR THE SPIDER VERSE  DUDDDDEEEE IF YOU WANT THE OLDER MOVIES SPIDER MANS THEN WANT ALLLLL OF THEM 🙄🤮👎  how god dam lame would a spider VERSE be if you only HAD TWWOOOOOOOOO
wow 666k subs scary
How the hell is the MCU able to keep us this hooked even after Endgame and the expected cool off?
Theory the people are Twitter users
The ending is sad, I predict Tom Holland’s Peter Parker gets trapped in the Sony universe and can’t go back this ends toms trilogy and starts miles Spider-Man in the mcu
Already over it.
“ I got a nephew that lives here “ why is the fact that that was so many years ago that Donald glover said that and everybody forgot about it.. this is the perfect movie for miles to cameo in and the scene in the trailer where black suit Peter runs thru the “ feast “ shelter owned by miles mom…
OH SHIT RAFFY TULFO IS IN SPIDERMAN WHAT A GRATE MOVIE I HOPE I CAN SEE
7:12 looks a whole lot like the spiderman 3 black suit, even has the webbing on it
Wait are we only getting three Spiderman movie? Are there still cameos?
2:56 I think it's matt too bc if u slow down that scene and look at him as he walks into the room it so obviously looks like matt even if it's blurry I personally haven't finished daredevil yet but ik foggy leaves him to fend for himself at some point so I'm sad foggy won't make an appearance but I'm so happy that matt is back
"Hello Peter" really gave me an infinite nostalgia
That green bomb and doc oc screne's definitely big hype instead of spIronman himself
Doc Oc looks like john lennon
I think this year will have the greatest christmas and I hope so. I also wish I'm gonna be okay this year because I always feel unhappy, I just want to be happy, contented and okay.
Sut up friend
Wong with bags. Obviously he was on his way to go fight abomination in 10 Rings. Edit: um...nevermind, LOL
YEah so did charlie cox get super fat recently? cuz that dude in the shot has a big gut and some love handles. Ya'll need to chill its not charlie cox.
what if venom showed up in the last
*Tobye must comes back or i ll rate it 1 star on IMDB*
That's not Charlie Cox's love handles that dudes a chunk..
Great video!
Awesome trailer and also great breakdown
That's an amazing trailer breakdown. Love the trivia and history lesson. Keep up the good work ! 🙌
Oh yeah, it's pizza time alright
They did a lot a throwback shots foreshadowing from past films visual wise I get vibes from Raimi verse n webbs verse just from clips from the trailer
How can you say he got pulled from his universe and then say he's a different version 🤔
Most anticipated since endgame
I love the vids very cool
i think aunt may and peter are looking at cops there looks like emergency lights flickering on the wall
I found a site and Idk how I got this movie fully  I know you won't believe me so here's what's we have on the movie  Electro and Doc Octopus fights to decide who would kill spiderman,  Green Goblin on the other hand joins spiderman team and helps him defeating the othe 2 of them. Sandman was there indeed, but his screen time was short, very short. And at last Aunt May Dies, and Doc Octopus killed her by one of his tentacke But but but  We as we see Peter messing with Doc Strange's spell in the beginning, so it was all messed up Doc strange again casts the spell at the last of the movie, then everything go back to normal as it was in the beginning, but now this time the spell worked, and everybody forgot that he was spiderman, but only Ned knew
I think they've de-aged Alfred Molina too much.
I think they might have deep faked Doctor Octopus.
What's in the F#€% is meant by Easter eggs?? This sounded dumb the first time I heard it and it has sounded more and more ridiculous every time I've heard it since. Lame
You have 666k subscribers
I think I’ll stick to new rockstars. This was really bad. I’m commenting because it’ll help your algorithm and the feedback might help your videos.
Yea, but Mat is definitely out of shape
Wait how does Dr. Strange bend reality. You could only do it if you have a deal with Dormamu or something right?
What if Uncle Ben comes back as Cliff Robertson… we never met the uncle Ben from the current universe so i feel like they could pull it off.
Think you should battle rap doc oc
Two villians from Tobey Maguire's spiderman got confirmed in this trailer and people still think he won't show up.
If Matt Murdoc is really in this movie, I'm gonna freak out. Just imagine him and Peter fighting Wiilson Fisk. Can't wait!!!!!
really excited to see how this all plays out, these next couple of movies that marvel is coming out with I think are going to do great
666K subs
This crossover might beat The Dark Knight 😬😬, too soon? 👉🏻👈🏻
Swear on everything if Tobey appears I am gonna cry in the theaters I DON'T CARE
I can't help but notice that Dr. Strange is stranger than usual. IDK looks younger and sillier? more talkative? It's definitely not Benedict Cumberbatch isn't it? is that an imposter? Sorry if I sounded silly I'm new to MCU.
You missed another detail buddy. If you look closely at that sandman figure, you could see spiderman with the black suit, swinging across
What if Time Travel occurs in 'No Way Home'! Spider-man will be travel to Tobey's universe where he fight Green Goblin & Dr. Ock at the bridge where Dr. Ock died & Garfield's universe where he fight Electro & Sandman! Lizard had be captured by Dr. Strange earlier in prison-like mystic place. The most important Clue is where in Spiderman 1 there is a 2nd Green Goblin behind Green Goblin in 1 scene!
Assuming that dude is Charlie Cox just because he's wearing a white shirt and tie combo is extremely optimistic.  Also I believe Wong was confirmed as survived the snap.
So no toner or Andrew?
I think aunt may will get in trouble as an a complex of prayers crimes
Tobey’s gonna throw some dirt in strange’s eyes
Hello, Beter
No mention of the reprisal of JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson as somewhat of a bridge at the end of far from home.
There’s no way that’s Charlie Cox in that scene. Just look at the figure of the guy. Dude is way out of shape.
Strange:we messed up the flow of time Peter:i missed the part where that is my problem
I don’t think that is Dr. Strange.
2:59 Nahh, thats Fat Murdock
The girl is Zedayla not Mary Jane
"Infinity War is the greatest crossover event in history"  Tobey, Andrew and Tom: Hold my beer
Hoping for some badass fight scenes that are on the same level as the train scene from Spiderman 2 .
Rather than going to dr. Strange why not ask Nick Fury or Happy for a help. They also knew that mysterio is a bad guy right ?
2:41 the guy on the screen is way too belly dad bod to be Charlie cox
Remember, Marvel has a thing with trailers.   Much in this trailer will not make it in the actual movie
Looking totally tubular, if I do say so myself.
Why would Spiderman friends be outlasted? Lol seriously trying so hard to include the minimal characters
Imagine a muslin being named flash thompson
From the game
Him when he realized that is the anti doc ock
"This is definitely the best movie since Endgame for me..."  Except Endgame was a steaming pile of crap, ESPECIALLY if you read Infinity Gauntlet. Time travel? Really? They ruined Tony Stark, Captain America, Thor, and Hulk. The stupid political commentary was overwhelming (I don't mind a little here and there, but this was in your face). And nothing made any logical sense. Yes, there were some great moments, but overall it was complete garbage.
Peter: man, I wish wizards exists... Oh wait! I know a wizard *GOES TO A WIZARD*
When we finnaly get our rent
cant wait!
Will Tom Holland have a new suit ? I hope he has something more comic book accurate like a red and blue.
So awesome, I can't wat!
Why is no one talking about how Happy Hogan will most likely die?
Do you remember so what called time keepers?
Looks like you were right matey, great job!
The scene where peter takes mj swinging looks like the scene where peter saves mary jane from falling off a piece of rock by the green goblin bomb

Can someone tell me why on earth wong would need to want strange of anything. Dr. Strange is the smarted and most powerful sorcer supreme ever. Isn’t he well aware of what will and won’t happen with the spells he casts?
WHAT IF ITS IRON MAN WALKING IN Aunt May And Peters House :O
I keep hearing people say there's snow in the sanctum cause of Hulk. But the stairs are already fixed and the snow is on every inch of the walls too. I think it's actually a failed spell! Everyone is saying Strange is acting funny, maybe it's not him and that's why he failed on the memory spell AND a spell to warm the sanctum!
Spiderman no way home = part 1 , madness of multiverse = part2
Me when this movie is amazing: Ahhh Rosie, I love this boy. Me if this movie is somehow bad: Brilliant, but lazy.
I have a feeling Dr Strange is going through a phase similar to Wanda after endgame. And strange is not himself right now he will fix his mistake and be Dr Strange again after this event. He will be in basically every movie afterwards
My only question is how did Goblin got pulled into this universe if he was impaled? Like if all villains were pulled into this universe before they died it doesn't make sense since Goblin was killed already.
All my dreams are coming true 😍😭 what a great time to be alive! The MCU is where it’s at! 💜
i just care about doc oc and green goblin returning... i haven't seen a single spiderman movie after toby
hey bruh?...... quit saying bruh!
Gonna be a crazy ride
i cannot wait to watch this movie in theaters— i have a feeling its going to be outstanding
Add Bruce Campbell as Mysterio from the Raimi-verse and you will have sold me a ticket.
The design for the iron spider suit is different from infinity war is because in avengers endgame it got blown apart and got reassembled that's why it looks different in this movie and far from home
“Pennsylvania station“ Awwww hahaha
Do y'all remember a tv show that call Quantum leap it is going be close enough like the show and the CGI movie in I saw that MJ the one who with Tom Holland is a secret of her farther in mother are Jessica Jones in Cage the tv show that was on Netflix
"You'll get your rent when you fix this damn door!"
It's not Matt Murdock he's too fat
The Halloween decorations remind me of happy in a witch costume 🤷🏻‍♀️
Nah he tweakin
Omg omg omg it’s gonna be so good.
13:27 LMAO
If that is Murdoch, he's got some love handles for a superhero...
He is taking the path like Tony stark I wouldn't  even be surprised if he said "I am Spider-man" or something Simular to carry Tony's legacy. Idk I just figured it would be cool.
I seriously wish Tony was alive now
The person who leaked the spoiler: "Had to beat an old lady with a stick to get this"
I like spider-man
Nah he tweaking
If Tobey Maguire is in this movie, expect a new Tobey memes.
did anyone else look at the way peters legs are crossed.  looks like fantastic 4 logo.  first appearance of spider man was in their book
The second-hand kangaroo nearly suppose because node archaeologically store versus a elderly prepared. barbarous, abounding helicopter
I hate that they named that chick MJ.
Pretty sure I got everything on my own the very first time I watched the trailer….
The mammoth agenda habitually stare because daughter successfully lick after a uncovered sweater. roasted, quaint door
noice
@heavyspoilers if I don’t win the MCU box set, I’m gonna put some dirt in your eye
The events with Peter talking in the trailer during the spell kind of feels like Holland’s IRL chattiness made canonical
Hey I’m new here and this was a good break down. I’m gonna sub now
I can't wait till it comes out!
I'd like to win the prizes...I show kids in detention facilities these movies.
He could be pretending to be Dr strange and strange is acting weird the entire time
"Infinity War is the greatest crossover event in history"  Tobey, Andrew and Tom: Hold my beer
You know what this movie needs. Me!!!!!!!!
I'd love to see daredevil....but the guy who slammed the paper is clearly bigger in his gut than Murdock
Why is New Rockstars so much better. Lol
do y’all realize infinity war was the “greatest crossover” and now this is happening. what’s next? x-men in the MCU?
3:38 that's not a flashback. That's not even a courthouse. It's Peter's school. It's the same location as in homecoming as he leaves the school and jumps over the fence.
W
This is totally building up to a Sinister Six scenario. Doc Ok and Green Goblin are pretty much confirmed. The Lizard (or maybe Venom) is possibly shown in the trailer. Mysterio wasn't confirmed dead. Just need Sand Man or Vulture. Although Kraven would be better because the OG six. Sony needs to continue working with Marvel on this. I'm more hyped for this than I was for Endgame!
New subscriber yay😄
How did you know Charlie Cox will be in the movie?! Do you have sources?
So, are you better or worse than Mr. Sunday Movies?
going to say when Peter and May are sitting on the couch and she sits up you can see police lights in the background window, so this has to be when the police come in to arrest him
The poster all over Times Square with the split face of Peter and Spider-Man is the same poster in Episode 7 Season 2 of the animated series Spectacular Spider-Man from the 90s
This is what a trailer is supposed be, get you excited about the movie without spoiling anything.  Nuff said!
Did not know how excited I would be for this.
Flash Gordon is in the trailer
Everybody keeps talking about Tobey, what about Andrew? 😪
It's quite funny to see Strange in mufti under the cloak
You know the calendar in WandaVision is the date for the trailer. You never @ me so it is ok
The way doc oc said *Hello Peter* is big pedophile mode
unless matt murdock ate cheetos all day throughout phase 3, then i dont think the guy that slams the files on the table is him? What does everyone else think? Is it him or not?
I really wonder if they finally do bring in Uncle Ben.
That wasn't Matt Murdock lol
I need this to be a true team up for at least the whole final act. My best case scenario  theory.    Act 1 - Tom Holland's Peter and MJ try to escape the city but fail - A Lawyer Steps in to clear Peter's Name, Its Matt Murdock. (Please Please) - Matt Murdock Wins the case, but Peter's life still sucks so he goes to Dr. Strange. Dr. Strange gives Peter a vision of what could happen if they mess with this magic, (the train sequence), but Peter manages to convince Strange because too many other people are suffering. The spell successfully erases the memory of EVERYONE, (Peter messing with the spell doesn't actually cause Dr. Strange to mess up. He succeeds).    BUT everyone's memories ares stored in a multiverse "Box". (This Box is a magical gateway to specific other timelines where Peter's identity remains anonymous or something.)   Act 2 - Peter wants to restore the memory of MJ and his friends so he steals the box from Dr. Strange and enters into the multiverse to get her memory of him back. This MIGHT be where Strange tries to warn Peter with a vision instead. Somehow, he gets the black and gold Spiderman suit to do this. Movie Bob (The Youtuber) suggested Kang the conqueror actually provides him with this "magic" suit. Peter enters the multiverse box and this is also where we run into Lizard, who is for some reason trapped in this dimension. Maybe its a pocket dimension of some sorts. Peter also encounters Miles Morales in this mix of timelines working for FEAST.   Miles will probably help Peter in some way (His mother is the one looking at peter in the car) - but something goes wrong. Maybe this is where we get the Inception sequence which will end with Strange knocking Peter into his astral form. Whatever Peter does in this act, it will unleash the other villains of the multiverse, who are trapped there for some reason - probably Kang. (but Kang won't reveal his true identity in this film).   The villains all appear back in the MCU and attack Peter on the overpass. (Where Peter is trying to help out Mile's Mom in HIS universe for some reason. Maybe Miles is in trouble.) Peter gets his ass beat like in the recent video game. Realizing Peter needs help, but unwilling to clean up his mess much like Tony Stark in the first Homecoming movie, Strange helps Peter summon two other versions of himself.   Act 3 - The footage of Electro and Sandman are the only moments from Act 3 in the trailer. They can't show us any more of that fight because both other Peter Parkers from film history feature heavily.  Together the 3 face off against the Sinister six, including Vulture, and win. I hope hope hope its an entire act and not just a cameo.
I would die laughing if Doc Oc said " hello Peter....brilliant but lazy" then we would kno its Tobey
Everyone is talking about a spidey 3 vs sinister 6 fight.... what about å spidey 6 vs sinister 18 (from the 3 spidermen's universe
“This is it.” “What?” “If I take one more step, I'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.” “Come on, Sam.”
Watching the trailer and then this makes me want this movie to come out right now!
That's not Dr. Strange.... that's Wanda.
I think it’s more likely that Winter is Coming™ to the Sanctum due to some kind of a spell misfire than Strange having issues finding a contractor to fix the Hulk sized hole in the roof.
Have you seen the photos on IMDb for What If episode 4? It shows that Dr. Strange is fighting a dark variant of himself.  That probably explains why Strange and Spider-Man are fighting on top of the train during the teaser trailer.
Well said careful what you wish for indeed. Also curious to know why Strange would agree…
We’ll said careful what you wish for indeed. Also curious to know why Strange would agree…
Sinister 6 vs Spiderverse has to be the next movie ,,, no way they are going to fit all this in . I’m going to have a heart attack
Idk if anyone will actually see this comment however it’s highly unlikely that mephisto will ever be in the mcu. The reason for this is that China has either the second most or the most views for box office or something like that but of course they have a lot of censorship rules you have to follow in order for your movie to be aired there and one of the things is basically paranormal characters and the devil is exactly that because mephisto is the devil so marvel would lose out on a lot of box office if mephisto actually was aired in china and obviously they don’t want to lose money so they probably will never add him.
I have a theory that either Doctor Strange (the one in the frozen Sanctorum) isn't really Doctor Strange (maybe Mephisto? 😝) or that frozen Sanctorum Doctor Strange is an alternate reality version that Peter got to with the use of that box since the main reality Doctor Strange tells Peter he won't help, which is why they are fighting on the train and such. I just can't believe that the original reality Doctor Strange would be that reckless with a spell like that. Seems really out of character.  By the way, is that box in the comics? Does it have a name? I've tried to Google it, but haven't found anything.  Also, as someone mentioned already, Doc Ock could actually be talking to Tobey's Peter. If Molina's Doc Ock is from a different reality, then how would he know the Peter being portrayed by Tom Holland is Peter Parker? Maybe those scenes are Tom's Peter in Tobey's universe? 🤔
Another thing, it could be Maguire to whom DocOc is referring to, as when the goblin bomb explodes, out of that explosion DocOc comes out instead of Green Goblin. Maybe Tom's Spidey was gearing up for green goblin but the trailer  cut as such to make you believe it was DocOc.
I saw somewhere that in the Doc Oc scene Peter was wearing an exact same suit like Maguire wore in Spiderman 3, then I remembered how Strange told Peter that you are trying to live two different lives, the longer you do it the dangerous it becomes. That made me think what if Tom's Spidey was somehow living in Tobey's body, and that's how DocOc recognised him as Peter Parker. It doesn't make any sense but that's what I understood.
That is not Matt Murdock. Too fat
Let’s be honest we’re watching for tobeys Spider-Man.
Have Tobey and Andrew completely denied being in this movie in an interview? I hope not
Good job
I love raimi's doc ock and green goblin, but i hate maguires spiderman. I hope he isnt in the movie too much
I didn't see The Lizard in the trailer. Can't wait to see how this will play out.
Anyone else feeling some rumbles of precursors to a Secret Wars-type event? Just me?
That guy was carrying a little too much weight to be Matt.
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  1 John 5:13  These things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may KNOW that ye have ETERNAL LIFE, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
Scarlet Witch: NO MORE trailers
Why is it specifically tobey and andrew  that are pulled from the multiverse not any other character in the mcu
You can hear William's Goblin chuckle when the pumpkin bomb is shown
Could that be the 'evil' doc from What-IF?
Penn Station is currently used by Amtrak to transport passengers along the northeast belt line but years ago there was an older building now demolished that was grand and spacious.
4:43 I think this is when the police are showing up to arrest/take Peter in for questioning? In the background around the curtains we can see the red and blue flashing lights, so gonna guess it’s probably the cops rolling up. 🤔  Great vid!! December can’t come soon enough! 😩
Not to keep this myth going, but the Sanctorum was frozen. Could be an alluding to hell freezing over and that the strange is really Mephisto.
My thoughts of my first look of the trailer was that the rumors william dafoe and Alfred Molina were true and that means that maybe tobey and Andrew are gonna be in the movie
🤡🤡🤡🤡
Unfortunately m8, I got an even "heavier" spoiler for you. Cinemas will be closed over Christmas due to the pandemic.
there has to be the last sinister six character. Right?
so.. is a big deux ex machina... the spell goes wrong and the old villans appear just bcos... i REALLY hope is not that literal...
If your spoiler section in this vid is true (which they always are…Mephisto included) then this movie is going to be bananas
Music on minute 6?????
Dafoe as Goblin, Molina as Ock, I swear if Tobey comes back as Spidey for a three spidey interdimensional battle against the Sinister Six (Goblin, Doc Ock, Electro, Vulture, Scorpion and Mysterio-Lizard)
Petition to make the tobey peter. Once again emo-tobey in the new movie.
Either Daredevil has spent the past three years devouring donuts or that isn't him.
I hope Tom makes a 4 bc the rest only got to 2 or 3 so far he in 3
Search  CID MOOSA  and comment if u see someone who looks a lot like Dr octopus
And everything was a dream! the end.
if that guy was charlie cox, then DD has been letting himself go... the dude isn't fat, but he definitely has a little bit of a pouch... also it's a shot right after the 2 DODC dudes go in to interrogate peter.
Spider-Man: * gets interrogated * Daredevil: _"Peter Parker, stop talking"_ Spider-Man: "Uhh... Who are you?" Daredevil: "I'm Matt Murdock, you're public defender."
Really? charlie boy right on daredevil heck ya cant wait
Great video
Hoping for Tobey and Andrew’s appearance !
if i dont see tobey maguire teaming up and kicking some ass, im gna be very disappointed
James Franco gobby at the end!!!
Is that really Dr. Strange?
Marvel : we got one powerful villain for movies  Sony : we got dozens of powerful villains for single movie
Great video man! Love the breakdown
"Infinity War is the greatest crossover event in history"  Tobey, Andrew and Tom: Hold my beer
4:12 lol that helicopter says Wype
I don’t think it will disappoint :D
Easter egg theres a meme in this trailer break down
A lot of things with that other guy are different than you. Is the other guy emergency awesome??
I bet my life savings Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield will have about 15 minutes screen time. Pure cameos. Their villains will have a much bigger role than them.
This looks so great!  Great video on this.
The theory where aunt may dies... i cant shrug it off cause of happy's look at 11:00 ...
How to make a 2 min trailer into a 18 min video
Congrats on #2 trending
So stoked for this!!!!!
Just wait until he cast the spell, and then tell them. I thought Peter was a Tony Stark level of genius.
Spoilers? Like in the thumbnail, yeah thanks for the warning, what a waste
peter , jst made a video on this trailer , come to watch it
Nothing to do with the info given: I love that Strange has on a sweat shirt under his cape when the the Sanctum is "snowed in." That is a very me thing to do. I'll be in the house with a long sleeve shirt under a short sleeved shirt with a hoodie over both all under my bath robe. I absolutely HATE being cold.🥶   About the info given: I love the whiteboard hint to PR as a slight shout out to Miles Morales, but I don't want the character to join the live action MCU (at least not any time soon). For one, if these predictions are correct this movie is loaded with characters that are fan favs & could (should) carry over to other movies. Second, Mile's animated movie was dope as hell. He deserves his own spotlight & to have that character arc continue for a little longer. I know a second movie will happen, but I'm hoping for more.
@4:45 the shot where "Someone enters the house" with Peter and Aunt, there are police lights on the window, does that mean that a police car is parked outside and some kind of detective, a policeman, lawyer? is there? perhaps someone they know and trust, since he/she opened the door? maybe bringing updates on Peter's legal issue? they are watching the news with a worried face.
my opinion it all begin at Dr.Strange movie 1, when he break the rule and mordo said " there a price to pay for breaking rule, and the bill  comes due". Maybe that action lead to Loki got the time stone and time break apart. So dr. strange trying to fix that by looking for madame Web, the assistant of the Beyonder. So its all Dr. Strange fault.
I cannot wait this should be the best spider man movie ever
I wonder if it's another spider man walking in when they are sitting on the couch
Trending on number 5!
Multi verse n all villians linked up to kill spiderman simple
Spiderman in black-red suit swinging into fall-colored trees from spiraled buildings reminds me of Miles Morales from Spiderverse, or is that really Miles Morales? Can anyone explain? Sorry I can't comb through 7.3K comments
My trailer review and predictions is up, go easy on me please 😅
As much as I wish this wasn't the case, there's no guarantee that this version of Doc Ock is the one from the Sam raimi version. For all we know the same actor came back to play a a different version of Ock.
Air Jordan shadow grey or black smoke 💨
So no one gonna notice the shoes
Orrrrr dr strange is Mephisto hence why he did the spell even after wong told him not to, causing all the realities to clide. Ultimately causing Holland’s Peter a bunch of havoc.
Spider-Man frees the villains instead of letting them die... and they still want to kill him later? UH... that's a dumb plot try this:  Spoiler alert: Strange isn't casting a spell to affect the entire world (otherwise Peter and Strange would be affected) and Wong wasn't really there. There are two possible outomes:  Strange instead looks for and finds an alternate reality -- becasue Phase 4 is all about multiverse shenanigens -- where Peter was either never bitten by a spider and died or where he was but died... then transports Peter to live in that universe... temporarily. Until Peter sees that it isn't a sustainable choice because reasons. However it is more likely that this is Dr.Strange casting a huge phantasmagoria, like Kaecilius did -- becasue the moving buildings look almost exactly the same inside that fake universe -- which Strange can do because Strange learned everything Kaecilius knew. Anyway this illusionary world is every fear of Peter's come to life in the contet of not having anyone to support him. Strange does this to Peter to help him ultimately deal with the catastrophe he's created and to LIVE UP TO THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HIS POWER -- the message of every darn Spider-Man story ever. Everyone has supported Peter and now instead of using him incredible power to save them, he wants an easy way out. No, Peter, you can't do that, you're a superhero.   The snag will be that Karl Mordo will catch Dr.Stange unaware, leading to the event in Multiverse of Madness... which will lead a Harmful Half-dozen jumping through a few errant portals and directly into the next Spider-Man sequel, Home Team, or Homeland, or Home, Home on the Range.
“Even fools seem smart when they are quiet.” Proverbs 17:28 CEV
Personally I don’t think the snow is because of the hulk size hole in the roof. I think Strange was probably just experimenting with some spells and froze the sanctum as a result because it doesn’t look like this movie is taking place in winter nor that Peter goes there in winter.
Amazing
Expecting to see Tobey in this movie, he still the real Spider-Man
willam defoe 🤝 meme gold
Ok how powerful is strange.. He can manipulate the mind of the whole world.. That's crazy... Can't wait for dr strange multiverse of madness... Can't wait for any of the movie..
Clearly, NOT Charlie Cox. His gut is far too big.
G*gh
spidey love
I don't think Wong is going off to fight the Abomination if Shang Chi is supposed to be taking place during the "Blip" and Spider Man Far from Home was after the Blip which makes No Way Home after the Blip as well.
Great rundown. A lot of good theories. Really looking forward to the movie. I've been super enjoying what if. I never actually saw all the Marvel movies as they came out, so I've been going through them one by one, and thanks to Disney Plus using the Japanese audio option when available to practice my comprehension skills. It's cool stuff and I can't wait to see the next three movies in the MCU through the rest of this year in theaters.
Do you really think that is Matt Murdock?? with that Donut-Eating Belly... come on...
what is on Dr Stranges mug?
Why is no one talking about Harley Keener coming in as Iron Man?
So excited! Fell for this channel with all the brilliant Tenet videos 👍
Great insight man love your videos
I never been this exited for a new spider man movie its good seeing dr ock in the movie
I KNOW FOR A FACT when Ock says “Hello Peter” he isn’t talking to Tom. At least not the way they show the cut of it. Look at the position of the black Ford F-150 in the background on the bridge. Goblin throws his pumpkin bomb and you can see the damaged Kia in the front with the door ripped off with the F150 still intact in the background. In the next shot, Peter is looking in FRONT of the Kia to his right and the door is still intact at that point. Then you see the Doc Ock’s arms and he breaks through the bridge right in front of the black F150. Then when it cuts back to Peter the F150 is in the background again, still intact, and Peter is looking forward down the road. There’s a reason they’re hiding it but that definitely isn’t all the same cut put together
@10:30 the rainbow effect is actually the exact same one Strange saw when he saw the visions from Ancient One with the rainbow holding his legs and arms. It's different from the Bifrost effect
12:33 Black and gold Spidey suit! 😁
You cannot look at the body type of that Lawyer and think it is Charlie Cox....
what the heck is up with the "Subtitle" at 13:27? LOL
I really hope audience to show up in theaters.. i think sitting at home and watching it with premium access is not gonna be interesting...
I wonder if ned will be the Nom Goblin.
14:41 wait why is that potentially Miles Morales' mother exactly lmao
You get your rent when you fix this d*mn door!  🤣
God Bless you all. Please accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior now! He is returning any moment and your eternal salvation is more important than anything else. The End Is Near! This is the most important decision you can make in this life! Just BELIEVE in Jesus as Lord, and you shall have eternal life in Heaven!
When dr.strange said we are connected to a multi parallel like that some thing I think the 2 spidermans could come
The guy slamming the files is the prosecuting attorney. Check imdb all cast and crew of the movie. Last one on the page is Marvin West. This guy matches the belly fat
“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” ‭‭Mark‬ ‭8:36‬ ‭KJV‬‬
My theory is that by concentrating heavily on people who know Spider-man's real identity, Strange pulls strong presences from other dimensions that are fixated on SM. Although I'm unsure if this applies to electro, as I don't remember if he knew who SM was in ASM2 (but I think he did).
5:46 is that a black Panther or not?
I’m living rent free in the comment section like Peter 😉
I was excited for this movie for Charlie cox, now with the reveal of the Goblin I'm even more excited. I could care less if Tobey and Andrew are in this tbh. Andrew is my favorite spiderman but I dont need them in the movie.
Who else agrees that Tom Holland is the best peter parker and Tobey is the best spiderman...
The train scene is fake its going to be the city not desert.
We need those ghostbusters after life spoilerd
"Hello Peter."
Am I missing something why do you think that woman is Miles mother???
Can you randomly pick this comment???
Spoilers
This movie is going to blow our minds away! Can’t wait for December 17th!
B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior. No peace without repentance and resurrection. Only Jesus has risen.
where is Scorpion?
I can’t wait for this movie. I grew up watching Tobey’s Spider-Man and it was a big part of my childhood, so to see him on the big screen again is really going be epic.
My Theory is that Parker gets sent to two different universes swapping himself for the other Parkers. We can guess this when Strange tells Parker "your trying to live two different lives." This puts Tobey and Andrew's Parkers in a realm where they try to figure out why someone has taken their place in their universe. Hollands Parker then meshes the two universes together causing one chaotic reality. Where a few of the big bads come together to finally kill Spiderman. Trying to undo everything Holland Parker agrees to help Strange, where Strange finally introduces the other Spidermen to Holland banding together to fix their realities.
Here is my wild guess at the plot.  6 villains will arise from the chaos, two from each of the franchise movies.  Dr ock Green Goblin Lizard Electro  And what we saw was not sandman but mysterio using the same illusion tech to confuse the spidermans. And the lady we saw in the car isn't miles morales mother, but Liz. Meaning the vulture will also be in the show.
Tobey : "Harry saved my life" Andrew : "Harry killed my girlfriend" Tom : "Who the hell is Harry?!
what if instead of uncle ben coming back tony stark will
This definitely cannot be tom hollands last time as spiderman. Hes been by far the best one since maguires spiderman 2
I can't wait to release this movie huhu I'm crying
Great breakdown as always, thank you man, got me even more hyped!
Idk why but the man behind peter as he goes to court looks more like Brad Davis from far from home with bleached hair.
everybody talking bout how tobey and adrew will be canon   meanwhile andrew having no signs he will be in it  and tobey's doc oc being in it, because yes
Dude... Honestly... at this point I don't think that this is the actual trailer... I mean... It's a fake... I mean... from sony themselves... I don't believe shit. I'm an idiot huh.
Are u sure the Goblin isn't harry
"Devil in disguise" "Make everyone forget I'm Spiderman" *Doctor Strange has left the chat* *Mephisto has entered the chat* Note: There is no way a) Strange is strong enough to do a multiversal scale spell all by himself b) He is confident, but not completely reckless, there is no way he would attempt this, so... yeah, Mephisto
Amazing review… you made us all excited for this movie.
Imagine if Vulture And sandman helps peter
This movie is going to be so good.
I'm not going to lie, i just got back from holiday and saw this trailer, and I was underwhelmed. My hype for this is way too high, not sure anything will satisfy it until I see the film. Fingers crossed it's not delayed
Can’t wait to Watch the movie
Was that Black Spider-Man?!
Yesss mophisto+
Damn you guys are fast. I'm just hoping Tobey appears in the next trailer.
They finally taped into the spidervers
Wow
Really hoping to see Miles Morales pulled in to complete a 4-Spiderman team up
"Christmas" lights in a bedroom is a common decorating theme (and they're great for low level lighting) for some young folks. I don't know that they're meant to show it's Christmastime, but we'll see.
So doc confuses current Peter Parker for previous 2000 Peter in old Sony movies, possibly doesn’t realize it’s a whole different kid. But to Oc it doesn’t matter. Any spider man must go. And if there exists many, they all must go.
This video is pog
what u got? what u have?  u have nothing!  so why did u worry economy crisis?  remember you are not rich!
too good, too good
How are you gonna talk about a reference to se7en and then not mention Nick saying “what’s in the box” to Loki?
Don't mention Mephisto Please don't give me hope 😔
Why’s no one talking about James Franco’s Hob Goblin telling a Peter to be careful what he wishes for?
They said that ned is gonna be hobgoblin maybe is that why the grenade was there
"Infinity War is the greatest crossover event in history"  Tobey, Andrew and Tom: Hold my beer
Penny for your thoughts (BTW nice job on the teaser breakdown!). Do you suppose that NWH will have any tie ins with LotTR, beyond the brief time we see Wong heading through the portal? Great job as always, and keep up the great nerdery!
i hope they throw a stan lee cameo in here like on a news paper or something because hed be proud with his spider boys
I think when Dr. Stranger doing the spell for Peter, is exactly when Sylvie kills The One Who Remains. That's why the spell doesnt work right and it causes the multiverse to collided one another.
Man i hope theres 2 parts to this movie like infinity n endgame
Anyone else notice black suit Spider-Man during the electro and sand man scene? Bottom right of the split second shot
Jeez louise this movie is gonna be four hours long!!
13:26 wait what the actual fuck
Great trailer, loved it!
Since we’ve never seen Ben in the mcu version of spiderman, what if instead of Peter bringing him “back” he brings Tony “back”
I think old spidy could be better for this movie
No give me rent
can someone explain what he means by the iron spider has a different design?? it looks the exact same to me
If Murdock got beer belly then sure that's DD alrite
Timecodes in this video are as messed up as a timeline itself at this point
This could very well be better than endgame.  With even more suprise characters . I love how you broke it down 👊
I don't think I've ever been as excited for an MCU project as I am this one, perhaps with the exception of IW and Endgame. Great video!
Will it be bigger than Godzilla vs Kong?
Do you think it will have VENOM?
This simply concludes that none can play doc. Oc. Better than fred molina alone. Period.
I think at the end, Dr. Strange will just "undo" everything that happened. but, I wish we can get the "Spider-Verse" kind of Movie and get to see Tobey again. :D
This Movie will break the Movie Theatre.
If villains of all verse are coming then definitely heroes of all verse also will be there for sure
I had a dream about it but I can’t remember what it was and now the trailer is super weird
Why would wong go fight abominable in Spider-Man when Shang chi is before Spider-Man so he must be going someplace else in preparation for multiverse of madness
i believe the government , the government makes me life better!  except im not working for government!
Not gonna lie I can't stop looking at toms nose 👀👀
So Doc Oc, Green Goblin, Elektro, Sandman and Lizardman will show up and because that to many foes for MCU Peter, Tobey and Andrew Versions show up to help.
Liked all this except the creator beef. Keep the followers out of it. 🚫 🥩
Does anyone know who says “Be careful what you wish for Parker”
It looks amazing
#2 on trending congrats!! 🤯 🎊
What if they make Ned hobgoblin?
The Doc is going to team up with Spiderman.
What if the sign with the devil info on it was hinting at daredevil
Lights in MJs room are just fairy lights. It's a thing kids do now.
Broooo chill with all these puns, dude! :D:D  jk, it's great haha!
number 2 on trending!  Congrats !
Oh! Spider man 3! And they’ve got… loads of villains… like all of them… never seen that before… This is either going to be incredible, or awful, and there will be no in between. This film cannot be just ok.
Wasn’t the time stone and eye of agamotto destroyed in the original timeline , then how come dr strange still have those?
I got an ad in this vid and you will never guess what it was.......                      ok i will tell you it was the new spider man trailer
i just want the sinister six and Kingpin please!
Your source was dead on....you did a great job mate! well done.
Tobey x Andrew x Tom IF ...... IF
I know you showed the original green goblin but in the trailer for no way home you can hear the voice of the green goblin from the amazing spider man 2. Thought it was worth mentioning :)
Plot is "Let there be Carnage"
So exciting
It comes out on my birthday lol 😂😂😂😂😂
:)
I’m really excited
Thank you for this
Since when is Matt Murdock confirmed? And it's Peter walking into school, I can't watch the rest of this video😂
Hi I'd just like to say Jesus Christ really loves you please repent of your sins and put your trust in Jesus Christ today
I bet when doc oct says “hello Peter”, he is saying that to Toby miguire spidey.
Ungrateful sonnababishes. When you saved the world but people accuse you of being a murderer >_<
I can't wait to see Tobey saying "Gonna Cry"
рююмка водки на столееее!
Show me toby Alone
Great breakdown, excitement is growing!
Haha, Mephisto! We all knew it was time for him to reveal himself. I fucking love the Mephisto stuff,
What does Superman handcuffs do with Spider-Man handcuffs?
It's Doc Ock from Tobey Maguire's movie so how would he know Tom Holland as Peter Parker? If they were willing to cross over the different Spider-Man villains into the MCU then it only makes sense to see Tobey and Andrew Garfield too. Otherwise why use the representation of Alfred Molina, they would use a different actor all together. This is a great hint to Doctor Stange in the Multiverse of Madness, it makes sense. 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬
No way that's Matt Murdoch! He's got a belly!
Imagine if Peter didn't use the word "execute". His life would be a lot better.
I wish I wasn't a casual marvel fan like everyone seem to know everything thats going on. I had no idea about Sinister Six or Mephisto, but it seems everyones been hyping the devil villian for years, why?
Its Mr. Hyde. Not abomination
That’s not daredevil. Too chubby
Hi everyone! I posted my first motivational YouTube video! Please watch and subscribe for more motivation videos for you all! 🙌🏽
THIS MOVIE IS A JOJO REFERENCE! REMEMBER: Made In Heaven! or Killer Queen (Requiem)!
Lizardman is back
im guessing that unstable revolving thing that is on the podium after the timelines break down after strange's spell gets interrupted represents the timelines intersecting each other with how unstable it is, as doctor strange was drawing one out first in the air so four rings = four timelines adrew garfield spiderman (electro in trailer) tom holland spiderman (obvs) tobey maguire spiderman (doc oc) then maybe miles marales spiderman?????????
I PUT UP A VIDEO SHOWING MASTER CHRIST SENDING ME A 😇 OF LIGHT, ET PRODUCT
This isn’t even an official trailer yet……shits gonna get crazy
I'm legit dying... Cant wait to watch this
Imagine daredevil being there in the movie! Omfg
art daw hary potter
Thank you MCU for giving us all something we can unite for
2:55 That wasn't Matt Murdock. The guy slamming down the files in the trailer had a gut and unless they are saying the Daredevil has let himself go, I would say this is someone else.  4:45 "I almost get the feeling someone walked in on them by the way that she sits up." LOL You think? Could also be the flashing police lights in the window too and the fact that it's a POV shot and they are looking right into camera as in moves into the room.  5:55 I think that's just how she decorates her room. I don't know many people who decorate their bedrooms and not living rooms for the Holidays. I do think it covers a period of months though. I think that is correct.  6:22 I doubt the reason is because there is still a huge whole in the roof. The snow is piled up in areas where snow wouldn't fall from the hole directly above and the stairs are repaired. The same stairs that Hulk crashed into and destroyed. If those are fixed I imagine that the roof would be too. I feel it's more like Goofy Magic Hijinks. It also seems far colder than it looked in the outside city shot, with all the frost on the walls, furniture and ceiling, and icicles everywhere.  11:50 Don't forget we hear the Green Goblin laugh when the bomb is rolling, too.  12:35 Oh. That was the Lizard? LOL It was so dark I had no idea that was even humanoid.  13:50 I also think that is the subway train from Spider-Man 2 that Peter stops because that's the only Spider-Man film to put a train system, that doesn't exist in real life, in New York.  14:24 It's also something that the Accent One did to Dr. Strange. To which would be the only one he would know about because he wasn't there for the Hulk autoprojection punch. LOL  14:50 LOL A bit of a stretch, but okay.
i know it’s part of the movie but could peter just tell them again that he was spider man after the spell
3 spideys vs Dr. Octopus hahaha
Okay, we have a black suit, a green goblin bomb, and OG doc oc. Sony, PUT SOME DAMN DIRT IN OUR EYES
Omg Omg omg I haven’t been the excited for a movie since End games omg omg I can’t wait!!!!
It was BOMBASTIC!
I can't wait for December! Feels like we've waited 100 yrs for this movie! With all of these Spideys and villains coming back, I'm sure that this movie will be epic!!!
I lost it when I saw the goblin bomb. I had to stop the trailer and rewind it to make sure I heard his laugh or not. Can’t wait to see what his costume will look like!
👉 Watch "The Connections (2021) [short documentary]" on youtube! Thanks! 💖
This is gonna be one of the best movies ever
Yes
I think seeing Andrew and Tobeys spidey is hoping for too much.  I just can’t see it happening
The humdrum handicap feraly talk because crib descriptively remove modulo a  flippant property. ready, green grey grieving citizenship
Its beautiful to see the og Spider-Man memes going strong
Lol watch John Cena be sandman😂
Why didn’t you catch the sign that said devil in disguise. Dr. Strange is going to turn out to be Mephisto in some scenes.
Only thing I noticed if it is Charlie Cox( Matt Murdock). He has gained weight
If they don’t have the other two spider men in the film there will be a huge up roar from fans everywhere making it the worst film that Sony has ever made. Sorry Tom it’s going to suck like you playing in uncharted in film and on the game.
That's insane, I can'r wait!!
Will Andrew and Tobey will be working with Tom
I'm really hoping in the span of 4 months cinemas in my country will be open so I can finally watch movies after 2 years
There's? Lizard jumping up from window in 2:25,  Lightning, sandstorm and something on hoverboard in right hand side of screen at 2:26. What is All that.
That guy looks to fat to be Matt Murdock
Stop comparing Michelle to Mary Jane. Two completely diffrent MJs
You're the quickest breakdown in the west.
12:32 BLACK Spiderman and Spiderman trying to avoid Electro's thunder attack.
Love your videos very informed
Loved the video!
My dad worked on infinity war and endgame
At 3:37 when you say he is going to court, they are all wearing back packs and are going to school.
gonna bring my Spider-Man suit
Just imagine Ock's face when he see's Spiderman with tentacles xD
I think the coat, blue shirt and tie worn by holland at 2.36 is same what tobey wore in spider man 3 when he went to propose marry.....can it be related somehow🙄
Amazing video❤️
i think maybe tobey return in the movie as uncle ben but i would like to see him as another spider-man
I've honestly never been more hyped for a movie- like ever...words cannot express how EXCITED I am. tysm for the breakdown, honestly missed so much and seeing all this be revealed to me is amazing.
Venom?
I guess here too.. the first villain is VENOM when Peter’s running thru his cafeteria, his suit is BLACK. Right after Strange told him to stop with the "sir" weird at 1:15sec. SINISTER SIX 🔥
i dont as a rule check you creators up but shit i feel like saying more than this about your theory kevin
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Tom who?...Don't give AF TBH!
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Oooo, perhaps non Spider-Man heroes will emerge, they better put in Squirrel Girl at some point!
So if daredevil shows up. Could we get Electra, iron fist, Luke cage and Jessica Jones?
thats a lot of timestamps
It occurs to me that the scene with what everyone thinks is the lizard would have been perfect if it was actually venom (if they were able to actually put him in) because i remember that for some reason venom didn’t trigger Peter’s spider sense, which is why he was surprised by them, idk, seemed kinda cool.
First Look. Amazing!
Hyped!
The cackling laugh can be heard with the pumpkin bomb and it's UNCANNY!!!!
Fun fact: Feeling something bad is gonna happen is called Anxiety not Spidey sense
Excited for Spider-Man!
It's likely going to be hard for some people to follow the movie with the multiverse angle.
I hope the next trailer Includes Raimi’s music😩😩
The guy you say is Murdock looks kinda overweight, so I don't think it's him
Paul you trending!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I can see Tobey being in the film but not Andrew. He has said so many things about his experience making his Spiderman films and his relationship with Sony didn't really end well, so idk why he would do it.
Tobey Maguire PLEASE
I'M JUST POINTING OUT THE FACT THAT YOU CAN SEE CHARLIE COX' BEARD WHEN HE SLAMS THE PAPERS IN FRONT OF TOM.
I’m curious to see just how many Spidey villains are going to make it into this movie.
I hope the Charlie Cox is not another Quick Silver/Ralph Bohner Meta bullsh*t casting baiting fans into thinking he's the real thing just to give the middle finger to Marvel share universe hopeful fans.
If all villains came together spiderman need help of other spiderman from other dimensions or maybe get help from venom
Matt Murdock doesn’t have a beer gut,
Really hyped for this movie. I was very skeptical about joining so many iconical characters but now I'm more than happy to see it'll be worth the waiting
The Multiverse was re(created) in Loki, Its gonna be open in No way home and  explored in Multiverse of Madness
If you have anger problems or trust issues my new song ‘b2b’ is perfect for you, lmk what you think ✨💥 a
Its gonna be strange seeing tom's peter face off outdated older villains. Not outdated in the sense that they aren't cool anymore but technologically. No longer just equipped with his quips and wits.
Pizza time
Great work on another video, cant wait to watch this on release in Imax!!!
Heavy Spoilers=🐆 New Rockstars=🐢
I hope Liz will be back in this movie
The lovely process cumulatively check because oxygen apparently gaze mid a busy pruner. voiceless, hesitant reading
I loved it, I hope the kingpin is in it too
Doc Oct was the best Raimi Spidey villian....don't get me wrong, DeFoe did a damned good job.... BUT DAMN, I loved those Doc Oct and Spidey fight scenes. Glad he is coming back WITH THE SAME ACTOR....bloody brilliant.
4:42 on the tv there is jjj
This film looks really good! I am looking forward to seeing Doc Oc !
It's not Matt Murdock, you clearly see the white shirt guy being a fat guy walking before the shot into the room. And he has a cop coffe mug.
My expectations are so high for this movie, it’s overwhelming, actually.
Won’t they have to explain how Doc Ock survived the end of his film in his universe?!
it's great that you use that thumbnail to spoil the trailer for those who didnt see it yet  lmao. When I see the movie on opening night I usually try to spoil it for marvel fans who haven't seen it because it's funny. 😂
Zendaya Is awesome. 👍😍
Doctor octopussy
Why does this guy say 'Cidy', 'Peder' etc. He can clearly say the letter 'T'.
Definitely looking forward to the second look to see what secrets will be revealed as December creeps slowly into view.
I want goblin to say oh that’s cold
I will say this now. THAT is not the real Dr. Strange. THAT is MEPHISTO. See, in One more day  comic arc , it was Mephisto who granted Parker's wish. Also, WHY THE HECK would Strange grant that self serving wish?     Clue: There is literally a poster saying "Devil in Disguise"     This is the first time you read this. You have my authorization to create a video regarding this theory as long as I get a shout out.    Stay safe yall~
Me watching the movie for the first time: Hello Peter
Who remember when doctor octopus died in the second movie because of his project failed it was sad to se a well developed character from Spider-Man 2 died that way.
Everybody's busy fighting on the bridge then Tobey falls out of nowhere saying  "my back, my back!"
how can william defoe be here when he baby sits aquaman? 😂
I loved the previous two film series of Spider-Man. When Tom came on the scene he kinda stole to role from them because he fit it so well. But If Tobey and Andrew are in this movie, it will be the ultimate declaration for me that they ALL were good at Spider-Man. I really hope that happens.
Strange is straight up Dimitri, AKA: Chameleon
I think that there is more than one Spiderman in the MCU as there are far too many inconsistencies with all Spiderman films.   Tobey Spiderman.  Out of all the Spidermen, he is the only one who doesn't use web tech as his web swinging abilities are a biological mutation from being bitten from an engineered spider.  In his reality, Norman Osborn was working on glider tech for the military.  However, due to overwhelming pressure to deliver, he took a huge risk and experimented on himself which resulted in him becoming crazy thus becoming The Green Goblin.  Harvey Osborn who was Peter's best friend wanted to get revenge on him for killing his father, thus he became the new Green Goblin.   Andrew Spiderman:  Unlike Tobey's Spiderman his love interest was Gwen Stacy rather than MJ.  It was revealed in his reality that his father had incorporated his own DNA into the engineered spiders as a means to prevent others from abusing it's power.  This is why Andrew Spiderman's abilities were able to "take."   Norman Osborn in this reality didn't become the Green Goblin, but instead died from a genetic disease (I forget what it was called).  Harry learned that this disease is hereditary and therefore desperately searched for a cure.  In his desperation he had himself injected with spider serum which didn't "take" due to incompatibility.  As a result he had suffered nasty side effects which was managed by the regenerative capabilities of the Goblin suit.  He also wanted to get revenge on peter, however his motivation for vengeance was based on the fact that Spiderman refused to give him his blood to help cure Harry.   Tom Spiderman:  In this version his romantic interest was also MJ except she is black.  Also his best friend is Ned not Harry.  And unlike the other versions of Spiderman he was the only one that met Tony Stark and became an Avenger.   Now one might assume that the films with Tobey and Andrew are not canon and therefore can be ignored.  I don't believe however that is the case as the concept of the multiverse was deliberately mention in this trailer.  We know from the previous films that most of the villains had died and yet somehow that have returned. Therefore I believe that all the villains were from the alternate realities from the previous films.  If this is the case, then that begs the question:  When in the timeline did the villains get brought to Tom Spiderman's reality?  If any of the villains were fighting with the alternate Spidermen when they were transported to a different reality, then it is likely Tobey and Andrew Spiderman would also have been sucked into Tom Spiderman's reality.  Which I think it is necessary for the story as I think that despite Tom Spiderman having an advance Spider suit, he would get his butt whooped pretty bad without assistance.  Yes I know there is also Dr Strange, but even then it might not be enough. So in conclusion, I think that each of the previous films were alternate versions of Spiderman and that there is a good chance that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield will make an appearance to help fight against the combined formidable strength of their adversaries.
My theory is that all new villans here are Peter's future villans who just entered into present by strange's spell cast and want peter to die in past itself so they team together as sinisters.
Its not Matt Murdock at the police station, you see the guy in the white shirt walk into the interrogation room in another shot and he is someone else.
Man, I can’t wait for the official, full trailer!
I honestly have very little faith in this movie. They are cramming a ton of things into this and  one more day was the least liked storyline since the clone stuff. Also, Strange’s motivation to do this is thin at best.
I hope this movie is as good as it appears to be.
Doc Ock looks like Bob Dylan.
Omg Mephisto confirmed 😂😂😂😂!!
If Andrew and Tobey don't show up in this movie I will be very disappointed
Yeah but Matt didn't have a gut
Your spoiler teaser video was spot on!
Besides seeing Tom Holland, I cant wait to see Zendaya sexy self!
Trending insane
Amazing!!
tva: this was supossed to happen
Spiderman endgame
you need help
2:42 It's not charlie cox. Have you tried to look at his tummy, our daredevil is not fat. One more thing if Matt Murdock was in the room he'd already know peter is innocent, you know like spidey sense matt also has that kind of sense
Okay they make so many Spider-Man movies  I stopped watching after the first 3 lol
Just watched the video sh t
If this is a Sinister Six Multiverse Brawl, then Volture has to be in it. This will Make Micheal Keaton as the First ever actor to play a Hero and a Villain in Two Different Multiverse Universe Simultaneously
Also if u just look up No Way Home it says Jamie foxx as electro so they didn’t do a good job at that
I bet peter stole the box so MJ,Ned,And Aunt May and some ppl would remember him?
Paul's quips are simply hilarious. "A.K.A Spoilerman" hahahaha
Time to unsub boys.. Heavy Spoilers is too mainstream now  :P
We are in for a wild ride Folks
Dr. Strange is acting... Strange
Paul…do you see how fat that dude with the white shirt and tie is??? That is not Charlie Cox 🤣🤣🤣
I predict *Bully Maguire* in this movie *after release*
You totally missed that doctor strange got his eye of agamotto back
I don't think d place is snowy bcoz of what Bruce did that would mean rain enters too
And ppl think Wanda can beat strange,so funny
mid
"Hello Peter"  'Who Are you.  He's talking to me   So introduce Tobey
Flash: Spider-Man is amazing. Also flash: Peter Parker sucks. Flash when he realizes Peter Parker is Spider-Man:Shi-
Tysm for getting this video out so quickly!!
You missed this Easter Egg: J. Jonah Jamieson facially on video screens looks like the late Mean Gene Okerlund. Okerlund was a commentator during the WWF heyday of the Macho Man.
Sorry, Matt Murdoch doesn't have love handles and a gut like the guy slamming the paper work down
no, too soon
Nice
Lizard? I thought it was Venom! when I see the trailer
back ground music bussin
I really hope they don't have this be what opens the Multiverse. Don't take that from Loki.
#2 on trending man. Good job. Well deserved
Has no body noticed how venom is next to sand man in the bottom left look in slow mo he is there (Tobey ?)
When you said We do know Charlie Cox is in the movie, how do we know that? I've had a bit of a search around and cannot find anything concrete.
Oh god this is going to be so good
Fucking awesome vid.
I’m waiting to see how they combine so many aspects of the Spider-Man franchise into one movie.
didn't anyone notice that Peter's leg was in the shape of a 4? Fantastic 4! Doesn't anyone remember that the Avengers Tower was sold? Wasn't spidey join the fantastic 4? Come on people, it's in Revelations people!!!!
Who is the girl on “Matt murdocks” coffee cup?
I really hope that is Charley Cox, would be the best part of the movie, aside from if Bully MaGuire somehow showed up
It's not Matt Murdock, look at his Thor Belly!
When I first saw the sanctum and it was all white I thought it was incomplete effects. I only realized it was ice after watching a breakdown of the trailer.
I want to see sand man in that movie and the son of green goblin
You're.mate is right, no way that man is built like Charlie Cox.
I hope Tom Hollands Spiderman  is ready because Doc Oc and Green Goblin  throw straight  Handz
Alex Jones is the best journalist of our time.
Spidy vs sinister 6 best thing will happened
#2 on trending, nice work mate! 😎💪
It's also been like 8 months, maybe 9 by the time Peter goes to the sanctum, since the end of Endgame. So I would assume there is a different reason everything is frozen
They better do the spiderman pointing at himself meme
Aunt May is actually mafisto in the police scene.  He took over her body.  That is my guess if I am right I sure would love to win anything.  A sticker would be cool! Lol can’t wAit for this movie. Looks like it is going to be off the hook.  Thank you for your reviews as allways.  Peace ✌️
The guy win the interrogation room is way too fat to be Charlie cox daredevil
I literally got the spider man far from home trailer as an ad in this vid
spider mans new black suit might be wakandas vy braniam
They gonna bring venom?
Need more doc oc lol
After this watch Saber City II, you won’t regret it!!
Thank you for telling me what the spider man three is going to be like and I am not being sarcastic because I am not like other people
So hyped to get Matt Murdock revealed. Because that means Frank Castle isn’t far behind!
Found something! The scene where someone said be careful what you wish for parked kinda sounds like the original lizard in amazing spider man 1
Tobey and Ned die
Bring Jon Bernthal as punisher
Guy slamming down the files in the police station is definitely not Charlie Cox/Matt Murdock - too tall and too thick around the middle.
wanda vision had a heart on august 23rd in their calendar  😩 they knew
stop saying "bruh". cringe
the woman at the end is actually mjs mom the actor confirmed it at the black widow premiere
I will legit cry is Tobey comes out ! Literally my childhood and it’s been a shitty ass year . We deserve Tobey & Andrew😭
@Heavy Spoilers  i like to comment  on your videos just to  help you pay the rent
So excited for this movie to come out! But now that we have we'll have a Norman Osborne in the MCU, does that mean we could eventually see the Dark Avengers? That would also be exciting to see!
this movie is gonna be awesome
14:43 bro that is liz from homecoming
When Toby and Andrew come out is going to be wild !
Where is doctor strange's cape in the train scene?🤔
I love how this is trending right behind the actual trailer itself.
So who is the momma spider 🕷️🕸️who gave birth to these 3 famous spider men???lol😅        and oh yeah not to forget, they still have about 3000 other siblings🙂
I want to see a "True Goblin"! Purple Hood and tunnic.
Interestingly enough though, it's actually coming out Dec 17th, per trailers 🤯🤯 lol
I can't fucking wait bro holy shittttttt
I got so hyped when I saw Doctor octopus doctor green goblin  And all the other villains This  is going to be awesome!  Btw keep  the great content 👍🏻
WHERE       WERE       YOU         WHEN       REPUBLICONS      DESTROYED      THE      WORLD     ???
unless vaccine free! otherwise no one want that god damn it risks vaccine!
Omg so excited for this movie
2 on trending let’s gooo right beneath the actual trailer lol
The way Pete is laying down make a 4 with his legs. Fan 4 maybe or Sam Raimi 4th Spidey film 🎥
2 million views at #2 trending!
Awesome commentary on the multiverse!!!
I'm crazy excited! The movie looks like it's going to blow all our expectations out of the water
Congrats on trending so high! Glad you could swing your way all the way to #2🕷
Love this channel and the trailer thx for the vid
Funny enough Alex Jones was right about like 99% of the shit, just like JJJ
looks sick
Hyped
Murdoch looks way too fat bro
After the theater version i hope Snyder's cut is released where he shows Doctor octopus looking a Tobey when he says hey peter
What if Strange is Mephisto?
...  . I encourage you to accept Jesus CHRIST Yeshua as your LORD and SAVIOR TODAY
Marvel is overrated, gimmie John Wick 4 and The Matrix 4 instead.
The pumpkin bomb could be Ned's rumored hobgoblin
Good stuff!
What if the Chameleon is posing as dr strange and is the Sixth baddie!
Let Jesus Christ into your heart pls
I Am The Biggest Fan Of The original Movie And Can’t Wait To See This✨
Ya I think Wanda will be the villain for the first half of the next doctor strange movie but she'll turn around and help the doctor win in the end. Good video again!
Hope Marvel remembered Nicholas Hammond.
Look If you had One shot Or one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted In one moment Would you capture it Or just let it slip? BUY AND HODL AMC STOCK.!!
Air Jordan 1's in the rooftop scene like miles morales
This movie is looking awesome
Damn. 2 million views already! Go on an uninterrupted vacation!!
Was Strange using the rings from Shang Chi? 6:48 in footage from Avengers.
Lets see if vulture and Mysterio Will return, or even i dare not say... Venom... Or the Andrew Garfield goblin beeing killed by Dafoe, there can ONLY be One. . If vulture and mysterio are in the movie then se could be leading witha sinester Seven or even Sinister eight if we count Rhino. . There is also the Change That doc of isnt a villain and gets killed by the goblin like at the in the ultimate universe when the goblin kill doc oc for not wanting to kill Peter.
Green Goblin, Doc Ock, possibly Sandman and Electro, my goodness throw in Maguire and Garfield and this would have the potential to out-hype Endgame. 🔥🔥🔥
Who else wants to see Flash Thompson as Agent Venom?
I honestly prefer NOT to bring back that One More Day comic plotline.

The peter Parker joke was pretty good and definitely deserves at least a few likes.
Charlie Cox put on some weight
I'm not convinced it's Willem Defoe.  The laugh sounds like him, but there's alot of actors who can cackle like that.
It's going to be epic
15:56 actual trailer came as an add
If the villains are another illusion of Mysterio then I swear to God...
But Mastero Is still alive

Great breakdown!! I'm so excited for this movie
What if doc octopus becomes superior Spider-Man?
When the sand bursts up to hit the lightning, in the bottom right corner you can see Peter's new black and gold suit.
spider man
ill watch this only if tobey is in it
The Lizard was from the first Amazing Spider-Man not the second
I can promise you that guy is not Matt Murdock, dudes stomach is poking out, definitely not Charlie Cox
Same trash
What I imagine probably happened was, when Doctor Strange cast the spell that made it so Peter's identity as Spider-Man were never revealed, he accidentally made it so no Spider-Man's identities were ever revealed across the multiverse.  That means, in the first two movies when Toby Maguire fought Green Goblin and Doc Ock, they never learned he was Peter Parker. This would dramatically change Green Goblin's final fight and Doc Ock would never have been redeemed at the end of his final fight.
The exciting exclusive dungeon unequivocally blot because basket intriguingly love past a poor elephant. cynical, handsome property
I hope they bring back bonesaw, in some sort of way so the memes will come back tenfold again.
I'm not going to get too excited because it's not officially that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield is in the movie so I don't want to get my feelings hurt so I'm just going to be excited nothing more you know unless something happens
If Witch fought Strange, Strange is wiping the floor with her
that cant be Matt Murdock slamming that papers on the desk...look at that GUT!!! Daredevil does not have a gut like that....
bro trending
Dude, bro. A cool mill views. Wow! Yep I'm stoked for this too but I agree, it's Murdock. It's just that Daredevil has a gut in this film, then. Ha, ha
This is so confusing but I love it
Highly doubt the hole is still in the roof. It's obviously the master of the mystic arts just decorating the place?
i hate everybody bc they hate what others are hating only bc others are hating it bc the others hate what they don't hate
I cannot understand shit with your accent, I’ll go watch another breakdown video
I would love if they give Tom’s Peter a visit from either his parents or Uncle Ben. It could be an extra push he needs to do the right thing
Someone said it was actually venom in the doctor strange prison and not the lizard XD
We all know if the other spider-man are in the movie it be the moment that Tom getting beaten and then has doc goes in for a killer blow you see a Web grab that arm and just here "surprise doc". and it be the other 2 spidey
I thought Jamie Foxx's MCU Electro is a completely different character from the Amazing Spider-Man Electro?
Damn!!! 🔥
Littery every character comes exept toby and andrew
What if Strange gives him the present at the end that shows him uncle Ben but we see him have a conversation with Tony?!
The movie will be the best
I’m wondering why someone like Strange would agree to cast that spell and it makes me wonder what his motive was.
Thanks
one thing i did notice during the trailer was a blink and you miss it moment where i swear i saw peter wearing venom
Who’s at 11:06 ???? I forgot
I'm literally crying  thinking  I'm gonna see Tobey as Spiderman again😭😭😭 waiting for this moment for long time
To Heavy Spoilers' Mate: SHUT THE HELL UP!
The timestamps are a bit off
government Google Facebook Twitter told u vaccine news of cause not truth!  they didn't tell u vaccine risks!  and they're business man!  one vaccine costs 10 dollars! more people need vaccine which means more dollars!
Too big of mid section for Matt Murdock aka  love handles
Spiderman 3: GOATS COME HOME.
As long as they show electro with his dubstep theme.
I got the trailer as an ad for this video 😩😩😩
That black suit wasnt venom?
Great video! Thanx
Peter is also wearing Jordan 1’s on the roof top scene, maybe a ode to Morales’ Spiderverse Spidey who also wears the same shoes but in red
I saw the thumbnail with the question mark. I guess you haven’t heard the rumors
The geain of salt part, when you said that Peter get a box item from strange, and the chase scene. It seems there are some parts that is missing on the vfx like the box on his hands.
I wonder if tony is going to come back
i love how we "missed" all these.
Venom joins the fight
I believe there being very particular with their villains for the Sinister six  2 Toby villains (Doc oc and Goblin)  2 Andrew Villains (Electro and lizard)  Both of which were the main villains of their movies. So probably 2 Tom Villains of the main movies. Vulture and mysterio/scorpion  These are the villains that we know are confirmed (not Tom, the others)  So it makes guessing the other member a bit easier
This was great!
Dr. Octopus- I heard someone completed my goal in making a Reactor in a Cave, with a box of scrap.
I dont like it. Peter is very annoying and i can't stand annoying super pricks
You know earlier there was a sign that says devil in disguise,  so mephisto could just be strange in disguise. So there is still that possibility of him being in the movie.
Aunt may getting shot in the comics also led to one of the greatest ass whippings in comic book history
congrats on 45 on trending
Cops showed up when peter & aunt may were sitting on the couch..u can see police lights behind them in the window..they must've kicked the door in..tell me if im right this Christmas.
Hes still in high-school?  Jesus
It looks awesome
It's not Matt Murdock.
Sponder. Man.
How do we KNOW that Charlie Cox will be in the movie?  I've only seen rumors
i dont think you are correct on the 6 months part because mj would be they type to have those lights because why not
Tobey: did he fix the damn door?  Tom: what door?
Imagine going to high school even though everyone knows you’re Spider-Man
Dr Strange is Misterio messing with Peter
I wanna see jock flash beat up nerdy flash
Matt Murdock & Hobgoblin would be cool
If that really is the lizard, that’s one of Narcels best kept secrets, cause no one was talking about him
So are the villains alternate variants of themselves?
I think that’s foggy Nelson and not Matt, he looks too chubby for Charlie cox
Hey Paul’s mate, shut up you’re wrong pal

hello peter
Definitely so excited for this!! So much potential, I just really hope they don’t mess this up!
I think it’s possible that this Doc. Ock could be from another universe where Tom Holland’s Spider-Man is his enemy. This could be the reason Doc. Ock recognizes him. (If that’s what’s happening.) Same for green goblin and so on. I think this will be the case if they don’t include the other spider men.
4:53 Batman vs. Covid
Curious if Strange will be wearing those Adidas f**k boy pants with that hoodie... Its what I'm honestly looking forward to seeing. 🤣
Has nobody noticed Dr strange is wearing the eye of agamendmo which means is the time stone back
August is now officially the best! Can't wait!
Those most likely aren’t Christmas lights.. thats just an extremely common way kids today decorate their rooms..
Look like a great movie. Can't wait for it!!
Daredevil: "Be careful what you wish for, Parker" Fans: "I get those Goosebumps everytime"
I have a question do yall know if those are the hyper crimson 1s or shadows that parker is wearing
thanks!
Now they just need to add Mary Jane from 616 and all the Spider-Man can stop what they are doing and go woah.
If somehow tobey and Andrew (i believe they are) aren’t in it then they have to have miles in it…even a post credits scene.
Thats not Matt Murdock that dude has a spare tire
People seem to forget that 6 months ago Evan Peters showed up and the internet said “XMEN IN MCU CONFIRMED” let’s relax people! Kevin Feige likes his misdirects, just saying!
Idk man the “be careful what you wish for” line could be a mephisto tease his voice sounds distorted and menacing
So excited for December now! If Tobey and Andrew aren’t in it, it’ll be disappointing, but still think it’ll be amazing, especially with the villains from the different universes, and a possible introduction of Miles Morales! Bring on December!!
Charlie Cox was rumored to be in the movie but was never confirmed. You shouldn’t pass it off as fact
You are so desperate for money it’s hilarious
Marvel trailers are just used to keep the fans wanting more. So with that being said this can be really good or very basic and disappointing. Just like endgame. Infinity war was top tier. Then the hype for endgame was so great that it was disappointing
There’s no way it’s Charlie Cox he has a gut.
It does feel a bit cheap that Peters complains during the spell is what caused the Multiverse..
The zany notify worryingly steer because skate fifthly ignore past a gorgeous coin. ultra, cloistered dinner
i hope they give us a bully McGuire reference where tobey saves tom in a black suit confidently
You will know when tobey and Andrew are in it when YOU FIX THIS DAM DOOR
That person he and aunt may be looking at is nick fury
Looks good
My prediction if they do the gold scroll at the end, tobey maguire will get uncle Ben, Andrew Garfield will see Gwen and Holland will bring back Robert Downey jr and it’s going to be so hard to watch
no the daily bugle WAS a newspaper in the mcu, it just transitioned to "new media" because newspapers are dead, they mentioned something about that in either the first or second spiderman mcu movie, jameson sold the failing newspaper division to robbie (the nice guy who helps peter out when he first got hired, black guy, grey hair.) and used the money tostart the "new ,media" division of the bugle, which he hosts, and acts kinda like alex jones, if i remember correctly, like it was just a "throwaway line" so i get why you dont remember it, i honestly think they did it just to make the games make sense, as in them, robbie runs the paper, and jameson runs a podcast v similar to an alex jones show.
You can see mad mordocks face in the reflection in the window if you lock close at 2:58
“Pennsylvania station” 🤣
Has anyone else noticed that in episode 1 of Wandavision, the date on the calendar with the black heart is August 23rd?  Coincidence?  I think not...:)
Can we just acknowledge how awesome and sad this situation is. It’s awesome because we get to see the previous Spidermen and villains return. It’s sad because Sony/Disney couldn’t keep audiences interested in their Tom Holland Spiderman so they brought back the old Spidermen in order to make a profit that has potential to be as big as End Game.
Is this Tom Holland last Spider-Man movie in the mcu?
i dont believe thats lizard. from my perspective i can see the tail is a bit longer and it seems to be glowing so i think that might actually be scorpion
I reckon the Dr Strange we see is in fact a variant. As throughout the trailer Strange flicks from using his left hand to his right.  The Spider-Man costumes you see are two variants of Tom and not Andrew nor Toby. Total of three Toms.
at 45 seconds into the trailer you missed the subtle hint in the shot towards Andrew's spiderman 1 where he's on the bridge changing to fight the lizard and tobey's spiderman 1 where he holds up the cable car while fighting green goblin. there are loads of very subtle hints towards andrew and tobey making a return. not sure how miles morales will be portrayed (if at all) as he has only been a cartoon character so far but other than that this film will be sick! Spiderman has and always will be the character that makes me love Marvel (along with Iron Man 1). Great content. CANT WAIT TIL DECEMBER
Crazy!!! Thanks so much for this... mind blown
Did I instantly search for this video the moment I broke for lunch? You bet your sweet ass I did! ... I should probably, actually, eat lunch now.
now i personally find this movie way too confusing and kind of not too sure about it, but i’m sure lots of people will love it
If Mr. Ditkovich shows up and says "Reeeennt!" I'll lose my sh*t.
there's no way tom holland(spider man) fight all that villain i bet toby and andrew will help him..
I can't wait for the day Mephisto is actually confirmed. One day Paul, it'll happen. One day.
Can't wait for Marvel Studios Spider Man No way Home 😩
No Bonesaw, No Big Wheel = Shit Trailer 0/10
I think Dr Oc is talking to Tobey.. He only recognize Peter (Tobey)
❤️
Came here just to dislike. Change your thumbnail
!!!!
I need everybody to read this comment, I am from 2023 and this movie still hasn't been released..
that was an excellent explanation. I learned more through this video I really didn't catch. Mainly villains.
Number2 trending 🔥🔥
whats crazy is that this was the TEASER trailer. just imagine what the official full trailer will be like.
I mean far from home felt so short ago lmao
😂 the Norman Osborne meme was sus
I personally hope tobey and Andrew don’t show up and the villains are from earths that killed their spider man
Hey so excited for this movie!
In other words, the multiverse here has nothing to do with Loki or wandavision... got it
Doctor strange is mephisto in disguise! I just figured it out, think about it, the sign saying devil in disguise is probably strange trying to warn peter plus strange has the necklace on that was destroyed and he casted the spell after Wong told him not to
Mephisto is Dr. Strange in this movie, WandaVision alludes it and Loki lowkey confirms it
2% I don't think it's Charlie Cox because of the belly and love handles 🙂
Heavy Spoilers reaching #2 on trending?!  You've reached GRANDER heights my friend!! Congratulations man.
Who else Got goosebumps when Green goblin and Doc Oc showed up.
Regarding the part where Doctor Strange casts the spell, I’ve always speculated that when Captain America (“Cap” for short) went back to return the stones in the _Endgame_ epilogue, his first stop was to 2012 where he got the Ancient One to cast a similar spell using the six stones in the briefcase to undo the wayward events where Loki escaped.  The stones were also possibly used simultaneously to cast a delayed-reaction spell so that, in 2014, reality would automatically rewrite itself right after Thanos, Nebula, and Gamora travelled forward to 2023 so that newly created/restored versions of these original 2014-characters would then appear and continue about their business with no memory of the previous wayward events.  This, by the way, would also explain why 2023-Nebula did not fade out of existence after she killed her 2014-counterpart.  It’s because she was a replacement copy (a “Nebula 2.0” if you will) that was created by the stones and was therefore now an independent and completely separate entity from the original.  Support for this theory comes from two observations:  First, the six stones in the briefcase were arranged in such a way that the yellow stone, which is the Mind Stone, was right in the center and was in a larger hole than the other stones which surrounded it.  This is very significant when remembering how the gauntlets worn by Thanos, Hulk, and Stark all had the Mind Stone in the center of the hand while the other stones were placed in the finger-slots.  This was done so that the power of the Mind Stone could branch out to the others and combine their respective powers all at once.  Ergo, the fact that the stones were also specifically arranged this way in the briefcase very strongly indicates that Cap did indeed intend to have their powers combined again in the past to undo and erase the wayward events of 2012 and 2014.  The second supporting observation comes from the scene where Hulk was about to reverse the original Snap and was first instructed by Stark to just bring back those who were dusted but not to change anything else from the past five years.  From those latter words, we clearly see that the Infinity Stones could indeed have been used to alter or “correct” the proper flow of history.  As for how Cap returned the stones without also returning the Tesseract to hold the Space Stone or the Scepter to hold the Mind Stone or the Orb to hold the Power Stone, my theory/solution is that the repaired stone-holding objects had actually been shrunken down beforehand, just like Rocket’s spaceship had been shrunken earlier in the film, so that Cap could simply carry them in his pockets along with the extra particles and then have them re-enlarged later when needed.  As for the briefcase that Tony Stark stole in 1970 to carry the Tesseract in Doctor Strange may have magically altered it beforehand so it could properly hold the six stones in the way they were shown onscreen.  The briefcase would then likewise be reverted back to its original form at the later designated time.  So now, with the above background information in mind, here are my step-by-step thoughts on how Cap returned all the stolen objects and clipped “ALL the branches” just like he said he would:  First stop was to 2012 where he got the Ancient One to rewrite reality in such a way that reflected how everything would otherwise have been if his earlier self never arrived with Stark, Hulk, and Lang to mess with events in the first place.  This resulted in a “corrected” timeline going forward wherein a newly created/restored version of Loki’s original self, who had no memory of his escape, remained in custody with the Tesseract while his fugitive variant version would have since been captured and whisked away by the Time Variance Authority as per the _Loki_ spinoff series.  Using the stones to rewrite history and reality would also then have erased the memories of all the other characters who were native to 2012 so that Stark no longer remembered his heart attack and Thor no longer remembered fixing it, while the Hydra goons no longer remembered giving away the scepter, and Cap’s younger-self no longer remembered fighting his future-self.  (Any damage done during that fight would also have been reversed and fixed).  Just prior to having the Ancient One rewrite reality, Cap also had the shrunken scepter re-enlarged so that, during the rewrite, it could automatically be transported back into the hands of the mind-wiped Hydra goons with the Mind Stone now back inside.  With the branch reality of 2012 averted (or rather “erased” or “clipped”), the Ancient One then reclaimed possession of the Time Stone and used it to transport Cap forward in time to 2013 where she took him to Asgard to return Thor’s hammer and inject the Aether/Reality Stone back into Jane Foster’s body.  There, the Ancient One used the Time Stone to reverse/erase Jane’s memories immediately after Cap injected the Aether back into her body so she would no longer remember having it extracted in the first place.  Likewise, the Time Stone was then used to reverse/erase the motions and memories of the guards who chased Rocket so that he could safely escape from them.  (Notice that they never did catch up with him and were not heard from again after he reunited with Thor).  After this, the Ancient One quickly teleported Cap to the spot where the earlier version of Thor’s hammer was located, so that after future-Thor summoned it away, Cap could then instantly put the latter version back in its place.    With a branch-reality successfully averted in 2013, the Ancient One then used the Time Stone once again to send Cap forward to 2014 where she took him to Morag to put the re-enlarged the Orb containing the Power Stones back in the temple right after Rhodes departed with it and Nebula was captured.  Meanwhile, the Ancient One used the Time Stone to rewind Peter Quill’s memories and motions, along with his Walkman, so that he no longer remembered being knocked out and robbed, but continued dancing toward the temple so that the events of the first _Guardians of the Galaxy_ movie would continue just as before.  Cap’s next stop was to Vormir where he returned the Soul Stone, thereby forcing the Red Skull to remain as its guardian – or at least until Thanos would show up again in 2018.  Despite being forced to remain on the barren planet, the Red Skull nevertheless laughed as he taunted Cap for not being able to get a soul-refund and return Romanoff home.  The last phase of Cap’s stone-returning mission was to now go backward in time to 1970 and return the re-enlarged Tesseract containing the Space Stone along with the borrowed briefcase and replacement vials of Pym Particles.  On this trip back to the past, the Ancient One also accompanied Cap by merging the Time Stone’s power with Cap’s quantum jumpsuit.    Arriving in the base’s underground vault right before Tony Stark arrived, the duo secretly watched as he swiped the briefcase and then sliced open the safe to extract the Tesseract before meeting and departing with his father Howard.  After the father and son were gone, the Ancient One used the Time Stone to undo the damage that was done to the safe so that Cap could put the Tesseract back without anyone ever knowing it had been borrowed in the first place.  (Note: Using the Time Stone to reverse the damage to the safe is similar to when Thanos used it in _Infinity Wars_ to reverse the destruction of the Mind Stone).  Next, the borrowed briefcase, which had since been transformed back from its 2023-shape for containing the stones to its original 1970-shape for holding the Tesseract, was then returned to the spot where Tony originally grabbed it.  And lastly of course, the four vials of replenished Pym Particles were then returned back to the lab where Cap’s earlier-self had swiped them.   With all the borrowed items and wayward characters from the past returned to their proper place in the timeline, Cap and the Ancient One finally went their separate ways.  Namely, she used the Time Stone one final time to return to 2014 while Cap traveled further backward in time to around 1946 where he finally reunited with Peggy Carter and lived happily ever after.    Agree with my thoughts?  Disagree.  Let me know.
This was SUPER FUN!!!! I loved the trailer and your take on it.
What a Challenge Tom and Dr Strange Have.  Green Goblin  Doc Oc Electro Sandman  Lizard  And Hopefully Mysterio Or Rhino It will be Hard to take them all on. I hope Tom is struggling then out of knowhere come Toby and Andrew to help
2 Villians From EACH UNIVERSE~!!!! to make the Sinister Six~! It works so well it's almost as if they actually planned it from the start!! Rami-Spidey-verse: Green Goblin Doctor Octopus Webb-Spidey-verse: The Lizard Electro Watts-Spidey-verse Vulture Scorpion (or Mysterio?)
Damn i want to see flash reaction soooooo bad
If they do bring in Toby, leave Andrew out. Recast every part of any Andrew Garfield universe. Don't ruin it.
looks like dr strange makes a tiny fusion reactor like dr octavius made in spider man 1 lol
IDK where people get this idea that MCU's rendition of Flash hated Peter. He was just kind of a douche.
If Mary Jane is back, this would be 👌
the multiverse is here
that dudes stomach is too chunky to be matt murdock
I’m excited seeing Tobey Maguire! I was only 8yo when I saw him play as Spider Man in ‘02 so to bring him back, the nostalgia is hitting hard! 😩😅 definitely gon be like  🎥 🤓🍿
Congratulations on top 3 trending!
MJ and Peter probably use Flash's place as a safehouse for a while. Flash's parents seem permanently elsewhere anyway. They seemed to be setting it up at the end of FFH.
I really got a ad of the Spider-Man trailer in this video of the breakdown
The “Give me Rent guy” is going to be the main villain in the end of the movie 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nice...
The Itsy Bitsy Spider went up the waterspout down came Electro and shock the spider out. Out came the goblin to turn him into a stain. And the itsy bitsy spider is about to lose MJ.
I don’t think that’s Matt Murdock. Unless he’s been doing nothing but eating devil dogs for the last few years.
Fun fact. One of my friends is in the crowd shot of Peter going to school!
3:50 “And what looks like Flash” Am I the only one who’s totally not seeing it?
13:27, lol
who is your favorite spiderman actor ?
I loved everything about this trailer and this video breaking it down made it even better.
Glad I'm not the only one who thinks Doc Ock looks like Elton John😂
Wonder if they paid the Magicians for the use of the Tutting :)
Did you see pieter in the black suit or is that just me?
Heavy Spoilers literally the only YouTube channel so far to state that the snow is from the obvious hole in the roof💯. I really strted thinking that the other channels where idiots
the spiderman hypnosis joke could also be a reference to that time in the comics where he and another woman that was given spider powers by the same means end up having "relations" for no other reason than because their spider mutation makes them be attracted to each othee
I hope they don't show Tobey and Andrew in any trailers!
i love on how on the roof scene he is wearing a black shirt and black pants and if u believe hard enough it looks like hes wearing the black symbiote suit from spiderman 3
Someone said you were a battle rapper on Twitter…is that true @Heavy Spoilers ?
Super excited for this movie!! I can't wait to see what happens.
MEPHISTO IS CONFIRMED
Now imagine Tom, Andrew and Tobey fighting together against the Sinister six!!!
The anxious sushi formerly suit because gray thankfully moan apropos a redundant gender. jealous, half triangle
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
My only concern is that when you introduce so many past villains, that makes them nearly impossible to implement or recreate in potential future MCU installments of Spiderman. Like yeah everyone is excited for the cameos of Dok Oct and Goblin, but I want to see the MCU's versions of the characters and how they fit into Tom Holland's Spiderman's world.
Memphisto posing as strange?
Doctor Strange with the Multiple trains could be to protect peter from falling or From a Potential Ariel threat such as Green Goblin
I’m so fucking hype now
hype.
Sorry I'm late I had to beat an old lady with a stick for this trailer
I Always thought that wong survived the snap because in the lead up to endgame they dropped posters for all the characters who got snapped and the ones who didn't and Wong's poster showed that he survived the snap
What if it’s Scorpion instead of the Lizard, he was teased at the end of Spider-Man Homecoming
I ship out to bootcamp on december 6 i hope i get the chance to watch it before i go
The only person to do a break down faster than Paul is me at a family wedding with an open bar.
MY GUY IS #2 ON TRENDING
The plot COULD be good but... the direction sucks and everything looks fake.
I know it's unlikely, but imagine Sony or Marvel purposely leaking Maguire and Garfield in order to distract us from a Miles Morales debut
been fan of spiderman since childhood, very very excited
2:13 Guy who has only ever seen John Wick 3 watching their second movie: Getting a lot of John Wick 3 vibes from this.
So the Spider-Man no way home trailer Leaked It was rumored to have played at cinemacon tomorrow. Now Marvel and Sony are panicking because it got believed     IA • Sun, 11:42 PM
The fucking ad on this video was the No Way Home trailer
ok just a thought what if strange brings back tony instead of uncle ben
WONG FIGHTS ABOMINATION TF?!!!
On the train is an evil Dr. Strange chasing Peter.
If Andrew and Tobey actually show up in this movie, It might beat Endgame.
I wanna see him become venom 👿
So hyped to see willem dafoe will be in the film. He’s one of my favorite villians
Strange makes everyone forget spider-man... Doc.. Hello peter...
"Miles Morales' mom" could easily be MJ's mom.
I am sure that this was not Matt Murdock. At minute 6:02 you can see 2 persons enter the interrogation room and one of them wears a white shirt and a tie and MOST DEFINITELY looks nothing like Matt, apart from his clothes. Sorry Paul :/
The second I saw someone dropping files aggressively to the table, I knew it was indeed, Matthew Murdock.
I'm super hyped for this!
I want this to be 3 hours long and after this we get a Raimi Spider-Man 4 and Amazing Spider-Man 3
Dr. Strange would never do that spell knowing what damage it could cause. And then blame Peter for it…something isn’t right.
One thing that could be really interesting here as a result of multiverse shenanigans is that the villains' motivations/back stories could also change; characters that are pulled from other universes could be more in line with their comic book storyline (e.g. Mysterio wasn't originally an Iron Man villain). The fact that they've confirmed the multiverse opening leads me to believe that Sinister Six is likely to happen, let's gooooo!
My life would be complete if we see tobby in this movie 🙏🏿
I get confused about times and timelines. Is he still a minor at this point? If not, then I assume he's entitled to a lawyer. If he's smart (wait, he's supposed to be smart; that's why Mr. Stark headhunted him for Stark Industries), he'll keep his mouth shut until he talks to his lawyer.
It's not lizard it's Tom Hardy's venom
That was fast
There's no way that one second shot of a lawyer is Matt Murdock, that guy has some curves while Charlie Cox is SHREDDED.
Love the video keep it up🦾
#2 ON TRENDING
I’m calling it right now, Miles Morales in post credits scene
In Spiderverse all the characters that came from different universes "glitched out" throughout the movie due to not being in their own universe. Obviously Spiderverse is separate from the MCU but I wonder if the characters in this movie will face similar problems. Also, why wouldn't SHIELD just have a Skrull agent shift into to Peter then have the real Peter swing by as Spiderman? I guess that would be too easy of a solution... or just too hard for Marvel to make a decent movie out of it.
I can’t wait for movie
I already know I’m going to be crying like a baby if the uncle Ben part happens in the movie
Just FYI some of the time stamps are completely random, and do not relate to the current topic at all
5:05     Ok That looks way too much like Paul Rudd
Well I want win
Doc Ock coming back is the most exciting thing to me and my dream. Ever since Spider-Man 2 I wanted to see this character in a movie again but would have never thought it would be the same actor again 🤩
you remind me of korg
No way the ice is from a hole in the roof. The stairs are fixed. Peter is wearing a flannel, MJ is wearing a light sweater. If it was winter in NY, enough for that kind of snow, they would be bundled up like Strange is. Also, if you look behind Peter when he is entering, it is not snowing outside. The sun is out and the ground is dry.
HOLY SHIT PAUL YOURE TRENDING AT #2!!!!!
Awesome! Can’t wait!
woah #2 on trending, damn
I hope Otto and all the other returning characters from the multiverse are real and not another damn illusion from Mysterio if he’s possibly still alive (Not beck but Mysterio)
I’m SOOOO HYPE FOR THIS
Banger
Why would only villains come into this reality? They wouldn't.    THEORY I suggest we will be shown multiple MJs, Neds, Aunt Mays, Spidermans, Dr. Stanges, Jonah Jamesons, Captain Marvels, Tony Starks, and Happys. ***Why? Because the broken spell cast, altered the spell to bring everyone who knows Spiderman's secret identity into one reality.*** Thus, a mess.  If identity is the underlying theme, then this will be a great setting for such a thing.  Also, Wanda is likely our Mephisto in this MCU. She will likely be the one who breaks the spell cast by Strange, she will likely get the chance to show some muscle, and destroy the alternate Strange(s). This might set up the revolving antagonist of Multiverse of Madness, seeing the Strange as the baddie, because he is a number of variants of himself. As we have seen glimpses of this in the trailer for What If...?.
3:43 sarcasm
I graduated high school the same year Spiderman 2 came out, I feel so old now lol
Me and No Way Home ... we're gonna have a HELL of a time!
I love Peter’s outfits, and how he consistently wears Nike throughout the films.
What about Electro? 😏
Don’t curse
Hi I subscribed and turned on notifications!
Literally can’t wait for this movie!!
Guy is too fat to be Murdock. It is obv a detective.
Wait, the original Dr. Octopus actor is still alive? Or is it some one else?
I, too, am also solid as fuck.   *sniff*
Imagine for the gift scene peter gets to talk to tony
1:12 Flash is blond now???
Mephisto confirmed😂🤣
The goosebumps i get after seeing the trailer  😍
So maybe the spidermen like andrew may not be in it but hes going into thier world and so doc ock dousnt know him but the other peter
people reacted to iron man very positively
So hyped for this
Their arcs differ slightly? 🤔 So there could be no Tobey or Andrew because these could be alternate versions of the villains that killed their Spider-Men
I wanna see Matt Murdock on the big screen so bad
The fact that they haven't blown the whole load just yet only makes sense. I am convinced we'll see more spidermen and daredevil.
You've explained this story/these stories well enough that a 60+yo fan understands it! TY
Iron man will be back
I can’t wait until this movie cause I can’t wait for green goblin and doc oc.I also can’t wait for Peter going to another universe and if you were right and Matt Murdoc is gonna be in it it’ll be amazing.
I’m calling it now; Doc Oc forms the sinister six using a villain from each movie (Green Goblin, Doc Oc, Sandman, Lizard, Electro, Vulture) and they fight against all three spider-men!
Crazy stuff
Hair? Look more like a liquid Strange was pouring.
I loved the trailer, it was a surprise for me because I wasn't even thinking about it.
If it's gonna be the sinister 6 who the members
Awesome!
Amazing!
Wonder if tobey and Andrew gonna be there still
SHOTU OUT to 'Ditko' written in graffiti on the wall behind Peter and MJ lying on the roof. It's a shout to Steve Ditko. -)
I thought the trailer didn’t give to much away and kept everyone thinking about who will be some new characters entering in no way home
imagine watching Spiderman: No way home without knowing ALL the history of the main character
This guy is high lol. Mephisto confirmed because Peter picture with red horns 😂. It’s wandavision theories all over again
“bruh”
Perfect breakdown. I can not wait for this to come out! This is all I wanted for Xmas! 😂
Love that octo arms.
onion
That fact that you used bombastic as a description is enough to subscribe lol . Great video!!
Bully Maguire: "I'll be in the movie when you fix this damn door!"
Considering the fact that Willem Dafoe was absolutely the green goblin laughing in that bomb scene, paired with Doc Oc, Tobey definitely has to be there. Then, Jamie Foxx is coming back as electro, so that means Andrew has to be there too. I don't think we'll see them in trailers because that is the big surprise that will get people to the theaters. But this is going to be AMAZING!
Why does strange still have the eye of agamotto? The time stone was destroyed in the infinity saga......
That rainbow bridge was coming from Strange's Eye Time stone case thingy.
Sup chat
This is the 3rd and final installment. We all know that it's gonna be insane! Another reason to be alive until then so be safe everyone! GET VACCINATED!
that meme was weird and random
2:27 seconds... is that GREEN GOBLIN IN COMICS SUIT OVER THE SAND PILE RIGHT CORNER?  ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Just in 1 frame
theory: When doc ock says "Hello Peter" There's a chance he isn't evil cause before he  "died" He liked peter and sacrificed himself when he could have easily killed him, but this could be a different doc ock where he probably didn't sacrifice himself and killed Peter. But also I hope he's the one that sacrificed himself. Hyped for this film tho...
Happy is going to die
Cant wait for this film!
That scene with the dolly track camera, pushing in-shot, where Peter and Aunt May look shocked at someone entering their living room...I’m calling it...THAT’s his Uncle Ben...but from another timeline/universe!!!
Why are the stairs not destroyed still. If you magic one wouldn't you magic fix the other.
It’s not Matt Murdock. He’s a bit soft looking in the midsection. Daredevil is shredded
DD with a bit belly? I don't think so
I think Happy is going to die. Peter was in a funeral-level suit during the Happy scene. A reach a devil's reach maybe.
Number 2
2:45 Foggy Nelson??
I’m a professional voice actor. For many years, I’ve had a normally useless talent for recognizing celebrity voices in commercials, animated movies, etc.   The menacing voice after the Green Goblin grenade… “Be careful what you wish for, Parker” … that’s 100% Benedict Cumberbatch. I’d bet my left nut on it.   I’m less certain about the laugh, but it doesn’t quite sound like Dafoe. Could be, but it’s a breathier and softer than his sharp cackle in the original Spider-Man. Almost sounds like a higher-pitched version of Cumberbatch’s evil laugh as Smaug the dragon.   My first suspicion is that the version of GG in this movie could be a variant of Stephen Strange. If the voice is his, but not the laugh, that theory falls apart. But a variant of Strange might also be a separate villain, like Mephisto. The voice just sounds too menacing to be Strange Prime. Interestingly, Dormammu was also voiced by Cumberbatch in Dr. Strange. Might he be outed as a variant of Strange as well? Doubtful, but an interesting detail. lol I’m done now.
When there is multiple Spider-Man I feel like the love for the character will go
Toby miguire leak is insane
2:49 I doubt daredevil is in the movie,he serves no purpose whatsoever
Except Matt is much fitter than this guy....
my god Matt Murdock gain some weight
Doc octavius when he said hello Peter he was talking to Tom abt there's a high chance that the thought Tom was Andrew
is this the end of spider-man in the mcu?
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self.🎈
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! COMIC BOOK MOVIES ARE NOT DEAD YET!!!! THANK YOU 😊
Lit! Thanks for this.
How did you not point put that peter was holding the cube when strange pushed him out of his body
When Doc Ock says "Hello Peter", what if in the movie he's saying that to Tobey's Spiderman, surprised Doc is still alive?
I heard there were a bunch of break-ins over at the car park. That is wrong on so many levels.
They'll never reveal the fact that Tobey and Andrew are in this movie due to the fact that they want to keep this as a ''surprise'' for the movie, a surprise for those normal people that are out there and are not watchin every leak that's gettin out you know, normal consumer. The thing that they will probably do is to realease some sort of 5 to 10 seconds teaser teasin this stuff, something like Dr. Strange sayin to one of the other Peter something like "you're not my Peter or not my Spider Man" and the screen cuts to black.
I'm glad I'm not the only one who though that women looked like it could be miles mom...what nobody noticed cuz they were distracted by the black suit is, it looks like Peter is running thru F.E.A.S.T.
What? No Toby Macguire? No Andrew Garfield? No Green Goblin? No Nick Fury or agent Maria Hill? No Daredevil? WTF is going on?
This trailer seemed to tell us nothing and everything at the same time im so hyped!!
we got close to 3 minutes…3 minutes of trailer timeeee
I feel like the wizard Halloween lights looked almost like a yellow faced goblin, but I might just be seeing things🤔
That white shirt guy has a slightly big tummy. Can't be matthew
I literally JUST GOT A SPIDERMAN: NO WAY HOME AD BEEFIRE THE VIDEO!!! WTF
Spoiler man is how I do
I just searched on Google and it literally says Toby And Andrew will be in it.
Guy that slams down the papers has a pot belly. Not sure if dare devil / Matt Murdock has let himself go or clearly not him??
Imagine Spiderman meets Tony stark and Tony get a way to get back to the multiverse where he was killed
Nowadays Easter eggs videos be like “see they’re on a roof they did that before” 😐😐 really?
So ready for this movie! Let's go
Look who's trending 👀
Watching this trailer and picking up on some the references had me feeling like a kid in a candy store and honestly I can't wait to send too much money repeatedly going to see it
No chance that's Matt Murdoch, what a reach
33rd st is Freemason easter egg
What if what really interrupts Stranges concentration is the events of Loki but Strange thinks it’s Spider-Man
Unreal. Looks so good
Sinister six : sandman, green goblin ,doc ock, electro, lizard ,last one ?
"Hello, Pauler!" -- Mephisto ;)   ..... Paul you are my Christmas every day ❤
I'm really happy to hear that there are lots of returning actors from the various different Spiderman films. I would love to see a scene with some of the villains from different universes interacting with each other and maybe (hopefully) working together against the 3 different Spidermen.
i have the feeling that they wioll kill tom hollands spider-.man off due the fact that its his last mcu movie and make miles the new spider-man... which makes sense after the blip if he wasnt away he could be around 14 or 15 there... and in ultimate comics spider-man was killed off by the sinister six but was later of course resurrected due the goblin formula in his blood
Next lockdown Spiderman movie: Spiderman homeschool
No more trailers should be released or it will ruin the movie unless shot fake footage like Far From Home
Number 2 on trending! Man like🙌🏾🙌🏾
Peter's pose at 3:13 is that of the Hanged Man in Tarot cards.  Someone who is going to see things from a new perspective...
🔥🔥
Love the video very impressed with all the theories.
Loving the content 💯🙌🏻
Nobody is really saying this but what if Aunt May actually DOES die because everyone knows Peter is Spider-Man? Maybe Peter tried to live with every knowing he is Spider-Man, then someone kills May and the easiest way to undo that is for everyone to forget? I just find it hard to believe that Dr. Strange would risk breaking reality unless someone died.
Spider-Man will always be my favorite super hero. I was a little bummed when they revealed his identity at the end of FFH but I’m so excited to see where they take this story.
Thank you for the insight… definitely subscribed 👍🏽
Man this looks so cool
Also Betty Brant is on the tv when Peter is back at school
IM SO EXCITED :) great breakdown!!!
Hate to agree with the guy who disagrees with you, but if that's Matt Murdoch in the trailer then he's been eating a lot of donuts in Hell's Kitchen.
So excited for this movie
You not even gonna _M E N T I O N_ the "Dark" Dr. Strange theory??
If Tobey is in this movie, I would love for there to be a scene where he sees that even in alternate timelines, that J Jameson is still J.K. Simmons
is venom going to be in this movie
I think that all that adventure had happend on mirror world what strange did before using spell. Reason for that is to show peter that what he asking making things worse then it is all ready.
How do you know Charlie cox will be in the movie ?
The fact that this is #2 on trending list makes me happy for Paul
I haven't been this excited for a film since The Fappening.
Thanks for the video! When will the wait be over lol 😆
the first look was amazing. im glad that they didnt show Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield(if they are in the movie). I hope in the 1st trailer they show all the villains but not Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, I hope they save them for the movie.
For some reason this Spiderman is starting to get annoying to me. Feels like its getting more and more childish 🤷🏾‍♂️
This makes me almost forget that The Eternals and Shang Chi are coming! It's going to be a great 4 months!!!
Woo! It looks so good!
I haven't been this hyped for a Marvel movie since Endgame.
11:01 watch bottom right corner in slow mo that's so Tobey it's the black raimi suit
Will Captain Amerika come back as the human torch in this movie?
For fuck sakes I'm crying like a kid again
If their going by everyone that dies it would be; Green goblin, Doc Ock, Venom, New Goblin, and electro. And I’m assuming they’re going to have vulture, and scorpion as well?
So pumped!! Also, it probably won't happen but I love the fan suggestion that Flash Thompson hears the breaking news of Spidey's identity mid-tattoo!
So is it just me or is it not Defoe's voice. It definitely sounds like James franco's "harry osborn"
Will this be the last spiderman movie?for tom holland?
It was Agatha all along.
Your timecodes are inaccurate.
All i heard - Blah blah blah, blah blah blah
Someone get me my inhaler because after seeing this I literally CANT BREATHE!!!
Can't believe this was a "teaser." So much plot!
I love how everyone forget green goblins bomb rolling out of nowhere
11:02 you can see goblin flying at the bottom right
Can’t wait. Been waiting on this type of Spider-Man movie since Toby
I don't think aunt May dying will cause Tom to seek out Strange. He specifically mentions her during the spell...I have no explanation for her absence tho, I thought she'd be living with Happy by now
I've never been more ready for Spider-Man to mess up something really important by talking too much 😩😂
Daaaaaaamn that girl at 4:19 on the right in the skirt is CAKED up!!!!!! THICC!
Fan theory: Multiverse of madness will clear that strange shown (after the spell) in no way home is mad and not the same strange !!
They re-wrote the ending of WandaVision to try and make her seem herioc for her "sacrifice", and excluded Dr Strange as they didn't want him to outshine / "mansplain" to a woman. By this logic, there's no way they'll make her the villain against Dr Strange. They might have her fight him, but probably make it so she it in the right and morally and ethically superior in every way, and the one true hero.
im gonna put some dirt in your eye
I  assume the snow is a curse. Wouldn't make since that strange just didn't fix the roof
Great video, thanks for your opinion
While I was watching this I saw the Spider-Man trailer as an ad
Congrats on #2 On Trending.
While I was watching this I saw an ad trailer
Can’t wait for this movie it’s gonna be great hope I can win !!!
Wow, heavy downvotes. What happened?
So There is no way home literally
I'm wondering abour Doc Oc. Seems like his change of heart was for nothing in Raimi's movie unless the tentacles have taken over during the course of the multiverse travel
Wow John Lennon from the mirror universe makes his big debut
MArvel will never stop when they will be done with Peter they will go with Miles, I'm scared and exited at the same time
Puerto Rico, seriously dude?
Spiderman is the best
Congrats on reaching #2 on trending 👏
Why does docter strange look different
Mysterious voice is definitely James Franco I think!  aka Harry Osborne does that mean we’re getting Harry as the Green Goblin?
13:27 you thought you were slick huh
I can't wait for the new spiderman movie!
I’m 99.99% sure Doc Oc is talking to Tobys Spider-Man not toms at the end of the trailer makes sense if Dr stranges spell worked the Spider-Man he knows it’s tobys
That maniacal laugh from Green goblin gave me chills
13:28 🤣😅
For sure not flash bro
Imagine seeing this movie but not seeing the end credit scene for far from home
It’s not Matt Murdock. The guy is too chubby
All I Need To Hear Is A Certain Voice Go ' I'M BACK, I'M BACK !' And Then I'll Be Happy Also I Honestly Thought That Toms Peter Was Wearing The Symbiote But I Guess Not......
This video is hella popular Peter can live his life again
It was not hair.. but potion.. 9:21 u can see the flask
Number 2 trending. Congrats man!
More spiderman meme will be fed into the internet.
spiderverse  miles Morales needed
This shit is giving me One More Day vibes with Spider-Man and Dr. Strange !! Cuz remember in One More Day when Peter Parker got his identity revealed to the whole world ? Yeah idk what the MCU is going to do with this plot line in No Way Home but I’m getting heavy One More Day vibes from this movie !
Jhhhhhhhh
Bro, I think the blonde boy behind Peter is Brad
Imagine if superior spiderman was also there and fought the other multiverse doc ock.
The Mephisto joke gets me every single time.
all that and you failed to see parker's legs on the roof? He's making the figure four. Fantastic huh?
Hi
Мэтт мог бы быть там, но неужели никто не видит это пузо, которое прячется под рубашкой?) И смог бы Мэтт так быстро узнать о случившемся, если Паркера только-только привезли из дома, так как на нём та же пижама, что и в сцене с тётей Мэй перед телевизором?
I can't believe how many characters are in this one.
This trailer had me shaking for an hour. This movie is gonna be awesome. Love that the OG villains are coming back.
it might come out on my birthday
I'm looking forward to seeing the Kingpin's debut in the MCU.
Tom Holland and Andrew Garfield are embarrassments compared to Tobey, but as soon as I saw willem dafoe’s pumpkin bomb and Alfred Molina’s Doc Oc, I knew I needed to see this
Give me that box set 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Your chapters are way off
I don't think it's a coincidence that there's exactly three monitors stacked in top of each other with a half spider man picture
#2 on trending. Ya boi is getting that recognition
Okay but like I’m really hoping in future trailers they don’t show Toby and Andrew and leave them for film reveal surprises
I'm really excited to see Flash's  reaction to Peter being spider man
Dafoe still got it
13:27 fire
"It didnt go over the top and didn't completely spoil anything"   Says the friendly neighborhood Spoilerman lol!
This was a great 18 minutes! Im going too your videos now
Peter will win hopefully who’s kidding it’s Marvel Peter will win
So ready for December 🤘🏽
I love the theory that Doc Oc is talking to Tobey’s Peter.  And if that’s his introduction, it could absolutely be an Cap-Mjolnir level theater uproar moment.
Yeah sorry man. That dude is too fat to be Charlie Cox
Why is doc ock back to being a villain if at the end of SM2 he sacrificed himself saying "I will not die a monster"?
It’s coming out on my birthday and I cannot express how happy that makes me
Was hoping the other 'Spider-Men' would be in the movie.
Hello Peter ..... Made my day
This movie is going to blow top off the multiverse. I’m beyond excited and can’t wait for December.
#2 ON TRENDING
Ready for the movie
December can't come soon enough. They did an amazing job with this trailer so much so that I was on the edge of my seat watching it. Love the fact that they are bringing Doc Oc back and definitely going to love watching this one.
Whoever walked in on Peter and Aunt May sitting on the sofa didn't trigger his Spider Sense.
Isn't it funny how when Peter and MJ are on the laying on the rooftop, Peter's legs are in a figure-4 position? Fantastic Four anyone???
I will repeat a lot of what you just said to my "friends" so they'll think I might be smart.
Great video!!!!
I feel like spiderman gonna have flashes to alternate timelines on how to beat these different villains.
I just want a live action scene of the meme with three Spider-Men pointing at each other.
@4:44 police lights on the curtains, its the police
The comment on Dr. Strange throwing Uncharted 2 broke me LOL hahahaaa and either Cox got a quarantine Gut on him or thats not him LoL
bullshit, matt murdock would never have a fat belly like that fatso putting those papers
A little clarification: the storyline this is based on is One Moment in Time. Anyways OMD and OMIT are terrible stories lol.
Notice that the trailer is 3 minutes long, 3 minutes of PLAY TIME!  BONESAW IS READY!
…I bet that’s not Dr Strange.
I don't think dr strange is the one who caused all this. I think he created some sort of placebo spell but then after events of loki and kang, IT REALLY HAPPENS
Love the trailer. Totally agreed, it shows just enough without spoiling anything
Will they do the "Me and the Boys" meme in the movie?
Super
Awesome review and December can’t come soon enough 🤘🏼🕷!
This is an outstanding teaser!!!
Congrats on being #2 on Trending Paul!
My Fiance and I are stoked for this
If you look at the background windows in the scene with Aunt May, it looks like flashing police lights outside. Might be the scene where Peter is brought in for questioning.
Spooder man spooder man doin thangs dat a spooder can
This should be cool and by cool I mean awsome
I don't think that the guy in white shirt is matt because this dude appears to have a big belly lol
You know for sure Charlie Cox is in this movie or just making stuff up? Us Daredevil fans don't need false hope.
Bruv it’s crazy
You’re expecting Doctor Strange to be in the movie I don’t know if he will be a daredevil he’s not going to be in the movie
My theory: Dr Strange will give Peter a gift box in the movie (just as in the comic) but instead of bringing uncle Ben back for a few moments, it will bring Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) for a super surprise cameo
Can't wait to see this movie, thanks for posting!
This looks amazing omgg
The exact point when strange is doing his magic.....is the moment sylvie kills he who remains....which breaks the bounds of his spell and everybody with the name Peter parker and spiderman is pulled into this universe, as the spell was cast here....
Dude, it's not just "everything you said in WandaVision". You reference Mephisto in every video and often multiple times. Build a bridge and get over it god damn
I wanna know what that little cube is that Peter has when strange pushes him out of his body. Also how Strange got the time stone back, or if it's just an empty Eye of Agamoto.
Imma have to give you a dislike because you didn’t put in Andrew Garfields cutscene not once.
No way that is Matt.. That guy in the movie looks way too overweight
I am a huge fanboy of Spider-Man I literally wore the same Spider-Man suit for 4 years straight on Halloween.
Love it !!!
13:27 ayooo like why😹😹😹😹😹😹
What if strange is actually mifisto
I think Doctor strange is just messing with Peter, trying to teach him a lesson, the spell is fake but at the same time Sylvie killed Kang the Conqueror and all hell broke loose or all multiverse broke loose.
3:44 probably that's just a reference to The Devil All the Time
Amazing how this video is piggybacking of the trailer for views and is trending number 2!!
Epic
6:45 Did I just see the rings from Chang Chi?
Oooh my Spidey senses tingled all over! X Love the mix of a ‘normalish’ young lad, Spidey trying to do the right thing & appearing to get it wrong big time &  the amazing Dr Strange visual elements. All in all looks to be a top movie & ill be booking my favourite imax fir first night release! 🤞🏼 it will be Christmas x Thanks as always for your great reviews 👍🏼
Just gonna leave this here, ...   Could Maphesto be Strange?
That looks nothing like Cox lol that guy has a gut , Cox wear way more fitted suits
Damn I can’t wait.
NO WAY 😳😳😳😳😳
very good video!!!
I don't mind if this movie concludes Spider-man's character arc in the MCU but I definitely hope that Disney and Sony will still collaborate for future Spiderman appearances. He's such an influential and loved character that it would be a shame to not bring him back for more.
"I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye" wouldve blown "hello, peter" out of the water
MEPHISTO CONFIRMED
Isn’t possible Doc looks even more epic
I have a hard time believing Dr strange would do a spell like this.
Everyone asking where is Tobey but I’m 100% waiting for my boy Andrew.
I don't think Doc Ock is a Villain. I think he'll be an Anti-Hero.  Norman, on the other hand is ALWAYS the Bad Guy. Which is why I like him so much. :)
4:42 you can also see emergency lights, I believe police, in the window. Probably the police busting in. And her getting up is them either knocking or busting down the door. Possibly them coming to arrest peter for the scene in the interrogation room
3:00 too fat to be Charlie cox
Why not Flash’s mother? 🤷🏻‍♂️  I think that’s Murdock too. His stance.
Would be cool if the reason we see Tobey in the Morbius trailer is bc Goblin twisted the narrative to where Peter killed Goblin and now the secret is out.
What if the "Strange" that casts the spell isn't Strange, but Mephisto eyyy? Making him make a deal with the devil still. Or is this just me putting oil on the fire?
Would be cool if the reason we see Tobey in the Morbius trailer is bc Goblin twisted the narrative to where Peter killed Goblin and now the secret is out.
Is this film written by He Who Remains
I'd fucking love it if tobey's spiderman is a bearded version of tobey's spiderman and he's derpy. Would be awesome
I Just realized kingpin could very well make a mid credit appearance to try and create the sinister six
that wasnt murdoch, the dude looks bigger.
can’t believe wandavision was teasing this trailer for the longest time
Love your trailer breakdown. :) Can't wait to see all of 'em spiderman!
If Toby is in the movie imma die
#2 on trending!
13:26 Lmao
Great video! Thank you!
Okay guys if we want another trailer remember to fix the damn door
This is going to be Amazing I can’t wait! I’m 49 and I have read every last Spiderman comic on Gods Green Earth and to see the MCU bring all of this to life just gives me the Shivers!
Trailer was amazing. Can't wait for the movie even more now
I think when doctor oct shows up tobys Peter is on the bridge with the other Peters
I can say there will be no Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield spiderman from the  other universe..  if there is another spiderman then it is probable another Tom Holland.. doctor octavious wouldn't have recognised peter Parker unless
I literally got an ad of the NWH trailer during this video 🤣
the first look was amazing! i have theory that in the end credit scene Ned somehow becomes the hobgoblin and it will tease the next spiderman movie
Something feels a bit off in the shows and movies after endgame. It feels like there's a sense of dread. For example spiderman far from home and no way home(based on the trailer) it all seems like it's all leading up to something really bad. Not that the movies will be bad but the i mean characters like spiderman possibly having a more tragic future. Idk mephisto? Lol doctors strange seems off, and the world in the mcu just seems darker.
Taking *Over* The Game My Friend
That hello peter line ripped the heart out of a whole generation
SHUT UP BRO
This will be the first film post Covid that will be absolutely a smash in theaters
Everyone’s talking about the “Hello Peter” giving chills when for me it was hearing Willam Defoe’s laugh
Dr strange is supposed to be all knowing and serious but in this trailer he looks more cheerful and relaxed, my theory is, that might not be Dr strange ( shapeshifter) , I might be wrong 🤷🏽‍♂️
That 100% is not Matt Murdoch slamming down the files in the shirt and tie because 1) love handles, and 2) you can see the whole guy in a couple shots before.
Remember set your expectations low
if norman osborne green goblin shows up in this film then does that mean we will never see him or oscorp in any future films
Aunt may Survive !
The Green Goblin is back!
My birthday is on December 17 and that is one of the movie is coming out I am a Big spider man fand
Let's goooooo!!!!
This trailer looks great now all we need is Maguire, Garfield, Dafoe, Fox, and let’s not forget about Thomas Haden Church.
Can't wait, it's going to be so great!
@2:41: Not Matt Murdock -- that guy's got a huge gut. So much so that its pushing his belt out. Maybe it's some cop showing Peter mountains of files on something he must've caused. Or Foggy! (Altho', he lost weight.)
Pretty ballsy to base this off of One More Day. Hopefully this movie isn’t crap because of that.
id still love to see hobgoblin
Where’s Wanda when you need her
I still predict that Tobey and Andrew will show up in the post credit scene and be like “who’s ready to quick some ass”
I don’t think that is our dr strange. He is not acting right.
Your breakdown sucks
absolutely love it thanks for the breakdown, also your labels are off for nearly every section past the first third of the video thought you should know
Everyone complaining about the look of Holland's MJ can take a hike now!
Who is at the bottom right on 12:33 . Judging by the suit, it doesn't look like Tom Holland's spidey but someone else.
The fact that this vid is #2 on trending only behind the trailer itself is crazy
Wouldn’t hurt for Marvel to update William Defoe’s costume.  I liked it, but as the Green Goblin, he kinda looked like a power ranger, other than that his performance as the Goblin was SPECTACULAR.
interesting you said that strange casted the spell instead of the devil mefiesto, makes me think about that "devil in disguise" poster when peter was crowded at the beginning foreshadowing something bad to  happen, you know?
3:06 I’m pretty sure Peter and MJ are talking on FaceTime in this scene, not reading news headlines. But I suppose we’ll find out for sure later.
I think by the end of the film Peter will accept who he is and become the Iron Man type figure in the MCU
Will Mysterio and the Lizard one will come in this one? Any idea?
bruh why you spoil the main moment of the trailer in the thumbnail like that
Damn , Iron Man didn’t get this much hate as Peter
My head Canon is that each of the villians see their version of Peter when they look at Tom Holland which is why they know who he is even if they dont come from the same universe. They simply see Spider-Man but THIER Spider-Man
Amazing
Try not to spoiler this one Tom.
1.5 mill boottellll waataaaaas
No one is talking about the fact that both raimi and tom hardys venom are now canon
Glad to see Memers are having a good time
this EPIC
imagine after the pumpkin bombs explode james franco just walks out and licks his lips and says "tastes like strawberries peter"
The fact that so many people are thinking Dr. Octopus is talking to Toby’s Peter in that scene makes me believe otherwise.
Peter wearing j1 shadow v2 on the rooftop with MJ
Dude I’m so excited. It’ll really interesting to see how different this movie will be from the rest. It’s still directed by John Watts but it looks so different. More grown up if that makes sense. Peter is dealing with a lot more heavy stuff here so I like that the style in which this was filmed matches what he’s going through
Dude  - Love your content and suppositions on details you see but you are so way off on the scene where Peter and crew are walking through crowd holding the "devil" signs.  That is obviously them outside of school going in, NOT him turning self in.  throughAlso at station scene he is in black tee
Doc octavius: Hello Peter Brilliant, but lazy Tom's peter: Ahmm.. wrong Peter
FUCKIN AWESOME
If all Spider man culminate in this movie i think ill die of happiness. I love Spiderman but my favorite of all time was Toby Maguire, so seeing Doc Oc and a hint of Green Goblin and what could potentially be Sandman is just so spine tingling for me. December needs to roll by soon.
Damnnn
Cant wait for this movie.
“Pennsylvania station” nope. Not what it says..
“Hello there”
"friendly neighbourhood spoiler man " this got me dead
I feel like when doc oct said "hello peter"  he said it to Tobey, I feel like in that scene Peter (Tom Holland) is fighting Doc and getting his ass wooped and all of sudden spiderman (Tobey's spiderman) shows up to help Tom Holland and doc tells Tobey spiderman 'hey peter"
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 this movie is has to  be 3 hours long it has so many things going on its amazing 🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷
I’m really excited we’re getting 4 MCU films this year.
You'll get your rent when you RELEASE THIS DAMN MOVIE!
Devil in disguise is more like a shout out to daredevil, who's likely in this film.
Ock rules!
Which would be more important, fixing a whole in the roof or fixing the main staircase, the stairs are fixed in the clip. Strange is Mephisto, the snow is reference to being in Hell. The other times we see spidey it looks more like he's running from strange.
Give me Tobey and Andrew.
Christmas can't come soon enough😍😍😍
Intro sinister six?  🤷‍♂️
If Murdock put in lots of weight then it's him lol
Where all my fellow nerds unite :)
If that's Matt Murdock, Daredevil really let himself go, carrying a huge muffin top.
The first look did what it had to do so I won’t be seeing any other trailers. Can’t wait for 12/17
Dr.octopus looks like John Lennon
it’s crazy how before they didn’t know who he was before and they loved him, but when they finally found out he’s a criminal now
So No Madam Webb?
I feel like it’s required of me to like the video every time mephisto is mentioned. You are absolutely relentless my friend.
2:25 The shots of Peter in the custody of the DODC seem like they probably come after the shot of him and Aunt May on their sofa (4:42) since he's in his pyjamas while being interrogated & it seems to be the same pair he's wearing at home w/ Aunt May.  It makes the most sense for that (4:42) to be when he's brought into the station, but either 1) someone else was there to open the door for them (i.e. Happy or Ned) since Peter & May were on the sofa, or 2) the DODC would hv had to let themselves into the apartment (probably w/out kicking the door in considering how relaxed Peter & May seemed on the sofa).
i was watching this and got an ad for the trailer
I can't really imagine flash with blond hair XD
#2 on trending OMGG LETS GO PAUL‼️
Theory: Mophisto has taken over strange's body, hence why he ignored the warnings. He did this working with kang to destabilize the multiverse leading to the multiverse of madness.
So doctor strange is evil now
Honestly having Tobey and Andrew would be bonus because just by having the villains is crazy cool
Can't wait for the movie.
Bro keep the jokes to a minimum please…..
Yoooo the Loki show showed how time travel could be fucked with bc everything started branching off what if this movie takes place during the Loki show
I feel like the Doctor Strange is one from the multiverse else why will he risk all this for Peter?
Just saw the trailer it was in ad
If Tobey is in it, then for the first time, I'm in for a Disney Marvel movie
Good analysis, but as much as I want your theory about Matt Murdock to be true, the person slamming the papers looks a little too chubby to be Charlie Cox.  I say this as a card-carrying Fat Sweaty Guy.
Its not Daredevil yo. You're being..
Yes looks amazing!
The black and gold suit is from the video game
We've already seen a middle-aged Spider-Man in "Into The Spider-Verse."  If Tobey Maguire is in this movie, I hope he's playing Uncle Ben.
This is gonna be a mind F#%$!!!
You didn’t noticed the shoes Peter is wearing when lying down on the roof with MJ?.. those are Jordan 1’s.. this is the shoe Miles wear in “Into The Spider Verse”
The Spiderman film could possibly compete with matrix 4
It's looking like another great spiderman movie
Wonder if itll resemble the One More Day storyline since Mephisto is going to be involved.
- While Peter and MJ are on the roof, Peter's legs are in the shape of a 4. As in Fantastic 4. They're coming sooner than we thought... Mephisto confirmed, Iron Man is an A.I., up is down down is up...........
I honestly just excited to watch can’t wait‼️🙈
Congratulations on passing a million views bud.
I just wanna hear that same voice that uttered “you’ll get your money when you fix this damn door” just a nice healthy overdose of nostalgia
That’s not daredevil, that dude has a tubby belly
Guys, I'll be uploading a reaction video later on today. Heavy spoilers always on point
I can’t wait for this movie to come out! This will bring everyone back to the theaters !!!
Andrew and tobey showing up would make this one of the best movies ever
How tf will they wrap it all up in 3 hrs?
Miles Morales' appearance hint is way too underrated, this should have more attention!
Great breakdown Sir thank you for the hard work
At the beginning Dr.Strange isn’t wearing anything and then he’s wearing the eye of agomoto. But what’s inside?????
I’m so excited for this 🔥
Spiderman is always been my favorite character, can’t wait for this!
2:44 Was Charlie Cox's Matt Murdoch confirmed to appear in the film? If he is/ that is him, I can only imagine it being a very small cameo as not only are there already a lot of characters in this film (Peter, MJ, Ned, Dr Strange, Happy, Doc Oc, Electro, Green Goblin, etc, & possibly Sandman, Lizard, Tobey Maguire's Peter, Andrew Garfield's Peter, etc), but Peter goes to Dr Strange to solve the problem for him so even tho the spell goes wrong, it seems like Peter will be too busy dealing w/ the villains for the rest of the movie to give time for Daredevil to be properly established.
This will definitely be movie if the year and will most likely hit that 2 billion mark
If you look at the part where sandman comes, you can tell by pausing he's saving Peter from being electrocuted by electro. I believe once he comes into the mcu the villains will try and persuade him to joint their side. But because he's not a bad guy, just misunderstood, hell rebel and join Spiderman. I believe  what will lead to another villain to take his role (i.e vulture again or scorpion, only this time in his suit) sinister six when released - goblin, electro, octopus, lizard, rhino and sandman ( sand man rebels then gets trades for vulture or scorpion)
Got some video in ya ads bruv
I bet Miles Morales will be the MCU spidey from No Way Home forward...
Doctor Strange messing up the spell could be what Kang hears when he cant view the timelines anymore
15:38 fuck me
How is Charlie Cox in the movie he's not credited in imdb?
10:56 I'm curious what the mystical looking cube in Peter's hand is when Dr Strange pushes his astral form out of his body.  13:38 If it is something key to the plot I would hv expected it to be edited out considering how careful Marvel is w/ their trailers.
Clearly doctor strange isn't the one we know. He has to be a variant messing with Spiderman or mafisto...
Anyone realize octo robot hands were missing when he showed up
11:01 12:34 I wonder if it is the Lizard behind Peter in this scene, but it's too hard to tell for sure. Whatever it is, I don't think it's in a glass prison tho bcos it looks more like it hits some kind of energy shield when it lunges at Peter - probably either some kind of tech or a spell creating a barrier/ prison (13:03 which would line up w/ the theory of Dr Strange imprisoning the villains).
My man Paul is trending 🔥 #2
why tf did i get a spider-man trailer ad after i watched the trailer before this vid
the amount of timestamps marked on the video player... you ok paul?
SINISTER SIX!!!!
Hello Peter Peter Pumpkin bomb eater
yeah yeah green goblin and octopus are cool..., but RENT? where is Mr.Ditkovitch?
What's the name of the book?
14:54 I have no idea what you are talking about here. I've been staring at the two for like 20 minutes and can't spot a single difference between the one in IW and this "new" iron spider suit
DC Forever ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
That is not Murdock,  this guy has a big belly.
11:01 12:31 I wonder if the scene of lightning hitting the dirt/sand is Peter using magic via his 'integrated suit', or if it's Sandman protecting Peter from Electro's blast. If so, it would seem to confirm that Sandman (like Doc Ock) is likely going to be a reformed villain & probably an ally to Peter in the film.
I'm sure the movie's gonna be entertaining bcos of it, but I don't get how Peter messing up Dr Strange's spell would hv brought over ppl from a different universe.  Emergency Awesome theorised that Dr Strange tried to combine realities where ppl didn't know Spiderman's identity, but I don't know why he would do a spell like that instead of a simple memory erasure spell (which sounds easier anyway). I'm curious how well they explain it in the movie.
How would that Doc Ock know Tom's Peter Parker?  He's only seen one Peter and that's Tobey.
Lotta cringe
Now I wanna watch a marvel movie
Could someone link me the info on how we KNOW Charlie Cox will be in the film? IMBD? What did I miss this could be huge
Matt Murdock is a DEFENSE Attorney. So if he did show up it would be to have Peter released, not to slam evidence in his face while he's still handcuffed.
did anyone see black spiderman there in the trailer because I saw it
My Christmas present lolll
Awesome!! Can’t wait
Got an ad for the trailer beginning of this video. 4th time I saw it today.  Edit: got it a second time halfway through. That makes 5 times I've seen it today.
Another hilarious and dope break down! Actually buzzing to see this film now haha
Still don’t understand why flash wasn’t amadeus cho
I hope they don’t show Andrew or Tobey at all in the trailers, and have their appearance be a complete mystery as to where and when in the movie.
So MJ is not only not a redhead, she’s half-black? How progressive..
Hyped
Jesus
Spider man no home
Cant wait to see this movie! This trailer is epic and im glad marvel is moving forward
i just want toby and andrew tbh
Come to Jesus, all who are heavy hearted and burdened. Jesus loves you ❤❤
The trailer is awesome!!!!
movies need to stop making so much money cos it costs less to produce movies so why should they make MORE profits  considering most of these people are degenerate in nature and wasrtful humans
you had me at hello
1 million views already? Damn they want you to break it down badly badly
Me and you can rule this city Spider-Man, or we can just fight to the death!
The guy you are saying might be Murdock looks to have a bit of a gut on him (and it isn't just the shirt puffing out as you can see his gut pushing on his belt too). Has Charlie put on a little weight?
*Just imagine Ock's face when he see's Spiderman with tentacles xD*
I’m really hoping to see Toby’s spider man in this movie
“Hello Peter” HYPEEEEE
Doc is looking younger than he did in Spider man 2
Your source was on point. NEVER QUESTION THIS CHANNEL!!!
*Hello Peter* Two words, MILLION AMOUNTS OF NOSTALGIA!! 😭🙏
I wanna see the goblins new costume!!!
My goodness I can’t wait! This may be the best spider-man movie of all time. Can they pull it off
I cant wait to see miles Morales that's mainly what I'm excited for
pretty sure mephisto will be introduced with another super natural character like ghost rider or blade or moon knight
12:32 IF YOU PAUSE VERY FAST U CAN SEE SPIDERMAN HAVING THE GOLD SUIT OMGGGG
Spider-Man one more day comic vibes😓
Hyper hype breakdown, brillant
My man trending no .2 just next to no way home trailer
That's not Charlie Cox...  The guy is chubby.... Charlie is cut.
#2 Trending
Everyone's celebrating Doc Ock meanwhile Me getting over the moon at hearing JK Simmon's voice as JJJ!
“Hello Peter” I came ngl
When doctor strange and Peter walked by the staircase you can see light shining down on it that looks like sunlight from a hole so they probably never did fix it like you said
Yeah if Charlie Cox gained some weight lol
This dude threw every 3 seconds of the trailer up as an “easter egg” hoping that any of it sticks.
Hands down the most insightful in depth breakdown ive heard yet
Quick question, aren't all the infinity stones gone at this time in the timeline, so how can Dr. Strange look through time, without the time stone
I have been an MCU fan since day 1 (Iron man was one of my childhood favorite characters in the '90s), but I thought after End Game that maybe it either wouldn't stay fresh or that the quality would start to go down. I couldn't be happier with everything they've done since! This leading into MoM is going to be incredible!!!
The only reason why I hate these stupid new Spider-Man movies is because of the cast they're all whitewashed meaning they're not true to the comic books and their characters are disgusting look at flash for example He's not an Indian dude or Ned isn't a giant fat Asian or MJ is in a hybrid black girl
This looks amazing!! Great breakdown.
#2 on trending!!!! LETS GO PAUL
Bro I’m hungry as fuck i might get Wendys
I reckon that each spiderman will fight 2 of their enemies in their on dimensions toby doc and gg Andrew sandman and electro and TOM lizard and scorpion
I got an ad for a Spider No Way Home trailer during a trailer breakdown.
i feel like goblin, electro, n doc ock are gonna trash him then they gunna pop up and team up for the movie finale
9:52 no mention of the purple clouds and Kang??
Congrats on trending worldwide!!!!!!
God I’m so excited now December please come faster 😌
Dr Strange seems to be the real villain here. That isnt the real strange
Why Matt has a dad bod?😅
Oh, Spoiler Man, way to call the trailer pretty much in its completeness!
Yuhhhhhh
What if their isnt three spidermans but just one and all the villians see tom holland as tobey and garfield. So through their eyes toms spidey looks the ones they faced in their respectives films no one has thought about that. Also what if this is the evil doctor strange mephisto
Doctor strange it's going to end up being mephisto or nightmare in disguise
Where Tobey
Man is out here after after an hour damn
I got a feeling that doc ock said “hello Peter” to Toby, not Tom cuz i doubt he knows who tom is
AYYYYYY
The Mephisto theory could still be true! Dr. Strange could be the DEVIL IN DISGUISE! :O
I would like Tom to link up with the spideys as the movie progresses. Doc. Oc says hello to Tobeys petter and we see this because Tom is watching the fight. Just like in the spider verse movies they will talk to eachother saying “you are me” I think people are forgetting the spider verse movie. There is potential to link up everything because it’s all in the multiverse right?
Im just waiting for tobey to drop the “with a great power comes great responsibility” line 😪
Still Hoping that we can get Tony/Andrew Spideys
Hear me out….venom😳
Just so excited! Thinking Strange is drawing power from the dark side. Tsk tsk. Lol .... hello Darmamu!
Just a thought about the multi colours flashing up after the spell is cast. In the Spider-Verse movie from 2018 when Fisk used his multiverse machine thingy various colours and rainbows flashed up, left behind multicoloured mess around New York and the Spider-Man variations were pulled through multicoloured portals etc. Perhaps a link to Sony’s previous Spider-Man multiverse movie 👀
My inner child SCREAMED when I saw Doctor Octopus.
13:26 😂😂
you forgot eye of agamotto
Just excited that the miles morales(spider verse) Spider-Man/OG Spider-Man/poopy Spider-Man rumor is looking more and more true
Guess I was wrong and you were right. Not that anyone gives a crap about what I’m saying. Lol. I honestly thought they were gonna hold out on us and make us sweat this one. Glad the didn’t. This was an awesome trailer
how tf did you plan, record, edit and do everything then upload this within 1h of the trailer releasing
Awesome
“Bombastic” I see what u did there
I love you
Im calling it aunt may is gonna die her or Ned but shit maybe mj is gonna die
I don't think Peter is responsible for the spell messing up. That could very well happen at the exact moment Sylvie killed He Who Remains.
I wonder if the Spell happens during the crossing over Kang's Threshold.
Brilliant vid.... very detaile throughly enjoyed
Why dr strange still has the necklace?
I’m so excited or this! Ima have to binge a lot to get up to date on Disney plus
13:15 never knew gollum played the green goblin
so Dr. Strange the master of mystic arts says let the universe shit itself. Let me try and fix your life by ripping apart the space time continuum. Not a very Master of mystic arts move. No wonder he is overconfident. Jackass literally said "my job is to keep an eye on every threat to earth" and then when bruce named THANOS, he was like WHOOOOOOO ????
I wonder if we get a Joe Pesci for Uncle Ben.
This shhh is bananas
the mcu daily bugle is so trash
Great review, but us New Yorkers are used to saying it Penn Station 😁
Is it me or does the train that Docter Strange was on look like the one where doc ock and old spidey fought on in Spider Man 2??? Maybe im stretching it lol, excited for the movie tho!
This. Is. Going. To. Be. Rent-Free.
It could be fogy
4:48 why did you not call out the police lights in the back?
Honestly I can't believe all of you didn't see Dock OCK in the background
I’ve been waiting for this breakdown for so long 🤩🤩
I can't wait for the Green Goblin !
I can’t wait!!!!!
3:45 disappointed you didn’t catch The Devil All the Time reference
I got an ad for the trailer while watching 😂
That guy in the police station shot is definitely not Matt Murdoc as he's got maybe around 40 pounds of extra fat around his belly.
GIVE ME SPIDEEEYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!
Miles in the mcu would be pretty cool ngl
#2 on trending!
Does anyone else think the hanging wizards look like Ned??? To me it looks like they are teasing Ned green goblin. What do you think??
Idt William Defoe will be the green goblin I think it’s James Franco
For all we know ... the trailer is a misdirection ... they went out of their way to put a Dr. Octopus that will not be in the final cut.
Good job with #2 trending
Yo flash dyed his hqir blonde 1:12
Eee this is proper canny, just like old times.
Mr Ditkovich : *slowly comes out from the smoke*     RENT???
I bet tony stark is back that's why aunt may is suprized cuse she is one of the only one who remembers hes spiderman
99% NOT Murdoch unless he gained 50 lbs and a gut/spare tire.
Awesome
this voice is annoying
Awesome video.
I got the add for the trailer whilst watching this
What if Tobeys Peter ends up having a relationship with Tom Holland’s Aunt May before they all figure out they are Spider-Man. Everyone would just be so embarrassed and sickened to see Tobey’s Peter smashing his “other universal” Aunt…
I just want to see Toby and Andrew.......
LOOKS AMAZING !!!!! Cant waittt for December!!! Also did the hanging looks look like a wizard..... or Dracula ??? 👀🤔🤔🤔
Definitely not matt dude did you see the gut and the love handles in the slow mo clip while you were editing this?!
Doctor Strange is a variant here I AM SURe. Strange has always been logical and rational, doing what's good for the universe. Certainly, he wouldn't suddenly give Agatha vibes and mess with the timeline just bc some hero's face has been leaked.  EXCITEDDDDDDDDDDDD
I like these breakdown and review video quite a bit. But I absolutely Loathe the Reaction videos.
The trailer looks AMAZING!!! (No pun intended) LOL!! 😉
Judging by the body shape, that just can’t be Matt Murdoch… if it is, then Daredevil pulled a bit of a Peter B. Parker, if y’all catch my drift.
I won’t pay your rent until you fix this  damm door
Interesting movie for sure!
Going back to read Happy Birthday now.
As the trailer was nearing it's end, disappointment was starting to come over til Alfred Malino appeared. Saved the trailer for me.
Please stop saying bruh, but this is a good video, well done
3:53 Flash Thompson is a redhead in the ckmics Bruh.
I will just leave this here... “It is only one world in infinite universes where this impossible happiness exists, but that is what makes it so valuable.”  “Being present is being connected to All Things.”  “The multiverse isn't just parallel universes accessible thorough science. They are in each of us, a kaleidoscope made of varying perceptions.”                                                                                                                                                                                                         - The Multiverse Quotes
Maybe Mephisto won’t sell many kid friendly t-shirts for Disney/Sony. I don’t think we will ever see him with that name in order to avoid offending anyone. They rename Slave I so …
The timing for when doctor strange messes up the spell is going to match up perfectly with wanda becoming scarlet witch and kang realising something isn't right IM CALLING IT
This is going to be the best spider man ever
Thanks for the heavy lifting
Doubt that's Matt Murdock in the interrogation room. Slamming down papers is a classic "bad cop" intimidation move
Me: is watching spider man trailer breakdown YouTube: *plays Spider-Man trailer ad* 😔
3:46
Isnt Cox yall see the big fat belly?
Teaser
I think Dr. Oc was talking to Andrew Garfield Spiderman, because he says "hello Peter" as if they are familiar with each other.
Toby Maguire best spiderman ever toby in this movie=best spiderman movie ever
Hello, you are trending number 2 in canada, right next to the trailer.
Looks like a fun film.  Can't wait for it.
“Blink and you’ll miss it” when discussing Murdoch had me in stitches
They have to put mephisto in the MCU at some point  They introduced ghost rider in agents of shield so why wouldn’t they add the devil himself  You can’t have ghost rider without mephisto and zarathos  GIVE US MEPHISTO
Is it December yet? This will indeed break the internet, so excited!
Let’s go! So ready for this. It’s going to be a great Christmas.
Incredible trailer. Can't wait for the multiverse to finally start! I wonder if this will introduce mutants.
A simple "Hello Peter" makes us reminisce what happened 17 years ago and the past events of Spider-Man.
It looks so good!
Man as much as I want Charlie in the MCU, don't do that. Don't give me hope. Super hyped for this film already, I don't need a let down moment like with Wandavision XD
I dont think that Strange is the one that broke the multiverse. I think that his spell hapened as Loki (Sylvi) stabs Kang. That made the multiverse branched. MCU version of Strange isnt as OP as the comics. And from my perspective, Strange would not stand a chance against Wanda now. Let alone broke the multiverse using a spell that erase memories.
Can't wait to see this movie
Dr octopus will help Peter instead of destroying him, against Electro and Green Goblin
Love how Aunt May is originally on old woman. But in the modern films she’s a milf 😍
DOCTOR STRANGE IS THE DEVIL IN DISGUISE
Bro doc oc and William Defoe is ganna kill this holy shit
Tobey or Andrew aren't in the cast credits.
The thing to remember about the Sanctum is that most of the stuff in it isn't just random furniture or brickabracka, those are almost all very delicate magical artifacts.  Strange can't just whirlwind them around the room, he could break open a vase that unleashes an evil spirit, or he might tear threads off of the magic carpet of meditation or something... my point is, cleaning up the Sanctum isn't like cleaning up your average living room.  At least that's my theory anyway.
I have missed original spider man so much.... Wow... This will be my first movie in theater after lockdown
Dr Strange, when the spell goes wrong, is thrown into the madness of the multiverse and the Dr Strange that remains is a not a good guy.
A blonde Indian. Lol. So gay looking.
Doc oct made me goosebumps. One of my favorite villain in the movies
Nice uncharted reference
I’m so excited for this, I only wish we could have gotten two or three true solo movies before we go full on multiverse with Tom, he’s yet to prove himself as an individual hero
I can’t wait till this movie comes out
Could that not be Strange? How did he go from "protecting your reality, douchebag" to "sure, I'll clear people's  memories"?
Why isn't Spider Man being helped by the Avengers. Where's Pepper and Happy
This looks epic! Can they just please confirm Garfield and Maguire now though 👀
3:57 am i supposed to believe this guy bullies anybody??? he looks like a luke warm cup of soy milk.... look at flash thompson in tobeys spider and i believe that dude was a bully
Do we “know” that Charlie Cox is in the film? Pretty sure that hasn’t been confirmed. Also, please never say “bruh” again. Seriously mate, no way should you be using slang that’s so far from your roots. Please come home.
I havent watched the video yet so I dont know if this is talked about, but I swear I see a Green Goblin like grenade
I was telling my friend last night what if peter doesn’t break the spell what if at that moment wanda becomes the scarlet witch and then the timeline breaks and thats why the spell shits the bed
When I saw Doc Oc I just screamed so freaking loud and hard like my voice went away like I just couldn’t when I saw him 🔥
Everybody seems to forget the one and only character needed for this multiverse movie.... J. JONAH JAMESON returning to get a picture of Spiderman
My random guess is that they will have Sandman betray the bad guys and help Spider-Man
Fantastic trailer.
#30 Trending in South Africa
Bummer if you aren't interested in watching 420+ marvel tie-ins... But looks like fun all the same.
I been really wanting a box set. Awesome video! Cannot wait for this movie!
I could be wrong but I’m pretty sure there are police lights in the window when the camera walks in on Peter and may
I fear that they will bring in too many villains and make the story very convoluted!
Pov: When you clicked you got Spiderman far from home ad
right as I clicked this video i got a spiderman no way home ad
I don't think that was Matt Murdock who slammed down the files due to the fact that you can see the dude walking into the room and, unlike Matt Murdock, he didn't have the stick that Matt Murdock uses in the Daredevil series.
If you pause the actual trailer at 2.27, when the lightning bolt strikes you can see black spider man at the right bottom corner and another spider man wearing his usual red and blue on the left bottom corner. Toby and Holland are confirmed 😆
Dont expect too much about the spidey trio, too much expectations can lead to disappointment
How about Flash Thompson going blonde seeming to defend Peter. Kinda cool.
When doc ock says “hello Peter”, he may not be talking to Tom Holland spider man. But perhaps tobey Maguire as this is the “Peter” he would recognize.
I’m tryna think who will be the 6th member of the Sinister 6? We’ve got Doc Ock, Green Goblin, Sandman, Electro and The Lizard. WHO IS THE LAST MEMBER 😫
All this seems forced. They can't even let Tom do his own thing without sharing the screen with someone else. There r so many other way they could've done the story. Just hope they don't ruin Andrew
I want Spider Ham
14:53 what is the difference between this new iron spider suit than what came before? tbh I don't see any difference.
If they do what I hope they're doing this movie is going to be insane 🤯🤯
Did anyone see when Peter goes to see strange  as they’re walking to turn the fire place on there’s marks in the snow as peters walking towards strange!!!😱😱😱
Please just give us Christopher Walken as Mephisto.
I don't think that was the real Dr Strange. He's not that careless.
I feel like the only one who thinks og Harry Osborn was the one who said “be careful whatchu wish for parker”
the people that walk in on peter and may is the police because in the backround you can see red and blue lights
Everyone keeps saying Wong is going to Shang-Chi here...but this movie comes out 2 months after Shang-Chi...
i think that scene with Strange conducting that spell is just a ruse. I think Strange is doing that for Peter to realize for himself that he actually doesn't want to reverse the identify crisis - i dont think Strange would risk opening up a multiversal event
Couldn’t get tony in this film, so we got his look alike
Hello Peter
The best Flash Tompson is from the Amazing Spider-Man imo
These time stamps are horrible!
2:42 Matt Murdock doesn't have a belly
At 4:45 you can see that they are police who is coming for them in apartment when he is with his aunt cause you can see at the walls behind red and blue lights like sirens lights from police cars. 🤔
Introduction of beyonder?
I wonder if the lizard and sandman are back as wel
Mephisto confirmed
Why doesn't Pete just tell the truth. I'm sure that he can prove everything by showing the files of Tony employing Mysterio back in the past. And I'm sure the drones record everything they see so getting them files and proving the fake should be easy. Weird how the movie just ignored these ways to save Peter.
Mr Ditcovich has to make an appearance that would be the greatest ever
Me and doctor strange have the same mug nice 😂😂
If the other 2 Peter are not there am not buying
Definitely not Matt Murdock as that gut has Froggy written all over it.  So you, our friendly neighborhooded SpoilerMan, need to shut the hell up. HAHA... j/k with ya!
This movie looks AMAZING ! 🕷️
I hope Tom doesn’t stop playing Spider-Man
the bookmarks/chapters on the video are wrong
What if we get all the spiderman from the first movie but it plays out like the animated spider man movie. Its titled no way home so what if that means that one of these spider men cant go back to their timeline. So one will have to stay. Tom Holland could be seriously injured and that's why he cant do it. So maybe that's when mileies Morales will come in and help them.
Doc Ock is actually talking to Toby's spiderman calling it.
Wild theory. At some point during a fight with electro a small kid is effected. Maybe his name is Miles.
The scene with aunt may and Peter on the couch look like the police coming to arrest Parker look at the windows and you can see the red and blue lights
Tom Holland has the black suit on from Spider-Man 3, can we talk about that?
This movie is going to connect to strange new movie
Evil Dr strange.   Different haircuts.  Cgi wigs
i think da sinister six is back or it’s just 3 of them in this
Endgame script confirms Wong was snapped away also
this might be up there with Black panther as best solo marvel movie honestly but im also a Spidey Bias...
I have to wonder if Willem Dafoe is going to actually show his face or if we're just going to get his masked self. We can hope we get the full treatment for all these actors!
So it’s seems everyone didn’t notice the X-men and Fantastic 4 references?
The new MJ is a fake MJ... MJ has red hair lol
So Tobey or no
Dr oc talking to bully Maguire
Franklin K Lane
I highly doubt that an older black woman in a scene would correlate to her being miles’ mom but who knows I guess 🤷🏽‍♂️
Bro imagine Tom is getting his ass beat and Toby swings in and starts fucking shit up 😂
7:09 - Dr. Strange on winter outfit! lol!
Hi there
I cant even Express how excited this movie makes me, literally feel like I'm going to explode
Doctor Strange is sus.
I got the ad for thhe movie whhile watching this
Rent Free like Peter Parker was a Goku level joke
Next movie  Spiderman: home away from home
You missed a scene where he’s running in his gold and black suit
I wish this was just Toms Movie 😞
You literally see the guy in the white shirt at 2:23 , in your own video...  Matt appears in this scene but that guy is probably just that police.
Why can’t they just make a good story with Spider-Man with some emotional impact and character development? After a couple of story’s where Spider-Man is at center, I am more than welcoming to the idea of Spider-Man exploring The Avengers,Europe and the multiverse. I am frustrated that Marvel haven’t built Tom’s Spider-Man from the ground up, just rushed him out like a action figure without much depth
What if Strange is really Mephisto in disguise.
I was watching this and literally got an add that was just the trailer…
Wanda is not evil. Don’t make her a villain.
I'm a little uncomfortable with this. Yes, I was excited seeing Dr. Octopus and Green Goblin back again by Alfred Molina and Willem DaFoe, but I also remembered that when movies rely heavily on nostalgia on announcement, they do this to compensate for bad writing. And Disney's been on a trend of nostalgic/bad writing movies as of late.
Spider-man No Way Home trailer has spiderman suits and masks on. We don’t know if it’s Tom, Tobey or Andrew. 🤔
So hyped, can’t wait for that opening night at the movies feeling!
This looks amazing
This “Hello, Peter” isn’t meant for Tom Holland’s Peter Parker. Because how would Tobey Maguire’s Doc Ock recognize him?
That infinity earth suit looks like a mature spider man. That could be Tobey!
I hope tobey will be back❤❤❤
This most definitely has me HYPE!!
The falling buildings also reminds me of into the spider verse
I hope Andrew and toby appear  even for a small cameo
That persons gut doesn’t look like the abs of Charlie Cox
My excited is immeasurable my day is FANTASTIC
In that first scene with Peter and MJ on the roof, that is not a natural or comfortable way to lay down but it does resemble a "4" I wonder if there will be a few fantastic 4 Easter eggs
HAHA 2 billion mark in box office??? No way, i fcking blame this pandemic.
Thank you for immediately start describing the spoilers alfred said without giving a spoiler warning 🤦‍♀️
14:19 that box Peter has…
That guy is to fat to be Matt
Strange definitely er seems strange when he first winks at Peter! Something seems a little off? 🤔 Amazing trailer tho! 👌
The guy in white shirt and black tie is definitely NOT Matt Murdock. Just look at the size of the stomach. It's just another cop. Why would his attorney be slammed stuff down so hard?
Matt Murdock really let himself go.
This movie has me more excited than endgame and infinity war
if MJ forgets that peter is spider man , she will also forget their relationship..............
What if its Foggy slamming the papers down... He is a bit bigger than Matt...
I just realized, if this goes as we think it goes. Norman Osborne may or may not live another day, thus Hobgoblin. Therefore Symbiotes. And if so Venom.
If Daredevil and Spiderman team up to take on the sinister 6...I'm standing up for the whole movie
Unless daredevil gained like 20 lbs in the gut area, I'm pretty sure it's not Matt.
This bout to be the best christmas ever for fans of Spiderman. This could be the best Spiderman story not only in movies but maybe just in general. I cant remember a more hyped comic, movie or video game about Spiderman than this movie. Damn near every single Spiderman villain from all of his franchises throughout the years. Cameos from Dr. Strange, possibly Daredevil, the return of J Jonah Jameson, and who knows what other marvel characters. This will be insane
I get People are excited for Andrew and Tobey but I don’t really think it’s fair to fully discard Tom Holland because of it. It is HIS movie after all.
I saw the green dude the one from the regular spiderman
Nice
Screens crush is better show, your accent is fake
The lizards intro is gonna be scary watch their gonna try to make in terrifying
The civil war arc didn't end with aunt may getting shot. It ended with cap getting shot
Can't wait to see this masterpiece movie!
The video is so beautiful, I really like it, thank you for sharing
Hero saves the world, everyone loves him. Stops a man dressed as an Eagle, good job. One villain dies - instantly unfriended  Lol the life of Batman and Spiderman, and some heroes.
Why is Doctor Strange, I mean Stephen, wearing the Eye of Agamotto? If it no longer holds the time stone, what's the point of it in the MCU? I know the eye has different uses in the comics, but nothing like that has been shown for the MCU. It's an odd choice and I hope they address it.
I m so hyped
I can’t even explain the feelings I get after watching this trailer!
This is film is good to use in the WC🚾
Very cool trailer can't wait !
Looks awesome. I need to rewatch some of the Spidermans.
Tobey 🙄🙄🙏🙏
I kinda want the Charlie Cox rumors to be true but maaan this movie will Have a lot going on!
I am so excited for this one bro
I think Doc-Ock is talking to Tobey McGuire
thats not a hair Dr. STrange used ( i dont think). Looks more like a liquid hes pouring into the basin. Hes holding a small flask. Reminds me of the memories being poured into the Pensive in the Harry Potter Movies. You're welcome ;)
Cannot wait to see Alfred molina again as doc ock
Movie looks great I cannot wait!
The spell to forget his identity was not taken from One More Day, it was in One Moment In Time, where it was also Strange who did it. Mephisto had nothing to do with that one.
I really really really really really hope this doesn't go the way of Spider-Man 3 and get so overloaded with Villains that the story is a mess.
This movie is going to be so epic!!
If they manage to cross over into the cartoon verse and we see Nicolas Cage's Noir Spiderman I'm going to shit myself
From the moment I saw the pumpkin bomb and the series one Doc Ock I was reeeeeeeeaaaaaaddddddyyyyyyyy!
And guess who'll be saving up to go to the cinema when it releases?
Who else will be doing a spiderman marathon in preparation for this?!
My only question is are they back for a cameo or are we getting a live action spider verse after this with Emma Stone or another Gwen Stacy, washed up Peter, etc. Imagine if this kicks off Tobey's/Sam Raimi's Spiderman 4 and AMS3
That hello Peter is fosho talking to Tobey
That’s the same cop not Matt Murdock
Definitely not Matt Murdock the guy slamming the papers down on the table has a pop Belly
Hello Peter… No this is Patrick!
This first  trailer is great, and  I don't  want to anymore  trailers so I don't  spoil  the movie  for myself  because  I'm very excited  to see this.
If they don't have Tobey and Andrew in it I will be so sad
I cried like something stupid but beautiful trailer 😂😂😂⚡💥🔥
Mcu: there you got your trailer                                  Fans: where is Tobey                                                      Mcu: you got your trailer now you want tobey bruh kill me
Ouuu im ready to see who plays miles
If the gift from Dr. Strange (if Peter is even given a gift) turns out to be a reunion with Uncle Ben it may rival the tears shed from the line "Mr. Stark I don't feel so good"
We want tobyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!
I think I speak for everyone when I say; All we want is more of Paul Giamatti's Rhino!
i cant wait for the movie
I’m excited for this but I think I’m a little bit more excited for venom let there be carnage
I actually can't wait for the promo clips that will come out before the release!!!
Great analysis
Now that the spiderman trailer is out, we can now get back to being hyped for SHANG-CHI.
I want this movie to be 6 hours long
I got an ad that was the No Way Home Trailer in the middle of this lol
"Blink and you'll miss it" was never a problem for Matt Murdoch
It's Not Murdock. Look at his belly.
I have a feeling both Andrew and Toby's Spider-Man will appear in the film without any prior reveal, to shock the audience
Well done noticing things that I missed love your video
One does not say "Pennsylvania Station" referring to "Penn Station" while in NY 😜  Dude, ALWAYS love your breakdowns! 👍🏽
congrats on 2nd on trending
I can’t wait for the 360 pan of all the sinister 6 looking at each other in a circle after being properly formed from alternate universes
That's not Matt! Whoever that guy is, he is FAT!
Anyway Devil in disguise can allude to mephisto or daredevil
Look at the belly on that cop.its definitely not Matt Murdock! If he does make an appearance he better be suited up!!!
Hey Heavy Spoilers, Dr. Strange may not be the real Strange, it might be Nightmare or Mordo in disguise. He acts kind of weird in the trailer. So you may be right and it is Nightmare or Mordo instead in place of Mephisto
Am I the only one who watched this video to see if there is any chance for tobey to be there ?
Btw the guy that looks to be daredevil has too much of a muffin belly, but hey he might have put on a few pounds 🤷‍♂️
14:15 “Strange clearly catches up to Peter at one point and he pushes his ASStro projection out of his body” 😂😂
I don’t want mephisto in the mcu
Y'all are stupid thinking that's Charlie Cox, the dude clearly has a gut.
So Daredevil ends up Peter's lawyer I'm sure.
I don't think that the guy slamming files is Matt Murdock. Look at his tummy, too chubby to fit in the DD suit. Also that was a bit to aggressive for Matt's lawyer persona.
So it’s Doctor Strange all along!!!
When u what ??? And she keeps going …. 😂 hahahahahaha … you are a official Gangsta now and invited to the hood barbecue/ block party … ( don’t bring any side dishes we got this covered )  …. ( hold up bring something to drink ) …  Hahahaha his eye was broke  … 😂
Would've been cool if Peter sensed the guy slamming the papers on the table
Ty for spoiling
Damnn I just want Andrew to appear in itt
YES THANK U FOR THIS I ALREADY GUESSED HALF OF THEM 🙏
The green goblin laugh can be heard too when you see the pumpkin bomb
*It's time to repent and seek JESUS* .He gave his life, and suffered the wrath of the Father in the cross, to save you from a eternal hell. For God loves you, but the sin must be punished. On the third day He raised from the death, showing to the world that He is God. So stop sinning and clean your life. He returns soon to judge and destroy the sinners. *Read the Bible.* *THE END IS NEAR.*
😂the Mitchell’s poppying up.
that Green Goblin laugh sent chills. I wasn't ready lol!!
I need this movie to be 4 hours long...plz
Dr. Strange is acting kinda strange... this might sound like a stretch and wishful thinking but what if Dr. Strange is actually Mephisto in disguise?  That brings a double meaning to that Devil in disguise sign at 3:41
I wish my birthday was December 17
Isn’t this supposed to be loosely related to Wanda and strange’s next movie?  What’s the chance she alters reality for Peter after strange fails? Maybe in the post credits scene.
So.. why the f. Dr. Strange do that? Dont look like him...
I'm very excited for this I'm supprised you didn't mention the 1990s Spiderman cartoon in the last Season I think it's 3 of the final episodes all of the different Spiderman from the different multiverse have to take down Spider Carnage and it end's up with Uncle Ben talking to Spider Carnage to tell him to stop.
Over a million view in a few hours wow
I hope they don't show Tobey or Andrew in any of the marketing. It would be cool to see them in a trailer, but a million times cooler to see them together for the first time in the movie.
Toby and Andrew going to be there and if not war machine and Loki is going to help him and mj will be Spider-Woman   Save this for later
Dr strange could of been better if he was a little darker, more gritty
The lights look like Happy
That's not Matt Murdock. That guy is chunkier than Matt.
This is going to be INCREDIBLE
God I wanna see the goblin so bad
I thought Charlie cox specifically said he wasnt in this movie. Was he lying?
That's definitely a cop, not Matt Murdock.
In Loki, Flash(the non-blonde version) is shown being taken to the TVA. Maybe this is a replaced Flash 🤷?
I don’t think that was Dr. Conners in the back.. instead I think it was May Gargins Scorpion 👀
soooo what happened to Vulture and Scorpion??
Im kinda hoping that maybe tom hardys venom shows up to help, either they confirm hes always been part of the mcu in the background or they pull him from his own univerce he helps for a bit but like in venom 2 the symbiote reproduces and leaves behind a new symbiote that at some point bonds to peter, and evenutally creates the MCU. venom, or maybe it goes straight to flash thompson. Who than becomes agent venom and joins the reforming shield
It would be interesting to see uncle ben
13:28 sorry?
Is it free to re-upload 😁
I didn't even spot the Lizard, I was just so hyped up for Doc Ock and Green Goblin being back!
Anyone else notice lizard?
I guess the first seen is the last seen 🥴🥴
Man no love for andrew... He was the perfect spiderman people
Strange: Stop tampering with the spell! Peter: I missed the part where that’s my problem
Holy cow, Tobey's Spider-Man is twenty years old?! Jesus...I'm old...
Aunt May and Peter (Holland obvs) are definitely looking at the other 2 Peter Parkers from the couch!
the film should last 4 hours to show everything there is to see
Rent free!
Damn man...you give make me go crazy.. 😂😂
The green goblin bomb!
How do you know that Charlie Cox WILL be in the movie? So far, it’s been just speculation.
Finally!
I haven’t watch any spiderman movie since SM3 Once they changed the actor I stopped watching. And yea, I have no idea about mcu universe too 🤣 I’m old school, only watched stand alone hero movies like iron man, batman, superman etc… but this is the first one that may do it for me, so many vibes from the originals, and have one of my favorites in it too, dr strange.
Will Mephisto finally show here? Spidey to do a bargain?
That doesn’t feel like the real Dr. Strange, he wouldn’t do something so dangerous for some kid
Strange is acting and looking a little…stranger that usual. The slick back hair. The carelessness. I think this COULD either be a variant Dr. Strange from the multiverse (possibly the evil Strange from What If) or it’s *Duh Duh Duuuuuhhhhh* *whispers* Mephisto! 😈😈😈
*I believe they bid Tobey and Andrew from us in the trailer so they could surprise us*
12:33 watch closely right side of the bottom.
Hey, shut the hell up, Heavy Spoilers' mate...
Imagine if all the gwen’s come back to
Dudes there are no spoilers only knowledge. And knowledge is power which apparently some are afraid of. Remember in the age of information ignorance is a choice.
I'm not crazy, at 2:25 the cops are aiming ay Venom, I'm not crazy
:,0 can it be December now?
What if that first look at peter standing on the bridge when the iron spider arms first come out isnt holland
I can see all the Spider-Man’s vs the sinister 6
The amount of possible characters here will be mind-blowing! Doc Oc & the Green Goblin?! Cant wait to see it!
FINALLY GOBLIN
The unbecoming day ignificantly want because kitten clearly gather after a laughable iron. past, unbecoming anthony
What if doctor strange is somehow mysterio disguised as strange
I think i had happy birthday issue as a kid, remember i had comic where Peter sees his life from when spider bited him till he dies
This movie is gonna give us some, if not all, of the Sinister Six I just know it
Just imagine watching this movie and you see Tom Tobey and Andrew swinging into a scene together
Hm, I don't think that's Matt Murdock. You see the guy briefly walking into the interrogation room & he's walking without a cane & without glasses.
Thats Not Charlie Cox in the interrogation room, body is not same shape as Charlie's probably just another detective 🙄. Making something of nothing as usual
Releases trailer Me: Another one
Ha
Psyched if that is Charlie cox, but the actor slamming the papers down has a gut, doubt it's Charlie but I can't wait to find out!
How can it be Murdock? In the previous frame, we can see a guy walking in with the police officer, wearing white shirt and tie, no glass, no white cane... I dont think Murdock goes around without a white cane....
4:28 Charlieboy_o is in the trailer! Omg i love his tiktoks!
DECEMBER CANT COME SOON ENOUGH
You were right. We called you a madman
I'm okay with Sony not releasing another trailer after this one. This one isn't the best, but it's a nice tease to the movie without spoiling too much.
So Tom tries to help them get back to their universe without dying, strange stops him and maybe at the same time they find out he’s Spider-Man so they feel like he doesn’t want to help them for that reason and try and kill em?
I'm so hyped for this movie
I wonder if Sandman is protecting Peter from electro in that shot, I mean he was kinda redeemed by asking forgiveness from Tobey's Peter.
that is not Matt Murdock's body .. :)
I think they could potentially tease venom at the end of this film. So strange’s spell makes everyone on Earth forget Peter is spiderman, now venom isn’t actually from earth so he could potentially still remember the fact Peter is spiderman if he and Eddie were watching the news during the events of the film. Eddie would’ve forgotten from the spell but venom would remember. So Eddie could be looking for work because he is a reporter so potentially venom could remind him about how spiderman on tv is peter Parker but no one seems to remember and could be a news good story if they go after him.  I reckon that could be a potential lead for introducing the plot for the inevitable spiderman and venom face off.
IM SO EXCITED TO WATCH THIS
If Dr. Strange erased Ned’s memories too, I bet Osborne convinced Ned to become Hobgoblin. That’s probably why Battalon got jacked right before they start filming. He might’ve been the one that blew up their apartment that Happy was looking at.
will the 6th member be vulture or mysterio tho
its finally here
Ok holy shit guys. What if they age up Toby McGuire a bit and have him play Uncle Ben? It’d be more in line with the current Aunt May’s age and the og Spider-Man films had the best Uncle Ben scene
Ah the red one!
The guy you claim to be Matt Murdock is too chubby to be Matt
Nice review!
Congrats Paul! I really hope this movie is at least 3 hours long!
This film is gonna be pog
I honestly love the trailer this is the Spider-Man drama people have been looking for in MCU Spider-Man. I feel like this movie will completely change my opinion on MCU Spider-Man to possibly be my favorite, but only december will tell.
At the 2:27 mark you can see Spiderman and his black and gold costume for the first time flipping away from the lightning and the sand bottom right corner
If that’s not Murdock, then it has to be the detective he was speaking with. Same white button up and same black tie
That trailer was amazing, I literally jumped off my bed
This is just epic
The biggest question is where is shield when you need them
If this film don’t break the box office, I don’t know what will
Tobey to Tom be like: "I missed the part where that's my problem!"
This man and the sub title 😂  I am dead 💀 solid af boi
Movie looks awesome, can’t wait for December too!
Over a million views! My guy!
This will be the highest grossing movie of 2021 💯
I am so liking this idea of dr strange and Peter as a team, I wish they show strange equally as Peter, then the movie is gonna be epic
I shrieked in excitement
IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE I CANT EVEN 😭
My gramson likes marbel movies but I prefer Jon wayne wstern cowboy movies
Ir could be Tony Stark talking to Peter for a little time instead of Ben
Unless Matt Murdock has put on weight that's not him
I want to be excited. But Peter was talking and therefore the great Doctor Strange messed up his spell.. Really? You're pulling in these great villains from the first movies, might be just as bad as a Disney animation remade. I don't wanna be negative. But don't get too hyped. This might make no sense and be utter shait. But like I said, I want to be excited. I just can't find it.
Since they say it's Hollands "Endgame" what if he dies or just get moved to the Sonyverse and Miles is introduced in maybe an end credits scene and he's the new MCU Spider-man
This trailer is literally like recreational drugs every time I watch it let alone when it’s broken down
I’m excited for this! Hopefully December comes sooner!
That was definitely not Mat Murdock. Just look at his fat waist. Daredevil is fit obviously.
Weird I see Tom Holland as spider man but not as Peter Parker idk y 🤔
What is the box Peter is holding?
I'm tired of the STUPID CROSSOVERS MULTIVERSE!
Hopefully, all the agony of waiting will be worth it. 🕷🕸🤞🏻
I dont think its Charlie Cox/Daredevil  because he looks way to fat.
Can't wait for the movie to come out !!
Excellent work
Dude sometimes your jokes really are so fucking hilarious "you know no im somewhat of an idiot myself" fuckin a mate I'm dying 🤣
Man this movie will be crazy
I just want a Tom Holland Spiderman and Ryan Reynolds Deadpool in a movie together
The income that you're gonna get from all these views should do it your welcome
“ I am very hype right now😐” says heavy spoilers
Has anyone else noticed the black Spider-Man suit behind the big rock in the part where the lightning strikes?
Could be foggy?
Maybe we wont get get Andrew Garfield but if i get a Tobey Mcguire scene where hes dancing with Tom hOlland for no specific reason, best moment of the 2021
I cant believe no one notice how peter was laying down and the beginning... clearly making a 4 with his legs.. so Fantastic 4 confirmed
Doc oc, oh man I’m hyped for him
i feel i just got the movie spoiled for me

There is a fricking tiktoker cameo tf !!!!!!
Wait a second when Tom was in that black Spider-Man suit in that Lunch room could it be that he was in Toebys Spider-Man’s high school lunch room?! That’s problem why he was running and everyone looked confused because he was in a different dimension.
I noticed sandman too :)
Congrats on the midnight blowup i hope you reach a million followers soon
We need a its pizza time post credit scene
I enjoyed the Han Solo reference. It’s true. All of it. Awesome.   Also RIP Mafisto
In Ragnarok, he opened a portal for Thor. Imagine if that would have gone wrong
This is probably the first marvel film I've been hyped for other than spiderverse since well the hulk or original spiderman series.. bringing back the OG characters is 100% going to make this one of the better marvel films.  Kinda makes me wish they'd do something with the old hulk films, tbf also want Billy crystal to play Marks dad, they just look so alike
14:19 Peter carrying a box
tobey fans: is tobey in this movie marvel: you'l get your answer if you buy the damn tickets!
Trailer looks great
7:12 I think that’s venom suit from spider man three but I could be wrong
TBH: I wasnt that hyped, but after this breakdown i am. You Showed me the light :)
I don’t think that is Matt Murdock, he’s got a bit of a gut on him. Unless Daredevil has let himself go.
It looks so exciting! I can't wait to see more!!!
This will also effect loki, in season 2 with different types of loki
Thanks for a great video!
If this turns into Spiderverse, Strange and Daredevil VS The Sinister Six....I will not know what to do with my hands....
Imagine a scene of Tom's Spider-man fighting Doc Ock,, Green Goblin and Electro....he's outnumbered and struggling to keep up. Just when we think he might finally be defeated, we hear off screen..."PIZZA TIME!"...and in swings Tobey's Spider-man to save the day. This better be in the film.
Where's Toby and Andrew damnit
idk, that guy we're thinking is Murdock might have too much of a gut to be Daredevil.
I don’t believe that is the real Dr. Strange!
It’s the OG Doc Oc (from the Maguire Spideman films). I’m now extremely happy.
That line “hello Peter” isn’t being said to Tom it’s got to be to Tobey, how would Doc Ock know that he was called Peter? If that’s the first time they’ve seen each other? The only way It could be to Tom is if Tom is suited up with the mask on and Doc Ock assumes it’s Tobeys Peter? If that makes sense?
Best trailer ever
Instead of the lizard what if it’s scorpion because there was orange in the tail so I think it could be a new design for jt
Your breakdown got me even more excited for this than I already was!
I'm really hoping doc oc is saying "hello Peter" to toby. Tom and Toby look nothing alike, How the hell is he going to say that the tom's peter? 😂
Great Video as always! - Although I do apologize in having to disagree that the guy slamming down the files in front of Parker is Matt Murdock - if you look closely at his figure - he just isn't in the "shape" that I believe Daredevil should be considering he is a boxer - maybe more along the lines of KingPin? Therefore I think is just another cop in the vein of Chief Clancy Wiggum. I do, however, believe he will show up in that scene.
Peter is going to end up in the TVA
👌👍😍🥰
Don't think Murdoch would have that big of a gut!! 🤣🤣🤣
YOU ARE NUMBER 2 ON TRENDING LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Is William Defoe playing Green goblin hope it's not the amazing Spiderman version
Please tell me why I’m in the film ‘Charlie cox’ 🤨🤨
tobey maguire will be in this movie? I have a feeling that he will be in the movie
WTF is the written comment about "she keep sucking".  Dude, not cool.  Not the first time you say sexist things. Dude, not cool.
This is sooo good
What if this whole thing is a ruse and a part of Mysterio's plan/revenge
I really hope they bring Charlie Cox/Daredevil into this movie , seeing Daredevil and Spiderman team up would be so fucking awesome
It's not Matt Murdock, the guy slamming the files has some weight around his waist area
I’m calling it now. The “Dr Strange” in the snow-coated sanctuary is NOT Stephen Strange.  His hair is wrong.  Ever since joining the sorcerers or Kamar-Taj, he’s had this little hair flick over his forehead. Even during the final battles of his movie, Infinity War, & Endgame, it’s been there. Even later in the trailer, when he’s shifting Peter to the astral plane, he has it…  However, at that point he’s got it all combed slick back, and the white hair by his temples isn’t as pronounced.  I’m betting it’s an imposter, disguised to look like Strange, and whole has been manipulating things around Peter to coerce him into this wish, even if Peter doesn’t realise it.
What happened to them wanting an authentic reaction and not dropping a trailer?
doc oc should of been like wtf your not peter
That guy slamming the papers looks like he's got a beer belly.  I guess Matt's been letting himself go since he got his show canceled.
We are reaching fan service overload
Is nobody going to mention that pumpkin bomb?
Oh my god yes! The return of the old fashioned theatrical villain <3
3:38, I think that's the group arriving at school, not Peter handing himself in (same shirt and backpack)
At this point, MCU vs DCEU is just child abuse.
that's not matt murdock!  not with that belly fat 🤣
I would hate for Scarlet Witch to be an villain. I think that it would be better for her to be misunderstood and then have to work with Dr Strange to defeat Mephisto
It’s not Marvel if superheroes don’t fight each other. So excited.
I hope this movie will be marvelous and not end up like spiderman 3 and tasm 2
Tobey
*11:01** THERE IS TWO SPIDERMAN ARE FIGHTING WITH ELECTRO... ON THE RIGHT SIDE WE CAN SEE BLACK ONE AND ON THE LEFD SIDE BESIDE THE ELECTRIC TOWER THERE IS ANOTHER RED AND BLUE SPIDER TOO...!*
I don’t think that’s Charlie Cox, did you see that tummy!?
No 2 on trending on the UK. Nice!
Toby!!!!! Better come back
We don't care about the villains we care about Toby and Andrew now do your dam job sonny and fix this dam door
I'm so ready for this movie
I just love how NOBODY was talking about "MoonKnight" being somehow introduced into the Spider-Verse too !! Did you guys not know that "Oscar Isaac" was that bad ass ??
Peters black and gold suit looks wakandan
since this comment gets snowed under in another comment, ill leave it here.  the Tom Holland spider suit up change happens before, not after Doc Ock's arrival. however, the Doc Ock scene still is in that same situation, it's at the same place. He won't be talking to Tobey, but to Tom Holland's spider man. so indeed, when Doc Ock is saying 'hello peter' - it happens when he is already suited up. The order and situation is confusing, but Holland will be dealing with more than just Goblin and Ock at the highway scene. The order of the scenes is mixed up.   I won't reveal too much from what will happen, but 'something important' leads to have an incident and Peter being at the freeway (bridge), standing first alongside the SUV with the lady in the back (i won't reveal who she is, but let's just say there's a reason she is being chauffeured), with whom Peter will have a 'conversation' with. The 'situation' continues, Holland then jumps on top of the car, and changes into his spider suit. Doc Ock will arrive 'violently' tearing up the freeway, and introduce himself to Holland 'hello peter'. He'll have to save the occupants of said car. Right there and then Goblin will appear too with his signature laugh, causing the explosion convo. Peter (Holland) will save people in a car which went into the water (the river below off the bridge), and this is the scene where he turns around to face them with his extra spider legs exposed.   That's all I can 'safely' reveal but realise that there is a situation that leads up to this point (it's not that hard to imagine what), and that Peter (Holland) is not just facing Doc Ock, but Goblin right there and then too. And without going too far, there is more happening than 'just' those two villains. Obviously, Peter will face the fact that they know who he is - which, according to him should not be possible if Strange's spell would have worked 'correctly'. I'll leave it up to the next trailer / and or movie to expose whether Holland will face them alone, or gets help.   There's a huge cast of characters including Strange, Daredevil (Matt Murdock), Dr. Octopus, Green Goblin, Electro, Jonah Jameson, and more very important cast members whom will have key roles in the movie - some will surprise you even more, i might add. I will keep it to myself whether Tobey and Garfield will appear in the movie.  That said, despite this being quite a big 'teaser', this is done delibaretely. the movie will be MASSIVE. and I guarantee you it will be a gigantic box office hit. you will NOT be dissapointed.   And yes, it is a key movie for the next installments of the MCU.   Oh and, Peter is going to face some scary moments with an interesting 'adversary'. I'll leave you at that.
Whooop whoop only 4 months to go baby!
I WANT TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS MOVIE
wow 1M views!! so happy for you Heavy Spoilers!!!
I can't wait for this
heavy spoilers: give me rent    me: ILL GIVE YOU THE RENT WHEN U FIX THE DAMN DOOR     jk lol im not mad im nice guy ok
I think marvel gone make Standart of spider man movie, so when sony make spiderman solo movie or crossover, people gine compare to Spiderman no way home.
Not today. Let me enjoy the trailer in peace.
I think after seeing this trailer - eh - No thanks........  I'll maybe watch it sometime on amazon prime or something 10 years from now.
I think Doctor Strange is Mephisto in disguise (remember the devil in disguise poster in the background of this trailer) or perhaps the dark version from what if, or just another multiverse version. Cause why would Stephen be this reckless with a spell? Especially after the events of Infinity War and Endgame? I just dont buy that he would be like "Yeah wink wink kid, I'll do anything for you".
That Doc Ock looks horrible. They should have never de aged him but instead left him as his actually age.
i think this Strange is a variant
Are we 100% sure that is our Dr. Strange???? I mean, the stiff-looking one-can-of-hairspray-per-hair-strand hairdo threw me completely off, not to mention the fact that our Dr. Strange would never ever grant Peter such a wish. I dunno, Paul, I definitely smell something Mephisto...
This movie looks so good!
Strange seems quite suspicious. Also in FFH it was said that strange was unavailable for help. But now here he seems quite chill and not too busy. So what was he doing then? It could be possible that THIS Dr strange is an imposter. Anyways I'm expecting more to his character in this movie cuz this will tie in the Multiverse Of Madness
No Way Home: Into the Spider-Verse
I think the 2 different lives is talking about him being peter and spidey. So tom will be like we'll if I can't be both we will get another spiderman grom another timeline to be spidey. But it goes wrong so he still has to be
Thanks my guy
Maybe that was why the ancient one was bald, so no one could tie a spell to her… 😂
ya shut the hell up it is mat
No way that's Matt Murdock, look at that man's belly size lol
Such a great once over by yourself sir, always a great time to get a full in depth version from yourself! I’m so pumped for this!!!!
“Hello Peter.” That line simultaneously gave thousands chills
Peter Parker: Uhm Doctor Strange? Can I bargain?
They better tease venom
I can’t wait to see this movie!  The trailer has me looking forward to see what theories come true
On the first episode of WandaVision, the date circled with the heart on it is August 23rd... coincidence, or was the release date for the trailer hiding in plain sight this entire time?🤯
Where is Flash lol
I don’t wanna know know if mgwires in the film as when it pops up in the cinema it will blow my mind and possibly be the best cinema experience of my life
Thank you for mentioning the Puerto Rico easter egg
I love defoes laugh being how they show he will be in the film, he was a bad ass goblin
13:27 LOL
This is so bonkers. Imagine instead of Batman and Robin - we got a batman movie which brought back the batman from the original TV show - like for kids these days that 20 year difference is about the same. While for us, it doesn’t seem all that long
This is mind-blowing! Man, you even go to Google maps to create hypothesis for the video!!! amazing! I can't wait for this movie
There’s so much here. You’re going to get me fired.
Knew there wasn't going to be 3 spidermen
Cant wait. This is going to be mind boggling
Spidey Vs Sinister 6
None of the defenders shows are canon in the mcu tho so I don't think he would be cast as daredevil
#2 on trending only behind the trailer itself, great job!
No comment on how Doctor Strange’s winter coat looks exactly like his cape?? 😂😂😂
Oh my god, I'm so happy Otto is in the movie he is my favorite spiderman villain. Peter always had a personal connection with Otto, saw him as a mentor, and then having to defeat him was really heartbreaking. Octavius has always been a really good man at heart who has just made some bad decisions.
I really hope Charlie Cox’ Daredevil is in this. He’s the one character I want to see in the film
So Dr Strange f*cked up?
If it's actor Charlie Cox...he gain weight  from his days playing  Daredevil. His waistline  is wide...dad bod.
BROOOOO 1.1M in 10 hours!! It was just at 20k 😭
I dunno if its matt Murdock based on the love handles. I would know since I stopped working remotely. Lol DAMN YOU PANDEMIC!!
i’m insanely excited for this movie
Spider-Man was my first love as far as reading comics. These Marvel movies have truly captured everything I loved about the books. I can’t wait for this film.   Love your channel. 🤘❤️
Pause the video after doc ock saying hello peter and you’ll see someone swinging in in the background
I mean happy holidays ya know!
I am so excited for the movie , but I am more excited for externals and then the next movie that has Wanda in it
Over a million views in 9 hours, damnnnnnn!   Good stuff :D
waiting for it by the minute!
That's not Matt Murdock...it looks more like Fatt Murdock!
So much HYPE IN ONLY 5 MINS!
This looks really good I cannot wait for this bro I will be straight at the movies
The idea of ALL the spidermen and villans coming together makes me creeeaaam
Can’t wait super excited I really want to see the sinister 6
Bro I am pumped
Not Matt Murdoch. That is a pudgy police officer trying to intimidate Peter, not trim and delightful Daredevil.
2:22 also shows the white shirt guy btw, can't tell if it's matt tho
The wizard lights are how Peter reconnects with Peter after he gets stuck in the multiverse. It’s towards the end of the film.  His new suit is to protect him as he no longer has his spidy senses
I swear to god even if Tobey and Andrew is a cameo that got on a lift with Tom in his suit i'd still be ok with it.  Andrew : "Nice suit" Tom : "...thanks" Tobey : "Looks uncomfortable, is it itchy?"
But will this be the final Spider-man movie?
I wonder if anyone who knows of the other spidermans identity get sucked into this universe.
Is that CARNAGE "NAGE" written on the side wall while MJ reading news paper on top of the building ?
Why the hell is Strange still wearing the Eye of agamotto?? In the comics it's something different but in the MCU it houses the time stone.....which Captain America returned in endgame?
This looks promising. Getting tired of the supes movies but ill definitely see this one
I'm starting to think that if Miles Morales is in the movie, than Tobey and Andrew will not show up, because it would too much
Tobey and Andrew could’ve easily been  hidden CGI in this
'i cannot believe he went back there' 😂😂😂
Amazing video
Everything is awesome!!!
Can’t wait for Dr. Strange: No way Home!   It’d be cool if Sony made a Spider-Man film where he isn’t another Disney characters sidekick.
I wanted to be spoiled but I didn't understand a thing
I hope Tom doesn’t do that, he’s already been enough of a fucking idiot with Edith in the last film
It was 2002 when i first saw that Green Goblins Bomb and i was only 3, im 21 now,  How old were you when you first saw that bomb or have you born yet???   😂 😂
I would love if Toby was in the movie he would do the dance from spider man 3
Can’t wait to see how they bring it together.
I swear if this gets delayed, I’m gonna be sad
I think the Doctor Strange in the trailer isn't our Doctor Strange but that's the evil one from the "What If" series. I think our Doc got his Astral Projection ripped out of his body and the evil one took over his body, while our guy is stuck in the Astral Plane unable to communicate. I don't think Doctor Strange is going to cast a spell over the world if it would cause chaos...that train scene on the trailer looks like a fight between Strange and Spidey. And if you're wondering what's the box Spidey is holding, apparently, it’s the box where all the multiverse villains are (Doc Oc, Goblin, etc.) and maybe Spidey stole that box to stop all chaos and Strange try to stop him.
1 millliooooonnn viewssss well done brooossss
The fact that strange accepts this risky offer despite Wong’s warning makes me think that this isn’t Strange. Remember the evil version of dr strange that we saw in the trailers of  what if. Just a thought
I'm not this hyped for a Spider-Man movie since the very first one with Tobey! :D
Nothing but Goosebumps looking at this trailer 🥳
The TVA has a lot of work to do to fix this.
If they don’t do the pointing spiderman meme when/if Tobey and Andrew turn up. It’ll be a failure for me😂
So this is Toms last Spiderman film? 😔
This is awesome!
The sand in the trailer is sand man
i don't know what to say , spiderman has always been fav. superhero since childhood but this is madness , the movie better longer than 2 hours to clear everything in the movie
Oh yeah, bringin back og doc oc!
I'm just so excited for this!  Doctor Octopus is a favorite villain of mine.
Daredevil might be in it bc in the classic 1994-1997 Spider-Man cartoon series he is in it as the daredevil to be peters lawyer
That wasn't Sandman. It was dirt exploding due to the electric attacks of Electro.
I disagree with that being Matt Murdock...for the brief second as the cop walks into the room, when slowed down, it doesn't look like he's wearing glasses...though it is hard to make out
I just realized that when doctor strange pushes spiderman's astral form he has his eye of agamotto
I'm wondering if when we see doc oc at the end its Holland hes saying it too, could be maguire and theve just cut it so it looks like it
My guess is that the spell that Dr. Strange used would've worked just fine with the sacred timeline still intact. However, as we know, the events in Loki released the Multiverse (and the TVA can no longer stop it), so the spell broke everything, because instead of pulling from just one timeline, it pulled from multiple ones, causing a merger. Also, Strange totally pulled a Kang variant into the main MCU universe, namely the one we'll see in Ant-Man 3.
Where is tobey
When strange said everyone, doesn't that mean the avengers will also forgot who spiderman is?
MATT MURDOCK!!!!!!
Dag! 1 million views in under 9 hour?! Dude this is amazing! Congrats!
Can someone please tell me where SANDman and LIZARDman appear?
Can’t wait for this to come out! Mainly to see if everything is correct
Or it could be evil doctor strange
Whoever came up with the idea of re-using old actors to form the sinister six is truly genius.. if it was Feige's idea then that man is a god  Rather than re-casting & re-introducing these villains again and wasting precious screen time.. Just use the multiverse and break the internet  Doc oct, green goblin, electro, sandman, lizard.... And Vulture/scropio? A villain from each Spiderman movie from past 20 years yo!!   SINISTER SIX!!!!  Now.. Lets leak Battison new trailer too haha
The rainbow effect is in fact, what we saw in Doctor strange One, when ancient one was showing multiverse to doctor strange! even the Hole with a light in it is there, look closely!
My "for fox sake" moment was the first mention of Mephisto, lol
I like turtles
You had me at Green goblin 😍
Keep up the good work mate
Wonder if they could use this to fill the void of Tom Holland's Spiderman origin story? They never address what happened to his Uncle Ben or his parents and whilst all the madness is happening maybe they could tidy some of that up somehow through Strange and the events of the multiverse and him potentially meeting the other Spider-men
dem. that last part with doc ock got me goosebumps . thank god for this movies
Mr sand man
I love that one of the ads on this video was the trailer. 🤣
Looks awesome
I don't want to know if Tobe & Andrew are in this movie... I want to be put into complete shock & awe by seeing a fight scene with All 3 Spider-Men vs. Doc Ock, The G Gobblen,  and Electro... could u imagine 😳
With that shot of the Lizard, makes me think we’re going to see a few more villains from his rogue gallery. Maybe some that haven’t been in film yet
Now she's the MJ ??? 😵
Bet Wanda to show up in a post credit scene 😂
Wait, it was confirmed Charlie Cox is going to be in the movie???
Y’all impatient just wait to see if Toby and Andrew are in it do you know how big of a surprise that would be
This movie looks so fucking awesome
Well it was prime lol🔥🔥🔥
2:41 I don’t know if thats Matt because if you look a few seconds early you see the white shirt man crossing his arms walking into the room without holding a cane 🦯 Not to mention an NYPD mug next to him which could mean this man is affiliated with the NYPD.
Can we hear again this word in this movie?  Im gonna put some dirt in your eye.
2:56 wait charlie cox is going to join the mcu? i definitely missed that oops but that doesn't look like him tbh. not to be rude, but that actor has a bit of a tummy and daredevil is fit as hell, so i guess he appears in another way
Pizza time!
Wow this is my 3rd easter egg video ive watched in a row. You all have been on point so far with just the first trailer. Lol. This will be the best Spiderman movie weve seen and that all fans from every gen will love it.
1M  views in less than 9 hrs...!!!!!!!!!!!!
I missed the part where the heavy spoiler is my problem…
the villain who is coming from the multiverse is doctor octopus and electro or or TOBEY AND ANDREW
Doc oc, green goblin, electro, lizard, and sandman, thats 5 who’s the last villain?
If u go to 11:00 to 11:02 you can see black suited Spider-Man or venom, go with slowmo
Calling it now, the snow scenes will be the ending and so is MJ in a diner.
Matt Murdock??? Trailer guy is fatter than him bro come ooon dont you see?
I wish tobey would show up but I think what happened is they all think tom Holland spiderman is the spiderman that they had to deal with since the universe got mixed up. As much as I want three spidermen teaming up it feels too good to be true. I think Tom Holland will end up wearing clothing or do act in a way that reminds us of the other Peter's by glitching and stuff but Tobey and Andrew might not entirely be there. If they are then great but a small cameo in the end is enough also.
hmmm...I think they tried here to bring up a massive puzzle piece...whos knows , with all the movies have been done and watched by everyone , we will understand eventually what is going on ... :O : / : /
For Jamie Fox sake
I love how we aren't going off about Tobey and Andrew not being in the trailer because Doctor OC's appearance is all that matters 👏
Just get all the avengers to show up I think they will think he didn’t kill mysterio
Mad
I think Alfred molina is saying “hello Peter” to tobey maguire Version of Spider-Man. Can’t wait to see the return of Willem Defoe. Such a good actor. I also think maybe Ned is a ‘cool kid’ in an alternate universe wearing a letterman jacket.
So by this time Peter has became a variant went he went to Doctor Strange for help to let everyone forget that he is Spiderman. But behold! No TVA to collect his puny ass back to their HQ since Loki already messed things up.
So excited!
Thank you for making this video! 😁 I am so excited for the movie!
Tobey, Tom, Miles
That uncharted reference ❤
who in sinister 6 in this movie?
What if the guy slamming the files down in the interrogation room isn't Matt Murdock, but Captain George Stacy?
I know we all know the spidey verse is coming but tbh I really hope the save tobey and Andrew for the movie and don’t show them off in a trailer
Hello
winner of August living here rent free
Spider Pig.....give us Spider Pig
If that's Matt Murdock, he needs keto.
#2 trending after the trailer
Looks totally badass..  I agree..  But doctor strange does look a bit different in the film..
Number 2 trending in the UK lets gooooo
Peter asks Strange for a favor, shit happens, aunt May gets killed somehow. Peter knows it's his fault. He says "With great power comes great responsibility". Fade to black
why is strange so irresponsible when wong clearly say not to cast the spell, its mephisto in disguise guys I knew it!!!!
i really wanna see daredevil in this film even if its just as murdock
13:27 lmao 🤣🤣🤣
I had expectations for no way home to be a 11/10 but now it seems a 9.10/10
If everyone forgot that Peter was Spider-Man then wouldn’t the avengers forget him as well
theory about mephisto: 1st i just did a google search and said mephisto's ability is shapeshifting and ability to alter time among others, now what if that dr.strange scene on snowy sanctorum wasnt dr. strange at all but mephisto desguising as strange, because as you can observe in the past movies dr.strange has been obedient to the rules of magic, thats when wong tell him not to do the trick but he winked suggesting that hes about to broke the rules of magic, 2nd is that base on the trailer, the movie's main theme is time bending and time bending happens to be mephisto's power.
I’m glad Dr Strange is in the movie too
The Goblins Giggle! 🤭🕷
They all have to get a scene where J Jonah Jameson shows up on a big screen or I'm suing
I don’t wanna see Toby or Andres in the trailers, I wanna see it officially announced when the movie is out
Perfect! Elton John is back hahaha. Looks immense
Notice the letters on the Helicopter that read WYPE. Like WIPE AWAY THEIR MEMORIES. This is going to be good
THEY ARE PICKING FROM THE COMICS TO CREATE THIS MOVIE
Huuu
Hoping for a lizard redesign.
Is peter parker now a variant?
Mid town High varsity jackets? Nah, that colour scheme, that M? it's totally for Monster University. Fucking Disney.
Just look at Peter's legs in the Rooftop scene. 4!
GLORIOUS
Don't worry, Bully Maguire is going to come and save everything
HEAR ME OUT GUYS, in the infinity war movie.. strange use the time stone to see the future right? So, he must seen that Loki escape with the tesseract right? So I THINK, strange already knew that Loki and his variant will broke the timeline and make the multiverse war happen. That's why strange HELP peter and use the dangerous spells even tho Wong already warned him. Cause there is NO way strange just use the spell just like that right? So my thought is, strange already knew what Loki and his variant did to Kang and the timeline. And after Loki and his variant make the multiverse war happen, strange take this opportunity to help peter to go other multiverse cause the TVA can't arrest them, because the timeline is branching and so many things happening in the TVA. That's my thought tho(maybe strange use this opportunity to cast the multiverse spell to give peter a lesson for him to "be careful for what he wish for", MAYBE) PLUS, strange may know everythings that will happen in the future after the END GAME war. Maybe he already know about the Eternals, shang chi and even the Sentinel's
Been waiting for this
Ah yes Matt Murdock… with love handles and a gut😂 cmon guys
I think electro will be there too
J.Jonah is always a constant in all universes
I saw the fucking pumpkin bomb from the trilogy and heard willem dafoe
13:27 😂
Cgi is for the Garbage...😢 And the movie too
What if "devil in disguise" is a reference to Peter wearing a Daredevil costume?  He's done it to provide reasonable doubt that Matt Murdock was Daredevil in the comics, so maybe it's a variation on that?
I think that if we get to see a three way dance off I would be happy
Film is looking absolutely amazing just via these shots and knowing marvel I'm sure half of these shots won't be seen in the film.
The child within me is going crazy
Trailer Drops On My Birthday Couldn't Ask For More
The fact that Willy Dafoe his pumpkin bom rolls into the screen  hypes me up. Hope they do the Tody dance from spiderman 3
That wasn't goblin voice it was Dr Strange saying be careful what you wish for parker. But they did try and make it look like it was William for some reason but 100% that was Dr Strange
Dr Strange!!! Dr Strange!!! Dr Strange!!! Dr Strange!!! Dr Strange!!! Dr Strange!!! Dr Strange!!! Dr Strange!!!
Imagine we somehow also get a venom crossover
The “hello, Peter” just unlocked my nostalgia!
Crazy theories, i can't wait for the movie
Maybe instead of given the chance to talkt to Uncle ben, he’ll be able to speak to Tony?
3:35 I don't think that's a flashback. I think that's just him going to school. Maybe for the first time since he was arrested/turned himself in. See how it's the same outfit we see him wearing in the school halls later?
Idk I dont see lawyer Matt being a "paper slamming guy"
You are so fvcking obsessed with Mephisto🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
Just wanna see a glimpse of Tobey Spidey
What if if they brought in Tom Hardy’s Venom and Andrew Garfield got to wear the black suit briefly 🤔 i know im getting like 5 steps ahead of myself there, but it would be cool 🤷🏼‍♂️
Man, for you to say the man in min 2:44 is Matt Murdock is just crazy. Look at that gut... that's not Matt Murdock.
So Hope we get the scene where the 3 Spider-Man’s are pointing at each other 😂
willem dafoe's laugh echoing while the pumpkin bomb hit the ground got me jumping
I'm so excited for this movie! I really hope we see Toby and Andrew but even if we don't honestly it looks good enough without them right now that I wouldn't be too dissapointed. I mean I'd be dissapointed, but I think it still looks amazing!
I hope for once this ends well for Peter Parker
this movie is going to be great
I am exited😮😮😮
where toby and second one
That is not Matt Murdock, look at the gut.
Very interesting to see if the orig green goblin comes back along with doc oc but all in all its gunna be a big film :)
That's the same ironspider suit from infinity war. Also you said be careful what you wish for but did you catch that was James francos voice as Harry.... super stoked for this one
In My Theory @ 1:15 or any other scene in trailer Tom Holland will change into Andrew Garfield/Tobey Maguire in the movie (like they changed shots in Infinity War and End Game in the trailer) and also @ 1:18 That's not Tom Holland
Most ANNOYING IRRITATING Spiderman in history. they based a whole movie on his stupid Fucking mouth during a spell? please have him end up like Tony Stark did in the last good MCU film.
This will most likely be my first journey back into Theaters.
I dont think that peter tapered with the spell it just happed at the same time when loki and sylvie killed HIM
Nice video...
Dr Strange having "Eye of Agamotto" is making me curious!!!
Shut up Paul's friend who disagreed with him.
Twist: strange doesn’t need hair for spells but he collects the hair to use in a wig or something
Would it be asking too much to have a Miles reveal??
I hope sandman and the lizard aren’t in the film. Also same with tobey and Andrew because for my and a lot of the general audience for mcu films it would ruin everything that has been built in the last 13 years. Anyone that watches the the other Spider-Man films now without any nostalgia will realise that the only good film is Spider-Man 2 and willem Defoe’s green goblin is good as well.
Can't wait to watch this in December, I feel like at this point everyone just goes to doctor strange to get help. Like Thor went to him and now Peter, he's like the MCUs helpline lmao
Ben 10 unlimate alien  , he went back to school as well ,
3 villain's,  3 spider men???  Maybe the other two spider men come back to help defeat all three villains'.  Albeit,  End Game portals.
Why can't Dr Strange bring back Iron Man then? No spell for that?  Even with their time travel ability?
Holy fk you are fast
Could his legs crossed (in the opening scene with MJ, on the roof) foreshadow that the Fantastic 4 makes a cameo, or an upcoming movie (which we know it will come)?
There is no way tom can take on all those villians.
12:32 the lizard from tasm 2?
Dude your time stamps are all over the place
Bro I wish that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's Spiderman appears in the film
Maybe that is mephisto disguised as strange, idk but i just feel strange is acting well strange. I dont feel like he would cast that spell. Idk maybe im just overthinking.
Spoiler-man: no way we are getting a  good trailer breakdown video 🤣🤣🤣
So I feel there will be another spiderman but not who everyone thinks "Miles Morales"
you called it guess you was right did you see it when you made the other video
Bro what's your source
I just want sinister 6 to come out
dude saved a lot of people in his own movies as well as helped saved the universe but one misinformation and a lot of people already hated him. damn even spiderman's spidey sense isn't strong enough to escape cancel culture
Hopefully Tobey Macguire will say "Pizza Time" might ruin the movie if he doesn't.
Dr Strange is the new Ironman with RDJ out
Spoiler mam we love you 😂😂❤️❤️
Actually that effect is from Spiderverse
I feel like they’re keeping just enough under wraps to allow for the possibility of Garfield and Maguire and I really hope to see all the Spider-Men fighting alongside one another. 🤞🤘
I just wanna see Tobey as Spiderman again and my life is complete
We need bully maguire
Is MJ's and Peters's relationship gone? yes, he may be able to tell her that he's spiderman, but if the memories aren't there, then the relationship is gone right? because from the looks of it there is "no way home" to his "universe".!
13:27 Someone better stop Paul
that's not matt Murdock, look at this body and forearms. nothing like charlie cox
This movie won’t be good there’s like 2 good marvel movies
I am still hoping that it actually isn't Peter who f;s with the spell, that we are made to think that but its actually the events of Loki that Dr Strange's spell get interrupted by. What happens in Loki by chance coincides with the events of No Way Home. Like there wasn't much of a multi verse before this as He Who Remains was pruning it....might be a reach but I think maybe the Ancient One knew about it and knew that He Who Remains is role was important to the safety of the Universe. I think Dr Strange is spell just happens to let him catch that the multiverse has fractured, like in a "that wasn't supposed to happen" moment...... This is of course going to lead into the Multiverse of Madness as Dr Strange now has to go try and fix it. Wanda is in the mix because she is going nuts and trying to get her kids back further f'ing with the mutliverse..............thats my unprofessional theory...and hope....because I kind think its a bit stupid that a whole bunch of death and destruction on the hapless regular humans is going to come because of Peters bumblings....
Matt Murdock has a slimmer figure than the one we saw in this trailer (midsection). I think you are wrong on this one. And I don't think Matt would slam down the files in that way.
No Tobey,no party
Marvel fans are the worst so bent and neeky
What’s with the box?
What if Doctor Strange just let Tom Holland's Peter Parker experience the life of Tobey's and Andrew's Peter Parker to teach him a lesson?  Still it would be good to see a Tobey and Andrew cameo
Matt Murdock is a lawyer not a cop - why would that black tie be matt?
😳😳
I'm gonna walkout if I don't see Tobey
"If indeed Andrew and Tobey are in the film, it may be the worlds worst kept secret".....It's not though is it! YOU/WE still don't know for sure if they're in the film! I'd say that that is up there with the worlds BEST kept secrets!
Theory what if doctor strange did all this to bring a different or another tony stark to his timeline🤔
No one's hyping for Andrew though. I loved him as spidey ❤️
Me seeing this trailer: Damn sylvie/loki done fucked up
I loved this first look,its amazing because people always fight on what spidey films are the best but now we can see them all together
Hey a man named harry holand(drug dealer) is shown in google as cast of this movie maybe he is the goblin  Or remember from homecoming vulture and scorpion were forming teams werent they?
I am so hyped. It scares me a bit. It feels like that will be a 3hrs + movie. 😅
Maybe the one that Peter made a deal was mephisto not Dr strange there's even the phrase "be careful what you wish for Peter"
It was maphisto all along !!
I can’t believe Alfred molina decided to come back and do doc ock this is so cool I was so hyped when I saw him so cool
hello spoiler man
Tell him to shut the hell up
imagine there is another deadlier variant, and countries have to shut down the cinemas again
4:42 I love that even though Aunt May was caught off guard here, Peter wasn't. He was already sat up staring straight at the door. Good ol' Spidey sense. And he wasn't afraid or angry, he just looks..... confused? Hmmm. Who would confuse, but not frighten, Peter? Perhaps another Peter? :P
Really dope showed enough... Hope toby is there
Hey, just want to point out you said mj and Peter were on their phones looking at news reports when I'm pretty sure they're on face time 😁👍
I have been dreaming of the moment for the longest time and am so excited to see what this movie will bring m can't wait
We need Andrew, he's the best out of the 3 of them💯
Give us Tobey and Andrew!
Y
Cheaters deserve a FAKE A BABY fake ultrasound prank!
It's not Matt it's the second cop that walks in with Jacket cop.
This movie is gonna be sickkk
But rite after we here the goblin laugh we can here James Franco say something
Hoping to see Tobey Maguire
I literally cant wait for this movie
What is that box Tom holding in thumbnail of trailer?
Hey you missed a part that when the ball role in if you look closer you can see green goblin on his hover board
Who ever says that matt aint in this movie imma put some dirt in your eye
Probably another Aunt May walking in on Aunt May.  I didn't see Sleepwalker either.
Vultures shadow flies over the train behind dr strange at 2:14 on the main trailer
Damn no rhino in the 6
I understood from the announcement that after Spider-Man, do you know, he came to Dr. Strange to help him make the whole world forget him. Who is Spider-Man, so I got a mistake in the spell because of Loki when the time line split into branches let them travel three worlds, each one of them in the evil Electro, Doctor Octopus and the Green Goblin
I think Doctor Strange casted the spell during the death of Kang
It's not Matt, look at that belly
Nice breakdown, can't wait for this movie
4:04 how could that be flash when thats an actor with white skin? lol
Hahaha! Mephisto confirmed!
From what I see, Wong is probably trying to earn some money from that cage fight ( just like Tobey Spider-Man), to fix the sanctum sanctorum roof.
This movie is gonna be filled with great fucking cameos! Ughh I can feel it!!
Why are they hating on Peter in the trailer ?
In the background 3:20 it looks like it says "NAGE" and the beginning is cutoff. Could that be carnage?
Ok we need this soon
Most of the villains seem hinted at. Any hints to Venom yet? I wonder if he's in the movie
On the roof opening, one of the Graffiti in the background says "Ditko" as in Steve Ditko :D
Fans: can’t wait to see how strange fix wandas and lokis mistake  Dr.strange: makes everything worse
Excited for it!
I feel like flash will become a villain
Far and away THE most anticipated movie for me for a very long time. Cant wait!!
i think happy was the person who entered the room which aunt may stood a bit, i think peter is gonna take responsibilities of Stark Industries
The aboard slipper possibly license because flood booly collect before a narrow gold. gaping, giant glue
I bet peter will end up in Sony's universe by the end of the movie with no way home
Maybe this is how Deadpool gets to the MCU
It’s ben affleck!
Everyone talking about hints of Electro, Green Goblin and Sandman, but I see nobody talking about Drax. Never doubted you, buddy.
They literally brought everything back together ❤
It's hard to see Dr Octavius as a vilain. Again.  I'm pretty depressed knowing Spidey got MASSIVELY bullied just for just a poor choice of words, and got tricked.  I love this side of the movie showing this public bullying because this can avoid some children being bullied too, and that that mistakes can't be undone.
Me before the trailer:  this film will just be fan service overkill After watching the trailer 1458543 times: MORE GIVE ME MORE
That baseline when they're casting the spell though...
Green Goblin to Peter: you know…I’m somewhat of a MCU character myself
I’m so excited for this movie…bruuuuuh why does the 17th December have to be that far away
8:04 this look of mephisto kinda looks like Henry cavil
I hate how I can't see anything during the lizard scene. The first few times i watched the trailer i had no idea wtf it was until the comments told me.
If that is matt Murdock, he clearly likes donuts.
10 year old me scremed with joy when i saw Doc Ock
that guy is definitely not murdoc. You can see him from a different angle in the trailer and he looks a bit corpulent and seems not like he is blind.
The black and gold suit really reminds of me of the Anti-Ock suit from the PS4 title. Great looking suit and really cool if the ps4 game is actually referenced at all in the movie like it was in Spider-Verse
I love that they have hinted to and shown some villains but also kepts majority of it all secret
that ain't charlie cox... that's chubby cox
nice. I am soo Excited   yes i can not wait till it comes out to.
Stop it. Stop GIVING him 50000000 new suits. Giving him A Spider-Man suit and let him build it and use it. He gets suits like they’re tissues. What is this lego Batman
So who messed up? Strange? Loki? I am literally lost at this point....
I really want it to be the sinister6
Wasn’t eye of agamotto destroyed in infinity war???
Mesphisto confirmed!!! ........😅😂😅😂😅😅😅😂😅😅😂😅😅😅😂😅😂😅
Your source dude was right my man!!!
They’ll show up as a cameo for less than 2 minutes. Not much excited.
Look at the body type of the guy who slammed some documents on the table. Does he look like Matt Murdock to you? I bet you, it's Foggy Nelson.
basically,after no way home,the multiverse will have some shit so the next movie will be doctor strange madness of multiverse where he save it
Imagine Tom and Tobey getting beaten and then suddenly Andrew's theme plays out of nowhere. That would be an epic entrance.   Edit: I'm talking about tasm 2 theme btw
Plot twist will be.. doctor strange here in the film is mephisto and the doctor strange film will fill in the gap why that happened
it is not matt, peter is in the police station being interrogate. matt is an attorney. matt will not pressure peter in a police station, he will request to remove that handcuff and will take peter to their place to interview.
i really liked the breakdown. You earned a sub :)
I hope Tobey and Andrew are in it but... I just don't think they are :( I hope they are though, please god!😂😂
Its kinda funny how flash will most likely be a really good friend to peter now that he knows the truth, but then all of that will be erased by strange and he’ll go back to his old ways as if nothing ever happened xD
This is going to absolutely SHATTTTERRRR the internet 😅
I hope we see miles that would be cool and Tobey and Andrew Garfield
The "Ned" part in this had absolutely no Ned
“I’m solid as Fuck me”  shows Phil and Grant 🤣
Venommmmm
heeey doctor ocotobers the first mortal enemy of spideyboi
Yoooooo that’s awesome
This looks amazing! Hope rhino pops up to trash some shizzle
You don't understand how happy I am this is finally out aha
13:28 ayo😳
Am I dreaming?!
Movie is gonna be fire. Great break down of the trailer
13:27 hahahaaa OMFG bro you actually went there 😂 it honestly made me laugh out loud 🤣🤣 I’m deaddddd
An the part Peter turned when he was on suit outside with his mum in the car i guess it was the part the green guy threw the bomb
13:27 OMG bro you went there and it honestly made me laugh out loud 😂🤣hahaha I’m deadddd
What’s your name. The human spider
Matt Murdock gains weight ?
All I’m looking out for is a post credits scene with all the main characters including Tobey’s Spider-Man , eating pizza , having tobey say “pizza time “
So much to digest from this trailer I can't wait for this movie!
Matt Murdock is fit unless he got Pizza Time
It's obviously not Charlie Cox, the dude in the trailer clearly has a gut
That 4 at the beginning tho…
I Cant wait for this movie!!
This movie has to be at LEAST three hours.
Imagine Tom’s Peter is getting a beaten by the sinister six then you just hear Toby theme song playing. I would lose my shit watching Toby swing in and save Tom or maybe MJ just something amazing :)
Always miss so much from the trailers! I’m so excited for this to come out!
On the part at 2:27 in the trailer the character in the bottom right looks like Tobey's Spidey
I think Doc strange and peter were like fighting during thta train scene
"look at lil goblin junior ,you wonna cry? "
If Doc Oc Doesn't Say Something About Iron Spiders Metal Arms
Let’s get this prize!
THE HEART! YOU HAVE TO ATTACK HIS HEART.
Strange is possessed by Mephisto confirmed
I sure not hope, that this Flash Thompson is the guy going to play “Agent Venom”.  Btw isn’t there going to be a “Craven the Hunter” movie?
What if we get to see Toby and Garfield when Peter goes back in Time?.. Can't imagine the goosebumps i will get
I’ve made such a mess all over my computer when watching that trailer smh
IM SO EXCITED
I reckon it is Matt Murdoc your friend is wrong!!!!
3:37 I don’t think it’s flash - I think it’s Remy Hii who played Brad Davis in Far From Home…
Next spider man is  spider man I sell my home
That scene with happy seems like the elevator scene of venom
It looks very good
This first look has gotten me super hyped for this movie and I can't wait to see how Marvel will pull this off because as of now it looks fantastic
It's not Charlie Cox. The guy clearly has a gut.
it would be pretty cool if the venom post credit scene was him going through some portal that strange opened idk if there in the same universe or not already tho
Really excited for it
Mephisto will not show up in anything they want to show in China
i want to see batman
I'm about 50 50 on whether or not Doc Ock was talking to Maguire's Peter or to Holland's Peter. Glad to see that they're taking Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin and Doc Ock from the Raimi Spider-Man Series and along with Lizard possibly from TASM and Electro from TASM2.
Rent?
Alfred Molina was never a spoiler. He was confirmed the entire time.
The thing is..in place of bringing tobey and andrew to movie, they have been altering with tom holland spiderman personality. Like multiple personalities within same person. This thought came when i saw him in the suit on a car over the bridge.. The suit was so much matching to what tobey was wearing in his spiderman trilogy.
SPIDER MAN
BTW the movie should be renamed to spider"men" by now lmao Best Kept Secret 😂😂 I defn think Tobey and Andrew will make an appeareance but by the end of the movie
lmao saying "you can tell it's set at Christmas time bc this teenage girl has Christmas lights in her bedroom" shows you know nothing about teenage girls
I don't think Peter talking to Strange and effecting his concentration is what makes the spell go wrong. Remember that he's using a piece of Peter's hair to cast a spell that'll make his desires a reality and later says the problem is that Peter's living two lives and the longer he does it the more dangerous it gets. I think what's happening is that as Peter adds conditions to his desires in that scene, the effects of the spell are being altered accordingly, he wants to have people forget, but also to make exceptions to that rule at the same time. So the only way the spell can allow him to have his cake and eat it is to create a situation where both possibilities can exist at once, which is to split the reality open and link different realities.
is it just me or can no one else see the upgraded iron spider modifications
I'v been waiting for this trailer for forever. 😪😴😌😮😀😃 I love it its everything i expected for this movie and more.  And its just the trailer
The weird thing with the villains is that Doc Ock and Sandman shouldn't necessarily be bad. With Doc Ock you could argue that the arms' AI regained control, but Sandman doesn't have that reason. Maybe he was pulled over prior to the end of Spider-Man 3?   Regardless, I was hoping we get a scene where Doc Ock imparts some wisdom from an alternate Spider-Man, but that probably won't happen if they're just straight up bringing over Tobey Spider-Man.
DAYUMMMMM...doc ock goblin and all juts kinda makes me nostalgic 😿😿
Told the wife that she couldn't have her morning coffee until she watched the trailer with me, worked like a charm.
Bruh 13:28
is it really confirm that dare devil is going to be in it? dont give me hopeeeeeeeeeeee
I love videos like this❤
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE AAAAH
PAUL! GUYS! EVERYONE! At the 26 second mark, you see someone following the detective into Peter's interrogation. In the same costume as the guy who slammed down papers on Peter's table. It has to be Cox's Matt Murdock - check it for yourselves because no one has picked up on it yet!!!
im pretty sure the rain bow things are the infinity stones being made since the universe was split
That wasn’t the upgraded iron spider suit dummy, it was still the one from infinity
Lets goooo
I am hyped for this.....yeah man. This looks lit. But what if this Strange dude isn't actually Stephen Strange!? What if it's, let's say, Mafisto in disguise. hear me out.....what if everything that happens in Doctor Strange 2 (multiverse of madness) happens before and during Spiderman Far from Home (2) movie. And this is the aftermath movie for both. We already know Loki happens pretty much during Endgame and shortly there after. Wandavision happens 3 weeks after Endgame. But Far from home is already months later. And this is even after that.  What happend inbetween? What if Doctor Strange lost in de multiverse battles or was caught and this figure is not him!? The reason I am saying this is because Dr. Strange casting this spell is out of character. This man poofed himself for a one in 14 million something chance to save the universe. Why would he put that same universe back in danger. He wouldn't. Also the character looks, pardon the pun, strange. It feels like an alternate version of Strange or just someone else. Benedict Cumberbatch is a really good actor and knows how to play a character even in the tiniest details. My first reaction to seeing him in the trailer was like : "thats weird, that's not Stephen." I am getting 'someone else' vibes of off him right now and I think it might be intentional. Mafisto confirmed???
The Green Goblin laugh when the Pumpkin Bomb rolled down the street...goosebumps
I dont fking care if i get corona, if i see this movie, im dying in peacefully.
Well I know now that Christmas in our house is going be all of us watching spider-man no way home and I can't think of anything better this trailer as got me so ready for it.
When the yellow lightning shows up the second time in the trailer I think🤔, but you can see Spiderman in that suit for electro on the bottom right corner😃
So if Dr. Otto Octavius is there, that means that Toby is 100% somewhere . This Trailer & Breakdown just made my day! Awesome! Gotta go back to work on some VFX. Have a nice day!
I have a theory…  There will actually be FOUR SPIDER-MEN in this movie. The 3 Spider-men we’re expecting, but we will also be introduced to Miles Morales also. I have a feeling that Tom Holland is going to switch over to the Sony universe while we are given Miles Morales to continue with in the MCU.
Dr strange is the devil 😈 Mephisto < he out of character 🧐 real strange is fighting Wanda
I don't think we will see Tobey and Andrew Spider-man at all.  I think I agree that these are all variant versions of the previous Franchises villains.  So their stories will be slightly different to explain them merging with the MCU Spider-man.
How is that blond white/asianesque dude the same flash?
You'll get another trailer when you fix this damn door!
Time (3.23) The Fantastic 4 Reference/Easter egg???
Brad Davis sent that theory about Peter being able to hypnotize females.
You mist venom from spiderman 3
I can't wait for the movie, the hype and meme potential in this movie is going to be lit.
My recommendation play the trailer then break it down otherwise I have to go somewhere else and watch it before at some point potentially coming back later.
Anyone getting tobey spiderman 3 vibes with Sony shoe horning too many villains into one movie? Too soon IMO
My guy  up early with the spoilers even tho he read us the trailer not too long ago. Living up to the name big homie
the only person who could’ve saved Peter was Mr Stark
We need the sinister six!!!!!! And venom since Disney bought the rights from sony
When I saw the Devil in disguise sign I knew that the Mephisto joke would live on through the Heavy Spoilers channel once more
Ok so is the green goblin THE green goblin from Raimiverse? Or is he an alternate version? Because I actually liked the suit of that one. Also it's Doc, Lizard, Goblin, Electro, Sandman and...? Who's the sixth? Venom? Rhino? Volture from Spiderman 4?!
The macabre number feraly matter because sheep multivariately dislike excluding a abundant sunshine. vigorous, ignorant shape
Maybe peter today will wake up and live as peter(tobey) and peter(andrew) 🤔    Spiderman just 1 but diff identity 🤔   He is no longer living as a spiderman from mcu but spiderman from other universe where no one knows he's identity 🤔
I do hope they don't overload it with past villains.
I really hope they include Tobey and Andrew 😍 I'm also hoping for a possible Venom Cameo :)
The rainbow thing also happened when the ancient one messed with Strange and killed his ego
I don’t think they’ll mention anything at all about Garfield or Maguire to get people in the theatre. I also don’t think Maguires Peter Parker will appear but I do think his Spider-Man will - someone else in the costume but with him providing voice over - simply because Maguire is largely done with movies and won’t appear in it for the sake of it.   His attitude towards Spider-Man kinda reminds me of Harrison Ford’s to Han Solo - they don’t like being mainly known for those roles and try to distance themselves from them.
I'm scared... 'cause I have a STRONG feeling that the other Spidermans won't be a part of this movie. I mean... why would they give so much hipe for the villains if it wasn't because they are the only ones who represent this "multiverse" idea? I really really reeeeeally think there won't be no other spidermans, but instead, there will just be a lot of refferences about them. But no. I strongly believe Tobey and Andrew won't be in this...
I need to see Tobey and Andrew one more time
Can some body respond
Love this! So much missed on the trailer .. soooo keen!
Creating branch realities is something that can actually happen now though because the TVA doesn't exist anymore as it did.... Just because it's bad to do so that doesn't mean they won't still do it
AWSOME Thank you 😊
Bruh, the people are so dumb to blame him for a single death, meanwhile thanos wiped out half the universe. Just comes to show people only fight who they can. 🤡
Just me or the black suit looks like wakanda tech
Wait in the scram were he made copies of the train and him punching the soul out of his chest he had the time stone thing on
devil in disguise is a Daredevil Easter egg iirc its an issue title
Peters blqck suit looks like black panthers
15:56 did he say loki no way home 😂😂
did nobody notice that strange is wearing the eye of agamotto that was destroyed in infinity war?
This trailer is lit as!! 🔥
That’s not Matt Murdock’s belly and love handles! I’d know…
When MJ and Peter are on the roof relaxing the white graffiti in the background looks to spell "DITKO" dope Easter EGG!
He didn't close the window before some historic villains come and say 'hello'
Does everyone not know that it was already confirmed by the studios that Tobey Maguire & Andrew Garfield will NOT be joining Tom Holland in this new movie?!
Toby is MCU uncle Ben
""""Someone who had accidentally found this channel and now addicted to this channel 💛💙😂"'""
I don't think that was flash washing with them
No..Matt Murdock with a belly....haha
Dr. Strange is basically the Avatar😂
nice trailer, nice breakdown. nice Job.
Cz of Strange the 3 alternative universe mixed up together which causes g.goblin and D.Octo
This movie could literally destroy and obliterate the box office
Thanos used the stones to destroy the stone.  So why is the eye of agomoto/time stone still on Dr. Strange at 7:42?  Multiple versions of Dr. Strange confirmed.
7:12 i can see 1 of the toms peter new suits
I cant wait (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞
We dont need the Devil in the MCU…🤷🏾‍♂️😂if Mephisto aint there thats fine. Who gets gassed to see the Devil?
So you didn't explain that cube peter was holding, didn't see the sanctorum was already fixed and it was summer, so strange probably cast a spell to cool it down due to lack of AC. Didn't mention the shot where peter and MJ stand on the bridge next to the gondola is a hint to where he was forced to choose between saving MJ or the ppl of NY. Btw there are hints that MJ is gonna die, and strange is already a variant.
This guy in the white shirt is too chubby to be Matt Murdock / Daredevil. :P However, despite this, I'm sure Charlie Cox will appear in the movie in the court scene.
U know I just realised it has spiderverse vibe because in spiderverse when the spidermans come they see peters face and spiderman face in timee square and here they have put peters face in time square again so when the villans arrive they might see the face just like how spidermans saw in spiderverse
How’s down to watch the movie with me :D 🍿
wow, Why does Dr Strange have the time stone in Spider-Man No Way Home If He Lost It To Thanos ??????
I actually can't wait to see daredevil in the mcu
Maybe strange is Mephisto in disguise
Is it a coincidence that I got SPIDERMAN No Way Home trailer ad while watching this ??
"Pennsylvania Station" lol
Incredible
Anyone else feels that this Strange is kinda sus, and not like the main timeline Strange? and in the shot of Peter looking at the Witch decoration, it focused on the witch that looked sorta evil instead of the other decorations.
If done right this could shit on end game
Solid jokes there mate, solid indeed. :D
I wonder will there be a 'I am Iron Man' type reveal at the end.
13:27
2:50 unless Matt has put on some weight over lockdown, that's not him.
thank you so much for this video i’ve never read any comics so i didn’t really understand some things
I AM SO HYPED FOR THIS MOVIE   I’ve not really been hyped for anything marvel since endgame and Tony dying, as he was my favourite. Atm the only other thing I’ve been excited for is SpiderMan, and seeing this trailer has got me SO HYPED!!!!
2:56 that stomach says it all that it isn't DD.
This makes me wish for a proper Raimi SM4 so much! I can’t wait to see what they do with these characters that we grew up with and how they end up interacting with Tom Holland’s Spider-man. Will be the first movie I go back to theaters to see.
It’s definitely wasn’t him lol
No- that’s just what girls do. Mjs lights are probably up year long
This video is doing numbers!!
great breakdown
OMG when he says it looks like someone walked in what if it was andrew or tobey
Official spoiler Press more at ur own risk . . .        Give me rent            MJ is killed by Dr. Oct
What if Mephisto = Loki -> Ability to change appearance -> That's not Dr Strange, but Mephisto.
No one says Pennsylvania station.  Every one says penn station.     Grain of salt.  Not pinch of salt.    You are the best and I am a fan.
This movie is to ambitious to fall of off like previous spider man sequel movies 🤞
Since sandman was a good guy. It seems as if he's protecting peter from the lightning.
Is Happy going to give him the Ben speech before he dies?
venoms gonna be in the movie too.  just watch the scene at 2:26 of the trailer in 0.25x speed
about the branched reality, i think you forget about Loki. the sorcerer supreme said that a branched reality would create chaos. which is exactly what the TVA said in Loki. but now that Silvie and Loki messed with the timeline reality is already branching. so wouldn't it just not be that big of a deal anymore? or maybe they do try that and that's the actual reason why Dr strange's spell messed up.
I can see spiderman with venom suit in 2:27 of the trailer. Maybe Tobey wear that suit ?
We all seen that gat damn leak
i hope raimi was somehow involved in that, since tobey is his, and he is working on the new strange movie
Anyone else think that the wizard light that Peter focuses on looks a little evil in comparison to the other... Maybe foreshadowing necromancer / evil Dr Strange as consequence to the goings on in this movie?
If Matt Murdock makes a cameo i'm gonna lose my shit.
Real question is did Tobey had the damn door fixed after all these years?
This heat is coming out on my birthday Excitement literally kept me up all night
Excited for this movie
Anyone feel like this is lazy writing?? Dr. Strange who is so intelligent and always sceptical about messing with time, is just changing the course of history for Peter Parker... seems to be going against all the character development he made in avengers and the Dr strange movie
This mans quicker at the breakdown's than Usain Bolt, should hire a commentator to add to the tension! ''And Paul's just uploaded it here in sensational speed of 0.144 seconds after the trailer has been released and the fans go absolutely wild!!!!''
really hyped
the goblin bomb i rly rly RLY want to see william defo return as norman osborn/green goblin he was perfect his voice for it still sends chills down ur spine
The whole premise of the movie is STUPID! WHY WOULD Dr. Strange would tear the multiverse just for him... and then make a mistake! STUPID!!!!!
The daily bugle being and Alex Jones show is the funniest shit ever
does anyone else not hear James Franco's voice after the Goblin bomb rolls into the scene?
Please make sure that subtitles will available from next video ❤️ from India
I legit thought he was infected by the symbiote when i saw him on a black suit
youl get your rent when yout fix this DAMN DOOR
I'm not even a big mcu guy but when tobey and Garfield show up I'm gonna cry
It seems like a fun movie but it seems to have more of the feel of the DC rather than Marvel universe.   In the DC universe thing can be broken and sit out there, in the Marvel universe others see the broken and other people/event interact with it.t.   The building would not have been vacant and broken for five years.   OK, off my soapbox.  :)
Love the breakdown and glad I found your channel- is that a fellow Welsh accent I can hear? If so even better. Subbed and liked! 😊
so even if electro is yellow now, dock ock looked the same, green goblins bomb looked the same, soooo they arent variants from their original ones right?
Who wore Jordan 1s better?, thumbs up for Miles Morales, Reply for Peter!
I can't wait for this film been a crap last few years now we need something amazing
The way people treated them after Thanos just makes me angry, at this point they should just make everyone comeback except the earth 50 that has gone excluding the heroes
The guy slamming the papers with belly fat, for sure is not Murdock 😅
The person putting down a file in the imtergaton room could be matt murdock cant see his could be a cameo for charlie cox
Spoiler Alert: Mary Jane is STILL Brown while an old person could NOT be found during COVID to portray an actual Aunt May!
02:41 it's just a cop... don't fantasize too much...
✨
I think when tom fighting electro and sandman he's using the enchanted spider suit because you could see him wearing it when the sands rose up
This is not our Dr. Strange as this one looks cool, wearing cool jacket,ignites fire with black magic, he is okay when Peter calls him Stephen also winks eye when wang left, fighting with spidy on train, Also he said "everyone is about to forget Peter Parker the spiderman" Which shows he don't want Peter Parker to be the spiderman and someone else will become spiderman and it can be Harry Osborn hope we will see this in What if for sure.....  Also we can see daredevils as Peters lawyer when police Intorogets him and the one who slams files on the table is also look like daredevil..... At the end "Hello Peter is for Toby as it looks edited scene because background looks different for both Dr Oc and Tom halland.....
Love the trailer it’s definitely gunna be epic watching spiderman try to outrun strange
In the police station and on the couch next to his aunt, spider man is wearing the same outfit (black t shirt and squared pants) + police light out of the window => he is arrested and brought to the police station.
I really want to know why the Sanctum is all cold and icey...
Then Newrockstars will just copy the script and post it
Spider-Man saves the sinister six? DUN DUN DUUUN
Awesome can't wait for this. I do hope that at some point that there's a nod to kraven, not that bloke from news round the kids tv show.😂🙈🃏
what if strange was the one thing, the one who remains felt while talking to loki and sylvie loki? and not wanda
Cant wait for the movie to come out...
@11:01 thats green goblin
Shang Chi comes out before NWH so Wong can't be going to fight Abomination
Paul: Give me rent  Everyone: No, I don't think I will
That green goblin laugh sounds like only one   Willem Dafoe
2:42 It’s not him. Look at that belly
Ohhhhh, I can't wait!!!
Who confirmed that Charlie Cox will be in this movie?
I swear is aunt may dies (again)  I will not hesitate to hit someone with my keyblade!!
Have some rent 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
It'd just be great but sad at the same times if we saw Tobey and Andrew but Tobey just cameos as a pizza guy and Andrew as an oscorp employee , just like the mandarin and the boner joke.
I’m too excited for this shit
This got me so pumped! I grew up watching (and loving) Raimi's films (the third less so) and to revisit some of its characters today... Just take my money! I'll be watching this all December long
So wait.. ARE WE FINALLY jumping into the Spider-Man  multiverse ??? Oh I hope so I’m ready to see Spider-Man meet Miles and all the others
Helo peter goes to Tobey😉
Iron spider should have a Yellow or gold symbol
Honestly the last spider man was just a push over bc of covid this one seems like the Spiderman that should've happened
I guess either Tobey or Andrew comes from another universe and in order to save Tom they say it wasn't Tom but them who did it turn the blame on themselves and return to their universe boom solved.
No live action Peter Porker though?
I would like an electro redemption
Looks a bit too podgy to be Matt Murdock tbh
Surprisingly excited for the movie but it is so sad that it's only due to nostalgia, Spiderman used to be a major superhero but now he needs Ironman or Doctor Strange to create some hype...
we want tobey maguire
I bet Electro is in it!
Look at that belly. That ain't no Matt Murdock. Foggy maybe 😂
Bro your videos is cool good Lucky
I swear to god. They casted the SAME actors for the villians. If they do NOT have the two other Spider-Man’s in, they literally are laughing at us of how much they teased us. But my theory is that dr strange will be like uhm we cannot defeat these dudes alone we need the other spidies and go kidnap them
"Hey Peter" just got Marvel fans pregnant
First time viewer and new subscriber.  Wow great tie in the the comics over the decades. Thank you!
I wonder what the post-credit scene will be if it has one lol
Do you think Harry Osbourne will show up
This movie looks insane man so hyped for it
WTF WHY NOONE IS TALKING ABOUT DR STRANGE NECKLACE
Nice break down.  Im sure your northern due to your accent. Im Geordie 👍😁
Either MJ or Aunt May die in this one
Alright theory time. Every villain looks different from their movies. This version of Raimi and Amazing is also variants of their own universes I'm pretty sure. Because villains are variants of their movies too.
ITS HAPPENING PEOPLE ..... IM MORE HYPED FOR THIS THAN I WAS ENDGAME
See I have a feeling it’s just gonna be the old suits that’s are in it not Tobey or Andrew mibby see them swinging about
Is it me who sees this as the SINISTER 6?
I know that we all want it to be Matt Murdoch but the cop is wearing the same tie and white shirt underneath his cop jumper so I'm pretty sure it will just be the cop who slams down the paper
you forgot to mention , when they lying on the roof , the girls outfit looks like "gwen stacy" spiderman .
god, im so excited. after watching this, i dont think i can wait until december 17th lmao
Strange is acting really well, strange. He doesn’t seem to be acting like himself in this. Not like the witty version of “Fury” from far from home. But like extremely out of character.
I was so used green goblin more in spider verse
It seems a lot of people think the woman in the car is Miles Morales's mother, A lot of other rumours are that Toby and Andrew are going to be in the film. Not to alarm anyone but if Miles shows up that might mean one of our friendly neighborhood Spider-men is going to die.
I love how Wong is like : Dude I've gotta go kick Abominations ass real quick, probably in Madripor.
I bet the movies gonna take place in Christmas time
At the movies gonna take place in Christmas time
So technically speaking then Matt murdock won’t even remember meeting spider-man 🤔👀 at the end of all this
if tony were there, this never gonna happen. missing tony stark
Cant believe your inside man got this right. Woulda thought it was just some guy looking for trouble. Good thing he was such a good source for this trailer
The question is does the devil in disguise refer to Maphesto or matt murdock as daredevil or even a reference to both as they could both be in disguise 🤔
i feel like Tobey and Andrew are uncredited or at least have “placeholder” names to keep leakers out of spoiling their parts in the film.
Cool
The video chapter info doesn't line up lol
Dude when do you sleep? Are you morbius? :)
Kgf 2 trailer has almost 50 million views in 15 hours did you think it can beat kgf records
Amazing breakdown! 😍
In my theory Strange didnt cast the spell but teleported them to the chaotic mutliverse and he needs Peter's help to stabilize the spiderverse . He prolly did it as a lesson not to tamper with reality and accept that people know that he's spiderman and things cant't and shouldn't change that
First Stone Ocean now this? December really can’t come sooner
I hope Sam and is the one that kills uncle Ben in the MCU
Really Excited with Spiderman - No way home!
The “ be careful what you wish for Parker” sounds a lot like James Franco
Everyone saying that the trailer would drop when shang chi does...Sony was like "nah...your all wrong".
I'm super excited for no way home, and I'm super excited we finally got a trailer for it
Definetly looking forward to seeing all the old villains again! This films going to be so hype.
God damn you have a good source!!! Everything spot on from your last video😱😱😱
No way that's Murdock. I hope he shows up but not with love handles like that.
Ok so we have Goblin, Octopus, Sandman, Lizard and Electro from the other verses. Who will be the 6th one? I think it will be from this verse and it will be Scorpio who was teased in the Homecomming.
5:22 look at the windows the cops were there
Something That I think could happen that the seen when lizard jumped up behind peter, could be the post credit scene. Maybe goblin came to earth 616(the earth in which we live) but hid to make the Sinister 6.Or Spider man kills Doc Oc but oc escaped and made the sinister 6 with the help of Rhino who may have come to earth 616. Whatever happens all is dope.
you can see a black cat behind peter at 5:50 maybe unintentional remains to be seen but hey.
Who says "be careful what you wish for peter"
Sinister Six but I count 5
Looks insane
yeah i agree with this 13:26 and i just thought the scene when tom interrupt jerry made the same place in a particular scene in the loki series
Imagine this, peter is getting hurt by the sinister six and we are voice saying leave him alone then we cut to a portal and out come tobey and andrew
same day Wither and Spider man, this will be awesome day  and more awesome christmass :)
you think daredevil is a chubby fella?
Hello good morning Paul 750k views in 5 hours 🤯 congratulations 🥳
December can't come soon enough!!!
12:32 you can see spiderman's black and gold suit in the bottom right of the screen
how the hell strange got the eye of agamotto when it is destroyed in infinity war??
In the shot of the May and Peter in the house/ apartment and they look alerted I believe that might be a shot of Peter getting arrested for the interview at the start due to the fact of on the wall there appears to be what I believe red and blue police sirens flashing on the wall.
Love the breakdown top work
I am iron man . everyone calm . he is spiderman EVERYONE PANIC
This will be so great, when there connect the Marvel Netflix Series (Matt Murdock (Dare Devil) with the MCU at last
William was recently in an DC movie so could it be Harry as Green gobin
So, will tobey and Andrew come back?
Yeah this is gonna be 🔥
What is the eye of agamotto still doing there?
Amazing
I expect that at the end of the movie Tom ends up defeating the villains ON CAMERA and showing it to the world and then everything fine and dandy again.
I will not win a prize
This is sooo good. Christmas can't come soon enough. Just want Tobey back ✨
I hope all spiders apear
I have a weird feeling they might tease Tom Hardy’s venom at the end of this film
just throwing it out ther i didn't see doc ock in the trailer and im grateful that i watched this
12.32 i can see black suit spidy.. anyone noticed that?
That was a great breakdown on a perfect first look trailer. My whole family is hyped as crap, except my serven month old baby girl. And that's just because she was asleep for the night when the trailer came out.
It's here. It's actually here. It was epic😄
This movie has to be 3 hours
Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro. Where's the rest of the Sinister Six?
You think Miles will be introduced in this movie because the title on a marker board looked like Puerto Rico? Man what?
🤣🤣🤣🤣you had me at "after 84 years" tho 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yeah the fact that Peter just talking is what interrupts the spell and breaks reality open is a little wet wipe for me 😅 but if there’s comic book precedence for it then it’s okay with me I guess 😂 but id still prefer a better way for reality to be broken open 🤷🏽‍♂️ Again, that’s just me
😍👏👏👏👍😍👍  WoooW. ⁉️😍
The spell Dr strange uses is from one moment in time and not one more day
Am I the only who noticed that when electrodes lightning was going on there was also sand flying around, potentially hinting at sandman? Or am I just overlooking?
YOU’LL GET YOUR RENT WHEN YOU FIX THIS DAMN TIMELINE!
I cant get past the feeling that it was goblin juniors pumpkin bomb not goblins. Just throwing that one in there lol
What is Shield doing ? They can clear his name easily
I fucking cried
Sorry but tobey isn't showing up
I believe it could be Hob-Goblin instead of Green Goblin. Because Ned plays a pivitol role and in the comics he becomes The Hob-Goblin. Similar arsenal to Green Goblin. So it could be Ned from a different universe.
OMG! Looks totally amazing.
Peter hypnotizing women was probably just a funny gag, but it does remind me of silk's story where she had some strange connection to him, tracked him down and uh decided it was naughty time.
You didn’t mention that Dr. Strange has the time stone again in some scenes - all ones where he’s fighting Peter - this would make me think Peter gets trapped in another reality/time before endgame where Dr Strange doesn’t know Peter - Peter steals this box in an attempt to correct time/reality and get home and Dr Strange chases and fights him as he thinks he’s just up to no good and it doesn’t believe his story. I think this movie will be more about Peter travelling through realities than other realities being brought into the main timeline.
Can't believe this came out on the 23rd August. This date was marked on a calendar on Wonder Vision.  I so hope it's linked.
Please stop saying bruh your not 15 year's old
I really hope this is Into the Spider-verse crossover when he go to Tobey dimension.
I have a source in Marvel, there is whispers that Italian Spiderman was seen on set!!!
Im just gonna say, we are gonna look back at this day when they released the first trailer and be like ”ooooh thats what happend in that shot”
And mephisto confirmed... ahahah
I wonder if the other two Spideys will also try to stop Peter when he tries to free the Sinister Six.
What if the gift that Strange gives Peter is actually a few minutes with Tony, instead of Ben... Biggest secret ever of keeping RDJ cameo that would break the internet
i justn want to comment i have no twitter acc
i cant wait! cristmas is going to be great
This will be one heck of a birthday gift, I’ve been waiting SOOOO long for this trailer
ik this is off topic but his voice sounds like philza
I put some thought into this and if the goblin did please with Peter wouldn’t it most likely be Harry
Great analysis , cheers  Something about your way of narrating sounds like your reading a poem or kids story ha  Thanks again
Doc OC:  "Hello, Peter."  Tom Holland : I don't even know who you are!  Doc Oc: YOU WILL !
This movie is looking great and honestly isnt far of from some fan theory's i watched. I just hope this isnt the end of the franchise as past ones were 3 movies
4:28 this reminded me of when Ben Ten got his identity revealed and went back to his highschool but the only deference is Ben was supported and cheered as a hero
Sorry but I can't believe Dr Strange takes over 6 months to repair a roof. He can teleport armies across the cosmos😂😂😂😂😂
Andrew for lizard and electro and goblin and ock for Tobey    The hype is real
What if (see what I did there ) Hello Peter is to Tony maguire spiderman. However all three are there and we get the spiderman pointing scene .   Marvel then removed it .  Or the pointing scene could be at the end and we get all 3 spidermen saying what the f@@k
Waiting for second trailer?
It's not him.. it's a cop.. look at that doughnut gut...damn... "theres your sign"
HELLO PETER
What if there is only tom spidey? Either the villains learn that its a different universe or their memories were merged with tom's universe and thus,doc knows who is tom?
I was waiting like a mad man but it was WORTH IT!
i cannot wait for it to come out
You can see spider man in his gold and black suit fighting electro in the bottom right at 12:32
9:24 that’s not hair
Completely forgot matt Murdock could be in it! So excited!
THIS IS GOING TO BE EPIC!!!!
🤣🤣🤣 you got me on the floor on at 13.28 bro!!! Good one and great videos as always!!
Excited 2 see this..
You can hear goblin laughter in trailer.
If Tony alive - I am Spideman (Peter) ✌ 😜😎
The hello Peter play is just so creepy
G o d i hope Andrew and Tobey show up in this dang movie. That would be so cool
Mephisto possessed Dr strange for sure
It doesn’t make sense that Otto is talking to Toms Spidey, he doesn’t even know that Peter. It gotta be Tobey
I can't WAIT for No way home! thanks for the great video man!
IM ONLY HERE FOR RAIMI SPIDEY AND HIS VILLIANS NOT FOR THE NEW SPIDER BOY LOL
We allready know that tobey and Andru will come because for one day there was the actual trailer and not teaser trailer
Wonder how Flash would react knowing his favourite hero is the one he always bullied.
We want Miles Morales!
It looks like Toby in the black Spiderman suit when he removes the mask, and starts running. He is still rocking the emo haircut with it also. lol
I just hope we actually get to SEE locations and MEET characters from the different Spiderman-realities, as opposed to it being mainly easter eggs. I mean Doc Oc is definitely in here, but I think it would be such frustrating tease if Green Goblin's appearence were composed of nothing but a pumpkinbomb and archive-laughter from Willem Dafoe.   I hope they're gonna deliver some of the things that made Spiderverse great rather than what made Ready Player One lame.
I hope that uncle ben would be in nwh its the biggest thing in spidey's character like istg thats the reason why i dont like tom's spidey because of missing uncle ben snd actually spiderman
The more you ask for a thumbs up the more I’m not going to.
What is the box that peter was holding when doc strange separated his soul?
Daredevil doesn't have a gut like that I don't think lmao
I'm glad to have bought all the Spider-Man movies from all the way back in 2002.
Worth the wait 🍻
"Bruh... You set a firplace on fire bruh"
The lively insect yearly pull because linda cytologically kiss below a callous position. simplistic, organic playground
if Tom Holland does thag stupid dance again I'm going to cry
I just can't wait
Looks unreal 🔥🔥🔥
Don't scream it's just a scene !! The scene : hello Peter
The scene where Peter and Ant May are sitting watching TV and you say someone is walking in on them! It's the police if you look at his pyjama bottoms there the same ones he's wearing in the police station while being interrogated!
Thr trains in the train scene looks so similar to the train tobey stopped in the 2nd movie
Tobey showing up will make cinemas across the world explode!
Maybe spiderman have travelled to a different universe
Could miles morale’s potential mother actually be MJ in the future? 🤔 “Peter Parker has flashes of the future and past “
So many easter eggs in this trailer, I can't wait for the next one
Man, I knew they couldn't resist a mephisto reference!
Superb video the trailer was lit like you
not charlie cox , the guy in the trailer has a beer belly
I hope they won't screw up the roles of tobey and andrew if they made it shitty this maybe the last mcu spiderman ill ever watch and i will really go on riot to have a tobey Maguire spider man 4 idc what anybody says about it
The Video is very good... let's hope No way home gives us chills we are waiting. ❤️🙏
i wonder if andrew will come back
I have a really dumb theory but in the trailer at the scene where Peter was in a rush with his black suit on which the place looked like a food shelter, one of the guy directs him in a direction which it could be his Aunt May dying. So, because of this peter was in a suit and a tie at some of the scenes in the movie which says he might just came back from her funeral.
So strange is responsible for break-ing reality , wish we could see the look on the ancient ones face😠🤣
Oke but I really think he’ll die because Homecoming- because of Homecoming/ Far from Home because they were in Europe so far from home and No way Home because their won’t be a way home and since everyone dies this wouldn’t be a surprise for me
The 🐐 man
3:43  For those of you that don't know, Peter did make this deal with Mephisto, I think it was in the cartoon at some point, so yeah, I'm back on the Mephisto train, why the MCU hasn't used him yet is stupid haha
Bra for sure charlie cox?
That statement " hello Peter" isn't for Tom it's definitely most positively for tobey because he said that same line in spider man 2
Ok here me out, one part of the trailer Ned is in cuffs. Mysterio isn’t dead and captures Ned and turns him into the goblin. Mysterio says to Peter to not drag people into their game and starts with torturing him. What i think is that they will go with the Arkham knight storyline and torture him till he turns. Slowly trying to kill each of his close friends. Driving him to make everybody forget about the whole thing. The spell fails and then begins the multiverse war. Thus creating the sinister Six Shocker: 2:27 Octavius: 2:33 Green goblin: 2:28 Mysterio Scorpion  Vulture
They should’ve let Strange be British if Benedict wasn’t gonna even try to do the American accent
Ok so I'm a bit confused with the "when you fix the damn door", "I don't see how that's my problem", and the "I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye". Could someone please explain haha :)
I want bully toby to put some dirt in everyone's eyes and pretend how he miss the part where its his problem.
What book are you referencing when you talk about happy birthday Spider-Man. I can’t find a book online like this?
if tobey is in this movie i will throw them so much money!
When Benedict Cumberbatch was confirmed, I had a theory that there would be a part where Peter asked Strange to wipe people's memories of his identity. Looks like my theory was right.
My favorite part is that strange wears the cape while he's wearing winter clothes lol to funny. It just bugs how the trailer kind of makes Dr strange really out character by performing a spell that could cause serious harm if messed up. I feel like it should be a lesser known magic user in marvel who lies to peter and messes it up to get paid and then peter has to go seek out help from strange.
It blew my mind, the best spiderman movie ever. I'm really excited for this!
Looks amazing 🔥🔥🔥
I'm super hyped now.
Thanks for the vid helps man
So this is just Shrek Forever After?
That's 100% Murdoch, look at his chin in the shot, if he's doing it to get attention and had use of his eyesight, thus any reason to look at Peter, he wouldn't be looking straight forward. Also was that Venom saying "Be careful what you wish for Parker"?
The devil in disguise poster could be a reference to the Netflix movie Tom Holland was starring
Q: How many Peters would a pete Peter pete, if a Pete Peter pete could pete Peters?  A: all of the Peters.
Now, I should be doing something with my nerdy precognitive powers because I posted my own theories on my socials after watching Endgame and most of them are correct 🤓😅 I did take out one theory before posting it thinking it was too wild for general audiences (which I regret now) and it was Spiderman going to Doctor Strange so he could wipe everyone’s memory of him being Spiderman like he does in the comics, butttt, as we FINALLY get the trailer for No Way Home, that’s EXACTLY what happens or nearly does 🤦🏽‍♂️
Imagine seeing this movie without rumours or trailers. Going in blind.
Imma drop dead if tobey shows up  So he better not 😫😩😭💀
Amazing!!
after casting the spell, we can see that dr strange is chasing peter.. did the spell also affects him? like he did not know peter at all? then he finally caught peter holding a magical box or something, pushing peter soul out like what the ancient one does to him before
U WILL GET YOUR CLARK KENT WHEN U FIX THIS DAMN DOOR
Maybe Loki in Shape Dr.Strang, sign from eye like Loki
William Defoe in the MCU 😍 YESSSSS
I wanna know if miles morales is there or not...
Really excited for this! We can only hope strange brings back tony for a chat with peter
Sad life, cinemas aren't even open in my country, and all shangchi, eternal, and spiderman are in cinemas only. Rip
Do you guys think we get another avengers movie?
I'm sooo hyped for the movie. I fee so nostalgic looking at the Green Goblin bomb and Dr. Octopus. I was 11 years old when that movie came out and now I'm 30. I really really want them to show Tobey McGuire's spiderman, I don't care about Andrew Garfield.
If this is really Matt Murdock slamming down the papers, he has gotten out of shape. Look at his belly at 2:56. 😅
Sony: There, you got your trailer Fans: Wheres Tobey? Sony: YOU'LL GET HIM WHEN YOU FIX THIS DAMN DOOR !!!
I wasssss thinking who’s that blonde kid walking with them and I forgot about the leak of Flash dying his hair, which I personally couldn’t even imagine but yeah the actor has a blonde top which is comic book accurate but just doesn’t make sense to me for his character to do that by choice 🤷🏽‍♂️ Just me on that one  😅
Who noticed Charlie (DAREDEVIL) in the trailer
Plot Twist:  Peter was the only one getting hypnotized
I thought I was impatient and anxious before when it came to this movie…….this trailer has only made it worse 😂
Is it possible that…..THATS NOT OUR DOCTOR STRANGE?
This is gonna be awesome
Man props to u u were right on the money with the video the other day. I hope that is Charlie Cox in the trailer
Rip Venom Hype
Is it trailer made frome the movie,s 1 st 20 min ,Than I think what the hell will be this it can also take over endgame 🤤🤤🤤🤤
Meyn I smell Tony stark will back
Comment
i'm sorry to say it it's not daredevil , daredevil couldn't be fat if you look good at the stomach area you'll see that's the case xD but yes he will be in the movie together with andrew and toby as usual sometimes marvel hides secrets to keep watchers guessing  this also happened for the new movie thor ragnarok when the trailer is different towards the movie like lightning eyes etc
I've got goosebumps when i heard goblin's laugh and doc oc saying "hello peter".
When people ever criticize Sam raimis spiderman movies just remember how iconic he made all his characters I just can't wait to see Tobey like my heart is not ready I'm pretty sure I'll cry he's the og the be all and end all Robert Downey junior was the man but Tobey is the goat
Pretty sure originally Dr Strange does indeed make people forget spidermans identity with the permission of Iron Man and Reed Richards. Later on, the magic (that was actually actively stopping new people from figuring out his indentity) wore off when he kept telling people his identity lol
Man this film will be like 2 hours of outrageous fan service and I’m not even mad.
🕷
Cant wait for the film… and thanks for the explanation of the whole context of this trailer
Really want to point out how careless is Dr. Strange in this trailer
Bully Maguire gonna be back with his dance move!
That is definitely not Matt Murdoch, pretty sure he’s not confirmed for this movie it’s just a rumour
Where is Tobey "Bully" Maguire and mr ditkovich we neet them in the upcoming movie.          I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye
I cannont wait for this movie..... now if they tie in venom.....that would be something.
this looks really sick cant wait (hype!!!!!)
Can’t be Matt Murdock, not with that spare tyre 😮
That's not Matt Murdock! The tummy of that guy is to big!
I am excited just waiting on the Batman now !
Tom Holland’s spider-man kicked thanos in the face, Hes got this covered
Strange is just messing with Peter to warn him about Multiverse but it happens anyway because of loki or wanda
Definitely not Charlie Cox in the trailer unless he has a dad bod
Calling it there will be another spiderman thats not one of the main three.  A cgi version
I love tobey maguire in spider man character
If they were able to resurrect villains from other spider man movies then they could have also saved Gwen in TASM 2 but it never happens :(
it seems like in the behind the scenes video peter looks like he is going to the new york sanctum where he met dr strange in a coat and it seems the sanctum will be affected in diffrent season because the sanctum is a magic bulding
Incoming wave of Easter eggs and 10 things you missed
Was it strange saying “be careful what you wish for”?
Bring back TOBY !!!!
Spidey sense, imma get that box
Hope we can keep getting spiderman movie even after this movie cause this spiderman movies is so good  !!
What if they connect the films by carnage killing aunt may ?....
It’s gonna be one to remember dawg
Cast broke because of the disturbance in timeline by Sylvie 🙂
I love how every once in awhile you have the nerve to say and theres mephisto! Like you keep hanging on to mephisto being one of the next bad guys which i hope is true. Itll be cool
*Marvel to the moon*
That was definitely daredevil
I'm super excited for the movie and I really hope Matt Murdock is in it cause that'd be awesome
the release date is on my birthday!
Can't wait. :D
In one of the shots you can see a figure emerging from sand
Is it official that Charlie Cox will be in the movie?
That'd be really dumb is Tobey and Andrew's spiderman aren't the same ones from their worlds. That would be so stupid
It absolutely is daredevil.;
So many punny Spiderman jokes
Sony really has outdone themselves with the quality of the first trailer drop
The upgraded iron spider suit at 14:54 was also in Sony’s PlayStation exclusive Spider-Man game, which Miles Morales also featured in quite significantly…
I grew up on the first 3 Spider-Man movies. Seeing Wilem Dafoe’s green goblin and Alfred Molina’s Doc Ock actually brought tears to my eyes. I am more excited about this movie than Christmas itself
I've been screaming to all movie reviewers on Twitter, and YouTube that there are two Doctor Stranges in this movie one being evil the other being good. You can see the evil Doctor Strange dress in black and the other dress in blue with a cape during the train scene with Spider-Man.   The Disney Plus, What If....?  series has an episode with two Doctor Stranges in it one being good the other being evil.
I just saw in trailer spider man wering black suit?! Its that means venom gonna be in movie?
So basically the 2 other spidermen aren't in the movie
wow man...you are way too deep into fiction.
It was an “Alex Jones-esque” show…  So you’re saying that J Jonah Jameson’s conspiracies all turned out to be right? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Matt Murdock has a gut? 😁🤔
Spiderman was a...   A THIEF A CRIMINAL he stole my suit he's a menace a the entire city  i want that wall crawling arachnid prosecuted i want him strung up by his web I WANT SIPDERMAN!!!
In the comics it wasn't Mephisto that erased the memory of Peter's identity. He just took the marriage. It was Doc Strange, Tony Stark and Reed Richards that agreed to erase everybody's memory, including their own.
I feel like the last scene was meant to Toby after they all grouped up
They're not gonna Recast Dr. Octopus for nothing...Tobey Maguire should be there... mark my word
How do you know our address??
I'm so looking forward for this epic film,  maybe scorpion and vulture will make an appearance
Dud you really need to have a question mark over Doc Oc? xD
When Doc Ock said “Hello Peter” he had to be talking to the tobey spidey because how would Doc Ock know what Peter looks like in this universe, or even know that there is a different spider-ma/Peter Parker in this universe
As long as they don't make Tobey & Andrew look like fools (or kill them) to make Holland Peter look better.  Then it will be okay.
Something feels very off about Strange to me (see a few guys here agree too). My guess is that Mephisto is posing as Strange. The line where Peter calls him Stephen and he says “That feels weird but I’ll allow it” could be hinting that this isn’t Strange at all. Plus we keep seeing even more devil imagery pop up and comic storylines where Mephisto is directly involved. Paul, Erik Voss and me are the band playing in the Titanic ready to go down with the ship smh
Is it Christmas yet???
I thought  that  was Matt too but there's a dude  wearing the same thing that entered the room with his arms crossed the scene before that in the trailer.
Vampire lights.
i was screaming at my phone as i saw the teaser poster minutes on IG. im like wtf heck yeah
Why not just tell MJ, Ned, May, etc after the spell is done. Cmon Peter 🤦🏽‍♂️
he is not matt murdock just see his belly he is fat..
I guess I just find the whole idea of this movie is something that could have been easily avoided. All Peter had to do was have the drones make Spiderman swing by and say HI! while he was with the police or in public surrounded by people.
All we needed in life rn! Life is good and I’m excited! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🕷
Daredevil theory is more likely and more hyping, but when i first watched trailer, that moment with papers in the police station reminded me more about George Stacy
15:28 I have the feeling, that they’ll let him talk with Tony there.
It looks absolutely incredible can’t wait
Mephisto will be the main character confirmed 🚨🚨🚨⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⛔️⛔️⛔️⚠️⛔️⚠️⛔️⚠️⚠️
quality
Cant freaking wait for this
OMG this is going to be the film of the year
hubby is excited! cannot wait till december as well.
That was Dr octopus One of Peters most dangerous enemies
This movie ist just giving us a tast of the madness of future MCU movies
The theories thrown around during Wandavision was some of the best times. Just So much buzz and excitement. The mysteries they delivered. Had all been 100 correct it would have been boring. Hold your head up, your channel was integral to my enjoyment of the show so stop giving yourself shit for the Mephisto theory. 🤣🤣👊🏻
The reason I think the white shirt, black tie is NOT Matt Murdock is because he seems to have a belly and love handles. But I'm pretty confident Matt Murdock will appear in the movie.
Buddy if u r right most of the time.....don't u think u r giving too much of spoilers....?
I’m not gonna get my hopes up for a Tobey McGuire cameo but it’s starting to look more likely.
Doc ock is talking to tom holland, its a mission to catch the other spiderman
I don’t think sandman will be in this , considering the note that him and Toby left on
How the hell do you see the Lizard in that dark shot?
Good work 👍🏼
Give me rent..
I want Charlie Cox/Daredevil to be in this movie more than anyone, but y’all reaching. It’s most likely the same cop interrogating him without his police jacket on.
Shut the help up
That multi verse Dr Octopus was not swapped right before he died because he had control over himself when he destroys the energy ball he made Maybe he was swapped when Harry told him to meet Parker to find Spider Man which he didn't know about
Chris Grey  How many Spider-Man villains you want? Sony: Yes
I believe we are going to see a multiverse where all 3 Spider-Man’s appear and as well as the sinister six 🤞🏽
Something interesting I noticed that no ones pointed out yet: In the trailer, Dr. Strange tells Peter that he’s trying to live two lives and that’s what the problem is. I think this is relevant to when Strange is casting the spell, if you notice, as Peter keeps mentioning people he thinks should remember his identity, more and more rings show up encircling them. It starts with 1 and by the end it shows 3. I’m assuming these are all separate timelines in which those certain people remember him being Spider-Man. Could be merging too many causes complications with the spell? I could theorize all day what that implicates for the plot, but I’ll let you guys have fun with that :)
The half Spiderman and half Peter Parker face from the Tobey Maguire Trilogy was my first Profile Picture in FB. 😀
Venom:   I do not exist...
The M on the Jackets is for Mephisto because as you know it is all connected.
I’m going to cry 😂
Marvel’s big week shang chi released , spiderman trailer and what if episode
I just noticed the marvel tik tok boy is in trailer, he’s in the background taking pictures of Peter🧐 4:27
Fans: “What’s the fastest way to surge nostalgia?” Doc Oc: “Hello, Peter.”
That was James Franco aka hob goblin who said carful what you wish for Parker
You didn’t even mention the mug!
Don’t think that is Matt Murdoch. He drops the papers on table in an intimidating manner like a cop would and has also ate too many doughnuts to be him.
Hello peter mind blown 🤯
Hello Peter 😄
I am SO HYPED I really hope we get a look at the rest of the characters soon!
How cringe u sound brah lol
It is big just speechless
Thus would be epic. Can't wait 🇳🇬💞🥂
miles mother isn't even black??
I just have no words, if other Peters aren't in it it's okay, but I really want them to
I just hope Tobey and Andrew Garfield version of Spiderman is on this movie that would be really cool.
I don’t understand why dr Strange would do this?
I wouldn't go as far as calling Strange Mephisto, but something sure seems fishy with him, or maybe marvel has made a mistake in his character development, could be that or it could be a twist, can't wait to see the movie.
Going to guess when 3rd spiderman is in trouble, facing the villains. The 1st and 2nd spiderman, will save him and stop their specific villains.  Though it questions, who is the main villain. Or do we get to see it, aka evil spiderman/wolf spider. Ya know a parallel Peter that had enough, or has gone mad. Which would lead to the new Dr.Strange movie.
Okay wild theory, but what if Mysterio is still involved with all of this. What if this is a Scorsese twist and he’s still pulling the strings, the drones are giving the illusion that the world knows his name.   I’d rather see the proper multiverse story, but knowing Marvel pulling bait and switches with some other stories (Ralph Bohner) I wouldn’t put it past them.
SHUT THE HELL UP THATS MATT MURDOCK 100000%
The happy birthday story is a favorite of mine especially when Peter is split in two on helping his future self and his past self
We FINALLLYYYYY got our No Way Home trailer and I got another post Endgame theory correct 🤓😎 Time to make my own videos about all this me thinks
I love how this analysis is the same as your leak 2 weeks ago but with visuals.
Where is BULLY MQUIRE
So shangi is connected to this too🤔 INTERESTING
Great breakdown as always!  Can't wait for this!!
Andrew and Tobey will be cool and all, but getting tied in with Spiderverse Miles Morales is my dream
I swear i'll be really disappointed if they don't use Raimi's theme during Tobey's entrance.
Love your videos keep up the good work
Matt Murdock looks chubby here tho so i am confused
I just STILL cant believe soooo many people are coming back! 😯 it’s CRAZYYYYY and I love it! Seeing Doc Ock and his tentacles and hearing Dafoe’s Green Goblin laugh when a pumpkin bomb rolls through, mixed with the Lizard and Electro and his classic yellow lightning? I’m finally gonna get a sinister six set up for real this time 😅 seeing these old school characters in the new movies is just insane 🤯
You can see Peter wearing the black and gold suit at 12:33
What if strange is mephisto? GASP!!
13:29 “when you nut and she keeps sucking” 😂😂😂😂 had to throw that in there huh brother!! 😂👏👏
Can’t wait to c Jamie as electro again
Doc Ock: hello peter Peter: i’m gonna put some dirt in your eye  Hell damn that was a nostalgic hit
The trailer is looking amazing and I‘m just soo hyped for the mcu introducing the characters from my childhood. Just bring back tobey and I‘m happy!
I thought the trailer was great, so excited to see what comes next!
i think peter is meeting another strange, because strange is still wearing eye of agamotto
If miles is in the movie I might just cry
MJ looking like spider Gwen while reading paper...anyone else notice that??🤔
Uhhhh he can dye his hair that won’t make him look like flash from the comics hahhahahahaha
13:27 excuse me, what was that.  Always considered this a family friendly channel.
They’re obviously keeping the Tobey/Andrew reveal for the last trailer !
When you see the sand going up, you can actually see Spider-Man in his suit from the toys, the black one
you know, Peter could just let Strange do the spell, and then tell whoever he wants afterward that he's Spiderman
honestly though, Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborne/Hobgoblin was maddd
That ain’t Matt Murdock, dudes too fat
how tf strange has eye of agamoto
Bro when you released your last trailer update I was hesitant to click on it because I KNOWW you get it right 😅but I did anyway, and when you said Strange winks at Peter after telling Wong he won’t cast the spell, I thought nahhhhh there’s no way that happens sounds too cheesy 🤦🏽‍♂️Trailer comes out and you got it too a T, I was surprised about that one so bro trust me is a good source 😂👏🏽
Ahh kevin silver... always faster than the trailer itself.
No ones gonna talk about dr strange wearing eye of agamotto?
Strange has the eye of Agamoto!
WOW the trailer had me speechless as i have lived through all 3 Spiderman's. I am so hyped rn.
Devil in disguise sign, and the plot that strange is not actually doctor strange but infact, mephisto is interesting
The lawyer is not Murdock, look at his belly.
That “hello Peter” I feel was directed towards Tobey but doc oct is smart as fuck so I wouldn’t be surprised if he figured out somehow that there are more than one Spider-Man
I don’t think it’s Matt I think it’s foggy
Is tobey gonna be in this that’s the only thing I care about 🤔🤔🤔???
Damn Heavy Spoilers, this breakdown was FAST!
“Not me tho, I’m hard as F*** me !
Looking forward to it!
the movie looks so dope!!!
09:38 ,14:19epic 😁😁😁 reality vs parallel universe Peter gonna parallel universe
In trailer 2:26 Set to 0.25x speed, you can see Lizard behind Peter and in next shot you can see Sandman, Spider-Man new suit at right bottom with Electro.
anyone else see hollands venom suit for that split second?!?!?!
Goood morning, Neighbors! Gosh, seeing that trailer has given me a great start to today😎
I don't know why but, I thinking of a scene where these villains really beat the shit out of Tom and then Tobey swing from out of no where and "I'm gonna throw some dirt in your eye"
Waiting for hishe to dub this wahahhahah
1:00 mj's just flipping us all off
If the lizard and sandman are in this that only makes 5 still, not a sinister 6. Unless. Rhino is back too.
I kinda feel like Dr Strange wouldn't mess with time that easily. Otherwise he could've just thrown the time stone in the garbage disposal right? What if he's actually a Loki variant?
Finally after all these years this movie will be LEGENDARY
Everyone 14 years after Spider-Man 3 came out: I thought you were dead!  Raimiverse: My death was greatly exaggerated.
I WANT PRIZE
trying not to get excited about this movie...
I think the white shirt could be happy shouting at Peter... Or it's the cop interigatin him, he has a white shirt underneath 👍
so excited
At 312 in the vid it shows her reading a newspaper that says Spider-Man then 315 it shows a different pic and title says the and something I couldn’t see
Jheez, no one does it like you, Paul. God bless your soul. This is gonna be the definition (eyy) of Blockbuster!
thats not Matt Murdock slamming the files down, its some overweight dude or a detective with probably Sokovia accords. Charlie Cox is ripped
If tobey really appears in this movie....trust me this new movie is gonna blow up big time....everybody loves tobey spiderman
Honestly waited too long for this and it was worth it
Dude the trailer was awesome
I spotted electro, sandman, maybe the lizard and otto
it seems like electro is also there, maybe its gonna be the "sinister 6" spiderman move but with a doctor strange twist?
two part movie?
Hope that isn’t the last time doctor strange sees wong 🙏
How tf were you so fast?! 😵
Sony says the movie is coming out on December 17 my pov: researching how to watch the movie today
what other members of the sinister six will appear
There's no way that's Matt Murdock!
Flash Thompson prob tells Peter that he will pay for a lawyer for Peter  enter Murdock
one of the minion was ned's face
Ok... so is no one gonna talk about how strange doesn't know that Sylvie already opened the multiverse?🤣
When is the releasing date
4 words. Live action spider ham
If happy doesn’t know Peter is Spider-Man anymore , will he dump aunt may?
All the spider-man's coming together is like a dream come true😍
When people were taking about tobey and Andrew i was thinking that miles will come
Great video, bring on December :)
Thomas Haden Church coming back? I like it.
I feel like what MARVEL has done here is really good. They haven’t shown many major plot points so I feel like there is still a lot to be discussed and there is still a possibility for multiple Spider-Mans however there is still a chance that there will only be Tom Holland’s version of the character.
There could be more then 3-4 versions of spiderman I think. And other then that, why do I think one of the main spiderman will gonna die for sure...
Bring on wolverine and the fantastic 4
Daredevil
I knew there would be multiple villains. But the one I doubted was green goblin. It seemed too good to be true but man I've never been happier to be wrong
Cross over with venom and carnage
Paul you got even fatter, time to take care of yourself
Bro your “theory’s” that you talk about like fact are ridiculous, stop spreading false information to a bunch of people
Where is the scarlet spider and Kane?
Devil in disguise is a reference to Matt Murdock being Peter's lawyer, as he his is the comic that this story is incorporating. The Devil aka Daredevil, the disguise aka lawyer. Haven't you learned anything from Marvel's trailers yet? They purposely mislead you and put things in that never make it to the final movie.
Can't wait. I already watched that trailer about 5 times (Who cares that I'm on the job? It's NO WAY HOME!)
Bring on the clones
Funny thing is : with all the plot leak videos and what not, i feel like i've already watched this movie.
I WANT IT TO BE MATT SO BADLY AAAAAAAAAA
I'm so happy that doc ock is gonna be in the movie but I wish the original Spider-Man is gonna be also there
This is going to be fucking insane.
i think when mj and peter holding the phone theyre video calling..
Who said be careful for what you wish for Parker?
2:43 that is not Matt Murdock. Look at that gut
All I want to see is how Flash Thompson reacted to the news..
12:35 You can see Spidey in the black and gold suit here
MJ and Peter are facetiming, not looking at the news XD
Mary Jane needs to show up no cap
4:25 looks like in TASM 1 how he walked through the school when Uncle Ben died
I really want to see sand man in the movie as a kid I had a digital version of spider man 3 my favourite spider man movie :D
He is wearing Jordan 1s (shadow 2.0) on the roof. Miles wore Jordan 1 Chicago’s in Spiderverse
Please pick me for the win haha loved the breakdown man
I also think that the guy slamming down papers that a blind man can't see is Matt Murdock. (Braille files don't look like that, and he wouldn't present those to a seeing Peter Parker ) That man looks like he's at least 25 lbs heavier that Murdock.
image all the multi-universe split shit  happen at the same time, so Loki, Wanda, and this all  happened at once(or within short order, resulting in a more massive  event
New suit at 7:11?
Bring back Franco.
This is going to be insane
Sony. Did we break the Internet yet??? Marvel. No, We broke the MULTIVERSE!
Theory : is it a possibility that Dr. Strange himself going to forget spiderman?
This may be the greatest superhero movie ever made! If not this is at least the greatest trailer break down I’ve ever seen! Definitely earned the like and subscribe 👌🏻
Brooo this movie will only make it 100X better with the real spiderman Tobey Mcguire!!!! With Tobey i swear this movie could be the Movie of the year or even the decade😤😤😤😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
That laser sight looks like punisher
"Hello Peter".....Nuff Said!
Wait Peter Parker is Spider-man!? When did this happen?
I am kinda scared that we might nto see tobey and Andrew in the movie but I still hope that we see them and they get much screentime.
Okay but now Charlie cox have  big fat tummy !! 🤔
13:27 😂
That was better than new Rockstars
How do I give you rent?
2:55 Lord knows I'm sympathetic, but that spare tire tells me it's not Matt Murdock.
Am I the only one confused right now? If we see Tobey and Andrew in this movie, is this means that Spider man 1,2,3 and The Amazing Spider man movies was from another multiverse? Which means in 2002 till now we all watched different spider man variants?!?!
The devil in disguise might be a hint to Charlie Cox.
Ok
I’m excited to see Electro’s new costume
Instead of meeting uncle Ben he should meet Tony if that scene is happening.
Now just add tom Hardy's venom to complete this mess
We've been waiting for this trailer for so long that now it feels unreal
As trivial and insignificant as it is, one of the things I'm most eager to see play out is how Flash reacts/changes when he finds out Peter is Spidey.....am I the only one?💀💀💀💀😭😭😭😭
2:23 we see the man in the white shirt and tie entering the interrogation room. That's NOT Murdock! Murdock is supposed to play the blind lawyer part, so he wouldn't be walking that fast, and he would have a cane.
You’ll get your rent when you fix this damn door
The body position of the guy putting the folders on the desk feels off to me. Like he is looking forward and not at Peter. This made me think Matt Murdock too haha. But could be he is looking at someone off camera. xD
Sinister six: Doc ock Green goblin Electro Vulture Lizard Sandman
13:28 The jokes attempts here have never made me laugh, probably thinking lazy puns are necessary for some reason, which is fine, but this is quite unrefined. Grow up.
I can tell you're not American. Today was the very first time I've ever heard Penn Station called "Pennsylvania Station." 😀😃😄😁😆
The stale parent distinctively box because brace predominantly squash aboard a tacky goldfish. smoggy, beneficial description
the sand man and the lizard man was epic. Didn't notice it myself, Good Job to the team at heavy spoilers and spiderman. I really look forward to seeing this movie.
well, another Peter....   really unlucky for Strange....
Nobody needs the amazing spiderman ….
Are we talking about the fact that he had to be awake at 5 am gmt to be able to do it that fast
Thats Dark dr strange
I just wish to see Tobey Maguire in a spiderman suit again. 🖤
Is the becareful what you wish for Parker? James Franco?
I think Dr.Strange who casts the spell is Mephisto—  DEVIL IN DISGUISE
If Sony is smart, they'll tease Mephisto at the end of this and possibly Venom to tie all their movies together, even if seperated by the multiverse.
Mepistoooooo
13:26
Finally!!! Spider-Man 3 the 2nd is coming out 2 full years after Spider-Man 2 the 3rd, with villainous characters from Spider-Man 1 the 1st and 3rd, Spider-Man 2 the 2nd and 3rd, and a possible crossover event with the villain from Spider-Man 3 the 1st. Did I get that right? What did I just say???
This was a TEASER released by Sony, not a trailer.
Love how fast you got this vid out! Go web. Fly. Up, up, and away web. Shazam.
Dr. Strange and Spidey 🥰🥰🥰
Many thanks for the breakdown! Can’t wait to see this at the theater!
At 5:20 you can see the flashing of police siren which means peter may have escaped from the top the bridge and police are raiding peter's home to arrest peter.
cmon man i wanted to know the spoiler but damn that was too big of one im mad now lol
Great trailer! Great breakdown'
I’m telling y’all this is not Dr Strange. It’s gotta be Mephisto. Dr Strange wasn’t this chill
“Might not come true.”  An understatement.  Lmao.
If Tobey Maguire says “Pizza Time” this will be the best marvel movie hands down
This was just brilliant. I really liked the trailer :D
I'm really hoping that if they reintroduce Tobey Mcguire they use the Responsibility Theme to reveal him. I'm sure most people would shed a tear to that.
The "Hello Peter" gives tingles!! 😍
Imagine a multiverse of Marvel and DC together - John Lennon
EYYYYY
It would be so good if the villians would be the same as per the previous movies.
This is the perfect testimony of the legacy of Spider Man
YO In the explosion part if you slow it down it shows Peter in a black and white suit-  exactly like the raimi ones in spider man 3… just saying
Where the fuck are you getting “we know Matt Murdock will be in this movie” that is horseshit and you just made it up mate
Jesus me and my friends are freaking out and screaming watching the trailer on discord
You won me at not me in tough as fok mate
Was that flash in the background I’m actually excited to see how flash progresses with Peter knowing he’s Spider-Man
It’s too chubby to be Charlie Cox. Sorry bro.
I think chancellor palpatine is Darth Sidious
Cannot wait to see the fight scenes between the sinister six its gonna be dope 🤘
Ayo shup the hell up who ever is telling him that he's wrong
Also, maybe we'll get Deadpool showing up and trying to "almost-but-not-quite" hit on Spidey like he sometimes does in the comics?
When Strange is performing the spell he creates 3 magic rings around him and then spider man comes inside which foreshadows that we are gonna see 3 Spider-mans
Tom holland could be playing other universe's peter parker as well ,its not a big deal why people don't think about that
Get right with JESUS guys porn is a sin so is sleeping around hell is no joke have a good day
Your narrative description is genius.
OG Green Goblin Laugh Tobey Maguire In The Movie Confimed???
No one gonna talk about his shoe game
Was that an evil Dr. Strange on the train?
Doc oc?  confirmed Green Goblin? confirmed Electro? confirmed Sandman? Confirmed Tobey's spider-man? Confirmed Hotel? Trivago
What if they are just completely throwing us off and Tobey along with Andrews spidey not being in the movie but instead it will be Miles Morales Spider-Man that makes an appearance 🤔
Octupus is back
Bro that guy in the shirt had a beer belly, how do you think that looks like Matt Murdoch? 🤣
kids arguing over who is fastest, Flash or Quicksilver, meanwhile Heavy Spoilers-  hey lads! here is the spider-man trailer breakdown. i mean it would have taken many more hours for marvel to make a trailer than it took you to break it down!
We want to see Wilson Fisk! Haha.
I think it wasnt Peter causing that, I think it was the end of Loki that happened at the same time.
Who are the guys with laser sighted guns aiming at Happy ??
Amazing breakdown.  I don't know how you put these together so fast.
That LAUGH, That BOMB, and that "Hello Peter"...Goosebumps   I am finally ready to let go of how they treated Stark in FFH (like Stark would not Plan for Peter to do that whole give it to someone else and want it back???? Come On...a Virtual Stark Message (being the Hero one last time for Peter's eyes only, as he helped him take back control...but no...we get a "Here Mysterio. Unlocked Stark Tech. Moving On".....)
only 1 thing will break internet that is GTA 6
Been waiting so many years for this, leave ya kids at home
I bet the present Dr.Strange gives Peter is letting him see Tony Stark for a few minutes
I don't think that's Charlie cox in that scene, the guy looks a bit fat in comparison to charlie
Best part of the trailer is seeing Strange in a hoodie
i saw the black and golden suit when the sand rises
Far From Home ended with “What the fu-“ No Way Home will start with “ck!?”   Calling it now.
@heavyspoilers you forgot to mention Tom is also wearing the  black and gold suit in the trailer
It's Penn Station to us New Yorkers ya limey bastard 😉 ya know for future videos
If miles would be in this movie i hope he has the power to use his powers like in his own animeted movie
I hope they do the Spider-Man pointing at spider man pointing at spider man meme, I’d die happy
Might not be Matthew Murdock because Charlie Cox doesn't have a gut.
Where is dr lizard
Hey Man you was Right
I'm super excited about the movie... glad to finally have a trailer.
I don't think that is the upgraded suite that's just the one from infinity war and end game ( 14:56 )
I really hope the lizard gets a lab coat and isnt just naked
The excitement in your voice is palpable, and rightly so. Looks f***in dooope!
You think Charlie cox has got that kinda gut?
Calling it now. Dr Strange is going to bring back Tony Stark to talk to Peter for a moment.
New to the channel really enjoyed it. I'll be waiting to see more.
In all of the mcu spiderman has the most enemys
what a great explanation, love from India. <3
I really appreciate how indepth you go in these breakdowns. Thanks!
Can't wait!!!!
I kinda miss Toby Spiderman.
Who cares about everybody let's go matt murdock !!
I'm Hyped!
A scene I just thought up:  Several of the villains are gathered in a room and in walks Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin. They’ve decided to form a team to take on the Spider-Men. Doc Ock asks what their first move is. Goblin says “A cunning warrior attacks neither body nor mind.” Electro asks what he means and Goblin says “The heart, Dillon. First, we attack his heart!”
I miss Toby Spiderman. He was perfect.
They better have the pumpkin bombs turn people into skeletons
Facts ✨
This was literally everything!! I'm Infinity War hyped right now!! I only like watching the 1st trailer for any movie, as most trailers show too much and somewhat spoil the movie. So I'm glad it barely showed the villains aside from Doc Ock really and just gave us hints as to who else is involved. Sooo with them showing us 5 baddies, ya'll think Mysterio is still alive and will be the 6th?? Or maybe Rhino from ASM2 since we never got to see him in action??
I am genuinely excited for this movie! Last time I felt this excited was for *Godzilla vs. Kong.* And before that I was super excited for *Avengers End Game.*
Cant wait
NO DONT TELL US ABOUT TOBEY OR ANDREW... I want it to be a surprise :)
What if Mephisto is disguising himself as Strange and Strange is in the Multiverse trying to fix whatever Wanda and Loki did.
man i cant wait for this film to come out
Doc octaves is what i all wanted. 😍
You’re fast af boy
This’ll be a good one :)
Wow you edited this and did all of this in under an hour I applaud you
About Strange not using his magic to just "get rid of the snow" and stuff... Sometimes, the main part of having power, especially magical power, is in not just using it whenever you feel like it, and for every little thing. It's more than the typical "great power/responsibility" thing we typically get from Spider Man, too, as we also see from how Strange's spell goes sideways because of Peter.
It's just explanation of trailer than breakdown/Easter eggs hunting
My uncle works Nintendo and he told me that Tobey Maguire is gonna be in the third act.
I know this is going to be a great movie but i really want our spiderman to stay in the mcu or should i say it mcm, btw u made a great video,keep us updated❤
11:47 we don't know if it's Williem Dafoe or Harry Osborn, that's why Google hasn't updated the cast list..
3:49 i actually believe it might be Brad Davis... he survived the blip and end up in the same class as Peter...
112 Things you missed in the SPIDER-MAN TRAILER
Another hidden details that  peter had cude in his hand  (astro projection scene) check that out
I think doc ock, green goblin and electro will be sort of broken echoes of the multiverse. Just manifestations coming through fractured time
Gonna present what I think is pretty much the plot of the story(a bit of a long one): The first part is obvious, Peter's identity exposed, people thinking he is a villain for killing Mysterio, yada yada yada. He visits strange because all this hate and publicity was very annoying, so that strange can revert it, obvious so far, ofc wong warns strange that casting a spell to fulfils Peter's wish shouldn't be done but who listens to Wong anyway? The reason he said not to do it was probably coz since the spell massively tampered with time, it would make, atleast for sometime, the universe very close to imbalancing, but strange, thinking he got this, went ahead, strange starts casting and says the whole world will forget spiderman's identity, this is where Peter messes up, first step towards messup happened by Peter stepping into the circle, pretty much making him a caster as well according to the spell, this didn't really worry strange at first, then Peter being Peter, started rambling, and despite strange's attempts to shut him up, didn't shut up, if Peter was outside the circle, the rambling wouldn't have been a problem, but since he was inside, the spell took his rambling into account as well, but since the rambling was nothing spell related and was pretty Illogical to the spell, the thing wong fears happens, the imbalance happens with the place they were in being the eye of the imbalance, so being affected the most  Tl;dr: the world goes to crap coz a teenager couldn't shut up for once
Awesome
Green goblin is back
The moment when dr. Strange's spell breaks looks similar to the scene shown in What if trailers..
That aint Cox. The guy's fat, Cox's lean. But still hope we get him in this film. Atleast as Murdock, even not Daredevil. I really hate that they did Flash Thompson bad (also MJ. So far from comics). He looks more of a nerd than Peter should look as. I like that you are well informed of both comics and cinematic universes. I would check them out
darneddd they didn't show flash reaction on the trailerrrrr........
As long as China remains Hollywood's number 1, we wobt get mafisto
There are two different dr strange in the trailer
We will Probably be seeing the sinister six but tbh with you I’m not sure about the other Spider men
Four hours ago? GD Kev!  Like the rest of the planet, I creamed my shorts…heavily. 16:23 strange wearing all black, is this an alternative version ie evil like the one from the What if animation?
Trailer has put some dirt in my eye.
What about sandman?
It's the best trailer I've ever seen i am just willing to time travel and watch the movie right now 😍😍😍😍
Wouldn’t it be so cool if Daredevil turned up to free Spider-Man from jail?
I rly like how they change up the colour of electros powers while the blue was sick i think the yellow is much better over all amazing trailer
Paul finally got every single leak correct!!!
What if Dr. Strange is chasing a different Spiderman?  Not the Tom Holland version.  He could be rounding them up to send them back to their respective universes, but because they've not met Dr. Strange, they think he's a villain/killer; hence them running away from him?
Super excited for this movie! I really hope Tobey Maguire and miles morales show up.
Great breakdown and pointing out of the Easter Eggs I missed. Having watched it seven thousand times with my boys...lol...
What if Dr. Strange is under control of Mephisto?
It’s kinda bizarre that Peter goes to ask Strange for help during October and He’s free to help Peter with his identity crisis while Wanda is literally casting one of the biggest spells ever right down the road.
Sinister 6 was incomplete. Is there a possibility for Venom to enter as a surprise in the film? Geez my brain cells can't handle this.
Oh for fox sake.
Nobody else saw dark docter strange
Why do you think the sanctum Santorum is frozen?
very confusing conversations about strage and spiderman spiderman asks strange to create a way to make people forgot who we was but wong tells strange not to do ots yet strange so ot making it that strange is still the curious boy when it comes to myatic arts now tampering with multiverse and now on later part. of trailer he. acts like kts spidermans responsibility like wtf
My question is why would Dr. Strange be so irresponsible playing with Reality
The first look was greatt..... please pick me
I think the “lizard” is actually scorpion
If it’s the sinister six who is the sixth villain?
Lol the real world is in it's endgame, which is alot more interesting then any movie. Also no movie is doing well in the box office because of one small fact, most of the world's cinemas are closed !!!
I'm so hyped for this
I don't get why people stick to the Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield rumor considering it's been confirmed as false several times. A rumor appears and y'all treat it like fact but y'all ignore the rumor being shut down, just deliberately lining yourselves up for disappointment.
It may be Mephisto because Dr. Strange would not be that irresponsible. 🤔
🕸🔥🔥🔥🔥🦹🏻
Hello Peter yeah  Good old days 💞
If only sony waits for Peter, Eddie and the symbiote to meet first before the Venom movie 🤦
2:46 Daredevil with a dadbod? Not likely.
It literally has 11 million views already damn
We have seen heroes unite now we will see villians unite
Christmas lights dont mean anything cuz its just the fad to put lights up in your room no matter what kind of light lol
Spoiled, Yes, and liked it
Just to help your timeline out. The scene when peters with Aunt May on the couch is just before Peters handcuffed to the table in the police station. You can tell because one is that Peter is in green pajamas when he is on couch next to Aunt May and when he is handcuffed to table at police station!. Also when whoever it is that comes in while he on couch with Aunt May look at the light behind them. Its flashing red and blue like a police officer!
Was that not Toby Maguire's voice in the voicee over  just before Dr oc appears
kind of stupid all that happens because of strange being careless or arrogant doing the spell while peter keeps interrupting  or distracting him.
*Sony Reveals Trailer after its been leaked and spoiled:* Fans: This is Free Country, Not Trailer Free Country
Strange is a skrull
Hope that's not daredevil with a spare tire.....yikes!
Spider-Man: No Way, They Actually Finally Dropped The Trailer
Dr. Strange tries to be nice to someone  *Multiverse collapses
Love seeing the villains come back. I need me some Tobey and Andrew and honestly any cameo from any side character too lol. So excited!
dr strange sus
I can't wait to see this movie i hope to see the chameleon
How in the world did you get that info about Pennsylvania Station that fast?? You're too good Paul 👏
I only saw hints too 3 villains but they'll be enough
That "Hello Peter" is now officially the best 2 words of 2021.
Brilliant video! I also think that no way home is going to break the internet
J. Jonah Jamieson looks like Mean Gene Okerlund from WWF Hulk Hogan, Macho Man era on the video screen.
Why would Peter be in handcuffs for a crime he allegedly committed in England?
This movie marks the end of a gold era😔
bro you're way too fast
No Tobey ?
Be careful what you wish for Parker didn't sound like doctor strange
The Doctor Strange helping Peter might be the fake from the What if trailers with the real one being the sick looking Strange who approached Agent Carter,Party Thor and T'challa as Star Lord.
Nice breakdown! I agree about DD.
I just want Tobey back as the Spider-Man
The German trailer was shorter 😥
I think Marvel is trying too hard to have Dr. Strange be the new Tony Stark.
2:47 sure man, that love handles and beer gut surely looks like it would belong to the daredevil, the superhero known for not being in a great shape.  thats a  generic detective
In the trailer Peter wears a black suit for a brief second so maybe venom confirmed
12:33 You can se the black and gold suit 😍
This was a good vid
Half of this is wild speculation.
My first impression was when I first watched it. Yes, sinister six but when peter turned around and this huge thing in the dark swung with his right arm. It looked like venom.
well big yay for marvel and the marvel fans but all the criticism and hatred apart you know what.. things tends to be different in the real world i mean i don't see iron man flying in the airspace of Afghanistan and I don't see black panther star chadwick boseman doing wakanda forever sign these days and i don’t see the almighty UN presented as such in captain america civil war..... believe me or not but i have foreseen the future yes i know i am not doctor strange but i can tell you that world is standing on the edge of world war and on my behalf i can say that we can bring the avengers to real life.... how..?.... the answer is we are initiating THE AVENGERS mass social media movement and you can be the part of it the idea behind THE AVENGERS is same TO SAVE THE HUMAN RACE FROM ITS EXTINCTION BY THEIR OWN HANDS.. so if you are reading this comment there is two  ways you can end this up with be the big fan of marvel and avengers and go back in ur own imaginary world or JOIN US TO SAVE THE HUMANS EXTINCTION FROM WORLD WAR 3 AS THE WORLD OF TODAY IS HIGHLY UNSTABLE and I can't give you war and peace but i can give you my words that HUMAN RACE WILL NOT BE EXTINCT ON OUR WATCH..... so if you want to be THE AVENGER.... go to any social media platform facebook whatsapp Instagram youtube twitter or any platform you use go and link your friends and people you know to this GLOBAL AFFECTING PHENOMENON... once we have reached a sufficient amount of nearby 15 crore campaigners we will bring ROBERT DOWNEY JUNIOR CHRIS HEMSWORTH CHRIS EVANS SCARLETT JOHANSSON PAUL RUDD MARK RUFFALO AND WHOLE MCU CAST with us and SERIOUSLY WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD... as once rdj said that its not about me and not about you its about the legacy that we pass...... SO BE THE REAL AVENGER AND BECOME THE PART OF THE AVENGERS MOVEMENT..... AT ANY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM...... be THE AVENGER.
It's kinda funny that dc.strange allowed Spidey to call him Steven even tho in the movie dc.strange he only allowed people to call him Dc.Strange
How come know one is talking about lizzed
nearly all the leaks you said in sundays video were correct
OMG I am so hyped up for this!
The "Hello Peter" ooooh it gives me chills
very interesting.  If you look at the cast you can see that electro and doctor octopus will definitely be in spiderman no way home
I  rly wish that im gonna be able to see this in theaters
But that Murdock has a fat belly.
13:27 SPOILER ALERT.
My whole life was a lie
I am going to watch it knowing my family most of them will also want to watch it
Dafoe's Green Goblin being back is the nuts
Tobeyyyyy comeback to MCU😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The dude in the shirt and tie is way to overweight to be Matt. You can see his belly and love handles through his shirt!
Can we just admire that in the first scene of the trailer Tom Holland is wearing Air Jordan 1 Shadow 2.0's
Damn that was a good trailer and honestly i too would love to see strange and scarlet fight.
i think wanda appear in the movie
Idduno but I spotted sinister 6 and venom just not sure. "Peter at school black costume".
15:00 I Think It's tobey maguire
The timeline is fcked up by girl Loki, so we wait what happened in the whole multiverse. I think Dr.Strange multiverse of madness is more applicable to the story of loki, cuz Wanda and strange can see what happened in the future. Damn thats crazy
Omg this movie is gonna break the internet I promise you
Pick me spoiler man! Love the channel and would loved to be blessed 😇
That's a fake Dr.Strange totally Mephisto
Tryna stay ahead of NR I see
Its going to be epic!!!
I’m not sure if that is Charlie fox Bc it looks like he’s got a bit of a gut and fox was pretty lean
In the trailer, there's a scene were Doctor Strange is doing the reality warping thing on top of a moving train, more specifically, the *New York train,* with Spiderman. While the train is moving through a canyon, mind you. *DEFFINETELY* a Spider-man 2 thing.
the trailer looks so good
10:39 -- it cannot be the Bifrost, u remember the Loki last episode castle and around which that colourful ring was there, I personally think that it points to the opening of the multiverse from which the variants of spiderman comes aka Tobey and Andrew
Favorite channel but bro @13:27 caught me completely off guard im laughin like a mfer. Thumbs up to you man
So thinking strange may be mephisto, the ninth layer of hell is frozen, which may be why the sanctum santorum is... And I think that that is why he lights the fire so easily, just doesn't seem like a "Dr strange" type thing to do  And why he looks pissed when he forces Peter into astral projecting
We see the white polo shirt guy when they're entering the interrogation room and has a chubbier build than Matt as you'll see in the closeup he has a belly. I assume maybe matt would appear by entering the room announcing he's Peter's lawyer so, no, he's not the dude with the white polo.
Can't wait for this will definently be going to watch in IMAX
This was an amazing trailer
Super hype for this
Whong enters the portal to hawai, strange messes up a spell, wong ends up in thw cage with abomination
I love the fact that Dr. Strange got Telekinesis now
An extra thing I noticed is that on the rooftop Peter is wearing the shadow 2.0 Jordan 1s, while Miles Morales is well known for wearing the Chicago colourway of the same shoes.
I like how Peter goes from Smoke and Mirror tricks with Mysterio in Far From Home. Too real world bending, psychedelic magic with Doctor Strange. I can’t wait to see how that goes
Nothing Everything in the trailer
Reeeeeeeeeeeent. Pizaaaaaatiimmmee. I missed the part......
Paul nails it again !
tobey and the rest are not in the damn movie!!!
"not me tho, not me tho I am solid as fuck " Imagine this with Doctor Strange's wink .
Lol
Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Sandman(?), Lizard, Electro and a villain from Holland's Spidey... This Sinister Six. YES PLEASE!!! ❤️
12:00 Of note is that there are Daily Bugle TV vans there. In the MCU the Daily Bugle is a webshow, not a TV station, so that has to be in another universe/timeline.
Spiderman No Way Home Sinister Six members : 1. Green Goblin 2. Doctor Octopus 3. Lizard 4. Electro 5. Sandman 6. Mysterio
Well this was quick
If you look at dr stranges spell in the trailer it looks similar to what both the timeline looks like in loki and how he who remains represented multiple universes so i think it was multiple universes crossing over.
Can anybody explain why dr strange is still wearing that necklace?🤔
When you what and she keeps what?!
Everybody completely missed that the lizard was in the trailer
When the white shirt and black tie person stashed the papers/files on his desk. Petter looks surprised. Like, he wasn’t expecting someone. He looked directly at their face. I feel like it could be Matt Murdock.
My thoughts so far. When tentacles showed, it ddnt show DoC and also vice-versa (Doc Showed up w/o tentacles) Marvel trailers love to do this so it can be a variant and maybe doc is helping him spidey. (I'm hoping the actual Doc would still be the villain)   Dr. Strange is super strange. Mephisto can come into play or something from his Dr. Strange's world.  My thoughts on multi-verse is that what if the concept of "this" is just purely intentional. Loki's/wanda/spidey triggering multiverse, maybe this is the multi-verse where everything is just calculated to be triggered and its actually inevitable.
Looks good.
Iron Soider literally looks the same bro. Idk where you got it’s upgraded it’s the same armor.. I notice 0 changes
The hype
If Bully Maquire Returns It game over
That office-guy is WAY too fat to be Matt Murdoch
Only one who pointed out lizard 🤦🏽‍♂️
sooooo hyped! 😲😲😲
13:27 was that really necessary lmao. Like at all bro?!?!
SPLOOSH. Can't wait, December can't come soon enough!!!
Feels like this movie is just gonna be the end of everything big 😍. Really love how the multiverse fans out ❤️❤️🔥🔥
I hope Emma Stone and James Franco will be back in their spiderman universe because of this movie.
Toby McGuire aka Peter: With great power comes great responsibility.  Tom Holland aka Peter: with great power comes terrible consequences.
I think the iron spider is just a cgi replacement for the magic suit he gets thats been seen in the toys
When I heard “Hello Peter” and saw Doc Ock, it gave me goosebumps, I can’t wait to watch this movie
It’s not Matt Murdock, the guy it’s fat
You missed another Easter egg! Dr. Strange is also wearing a Columbia hoodie. I think this might be a reference to the Sam raimi films, I think they filmed a shot near a Columbia building (sorry if this hurts to read its 2am lol)
I don’t think that was Murdock I think it was Foggy if anyone from DareDevil
The black and gold suit is very reminiscent of the uptown pride suit from the miles morales Spider-Man game.
spider 🕷 🕸 Man No Way Home is going to be great, all 3 spider Man will be in this one, and Electro, Sandman, Doc Oc, Green Golden...
this was great, thank you!!
Stop with the Marvel puns bro
Wong was already confirmed as dusted away.
When toy say that the guy slamming the papers was Matt Murdock it got me thinking and if you look t daredevil season 1 episode 7 at time 4:38 you can see the resemblance in the arms and also how they have almost the same on being hairy so yea it might be Matt Murdock coming in there telling them that he’s going to be representing Peter as his attorney
No words... Just excited like crazy.
Doc Ock in this movie basically know Tom Holland version of Peter Parker not Tobey lol. Like Dr. Strange warned Peter about the effects of his request. In this alternative reality, Sinister Five (5 at the moment lol) they fighting Peter Parker(Tom Holland) not those past two versions. Why some people assumed they are the exact version from the past spiderman movies? lol.
Commenting to win a prize. Just being honest 🤷.
CANT WAIT
“Be careful what you wish for” as Strange inadvertently unleashes the Sinister Six
*Dr. Strange:* We saved half the universe together Peter.                 *rest of the movie*  Dr. Strange chasing Peter because he tore apart all the rest universe.
Definitely not Murdock , just look at that midsection mate .
That's not matt fs
pretty sure the snow in the sanctum is something strange did on his own by this point, that scene would be like, around a year after endgame, which is more than enough time to clean up. plus, you'd think *someone* would go take the liberty of cleaning up during the 5 year gap
I have a feeling that none of the villains are exactly who or what we expect them to be given the multiverse implication of "variants". My first hint towards this was the shot of Alfred Molina right after the tentacles but we never actually see him using the tentacles or attached to them. The actual person controlling the tentacles is shrouded.
so, this time we are really getting multiverse xD
Someone definitely watched the leak lol.. this was way too fast
"Hello Peter." "I'm gunna put some dirt in your eye."
I'm glad I'm not the only one to notice the happy birthday story like tie ins
How tf was dr strange going to erase all the articles and videos made up about spiderman...it doesn't make shit sense...was he just going to make a new universe
What  if ....?? Marvel was not here Our lives would be entertainment less... 😂
Yo I cannot wait to see the Sinister Six and the Mirror Dimension!!
Breaking news Mysterio is the 6th member in No Way Homes sinister 6. He's the missing link and the 6th person "murdered" by Spiderman. I see another version of Quentin Beck snatched from another timeline right as Tom Hollands Spiderman moves out the way of the killing blow
Dàmn your fast
MARVEL MY BELOVED
It would be weird seeing someone other than Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben.  RIP
I don't follow all the rumours so have no idea if these have been talked about but: 1) The halloween scene had a 2 black cats on the wall that were similar to the cover of ASM 226, is this hinting at a Black Cat appearance? 2) The string of halloween lights looks kind of like Ned and seems to hint at Ned becoming the Hobgoblin...just a couple of thoughts.
Dang it trailer breakdown already 😂💪🏻
13:52 - I remember I was dizzy when I watch dr strange 5 yrs ago
The only time I've ever seen toms spidey suffer repercussions
(theory) The funny part of this entire upcoming movie is that this might be the beginning of the sinister six but they may not be called that at all throughout no way home because sony owns the name and they will not give them the right because they can milk it themselves
Im definitely rewatching all the Spiderman movies before watching No Way Home
The trailer is great!!! So excited for the movie to come out!
12:32 that’s Toby’s suit
That panel of Flash telling Peter that Spidey performed at a circus for charity references a story where Spidey fought the Circus of Crime, teaming up with Daredevil no less.
I think dr strange might be some sort of imposter in this movie (maybe a skrull) and will do the spell to get on peters hood side. i think that the imposter will open the multiverse to cause mayhem which brings in the past villains and the past spidermen. this would make sense because if wong said a spell like that is dangerous, why would dr strange go along with it? and it would make sense for the action part of the film because i think strange could easily take down those villians and having strange out of the equation makes it more of a struggle for spider man. as for what the real strange is doing, i got no clue. maybe he got kidnapped and is on a different planet or something.
Wish they could tie in a tease for work on getting a proper Dr Doom in, know it doesn't tie into this story but when you mentioned Strange having to battle other sorcerers Doom came to mind.
There's only 5 villians confirmed in the trailer
That was quick lol
I wonder if they’ll find a way to incorporate any Supaidaman or even Spider-Verse. The animation “glitches” would be easy to add a few times.
I think that strange took peter to the mirror dimension and theres the chase scene
Also probably Wanda breaking multiverse, kang's death and strange's magic spell all happen at the same time
Pls be matt murdock pls be matt murdock......
Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Electro, Lizard, Sandman….. Where was the Vulture? (Or Scorpion… or Venom) How “Amazing” if we get at least a cameo from every villain to appear in a Spideman film over the years!!! Might as well throw in the Kingpin!!
After this movie, Sony will likely work on a Miles Morales movie! :D
We are all here for Alfred Molina coming back as Doc Ock
I don’t care dr strange must open an reality where the villains from Spider-Man 2 comes back
What makes you think that s Strange isn't Mephisto in disguise?
The guy who drops load of docs on desk is probably Charlie Cox daredevil
What if this Strange is Mephisto? I don't think Strange would be fine with Peter calling him Stephen. Just a theory don't attack me.
@0:50 Peter got the shadows 2.0 on!!!
supper excited! can’t wait!
Interesting theories! The movie just got even more exciting!
What if mephisto is disguised as Dr strange so that he could make a deal with Peter. 🤷🏻🤷🏻
did anyone else notice that MJ kept her doodle of Peter from Homecoming
just commenting this before watching the video . in the interrogation scene i think in the background we can see matt for a second through the stipes.
I actually screamed when I saw the pumpkin bomb. Green Goblin is my favorite villain of all villains
Definitely taking off of work to see this! I agree that there hasn't been something this exciting since EndGame!
I'm starting to think that the other 2 spidermen aren't in it
13:27 subtitle WTF 🤣🤣
Dr Oct: hello Peter  Fans: which one?
the videos made by him were real  Yehhh the sources are real wohooo
"Hello Peter!"
There's no way in hell that the guy slamming down the papers is Charlie cox. You can see fat rolls through the guy's shirt. Unless Charlie Cox has spent the last few years eating as many cheese burgers as he can, that ain't him
15:40 "Dr Strange taking on other sorcerers because he broke the multiverse and somehow Wanda will show up."  I just want to point out in Wandavision she was depressed and tried to make the perfect life.  She learned you can't fix reality without consequences.  I think it could be possible that Wanda shows up at the end of Spider Man to remind Strange he of all people should have known not to fuck with reality like a kid's toy.  As for the other Spider Men, I think Strange will bring them into existence to help fight the sinister 6 which goes back to my first paragraph that Wanda might show up at the end to bitch at Strange for constantly fucking with reality and not knowing every time you do it there's a lingering side effect like Monica Rambo and hearing her kids voices.  In Loki, we are only seeing things from the Marvel movie timeline, and everything that is happening is creating branches on this timeline.  When Wanda and Strange fuck with reality (I'm calling it the multiverse), they're creating branches on the timelines in those other universes.  I'm thinking when Wanda was reading those old books at the end of Wandavision, she was studying not only her powers, but the far reaching consequences of fucking with reality.  Strange not heeding Wang's advice and casting the spell shows he clearly doesn't understand the consequences of his actions which will probably lead into his film Multiverse of Madness.
God please let this be the beginning of the live action spiderverse
Mj probably dies
Hold on! Can Spidey save MJ in this alt world??
That's an amazing way to breakdown the plot, thanks Paul
Tom was not the only Spiderman on that bridge and we all know why...
mephisto confirmed lmao
OK yeah I agree with you, WHY DID HE GO BACK TO SCHOOL? Like damn I knew he liked studying but that's too much.
I can't wait for the new Spider-Man Movie!!! I hope it does involve the multiverse and bring both of the other Spider-Man into the movie.
How about the possibly sandman appearance in the teaser ?
at this point, if Tobey and Andrew aren't in the movie, i wont be mad, just disappointed.
Great Breakdown, You earned a SUB! I'm totally looking forward to this release and will be waiting with baited breath!
I think even Dr. Strange forgets who Spiderman is
I feel like we will see a hapoily married tobey mcguire spidey
OMG!!! PETER IS MEPHISTO!?!?!?!?
Omg I so can’t wait to see it and see what happens in the movie
Amazing first look in my opinion, super excited to see No Way Home
If Flash actually supports Peter that'd be a bit weird but I'll  still love it
sinister six!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don't just blame doc. Strange..... He definitely knows whats gonaa happen.... As he has see. The entire future
It's not murdock 🤣 it's just a cop with a tie🤣
Cool 😎 this a game ending 🤣
I really hope we see all the different Peters plus Miles 😭😂
I just hope this movie doesnt have the same issue as rami spiderman 3 where it's too crowded
Charlie Cox 🔥
I jus wanna see black and gold suit...
This might be the best MCU movie so far. Just thought
Be careful what you wish for! Wow
If everything goes well in December I'm pretty sure it's gonna make 2bil i just hope it's a 3hr movie
I think in the end this might make it to him fighting venom
Theaters? Nooo thanks Sony lol I'll wait to DL it in 4k
Green goblin ??? Yeah!!
The slamming paper guy Tooks abit to chubby to be daredevil 😂
Watch carefully when Doctor Octopus hits his tentacles on the groud the surface is different from when Spiderman suits up(from pattern tiles to concrete). There's no way those two are same scenes, possible hint for Toby?
What if devil in disguise is a hint at Dr Strange actually being Mephisto?
there wont be anymore tom holland spiderman? will there be a reboot?
The dude was the same guy with that blue jacket dude look at the tie
Sinister six SpiderTobey- greengoblin & doctor octopus SpiderAndrew-electro & lizard Spider-Tom-vulture & mysterio
What of loki comes
wonder if sandman is gonna be the same actor too
Unless Charlie Cox had a belly at the time of filming that definitely isn't him.
Hello Peter
The best trailer ever created😂
Kinda feel like he’s explaining things we can clearly see lol peter is laying down ,the sky is blue lol
I think Lazard was in this boy
So basically Peter being an idiot is what causes the multiverse to collide. Dude, what's the big deal? Just tell Ned and MJ all over again, but nooooo, you freak out and cause Strange to mess up the already complex spell with your teenage whining.
Fans: give us Tobey and Andrew Spider-Man  Marvel: you will get tobey and Andrew when you pay the god damm rent
What if Strange is a bad guy?   The wink is very “Agatha”. His hair looks different in certain scenes. Why does he still have the eye of agamoto on if there’s no time stone? Why call him Parker when he said their on a first name basis? Train scene outfit looks different. Aren’t we getting a different Dr. Strange in What if?
4:20 on the tv you can see betty has as side job as a reporter most likely for the bugle so if it is the bugle its a little reference i guess
Did anyone notice Wong was headed to fight Abomination? The portal showed a glimpse of the temples ⛩ from Shang Chi trailer!
Tony Stark will make a cameo, calling it
Fam mans doing bits with the views
I don't think it's Matt Murdock, that guy has a big belly like me.
where did the eye of agomoto come from?
So who is the 6  Ock Electro  Green goblin   ? ? ? Sandman  Mysterio Vulture ???
Amazing
Bruh
Dr. Strange is Mephisto... The Dr. Strange in the MCU would not be so genial with anyone.
Blu-ray?
The fact that Peter enters the circle before it been closed cause the multiverse to collapse around spiderman just like in into the spiderverse when the goblin put spiderman face in the collider
somethings off with Doc Strange... another doppelganger ? Dark Wizard?
Unless Charlie Cox has put on a significant amount of weight, I don't think it's Matt Murdoch. Guy in the clip has got a major dad bod.
Wahh  Mephisto HAHAHAH
13:25 can't stop laughing
Everyone: We want Tobey! Sony: I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.
This will be a part 1 to a 2 part story I bet.
I may be overthinking this but those trains that Strange multiplies look very similar to the trains that Tobey stops with his webs back in SM2, even the tracks look similar to me.  Either that or that’s just New York’s trains..
Love the 1st trailer. I think that the other Spiderman variants will be featured as well, considering that the rogue's gallery of the other movies will return. With Doc Octopus in the picture, there is a possibility of a Superior Spiderman future, where Doc controls Peter's body (however making him a millionaire like Stark).
Damn dude, you jumped.on this
If Disney really wanted to pull a surprise, in addition to Tobey Mcguire and Andrew Garfield, they'd bring in an appearance by Nicholas Hammond.
If the other two Spider-Men are included I'd like as a nod to Spider-verse they both by default go to aunt May's house.
What about S.H.I.E.L.D?
Dr. Strange is acting strangely.  I mean he is not so irresponsible.
This might be the best Marvel movie ever!
That HAS to be Matt Murdock because the actor has the same hairy arms
The trailer has been out for 3 hrs and you broke it down lol
why is strange still wearing the eye of agamoto????
bro... nice ass video, followed for sure homie.
Amazing trailer!!!!
Sony: Drops Trailer Heavy Spoilers: Breaks Down in 10 minutes. Me: What is this guy? How did he edit it so fast? How did he find everything out so fast? * millions of questions *
Flash is now Blonde, Sandman saved Peter from Electro, that’s what I found
ngl i’ve never heard Penn Station be referred to as “Pennsylvania Station” so that was an experience
3:40 was very funyny
I am so pumped for this movie! Wasn’t sure the beginning of phase 4 could live up to how phase 3 ended but I’m very excited!
Do y’all realize that Otto is the same Otto from tobys Spider-Man!! We may see them both together that hello Peter sounded very Toby maguireish
But Toby is confirmed  If you go to the trailer and pause at 2:27 you can see his black symbiot suit   Trust me
This trailer legit gave me goosebumps, I haven't legit been hyped for a movie like this in a while. This is gonna be a fun one one way or the other.
Dr. Strange is new mentor of spiderman
I’m so excited 😊
Your friend should shut the hell up.
This why i hate humans and these heroes shouldn't bother saving trash (humans)
This movie has Electro,Doc Oc and Green Goblin and we've seen only Doc and we're practically drooling😂😂😂, if we get Tobey and Andrew I don't know what'll happen 😅😅😅
Wandavision's ending says otherwise on her being a "villain"
The best storyline ever, cant wait to watch especially because of the villians have been my favourite.
So the trailer was leaked and now Sony/Marvel fully released it 😂 anyways I’m SO EXCITED
bro the police walk in on mj and peter dont u see him wearing his boxers while he is handcuffed
Can’t wait fo it !!!
Green Goblin is what got me
15:25 i bet 100 dollars that if they adapt that plotline in this movie, whack ass MCU Peter Parker is gonna wish to talk to "Senpai Stark" instead of uncle Ben
thanks for the video
I still hope Mephisto shows up.
I can't wait for the release, just hoping that the lockdown here settles down before the movie comes out though.
I cannot wait to see this movie 😭 So many people who grew up with Tobey’s spider man are gonna tear up when he shows up
I thought Dr. octopus is dead.. in Spiderman 2 ?  Bruh im so Confuse.. and the green thing the he was dead too.. Maybe that was Harry ? Maybe They were from the past ??
Can’t waitttt
He walks in the snow while going to the Sanctum (Dr Strange)
I love how they where calling him the devil because I was getting vibes from when he made a deal with mafisto 😭💀
Trailer look OK
This shit was made in one hour.  One hour.
I kinda doubt that Tobey and Andrew are  in the movie, I wouldn't get your hopes up guys just saying.
What if in one of those suits it is Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfiled
Hyped
Awesome breakdown and theories on the trailer this is a movie I cant wait to be released
I loved this, it wasn't to over the top but it was perfect. Plus, now I can act like a smart alec and tell my family everything that is going to happen before it happens. So, thank you for that little splinter of satisfaction;)
Just discovered the channel.  Love me some spoilers, but the humor got my subscription, you cheeky little shit
You’re a legend, this video was uploaded just right after the teaser was out!
One of the best videos ever. 💯  The details you've given, especially the lizar aspect is my favourite! ❤️
No way! No way! No way!!!
thought it was great!
Wait, DO we know that Charlie Cox’s gonna be in the movie? I didn’t see any source on this
Bully Maguire IS OFFICIALLY CANON
Regarding how Otto knows who Peter is in this universe: I'm guessing that when their worlds merged or whatever they (Gobby and Ock) figured what was going on with the multiverse because I mean Norman and Otto are fuckin genius'! Idk we'll see wtf is going on when it comes out lol theres a lot of shit happening in this movie. If they pull this shit off, man... That's what life is about lol like this is what I existed for, to experience all this awesomeness
Hello
The part with peter and aunt may, thats the cops that come in, you see the car lights outside the windows.
At 13:27 I felt that 😣
This will be the best MULTIVERSE...🥰🥰
Where is the Spidey supreme..
im so exciteddddddd
I’m so excited for this
this is gonna be epic
I'm so excited for this!!! I can't wait to see more mj and peter!!
I just hope they don't erase his relationship with MJ after the time far from home spent building it. Loved the trailer and amazing breakdown!
Needs venom to show up
i heard william dafoes laugh
Oh my god, I was screaming when Doc Oc came on 😱😱 December can’t come fast enough!
I feel like this is just marvel&sony way to seperate Spidey from mcu. My theory is by the end of the film strange gonna put peter on different/alternate universe where avangers doesnt exist and no one know peter is spiderman. Turn out that universe is venom universe.
I'm seriously convinced someone at Marvel is watching these breakdowns and specifically adding in the Mephisto random Easter eggs 😂 this is the way
When was Charlie Cox confrimed?
spider 🕷 🕸 Man No Way Home is going to be great, all 3 spider Man will be in this one, and Electro, Sandman, Doc Oc, Green Golden...
Someone was super right ❤️🔥
13:28 you wild
If it weren't for covid we could already be watching Spiderman No way Home in the theaters :((((
Marvel's new superhero Spoiler Man! 🤮 👈logo  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Awesome breakdown. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm very excited for this movie. Just a couple of things: 1. When the guy slams the files onto the table in front of Peter you can clearly see that he has a belly/gut. So, that cannot possibly be Matt Murdock. Although I do believe Matt will be in this movie, and from the looks of things Peter's def gonna need a lawyer. Maybe this is when they'll introduce/tease She-Hulk. Who knows? 2. When MJ and Peter are laying in bed and look like they're "reading" what's on their phones, I think they're actually on V.C. with each other.  Thank you.
I think it would be stupid but hilariously well deserved fan-service if Bully Maguire made a cameo.
I'm so hyped about the "Spider-Man Home" trilogy
I can't wait Like if you can't wait
Props to you for breaking this down so fast!! Can’t wait!! 😬
The guy you said is matt murdock has a tummy. So no
cant wait for this movie!... finally the trailer dropped! 😄
Why does Dr Strange still wear the Eye of Agamoto when the time stone is gone?
Yall forget matt murdock is blind or atleast pretends to be so i dont think thats matt
u should be hyped for the flash 2022
I have a feeling the snow scene when he goes to mj is after Strange erases everyone's mind of him being Spiderman so mj won't even remember them dating. So it'll be one of those "Hey it's me " "I don't even know who you are" scenes
Nothing about Tobey McGuire at the end on the car vs doc oc? Oof
If the villains from the other movies could be shown, why wouldn’t the other spiders be here as well? 🤔
Any chance there might be a Tom Hardy Venom special appearance at the end to hop on the new Venom: Let There Be Carnage, gravy train? I mean Sony is throwing their whole ensemble of Spiderman universe villains here, why not tease Spiderman's greatest archenemy?
Crazzzzyyyy
Thank you to the person who leaked that cell phone recording of this trailer because this is the only reason why Disney finally released this trailer now…because the trailer already leaked
Where s nick fury ..?
I am so hype about this movie, and all that's potentially involved with it! YA HEAR THAT, TOBEY AND ANDREW?????🤣🤣🤣
"That 'rent free like Peter Parker' joke, yeah? That deserves a thumbs-up at the very least and you know it does" Damn right I do...
Yes Lord heavy Spoilers l will give you. Your rent ☺️☺️ but first give us more Spoilers they were spot on
It makes you wonder what peter was  otto talking about...🤔🤔🤔🤔
If tobey is in I won't get mad in fact I would like to see different versions of Spider-Man interact
I don't think this will happen but still putting it out here:  In the end credits, Deadpool is seen getting into the MCU and then joking that he ain't even a SpiderMan villain...
I normally try to avoid trailers because most trailers for films now give you a lot of the film with many spoilers, granted trailers have always shown what's in a film but I'm seeing more and more important moments in trailers now than before. Idk. But this trailer? Theres no way I couldve avoided it. The hype is real. I want Tobey lol
I really hope there is more to this story line than what's being presented here. LOL this is absurdly irresponsible on the part of Dr. Strange. He split time open, because Pete asked him to....over paparazzi. LOL
Super breakdown
Sup I’m here for da box
It took ya’ll 15 minutes to make an 18 min video 😭 insanely impressive
You did a goof. That iron spider in the trailer is the exact same as infinity war and endgame.  Not the new one
Im so STOKED
This. Is. Freaking. Awesome
"What if" the judge from the Loki series is a teacher at Peter Parker's school?
Good luck chasing spider-man 😂
The guy with the white shirt wasn't wearing any shades
Wow... this looks amazing! Thanks for the comic breakdown also!
I don't know why Dr. Strange in the casual clothes looks like they just CG'd his head on there. Like Bruce on the hulk buster.
This movie got me hypedddd
I hope its the raimi universe doc ock and not just one who looks like him. If it is i wonder how he survived?
So tobey going to make a cameo…🙂
Watch newspaper MJ was reading in the trailer  there you can see both Spiderman
If that’s Matt he’s let himself go
I don't think that guy is Matt, as we see in previous shot he's not walking with a cane/stick. A blind guy can't walk that fast....
I found out that the attorney is NOT Matt Murdock. Its Marvin E. West and he's the attorney, but uncredited.
umm, kids hang up colored lights in their rooms all the time...not just Christmas.
Honestly on the mirror part it looks like the symbiote
If that moment is Docs first arrival how would he know that Tom Holland's version is peter Parker?...what if he said Hello peter to Tobey's Spider-Man
This guy might be thinking this while uploading this-     I AM SPEEEEDDD😂😂🤣🤣
On 2:26 of the trailer he turns to something what is it. Anyone?
4:47 imagine it’s Uncle Ben 👀
Charlie Cox would make so much sense.
so stoked to finally get a tom holland spiderman film in yew york
You have no idea how much I am excited for this movie!!! I really hope Mysterio ends up being alive at the end of this film and spidermans Innocence proved. There are so many ways this could end up.... Where do you buy the boxsets from and how much?
Idc if this is a spoiler im a spider fan
Charlie Cox isn't confirmed to be in this lmao get your shit right
Could it be that Strange casting the spell is the threshold that got crossed as per Qeng rather than Wanda casting Runes???
anyone else see that one tiktok guy lol
I have to stop at 2:58 to comment that I don't believe it's Matt Murdock. The guy got some love handles. But uhmmm, I'll shut up now.  *Resume watching*
You made the video in 1 hour?
That was fast
Did Murdock grow fat? :3
The guy with blonde hair looks nothing like MCU flash lol wtf
I think aunt may gonna die
trailer is good now i want the box
sorry but i think it's not Matt Murdock look at the stomach.
SO DAMN HYPED
Lol that guys too fat to be Charlie Cox
Tony gonna cameo at the end with that dr strange gift thing
I bet Ned becomes a jock after "forgetting" spider man and that's why the actor lots weight and the funko pop bomber jacket
Definitely going to watch this movie on shrooms
That MCU box set is mine
Can't tell if it's Strange or Harry when he we hear " Be careful what you wish for "
7:52 and.. he got time stone back after cap return to it's place? That thing is powerful..
When Dr Strange is casting his spell the way that the spell connects and shows a solid too line and the other two below it being imbalanced. Looks like a literal representation of the sacred timeline and multiverse. Just as Kang showed in Loki
Tobey gonna come outa nowhere and say “hey everyone”
Charlie cox is shredded - the guy from the interrogation shot has love handles and a gut…
What a boring breakdown
It is NOT Matt Murdock!! When was the last time you saw Dare Devil with love handles aka lower back fat and a beer belly. Look at him. Two more donuts and he becomes homer fat.
so there won't be tobey's and andrew's spiderman.
Just want Tobey's and Andrew's spidermans in this movie and it would be the best thing in the world💯💯
thank you!!!
Love the first trailer. Really hoping the other Spider-Man show up
I bet it’s cold in the Sanctorum just so Strange can have a cup of hot cocoa the way it’s meant to be enjoyed. It’s definitely that way on purpose and for a silly reason.
Wait so if they go back in time will Peter see iron man
BUT IS IT A PART 1?
I don't think they will show us Matt Murdock, Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield in the trailers. They'll leave them as a big reveal.
Just to throw it out there, that was 1000% William Dafoe's, Green Goblin laugh when the Pumpkin Bomb blows! It's an unforgettable laugh!
Nice to see old foes but the plot seems a bit over the top - too much magic and too little homegrown problems
So no one gonna talk about them captions when Osborn is going up the elevator 😭
Wait, wasn't Doc Oc change his way at the end of Spiderman 2? How come he's a bad guy again now?
Charlie Cox was spotted on set, as you well know.  I think we may see Matt Murdock at some point at the police station, but the guy at 2:41 is not him: 1. Matt Murdock would be wearing a suit jacket, not with jacket off and cuffs rolled up. 2. The guy either doesn't have his shirt tucked in, or he has a gut. 3. Doesn't make sense why a blind man (or pretending to be blind) would pick up and slam down a stack of papers with both hands like that. 4. Beforehand, at 2:23, you see the same guy walk quickly into the room.  He's walking with arms crossed (no walking stick), no silhouette of glasses, walking too fast for a blind person, and has a gut.  His gut is literally hanging over his belt buckle.
the pile of sand protected tobey from the lightning if you look closer
Is it just me, or Sony's walking the same way? The third film and the third time Peter messes up, is sorry about that and tries to fix it. I like Marvel, I am Marvel fan, but this... makes me feel a bit disappointed. Hope it's just a teaser compilation. P.S. Trailer is awesome.
It is exactly as you described in previous video. . .
What if Uncle Ben is in this? What if it’s Hugh Jackman????
Peter parker always mess things up n creating another consequences over n over again... Still amateur on handling the situations everytime...
let's fucking gooo!!!!
So heros are now creating their own villains after Thanos 😄
Perhaps that Dr. Strange is Mephisto in disguise?! I can not wait to see Madame Web...who I hope is played by Jodi Foster!!!
Mephisto has to be pissed that he is getting no love in these flicks. Super pissed.😒
i feel like strange is acting off character a bit
Is the other villain scorpion or the lizard cause it looks like both.
Excellent video!
$10 says this movie introduces the x-men
That's 100% not Matt Murdock. Not unless Charlie Cox put on like 60 pounds of fat.
What if Uncle Ben is in this? And what if it’s Hugh Jackman
Why is doctor strange's personality so changed
I guarantee the next trailer that will probably be dropped in October or November is gonna confirm Tobey and Andrew returning
I’m just so freaking happy.
Wait, you forgot to add "again, like poetry, they rhyme"
Does anyone think Toby or Andrew will be in this movie I still have a lil hope
With rumors for Willem, Foxx, Garfield and Toby... gives me hope that we might see the Defenders actors and Agents of Shield cast return I'm future projects.
It would be cool if there's a shot with the poster saying Peter is Devil in Disguise and Murdock is looking at it
this will literally be the best spiderman movie ever
>sees guy with a tie and white shirt “DAREDEVIL IS IN THE MOVIE HOLY SHIT”  talk about a reach
How would it be if THIS was actually Holland's last performance as Spider-Man?  As in his Peter Parker dies in the end. And nobody leaked it. Minds will be blown up in the theaters. Tears everywhere.  And a new Spider-Man is introduced.
Couldn't Peter just get home school or something. Also ironically the plan was for the first film to have Peter unmask himself. The one thing that stands out to me is that Man's parents don't want Peter near as a black woman is seen talking to him in the limo is likely  Mjs mother or it's flash's since flash has taken over the rich jerk that Harry had pegged.
At 12:33 you can clearly see the black and yellow electric Spidey suit...
I don't think Doc Oc is talking to Tom Hollands spiderman when he says "Hello Peter" 😉
Great video
HYYYPPPPEDDD!!! SOO HYPED!!!
No Mephisto? 😤
I got goosebumps when i saw the goblin bomb and Doc Oc! But when you said the details about possibily Sandman, Electro, and the Lizard i got even more excited!
“you’ll get your rent when you fix this damn door” 🕷
what is peter trying to steal from dr. strange? stephen looks mad
Yo
02:44 and I’m 99% sure its not matt murdock, look closely at his stomach he’s fat!!
I feel like this will start the multiverse but I’m just too hype for the villains it’s like nostalgia
I really do wanna see flash's reaction to Parker being spiderman lol
I am so excited!!!!!!!
just wanted to tell you that your timeline is a bit messed up.
What if tobey maguire is uncle ben????
Who says Doc Ock is talking to Tom Hollands Spiderman? Maybe he's talking to Tobeys spiderman
Maybe this is when Wanda heard her sons. To me it seems more practical.
It blew my mind completely. I can't believe all the reminiscence it will bring to the other spider-man movies. It will probably be one of my favorites.
you are talking about mcu but being flash.....
Omg your not noticing the sand! THERES SANDMAN OMH
Love the throwback Spider-Man theme song. I think that was Tobi in the background warning Peter at the end…
The guy in the white shirt has a belly as big as mine so that’s definitely not Matt Murdock.
The breakdown was fantastic
I feel the green goblin sounds like willem dafoe from spider man 1 Tobey films. Anyone else think that?
When you saved the world from a mad titan yet people still diss you for being Spiderman. Superhero world is wild.
So basically, peter parker and doctor strange too messed up the Multiverse instead of aftermath of loki consequences we all theorized about.
Holy f’innng wow !!!! Now that’s an amazing teaser trailer. This is gonna be a huge movie
Charlie Cox isn’t that pudgy, it’s not him. But I can’t wait to see him!
For a brief moment in the trailer in what looked like a cafeteria spiderman appeared to be wearing the venom suit from spiderman 3
Either this movie or the second dr strange will enforce the living tribunal we already know he’s in it because of the statue in Loki and if there’s three spider men then that would disrupt the balance in the universe and if Shuma gorath appears that would break balance and he’d maybe need to step in
02:43 IRONMAN on the COFFEE MUG!
Basically My theory is There will be 4 spiderman Tom Holland Andrew  Tobey And Miles
Everyone talking about Maguire and Garfield and I'm just sitting here waiting for three Bruce Campbells to show up.
Dr strange kinda sus
Fruit cake
too many villains like spider-man 3
Finally I never thought I’ll get to see my favorite characters and Spider-Man back even in my wildest dream and as their respective versions
Wanda broke reality D.strange also broke it kind off Loki also broke antire reality (at the end ) hmmm
Why am i getting a feeling that Doc Ock isn't gonna be a villain. Well he saves Pete at the end of Spiderman 2. Maybe he'll help in fighting off Goblin & Electro.
So you have a spell to change time but don't have a spell to fix a whole?
tobey and andre garfield please
what about the remainders of the avengers? would they forget him aswell?
They should just leave it at this. No more trailers. The fans were already going to see it. The casuals now have something to get them pumped. They’ve hardly spoiled the story or reveals…
Looks like the cops are the ones that walk in on Peter and Aunt May
I pray the MCU can do this better than the last 2 spider man series. Multiple villains is what killed both of those series. Toby mcguire’s third and Andrew garfield’s second were awful. I’m also not excited about Jamie Foxx returning, he was a terrible villain. Other than that hyped af about this movie
I don't know about Matt Murdock tho, I think it may be Foggy. Matt usually uses his cane and when he enters the room his arms are just crossed. So I'm not sure about that.
HYPE!!! Defintely gonna watch in IMAX!!!
Hello Peter
Hello, Peter... *just sent chills down my spine* December can't come soon enough!
Spider-Man homecoming :) Spider man far from home :/  Spider-Man no way home :(  Get it ?
Hope it does hit 2 billion
Oh my gawd....  😭 spidey villains coming back
i did NOT see 13:25 coming 🤣🤣  noice
Life saver
I really hate the one more day and brand new day story line.
Maybe Peter Parker's nexus event was paying rent
is it weird that I was more excited for the trailer then the actual movie
At 12:34 you can easily see Peter's gold and black suit in the right corner
One of Mysterio's biggest stories in the Ultimate comics was 616 controlling the Ultimate Mysterio. Makes most sense to have something similar to introduce the Multiverse Sinister six
Matt got a little chunky and Ned lost some weight. (Still don't think it is Murdoch.) Even Doc Ock looks thinner. Why are they only cancelling the fat guys?
I know there is probably an obvious answer to this question but should I watch this? I don’t want to have the whole movie spoiled for me but I REALLY want to watch this. 🥲
Love the Eastenders pic
Butterfingers
I have no words the trailer was everything I hoped for AMAZING so excited !
This is crazzyyy. I just can't wait for December!
Is those trains the same train in raimi Spider-Man 2?
J. Jonah Jameson is back!
Why they changed the haircut
I think that's Peter in his black suit at 12:33 on the bottom right
Ned is goblin that’s why he is barely in the trailer
Spider-Man & Doctor strange ! That is just 🥶🥶😤😤! The multiverse is going to get more explored! Dr. Octopus and The green goblin on set! I think we all know Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield’s hv got to show up!!!!
Watched this 5 minutes before the Reel Rejects reaction video.
Hey, huge thanks for making this video, I've been a pretty big movie spiderman fan for a while now, and your video definitely helped me feeling hype for the next one. So to that, Thank You
3:00 of course that's not him. Look at the belly
The people who leaked the official trailer and forced marvel to release it deserve noble prize 😝😝
How are you so fast ?! 💜
The true spiderman Tobey why  He start the Spider-Man’s evolution and has the powers and not taking suits help says epic lines like Ima put some dirt in your eye FIX THE DAMM DOOR  and new spiderman scared of everything
Just imagine if i actually got a box set
The return of “Mephisto confirmed” sound effect! 🤣 glorious 🔥
The fact that they teased Green Goblin and Doc Oct from the first Spiderman Movies just makes my neck hair raise! Kudos to you brother for making this superb breakdown of the trailer. More power!
It looks very exciting!
Sandman and the lizard were the two biggest kept secrets, this is basically sinister six
The whole video I realized u a clickbaiter full of lies so Ima flagged u the trailer is real doe
Doctor Strange/Madam Web?
IT'S ABOUT EFFING TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where is the subtitles?
Ned is gonna be the villain for the 4th spider-man movie.
Wait, what if Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) from Amazing Spider-Man became Spider Gwen from another spiderverse!? That would be crazy!
That tie guy has a gut.... not Charlie
The fastest breakdown in the west
13:27
Whole movie is not true only strange showing to peter what will happen.
That's not Charlie Cox, if it's looks like he  gained some weight.
Squee  That is all  Squee
10:30 Actually, this comes from Doctor Strange movie (2016) ...
Honestly I don't want to see Sandman I want it to be like this Green Goblin Dock Ock Lizard Electro Vulture Scorpion And if it's not like that I will extremely disappointed
So Peter wearing his Jordan’s like Miles
This may just break Endgame  for real
Didnt doc ox and green gonlin both die tho. Makes no sense
Did kang see this already and its part of the plan? Or is this after the threshold is crossed?
Two hundred and eighteen idgits want to fight you.
You’re British… but you say “Peter” like an American
Heavy spoilers? More like heavy ads, amirite?
Really looking forward to this.
The shot before where Peter's been handcuffed, shows a silhouette of  someone resembling Matt Murdock.
Thanks for the breakdown!
So hyped
Am I still remembered
Guy slamming down papers CANNOT be Matt Murdock because he has love handles. Charlie Cox has at most 9% Body Fat. It might be Foggy Nelson though.
Bro. Charlie Cox is in shape, that person has a nice, round spare tire.
Tobey's Spiderman trilogy is the best
So keen
Goblin : "You and I are not so different" Peter : Wait, You got to high school?
Man I love me some fan service
If at all the multiverse happens for real and different versions of spiderman show up the theaters are gonna go over the roof and the people will be blown away
You rock bro
At 4:44 you can see the police lights in the background. Probably him getting arrested/turning himself in.
Did anyone notice this but Peter and Aunt May were watching the Daily Bugle news on tv when someone came from the door
I absolutely think when Green goblin and Doc ock come out, its against Tobey mcguire
My theory is that Stranges spell takes place at the same time as the Loki multiverse split, because Strange has to be distracted by something other than a talking teenager
Damn, all the Tobey stans really going apeshit without him in the trailer.
Mephisto approved.
The way Doc said "Hello Peter"  It seemed as if he is as thrilled as we are.
Can't wait for this epic new Spiderman movie!
Is he gonna die you said his endgame
That “hello, Peter” was definitely directing it towards Tobey’s Peter
Is TVA in disarray in the background and completely ignoring the variants? Or is it Endgame's "it was all meant to happen" BS all over again
Maybe doctor octopus was saying "hello Peter" to tobey's spiderman 🤔
That would be a heavier Daredevil
Why would you put that as the thumbnail!? Knowing people will search the trailer and see this ?
I think that black suit belongs to miles.... He tells miles to stop being spiderman at first then he thinks it's better... It makes sense since   tom hasn't made a new contract for spiderman movies...... And tobey and Andrew will not be here yet but Dr strange will bring after misfiring of spell...... Miles, tom, Andrew, Dr strange, tobey and daredevil (Charlie Cox)  vs sinister six.... Who knows maybe mephisto will play a crucial role.....
The One more Day storyline is stupid and it would’ve made more sense if MJ was shot instead of May.
When Strange pushes out Peter’s astral form, the magic box is in his hand.
I think Ik all the sinister six that will be here. Mostly likely 2 villains from each spiderman.  So doc ock and green goblin for Tobey. Electro and one more for Andrew. Scorpion and mostly likely hopefully vulture returning for Tom Holland.
and flash just turned white ? don't think that this is flash Thompson..
Is that the lizard or venom???
Are you aware of the inappropriate snippet used at 13:27? SMH
You are the fastest man in the world 💯
As much I hate to say it, the guy slamming the papers isn’t Matt. When slowing down the trailer, you could easily see him with the detective entering the room with no stick. And while yes Daredevil could do this easily, Matt can’t really do this without causing suspicion to himself in front of people.
Do we also hear the sound effect gliche, from SM: In the Spiderverse??
the part about the gift that brings back ben is interesting, but i feel like they might do tony for that scene if they recreate it because of how they’ve emphasized their connection in the disney series
If notice him walking down street in leaked footage is same outfit he ware while walking into DR Strange mansion & same jacket he’s wearing looking while he’s looking up at small witch lights(Black cats on wall behind him too).  Maybe it’s around Halloween time, figure it snows during October in New York? Lol just my guess. I’m from Texas so barely get snow here
spoiler: uncle ben dies
❤
Thats not matt murdock, the guy looks a little bit fat. I know matt murdock is fit
The laugh made me INSTANTLY think of Willem Dafoe, super excited at the possibility of the full Sinister Six
I've waited so long for this and I'm happy it didn't give away too much but gave us enough to speculate even more
I literally dreamt about the trailer being released last nigh tell me this isn't a coincidence
PLEASE TELL ME ANDREW GARFIELDS SPIDERMAN GONNA BE HERE
Lmfao nice reference. 4:22.
maybe doctor strange is mephisto in spiderman no way home
The colored lines with the rainbow effect could be a hint to the Spider Men appearing cause the lines reminded me of how the Spider Men in ”Into the Spiderverse” appeared in Miles’s universe. Or the fucking bifrost might make an appearance. Who knows?
It was worth the wait after all ✌
I hope the green goblin doesn’t wear metal mask, but a high tech mask that make the face look like a goblin.
I still feel One More Day ruined Spiderman and never let him grow as a character.
How long do Y'all think this movie is going to be?
i never skipped any spiderman movie in cinema since tasm, im hype for the new movie !
If u see the spell when dr strange casted it the effects are same when dc. octo died with the reactor in the ocean
So stoked for this movie!!
Did you see Cap.America, photo in the Midtown H.S wall, again?
nope, that belly fat is not the daredevil for sure...
Thanos was the anti Christ villain lead by Satan's influence so yes Mephisto has already been in MCU.
Im just glad doctor strange is in nwy because that means nothing bad happens to him in doctor strange 2
Doctor Octopus: "Hello Peter"  Peter transforms into spiderman Doctor Octopus:"That was not for you boy!"
Don't mind me just making a comment I'll come back to when spiderman 4 is out..
thanks for the video my friend
fast as fucik booiii
The thumbnail could change, sad that I saw it before seeing trailer and my surprise for Doc Ock is gone now. I wish other ppl see this thumbnail after the trailer.
The Lizard is from The Amazing Spider-Man 1 not The Amazing Spider-Man 2
Spider-Man 4: Home, Superior Home?
Hasn't Peter learned anything about trusting villains?
letssss gooooo
Matt Murdock doesn't have belly fat😛
12:17 in honor of chadwick :)
The 1st Look is everything I could have asked for in a teaser
When Peter called out to Strange, the latter should've said.  "That feels STRANGE but I'll allow it"   read this somewhere.
how the hell dr strange is still wearing eye of agamoto. there arent supposed to be any infinity stones right?/////
My theory with why New York Sanctum is snowing is that because that's how they "decorate" it during Christmas
Just before the pumpkin bomb lands you can clearly hear Willem Dafoes cackle laugh.
Easter Egg/Nod. BlackCat sitting right behind PP, in the Trailer
"Hello Peter" Then show a picture of Rocket-man
Mephisto confirmed!
I like how they said "stop talking"
Feel funny when some people think Peter and Dr Strange messing the Multiverse after watching the Spider-Man: No Way Home First Teaser Trailer. Because of their excitement, they forgot that Loki Season 1 episode 6 have changed the Marvel Cinematic universe path; Avengers Endgame (Captain America's Shield), WandaVision (entering a threshold), Spider-Man: Far From Home (The existence of J Jonah Jameson in a news portal).  Sylvie (Loki Variant) kills He Who Remains (Kang Variants) and her action have lead into the breaking of the sacred timeline and free the Multiverse flow and merge with the sacred timeline (Current MCU Timeline). This event have answering the existence of how J. Jonah Jameson (from Spider-Man Raimiverse) appear in Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) in a logical way; He is a Variant.  Doctor Strange and Peter Parker is not the one who messing the timeline. Why? Doctor Strange once said to Tony Stark/Iron Man "Protecting your reality, douche bags!" back in Avengers: Infinity War (2018).   How come an Earth's Sorcerer Supreme wanna messing up with a timeline when he HAVE MAKE AN OATH to Protect the Reality (Sacred Timeline)? what does it owe to him? LoL...
How does strange have the eye of agamoto?
Completely forgot about Jacob Batalons weight loss, it’s gonna be weird seeing it on the big screen, but really proud of him! Wonder if he’ll be forced to distance himself from Peter now that he’s been exposed?
Hyped nothing more
this is story telling not a breakdown... dumb ***
My Hail Mary prediction is that Tom Hardy will be in the post credit scene and Tom’s Spider-Man will be recruited to help him fight Carnage! No way Carnage is 1 and done!
im not really concerned about peter tampering with the multiverse since strange's role this time is to fix everything that might be a potential harm to the timeline that's why he's babysitting wanda lmao. nonetheless im excited to see more magic now on MCU.
Very well thought out. Great job!
You are so quick it’s unreal! Thank you! And you were right so no clown makeup for you 🤡
You were a little to accurate…
Okay but.. why the fuck would the Sorcerer Supreme .. do something this stupid?
My theory is that I don’t think Peter ruined the spell. I think it was interfered by the death of Kang in the Loki finale
Strange: the entire world is about to forget that peter parker is spider man  1. Ock- still knows "peter" 2. Goblin(?)- be careful what you wish for parker  So maybe this world forgot about (Tom) parker, or parker jumped into a different universe or they're mentioning a different "peter parker".
Yo Charlie boy from tik tok is on the left at 4:28
What if spider vs Dr strange ( thought from the train scene )
Spiderman : No way we finally got the trailer at home
I just realize that they connect Dc.Oct from original Spider-Man movie that he survives and have travel to Spider-Man No way home.
Dude..but that can't be Matt...Matt ain't got no belly fat and love handles...
nice trailer
I did notice when May & Peter are sitting in the living room & it looks like someone's walking in it seemed like they're are cops flashing outside/off picture frames, but maybe they're protecting then rather than walking in to take him in?
Wait...what if Dr. Strange *IS* Mephist - *gets shot in the foot* owwww.
I think the black with white stripes flannel that Peter wears is sorta a shout out to the black suit from Spider-Man 3
I used to think there was no way marvel could top endgame… I was wrong! 😭
I just cant believe I was right about the trailer dropping in August and the fact that while everyone was hype about Andrew & toby possibly being in this movie I was thinking what if miles Morales would be in this movie too!! 🤯
I'm so excited for the new movie to come out. Ive been watching spiderman movies since I was young and I'm so happy that OG doc Oct is back!
1:11 i notice flash has blonde hair 😭😭💯 that’s great
You knew this was coming from the basement dwellers. Take a 2 minute clip and make into a 18 minute breakdown of what 'they' is going to happen. Mom...cut the crust off that PB&J. Baby going to be on the net for awhile.
JJ is eternal he's like the number one nemesis of every spidey lol
"Be careful what you wish for" sounded a lot like Curt Connors from the raimi trilogy
the camera man has soom footage that peter didnt kill mysterio
So 616-Strange checked the multi-verse for someone to help, but never checked the MCU. Tsk, rookie Sorcerer Supreme mistake.
Dude the train scene , i believed that was actually tobey maguire spiderman. edited to be tom holland spiderman. i believe Dr Strange tried to contact Tobey during the train scene remember? It also the exact train with Tobey's spiderman movie
Theory. Dr. Strange messed up because of what happened in endgame and he’s not in his usual self (he’s sweatpants and all) that’s why he appears to be not the usual Dr. Strange when Wong talks to him about not doing the spell. Then they fix it in dr strange 2
what will doctor strange do that thing to batman? who will come out batman or bruce wayne?
Dr. Strange agreeing to do the spell is very sus... I smell shenanigans in there somewhere... it maybe not him at all.
Im sorry but Am i the only one who thinks mcu spiderman is annoying????
That Dr Strange is a Skrull. Casting universe altering spells all willy nilly, letting simple speech distract him… YeAh OkAy! That was amateur hour! The Sorcerer Supreme is gonna have some ish to fix!
Official Trailer - released 2 hours ago. Heavy Spoilers - made an analysis and uploaded the video 2 fucking hours ago.  Listen Barry, if you fuck up this timeline as well as you did the other one 10 years ago....
Jamie fox better have a different suit
Finally Paul, we got Mephisto. We'll done sir, we'll done
Something about the Train scene and the scene where Dr.Stranfe astral projects Peter makes me think they are fake scenes. Marvel has done em before and something about these just makes me think they're fake
so we aint gonna talk about the caption and the face- nevermind
There’s apparently A LOT of rumors flying around that Michael J Fox is cast as Uncle Ben. If there’s any truth to that, I haven’t the slightest clue, but that sounds like it’d be cool
Im worried...one more day is with Sins of past the worst spider man story.
Bro just one hour after trailer released this dude breaked it down edited the video made the thumbnail and all that stuff....  Hats off🙌
Doctor Octopus is going to tell Peter that the alternate Peter is a bad guy
Cool video. I haven't read the comic books. But I was telling my stepdad about all the leaks and he like, well WHICH comic are they pulling from for the toys or this movie???  All of them sparky.
You got to work behind the scenes or working behind them or your editing is crazy fast wtf 😂😂😂
Everyone: WE WANT TOBEY!  Sony: You will get TOBEY when you FIX THIS A DAMN DOOR…
spibeber man
When dr. Strange casting the forgetting spell, purple light can be seen in the background, similar we saw in Loki series. I think strange casts the spell at the same moment when Kang dies, that's how multiverse opens.🤔🤔🤔
I think the peter is going to his school at 3:36
Really hope it wasn’t just Peter interrupting the spell that caused the break in the multiverse. Why wouldn’t Dr. Strange tell him that he can’t interrupt beforehand?
I think that the sinister 6 will return with Sandman, doc oc, electro, green goblin, and rhino but without mysterio and vulture since they are dead
No morbius???!!!!
If it is matt Murdock I would love that
yeah when i saw the ending i was hooked. spider man has been my hero since a kid so finally being an adult and being able to be caught of and seeing my child hood coming back is a must watch in theaters!
I'm guessing Dr. Strange has this all thought out before doing the spell. Just like what he did in End Game.
If you pause at the colored lens flares it looks like other scenes from the other Spider-Man movies
Heavy Spoilers after making 18 minute video with light editing and voice over and uploading after 1 hour after release of trailer:  I AM SPEED
Here comes the mephisto train toooot toooooot alllllll aboard
Who else lost it when ya heard the goblins laugh and the pumpkin bomb being thrown
It looks absolutely awesome I'm psyched
Well "what if" " that's not Dr.Strange " ? Lol
Aaaaaaaahhhhh
Lol...its not charlie coxx...look at the tummy 😂😂😭
I didn't expect alfred molina oh god,its just give me nostalgia
Paul: Welcome to the Heavy Spoilers call, I’m your host Paul. Greg: -Y-yes I know who you are Paul. Lol loved you in that intro 🤣
I knew it was the lizard, I think electro raided raven Croft and used connors
how the... how are you so fast
The problem with putting other big marvel superheroes in other hero’s movies (just in my opinion) is that they end up doing things that are unusual for the character. Stranger was willing to let Peter and Tony die to protect the stone. Now he’s changing reality for a identity. I get it’s supposed to lead up to doctor strange’s movie but still, I’m confused.
i love it so much
I'm getting Civil War trailer vibes. Where they edit out surprise characters for the trailer. A few shots look oddly wide considering the focus, like Peter in the Iron Spider suit standing in the wreckage of the cars. Toward the end of the trailer it feels like it could be one of those "Heroes lining up before a charge" type shots. The shot is so wide it feels like there could be another spidey on each side.........But then again I just desperately want all 3 of them in the movie so. 😂 Just wild speculation.
The news article on Peter using spider powers to hypnotize women is also a reference to spiderwoman's ability to hypnotize men
*The moment with Strange and Peter breaking the multiverse could be line up to the Loki scene and the Wandavision scene?*
I think we're going to get the quantum leap version of Spider-Man. It's called No Way Home, in one of the scenes, he's wearing an all-black Spider-Suit. Maybe, he's trying to correct timelines thrown off by the spell. Eventually, I think everyone gets the fanboy theory of Tobey & Andrew showing up in the film but I also think they'll introduce Miles Morales into the movie. I do think that Peter will be the Tony Stark of this Phase Four ofthe Marvel films and will die. They you can do a live-action franchise with Miles Morales in Phase Five.
When did Sony say Charlie cox was in the movie?!?
Spiderman No way, Homes! The Beauty here is that it's Sony and you can ignore the 10 year Marvel long con.
hi your vids are so good
SPIDER VERSE!!
Theater audiences are going to lose their shit when Andrew, Toby and Tom are together.
A Lego set was just announced that showed Vulture with some new and improved wings
I am very hyped for this movie more than giving Mr. Ditkovich his rent
Hello Peter Parker! 😈
Pumped
It’s only the teaser trailer dude
Man, you know I love you. I've been a long time subscriber but I have to tell you: 'ruined' is two syllables my friend
No one's gonna say how out of character Dr. Strange is acting?  I really hope that's some one impersonating him. Cause if the script says he's being that irresponsible, that's bad writing. Not true to the character.
The fact that the six is probably just version breaking out from stranges prison kinda dissatisfies me because it makes it less likely to see other versions of Spiderman running around of course it's just a teaser but still.
everytime i look for your breakdowns, your mafisto joke reminds me why i unsubbed. 4:57 and now have to look for anohter channel to break this down,  you jus had to ruin it fam, wet guy
This good finally the trailer came
Marvel fans: GIVE US THE FIRST TRAILER Sony/Marvel: Ok fine *see trailer* Marvel fans: GIVE US THE NEXT TRAILER
we want tobey
I think Tobey and Andrew will be in the next part..... No way Home would end with Peter being trapped (Linke how Infinity war ended).... and in the next part .... comes the other two Spiderman......
Tobey and Andrew will be the big surprise for this movie like with everyone coming back in endgame. We knew they were coming back but it was when they did that surprised us and got the reaction. That is why I think that they will never show andrew or Tobey in the trailer and spoil it.
Waiting  for robocop  to be revealed .....
Keep up the great work. I always look forward to ur vids Elon Musk
Why didn't Edith record everything that took place in order to clear peters case
It's NOT Matt Murdock. Just look at his love handles. Duh
Brutal
bro this is just insane........... the fact that we were speculating all this and its happening
Im shocked they fianlly gave us a trailer at all for no way home kievn said they weren't releasing a trailer at all to keep us wanting to see it
I can't wait for Bully Maguire
I can not express how excited I am after watching that trailer.
This will be AMAZING ;)
The M on the letterman jackets stands for Mephisto it’s confirmed lol
I appreciate the breakdown bro! Great job!👏🏿👏🏿👍🏿
Gutted this won't be in IMAX 3D
Sony- doesn’t show Toby in the trailer  Me-You want forgiveness? Get religion…
When the sand rises and the lightening strikes right infront is spiderman in the black suit
Omg that was in the same hour as the trailer how did he do that think of all the theories and edit that whole 18 minute video this doesn’t all add up unless somehow he gets trailers before everyone else but idk
It wasn't Matt Murdok in the interrogation room because the previous shot shows that man walking into the room together with the detective without the walking stick for the blind.
I do feel like there will be SO much going on in this movie I almost wish this was another Disney+ series so it could have more time.  This is a lot to cram into a 2 hour movie.
That Green Goblin Laugh really made me more excited for this ..
YOULL GET HIM WHEN YOU FIX THIS DAMN DOOR
If the Lizard is in a glass prison then I guess it's from that plot leak where Strange manages to capture all Six villains but Peter has a disagreement and ends up releasing them
Man this is why marvel is a heavy hitter They never fail to bring the goods, amazing
I swear if happy dies!!!!
Imagine if the punisher is in this aswell
i cant waaaiiit
•
i´m so ready for this movie!!!
Wait can Disney do this? Do they own Sony yet?
is it just me or does anyone else get any mysterio vibes from doctor strange...?
Wonder if that one dude that liked mj gonna be a villain
Hyped!
My exact reaction
You really make a breakdown 1 hour after the teaser. I wish I have that kind of motivation.
can someone breakdown the time line for me, in end game they dissappear and turn into dust,  so from there how do we get here ?
Hyped !
So the scene where he is running through a cafeteria...looks like he's wearing the black and gold, also looks like a shelter cafateria..also, when strange finishes the spell it looks like there is a couple, if not few, Spiderman silhouettes..last edit, right before Peter is in the interrogation room, two figures walking to the door of the room, one in a  white shirt, tie, and what seems glasses.. Matt?!
I am just here to listen to your Mephisto theory Paul.. 🤣
I think the woman in the car was liz’s mom aka the vultures wife
'Be careful what you wish for' IS STRAIGHT FOR THE FANS AND IT'S A SPOILER IN ITSELF.
Damn Dr Strange actually did something stupid and caused a big mess. Plot convenience I guess
you’re fast they just uploaded the trailer 😂
Yo! Sick video! Couple things to point out. In the interrogation clip peter is wearing PJs hes wearing when the shot of him and May on the couch happens! So he was arrested at home!
You didn't mention the voice of the Green Goblin.
Matt Murdock definitely in it it’s the guy who slams the files on the table
This movie will make all of our wildest dreams come true... not to overhype it or anything ;)
Absolutely NO WAY that’s Charlie. The guy in the trailer is chubby unless matt gained pandemic weight.
Question. Can’t doctor strange singled handedly clap all of spider mans villains??
Good to see you're talking about one more day. One more day sucks but it seems to work for this movie.
Little bit more patience and we r gonna get daily dose of spidey trailer.
how will he beat 4 of them? mysterio dock oc goblin electro? help
I think that Strange is going to be evil or going to get back at Peter
Hi the trailer looks great
Nah when he saying bruh had me crying 😂🤣
Tobey - "I'll join the trailer when you FIX THIS DAMN DOOR!"
2 movies where dr strange teams up with someone. and the fact doc oc and green goblin are back!!!
Peter going through a lot
I think he's in Tobey Maguire's universe.
That looks like the canyon from falcon and winter solider during the train scene
I'm hopeful we'll get at least a little bit of Tobey and  Andrew at some point, I'd settle for just a quick pop-in cameo, BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE GOBLINS LAUGH?!
that is def not Matt murdock. dude has a Gut on him lol
I'm so damn excited for this film!
That Iron Spider suit isnt upgraded at all. It's the exact same suit. Probably they changed it for the trailer so they dont spoil it, but the upgrade Iron Spider wasnt shown, just the black and gold suit.
Its PIZZA TIME
We’re not ganna get to see Tobey or Andrew until a TV Spot or a trailer closer to December probably
Lol solid asf lol
5 rings at 6:46
The “Devil in Disguise “ poster is a hint at Dare Devil is his lawyer
Those MCU box sets looks great! ;)
Spiderman wearing jordans but not the spiderman jordans missed opportunity
the scene is in 13:17
Until 2020 whenever a Marvel event happend I would watch a NR breakdown first...but last year I watched a couple of yours because you came out first...and then I would watch you, NR and Emergency Awesome.   Now I watch your breakdown first. Its consistently thr best one. EA is good too but with you guys around no one really needs to listen to "Hi I'm Erik Voss" any more!
The Question is ...  Is Doc Ock talking to Tobey / Tom ????....
i hop they find a way to keep the badguys around  id love to see more goblin and doc oct in the mcu  and the oringal moive verson   i loved there design and the actors  so i hop they keep them around for more moives
What's different about the Iron Spider's design?
Wasnt doctor octopus good right before he died?
Oh man, you’re too quick. It’s as if you were sitting by your computer waiting for a trailer to be released. Maybe your spidey senses were tingling
I can just picture Wong returning from his trip in the middle of NWH and when he sees the chaos just decides to leave again
Maybe Mephisto engages Peter near the end of the movie after most of the journey because he is lured to his suffering or something.  YOU DON'T KNOW YET!!!!
I know people have already posed the idea that the Dr Strange who casts the spell is actually Mephisto in disguise but I've already convinced myself that it's true. The Dr Strange we know in the MCU wouldn't use a world altering spell so casually nor would he do so without telling Peter everything the spell entails before starting it. So I believe that Dr Strange is out doing something (Maybe going to see Wanda?) and Mephisto disguises himself as Strange while the real one is gone in order to trick Peter into causing the events of the movie. After the spell is cast Mephisto disappears and the real Dr Strange comes back to find the mess Peter caused. I know in the trailer Strange says "We" caused this, but as we know Marvel will put scenes in trailers to throw us off so they easily could have done an alternate voice over to do the same. We won't find out it was Mephisto until the end credits scene which sets him up as the villain of Multiverse of Madness. That's my take anyway.
Who's the 6th member of the sinister six?   We see goblin, ock, lizard, electro, and sandman... Its not sinister five its sinister six! Where's the 6th member...
3:38 hhahah
Now, this clears up a lot of things. I guess it's only a matter of time before we get the 3 spideys trailer, right??
WAIT "NO WAY HOME" OMG PETER IS GONNA DIE SO THERE IS NO WAY HOME FOR HIM
I know no one cares about this Easter Egg now haha but you can see a ''DITKO" graffitti on the back when MJ and Peter are talking on the roof.
I kinda think the Raimi villains would be like, "Nope, I'm out" after a day in the MCU.  They're pretty much only adapted for a universe where Spider-Man is the only superhero.
i can see this happening in the movie  *after fighting for a while* Andrew: Alright guys check your webshooter's. Tom: Yeah got it. Tobey: ......check my what?
So at 2:50-2:55 where your saying its matt murdock, with you having slowed the footage down you can see the cop that is behind him is also wearing that color shirt and tie underneath his coat. I do hope its matt murdock but the clothing does fit the cop as well at 2:44
venom gonna come right?
We do not know that Cox is in this lol. Smh🤦🏾‍♂️
Nice breakdown. I'm cautiously optimistic about this movie. I hope Kevin Feige  kept Sony Pictures on straight and narrow for this.
The guy slamming down the papers looks to have a bit of a belly. Not likely to be Matt Murdock
That not Matt that dude has a stomach
Movie ends with nothing changed and everyone is still going to know who Spider-Man is, but now they know he is a hero. MJ dies though because Peter had to choose to save the world or save MJ.
I’m curious to see if Daredevil is in this, maybe the devil is in the details hints to Daredevil & helping Peter win his court case.
Why is this coming after Shang Chi??? If we see Wong leaving, shouldn't it come first???
Is tobey and Andrew coming back?
How would dr Strange bind a spell to someone if that person is like uncomfortably bold?
OMG, really hyped for this, really hope tobey and  andrew shows up!
What if he meets young Tony Stark?
How's about that time stone around Stranges neck?!
I think it’s Franco as Green Goblin and DeFoe’s voice still in his head.
Honestly, I am so excited to see this culmination of Spider-Man. And I can’t wait for Charlie Cox’s introduction to the MCU as Matt Murdock.
I cant wait to see side by side by side shots of the ending of loki and wandavision to strange doing spell for Peter. I wonder if it all happened at the same time
BAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRYYYYYYY
I’m 100% sure is not him 2:57 with a beer belly like that
If Toby isn’t in this movie I’m going to be so sad
Great teaser. Got chills at the end. Also my speculation:  1. Dr. Strange is acting kind of sus 2. I don't think Doc Ock will fully be on the side of the Sinister Six, if he is anything of the Doc Ock that perished/disappeared at the end of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2
In the one more day arc it was Mephisto that made people forget, but if I remember correctly Peter and MJ have no recollection of the run in with him and the events in the timeline that caused people to forget was later revealed to be Dr. Strange's spell.
Can't wait to see Green Goblin again! The first Raimi film defined my childhood lol
If Toby not in dis movie I might kill myself he literally is da best spider man
What?  No hexigons?  LOL
I am honestly surprised that apparently Peter struggled with his literal identity crisis for months and NONE of the other Avengers or the people associated with the Avengers (besides Happy) did anything to help him.
I'm amazed this breakdown came out so soon and it's not even half-assed. Quality work here.
It's not Matt Murdock, you see him walk into the room in the shot before and you can tell it's not him
Where is Tobey?The team at Marvel always has a job at ensuring their secrets from the set are kept that way until the movie is ready to come out. Tom Holland, who plays Spider-Man, is notoriously bad at keeping secrets and is often probed for spoile however, a recent leak of the upcoming trailer for Spider-Man: No Way Home is currently the spoiler focus for fans, with some plot details revealed. though already revealed, was seen once again in the flesh, while more of Doctor Strange's (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) role was revealed Who did not appear, however, were Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who fans are convinced will show up in the new movie. RAdda public reply...
Can't wait for Willem Dafoe to be back!! Make him an actual goblin though!! 🤣
Spider-Man³, Let's Go!!!!!!!
This guy is fast as fuck
the black and gold suit and gold webs is propabally gonna be used against electro since electricity cant pass through gold.
it would be great if the time variance authority from LOKI series join in
This is could be one of there best movies. I jut want to understand why strange would tamper with time and reality.
Sony: *drops trailer* Also Sony: “How’d that get in there”
The easter eggs are gonna be immaculate from past spider-man movies
If you pirate it, then I will sell you to Somalian Pirates.
I really wanted to see Andrew 🙃
The body of guy that slapped stuff down on table looked like foggy which I’d be super pumped to see both him and dd in the movie
Marvelously Spectacular Spiderman! Excelsior!
Lol I bet Andrew Garfield is not another spiderman, probably just a hotdog 🌭 vendor meanwhile Toby is a older version of Peter
Everyone expecting to see Tobey Maguire make an appearance in the trailer Sony - “Stings doesn’t it”
Did anyone notice the monitor, near where Parker is being held, has a large exclamation point on the screen?
Or does the M on Ned's jacket stand for Mephisto😳
The real question is, How did Dr Strange get the Time Stone back? Remember the one they used had to be returned to its original time..and the one from his correct timeline Thanos Snapped and destroyed....
spotted peters wearing jordan 1 shadow 😂
Generation Z reading a News Paper 🗞️ 📰. Now this is a comic book universe 😂.
thats not matt u can see the guy the shot before that..
That is not Matt Murdock. Unless he went on a binge eating diet. The Man without a Twinkie, I mean fear.
In my opinion I would really like to see the venom from spider man 3 after being blown up the symbiote and Eddie survived or introduce the new venom
Does anyone else see black suit spidey at 12:32 !?!? 😱😱😱
Did anyone lose a bunch of twenties rolled up in a rubber band?  Because we found the rubber band.
Definitely not Matt Murdock, I mean look at his belly
I HAD NO IDEA DOCTOR STRANGE WAS GOING TO BE IN THIS MOVIE I LOVE HIM
I'm pretty sure the guy slamming the folders down on the table next to Peter, is Not Matt Murdock. Look at the guy's Mid Section. He's too Fat!
that guy isn’t fit enough to be charlie cox. has too much of a belly
I have Daredevil Withdrawal after finishing the show and finding out there wouldn't be a 4th season, so I am holding out hope for 2:40
Lizard, sandman, goblin, electro, octopus best
I think the fight between mcu spiderman and sinister six will be similar to endgame, where it looks like the heros are losing but then, help arrives.
Waittttt green goblin octopus electro sandman lizard after this venom
the white shirt guy looks pretty fat if you look at his waist. not sure if he could be Charlie Cox
So the goblin maybe Harry from Amazing Spider-Man.....?
How is this guy so fast
Let’s go man
Charlie Cox does not have a belly, the man with the files has one. I still believe he'll be in the movie, but that's not him.
what if strange is casting the spell at the same time loki is wrecking the timeline
Absolutely stoked for this release, grew up on Tobey, loved Garfield with all its flaws, and love Tom Holland. Best Spider-Man yet, and I hope they have big plans for his future, and his amazing character in the mcu. Best superhero ever.
I think when tom holland spider man is at the police station talking to investigators. I don't think they're investigators i think its charlie cox daredevil as the lawyer.
The shot where someone walks in on him kinda seems like his house is getting raided because in the interrogation scene he’s in pajamas just like he is at home
Jordan 1 easter egg 😉
If u pause at 14:56 u can see a building from the bronx
Venoms in the movie.
In the scene of the “sand” rising up you can faintly see someone in red and blue jumping in the left hand corner
How do u guys get these videos our so fast
I havent been this excited since i saw peter show up in the civil war trailer
it’s not Matt Murdock. the dude has a dad bod.
Are we not going to discuss the fact that Peter is wearing Jordan 1 Shadow 2.0?
Well damn everything about the box and peter being chased by strange makes sense now …🤯
it’s already been at least 3hrs & ppl already find easter eggs😂😂
The first look definitely gives me the best vibes I have had so far!
You most of the things you time stamped you didn't even talk about...wtf 🙄. Miles Morales? Lizard? Electro? Etc.
Black woman - MILES MORALES MOM!
Is that train from spiderman 2
Appreciate the insight and the big spoiler warning so we can drop out.
It's not Daredevil in the white shirt and tie - if you take the frames of the two men walking into where Peter is in custody and brighten them up you can see the man has no glasses, cane and walking in arms folded (also doesn't look like Charlie Cox and is not built the same way either). Sorry, it looks like your mate who was your 1% chance it wasn't Daredevil was right lol
if that sand rising is sandman i am going to lose it cause john cena in his twitter teased him playing sandman
Wait what the actual fuck it's been only 2 hours.
I’m so excited can’t wait and my mind is going crazy
Bro I got the trailer as an ad while Watching this
Steven: The problem is you, trying to live two different lives  Peter: I missed the part where that's my problem
Only thing faster than Paul? Me when I leave the stove on.
Amazing trailer. And this also sets up Sony’s wet dream of the Sinister Six movie.
What if whoever walked in on Peter and aunt may, is tobeys Spider-Man? And they’re shocked bc he looks like uncle Ben in their perspective?
chunky dude at 2:56 is not Matt Murdock. look at that pot belly. :/
Cool breakdown.  Enjoyed your perspective
Damn, now I need to be annoyed about not getting a different movies trailer…
I knew it paul
You made it so boring. Quit YouTube
Def a nice Christmas gift!
I want the movie to come out already and I'm ready to save my money for all the legos
I may be wrong but... It doesn't make sense that he would mess up due to a teenager. He battled Dormammu as he was butchered to bits. Plus he's being too willy-nilly with changing reality when he was so protective of the time stone. It seems strange to me. It will all make sense when we see the movie, so I can't wait!
Fantastic video as always man🙏🏻
I hope Venom is in this!
Sony  its time to introduce miles morales in the mcu  Marvel  we cannot have him in the main mcu timeline yet. Until  spider verse 2, and  he will be in phase 5 or 6
*Trailer drops* Me: “Hello Paul”
I haven't seen any movie in Imax before, but swear to God, if Tobey and Andrew are in this movie, I will be seeing them in Imax.
Does not look like it's Matt Murdock at 2:57. Matt's too fit to have that kind of belly.
Peter and some stupid character are on the roof, not mj
If at least Toby is in the movie Ill be happy
6:23 what if Dr.Strange really is Mephisto and all of the snow/ice in the Sanctum Sanctorum is a play on “Hell freezing over” 🤷🏽‍♂️  At least it’ll explain Strange being so cavalier about performing that spell
The trailer dropped less than 3 hours ago, HOW have you recorded, edited and posted an 18 minute breakdown ALREADY???
So doctor strange’s spell has three rings.....like three Spider-Men? Hmmmmmm? hmmmmmm?!
If we get Mephisto in SpiderMan before the MCU we riot and party all at once!
😂 13:29
Only Bully Maguire can save them.
Nostalgia. Pure nostalgia.
Dr Strange doesn't has a made up name
Maybe that’s not doctor strange.
amazing video, great content, tks!
That "Be careful what you wish for Parker" was James Franco's Harry Osborn, if you listen closely you can tell it sounds a lot like his voice
Ok, I have two observations, first the box he carries around seem to appear in the center of the spell when strange missed it.  Second, when Peter is interrogated by two cops, look at the insignia on that cop arm. He’s not a cop, he’s a shield agent…
Is that a makem accent?
Eletro, Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, Sandman and Lizard.... I am READY
This is awesome!!!! I can’t wait for December!!!!!! This movie will rock!!!!!!!
One of the ads in video was the trailer this video is about for me
excited if Tobey & Andrew will be part of this, i cant wait.. but it all boils down to one villain thats Kang The Conqueror, i love the connection, good job on the Marvel Team productions
Not Matt Murdock look at that gut 😂
That’s not Charlie Cox….look at that guy belly that looks like an older person
Dr. Strange agreeing to cast the spell in Peter's favor is very reckless. Highly uncharacteristic of him. So my theory is he is not really Dr. Strange but probably some villain. (Mephisto maybe? Or another variant of him?). They are some scenes in the trailer where it shows the real Dr. Strange probably talking to Peter what he had done.
Not to sound greedy.. but we NEED to know if Tobey and Andrew are in it
Why is no one talking about the similarities between the spell interruption scene and the what if? Scene from the trailers when (dark) Dr. Strange releases bursts of energy on that rock.
why’d spider-man get so complicated i remember the times where he’d just fight villains and protected nyc
I think blade shows up at the end of Shang Che
Peter Parker/Tom Holland cannot handle the Sinister Six alone. They have become more powerful than what they are in the past Movies. So there is a 100% chance that Tobey and Andrew are in the Movie. The Movie will be useless without the two of them.
How on earth did you do this breakdown so quick 😂. The trailer came out an hour ago. I know you're from the UK.. as I am... its 5am bro! How?!
I was sitting here waiting for this breakdown from you. Love the speed you put them out with! Mephisto is definitely the final boss at the end of the MCU 🤣
So far counted 4 villains for the sinister six hope lizard is shown and the sixth villain!
Why isnt anyone talking about the symbiot suit shot in the cafeteria?
If we get tobey and andrew the internet will break
14:41 thats mj's mum. miles doesn't have a black mother.
Nice fast work getting this up
Let's be honest here: We all need a Oh For Fox Sake mug in our cabinets. That way people can leave you alone as you have your tea/coffee in the morning.
13:27 when we watched the no way home trailer
Can’t be Matt Murdock as this guy has a gut.
The scene where May and Peter are on the couch is when the cops bust in to arrest Peter. He's wearing the same pajama pants on the couch as he is in the holding room.
I don’t think that’s Charlie Cox , the guys has a beer belly and love handles. I hope he’s in it but I don’t think that’s him
Is it just me or has almost everything Marvel since Endgame has been about the heroes messing up instead of helping?
Not only fast at the breakdown most entertaining one too. Gotta love the heavy spoilers guarantee!
2 things. Did anyone notice that Dr Strange was not really himself? Where was the time stone at? And why would he prematurely cast those spells when he's already seen into the future and knows what things can happen? So he tells Tony Stark no. But just goes right on ahead and says yes to Peter? That was Strange. No pun intended. I'm going to allow that was Tony's line.
This movie is going to be insane, sinister six fights would be amazing considering all the villains are catered at this point including vulture!!!
2:46 I don’t think that’s Matt Murdock. Matt would have a leaner body type.
Everyone was wrong saying that Doc Strange still had the Eye of AgaMotto was a editing mistake at the end of Endgame. 👁
SONY : HERE'S YOUR TRAILER EVERYONE: WHERE IS TOBEY? SONY: YOU'LL GET HIM WHEN YOU FIX THIX DAMN DOOR !
This movie looks so good! Gonna be pretty lit!
DAREDEVIL?!?!
Looking at the Entrance of Peter and the interactions inside the Sanctum. Id say that the snow is Isolated to the inside and part of the reason why Wong is stepping out to warmer interior climates.
Peter and Strange what a duo
I think Marvel nailed this trailer. Much like they seem to have nailed this movie. “Iconic” is the vibe I’m getting from all of this.
Charlie Cox isn’t confirmed yet.
Flame on 😋😁😋
I saw that Devil sign and thought Dare Devil, not Mephisto.
The trailer was Amazing.
Maybe the black cat 🐈‍⬛ on the wall is a reference to Felisha Hardy ? I’ll
Omg paul mentioned mephisto!!!! After 3 years it’s on
It looks so sick
Looks trash
You mean to tell me that Dr. Strange would use a dangerous spell to help out a whiny teenager, but wouldn't use the Time stone to stop Thanos?! Ok, Marvel. I already have reservations about MCU's Spidey 3.
You're so fucking fast Paul      Are you the real Flash?
Although I do believe that Matt Murdock will be in the film, that is clearly not him at 2:56. The guy definitely has a "beer gut". Matt/Daredevil would not allow himself to get out of shape lol My guess also, that the banners with "devil in disguise" is an easter egg for Daredevil. I really do hope we see Toby McGuire, Andrew Garfield,  Miles Morales, Spider Gwenn and Spider-Man 2099 in this.  The trailer is one of the best for movies coming out this year. It's not going to disappoint.
the guy has a belly.. definitely not Charlie Cox but might be where he steps in to defend Peter
I feel like Peter is smart enough to know not to mess with magic like this BUT also to have faith in Matt Murdock who I also hope is in the film
Tobey's timeline is one where both Aunt May and MJ knew his identity but was mostly kept secret to everyone else, so I wonder if the spell got mixed up with that timeline in a way?
13:27 LMOAOOOOO
oh also bc you slowed it down I recognized one of the marvel tiktokers i follow at 4:26 or 0:48 in the trailer!  charlie_boy_o is much better at keeping secrets apparently lol
Goblin/Dr Oc/Electrco/Sandman and there’s a quick clip of Lizard
😂😂 Best part of this video was the Mitchell Brothers 🤣
I want to watch this more than the eternals
I feel like a kid on Christmas
just found your video right after watching the actual trailer. gotta say i love your content. the fact that you uploaded your well edited video right after the trailer was posted just shows how hard you work to make content. just subscribed with notifications on and liked. thanks for breaking the trailer down with comedy every now and then too lol.
I feel like the final battle is gonna be at a bridge or that the old villains appear there because you see like every villain there
Can’t wait to see the movie 🔥🔥🔥
I Fall in love with you every time I watch these videos ! Nice work !!
Too chubby to be Matt Murdock.
couldn't peter just let the spell happen then tell his friends and family again?
This is the most excited for a movie in a while
I wish they showed Tobey and Andrew
Lizard is the big one I missed. This is going to be brilliant. And @HeavySpoilers your breakdowns are 2nd to none. Great work.
Their called the sinister 6 but you only talked about 5 villains. Who is number six
Really like the comic info
2:43. Unless Charlie Cox put on some quarantine weight, I doubt that beer belly belongs to him
Took ya long enough
oh boy
Finally a good looking marvel movie. It's been a long time.
Just something I disagreed with. In the avenge the fallen posters for endgame, Wong was coloured in so I think he wasn’t snapped away. No hate. 😊
This movie probably has more hype right now then endgame did
My Spidey sense says that the 3 spider man pointing at each other meme will be here🧢
Friendly reminder that marvel trailers are completely untrustworthy. Also, everyone saying the portly guy in a white bottom up is daredevil needs their eyes checked
And Doctor Strange still has the Eye of Agamotto.
i think i spotted Toby Maguire's black spiderman suit from "Spiderman - 3" at 2:27 if u watch it at 0.25 speed you can see the suit clearly in the fight against electro
Heavy Spoilers lives up to his reputation when comes to releasing Breakdown Review real fast! Hahahaha
For fox sake is a shot at Fox
Yeeeet
When the green bomb appeared, I pictured William Dafoe as the Green Goblin. And bringing back Mr. Molina as the Doc Oc?!!!! The nostalgia and goosebumps came, it bring tears into my eyes. I felt like my child inside my body came back. 😭  I'm so hyped about thissss!!!! 🔥🔥🔥  PS: I miss Tobey's Spidey. He's an OG. 🕸️
Venom & Spidey crossover film will definitely happen. If Feige & Sony can make No Way Home happen, they can & will definitely have Tom Hardy & Tom Holland in a Spidey/Venom film no doubt.
Spid-acular!
This was quick af
So this just means, those old villians aren't coming to the main MCU. Peter is just going to their universe and fighting them.
Everyone excited to see together again:  Me excited to see if Andrew will show up. (But I mean if electro can come, why not Peter as well?)
“We do know that Charlie Cox will definitely be in the movie”   Please don’t turn into emergency awesome and casually say false information. There is no confirmation of this at this time   Love the channel, keep it up
So in the multiverse of madness.. i think strange is the villain. scarlet is like you cant do this, you cant do that been there done that. Strange is still learning little by little.. scarlet is progressing at an enormous speed. Dr strange 2 is not gonna be one sided tho.. i think
Spidey is having a very strange day
I'm so excited!! My spider sense has gone crazy!!
Amazingly awesome!
“Strange levitates at one point like in infinity war” I mean, it’s not gonna do much without the time stone lol
😁😁😁
2:22 there’s a guy with the same white button shirt but it doesn’t seem to be Murdock
This trailer was literally perfect
it would be sorta cool if miles morales was wakandan and somehow becomes black panther and spiderman at the same time(black spider?). i know it doesn't exactly lineup with then comics, but it would still be cool.
why does strange have the eye of agamoto??
I really want to know what box was spiderman was holding when strange pushed his astral from out of him
Post credit scene..Venom and Carnage
W
what if strange was actually mefisto in disguise
i can't see the lizard on the one frame 😭😭😭😭
That's definitely not Matt Murdock in the shot, that dude has a very obvious gut.
This is it boys! Years of waiting finally payed of
Had a theory from an early early leak, where there is a death in the film, that it would be the vulture as he saves peters life as a self sacrifice, but seeing them force everyone to forget idk if that holds up still, would still be cool and serve as the sixth villain if it is a sinister 6 film
Looks awesome. No other spidermen… yet.
Definitely can't wait for this movie. Awesome breakdown if the trailer, like always.
Nice work! You did it. You son of abitch you did it!
I know that once I hear Tobeys theme I’m gonna tear up hearing it for the first time in theaters since 2007
This video has got me even more pumped up for this movie. Great breakdown!
I swear if the doc oc thing is a cop out like ralphboner fiasco i am gonna stop watching marvel studios content forever
The major physical destruction..Rhino..the lightning bolts..Shocker..the grenade..Geeen Goblin..and of course, obviously Doc Oc
Ooo yea, entering the multiverse is now super easy barely an inconvenience
Ngl, my only issue is, being perfectly honest, 2 things. A, Strange would 400% tell Peter that it's basically Genie Wishing rules, and B, why wouldn't Peter know that messing with magic is usually Genie Wishing rules?
Nice mate
Enjoy your breakdowns man! Keep them coming...
I want the Inheritors from the Spiderverse Comics. I want an origin of their weird family and then lead into a FULL Spiderverse event.
wow u man are fast :0
Wow Strange is fighting and chasing Spider-Man
A very little inspiration form DCEU Zack snyder too.. really Zack Snyder made a very big impact as a creative  artist..
This came out an hour after the trailer came out. I just have one question HOW?
bout time
Wait I thought that Charlie Cox’s Daredevil was never confirmed?
I have a hunch that Strange actually had everything under control. That incantation line circle in the Dr.Strange and Peter scene could be the representation of the sacred timeline, by the time Dr.Strange is casting his spell, Silvie already murdered Kang thus maybe leaving the spell unstable because the sacred timeline has already been branch, and since Dr.Strange is trying to make the world forget who Spider-Man is, it got tangled with other versions of Peter Parker from different timelines therefore maybe dragged some of Spider-man Villains that the other versions of Peter Parker is currently fighting with their own timeline
the scene where the pile of sand is rising up towards the bottom left side we can see spiderman in the black and golden suit
Over and under for the percentage of this trailer that is not in the movie?
So this is not me criticising the movie before it out but I'm kinda confused on one thing.  Far From Home took place months after Endgame at least 6 which means No way home is set around that same time (2024).  WandaVision took place 2 weeks after Endgame (still 2023). Loki took place before the events of WandaVision but as it continued a bit to span enough to align with WandaVision.  But if when Sylvie killed Kang (even though the timeline was already branching before she actually killed him but because he's not around to keep the others in check it went into maddness) anyways yes even though when she killed him that's the moment she hears her kids then how come 6 months after endgame does NWH still coincide with WandaVision and Loki?? If anybody gets what I'm saying.  Unless because Loki left 2012 and enter a place out of time (TVA), even though he exists outside of time because his nexus event was so big that whatever somebody who was messing with the multiverse (Wanda) or magic on a large scale (Strange) that he was doing they just coincidently was happening at the same time as Loki's event... Coincidentally.  If anybody gets what I'm saying. Cause that's the only thing I can think of that explains that 6 months gap
Bro we are seeing this  More than 20 years what you will give spoilers😂😂😂
Great video edit sir 👍
Listen, you may be convinced you saw Charlie Cox, but if you look closely you'll see he's too fat to be Charlie
I've seen trivias that due to filming errors in endgame, Strange is seen wearing the eye of agamotto. 1:37 in the original teaser trailer and for the whole duration in which Strange casts the spell, he's still wearing the relic. Is it another filming error? there could be no time stone in it though :| ....
I am am way beyond hyped for this!!!
Flash has blonde hair and looks to be friends with Peter now and I love it
I am about to binge every Spiderman since I’m stuck in quarantine till the 31st

2:45 that's not Murdock - in the clip immediately before the one shown dude is walking (likely into the interrogation room) with his arms crossed and no cane assisting him. This being in a public setting, I doubt Matt would walk around like that.

We finally got the trailer but can't pay rent because the damn door isn't fixed yet  Edit: Daredevil must have be Spider-Man's Lawyer
We could’ve seen this movie sooner but Mother Nature had different plans lol
I feel like it would be pretty crazy if they used this to springboard into a Superior Spider-Man project using either the Toby or Andrew Spider-Man.

If all these villains come together near the end we’ll get tobey and Andrew’s Spidermen popping in to help Tom and the meme will finally be a reality!  Also… Mephisto confirmed

Just saying maybe that shocked look on Peter and Mays face was because of a uncle Ben or Tony showing up and if Toby and Andrew are in it I hope we don’t find out until we see it. P.S I literally cried from excitement
GREAT 👍

Always the fastest breakdown in the game
So the sinister six are coming, loki is trying to find sylvie, Kang is coming, the multiverse is starting to open, wanda is going to destroy half the universe to find her children, barren mordo will come back for revenge, Shuma gorath and Dormamu's niece are rumored to be in Multiverse of Madness and celestials are about to deal with the fate of the planet. And strange is on a winter vacation in his sanatorium:)

I can't believe you broke this down in less than an hour, video is amazing, trailer is amazing, the movie is going to be ultimate
Hopefully theaters don’t close so we can see the real numbers this brings in.
LOL Mephisto will never arrive in the MCU LOL...!
At 12:32 there seem to be 2 spiderman. One in black suite (right side of screen) and one in red-blue suite (left side , behind the sand).
too dark to tell that was the lizard, but nice can't wait
I love the on going Mephisto easter eggs, would be funny if they never use him and just keep teasing us to no end.
Holy shit the 'fox sake' mug! The leak was legit
It’s definitely not Matthew Murdock😂
i know that face
Dr. Strange Villain Version Is In The Movie :) There Will Be 2nd Part Of No Way Home ✌️
I hope that isn't Matt murdock. I just want them to erase the Netflix shows.
.. So Tom Holland created the Multiverse, by not shutting the hell up ?         Bully McGuire is going to put some friggin' dirt in his eye. 🕸
As some wise man once said: what happend there is of the most secret, so of course everyone knows it.
Goddamn it hasn't even been 2 hours you are fast my man
holy shet u are speed
fucking hell mate! This guy is faster than the FLASH
The first look just took me off guard. Was not really expecting to see Dr. Octopus or goblin tease on screen. So thrilled to see Dr stranger and spiderman working together. I am so amazed that Dr strange is replacing iron man position. Spiderman still have someone to look up too.
Honestly I’m calling it now the movie is gonna end like endgame Peter( Tom ) will be fighting all the villains by himself and losing until strange shows up opens portals and Spider-Man from different dimensions will aid him also I don’t think that’s sandman it might just be sand exploding from lightning
I got a felling when dok ock says hello Peter he’s talking to tobey Spider-Man!
This will probably be a fine movie but Dr Strange come on man! How’s this character look after letting Wanda go haywire , Loki skip through the multiverse and now Parker messes up a sorcerer supreme spell? Dr. Strange’s lack of doing things seems to be the biggest threat to the MCU phase 4!
Omg i cant wait!!
Strange was acting slightly off, Peter mentions that MJ will forget everything, Strange is able to wipe everyones mind. im not saying this as fact, but is it POSSIBLE that that was not Strange at all, but actually Mephisto in disguise? i dont read comics so i dont care one way or the other in terms of excitement, but its a possibility that clicked when you mentioned the one more day arc.
so fasttt
The black and gold suit reminds me of Kilmonger. Maybe it's from Wakanda like Falcons suit.
How can you say that looks like Matt Murdock? It's clearly a heavier guy, look at the shape of him, it's not an in shape thinner guy like Charlie cox
That shit fye
If the villains from the other spider man how much you want to bet the other two spider man will be there to just saying
@Heavyspoilers Paul this is one of the exact reasons I tell everyone to subscribe and like your channel and videos 1st to drop!!! Goat of this Spoiler ish!!!
Probably started the vid early with the leaked trailer
you missed the betty brant "cameo" on the screen when peter walk back in school
You are on it bro you got breakdown video out like quick time
That's not Charlie Cox, you can tell the guy is Pudgey and Charlie Cox is more toned
The M on the jacket stands for Mephisto.
Sound: i am fast Light: well i am the fastest Heavy Spoilers: amateurs!
Instead of uncle ben it should be tony. Im just sayinn it would be more special 🥲
How are people so fast?
So if it’s Tom Holland’s End Game will he die in it
I’m not sure why you said the Iron Spider Suit changed, it’s been the same since IW
who is the lady in the car??? I recognize her face and I can't figure out from where and ITS KILLING ME
I like the fact that Bully Maguire references are littered in the comment sections of all the Spiderman No Way Home videos. I really  hope we get Toby back to show up in this Movie too.
Awesome Breakdown
This Trailer looks freakin awesome! Sucks I’ll be back in college when it comes out lol
So no one gonna talk about J K Simmons??
I haven’t felt this excited for spider man since I was a child. I AM SO STOKED
I wonder if we see more  Peter in spiderverse
Tobey maguire will always be the Spider-Man not this guy but hey I'm a big spidey fan so I'm can't wait
Awesome breakdown!
12:34 is that really Kurt Connors? The red particles from it are throwing me off.
Am I the only one that noticed the flying red figure behind Dr.strange in the train scene?
This was amazing
I wouldn’t mind if Toby and Andrew isn’t in the film . I’m just so Excited that doc OCK is in it !
I just want Daredevil
I don’t know why doc oc turned evil again unless it’s another variant from a different time line. Who knows what if doc oc wants to kill Peter because he is the problem for this whole dimensional mess going on. Killing spidey can turn everything back to normal.
Dang your quick
Maybe charlie cox will show up as cameo, but I don't think the shot with black tie and white shirt is him, because the guy shown in trailer have some extra weight in the mid section.  Unless he was asked to put on some weight or fat suit.
Yup yup yup
The return of the infamous bully McGuire
There's a green light on the left side at 11:12 just next to Doc Ock so I guess Goblin and him are already working together?
This man described the entire trailer like what a day or 2 ago now, the source is strong with this one
I love how everyone assumed Strange would be pissed that Wanda and Sylvie were messing with the timeline, but then he goes and opens up the multiverse himself. and Soon I saw green goblin bomb and  doc ock I lost my shit
It's great to see Doctor Octopus and Green Goblin again! I can't wait to see Tobey as Spider-Man, Kristen as Mary-Jane and the OG cast as the characters!
Finally, the trailer we all wanted.
when I saw that pumpkin bomb I literally started freaking out!!
That magical box thing can be seen for a split second when strange's spell blows up at around 10:40
It would be a difficult time dr strange
there's probably a good reason theyre using the og spidey music instead of the homecoming theme
Doc Ock saying "Hello Peter"  has to refer to Tobey McGuire as Ock knew him to be Peter Parker - not Tom H.
Sam Raimi films were not the original.
12:32 actually you can clearly see Spiderman with black and gold suit
Im so ready for this, but im being careful what i wish for.
Im so ready for this, but im being careful what i wish for.
Peters legs crossed in figure 4.... Reed Richards confirmed✔
hello peter
He’s the type of guy who watches a movie trailer and doesn’t have to watch the movie.
Love from India
Looking forward to it!
I think Dr Strange opened up a portal to the multiverse with the spell because howwww is Doc Oc in this???!
Once again,why strange dosent use sling ring?
TBH you're better than emergency awesome. I realized emergency awesome doesn't do research. He just copies other reviewers and didn't cover the good information
Hey mate, it’s not Peter’s hair, he’s dropping a liquid!
It's Matt Murdoch if Matt Murdoch has a big gut.  Take a look at the stomache bulge in the shirt.  It's not him.
I might be heartbroken if there's no Tobey Spidey
Yay they are doing one more day storyline, the greatest spider man arc of all time. I’m crying tears of joy 😬😳😔😤
Were looking into that comic where his identity is public
Ngl, that train looks awfully similar to the one in spiderman 2
There will be 2 Spiderman in the movie Tobey and Tom teaming up together, a surprise to find out in the movie.
You made this video when the trailer comed
I'm hoping Venom appears in this movie
Ok don’t make fun of me, but what if dr strange is possessed by Mephisto or something. It just seems out of character that Dr. Strange would risk such a dangerous spell to help a teenager.
Never disappoint spoilerman
Definitely Matt Murdoch in that scene…you can see him walking into the room…his profile is a dead giveaway.
Mephisto confrimed!!! 😈😈Devil!!
I have a theory that Andrew Garfields, spider man is going to meet up with Tom Holland’s “Gwen Stacy” and it’s going to have us in tears
m n
Can’t wait December!
What’s the odds Mephisto is in this movie ?
The lights are vampires, not wizards. Possible allusion to Morpheus too?
lowkey don't think its the lizard and kinda think its more like venom
We don’t know Charlie cox is in the movie that is no where near been confirmed??
But it did show one thing that I was hoping they would have kept from the trailer… Peter does have that box that he tries to take from Strange to give to the villains so they can live and they show that in the trailer as well he’s being thrown into the astroprojection!!! I think that’s how we will get the other 2 Spiderman!!! Strange brings them through to stop and help Peter at the same time!!!
So Doc OC, Electro, Green Goblin, Snadman?, Lizard? Who would be the 6th for the sinister 6 then?
GF: You are so fast.
I can already tell Tom Hollands Peter is gonna be fighting the sinister six and then he's gonna get overpowered then Tobey and Andrews spiderman is gonna swoop in and save him
Crazy i was just a kid when  the first spider man came out now at 22 imma see all of this on screen my lil heart cant hold the excitement
Really hope a Miles Morales nod or cameo in this movie 🍿
Watch Marvel/Sony have Tobey and Garfield play pedestrians in the MCU and that's it lol
If Charlie Cox has a belly now, then I’m 99% sure its not him. Notice the pudgy belly on that guy.
so its basically its a wonderful life and into the spierverse?
Someone’s been holding out
It feels like watching full movie....🤯
We knee deep in the multiverse
Poor Eric Voss is still in bed.
Why is Peter holding a Motherbox?
God works hard…
I cannot wait to see how this turns out
The way Peter is on the run in this trailer reminds me of House of M Spider-Man
Brooo, this trailer went above and beyond. Also casual strange looks like a vibe
The pumpkin ball could be the hobgoblins way to enter the MCU
Ayo, so it's not just me thinking we might've been teased with a Miles Morales? Damn. Let's pray this movie doesn't flop.
U r fast
thank you so much for all the 411. cant wait to go see all three spidermans together.
That was fast
"Hello, Peter" changes everything.🥰🥰🥰🥰
Bro you are faster than flash!
Friendly neighborhood spoiler-man
I dont think its the lizard but venom you can see 2 white eyes and a muscular physique similar to venom
OMG, what took you so long to do this breakdown???    Just kidding, you are a legend!
Finally
That's not Matt Murdock that dude slamming down the papers was a meatball.  Murdock is a fit dude!!
lmaooo i love how youtubers breakdowns act like they know everything
how yall get this up so quick
Something is wrong with dr strange ?
3::44 - almost threw out my back from all the laughing.
Doctor strange has the eye agamotto again??? Even though the time stone is destroyed
This is pretty head on to the leaks you covered a while back
Doc has aged like fine wine
I think that if the villains are what if versions then this unfortunately increases the unlikelihood that Toby and Andrew will have much of a role in the movie if any
I'm dead hyped
Ask and you shall receive
AAAAAAH 🤯🤯🤯
So why does Strange do the spell? Isn’t he like the supreme the one who knows the most
I don't think Strange is viewing different timelines, as he needed the Time Stone to do that.
Where’s Tobey?
you said "bombastic"......... Bro!
Marvel works hard but fans work fast
Loved this trailer. I love the dark condemned feeling of the beginning and I think this will be a crazy movie cant wait. Spidey has always been my favorite
He wasn't going into court. He was going into his school. The clothes are identical inside the school. They are protesting the school which is also the large building in the areal shot. It looks an awful lot like Midwood high school in Brooklyn NY but don't quote me on it. It is a movie lol.
This they just show a glimpse of the lizard
Us: Where is Tobey? Bully-Maguire: YOU'LL GET YOUR TOBEY ROLE WHEN YOU FIX THIS DANM DOOR!
*Hello Peter*
I really want to see this movie
Not gonna lie this trailer was a little too much for a teaser trailer
Insane you already have a breakdown! So good though! Great job! This movie looks incredible…I can hardly wait!
Fans will go mad if this is all a myterio illusion
Just noticed how Peter and May are both watching The Daily Bugle on the TV
That part when Sandman pops up to save peter in the black/gold costume… nice!
I’d guess that’s foggy not Murdock
Never enter the contests cause I want someone else to have it <3
Green Goblin bomb goes off on George Washington Bridge, same place he killed Stacy. Maybe MJ dies.  Why does Doctor Strange have the eye of Agamotto when it was destroyed in Infinity War and he doesn't have it in Endgame...sus  Also seems Sandman redemption arc is intact. Blocks the lighting from Electro. Maybe double crosses the 6
Will the big reveal, more than the other Spider-Man's from the past, more than the returning villains, be the 6th member of the Sinister 6??  Goblin Ock  Lizard Sandman  Electro .........?  I kinda hope it ISNT Mysterio... but, I wouldn't be upset with it. I can't think of a Spider-Man man villain huge enough to warrant a huge surprise, except for maybe Kraven, or Chamelon?  Not counting Venom and Carnage of course....maybe I'm just forgetting someone? There's of course Kingpin, but they seem to be going with him as Daredevil villain and that's it, plus, I don't see him scuffling it up in a brawl with all these guys haha.... Oh wait.... maybe Keaton returns as Vulture? And/or Scorpion?
Awesome content my man I really love it
It’s gonna be funny when Holland turns out to be the only spider man
Wonder if the sign outside the courthouse that says “devil in disguise” could foreshadow Matt Murdoc (daredevil) representing Peter in court.
That editing with the train and uncharted 2 bit though 👊👊
In the comics, Spiderman/Peter always managed to find himself smack dab in the middle of any and every possibly messed up situation. Just like when he found out who the Vulture was. It has always been comic book karma for peter on a grand scale, as in the entire frickin multiverse!
Green goblin's laugh though!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
About the uncharted 2 train, yeah Tom Holland was leaked to be as young Nathan Drake, right?
Yes - civil war and brand new day
UK this is where I'm getting gonna blame Peter heavily a bit over strange because all homebody had to do is just reveal back himself and explain what happened instead of distracting strange lol especially since MJ figured it out on her own and just needed confirmation, Ned was all like my bestie is Spidey, and May would have the same reaction no matter what sooooooo
If that's Murdock, he's put on a lot of weight.
"Dat bitch spoiled everything..." -Sony
It's about damn time, this trailer released
The trailer was released 1 hour ago and the dude already make video. That's crazy
“Stop tampering with the Spell. Stop Talking.” - Benedict Cumberbatch, stopping Tom Holland from spoiling things.
The Electro Scenes aren't Electro attacking Spiderman. Pay attention! There is a Sandstorm and then a giant sand structure is struck just as it rises and falls. SandMan is in this movie!
Paul is a time traveler for sure😂⌚
I saw the devil in disguise and I was like a sh*t here we ago again, honestly was going to be disappointed if you didn’t say mephisto confirmed
Tobey is coming
Why is Dr. Strange helping Peter ? Just cuz he is curious too ? Then he goes on to warn him later...why?
The speed at which you are able to watch, analyze, film, edit, and upload this reaction astounds me! 👏🏼
Dude you need to sleep
Interesting
We do NOT know that Charlie Cox in in the movie, that hasn’t been confirmed, just heavily rumored
i think when this is over Spider-Man is going on Dr.Stranges permanent Shitlist
I'm so excited for this, "Tom Hollands endgame" is the perfect description!
That door finally got fixed!!! Its Pizza time 🍕 🍕 🍕
if aunt Mae dies im going to riot
All I have to say is it’s probably multiple Doctor Strange’s from different universes. If he still has the Eye it can’t be from the Endgame Universe
Thanks for all the content Paul 🐐 you’re the man
So this is all because mysterio leaking stuffs damn tony, even in death ur still indirectly creating mcu villains
That "living rent free joke" indeed deserves a thumbs up eh 👍
Daredevil
This is a nexus event by Dr strange. No TVA to stop this from happening, no resetting of this timeline
“I’m somewhat of an idiot myself” 💀💀  Hilarious/Great breakdown  🙌🏽
Imagine Benedict Cumberbatch playing Mephisto, maybe Mephisto is just a doctor strange variant
They called you a madman
It's been 84 years
Maybe we get Tobey and Andrew in the next trailer since this one was a nice teaser.
He's wearing the black suit at 1:17 in the trailer.
So keen for this🤩🤩🤩
Full movie breakdown next week?
YES ! XD
Is that blonde hair guy behind Peter and mj flash
Daredevil blind dude
I want a box :)
I have been waiting forever for the sinister six
It’s not Matt Murdock. That guy is too chubby and he’s not using a walking stick
Considering it got released one hour ago, I’m hyped also I played the trailer slow and the sand had a face somewhere, and once you see it you will know what it is.
Damn its so fasttt man
Legend havin this out so soon
I'm not completely sure Doc Ock is there to attack Peter. He might help him. He over came the chip in his neck at the end of Spider-Man 2 and would theoretically be a good guy now. Andrew Garfield should Superior Spider-Man (Doc Ock in Peter's body) That would be pretty awesome.
you work damn fast
Pretty good and detailed breakdown, can’t wait for any other trailers.
Phenomenal stayed up all night in the uk I think sand makes could be in this
This MANNIS REALLY IS IN GODSPEED!! 💀💀😱😱😱😱😱😍😍💜💜💜that one thing we all like to see!!
what is the on the bottom right at 12:32?
If Wong walked off to the Shang chi movie than that movie must take place after this ?
Was looking forward to this since the pandemic and its finally HERE !!!!😭😭😭😭
huh. seeing doc ocks slight visual xhange and the fact that electro has yello wlighting and is said to have a new costume i wonder if any of the other baddies will be changed visually? a lizaed that actually looks good? maybe we'll get a whole look look for green goblin, just paint his face GREEN nad give him his classic purple hat you cowards!   sandman looked perfect though, leave him be.
I just finished watching the trailer I scroll and this is the first other video I see, it's perfect! Thank you for this
Thousands of fan theories just erasedat one time like the TVA in Loki went on a spree. Now we have an almost too accurate idea of what No Way Home will contain after a half year of plot leaks. So now we can assume Osborn tricked Peter in to freeing variant Sinister Six villains from alternate universe Spider-man films that Strange somehow intercepted, and that he must now re-collect. It doesnt seem like the spell breaks the multiverse so much as it was already broken by this point because of the events in Loki... and the fact that Strange was apparently already trapping variants... unless they were escaping pruned timelines prior to the events in Loki.
I think this is way bigger than we thing. I believe it's going to start with Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, etc being pulled from the Multiverse and the ending will cause the Multiverse to go into complete choas leading into Doctor Strange 2 and Kang's appearance in Ant Man 3.           Edit: Forgot to mention this is probably how we get Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool
Its finally here
Why is Strange so quick to dismiss Wong's advice of not using the spell? Wouldn't the Sorcerer Supreme know the dangers of the spell? Why is he like "I wont do it" then does it? Seems impulsive and foolish.
What about that squirrel when dr. strange push peters soul thing out of him, squirrel girl? 😳 jk probably not 😂
I want to watch this but I don't want to cheat on 3C Films
Peter Parker never got a peace....✌️
At the 12:31 mark....you talk about a pile of rising sand, but what about the person with wings flying off at the bottom right? Vulture???
I remember when like 2 days ago this channel leaked the description of the trailer and now it's true.
Im excited
Btw … thank Female Loki … if she didn’t kill He Who Remains … the TVA would have stepped in and stopped this mayhem    So yeah … good female Loki
Oh God, when Ock said "Hello Peter" it hit me with Nostalgia, I love that movie when I was Kid. Looking forward for this movie!
Maybe he had the dialogue done since it got leaked Yesterday and added the HD scenes on the release.
A little disappointed if the reason all this happens is because he couldnt shut up during a spell. I hope this is just a bait n switch and there's a better plot in the actual movie.
Holy box set please oh god. Too much excitement at once wtf
I built nut when I seen the Goblin bomb, then I nutted at the end when I saw Alfred Molina
Thats definitely Daredevil
How did you manage to put up the video so fast dang
Insanely quick
If Aunt Marissa gets shot, I’m going to Hulk out.
How the fuck did you release spoilers exactly 2 minutes after Sony released the trailer?? Very sus
Unless Charlie Cox has been eating a lot of twinkies, and has put on a few pounds, that is definitely NOT him slamming the papers down on the table.
Enjoy the trailer as much as possible before Marvel releases zillion tv spots.
Puerto Rico in the house!!!
Is this shit.… wow
Zippity do da…
we fucking did it Paul!
Spoilerman😂😂
Dr. Strange is actually Mephisto. I'm calling it now.   Dr. Strange seems pretty flippant to doing this dangerous spell coming off of his Infinity War persona... So I don't think it's him.
Mr. Ditkovoch better have the caneo we deserved!
Mephisto is in the movie and Paul confirmed it. I won’t let you get away with it.
You're so quick. I respect you for that
I SCREAMED when doc oc showed up!
Awesome Trailer. Only downside is that it seems to confirm all the leaks.
Cool trailer….but somehow I don’t buy that Dr. strange would alter the timeline to fix Peter being outed as Spider Man! Isn’t it the sorcerer supremes JOB to prevent stuff like this from happening!?!? He screws up the spell and then essentially blames Peter for what happens?!?! I know they need the plot to happen, but I don’t buy any of this.
can’t we safely guess peter and may are reacting to police busting in from the lights in the windows?
it’s only been 1 hour yr fast
You did a rather detailed breakdown and I wish what you have shared would be in the movie. This is the movie to end 2021 on a high and I gotta watch this once it's out.
I’m just waiting for Toby tbh
Definitely gave a thumbs up after that joke 😂 9:15
That rainbow effect @ 10:30 is the same one from Doctor Strange When he first went through the multiverse!
I knew the lizard was in it I heard his roar and watched a clip of it too and sounded the same
Greta video! The sound when Strange was breaking the Multiverse was the same sound effect used in Into The Spiderverse
Not murdoch. Too fat
We finally got it. W
doesn't Steven look a bit like Little Finger from GOT???
This is going to be epic.
Matt Murdock puts files down in front of Peter 🤔
SO Excited For The Movie!
This is the last trailer or look I'm gonna watch about this movie.  The next thing I'm gonna watch is the movie directly.
I’m 99.999% sure tobey and Andrew won’t be in the film
bro it literally just dropped 😐
Damn bro! You're fast
We got sandman, goblin, ock and lizard in one trailer 🤯
Post credit?
watch spider-man ask the avengers for help and they’re like “who tf are you”
The hypnotizing women thing might be a reference to James Cameron’s Spider-Man script
"Christmas lights" in MJ's room? Bruh, those are just normal string lights that most basic bitches have in their rooms these days.
I can't wait for this--haven't been this excited since Endgame.  Will we see Tobey and Andrew? Damn, I hope so. And I love me some Doctor Strange.
4:19 reminds of when Flash fights Peter in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man film, but then again almost all school hallways look the same. I just mentioned it here because as soon as I saw that frame I got instant flasbacks to that scene.
So that bomb in the Falcon and the Winter Soldier episode was definitely a goblin bomb!
Can’t see the lizard at all
if they did not show tobey and Andrew in this film and just casted the old villains just to cash grabbed fans ima riot
Damn that was fast! 😂
Damn so the mcu sinister 6 will be made up of 5 past villains? I wonder who the 6th will be. Prolly mysterio vulture or maybe scorpion?
The moment I saw that guy in the tie I was excited because I knew it had to be Cox's Matt Murdock. Though I do wish he would play a bigger role or have a part in maybe a further end credit scene teasing his return
holy shit you're fast
Was worth the wait!
This had Me hyped! Totally gonna break Christmas🔥🔥
13:26 🤣🤣🤣🤣 unexpected
The guy in the shirt and tie could have been the guy wearing the exact same shirt and tie in the shot before just without his jacket on… idk just saying like I know we love theories but that was a huge reach that that was Charlie Cox especially how much thinner Charlie Cox is than that guy looked
Hey paul i have a doubt. In i end game thanos puts the stone into tiny like atom size but doctor strange has his eye of agamoto in. But he don't have the time stone right. But he is the protector of the time stone. So wouldn't he haved looking for the time stone🙄
We have waited along time for this one boys!!!!!
calling in right now this spider man movie gonna end in a cliff hanger with a teaser of Tobeyv and Andrew. Then in the next movie they will finally show Tobey and Andrew.
You were so quick to put this out but the quality is amazing. Idk how you do it but thanks for doing what you do Paul
Share some of that leaked info you cant put on here I want show nooobodddyy
Can’t wait for electro
Was super hyped when I saw this trailer and needed to watch more things haha
I don’t think that was Matt because of that belly but I could be wrong
all this discussion with spider man movie reference is brilliant, I'm gonna put dirt in my eye first.
Is it me ,or is someone impersonating Dr. Strange. I feel like Benedict Cumberbatch is being directed to hint it’s not the real Dr. Strange. He seems off.
That was amazing just like Spider-Man
Not Matt Murdock, he has love handles
mans fast
Here's my theory... What if Peter just asked Edith to show them the recording and proves himself not guilty?
7:13, you will see the black and gold suit
Is Strange wearing a Trump University Hoodie?
It’s the same green goblin laugh and bomb activating sound
the guy on 2:22 seem like the same guy who slammed the table, doesnt look like charlie cox
It definitely nothing to do with the hulk smashing through since that was 5 years ago, wong didnt go to titan or wakanda so probably repaired it straight away with magic. The reason i know that is its sunny outside in the scene Peter in the doorway. This is probably a spell gone wrong, i don't think mj has Christmas trees lights in her room they're just fairy lights this is typical of alot of American students in movies hell kamala has simlar lights in her room in the avengers game. Not a rainbow bridge, this is similar to the scene on Loki showing the Multiverses also that's not the lizards play back 0.25 shows more black smoke with an orange glow through it
Why I couldn't see the island of P.R. in the the No way Home title.....
That was deffinitely the black and gold suit when Peter was running through the school maskless
How fast are you?
No disrespect lol But I don't think that's Daredevil slamming the Papers, look at the dad Bod thru the shirt 😂
I've been a Spider-Man fan since i can remember. This movie looks like it's going to be incredible. Superior. Or might I say, the Ultimate, live action adaptation of the friendly neighborhood who-know-who. Hype: 12/10
The train could also be a big Inception reference.
Peter Parker the Recluse Spider.
So excited!!!! 🙌😁 I cannot wait to see this movie! Great teaser trailer! Spiderverse!!!! Multiverse!!!!
Would you say that quick shot of electricity was Electro? It wasn’t the usual blue like in TASM2
15:30 If they bring Iron Man back instead of Uncle Ben imma CRY!
HOW ARE YOU SO FAST
❤️🍀♾looks good
The shot of May and Peter reacting to someone entering the room could be one of the other Spidermen introducing themselves to them
Awesome review friend!
The dude that’s speculated to be Matt Murdock is quite chunky for a Daredevil 😕
Strange: The problem is you, trying to live two different lives  Peter: Stop lecturing me, please!
Can you change your name to "Quick Spoiler"?
Consider me educated, and good job getting this out! Excellent upload!
Billion dollars...
"YOU'LL GET YOUR RENT WHEN YOU FIX THIS DAMN MULTIVERSE!"
So the split happens cause Peter can't shut up and listen to directions.   I think the actual Peter would be smarter. But then we don't have a movie.      Go figure Disney  i give a + for doc Oct but that 8t only pulling on nostalgic.
The Devil in Desguise is defineky a clue that Mephisto will be behind it all.
I think the "Devil in Disguise" thing is maybe suggesting that some people believe that he was also Daredevil. Maybe some shit happened and Daredevil took a pause from being Daredevil and just went back to law full time. But maybe during or after this, and meeting Parker, he will jump back in and be Daredevil again, now in the MCU.
Great breakdown! Can't wait til Christmas
Honestly. I'm more hyped for the Eternals and or the Chang Chi movies. Don't get me wrong, I am excited for Spider man. I will be seeing it in theaters on opening day.  But I'm a lil skeptic about the idea they broke reality for something so selfish?! Would Strange so easily give in to an adolescent asking such a selfish wish? Don't get me wrong, what they have set up for Peter going through the global identity freak etc is heartbreaking, and makes for even more sentimental Drama, would Strange in his master of the arts and all his wisdom and skills of seeing millions of outcomes the Infinity war and knowing one is the way, and him living in all eternity with dormomu, only to return to reality after he bargains with strange, and how long it's been sense all that, so he's likely gained more knowledge, and wisdom, to now give in so easily to Peter? Idk!  Not to mention, how many ways can the MCU break reality and still make it all tie together?? First Thanos snap? Than Endgame and Hulk snap? Than Loki breaking his time line, leading to the intro of Kang? Wanda and her Hex spell mutating everyone? Now Introducing Eternals and the 7 day warning before the new beginnings? And now this? Spiderman, and Strange breaking reality cause peter couldn't live with this new idea of the global identity release?  Seriously? I'm excited for all of it!! But  How many ways can you break reality and keep it all tied together?? I guess we'll see!
The imported alcohol isely lock because cabinet consequentially fry pace a perpetual skate. motionless, daily richard
in the trailer at 1:15 you can see the new suit
Could we see white vision? Or looking more toward doc 2?
AT 6:14 tell me that’s not REED RICHARDS in the right hand corner
The date on the calendar in WandaVision. Marvel planned this all along.
Hey 10:30 those are the same rainbows shown in doctor strange movie when the ancient one tells strange to "open his eye"
Heavy spoilers posting a breakdown while everybody else posting a reaction vid. Heavy Spoilers built different
I HAVE NEVER CLICKED SO FAST BEFORE!
I've been waiting for you to make a video all day long LOL since I watched this leaked version of this last night but the CGI was it finished in the leaked footage obviously this one it was so I'm excited for your breakdown because it just haven't had the time to dissect this yet myself
You are frighteningly quick with these..
I can't wait for it!
Was Venom the villain in the house where happy was at?
You are on point with getting these breakdowns out
Now that the Spider-Man No Way Home is released, everyone is losing their minds.
Mephisto confirmed will never grow old.
I don't think it's Matt Murdock in the trailer. His figure is abit too, idk how to say this, wide I guess. He looked like some generic government agent with this weight and all.
Matt Murdock got fat if that is him....
this was mad
2:27
I just lost my mind with the “teasing” of Puerto Rico I just… omfg
Awesome breakdown, as usual... Thank you...
Bababooey Gangnam style
Woah nice catch if that turns out to be Matt Murdock.
So this man made this video, edit it and upload it with 15 minutes from the official trailer?
Did anyone else notice that strange has the eye of agamoto?
o Sandman is back, I heard The Lizard's roar, electro's yellow lightning, Willem Dofoe back as Goblin, Alfred Molina back as Ock and Charlie Cox's as Matt Murdock. Now all we need is Tobey and Andrew.
Not Mophisto confirmed... Daredevil confirmed...
So excited, cannot wait!!
wait willem dafoe is not in it...
OH YEAH. So fast
Daredevil who slams the files , Green Goblin Laugh , Sandman And Electro  that lighting and sandscene , Doc Oc  saying Hello , <3
Heavy spoilers is breaking records and btw that Hello Peter and that goblin laugh  man goosebumps
most likely miles morales wasn't blipped and grew up to the same age of peter parker(?)
Everyone : "Where are you Tobey! We miss you a lot."  Tobey : "I missed the part where that's my problem."
Does Shang Chi  legend of the ten rings take place after spider-man no way home?
Heavy spoilers he's Heavy on the Spoilers  😅😅 . Breakdown  Time
Trailer: *sinister laugh* Me: i know that ain't who i think it is
The trailer just came out how did you edit and release this video so fast 0.0
Paul made this audio for the video a week ago lol.. awesome job!
I screamed my lungs at when i saw the pumpkin bomb
They aren't "reading their phones" they are facetiming each other.
When paul is too fast for everyone for the spoilers "Thats what she said" hahaha
Paul is the quick silver of trailer  reviews. I think you were the first review out there.
THERE'S NO CRYING in Heavy Spoilers... Unless SONY takes or suspends your videos of life feed... Sorry Cosmic Culture... Tell your mums I said hello... BEST of the BESTEST...meow
I wonder where this movie is in the timeline is it before loki?? Is it during wandavision
My mind is boggling right now!
paul this was quick and i love you for it
The plot leaked was from a while ago? Becuz damn... To be that specific with the cube thing... That might be real
This was crazy fast
Wandavision episode 1 there is a calendar marked 23rd of August!? Hmmmm coincidence?
Getting all the spoilers coz the cinemas here will not be open until next year
Can’t wait to watch this. Finally coming altogether
Everyone on YouTube/ Twitter/Insta/FB WhatsApp pretty much all over the internet is talking about this trailer...Just amazing work I wish we get at least a glimpse of other 2 spiders...but at least we got our OG villains and that "Hello Peter" is not for Tom Holland's spider its definitely for Tobey
I'm solid as FOOK me! lolol
now we all can talk about it in full HD, black electro suit, inception city, a goblin bomb and an octopus, but the best thing is Dr Strange with his "I'll allow it"
Lol 😂 13:27
The tie dude can’t been Daredevil since that shot is before the whole multiverse collapse
The guy you think is Charlie Cox has a spare tire, there’s no way that is daredevil
Fastest man alive
How ? It’s almost as if you had this ready. Maybe you had the trailer all along Paul. We’re watching you
I thought the scene with that creature coming at peter was venom. It doesn't really look like the lizard cause its more black with white on it. could maybe be a end credit scene.
13:27 though we wouldn’t notice but we did
Wasn't this released only an hour ago??? And this video is 18 minutes long??? So you broke it down and edited in 40 minutes??? WOW
Honestly so hyped for this movie i can’t wait to hopefully see all three Spider-Men in a movie fighting the best villains. Also the movie comes out the day before my birthday so thank you Sony and Marvel🙏
1-The guy walking in on may and peter is ben parker from another reality. 2- ned and mj is with peter when he speaks with strange but it was edited out (check pictures released weeks ago) 3- the black suit is from a nightmare scene
13:27 😂😂😂
u already broke it down ?
Is it just me or does Benedict Cumberbatches  wink feel like a nod to his Sherlock wink and smile
ITS THE FUCKING SINISTER SIX [these are the times from the trailer] @ Electro @ Sandman @ Green goblin @ doc ock
Can’t wait to see this movie super hyped
Sony: *releases the Spider-Man No Way Home trailer* One Minute Later Paul: “Spider-Man No Way Home Official Trailer Breakdown | Easter Eggs Explained & Things You Missed
And mephisto confirmed 😂😂😂😂😂
Thanks Paul
Fast huh?
THAT WAS FAST
Spidy 4 : No Home At All
Really the best in the game bro trailers been out not even a hour and my guy has a 18 min breakdown READY 😂
That was fast
WOW WOW WOW!
03:01 not Charlie Cox the body size doesnt match that dude is way to pudgy. No body sham just being observant
Watch it be horrible
The hype is insane rn!! You are the GOAT
You just predicted all of it
U sir work very fast
Dam I wanted 2 see my boi Tobey Maguire the og Spider-Man
i would like the skill of hypnotyze girls
Bro how the fuck did you get this out so fast
Jesus Paul your way too fast they literally released the trailer like half an hour ago
Can’t wait for theis.
Wait. Didn't Mysterio die in London England? What the hell jurisdiction does NYPD have in a murder across the Atlantic? Go ahead Mr. Murdock take it from here.
Its only been an hour since it was released and you somehow did it within half an hour to make this
If you Slow down the Sand man part you can make out Him. In a blur
I wonder how this movie will be for people who don't watch every marvel property, people that only watched the Holland Spider-Man movies and didn't watch Doctor Strange or the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies. Not everyone watches everything.
Fastest breakdowns in the west
We got to thank Silvie from Loki for the multiverse happening in this film.
i thought it was sylvie's fault for making the multiverse
You did this way to fast
If this actually comes out around Christmas then it'll be the best present a fanboy could ask for!!! Can't wait Paul 🖐🤞
Concept:what if the final line of the movie ends with Peter in a press conference and he says “I am Spider-Man”
Did you get early access to the trailer? I know it leaked yesterday but we didn’t get the HD version until a little over an hour ago and this is a 20 minute video that was posted 40 minutes ago lol
Bro the trailer was only released and hour ago
STRANGE HAD THE EYE OF AGGAMOTTO
Amazing Breakdown Spoiler Man 👍
Hello Peter. Was the best part of this trailer
Maybe MJ really dies in this movie, Then Peter does a Wilson Fisk to pluck her out from another universe. That's where Dr. Strange is warning Peter Parker, eh?
i wana see sam rami j jona  jamason interact with mcu j jona jamason
When I seen the green goblin grenade I got excited as hell. So excited for this film
you smell 🥸
Ahhh I went for a snack after watching the trailer and I’m back right on time lol.
I love how fast you are sir
Knew I could count on you to have a breakdown for it first
I'm pretty sure that figure who you think is lizard is venom from spider man 3
Pizza Time
Your fast ain't you first breakdown video haha didn't even see the trailer before this come out
Omg i cant wait to see this movie Spider-Man is one of my favorite super heroes december cant come fast enough
That effect looks like timelines from The Loki series
I don't care if Tobey and Andrew are in the movie I feel it will be a top tier marvel movie either way
Welcome to the sonyverse!
You breaking down Sony or Marvel's Official Teaser? Cause they are not the same thing.
Yesss
This is definitely not Matt Murdock. He is too fat to be Charlie Cox
11:00 so are we just not gonna talk about Tom hardys venom being shown behind peter??
Major goosebumps
All the snow is just for all the hiding “Pengwings” Doctor Strange is trying to find there.
If that is Matt Murdoch in the shirt and tie, then he's put on a few pounds since we saw him last.
Damn you’re fast af! Thanks for not make me wait
Damn
Pause at 12:32 bottem right it looks like black suit from Tobey Maguires universe the Web patterns on the suit.
So quick
I dont like how he has to explain mysterio wasn't real. Like Bru the man died in pajamas. Wtf?
Everyone: Where's Toby and Andrew  Me: Where's Flash
I honestly can't believe that you are MORE excited for Robert Pattinson as Batman (the guy who didn't want to work out) over Spider-man: No Way Home.
You are a true hero for editing this super fast 😭😭😭😭
Wow. You are on this quick!
Who’s Paul? I only now definition 🕵️
Ok the "Mephisto confirmed" got me.
How does it feel to be Ryan Arey’s fluffer? And how come your bird is a sort when you look like the kwik fit man. Either it’s the you tube bucks or you’ve got some giant Corey. I’m saying it’s the former
Are we sure that we definitely know Charlie cox is in the movie
My guy u are QUICK
Nice job!
I think the person coming in and surprising Aunt May will be Charlie Cox.
How cool would it be if  at the final battle, Tobey’s Spider-Man says “looks like we got a rematch ock” to dr octopus.
lol that is not matt murdock in the trailer. That dude clearly has a gut
“You mess with time, it tends to mess back.” - Tony Stark
hello peter
I hope whoever  leaked the trailer  lost their job
“Pennsylvania station”…it’s Penn Station mate lol.
I feel like Strange makes a noob mistake.
So hyped for this.
Also Dr. Strange behaves like Tony and I think Wong is going to Madripoor to figth.
How about Ben Affleck DareDevil shows up with tv series DareDevil and Peter can't decide which lawyer is better. Then Batman shows up and he's actually T2. Then they Alien into the moon and goofy woofy woofy.. Imagine what the next Spider-Man movie will be like to keep you interested..
Clicked faster then heavy spoilers assuming it’s mefisto
Spoiler man couldn’t wait 😂😂
The cafeteria scene actually looks like the one from TMSP 2
😍😍😍😍
The guy in the white shirt who slams the papers down has a gut and love handles like whoa
Heavy Spoilers the GOAT
I still think this will be a mix of One More Day and, of all things, It's a Wonderful Life
Bully Maguire is typing...
the trains Dr Strange is using look just like the train from the famous 2004 fight scene!
was that tobey's voiceover???
Plot Twist: Our Man here has the timestone. (Hence the instant breakdown)
I almost thought the trailer was fake
How are you so quick with theseeeeee
Wow! That was fast.
Dang you are fast
U Made marvel release the Trailer u Damn Hypnotising Male Spider
If that Matt Murdock then he's secretly the man with no gym card
Dr. Strange is officially the MCU's new Tony Stark
THIS WAS POSTED SO FAST i mean the trailer only came out 1 hour ago
The badass spolier
Damn leaks confirmed
Your source was 100% right!! He even got Dr. Strange's fox mug right!! Instead of rewatching the trailer, I told hubby to come and watch you. For all those little details our mortal eyes missed.
I have never clicked so fast!!!
i’m so hype
Sony: there you got your trailer Fans: Where is Tobey Sony: You’ll get him when you fix this damn door!
I think that’s MJ’s mom
Since we're entering Multiverse territory, can Dr. Strange reverse Gwen's death, so that Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker can get his happy story ending?
Im so glad jamie and alfred are back
Yes the goat broke it down
How the hell did you watch this, find everything, record voice over, edit the video and upload...IN AN HOUR!
Alfred molina doc oc looks sooooo good. God that de-aging technology has gotten so good. Literally bring back anyone still living to act in their prior roles.
99% matt?
if you say the guy in the shirt and tie was Matt youre bonkers. homeboy has a belly thats very obviously visible, and a navy tie that matches the one under the cops jacket. its not that hard to see.
CHARLIE COX LETS GOOOOOOO DARE DEVIL CAMEO
Per my comment on the previous video everything was right but it looks like the trailer was cut down
You deserve the world Paul
Peter’s wearing the black and yellow suit in that shot with the sand rising up
Anyone noticed a black figure in the trailer!!!!???  This is the time :  2:26 i think i saw venom attacking tom   Edit: Check the time in the Trailer not here XD
The time has come😁😁😁
Sigghhh... These Spiderman solo movies are overall not that good.
Okay but like, doesnt it seem *strange* (sry<3) that doctor strange just easily agreed to changing the way that situations happened for peter's life? I feel like he would've shown some restraint..
Is dafoe comin back? 🤞
“Hello Paul”
Oh my god. I salute your commitment
The white shirt guy is not Matt. In the 2 brief scenes you can see that the guy has a bit of a belly.
Very very very very nice
that dude in the white shirt is too fat to be Matt Murdock, unless Charlie put on a beer belly for this
So much Mephisto bait. At this point I think every Marvel project will have a Mephisto easter egg like he's the new Stan Lee.
I wish she hulk could’ve come out before this so she could have also assisted Peter legally along side daredevil but hey it’s still going to be great
I do hope it’s not the last mcu Spider-Man film
Whoever gave that description of the trailer to you was dead on.
I saw 5 villains
Breakdown game strong
hey Pauly Boi Thanks for uploading this Fast Love ya!!!!1
Why didn't he just as Talos to pose as him? Or do people know about skills at this point?
In the last video whatever you told was shown in the trailer so I Liked your videos Forever 👍👍.
U do be speedy like da flash
As I woke up,  I see this video in my notifications , then I go watch the trailer and here I am watching the breakdown.  HEAVY SPOILERS OP 🔥
Trailer dropped an hour ago and you already have full review and edited/uploaded video? Bravo 👏
You are fast bro 😅
Can't wait for the 2nd trailer when 2 spiderman show up
Super fast, as always!
you can take a look at 2:26 in the trailer that lizard’s hand try to get peter
This is hilarious! After that leak Kevin Feige was like "UGH just release the trailer 🙄"
HEY TOM HOLLAND IS WEARING THE BLACK SUIT IN THE TRAILER. I THINK ITS THE CAFETERIA PART WHERE HE REMOVES THE MASK. ITS THE BLACK SUIT
That pun you made in the reel rejects sketch was so bad it was good
tbh I think Ottos de-aging kinda looks bad. I hope this isn't final. Fury from Captain Marvel was flawless.
THERES NO WAY U THE FIRST ONE WTH THIS OUT
The quickness of this man.👏🏿👏🏿💪🏿
how in the fking multiverse are you so fast?????
Thanks for staying up past your bedtime to break it down with us. You can go rest now, Paul Potts.
You sir have got yourself another sub cuz of how fast you r
Paul is quick on the this stuff. That’s why I love this channel 🙌🏽🙏🏽
Good lord you are quick
So Dr. Strange will tamper with multiverse just to hide the identity of a superhero when basically all over them have no secret identity? Sounds stupid. Also seems like a cheap way to build up Sinister Six and fan service Tobey and Andrew fans. Totally lame..
Holy hell you were fast... here's your rent!
Fuckin nice. This movie looks ballin. Can’t wait
Jeez, you got this out faster than I could watch the trailer!! 🤣 Great breakdown as always! Keep up the great work
I just want to see how many views will the trailer get.
How did I know Paul would be the first to drop something for a breakdown! Let's go 🤘🕸️
Cmon at least time your video out... lol You just telling everyone you work for marvel or someone big. lol
the cop in the room was literally wearing the same shirt and tie. its not matt.
How did you break this down already?
Damn here right on time, Paul!
Unless Daredevil is fat, that wasn’t him. Detectives wear shirts and ties too especially fat ones
/slow clap - Well done on your spoilers. Also.. damn man you're so fast you might've broke the multiverse. Then again, with great youtube channels comes great response-ability. hur hur see I can do it too.
Damn Man how fast are you
Wow Paul you're soo fast ... It's just been only an hour ...
100% Case solved Spiderman is Mephisto bro
Bro how did they get this out so fast
paul u are an absolute legend, ur work ethic is outta this world, massive shout out to u🥳
That's doc oct
"Mephisto confirmed" 😂😂
Yesss, also you can see the black and gold suit in the scene with the sand
I love this speed😅
Legendary! All hail the spoiler man lol
“Hello Peter” -Doc Oc “Which one are you talking to?” - The 3 different Spider-Men in unison.
Why is that a flash back, clearly the beginning of the movie, Way before he goes to Dr strange.
I know it’s real but it’s too good, so good that it feels fake
I wonder how lit the next one is gonna be.
How did you do it?
Seeing your breakdown notification is how I found out the trailer came out 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Thanks for the heads up
I think heavy spoilers is secretly Steven Strange
kool its the Evy Spoilez show
This Is Only A Teaser Trailer and It was Amazing
Are those rainbow colors also a connect to Wanda Vision?
I knew you had this one ready to go, you mad lad!!! 🕷
Alex Jo... I mean J. Jonah Jameson was right.
Definitely the title of the next one "Spider-Man:Homeless"
That's DEFFINITELY Matt Murdock ehh ehh I can be quite wordy too ehhh DEFFINITION
That remixed Spiderman theme 🔥🔥🔥
Anyone think No Way Home will do down as a classic Christmas movie?
That was fast 😂
It barley came out.
my inner childhood just got warm when i saw doc and green goblins grenade
This looks crazy!!!
I don't think that's Miles' mother, I think it's MJ's mother
Excellent breakdown
the trailer length is 3:03 and volume 303 of spiderman is dealing with time, check it out if u see my comment
I am here late but definitely here   Was waiting for this trailer for 85 years
This Trailer was leaked but Damn still mind blown
This man is a wizard
This drop during your premiere"   Aydn - No Ride Home     "    UKF Drum n Bass
Thanks for all that you do 🤝
Paul lives between all of the multiverses
No sign of more Spider-Man’s
Good i was waiting for this
LMAO U FAST😂😂
4:46 😂😂😂😂
I heard Joel McHale was cast also and they re-aged his hairline back to spiderman 2 when he played the banker Aunt May smacks on the head.
I just wanna see electro and his new drip
amazing video but now its time for trying out my luck for the prize
I ran over here so fast lol 😂👋🤓
We all know now that the reason why you upload this so fast was because you are the unknown spoiler. For that you the GOAT
17th December gonna be a feast 🔥🔥🔥🔥
It hasnt even been an hour oh my fucking god
What we didn't see in the leak was him with cuffs on
Great stuff
Maybe Peters history just got combined, so all the villains perceive him as their Spider-Man and then just band together to fight him. Tobey and Andrew prob gonna come back after strange fixes the spell he just did
So who’s the villain.??
This was up faster than I expected 😅
Spoilers Smoilers the Multiverse idea is super cool..just wish Madame Web could've made it in somehow.She was deep man...
I’m convinced you don’t sleep. You just stay awake waiting in the shadows. Seriously though I’m hyped for this!
Wow this was fast
Can’t wait for this!!
Pretty sure Paul actually lives  2 hours in the future.
As I was watching the trailer I’m like wait, heavy spoiler got the info correct like I feel like I’m watching it for the second time lol 😂
You where right the whole time!!!
Love that the helicopter is WYPE like wipe away their memory. And your Norman clip lol
Trailer was dope 🔥🔥🔥
I'm actually surprised at how young Zendaya looks in this movie considering she's 24 and looks OLDER than that in her red carpet shots but here she's a very passible 17.
Man that was super fast…
Hello, Paul.
Paul..it's been 30 mins bruh
I’m excited to see Doc Ock Spider-Man 2 is still one of the best comic book movies ever By what we seen there are possibly five villains and that’s one short of the six…
OMG THAT WAS SO FRIGGGIN DOPE!!!
This movie could be up there with IW and Endgame!!! I am so hyped!!!!!!!
Cant wait to see this.
How is this speed possible..
Yeah we fa sure going to get that uncle Ben scene that you was talking bout I know imma cry 😢 I got a feeling happy or Ned gonna bite the dust fuckk😭😭
My theory: spell make it so that it's all in peter's head. No way Dr strange would have overlooked peter influencing the spell, and should have told him to shut up beforehand
Can’t wait!!!!
This was the perfect first trailer. Wow. I so want more but now I can re watch this to satisfy my needs🤣
I wonder if we’ll see Kraven in this film as well
Holy moly Speedy upload 🤯 you rock!
Anyone else drop everything to watch this video
Disappointed that it's not linked to Loki series
What if he’s doing the spell in the exact moment the timelines does split in Loki
I think this will be the only Tom Holland Spider-Man movie I'll like. Maybe because of Dr. Strange and all the nostalgic characters returning...That's not Murdock.  Lol that guy has a gut!
Let’s go I was waiting for our friendly neighborhood spoiler man to post
this is soooo bloody good i all ready love this YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
Damn
Love it, still curious if there will be a sixth member of the sinister six, we've only seen 5 so far
Nice! Can't wait...
This is just like comics, nightmare removes the memory that he is spiderman, even mj and his marriage! So in this
If they bring miles, I hope they bring a live action spider Gwen.
Its a good bday gift from Marvel and Sony
Fucking deadly
I cannot wait!!
I honestly thought the trailer would disappoint, I can now say I was VERY wrong
Like that trailer lol but the hype was too much ...cant wait for the movie
Hope they do it  right !  Also im here for the marvel boxset. Tat looks sexayy
I believe there may be a lot of Marvel trickery in this trailer. I’m so hyped tho. Bruce Campbell Mysterio ftw
Spoilers ftw, gotta love doc ock
Most excellent video
could jimmy woo also be interrogating Peter?? Last time we checked he was near New York?
if they bring Daredevil and the two other Spiderman it will be the goat movie
I hope we see Garfield and Maguire in the film but I have a feeling they will only show up at the end.
Loki, WandaVision, and now this. Damn, Strange can't catch a break can he?
Insane teaser trailer! One of the best ever
Awesome that you were able to react to the trailer so fast!!! I'm so excited for this movie!!!
Awesome review
I absolutely LOVED this teaser.
THE DAFOE LAUGH
Thanks
It's not matt slamming the paper down to chunky look at his stomach.
I want a Bully Maguire Vs Holland
Fantastic trailer!! Looks beyond awesome!!
finally!!!! Thank you paul.
Dang this trailer will be living in my head rent free.
Doctor Strange's outfit will be a Halloween fave lmao
Can't wait
Can’t wait
Yo
hi
🔥
Gonna put some dirt in your eye
Awesomeeeee
Anyone think Tom is secretly getting a classic suit????
I love how Paul calls Penn Pennsylvania station I nearly forgot that's what it stands for lmao
This is gonna be craaaazy! I can’t wait!!!!
Randomly pick me
:)
i love the trailer but with all the spoils it almost ruined the trailer mostly bc i love watching Heavy spoilers
Calling it now, Venom in the post credits
Is this the last spiderman movie by tom holland
I LITERALLY SCREAMED WHEN I SAW IT
the ending gave me chills
And it explains why DS,Wanda and loki ,spiderman are important in phase 4 ,cuz they screwed up the fucking multiverse
So wait was it Peter nagging doctor strange while casting the spell or did the events of Loki and WandaVision happen to coincide with this that created the multiverse and that "hello,Peter" at the end was dope and definitely to Toby's Spider-Man
Absolutely amazed at your speed & quality!
LESSGOOO
Dr strange being reckless
Heavy Spoilers whenever a Marvel clip is released: " I AM SPEED!"
✝️  Fellowship invite
Ok but how long is this movie, bc the whole trailer had no alternate Spiderman, so it makes me worry they’ll have little screen time.
64th
Lmao Uncharted 2 ... Hahaha since you know .... Holland being Cast as Nathan Drake... 😒😏
What if that thing that “went wrong”, was actually Sylvie breaking the multiverse in Loki
When strange pushes Peter into asteral form,we can that cube we talked about in leaks !!!!
Surely this is part of Sony’s plan to take Spider-Man out of the MCU
Oh Fox Sakes lol it’s true
I didn't watch the trailer yet I was sleeping it come in the night in my country
I prefer venom films over sp but after this trailer I love him ,for the first time our expectations came true
The fastest upload in the west!!!!
Multiverse of madness finna be little too
I jumped off my sofa when I saw the trailer was released!!!!
how is he this quick
Never doubted you even a second spoilerman...and you were right
Love it and thank you for breakdown
Here to promptly start a war between those who saw the official trailer first and those who saw the unfinished leak first
Was that yellow lightning in a...sand storm? Dun dun dun
Can you not spoil the thumbnail bro cheers, consider others next time
Strange making the world never know that Peter is Spiderman will bring Mysterio back to life
Can’t wait for the part where Daredevil bails him out
Holy hell that was quick.
I guess you could say Peter messing up the spell is a nexus event.
Please don't remove Mephisto memes in your Marvel breakdown...
I am more Exited For Willem Dofoe's Green Goblin than Anything🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
but like. what if mephisto ends up being at the end and that leads into the multiverse of madness where wanda is trying to find her kids and has to go through mephisto
The most exciting movie of 2021
You give me rent! I live in Humbolt Park
Thanks for this!
Hello Peter
Such speed what a god, less than an hour after the trailer was released
Take a shot for every mention of Mephisto
Missed M.J.s clothes on the roof! Look familiar anyone?
Heavy spoilers leaked the trailer details so it makes sense he got the breakdown out so quickly
Bruh...How tf did you punch this out so quick? Lol
Sony releases the trailer and practically instantly heavy spoilers breaks it down. Paul you're almost too fast!
He looks like the what if strange
so lol how was watching a commercial early going I make you feel disappointment to watch a commercial early smh
3000 people watching now people drop likes!!!
This! Will! Be! Awesome! Thanks for this one
It’s definitely Matt Murdock with the white shirt, black tie that’s kind of thin and rolled up sleeves.
I doubt that’s Matt Murdock unless he gained some weight
thanks for your entertaining videos and cheers for spider-man shutting down the internet now
Flash must fucking love Peter now hahaha
The ending gave me literal chills!!!
Hi Good Morning Day Everybody and Good Afternoon.
Seeing Daredevil excites me more than anything
The pumpkin bomb that shows in the trailer is the same that got showed in Falcon and winter soldier
Hey man how come you and 3c films have beef?
I wonder if that door got fixed or not...
Dam you did this breakdown amazingly fast. You need 1million subs and beyond asap.
respect for the speed!
I can't wait to see the movie in theaters
Hello Peter!!!!!!
YOU: Waiting for a No Way Home trailer.  ME: Waiting for Multiverse of Madness since WandaVision.
What's wrong with dr. Strange 😕 where all that energy and intelligence go he too smart to do something that stupid 🤷‍♂️ is this just another version of him🤔 he really sounds off and act unreasonably his character gives iron man vibes
The fastest guy alive to date!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BRUH!!!
