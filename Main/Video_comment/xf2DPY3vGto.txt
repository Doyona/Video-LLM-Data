Controversial Topic I know, what's your take? 😂 To check out my Best Phones of 2022: https://youtu.be/0i4z5tqRzPg
U should do a tablet edition of this with the newest Samsung tablet and the newest iPad
Arun: Hi what's up MKBHD: iphone
We need an update.
Android is better ❤
And MKBHD is a android fan
Can we get an update on this
Android 👍😎🤘😏
Even the tech experts are fooled by apple 😂😂😂
I think men these day every little thing harms them. The edge of the cell to much for u boo hoo
We need a new 2025 update
5:35 wtf
Two apple fanboy talking casually
Taking into iOS 18 Apple wind costomieation by a landslide
All of androids points are ties except for price
As a very recent discovery and subscriber just to say your output is absolutely top shelf. Thank you.  PS. I did not subscribe because of this video, but the timing could not be better, I just bought my partner a 13 pro max for her 69th birthday, she has always used android, she is a typical mature phone user, I asked her what she did not like about the android phone she had, 'photo quality' was the reply. As an iPhone user since the 4, I am delighted to bring her into the fold, and she is equally delighted with her phone. I look forward to showing her this video tomorrow, with subtitles in Spanish or Catalan  she does not speak English.  After this I am sure she will not look back, thank the fheck MKBHD voted for the iPhone for photos lol. And I for one am very happy that the Eulogy I gave to her concerning the 13 pro max is 100% supported in the discussion. All the best.
just wasted my time on a failure try to convince me that iPhones are better 😂
September 2025, we need such a video again
Years later. Phones have changed, and with them the opinions of whoever owned them. Apple still makes the same phones. Slightly different looks. They don't have an Innovation department yet. Maybe they need to work on that. Quote: “Change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end.”  Of course, this applies both ways. I've come to appreciate Android more.
i LIVE for this collab. love you both. youtube tech crushes
Well well now its 2025 and i think that Xiaomi's phone is whooping there asses in the battery category and the charging.
I think you should redo it
Whos in 2025 with android 16 and IOS 26 😂😂
Performance, yes clearly iphone is the winner. Even the ecosystem, yes true! But battery life? Camera? Display experience? Seriously? Are you for real? 😂
It's clear he's biased and bought. That ease of use argument is a lie. The fact that an iPhone does not have a back button or clear all apps button or force quit an app is proof that the android is much much much easier.
All preference. I prefer s24 ultra. It's Pretty much like .... PlayStation vs Xbox. I prefer Xbox haha
I really dislike Apple and one big reason is because of the fact that Apple is 100% locked up.   Android gives you FULL control, tweek system settings, download apps from the web, Android basically gives you a phone and you have full control.  Apple is user-friendly but locked in, stuck using the phone how Apple intended. If you just want a phone to text, call, maybe play a few games and stream stuff, Apple is your goto.   If you want to be like a developer, have root-level freedom, use third party apps and change the way your phone functions, than Android is for you.   Im 100% Android fan for now and forever.
This is bad comparison im disappointed mrwhosetheboss usually prefers android
I dont understand if apple doesnt multitask what is point in upgrade in chipset a18 to a19 and ram 6gb to 8gb 😂😂
It shouldn’t be iPhone vs Android it should be iPhone vs Samsung or any other android because android has a bunch of different types of phones like fairphone is very eco friendly like it doesn’t make sense
You should be glad Android is open source, Apple.
How does an iPhone 14 cost in China
Part 2 2025?
I wonder if the comparison will go the same in 2025 😂
This year iphone is cooked
Absolute cinema 2:05
Apple Supremacy
Why don't we repeat this now?
8:21 huh?😂
7:52 your face when you said "interesting"😂😂
What?! 7:20
Samsung guy but I like Apple to I love them both
stop the glaze vro 🥀
There is just no way that Top class android phones like S ultra series (considering the prices of iphones) averages 2.5 point vs 7.5 for iphones. You   are   just   out   of   your    mind.
This is a nonsense review. Apple sponsored
samsung all theway im sorry i like liberty
Bruh. You are comparing a phone with a operating system. You aren't comparing Android and Apple but Samsung and Apple
MKBD is a Apple guy. Waste of Time
im an iphone for my normal day to day but as an offensive security engineer i use a rooted android to break into wifi networks and even infect computers
most biased video ever
Did he just say iPhone has bigger better batteries that last? 😂
Cortana 💀
Samsung budget users went quiet with this old video
its about personal preference
how bout api apps in android
We need this video again in 2025
Just the way the questions are framed, you can tell they are framed to favour the iphone 😅
So the only points android got since the start are draw points, one's a sucker for iPhone and the other is with no opinion of his own, Arun:"I like the and-" , the black dude:"but I 'THINK' the iPhone is better" our dear Mrwhosetheboss:"ok that's a point for iPhone"....  Like whaaat ? Where is the debate, this is extremely disappointing, this was so lackluster. Pure biased opinions without any value
MKBHD has to be the biggest iPhone fan I've seen 😭
GUYS  BATTERY GOES TO IPHONE, BATTERY, BATTERY  LIKE  GUYS SERIOUSLY
I think it came to a flaw in the methodology to compare Apple to average Android.  We all know Apple places itself as premium high end (and user locking) .   So should be compared only to similar brands for an average , otherwise of course there is a lot of shit on android so everyone would go for iPhones in that regard.  While if Apple was compared to their pure nemesis on Android, , Android would win all the time since there is always a brand excelling more in each area.   So I would ask for a rematch.   PS , iPhones get lagging after only 2 years and it has been proven programmed obsolescence, so just for this, their green targets are rubbish because they would cause an entire smartphone footprint for a new phone when someone gets bothered by lags or battery.  This would make me NOT award ECO & Support points by default....
the 69% in the SAMSUNG lol
Apple fanbase logic: when android introduces a feature that apple has had for years, it’s “copying” and “proof iPhone is better”. When IOS introduces a feature that android has had for literal decades, it’s “innovation” and “upgrading”
I think its time for a 2025 update on this... seeing how apple didn't inovate much over the last couple years. could be worth looking at again
Thanks very much this video was very mind opening
Shouldve talked about the ecosystems
2025
Apple sponsor❤❤ yayyyyyyy (naaa)
Bro SOMEONE TELL ME WHY APPLE IS USING SUCH AN INFERIOR DISPLAY???
samsung takes display easy
lol android get rekt iphone better
I would disagree with you guys.. 70% iphone services are only available for American and European market..
Iphone is so much better Android is extremely laggy abd they give unwanted apps that you can't delete
This video was sponsored by Apple. Thank you
@Mrwhosetheboss, can you recreate this video in 2025
Samsung makes i phones screens
Do the same video now, after laucnhing of S25 ultra !! 😂😂
Rematch.
We need a rematch of this please😂!
They sucked Apple's ballz. Steve Jobs would be proud...
They glazed by apple
Mkbhd just feels so biased bruh wtf

3:07 It is absolutely wrong.  I am using an iPad 9th gen that comes with 3gb of RAM and Samsung Galaxy S24 FE that comes with 8gb of RAM. iPad 9th gen runs out of memory pretty easily and in games like Roblox it gets unplayable at a point due to the low amount of RAM, I get frequent low RAM warnings while playing Roblox, also when I open an app while 2 apps are running on background one gets killed. iPad OS freezes at random times, most likely due to the lack of RAM. While 8gb RAM on Samsung S24 FE hasn't caused any problems so far.
this is a very biased comparism. in cases where iphone loses, u choose to compare it with a mid range or low range android and end up giving it a draw or a win to iphone. u did that with the screen, battery, smoothness etc
@Mrwhosetheboss you truly understand smartphones compared to MKBHD he doesn't know smartphones he knows an iphone 😂
Why are we listening MKBHD am going to go and unfollow this guy I've never seen that his so dum like this😅
@MKBHD why you can't drop your apple boy fanning 😅
I have an iPhone 14 Plus and Samsung A55. I love the Apple ecosystem also I’m kind of stuck in it. I love the freedom of Samsung phones. To be honest, Samsung is just better
How about now?
I love how MKBHD is so fan of Apple, that mention as example the screen saying is nearby as good  other phone vut is more responsive. WtF Samsung and LG sell the old screens to Apple 😂, Iphone just slap me price components and just tweek them to make it "better". And charge you 6 more time the real price.
Samsung galaxy  is better iPhone are crap
Android fanboys are only good at commenting their wrong opinions and then  liking each others comments😂😂😂  MKBHD is a living legend in tech reviews...
Now you see the opinion from professionals...  iPhone is the King of smartphones
MKBHD is a legend ...he knows iPhone is the King of smartphones
Samsung s21 , its what i now use
This guy talks about Android like it's his ex; totally biased and not over it!
mkb is far better reviewer
That black guy is a IPhone lover
Yet, with iPhone leading in most categories, MKBHD uses the Samsung.
not fair   android now can emulate not just ps2 but ps3 and also windows.  this video is outdated so please update it
Android get better battery
sam won photos you biased to apple
iPhone won though
Android got cheated many times
Do this in 2025 and we know who's winner 🔥
Never make a comparison video ever again.
They are not wrong. I am experiencing those things i went from: an iPhone 12 to s23+ I'd rather have stayed and upgraded to iPhone 15.. yeh freedom i get it, but idk, man, the bugs i get the screen even do its 120hz its not that sometimes take pics, and they are different.
Can't imagine apple got a point for the screen. Just because of the fast touch response. Mk your priorities are different from what majority of consumers have.
Apple gazlers
Arron where did you get the 4 year software support from Samsung cause its 7 years ? And yes iphone its 5 year
iPhone is basically a liability
ANDROID FOR REAL LIFE 🙋 APPLE FOR ACTING LIFE🤗
ANDROID FOREVER
You guys should redo this for the iphone 17 and samsung s25
Apple displays are made by samsung😂😂😂
Android Bros finna crash out after this
Its really interesting how android phones completly overtok iphones in nearly every point during the last 3 years since the video came out.
This review should be revisited today now that we have Google Pixel 9pro, S25ultra and iPhone 16pro. I think it's unfair comparing S21ultra to the iphone 13pro max, the latter was and is still a beast of a device till today.
The reason I phone is winning in your minds is because your both betas
Your facts are off. i can go two full days without charging my phone. My girls' iPhone dies all day every day, and they are both new.
The fact that they are gaslighting each other and also everyone
It's really stupid because those of us that are Android we can't run the Apple software?
Go again with s25 and iPhone 16
Sad thing is that i get forced to stay with applr by my family and i don't want to stay with apple
Samsungs rlly caught up maybe even beating apple now
MKBHD is iSheep
Whether or not people prefer Android or iOS is personal preference.
Samsung has better battery life; faster processors, and slightly better photography and sound quality.
2 apple simps.
The best tech video all time
Wow, this review was so biased... 😮😢
At the end of this video, I was expecting to hear: "this Video was sponsored by Apple"
Android is way better
They are apple fanboy
A bit late to the party. But after watching JerryRigEverything, I've come to notice that android users, use their phone as a tool for efficiency whereas iPhone users, use their phone as an accessory for clout.  Plis Apple has been using Samsung screens for years now 😅
Android have water cooling smartphone. What is putting water cooling android smartphone in PC Category. Game Over. 🎉😂❤
Android have more options.... Like comparing universal tool to specialized tools created for specific tasks. Clear winner are android. Android....      Gaming phones with water cooling.... Leave overheating iPhone in dust, throttle problems.       Camera phones Leica, Zeiss.... Hallo  Ultra series... 😂😂  Batterien.... 20 000 mAh.  More than laptops.  Hallo?  Remember.... REMOVABLE BATTERY.  No option in Apple.   Free FM Radio..... Apple doesn't have   Do I have to continue?   Durability.... Best rugged android.   I never seen new IPhone without  50 or 100 $ protection case.   Then why would you care about design?  When you must buy 100 dollars expensive extra protection case.  1 inch thick... Making IPhone unrecognizable.   Screen....amoled is better than iPhone oled.   Headphone jack... 😂  FLARE Camera... For night vision   So, so many other options.  Operating system.   Third party apps. Legit and legit.  Free download... 😂 Free no money music.
And yes, nowadays, android wins these… yall needa do it again with the s25 and 16 pro max
This has to be sponsored
that dap up at the end was clean
I feel like this was done at a real low point for Android devices, so would love to see an update - could be totally wrong of course!
the dab at the end is GREATTTT
r u kidding me? iPhone is trash and just a joke, can't even compare...🤣🤦‍♂️
boss when he was glazing iphone lol how do u give battery to iphone
IPhone just got 120Hz and I've known android using 144Hz since the time of Noah's Ark. You still make it a tie. What a biased view.
most unexpected collab ever
This video is misleading and wrong on so many levels, starting with title, then comparing android screens to iphone like they are all the same? Wtf, stopped watching at 4th minute
I am the boss! Andriod expects the world on your phone, anti privacy does not exist in Google n Samsungs life! Bloatware, battery life and trash can are Andriods life! 🤣 Try trading in an andriod to Google n Samsung and see your upgrade path! Umm NOT!
This video is sponsored by Apple.😂
Y'all should make a 2025 version of this video
there is  no need to make an video its  just easy THE  IPHONE IS  BETTER
its crazy how fast things changes. nowadays, those categories eaten up alive by samsung, while apple left far behind 😂😂😂
Still true even in 2025
It's never Android vs iPhone, it's always Samsung vs Apple.
apple is the best but I android is more affordable so I have a samsung
Pls do this in 2024
bias?
Apple is the sponser🎉😑
They are lying about the ram on an iPhone. iPhones engaged in aggressive, garbage collection, and they will shut down your apps if you shift focus to something else for a few minutes. Is Samsung S 24 ultra does not do that.
After 14 I guess apple didn’t do anything n android just rose leaps and bounds
2 years ago I moved from Android to Apple and I would never go back to Android, the mediocre battery life, constant lagging, tons of advertising on every single app or browser, the crazy amount of malware, posting something on instagram that looked like shit (even though I had an Android flagship..S22 Ultra)
For me it doesn’t make any sense to have mediocre battery life but amazing charging speed, because in my case I can charge in my car, in my house, in my office, I almost never in a situation where I have to charge in a hurry, the only times that I cannot charge is when there’s not a place to charge at all, for example hiking in a mountain, in that situation, you definitely want a phone with a great battery life, and in this situation, the iPhone is unbeatable.
No category for GAMING?! There's a performance category, but performance isn't the thing that covers all of gaming. They could cover game selection, game optimization, features for gaming, and so much other stuff! I guess it could be a free giveaway to Android because there are Android phones like the ROG phones, but no gaming iPhone.
Aron is always 50 50 between sams and apple well mos of the times there is some times when he doesn't mention the most usable features of sams but ok but the other guy is hard die apple fan screen a tie and battery life in what terms broo💀💀💀 in smoothness apple doesn't even come close to sams in screen quality and pictures also in video yeah iPhone is better
Wow
they got paid by apple
Android sucks
Apple is garbage, thanks for watch folks.    Disclaimer: this video is paid for by Apple LLC and does not influence the opinions of those reviewing our products.   Cough....... buulshit.
Only if there was s24 ultra in this period
Nah 😭 why tf is the android phone has smart eyes where u can literally crack someone’s s head open 😭   It’s- unique- ugly- it’s just not modern nor smooth
They keep talking about the minority and they forget about  apple phone is luxury so it's for minority 😂
i see his pain in eyes. SAMSUNG TEAM
But Androids have iPhones now
in 50 years apple will be another Budweiser
Iphone glazing ceremony
at 10:00 iphone won
Snapdragon Elite made this comparison even more outdated. With each update, iPhones become more like Android and finally Apple proprietary charger greed was addressed with USB C. Rather than wait for crApple to catch up, I prefer my Android. To each, but easy choice for me.
you guys are not fair in ur judgement
glazing on another level
Android forever! :-) I couldn't see iphone is winning is 2025 against Android phones. :-)
Motorola : want a century lasting battery get it🗿
2 years after and today the tables has turned and samsung is the top flagship in every situation 🎉   Who agrees 👍
samsung vs iphone ❌ just about iphone ✅  how much does apple pay for promoting its products, guys. please tell me i will review iphone as a phone that you can use to teleport. how these tech reviewers remain biased in obvious way? i started hating those guys.
Wow....I used to think tech reviewers should suppose to be unbiased by any particular product. Thanks for letting me know to not trust anyone rather to go and try out myself 👏
it would be interesting to have this video again for the recent landscape since there's been a lot of changes already for both android and ios
Thats the reality thank you. I spend over 5 years to see android vs iphone. But i couldn't find any device that will match with iphone video quality.
need  2024 redo of this video
Apple.
Yeah but just think about all those other environmental waste you get when you don't include a charger in the box, Android takes that.
Totally an apple biased versus.... Include features, freedom, prices, .... Androids are far more than apple can think off in these aspects
Iphone is overpriced and not any better.  I'm a tech professional. I'd rather have a $400 android than $1,000+ iPhone.
2 years on and the news December 24 is iPhone is been left behind both in sales and technology .  the ban on China's Huawei since 2019 it started grim to become a force units self to china making there own chips and not having to rely on American or south  Korean chips or where ever there chips are made . In 24 iPhone sales have gone down considerably. And definitely been paid by apply for this video 🤭😂🤣
How much is apple paying ye guys
Comparing a phone with an operating system? that's werid. It should be more like IOS vs One UI or iPhone 16 vs S24 Ultra
The same mkbhd said pixel has the best camera for photography (point and shoot) that year
I think IOS Vs ANDROID varies from place to place, like in Pakistan 80% of iOS features are not available, here android win but if i goes anywhere else in the world i should bring my iphone.AND i think that’s the main case.
The phone isn't the problem, it's the community. I have a Galaxy Samsung and every stupid iPhone kid I know is always blabbering about "Omg you're poor!" when in reality, they both cost nearly the exact same.
Ios security is better..samsaung knox security 💩
This guys don't use  phones, they don't even know about phones. They just make a show. Any body that could pick an iPhone 16 over a Samsung 24 do not use the phone. And he made it clear when he talked about not using the multitasking. Samsung has so much features that are useful for a person who really works with the phone, and am not talking about the camera because both of them are just good.
Whos here when mkbhd dove 96 mph on a school zone
Men buy iphone  Women buy android  Because only women do lot of customisations.
they should do this again with the apple intelligence
I love both of you Guys bro and   the black American is saying the truth bro
"The samsung is a different class" "That sounds like a draw to me" 0.5 each  Cool
NOKIA ON TOP!
IPHONE YEAH
The big unfair problem is that when you say Android you mean more than 50 different companies that have their own researchers while Apple is 1 company. Honestly, the iPhone takes that one big.
my takeaway is if you don't want to research anything an iphone is a safe bet that will handle most things you might encounter at a decent degree.  And if there is anything super important to you, and you want the best product at doing that thing, there is probably an android phone out there that does THAT THING better than any iphone you could buy.......
F it android’s are better and I am currently using an iPhone and it sucks
iphone is the worst brand on the market. Lacks so many features that Samsung or Huawei phone have. Never buy it is a waste of money.
Love the video man
Now this is the ultimate crossover
Iphone can never beat out an android for me for 2 reasons. Torque app for interfacing with my car, and emulators for the superior gaming experience. Old school Pokemon > all other games. And most games are p2w garbage.
Wow this is one of the most biased tech videos I have ever seen. I'm shocked to see this from MKBHD, not so surprised to see it from you though. Android is objectively better in almost every single one of these categories... Samsung displays look and feel MUCH better than iPhone. Samsung batteries last SIGNIFICANTLY longer. Android is WAY more smooth and customizable than iOS. Samsung camera are WAY sharper and less processed than iPhone. You're going to call Apple "Eco conscious"??? Are you out of your mind? Hahahaha Android phones can use multiple different assistants and Siri doesn't even work anymore! lol
android got CLAPPED 👏👏👏 on this one boyz
Samsung has better gaming performance more Hertz A better battery  Screen/surface  Software  Cable type USB C Spilt screen I can do my assignments  More Camera pixels Android has differences variety of phones  Security I've been hacked on Apple my iPad specifically multiple times  Etc
I confirm the bias to iphone when both Marques and Arun shared points for performance and software features. You both literally release regular videos praising android devices for their feature-full devices and software.
mkbhd is the biggest apple meatrider ever
Not a video worth watching tbh .
My iphone 6s is still good till this day and just replaced the battery once and it never lags, but my s23ultra after 1year and 7months it lags so much.
Can you remake this now at 2024? xD
Whatching this on nothing 2a Sry apple i won
Pov when the youtuber isnt some pubg or free fire rooter and big android fan and is being true
This is the duo we neededd
Cry android kidos😂
Linus should've been here as Android user, or ex-user
so two iSheeps are going to compare Android & iPhone 😂
This was the longest time apple commercial ever  😮
In Battery 🔋 Apple is the only loser and surprisely apple won in their video 👏 congratulations 🥹
Lol. Phones today.  Phones have moved so far away from what they were supposed to do. NO ONE ever talks about a phones ability to make calls, not drop a signal or true nation wide coverage.  Making calls is probably less than 15% of what ppl use a phone for today.  I remember when Sprint was great because calls were free after 7pm when other phones were free after 9, or you could make free calls to 5 of your favorite numbers.
Apple is just better y’all
Android wins for charging because iPhone 15 pro max charges at 18 W quick charge my dad's phone charges at 120W mega charge
Tech YouTuber universe
I hav been a loyal to apple 7years , but disappointed with their phones, in the field they look like a big soldier, but on the battle field theyvl don't last longer, my iPhones all spoiled or have some issues along the years, but I bought and real me 5 years ago it's is still good till today, it's a wake up call for me, I opted for Android phones after dumped my iphone, I am happy it's not about what you hold In your hands, but it's is how you safe money for your medical or in future use. If you have money keep quite and find ways to invest but personally don't buy apple. Yeah I know you all won't listen to me. But any way I am happy.
iPhone 👍 Android 👎
Obviously, to Apple fanboys, everything you said was brilliant about the iPhone, Android has been doing it for years, one example is airdrop. Android has been able to do the same action for many years. If you know you know
I feel like there were a lot of moments where they went "yeah it's pretty much equal, we'll give it to the iphone"
i want an update to this vid ngl want to know how they stand now
android is better
Android is just better in my opinion
You could fill an ocean with tears of fandroids in this comment section
It is slower. For everyday use and gaming look up the facts not the specs. Watch a timed Video. The camara is as good as droid from 2015. LOL x5 zoom lol
Fauwtoes
This comment section is gold! Fandroids are crybabies 😂
& than they both kissed wach other passionately & went home
Do this same video now And i bet the result will be totally opposite 😂
I hope you guys collab again.
You are crazy if you saying apple has a better battery or camera then android.... you're just an iphone love and seem to hate andriod blocked and unfollwed your stuff is not real
Yeah
They are both better at doing different things, no type of phone wins in all categories. Whichever categories mean more to you will determine which phone is "better" for you.
ANDROID HAS BETTER BATTERY I'm an apple user btw
I want blackberry back 😢
I use an old iPhone because my android was way too big and gave me hand cramps. I now have an iPhone 7
Kinda interesting to see same video, but in 2024, really interesting😊
There’s one more thing, you can’t say iPhone’s overall good in cameras, battery & performance etc, it’s the pro models which are best in these three departments. Non-pro iPhones are basically not that great, their battery backup is average, also the battery health drops very quickly which results into significant drop in battery backup/SOT. Talking about the cameras, and ‘photos’ specifically- Samsung is far better but yeah have to say that no one is even close to iPhone in terms of video quality even if it’s a non pro model. And performance is generally good in non pro models but trust me they do heat a lot. And one more downside is they have a lower refresh rate (60hz).
2 years laters see how the tables have turned
i want the new comparission now , im so sure the tables have turned
Asus Rog phone 8 pro>>>>>>>>all iphones
Lewis Timothy Williams Melissa Allen Richard
Scoreboard is too bias, not based on real specs, the iphone had an advantage from the start from a iphone worshipper.
Sadly a dislike apple commercial not needed 😢
iPhone paid them
Second comment: I honestly think this topic is really only matter for which one to buy / budget. Otherwise the argument is on whole new level. I don't want to choose android nor iphone . F.
I came back again on 3rd time and my first comment I think. Well I think this video is kind of more Iphone biased because Android does have problems vs iphone mention in video but it's not 100% clear to as why . And some points can just be divided into what is personal opinion vs true fact. I agree ios ram is big , I have 2Gb on my ipad and still multitask but it suffers deeply when you play games on it . Iphones ram is also nice but at the end of the days it's only for optimized apps. In macos is much harder to do that , ( but that's not for this topic ). Also budget comes into play , I always think about iphone before buying a new android and I don't know what's best . Personally if you ask me , my  brain will freeze for which is ultimate best. It's really crazy how apple can handle games . Makes you question their sanity when they make macbooks not do the same .. cause they have strong potentials. But I have a samsung a10 and just bought a new phone , one plus. Kind of not used it much so I can't say , But I'm sure I'd be happy with that. I don't even use much phone and yet I spend so much money on it . Right now I have less money that if I keep watching youtube vids like this, I'll regret not spending my free time on things I really like.
6:03 i would use the newest xiaomi phone
Im loyal to Samsung S series
Android > IOS also samsung is better than iphone.
サムスン
Best tech ytber + best tech ytber= greatest tech YouTuber! ✅
it's strange but it feels rigged in apples favor. i'm not saying it is but just feels like it was per-rehersed on how to make apple seem the best. there taking into account all android vs apple why not take the last 2 iphones and compare to the last two samsungs. but i've always found MWTB to always side with apple.
Did anyone see the pride flag wallpaper
IPhone user having another iPhone user review devices. Can we get an unbiased review please.
This wasn't fair and they forgot a lot of points about android.
What I’m surprised by is there doesn’t seem to be any phone that is targeted towards music lovers - lossless audio, professional grade speakers, audio ports, audio customisation in settings, etc. Because we have phones that are targeted towards photographers and phones targeted towards gamers, but as far as I’m aware, there aren’t any phones that are targeted towards music lovers and audiophiles.
We want another one And you're meeting on the launch of iPhone 16 s ..  Plz 😢😢😢
Just the fact that an unquestionable advantage of Android over Apple in the form of customizability was made out to be a draw tells me everything I need to know about how biased this video is
what did they do to mkbhd? ...... they ruined this guy .  now mr whosetheboss now wants to be th iphone guy
My iphone does not have a great battery and its a pro max lol, I swear they do that intentionally over a year
Can we have this episode in 2024.
aren't iphone's baterries shit. It dropps down really fast and it charges slower than most of android
You are stuck with apples app store. That is why you can say all you want about performance when you are stuck in an environment that is completely closed. It is like saying oh we are the greatest doing what we tell you. What you can do. Finally you can make it your own after how many revisions of IOS.  Google assistant beats Siri all day every day. Now that they are trying to go with chatgpt mod. Showing how far behind apple is.  The S22 ultra has not failed me. I have had people want my videos from S22 Ultra. The sound was cleaner than all the Iphones. It was a friends proposal, everyone else had shaky cam and unclear audio. By the way i was in the back of the crowd.
I don't know if this video should be updated or not. But this is intreaguing
2 boys 1 apple 🍎 🤮. These two have spent a lifetime boasting apple products.
You ve lost me at the screen. Not even bothering😅
Team iPhone 📱
The shape of the phone doesn't really matter because you usually have a case on it.
Amazing how much samsung has turned this over recently, as it does beat every iPhone on Antutu now and the camera has jumped ahead
Apple wins, but I still prefer Android because *RedMagic 9s Pro* 🗿
Please make such a video again after the iPhone 16 comes out, it was really enjoyable, Thanks
Love your content, but this was - and I say it as an iPhone-user - biased and really doesn’t reach your standards.
Android 0 iphone 10 bc android trash and iphone best

Totally Unbiased, Marquez and Eren 😂
Not only do iphone recycle materials but also features
COME ON AM I THE ONLY CHEAP DUDE? MY PHONE IS 5 YEARS OLD!!
More prefer android
this is biased. THE APPLE PHONE LOSEES BATTERY MORE THAN SAMSUNG!
6:55 when I pick a phone I don’t really care about the camera because I don’t really use it 😂
So common sense if you use your phone to make money its I phone but if it's a secondary thing it's android
I switched from android to iOS, I personally became tired of Android not suiting my needs. Don’t get me wrong I still have respect for Android but I would never go back to it.
I switched from android to iOS, I personally became tired of android, and also because I got a family members old iPad. I still have respect for android though.
Your saying a 3300mah battery is better than 5000mah? And the 5000mah has faster charging lmfao
So Apple sponsored this video, eh?
Oof, apple bias at it finest
Not talking about pixels
Android is better as it get connected with windows laptop. However appled eco system doesn't support windows laptop.
I have both, i just can’t use one, cz both have its own advantages. But functionally i use android most pf the time, but there are some on the iphone that u can’t replace
Who wins 🗿
apple users will never understand that android is better ( it is )
Why don't y'all do an actual battery test and see which phone last longest? All my friends iPhones are always dead while I charge my Samsung in the evening and don't charge it until the next evening. It survives gps all day youtube tiktock apps for work pictures camera and usually has plenty to waste
even though apple won, I will forever be a devoted android supporter
U guys are liars ahbeg
Battery win I phone . The nost shocking thing of my life 😂
This is bad
Yooo  iOS 18 is out, 16 would be out in months  You guess should do this again 😅
shshzain likes Samsung and is racist. The city school gulshan campus B Pakistan Karachi class 5 usman is his friend and Sadia his mom
Them be like: Let's forget about file sharing and everything else 💀💀
Bro is paid by Apple 😂
Android fanboys crying as usual and accusing them of lying because they disagree with them classic
amount of crying android babies 🤣 btw this was not a fair comparison😆
Just here for the comments 😂🍿
IPhone has airdrop and Android has easyshare
Appe gay bro 😂
Theres 1 real reason ehy people buying and disliking android they say samsungs are so slow the samsung they are talking about is samsung s2 mini and people buying apple just because high protection to viruses or stolen phone etc. thats your opinion of buying samsung or apple and samsung is better than any phone
SAMSUNG IS BETTER
Left dude is talking out his arse
He’s talking soooo much shit saying the android camera is better lmao. I have only had iPhones and the cameras are shit.
Mkhbd always paid by apple lol😂 apple never ever can beat samsung thats it
do a price point comparison . take an android phone that cost the same as the apple one and compare it
Battery score to I-phone? I even doubting looking the full video. Is this sponserd by I-phone or something? 😒 Ok, i tried to look further but i stopped a little over half way. I had both phones and these easy points to I-phone are not in reality 😜🤣🤣
Everything exepct battery goes to Android,beacuse battery thing is unknown BC there are phones with like 6000MaH battery
Why dont we do top teir iphone vs top teir android like one of the rog phones ? Its absolutely who wins that.
just look into this; but.... apple does not have REAL software updates, iphones with latest updates mostly the same as they were at the release. android users even with shorter updates circle are getting more features and until end of support - new and old HW has same features (in most cases). also - iPhone normally much more laggy :)
2 apple nerds
Your right
Emulation wins it for me. Being able to play older games just with your phone is a dealbreaker.
1. You rank unnecessery stuff as much as really important stuff 2. Only one guy is really saying what wins. 3. You rank iPhone better, but have an Android, huh? 4. You have like 2-3 software things (software is as much as important as hardware in my opinion) 5. Apple locks you in a jail, you cant get out of.  Android clear winner in my opinion
Team apple
I disagree >:<
He was much biased with apple 😅
Both guys make Quality videos, but you're biased towards Apple. It's bevome harder to watch your reviews, because of the said reason. Do better.
Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is the best phone and Samsung can fold their phones.Thats real you can research:what is the best phone.
Three words: three button navigation
Im literally thinking that apple payed them to make them look good, there are so many categories given to it without even consideration. For example, perfomance, how in the world does the iphone win the perfomance category? It showed us 1 benchmark which is a cpu benchmark which is iphone's strong part, ill take that as a coincidence but its suspicious and then gave the point to the iphone, if you pull up a benchmark like antutu which tests the phone overall both cpu and gpu the android is a clear winner and if you do the vulkan test on the same benchmark they did the cpu test on(geekbench) the android is gonna destroy the iphone. The display should be given to the androids as well, same quality display but brighter and more responsive on specific phones and also androids had 120 and even 144 and 165hz for centuries now so android wins this. The eco friendly category is useless since only 0,1% of people only care how eco friendly their phone is but still android wins this. The fact that you can get a more eco friendly android phone should automatically give it the point because someone who cares about the environment would sacrifice some performance for more eco friendliness. Battery should be either a draw or android because it depends which phones you compare. Technically rog phones which have insane battery are considered flagships but so are Samsungs, Xiaomi and many other phones so in that case some beat the iphone some lose to the iphone. Camera specifically photography since I haven't tested the videos on iphones I can't speak for that should again be given to android, they said themselves that android takes better photos and they do, this category is how good the camera is on the phones, if a phone has a better camera then it has a better camera, you can't really say it's worse just because some apps don't make full use of it because that's the app's problem not the phone's. Software features is 100% on Android, android has so many features and many of them are useful too that give the point to androids, all iphone's features which aren't even a lot can all be replicated through apps like isn't iMessage just a messaging app and facetime just a video call app? There are thousands of ways you can message and call someone which makes these useless. Assistant also goes to android, there is no doubt that Google assistant is way more advanced than siri so I'm not gonna explain this at all. Software support at the time this video got published then yes, I would agree that it goes to the apple but now samsung offers 7 years of software support which clearly makes android the winner.
I has subscribed to this channel till i saw this useless comparison, very biased 😢. I had to unsubscribe immediately
That was a wonderful and honest comparison between Apple and Android! I love the way you guys mentioned every tiny detail in order to make the comparison as fair as possible! Thanks a lot.
my ex husband aaron shea  has access to my android phone gmail account samgsung account my internet my passwords and has totally hacked all he has a A14 5F i have A14 and going to call the police tomorrow,i really need to post this
Bruh 1 vs 7 points  Very very fair video
No disrespects here! But the discussion here clearly shows the difference between a trained engineer and a person who is not an engineer. 😊
I feel as an iPhone user that android should have gotten at least the photo point, android is objectively better but I still like apple because of what’s better for me I think arguments on which is better in comment sections are useless your not going to convince anyone to switch phones. There also phones so who actually cares what other people use and about other companies when you like your phone.  Sorry if this is confusing.
There is a lot of cope in the comments lol
Those phones were not happy to be put close to each other😂
do this again pls
Honestly I think android is better,  I really think in terms of battery reliability android is just better cause, where I live we haven't had electricity for 3 days, so I haven't charged my phone in that time but right now it's at 54% and my screen use time for today was 9 hrs 22 minutes, I still haven't charged it yet, cause I was playing call of duty mobile squad online and I don't plan on charging it any time soon, guess what phone I'm using
I think android is better 😊
8:20 most boring team to watch is often the best one 😅 He was definitely talking about Man city  Boring as hell
-3:33
apple glazers
Android feels like windows on a phone but better suited for a phone because of the files app and ability to install a setup/app.. iOS is like every app deals with its own storage and you have to get everything from the i store in a perfect world the I phone would have a normal files app and everything would be ccol
I wish people would have mentioned the lack of volume controls on iPhone before I switched from Android.  Everyone that I mention this too has no idea what I’m even referring to and it’s infuriating to me.  How ya’ll not know?  iPhone has only one volume slider that controls everything on the phone unless you are playing media or in a phone call.  Why does this matter?  iPhones one slider controls Siri and Alarms.  So when I am listening to music at a comfortable volume and I have this one slider maxed out so I can hear my alarm in the morning and someone updates their story Siri will scream at you even though your media volume is at a comfortable volume and the headphone safety setting turned on.  It’s such a pain in the a$$!  I cannot stand it!  I’m considering switching back to Android but have already invested in the iPhone ecosystem before I discovered this issue I have with iPhone.  Only fix I have found was to disable EVERY Siri feature on the iPhone.  I NEVER use it for anything anymore.  I used the assistant everyday on Android and it worked flawlessly.
Its not even a debate, i thought tuere would be a back and forth.
This is so biased😵
all lies man , android basically beats ios in everything
how is the display 50/50
Summary of the comments and replies: *_this video was sponsored by , android is better_*  Y’all remember, fighting over phones is cringe and it gives u skill issue and u won’t succeed in life 🗿
I know this is an older video, but you and Marques should get together once a year with the newest handsets and see if score changes from year to year
Apple marketing 😂😂😂
android fans crying and punching pillows right now
Yup! Im done with these two sell outs. Not gona keep watching you dishing out paid reviews.
I got rid of my 12pro bcz of bad battery life while my 10 year old android phone does better in battery
The title should’ve been Samsung vs diphone…. Only samsung can reach upto this level
What u saying, Samsung battery hold longer and charge faster but still aple wins coz u dont mind plug it in every 5 min ? xd
Mrwhosetheboss: Samsung phone has 10 things better about it then iPhone. IPhone has 1 thing better than Samsung Hmm this is tough decision, but I think iPhone wins this round.  Bruuuuuuuhhhh…..
With new update ios 18.. this video need a update...
What game was being played cause I ain’t never seen that on my Apple store
my XR has 25-50x zoom how come no one knows this iphone feature much?
The winner lies in ur pocket.Average user just relax..u know what is best for u
I believe that the best phone for someone is the one you are used to. For example I like the Iphone, but I'm used to an android.  My son has an iPad, ill take a galaxy any day of the week
Asking an American Tech person regarding Apple products feels like unconscious bias can't be eliminated, as Apple is so permeated within their culture. No disrespect to Marcus, of course. Love his videos.😊
S23 ultra...smh at this comparison...proprietary gear sucks always and forever for multiple reasons, and I'll not voluntarily subject myself to that if at all possible
Man I tell you, of all the collabs on YouTube this one was by far the most enjoyable to watch. I wish you guys did more stuff together.
Funny how MKBHD has had multiple blind still photo competitions on his channel where Android was picked as the winner but still he says iPhone
To me, it's clearly become Android. Not because of any great super cool features, but little ones. Seperate folders for downloads, photos, screenshots. A customizable keyboard. Seperate volume controls. Little stuff that's super handy and still Apple just doesn't manage to get them finally into iOS
A phone is a phone. its all about the price...
So I kind of modify result on my end. Anywhere they give them a tie, I give the score to Android.
Apple comercial of 20  min 😡😤
iPhone is better ? NO  😑 bye
Then came the S24 Ultra
Hi this is Apple, check is in the mail.
Someone is Biased
giving battery category to iphone is nuts
Ngl this feels biased as hell😂 I think they just favor IPhone better
I would pick Android in my preference because or productivity and gaming and photography eg: Samsung
Well, now we iPhone 15 with usb-c sooo, iPhone wins by even more
This video is so badly made I’m surprised
You use the phone, one year old, crazy 😅 while I'm watching this on my 4 year old one 😬
Android phone does not take away as much rights as Apple ... No Sideloading.. Its like apple owns even though you've bought it.
Added categories...durability and customer support
Marquess had been so careful with his words so he doesn't offend any Android users. 😂
I want to see this discussion with s24 ultra and 15 pro max
Can I plz get a phone I am looking for new phone but I can not afford it plzzz
Statistically it’s probably android, but the world isn’t driven purely by feature sets and numbers.
I have created a video comparing android phone and iphones. Y'all should check it out
If You bought an Android Device as expensive as Apple, It will ofc doesn't have a lag and the Cheaper Options are Original Brand.  but If you bought an Iphone as Cheap as an Android, Expect that it is a FAKE Phone Only the Expensive are the Originals. PERIOD.
Apple payed bro real good after this one 😹🙏
The ammount of Android Fanboys not being able to admit that another company has the capability of making a better phone is just sad
You lost me on the battery category
one brand versus all android brands
at battery and screen category, you views aren't correct, it disappointment for real. thought you two could make great content together but it's turn out boring video i've ever see from y'all😌☹😠😖😖
Damn how times have changed. Samsung/android cameras have improved but the Iphone video quality is prob still better but it depends. And I've seen multiple vids saying that the S24 ultra is better than the Iphone 15 pro max.
It was then 💀💀
Me watching this video with my s 24 ultra 😎💀😂
This is what King George the 3rd was trying to prevent from happening
Mkbhd judt contradicted everything he said in this video during his s24 ultra review. Guess android finally won him over.
E
Can you make a video for how to make older, dumber phones faster and more efficient? Please! 😭
I have to disagree with the eco conscious part because Apple say that they are for eco by 2030 but on tiktok there was a video that Tim Apple admitted that it was by 2055 but came out and lied. Don't take my word for it though. It's your choice😃
This is the video I always wanted to watch.😁
Eco means also that you stey with your product a bit longer.  As I am android user, I noticed that medium priced android phone  hardware "getting older" faster then IPhone one- so, in theory, this second kind of phone should last longer.  But when You look on mindset iPhone users (newer- better-I have to buy it) it seems that is not the case.  But what with components? iPhone has more unified parts (fewer models,some parts are common), and when you have to produce less components for different phones, it is better for environment. So many factors to look at, and not to much time to do it (and lack of knowledge 😂)in this video
Phones are made by Samsung
this guy is possessed by Apple,completely 😂😂 and was pretty good paid by apple too
When it comes to eco-consciousness, you guys completely missed the elephant in the room.  That elephant's name is Planned Obsolescence.  Apple designs their products to be obsolete within a period of time so users are required to get a new device.  That is not eco-friendly...I don't care how many solar panels that Apple has on their headquarters. And what about storage space as a matter of eco-consciousness?  With virtually every Android, you can pop in a microSD card and have plenty of storage for years.  However with an iPhone, you are limited to how much storage they put in the device.  Once the storage is full, it's time to upgrade your device.  Yes, there is the cloud...but both phones offer cloud services so you can't argue that "you get more storage if you use the cloud with your iPhone."  If you're out of mobile data or in  a coverage dead spot and don't have access to wifi, good luck using your cloud storage.
Literaly the only thing on my phone has to work and Phonig itself is the clock, so my xiaomi note 12 is more than enough for me.
If you want to own the phone you bought -- Android, of course.
Team android ❤❤
What about APK files? Because one of the reasons why I'm still using an android phone (OPPO A54 5G) is because I use one apk app called aniyomi for me to watch anime. Is it worth me to switch and not use that app and just use other things for anime like animension or netflix even Disney+
lol🤣This video is more about apple and less about android, its so obvious where android is actually winning they just do tie or just saying there is no winner here XD
I think xperia 1vi can beat i phone and Samsung in any aspect especially in efficiency
It's more like "iPhone 13 pro max vs S22 Ultra".  If it was iPhone vs Android, then you would have picked the best android has to offer (in every category), sounds unfair right?
Iphone is better but only for Americans. For rest of the world Android will always be ahead.
Right when the vid started I got one of the android and iPhone skit adds
marquees is an android fan boy but doesn't mind talkking against the BS sometimes Google does
Apple is better icl
Marque's thinking is just unmatched sometimes. You feel "oh this is a new way of thinking". Very good video.
Giving the screen award to iPhone feels like a crime
This is by far the most popular biased vdeo on this take that i have seen so far. I am saying this because, MKBHD did a good job in putting out his points supporting iphone but the problem was it was very heavily based on his very personal incidences, experiences and preferrance, and not the "AVERAGE" scale that was mentioned so much thruout this vdeo. Also, there were many categories that android could have easily won in but werent added as a parameters, and with that i mean they were worth mentioning also. Another point was how arun was just agreeing to his points tho it felt like he himself didn't agree to him much but just let it be. It just felt like an iphone fanboy making a vdeo trying to be not bias yet coming out biased. But yeah i am not hating tho, i m not hating on MKBHD or anything, just stating my opinions😊
Seeing you two guys in the same video is Amazing 😊
This was basically an apple funboys video with zero objectivity. 😅
These guys should do more together!
The draws...........  Bizarre
Iphone hands down, I have owned both and currently own a Samsung S23 Ultra which I absolutely hate and can't wait to get rid of, my wife feels the same way about hers as well especially after getting a virus from an app which made her have to wipe her phone and start all over from scratch recently. Iphone isn't perfect but its far better then Android!!!
Gghkmhhj
That dap is crispy
Me for iphone then android am  pocus the battery health for 1hr per movie also the game latest for if the iphone are probably are is only on the same facts is guarantees is using 8hrs solving version android or it' is a refurbished unit problem
android forever
There is no world in which Android scores 2.5 and iPhone scores 7.5. This is borderline misinformation
This is the best collab ever 🔥
If you don't live in west, iphone is not that essential.
samsung is best
As they gave iphone point for battery, I'm never gonna treat their opinion seriously from this point
20:23 The End
Finally Truth Spoken
The 1 thing I do like about an iPhone is it's Smoothness, Samsung has caught Up!! in that erea It's All Subjective mostly!!!!!! IPhones aren't the Best phones on the Planet or its use ability.
I think you were really digging in the bottom of the barrel on the iphone to compare it to the android. The points iphone won, android had better features, but you used your personal "I don't use that feature" excuse to give the iphone the leg up. I think this was a very biased review with a clear preference for the iphone, but even then I still heard android being better in this "debate" that was clearly trying very hard to give iphone the advantage. I've owned both, and always go back to android. Always end up disappointed with iphones.
i just watched these two respected reviewers straight up say iphone has better overall battery experience over android?
The problem with android is that there are so many different manufacturers and different class of devices which deliver different experiences.  These last 2 years I've tried different manufacturers. With the pixel 6a i had a pretty bad experience as it overheated way too fast. Still i had my mom get a pixel 8 because they fixed the problem and she just want a good camera without using any settings appart from the flashlight.  The nothing phone 2 has way too many software issues to recommend to anyone imo.  Nokia devices are either cheap and slow or too expensive for what you get.  Samsung devices are bad if you get a low or mid end device as the skin is too heavy for them. if you get a high end device it's a good experience for most. Even though the fold 4 I've tried even has stutters when using the big screen (maybe they'll fix it with software updates)  In my experience Sony devices have the least bugs and app issues but the camera experience is problematic for most as it looks too advanced. I've seen the 1 v makes pretty good pictures in basic and auto mode but the 1 iii didn't had a great auto mode in darker scenes. Also for some the 2 year software updates and 3 year security updates might not be enough.  I'll get a Sony device this year again as a main device but as my second I'll most likely try the next htc (u24?)
Android is not about the cellphone, it's about Google. The more you use it, the better it knows you and assist you, and becomes more and more efficient, literally like an android to your service. That's the reason he never uses Siri. And now that Microsoft edge and copilot are integrated with crhome, the experience is even more powerful .
The greatest colab doesn't exi-
biased opinion of a apple fanboy
how much did they pay you marques
this is sponsored by apple you didnt test anything
In 2024 I am wondering if you can collaborate again with MKBHD and talk more about the new AI features coming to the newer models of APPLE and SAMSUNG please collaborate again and i would love to hear what you both think about AI being integrated onto the smartphones.+Mrwhosetheboss
Please help mi with a phone Please 🙏 😢
both have to switch phones and shirt
Like this cooment if Samsung is better
I like Sony samsung vivo xuoami and google pixle but iphone oogh noo not you know the screen resulusion is 2m by 5m pixels on my samsung s21 ultra and my brothers iphone 11 Pro is 980.000 by 600.900 reselusion and my s pen dont Costa money bboooooooom got you❤❤❤❤
Finger prints are definitely more secure than face unlock but will they bring back voice unlock? Iris eye unlock is complex fingerprint is easier but for those quick interactions... Can we get voice support?
iPhone all day everyday
I trust both of these guys’ opinions, but this seems very “apple paid for this”. Yes I’m an android fanboy, but I use an 11 pro max 😂
big no the battery for iphone its a shit guys. it cant bit andriod, okay guys am i real here ?
No Thanks never Apple iPhone again never. After 2 years every iPhone is something wrong with and Apple wont help you to fix old phones they want you yo buy new thats why those update program is to f*** up your phone after sometimes dont ever buy a Apple iPhone product
iphone is way better looks  better, more secure, and reliable
iPhone is overpriced crap
Actually android has something way better than air drop And I rarely used FaceTime with my iPhone because I used video chat on other platforms instead. So therefore android has everything iPhone has but with alternatives.
Bro on the left is bias it is so clear
Display should Go to Android Apple is literaly using Samsungs Display
A collab we never knew we needed!
I will always go for Android over apple Because they make much, much more apps for Android than for Apple. Aspecially on the secret website
Actually with being eco-friendly most android phone manufacturers are more eco-friendly. Because the charger is already part of it so you don't need to have packaging that goes in the trash or gas that's spent delivering the items.
Apple fanboi and also Apple fanboi : Giving opinions on Apple vs Android or Samsung. Okay checked ✅
I've got to try out a new iphone because I've always been an android guy
iPhone is just a company while android phones are made by different manufacturers and for the competition to be same then it should be Samsung vs iPhone
yeah android is much better, but iphone vibrates a bit harder
iPhone forces the consumer to purchase over time after 1 to 2 year of having the phone. Do to software technicality
Don’t have to wait a week, a month or more to reset account and or anything. iPhone 👎
Androids are easier to use, better battery life, can multitask better. Android is the superior small computer phone
iPhones are terrible
Wow. MKBHD is in your video.
Just say you're an apple fanboy. Just trying to find any weak reason to give the point to apple
iPhone 15 gang ->
How much apple just paid you guys ? Or did you sleep with Steve Jobs or something?
Video Title - Weirdly Giving All Points To iphone But Using Android Comparison
you should be doing these type of videos with persons that are not fans of a brand like this guy is obviously his the hugest fan apple
This video seems heavily biased since both seem to prefer iPhones.  Features should DEFINITELY be a win for android. There's so many things that android can do that iPhones can't and likely won't ever do because of the stupid closed ecosystem.
Ios is better
As an Avid Galaxy/ Iphone user. I keep both on me at all times and can say these 2 dont know what there talking about
Man... Screen, batery, Siri, Widgets, even the camera isn't anymore
Battery life iPhone wins is crazy 💀
Is it me or are we just splitting hairs comparing Android and iPhone ?
Im split between both. I still love Iphone for it's simplicity and for apps to just work.  But Android has sooooo much utility and their voice assistant is far better.   I got a Samsung after a decade of iPhone - I both love the amount of functionality but also it got me overwhelmed with all the switches and amount of customization there is. I can say I can do more while having my workflow slowed down because I need to go through 15 menus to find that one button/ I need to spend hours to organize, design, customize a phone that works for me.  With IPhone, say what you will, the uniformity makes finding that one switch easier.
Same kind of video in 2024 would be great, cause I think the smartphone market has changed significantly. Everyone is trying to make their phone as much polished as possible.
make tablet and HP videos
there is no way iphone trash android like liverpool did to united ,....no way
The biggest mistake is asking a blind IOS guy "which is better IOS or Android?"😂
Apple. If your phone can’t even run for 5-6 years (androids), you already lost
Samsung won assistant and they didn’t even add a point, this is so rigged.
Android Vs IOS ❌️ Samsung Vs Apple✅️
Dude favors IPhone😂😂😂
13:52 what I’ve noticed tho is that the reverse wireless power sharing on Samsungs flagships, is a really nice feature. Like before I had the iPhone 15 pro max with the amazing battery. I had an iPhone XS Max. I could charge my iPhone with my galaxy s22 Ultra
agreed with most of the points but not environmental impact due to apple's constant anti right to repair moves. reducing waste and reusing older phones are much better for the planet than forcing your users to buy a new phone because they broke their screen or their camera or their touch ID sensor and were artifically software locked out of features. yes samsung does this as well but in the grand scheme of android phones it's easier and cheaper to repaie them.
I'm going to admitly disagree with this video when it comes to camera features. Well, I disagree with others things as well, but I won't get into those.  I have a friend group, and we do several activities together.  There's 14 of us, and I'm the only one with an android, S22 Ultra.  I've had a Samsung for years, I started with the first Note and haven't looked back.  Anyway, our group goes hiking, bike riding, camping, dinners, concerts, etc.  For years, I have been the go-to for pictures and videos. Side by side, my pictures and videos are the ones that are always picked to share.  If a picture is shared that wasn't from me, it's because I wasn't there. On this point, you are dead wrong.
I feel like there need to be 3 people here. IPhone, Android and the person asking the question. Right here you just have the person asking the question and a IPhone head
heavily biased bruh
hii
MWTB was confused as hell about the end conclusions but since it was sponsored its okay😂😂😂😂
Ummmmm this guy's 😂mind is colonised by Apple
Samsung s24 is the winner
i dont know about samsung but my iPhone's battery works just fine 😊😊
this is a fight between a biased mind and an unbiased one,
Three lenses is already overkill, wth is going on with that Android!?
He said before that he prefer google fixal 4 for photos
this is coal
Samsung takes the cake for me. Fuck iphone.
My two favorites black people
The true answer is Walkie-Talkie
I swear the PlayStation is like Apple iPhone, and Xbox is the android phone
this is way too biased
Only thing i got against both is Samsung has a back button of you way in a app you can it back iPhone rashes you back to the home page and the other thing is its 2024 not 1992 you can't send videos to either phone to make it perfect and no I'm not going download a app or sat by someone to send a video
Samsung❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I can give you a lot of reasons why samsung is better..... camara 200MP 8k , bigger battery, fast charging, faster, best screen, pen & freedom when it comes to you homes screen......etc🫡
Apple fan alerts ⚠️ come man be honest 😅😂  just accept it already... we are in 2024 samsung is way ahead of iPhone💯
Samsung way ahead of iPhone shouldn't even be comparing with iphone tbh 💯🔥 I was an apple fan but come on guys let's be honest already..... 🤔😅 Samsung 200MP 8k vs iPhone 48mp 4k..😂😂
Fake ...nonsense
Die hard android fan boys are so salty about Apple products 😭🤦🏻‍♂️
Tbh if you have fast charging your battery will degrade very fast and Apple will only change it until the capacity is big enough
Comparing all android phones with a single iPhone 😂
Both of you are apple guy. So I really don't think you would make the Android win even though we all know Android OS has easier, shorter and consistent ways to get things done. Like going to settings or a particular setting, going to previous page or going back etc. Renaming media, one app on top of other both running simultaneously on the display as pop ups, splits etc. numberpad on top of the key pad so you don't have to always change to numbers everytime you have to type a number. Things like these make Android much much more convenient.  Also speaking of ram, how come you both didn't know iPhone stops video uploads when you come out of the app, it doesn't happen in the background. That's how iPhone needs less ram, by not doing things convenient for users. You have to stay on that app until the upload is done on iPhone, while you can use other things while it upload in the background on Androids. How convenient is that.
_unfortunately, you guys don’t review these phones specifically the Apple from a professional standpoint; what do producers, videographers or cinematographers think of the iPhone, what do professional photographers think of the iPhone when it comes to taking photos in raw?_
Don't trust anyone this video is the proof😂😂😂
This was waste of time its baised comparison .....see if this was the case which they concluded there would have been a disparity in sales but two actually do a decent thing moreover  apple being to control freak makes competition new rival a no go option ...having a open market new innovations fair competition is good for customer
The only difference that will matter to you :- If you like customisation get android  If you want easy and aesthetic software get iphone  Only issue being in some places iPhones are more expensive than androids
.
All over all rounder iphone …
@Mrwhosetheboss  i wanna see this comparison in 2024.
9:51 the video end Iphone wins lol
So Arun flew all the way along from UK to US just to disrespect us android users.
What do you think what is better iphone 12 pro or redmi 13 pro
this seems not very well thought out, many important points not even considered
Iphone is only better if you want to travel back in time and feel what its like using your grandma's technology  😂
Bro the guy works at appel like this vide was sponsored by it like performance is like the same kamera goes to samsung😂😂😂
Human nature requires lots of change & excitement to keep its attention.  so, minus your real needs, phone companies constantly invent new toys to keep you preoccupied like a hyper kid
Iphroid is the best phone
I love how I got a apple advertisement before the video 😂
we are slaves to Apple products! Their phones are the most monitored, all the data is in their servers, even photos, they ask for money per month for everything, the only thing that attracts us is a fast simplified menu! Android and window operating system are much more reliable! Apple system is their server store all user data! This makes me hate and reject them!
Well, you can clearly recognize that both of you are completely brainwashed by Apple. Even in categories where some Android phones are far in front, you only give a draw and compare an old Android phone with the newest iPhone.
Iphones are so smooth, more powerful and once you get iphone you don't need to worry about next 5 to 7 years but not with android
WOW! It looks like samsung is doing just minor changes every year, but when I look at this video from 2022, it looks like samsung (and other androids) would win a lot more now! Please make a 2024 version!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤🎁🎁🎁🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘😍😍😍
❤❤❤❤i❤sumsung😊😊😊😊😊
The fact they need to compare all androids to a single model of phone just speaks for itself.I mean im not an Apple fanboy but if you dont have a personal dislike for IOS i dont see a reason not to get an Iphone.Across most categories the Iphone either wins or competes closely...And price really isnt a dealbreaker anymore considering Android flagships are now right up there with the Iphone in price.
phones are about talking. imessage and facetime are way ahead of android
Can you test why the Android flash is too slow compared to the iPhone? Also, why does the Samsung S24 Ultra flash not work at 0.6X zoom?
You shouldn’t have been this agreeable Aaron. Everything you disagree with, you still let him decide the point? It’s your channel, argue and figure it out. Don’t just let Apple get the point. That would ACTUALLY tell us which is better. And not just who an American thinks is better. And already known as kind of a “fan boy” … very worthless video
There voices are so comforting
The funny part is apple beating android in battery  LMAOL🤣
Apple is way better at almost anything
Iphone won but the samsung note 10+ still has a higher resolution display than the new iphone 15 max this channel is totally a scam.
Iphone 15 pro max is not even 1440p display in 2024 what a joke. Watch movies on android with 21:9 aspect ratio is a win.  Iphones are outdated technology rip-offs. And these guys actually had a convo about "value" that was longer than 10 sec. Completely out of touch with reality
The polluting category both phones lose that one cause they both have new models every year and built in planned obsolescence with updates. I changed to a brand new battery on an old iphone 6s and they programmed it to drain the battery almost immediately so that it's e-waste as a phone, only works when plugged in constantly.
What a horrible biased video. Unsubbed, considering this garbage comes from two of the "biggest" tech youtubers.
Currently using a xs max but my Nokia 5.3 smashes it it many ways  The amoled screen is way better than the Nokia and iPhone cameras always smash android but overall feel like apple have fallen behind my Nokia has face recognition finger print and split screen it does more than apple but apple just looks so much better and flows nicer  Android keyboard is far superior tho
Privacy is also something that only provide by iPhone. Hackers can not theft the personal data of iPhone  user.
I've switched to iphone atleast 5 times in the last 12 years, and everytime within 2 weeks i switch back to samsung galaxys. I like android more than apple. You can customize things more, watch YouTube while doing other things (which i believe iphone finally allows you to do so), you can change the look of your apps and theme on your phone. The only thing i liked about iphone was the keyboard. Been really considering getting the iphone 14/15 pro max the last month or so, but might just get the s23 ultra
There's a reason I don't watch mkbhd and it's because something about him, how he talks, how he handles topics etc doesn't appeal to me.  Also mrwhosetheboss constant apple vs android topics I also avoid as I don't feel its a particularly unbiased opinion on the matter. I'm not saying apple has paid him or anything like that.  But he's not truly neutral on the matter and hearing both these guys talk about apple makes me not want to bother as from the outset I know they'll just pick apple. It's not even close.  No matter how much android improves or how much they could outperform apple, it'll never be enough as there's no impartiality here. If you're an apple fan, fair. Enjoy. But if you're an android fan? It's pointless to listen to.
I've always used and prefered windows / android. Windows because of software support and way more options in terms of hardware and build (built my own last PC). As for Android I just believe they offer way more valuable low to mid-range phones, and generally just better hardware for the price.   For flagships I'd say apple and samsung etc. are the same, both overpriced due to the brand sticker, but apple does have the advantage of having an ecosystem, for good or evil. Personally I don't like that apple intentionally makes one product reliant on having all their other products (and even for your friends and family to also use apple products, facetime as an example) to get the full value out of it, but that's just how business works.  In the end it's just prefrence, but I do wish that apple products weren't so locked into their own expensive ecosystem, if they weren't I might have actually given them a shot.
they are too biased on iphone
iOs won by 5.5 points
can u do this  interview again with 24 ultra?
I expected a landslide win for android due to how insanely diverse the options are I still like my iPhones though
THAT'S WHY MKBHD'S OPINION IS BIASED , VIDEO IS PROOF
The fact this video is 20:23 minutes and they made it In 2023😂😂😂
Bro forgot about game experience speed internet space ram micro SD Sim and accessories plus customization for android what a one sided debate
Go And watch A2D
A person (mkbhd) who use samsung s21 ultra as a daily driver give everything to apple because of sponsors 😂
The 🇺🇲 vs 🇬🇧 accent could war battle in this video is so real
This video has quite a bit of backlash in the comments and rightly so. I mean holy hell, is this some of the best display of Apple's marketing muscle on full display through you two as a vessel. Haha
Just finished watching this video, although I had read some comments before I started watching it. On one hand I am not surprised that iPhone won this comparison, yet as the owner most probably the worst model ever, iPhone X, I personally voted for an Android, even though there are great features on iPhone that make life easier, yet there are things that I personally prefer on Android. Have had my iPhone X for some time already, yet never ever heard of overheating, which is such a pain in the neck that sometimes I want to throw it out of the window. Never ever has this happened to me with iPhone 8+. The body material does its jobs definitely. iPhone 8+ never got overheated, just a bit warmer when plugged into powerful power bank. I could play hours on it, take long videos and never ever overheated. On iPhone X I sometimes need to be careful, coz it is so easy for it to be overheated, and not once I couldn’t have used it at all, coz it needed to be cooled down first. Is Apple serious?! This is a big bummer and big betrayal and being truly happy with iPhone 8+, true disappointment has arisen in me after some time of using iPhone X. I truly trusted Apple. Not saying that it is a sh** company, but it is overpriced, despite its customer support, and there are better choices than iPhones. I had been an Android user in the past, owning Huawei P8 Lite and then Huawei Y9. Both great phones, never got stuck, never got overheated. Photography as well as videography has become my big passion over the years and as such a person, I was truly surprised how limited iPhone is, even iPhone 14 Pro Max. I had the opportunity to personally hold i14 Pro Max and Honor 70A and I was truly shocked how diametrically they differed regarding camera features, moreover i14 PM being priced 3x-4x higher than Android’s equivalent. Cam features on Honor 70A were amazing, plus the overall smoothness. Pretty unusual after using iPhone 8+, at that time, for quite some time. For me personally the camera and its wide selection of features matter a lot, and not only that. I’d say that there are definitely more people choosing an Android phone, whichever is the most suitable to each person. I have started digging more details about Android phones, because I truly want to have a great choice of features for taking pictures and overall freedom. I think that iPhone devices limit our freedom. Just because Apple is popular and its devices are easy to use, doesn’t mean that it is the king of the world regarding techs. So many things cannot be done on iPhone, or even on MacBook Pro II, which is also rather just for work, perhaps some editing, but that’s all. You cannot play games on it which is a big disadvantage, at least for me personally. Another thing that is pretty annoying – you need some Apple software, like iTunes or whatever, to transfer your data, especially your photos and videos, for back up. There are also other files when transferring the photos that useless. On an Android phone, you just simply connect it to any device, open file explorer, and see everything that your phone contains, and you can start backing up right away, no need to install any software. iPhone is, btw, the only device I have ever bought from Apple company, and I think that it’ll stay that way, unless I am offered it for work, or at work, for free. Perhaps Android devices are being more used in Europe, in general, which is the part of world I originally come from. Checking some details about Android phones, there are some strong candidates, when the time for buying a new phone comes. If, and only IF, I was EVER to choose an iPhone again, it’d most probably be 13 Pro Max. Choosing a new Android phone, which is most likely, newest Huawei, Honor 70A and newly Vivo phone, are being highly considered. The main factor for me is the features of the camera, amongst others, of course. Don’t even need the fast-charging feature, because I, personally, don’t believe in its efficiency as it is known. I do believe that it reduces the overall life of the battery. Better to charge it slowly, normally and properly rather than quickly, abnormally and risking the usage reduction. Overall, an interesting and informative interview. As it was mentioned: it all comes down to one’s preference. I hope everyone will choose the best option for themselves and will be happy with it.
1. Tried an iPhone 15 PM recently and it was not smoother than the S23u. Not even close. I even had to check the high refresh rate was turned on thats how bad it was.  2. Never had a photo not save on android... Is this a thing for anyone but MKBHD?  3. Havent had a core software glitch on android for a couple of years.  4. Software features: historical clipboard, customisation, better keyboard, t9 dialing, a home screen I can actually organise.   This video was a waste of time.
google assistant is ALWAYS buggy!!! ALWAYS!!! it's inconsistent. sometimes it will reply sometimes not. sometimes instead of controlling home devices (commands that I used before) it returns  search results on that very command. Google assistant is super unreliable! That's why I'm now thinking about to switch to apple again after 6 years of not using their technology... I have a flagship google phone and it sucks balls.
I phone 16
I care about doing what I want and customizing what I want. Apple sucks at that. I hear it's more stable, and that's probably cause they streamline it, but idc about that as much as the customization. Apple OS sucks. Thats why I choose android. Even a sucky android os can be change to one you like as long as you have the specs to run it.
Great work as always! Keep the good work coming.. I recently got my list with pros and cons of the iOS and Android and I am about to switch.. I am sharing my thoughts in my channel :)
why does this colab feel soo biased in favour of apple
iOS hasn't caught up in customization, it's not even close. Coming from Good Lock, KWGT. Please. The difference is like android 100% iOS 15%
What did you guys smoke before making this video? 😂
Apple Always F**ks  Samsung 😂😂😂
I have been a android user for most of my life but alot of my friends are using apple so I am thinking about switching
I love watching both of you, but this was a horrible comparison video
I think you are paid to be bias
It’s so funny that Aruns personal phone is an iPhone but he’s defending  Android, and Marques personal phone is an S21 Ultra and he’s defending the iPhone😂
i have never seen a 20 minutes long advertisment
You CAN NOT say the iPhone is more eco friendly when they don’t give you a charger. I mean you yourself analysed this issue in a separate video
Two of my favourite YouTubers ❤
Essentially it's like this:  -Android Users do what they want  -IOS users do what they can
this is like asking a iPhone fan boy which one is best ios or android.... hahahahah one sided video.. hahaha. after 14 mints this video is pointless
Iphone has worst bench mark agains iqoo 12 benchmarking with performance.
The iPhones STILL can't change app skins, interface appearances, or system fonts and that's a deal breaker for me. I'm a big aesthetic guy and I can't stand their colorful minimalist OS design.
The design of the iPhone is horrible.  That alone makes Galaxy S24 Ultra a clear choice.
this video aged amazingly for android users. i laugh so loud when i hear mkbhd saying his delusions how apple is better.
You want a one size fits all system not just for you but for your family, go for iOS  You want a specific tech/system for a specific thing(gaming, photography, etc.), get Android
funny how Americans pick the iPhone over Android every single time
I think this really speaks to the value of Android. Overall it often feels like the lesser option, unless you know how to pick your ideal phone out of all the options. Then it most always beats Apple. Apple is great if you don't have a ton of preferences and just want a clean straightforward phone that puts social communication at the forefront.
Android Software is much better. One of the best is sideload. And many other better things
LMAOOOO!!!! Marques is such a Apple Fboi that it's pretty pathetic. His take on lockscreen widgets aged like milk. How's that AOD screen burn that the widgets create working out for you iPhone users?
Somehow I knew this would get lopsided with a couple of Apple fanboys doing the judging. I hear them talking about iOS being so much better cause blah blah blah and I'm over here shaking my head, thinking about how the iPhone keyboard doesn't even have a alphanumeric keyboard....you gotta keep switching between letters & numbers/symbols.   THAT is the one thing about iPhone that drives me insane....it's just so cumbersome & tedious to do simple things. A bunch of extra & unnecessary taps/swipes. There's also no clipboard. You gotta switch between apps a lot to do simple things. Just a LOT of unnecessary BS to deal with on an iPhone instead of Android.  And yes, apps are more optimized for iPhone BUT the apps are very inconsistent to use. The back button may be the in the top left, maybe it's bottom left, maybe it's top right, maybe it's an X instead of a < or something. But with Android, I just swipe up from the bottom right side of the phone and I go back and/or exit an app.  Then there's the laughable recent apps issue. The iPhone makes you close out apps by swiping EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. OF. THEM!!! Like how hard is it to code in a "close all apps" button like Android has?  So yeah, I feel like I've exposed both of these guy's biases here. I mean, how do these things NOT cross your mind when comparing the 2 unless you're a total Apple Fboi?
Mkbhd is an apple noob
All the android fanboys seething in these comments lmaoooo 😂😂
This is perfect. My two fav you tuber
I'm still on my s21 ultra 😊
I think this is most biased android vs ios video i have ever seen which is in favor of ios
This not an objective comparison at all. Obviously it’s an Apple advertisement
I just love ur videos
i feel like android as way more games
This video is more about iphone 13 pro Max and s22 ultra
This video sucks to be honest
Service is much better in android  let me explain why? Consider that I broke screen of both phone for iphone that delete all my data and repair the display at 2times higher price than Android. The main problem is they will delete all my data it is so stupid.   Now I don't understand whats the point of data security in iphone in the end i lost all my data. Answer me this?
You are deliberately giving apple scores, it's not a comparison video..seems like a sponsored video.
On Android now, S21. I used iPhone for the last year and the only reason was iMessage. That’s it. Had an SE which is a solid device, but iMessage was my sole reason for using it. I got around the problem with an app called BlueBubbles and an old MacBook so now I can enjoy my Samsung phone and keep my group iMessages going as well. Works great.
Honestly...Android is not a phone, android is software. A better comparisons would brand vs brand.
No matter how bad food your wife makes. You can never say that it tastes bad. In the same way no matter how unfunctional the iPhone is, you can't say..
no matter what they say thats depends on costumers choice...both brands have thier pros and cons...their is no perfect phone...stiil costumers choice and costumers budget...thats a fact
they compare apple as if it has no counterpart😂 for me icloud is the most useful in apple
Apple’s problem is rigging everything to the Apple ID to control it’s users don’t let the competition get a foothold I’m done with 🍏 I’m going with android Samsung lets see !
Just saying as somebody who runs a Google Pixel I've never had problems when shooting a photo and it not saving
Regardless of how these score against each other, the difference is not that substantial. There are a lot of great phones to choose from today. I’m an Apple guy and I know why I personally prefer it but I’ll never say it’s the best out there. I recently encouraged a friend to switch to Android because of the value he could get in that phone over his old iPhone. Pick the phone that works for you
Two people that only talk about Apple… what do you think they are going to choose ??
For being tech people you know little about android one if it's best fetures is it can be setup to work the way you want it
honestly this just validates my recent switch from pixel, even though i still love google's software experience, performance really wasn't it
Apple has INCREDIBLE  products. But they give their customers the middle finger as for services. They charge $1,200 for a repair. And their warranty cover NOTHING.
Everybody I talk to, iphone battery always dying.
R u secretly sponsored by apple?
7-5 for android
Its a matter of choice 👌
iOS is like OS from 1990
Next one BMW or MERCEDES go 😊
The MKBHD video a few months ago was actually atleast fine. Better. This video is the first time I felt both of them were just completely biased! Paid or something, I don't know, was very funny to watch... And I know time has evolved now compared to when this was made but even if we go back in time, this video is not upto the mark...   What I think (which no one cares and no one should) is...   Display: iPhone vs... Sony? Samsung? Oppo? Vivo? Xiaomi? Asus? Is there a comparison really? For anything, 4 of these are market leaders and all these are better for "Smoothness" or "Sharpness" and a few other stuff... Like no real match.  Performance: Yes. iPhone. Also Redmagic and ROG mainly for winning this category over, but still, vs All Android, and not taking niche market shares of both of these, iPhone wins.  Battery: Again. Only few like Sony or Asus beat it and maybe even Moto at times, and they are not Major players. So all in all IPhone takes the win.  Camera: Google, Xiaomi, Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, Sony, yes yes, can you say iPhone wins? No. These 6 offer all the tastes needed, iPhone not worthy here except for the reliability because of that photo disappearing thing in Pixel he mentioned... That happened with me as well, but that's fixed now. But if we talk about past, a point. For now, not a point. Video- Zenfone stabilizes better than iPhone for me, so... And Samsung caught up as well, but past, iPhone would win.  Eco-Concious: Fairphone. Nokia. Ya. He did mention still took the point. And anyway, many others are doing now as well...  Reliability: Tie. Ya. Tie. Apple seems more reliable to me, but sometimes I just feel like, Apple fakes things out. And gets us in trouble, very buggy and unreliable, sometimes it feels like "just if I had an android right now", long story,not today. It is just like straight lying to us and android tells the truth no matter how dark. So Tie afterall somehow.   Featutes: Android. And no one cares about Airdrop and IMessage and FaceTime here, it depends on the country and very selected countries need to have an iPhone, rest, without compitition, Android wins.   Assistant: Google. Siri doesn't know languages and messes up most of the times, not even a need to explain how better Google is here.   Support: Google promised 7 years now... So that is there and Fairphone already offers too much. Still iPhone being iPhone, I guess a Tie.   Price: Sure shot Android, I just can't believe iPhone SE exists in 2024, it feels and works like something from 2015 or something. Just trash. Wierd how he still praised it.
Yall forgot about security
This is literally like comparing BMW or Mercedes with the rest of the car manufacturers or USA with the rest of the world 😂😂
One dude saying that he prefers long battery backup that's why he chose iPhone😂😂..... This so called tech🤡 thinks that iPhone last for 24h and fast charger phone lasts 10hr😂. He ignored things like more battery capacity in Android with faster charging will beat iPhone anyday 😂😂
How much did Apple pay the both of you? Because Iphone 15 is the WORST.
Yep I'm gonna get myself the s21 ultra. Thanks @mkbhd
Marquez is full of apple s***
Time for another tour: review 15 Pro Max vs S23 Ultra or 24Ultra in Feb but make it interesting not boring
No
Apple iOS  is literally unique. Android is an OS for all the rest of the scrubs on planet earth.
Great video! As an iPhone user I completely agree with these boys 👏🏼👏🏼
iPhone it's great. Android also but cheaper  and buggier. Your choice
If Iphone goes same feature as android on paper it would be lightyears ahead. They should do it. Or can they?  12gb ram iphone 200mp 5000mah battery  Android user here tho.
Who.. the.. hell.. cares??? A phone is a phone as long as it can text call and use the internet do the specs really matter? No! Specs are for nerds. 🤓
Please compare the best of Apple vs. the best of Android. That would be fair enough. Price range does matter, compared within the same price range. It's not fair to compare expensive phones vs. cheaper phones
iphone
The problem is they are comparing one phone to hundreds of thousands of phones
This video is sponsored by apple proved in 2023
What a bunch of BS
Performance should be judged based on what they can do with the power, and how well they perform the task. Both android and iOS are not 100% comparable. If you're talking about normal usage, it's barely any noticeable differences. If you're talking about specific task like video editing, yes it's quicker to process on iPhone but don't discount Samsung Dex which allows user to perform the job similar to normal desktop with keyboard and mouse.   In a car world, it's like comparing a sedan with an MPV
This is so biased and not 100% accurate.
Nah mkbhd is just like ijustine. Bias
this video seems a bit biased
bro gave the point to apple in battery category. i am out
This collaboration deserve a Grammy.
I'm sorry but this is completely biased. I like MKBHD but saying the battery on iPhone is better than, for instance, the Note 20 Ultra, not even close to true. I actually have a Note 20 Ultra from 2020. 3 year old phone. And I have an iPhone 15 Pro. Almost brand new at 7 days old, and my Note outlasts my iPhone everyday. I also use them both pretty close to even.  One other thing about the cameras. Pixels have by far the best camera setup combined with it's software out of nearly any other phone, including iPhone. My Note's main camera is just barely better than my iPhone. Same with my telephoto. However, the wide angle on my iPhone is slightly better than my 3 year old Note.   Also..... The iPhone's keyboard SUUUUUUCKS! It's hot garbage.
Watched @11.20pm 😂
iPhone keyboard is horrendous
The decision is simple- if you’re a content creator, shooting a lot of videos and photos, choose Apple. On the other hand, if you’re someone who has a lot of document related work/ file management work, choose Android (Samsung’s notes app is great).
Bruh it ain’t sponsored by Apple these categories just favor Apple if you changed the categories android would win easy
2 apple guys talking about apple? Yes that's what this video is about
Imma put this simply if you want a phone to do only phone things get iPhone if you want customization, free music, modded games etc get android
As someone who's never locked in to the apple ecosystem. I would say that android is more versatile. I can use my Samsung watch with my moto phone. Android phones and ecosystems work together. Im also a Linux use and it works really well with it. With apple your locked into it.
You know when they don't know about a phone when they give the screen point to iPhone
How is it possible that the iPhone beats Samsung in terms of screen and fluidity? 😂😂samsung makes iphone screens
Android is just better.
Android Have airdrop.
I can’t believe
I pay $150.00 for my cheap android,  keep it 4 years and if I need another by then I buy another one
*SPONSORED BY APPLE*
2.5/7.5 seriously?
I ditched iphone 6S for good since the battery always ran flat when I using google map to find my direction to travel on public transports and taking with my Autism client who need build on his travelling skills. Which I paid AU $1400 back then. Having fear of getting my client and I lost in unfamiliar street or not getting my client home on time before my rostered hour ended. My phone battery last me Full day of work without being flat since I got my Samsung phone. My bad experience from being an iPhone user for 3 years still make me think twice before I will reconsider APPLE devices. Since their devices can hardly help me to get through my weekly job honestly. That's why I still believe in Android devices over Apple devices. I won't be stupidly to purchase an overpriced products for a run flat smart phone & the same old same old without being innovative. Smart phone became a useless trash for people unless that have a decent full day battery as for being realistic in work life. Not just mention this is my hard earn money!!!!
Android shits iPhone 7 better than S23 ultra
iPhone superior Android who use this garbage phone 😅
BS!!!!!!!
The crazy thing for me is that on each topic there's one different brand that competes to the iPhone. Like... it seems that apple is just more consistent in everything.
Why if we have a bunch of electronics we can't have an android and a iPhone ? I have a moto an iPhone a few Samsung a one plus on and on they all get along in my house
Just mind blown by the fact that MKBHD shares his candid personal opinion, coming on top of his head and the precise details and facts in them make so much sense that everyone would nod and say " yeah, that's right"!
Phone is phone ok?
if apple actually cared about the environment they would make it repairable
I just love the flexibility and customizability of Android phones.
When i heard performance goes to iphone that's is already a lie bruh , ROG PHONE IS THE KING OF PERFORMANCE.
Omg MKBHD is just like me. We love the sharp edge❤❤❤ literally everything of the iPhone 14 pro max, sharp edge, box design, heavy weight, stainless steel, I love them all❤❤❤
Samsung is #1
android is for people that want a phone that lasts as long as its system updates, apple is for people who want their phone to outlive themself.
Nenaram Solanki
Use both ecosystems but this feels like an iphone ad
This video needs an update
i firmly believe samsung's quickshare is better than apples airdrop because you can use quickshare on any device even a computer
This is wrong..answer
This vido must be sponsored by Apple 😮
0:03 IMO, iPhone is about exclusion and seperation. Every iPhone user that I know treats me like I'm somehow less than them. For them a phone determines your value? I once worked with a woman who would not speak to anyone with an Android. I went to her with something work related and she would not do her job until i told which phone I had! Elitism no matter which way you look at it. The truth is that if creators, influencers or whatever you want to call them, would stop making videos like this, we can just all be who we want. This video will never change anyones mind, which makes this an excercise in futility. Android users will never accept the iPhone Dogma and iPhone users will stick to security and fewer choices. In the end, it's about your personal preference. When I had an iPhone i didn't like it because I enjoy being able to tweak my phone and get it exactly how i like it. End of story. We should all strive to be open-minded and tolerant of different perspectives, even if we disagree with them. Just look how long this is, thanks iPhone!😕
13:22 Very important because you have no choice, right? It's that or nothing.
6:35 You're surprised because it makes zero sense.
5:34 Did he just say Android is objectively better but he still prefers iPhone?
3:06 That's called subjective validation: The process of seeking out or interpreting information in a way that confirms one's existing beliefs.
0:21 It's more productive to focus on finding common ground than on trying to prove who is right or wrong. You're comparing based on opinions that are absolutely subjective.
great video guys
@mkbhd is not been fair enough
Cap
Just remember this..when you buy an iphone its not yours..
Marketing Alert: This is a marketing video from Apple. When you are comparing android and iphone at same level should they be compared and valuated for same costing mobile phones rather then comparing a $600 android and saying "oh the camera of IPhone is better" or oh "the performace of IPhone is better" what shit?
Hello how can I upload the videos to social media without losing its quality ? Please help 😊
If you really think the iPhone has a bettery battey than android you're biased as hell, everyone complains about iPhones battery this os the fiest time I've ever heard anyone praise it
I hate apple. I lured by my two friends and bought a new Apple phone and it sucks. There is nothing that I love about iPhone. You can do so less stuff after spending so much money. And also I play mobile legend and I can’t play it full graphic. Only thing I like about the phone is the camera. I think these dude are sponsored.
I moved away from Android years ago and except for very weird edge cases, I don't miss using it that much. Honestly if there was an Android phone with removable batteries, a headphone jack, and gets more than 1-2 years of support for under $300, I would prob choose that as my next phone since I don't really get calls or texts as much anymore. Though I am extremely lazy and prob won't switch either way bc I have 7 years worth of files on iOS and it's a pain in the neck to move stuff over even natively.
iPhone much better than Android
My opinion iPhone for the win
Well gaming wise it's not only about how smooth it is how high refresh rate it is always mostly about for how long it can perform like that and iphone fails in that many of my iphone user friends had this same complain their device heats up too much
Apple glazers
I guess apple is generous in what comes to paying tech channel influencers for good reviews .  Oh well, for a company that has a billion $, that would be nothing
Tim: Promote Iphone pls (even if you use Android) MKBHD/MWTB: Yes
I like how he's always like Samsung does this better but let's give it to Apple lol... biased nonsense...do a side by side with real data and Apple always loses.
i think this video is wrong from base just get idk android vs ios but you cant get mid and low budget android vs 900$ iphone vs 350$ low budget so androis vs iphone is bad get flagships vs iphone
Sponsored by apple ☠️
i love my freedom with android.
12.26am I am just enjoying My best  Android  phone
This is why apple don’t give you a charger. This is why they don’t include headphone jack. This is also why they will charge you $200/month for you to unlock and lock your iPhone/iPad anytime so long as you maintain your payment to their subscription services, monthly. Keep wasting money. iPhone 22 Ultra Pro S+ Max Fold SE X Mega Edition, price: $22000, everything else sold separately, even the manual at $80.
It's a biased comparison for iPhone....just use a samsung and pixel
Iphone 15 has usbc now :)
The iPhone now has USB - C
That was a fun video having both of you in there as I watch both your videos. The comparisons and the camaraderie was very enjoyable but the conversation itself was entertaining and informative. It’s funny how I watch so many comparisons about phones I’ve never owned and probably never will and still find them informative and enjoyable. It’s almost like watching a game between two sports teams and I really don’t care who wins but I just enjoy the entertainment, between the two of you and a few others I’ve learned a lot and although I’m certainly not a techhead, I’m not ignorant anymore either lol. You guys keep making the wonderful videos and I will keep watching. You both have a friend in Columbus Ohio :-)!
This one is rigged against Android, like come on Google Assistant is WAY better than Siri.
Team android for this one (like every time)
As an android user for the longest time, with experience with the iPad for a while the main factor why i will never switch to iPhone is the software
That's a crock You   guys must be get paid a lot from Apple. What about the fact that a first time user needs a phone that's easiest to use? Would that be an iPhone or an Android? No doubt an Android. What about the fact that most smart TVs are Android and if you want to cast the video it's so much easier! Computers tablets laptops all function better with Androids than with iPhones and if you can afford an Apple laptop that's great for you but most people can't You guys are way off on this If anything I could see a tie but MKHB You just pushing Mr who's Boss around and Mr who's the Boss why are you taking this from him?
imagine samsung only holds android software like apple's IOS. this could be a great match. but unfortunately, android has alot of variants and alot of developers tweaking on how to fit a thousand oranges into 1 glass.
Iphone vs all different brand Android phones. Are you going to carry 5 or 6 different Android phone with you all the time, Xiaomi for the camera, Samsung for the screen, Vivo for the value etc etc. hahaha
IPhone and Android is like comparing Apples and Oranges 😐😐😐
Lol iPhone user will always support iPhone and also no wonder this video is sponsored by Apple 🤷
Broo ....You missed this..IF you take same costed Android and Apple phones actually Androids play the game better because of its high core for multi-.  Android can perform 17 LAKH instructions/sec, but Apple only performs 10 LAKH instructions/sec . You need to add those.....
Andriod is better
Time to do another one now.
i have samsung s22 ultra now after used to have iphone 13 pro. but i really found that android beats the iphone. there are many small different features which exclusively samsung s22 ultra has. by adding up them i prefer not to return back to ios unless there will be any updates. love you my galaxy.
iPhone is overrated This is my answer😎 and the truth is quite different
I switched from android to IOS a year ago and I honestly missed the customization, fast charge, hi res audio and most of the mid to high end screens, ios seemed very restrictive and less value for each dollar spent
LODA LOG DONO
This comment is sponsered by samsung
Bring back removable batteries and headphone jacks and Android wins
He takes iphone more serious than his girlfriend
The square edges of the iphone probably dig into your hand so you don't drop your phone right? From my experience the curved edges of samsung phones look nice but make the phone feel like a wet bar of soap.
There is no objective "better" when comparing Android and Apple phones.  Different users have different wants and needs, and no one can be wrong in preferring one over the other.
Disappointed 😔 with this video. If the difference was 2.5:7.5.  Forget about midrange and budget, the one who are going to buy a flagship phone then the people 100% should opt for iPhone. After watching the ground reality you all could sense that it was a wrong analysis
Any review without considering privacy & security is useless
For me whatever is cheaper in sale and gives better value is better 6 years ago it was one plus 7 now it is iPhone 13 i love the both
HONEST OPINION FROM MY FAV YOUTUBERS...GREAT VIDEO. PLEASE DO MORE COLLOBORATIONS..
Tired of these ads. I want real opinions.
this is a lot of jibberish.
Man the butthurt android users in the comment section. Using inferior devices.
Only coping poor people prefer androids.
these two are apple fanboys as can be so them asking do you use that in android is just funny you've never used android for long or even personal use doesn't matter how much you lie to get views
I couldnt stand the camera on the iPhone... got so dark and very dull, not real color just dark. Where my Samsungs captures the actual light and color
im an android user but honestly iphone is better than android compare an old iphone to an old android ,old iphone still fast but some android slow and not supported for others apps
Battery goes to Samsung
Apple just has a better feel and works better with almost every single app. It’s more exclusive. I wouldn’t choose an android because of the OS. I’ve owned both, first Samsung, then iPhone 7, Samsung S10 (I think) then I went for an IPhone 11 then 12 pro and now a 15. I don’t even think they are comparable honestly.  But I’d never choose a Mac over pc tho. Hate the Mac OS
Android is far more capable than apple .......
“I devoted my whole life to learning how to hack my phone” is the sort of nerd thing I think of when I think of Android. Who tf could be bothered with that, it’s just a phone
Apple Rules all others Drule end of line ..
And then the s23 ultra came in and blew iphone out of the park in terms of performance
Ok... He uses the most superficial criteria without thinking about more practical issues concerning the two functional ones. You have as a criterion the camera, which in the apple is one and specific. Have Samsung represent all the androids they are like "state cities" Which means it's nothing specific. Therefore, the cameras differ from mobile to mobile and not from Android on iPhone. Correspondingly with the battery, but here I can say that Android superpowers against iOS, Because they know better to check their battery. You have the startup control from settings and id you root the phone then you will take full control of yoyr device. But, without root you are safe and you have enough control.   Source: android is based to linux. Linux is open sourse kernel , and allows their users complete control over them. The manufacturers of Android They limit liberties to ensure that the amateur - unaffiliated user will not damage the operating system. However, there are plenty of alternative settings, many of which are offered by external applications.  Applications: Huge variety with a lot of possibilities, joy on android. We are not limited to a specific source. On the contrary, we can get applications from the source we choose, even from browser. Beacuse apk files Only accessible to the user. Applications can be shared very easily and comfortably through this file.  File managing... Which exactly has a file manager in the Iphone?  Share: can iphones share files via bluetooth? I remember that something like this was never done, I hope they changed it now.  Customize: Androids, because they are open source, have the ability to have variety Not in "pictures" of course. I am referring to live wallpapers which are applied by various methods, the home screen which can be completely changed, correspondingly the keyboard,   Transfer files to windows pc via usb: Androids can do it without much trouble. Oh, as far as I know ios need program to do that, am a right?  Version of applications: Huge problem on iOS. On Android, if I don't like the latest version of an app, I have the right to keep the old one. To do this on iOS requires intervention from a computer.  So, the title android vs iphone is Very wrong. The correct title is here: What is better for you? A fixed experience or an experience of your own organization and freedom within your device?  I personally only find IOS disgusting
Either one will never be the best over the other. It is mainly up to the user.
I can't believe you riding with the iPhone 😡😡😡😡 you know damn well android is the best bro, iPhone is a boring smart phone seriously !
When iPhone wins categories due to airdrop and facecall though not even taking into concideration compatibility with other devices in general... 🙃
"Make a newer version of this video" Saying iPhone 15 and S23, not me.  4:03 Samsung F41: Uhm... where am I?
Apple forces you to have good style at the expense of control; Android gives you the chance to be as unorganized as you are in real life but with the freedom to do what you want
apples battery is crap apples the camera is crap even that made ads about the iPhone being worried that the Google pixel wouldn't be friends with it since it's so outdated
As far as the battery part that definitely shouldve gone to android apple devices die so quickly and take longer to charge usually if an android is at %100 battery it can last me two or three days no charge
Be honest (BKHD) hi loves iPhone it's impossible That's can ios beat Android on everything  I disagree 👎 special for betery Samsung as battery battery than IPhone
i found the video frustrating as every edge case where iphone was better than android iphone gets a point while every edge case where android is better “oh well you could make a case” and they tie
Android is better
I wonder how much apple pay them to say that ? There’s no way that’s a fair unbiased review…. I want unfiltered , unbiased with no money attached reviews.
Kindly record a video of all Infinix phones
Marcus is in Apple's pocket.
The creators are biased, just because you don't use a feature doesn't mean it's useless. The comparison is bad Would stop watching these videos.
Best tech duo ever
Android is better in EVERY way. End of story. People believing IOS is superior have clearly never owned an Android-based system.
Mewhose theboss keeps advocating for apple its disgusting if youre bias dont pretent youre comparing
I get tons of screen on time on my android and I charge it for 35 minutes before work and I'm at 90% which is good enough lol. I don't need to designate an hour and a half to charge it. Batteries in both are really good. Android wins all day, especially going to 45w charging. Apple is falling behind.
Welcome to iSheep club marques and Arun 😂
Samsung clearly have the best display, MKBHD was too biased and let him have the display and photography even though he disagreed.
this argument is so old by now & also irrelevant now. Both systems have their equal pros & cons.📱
Funny how they were complaining about the big notch and now every youtube tech reviewer is crazy about the dynamic island which takes more space than the earlier notch and blocks more content.
my favourite thing with gaming on android is that you can do emulation. emulation lets you run so many more games that are really high quality than iphone mobile apps. i also love shooting RAW on android with other camera apps like footej camera 2, because as a photographer it is just better to shoot RAW.
This video is super biased, unrealistic.
If you want the best CPU performance, iPhone has it in spades.
Android users holding back tears, the cope is crazy 😂
Always used android. Never had any issues. Never found the need to switch. One idea I hate about Apple is the fact that it's proprietary. Not a fan of that concept. I like choice. A company has no right to decide for me. Therefore, I will stick with android.
1:44 1:45 1:46 1:46  apple make the worst phones and the worst system ever
When apple has -ve, "no phone is perfect, let's give it a draw" When Android has -ve, "FUCK YOU!!!!"
pricing is worse more than 1 point because the majority of people can't buy a flagship, so android is an obvious choice if you are not rich
But me I'm Android I'm using and Samsung and vivo and Galaxy than the iphone and I'm using Android my Android is like getting upgrade and future and like they copy future the iphone! Android is better 👑👑👑👑🔥🔥🔥🔥
I feel like android has more options for people, whereas iOS has something for a specific group but that fairly large group has one of the best things ever for that group.
The 2 goats
Два сравнивают телефоны разных экосистем лол. Айфоны обновляются, яблобуки, планшеты - почти вечно! И работают супер. Если геймер - купи геймерский ноут на винде и не парься, телефон вообще любой. Кому нежен топовый самсунг 2018 года? А 2020? Нет поддержки? Аааа! Всрались.  Андроид очень прикольный в кастомизации, есть реально крутые оболочки, фичи, а айос очень отсталая и далека от интуитивности система. Но у яблока синергия и железо получает обновы и отрабатывает свое много лет, более экологично получается. Поэтому, когда есть с чем сравнивать, айос - это боль. Но в плане железа - вне конкуренции, если речь о времени, надежности и безопасности.
User of both worlds here: One thing regarding the Eco part, in my view, is, that a plus for the iPhone is that it seems to keep its value and operability for quite some time. Most of my Android phones become unusable after ~3 years. But a big minus that counteracts all the positive things regarding the eco part is Apple's hostile behavior in actively sabotaging every attempt to repair devices, blocking 3rd party repair-services, and making the devices unmaintainable overall - or if possible, making the official, proprietary repairs more expensive than new devices (hint to the Louis Rossman YT Channel). Plus, I often get the feeling that you pay the most by far for their devices, but they act like you do not really own them. Which is especially mind-blowing given the price.
Android
Alternative title: "Two apple fanbois comparing android to iphone"
Me watching this video a year later... Still using a note20 5g
Arun's accent so thic in this. Lol
I am an Android user, but I believe that both are great phones and everyone has their taste in what they have.  (but i do feel kind of offended when someone says iphone is better)
1.Vibration strength you can adjust on Ultra phone (iphone user won't know about it). 2. No fingerprint scanner under display on iPhone.  3. Four large icons only you cant add the 5th icon to the lower row on iPhone.  4. You can't rearrange icons, i.e. have one icon in the left and one in the right corner on iphone like wtf. 5. To close all open pages on iPhone you have to swipe with one or teo fingers totally stone age. On android there is an option to close all pages at once.  P.S. I just dont understand how come apple users can be so boring 😅 I always thought all CEOs or big company peoppe use iphone because they like to be different. Well, everyone knows you stand st the store and iphone ringtone makes everyone to check their phone because no one bother to change it. On android phone you can set video wallpaper on lock screen. You can have icons anywhere you like it and have many icons smaller size. Iphone 6.7 inch display with 4 icons per row is a grand parents choice. Tim Cook should buy new eye glasses 😅 And that 240 gram brick cost soooo much money 😊
I think iphone is killing it because honestly how many different model androids there are scare people when iphone is pretty simple nice design and yk is gonna be fast and work well
Mkbhd Android fan vs mrwhostheboss Apple fan
I like alot bixby routines its very cool
Iphone is better than android!
i love pics of something
dd
Siri drives me insane 😠
"oh, no the android one is technically way better but you know, is apple, *fells* better (even being 10x worse) so, yea, apple os better"
some android fanboys will say that this video is sponsored by apple lol
Android connectivity and APK is the things that matters to me
East or West Android is the Best 😅
ECO CONSCIOUSNESS GOES TO THE IPHONE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
me personnaly i prefer apple i just recently switched and all the problemes on my old samsung are all gone like for example the phones alarm would go off with no sound or i wouldnt recieve calls (from people who have samsung) the apps would bug out and all of it was just super buggy after only 6 months of having it and just recently got the iphone 12 (ive had it for abit over 6 moths) wich came out the same year as my old phone (samsung s20 fe)  and all my problemes are gone
Android vs iPhone = almost all phone,s vs iPhone , and still winning🥇
iPhone is better value because you can keep them for basically forever they outlive you bruh  The A silicon chips are like so frickin fast they're absolutley bonkers insanely futureproof
MKBHD is a apple fan so it's not a fair discussion, so still love android more, and is more relaible for me
THIS IS SOOOOO BIASED OMG LOL. Apple is not this great people yikes
Love how they club all of androids unique features as one win lmao.. apple master manipulation and we're believing it's superior lmao
The Samsung ultra has 200 megpixels,  Shoots video in 8k and zooms 100x and he's saying he would take the iPhone lol yeah right
I phone battery ishu😢
So biased, I didn't bother watching the whole video.
Li-Ion can never beat Li-Po batteries.
i can't wait to see the fall of apple and iPhone just like what happened to blackberry. it's time for China's smartphone to rule the market. like they the Huawei and Xiaomi. They are cheaper and way better than any iphone.
there is nothing more stubborn than an android user who refuses to switch to apple lmao
Apple has good products, but has that one thing, that destroys everything, consumer unfriendlyness in every possible way and limiting you to only theier products with their ecosystem. So better stay away, and have always the possibility to switch to something, if the new device frome the company you used before, is a bad one now, and not have to worry about, if it will work with your PC, your headphones, your everything else...
guys u need to realise that this takes in account ALL andriods into account against 1 great brand. so u need to realise that  all the comparisons are not samsung only. this is to the people who complain that their samsung works great and that mkbhd is wrong.
i just stopped the when he said iphone battery better lmao
MKBHD  is bias towards iPhone! I will never pick the iphone over Samsung S23 ultra NEVER! S23 is the best phone currently
battery for apple? watching in my iphone 14 pm with 89% battery health 😊
The fanbois on both sides need to just grow up. Get the phone you want. No one cares why you made that choice either.
Wtf is this 2.5 to 7.5
I can't say enough, android open source so for me is a win! I can do so much and i do so much! I did experience ios and is sad😢 i was so limited 😭 but is ok, i know ios is good system, but no doubt for me android win. ( only love to all sides )
And both of them have to be on drugs or drunk
And Marques brownlee is definitely an apple employee and fanboy
Definitely sponsored by Apple
So which of these 2 phones are the best for the government to spy on you?
These guys are not reliable anymore now...... My last video
Me watching videos someone says something that is not Siri but Siri still pops up or with roasting Siri as well it’s just annoying
I've used an iphone and android. I can safely say that in terms of pricing, android is better below the price of a pro iphone and once you get to $1000 iphone wins. so in my own opinion budget users should get an android. rn I'm using a pixel 7 I got for $350 on sale and I couldn't be happier with my phone
how you gonna talk about airdrop, and facetime as if android doesn't have the same shit? quickshare/nearby share, google duo/meet .... it aggravates me that both of you would be so disingenuous to pretend like android doesnt offer those SAME features
Android > Fruit Phone
Hi
Bro apple users say apple ui so good my experience was so bad  Switched from one plus 9 pro to iphone 13  Content scroll is so low, diaplay hz so low  Damn back button at top no gestures to do back   Notification sucks   Face id fails and time it takes to rescan  Ah charging speed 😮
but in worldwide sales market, android wins than ios.
man what the &*%$,samsung is much better than apple,s22 ultra have 108mp  camera while apple have 36 mp camers
There aee cheap android phones that are trash then their are expensive ones that  can compete with iPhones , need to change your title asap
Podo pattikale
I regret not taking use of the cool Huawei Cam gimmicks more times before it broke
I've found that Samsung's battery age allot better than on the iphone I've found that after a few years the android beat out the iphone in terms of battery but on release that may be different.
14:03 still can’t change your icons on ios without a dumb banner every time you open an app
Android is pure garbage all the way nothing will change my mind
If u are poor(like me😢) buy an Android. No choices left.  But if u have the budget to buy a $1000 phone, go with apple. Android can't give you the premium experience you paid for.
9:27 u remove headphonejack and u cannot use wiredphone and buy an adapter for it or compels to buy airppods how it is eco friendly not fair this is unfair crazy stupidity
BRO APPLE BATTERY GOES DOWN LIKE A LEAF FROM A TREE
Android vs iPhone comparison should not come to merely flagships comparison. That's not what Android is about. This final score creates false perception in the watchers.
Least biased review in ohio
Samsung has better screens, good battery with fast charging, VERY stable OS with lots of customisation and freedom to use your phone however you want. It has better camera than the iPhone, It is much better with the stylus that comes with it. If you're not living in an iPhone community, no one in their right mind would choose the iPhone's software over samsung just because of stability, because android has come a long way, and is as good if not better than the iPhone in terms of stability. Android is much more reliable in some situations where you could just side load apps and do whatever you want. Even simple tasks like making a call is more convenient on android. The keyboard on android is better because of the better text suggestions.  iPhone is good, there’s no denying that. But it’s not as good as android in terms of convenience and reliability. The only thing I like about iOS is the fluid animations. Something like the camera not saving a clicked photo has rarely ever happened to me in my entire lifetime usage of android, so that’s not something that could be used as a reason to not to choose Android over iOS. Did not expect such bias from one of the best tech reviewers in the world.
This MKBHD-dude himself is one big black iPhone.  He automatically choose iPhone on every subject😮
i prefer android it is so compaitable has more apps and works well
I have never owned an iPhone...  I have always blindly told my kids iPhones are  junk. My first android was the first android was a Motorola Droid back in 2009. I've been thinking about trying the Iphone when the 15 comes out. I feel like this was 1 sided but I don't know truly
I take refresh rate over battery life any day of the week. Srsly there are outlets to charge your phone everywhere. At home, at work, in ur car, in public transportation, it's not as big of a deal as people make it out to be. unless you're hiking somewhere you won't have a problem, even then you can have portable phone chargers.
@6:17 i would disagree with this comment about certain apps behaving "really well" on iphone because if anything they're performing how both phones should be except apple actually bribes some app developers to only let apps on iphone have direct access to the camera hardware where as on android the same apps will have to use something similar to having the camera viewfinder screen captured and then fed into the app almost like a "virtual camera" which makes it look worse.  so yeah in the native camera apps samsung is way better quality but in apps, ios pays to take the lead
The carbon neutral claims by those companies are from purchasing carbon credits, that's a weird category to add imo.
Mkbhd's voice sounds so different here what
no way they said iPhone is more eco conscious 💀
in my opinion, the only reason for ios to exist is to prevent android monopoly 😂😂
iphone suck for me , they hav like 40% of all the android features and the lighting cable just sucks
iphones are fir the NPCS samsungs are for the woke
Finally a true video about this theme
I'd give something else to iPhone. It's the fact that you can just simply move from a way older phone to the newest. I'll use the iPhone 8 and iPhone 13 Pro, obviously the specs will always be better in the new phone, but it's the fact that the UI and software will always stay the same. Some people say it's the same but for average iPhone users its a great jump because they'll still be able to navigate through everything like usual.
Samsung has a great selection of cheap phones that give great quality for the price. I currently have a Samsung A23 that was only $200 and I absolutely love it.
I love that mkbhd is very objective about iOS even though he uses and loves an Android phone.
This is clearly rigged.
The thing with android is that its built for everyone, the gamer, the middle aged boomer, the photographer, the Flexer, everyone. so you can't really compare it with Apple. it won't be fair for either
IPhone for life
A big booooooo on this video android is much more affordable charges fast if you want to switch u dont have to worry about your kidneys want good photo quality take pixel phone s22 etc and sometimes even u have a headphone jack comes with a fast charger with some phone not all and you can do so much more with android then bs apple ecosystem so choice is yours wanna show off or actually want something good for your hard earned money 😂
Samsung better this was 1 sided He's a 1 phone user Samsung last longer and better camera faster use
I have a better experience playing game on my android device than an iPhone because the iPhone tends to get very hot and the game starts to lag alot. It's like you have to walk with a cooling device. So that comparison is trash. It is one sided
If it's a tie, then why tf r u people here 😂😂😂😂
Android is much better
What's more important, human rights or eco(logical) impact? This is why your reviews and comparisons are so Apple centric. Apple never places humans over eco(nomics). Maybe the bite out of the apple does have a sinister origin.
I still don’t like apple it’s just not for me 😑
This was ridiculous. Can't believe how many categories were ignored.
Battery life is almost the same (iPhone win just a very little) but the charging speed is much different. Battery performance should be measured by "Battery life after 15 minutes of charging from 0%" - Then Android wins
As soon as you look at a budget Samsung phone, it becomes even easier for the iPhone to destroy it in the rest of the categories because they then no longer compete.
You look at price and functionality  you get Android. You want the vibe you get apple
Kinda old video. But ... I never had an iPhone, but I'm so tired of Android gimmick that I'm going to give a try for Mini 13. There is always something wrong with Android phone (and I got one for 14-15 years). Mini 13 seems to have only problematic battery life ... nothing else.
Ok while i usually want to watch these videos, but i feel you usually fail to make better comparisons, how do u go to hardware when you re talking about the os here ios and android os remove the hardware crap
Why can't I see any Android screen when I'm out in the sun unless it's a high end android
The iPhone user experience can sometimes be frustrating due to certain design choices and functionality issues. For instance, adjusting GPS settings through the settings menu feels inconvenient. Additionally, Wi-Fi often remains active even when turned off, which can be confusing, especially when networks are recommended. The default keyboard is also slow, especially when typing characters like "űáéúőóüöí" which are frequently used in my language. In contrast, Samsung's keyboard learns user preferences over time, allowing for quicker and more accurate typing.  Signal strength is another concern, as the iPhone 13 tends to lose or have weak signals compared to other phones, despite its premium price. The camera performance on the iPhone 13, non-Pro version, is disappointing compared to older models like the Samsung Note 8, making the price difference hard to justify.  Browsing on Safari presents issues too, as page numbers at the bottom often trigger the button bar to pop up unexpectedly, leading to confusion and accidental navigation away from the page. This design flaw is frustrating and could be improved.  Customization is another aspect where the iPhone falls short. Unlike Android, Apple restricts custom ringtone options, making the process cumbersome and deterring users from personalizing their devices. Moreover, the inability to easily turn off red notification bubbles or control them individually is problematic, especially for users with OCD who find them distracting.  A specific example is with Messages – it's frustrating that the red bubble notification insists on being addressed, even when the user has already seen the message and doesn't wish to open it immediately. A simple solution could be allowing users to mark messages as "seen" without being forced to interact with them.  In summary, while Apple products are known for their sleek design and user experience, there are several areas where improvements could enhance user satisfaction and usability. These include more intuitive settings, better keyboard functionality, improved signal strength, enhanced camera performance, and increased customization options. Addressing these issues would undoubtedly contribute to a more enjoyable and efficient user experience with iPhones.
Man we need “Tech Smosh” more than ever after this with you two.
What about the abilty to expand the memory on an android?
What re you guys on, I don't know ow anyone woth a iPhone that doesn't have battery problems, the s22 has the longest battery life
samsung has quikshare
I have an samsung S22 and my handy makes better pictutes than the iphone 14
What about back button 💀💀💀
You guy's focus on specific points where IPhone wins. Which is cringe but ay. Make oneplus cheaper.
So bias and so misleading. If you were truthful you would say the best Android is better than the best iPhone in every category. The difference is iPhones a phone and Androids and operating system with mini phones from cheap to expensive from simple to technically advance
This is embarrassing. IPhone is reaching so bad. How about comparing the best iPhone to the best Android and leave it at that. In other words iPhone can't carry Androids jogging strap.
Even though you are very seasoned on the topic, I believe you show a liiiittle partiality towards Apple. I mean iMessage or FaceTime being "very important to a huge number of people" when Android users globally are incrementally more.. Plus Apple doesn't even offer a medium or low range phone line. Final and foremost, apple phones are far less resistant to wear and tear and tougher conditions than the average Android phone. So I think it's definitely a closer debate. Cheers
Two goats of tech YouTubers in one video
Let's act like Apple didn't support this video 😂😂😂 lord that Marques dude is a funny guy really  not bias at all very tech most reliable opinion ever. 😂
i dont like apple, lot of restriction, it squeezes my hand.  s23 gives very good experience for daily intense office use.
This whole video seems like Arun is interviewing Marques. Instead you both should have kept separate scoreboards and avarage it out at the end.
You should have added 3rd party/owner repair. Android still kicks iPhone's butt in this category. Like can you swap authentic parts without getting help from the OEM? (Or should I say interference?) Like error messages popping up. "True tone has been disabled ".
Yeah Arun we get it you're a android fanboy lol
I feel like they say one thing and then give the point to iphone 😅 I must be missing some back stage talking or something.
I have both an S22 Ultra and an iPhone 13 pro max and I'd give it to Android because of work related apps that I use more, iPhone still feels like a toy to me...   Social Media I'd give it a tie, Camera depends but my S22 Ultra beats iphone by far, battery Android, video/screen quality iPhone but apps like Netflix, Disney+ and YouTube work better on Android  Guess it depends on what you use most
This comparison felt biased towards iphone
iphone vs samsung i choose samsung
This was so biased it was hilarious
at the end of the day its all subjective!!!
goofy asf
Android wins Samsung Samsung Samsung
The one thing I think I want to move to IOS for is the cloud. Samsung is such a mess! I pay for google storage, one drive storage and the pictures are just a mess on one drive! I just wanna pay for one and have everything there!
I just got an Apple advert then a Samsung advert right next to each other😂
Hey can you do 2023 version of the video? :-)
iPhones suck   .
MKBHD was very consistent about iPhones
iPhone is too expensive and you get less than cheap android phones! I have an iPhone 14 and I am really disappointed!
24 hours without charge is impressive to these guys.   *looks at android motorola thats been on 15% battery for three days*
Can you guys please do this when iOS 17 and the latest version of Android drops would be really cool to revisit this comparison 🤙🤙🤙❤️
Some severe bias to iPhone in this video. I use both and I feel android is far better I most cases.
I would love a comparison now.
I am switching to iPhone
I love my Android phone better than IPhone
I actually Almis fully agree with the analysis here. I understand that nerds and nische cases exist but when it comes to implementation and presentation of features and consistency that a lot of users care about, iPhone hands down win. The value is the trickiest part. But if you own more Apple devices and enjoy the ecosystem then there just isn’t a viable option. There is no real comparison to android ecosystems. Because there simply aren’t any to talk about except maybe Samsung ❤ Microsoft. The fact that we talk about The iPhone vs. android, an operating system in many costumes speaks a lot to the superiority of the iPhone.
I hate Android with a passion. Like a buggy computer they’re awful. Things popping up all over the place, odd sounds coming out of nowhere, I hate them! Can’t understand why anyone would want an android when Apple is so beautiful, simple and elegant.
18:07 for conclusions you can get way cheaper brand new phone for only $68 xiaomi redmi a2 2023 from their own website officially!
In terms of battery how can you forget Doogee V max with 22000mAh (with 33w charger brick) battery versus iPhone 14 pro max ( with 27W charger) which last for 4323mAh battery. And then you are compairing it with Realme GT3 with 240W charger inside box...what would you think, who should win?
Mr. MKBHD in count of performance we consider benchmarks and on paper SD8 gen2 is clear winner onto A16 bionic whereas ZTE Nubia red magic 8s pro plus comes with 24 gb ram whereas iPhone comes with 6 gb. How is this possible that in terms of multitasking android stays behind wih samsung dex and moto ready for with desktop like experience....how? Apple fanboy!
In the display department I think MKBHD has somewhat cheated as curved displays are more above in technologies rather than flat displays and if you took sony in consideration no one gives 4k display on a smartphone and 21:9 ratio is just superb for anything and for iPhone every of them has a notch whereas xiaomi mi mix alpha has 360 degree screen aal rounded so sophisticated as futuristic!(Never ending topic) but this poin should obviously go to android!
Android 14 is about to launch so where is this video series of 2023? Hope MRWHOSETHEBOSS is soon presenting...
Wtf
mkbhd is clearly is a iPhone fanboy
I almost thought it was a fair comparison until you talked about the camera. I can see the bias and inclination towards the iPhone.
So this was MKBHD's priority list lmao
If you purchasing phone for watching Movies go for Android. iPhone can only play 720p on most apps. Android can play 1080p or 4K depending on Phone.  If you want less issues in software, go for IOS.
Not everyone can buy a iphone but they can buy a Android phone. So Android wins the race 🎉
as a user of both android and ios, i must say ios is so comfortable to use and still smooth 5 years later.
I would love an iphone with android system
They really kinda made this video to make apple win
you can something on android that is very similar to airdrop
I know a Computer Scientist that was a Lead that helped establish Apple around the world. He doesn't own a single Apple device, he also agreed with me that Apple is not for people that are Tech Geeks and know how to use Android for all the capabilities Apple doesn’t actually have. Also, he quoted People n his Lead Apple developers meetings "~LOL!! The only smart people with Apple devices are the Lead developers that work for Apple!" Moreover, don't forget thay even Steve Jobs regretted working for Apple before he died, and not to mention that his daughter was on Welfare til age 18 because he made her a bastard. (You could even buy her book at Barns & Noble).
I have both an android (samsung galaxy) and an iPhone. The galaxy is my personal phone whereas the iPhone was given to me from work.   I can by now confidently say that the iPhone is horrible on multiple matters. There.
Mkbhd is a pure Iphone Lover so it's useless to ask him about IOS & ANDROID😂😂😂
Expensive = better
Apple everyday day of the week.
apple eco system is just the apple forcing people to buy expensive things with low specs
I think the Iphone IS  a good phone, the problem is the pricing. Its still a bit expensive in the US, but in many other contries, its as expensive as a car. Android companies have cheaper phones that you could buy, and even the flagships are less expensive in most cases. But still a good phone.
When they're talking about the price points in which one's better I can't believe it's even an argument. There's enough price points to count on your fingers for iPhone each year but each year there's literally hundreds of different phones being released each year by multiple manufacturers that have all sorts of ranges from low to mid to high-end. No competition for price as a matter-of-fact apple should lose a point for price because you have to pay a premium to become part of their ecosystem
My Samsung phone worked well in forest cities in California, my wife iPhone 14 died all in same cities we stayed last week. This is very important to you guys travel to those cities like mountain, hill, forest and must think about it. Real life.
Android has so many problems to iron out. Samsung is the only good brand but even they need to ditch Android and create their own OS. Apple’s software + hardware integration is hard to beat and is why so many points were given to them.
"Don't know why I'm here and I can't even afford any of these phones"  Back to my Samsung A10. Don't Laugh!
iPhone: + Stability  + Smoothness  + Support  + Security   Android + freedom   The last is decided all
so im still owning a samsung 2019 midrange.    So better to get 15 pro than s24?
this comment section is probobly the most mad ive ever seen android users
So i have both phones,
I am cheering to windows phones not really i am not an psychopat
You need both  You can't live without iphone  You can't live without Android
"Andrioid charges super fast" My android tablet needing 15h to charge from 0% to 100%:
Android charging is just superior
apple only has to worry about updates for apple hence why less buggy mor smooth, android has to get updates rights for 100's of phone which is more taskfull. How would apple be if they had 100 models every year to update and get it right for all of them. Apple 1 phone Android 1000
how was the widget a draw? Lol yall tryna help android so bad
OMG!!!, 5 YEARS OF UPDATES.......2 OF WHICH WE WILL SLOW YOUE PHONE DOWN
The software features part is kinda relative tho. I live in a country where most people use Android phones, and therefore, no iOS functions are standard for us. iOS users here aren't particularly attached to facetime or iDrop because the situations in which they would come handy are very limited.
I used to be an Android user who hated iPhone, and I still use Android, but Apple’s minimalistic design is tempting me to buy one. I’m nervous about switching to iOS though. 😬
iPhone ❤
MKBHD sounds like a he is endorsed by Apple and is trained what to say when talking about competitors.
Om not joking just git an fully working iPhone 7 for free
What this comparison shows, imo, is Apples impressive ability to compete with the entire Android Phone market. It's like Tesla VS the rest of the Auto-Industry. I believe the end result reflects that.  I hate being technical about it, but here's my issue with it. Comparing Android to iPhone is like comparing a cow with hunk of steak. You are comparing an OS with a finished product (that runs a different OS than Android, it's true, but still it's a different thing nonetheless, its an end product).  Although a less attractive approach, a comparison between products (lineups) of two brands would be more effective imo, at least from an end-user standpoint. Beacuse in the end, most people chose a different phone-brand over an a iPhone, not because of the OS, but because of the user experience that the product offers.
You know it's going to be an unbiased discussion when straight off the blocks the Samsung display is measurably better and scores a draw.
I used Samsung for years in highschool but the battery was atrocious!!!!! But a few years a after highschool I got an iPhone and my battery has never failed me and my phone has never LAGGED when opening apps.
Team Samsung ✋  Who else?
0:51 why so many joy cons 😅😅
Y'all so damn biased with Iphone it isnt relavent. How can hundreds of phones cant compete with one damn phone. Yall getting paid well👏👏👏
Moto Motulla, Actually is Easy to use, neveget, I'm not sure what Apple 🍎 might be worth it, l'm Still think ING about it, Thank you Have a good night, Please let us pray and have Peace ✌️🕊️ Enjoy your Phone 🤳 What Ever you need s aer,
Mediocre Comparison if u ask me. I actually liked this channel but after watching this, I don't think this is a tech channel  for me any more. This will be the last video.
A few things I have noticed about the pixel camera, if I a snapped picture looks like crap, the image processing fixes it within 2 seconds, it has a quick camera shortcut double tap power for camera without unlocking the phone and hit volume rocker to take a picture, taking a picture that way shakes the hell out of the phone, I'm always sure the picture is ruined yet somehow the picture looks like I held the phone still. Its remarkable, I'm taking pictures of a meter all day. It does have some difficulty focusing at times though, it will focus on the glare rather than the digits on the screen of my meter. Coming from a razor 2 with a 12mp camera I'm more than impressed
I think andriod is underrated here, Team andriod eitherway
Team ios here
iphone better android is for poor people
This review is very biased, proformance is just a free catagory for apple. WHEN IT DOESNT MATTER. No one mobile games. Even if u do then buy a gaming phone. Samsung also wins display
The Shortcuts app in ios is leaps ahead of android when it comes to being smart
put on some pants
just watched android bein destroyed
u want to say that iphone battery better then galaxy battery ...... ?!!! are u serious
MKBHD acts like he does not want to be there. Feels bad, man.
My telephone is black view.... android.
2 fav person in a one frame
The iPhone vs android dilemma doesn’t really make sense. iPhones are just one line of phones while android is hundreds of phones. On average the iPhone will win, because of how many androids they are, but against the top notch of androids it’s pretty close in many categorizes
Is it only me or should they swap phones with each other?
Android has more choice
Apple 🍏 i have had both apple is just so smooth with there software
Iphone it's a 2 dollars phone
flagship android and flagship iphone is 50/50 in my opinion, in most of these categories they perform so similar to each other that even if you pick one that is slightly worse, it will not have a huge impact in your overall experience. It's based on preference
0:50 screen is made by Samsung
My androids are basically battery kings, i havent used my android phone for a year and when i opened it, 55% BATTERY. ITS 7 YEARS OLD
I think you forgot google duo good video
I want fight
My friend was asking me how can he download music on his iphone. I never owned an iphone😅. I personally don't like apple but i will buy different brand than samsung next time because im bored. If sony releases a new competitive phone i will definitely buy it. But i will never buy apple because i love android and windows.
Concerning a recent attempt to lure or fish... I agree, Magic Eraser, Google VPN and Battery share are pretty cool features, BUT! I use both Google and Apple devices and while the videos are very good I've found some Google apps work better on iOS and are glitchy on a Pixel. While Face unlock is seamless on my 13 Pro whether in daylight or a dark room, face unlock on a Pixel only works in a lighted area. Not sure why Android phones require so much touching like under screen biometrics but being able to Face Unlock and add that feature to all apps in iOS is my game changer. My wife removed all security from her P7 since the in screen biometric is pretty FUBAR and that goes for my 6A. Never had any issues with the fingerprint scanners on the 3XL, P4A, P4A5G, P5, Sammy S9, Kyocera DuraForce Ultra, Sammy S5 but oh wait those are all actual sensors that worked so well. I admit that Google Ai has been excellent compared to Siri and then there are cameras which is nice but not the primary reason for purchase. Lastly concerning this set of Apple and Android BFF, when Google starts to back their product with 5 + years of updates and not just on a monthly basis. When Google backs there products with well trained and certified technicians in stores across the country and big box stores like Apple does, and specifically has an online technical course for certification of software and hardware repair then, that's when Google products can outshine Apple products. Apple products may be a tad more expensive but that's because as they say "you get what you pay for". Buying an iPhone these days is really the best financial decision since your pretty much guaranteed that it will last and if it breaks then Apple will fix it or one of their Geeks around the country are certified to fix various hardware for you or mail it to Cuppertino. Strange how that goes for their wearables, Macs, AirPods and iPads. No other manufacturer stands behind their product like Apple does. What really divides the difference for me between Apple and Google is I can choose different volumes for different features with Android. I can dismiss an alarm before it goes off in the morning when I wake from my Garmin or G-Shock alarm vibration and the alarm is still set for the next day. I've turned off the alarm on a iPhone because you can't dismiss it and forgot to turn it on for the next morning, good thing I wear a vibrating watch to bed. Don't get me started about the iWatch! Sure you can talk to it but the battery life is abysmal! For Gods sake I have to charge my phone every day, now you want me to charge the watch to?  There's opinions and reasons to own either and ultimately you cannot go wrong with either but we're an intelligent species who likes to throw away hard earned money for our whims. What you choose makes no difference to me but I choose not to purchase products designed to significantly depreciate in resale value so quickly, choose not to fall victim to discounts after launch since, "you get what you pay for" in a device which ultimately is a purchase not worth keeping for more then 2-3 years rather it stops receiving OS updates, can't be repaired or receive security updates. Suppose intelligent could be a loose translation since so many things in our lives take on a not so serious decision process.
for me i think android has a HUGE advantage as it has tons of variety and different reasons for each android
Fuck it he just love iPhone that's all
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT ANDROID ONLY EMULATOR GAMES
Who is Stealing your data better???
No telephoto lens, no s pen, no reverse charging... hardware the pro lacks yet still has the same price, doesn't spit window. And you don't use it often because you use an iPhone 😮
I love this collaboration!!!
The Android battery is so much bette
But whats in your pocket.... Android!
Apple lovers...Me , Android hands down. Yawl obviously  got paid by Apple!
Who is green and who is blue
Imagine wanting apple to update your iphone. There's no way they'd ever install a bug that slows your phone down in order to try and get you to upgrade to a new one. 😂  No corporation would ever do that.
If you're worried about battery life then why not get a rugged phone with a huge ass battery? My Oukitel had a 12,000 mah battery that will last me a week not to mention its waterproof.
Hit like to see these reviewers do the videos again...I love it... they are awesome....
I have only used android my whole life, so i am on android side (it is probably huawei samsung and nokia vs apple
iPhone is my preference
Bro wtf. This Video is so fk objektive from the left guy.
This wasn't so fair on Android
Iphone is better 🎉
All Apple's screens are made from Samsung.                       .
The fact that didn't make this iPhone vs Samsung makes this kinda stupid, the whole video gets dragged in so many ways when it just doesn't have too
Do it again but with ios 17 and android 14
This is what happens when two Apple fans make a video about iPhones vs Androids.
htf iphone won in the battery part
I've never enjoyed two nerd talking more
When u have a s21 and took money from iphone to advertise for it😂
I prefer iPhone that doesn't show error message because I hate when I'm on Android and it's hot and crashes on every app, it shows error messages so much it gets me angrier than the app crashing.
To me, I think it all depends on the phone itself. I’ve had the android phone for years and although There are a lot of things I love about The android My experience with the iPhone has just been a lot better. Call quality, texting, and the internet for me it’s so much faster with iPhone than the android. But then, again, I love the freedom of being able to store all of my information in my android Without the limitation of permission. But to each it’s own, I love my iPhone.
Honestly, nowadays they’re all just the same. It’s all subjective of which operating system you use
Phones have come such a long way. The differences are so close, does it really matter?
I have to strongly disagree with the eco-consciousness point for iPhone. iPhone is the least repair-friendly phone brand on the market solely because of Apple's whim, so if it breaks, you can't even sell it for parts, you're just going to throw it away. iPhone also gets only 5 years worth of updates, and then you have to put up with older software or get a new device, while on Android you are free to install a custom ROM with a much fresher OS version.
kinda weird you didnt mention quick share from samsung that works as good as airdrop, and nearby share which works with so many devices
did u know if u ask any average person what they wanna buy if they got a money, all the answers would be  iphone. and thats a fact!
They put points on ios but they love using samsung. Im really gay. Oh i dont know. 🤣
I'm not sure how much sense this comparison makes. You're comparing OS's, but half the points are about the hardware?
I don’t honestly care. Phones are phones. But I hate the hostility from the Apple community saying “Androids are for poor people” and a bunch of other crap. I think both phones can be awesome and honestly fun to use.
Apple vs all of the androids? Well that already says what is better. 💁🏻‍♂️
This was so bs
10 minutes silence for those who don't even know that Samsung makes all iphone display 😂😂
This comparison is so biased. I'm using Macbook and iPhone and love Apple products (ecosystem bla, bla), but a first thing - Samsung displays are unbeatable. So I need to understand how this can be drawn. Second, as iPhone 13 Pro user - battery life is nothing special. And charging on Android, especially Chinese manufacturers, has way faster than on any iPhone (not to mention the lighting port)... The camera on iPhone - OK, it's reliable, but Samsung or Pixel again has better cameras overall. That's my point of view. iPhones - nothing special. Macbooks - really, really good piece of gear.
This man is a  bias soul
Thinking of switching to android next year and i heard good things about it.
Ufs 4.0 or NVMe on iphones?
I have the iPhone 14 Pro. It takes terrible video when it comes to faces. It creates weird blotchiness and exaggerates wrinkles and lines. And even though it's 10bit, I can't fix the problems in post processing even with DaVinci Resolve AI.
As an Apple user I don’t have any devices that use usb-c so no complains and I love iPhone cause it feels different from most androids.
😮 I'm just impressed by how they didn't mention a lot of software features that android have and apple don't have, and the very simple one is the File management but there's more and more and they are important to a lot of people, or these two just talking about the American customers ...
Android
why they in the vector chairs 💀💀
I use multi Windows
the sad part is that most of the people that i ask why they preffer iphone just say because everyone else have one.
Performance is all about optimization
Samsung makes iPhone screen
The next IPhone should have USB-C charger. At least in the EU as it will be required by law to have the same charging ports in Europe starting the year 2024. 2 things I hate about the iPhone is there’s always an issue wit their charging port if you are one of those guys who put everything on their pockets. After while a charging becomes a nightmare. You need to clean it then and now. I bought a wireless charger for that reason. Very similar is when it comes to the speakers. I’m always carrying headphones with me because in a louder environments, you can’t hear anything. The speaker issue I had with last 2 iPhones I has. The charger issue I had with all my iPhones. Can’t wait Apple to release a phone with USB-C, but I guess I will upgrade to 14 PRO anyway, bc I am too broke to spend 2k for a phone. (I guess that’s gonna be the price of IPhone 15 PRO version). Was thinking of switching to Android, but then I dunno anyone who would use it for more than 2 years. My first IPhone was Iphone5 and it was reliable af. Also, I hate all those Android notifications, they’re kinda annoying. And I dunno, when I touch Android it feels like a toy phone cfor me. Still I think Android has some cool and free camera options.
For all the apple fans saying its better than sansung due to airdrop, its not. Samsung has its own version called quickshare. I dont use apple products (im a samsung guy) but i would imagine that airdrop and quick share work the same way.
Witch one is better? I use android to download my dvds on an optical drive and use my iPhone to watch it.
In short: iPhone is better
My final score: iPhone 7 Android 4
Just use both 🙃
android android android android android android android thats it
i’ll be honest: i can’t stand android. literally every android phone i’ve ever used was slow, buggy, and overall shitty to use.  apple for the win.
Shouldn't this comparison be b/w Android and iOS?
My 13 mini has a lot of bugs…camera sometimes doesnt launch, keyboard doesnt show up sometimes. Etc…. But i had huge glitches on my iPhone 7plus, google nexus 6, Samsung s4 galaxy. I remember my htc thunderbolt being awesome though….
i like samsung more bc i dont have that much money so....
I don't believe MKBHD, he's way too invested in Apple by default. I think comparing iPhone to Samsung phones is actually poor too, they have the worst experience for me.
Quite simply Apple has better hardware, a more stable system, better cpu and gpu, a better camera overall. But that’s it Android is way more customizable, easy to use, more straightforward, less complicated, way more apps, mostly free apps, switchable launchers, intuitive storage analyzers, free cleaner, forward thinking evolving os. And many more
HI
It is quite simple with android you can get a phone that is new thata costs less then an iphone that will do plenty and work just fine.
quick share is the android version of airdroid.
Can you make a video of how much it would cost to switch from android to apple. Like the complete list such as the iphone, ipad, macbook, mac pc, earpods, the earpod max, the watch.... everything. It doesn't have to be the top of the line items, just a bit of a estimate of how much it would add up to, to comvert completely to the apple ecosystem
Heres a fact too on ios they stop older phones working due to newer updates as in cant call or text even, i have never had this happen on any android device
Android all the way apple will eventually become blackberry
There was some favortism in my opinion also like bc from what it seems you guys use apple more so there is a preference. You should do this again with the s23 and 14 or wait till the 15 and s24. and you should have added repairability bc fixing your phone can be critical for the screen and price affordance
well for the battery the point should have gone to android also there was a sorta preference bc you compared Samsung to apple instead of android to apple which changes the whole ball game and usb-c being universal and oppo having the 200 watt charger now that point in my opinion goes to android also in my opinion most of the time I see apple users looking for a charger and its harder to find in some place or areas you go
MKBHD is so bias, as soon as he gave the battery win to apple i knew. dude is sponsored by apple all he does is rep them as the best in anything
That's why over the years i never subscribed because i could smell the fakeness. If they suck off Apple they will get a free phone to review 😂
They're both long time Android users, so for me I'm not surprised Apple bought them.
This could be a little biased, maybe you should have gotten random people off the street or something and conducted a short interview idk
Horrible review. Android is better
I enjoyed this video, but it's not at all objective! Guess it didn't need to be, but categories should be more, I don't know, ergonomics vs. aesthetic preferences; weight; how user friendly iOS or Android interfaces are; customization.. So many topics. Marques has very particular and specific preferences that tilt his judgment. I'm a new iPhone and, despite its stability, I'm struggling not to miss how easy it is to simply have a "back" button or super intuitive gestures, or customization of widgets, how easy is it to understand the Settings menu... I guess they are just two distinct systems and that's that!
For the screen quality apple uses Samsung screens so shouldn't android technically get the w
Pros and cons. Apple efficiency and security is on another level.
Ios and Android is all about use preferences in the end,  i just wish Samsung could integrate more with these third party apps cameras
Apple is better
why do this video when they clearly both are apple fanboys. My asus rog phone 6d ultimate battery life is amazing and the charging is super quick
I use to hate reruns recording now I would kill 4 a recording
I was told not to contact so.e fbi agents can't be trusted
Fbi
that was  alie about everything isaid
i'm 56 now grand pa died yester day win he was 106 he ait lots vedstables

I am in such a love and hate relationship with android. I am stuck with iPhone coz it’s such a smooth experience for me especially after I graduated from college. Voicemail just works better and the ecosystem with MacBook is perfect for work. Don’t care about iMessage so much but macbook and iPhone combo is hard to beat. Freaking google can’t even create a MacBook competitor is what I don’t like. If google wanted they could but feels like they just don’t care about such stuff.
Android is better period
IPhone is like naruto he use shadow clone every Year 😂😂😂
Anyone who has been watching youtube tech videos for years , would know that most of the content is sponsored ...yes but not all and smart viewer knows the difference
Android will get 10 point for bang for your buck ...obviously it was not included here
You can't compare iphone with android phone . It should have been direct comparison of s22 vs iphone 13
don't agree with mkbhd ...whatever
What would be more fun,  Apple and Samsung collaborate for one time to make a top of the top phone,  or Samsung make a iPhone and Apple an galaxy phone?
The reality is that iPhones are more popular for a reason, they are the best that money can buy. Consumers know it and tech YouTubers know it, the only people that disagree are Android fanboys and broke people that use Android because they can't afford an iPhone.
Bro the iPhone dosent have a better battery
Airdrop ? Windows phone, Google drive, and a cable connection, no need to say more. What if there is no internet connection? IPhone don't have dex, but you fail to mention the facts that matter, Samsung simply had no chance in this video, poor comparison, describing from this channel, after seeing this.
I have never had a photo dissappear on any of my samsungs, just nonsense.
overall its android for me
Totally baised on IPhone.
I will still choose the samsung ...dont give a fucxxx
if i post something on instagram with an android it rezises the image and makes it a really shitty image.
The amount of Android users salty over the results… 😆😆😆😆
Multitasking is nice.  being able to google something while watching a stream?
This is totally not true , android gives you more freedom and control over your phone. The other guy is just an iPhone fan period .
👎👎👎👎👎👎
This was the longest Apple commercial I've ever seen 😂
it's just an biased opinion video😏
8:49 This category is absolutely useless as neither of them are eco friendly. The only flagship I would consider eco friendly would be the pixel lineup since they collab with ifixit. Apple getting a point here is just objectively wrong. I love you Arun but you're a huge influencer, you should spend more time researching before making videos like these
Never gonna watch another "X vs Y" video again, because it's all subejctive and about preference.
"This video is sponsered to you by apple"
Sponsored by APPLE   don't take this comparison seriously as it is sponsored by apple....✌ samsung s ultra series is a clear winner with that overpriced apple sh....
MKBHD doesn't give much of an eye contact.
I think some people see iPhone as a status symbol for some reason (he says this as he’s typing on an iPhone 14 with AirPods in his ears, but anyway 😂😂😂).  For me it’s just what I’m used to, I’ve never had anything else.
Marques has one through every equation
Probably the most biased video on youtube 😂
Thanks for helping me with my School Paper!
Airdrop in Android exist facetime too
Iphone is better The only thing it needs  Multi tasking ala samsung File explorer
This is so bull crap it left every thing to ehh hehehe is up to you no its up to you okay we do it both at the same time kind of shit
On android I can get free apps free games and download anything I want. This will always 💯 better the controlling apple
I had a Samsung for 10 plus years and I just now switched from Samsung S22Ultra to IPhone 14 Pro Max and I love it! Team IPhone all the way!
MKBHD just seems like an iphone fanboy but thats just my personal opinion
Time to redo this comparison, but include android 3rd party apps that do the same jobs as iphone apps. Compare the apps seeing who does the job better apple or android.
Guys nobody gives a shit
Things might be quite different here. I am not financially fortunate, therefore, It is impossible for me to afford thr flagships. At least the current flagships. Here is where things get different. In terms of usability of the former flagships, android is a clear winner. I am using an old galaxy tab s2 from 2016. And very little do I feel that I cant use some certain apps due to my device not being supported anymore. And if it does, I can always download the apk of the older  versions and I can Install it successfully, and finally use it. But the old ipad mini 2 cant install mostly anything from the app store unless your account has downloaded the older versions before. And there is no way to download the raw installation file like whst we can do on androids. Also, when you are stuck on a 16 gig storage on an ios device, there is no way to expand the storage, but for the androids, you can just buy a new micro sd card with larger capacity. Not to mention that older versions of the apps in ios lag behind the android counterparts. They have less features due to having been abandoned. So one should be more happy with an old flagship of android than an old ios device for those reasons.
Iphones are shit
Android is the clear winner, the Americans are too proud to admit they are wrong about the iPhone. Android is better in every way
Nah. Pixel has way better camera. Samsung has better stabilize. Better battery and better charging.  Apple just steals ideas. But android way better then Apple.
Just knobbing that icock slowly too🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, the way yall make Android sound I might get one
Its funny to see some apples discussing whats better  " a banana or apple "
Have to agree with everything MKBHD said, but I hope android phones can be better competitions for iPhones especially in those small things like camera app open speed, virus concern, system lag, etc.  I have both android and iPhones. I mainly use iPhone but I wish I could have same quality choices for android phones.
"I dont use split screen multitasking, so give the point to the iphone". Thats the most stupid thing i have seen in a comparison. The fact that android can do split screen is a win over ios. Doesnt matter if you use it or not. Even if you dont use it, other people do!
Bullet proof Nokia 3310 is the best! Nokia forever
boring
Lol Sorry but this video felt biased and I’m a iPhone user
Company a : oh we have issues you want to wait or just restart it.  Company b: shit a problem shut it down and restart it fast so they don't know we had an issue.  Hard choice hard choice. But the apple nerd stays apple nerd no matter what. That's how fanboys work.
MKBHD speaking truth about android camera😅 and these phone OEM charges more now for "great camera" hardware BUT mediocre camera software that lags. like S23 Ultra😢
Value of the iPhone comes in when you want to sell it
at 12:17 you see that the iphone has 3G ive never seen that on a phone for ages, but i love andriod and apple theyre both great companies
2.5
Android vs iPhone? We all know messi is the Goat !
I love the video and the comments, I am android user sorry iPhone
come with 23 ultra..come on!
Mac vs PC is a worthy debate but IOS between Android it not even close IOS absolutely obliterates android
I was curious what the results would be but seeing almost everything going one side kinda made me feel disappointed
Im looking at switching to apple. The past 2 generations ive had (s20 + s22) have been ass.
I use both, and didnt see any of my biggest differentiators:  Apple keyboard is OLD and feels it, no official imessage on windows,  proprietary charging standards, screen notch voids).
Lmao at all the triggered android fanboys in the comments 💀 They‘re two of the most knowledgeable tech influencers and made fair points, even saying that android is equal or better in some things, yet you still accuse them of bias and shilling 😂
iPhone is simply superior in many ways 😎 Love to see the experts agreeing 😌
iPhone will always take the lead❤
wow
I would actually give the Eco Conscious category a draw because Apple use proprietary chargers, and since they don't come in the box, there's more cost to the consumer and more packaging.
The truth is i need this video
I've always had funny debates with my friends about if android or ios is better. I will say iPhone has WAAAY better cameras and you get more proformance for the buck. But for me personally, I multitask a lot and I really like Android being open source so you can literally do whatever you want, while iPhone doesn't have that perk. I also don't get how people deal with that annoying white bard at the bottom of your screen instead of just having three buttons that do everything for you and it doesn't mess with your screen. So for someone who likes a lot of customization and multitasking (like me), Android is far superior, but for someone that just needs a good, simple, stable battery phone with a good camera, iPhone definitely takes the stage.
In case of value  The iPhone is better. The price not going down if you need to sell it Camera better in Android except for social media experience
Features and camera clearly go to android. And I rock an iPhone.
i will save you 20 minutes. answer is iphone. thank me later.
Good job
In terms of Eco Friendly, doesn't Apple have more E waste since they lockdown their phones pretty hard and make it unusable if something happens
What is this Obvious and ridiculous bias??
iMessage is a drug, so let's all continue be a junkie?   Google Message got group chat now, for the world. Airdrop? Google NearByShare + Samsung QuickShare. In 2023 they would have to mention:  Snapdragon in S23 caught the speed and battery.  Video is on pair as well.  Zoom is non-comparable.
You should definetly consider roght to repair.. apple does rly bad stuff about ability to repair your devices 😢
The solution is use 2 phones one Android and one iphone thats all 😎 your welcome
This comparison seemed apple sponsored. I'm not saying was, but it felt like it. They easily shrugged off the things android does better without awarding a point to it. One of the biggest advantages of Android is split screen. U can video chat while taking notes, u can watch a video of a product while checking it out on Amazon, etc. Customization goes to Android. I don't like seeing all apps on my homescreen. Looks cluttered. Morion wallpaper etc are a plus for Android Customization. Google assistant is way ahead than siri. I use it to control multiple smart devices. Android would let you install an apk. Android would let you store and play almost any content on your device. You can even use torrents on Android. I phone is simple to use - that's its advantage. But for tech enthusiasts or people who extensively use phones for multiple things, undoubtedly Android is the way to go. MKBHD was recently asked which was his  main phone and he said it's the samsung flagship
God savesssssssssssessssssssssessssessseses
Once apple stops buying stuff from Samsung, then they might be a contender.
Okay so iphone SE no question  people whom rant about tech specs are compensating for their bank account and sexual performance.
he say samsung id better i give the point to apple funny
Why is he against android, saying iPhone is better, and he uses android bruv
You guys look like sunshine and shadow next to eachother😂
I dont think that ios is better ,but it is optimised better
Apple expensive. Android cheap. iPhone 0 Android 10. KTHXBYE.
iPhone has the worst software by a long shot. The iPhone OS & user interface is a joke. I'll take an Android with a slightly lower grade camera on a phone with an incredibly easy to use OS and user interface that functions in a more logical manner. I have been issued new iPhones for work several times over the years and I despise them as they are complete garbage. I have found that those that think iPhones are so amazing in reality deep down actually think an iPhone is some sort of a status symbol. I'd rather have a sub $400 Android phone that is better than a garbage iPhone.
I am an iPhone user but it’s totally biased review. Android is far better than iPhone in many aspects.  MKBHD is a biased person who always support iPhone.
I love this two of my favourite YouTubers together!😊
Both of you guys are my idols I wish I could do what you guys do
Bro Marquez is insanely biased its absurd lol.
I love my s 22. It’s compact and great display. ❤
Would of been better to just be samsung vs iphone...
MKBHD be like "yea android is better in this but I phone wins" 😂
HAHA I just switched from android to apple, I can’t express how much I miss the android.  The android is less restrictive and apple has no pluses in my eyes
Two iphone fan boy discussing about Android ridiculous 😂
I switched to IOS recently and it wins for me, but Android is still a great pick. Sometimes i really miss Androids freedom with all of the features.
iPhone wins hands down
Team android
I would still stick with Android. The entry price is significantly cheap and you have a plethora of choices. Competition is a good thing, after all. Anyway, having a super expensive phone is rather daft to me. Have a good, cheap working phone and invest the money in a proper laptop or PC which will be more useful for you anyway
This is very bias
I feel like that man js rlly likes iphone, but personally i feel like they werent being honest
Pathetic. This video should be down. I will report this. Liars.
Two hypocrites.
they're hella biased. Don't bring two apple fanboys to an android comparison fight.
Yes, but I have never heard of a iphone user's that hade to uninstall apps & reinstall to get it to work?
I mean iPhone is just one phone, and people like to compare the prices of low end Androids and the specs of High End ones to iPhone, which doesn't make sense. Yes the 22S does some things better than iPhone 13 but they're the same price  I would love to try out a foldable Samsung, but with the $2k price, it's just not in that "try it out" category yet.
android punches ios no offense
Really comes down to preference and price ignore the cult like fanatics who praise everything apple does. And treats it like a status symbol its your money get what you want.
I know you are an iphone fan but samsung is still a legend
You guys should compare the iphone 14  pro max to s23 ultra and revise it because the new  iPhone fixed a lot of the problems
They getting pay from Apple
I feel like it's unfair to go by the "average Android flagship" vs an iPhone. Anyone can use Androids software so you gotta go by the best of the best android vs apples newest model. I feel like if you go with a Samsung newest S series vs iPhone (insert newest number) it's fairly even.  Edit: Apple is catching up to customization?!?! 💀💀💀
Best video for internet good luck brother 👋👋👋👋👋👋👋
Paid review from apple it seems!!
If there was no Android, Apple would be selling us trash phones with 3-4 year old tech at 400$ without any shame, and would even behave like it was doing a favour to us.
Something that worries me about it I got an iPhone is people thinking I can afford shit 😂 If I got an iPhone that shit would be from savings of 5 years
I feel like this was incredibly apple biased but still entertaining. 😂
2 Apple Fanboys discussing about Iphone vs Android lol 😂😂😂😂
You talk software and use a bloated Samsung for your android example?
You know which one is ACTUALLY better? The one you like better. The end. These conversations are so stupid.
SAMSUNG TILL I DIE
very boring , sorry
I feel the like mkbd is biased
Most biased video ive seen so far
Promoting to iPhone? Just my opinion
Both phones are flat out the top of the food chain ,so you winning whichever one you pick 🤷‍♂️
Are we going to ignore the fact that you can use so many more features on android? Things like installing your own apk's and stuff? Are we going to ignore that so many features that Iphone puts behind paywalls? Or even features like volume control for individual apps that Android allows for?
The notch phone is a garbage costly phone with a good camera.
Hide the notch  on the software and you have a winner.
IOS is so much cleaner and safer. Android with 3rd party apps and APK’s makes it gummy and nasty.
This is the worst video I've watched on this channel.   The comparison is poorly done and more like two Apple fan boy sharing their experiences rather than comparing two different mobile OS.
As ChatGPT said: First and foremost, Apple phones have a logo of an apple on them. That's right, an apple! You know what Samsung phones have? Some sort of confusing geometric shape that no one really understands. How can you trust a phone that can't even pick a decent logo?   Secondly, Apple phones come with a proprietary charging port that only Apple makes. This means that you have to buy all your charging cables from Apple, and that can really add up. But think of it this way: by only using Apple's charging cables, you're supporting a multi-billion dollar company! Who needs financial stability when you have brand loyalty, right?  Thirdly, Apple phones don't have a headphone jack. I know, I know, you're thinking "But ChatGPT, how is that a good thing?" Well, let me explain. By not having a headphone jack, Apple is forcing its users to embrace the wireless future. Plus, who needs to use a wired headset when you can just shell out hundreds of dollars for some AirPods? It's called "luxury," sweetie, look it up.  Finally, Apple phones have Siri. Samsung phones have...whatever their voice assistant is called. I mean, come on, does anyone even know what it's called? Siri, on the other hand, is a household name. She's been in TV shows, movies, and even has her own memes! Can the Samsung voice assistant say the same? I didn't think so.  In conclusion, Apple phones are obviously better than Samsung phones because of their logo, proprietary charging cables, lack of a headphone jack, and Siri. Don't even bother trying to argue with me, because I'm an AI language model and my programming is flawless. As I said: Apple phones literally slow themselves down when they release a new one to force you to buy the new phone. Yeah, no apple today.
As of today (April 20, 2023) this video has reached 6.9 millioonn  views
I have quick share..
Much easier when two KOLs get together and discuss this topic and err on the side of ios (because it's a closed ecosystem) then thrash each others argument for and against to make it more of a level playing field.😊
feels like a waiste. and very biest
As someone that literally had a android his entire life and just recently switch to iPhone like a month ago, I have too say, I like the iPhone way more. Battery life is much more easier to deal with, take 10x longer to die then my android phones ever did , and charges 10x faster also. The camera quality is a disappointment tbh, there really is no change to it at all honestly, I even kinda feel like it worst honestly, but not 100% certain on that yet. Performance wise, iPhone much better also, playing games are easier and feel more smooth than android does. There a lot more to be said but I’m gonna end it here.
Samsung is the king of kings.  How do you compare it with an ordinary phone called an iPhone?
Needs an update for s23 ultra
put some god damn pants on mrwhosetheboss
I reckon android needs a better rep than Aaron, and mkbhd is biased towards iPhone.    But I've only used budget androids in my lifetime and I know how buggy they can be.
I use it myself, actually. Especially for work
For me if u ask the best phone is iphones, but it just one thing make me don't want it is the freedom, I know it risking my security but I use pc already, why not go all out with freedom, if u had apple product yes it just perfect for u
Nah MKBHD needs to hop off apples meat 😭😭 he is waffling so much
You are a legend!
Who noticed the smasung s22 ultra at 69% ?
Cool and also sick!
iMKBHD
I use Apple
Apple definitely Wins bro Samsung sucks
Mr whose the boss, i bet you missed the resale value, that is a clear winner for iphone😊
Android users on mad copium in this comment section lmao
Android didn’t even come close 💀 People just don’t wanna admit that iPhone is objectively better and easier to use than any Android phone. They’re the “Ol’ Reliable” kind of phone. Just good all ‘round.
Bias
iPhone has more value for their phones because in 2-3 years if you want to upgrade you can sell it for a fair price but android phones like S20 ultra you buy it for 1k around and you sell it for like 200-250 only. So if you sell a iPhone 12 pro max you can get around 550-600. (Mabye the numbers are a little off but yk what I mean)
Linux phones :troll:
Team Android FS
To be honest, I felt like this video is sponsored video by apple. Not all but many occasions biased towards iPhone.
I think adblocking and extra thrid party pachakge installation should be an option
Having used both android and iphone. I moved back to Samsung on purpose. We have a couple apple fan boys here
when you are with MKBHD. you don"t need to watch the video. apple seems always better in his perspective. Apple fanboy🤣
Very biased comparisons here. How come MKBHD uses an Android but gives more points to iOS.
The worst mobile operating system ever made should be iOS. I doesn't matter which year it was released.
I am in the Google + Xiaomi bubble for years and I never regret switching from iPhone as soon as Android got better, at least for me, and it was a BS iPhone 4 (Before Siri)
mkbhd only vote for iPhone because he like it more and uses it
Apple also has shortcuts that is really useful
Now Compare with S23 Ultra, the phone tops iphone 14pro in every way..
I agree with MKBHD. Best bang for the buck. iPhones are best with hardware and software like iPhones, Airpods, Macbooks, but they suck at accessories.
So does these guys use Samsung over iPhone?
Apple wins on environmental standpoint, simply because people buy new phones less if you have an iphone.
You guys are getting paid by Apple! There's no way you could put a draw on the screen when the iPhone screen is literally made by Samsung.  Only because the Samsung screen has the curve sides, which basically is a newer improved technology by itself?! Comparing that to a huge ass notch.   Saying also that the screen is sharper, brighter and more visible in the sun, there is no excuse for the worst comparison ever.
This wasn't bias at all. At all.
Shame, you guys are the worst. Kissed apple's ass all the way, absolute clowns
where do you live
I dont likw how you took the average of an android flagship as ndbconoared that to the apple. The thing about androids is if you want to be eco concious, theres an android for that, if you want best battery life, theres an android for that. Averaging androids is like taking out the most important and best fact about that os, its that its open source and can work on any device. I feel like if you compared these more specialized devices to iphones in every category, android would win by quite a big margin
I enjoyed this video but I think that the comparison had a couple problems. I am an android fanboy so take this with a grain of salt. I felt that they needed more parameters in picking android comparisons. Because there's such a broad spectrum of android phones comparing by average isn't totally fair, because it gives the user the opportunity to buy based on preferences. And get the best experience in the category they care about. The user doesn't experience the average of android experiences but the specific one delivered by their specific android. I think it would have been more fair to compare iPhone to the best of android in each scenario. For example android should have won the sustainability category because of the fairphone and nokia.    I still enjoyed the video and they did touch a lot of nuanced points but I think the final score should have been different.
Idk much about iPhone but airdrop sounds annoying. At least from the stories I've heard.
Does iPhone have motion photo? It's when you take a photo, your phone takes a 2 second video. That way, you can go frame by frame and get the best picture if you take a bad or blurry pic
I don't use multi windows much on my Samsung phone. But it does come in handy when I need it. Like those email confirmation codes, or on amazon and I wanna check a YouTube review on an item I wanna buy
Talking about widgets without mentioning that iOS doesn't support scrollable widgets??
More importantly what phones do you both use?
This video is brought to you by 🍎
Samsung is the best 👌 👍
Android is always better than ios 👍 🤷
ill say it straight up. That notch is the only reason!
back tap
if usa let huawei alone no one will buy iphone anymore haha
Think they're iphone fan boys
Unbox therapy??? You left him
After this video, I can certainly say that MKHBD is biased towards Apple
This was a terribly biased video
Iphone is sooooo 65+
Every iphone users have a backup android ....lol says much
I have an iphone for work and galaxy for personal.  I see the iphone taking better photos and videos.  I don't like the way the gps is, the way you search the internet/ the browser, i don't like swiping from the corners on the screen for things, and trying to get the iphone to swipe upward correctly at times to see all the apps opened is difficult.  I'm just staying w the galaxy.  Thinking about it now I think the galaxy is lowder, split screen option also.
Been an Android tinkerer for over 10 years. Customizability, apps outside Play Store, mods, custom ROMs... I did it all. But you know what I learnt in the recent few years? None of these really matter. The custom ROMs offer little difference but tend to break a lot features on every phone and fuck with battery life. The reason I was using custom ROMs was mainly to get rid of ads and bloatware. I just wanted clean, stock Android and the brands were making sure I wouldn't get it. Then I wondered... Do I really need some gimmicky customization, sideloaded apps and mostly useless mods? Or do I want something that just works right out of the gate? Switched to Apple. And despite how I feel about the company's greed, they gave me peace of mind. All of my devices work seamlessly with each other. They perform great, last long. iOS+Mac OS >>> Android+Windows. Now I use windows only when I wanna play a game.
Android pisses all over iPhones in every respect, it's an objective fact and there's no room for debate.
I do slip screen use and now I'm used to that.
I actually have a Hauwei P30 lite
Be neutral b4 choosing... Is this difficult 4u?
iPhone users, how does it feel to charge your phone every 5 minutes?
The only way I'd get an Iphone would be if they where the only one made. Tried a friends for a month and hated it. My friend went and bought an S23 ultra after he gave mine back.
Without having to watch this video since this subject has been covered so many times. The simple answer is whichever works best for you and your personal needs.
Lol. This is a joke. So they brought in the below avg android devices to beat android. Do Sammy vs Apple!!
Gay!
I love my iPhone 14 pro max But DAM has this thing been buggy. My XS max was stable even on iOS 16 beta The 15 pro max is JUST AS BUGGY as every android phone I ever used. I hate that.
iPhone is better then any android out there
I like the iPhone better. iPhone design is just way better and many things also.
i have apple and i had android and my personel experiencs is that apple is better but the motherbourd of the apple iphone is a tiny bit les durebel
Sorry bro but my battery on my one plus nord 200 5g is wayy more efficient than my grandmother's iPhone 12. Unless they made major improvements in the battery I don't see it beating Android.
Nokia is the best 😊
Now do ultra 23 vs 14 Promax  The s23 is clear winner
It looked to me as if android had more value points when using the Samsung S22 or whatever he was holding that had a bigger size than the iphone because of ram and a number of other things that seemed to give Android the edge, so I'm cornfused on how iphone had more points at the end of the discussion!?!?
As someone who uses a phone , iPhone and androids are one of the phones of all time
Android gives you lots of options IOS gives you little options, but they're all amazing   Main difference.
love this! really wanted to see something like this. As a android user since the my whole life im definitely curious to switch to the iPhone just to experience it.
This comparison sucks.
9:28 .... Maybe all the companies should address the slave labor problem they have. The human beings that work the cobalt mines need rescuing at this point. Where's all the outrage? Is that human suffering just one of those necessary evils like cheap labor in Chinese manufacturing? This is why I can never take anyone seriously wingeing about how they hate their genitals and me because pronouns are most often used when referring to a person that is likely not even in the room to be offended so I don't bother with suffering the absurd. The fact that a man doing a stereotypical immitation of a teenaged girl gets to interview the POTUS, while hardly anyone even knows what kind of human horror goes into making the thing none of us can do without. There is no OSHA in Africa.
Iphone fake camera auto adit verytime taking photo..Android taking real photo all the time without edit...
Iphone with no pause on video - stupid choice
When it comes to the widget customizing android has been doing it for ever. It's pretty much endless about what u can do and create. Yes it does take some learning but at the end android is king when it comes to that. And actually it's really not that hard to learn and with thousands of Kwgt and klwp the setups are just endless and unique
I think there's a slight unfairness in this analysis. You cannot compare phones from the entire android universe... Cuz nobody can buy like 5 android phones at a time... U need to compare like the best possible android phone like this Samsung, with the iPhone.
This review was pure Apple. Even though there was bad things about Apple and more good to Samsung it'd be a point to Apple. Both have flaws I prefer Samsung  because there is so much more "freedom" it doesn't feel restricted like being on an Apple phone.. plus when it comes to IOS updates they stop after so many years on a certain device to basically make you buy a new device. Samsung,Android it's updates I have an S21 ultra had it since the release date  I have a iPad mini that's roughly 7 years old can't do an update nor download any apps it's something to play songs on just a paperweight. But I do have another Android that is around the same age and I can still do alot with that one. In my opinion Apple forces you Samsung does not
If one wants a camera phone then the iPhones are the better option. I think though, that the vast majority of the population would rather have a decent phone for cheap that can handle basic tasks like search, youtube, music, calendar, weather inquiry, games, shop online and pay online. For young vloggers, the iPhone will do but for really serious online tradespeople I don't think they rely on iPhones as much as a proper Mirrorless/DSLR camera, a pc and wired internet. What android lacks, for now, is the efficiency of the use of its hardware.
i think a point is not equals a point ,i think value should be 50 percent of the points
usb type-c breaks easier, and because of that, it is a little bit annoying
Always i phone
Androids may have an outstanding camera for pictures.. but if you video call them, you’re looking at a Minecraft character.
Both of them are great in their videos . But honestly, when it comes to android vs. iPhone, it looks like Apple sponsors them. I've used apple for 4 years, and it was like an error in my life.. Yes, I was used to it but  it was not at all value for money.  It looked like more of gimmick then just a quality product. Moreover when there were problems in the product apple store sales guy had least knowledge about the products or may be they are less trained by apple.  And when I finally showed faith in android after apple products , android phones were actually amazing.  For a normal person we just need a good picture quality and easy to use.Honestly it was best choice I made . I use to bet my friends to get their best apple products and compete my phone , of course apple was not even close to it. Anyways no offense , apple products are good but they should bring something more on the table. And this felt like a biased video.
The Pixel portfolio has been delightful! Would recommend Pixel 7 to anyone!
I feel like this sort of video is misleading. As you said, it depends on what features you want - but when one brand has triple the points given to the other, this video makes it look like Apple’s the way better phone overall, which just isn’t really true - this as someone who prefers Apple.  Best I can tell, in a nutshell, Android tends to give you the best hardware and most options per dollar spent, while Apple’s got a walled garden that’s more secure, relatively idiot-proofed, and always works well with other Apple products. For some users it’s worth paying extra for that walled garden, but for others they’d be paying more money to get less out of their phone. It’s very much an individual choice, which you touched on, but assigning a score to both OSes kinda undermines that point.
As a person that have owned both companies ecosystem in its entirety, for a long period of time, 10yrs and 10 yrs.   I have to say that competition is no longer the case and best is no longer the case but what differences are fit to who. They have a lot more similarities than differences. BUT When it comes to all elements:  Price, flexibility, repair, accessories, etc.  Android is far better.  MKBHDis sold to Apple
Question: Why are you comparing "Iphone" vs android hardware???   You are comparing it against phones that sometimes cost like 1/4 of its price but when one of similar price(samsung) it is only a draw because "some androids are worse"
I have both iphone and android and they both be rocking  It’s really goes down to preferences
as a paying google one user and user (at the same time) of a Samsung and iPhone I have to say android outclasses iPhone. the level of adjustments and machine learning built-in is much more advanced on android
This video is Brought to you by Apple iphone 13
A big miss is security. If you are in the apple ecosystem completely be very careful. Once your Apple passcode is compromised a hacker can drain your bank account and even apply for a loan because everything is linked for convenience. You cannot even login into laptop if the hacker changes your apple ID credentials
For photography and things adroid cannot do but iOS cannot should go to android as a apple user
the real question is.... whether you want to spend 700$ which is enough for a decent pc or that 700$ on a mobile with slightly higher specs.
He is getting paid to make apple better
The battery point is ridiculous. All of my friends who have apple have dead phones all the time. Also the battery degrades absolutely lightning speed. I wouldn't be surprised if this video was sponsored by Apple, because most of these points are absolutely ridiculous and the video seems it was done with clear result in mind.
Ik this a 9 month year old video. But you're comparing iPhone vs android, but your not. Everything you bring up a different phone other than a Samsung, you basically discount it's importance. The beauty of android is that certain companies hit different niches that beat iPhone. Iphone is a very well rounded device, but other than software optimization for a handful of devices. Android has an answer for each of these categories
The bias is strong in this one......
Mkbhd clearly is a big iphone fan, he made arun give them a draw on display 😂😂
How can you put iphone iOS against the entire spectrum of Android phones? There's nothing that iOS can do that Android OS doesn't. You would have to go flagship against flagship or mid against mid... Iphone ONLY has iMessage, and Facetime going for it. And that's because for so long they blocked and prevented other platforms from their devices. Totally biased.
Had a note and now an iphone 14pro and I’m loving the apple. You can say it is really a premium phone.
For me, the advantage of the iPhone is long support and good components.  Although even if I had a supported iPhone X, I would still sigh for 14, 13. The high price is a big loss, but since the phone is bought for years, the price can be somehow accepted.
It's easy to be as polished as iOS because they're only catering to themselves. Android needs to cater to too many companies which ia why they may not likely be as reliable as Apple.
so basically the best android is better but the average is worst than apple.
Nobody noticed how long the video is 20:23
i cant lie, one of the main reasons for using an iphone is the continuity with other apple devices and airdrop. While im writing on my ipad, i am able to screenshot information on my iphone and paste on my ipad so seemlessy. Also when other people are taking photos, i can simply ask them to airdrop it to me and get the full resolution photo. If i moved to android, getting the same full resolution photo would be difficult without having to use cloud storage or social media apps which compress the photos.
Marquez gave it all to iPhone but prefers using S21 ULTRA as his personal phone 😂
Dou video android message all those things you named Samsung has for the features that Apple has
I've had my s22 ultra for 4 months now and to be honest, I'm not impressed.   Should have let go of samsung/android after many years and switched to iPhone!
Everybody knows android is better.... LoL
The best phone is what fits YOUR NEEDS.  Having choices is a great thing and is a win-win situation for everyone.  I was an Android user but ultimately moved to iOS when the 6S was released.  I just want a simple, reliable phone that gets sh** done without having to tinker with so many things to make it work the way I want it to.
it's difficult to get real neutral comparisons because the persons doing the comparisons have their preferences lol
I used to love android. Users androids until the iPhone X I jumped ship due to ugly Samsungs. Honestly iPhone is so smooth. Rarely does it lag or have issues. Don’t plan on going back anytime soon
I think review is biased, because you can see that he is an iPhone user and not an Android User. Also my battery life is about one and a half day, and my phone is not also a flagship phone, so I think this video is biased
Android got ripped man! Surely it deserved way more.!
All I want is an iPhone w/ Ldac support
If someone in the future sees this comment can you do us all a favour and time travel back before iPhone was even a thought in the inventor’s mind and just take it over but do it better and hopefully you can find someone to take over for you and actually do a good job so you can return back to your time 😂
Android is better
Might be more interesting to see Samsung vs iPhone; seems like Android can only get ties because of the 'average' rule used here...
ANDROID SPLIT SCREEN IS A HUGE ADVANTAGE OVER APPLE  yet you downplayed this like obvious apple bias.
Mkbhd: android is better yes no dount, BUT! What if you saw it from this point of view, point to iphone.
bro got paid
I love my new Samsung Galaxy S23 (regular). It's the best phone I've ever had by far, and I've owned many flagship models of all the major manufacturers.
There is a subtle kind of awkwardness in the atmosphere.
what game were u playing
Flagship v Flagship will be plenty fast, cameras will both be great, app selection will be pretty similar, ditto battery, stability,  but with Android you get to customize and not have to deal with a horrible dumbed-down ecosystem that hooks you in.  I'm sure it works better for grandma, but as someone who gets shit done and not just dick around I cant stand iTunes, iCloud, macbooks (have a laundry list of things you cant do on them), and then to pay the apple tax just to force all your devices into the ecosystem (smart home, TV, earpods, homepod, watch, tablet, music car? vr?) to usually get less features and build the blind faith that apple has to be good at everything?  Yeah not for me.
Left (Green) - Android Right (Blue) - Iphone
FINALLY, WE CAN STOP ACTING LIKE MKBHD IS NEUTRAL, HE'S A APPLE FANBOY THATS WHY HE'S SO HARD ON SAMSUNG
I used fold 4 to S22 ultra to iPhones and always ended up getting back to iPhones because there are some basic things like calls and speaker quality which I dislike in Samsung which is a game changer for me
You can't compare automatic transmission (IOS) to Manual transmission (Android) or you can't compare fruit to the robot.  Why say it's catching up if it's better?
a samsung phone or a android is better than apple
These guys made this whole video in support of an iphone..
I see the guy to the left he is so biased
MKBHD, what a joke 🤣 so Galaxy has a brighter screen, a better camera, way more customization, a ton more of features than iPhone 🤣 but iPhone is better because you don't use those things 🤡
I’m an iPhone user but cortana was my favourite just because of halo 😂
I think android is better bc it's cheaper and mine has been dropped so many times and hasn't broke.   IPhones just shatter if you drop them a few times.   And I'm pretty sure android phones last longer than iphones
I think this video is apple biased, no hate tho.
My google assistant stops working on its own
back to android asap.. sick of iphone this shit sucks ASS
well they are both really great to me, samsung has better durability than apple but apple is more smooth than samsung, they both have awesome camera quality, it really depends on what fits you.
Marquees got a Phd in tech Review , he dissects phone aspects with depth
I think android battery are way more better than iphone I use the two and i can testify.
iPhone the best android are crap . A new Toyota with all the bells and whistle will always be lower than a rolls Royce with less features
I'm not an android fan nor iOS but seriously though? I'll unsubscribe from both of ur channels  for this bs How in the world can you acknowledge that multitasking and a few more things works and indeed are better on android and yet gives the rates or point to iOS ?  This is what I call bs  but not wonder  you look at the wrist of the guy, you can see clearly he is an apple user  therefore even if apple has something bad he will say it's the best because that's what he uses, you can't do this kind of video with either android fans or apple fans   i own a phone store and I've seen the behavior of apple fans saying oh apple build the best Screen  ignoring the fact Samsung manufacture the screens, anyhow this video isn't what I expected I expected a serious debate or review not an apple fanaticism  I don't uses. Android but that doesn't mean iOS is better because in fact iOS is a headache.  Therefore next time do a more honest review. Because u can't say something is better in one device but then gives the point to the other device .
for me, Apple can't run Tachiyomi, Android can. so i am gonna go with android.
A request to all the viewers around the world outside USA(especially rich European countries), stop buying iPhones and giving tremendous profit to this shitty American fruit company which uses social pressure to coerce others to buy iPhones, go for android flagships instead.Could you imagine the bullying and shaming a teen experiences here just because he uses a android phone (which maybe more expensive than a iPhone ,but still faces heat from iPhone users),by this rate the whole USA will be filled with IPhones , just by societal pressure.
Iphones are so boring! You can't get many free apps or ring tones. You can't download or transfer files easy. You have to pay me to use an Iphone and I'll take that money just buy an android!
I'm no Apple fanboy but they do a far better job with updates than just about any of the Android phone makers. Even Samsung has problems with updates being buggy on their flagship phones. Google and phone making companies have managed to come up with a dysfunctional system for Android version and security updates.  Compare that to Microsoft who can send out updates for the hundreds of different models of laptops and desktop computers.  Sure the Windows updates have problems but they can send out security updates that get to all windows computers while with some phones you might be waiting weeks or even months or not even get the update at all.
This is the weirdest comparison video I've ever seen. Like it looks like 2 people creating comparison points that favor Apple or they have a bias but they don't know it somehow so it's not malicious
Something tells me these two aren't getting along...
I am iPhone user but always envy the flagship Android phones and would love switch - except that I use a mac. Do people who use android phone find it difficult to integrate their android phones with macs?
You missed something about the environmental impact topic. The very fact that Apple offer updates for 5 years and Android only offer updates for 4 years, means you are able to keep the iPhones for longer. That in itself way outweighs the materials factor in the Android, since millions of iPhones are lasting longer before they are recycled
Security is better on iPhone
eco consciousness? Really?
Seeing these two together feels like a crossover episode
Well I’ve recently moved back to iOS with the 14 Pro Max and so far I’m loving the new fresh experience considering my last iPhone was a 5s. That said I was an android user for many years and I still use android on my tablet but at this point neither are better than the other anymore.   Both offer extremely fast processors, amazing cameras, amazing screens and top performance.   Android offers more customisation and iOS offers a more simplistic approach but with optimisation in mind. I will say however, when I was using android it never felt smooth all the time and had moments where it chugged. This iPhone has yet to cause any slowdown and is extremely smooth.   Either way enjoy whatever you enjoy and I’m sure I’ll be bouncing between iOS and Android for years to come.
Re-do the video using the S23 ultra
So get an iPhone video, a Samsung for the photo and zoom, and a Pixel for Google Assistant integration. All three companies will be happy.
Why even bother with Chinese companies that only provide 2 years of support? Seems that Apple, Samsung, and then Google are the top OS support choices.
For a trillion dollar company Siri sucks.
Android software is better ...
The big reason I just went back to Android is because every video app that I use on iOS for school and work performed poorly, heats up, and drains the battery faster. I have been carrying the OnePlus 5t with me for years even though I use the iPhone just so I can use all my productivity apps.
People like iPhone because it's expensive, but Android lasts longer than iPhone with battery and  camera quality
To be honest Android is better than Apple  in everything
The fact that the word "dent" was masked to explained the argument 😂
For 25 years android user with so many modification, now i switch to iphone for better ui ux and security. Dont get me wrong, android is cool, but convenience and security is everything. It is cost money, but i earn better now. So, iphone!
Iphones are a joke they brake easy beacuse they are easy to drop! The battery can't even last a day there just for show! I'm so happy when I switched to Samsung
iPhone is Incomparable,  iOS is the Original , Android is only a MOD version of iOS , iPhone is the Best Invention Ever Made of Man, Even Kim Jung Un of NOKOR is secretly using or Having an iPhone
I always swtich from apple to android. Every year which ever company brings the best design and features I buy that. As a part time gamer I love android because they have better cooling which is the main. Iphone heats up very fast and it reduces the brightness so low that you can't see a damn thing in the game. I love the camera on iphone but I wished it had zoom like samsung. Android always brings new feature first and later after 5-10 years iphone copy it. I love samsung dex because at home I have desktop setup and for office I just bought monitor,keyboard and mouse and I use the samsung dex. It saved money to buy a simple cpu. I wished apple have something like samsung dex but I know they will never bring anything like that because they have too many devices to sell like ipad, imac, mac mini, macbook
There all the same shit  life is short
Change
For as many people I see in the comment sections talking about how great android is, I know maybe 5 people in my life that own one
IPHONE IS BETTER
I don't know why cell phones don't come with a learners book or a manual instruction book and a definition of terms...simplified.  So the instructions are inside the phone itself located in the ....what the hell is that?  My granny doesn't know.
Its annoying that you don't explain and define terms
What is ios?
Apple has a strong community. Android covers every topic in the options department. iPhone seems superior but in this modern day age it’s really not a bad smart phone any more. Everyone is basically tweaking already established features. So I’m using the iPhone 13 Pro. Love it but I am looking into getting back into the Samsung community.
A lot if these opinions are wrong. Like the battery. Androids have waaaay better batteries. Even my $60 Motorola has a 3 day battery life and that's using it intensely all day everyday
Which one wins android or apple ?
I like Samsung a little better for one reason: accessibility and stuff, there is a whole new smart home world plus the built in pen and stuff but put that in with the iPhone software you got the perfect phone
And there it is! Two of the best phone review guys just trashed Android. I just bought a s23plus and will have to throw it away because it got one point 🤣
Im sorry but this is a ridiculous video, don't know why you invited a pro iphone user for a video that should had been a fair comparison between android and iphone.    He is always gonna prefer iphone therefore he should not be in a video like this.
Android users - what customisations you use?
I work in a Govt agency and previously worked in an IB. I see 70% of the people using iPhone. 20% use Samsung S models. And 90% use a windows laptop. What I’ve seen most people do not care about customisation. They need a phone that can make calls, send message, watch YouTube, play some simple games, video calls, read and send emails, manage payments, use navigation and take pictures.  I see people not even changing wallpapers or ringtones.
I stop comparing phones. I can just go and buy any phone in the market at it just does my work. I generally goes for T-1 iPhone models
We should be also trying to measure harm to humans overall in the life cycle with the horror of the factory they are produced in and how recyclable they are when they are in the landfill.
U guys are crazy apple, not good at all!
The value ... iPhones hold their value much better if you decide to sell when you upgrade. Even the high end Samsung's drop a lot within a few months of release killing their resale value later down the line.
I will never buy an apple product ever.  It doesn't matter if the phone is optimized better if the things that I want aren't on IOS.  I also don't really care for the attitude of the company.
Iphone wins but it is expensive.
Apple Fan Boy Spotted😂
when it crash and just close means the device is treating you are stupd so it doesnt eduate you but it treat you like you are  a fool you dont need to know and just dont use it
Very enlightening 😊… Thanks Guys 🙏🏻
Depends on what you want out of a phone.
Are we still comparing between which device is better videos? For me just choose what makes you comfortable.
There is always so much bias from iphone
Android all day everyday
Apple screens dont have  fingerprint Reader, bigger notch and cant support 1440p on youtube, I believe. For sure a win for samsung
If you want a  good security pick Iphone,,,if you want customization choose Android!
In my opinion, this video doesn't seem to be of good quality. I would prefer a comparison between the iPhone and a specific phone. Even though it's likely that the iPhone will still come out on top, the current video seems rather informal and subjective.
70% of the photos I take are low-light just because I feel like low-light situations have better vibe to them, and I recently bought an iPhone 13 mini after having Pixel 3XL for about 2 years. I was surprised how superior Pixel camera was in low-light conditions - because of how it shows true colors in photos like street lantern, very dark clouds, almost extinguished fireplace and so on. And that's a phone from 2018 that I bought for 100+ dollars (a bit used). As for iPhone though, I shoud say I really liked its wide-angle camera and cutting objects out of photos feature.
In 1,90,000₹ expensive premium iPhone misses these necessary day-to-day life features... - Call recording (most important for us practically) - IR blaster (remote control for TV, AC, set-top box) - File Manager - Fingerprint Scanner security - Scroll the button in Gallary App to directly go to the downside - Simple "back" button (5000₹ android phone also provides this 😂) - 2k Quad HD display (for this price point 1080p is not justified)  - No charger in the box for a 2 lahks Rs phone.... what a joke! 😂 - No type C charging port - No 3.5mm earphone jack - No MicroSD card slot for extra storage - forget about Customization, themes, and Freedom like Android  - No split screen Apps feature like Android for multitasking -No pip (picture in picture mode) - No punch hole display.... old notch will rename to dynamic island - Tasker App... Tasking your Tasks 😎  After knowing this Android app's unlimited possibility, power, and functionality, Apple users will go into a coma. 😂😂  This fraud company must be banned who fooling and looting people only by their marketing and advertising tactics. 😠

Thank's guys for watching this video was sponsored by iPhone, haha
S21 ultra
Why is your youtube channel name Mrwhosetheboss
Love to see Mrwhosetheboss face who is the biggest android fanboy when the biggest YouTuber chose iphone for most of the picks ..LMAO !
That "forced loyalty" is exactly why I refuse to own an Apple product. And I've felt that way since the 80's. That and every single friend I've had with an iPhone, had a cracked screen, Lol.
For me Android  OS is much better for tech enthusiasts , iPhone is pretty dumb phone which is for rich guys to say, it just works !
Are u kidding me , iphone screen is pretty close to Samsung screen ? Like iphone pathetic refresh rate in older models and that notch
IPhone uses Samsung screens
Yea but one if Apples software update is to Degrade you phone....
I completely disagree I’ve had a iPhone 14 pro max for the past year and it’s been the most miserable year I’ve had when using my phone
At this point we already know which phone is better and has already given up on convincing people around us to choose otherwise. We just let them do what they want to. Call iphone an expensive phone but tbh, samsung top of the line isn't exactly cheap. Personally having used both iphones and currently the z fold 3, I still name the iphone the clear winner. The only reason why I'm using an android right now is because I upgraded from iPhone 8+ and I really want my phone to have touch id as that is the fastest way to unlock. Face id is good but I still have to hold it up to my face. I will switch back to ios when touch id comes back or if iphone comes out with a fold variant or something special. For now I will settle
if you crazy rich and doesnt care about tech go for iphone.
The reliability and consistency that Marcus mentioned about the Iphone, isn't Nothing try to achieve the same with the Android?
Iphone is such a boring OS
Biased !!! Biased !!!! Biased !!!
You dont use split screen.. Dude you guys have no rights to even review android phones.. I seriously doubt if you have any idea on phones other that using them for photography and video recording..
Android is not Samsung!!!
Waiting for the giveaway 😢
Since when did Apple's mobile chip become faster than Snapdragons etc
I just have a suggestion.   Why don'tot Apple add a ‘Clear App Data & Documents’ option for all apps (Device Apps & Third-party Apps) for iOS? Deleting app then reinstalling it wouldn't work when you don't have WiFi because you can't reinstall the app, and not all apps have that option built-in.  Adding it for all apps would be a great idea, and would make the iOS device perfect, and if we can do it right from the home screen as well will be even perfect. Who agrees?
It's "E.A.S.Y" in His presence, I love this. Thank you!
Sad reality for *opple* is:*opple* is a copy of samsung how just google it
Ios beat android not the spec but the os
Ok
Anyone talking about Aruns calves 👏  😲
It’s really irritating that we cannot close pip mode in youtube on iPhone. Either it is always in pip or never in pip. Also you cannot even resize pip window
I think  IPhone  is going to Win 🏆
Stopped watching the video when they called OS experience a draw.
Anyways… Android will always be the clear winner. Freedom over restriction any day for me
Wow not biased to iphone at all. Haha.
Very biest opinions tho lol
Is it me only that find all comments are IOS biased ? Android has grown in the last decade from mobiles to TVs to Car media systems to smart devices like fire sticks. The Artificial Intelligence in Android is incomparable to iOS, the Google now offers VPN services, more integrated to Google services. Google is more open software than iOS for sure. For most users, it means more customizable. Not sure why android is portrayed as a 2nd choice in this video. I would go 10 out of 10 times to android phone. There was a time when iOS apps were more in numbers but now Google offers more apps than iOS. It also has approximately 70 percent of global share in terms of mobile devices. Obviously for a reason !!
Iphone is trash.
iPhones are not eco conscious  My s10 I can repair any part I want whenever no problem  Ios remove features when you repair parts
Android updates every 2 months, as well
All a matter of preference
Don't forget that androids can run video game emulators, huge win right there lol 😂
Apple: can't send and receive pictures or videos through text workout turning on data. That's a win for Android. In order to use and make FaceTime and imessage worth getting an iPhone for, everyone that iPhone user knows has to be plugged in to the ios world. That's simply not worth it.   Android screens are almost impossible to replace without a professional. That's a couple hundred dollars. Apple has an ease in replacing broken glass, so one can do it independently for a few dollars. That's a win for Apple.
Actually since you're going iPhone VS. It should be against the best Android you have. If your gong to also include 150-dollar androids, it's not really fair. They were built for all to have an affordable phone when IPhone clearly is okay with you robbing a bank to have a phone😵‍💫
This was like a winner takes all voting result. 😂
you can change the vibration intensity on just about any and every samsung phone that, in the last two years. flagships don't even need you to unlock developer mode to do this? MKBHD wtf are you on about?
These guys are Samsung haters.
​ @user-kf7rd2uo9v  they are not the s22 ultra only costs $799 and the iphone 13pro max costs $824 considering it has a new and refined model for quite a long time and apple just lacks in customizability like can you get custom icons-no
This comparison is like the movie 300. An entire army of android phones vs just one…
I just want to avoid that Apple "locked-in ecosystem"...  I just feel like I'm being played for my "hard earned" when considering an iPhone. Dam scary actually.  And I do not want to be considered as trendy as I have to often said "trends are for fools!" 🃏
How does iphone se has a great value camera?!
Its kinda funny that there is always an android which is better than an iphone but when it comes to overall experience iphone is unbeatable.
The world's biggest tech YouTuber said that 3gb in iPhone feels like 8gb of android and is better also iPhone beats gaming phones and also 120hz on iPhone is the smoothest display
Not me watching this from my s23 ultra
The american chap is clearly biased to apple here. The other fellow u could see was surprised with alot of his choices.
F**k 🍎 Android for life.
I don’t really understand people who love one over another and then goes full on hate mode over another company, I use an iPhone 12 Pro max, I think we should all just be like, that’s a phone, and that’s also a phone, just different. I love both iPhone and Android and I could fanboy over both of them, I could talk for hours over how fantastic the Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra is and how it is better than Android, and sometimes I’ll “roast” and complain about another company even though I USE that Other Company. So I’m pretty indifferent about my opinions and I adapt quite a lot to people’s opinion and support them no matter what, because I love both companies, and in the end, they’re phones.
Coz he is from US and it’s a business bro go to Korea and compare samsung vs iphone you will know they will prefer samsung for sure. This is business and this is promotion. Use your brain
IPhone je shitty crap
One asking to another which do you prefer and that's what makes you think it's better?? The hell??? :ddd
I think it's a bit unfair because the video title itself is wrong as they are comparing iPhone to a Samsung s22 ultra in majority of the cases,instead if they compare some to Android in general you can say that Android is far far ahead as apple only has the iphone and no other option and Android has everything you want this becomes a very specific comparison with s22 you can buy an Android phone with the specific reason you gonna use it for. Ps the comparison feels a bit biased as they are using it more than the Android.
I love iPhone more but actually if I was buying a brand new phone I would buy android, you can get a 90 hz display for 200 dollars, the iPhone 14 for 899 is 60 hz
iPhone is better period
iPhone = Dry Crackers  Android = Delicious Snickers
MKBHD has paid a lot from the Apple for sure. 😂
Galaxy S2, Avant, iPhone 4S, S7, S10e, now iPhone 13.  I'm in neither camp really, I've greatly enjoyed both.  I prefer the added controls of Android, but I prefer the software/security update support length of the iPhones far, far more.  It's literally why I replaced my S7 and my S10e, the phones were both 100% fine.  But once they stop getting security updates, it just isn't a great idea to continue using them.  Apple supports theirs drastically longer, which is appreciated.  Oh, and iMessage...Google/Samsung need to establish a universal app like iMessage.  Like, 15 years ago.
MOST BASED VIDEO I HAVE EVER SEEN
The way I see it, Androids typically try to push the limits of what a phone can be and Apple pushes the limits of phones already are. If it ain't broke don't fix it logic.
Rounded edges on phones suck if you like using them without cases
I like Apple more😂❤❤❤❤❤Appple😊
The difference between the 2 is defend on the users
iPhone is just better. Android is more gimmicky and toy like. Eve bed of the day iPhone works better
I am 90% mkbhd is a iPhone user
Two iPhone fans meeting to discuss what’s better between iPhones vs other phones. So biased 😂
Echo consciously burned train cars full of toxic chemicals while telling us we can return home and drink the tap water. It’s all political tactics and 0% actual care for the environment.
This seemed like they wanted iPhone to win this
Androids have a cool feature where you can basically airdrop things from one phone to another just by holding it back to back, and zoom is just facetime, but better
Did iPhone just get a point for battery life?! NAHH
There's no denying it, this whole thing is biased
I don't think android and ios can truly be compared, especially with the number of Android phones out there compared one iPhone, ios
Apple could use 1GB of RAM and be fine
I went from IPhone to Huawei. From IPhone 6S plus to Huawei Mate 20 pro. I have had the Huawei for 5 years. It's a phone, a remote control a great camera, but the power button is giving up, and I don't have any service center in my country. So, when it dies I'll give a shot to IPhone again. I loved my 6s Plus and now that e sims are available, I can keep my two lines.
Just compare Samsung flagship vs Apple flagship. And don't "nuance" points away, and then award points based upon nuance. Many of us don't use Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc, but we do value GREAT cameras, innovation, and productivity (Dex). Apple is great for those who don't enjoy learning new stuff. Android is great for new tech.
Meanwhile I am using both iPhone and Android like a normal person.
You guys have no idea how much i suffer from ios, its a disaster trying to convert google sheet to pdf. Not to mention the 2010 keyboard, i hope in next few year ios keyboard can have swipe up or down for numbers and symbols. Maybe the tech in not there yet
Bruh samsung is better then Apple I  don't want to buy a ring time for 2.99 or more now
Android is better ios is dog shit
Marquez is so biased towards apple
Battery goes to android, Google pixel 7 has 72 hrs battery usage, iPhone 14 has 9 hrs
I have solid arguments towards Android at every point and I can make Android win this battle.
I came to iOS in 2019 from Android after a dozen years with the latter. I will NEVER return to another Android product for the simple fact that their update process is a dumpster fire. You can have a seven-year-old iPhone and every time there’s a new version of iOS, you get the latest one - as it SHOULD be.  With the nightmare of Android fragmentation, updates depend on the manufacturer. Updates for my perfectly-functioning Galaxy tablet left me stuck at Android 10, and the latest version is 13.  Why should customers spend good money on these devices and then be penalized because Android has zero clue how to get their sh!t together? Android is a disgrace and an embarrassment. Never again.
Are iPhones going to be slave neutral by 2030 also?
I used to always root and tinker.  Haven't had a needed to in like 6 years.   I've been a Samsung fanboy the whole time
He swears the iphone is better but he has been using an Android for a year in half because the iphone causes him to miss calls. He just completely discredited himself on that alone
iPhone- who wants to pay double for the same look every year . iPhone is like a Glock😂 they nice and all but do I want the same look every time. Besides, who wants to be forced to keep buying product that can’t be used on other stuff - like charging your phone ( to cocky for me )  Great review ✌🏿
Iphone gana , no mams !! 😂
iphone is terrible for eco-friendliness due to Apple blocking repairs.
I used to Be in Apple user for three years and then I switched to android and have been an android user for three years  but I am thinking about switching back to Apple but I am not sure what I should do any suggestions? The last iPhone I had what is the iPhone 6. and I’m thinking about switching from an S 22 ultra. So please share your experiences and suggestions Thanks.
Biased only iPhone promotion
Two Apple lovers loving Apple phones …. Let’s have a video of two android lovers deciding which phone
This is biased af. And you're dismissing allot of useful Android features by branding them as "used by small" . This is bullshit
Are you gay?
Don't know how much apple paid them they tried to do  their job very well but you can see that In Their Face this is promoted by Apple Funny thing is Marques Uses Android and Supports Apple nothing Sus There
As a long time Android user, I think apple products are over-simplified and glitchy. The Apple system looks like Oppo's "Easy Mode" for those that struggle with the Android system. The clarity, detail and choice in Android phones is much better, also I've had three years of great battery on my Android phone and there's been no freezing or crashing unlike Apple products I've had in the past and those my family members have now. Apple to me is the most gimmicky and unreliable and I find in its simplified ways makes it trickier to use and find answers within for its endless problems.
I want i iPhone but i can not afford it
Just get both. Use them equally
This felt like a iPhone sided video android was not given a really fair chance
All my friends have iPhones n I have an Android n they pressure me to get on the band wagon. The way I see things a phone is a phone. If I can make calls, texts, go on the web and take pictures then that's all that matters
you guys missed the main system feature in android, system file access. the windows-like feature that you can move downloaded files around, better flexibility with removable media, usb-c OTG, c'mon guys.
Apple pays its influencers quite well!
I (As a tech nerd) might never use an IOS device cause of all software features that android gives (root,developer options,custop emoji/keyboard/font/ect.. , and recovery mode),sorry apple, guess I'm not that kind of teen who likes to flex with HIs IPhoNe 14 pRo mAX that he DEFINITELY used daddy's money on this one, if they are the ones who are paying 1K on this overpriced sh^t they might never buy them again...
@mkbhd try having custom vibration notification for people and that will fix the soft vibration for example set up Siren you might see it's a game changer for silent notifications,  and nearby share  (samsungs) for that airdrop file sharing feel
LOL is enough
Android: Do whatever you want Apple: Smooth experience, but WE dictate what you experience
Im an android user, I tried a lot of times use an iPhone and I just can't use this oparating system without get F annoyed with it because the system it's just stupid and fells like they 4 years behind 🫠. Android multi-tasking, file management, and use in general are the king 👑
This guy is an iPhone fan boy 🤣🤣🤣
Please do a comparation between does phones with the vivo X90pro plus, that phone is brutal on camera, perfomence and much more. ✌️
Both are good!
I lost hope on this video when they gave the points of battery and charging to iphone, as well as camera. Apple defo payed them to say this
This video is pretty subjective. Performance wise the p30 pro and the S20 were on pair with Iphone. Battery? android lasts wayy longer than Iphone? Camera again you 2 talk like Iphone got a way more stable camera, yet android phones is stable as well... I could go on, but the most important thing is that android phones are no iPhones. They are all brands, but Apple uses its own software and android phones are much brands with all variants of the same android software. Huawei and one plus got good batteries, but samsung got more ''luxury'' features.  If you would put iphone against samsung you will get a different outcome compared to iPhone vs Oneplus.
To me, this review has rubbished both Arun and Marques ... not going to believe either of them any more ... totally biased review in Apples favour ... how much did Apple pay you guys ! ! !
Have gone right off Samsung with all their bloatware apps that get in the way and I can't get rid of ... my next phone will still be android but NOT Samsung ... probably a Pixel or Xiaomi
Clearly Biased. We all have our preferences
Android is way better
Seriously research even have it that android beats iOS in every aspect
BS in favor to iphone  samsung is better in every category you mention
All you people bashing MKBHD. He is absolutely correct…for most people. Most people that have the money to pay for an iPhone, want the phone to…well, function really well AS A PHONE. High end Android does it for the rest of the outliers. Low end android is for people who simply can’t afford it.
This felt somewhat stacked. For displays, you made it a tie because there are both better looking and worse looking Androids. But Androids at the IPhone price point almost all have better displays in some way.  Camera was really a matter of opinion because for some shots, Android was better and for some IOS was better, but you gave it to IPhone instead of making it a tie.  For Eco Consciousness you just completely ignored that you can use something like LineageOS and get a modern Android on phones as old as 2014 instead of just throwing the phone away once the manufacturer drops support.  For Software Features you utterly ignored that IOS literally only lets you use things Apple approves. Apple is being sued over this right now. There are no limits on Android here. Alternative app stores, apps Google would never approve off, even Android versions that cut out Google or sandbox the Google services are in the cards. I can't think of any features IOS has that you can't get on Android. I can think of quite a few you just can't get on IOS. If you want to give IOS points for broader  Why did you even talk about widgets when you were talking about assistants? You literally just said that Google Assistant is superior and then proceeded in not giving a point for it and made it a tie because the IPhone had prettier widgets (with fewer options, which should make the "widgets" part a tie as well).
got money=iphone no money=android simple
I think this is quite biased Mkbhd is not defending
This quest by all these channels to find out which is best is the ultimate exercise in stupidity. Neither is best, neither is worst. It comes down to user experience. Of course the legions of fanboys on both sides doesn’t help.
Arun is a fanboy of the other dude...and The other dude is an Apple fanboy...wasted 20mins of my life smh.
13:01 There is like a feature in android like air drop on android I wonder if people realized
Should have included SECURITY in this comparison between iPhone and Android
When it comes down to it, the iPhone tends to be overpriced than the value it delivers.
Blindfolded android is wayyy better
So we dont mention anything about always on display?
So interesting that despite MKB scoring iPhone much higher, his daily driver was the Samsung S21. Correct me if I'm wrong but both gents use Android phobes. It really comes down to personal use cases, what's available and affordable and fun. It's great to have good choices
You're giving the award for updates to a company that uses them to DECREASE THE SPEED OF YOUR PHONE? THEY LOCK YOUR BATTERY, THEY MAKE YOUR PHONE SLOWER, THEY FORCE YOU TO BUY A NEW ONE.  And you're giving the updates award to that company? Are you serious?
I actually use and like split screen and some other stuff so i would give Android that point.  Also i would give a point to Android for options for its open source and free for all instead of apple market dominance leading to monopolistic policies especially like right to repair related issue.   I don't think i would ever buy an Apple product coz it just feels too shady to me.
I’m getting a MotorolaG Stylus 5G soon. Switching back to android from IPhone. I’m an audiophile and I just can’t get used to not having a headphone Jack. And I’m not paying $200 for AirPods that I can’t use an equalizer with.
Thank you for an objective conversation! So tired of fanboy talks.
I love how everyone jizzes at the thought of an iPhone when I in fact still prefer using my oneplus 7 McLaren over the 14 pro max. Pop up camera still works like new, it’s comfortable for one hand use (that’s what she said), it’s fast, charges in a few minutes and lasts pretty much all day. The app drawer is light years better than the iPhone version and since I’m not a professional photographer, the photos are usable and pretty much the same on both.
iOS is better
I have a Samsung Galaxy 10+, and I have dropped it on it's side a few times and cracked the screen. I have had a Apple ph before the Samsung and dropped on it side many times to, never broke the screen. The Apple takes faster pictures, the Samsung has a lag, but I love the styles, its like a remote control. Don't know why Apple dosen't do that.
Iphone going back
Carplay is horrible
Bluetooth is horrible on iphone.
Typing on iphone is horrible. Keyboard is useless.
I just made the switch from Samsung to iPhone and it’s the worst decision ever. Everything on the iPhone is so inconsistent and lacks it personalization
Everything that android got was from drafts lol
Samsung s22 ulrta camera is alot better than the iPhone one:)
Great vid, but I think the iphone 'wiping the floor' with Android shows weakness in the scoring method more than anything. Also to anyone reading this don't sleep on wireless Dex, it is the ultimate multitasking app.
That's not a question....Its clearly android...More capabe in every aspect...
Android is waaaaay waaaaay better its no secret and very obvious.
bias sht
Comparison is the thief of joy - happiness
Subjectively neither is better but each is uniquely different
Two iphone fans.
if you were living outside of usa iphone would be the big loser so this conclusion is not true at all
Android better in every thing  But iphone good just in photo
I do not agree with you on the battery my  friend with a phone 13 had he's phone at 20% and in 20 minutes it was dead he was not using it
20:05 They got a connection first try
@MKBHD is such a big dribbling liar... Saying ios has a couple features with more importance that matter to more people than andriod.... sad watching him make such travesty.   Andriod is the world's leading mobile operating system with features that make for a wider variety and favors larger groups of people and easily connects to different platforms including PC cos of the low restrictions compared to ios.  America is not the only market for christ sake.   Android allows more customisation, and is  different on devices from different manufacturers, which allows users to model their phone into whatever image they so desire. We might both own an s22 but mine could be totally different from yours superficially speaking.  This entire comparison here seems all too contrived.
Not enough "if" in this video. I get there's no way to be completely objective, but since that's the case, a single score doesn't account for the immense variety in needs different people have. If you do something like this again, I think each category should have a rating based on preferences. Like the battery section. If a person prioritizes charge speed over battery efficiency, that might change the rating. And having a separate rating for each category would allow the view to add up the scores based on their need, giving it more meaning and increasing its reliability for guiding a purchasing decision.
I’m on iPhone 7 and iOS 15.7.3
Paid video by apple 😂
APPLE $1,890 5 FEATURES.. ANDROID 1,368 223 FEATURES.. NO NOTCH.. LOL
U have so many subscribers, so much views,     But shame on you for putting so much ads in your video.   I mean how greedy can you be....       Shame
The Sony android beats iphone 24/7  wtf is this video
sponsored by iphone
I love how long is this video is 20:22 LOL
IPhone is a rubbish phone and there are not many useful features in iPhone
Na android is better for me. Meanwhile me using a iphone 7 rn. Lol
I’m so trapped in the Apple ecosystem it’s hard to switch to Samsung 😢
I have the xs iOS 16.3 and does well to
Just subscribe to your channel man, and i can tell you that all your Questions and pros & cons are very analytic before buying a S22 Ultra or 14 pro.  Appreciate man, keep doing. Peace
Andriod  galaxy in specific is better then the clone phone 14, copy righted a Galaxy s8 and called it there own. If it wasnt for samsung apple wouldnt have anything, we make youre boreds, youre displays and practically everything
I resent the notion that Apple leads the market with innovations and trends when they are taking away standard features and properties from their products. On top of that, upon purchasing an iphone, it is practically necessary to dive into the greater Apple ecosystem otherwise you will not get the full experience. That means iPhone, MacBook, AirPods, Apple Watch. It's almost an entire lifestyle shift. I'm not a fan
Y'all using these "portable phones" I'm still using the house phone to play snake, the first one.
I totally disagree with that
Android till the day I die. Lol I just love being able to do what I want, when I want with the device I paid for. Some brands are actually moving in Apple's direction.. (cough Samsung) and hey that's cool.. I just won't buy your phone. I'm paying for it, it needs to do what I want. I'm willing to deal with a random bug once in a great while now, rather than wait 6 years for Apple to make it perfect. Which by then.. they fixed the bug 5 years ago.. usually.
This is the most baised video I have ever seen...
i set the  entire 11th episode Season 2 of Demon Slayer, the entire battle in 1440p 60fps as live wallpaper in loop (22 minutes) in my android phone and its been smooth-sailing ... i cant do that with an iphone. Not been able to customize my phone however I want with such freedom is a dealbrear for me.
That was fun to watch.  Thanks.
Biased androids are way better
I believe this is Marcus' choice, because to me, the result is opposite.
remember when samsung phones used real multitasking with just holding the recent Button. Why does noone mention it before they announce the new s23? Also, where is the great IR blaster that we used to have? And finally, we want microSD card back.And no stupid storage restrictions inside android folders (new feature for android 12-13)People, you  are influencers. So influence, fast! Tell them they sell the same thing for years and removing all the good things that got android and Samsung famous. Hit them with comments on Unpacked event, tell them the truth, make them feel ashamed. After all, we are here for innovation and we are paying them do please us
Hilarious, thanks guys. Android is always the better value especially if you are a power user, or looking for value. USB OTG IS GOD! Dex is finding its way finally in the Samsung camp, the Note series alone is greatness. The iphone doing things better on paper is irrelevant to everyday use. Fuck benchmarks and your personal preference. Software differences are pointless because I can get apps that do the things that are "missing" from android... "Killers"? This should have been about value...period. Better camera, battery, etc... on a phone vs great camera, battery, etc on a phone... with way more options features...🤔
"It's whatever you like MARQUEZ 😂" My sister said in her Eartha Kits voice and nasty she continue to sleep well beautiful lady.
I've touched an iPhone before so the point goes to apple.
My s22 ultra has a 5500 MA battery that charges completely in 50 minutes and you gave the points to the iphonebthat has a  4000 MA battery and takes 2 hours to charge. How is this not set up in iPhones favor.   Also. I shoot videos on iphone all the time so point goes to iPhone. No comparison you just throwing points to iPhone because "wElL I uSe iT". A loss is a loss but Samsung didn't lose this because you made reasons why Samsung won the category then still give it to iPhone or you don't say anything and just give it to iPhone for no reason. Also ignoring galaxy has 8k video.   And for that the point goes to iPhone
So, not even going to consider security, freedom, digital privacy, third party apps, accessories, or corporate social values?????
Siri is stupid, and there is no reason for that.
Please add ease of repair as a category ...even in sustainability if needed.
Android. Sure apple makes more powerful phones but android has huge customization possibility, any price range from 20 to over 1000 dollar phones, and they are usually the first to get new features.
This feels like the most polite android vs IOS fight I have ever seen
Is his guest paid by Apple?
I just find that iphones last much longer than android phones my dad has a iphone 4s and it still works
I refuse to buy iPhone until I don't have to spend thousands for a phone that is barely better
Upgrade cycles are getting shorter I think, so android being budget friendly matters more in the long run I think
Android is heavier than iphone, that's the only thing, but I can live with it
Who cares?
They are being biased for iPhone every YouTube content person does this. When they know Samsung defeats iPhone in certain areas Samsung has a way better battery life. I stop watching people's content when they become to biased. Samsung has it's cons but come on now it's very obvious here.
iPhone 14 Pro max owner, and apple SUCKS.  Everything about it is more painful to operate and manage but at least its slower.
I'm getting an IPhone 13 at the end of this month or the next month
apple sponsored video
I really like the AI integration on my pixel 6a from recents app in the app drawer to the Google assistant voice typing. That's another point for Android it is getting really smart. AI is pretty balls on my iPad.
I just bought my first Iphone after owning samsung's for the past 25 years.  Been less than 4 days and I can't wait to go back to the store and return the Iphone for a samsung.  I can't begin to describe how much I HATE!!!!  my new Iphone.
Android wins for one reason, third party .APKs
Snapdrop faster than Airdrop
This video definitely favors the iphone come on now.
I have S22 ultra and video quality on low light is very bad , Iphone has way better camera ,screen and the IOS sistem has that nice fluidity to it ,I like iphone more .
this is favoritism
So glad i had this on in the background or I would have wasted 20 mins of my life. MKB hits the nail on the head at 19:48 though and you should basically just skip to what he says there and not watch the rest of the video. Android is better in some ways and iOS is better in some ways but it all comes down to what matters most to the individual.  Personally for me I chose to get the best of all worlds as I have an Android-based phone, an Apple-based tablet & a Windows-based laptop.
what the fuck is going on with yo left calf bruh that shit massive
one thing they did not talk about is your have to buy everything from apple  and there is sooo much more free stuff with an android phone ,apple OWNES you , Android is FREEDOM
The most biased comparison I have ever seen 😂😂😂
I think Samsung Dex is so amazing, and so useful for all kinds of things, from doing work to entertaining and gaming, I just love it
Everyone iphone everyone Samsung  Me who wants to browse on YouTube all day:🤷
Where is the note series, Samsung note is thee best/huawei/sony
Seriously considering widgets a tie?? That's ridiculous.
Super bias. Samsung way better than iPhone in all aspects
What a biased video. Someone who knows tech should make reviews not some random youtuber who doesn't know anything about tech.
The only category that went to Android was value / price and even then Mrwhosetheboss almost called it a draw. And MKBHD specifically said that fast charging was more important to him than battery. There are Android phones with 6,000 mah batteries AND have fast charging but the iPhone gets the win in that category? They had to really reach in some places to give the win to the iPhone in some categories. Was there a sponsor for this video? Not saying Apple makes bad products, but like someone else pointed out, not a 7.5 to 2.5 difference. And 2 of Android's points were due to a draw. Only one win?
Android wins
i wouldnt choose between Samsung or Iphone. I  dont like apple for their bad consumer parctices and Samsung is just overpriced trash.
Air drop is compensated by Nearby share and Quick share
I have google meet better than FaceTime
Sponsored by Apple 🍎🍏 of course 😎I would side with iphones for sure them bucks sure can keep pockets warm
It's crazy how every Android phone is competing with one iphone, Truly shows how good apple is
Apple could easily make a few changes and take Android customers
Thats one of the MOST BIASED video I have seen. If u can't afford it then what use it?
How much did apple pay you guys to make this video? It's quite clear that they did, just wondering what the price was.
mentioning the airdrop, and other features that help interact with other devices i think was an invalid argument because the focus was just on the phones, and going past that threshold apple has the edge because they have more synchronicity
Sounds bias to me. 💁‍♂️
He is recommending iphone..but he is using samsung s21 ultra😮
Android users” my what’s app “ iPhone that’s had FaceTime since the iPhone 4
I did not expect it but this is not a good review. When comparing an iPhone and an Android you should at least only compare devices in the same price category. I feel like iPhone can have a better performance with overall less good component because the OS is created specifically for one type of device. With android it's the other way around.  The upside to this disadvantage is that you have more freedom to decide what kind of device you like more. Something that apple decides for you. I feel like this video is made the please the American demographic the watches their videos the most.  I truly respect you guys and hope my opinion does not offend you.
Amazing video
I’ve had iPhone all my life and I now have 12 pro max, however, my boyfriend has android and he keeps telling me to turn to Samsung as “it’s so much better in many ways” but I prefer iPhone layout to Samsung. But I feel Samsung picture quality is better and beautiful. So many pros and cons for me but after this tangent I’m going to try switch to Samsung to try it for myself as I really like the look of the Samsung s22 ultra.  I might even stick to it. Who knows.
I like trying different phones.. Went from Nokia, Samsung, Xiaomi, Sony XA2 Ultra was good to me for 5 years and now I decided to try the iPhone 14 plus
I’m sorry the takes in this video were  so unfair to Android honesty pure bias in my opinion
Cannot believe battery goes to iPhone, D
My opinion on this is I just use either phone, I interchange phones at times, going from Samsung to iPhone every 2 years or so, and I will say both are the top players in their own game, iphone because iphone lol, and samsung in the android market.
What about UI navigation? Also, "No phone is perfect." The one statement in the entire video that can not be argued.
This was so biased. XD
After having to use both Samsung and iPhone,  I'll stick with Samsung any day.
Now a day both are good just pic the one that you are used to or for the design otherwise the winner points are so useless and almost draw all the time that its pointless to say one is better than the other, just say im an apple user or samsung user, you are just used to the device menu and stuff
I love android because I changed phone frequently and android has better options than just changed the numbers every year like iphone, my next choice is either s22 or zenfone 9 😋
Android forever
After watching this feels like android is useless but be very true I love my s8 way back 2018 than my iPhone rt now
A few people comment about USB c being a game changer and all for android based phones. But people need to be mindful that sometimes the cable wont charge all devices. Kinda annoying but still a win to android.
What about continuous video shoot after hitting a pause and resuming in Android? Better Selfie Camera in Android? Punch hole is much better in Android.. USB C is much better in Android than iPhone Data transfer is easier in iPhone both with computer and over Bluetooth So many Apps in Google Playstore than Apple Apple AppStore  Am I missing something? Sorry to say but you need to be unbiased but, to be honest you seem to be partial over iPhones Seems like a paid review to me though 🤔
Just bring IR Blaster back to android, android lovers will never think about iphone again😁
Why can’t i just correct number in the dialer of iphone, i have to erase numbers after that , just to change that one number in the middle So stupid….
Watching from my 13 pro max while holding my new 14 pro I got for $350
I am watching this video on a Samsung galaxy phone. 😊
For me buying both Samsung s22ultra and iPhone 14pro max won't be that of a bad idea, iOS and android, God willing
If apple switch the charging ports to the android one it will be a game changer. The problem is greed, iPhone sees it as free money.
As someone that just recently converted to iPhoneism less then a year ago, i have to say it is much better for my needs. 10 years of samsung use I always hated iPhones. The simplicity and having all my information integrated etc make life 10x easier. Also iPhone seems way cleaner and much more organized
iphones better
How can you actually say that android features and ios features are kinda on the same level without sounding like a 🤡
Nokia, Huawei and Windows Phone: Am I joke to you?
IPhone sucks
It’s not looking good cause y’all kissing IPhone Ass Samsung is better IPhone wanna charge for everything Samsung give you Freedom
Seeing two of the best reviewers talking is awesome
Android has a phone for literally any person on the planet, but if you want that type of phone but as an iPhone, then you have no other choice than th SE.
it sounds like mkbhd is a Iphone fan boy
Iphone charging close to 2k$ but doesn't allow features like splitscreen is a huge deal breaker not to mention the lack of usb-c.
Samsung is better
Android is the best
Marques, did you know theres a buzzing sound that can be toggled on when your s22 ultra is set to vibrate only so you "hear" the vibration?
Biased
Apple has the software optimization to make slow hardware fast.

Space Zoom. Stylis Pen. Customization. Ringtones. Curved display. Fingerprint Sensor. Pricing. Options. More apps. USB-C. I don't care about phone wars but this seemed kinda weird where we just listed more things that iphone was better at. I don't like Android because of the messaging system. I don't like iPhone because all the phones look exactly the same and everyone gets the new phone every single year
Help me out here. Is there a game that you can get on apple that you can't on Android? Cause I even play play station games on my android
you guys need more collab!
Love that you featured Ted Lasso in your video. Great TV show. Go Phoebe!
Tesla pi Phone No.1💪💪💪💪💪
Lost all credibility at features. Giving iphone the category where android is miles ahead
I have a new iPad Pro (& have owned iPhones) & I can confidently say that Galaxy FE editions are the best. Battery is the only problem.
Really 7.5 for iphone and 2.5 for Android. From my perspective i don't think so . I have used both, for my buisness purposes i use iphone and for my personal use i always use Android......🙂
I have both an iPhone 13 pro and an Android phone namely Motorola G31.  I loved my iPhone for the first several months but I missed Android and went back and haven't looked back.  I personally prefer my Motorola phone because for a budget phone it has an amoled display like Samsung and my personal favourite the headphone jack.  What I loved about my iPhone was the telephoto camera and software updates and how compact it was with a 6.1 inch screen.  But while Android may be poor at software updates except Pixel and to an extent Samsung, Android is far better when it comes to customisation, supporting things like headphone jacks and SD cards and there being a phone for everyone compared to iPhone where you simply pick up a model that does the same stuff as other iPhones.  However I wouldn't go back to Samsung.   Samsung is popular but one thing I don't like is the bloatware installed and in my opinion Samsung is a huge mess with it's os.  I love Motorola because it has a clean Android software similar to Pixel and their os is almost very like Stock Android.     The only con is the emojis which look cartoonish or kiddish but you can't have everything.
i think dslr is best
I have an iPhone 10 max pro -just a ridiculous name- and I find that I tend to favor this phone over the galaxy note 20 ultra which was an old phone to my mom and she gave it to me for Christmas. But I kinda like the U.I on Samsung a little bit more because it’s more in depth, but that’s also why I like the iPhone and prefer it, for its simplicity. Both are great brands and phones.
Yeah I’m still using iPhone
only in america, airdrop is like never used here, like why lol
That felt very biased in some places. Software Features for example, apple has provided features that are provided by android phones, but made them Apple exclusive so they become important to apple users, so you gave iPhone the benefit of the doubt over android which has the same features but in a universal fashion... What??
Android is way better than Apple Phones....Android fans are use to so many things we been getting for years are no longer a big deal anymore...But Apple fans love the things that Android been having for years so when Apple get something from Android it's a new car to them they might think it's better no it's just new to them Laughable....Look at always on display is trash kills the battery and never go off it's a night light for house hope you sleep with a light on Laughable....Wt about the 120 hz to speed up and smooth out the phone to keep up with the time Stop.... Take Android screen and widgets away and you got nothing like John Deere just a name a US thing but not the best....Two Apple Fan Boys that sound very dumb wt they saying a out the companies
Is he gay
I'll never use iPhone. It doesn't have the freedom and flexibility Android has. From there you also have the ability to select different brands with custom UI skinned on top of Android making the experience different each occasion depending on the brand the person selects.  Especially the gamer phones. They have the most unique, flashy and in your face custom  geared Android UI.
MKBHD is so biased and I hate it so much 🤦🏻‍♂️
iPhone is best bc my bias became one🤭😻😋🥰🤙
I wish i was in a position to be able to spend $1000 every year to get the latest phone lol mr was flabbergasted that he used "last years phone". ill shut up and go to my iphone 7 lol
After a year or so i would like this android vs Apple rematch 👌
I like to use my android for playing around and having a little fun. For business and music it’s always going to be iOS. It is what it is, buy both.
This video should be a kind of joke. I have just bought 14 pro and previously used Ultra S21 and it hasnt been a good experience since now with my 14pro. The ONLY thing that i have liked so far in IOS is the App Store, the optimization of the apps and the display. NOTHING ELSE. Seems that Apple users are very close minded and EXTREMELY conformist people. This is why Apple is very slow to improve their software to satisfy their costumers. Very simple features are just coming to IOS such as widgets. And some other things that shocked me is (may sound  irrelevant) turning off the device. Still using side buttons to turn it off??????????? (cant restart by the way) Come on!! Those buttons existed in 70s Star Trek series. We are in 21th Century!   To create a ver simple photo collage you have to download an app?!!! Or to cut a photo  or a screen shot in random shapes as well????!!! Or to take a screen shot with buttons still? (Double or triple fingerin on the back of the phone doesnt work well when you use a phone case!!)   By the way the 14 pro camera is ok but somehow (very poor digital zoom) there are lots of photo qualities that i took with my Ultra S21 but with my 14 pro i cant catch those ones. And portrait mode of 14 pro sucks. I liked a lot the portrait mode of my S21 Ultra and the portrait mode tools of it. I dont even compare with S22 Ultra!!!   You are all really preppie guys to show off in your youtube or  whatelse social media channels to show off with your slightly better taken photos or videos by Iphone.   Samsung has all the right to make fun of Apple. Still 60 hz in their basic and plus models and with older chipset!!!!! And 48 MP camera! WOW! This company is really making fun of their loyal customer sinde years and the customers are still happy!!!? WTF!
When the battery round goes to the iPhone I know this is not legit. IPhone is infamous for the crap battery, that dies in 4hrs
feels like IMRAN KHAN vs PDM. you know who is iphone and who is PDM. twimc
Cool collab. Mewhosetheboss talkong with tim cook
Hey commenters. Id love to know about the audio tho. Like for an audiophile, which sounds more crisp, detailed, more defined bass when it comes to bluetooth and wired? I know android is capable of aptx and ldac but lets set that aside and just let me know which actually sounds better
Since XR apple messed up sg with the camera / software. Android does WAY better pictures in low /ambient light and my new iPhone is completely useless during-after  sundown vs my friends new Android which is not even a Samsung. I am so pissed!
I disagree on the phone display. Although I prefer a flat screen to a curved screen, the Samsung s20, s21, and s22 Ultra blow any iPhone screens away!
It's funny Marques has the iPhone winning in so many categories, but when it comes down to it, he uses a Samsung phone!
Jokes as always
hats off to mrwhosetheboss who chooses samsung for photography, a real legend with high knowledge
Marques is so biased
This definitely looks like Apple paid buttloads of money to these 2 guys to just talk trash about Android 🤣 Score: 2.5 vs 7.5 ?? I mean, c'mon, even when you try to rig it, atleast be subtle about it 😂
Here I am playing on my phone with 16gb of ram, 120hz refresh, USB-C, playing Emulated games from every console in history, 100X space zoom and finding out a chonk of a phone with a giant notch, proprietary cable and locked down experience is better... Weird.
they have facetime on amsung
these opinions are weird
i dont trust this person
iphone cameras works better with 3rd party apps no way do u remember the shakycamera on 3rcd parts
If Apple finds a better Solution for the Huge notch and do switch to usb - c  with the iPhone 15 next year that would be a Game changer
It’s quite a tough choice, because the ram, and with budget users, Cameras are great in android, but performance and things are great on iPhones. Apple and android are practically tied on things. The 2018 android I had took stunning photos, but the 2021 iPhone is good, but not the best in my opinion.
I switched from a 2018 flagship android to a 2021 apple flagship
Basically, theres Iphone and samsung battling it out  Then theres everyone else
One of the worst biased videos I've ever seen
Everything you mentioned about the displays on the Samsung was better. How can you say it's a draw? Biased from the go
4:30 i am an owner of mi 12 pro that comes with 120 w charging brick and top the phone to 100 from 20 25 Percent in just 25 30 minutes in real conditions... I've never had any doubts on my phones battery life coz of it when i know it can be 100 percent in just that less amount of time
The issue I've always had with android vs apple is you can't compare them. One is a single phone, another is a wide selection of phones. Apple has a new phone released every year, and that's the one people talk about. Android has so many creators, let alone phone models released, it just isn't fair to either side. Comparing companies to Apple, though, that's way more fair.
No mention of the OnePlus at all? The 10T uses Android, has one of fastest chargers Ive ever experienced (15%-70% in less than 15 mins. Full charge in ~20 mins)
Android is too fragmented—so the quality suffers. There’s no universal standard.
Nicely done, freewheeling thought processing with an excellent end result. Thanks to you both and a very happy & healthy new year!
Love when you guys collaborate
I was expecting much better review but I have to say this is pretty biased 😂
Samsung is running circles around iphone in almost any category. Yes the iphones camera is better ingergrated in apps. But who uses the camera on the phone for anything other the selfies?  Its so trash in almost any situation. If you wanna take pictures. Get a dslr.  Samsung ui is a million times better then ios.  Imessage sucks dick compared to sms. And if you wanna see the personnyour talking to just use discord or fb messenger. Customization on iphone is non existant compared to Samsung.  Im saying Samsung because i think stock android is pretty ugly
To each his own...feel like this review is skewed here.   I currently have an iphone x running IOS 16, Samsung s9 plus (that I gifted to a family member recently), and oneplus 9 pro as my daily phone.  Last year the oneplus replaced a Google Pixel 6 that I broke.  I like both platforms and think each has it's plus's and negatives.  iPhone doesn't truly shine unless you are in the ecosystem.  Apple used to be incredibly restrictive with the phone and app store.  I guess due to complaints Apple has eased up on certain things to a small extent.  They still want total control, but example  you can download apps like Amazon Music that years ago would be a hard NO.  I think iphone shines in some small way because from the ground up they build the hardware, software, and apps are written for that platform with to some degree oversight from Apple keeping things close.  On Android hardware is phone specific, with each manufacturer adding their own software spin to the OS which could be great or not so great.
Very biased 🤷‍♂
I don’t agree with the iPhone for Photos… bc there’s the Google pixel that’s best in photos…
I personally will always support company's that DON'T self-sabotage their own product just to fix the product 6 models later in a very wierd way that is only slightly better than the original. Apple has that reliability, but Samsung and the such try to go for better products, not ones that are holding back. I understand that it's a long term strategy, but they should at least not pretend that they are on the "creative side" like they did when the E.U. forced them to use USB C. You are not creative when you make your product worse. Other than that, I like Apple, like how they only release something when they've mastered it.
Unfortunately Siri never works. I hope they will make it intelligent bc Alexa helps a lot
You guys are biased...lol
Ive used both OS’s interchangeably throughout my life. First phone was iphone 4. In my experience, the lack of software support and lack of security is what killed android for me. At the end of the day google is an add company and they will collect as much data on you as they possibly can. Apple, while still collecting data, is much more secure and easily allows me to decide which data I send to apple.  I may sound paranoid but in a world where hackers and scammers are becoming increasingly clever with their methods, apple offers the easiest all in one package to keep me secure. The integration of software and hardware allow apple to use much smaller batteries, decreasing waste in the long term. Just because the samsung has more Mah doesn’t mean its simply a better battery, its bigger, contains more chemicals and is simply more to dispose of. Android feels like and acts like a toy where iOS feels like a tool.
Agree to disagree 'Always Android, all the time...'
Your video editing skill is simply Amazing.. love it.
Ok a few months ago my old Iphone SE 1st gen. just died. It has been updated all these years. When it happened, I didn't have money for a new iPhone, so I was forced to use only an Android phone (xiaomi) And the worst thing for me is the screen size of 6.5 inches. Another keyboard ... TRAGEDY ... even after installing some other recommended swift etc. none even come close to that of the iPhone. The environmentally friendly phone is the iPhone because I had the same phone for 4 years because it was updated. I only have this Xiaomi for a few months and I wouldn't be able to stand it for the next few. I'm buying an iPhone 13 mini in February.
Samsung share...is a cross platform version of air drop.....and apple users can FaceTime with android users.....so those things are no longer a factor.
Great review but it bias
tbh samsung battery better a samsung a31 has better battery than most apples
You guys should do more videos together. Please?
Lol who cares if those 10 ios features are used by many and million android features are used by 10. Its all about choices. Android users have freedom. People buy android phones for their use. Whereas Apple buys people for their business.
I think it shows that both are great options when yall both use samsung phones when you ranked iPhone better here. I love my Samsung s22 way more than any iPhone but I just prefer it after using adroid for so long. Not to mention the zoom is so good that I can take clear photos of the moon eith my PHONE!!! How many people can go x30 for a moon photo? Samsung and iPhone are just two very simular devices up to the person buying to decide!
More like Android vs iPhone fanboy
Weird how people cant see he's capping real hard he is sponsored by Apple u can see it from a mile away he doesnt even have a iphone for his personal phone lol people dont understand how this works
they both use an iphone so its not a fair result
Heh I use the ice cream machine at McDonalds as a device instead. Ever wondered how it’s always broken? 😈
This opinion and interview are Bullshit. Lol. His background alone knows who gonna win.
Well that felt like a payed ad
So to get all the features the android fans talk of I need to buy several phones? I think I’ll stick to iPhone
It depends what stuff you do. For example im a musician and use iOS apps to create music there's so much more stuff on the iOS platform a massive amount. This is the main reason I have iOS stuff. I have a draw full of of Android phones that mostly where great apart from this 1thing.
Come on fed up of these Android vs iPhone  shit . Find a phone and just enjoy it  this type of thing gets boring find something else to talk about that matters
I would actually want an android but my whole family has iPhone and it is useful if we can share like iCloud and other things
I didn't know Marques  like Android over Cupertino super nerd tim 🍎📱.  I hope Androids will demolish 🍎 gay  tim 👨‍🍳. I got my S22+  deuce are wild Samsung Blue for $259 no trade in or new phone number. Can Cupertino 🍎📱 can do that?  Like Blackpink said  🎵 How Do You Like That? 🎵 Ì hope some Android company beats gay lord 🍎 ceo tim 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Shutter lag exists on my phone because it can capture 108mp in 16 bit, while iPhone can capture in 48mp in 12 bit. Raw is more effective and can do more on Samsung than Apples Pro Raw. This doesn't change the fact that iPhone have much better shutter speed, but can be one reason why the S22 takes longer to capture. I'll be honest. I think that the 14 Pro Max beats the S22 Ultra in camera, except for zoom, 108mp, and raw. It also beats my phone in battery. iOS is a more user-friendly, optimized, smoother, ui, and software, while Android is harder to maintain but offers way more features and is much more open. "iPhone 6GB RAM is like 12GB on Samsung," I somewhat agree with this, but I think that this is because iOS doesn't have much to worry about in terms of software, unlike Android. Apple is awesome with their accessories and "connectivity" within them, for example, you can "continue" on your airpods, Mac, or iPad. Samsung also has accessories and "connectivity," too, but not as good as Apple. iOS customization is not much and harder to do, but it did get better. AOD, which I think is too bright, customizable lock screen, and widgets. I know that you can do more like change icons and stuff, especially settings with jailbreak, but it's just easier to customize on Android. Android, has a better, darker AOD, had widgets for a while already, and I can't even say everything, but Android customization is amazing.   I'm not a fan boy of either Samsung, Android, Apple, or iOS but I am a Samsung and Android person. I've used iPhone for almost my whole life. I've had the 5+, 6+, X, but then I switched to a S9+, then the iPhone 12 in 2020. I loved the iPhone 12. It was awesome and a great phone, but as of right now, I'm back with Samsung on the S22 Ultra. Boy, I miss Android and it's customization, although I do miss some features like my iOS group chats, and Facetime. Although you can Apple facetime on Android too, it's not as great as facetime on an apple device. I think that's all for now and thanks for reading. Please reply with your opinion, story, or experience and I will surely read it.
I don't like this lol
Well if you game “z” Is the best phone. But the iphone is really good.   Well if you need the best batter and charging “y” is better. But the iphone is really good.   Well if you want to zoom in on bird in a national park, G is way better. But the iphone is really good.   Well how sustainable is this, Iphone is the best.   Point is there are specialized phones. Then there is the one built for most people thats really good. They arent comparable because they arent competing.
it will be a pleasure for me to donate me with an iphone 14 Promax for free @Mrwhosetheboss
Am I the only one that knows Android has their own version of airdrop?
You guys are definitely not giving android enough shine. Especially in the battery department. I have the s22 ultra my battery last all day when it finally does get low. My charger will have it at 100 in like 15 min, which is incredible
I feel like you can't use this video, because it's just based on his personal preferences, while i think it should be statistics that are being argued.
So this guy is just a Apple guy he don’t care that android takes better picture but the simplicity of iPhone he rather use it. We wasn’t doing a witch phone is easier to use
watching this vid cuz my brother doesn't want his new iphone for his old android and im thinking of giving my new android for his iphone
I really like and watch both of you guys but this video was one sided.
This review paid for by apple.
You should do a comparison with the iPhone 14 pro max they fixed the notch on that one
i OS IS BIG ,BETTER, COOL AND ANDROID SMALL,CHEAP, SLOW .
I REALLY NEEDED THIS VIDEO !!!!! , Been an android user for close to 10 years but comtemplating switching due to the better compatability with instagram (where I post most of my videos)   I'm going to miss my android but thank you for making this decision more informed.
iphones are a scam they lag so much after some years/when you are on a full storage while for samsung, even if you are on full storage they don’t lag so much unlike iphones samsung just complains about you gallery
3:00 I'm on android rn and it has 32GB ngl
Bringing MKBHD to compare android and iPhone is an unfair one. The man is an iOs guy and desperately biased to that. My honest observation because i foĺlow most of his android vs iPhone reviews. The man clearly down plays even the perfect goods about S22 ultra.
i hate apple and my iphone
this was really unfair to the android, part of the point of android is that there are so Manny platforms to chose from, so comparing mostly the s22 and iPhone 14 pro max is unfair to android
That guy on the left is a joke lmao
These two gentelmens are clearly working for US (goverment?)... In very many ways bias, what can say.. Many people do not realize the technological war between U.S. and China already is going on, and this is where those 2 individuals are standing.... promoting simply Apple products.. To give you a 'taste' of their biased views: they say: "do you care about Dex??" - quickly responding :"no" (...lol! they don't even dare even to say: "do you care about Samsung's ability to  work with stylus, using for taking notes, share things? - clear another example how biased they get :(".. So let me elaborate a little bit for those people from Apples' world who has no idea what is  Dex OS... ... Right now, I'm using DEX on my S22U...  this 'commentary' I'm writing on bluetooth keyboard that is connected (wirelesly) between my S22U, and Samsung 75" QLED (!!) so literally I'm using my S22U, and my TV set with keyboard as a (PC) computer  thanks to Dex!! - can Iphone do that?? And if on the road, using my S22U with unlimited internet with DEX laptop - again to experience REGULAR PC with having on the 'go, on the road' with Internet rather than buying special 'program/hub'... Can Iphone do that???...  I'm free not to use Youtube with millions of commercials braking in, list goes on and on... , I'm free to use my phone via TV Big screen  - and having my 'pocket' PC wherever  I go (true, I have to have smart TV).. What about taking gazillions notes at my work and outside via stylus that is just at my belt, and can Iphone do that??? Now (lol) their "scientific discusson" about photography...  Is really Iphone that much better this category ?? Photo to photo is not even equal on the same phone (many comes different from the same device - that's why true photographers take many of photos selecting later the best - long story short: it depends how you keep your phone when taking photo - it's enough a bit changing angle so photo from same device results in different 'outcome'... ) Iphone for instance on top of it takes every photo with it's native green hue - to my eye it is so visible, and bad effect...  Of couse, Samsung is not China's product, but definitely China is more into Androids than IOS world... and yet.. Please do understand, I'm not Chinese 'patriot' either.. Leaving in US, and seeing Ukrainian war.. By all means I'm symphathizing with Western world.. but when gets to technology, at least if we try to be objective we first need to sort out certain thing and understanding why many 'on intenet ''experts''' say what they what they say say and realize their 'objectivity' is often a 'mith'.. Let's not be like stupid ships... I'm sure the same is going on in Russia and in China - people are simply that way - very biased... but I hate when people lie...  reviews like this simply lacks of any objectivity - so sad :(... To me Iphone is great device, with great battery but missing technological aspects of Android.. that's probably why it's loosing ground on market these days, not to say they are not able to compit.. Already we see lowering their price tags on some of their products.. thay's why there are already plans to drop current Iphone line, and to bring something better, way better (*better be) so they can regain!! After all, this is in capitalistic's world markets where we develop due to 'healthy' (*at least used to be that way) competition so new better designed products emerge, and hopefully makes country like US to grow...  and those '2 gurus' don't even mention that.. this is their 'objectivity' .. it's to me like mixing truth with lies.. and for this reasons these "famous boys" no longer trusty to me!I and .. while I hate Google for invading our privacy, why did they not add a point for Android for simply being more capable voice Assistant than Siri??  (their bias is astronomical) . I'm sure they do it for reason, that is what that are beeing paid for, I'm sure.
test
this seems biased
Android
This dude just made up reasons for iOS to be better. Bcuz no, android do not just randomly delete photos like he said. And also why do you compare an expensive apple phone and a not as expensive android. No way that's fair.
How are you going to say, I almost never use Siri and open it accidentally more often than I mean to and then still call it a draw for that category. This shit biased af haha. How much did Apple pay for this video?
How can you say such nonsense that an iPhone camera is better cmon  in android exist 200 pm camera  hei do you even listen  does locscren widgets ah on iPhone they run in html  (in a browser)  you can even chose between the providers,  does an iPhone have 2 graphics cards ? And not just any an rdna 2  radeon 660M  ah no ,  how much of the SoC is actually used in iPhone  3/4 maybe  can it run linux in a non vm environment without jailbreak?  Does it support 120 watt change!  All the features in ios 16 got copy from jailbreak community,  so  and design is like from the 60 ages  bulky does ios supports changing resolutions,  does ios support changing the amount of zram or pagefile support ,  free window support  ios for pc ?
Ah airddrop exists also in android  it is called  nearby share
You people are contradictory   if iPhone parts come from Samsung, which is normally that the comparison is almost the same
Idiot's for gaming u give it for apple and for operating system + multi task +looks+ assistance what the .U made this video with the apple.if i could ban u some how
What about zenfone 9
Red
The fucking Android is, the Apple is for fashion victims.  I blows my mind that there is a meme of androids being bad.
Arun saying he tried to customise his first phone cause it wasn't good enough is literally what I'm doing with mine lol
INCREDIBLY BIASED! this video has no credibility at all, the biased is insanely obvious
All of the "features" that they go over with iPhone, Android has an equivalent of it.
Marques was insanely biased on this video
2-7 💀 iPhone is clear
I have both and I love them both, i use both everyday too😂😂😂
iPhone is best and reliable
Marques is really biased here
Hei Arun. Your red bar down there on the thumbnail pic looks like i have watched it... Because i history section red bar is showing how much you watched it..... Just an observation. Mby change color to not get video missef bc thry think thry already watched it
If iPhone is so good, why use an Android?
Two tech geeks just taking but damn it's is so relaxing my man like whyyy
Andriods better stop the cap right now 🤣🤣🤣
Technically 4gb of ios equal 6gb of ram in android. I love iphone performance and optimization but we can't multitasking on it, that's why i always use samsung
"i hate apple"  - Samsung
I find more people looking to charge an iphone than an andriod. But that just might be because more people have iphones?
almost fist bump at the end 😅
37k dislikes? yall Android peeps are petty lowkey
And yet both their main phones are androids🤣
Feel like it makes sense for iOS to win here because one if the biggest strengths of Android is how many options you have and how unique all of them are, while iPhones more or less all follow the same formula.  But that also means that in such a general comparison, iPhone wins count for all of them while Android wins only apply to some phones
I think there both nice
i had android with 4 gb ram and worked terrible. Now i have an old apple with 2 gb ram and its great xD. For me android is garbage
Most of the Android users value Modded Apps which seems impossible in iPhone. So, F iPhone
Apple gang ❤
Let’s go apple
Apple on top
Is this even a challenge?  Apple takes the easy dub
Obviously Apple is better
Apple is better
They make such a hot couple.
nice iphone advertisement
This video is rigged like the android os is actually better and iphones cost a lot more and with android he ignore a lot of things they are better at do you want that I give you full lists of reasons s22 ultra is better than iphone 14 pro max which im sure that people that use iphones don't even know that the i stands for internet
can we get a price category
If Huawei wasn't banned in the US then Apple would be the 3rd largest phone maker behind two Android phone makers.  So to me Android is the best system.  It took an act of congress to keep Apple at number 2.  Huawei was even going after samsung.
had to watch this with my airpods 👀
I have YouTube and Spotify premium in my android
my 3310 will.beat this 2 phone 😂😂😂😂
When get paid by Apple
iPhone has good battery life... WAIT A MINUTE WHO ARE YOU - To this obsessed iPhone black guy. 🤣🤣🤣
It's so one sided omg, battery is CLEARLY better than iphone, yall are just one siding you guys look like idiots.
The I phone is horrible at zoom photos. The camera is more hype then good. iOS is boring and never changes like the boring I phone design. I have a I phone and it’s stale seeing the same phone year after year with no real fun or cool changes for more money.
My wife and I just switched from the s22 ultra to iPhone 14 pro max. I can say without a doubt. iPhone is smoother and more fluid. I like iPhone way better
Reasons why I have no choice but to use android phones:- Floating window and split screen for multitasking Using modded apps that dont have ads like youtube, etc... Type usb c (no brainer) Modded apps to download movies and music for free... Wud love to buy an iphone but their ios eco system is too closed off for me.. 😑
This is just a biased comparison..
This video feels like it was sponsored by apple.
If you have an iphone i better not see you complain about money. Live within your means people.
Apple stores literally scam people. Construction is crap. Not as much right to repair. Can't do what you want with it as far as customization without the warranty getting voided or them shutting down features remotely.
In my opinion, i think we need to start talking about specific android phones. Android is way too broad. There are android phones that are better than other android phones. Talking about specific android brands are better to compare to iphone.
I own both the Z-fold three, and the iPhone 13 promax. One thing that you all did not mention were android would blow the doors off of iPhone is the fact that android is not locked down and you have more freedom in regards to storing pretty much just anything on the phone without having to go through Apple approval.
Despite all these points....I'm still on team android. I just can't stand how much Apple tries to control what you can do.
You two have ALWAYS been biased against Samsung, basically because its an Android...thats a fact...
Andriod phones are customised to my needs. IOS is more of belonging to an "exclusive club". I care more about functionality than status (which is how IPhone seem to be marketed) so I'll be a Huawei user any day all day!! 😁 I get a long lasting battery, great storage, great camera, overall great functionality and cost effective 🥂
Just the fact that i cant arrange icons on my homescreen in whatever position i want, pisses me off more than anything. Like i just wanna have the top half of my screen empty. But fuck i cant do that
buddy its simple as this: if you understand technology and want to have the deepest control of your phones environment then go android. if you only know how to swipe through tic-tok go waste your money on an iphone so you can brag about it on tic-tok to the other zombies that roast you for not having an iphone in a mirror selfie...
How much apple gave to you 🤣
Bro you guys ended every conversation with android positive but gave point to apple?? Apple most def paid for this 🤣🤣
I still love S9, some old phones are better
That wt happen when you bring two iPhone fan boys together this 😂
Bruh battery 120w with 5k mah bruh
Interesting that the s21 is "very stable", my s9+ has consistently been seriously buggy. I routinely have to force quit YouTube from the settings to stop it chugging for example.
Android is an OS, iPhone is hardware. So the question is irrelevant. Comparing Android to iOS, or comparing a galaxy S22 to an iPhone is more intelligent. That said, nothing will ever beat hardware that uses in-house software that nobody else can stack crap on top of and mess it up. (looking. at you Sammy). Pick what you like and stop listening to influencers. That's the real advice.
My Samsung takes pictures of moon creators mic drop...
This video tells you the different story.  In real life Android is the clear winner because of better charging, bigger battery, better screens with better screen refresh rate, far better customisations. Plus Android's utilities make your daily life easier.  And coming to the major point, price... Android makes possible that everyone can use a smartphone and make thier life simple. Wheather you are a student, professional, housewife or a farmer.  In my opinion, Android is the clear winner. 😎🤘🏼
I'm really not a big fan of Apple. I think they are kind of pretentious and overpriced. That being said, I think the Iphone is just such a good simple phone. I tried to switch to a Oneplus and I had to take it back after a couple days of using it. I like the customization, emulation, and price but a lot of that stuff kinda came with a headache. Maybe its just because I'm used to it after using it for so long but the IOS UI just seems much more user friendly to me. Kinda idiot proof. It also helps that most people I know have an Iphone and everything just works in tandem. I might try the Pixel for a bit but I have a feeling I'm just going to go back to the old reliable Iphone.
Clearly very well biased to support iphone
Pixel wins
I personally didn't like giving the battery point to iPhone
No wonder they’re so expensive
It's unfortunate when Huawei got taken out of the equation at its peak of already overtaking Apple and then Samsung in global categories, the Android community also took a huge hit.  Since then, no Android company filled the shoes in stepping up as a challenge to Apple.  Hmm, guess the US government played its best card.
I switched from sumsang to iphone the experience is bad I can't do alot to things with it it's just a basic phone with a cool design everything feels restricted
Android is better. I know it. You know it. It is known.
I use to alternate between Android and iPhones every few years.  I ended up sticking with iPhone because the os stayed a lot more stable on the earlier models.  Androids os would give me all kinds of performance issues after a few years of use, regardless the model.  Just ran into a big on the iPhones in which the phone was completely dead on the charger the next morning.  After some research this issue pops up a bit with the newer iPhones.  After trying multiple resets it finally came back to life.  I hope they get this fixed.
i use multiscreen all the time
where's the pixels man
This guy at T-mobile told me the Samsung screen is brighter but that he has the phones coming back after two years with screens burning out. He said the screen can not be left in full brightness and last
if they wanted to compare phones do it with the brands and not with the os it shuld been iphonevs samsung or google completly meaning less
Good old Android or Apple nonsense. None of them can replace one another. Have both of them and forget it.
Android is better by far it's more versatile.
... miss my Windows Phone
As a life long Android user I thought Android would be closer to iOS, I'm surprised Android got so annihilated.
Apple sucks i bouth the 12 pro max when it came out and switched back to the note 10 plus
After using Android since my first smartphone, im so glad that i switched to apple. For me the iphone is clearly the winner
Try Nokia x30 camera and compare them to iPhone 14 pro max
Nice video sponsored by apple...
Amazing. I would be embarrassed to take my iphone out in public as it's the most popular and coveted phone among the lower-class, riff-raff, airheads and literally children, more than any other phone.  That is evidence that iphone is no longer a real flagship phone, especially since apple is obviously appealing to the general masses for the most profit by dumbing the phone down and not even with features a real flagship has.  Iphone: A camera and barebones  software with reckless speed. That's it.   Not 'too' refined to turn them off but just enough to get them hooked for showboating.  Now who or what type of people would consider this the 'best' phone out there?   The same type that buy pricey sneakers as the epitome of class and coolness. Gaudy nails, stiletto heals etc. Or just the poor. You never to rarely see these people make any educated choices, just based on advertising, or mainstream popularity.
I really hate these comparisons between Android and iPhone and which one is better.  Go watch TommyNFG's "Iphones vs Androids" video and what are his thoughts on them.
Some of the best insight I have ever gotten. IOS to Android and may go back to Ios. Thanks!
iPhone just does everything better. Apple is the best. No arguments needed. Android fanboys can defend all day day but who actually uses those features they are bragging about. Apple iPhone will always be reliable and resell value never drops compared to android which sucks after just a few months. 😂😂😂
Tha battery thing… just use you iPhone like it only has lets say like 50% battery, coz then it would charge to 50 quicker
This video sponsored by Apple. Thanks for Watching .
And both of them use Android. So f the score!
Thanks for propping up Nova!
The only thing I like about iPhone over Android is Spotlight Search. Much more accurate than Finder
fast charging kills the battery. My mothers 4 year old xr that hasnt been fast charged has the same battery life as my 2 year old 12.
You guys gotta stay together and take over! Ultimate Warrior & Hulk Hogan! (You choose who's who)
I’ve used android my whole life. And I used iPhone 2 years once it was the 11pro and now the 11pro max. I will be switching back to android. The level of customization/personalization is far better on android phones, multitasking is way more efficient on android. It’s nearly non existent on iPhones. And android phones have by far the coolest features to play around with. And from personal experience I think my s21 ultra was a better camera phone compared to my 13pro max that I use now. Also reverse wireless charging is greatly missed … and having to carry around an iPhone cable when I already have everything else in the house using a usb c is annoying
IPhones suck!
In these comments: salty android users
You guys giving unjust points to iphone.... alright, let's start about charging cable cost, charger cost, repair options. Not to even start at privacy, the amount the app store extorts from you 30%!!! from each purchase is just straight up criminal!
I miss LG. They were really cutting edge. First use of multiple cameras, that thing they did with the G8 screen where the glass is the speaker, guest unlock codes etc.
iphone is a fairly good and very stupid friendly device. for android, fairly good? maybe (depends on the manufacturer) stupid friendly? nah~ not that much.
Iphone and apple is best for those who get confused or frazzled by too many choices. That's the only endorsement or credit I can give an iphone or apple.
The title of the video contradicts its content. Which operating system is actually better? Actually - objectively. Objectively, Android is better in all respects, as it has almost unlimited customization of all levels. But in the video, the only thing they talked about was emotional preferences.
I would never use an apple phone because they pay their workers almost nothing at all and treat them like shit, also they charge you like 15x what it cost them to build it then when they come out with the next model, they send out a update to slow your old phone so you buy a new one again, scummy ass company
Yes, the S21 Ultra ROCKS!!!
i used android for 9 years , and I used iPhone for 5 years … I can say android is kinda easier and better in ALMOST everything
😅😅😅😅 only subjective.
I can play GameCube games om android without jailbreakinh my phone..... therefore android is best
I am a fan of samsung. My last phone was samsung s10+ now i got iphone XR. In video they speaking about internet and softwares but they avoided many other huge difrences between those 2. In samsung you can install memory card which give more capacity if you need , iphone can't do that. Samsung don't need be conected with internet to send a message (text). Samsung is mutch easier to operative files in computer after conected with. To send files is enough to drag files from computer to samsung and straight away I can listening mp3's I coppied , in iphone i needed download special program to the computer log on in apple and synchronize with the iphone. It took me long time to reached my goal. For me it's annoying that I need internet to do simple thing's. It's my opinion about iphone and why I prefer samsung.
MK is really a hard-core iphonian😂
I don’t agree with the “locking in” part that people keep saying about apple. If you’re a brand that produces multiple gadgets, products then it makes sense that each product should be able to sync or talk to each other better than with products from other brands.. simply because u have total control of each products production.. your LG tv will sync better with an LG sound bar over other brands.. they are literally made for each other.. does that means they’re trying to lock us in? Definitely not
You can't even Change the Screen or the battery of an iPhone. it is an eco Desaster !!
Is this a baseless comparison. Either make it iOS vs Android, or iPhone vs Pixel (or Samsung)
I feel like Android is Lucky Charms and I-Phone is Corn Flakes. Of course Corn Flakes are healthier, but after 10 years or so you want marshmallows.
You made a video showing the redmi 12 it charges in 9 min and you say that iphone performs better??
If this is a question for you, I am about to destroy this samsung note 20 ultra as soon as I make sure everyone knows that it's forced auto update canceled out my alarms for work.
why can they just compare the best Iphone with the best android phones.
Only ANDROID,  allways better ANDROID👍 iphone is KAKA💩💩💩
This is the worst comparison ever done, these 2 are talking as if they are not TECH's ...... damn i am so disappointed
Honestly, I prefer Android. Much easier to use and waste less time. Can easily synchronise calendar, contacts and photos if phone is lost via Google cloud as I use almost Google apps, on any phone, even on someone else's phone I just need wifi. Google Map, Google Assistant.... Most apps on iphones use Microsoft and you need to but, e.g Microsoft Word, i prefer to use Google docs, it does the same thing and it's free. I am a practical person and hate how Iphone and Microsoft just wants me to buy and buy. I'm not a photographer I just want a decently good photo.
I hear a very strong iPhone bias.
Disgusting bias
The video is just more towards iphone even if android wins in some category you gave it a draw I'd rather have a pretty looking phone with gorgeos display and a peace of mind to install any app I want like apk rather than a big block in my pocket outdated display and do whatever the phone wants me to do. My brother has iphone and I had a samsung and all of my cousins had android phones and we make fun of him. We can watch all the live tv channels like sports and everything on our phones. He could not even install an mt4 or mt5 in his phone which is a platform used for multi trillion dollar business if someone familiar with the financial world if he wants to sell his phone to me I will not pay more than a 50 bucks   it is a joke. ios is for kids who wants to play Pubg
Apple tax and serviceability is the reason why I will never buy an iPhone.
Samsung is og❤️
This is a personal preference thing. Not objective at all.
"less screen curve on the side too" I am fish in not the only person who didn't like curved screens. The only thing it does is make the screen pop out from the phone case and scratch easier and make the edges look funny.
If you want to do more and have more freedom to tinker, Android. If you want to tell people you have an iPhone, apple.
funny thing, they both use android so....
Come on if we are comparing android vs apple you have to compare more than just the android flagships!
How on earth eco conciousness goes to the iphone? With an iphone you need to buy a charger and a case separately, while some android phones include them in the box. Also photos on android are much better when you consider the value of money. Battery combined with charging speed is also better. How about the ridiculous overpricing? Anyone with a functional brain will find a logically priced android phone that covers most of his needs. Iphones are for low confidence narcissists that want to feel a bit better about themselves because they actually have zero self-esteem.
I think it is funny that MKBHD chooses IOS over Android in almost every topic but has a S21 Plus as a personal phone 😂
Every phone you talk about in this video goes against everything you have said about them in review videos.
A really important fact for me (which is rarely mentioned in any video) is, how these phones are doing long term, and Im speaking of years, not just months. If there is such thing that Iphones are longer living than androids or the other way around, or if it completely depends on your luck with every phone. That would be one serious reason to choose one before the other, since I can not afford a high end flagship every 2 years. Has someone experiences?
Andoid all the way
I'm glad you acknowledged that a used phone is the best from an environmental perspective.
Android phones are just like PC's: after a couple years they are junk, but Macs will last a decade.
If Apple is ranked better then why do they both have Android? 🤔
Probably more appropriately named Samsung Galaxy vs Apple iPhone.
After Many Android Years ... Now Am On iOS ... Aah Feels Sooo Good ... 🥳
You 2 are off on a lot. I phone sucks. If you break it you have to take it to them to get it fixed. That's a lose for Apple automatically.  I like Apple phones but will never buy one for that reason. Just like tesla, will never buy a tesla car for that reason.
Been iPhone since the OG in 2007, it’s just reliable and perfect for what I do. I have tried to make the switch but always back to iPhone
looks - iphone actual usage+productivity - android
The fact that yech guys managed to make an unbias comparison into clearly a bias one.....im sick of these apple fanboy reviews🤦
Damn, Marques looked bored af! What happened?
A bit misleading video. Value is the most important aspect of any product and when you compare S22 (600€) vs Iphone 14 (850€) its a clear win for Samsung.
The Experts have spoken
like all these reviews. the best is the one paying the reviewer the most money.
Android is actually better but point for iPhone
Ok, I haven’t watched the video yet…. But I can guess that the conclusion is “it depends on what your needs are, and what’s important to you”
The other guy is just obsessed with I phone
A lot of people would want usb-c to be integrated into an iphone but what you all don’t understand is that apple has been using lighting that it would be an inconvenience for apple users. What are they going to do with a cable that no longer works for their new iphone. Apple has a 20W charger that has their lighting cable but with a usb-c plug in, you can literally use it on a mac or wtv else you use that had a type-c. Its not like apple isn’t using usb-c. They just do it in their own way that is convenient for long term users.
The two top guys in phone reviews talking about the differences was an eye opener.   While I have used both it is great to see their perspective.  They can purchase both and compare honestly.  I'm sure there are some considerations they have to make because of the freebies they get but to hear their honest opinion is eye opening.
The whole topic makes little sense. This is like arguing who has more money. The guy with 57 billion or the guy with 56 billion. Obviously, the guy with 57 billion has more money, but does it really matter and make it "better". No. It makes zero difference in a Real-world scenario.
There is no competition for an iPhone right now. I would like the Tesla take on phones…
I'm an android fan and I agree that iPhone has android parts but still android beats iphone
Try this again, but this time with an android fanboy and not an apple fanboy and lets see the result then.
Even on iPhones which are three years old, the software is so smooth and focused, with no issues of slow down, that the iPhone wins in almost every category. With iOS 16, the customization is on par and more defined, in most cases, for the average phone user. I can pick it an iPhone and I don’t have to worry about “learning” how do use this particular skin of android and it’s nuances with its bloatware. For me, the iPhone wins on consistency and speed of software, even on older models.
Brainwashed dudes convincing themselves that iPhone is better than the other phones..wack
Android can do more but because we don't use those features we will not count it 🤦🤦🤦
Sometimes bro goes. Yeah android have this better but i like iphone so i give a point to iPhone
this video clearly shows you guys like iphone. Andriod has lots of good features and smotheness in it. I think it's not a fair video between iphone and andriod.  Apple introduces notch in iphone14 whereas andriod users already used it 2 years ago.  Andriod has USB type C but iphone doesn't have that. Andriod comes will lot of features in one phone but iphone add a screw in phone say in adveritsement that we added platinum screw in it.  i mean only camera and design of iphone is good but rest of things are not comparable with andriod.
Not even close, Android destroys Apple...And I even prefer fruit to robots!   Breakdown: Camera-Android, Video-Apple, Audio-Android, Widgets-Android, Customisability-Android, Aesthetics-Android, Fluidity-Apple, Simplicity-Apple, Screen-Android (choices), Durability-Android, Options-Android, Apps-Tie (Quality of apps for Apple, open source for Android), Ecosystem-Apple, Versatility -Android, Speed-Apple, Accessories-Tie (Better Apple, More Android), Battery-Android (try a Motorola phone), Charging-Android, Diversity/Plays well with others-Android, Modding -Android, Upgradability-Android, Price-Android, Innovation-Android, etc. Etc. ETC.
How does Apples compliance with Totalitarian China factor into this?
At around 15:15 my Siri randomly said mhm? lol
How can you say that the iphone got the better cpu when in fact several 300$ android phones beat the iphone 13? Anyway, you lost my subscription. I am sorry to say that, but you cannot be a fanoby here, you viewers loose their trust
I like the flat screen also but I use a galaxy fold 4
Except Apple make you use wires and connectors no other device uses. No so eco friendly
IMO I prefer Android.   I had a neighbor who bought a brand new iPhone for $1,000.   About a month later it just bricked.  Took it back to Apple and they told him, buy another one for $1500.        I have had Android phones for years and never had one ever brick on me at all.     So why pay for all the hype?   Just so you can have a picture of a bitten apple on your phone?     If you look very close at the workings of both phones, the hardware is almost the same.   Except for some screws that were just made by Apple to make it hard for a third party to repair their phones.       So I use to repair computers/laptops/tablets and could tell you that when a person stated they had any Apple product,  I had to tell people I/we could not repair those type of computers, due to the restrictions Apple put on us.      Remember that Apple still owns the rights to your phone even if you think you own it outright.  YOU DON'T.    Apple can do anything they want to do with their phone.  You are only renting it in a way.    Does anyone read the Apple TOS stating that tells the people that bought say the IPHONE is not really their IPHONE at all.   Paying thousands of dollars for an IPHONE and then paying for the service to use the phone on top of the price for the phone itself.    So I think I will stick with Android phones and Windows for my Laptop at this time.  (Side note my Windows laptop has top of the line internet security)     "It is sometimes said that Apple products are immune to viruses and malware, but sadly that isn't true. MacBooks, iMacs, and Mac Minis can all be infected by viruses and malware, and hackers can successfully attack them too."     this may also include IPHONES IMO.
Apps in iphone just disappear but in android it gives you options when they crash instead of giving it to android he says "no phone is perfect" 🤔🤔
who provide screen to apple ?
I use Apple and Samsung phones.
It nice but I'll go with the samsung
This was such a one-sided discussion. One person who is an apple fanatic and the other person who's trying to be a little bit more objective. Redo this discussion based on the average user.
If you care about value? Again a comment from a power user who has money. The average person cares about value.
The same thing goes with the analysis for photos. The average user is not going to make their decision on which system is best based on one or two niche ability in the camera app.
Could not disagree more about the battery. I love both of these guys, but most people are not the massive power users that they are. Battery life is the most important or most average users.
Samsung!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Final Conclusion.
This is insane. Wouldn’t say anything bad about iPhone without coming up with an excuse. I want to know what phones they use in their personal lives…
This shouldn't even be a Android(s) vs iPhone, it should be Samsung vs iPhone. Now these scores change
All these "I'll give it to iphone" points from Marques and on his page he says his primary phone is Samsung smh
I am using iPhone for about a year now and i hate it. I will definitely switch back soon. There are so much things i can criticized that i am not able to remember them all right now and i find new things from time to time.  Just yesterday i was in a train a decided to listen to music. Since i dont really listen to music i dont have any on my phone. I opened YouTube, found playlist started the video and the moment i locked my phone music stopped. Turns out video cant be played in background when phone is locked. In the end i just created hotspot and listened to music on my Android tablet (where it also stopped but there was option to resume it on lock screen)
Android VS Gryffindor.
I'm surprised and somewhat disappointed seeing Marques being so seemingly biased towards one side. It's especially bothersome in the multi-tasking category where you award points based on your two personal habits, and then turn around and base the features category on the general public's usage.
yeeeeeeeessssss!!!!! I am so glad apple won! I had an android for several years and it was the most annoying piece of garbage. Glad that I have an iPhone now.
That was one of the most biased reviews I've seen.
I really enjoyed watching this video and learning about phones I never heard of as well as the comparisons.. to me, I love being able to customize y phone with themes as well as using the app Zedge to customize backgrounds, message notifications as well as ring tones for people, I'm a HUGE wrestling fan, so using Zedge  is a MUST for me! My daughter has an Iphone and I've thought about switching to Apple BUT knowing there are things I can't do on Iphone that's no issue with Samsung, I may just stick with what is best for me, also my son tried an Iphone and hated it because he's used to Samsung as I am and doesn't like change..
I mean it's no secret Android has always been better than iphone. In fact I have both the 14 and the S22 ultra, the ultra is just much much better. When I say it's no contest I mean it's no contest. I am actually quite a technical person as well and use a lot more features on a daily basis than most normal people would and you'd expect the iphone to be better for that...absolutely the opposite. And when I 'm just casually using the phones again the S22 is better. The iphone is so annoying because it feels like a phone where you have to get a bunch of add ons just to have a normal phone experience, but the S22 you're set from day 1. I guess what I'm trying to say is with android you create your own experience but with iOS it's decided for you.
iPhone is sure great but I can’t live without android fast charging and dual app dual sim dual systems it’s just so practical which iPhone does not do it at all
If I didn’t pay so much for ios app I would of swap to android years ago, these guys have to stick to IPhone or otherwise they won’t get new Ios ahead of market
Meanwhile the battery on the black view rugged phone 10000 mah
Neither is. It’s like comparing red to green apples. It’s personal preference
this is such a bad video. altho i agree apple is slightly better, this video is full of sh*t
I thought this guy was a bit bias but when he said he would rather take photos for life on an iPhone over the s22 ultra yep he's full of apple shit
Your checks from apple are in the mail. What a joke. Zero creditbility here.
The lack of support for third party apps and software and open beta developer apps with iOS sets android aside in its own class as far as what the OS can do as opposed iPhone.
You can't compare I phone to ALL of Android phones. The whole point of Android is that it is catered to YOUR needs. You are not bound by one phone/OS/features. This is the dumbest comparison video I have ever seen. Not to mention it is done as an opinion piece and not facts.
Marques is just an apple fan boy
The iphone bias in this video is crazy 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
This comparison is stupid cause the guy on the left is paid by Apple, what do you expect him to say? Of course Apple edges Android  everytime. He would lose his  pay. He’s the only person that have these issues that are made up.
This is no comparison. It's a why I'm an iPhone fan. In fact, the correct title of the video should be: "WHY MKBHD prefers an iPhone". Otherwise, let's wait for a comparison video with an Android user on the set too.
the eco consciousness is all greenwashing from appel and from androids but appel pushes more against stuff like right to repair
Looks more like paid promotion from Apple. totaly biazed comparisions
sorry, but it looks like you all ways push towards the iPhone!
iPhone 💯
Nothing to be proud of but I have been using s21 ultra for over a year now and its absolutely an amazing phone.
I have been using Iphone for a year now, the only thing keeps me using it over my beloved note series by samsung is the battery, if samsung manages the battery efficiency then Im switching back.
If these guys buy a boat all of a sudden, you know it's with money apple paid them to make this video. Lmao jk. Always love your videos mate.
Obviously Android is better!  It's not even close. This isn't S22 Ultra vs iPhone 14Pro Max. I have no idea who wins that, by the way. This isn't flagship Android vs flagship IOS. So it's not even close. Android vs IOS is clearly Android.  Is Android better than iPhone? Yes. Is the newest, top of the range iPhone better than the newest top of the range Android phone? No idea. Probably not. But iPhone range is currently 14 (whatever). And you probably have a pro, a lite, a max, an S and blah blah blah.... But Android have more companies using their software and doing better in some aspects and worse in others. But on the whole, Android is *better* than IOS because it allows developers and companies to make their own phones.
It's simple, if you are poor buy android and if you are rich or an asian hooker then buy iphone.
So basically everything iPhone does is better. Sounds more like a fanboy talking
Wow! The worse video I've seen you do. You picked the I phone even when more points during your discussion went to Android. Way, way to biased.
How much money did you get from this American capitalist company for this false advertisement?
Your opinions.
Obvious Apple bias. My experience has always shown the Samsung Galaxy to be of better quality to its counterpart.
Stopped watching when they gave software features to IOS 🤣🤣
The main problem is that they compare Iphone with different androids, if you pick one android(no difference which) it will be a loser to an iPhone, i have been using androids for 12 years in a row and now I have Iphone 14, there is no 120hz, no over 9000 zoom and there is a notch, but still it feels better, because 120hz on android are laggy and eats battery, zoom sucks and the notch is not as bad as a lil circle in the middle, it’s really annoying. Furthermore multitouch on Iphone is better like you can cut a person out photo hold it with on finger and use others to switch apps, it was like a magic after android.
As someone who has owned iPhones only for the past 10+ years, including the 14 Pro this year, I don't think that was a very critical comparison. I obviously think iPhones fit MY needs better, but the gap between iOS and Android phones isn't that drastic. Just different strokes... The actual objective difference is marginal and definitely not a "7.5 : 2.5" gap.
When they give points to iphone for screen and charging  I literally lost faith in technicality
I still think android is better
I start from nokia...than iphone..than android all the way... SPen and type C is universal bro..
Soo biased! I used to respect you both, but come on! I used to use average android phone before my iphone 13 pro max, which was promised to have the best battery, but it still died much faster than my 200$ android phone. On the days I sit on my phone all day, I had to charge it two or three times, whereas one full battery would do it for me with the android phone. So, battery, one point to Android. Siri also, cannot perform as well as google assistent, I wish I could explain this in details. I used to rely on my google assistent a lot on my android phone, but siri doesnt really answer to much. It just says I found these on the web, and that is it. So the first thing I disliked about an iphone on the first day was the unsatisfying assistant service. If you try to install google assistant on iphone, it gets complicated. So, one point to Android. A lot of apps that are free on android are costly on iphone. Even as simple as setting a ringtone costs you on iphone. It finds a slightest possibility to charge you, it doesnt miss that chance. If you have never used android phones before, I may sound dreamy, but android deserves more than they are giving in this video. If you are not going to be fair, dont make comparing videos like this. Thank you.
I mean.. if you ever use them both it's not even a competition. Conpared to Android, iOS just feels stagnant and outdated.  Ahh.. so they aren't actually comparing things, they're just saying; I prefer this.
This guy triggered me cuz the iphone is very weak *compered* to other 2022 the iphone only works well with ios thats what makes it good
I notice that Aaron talks like how he was talking on videos years ago
Mrwhosetheboss. If you talking about the air drop and share play, Samsung has music share, quick share and also nearby share. How could it be a tie 😪😪😭😭😭😭. Android (Samsung) can really do things IOS can't match man. Bixby routines, Smart things. It just ain't fair. I just feel I'm just cheated here 😕 😔
The lighting is great. I loved it...
Well good luck getting an android camera to take an action shot that isn’t blurry. My wife has a Samsung s22 and the pictures are not very good at all she has to take a bunch of pictures to get one good one. I have been told it is a problem with shutter speed but not sure.
For Air Drop on Android, use KDE connect.
They must not know about APKs.
I need to get rid of my Android and get an iOS...
iPhone is a Lambo with no cup holder, Android is A Mercedes Maybach
Great video and it really helped me make up my mind. I was thinking about going back to Android to see how much they improved with the Galaxy Note but think I will stick with iPhone
Honestly why is this video on complicated metrics of many which are subjective?  let's just focus on simple things, like:  Shutdown: -- Android Hold Power Button -- iPhone: Press and hold eithe the volume button and the side button until the power-off slider appears. Drag the slider, then wait 30 seconds for your device to turn off.  Type a Nunber: -- Android: Press Number -- iPhone: Switch to Numbers layout on the keyboard, then press number  Go Back or Close App: -- Android: Press <--  -- iPhone: Swipe Left to go Back if you have gone forward, else swipe up from button to close app  Honestly iOS is needlessly more complicated than Android.
when jailbreak comes back to ios then i use iphone. without jailbreak there is no control of phone....
I think my issue with this review (and all the dislikes) is youre talking about an average between all androids and just "the iphone"  It feels like an AMD/NVidia situation. NVidia performs slightly better than AMD but wants to charge $500+ for that tiny performance in boost You can compare google/asus/samsung as an average but if you do that android is always going to lose because one of those products will perform just less than the iphone, even though the samsung could perform much better.  I got a Samsung because it is that much cheaper than Apple. I always hated how things that perform just as good on another device has to be exponentially more expensive on Apple. And the fact that we have more variety than Apple to me makes it better. If you don't like the Samsung maybe the Google phones are what suited you better. Theres just more variety.
I feel like Marques was really biased here and android should have got more points (Arun also looked surprised a few times but then let ios get the point), at the end there is not one system being way better than the other, it depends on personal preference
🤣 this was the biggest crap video ever.  I have both, and my girl has an iPhone.  The galaxy beats on everything except the benchmark score.  Not to mention the complete customization of almost everything.  Even the camera...my girl is all about taking photos and takes pictures and records videos on my s22 ultra...even co-workers, family and friends are all amazed at how much more I have with this phone.  For some reason NOBODY switches and keeps saying the iPhone is better...no sense at all.  Keep telling yourself whatever u want to make yourself feel better I guess...(seems like that is the apple fan base)
The narrow screen on the Samsung means I'm going with the 14 Pro max for the next 2 years....I've hated my s21 ultra for texting🤬
Answer: whoever pays you more to advertise it.
You sound like iPhone marketers and drag Samsung in the mud to market Apple products. It is strange when I listened one of your videos comparing iPhone 14 and S22, in that video Samsung took the day.
its crystal clear that mkbhd is an iphone guy, this is not fair
Lets just pretend like that dude is fair.
Unless you have the newest iPhone, chances are you are going to find greater success in an Android.
My take is that if you live in America, the iPhone will always win due to its dominance there, but outside the US it's a different story.
They forgot to give the points to androids for the stuff that apple didn't have or was best at.
I think what we learned from this video is that you shouldn't pick a phone based on what others say and you should do your own research based on your needs
This is bias AF IMHO
Android isn't a phone... this video is stupid... we ALL KNOW It's iPhone vs Samsung... that's a more fair discussion.
He is clearly just iphone user so pls next time ask somebody who actually using android flagships phones 😅 is really ridiculous to asking apple fan if is android better or not
iPhone still doesn't allow you to pause record 😒
Wow. You spent like 2 sentences on video. That sucked
I think the takeaway here is that for most average consumers (who aren't into customization, tinkering, developing etc.) an iPhone is probably a better experience than any SINGLE Android phone. I'd pick a Samsung for its camera, a Pixel for its software/ecosystem, a Xiaomi for its fast charging, a ROG for its battery life and performance... but for ALL of those things, as much as it pains me to admit, the iPhone is probably the best choice.
Marquis! How much did apple pay you? 😭
we need to stop saying android v ios, we should be saying samsung v apple because that's what it is really. If we compare all androids then apple wins but if its samsung v apple then samsung come out on top alot of the time.
Another point for Android for lets you move apps where you want on homescreen😂
As someone who used both flagship Samsung and Apple. IOS and Android (Samsung One IU) are jump completely different experience. Both very reliable and best option from both sides year after year. It really comes down to personal preference and which one u prefer. Comparing is like Apples and Oranges. Both are different and good. Some people like the stable all around of  iphone while some prefer the customizable interface, new and exciting features and wonderful display of Samsung. So at the end of the day, both are the best phone u can get today and which platform and company u decide to go with is up to ur personal style, preference
hardware, yes, iphone wins... software, ios is a no go for me... android is the present and the future.
How much did Apple pay you both ??
there is alot of old android phone (i.e Note 10plus) got more value than new iphone imo. don't waste money on new release as it's overprice, the bit of improvement doesn't worth extra $1000 yet.   we are talking about performance and gaming with big battery and without fast charging is good? i can't live without fast charging 😂 who don't require to charge after during the day after few months of use? i was looking forward to a good comparison but i wasted 20mins of my time. 🥲
Let's just act like Marques doesn't simply keep giving Iphone the edge
It might sound like a cop-out, but whenever someone asks me whether I think iPhones or Android phones are better, I always tell them it depends on what they're looking for. I've switched from iOS to Android since 2017 because of one major issue: with iPhones, I feel like Apple decides what's better for my phone for me.  From an ease of use perspective, that's great. But I like to tinker and fiddle with my phones, in which case it ends up feeling restrictive. I always felt iPhones were reliable. Just great to use out of the box without any hassles. But if you like to tinker or to experiment, I feel like Androids offer a greater deal of control or freedom. And considering in the current smartphone markets where most flagships perform so well (so well that an average consumer won't notice the difference in most cases) that it's less about performance, and more about user experience.
What model phones did they just discuss?
The only real advantage the IPhone has over the competition is integration with other Apple products.
Mkbhd will never leave tim cooks side
MKBHD always bend himself and give his ass to Apple... Buhahahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My score was android 9-1 iPhone that too for videos
I switched from apple to Samsung and am glad
What marques Brownlee likes does not mean he's the best to suggest us something.   He's an American where they are used to iPhones does not mean we should always listen to these guys
A used an iPhone from the very first iPhone upto the iPhone 10 and from then on a switched to Android and never went back. 😌 Here's my conclusion, I like iPhone's cuz of its simplicity, but Android is better, nowadays what an iPhone and what an Android can do are more or less the same but i would put Android on higher place cuz it can do more things and can perform better that's why I said Android is better and another big thing why I can't buy an iPhone anymore is cuz of what iPhone developers say, I mean those are the people who really know which is better (keep it mind that Steve not being here anymore changes a lot of shit, actually it changes all, I mean if Steve Jobs was still alive maybe an iPhone will be better than an Android)
iPhone is the better phone. let's just be real. no amount of specs and numbers beats iPhones' performance. plus, Android will never be as smooth as iOS.
I've been with Android since s8+ and I'm switching to the 14 pro max for better security. I have a mac and an ipad, so I can have them linked. I use YouTube a lot, play music and read the news. Any phone can do this. How many rich or celebrities have Android???
Comparing hardware to software? Next either state devices or os. Android is a software and iPhone is hardware. I hope that makes sense.
A bit disappointed with MKBHD's review, all things he was disappointed with S22 Ultra i have not experienced. He jumped the gun too quick and formed a perception on a device that has given me more than a year's satisfactory service. You might think the S22 Ultra did him wrong in a previous life.
I feel depend on what you use you phone for is what people prefer using the 22 ultra I have no need for a laptop all my Microsoft games are playable using dex the ultra is my tablet laptop gaming cpu all into to one and with the 1tb of space it helps alot I store important files and all now pn the other hand I do love the simplicity of the iPhone but personal option the Samsung camera is far better
Stupid af video. It's like they started with iPhone being better and made up reasons to make iPhone better lmao.
How much did apple pay you ???
This was basically an iphone ad...   Waste of time if you came for real pointers, tbh :)
Android for me, I prefer Google Ecosystems. I don't want to lockdown to Apple forever 🍎
For me the most important is battery, camera, performance, and social media quality, on android its trash
iphone dont runs emulators... android wins
In my opinion. Android wins lol
Technically android should win in all of the catagories because there is a phone for everything
He gave iPhone almost every point all while using an Android lol.
They mentioned a lot of good minor things about android, but didn't count it. Idk why! For me the most true and  important thing about Iphone they mentioned was The camera and Software update. But I really like Android and specially I am using Samsung (Top Samsung fan). Like most people Iphine drives me crazy and it has a closed UI, which they should've mentioned. Anyways good info👍
If u want a phone that restricts you and is limited get a iphone. Everything the iphone can do a android can and it's not the same for iphones being able to do what android does. iPhones overrated.
It sounds like he's paid by Apple. I was excited to watch two tech YouTubers talk about phones but he's so biased it's frustrating and ruins the whole video tbh. I also kind of feel like you are getting annoyed by it 😂. I unsubscribed from his channel. Hearing his answers pissed me off.
All these android fans saying “android is more customisable” When they barely use any of those features that are “better” than the iphone. I’ve literally seen thousands of android users and they have the most default homescreen design. So all of these android fan’s saying “oh but i want to customise my phone” and so on, theyre just looking for excuses rather than saying “iphone is better” because it is better in most aspects specifically the battery and the screen. So dont be deceived of what these android fans say about android. Theyre just lying to you and themselves  And its so funny seeing people actually believe this is paid from apple 💀💀💀💀 Grow up droid fans lmaooo
I think that another win for IOS is that you don't have get apple airpods.
What’s the most ethically run company? Apple has banned its airdrop feature in China and its manufacturing contracts practices are abysmal. I’m lookin for a new phone.
No matter how many cons with iOS. I am never going to switch to the Droids.
This video turned into iPhone vs the world
"android has a slight advantage" - ok let's call this a tie then "seems like they are pretty even in this category" - ok apple gets the point! "several android models do it better, but some don't". = point for apple!
I think iPhone is just more reliable and android is genraly more specialized. But a lot of people say apple sucks but that very much isn’t true it’s just not as specialized and is reliable
Acept the true....iphone is not like cool android but the iphone is strong securty and good update....
Bro @mkbhd is Iphone bias
If you're an eco person, you know Apple is full of crap with 2030...
It's Android versus iOS... Not versus iPhone. Samsung versus iPhone or Pixel versus iPhone but not a operating system versus a specific phone
Is getting the s22 ultra still a good option or should I wait for the 23 ultra
Guys lol... I've used an iPhone for well over a decade, and this review is so biased toward iPhone that it's embarrassing.  Love you both, but come on lol.
MrWTB is an android guy. MKBHD is an iPhone guy. And it shows
Pathetically iPhone bias.
Don't care what anyone says, android is king and I have had plenty of iPhone's to know
Android users, just have to understand most consumers don’t care about all those extra features. Some are probably cool, but you’re not going to use them in the long run. There’s a handful of features from android that’s on the iPhone that Apple users still don’t use.
Android users in they bag rn
The most useless and biased comparison video.. by these two tech jerks ..
Torrent, mod apk, root, fast charging, theme and display customisation, clipboard, design way way better in android
Im sad to say i bought S22 ultra... and no one on the Internet Support or trying to tell good about it... Its a super good phone by my sad truly.  apple is nothing infront of Samsung
This video is a lie. Samsung S22 Ultra is far better than all the iPhones combined together
bro this is the most rigged thing the other guy is obviously going for apple
Android for one reason. Keyboard functionality.
This was wayyyyyy wayyy wrong come on guys really if it was half half yess but most of it hell no just wrong
MKBHD is overrated
I tried iphone for a week and it drove me crazy. I felt like I didn't have control of it. It's like I have to do what the phone was asking me instead of me having control of my phone. Good features and apps, ok. Camera. Message. Good feeling in your hand. Battery, ok. BUT No pen. No multitasking. Big notch. Its price. No SD. icloud full the first day... The more time I spent with it, the less I liked it. Not for me. But respect and understand iphone users, it's a nice looking phone and offers good things.
Highly disagree on widgets being better on iPhone. Maybe Lock Screen widgets but the actual widgets on your main app screen are way better on Samsung in my mind.
Samsung beans are the only earphones that fit perfectly, so I will be forever Samsung.
Imo the iphone will always be better. Though, the only reason I stay on Android its because of the ability to hack games/apps, unlock free premium on basically every app out there from just downloading the modded version from browser. Yes, it is risky, but i also got my premium bitdefender(legally bought of course);)))
for every big thing that belongs to samsung, you divide it in half, such as the screen, user interface, camera system, and for everything in which the iphone is better, it gives you a slight advantage....you are not realistic, the iPhone 14pro max is a boring phone with a terrible user interface which costs too much compared to what it offers....Samsung offers much more for less money...eg Design, better screen, better UI, more complete camera system, etc. While the iPhone has only battery life and a better camera in applications such as Instagram, Tik Tok, etc
If the iPhone had a user interface like Samsung's, its efficiency would not be better than that of Samsung...iphone has the simplest and most boring user interface.
Google Duo and near share are on Samsung phones
Mkbh
mrwhostheboss is like younger me, and MKBH the older me. I've come to realize that i dont always need the top tier options and new features.
Iphone smoothness is better but with no doubt. the only and big iphone problem is same as always . When u buy iphone you are locked and you are not able to do many stuff as you can do with android , you have to play with apple rule
Iphone laugh at samsung because i am different i laugh at them because they all are same  Love s22 ultra
I'm team android all the way
I like the look of an iPhone but Samsung is better I have had my S20+ since it came out and it still works like brand new.
No one ever talks about radiation / SAR values.
So many butthurt android users in the comments 😭😂
I never comment on videos!  So far I have seen sooooo many asterisks with this is it Apple vs Droid or is it Apple vs Samsung 2 toatlly different conversations! You litterally can't get more eco than a Fairphone yet u gave the edge to Apple...SMH!!!!
I’ve had an iPhone for a year now. Its okayy. But I disagree, Galaxy had a way better camera. Selfie cam zooms out more for group shots, and it takes better low light pics. I don’t get all the hype with iphone. I think people are just brand whores. 😂
NIGGA PLEASE HOW MUCH DID APPLE PAY YOU TO GIVE THIS REVEW
No🤣👎👎👎
Think they missed the point. Android will run on anything. It's the world's phone OS. Samsung may make big flagship phones to compete with Apple, and Google may toss some high end features at the OS. But at the end of the day Android has to be able to run on a toaster because that's Google's actual market. Android has to be able to run on hardware anyone, absolutely anyone, can afford. Plus truly worldwide localization support. Android has support for languages I've never even heard of. Comparing hardware features of flagship phones completely misses the point of Android. Apple went shallow, expensive walled garden. Google went deep, every person on the planet is a potential customer at their price point. The two OSs are aimed at very different markets. And you know what, the numbers are in. Google won. Period. They own the global market share. It's not even close. Apple is barely an also ran.
I’m in more like the ps vs Xbox battle because I have an iPhone and an Android
I think iphone is better but many people buy Samsung because Samsung is cheap
The biggest problem with the iPhone is that it's a iPhone.
sponsered by steve jobs
U should have included longevity and life span
It is not only that iPhone picks up the  paste but also that android flagships trying so hard to look "premium" like Apple phones( I am aware that the main reason is money and not just the looks)  that push away the Android users by DOWNGRAITING  their phones by removing sd slots, headphone jack and many other little things(ir blaster for example I loved it). So of course now the phones are almost exactly the same having remove the things that an android user would pick an android phone for..
There are a few strong points missed here: 1) Windows compatibility 2) browser connectivity 3) online account's connectivity  4) Apps price range  5) Accessories comparability All these are really strong points for Android. I do believe Android will catch up the first smartphone populizer in no time.
This is CLEARLY PAID promotion of Apple because in almost everything iPhone is about as mid range Samsung phone but you both picked flashy expensive but average phone as a winner. SHAME ON YOU!!
I think this is a bias review …. iPHONE with so much points over android nahhh. I use an iPhone 13 Pro and I think it’s an hype
The phone that I'm on right now is 50$ and is the best phone I have had for price to performance, like if a person and a iphone with is pretty expensive, if that breaks it's a over hundred dollar fix or u might get a new one with is even for expensive, and I just don't think u need a super expensive phone to watch YouTube or text someone, it's a phone, it's a tool my phone does that same things as a 500 phone.
You really going to put Android back on the charging your battery life and charges way more better. I have an older phone I have an older phone red magic 5G 4000 milliamps and it charges 25 minutes and it lasts me all day and I am a heavy user
So for the rest of your life you’d not be able to switch the cameras during a video. That feature is the opposite of pro. I don’t know why they haven’t fixed it when you can on other apps. You also can’t do other apps while video chatting people. Also a sucking thing the iPhones do. When you find a contact on an android you just need to start typing it and it comes up automatically. Not on iPhone . I used android for 10 years and switched to iPhone about 9 months ago. But I haven’t switched back yet so this stuff isn’t a super deal breaker. I love the Face ID and the quality of the camera
The title should be android vs iOS not android vs iphone. Iphone is a model name from Apple it's not operating system.
I see dem guns, MKB.  Keep up the great work brothers.
Jesus so from the commentators u can see that android wins this battle with ease… and as an apple user i agree with that somehow😂 like lets be honest apple isnt perfect in many ways especially how they are always behind on things  when android have done it years ago… i only laughed when they said apple have better widget as their widget was launched  2 months ago 😂 and android had it 6 years or more and has so so many variety while for iPhone 60% of cool widgets are payed and u have to download apps and pay for a subscription to open them 😂 cmon guys
MKBHD did not disappoint with what I expected he would pick. Nothing new
Late here, no hate i watch both, but they just seem like an iPhone fans.
iPhone is quickly becoming a dinosaur  , however they will swagg their way off-stage or surrender to win , with a colab with Samsung introducing , yo f*ck that n***a  name ,  the iSung . UCC1-308  All Rights Reserved with copyrights. With-out Prejudice .
There are just too many downsides for iPhone. Imagine having to pay for stuff on iPhone which is free on Android.
That accent is perfect for saying his name 😆.
Samsung has started making underdisplay cameras.. while apple just gimmick with island super shitty notch..
The thing that i have noticed is people use cheap android and start comparing with Iphone which only produce clagships.. you have to use a flagship android like note or S searies Samsung or A Z fold then you can compare the usability of both Operating systems... by the way i like iphone but i love samsung customisation currently using z fold and watching video on full size screen a mini cinema like, on iphone i have to just watch with big bulky massive notch.. last thing samsung has better displays and better amoled hd+ display.. while apple just came into this display game with the help of samsung 👌
Usability practicality and flexibility are key featurez, which iphone missing you cant plug with PC for instant file exploring.. i used iphone and samsung many years but i like the way samsung One ui 4 gives customisation and better always on... while in iphone the videography is epic.. but sorry just for video i cant leave behind all the features povided by samsung.. now m using samsung z fold 2 which is 2 years old but running like superfast os12 one ui 4.1 ...
Android for me I can do so much for my money no strictions like iphone .period
How could you guys miss to talk about privacy…
iPhones are great because they’re just phones. They work, they are smooth and reliable and supported for years with software updates. Class leading cameras and battery life. So you get more than enough for your money   Nobody actually cares about all of the silly features that android phones have. It’s all gimmicks, and that’s why apple are the market leaders. They don’t need to throw a load of gimmicks into their software, it just works and does everything the average person needs a mobile phone to do
So you pick an iphone user to talk about what is better .... sorry but i do think this guy is biased on iphones. Also you compare iphone to Samsung when android has way more companies that support this OS
They really didn't mention at all that -> if you own a Samsung Flag ship, it can be a one stop shop.  Let say you dont have a pc, with a HDMI to usb C cable -> you can enter dex a desktop experience.   And if you want a full desktop, you can install A FULL LINUX DISTRO on Android and either access the shell or have full Desktop emulation.  The endless customization, the endless access to your hardware  Root -> over cloak    And the list goes on.  Android as a operating system is a million times more a computer  than iOs will ever be. iPhone is just a phone that takes pictures and video.   A strong android is a legit computer in your pocket, you can program on it, you can use it for hacking etc.
Android give you freedom vs iphone give you limit despite it a very stable OS and good for editing
that guy is a huge fan of apple
Samsung + Android = BEST SMARTPHONE EXPERIENCE
Ios = fascism ... android = democracy
I personally believe choice Trump's everything. Apple doesn't have shit for choice compared to budget phones that carry android. All the way up to the top tiers. Android phones as a whole win more peoples hearts simply because of the price and options. Literally $200-2000 there is some android phone for everyone. Apple is a yuppie pretentious status symbol that really for the tech isn't worth the extra money. Plus android has way more options to improve your systems launchers and UI.
Andriod wins
I Never Own An Iphone and don't planned to. I'm Familiar With Android Phones.
its like youre trying to make things up to give apple points
The most trivial and stupid comparison between Android & iOS. They picked the most flagship of phones without considering other ones.
Best case would be to have an android as a smart phone and then iPad for tablet.
I think tim cook is shooting this video thats why mkbhd is afraid to tell the truth😅
I think mkbhd bums apple
Both have their pros n cons that's why I have both 😆
What about value in country where iphone costs double than in US. Android has quick share, nearby share in response to airdrop. Ability use any app and browser on android not just safari browser.
Most selling premium phone is iphone only.
I like Marques' style. Sharp looking guy.
iPhone will always be my go to.
I wonder how much Apple paid me to spit on Android. Android is many times better because it is made to work with a colossal amount of combination of different components like processors, memory etc. With the apple, they are super limited. If Apple were to make a system like Android, it would certainly be the most buggy operating system in the world. Android can share and connect with other devices while apple doesn't want to do that with products from other companies. Not to mention that the nutters have sadly reported that many of "their" technologies have been cheered here and there. Android's interface is much more convenient than Apple's. My niece has an apple and I try to avoid helping her when needed because finding and navigating the apple menus is a real nightmare.
I love both these creators however I found this comparison very bad to me it felt like mkbhd kinda asserted dominance against arun when he was trying to counter and arun was just like yeah whatever I'll let you win hahaha    But as for my system of choice for the general public that buy a phone to ise socials , camera etc I think the iPhone is a better choice however for the people who are into tech and All the amdroids are better    Like I run both for a long time but every time I try ipone within 10 minutes I get pissed at the iPhone and be like no that feature should not be as hard as it is example fathers iPhone 13 you need to hold thr volume down and siri button to shut it down what's up with that  And like to me iphones just feel boring hahaha and any time I pick one up to try I'm like what the fuck os wrong with this phone
I never watched this channel but the dude in black T-shirt seems good host den d wyt T-shirt guy
Getting pockets full by making ppl watch unwanted content gr8st job on planet
Shut d —- up carbon neutral may it neutral ur postive pocket
I personally think android is better, just because I've never held the so-called holy grail of phones, the iPhone.
I hated watching this. They seemed very inclined to one particular product and even wanted to give points of android to apple.. get lost
my first android was a HTC tattoo and it had android 1.6 on it, I've had androids ever since. I just dont find iPhone UI as intuitive, and I find a phone with a proprietary charge cable in 2022 ridiculous.
Tie on display   seriously.. black tape on top of the display while playing game make no sense..
From a look on ur faces i can see that you guys dont like your own opionions, almost like its forced to choose one over another.
1:23
Android is better because you can get emulators and play wii games but you cant on i phone which is not good for gamers
I'll be fossilised before Apple catches up!
Good video.  I bought an iPhone for the first time in my life. Only the iPhone 13 but I still love my A53 5G. It easily blows away the 13. Maybe the camera isn't as good but I'm not on any social media apps. I've speeded up the system on my A53 and it really flys.
Thanks for this video! It helps a lot with figuring out how to move to the next great device. The conversation and setup was a journey BTW. Very nice!
iPhone has too many swipe gestures that make using the phone for most people difficult. Most don't know about their app switcher or control center.  My apple user friends love the phone support and brag about it. But that's because they need it. I've never needed tech support for my android.  Forgot your password? Account Recovery for iPhone is by far the worst. You should never need to wait days or weeks to reset a password. Period.  They didn't mention this, but camera options on high-end Android phones simply have more options.
I've been back and forth. iOS is very smooth, reliable and well rounded, but there's just something I never liked whether it's the os or the phones themselves. I honestly wish I did like them because of the above things plus iMessage and facetime
Lol he said “ Androids IPhones “ haha anyone else catch that ?
No one mentions The biggest plus for iPhone. Customer service. Amazing. And  value on the second hand market. Apple keeps its value incredibly well whereas androids are basically worthless
Disclaimer This video is not sponsrd from Apple
Really surprised me

My father has been using an iphone 13 pro max ever since it was launched and it is wourked perfectly fine no glitches
I think ram shoud be importent in smartphones.... you ecpecially expirience it in video editig and gaming(although i don't game) it is very important with ram... + to samsung.
I've used and owned a lot iPhones and Androids over the years. And my conclusion is that both suck. Apple has great hardware but iOS is still very limited compared to Android (and Apple is shady as hell). Androids have crap hardware but good software. Perhaps there was an argument back in the day, but honestly nowadays both worlds are mature enough that if you went with either, you're really not missing out on anything big. Both get the job done and very well at that. It all comes down to preference now. Choose which parts of the phone (battery, camera, screen, etc) that matter to you the most and make a decision based on that.  I personally think this video is slightly biased towards Apple. The categories seem to favor Apple more. And I disagree with some of your points, software features is a draw really? All the points you mentioned like share play and airdrop are all completely replaceable on Android. Odd choices.
Software on Apple is not a win for me. Air drop is cool but it's only nessasary cause you can't just transfer files like android. And it locks you into no options. That dependency on one way only in apple is a loss for sure
for software features, iphone has features like ocr, remove image bg etc.
If you ask me the only 2 things apple got better than any android is design and videos anything other is worse on apple products than android
U cant call yourself hardcore user and not multitask.that reason alone for me to choose samsung/android.
Eco friendly win goes to iPhone... a phone that is designed to make it harder to upgrade or repair a phone yourself so you need to buy a new one every 2 years..
Stability vs innovation. Security vs autonomy. Simplicity vs functionality.  I've used both, but I'm one of those minority who prefers that many features androids offer. Having said that, I do recommend iPhones to majority of my friends and family depending on what kind of phone users they are - knowing they just won't care for all the cool features I tell them about Android. Autonomy is the biggest thing for me. I paid 1k for my phone. If I know what I'm doing, my phone should be doing what I want it to do - not me being controlled by Apple's paternalistic approach because that's "safer" for me. Give me a warning, double warn about it, then let me override if I choose to.
Android has great battery and charging on most of the phones. Iphone loses on that. My god he is one sided. And the idee of super fast charge is to...i don't know, Have more time in your life?! So you don't spend another hour waiting for you phone to charge.
I have used both for many years and I like both brands and OS but for last 4 years I’m using iOS and iPhones because of the simple reason that it is just better ( at least for me ) I don’t need most of the features that Samsung and android offers, the only thing that I don’t like about 14 pro max is lack of usb c but tbh I don’t care much about it and yeah iPhones are overpriced too but other than these two things I really like the overall user experience of iPhones also imo Apple makes better Watch, buds, and Tabs and even laptops.
Nigga is just an iphone pleb it doesn't even count.
Great video. Getting my S22 ultra with the watch 5 on Wednesday 🥳
When you Have Money, Apple  Ecosystem is the best  in All Sector
how the hell does eco-conciousness go to iPhone? the moment you can't repair your phone because all the components are paired and are forced to buy a new one because even apple refuses to do the repair, all the carbon neutrality bullcrap falls out of the picture.
At the end of the day, the Best device is that One that fits into tour daily routine and lifestyle
I really like these awkward moments where after you shake someone's hand and you wait for a follow up, maybe with a fist bump like in 20:09 but never happens :D
WHERE are points for LOUNCHERS in android, counterpoints for OBSOLETE  homescreen organisation of apps(iphone) and windows/widgets on ANY screen (not only lock screen jeez wake up apple) etc etc etc...  I love MKBHD...but this is BUUUUUULSHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT a comparison which is better WHERE he talks clearly from bias perspective as an apple fan boy,  like "if i gave this to your mom and and widget" - AM NOT DUM AS HIS... , I HAVE that phone is made for DUMB people, LITERALLY , i HATE that in everything, only ONE way is right way for apple in everything even if its the DUMBEST was ever , this ALL is clearly a fking BS ,  HOW they dont talked about that apple obsolete homescreen sht  that you cant ORGANIZE your apps in ANY ways and put widget / widows on ANY screen and anywhere in anyshape , jeeesus this   it shill sht.  am disgusted from both.   this is like "ooh yes android is better but I PREFFER apple because my subjective sht that i like the "aesthetics" more on that like...HOW it looks??? the widgets its irrelevant its choice for everybody, I LOVE that i can totally reform my phone every month with just download LOUNCHERS and .... this is just wrong , WRONG.
Every year I get the pixel, the fold, and ultra, and hesitate with OnePlus but I always end up with iPhone. I think I’m gonna go ahead and lock in with Apple it just works 🤷🏾‍♂️
That was a nice dap at the end tho ✅️
Great conversation btw you two. The ultimate great guest to have
13 pro is my first iphone... Im amazed by the battery, I still cant believe how long it lasts. Yesterday I was using phone as internet hotspot(lte+bluetooth) for 3.5 hours on the bus, while I also used screen (not whole time, but most of the time), and only 40% dropped.. on my S9 when I only listened to music on internet (no screen, no bluetooth), it already dropped like 60%...  iOs also has some small annoying things, so no system is perfect:  - You mentioned that you trust iPhone camera, because you had problems with android, that the picture was never saved. Funny, but since the last few udpate on my 13 pro I press camera button and nothing happens.. or it takes the photo 2-3 sec later, when I already dont focus the subject.. Very annoying, and it happens quite often, not only 1-2 times... this is the biggest down currently for me  - no shurtcut for GPS in the control centre - copying files to windows laptop is a nightmare. It gives error, but in the background it still copied files... then you realise HEIC extension doesnt work on windows, I purchased a 1$ app from store to make it work. Its not about the money, its about that I tried Itunes, native copying, 3rd party app, nothing worked... and noone mentions this, but YOU HAVE TO ENABLE A SETTING IN IPHONE, that when you copy files to Mac or PC, you have to keep the originals (until you dont enable this, some conversion is the default, and the copying starts, but stucks every time after like 10 mins...). Otherwise the process I wrote first also doesnt work. I know I cloud and things, but hey...
We know the baseline battery does not go to the iphone based on actual testing and real life data.
are u mad.. can you plug pen drive to iPhone and then to your Windows PC. Can you access all internal memory in Iphone. Can you upload or synch gdrive in background check.  You both know nothing how intensively people use their mobile phones.
Why did u take he is pure ios guy
as someone with both best iphone and android i would prefer android this is a biased opinion
The blotware om samsung is what kills the bat
I didn't watch the video but I can give you the facts.  The IPhone win on ruggedness and battery life, also connectivity.     The Android operating system absolutely destroys apple.   Honestly,  the iPhone operating system is so bad they should have a hard time giving them away.      So, I guess iPhone wins on marketing too.
I don't get how MKBHD prefers the iPhone in every aspect yet he uses S21
I multitask like crazy. Android ftw
iOS us for Americans Android ya for whole the world. Even for Africa
Bruh. Android has Quickshare and nearby  share. Which are pretty much the same like airdrop. And it's older than Airdrop
Sqmaung is my lov3
Feels like this video is more on the appraisal of an iphone
i thought i saw a guy wearing a pink tutu skirt and diamond design fishnet tights with one of dave's high heels and a black braces strap shirt, so i thought i wouıd take a picture of that, the next day it was never saved dam! i had to take the b***y waste of money phone back and get my money back.
So I would say for me I don't want to go broke buying a phone, so I choose android.
I just despise apple as a company. They do terrible things.
I think it really comes down to what you will use it for and that stuff that you like to mess with or use like i would like to customize so i like android and i dont really call or text people so i dont really need any of thati dont care for the camera so ya know whatever and i like how the way they have thumb print and face id
Marquis you need to turn on the sound settings for the haptic motor it's basically a sound imitator that works neck and neck with the haptic engine it gives you more awareness every time The phone vibrates for notifications or phone calls does matter to a lot of people For example good luck is an app that I can't stay without on Galaxy Google messages isn't app that I can't stay without Samsung notes isn't app that I can't stay without Google Assistant is an app that I can't stay without speech to text is very important to me Samsung internet is so great to the point is better than Chrome in a lot of areas so to me that's important because I use both there's a lot of things that's important on a galaxy that's just as important on an iPhone u just didn't know it till you actually use it especially if you have any invested in Samsung ecosystem just as much as heavily I'm invested in both both ecosystems are great but I don't think from my experience the iPhone can match the Galaxy in a lot of areas is struggling and I think people's simply bored that not so great design anymore sad to say but it's true but that's my opinion
Iphone guppies
La pantalla de Samsung siempre será mejor que la del iPhone porque Samsung les fábrica las pantallas y también LG Apple no fabrica pantallas por eso no es ni será el mejor en cuanto a pantalla porque Samsung siempre dejara lo mejor de lo mejor para ellos mismos
Dayum they are so biased!
iphone 15 with type c universal charger
This is the most confusing video ive ever watched. I love you.
Someone smarter than me said that Apple makes a phone for everyone, and Android makes a phone for anyone
Android is the one for me ❤️
Even with that landslide victory for iphone I would still go with an android. Ig the biggest factor for me is the freedom it gives me. It allows me to adapt the os the way I like and the overall custom phones there are.
One thing I don't like about ios, is it's apple. While android is EVERYTHING else.
I had the 13 pro max, and I'm going to be very honest I switched to the s22 ultra, and I'm not going back ever.  I like it way better. Battery life is a lie. I get all-day usage out of my phone, and I use it all day. I have a USB c flash drive for extra memory. I can easily transfer everything to my computer. I can see why kids like it, it's like when sidekicks and aim and all of those things were out it's easy to chat to everyone but as an adult who cares about that anymore.
There is no 'better', it's all opinion-based.
I have been an android user since the galaxy nexus phone and coming from a blackberry I was blown away by every thing that I could do... Whenever I tried using an iPhone I felt very confined... Barely any customization, lack of expandable memory, ect... It didn't feel right.  The one thing I have to give props to apple, is their marketing! They are able to get people to spend more money for a very basic product.  Samsung isn't the only android company, from Google to Sony, Motorola to Huawei, Nokia to Asus and everything in between, you will find your perfect phone!  Android allows almost seamless connectivity between other phones, laptops, desktops, basically anything with a chip and Bluetooth/wifi can connect to an android without needing extra apps.  Talking about apps, there are so many apps for literally anything you want to do! If on the slight chance you don't find one, you can even create your own!  Phone build quality varies from brand to brand but the flagship models offer the most reliable phones. You even have Android phones that are built for active military conditions and will literally work in any environment without a case!  I've owned a wide variety of android phones from about 13 different brands and I can go on and on about every specific characteristic of each brand. None of them made me wanna pull my hair out because of lack of features or disinterest... The iPhone stresses me out to the point of being sick because I could name 20 android phones that can do everything I want or need for half the price! Why would I pay more money to be restricted?  If you want a smartphone to be like everyone else and just use it for YouTube, browsing, taking generic pictures and you want to spend money every year because Apple will worsen your phone to force you to update, get an iPhone! If you want a phone that reflects your personality, gives you the freedom to do whatever you want to and will be easier on the wallet, consider getting an android!
Love my Note 20 Ultra 5G ....the s pen is very handy.
Why wasn't anything about notifications mentioned?
i carry both iPhone and Android daily.  (fold 4 and 14 pro max specifically)  i honestly thought this conversation was going to be allot better than it was. i use each phone for specific things but if i had to get rid of one, that iphone is gone! but i like having them both. and if you can do it, its the best option.
for assistant, i only used for timers and remainders. that's all.
Results are terrible haha
Iphone lovers making a samsung vs iphone video... nicee haaha
How the fuck is display a draw? You guys have some problems haha
One blows up, one does not. Enough said.
I know people are gonna always say Iphone is better than Android but br fr. Iphone is a company that releases 1-2 lines of phones every year. Essentially with the new Iphone out you're saying that one phone is better than ALL the other Android phones. Android is and OS not a phone. People will look at one Android phone and say that all of the phones using the OS suck but it doesn't make sense. Android itself is really good it just matters how the phone used it. Now I know Iphones are excellent considering all the specs and positive feedback from the users for the most part but you can't compare a company to an OS. Nor can you compare a single phone to an OS. Unless you were comparing one line of phones specifically to another line of Iphones it just wouldn't make sense. You can compare Samsungs to Iphones but you can't compare Android to Iphone. Though that is just my opinion and you may say it is biased. I would like to see what others have to say considering I mainly use facts to back up Android but nothing to support Iphone.
MKB, What are the Android phones with spectacular value.... I'm in the market for a new one
actually android would be high in demand due to its vast range of available substitute. Or if you consider a photographer, he would go for a DSLR than a cellphone, unless he's rich 😅 So i would suggest for you to compare flagship android with iphones because or else it wont make any sense comparing just android VS iphone.
If the iPhone is better than Android why the Android his take the world for me the Android is the best os I ever see in my life because he give you free user experience more than ios
switced to 14 pro iPhone from years of samsung flagships this year - never going back to Androids again. Not that they're particularly bad or anything, it's mainly just the enjoyment factor. I am enjoying the performance of the iPhone and I can really appreciate the thought that goes behind nearly everything that happens on the phone. It's just better. The camera is astounding on the 14 Pro too. Animations are super slick, design is unmatched, the phone just looks and feels perfect in every way to me.   I used to hate having to go through iTunes to transfer anything from a windows PC, especially music but with spotify or other streaming services - I don't really care about that anymore. I mostly email myself things or put them on my google drive anyway.
*I lUVVV MY IPHONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
*everyone started with an android, unless you grew up privileged and with money, then you started with an android as your first phone lol*
the other guy is just being humble he know android is better...thats why he chose it instead.
F android phones am with SAMSUNG and i think its better and make android better if u only compare it...F all android phone and F iphone never liked it
when two iphone users make a video
S21 is better than the s22. I kept my 21 ultra rather than "upgrading". Because it is really a downgrade. 21 ultra is an amazing phone. I also use an iphone 13 for work. So daily, I used both side by side.. the Samsung is WAY more capable. And I mean WAY MORE. but iphone does have a few cool features. iOS widgets are not widgets. They are trash. On a stick. Google assistant is OK. But bixby is really great. Siri is OK some times and some times not. Siri and google both trigger to easy. Bixby does not. I hate that you can't move the apps on the home screen to a position you want. Andriods are still far more customizable. Some times to the point where I am actually disappointed in apple because I fully expect a little more.. like.. am I doing something wrong? This phone should have that feature. It is new enough.
I miss multitask from Samsung on my iPhone loved the feature was very useful
I've had many phones, both Android and iPhone, and I'd say I enjoy the iPhone user interface and the Apple family of products better (I have an iPhone, iPad and MacBook Pro.)
Sorry, i don't agree with your statement regarding battery life. I had both the iPhone 13 pro max and the s22ultra. The iPhone dies within 10 hours every day where as my Samsung lasts all day even in the cold weather. Try leave your iPhone in a cold day in your car and it won't last anything more than 2 hours.  Even my half of my family switched to Samsung due to begter pictures quality than iPhone. I have never seen a good photo for iphone other than portrait mode. First time had to dislike your video as well.
Wherever Android is slightly better, they are splitting the points. Sometimes they are comparing iphone with ordinary phones instead of flagships. I know iphone users are running for charging everytime. But they give battery point for iPhone. Iphone marketers
This is horse shit
You can actually have a mode on Samsung phones to mimic the simplicity of an Iphone. So you can get the same experience with a Samsung.
Iphones (pro) are so common on than s22  ultra.if uniqueness is big thing for you go with s22.
No mention of slave labour during production or robbing the buyer
WAKE UP REALITY
To me the fact that they have to hand-pick from several phones to compete against just one iPhone, tells alone tells you the answer, IPhone is the best phone ever, period.
Android has by far the better Interface. Way more intuitive, Apple products are Like a maze.
It's not really about the hardware, which Apple definitely wins on speed, efficiency and battery life.  It is about long life, support, updates, UI/UX and Apps.  I have both iOS and Android and Android wins hands down on annoyances, mercenary spam and pestering. Plus instability and barely any updates.   I grit my teeth and stick w Android just to have a better camera at a lower price. I won't pay laptop prices for a phone, no matter who makes it.
guys apple is a phone system that does not collaborate phone app to  contact app. you can not touch letters for corresponding letters with iPhone and it suggests corresponding names on the contacts. you must go to contact to dial a number or must know the number by heart. i phone is that smart. i mean negative here
Idk why but it seemed like Arun was really trying to be fair, but Marc was being a bit biased towards iPhone. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Android is way better than Apple. Apple just has the apple ecosystem like FaceTime and iMessage. Besides that apple has always been light-years behind. It's more a fashion statement then a better phone.
13:37 What phone is that???!!!!
I get that iPhone are great but I literally can't support the proprietary BS that Apple peddles and how anti consumer they are with repairibility.   I feel like that should have been one of the points here because like eco friendly it is also quite important and one of the main reasons why many android users will never support Apple.   I do also wish that there was a 3rd or 4th contender in this lineup.
Multi window is a cool feature that I don’t use either.   Android being hacked to death made me finally switch to iOS. With widgets, background apps & multitasking I just feel a bit more secure. Phone feels mature as well for some reason if that makes sense. First time I could type fast without clean up as well.
In the end though folding wins hands down over everything else.  Having a tablet in your pocket is an clear winner
Thats why android sucks kids
I'm not quite sure if the eco debate was enough without mentioning repairability not sayign iphone shouldn't win that point or whatever it's just wihtout a proper argument that point is meaningless
why people call Samsung as Android , Android is an OS not a phone or compagny , the brand is called Samsung not Android bruv 🗿 and if people call Samsung as Android , why not calling Apple as iOS?
I have always been a android user specifically samsung recently i switch to iphone but i feel that iPhones performance and battery backup is good but samsungs users interface is very friendly and displays quality is the best. Performance is also very good on samsung phones
Uhhhh yk when you do these vids you should not be biased
Really??shorts??😂😂
It's this freaking simple. If you don't own other apple products it's not the phone for you. Iphones are only great when you are fully in the apple ecosystem
Both of these guys are heavily invested in the apple ecosystem so no crap it won. This stuff gets old. IOS world wide market share is 28% give or take lmao.. USA people are oblivious.
This video paid for by iPhone lol
Also, Android is really good at piracy
Correct me if im wrong but isn't the only thing iphone has "best in class" the bionic chip?
This was an interesting watch. I thought Marques was a Droid guy.
i vote for android
Android
Instead of the video the ads is more interesting 🤔 should I cancel the video and click it again to watch the ads
To put it simply if you are of higher IQ and understand tech - Android. If you aren't as smart and like aesthetics iOS
Not as good a collab as i expected. Maruques clearly was reserved on his opinion. He is using an Android yet his comments were one-sided speaking for iOS. They avoided the file transfers, compatibility with the most widely used windows environment (esp in workplace), the price an average user would be able to afford, the charging lines... etc. Disappointing
Battery in iPhone wins even with 20% left after 24 hours? I have like 50 left after a rough use on Android. I don't even charge it to a 100 ever 😆
iPhones are to flex Androids are for if you want an actually good os
Android 😊👍💥✨
iphone is very optimized on all third party apps
I think it all depends on how you live day to day.  If you want a phone designed for a very specific job or function, android is the best choice, it is very customizable and can suit anyone who needs something specific or just wants full control over their phone. Apple is one company, that’s makes four versions of one phone per year, that is not a lot. iPhones are the “Jack of all Trades. They do not excel at predicting me particular aspect. They focus on creating a simple phone for the average person’s needs, they focus on having a reliable phone that is always there and ready and simple to understand. I am a simple guy, so I am an iPhone user, but I have used a Samsung Galaxy twice before.
The whole video is one sided!!!
i dont know why they bothered talking about android when clearly these are apply fanboys.
Who cares  Loyal customers don't listen to your destructive lecture.  Last week, I bought an S22 Ultra.
It is nice to see how far ios has come for customization but its a far cry to tie with Android. The ability to run your own launcher alone is complete control.
They work for apple everyone knows iphone is the most stolen phone in America they basically are just talking about great pictures but Android has great pictures also it's all about function and iphone maybe fast but Android is why easier when it comes to work Flow
They are acting like everyone cares about what they are talking about.   Nooooo.      Can I download what I want   free of charge  Can I use my phone without Icloud  Can I do cloud gaming  Can I install a computer system without jailbreak  Can I print files without Icloud  Why do I have to pay for apps that are free on Android...  Why is face time so important when Android has Duo.. and can use Instagram
This is just Apple publicity. Waste of time.
You know when you're talking about iPhone versus Android, you might say about things like how operating system works since on Android. I am free to use any software I want while on the iPhone limited by the things that Apple was me to download me to execute my device. So I think that Android phones are superior to iPhones just like Lenox distributions to the windows and Mac OS. Also on Android phone I'm free to use any custom operating system like pixel experience or any other like miui
Definitely, iOS is better. Android is always has inconsistent UI, performance across devices. Objective-C is a C language way better performer than Java. Apple refuse to support Java.
This is a total BS biased review
But I still think Samsung is better because an iPhone doesn't last that long because they make every time a new phone and everyone upgrades but Samsung you buy a Samsung phone than it last like almost 2-3 years and I don't have to worry to upgrade every time
Android is more crapy and less secure
What games are updating on iOS first? Almost every game I've played is the exact opposite
Used to like samsung, then the battery exploded
This was an awesome video guys!!!! You two definitely need to get together more!
Android still the best, USB - C, easy to use, fast upgraded new stuff, more innovated always see Android phone get new idea first, best performance, and with the same amount of money you can get better phone in Android and more good.
One thing you fail to realize about the rooting community is most of the popular and game changing features that are NOW integrated in the OS came from the modding community.  PIP, popup notifications, and multi screen to name a few!!
SD card !!! Android wins give it 10 points. Download music and make anything Ur ringtone free
Great insights on value ...what's important and what works for your personal needs.
20% recycled material but you cant repair anything, only replace. Android is better by far on that point.
Try the iphone 14 promax its a clear winner
I'm intrigued to hear a Brit say Google Assistant is better. I think sometimes the results are, but usually, Google Assistant doesn't understand me, but Siri always does. So I use Siri on my iPhone, even though I have Google Home Hubs and Nest Hubs all over my home.
digital island be like: bruh the notch is gone
The choices, the ease of use, the freedom to do what you want with your own phone is something IOS will never have and every apple user can only dream of. You can't even copy an image or doc out of iphone storage like android and honestly not like apple doesn't spy on you lol
I've always been an android user, apart from a year or so when I had the iphone 4S (which I did not like), but apart from that I've always been an android user and specifically a loyal Samsung user since I got my first smartphone (I believe it was the Samsung Galaxy S2). Samsung has never let me down yet
I'm using both, I like how iphones are so smooth and almost lag free. And I love how Android are so customizable when it regards to themes.
U gave the environment point to the iPhone?   Knowing well that if glass backs.. apple will change the whole iPhone for that and charge u. How is that environmental?
Other than iMessage, I use my old android for as much as I can get away with. Better file management is just a necessity for me as much as iMessage. New phones… I buy I phone, but I’ll always need an android device on hand.
Baby need to learn famous youtuber don’t have any knowledge  stop subscribe such youtuber.
Your both deluded and crazy to even think that apple is better. Apple is complete shite. It's a load of crap and the fact that you both don't know that, makes me sick to even think you've got the following you have.
I absolutely hate your fan boy video, disaster. I can not accept this rating at all. Android takes better photos, the rating should go to android. Sorry but this video was so bias like if apple paid to make it. Disgusted by it
Which one is more secure?
Asian 83.34% android users vs 16.1% on ios. And most of the ios 16.1% users use iPhone for just an status symbol.
My first phone was Motorola db250. Then I changed to Nokia and Symbian os. after Nokia n93 died I changed to android and until last 2 years I have been with samsung, Huawei and Xiaomi and always thought Android is the best.   Now for last 2 years I use iPhone 12 Pro with all features of apple. to be honest android give much more freedom and customisation but if you need a stable phone on which all apps will run and not worry for performance issue, crashes reboots etc recommend Apple.    Only down side is if you use it as much as me for work battery life will not last much but still will go with apple.
Brought to you by Apple.
A whole bunch of mobile vs a mobile 🙂 still iphone wins 🤣
In the End it’s Mostly a personal choice but it’s good that both exist cause than they want to better than the other so the phone evolution goes on
I hav 13 pro and fold four customization on fold 4 is another level
Apple 😜
If I am spending 1k$ i am getting an iphone.  If I wanna spend under 200$ I'll get a simple base android.
Yall apple users are like clowns sometimes. Yall are so arrogant and think you are better than others when owning an iphone. Lol.
Everything iphone is best 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That notch looks obnoxious! Deal breaker. Android all day everyday!
I will never buy the iphone woth that lame notch! Never had an iphone. Looks ridiculous watching fullsxreen videos!!!!! Hell nawh.
In wakanda forever it is stated that that iphones are primitive
Software is much better on Android, the display is much better, the pricing is better. I wanna try iPhones but it's lacking in so many ways. I have no idea how it racked up so many points.
Was that goalpost alive? No... MKBHD just moved it constantly.
Money is a huge factor.
The most asinine thing about iPhone, well next to its continuous limitations, is the fact how the owners accept it as something all good, perfect, and desirable. So much so that no one changes the ringtones, everyone rings as Kim Kardashian. This idiotic culture, this mentally stunted and magic mentality is the worst thing about owning an iPhone.
😭
warrenty is better for iphone. ive waited without a phoen (s22 ultra) they wont give me a temp
As an loyal IPhone user I just wanna say that even tho Samsung didn’t win … Samsung lives matter too!😂
Isn’t “value” the phone you use the longest so you don’t have to buy another one?
Consistency between apps in iOS was something I always missed on Android.
With regards to software support Android has better legacy support because they don't deliberately slow down older devices. I do wish they would offer updates for older devices for longer though.
This is just sad. Starting to think apple pays for these videos.
We ask the biggest youtube Apple shill to tell us if android or iphone is better.  I manage 1400+ apple devices (iOS and iPadOS) and use them every day and am responsible for their function. I use exclusively android for my phones and it is clear, this is a very biased answer. US does skew HEAVILY Apple though, the rest of the world uses android and it isn't very close.
bro he gave iphone everything cuz he has a iphone, im getting a iphone 12 and i still belive android has better battery life
here is a scenario. you have an iphone and a computer and you want to send a file from the iphone to the computer. internet is a no go. how do you do it.
Eco consciousness, seriously? Expecting from Apple who runs sweat shops in China and have been caught multiple times + fined to have deliberately slowed down older devices (recently in Brazil) so that users buy new ones and just throw away their old phones. Not to mention, where the heck is customization? Android stomps iPhone's face on the curb when it comes to giving your phone a fresh new look
Stupid comparison, makes no Sense, you are comparing the most priced phone on Apple Side, with a bunch of others that cost way less, and even ignoring a lot of splendid phones for a way cheaper price tag.
Slight bias when apple win the adaptability cus they make it slower but better. Not everyone is buying a new phone every year.
Wtf does eco friendly actually have to do with the phones themselves
Android stocks after this video 📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉
I think Android is a great company and amazing phone but it really just depends who you are, if you do a lot with tech and use your phone to do more than playing a game watching and messaging and use it for coding then android is way to go, apple is more stable and simple to use in general, and the privacy they have it amazing
Honestly, bias aside. You cant constantly make arguments for iphone to win every close call, and every landslide.  Android have better battery life, but iphone wins, androids have better gaming, iphone wins, androids have better eco friendly options, iphone wins again, android has better stills, iphone wins. What is this? lol. Apple is great, but whats this logic guys? lol Android has 10000 more features, and iphone wins because it has imessage and airdrop? Customization is a DRAW!? because of lockscreen widgets? That literally doesnt compute.. Iphone doesnt even let you organize your apps however you want and its a draw lol. insane man..
No points for best assistant? Siri sucks
Any windows phone user here?
Biased
For starters, Android has many more options. You can get the phone that's right for you. Then there's the ecosystem. I very much value the option of sideloading apps. Finally, Android is highly customizable when it comes to the GUI. The iPhone isn't bad but it requires you to buy into Apple's vision rather than getting exactly what you want.
Marques is like , no fist bump ? :))
From my personal experience, ever since switching to Android I am not fearful when my phone updates that the update will obliterate my battery life and phone speed. With Apple my phone would get worse with every update. The thing that finally got me to switch was trying to program an app for iOS on a mac. Fuck macs.
MKBHB…giving most wins to iPhone…..I’ve been using a Android for over a year now.😂
I use multitasking in samsung a lot and  i LOVE it ! I am willing ignore all other factors for this alone.
Shame on  both of the guys!!  both are a prostitute of Apple.. an agent... its totally a ridiculous comparison... both are making fool of the humble consumers.... they are so called tech reviewers and totally biased...
This whole video is very opinionated, it's not an objective "which phone is better?" It's just two people talking about their personal phone preferences.
samsung has a better display, has better wallpapers and wallpaper management, easy to create groups in contacts to send to email or messages, samsung has a row of number keys on the keyboard, it integrates better with 3rd party smart devices. apple has facetime which i never use, imessage which is not way better.
Crazy IPhone is the better tech, U.S.A. is just to good made in America the only reason android sells more is because there made over seas where there’s way more people
I love the fast charging. I never have to worry about battery even if I have to go out and forgot to charge, I know the few minutes I take to prepare is enough for a useable charge.
only reason I have usb-c is because my PS5 came with it. But is also has a usb-c port so I can use my usb-c to lightning cable. Plus I have an iPhone charger for the car and my bedside so I’m never in need of a charger
Why are we using eco as a grade?  No one actuakky cares about that when they buy a phone
To pretend a hole punched for a camera is somehow different than a notch in its obtrusiveness is simply ridiculous
Android is. Next video
Me and my 14 are enjoying this race for the glory video😂#14 or nothing
Ahhh come on this is so biased lol
Two Gigachads of techtube collaborated
I've had both and have always said. iphone is easier for the easy things and harder for the hard things. The biggest reason I don't buy an iPhone is that I find iOS annoying.
The Pixel is the iPhone of Android and way better than both in this review imo
With the gaming conversation. You can't emulate on ios you can on android
i laughed so hard when my friend opened his apple app store 😂 shits a barren wasteland
Does anyone feel that although apple took a lot of time to refine one feature in iphone, apple also kept its loyal customers away from that feature for a very long time. So I cant use usb c or split screen or spen until apple perfects it????  Moreover, if android doesnt provide new features, apple wont even try to work on them and perfect them.  Think about it !
I have followed @mkbhd for years I’m upset YouTube has only started to introduce me to you now .  Love you’re vids I binged last night
I do not understand this comparison and the way the points were allocated to each of the phones. There are 100s of features which android has been doing for decades which ios started doing recently. At one given time, an iphone is never upto the mark with an android phone....
For me everything goes to android besides how smooth it is for games
i have both and there's a lot of stuff you cant do with iphone. android is more for productivity. also iphone plays games and try's to manipulate users.
the only thing that kept me away from apple is when they did terrible PR moves such as trying to stop 3rd party repair like making their own special screws, making software changes that makes it so only an apple store is capable to fix the device, design flaws (bendgate and snazzylab's imac) that for some reason many denied it's existence, and trust issues among their authorized service providers.
Thank God we do NOT have monopoly in our smartphones. We have at least two competing with each other - and thus as customers we get good services. Whether Android or Apple, if we had only one - we would be doomed. Think about many other companies you wish they had competitors!
I feel like this isn’t really a very fair contest considering Apple is just one brand while Android is spreader across multiple brands
aple fanboy
Doing the comparison now, now that Pixel 7 Pro is out, would inevitably change the scoreboard quite a bit
10+ year user of Samsung and like 2 year user Iphone...The Iphone wins 100%.
Another plus for android is you can connect your android phone to any pc and access your files instantly. Also in this video it sucks that points for android doesn't count because "not alot of people are using the feature"
Biased review
As of someone living in a colder environment. Iphones have shutdown problems in freezing temperature.
What do you people do to get so many "viruses"  had a Samsung forever and never got virus. IPhones are ok. They are basic. Easy.  If that's what you like go for it. I like having something that's actually new in a phone.
nice apple ad
They talked about eco friendly being a point but they changes phones on a yearly basis, meanwhile I used my iPhone 7 for 5 years before switching
I  think you may have missed a huge category: how easy it would be to change from one to the other. I've never used Android, but I can't imagine going through the hassle of abandoning stuff on my iPhone or converting it to Android. I have no idea of course, about the reverse procedure.  Without this ranking, we can't calculate the weight of the other ten categories from the point of view of whether supposed differences in ranking make it worth while to change.
Not even close.   Come on.  Apple
BS video, it got NO credibly data, it is 100% your opinion, and no real testing were made, so ask me what is best, Coca-Cola or Pepsi, and then if I say Coca-Cola that is then facts, and Pepsi is then just bad...
Bro don't care bout android💀
Battery to the iPhone 😂😂😂😂. No iPhone i ever owned lasted it's battery for more than 1.5 or 2 years Max. I used samsung for 4 years without changing battery.
Dude you don't support android enough
Dude mkbhd is a biased iphone user. He is not the right person for this video
look at all these Butthurt android users cant accept the bitter truth cry on you 🤡
Mqbhd has always been more or an apple fanboy. I remember his studio tour literally everyone 10+ people used macs. Really weird position for what is supposed to be a tech reviewer. He also def cares a lot about aesthetic
iPhone is a great tool but you must adapt to it : it's for "Apple people" Android is a lesser good tool, but you can adapt it to your needs : it's for "people" Ex : On Android I can handle more file types, like Flac, and share the files over Bluetooth with any device (except Apple of course) Moreover a phone is a machine you have all the time with you and therefore risks being broken, robbed, lost, etc.  With Android you have a choice of very nice phones under 500€, making bearable to loose a phone and having to replace it. Totally understand your points, but I think you totally underestimated a lot of things.  Which somehow is normal, since there are as many needs as users.  And that's why, in my opinion, Android is globally better although being less good, unless if you are willing to become an Apple person (and I'm not saying that being an Apple person is better or less good)
mkbhd is so biased
Androids are way better Apple are greedy and basicaly recycle their stuff
It's cool Apple fanboys
I kinda hoped they'd bash each other's heads with respective phones.
I know Android is better in a lot of ways, but I still prefer iOS. Partner uses Android and can do a lot of things I can’t, but I don’t need to do them so don’t really mind lol.
I never knew such biased yters were a thing 💀
Apple is already beat android in many way as for their software, the only thing i hate about Apple product is just how hard it is to transfer file from Apple to other device, i still use android as a phone and windows as a PC and had iPad 6 (just got it) and wanted to transfer some file with bunch movie/anime in it, but holy crap its so confusing,  i don't really need to sideload stuff i'm this point and time cus i don't really play game anymore, so Its not really a problem, and IOS OS is really fucking nice with 3rd part pencil going with it i could make my iPad to become drawing tablet to, witch is nice  idk why people hate Apple so much, its not like' they force you to buy their product, you had a choice, like me
Like srsly on what earth u think i phone display can compete with Samsung flagship😂😂😂 I phone is better but to reach in Samsung's display level like infinity curve it needs to evolve 100 times😂
20:08 you left him hanging :(
hold on. you're comparing hardware/software to software but with multiple hardware versions? that makes no sense.....
iPhone may win but who cares, Android is always the best, no matter what, not that shit iPhone.( Try checking out Android phone Redmi note 10)
This video feels soo one sided, like it is literally based on MK's opinions, which honestly ruined the video
I was surprised to hear that mkbhd had issues with taking pictures on Android. I have literally in about a decade of using android have never had that issue
Android phones have better hardware than iPhones. However the sad sad reality is that the OS is shit. iPhone only has value because of its OS…
Im an iPhone user but camera goes to Android for have up to 108MP and night vision and 100x zoom
This is BS to no end first, most of the population cares about the price of the phone. So you should not compare flagships you should compare the 500 or 700 dollars phone vs 700 dollars phone if I compare to computers I would never compare 2 computers of 2000 dollars is not what the viewer of this videos cares about. And they did not mention repair availability , commercial loyalty , and the ammount of software you have access too FOR FREE , and what software for cheap of free is not an option ? Seems almost sponsored .
can't use Imessage as an example of something everyone need and uses. Android has something similar that is cross platform called RCS and apple is refusing to support an open source protocol that would finally make Iphone to Android communications to be secure but they choose not to.
Both are great! I love my samsung . Still usuing my samsung s20 plus with the Sd card😍
I think android is good it offers more stuff that Apple doesn’t. BUT android needs to work on their apps like email is the worse it’s more streamlined in Apple. Apple is easier to use BUT it has too many security logins & it’s annoying. Just depends what you are looking for.
I would like to know if you have always been an Android Samsung phone and want to switch to Pixel, vote on that? Because I'm over the bloatware! I want a pure Android experience.
Google Drive, Google Photos are important to me. I important to me to keep my photos on the cloud because I'm a photographer and sometimes I do phone photograph. With Google Photos all the pics on my phone upload automatically.
Android! All the way!
Remember the iTunes don't allow you to download some of the games that I like to play some of them aren't even able if you were to jail break it to use the android apps you still can't get them because the phone won't allow it plus I've always hated iPhone and now iphones are just reject android technologyRemember the iTunes don't allow you to download some of the games that I like to play some of them aren't even able if you were to jail break it to use the android apps you still can't get them because the phone won't allow it plus I've always hated iPhone and now iphones are just reject android technology I can never get behind a company that will not update its software It's software still lags behind any other phone even with the new update on the iPhone 14 And when I was in a phone store they tended to break a lot more often with a thinner glast so if you actually compared a phone side-by-side iPhone loses every the r***** plus I do a lot of gaming of half the 2 side-by-side the further you get into a game the longer you play the worst iPhone gets compared to an android It tends to glitch more with longer uses like for me I'll charge and use a phone all night Samsung can keep up Apple can't
Interesting… but you didn’t contribute your opinion much eg. Photography for you it’s android for your guest it was iPhone but iPhone won the category…
MK will always be an Apple fan boy.
I'm an android user when I tried using an iphone in 2012 I was so frustrated using it especially on what type of phone user I am and also app restrictions on apple doesn't help at all
There is a 0% chance that Apple wins the environment section anyone who believes that has fallen for apples marketing, and this video was so bias for Apple.
It almost seems this video was made to ish on android 😆
Apple is garbage.and android is awesome
Android battery can hold longer than iPhone 😂
I totally disagree with this video. I switched to an iPhone in December. Biggest mistake ever. I miss my Samsung Galaxy so much! The Galaxy was faster, had a lot more features and I could download so many apps that I can’t download on iOS. Going back soon!
Love Marques but this was heavily biased. Android won more than was given to them.
Like no personal feelings but apple is the worst(annoying/company)  So much restrictions compared to android  Like you can't even download apps from site that you have to pay for in the store  Or the fact that their budgets phones are like a scam   The se 2020 for instance is way more expensive compared A71   I mean what's the point of having an overpowered Chipset like A11 if battery capacity is below 2000 mah  Pretty much garbage if you ask me  Or the fact that it's hardly repairable and so on
I see someone got paid by apple to boost their products   Thought this channel had one of the reviews that weren't bias bit naw  Am unsubscribing
Buy refurbished phones off Amazon. I got my galaxy s22 for 400$. If u wanted an s10 plus it's like 200$ lol. They work perfectly fine, and if u have any problems u can send it back for refund, or reeplacment for free.
I prefer Android for games because of modding. Try creating and installing mods for games into an iPhone and get back to me.
All the android users at fighting for their lives in this comment section.
I think both are fine, just depends on which one you prefer,simple as that
Apple is king of smart phones. Androids are for people who cant afford an I phone 😂
Fast charging in android  Flip phone Zoom S pen  Bigger screen 😂😂😂😂😂
🥴🥴😆😆😆😆
Whenever you two do a collab, it feels like Marvel and DC working together on a superhero project
Android is good 😊
scrubbed to 19:45, didn't watch the whole thing...but to me it has to have an sPen so Android (S22 Ultra best in class right now, wait nothing in its class actually) or else that phone is just a toy or just for show..need phone for work/productivity. If i need to take nice photos I'll use my full frame cameras (Nikon Z9, Z6) and real lenses, same with video. My 15yo teen can have the iPhone.
Ive had the american versions of both the iphone and samsung. I personally enjoy samsung much more, however iphone is a good product as well.
I feel this is so biased
2 iPhone fans guys comparing to android  We already who win
We need this but with the iPhone 14 and Pixel 7
You gave the iPhone the ones that needed big thought and you gave a DRAW for reliability?? IPhone wins reliability any day
But Apple use planes for the transport of their products.
all that is IPhone ad...
Totally blew off Oppo for overall end results in photos and camera quality. I still have my Find X2 Pro and that phone takes the best photos of any camera phone I’ve ever experienced
I only found both of these creators yesterday, and I really only have this single video to go off of. The scoring here feels off to me. Verbally, they seemed to be giving both platforms a fair review, but the iPhone kept getting a full point in close categories whereas the Android was given a draw. I'm an iPhone (well, iPad) user myself, and it seemed odd even to me. It's making me question if I can treat both of these guys as reliable review sources. Not sure just yet.
Rigged
APKS>>>>>
I have found speech to text unusable on my my work iPhone. I count be eating a sandwich while  dictating to my Pixel and be just fine.
Regardless of how these score against each other, the difference is not that substantial. There are a lot of great phones to choose from today. I’m an Apple guy and I know why I personally prefer it but I’ll never say it’s the best out there. I recently encouraged a friend to switch to Android because of the value he could get in that phone over his old iPhone. Pick the phone that works for you 👍
what color is ur apk?
I dont get it, both of you are apple whores, and then you get to decide which one is the best? That doesnt make sense.
Are y'all simping for apple because apple paid u say this? Huh just it say that all the Android companies are better than IPhone. And apple doesn't have battery ur just letting the iphone win because apple is paying u now. You just edit the video and make everyone feel like that apple is better than android then once the person buys an iphone and sees that iphone has horrible and then unsubs to u do u want that to happen an apple phones are only 3.4 star rating and all the other Android phones are 4.5 star rating.
I like how they give iPhone more points but still use a Samsung. 😂
Big wins for Android   -no intentional slowing down with updates -multitasking is MUCH better when Android, particularly videos and video calls.  - Android is loaded with more features and customization - Android has better Microsoft office apps, and has more tablet like cross functionality  -Android has more stable running environment for background apps while iPhone is  - Google assistant is actually a functional part of the phone, and pivotal.  To see apple win this by a large margin is disingenuous at best
I could've made a much better argument for Android
this is iphone bias at its finest lmaoo i am all apple tho so am okay w it 😂😂
Android is definitely the best
@mrwhosetheboss I genuinely really like your opinions on everything I've watched from you but you totally just let this dude like.... Decide the first 4 categories. You sounded like oh yeah it's close but android or Samsung then you're like so it's a tie. I couldn't even watch the rest. Seriously it's so gross watching a long time android person love the most boring phone ever made.
Android 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎apple💚💚💚💚💚💚💚😈😈💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚😈💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚😈💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚🤣🤣🤣🤣 (this is a joke)
the eco conscious section had me weak asf
The real difference between the two is marginal. My opinion is if you are willing to go for pro level phone, in which you want to pay $1000, go for iphone as it is solid in all aspects, but if you are on a budget, willing to pay less than $500, then android is your best choice. In fact you will not lose much compared to iphone.  I am not convinced to pay a premium for ultra level android.  I am using Poco F3 bought last year for $350 and I am extremely happy with it. I bought it as a temporary phone after my Samsung phone screen got broken and the cost of repairs was almost the same as what I paid for the Poco phone.  During the same year I bought iphone 13 pro for my wife and son, and iphone 13 for my daughter. Aside from better camera capabilities of the iphone, the difference in other aspects is negligible.
Sorry android but I will never go back
cool does iphone support memory upgrade? like can you put SD cards in it now to make the memory bigger like android does?
Biased judgement
This black guy is biased.. paid by apple company
Not good comparison..
I would rate it differently: 1) Display, Iphones are behind Samsung phones so they should be better hands down 2) Performance, there are android specific gaming phones that would perform much better, Zenfone 9 would last me for 2 days straight with better RAM, Headphone Jack, Better processor than iPhone 3)Battery - always android. Never seen an iPhone with a better battery than an equivalent android 4) Camera - usually iPhone as an all arounder 5) Eco - iPhones would last you 5 years without feeling outdated as long as they don't break (they are not very replaceable). Androids are usually - buy a cheap phone and switch every 1-2 years 6) Software - I had more bugs with iPhone than with Zenfone for example except for camera inconsistency  7) Software Features - Android has them all - iPhones win for those in the US who need to use all the iOS specific features - draw 8) Assitant - hands down android - no one is using Siri. Even in the US people would prefer Alexa 9) Software Support - Iphone
If people got  made fun of for having an iphone then everyone would get an android. Most People don't buy what they truly like they buy what everyone else has.
If you are genuinely concerned about environmental stuff don't buy the one that requires a proprietary plug unlike most electronic devices on the market
at least have other folk like MrMobile so we can have a fair discussion.
I know for a fact that iPhone is superior to flagship Android phones in many ways for years now. But I just hate how much Apple tries to lock you into their ecosystem and their capitalistic approach to things. i.e. Right to repair (or the lack there of), forcing you to purchase specific accessories, etc. It's not wrong, they're a company and a business after all...   And also, I hate the fact that iPhone users are literally all using the same phones... I mean there's nothing special about that.   But when you talk to a person holding another Android phone, you get to start conversations. "Nice Samsung! What do you like about it? I like my Pixel because ____"
Based on the questions that were asked, Apple is the clear winner but android is still better by far... Apple makes great hardware, but Google makes better software... smart phones are about the software
it depends what your friends have.
IDK how Iphone is better then samsung but... its better
He is American, will always back American phone (iPhone)
Android all the way...... Apple is so locked up.... You have to use this app for that...less choice on apple
And I'm still rocking my oppo find x3 pro and still look oddly at anything else pmsl
I like iphone because of its smooth transition animation i had s21 but the animation were not smooth
It doesn't matter which phone you really love or hate, iPhone and Android are just the same (except battery capacity).
Just ratio what you are getting to the price Android wins all to none
this is a trash review...photos 📷 iPhone really???
I don,t like the apple
Mk is just a iPhone fan boy so always going to say iPhone I completely disagree he's just biased
BULLSHIT! when iPhone as one of the least repairable phone gets the eco point you know it's bullshit
wdym android vs iphone your putting an OS up against a phone
When you want to charge ur iphone and connect ur wired headphones to ur iPhone at the same time
Totally biased towards iphone. when in comes to weakness of iPhone , it just slips in seconds...but when in comes to samsung or S phoned , they just bash it. imaging in S22 Ultra is much much muchhhh better that iPhone. and what about the fact that iphones fo not connect easily to everyday devices like windows laptops?
what does display has to fo with borders !°°°
As a PC user, I found Android to be more easily understandable.  Apple has it's own eco system and I guess I am just not into all that expensive preference.    I am glad Android phones exist because it gives us consumers more options to choose from, and not all of us could afford Apple's financial standards.  I actually felt sad when Microsoft windows phone gave up in their phone os.  More options is better for all of us.
I like the square edges
It is so wrong to compare android and iphone. andriod just an OS with fast and open features. every venders makes it bit deferent. andriod so much wining in many ways. I have used android my whole life. when since iphone 13 I have switched to iphone due to trying new phone and iphone!!! as other suggested. But android is far better. your judges come from ones using Iphone and IOS his entire life. bring someone who used android A LOT!
2.5 Samsung 7.5 apple  Quite shocking results
o mY gOD Is tHaT aN AndROiD?!!??! uR SO poOr LikE GEt aN apPLe
Battery - android Features - android Camera- android( Google pixel series)
my thought your more of an Iphone guy like alot of people
I totally disagree with y'all
In display finger Print Scanner in Android.
I am a prepaid user but in my opinion its stil basic you use your phone to make a call or  texting what ever the technology the phone has to offer right now the most important thing os that either you have a wifi or a postpaid subscription or  what yo u  have  a load or something whether you are an an IOS or  Android user , my point is first it is matter of preference between the user of what advantage  that the phone has offer for his or her usage second even with the best tecnology rhat the phone has to offer it is still useless why ?  You cant wven make a call or use the phones features like surfing the internet or the socialwdia if you dont jave rhe money to pay for a subscription  to a telco
Android doesnt brake when fall on bed like iphone
sorry but the guy your with does not have any  idea what he's talking about
Dear Samsung... Support your devices for 5 or more years so that we get a value like a jewel when it's time to resell and upgrade.  Build a solid and easy to use eco system, stop! compressing my videos when I SMS invent something like iMessage and I WANT to use native Samsung app. I do not want to une 3rd party apps to achieve this. Building a decent device that flexes is one thing but if underneath it's a crappy software what's the point !  Your hardware innovation is great but the platform is horrible.  I want a Samsung in my pocket but Android is just not making it happen.  Roll up your sleeves, and figure something innovative on the software and that edge curve screen on those fat flat phones, kill it now.
Unless I missed the elephant in the room, did you guys touch on longevity? As iPhones get older, they are notorious for their "system" issues - so much so that there have been lawsuits.
Unbelievably biased
🤣🤣🤣. This was an iPhone video
Iphone has lots of things better, but is much more expensive. Also Android has something amazing Iphone doesn't : Youtube Vanced.
I'd say it's unfair to compare iPhone to an "average" android. IPhone is among the top brand so if you compare it to the average of the competition it surely would win.
Long story short ... 2 iphone fans making a comparison video
Battery goes to Ios in stead of Android🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hahaha you make me laugh🤣🤣🤣🤣..... Android is the best in my opinion .
Having dealt with both, I hate how inflexible iOS file management is wise, sometimes you just want to move and fiddle with your files as you please and having the chance of plugging a flash drive into the phone is awesome... But I absolutely loathe what Xiaomi and Samsung do with the OS... They clutter their damn phones with so much crap, and Xiaomi goes even worse plugging goddamn ads everywhere! Granted, there are Android One devices, but they are getting difficult to come by and Pixel phones availability in Ecuador is pretty much nonexistent. At this point I must say I side with iOS, the software experience is way better than what Android is offering right now.
Freedom = Android
i mean their both really good sooo
I almost disagree with everything
W
Elephant I’m the room. Why can’t I see the DCIM folder to download my photos from the iPhone to the hard drive. So many of us have this issue and Apple state that it’s not really designed to interface with a PC and works better in the Apple ecosystem.  Very poor
iPhone
It's a matter of preferences Android = Options Apple = Must like what Apple sells you.  🤷‍♂️
I remember you saying something about the vibrating issue. I have the s22 and I have the same issue. I don't know why they made the vibration so weak.
I have both the iphone and s22 ultra i must tell you.. iphone feels like a toy in front of s22 ultra
What about iPhone 14
AOD on iOS is one of the worst things I've ever seen
In Asia there's an iPhone when opened it shows an android welcome screen 🤣
Was this a sponsored video? 🤔 so many categories where it's graded so subjectively in ways that are just absolutely forced to iPhone wins. Really crappy video, haven't seen something this bad from Mrwhosetheboss before. Really really disappointed.
You're interview a particular user who happens to be Apple fan. Whatelse the answer will be lol. You should done better than this Arun.
Just bought the fold 4 and I don't think I'll ever be using a normal form factor device again .can't wait until this tech is perfected and price dropped .
Man this videos alot of bullshit. You give iPhone the win for the best panel because most android phones aren't as good, but admit to Samsungs flagship having a better panel, but then flip flop back when talking eco friendly and only comparing by flagship. So panel debate, all androids considered, eco friendly debate, only flagships considered. What did apple fucking pay you two or something? At least try to be fair and consistent.  You also both agreed Google assistant was better than siri but didn't award the points. Whats the fucking point of this.
The fact that you HAVE TO PAY FOR A PENCIL which is worse Than what Samsung offers is just f@cking my mind and the repairs dont even talk about it next you have to press the shit button two times in a row fast is an other thing that bothers me next the auto correct when you are typing is extremly frustrating and the android phones just look better and what the f is FaceTime and iMessage ?? Someone please Tell me next the screen to body ratio is just killing me next IOS doesent hava energia saving mode WTF ! thank you for reading this trough
I have an iPhone but I was really rooting for android to win
Pointless video, full of bias, want my 20min of life back.
Mkbhd guy feels like he has been paid by apple to do this.  I couldn't really comprehend how apple won in terms of battery, Androids have higher capacity along with 10 times faster charging.  Speaking about cameras , phones like redmi and samsung have iPhone's beat.  Performance, if you are going to compare the entirety of Android to iPhone then there is no way it's beating  Rog phones in terms of performance.  Next features , I really don't understand how did you make it a tie, when Android phones have features that iPhone users will never find ever.   Only thing useful he talked abt iOS is iMessage and all that crap.  I am disappointed in MKBHD , Arun seemed more sensual compared to him.
Pathetic Sitting in US, it's easy to go for apple You should consider rest of the world Apple users are just blind worshippers.  Apple is double the price If iphones have best performance, then why the heck gaming community and tournaments are played on Android  Photography, i prefer real what my eyes see, Android clear winner, cause reality matters can synthetic edits by ios  Another Category you missed is Customisation, Android clear winner.  What about 3.5mm jack on iOS, where is it ? Now pay another bucks for pods...  iPhone is just a piece of expensive overrated phone, they are purchased for just one purpose, to show off others that I've phone with half eaten apple logo on back ☮️
iPhone on top
Samsung
I think android with additions like the pixel have made apple and Android categories a lot closer than it used to be
Both my devices are factory unlocked for any carrier too always on is better on iOS haven’t checked on android 13 yet it’s a close battle
I’m using both s 22 ultra now running android 13 one ui 5.0 and iPhone 14 pro max iOS 16.1 I’m juggling between both I like iOS a bit better but have done digging in the new android 13 yet just updated it. It’s a close deal here. But the battery life is better on iPhone 14 pro max so far
Samsung>apple
I would say Android is better because, first there is a wide selection of specific needs like, specifically I need 12GB RAM. I got it on android well iOS. No. Second, it's more customizable with like themes and the exclusive phones, all Android. Apple is stuck with SRTICT modern UI. And last, you can do illegal things which is something we shouldn't mind like, getting paid app for FREE. But just don't get in trouble. I don't think you can though.
I have a question.. between iphone and Samsung, which one can film YouTube video better??..
What is that nood talking about, novadays even Adroid smartphone for 300$ works great
me who bought the S22 Ultra Thinking The Camera is Going To Be better then the iphone 14 me: watching this video💀
this is just mkbhd being apple fanboy lol
The “un-laggy” nature is enough for me to stick with iOS. It felt like a night and day difference when I switched
I've never used iPhone ironically bc of my friends that use iPhones. They look like a cult w/ the same everything, they look down on the color of a bubble 😆 they are locked in, their phones always seem dead & they use my port. battery more than me, & they have to constantly delete things. I'll just stick w/ Android more options w/phones & tws earbuds thus not making me feel like a follower. 😆
I don't get why the screen is a draw if you both agree that the samsung's better. Like sure there's Android phones with worse screens, but we're not comparing a 150€ entry level A32 to an iPhone Pro Max or whatever. iPhones are expensive, thus they should be compared only to expensive Androids, especially looking at samsung's here, that point should've fully gone to the Android side.
I love adriod adriod as more storage and ram dam iphone
Adriod is better
Steve Jobs knowing he will lose: I am once again giving you financial support
Nah.
That curved screen makes applying screen protectors absolute hell
Asked myself half way through...why am I watching this video when I'll never buy an iOS device 😆 🤦
New title: "2 Apple Lovers Pick iPhone over Android"
Iphone js fuck phone it sucks
What phones can you do more with? Androids, case closed
Its no way that iphone is better
So the black guy admits to Android being better with battery life but rather choose android? Yikes!😬 These iPhone users are obsessed
Switching from iOS to Android in 2017 was painless. Switching to iOS from Android in 2022 was painful. Who is to blame for the transition experience?
Feels very biased 🤣
Who cares who's better everyone knows about themselves, get something done in life losers
That guy mkbhd he knows nothing about phones android cameras are way lot better than iphone for god sake he should go back to University and get an engineer degree
You can't have multiple iCloud accounts at the same time on iPhone. You can have multiple google play accounts on Android. The Do not Disturb feature on iPhone gives the impression that calls are being disconnected rather than unanswered. Other than iPhone SE no other device has a fingerprint scanner too. You can't even download and organise MP3 tracks directly on iPhone without a Mac/PC. Also no call recording on iPhone.. the list of dealbreakers on iPhone is endless
APPLE DOESNT EXPLODE LIKE SAMSUNG
For Us Iphone and Samsung are better
can i get a free phone pls
s10 5g or iphone x which one should i buy guys.....pls help me out
when I saw prices I was like: *121% android iphones are too expensive*
lol.. I skipped this video just after watching the 3rd point and realising how partial and biased you both are towards iPhone 👎👎
This was the most stupid video you guys did so far. Cheers
I’ll take iPhone for as long as it’s the only phone to have Face ID. When other phones come out with good Face ID then I might explore options. As of now the only options are between iPhones  I never had an Android that was good. Either I hated the conferring awkwardly on the back that would work half the time. Or the auto brightness that you needed to adjust constantly but I never even thought about it on iPhones. iPhones also had 3D Touch which was a huge future but that’s gone now.  Also I like the stainless steel built. It means I have dropped my iPhones and not a single scratch let alone a dent.
Maybe i'm wrong but there isn't a clear multi-window gesture on Galaxy's, the way ios does multitasking is so much better and this is coming from a galaxy user, you just swipe down, drag to side and open up another app but on samsung, you have to open recent menu, hold down on app icon then tap on split screen then pick the app, just a lot of time,  maybe if there was a quick gesture you could do then yes I probably would use multi-window sometimes
Funny how Marques gives 7.5 | 2.5 for apple and still uses android for his daily driver
Video was like give 0.5 points to android and all others to iPhone
One thing that I wish I could do on an iPhone if I ever get one is changing the default launcher like you can on Android
There's an Android equivalent of Airdrop, and iMessage and Facetime are mainly relevant in America where they are the most services in their categories, in Europe they're pretty useless
If Iphone is the best in all these options, I will never leave my Samsung. I love my phone, never will I get that simple minded Iphone.
@2:00 "the Samsungs a little better"... "sounds like a draw to me"  iphone simp logic.
You gotta understand they are comparing just the iPhones with the whole android industry. And iPhones are still better
iPhone always my favourite. 💕
Lol apple slam dunks on android
my problem with this is .. both of tthem use iphone...... there is none android user there so its obvios that they are gonna pick iphone the better phone
If you go to statscounter android users worldwide are 72% while iOS users are only 28%. In the US 55% are iOS users and 44% are android users.
I've never seen that much BS in 10 minutes as in this video. Even when they agreed that a feature was better on Android they gave the point to iphone?!? give me a f*ckin break!! how much did apple pay you?? what a pair of 🤡
Music... Audio.. Sony..Beat ALL rivals. Enough said.  Experia 5 II vs Iphone 13 pro,... Same performance, better camera, for 1/4 of the price.. Enough said. Apple is just overpriced, gloryfied garbage. Not to mention the amount of bugs the new apple os came with its just laughable...
much of this video is like: yeah android is better, but i prefer iPhone, sooo... point to iphone
android definitely wins. I bought my first iPhone (iPhone 14) this year and I'm completely disappointed. I think it's because I had high expectations. I transitioned from a Samsung A20 and I think it's still better in terms of usability. Like I find most tasks are impossible or take longer steps to complete in ios unlike in android. Nobody talks about this but wtf, if I want to mark multiple pictures or messages i should just hold on to the item but on an iPhone, I have to go to edit and then choose select. Ill probably sell it after a year or two while waiting for Samsung to Huawei to blow our minds.
I know when it comes to hardware, Android kills it, but kinda get kidnapped by apple already, dang..
Did he just say that  the notch is the biggest notch he’s ever seen because it’s an Android phone?  Or did not he hm clearly?
I just realises, MrWhoseTheBoss' youtube name uses the wrong "who". It's "who's", not "whose". Who's is "who is" shortend to a single word and Whose is used for someones belongings. Example: Whose bike is this?
iphone winnings battery life and display is a joke
I’m on my first iPhone for 2 years now.  The most frustrating thing about the iPhone to me is that multitasking is limited to specific things.  Multitasking on Android is better
Mkbhd is like a sleepy guy and sounds like it too..! So i don't watch his videos cause i might fall asleep watching his sloth like movements and his sleepy voice over and over again..!😑😒
I can do everything with Android and restricted for many thing in iOS  That's define all the battle
I had beliefs about MB that he might be that apple fanboy, but so far by this video, he seems to be a highly rational person, who picks each concept objectively and has an overall understanding that what you want vs what other want may be too different things.
Did you know that apple gets 82% of their screen from samsung
thats pretty ridiculous. facetime as a pro for iphone? its video phone calls. theres a million apps to do video phone calls. and one moment, better cameras dont count because they might take better photos but youre used to the iphone workflow, and the next moment, its totally about the quality. but then, the display is ok even though its weaker than a comparable flagship and has a notch, but lets call it a draw anyway...and voice assistant (clear android win), lets just not count it at all.  ...uh huh.
I'd take my S22 ultra for picture taking, FWIW, because the zoom is just soooo good, and I use it pretty often.  That's kinda niche though, so I get it.  Also, Apple being eco-conscious is kind of laughable--I disagree, hard.  You didn't factor in the stupid port situation and all the adapters, the worse-than-average repairability, the cost of repair being so high people buy new phones, etc.  Meanwhile, Samsung's stuff has been getting a bit more repairable, in general, and they have fully-recyclable packaging.    That's the only category I thought you guys were wildly off on.  Apple led the charge on environmentally bad decisions by making everything proprietary, and practically encouraging people to buy a new device at the first sign of trouble.  They were the first to do away with replaceable batteries.  They patented new screws to make it harder for users to open up their computers.  FFS, they have driven literal tons of e-waste that didn't need to be a thing.  It's one of the reasons I don't buy their devices, even though they make good devices.
Mkbhd is such an apple shill
The only one I know here in Denmark using iphone is my wife ...she don't know all the settings you self can control in android...
Crazy but what mrboss said about Android being a toy with features makes sense. As I'm getting older I'm wanting not a toy now. Considering switching to Apple...
You didn't even scratch the surface, what about USB C, availability of chargers, serviceability etc. Android could win the "war" easily... Looks like a iPhone commercial to me...
Iphone sucks to get into and out, I don't know why will you be willing to go into a shitcosystem apple has when you can be flexible in your choices
wow 6 million hits
depends on what you prefer
I prefer the s22 ultra over the iPhone
Why would you every go with a pixel 5? its almost not supported anymore
I disagree with almost every score that was given. It seems like there's some agenda to promote apple here...IDK, just saying.
I did find this as personal preference. Charging on iphone is slower and the port is still not usbc. Iphone is pushing you to buy another instead of repair, so this is not sustainable. The camera on iphone is still bad in low light condition, in normal light looks very saturated the image. The iphone price is just crazy. I do believe that ios is more stable than android, but from all the other perspectives, it is not over android phones
You guys absolutely nailed it. Hope to see more videos of this duo, not just related to phones, but pretty much anything related to tech! Great video guys. Loved it!
Super unfair your just a fanboy of apple  you even said in a video so this is really unfair 💀
This is a must read please. I multitask alot so I will give Android a goal. Camera processing IOS a Goal. Ability to be able to push your phone to it lim I will give android. My Android can be used as anything but my ios put limitations because its not flexible . So I will give Android a goal . IOS's is not Bulky with make it phones need lesser ram and less battery. But Android is flexible and multitaskable so more ram and Battery is needed. Android task manager and file manager is top notch and that's where IOS limit your exploration This is a tie to me. To me it depends on the  User's utility . To me I love Android because I feel like I have a computer with me and IOS LIMITED MY ABILITY in using my brain.
I LOVE Marquez, but it seems like he took over the video and is iphone guy so their was no honesty here. Mr. whosethe boss was not giving his honest opinion, just being polite to him
4:50 moment i realize that this is time wasting
It's biased review
OneUI 5 is destroying ios 16 rn
Android is a hands down better user experience. Your take is completely wrong on every point.
Well android have T9 Dialing while iPhones don't have, and that is a feature that I use so much instead of searching for the name of the person
My Pixel has never not saved a photo I took. But I agree the pixels are buggy.
ANDROID is clearly a winner for me thanks to the AFFORDABLE PRICE (ENOUGH SAID) iam able to experience what smartphone actually is and i am grateful to that annnnd not everybody is rich.
These guys should videos together more often
Wow
Definition of an Iphone user:  *points at Android phone "This is technically, factually better."  *points at Iphone "But I like this because it's more expensive and I would never buy the same phone as some filthy peasants."
Two iphone fanboys talking about how great apple is
garbage
I don't like apple because of their fan Boyz "ew you're a green bubble" fk off it's apples own fault for locking it down
I use android due to it being able to sideload a YouTube ripper.
This video is summed up in 2 sentences: Mostly cringe, and gagging down Apple's balls.
C'mon guys how unbiased did you really think a comparison between a legit flagship Android phone and a high end iPhone would be by two iSheep "tech" reviewers ? I'm not at all surprised at their conclusion. I used to be subscribed to both these reviewers channels but this is the very reason i unsubbed from both to maintain genuine unbiased tech reviews.
Who is this boss. Like everytime choosing iOS. It's like he is the CEO of Apple or some spy for Apple. I hate this boss so much that he doesn't deserve to be boss he deserves to be a janitor. I HATE YOU  Janitor
This full video kinda felt like Arun was planning a video to roast or take is anger out on Apple but MKBHD flipped the table. Not defending any platforms
This guy clearly an iPhone guy. Let me break it to ya ... iPhone is for ages 21 and under and the Samsung is for 22 and up.
They look so tired
I am morally opposed to giving Apple money. Highest profit margin in the industry, yet they still produce their phones with more or less Chinese slaves. To the point where foxconn has suicide nets around the building because jumping out windows is so common. If they took a 5% decrease in profits they could pay these people a wage that does not make them suicidal. Then you factor in that the walled garden of Apple forces companies to pay to play, and you have things like a Netflix subscription that started on your iPhone is $7 more month than one you started off the platform. Apple is the epitome of the evil corporate business. Not that other major companies are not also bad, but apple is the worst. They intentionally make the iMessage experience painful when messaging Android phones. They do this just so that friend groups that are all iPhone with a couple Android phones peer pressure those people into buying iPhones. They can make the experience great but they don't, because they don't care about your experience they care about the bottom line and all their users can go to hell. Android is very open it makes an effort to provide a constantly good experience but they can't do anything about the restrictions that imessage places on non-apple platforms. If you and your friends and all your hardware is not Apple, then f*** you. Google the other hand is more than willing to work with other platforms.
this video is bought to you by Iphone.
Stoll using a year old phone? I'm still using my Note 10+ and am only upgrading because of no more security support in the next while. I just don't see anything on the new phones that make it worthwhile to upgrade for any other reason. If it wasn't for the lack of updates, I would continue to use the Note 10+.
You ask Marques as if he's not Apple biased, of course he is going to pick Apple. By the way, you completely ignored that AirDrop on iPhone has an equivalency in Nearby Share on Android. Same with Facetime in Google Meet. Same with iMessage and Messages. Unfair, biased conversation as always with Marques.
photography should go to android and video should stay iphone
I use split screen apps a lot. Especially when I'm referencing information between two apps
bhai yo kali gand aalo to hai chutiya aur android hai bhadiya
Carbon neutral by 2040. In 2040 there will be no phones I guarentee, thus making that a free claim
You licked android better so it is unfair
I think this very unfair... As features like imessage etc have replacements.. You just are used to it... But features on android phones like ir blaster, 100x zoom, fingerprint reader, fast charging etc cannot be replaced or be put with a software update... So I think both of you are really tired and just wanted to finish the video without thinking what features android have
Both phones are good at different things
I've been a android user always Samsung LG Motorola all high end devices i do like  IPhone  the battery life is really nice especially on the 13 pro max the funny thing is battery life really matters a lot to me i have the Samsung galaxy S22+ on the way to my mailbox! Great review guys thanks!
MKBHD is sponsored by Apple. He gets free iPhones every year just for spitting out these shameless plugs. Google Pixel is was better than iPhone at pictures. Video may go to iPhone but the Pixel 7 has closed the gap. Now, I know that MKBHD has been burned by Google and other Android devices in the past which makes sense as to why he'd make the switch, and generally the iPhone is probably the better phone overall but it also costs twice as much. You would have to take the best features from multiple Android devices to beat the iPhone and that's a shame that a company like Google or Sony or Samsung can't figure that out while keeping Android an open source platform.
Excellent video 👌🏾
You should do this again
Andriod always
Both of you know only about iphone and nothing anout Android
ios win but android own by Google ios screen own by samsung Literally ios is on the palm android😗 don't forget the Battery and type c cable
But can I ask because no one where I live (Northern Europe) uses iMessage. Is it really popular other places besides the US?
I think IOS is the better operating system.  But IPhones are so sodding expensive these’s days I can no longer justify buying one myself.
2 isheeps
Real hot take. Windows Phone was the best. I had best overall experience with them. If they had the software support and Microsoft didn't drop it so quickly, I would still be using them.
Add one more point, same features with best price. we all know which side will win that
Commening this before starting to watch the video,  "Apple will win with a greater margin"  How did i predict it? When 2 Apple fans do Apple vs Andrioid comparison, we can easily know which side will win
I like it to
Android is better
Eco consciousness was a load of bull.
I changed from Android to iOS basically because Android is so much better than iOS I couldn't put the Android phone down. iOS is goofy things just take longer to do. So you just wait until you can use a computer to do them.
I knew the answer before watiching because Marcus was there.
Just switched from an Android mid-to-low range phone (moto g9 play, released in 2020) to an iPhone X, a phone from 5 years ago. It was easier than expected for me to transition from one to another. Both phones are amazing and to be fair this is only my first iPhone (bought secondhand), as I wanted to give it a try. I believe I'll be staying in iOS because while it doesn't have the biggest specs (my moto had bigger ram capacity and higher megapixel count, to give two examples), the phone overall is so optimized I actually don't feel that I care. Plus I'll have more updates for a longer timeframe so it's better for my pocket too, as I'm on a budget, and it lasts for longer after reaching its final update: I have an iPad 4th gen that I can use with no issue, I don't have much apps on it but I only needed it for Procreate and Google Drive and it still works with older versions of the apps.
Eco conscious? Why is this a concern for ANYBODY? This segment is ridiculous.
Nearby share actually can match air drop on iphone I think, and I used it a lot
But you could get a bullet proof iphone
He’s a big iPhone fan boy guy on left
Android Lover😎✌️
Not sure what adult website my dude has been visiting that are effecting his phone. But I've not had even one of the issues this dude keeps proclaiming happen regularly.
It's odd to me how this works out. My wife has an iPhone 13 Pro Max and I had a Galaxy s10+ and I upgraded to the s22 Ultra this week. My workcl phone is also an iPhone. Everyone always talks about how much better than iPhone camera is, but I am consistently taking as good if not better pictures than the iPhone... But the iPhone camera is easier to use. More beginner friendly. However, video doesn't even compare. Like I can take good video, but I have to try. The iPhone takes good video effortlessly. Outside of video recording I would take my android in nearly every other category.
Rich people have used iPhone
wow all the bots commenting how great android is xD
Tried iphone 14 after 4 years since I last used an iphone, didn't like it at all. UI looks too much stacked and can't have 2 copies of same app.
I went from nokia android iphone then android after the iphone 6 and then to google and then now back to iphone 13 and I’m so sad I want to go back to android. Android is way superior.
i think it is better to just commper operating systems not the hardwere
Time and again you see the same error of logic when this debate comes up. You can't compare all the available features on every single phone the entire rest of the industry has combined to the single phone one company makes. You have to compare handset to handset, and no single Android handset matches the iPhone's all-round offering. It's like comparing Real Madrid's starting XI to every other player in the world. Benzema's great, but Mbappe is better. Kroos is great, but De Bruyne is better. Courtois is great, but Alisson is better. No team has Mbappe, De Bruyne and Alisson, just as no Android phone has the greens of Fairphone, the cameras of the S22, or the software support of the Pixel. That phone doesn't exist, so you're comparing a real iPhone to a fantasy Android. Perhaps this is a weakness of being a reviewer and fritting between handsets in a way no consumer does.
Android hands down. Not even worth comparison otherwise really
Did anyone notice Arun left Marques hanging with a fist bump at the very end of the video? 😆
It has to be Apple, by a long chalk. I can’t imagine having anything other-than an iPhone now.
I recently inherited a 6s from my uncle. He had upgraded to a bigger iphone and chucked this one in the drawer. When he passed away his daughters gave me this one. What a fantastic phone. Great camera, saves to cloud so doesn't have to use local memory. Just a way superior phone. There is no comparison to the Samsung junk which I was given. Samsung j3 fails after 2 hours although there is a new battery. Piece of crap. Software is iffy at best and hardware just is junk.
Android will always be the retarded little cousin of iPhone. It’s buggy the Ui looks terrible slow some phones only have 2.4hz WiFi 😂 iOS will always be better
For me Iphone apple are just too expensive. I am happy just to spend £99 for those who are obsessed techs go for a purchase £1000 iPhones or £64 a month for iPhone Pro 14. contacts.
I think the comment section passed the vibe check B)
I love collaboration. Very informative and helpful.
And the operating for iPhone all around does less
There's one iphone, there's hundreds of Androids offering tons of variety.
Gonna be completely honest, I just prefer the Samsung UI experience, and the ability to use SD cards over the iPhone
Just ditched my Samsung ultra 22 just cause. It kept powering off n on. And would get hot. Did it like 2 months after I got it then didn’t happen till here lately but started doing it more often.
iPhone is better, lesgo boysssss
A great video!!! Excellent work by these two wonderful gentleman. I love their excellent opinions on why iPhone or Android is better. I love my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra 512GB Smartphone.😊
simply video summary ..MKBHD loves iphone
Both android and ios are best in their own way. Also they have some drawbacks. For android wide range of models available in the market  but for ios, we need to buy apple mobiles. It's people's choice to decide which one is suitable to them.
I don't know why people say It doesn't have airdrop like IPhone when nearby share on Android works pretty good.
You haven’t mentioned one of the most major difference between the two, which is the web support. The web support on ios is horrible and it looks like right now apple is doing what ever they possibly can to block the web technologies.
I was a hardcore samsung note user but they are soooo expensive that I started to consider iphone. I switched because :  - i have a mac so it makes everything easier - being able to use imessage and ft really helps with networking in new york  - security features like icloud relay, hide my email and tracker blocking make me feel secure and in control of my data and browsing
I think they should do a samsung vs iphone , personally I don't agree with their choices on this video but they should come back for a better one
My most important as an audio enthusiast is a good DAC/Amp chip and headphone jack, luckily my S10 has both 😉
I love you're videos, but you are such an apple fanboy.
Definitely anybody willl buy iphone if u can have budget for s22 ultra. iphone is out of reach of any third world country, it costs 5 times more than what budget i have.and there's no cheaper option. Apple should start making mid range phones with old processors.
iPhone better🙂
charger and everything is foreign. iPhone was originally built and made in California, USA but they took another direction when Steve Jobs passed they wanted to stay on top they went lightning cable then android went type c. Do you see who followed who??? I remember the games and music you had to pay if you was apple. So people went cheap route and got androids. I’ve used both androids suck no matter if it’s made by top end manufacturers it always crashes loses shit. I’m back with American made things.
Google Assistant > Siri, and it’s not even close.
It would be nice to see the Google Pixel 6/7 Pro considered in this comparison
Android is BETTER
The only things I found on iOS phones that I think that's better than on Android are the software update support length and the lidar sensor
Currently, I have the Pixel 6 and iPhone 13. Android is superior to iOS by a completely gigantic long shot for sure. The iPhone is like complicated to use compared to Android phones, and I’ve had the G1 and iPhone 1st when they were out back in the day. Android had conquered iPhone. The only thing that I can say that iPhone does actually beat android in is for some reason, maybe the way the device is built, it’s always been way better with the network. Both are on the same service, but iPhone has a much stronger connection than Android and that’s one of the reasons why I keep the iPhone, because I know I can rely on the network staying in connection with iPhone and that’s kind of the whole point of having a phone. It’s always been like that. Anyone who’s experienced both on the same network can relate. I’ve used so many Android phones, and none have it nearly as good with network connection strength than iOS.
I love android forever. Especially this Asus Rog Phone 6.
Apple is better and dont coment or coment at my coment = reportttt
This hella biased lol
As a one plus 10t user I can tell you it’s better than my iPhone 13 in every way including having 120hz feeling infinitely more smooth and if I get hungry and want a sandwich and have 50% battery I’ll hit 100% by the time I’m done making it bcuz of the vooc 125w fast charging.
The only thing with android is that it can be SO confusing and convoluted with hidden features and stuff you didn't even know the phone can/could do..... Whereas with Apple, stuff just works 100% out of the box. And I own android phones and still say that.
Android is pure shit
Mine has a dynamic island …..lol this part aged quick
I started with ios and could never get used to android when I tried it. so, the device choice is irrelevant to me. now have a 13, clean and simple. bought it at apple store in cupertino right next to campus. always great service. And my ipad is so superior to samsung tabs. where are the android stores?
Had to turn off Siri when I met a girl name Siri. That's when I realized that I don't use it that much, plus anything you say can and will be used against you ;)
I think for screen Android should have been a clear winner. Picking up most expensive iphone and comparing it with all the Androids in general is not fair. Comparison should be with similarly priced androids not all the androids in general.
More on from the environment  crap
I bought  a I pad for performance  and I hate it , android  rules
This is why people mostly dont wanna watch reviews like this When you're doing such a huge review, you have to be precise, leaving out the personal likings and speak of technicality Like, the guy admits that trend android phones (let go of things like xperia pro i) take better pictures and then deciding that the point goes to iphone? Bcz of saving photos ?! I've never taken picture n seen that it hasn't saved it like wtf is that excuse  Things like this are the things that a viewer would just say, ok u're stupid n not even qualified to review No offense Matt i always love you n count on you as someone who speaks rly technical n truthful
This is actually pretty accurate, I love my S10 but Samsung really dropped the ball after it. Though the foldable is still going great ( hopefully with cheaper versions to drop next year).
Windows Mobile is the best. Unfortunately, unless it was innovative it would have been unlikely to unseat popular options. Right now, I think it may be time to replace Smart Phones with a different option. Whoever gets their first will be the winner.
I enjoyed the video but couldn't help but feel a bias towards Apple. Even in some categories, I agree apple is better, but in others I was surprised. I have both the 14 pro max and the pixel 7 pro
Android has more apps available on it, and can install APK files without needing to jailbreak it. iOS is like a console, while android is like a pc
I thing the samsung fridge won
I had an Iphone, great performance but it have a lot of restrictions, now with a Motorola I feel I have more freedom
FaceTime is just video chat. Duo does the same. Apple ecosystem is definitely top notch.I love the multitasking ability on android. The split screens is a must. My camera is flawless on my droid. I'm usually the one taking pictures because they look better than the iphone.   I do like the face unlock on iPhone.  Everything else seems gimmicky.
If i have to review this review i would say MKBHD is an Apple fan and the other guy is an Android fan. That's all to some it up.
But MKBHD award always goes to Android 😁 Isn't it ?
iPhone is more stable or is that just me and I own both
I really don't care about IPhone coz i can Quick share my files to my Samsung Laptop 360, it's brighter, i can take my notes anywhere, anytime, endless customization options.
Where is the SD card category?
9:50 So i can repair my phone change the battery and such?
Marques is on point. There are a lot of android phones that do a lot of things better then the iPhone. But when you’re choosing one package that offers the overall best experience, iPhone is just way ahead. And the things where it’s not ahead, the difference is very insignificant.
in my mind the iphone is better than samsung (android).
so bias vs normal human wh woins :O
iphone is iphone 👑androide is androide😇
Some body stole your profile giving stuff away with a shipping fee
android is better
FaceTime on iPhone = video call on Android Air drop on iPhone = quick share on Android   Iphone has nothing but blue messages 😴
having had both top end phones (private and work) i can't support nearly any point they made here. Samsung won in everything BUT in software design for me. Even the photo arguments here are like: its worse but i like it
Completely biased towards iPhone
why dont you say that you are sponsored by IPHONE LOL.
Freedome is the KEY of any Technology . Iphone is very overratted and special guest vibe .
What good is a phone to you, if you can't even afford it. For people who would rather buy a laptop with the money saved, iOS is out of the equation anyway.
Apple is for suckers
All the droid clowns so mad rn 🤣
Kinda a funny comparision. Samsung to Apple. Since Samsung makes a lot of the components for Apple. So to me your really comparing two phones that have the same components.  And like a few already said. Android is an OS not the hardware. And you both do seem skewed more toward apple no offense. So it seems to be an unfair comparison.
The other guy was just ALWAYS right. It was like MrWhoseTheBoss over here thought everything he was saying was gospel. This is all just the other guys opinion
I'd like to see this video made by people that aren't Apple evangelists.
The moment every Apple Fan must have smiled: 3:07
This is an apple paid ad
Now I’m really interested how iPhone 14 would change this 😂
I'd be an iphone user if they used usbc
Sponsored by Apple
eco conciousness, BIIIGGGG part of the user experience, and HUNDREDS of people care
Two Apple fans justify why they are Apple fans - the video
Me putting a rounded case on every phone I’ve ever phone anyway. I get why it comes up in phone reviews but I usually ignore it. Don’t like the sharp designs so much
MKBHD is iphone bias.....thats for sure😄😄 model diversity and usb-c is a huge win for Android. And the notch and bezels are still huge on iphone, price also suck....
iPhone till i dieeeee🤩🤩🤩🤩
Recently broke my android and I got a good deal on an iPhone and I have an urge to chunk this thing in a fish tank 5x a day. The one thing I love about iPhone is the health app. I'd have to have 10 android apps to do what the apple health app does. I will be flying back to Android asap downloading all the apps and fast charging.
Mutlitasking is much better in android. You can use split screen, pop-up windows, you can play a game and make a video call or make a drawing while waiting for your turn in a game. I used to be an iphone user but now I can never change back from android.
Unfair
He didn't fist bump him on the very end nooooooo 🙁
Please share where to get that wallpaper for S22 Ultra
Only thing going for iPhone is their optimized ecosystem and security. It's a closed source OS. Android wins with lots of freedom you get from a PC.
Nice To Meet You !!! Happy happy to see you Anytime good shows Anytime love you forever ♾ #@!
When it comes to photography, I would pick an android phone over Iphone. The videography is better on Iphones.
This argument is silly..   We all know iPhone is better.
The video was basically made by two iphone enthusiasts with no objectivity. In many of the sections they gave a tie when the android clearly won and it seemed very obvious to them if they dared to give it as the winner to the iphone. In user interface, connectivity (usb-c vs ​​lightning), file handling and versatility in customization layers, it is clearly the big android winner. iPhone may only be more convenient for those who use all of their electronic devices within the apple ecosystem, otherwise compatibility is almost non-existent.
The physical USB-C charging port fragility is an issue. Is the lightning cable & charging port as fragile? I have had to replace charging ports on more than one Samsung Galaxy.
They're all too expensive.
I'm looking for the sponsorship from Apple on this video 😅 disagreeing with a lot of what is said haha
guys look at the battery at 1:08 🤨
I feel like you guys were too easy on the iPhone, not having a standardized charging port should've been a negative for the iPhone in terms of being environmentally friendly. Android may not have FaceTime or iMessage, but has an alternative for pretty much everything the iPhone offers whereas you can't say the same about the opposite.
Team iPhone 💪
i am a Fan of MKBHD and so far his opinions are impartial but this video is completely PR because it's completely biased towards the iPhone even though in some aspects are better on android
5:44 in my opinion I think Samsung takes better photos than iPhone but that's just me though 🫠
Gorilla glass, usb-c, overall durability, favoring nonproprietary software, camera functionality. Paid you are. And I use the multifunction on my note 20 constantly. The S pen didn't talk about that...
Very biased review ..no ways ios won on most of these.
There is an attitude emitted in this video and it's totally biased towards iphone. Noticeable from the body language of the left guy. In my opinion this is a BS video.
iPhone is not worth its price. I would pay 1000 for 14 pro max. It's good phone but not 1350$ phone
So u are comparing android phones and Ios phones.. Not the OS. 😄
Sponsored by Apple, like usual! 👎
Where's the "most use of slave labor" category? IPhone LOVE its human rights violations.
Battery one was a joke. Right?
Android works better for me which is why I have an Android phone but being objective, the iPhone is better overall. Faster updates, better battery, better camera, better stability.
It seems like many times they were tied, but then they just gave it to the iPhone. I'm an android user, but I know Apple does some things better. I still feel like they just handed more to the iPhone because of a biased preference, not based on capability (yes we all have biases).
Pic on iPhone look trash compared to a Droid don't know what he was smoking jus a apple fan boy.
Android is way better! Iphone is more for the name now, its terrible, I can't use it...
Man MK has Started being so bias with Apple. Just like you were bias with Xiaomi.
Honestly, I think the iOS design is absolutely hideous. It has barely changed since its inception and it has always been ugly
Omg who ever says iPhone is better they don’t how beautiful android is …
mark ass brownie
is that a 14 pro max or am i tripping?
Personally I don’t see much difference between them other than the design and UI design
The s22 ultra is way better then the iphone 14 pro max i work for Verizon and me and my coworkers have tested which phones were better and the iphone video and picture quality  are not smooth at all  they are actually very sluggish and they freeze a lot especially the screen this sounds like this is a paid advertisement or iPhone
Was watching it again.. this is the first time i guess he didn’t use a fancy word for subscribing.
Giving the iphone the “win” in battery is a hard pill to swallow.
My 6 year old son don't wanna go to school because I gave him a half pant 🙂
Face time airdrop are just fancier versions of blue tooth and normal call i face time on my s7 and s6 and share play is a copy of playstation
The 2 most handsome men on youtube together!
more podcasts please with MKBHD
Giving point to iPhone for eco-friendly tells you a lot about that comparison
two guys try to advertise for Apple for free.
Once you have marcus on your show to talk about an apple device, you can never get a honest review. Period
Starts with saying iOS vs android first thing is the screen resolution bro do the operating system not the godamn hardware of a company that uses android
Yup. Choice yours.... Android 4 life!
As far as features most people actually use... The real debate between phones is Pixel Vs iPhone.
they apple buy parts from Samsung so we must not compere both
The issue with the vibration motor on the s22u is so true, I just have my phone faced down besides my hand and I won’t be able to feel the vibration of it🥹
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined    It feels really sad to be in minority, to people have no fun in their hearts , they all are so much restricted by iphone and still they keep up with it for no reason   Well rounded , stable are less rude way of saying flat and boring  Yeah no shit if you dont make phone ultra fast in terms of charging and software they would be stable but thats no fun have you never been flabbergasted by extreme charging speed of an android that you felt an immediate rush of joy or excitement like damn thats fast   cool customisation features of android feels like a cool friend who has always something new for you too try and boring apple is like your teacher rigid with their ways and no fun , might be little good but very not fancy
This was terrible, they gave customization to iphone,im done bruh
You started with display, which has nothing to do with Android vs iPhone, so I'm tempted to stop watching this video right then. Coz Android does NOT have a display, and it can't have one 😑 Seeing the title I thought this was going to be a comparison of the OSes. A more fitting title would be "Android phones vs iPhones".
No way they put Apple's photography over Androids 💀
Hey buddy apple sponsor video is out now
Mkbhd is like I'll not let Android to win
Both of these are making us feel dumb
You talk about the environment, but ignore WHO makes the phones? I'm talking the workers with nets around the top of their buildings...
Also the s22u doesn't have the SD Gen 1 + which is a game changer in the battery department.
I use multi windows all the time on my Fold 4.
Since Apple copies everything that Android does. The answer is Android.
This guy is comparing the S21 to the iphone 13 instead of the S22 ultra
iphone be like I can't do shit but I can win these battles though
I have both phones, Samsung S21 Ultra, iPhone 13 Pro Max.  I use the iPhone as a tool for my work ecosystem (Macbook Pro, Apple Watch. iPad Pro, AirPods Pro) Monday - Thursday and use my Ultra for fun (customization: launchers, icon packs, watching video in 1440p / 2K Resolution, insane camera zoom pictures, 8k video, Google Assistant, etc.) Friday - Sunday.  Very odd Marquez would pick an iPhone screen over say a Samsung.  To me watching video on a Note 10 Plus from 2019 with 3040x1440 quality is miles ahead of a brand new iPhone 14 Pro Max  2796x1290 with that annoying island in the way.  OnePlus 10 Pro screen has thick colors compared to iPhone.  To me most of this isn't so one sided.
2.5 to 7.5 is insanely biased
Can i get the song name at 13:10 ?
iphone is the phone for npcs
The title is misleading, it was iPhone 13 pro vs Samsung s22 ultra.
My mind said android over apple before I ever seen this video 😊😊team android forever
Sorry did Apple sponsor this? so many more things could have been added, also Sony should have had a few mentions. In My opinion too
Just got back to Android. And it’s like coming home lol
You're such apple fanboys, just give all the points to ios and say it's the best os ever
Iphone isn't an operating system yall need to stop comparing Android to an iPhone there's crappy android based phones if you wanna be true enthusiasts or tech reviewers,  say android vs ios , or samsung vs apple be forreal.
You did post this on my birthday
I own both , an iPhone 13 Max Pro and  a Pixel 6 Pro For me the goto phone and ease of use is the Pixel. I don't use iMessage, Airdrop or Facetime as most of the people I communicate with do not have an iPhone  The widgets etc again Pixel for me, but we all have differing preferences and use case
i do think android is much more simpler and useful than iphone
This man said his battery lasted 20 hours from a 8 hour flight🤯🤯🤯
I'm a hardcore Android user since the beginning but every1 I know use iPhone so I'm sure they're winning though that kind puzzle me.
7:52 that expressions speaks a lot 🤣🤣🤣
I am sorry, the first 2 mins and I hear something funny. The Iphone's screen 120Hz is the smoothest on any phone? Huh? I went to the shop and tested it myself, it's not smooth at all it feels like 75Hz or so!
this is the worst thing I have seen, I been watching our videos for year, but everyone know that iPhone really sucks at battery life. and most users complain a lot against iPhone's battery
It all goes down to preference Just buy what you like and go on with your life
So the only category Android won was price, cause there are cheap Android phones…? Why was this even a video? Apple is clearly ahead
Nag sama yung dalawang bias.
Iphone display and s22 ultra display got the same point??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣... S22 ultra has the best display... And camera... I think both are good... Multi tasking.... Especially with the pen is  another advantage of samsung...  Look... Display... Fast charging... Connectivity.. S pen... Performance
Samsung- super amoled dynamic x2 Apple- oled How can you even say the comparison is a tie😮‍💨
Sounded like an Apple-fan reviewing and voting here… 😊 I know about the slight Apple-bias from MKBHD always (though I like his reviews) but I expected a more balanced and dispassionate analysis here.
You can't understand an OS if you don't fully use it. It's like finding two Ford drivers arguing on a Chevrolet drivability, where they just got a one hour lift.
To all the watchers of this video, pay attention to the pretentiousness in the dialogue. There's a reason they're speaking in the way they do, in reference to truly trivial horse shit! Hint: $
EVERYONE knows that Apple is better!...............................................................if you're dumb enough to bite on stupid, useless and trivial buzz words and you're SUPER HUGE into FORCED CHILD SLAVE LABOR! But hair gel I guess. Plus Apple pays these "reviewers" more money that any single Android phone manufacturer! Why? Because Apple has to! If they didn't, and didn't put all of their garbage in Hollywood, no one would give two shits about the iPhruit!
Bro reliability point iPhone has 50 50…… coz when iPhone software support stops then we can’t install new apps within a year right???
IPhone is shit ishit
Android and sumsung or apple .....we all know who wins .... useless and incompetent reasoning...love you guys
Did apple pay for this video like I know u guys consider yourselves "pro" when It comes to the smart phone market but this was ridiculous
my top youtubers together!!!!
He's on apple balls 🤦🏿‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
What about the storage space? And also battery life after a few years?
iPhone has a smoother integration with its ecosystem and with other apple products. Apple products are also allergic to USB-C.   Whatever your priorities are, man. You give things their value, not the other way around.
Kind of see most apple wins are very vague and situational. My issue was coming from OnePlus insane charging to Pixel 6 pro. Loved the camera but honestly felt something was wrong with the slow charging and changed two pixels. Now trying Samsung again after s7.
Android users malding in comment section because they didn’t win
American accent Vs Bri,issh Accent 🫠
ıuguıguıgıu
USB-C >> Whatever Apple has.
Fingerprint Id >> Face Id.
man love your vids and thanks for all tech information that helps alot
Curious thing; both my kids are dropping their Apple and switching to Android. Why? Evidently long term performance and Apple's slowing over time.
This is paid promotion 💯 %😂😂😂
It's like   Hardworking student vs Talented student   Hardworking is apple and  Talented is android   Look how android took customisation for granted and now apple has done it better  Yeah , that's the point
I'm not a tech geek or anything, but to me the video feels biased towards iPhone/iOS.  There were many times when to me Android was the clear winner but then the iOS still won somehow.
MKBHD is being too honest in this video, lol.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's nice 👍✅😊
This is a comparison btw a Samsung phone and iPhone. "Android phone" is made up of many brands....  Rather compare android phone and iOS phone
Alternative title: 20min of Marquees cocksucking apple and Arun saying yes
I think this guys is know smartphone betterthan me but unfortunately not how can this guy doing this video like this I think this video imade by Apple period
Both guys are more into Apple than into Android. I guess Lew (from unbox therapy)  should have alse been in this video. It would have been very much interesting then !
what's with the background music 🦖👁️👄👁️
The video is completely one-sided it's very apparent that the one that is giving the critiques is 100 supporter of iPhone this was not a fair assessment. am I humble opinion Android is the best operating system and does not limit you like an iPhone does. I pretty much disagree with every comment about the Android versus the iPhone in this video I wish we had both unbiased opinions, or at least have an expert on iPhone versus an expert on Android. this video is completely iPhone propaganda
honestly, if this was going by actual phone stats rather than OS, android would win by a landslide, but honestly, android isn't a very good operating system in general.
Samsung Windows link the USB-C alone could destroy iPhone. You can't even put a different clock widget on your iPhone cuz it doesn't exist. You guys didn't make a fair comparison I wish I didn't watch this video man really burned out and lost all respect for Marques in his channel he was talking about how Samsung was the best phone but here he was today different. Just pure disappointment.
I just wish that Iphone had better integration with Android and other technologies. They seem like their end goal is to be a monopoly like Disney, and when it comes to tech it ruins things for everyone when you're greedy in that way. For example, take a look at the internet, things would be so much more complicated if everyone didn't decide to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript mainly for websites. I mean file transfers are a nightmare from iPhone to PC, unless you have a Mac or download ITunes. Technology shouldn't be made with the idea that it solely belongs to one company, and that's what Android is. Android is an open source operating system that you can download on any device and thats brought us so many good things. Quality budget phones for $200, extreme diversity with phones, and a learning environment for people who also want to help in the technological world. IPhone would never support that because all they really care about is money.  I doubt anyone reads all of this especially with how late this comment is to the video. But just to be clear, Apple is good at making phones. But Apple is a brand, Android is an operating system, you can't compare the two. It's like comparing apples to oranges (no pun intended). I hope they remake this video but instead Ios vs Android, because that's really the comparison that there is to make. If it's was actual phone brands, this video should have been Samsung vs Apple, or Google vs Apple, but Android vs Apple is such a weird angle to view it from.
The eco question made me laugh. You’d need a phone without lithium in them to be eco friendly. Apple might be carbon neutral by 2030 but their suppliers won’t be…..
Android fanboys are mad about this one
its obvious you both apple fan
Apple is just better, like, idk there is so much they can improve but, they manage to do the products in such a way that is just better
2.5 Vs 7.5 final score..... I feel like Android missed so many points it deserved. The fact that you can easily change your OS to a lighter weight OS (like you can install Linux, not recommending it but you can) or a new skin of Android on most androids can add to its longevity which should help out it's eco score cause if you can keep your phone for longer and still use it, you're actually gonna contribute less to E-Waste. If you are just going off of the figure that Apple says about 20% of each iPhone is recycled. I understand why you would put it down to that baseline as it's an easy figure but it's not just something that can be easily measured overall and should have been a bit more in depth on. Not to mention the features. It's all about perspective sure but is iMessage or all of those iPhone apps a necessity? Like Android has so many different little features that Apple just doesn't. I personally hate having a notch on my phone, especially because I like watching videos on my phone and feel like it gets in the way, and I don't really take selfies that often so my camera pops out of my phone. Not to mention there are probably android versions of iMessage that although not as good get the job done. So I don't see how android lost the features round either.
We were waiting to board the plane sometimes takes hours and i spent the time playing n64 games on my Samsung phone Zelda ocarina of time to be exact.  And my cousin kept wanted to play I'm like dude just download an emulator and you can play every game system out there for free. He looked so sad and said iphone doesn't let him i felt so bad for him but i didn't let him play lol
Battery for Apple? I disagree in any way.
There's definitely some bias here towards Apple. For the first comparison you were comparing all of Androids and then for the eco consciousness you compared the flagships. And when it came to the cameras, Mrwhosetheboss said he would have went with an Android, but still iOS got the point.
Problem with those pillars is that you can generally only use them with folks with ios devices......so how useful are they?
iPhone batteries suck compared to Androids, tell me how my Samsung A20 lasts x2 as long compared to my iPhone 12…
I personally think your choice depends which eco system you are married too
I think the biggest flaw to all these comparisons are that "Android" is an open source system anyone can use so you will find a huge amount of brands with it. But iOS is only for iPhone. And in an attempt to compare iOS with Android the comparison end up either including less good android phones that tips the scale to iOS' , or a comparison between a variant of Android vs iOS instead of stock android.  I am aware that it's hard to avoid that in some cases, but this review seems way too biased. To me as a developer a good software isn't only how well it runs without crashing. but how easy it is to maintain and handle errors. And in that Android is simply leagues ahead of iPhone.   iPhone is reliable you say? But ofc, they don't have to handle any edge cases since they control everything in their own brand. Android however has to work on everything and on a magnitude og devices
Micro-sd storage Headphone socket Usb-C Specialised phones Competition Modding Not a closed software eco system Customisation S22ultra does beat or at least match beat the iphone 13 pro in photo quality, especially zoom..  The iPhone IS a wonderful and great phone.  But not scoring in favour of android on those points ^ is fairly unreasonable.   I don't know why, but the bias actually repels me from wanting to buy an iPhone.   It came across as an advert.  Disappointed with this. I normally enjoy your videos.
Overall s22 ultra budget by fit hai but iPhone agar bahar lekar gye aur kisika call aaya toh sabki nazar aap par hogi.....mtlab iphone ko koon nhi janta brandwise IPHONE hai.......and other side agar samsung par call aayega toh koi utna dhyaan nhi deta but jab aap baat karte ho toh log sochte hai ki koon sa phone hai....mtlab utna jada koi nhi janega ki s22 ultra hai....aur Samsung k bhaut sare phone similar hote toh wo bhi ek problem hai
This is the big question to ask, which one is the least likely to blow up on you?
That Guest you got judging is a Bias peice of sheet. His input and arguments for his decisions in each category are full of complete nonsense which are obviously coming from a bias stand point ultimately makes video server irrelevant and useless for anyone wanting a view point from a logical   non bias standpoint. New Users & even your average user that is unaware of they're devices capabilities and performances who is seeking knowledge Smartphone & Tech reviews are going to be steered in the wrong direction because that guy loves iPhones...probably so much that he'd suck u off for 5mins of screen time on any apple product. Lol
This was really confusing. MKBHD has been using the S 22 pro for the past year, but rated the iPhone higher  in almost everything yet he’s wearing an Apple Watch.
I go, samsung phone cheaper dors the relative same stuff   Somebody please prove me wrong I just watch videos and sometimes take pics
Sounds biased
I always smell the apple fan boy inside mkbhd ... And its clearly visible here
iPhone wins for stability of OS and APPs Android wins for hardware starting with battery and the ease of modification to the screen and the GUI to suit your needs.
Can we just apreciate that the editor put a dent in the word dent 1:49
Focusing on flagship can be misleading, esp when all iPhones are really flagships.  The thing with Android is that you can get a really great mid-tier phone for like half price.  So if you really don't want to drop a grand on a phone, there are no iphones. And honestly, I don't care if my photos and videos aren't the very best on a phone. Actual cameras are better anyway.  I got a new old model Samsung a71 for free, and its fine. The screen is perfect, and maybe its not as smooth, but I don't really care.  With phones too many people think "nothing but the best" when ultimately it doesn't really matter.
Bakwas comparison.  Android is the best 💪🏻
🍎🍏📱⌚️🖥💻⌨️🖱🎧📲
God i start questioning my own sexuality Anytime arun talks 😭
I think comparatively easy and cheap repairability across-the-board for Androids is a big win..
I don’t care at all because I am biased to apple
Iphone is better for work and android for everyday usage. Ive ended up using permanently two phones. An example? Emulators. Cant live without them.
I use both Android and iOS phones because of my job. My daily driver is Android. I find the iOS very limited and restricted compared to my Samsung Galaxy. Both systems are good now days. About photo and videos. Again you get much much better results from the Android if you use the "Camera" app on the phone, but iOS has the same good quality camera if you take pictures in all apps. As for the Androids, they take litteraly shit pictures and videos from SnapChat, Instagram and other non-camera apps. So if you want to take pictures on those apps, you better use the stock Android camera app and then import into the app whenever possible. Or just get an iPhone :P
Wow Marques lost all his reviewing credibility with his clear iPhone bias and fanboyism
Highly baised opinion. Battery and camera is better in Samsung s22 ultra
Nice and honest review, guys. I hope you could work together sometimes.
this is straight up bullshit no need to sub why is Arun just following what MKBHD says and not giving his own opinion
iPhone is better bra lol the ecosystem is better the asthetics are better looks more neat shit ain’t even close
Apk aps. You can't download modded apps to iphone. I been using an ad free version of Pandora for years now. And whenever I like a song, it gives me the option to download it directly to my phone's music library
Great video but I still pick iPhone because of privacy and theft protection love this feature because I lost my iPhone and was able to track it even when battery 🪫 died fell out my pocket jogging didn’t notice till I got home gave me a gps location of my iPhone and lost mode is amazing even if someone found it couldn’t use it without my password and Apple ID.
Around 2020 - 2021 I decided that I wanted a 5G phone, so I did my research and bought a Sony Xperia 10 iii.  In particular, for the money, the cameras seemed to be a bargain.  I do not play games so processing is not important.  Radio-wise, I could not find a good information source.  If I were buying new today, I think that under $1,000 US (about twice the price of my 10 iii) I might buy the Xperia 5 iv, but realistically, today, the used market has 5G upper priced phones at around $500 US (maybe less), so I would probably end up with a used Samsung or Apple.
In my opinion Apple is easier to use but it's like comparing a plane to a helicopter, they're similar but have differences 
Flossy Carter  is the only youtuber not sucking up to apple???
the backsides of both of these (thumbnail)   look just UGLY 🥴
For me Android wins
If you dislike this video then they would say it's their opinion which you can't accept...i.e. there's problem with you, not with them... But when you buy a phone based on their recommendation, you're called "informed"! Clearly, they are getting paid by Apple !
iPhone can never match the looks of the Android... And more than 90% users don't care about the nuances that Marques was talking about... For them, it's larger than life photos that means exaggeration!
The winner just depends on what UI you like better
Recycled... Just a thought... If it's recycled shouldn't we get iphone in a lesser value? And if they enhance the recycled materials isn't that the same? Changes and chemicals are used... Still not eco friendly... Just my random thought.
Good video, but one category I believe you guys missed out on diving into specifically between the iPhone and the Android is the overall "User Interface." ...I recently switched to the iPhone (kinda giving it a try do to it's huge popularity, after using and being comfortable with the Galaxy Android for a while now). But that the user interface is where I noticed the biggest drawbacks and/or advantages between each phone.    For example, with the keyboard on the iPhone, there are extra steps I have to do when entering in symbols when typing that you don't have to do on android, just by pressing and holding to input symbols. Also, on the Android, there is a "central back button" on the android that also works within all apps, to go backwards on a page within and app or the phone; but on the iPhone, there is no central back button, so for "every app," there is a different way to go backwards on a page within an individual app. So many times on the iPhone, I find myself trying to figure out how to go just one page backwards from the current page I am currently viewing within the app. Every app handles going backwards on a page within the app differently on iPhone since there is no centralized back button, like there is on iPhone.  Now granted, Apple, with it's first iPhone, was the first and originator of the Real - what we now call smartphone - phone that really kicked off this smart phone area into the modern area, so in a sense, everyone is copying them, but you also never want someone to copy you, and then pass you up. To show I'm fare as possible, for my personal computer, I have been using Macs and Mac OS since 2010, and it is Sept 2022 as of the time of this writing, so over a decade. And of course, on top of being a mac user, I was also an iPod user for many years before most people new the next innovation of the iPhone was gonna come out and be a global hit.  Things I love about the iPhone, as a first time iPhone user is the Face-time feature. Although you can do this now with other apps such as calling someone through Facebook Messenger, although I love I love you can do this through a phone number and not a social media contact. Also, I used to wish I can easily copy text from my phone and then paste to my computer, with recent iPhone updates, I can easily just hit copy to a text from my iphone that i am working on or came accorss, and then go to my Macbook and hit paste, and vice versa. So (what may seem like) little like that makes a huge difference. Also, I REALLY REALLY LOVE and adore the fast charging feature on the iPhone, where my battery can be almost completely empty, and then within 5 or 10 mins, I have a significant charge to get whatever urgent task done needs to get done (If using the proper cables and plug for fast charging of course). This feature alone has come in very handy numerous of times when I forgot to charge my phone and had to leave out the house soon, and only had a short few minutes to put a charge on my phone to get the job done.  So like I said, just the overall user interface is the biggest difference I have noticed between the 2 systems so far and what has made the biggest difference so far on what makes me prefer one system over the other. I would love to see a future video that you, or both you guys do where you add a category focusing mainly on the overall user interface.
Basically Android is better but Apple has better marketing.
Did you mention how free you are usinh an android and apple are so restrictive in using lot of apps and features.
The thing is all these guys have both phones and go back and forth with them.  I’d have both if I could also.  I have the 13 pro max but so tempted to switch to S22 ultra or Z fold 4 just for fun.  I wonder if I would regret it though because my battery can last 2 days.
Congratulations you have sold your soul to Tim Cook
I haven't watched even 15 seconds of the video yet but I already know it's gonna be a massive waste of time as they're both gonna say   "WeLLllLllLlllLLLlL wE CaN'T rEaLLy SaY wHicH oNe WiNs bEcaUse iT cOmeS dOwN To a PeRsoN's pErSoNal PrEferEnCe... DURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR..."   Skipped to the end of the video and surprise surprise that's what happened. Don't waste your time watching this garbage, folks.
INFO: This video currently has 35K dislikes.
In one line : Samsung is better than Trash overpriced apple.  If you want value for money go for samsung it gives you extra for the less price  If you want to show your value and money then go for iphone. Because it will give you richness in society and standard. Although you will feel inner pain that you got robbed while using this trash but society will see you a happy and rich person.  That's it. I was a Samsung person and will remain.
This video looks like a paid advertisement for iPhone
I’ve been a Samsung user for almost a decade now and I’ve recently swapped over to iOS. I agree with a lot of this here except for the following: Camera processing on Samsung just simply looks better Samung has way more features when it comes to apps such as a oxymeter while Apple feel bare bones in every things it does.  Android has way more apps in general  And that’s about it. I agree with everything else that was said here
I repair my own phone, I use so many apps which aren't available on iPhone and I don't want to be part of any ecosystem trap for those reasons, I'll go with Android. Btw writing this comment with 4 years old Samsung Galaxy Note 9, didn't gave me any problem whatsoever, Loving it.
You stole at LEAST 2 points from Android, and Arun would've voted Android for like 2 others but went with MKBHD both times
S22 ultra is just so much better camera phone than iphone 13 pro max, in selfie camera in portrait selfie camera in space zoom in color dynamics everything about photos looks better on s22 ultra
One less follower Apple Fan boys not allowed.
Honestly in general I still think Samsung phones are surperior, I would go back if they had an ecosystem like Apple, with their cloud connectivity and near seem less integration which is the reason I switched over to Apple for now
Both are iphone fan boys. What's the point in making a video
Not a fair fight. One judge is clearly biased against Android. The final score is not honestly true.  This video felt like asking a Mets fan if the Yankees are better. Ask a Messi fan if Ronaldo is better than Messi. Guess what he's gonna say. 😂
It depends on how you use them. Apple ecosystem is very perfect. It’s only meant for Apple. All the apps, iOS, etc are only meant for iPhone so the apps runs way more smoothly, efficiency and simpler. Doesn’t let you customize a lot but a very secure and well protected agains viruses and other spams!  Android in the other hand has to make apps for all the phones with different companies, sizes of the screen, graphics, etc. so the apps differs from smart phones to another.  They don’t run as smooth as Apple but only one thing is that they can be customized and are less restrictive but that can invites lots of virus and other harmful spam which will eventually spoil for phone.
its crazy how the iphone can go against all these different android phones and still dominate
I have seen until photography and It seems biased towards iPhone. It was very obvious.
They should do this again with the new Iphone 14
For me, it comes down to aesthetics. I just hate the look of android phones and android os. They don't look close to as minimal as iPhones do to me.
I have the Samsung S21 Ultra 5G
Android rulez.. period!!!!!
Paid promo
Lmao oppo find X5 pro is way better than an iPhone 13 pro pics and videos but obviously they didn't put it
one really important thing you could have considered about the OS stability is that over the years the iphone software stays consistently stable, the existing bugs get fixed fairly quickly, but after a few years all my previous android flagships started to have more and more bugs with each software update, they were almost never fixed.
Turned this off after 7 minutes... The guy on the left might as well be Steve Jobs, FFS! There's 7 minutes of my life I won't get back... 🤦🏾‍♂️
Biased review 🤣🤣🤣🤣
android is better
Hate this channel so annoying. You can't be doing who is better when your favorite pone brand is IPhone
This comparison seemed very one-sided in Apple's favor. 🤔
I can't believe you guys don't use split screen its so good and useful
I would love to see this video remade with the new iPhone 14 pro models!
Just how apple oriented are you man.  so respect and +1 to Mkbhd for impartiality :)
This is a paid comparison in favor of Apple iPhone.
That look 8:47
I feel like the hugest win for android is the usb-c, when I was in grade school I had lost the charger to my school laptop and knowing that my laptop used usb-c was a lifesaver
It's funny that most of the iphone parts are made my Android companies.
They are obviously biased to iphone.
I have the feeling that this is pretty biased towards iphone
it's easy judge an android as a shit when u don't use it
Now that the 14 is out u should do this again
Iphone is history....  Android  and ...other ....
two iPhone lovers discussing this is LAUGHABLE.
The black guy is obviously biased
The fact that you have zero control over the iPhone's file system makes it total garbage. I can import or export any files for my Android and basically use it as a hard drive. Apple is trash
I like both of them. But when I hear first comparision between displays, I have no questions. Sorry guys, as engineer I cannot agree with you at all.
I dont care, i still remember using a samsung tab as a kid, it was so cheap but had so many good memories, im gonna go ahead and buy used samsung flagships for couple years
We are on the same page iPhone is not the  winner 🤣🤣. Sorry my Samsung 10, but i need a iPhone.
First of all ..... Android is a Software, Iphone is a hardware. There is simply no comparison to even start with. Ios vs Android would had been right.  Or Samsung/Google/Oneplus/Xiaomi/Nothing vs iPhone.
Mate, you forgot to mention that this vid is monetized by Apple 🤣 Objectively, clear bias on several subjects
This vid is a joke... Giving win to iPhone on taking pictures 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nah bro you're scoring this all wrong. You seem to score android based on an average of all android phones, which is ridiculous. For example, with eco consciousness, you said Nokia and Fairphone are better than apple, but you gave the point to Apple any way? Dumb.
So much crap, we all know that guy is a Apple fan, I unsubscribe his channel lot of time ago, and some friends I have that uses IPHONE  agree with what I'm saying
It seems these 2 or doing everything they can to make excuses for apple
You have to turn a number of settings off to maximize your battery life on your samsung.  Ive been using my samsung nonstop since 5am today, its 3:15pm now and i still have 55%.  Also, there has to be a stop to the android vs apple and stick to flagship samsung vs flagship apple.  S22 Ultra is far superior to the iphone 14 max
Genshin on phone rip
android (OS) vs iPhone (Phone)... apples and oranges...
MKBHD is so true when talking about the vibration motor on s22 ultra, even I have observed this and miss calls in that.
Biased opinions
My $250 Android phone has better battery backup than these two phones....
KMFT THESE OPINIONS SEEM SO BIAS BUT ITS PPLS OPINION
Can someone please tell me if this is sponsored by apple cus if it is Their marketing team is INSANELY GOOD
Tesco Value Samsung vs Samsung... which is best?!
If Apple cared about the environment wouldn't they want to stop using a proprietary standard on their most popular product and save  countless tonnes of e-waste every year?
One thing android is such a big platform it's not centralized like iphone who makes their software and their hardware so I never really compare them
mkbhd feels like he is apple fan
what can I tell? I own S22 Ultra and bought the same for my wife. I use 10x zoom A LOT, even shooting video, not only for photos. So that's not a "gimmick" that's a very useful and cool feature, for example in case if you didn't have enough time to open camera in some particular mode, but object is moving away (like, any object - plane, bird, car, ship, somebody... Doesn't matter at all). And if you have that ability, and found good use of it - your shooting experience won't be the same just from day one. Second killer feature is DeX. For me DeX replaced my laptop. Only one thing that Android won't be able to do (and there are workarounds) - building home lab in virtualized environment. But, obviously, if you can ssh/rdp to your server working somewhere else (in the closet?) - no problem at all. Who could provide same experience as DeX? Partially - Sony. Maybe Motorola. And... That's it? ) And from that perspective - IOS is years past Android. Real multi-app operating system with 2-3-4 apps running simultaneously (in separate windows), even games - no problem, tested.  But I do understand that all these features (+stylus) are productivity features. Sure, iPhone could be better suited for content consumption (some "simple" content, you can't use multi-screen functionality to learn something on one part of screen, and make notes on another). But if you do understand that all that "consumption" isn't something useful and helpful - you need something more expandable (by external I/O like kvm, audio input/output) and flexible for wider use case range.
There are a couple of things on Android I don't think I could give up. USB-C and Tasker. I refuse to switch to iPhone until it at least has USB-C. I don't want to have to buy 3-4 new cables dedicated to only one device.
Thank you so much bro. Sending virtual hugs ❤. Worked like a charm ;-)
Man u made my day, works for me
Hey man, It works great and without any problems.
Your personal opinion on the iPhone and the android phone does not way into the facts.  The lack of hardware on iphones are ridiculous There are always at least 5 years behind on technology from the android phones.
As someone who had the best Androids and the best Iphones i can say that Iphones are way better! Its my opinion but ofcourse you can buy whatever you want, its your money afterall.
For all those people who prefer iOS,it's quite difficult for Google drive to get to work on iphone and sync it just sucks, they only want you to use apple drive with 5 gb 🤷🏻‍♂️
Android won just a single category, the gap isn't that big because of draws but when you think about it gets sad for androids
For me it all comes down to a few key features and must-haves, the most important one being support for the user to expand the internal storage with a microSD card. Any phone that doesn't have this isn't even on my list of phones under consideration. #2, it has to have a 3.5mm audio jack. #4, a user replaceable battery (I'm not sure if ANY new model phones have this anymore, sadly). #5, Micro-USB-C charging port, so that if I need to buy a replacement for a lost or damaged charging cord, they're widely available. I also prefer the phone to be capable of "user recovery" in the event that it becomes stuck in a boot loop somehow; this means, the user should be able to flash the original operating system back into the system partitions at home if the phone gets bricked. All of the above mostly is the territory of Android phones, of course. With some Android phones, after you Root the phone, you can change the OS completely, if you don't like the OEM firmware, and get rid of all the bloatware that came with it from the manufacturer, and that's not even a remote dream for I-phones.
Im not gonna lie, I love iPhones and will always choose them because they got me hooked ever since I was a kid. Usually kids grow into adulthood carrying on brand loyalty so they definitely got my loyalty. I also just love the Apple ecosystem so much and can't see myself switching to an android where it's an entirely different world and community. I will forever be what people call an "apple sheep" 😂
I love all the new features with the 14! I have an unboxing of my white iPhone 13 pro max over on my channel... I'll most likely upgrade next year and go with the black iPhone 😏
why phone is almost 2 years old finally getting a new upgrade
How much did apple pay for this commercial?
Fully biased
Why sony not included in camera section? Just to hype iphone?
This comes off as biased and one sided.
Why absolutely agree that Google smart assistant wins....and no android points?  Also, hackable is an absolute win fir android! Are you nuts?  That's why there is so much choice for Android! Sure people don't have to have so much, but every Android phone on the market was hacked by the companies that built them!  And iPhone doesn't have a single pillar app that doesn't have an analog in android!
There will never be a clear and simple answer to which is better and honestly it's better that way.
been switching since 2016. i like them both for specific reasons. i'm on ios right now, but come december im gonna get me that pixel 7 pro. love ya, stay safe!
Man their collab is just amazing
Also, a big category you guys didn't mention is repair ability. With apple they are a lot like tesla, they don't want you messing around with their "proprietary" hardware. Also cost of repair ability is wayy off. The back glass on an iPhone is absolutely insane let alone the front glass. They literally make it to where it almost always makes more sense to get a new phone. Android is not that way. I'll always hate Apple just because the fact they refused to unlock a freaking terrorists phone for the government! Like wtf is that?!? Regardless of the phone or other products, Apple is a greedy, shady, and over all, a crappy company and I refuse to support them.
The display is irrelevant/biased because Samsung makes the display for iPhone 🤣🤣
I love these videos where both legends come together!
All the mad android fanboys in the comment section is hilarious. They aren't being paid off by Apple lmfao
Watched the video on my black S21 Ultra as MKBHD's!
iPhone vs Android is like comparing C with Java😂😂
guys are advertising Apple i'm 10000% sure 😂😭
its depend. if you want pay. it depend if you want apple or google track you
You both did an awesome job selling iPhones. I truly hope Apple rewards both of you handsomely...
Video somewhat biased tho but good collab
One thing that was missing in the vid was "accessibility" like blind users or a handicaps who have shaky/ missing fingers hand using the phone. Personally I use iPhone and haven't used an andriod in a very long time but as a worker in a phone shop I have noticed that majority of the phone that's the handicap people have is an iPhone
My thing with iPhones is that at least here in Brazil they HAVE to be the absolute best because they're so goddamn expensive. I mean, I'm a software engineer and I make more money than 90% of the people I know, even other software engineers, but an iPhone 14 costs more than my salary.
Biased review where arguments are based on personal preference so its irrelevant. "I prefer this more" cant be an argument it can be an opinion so your opinion is that iPhone is better.
I gues this vudeo more on iphone
Apple sucks & Android is way better, waiting for samsung to bring their own os
Ladies and gentleman I want to remind you one thing that is KBHD is a I phone promoter soo rest you guys know thank you ❤️
Eco-Conscious?  Dude, that's marketing and PR.  Eg. Apple cheaps out by releasing a new phone with faster charging capabilities, but doesn't include the charger.  The real reason is they want to sell it to you separately for $50.  The marketing claims its to "save the oceans"... because we all have older chargers?  Like we are gonna just take our old chargers, find the nearest ocean and throw them in?  But if we want the faster charging, we are gonna get one anyway, but if we PAY for the new charger, then we won't throw the old ones in the ocean?   It's a dumb argument, catering to the uneducated, screwing us out of more money to increase their profits, while their marketing team convinces us that it is somehow to our benefit?  Apple is brilliant in that regard, I will give them that.  They give you less, while charging you more, and convince us that we are somehow better off for it.  lol
I'm surprised the most important part about value was left out, iPhones second hand market kills Android phones. People are willing to pay much higher markup for a good condition Iphone 13 Pro in the future than S21 Ultra
Me who use both samsung and apple as daily driver 💀
Imagine they give you usb-c on iPhone 15, but still usb 2.0 and slow charging speed.  And make usb 3.0 and fast charging exclusive to iPhone 15 ultra pro max plus.
S22 ultra  is the best.
They didn't even mention android auto and carplay?
This argument is invalid, all Android phones are way ahead of iPhone, didn't know marques is an apple fanboi  😒
Bik gai gormint
This all is one man's opinion. Makes it clickbait in my opinion.
I need the S-Pen after using it for so many years. It's an absolute must for me
@mrwhosetheboss you are not the boss.  fells more like mr whose the "chamcha".  Bro wtf is this video
So look, guys. I love of both of your content and i think you both are amazing people, but just this time, this video felt very unsatisfactory to me. This wasn't a good comparison, because it felt biased. It's alright if you both like apple more, but try to keep your opinions to an extent, not just let them completely influence the decisions. That all.
I want to know,  how much apple paid both of you for this video ?
I Think MKBHD is Completely Sold to Apple.
I find it strange that everytime when it's just a small advantage for iPhone you give it to iPhone. When it's mall advantage for Android, you give it to both...
Lol you aren’t a gamer if you play mobile games
If someone is worried about environment  they don't really need to buy a refurbished or a used phone but can buy a new phone and can use it for long time. I had bought an iPhone 6 in 2014 and still using it in 2022 and mind that this is my only computer Well compromise had to be done with battery that's the reason I carry a power bank while travelling otherwise you can just chance the battery as new. But definitely would like to upgrade to a new phone just because some apps needs IOS 13 or above to work but I'm stuck with IOS 12.5. Well for the budget and for ENVIROMENT I can squeeze some extra days and transfer this phone with light use need and I am assured they can squeeze an extra 4-5 years.
Biased score 😅
IOS sucks though.
Hello hello guys... Features like starting from vibrate when call answered, battery percentage, haptics on touch and to pause video to touch on screen anywhere etc (even in 3rd party app).. dnt u think minimal essential features that iph hvnt given. I hate any phone even it's made of gold that dnt hv minimum needy features
I think Apple got highly overrated in this video
Biased video.
Every time Apple wins in such comparisons I always hear “well it is objective to the buyer in the end” what? No? Apple makes such great products due to their ability to make both hardware and software. Prove me wrong!
iShit will never be better than top android phones and top android isn't Samsung.
I disagree on the environment one. Apple pushes for so many cables / dongles etc, just for the phone it loses out. Android is usb c like everything else, u can use one cable for everything. Think of all the extra cables that will go to landfill from apple.
Betting the iPhone fan will choose the iPhone.. So a useless video really
other then the stupid eco part great vid
Très objectif de la part de quelqu'un qui porte une Apple watch ... Il y a plein de facteurs qui ont été oubliés (batterie : Xiaomi, photo: Xiaomi, screen: samsung, Xiaomi, oppo ...)
It is totally biased .... discussion   Why IPhone and Android .... you should say IPhone and Samsung.....You have to compare in relation to price....   Is it really value for money?  IOS and Apple are greedy people, they keep everything closed, lock you in jail.... IBM was like apple and lost the market, because Intelligent people was making decisions, in regards to Phones common people are influenced by advertisement ...  Android is making money for lots of companies and lots of people... you people are measuring nano-second performance.... which is not noticeable by common user of phones.... If you want a professional camera ... just buy it why measure phone...   Apple contribution is introduction of touch phone.... that's it... nothing special after that....
Android is best an easier ,
Lol any feature that's better in the Android is considered as a tie. MKBHD is a clearcut iPhone fan boy. What would you expect from him
yooo iPhone wins android sucks
“In the android world you have choice.” I want an android that is an iphone.
It's curious you compare them as Android vs iPhone instead Android vs iOS. Gives the impression that you see iPhone as the whole experience and Android as just a software. But not iOS as a limited software and (input brand with Android) as an experience.
people in the comment sections complaining about them being biased in the video and how they could have come to a Dra on several occasions, why do you want them to think for you? regardless of the outcome they presented the facts, watch the video and form your own thoughts and opinions, don't expect to be spoon-fed opinions.
Apple is literally the worst company when it comes to eco. Reality speaks different. Their mobile phones ipads that are locked that isnt even stolen just forgotten and so on "cannot" be unlocked whether it be for a good reason or anything they just wont help you. There is as of now more than "4 Billion unusuable" Apple products literally sitting in shelves. How is that being eco friendly ?
Android phones are better in dual sim management, charging ,customization, value, apps support,multitasking and other small things like that.  I traded in iphone for samsung because the above mentioned things were important for me.
I'm calling bullshit on Apple batteries.... two truths in the world of Apple ownership broken screens and incessant charging
Marcus takes a minor point and greatly amplifies its importance. For example his opinion on the better screen,  which should clearly be Samsung, went to iPhone bc if some curve bullshit. The text u read and pics u see are better on an S22 Ultra full stop.

Very insightful review, and I really enjoy the editing as well.  Thanks!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Iphone rules.  Android is a trash.
I think this video is biased because they give edge in customization in apple ..and we all in ios there is very limited customization. .
Lol!
If apple allowed 3rd party apps without jailbreaking and apks. I'll most definitely go with Apple.
It's great when you guys collaborate on videos. I have used both OSs and prefer Android because I find it quite a lot more customisable in different ways. I also find the iOS settings menu to be overly complex.
You say it's a controversial topic, yet you sugar coated everything concerning IOS. I've noticed in the pas couple years you've started to lean way more towards Iphone, seems like Marques was the influencer in that. When on a lot of levels, Android is much more vast and better than Iphone. Iphone wants to lock you in, and make you pay for everything they own. Just to make that money off of you. While Android is trying to further their technology to the specs of their phones, and better support you with what power you hold. While IOS, is just trying to continue personalizing apps they own to their operating system. Which in my opinion is completely unfair. Android has all the kinds of flexibility that IOS doesn't, I can play mobile games on pc for god's sake, and much more through the same logic. I hate Iphone, for closing off the gate for transferable data between Android and IOS. So I choose the company who actually cares about you, rather than the trillion dollar giant that doesn't need anymore than it already has. Shitty Apple Computers, and not worth it phones that lock you into their protocol. Apples taxes are horrendous and their policies are shit when you lose one of their phones. Sorry, but my computer uses Google Chrome, not apple search engine. More of the entire world uses google rather than apple.
i can listen to these two describe a burger the whole day
it's a sponsored video from iphone
Whew Thank God for this video, I was just about to cancel my iPhone 14 order to buy a Google Pixel 6 Pro.
Iphone users when they realize they cant download apks and cant do nothing on their shitty iOS:🥺
If only Apple made like low and mid range prices phone
They just praised IPhone's display over samsung😂.. I mean seriously??.. Below average content... Time wasted!!.. Most biased video I have ever seen..
Two iphone obsessed talking about the iPhone features.. Fully biased comparison.. There is whole bunch of convenient features of android which you did not even mentioned.. And you are in apple eco system.. Not everyone is using mac, iPhone, apples watches at the same time.. It is damn to inconvenient for one who has only the iPhone.. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
D
I am watching this video to see American vs British accent. 😅
Apple is just... BETTER
is this a apple sponsor?
Iphone can't[move pics to different albums in the gallery, they don't have a stock video player, don't have live screen savers] basic shit iphone is lacking I alway owned android phones [Samsung & notes] first time owning a iphone [14 pro max] I'm starting to regret getting this shit
The categories of comparisons and judging criteria were designed for apple to appear better but Samsung still sells more phones and actually innovative
Android stalls. I think the best time for Android was when companies like HTC came up with great phones and designs, LG, Sony (at peak) or Nexus devices from Google. After that it got worse. Huawei brought some of it back but got hit by sanctions. Other Chinese brands are not there where Huawei once were. Apple constantly got better over time. they closed the gap and now push more and more ahead
.
.
MKB is an I phone fan boy
I used Android pretty much my whole life, up until the iPhone X, since then, I have gotten every iPhone and fully embraced the Apple ecosystem. Honestly, the experience is way better in my opinion. Especially when you start adding accessories. The Airpods are best in class, the Apple Watch doesn't even have competition, Android Wear is just garbage. The complete package doesn't exist anywhere else.
lol bro.. 90% of iphone users carries a power bank with them and you say Iphone is winner in battery performance and on other side Android is with 80W vooc fast charging with long lasting battery power ...one sided video
When we talk about software ios/Android its the same to compare symbian/Android
My Samsung fold is the best experience with a phone ever. I've dropped it so much so much abuse and you can't even tell. Huge screen and all screens are useful 👌 my iPhone is great when my battery gets low on my android or I need a good picture
I love using multiwindow
I love using multiwindow
All I can say is there are nearly 1,300 brands of Android and only one Apple. Samsung only has 34% of the market. Comparing Android to iOS is impossible because their is so many models of Android base phones.  Android can be more affordable and with unlimited varieties to choose from. I have always felt that both have strong and weak points and much was up to personal choice. However, over the years more people have switched from Android to Apple and in the U.S. more people own iPhones than Android. iPhone 59% to Android 41%. Because Android is cheaper, it has the market globally. The bottom line is, It is your phone and you should buy the phone you like and can afford.
Icucks
I think comparing Android and iPhone isn't proper comparison because Android is an OS not a phone, you'd have a better comparison with iPhone v Vevo or Samsung...if you're going to them compare Android with anything then it should be against the ios where you'd get a better comparison And I think in software comparison, what us important to Apple users actually isn't for Android users and what's important for Android users isn't for Apple users, for example a PC Android user doesn't need air drop as it doesn't even work outside of the apple environment t meanwhile many of the Android features work in majority environments except some on the Apple environment as they just try to lock them out
My thing of watching review is just the both of you and what I think about most of your reviews, is that, they are too much Apple centre, and as people are saying in the comments, is that you are comparing and operating system with a single phone and that I see too. Most times, Arun will take to phones to compare and I see that as a plus, but with this video it isn't. My own review is that both you guys are great reviewers. But I encourage you to be clean and do reviewing so we can make our choices and instead of making your choice. Thanks guys.
It's just like ; your girlfriend vs your crush, which is actually better
As an iPhone user, I disagree. The facts used in this video will mostly favour the iPhone. But there are so many other factors to look into.
sangsung is best than iphone need buy all the app
Both of u are biased with apple always feel that
No one care what you plebs think, Android and  the phones that use them are mediocre at best, iPhones will always be the best. Pixel would be next best after iPhones.
I have not been on XDA in years
dynamic island is inspired by this video 🔎
Yeah this is just an advertisement for Apple guys.
It's kinda funny how every iPhone win was a total win, but when Android was better "okey leave it on a tie". Like, both said that the s22 ultra screen was better, but "hey iPhone can't lose so it's a tie"!
I don’t care about fast charging on the iPhone because it always without fail lasts the whole day, with android you probably have to use it whilst charging
Not Android vs IPhone. Samsung don’t like this video
If it was really this one sided between iPhone and all these Android phones,  nobody would buy Android
About apple I love the form factor that is 6.1inch, videography and about android there are features like shake and turn on torch, YouTube video and YouTube mp3 without adds, spotify without adds and about the comparison I saw in YouTube reviewers they use to say android camera  have vibrant colour Its not natural and now at iphone 13  the colours are more vibrant than samsung and what they say now is m liking the colour reproduction of Iphone damn… i tried backing up my photos and videos with cable to my pc and it failed everytime I try so I have to download itunes and download again the files to backup to my pc..  In computer world its windows vs imac  Everyone knows which one is better and In smartphone world its android not apple in terms of flexibility and after all it depends on what way u r using if you are a lowkey user then go for iphone  Fews days before the iphone 14 launch they are making this Video so now they might have got the Iphone 14 series free
Arun was definitely biased in his comparison.  Makes you wonder if he received some perks from Apple.  Doesn't matter, I've decided on an Android. 😉
the battery experience with iphone ALWAYS sucks
i have the s22 ultra and i love it
Best Android feature for me is me being able to run modded apps. No cap.
i thinks this is one of the worst video's of you guys, a lot of "i think"s, everything is kind of vague, i'm used to your more specific videos.
Notice how he didn't say samsung vs iphone because it's always something what of a tie.
Stop! There both better in there own ways it's equivalent in their own ways.
Samsung have a better screen, yeah its much better, hmm its hard .. its a TIE then :D
TO BE HONEST IAM NOT GOING WITH THE HYPE.... IAM DROPPING IPHONE FOR REFRESH RATE AND SAMSUNG FOR BATTERY.... I WILL WAIT FOR ANOTHER YEAR..!!
You had to give features to android.
Display and Battery. No doubt should go to Android and Camera is a Tie.
That black dude is such an Apple fan boy  it's starting to get annoying.  He never wants to  admit that iPhone is a piece of crap
He's a shill for Apple, why would he say anything else? Camera; better, especially at night, and I've gone up against Iphone users. Ram; better, for multi tasking and working while downloading. Far better battery life, this has been proven by pro's on multiple channels, the Android always takes it with the better battery. Flexibility; I can get any app I want, without the hassle of having to put in my credit card info or anything like that. Pure flexibility and control with MY phone. You're essentially Apple's bitch.   Lastly; USB-C this feature alone destroys apple phones, everyone is using USB C and will continue to use it for years...apple wants to sell you a bridge with your name on it...no thanks.
One major benefit of Android is plugging an Android into a PC and not needing to download iTunes
Well if I keep it simple that Ios providers you with a fast software with greater security but an apple user cannot go beyond the boundaries they have set for their users on the contrary android is a free world where a user is not bounded by Android and can download what ever he feels like, in the end its totally a personal choice that how a user view both of these OS.
Someone seems to be a bit biased towards Apple. Or just sponsored by them.
Hugely bias review which I wasn't expecting. So many big Android pluses missed out.
iPhone destroyed android in this video. Expected.
This review is SUPER biased!
I think marques just like iphone, this isn personal choise but so many correct reasons why iphone (Y)
Thanks buddy. You missed two factors - the value for money and durability. Which is the most important factor and I think the iPhone (Apple Products) is a clear winner. Yes I agree Apple products are expensive but then we have no choice as of now if you want priceless piece of mind and be productive with your valuable time.
This Marquez dude is such an apple fanboy.
It's not like android users are missing out on imessage or facetime app, there's like a million apps for communicating that everyone can download
Evethough I'm android user, imo Iphone wins bc the chip software hardware made specifically for couple devices, so it would be smooth as po*nstar a$$
8:13 🤣🤣😂
Android such as redmi has better camera than IPhone .. redmi has 108 megapixel & iPhone is 48 megapixel … I’m suffering with iPhone
WHAT? Their different person?
If you never had any phone. Better to have the latest Samsung I guess. As 12 years iPhone user I hate Apple just because of the iTunes, but love for almost everything else, but mostly responsiveness.  P.S. I also hate when some iPhone features were easy and then they made it even more complicated and couple of touches away, like the flash light in the camera. Apple where is the Pause feature while videoing?
Sorry guys but, I got bored! It is like seeing gmc/ford/dodge vs toyota. All the others brands will put the best they have to bit toyotas cars reliability and quality and resale value!
Bruh samsung takes better photos then iphone and can play all games plus emulators you can play ps2 and Nintendo games on galaxy s21ultra with no lag. You can also multi-task and internet is way faster in Android.
i just got a 30 watt charger and my iphone charges 20-30% in like 5 minutes. thats pretty damn fast imo
To me android  gives you what you want, exemplo dex, when you use dex you use a phone and a ''pc''' at the same time, apple wants you to buy iphone macs and ipads
No matter the outcome people should stick with whatever they are most comfortable with. Even if iPhone would be loose this i would still pick it over android phone only because of iOS. Android phones mayr have some better hardware (maby not CPU) but cameras etc but for me it's all abut software and OS. If samsung could run iOs i'd give it a try. 4 years ago i gave up on androids cause my phones couldnt run smooth after 2 full years (last phone that I had was galaxy s6). My entire family is using android phones (ex samsung flagships) and those phones ain't that smooth as they used to be. I'm still using iP Xs and the only problem I have is with memory cause 64GB aint enough.
the whole curved phone flat phone hand holding arguement is moot imo - who does not put a case on it anyway? at least mass consumer.... only fn movie stars walk around with phones that don't have cases on them. "it puts dents in my hand" cmon dude...
I have google pixel 5 and iphone 13 when I bought iphone I thought the iPhone cameras will do much better job but it isn’t even google pixel is one year older than iphone some shots still better in google also the video idk why i feel like i need to go back to my pixel but i still want to believe apple cam is better than android
Great
🥱
It’s official, iPhone is better than Androiphone.   Android, especially Samsung, continues to add gimmicks to their phones instead of fixing their real problems, it doesn’t matter if you have 108 MegaPixel sensor when your image processing can’t keep up, it doesn’t matter when you have fast charging when it wears out your batter health and your battery life is sh*t, it doesn’t matter if you have a bigger battery when your power inefficient processor chew through it like it is nothing and it make the phone explode, it doesn’t matter when a 1000 dollars Z flip can be flip to half the foot print when your camera quality is equivalent to a 500 dollars phone and the battery life will be even worst thanks to the wasted space for the hinge, not to mention the crease in the middle and the fact the screen is way less scratch resistant and reliable, it doesn’t matter that I can have a Z fold that unfolds into an iPad mini size tablet, when it cost more than a f**king iPhone 14 Pro Max and an iPad mini combined, or more than a F**KING GAMING LAPTOP, and performs worst than a last gen iPhone 13 and lasts shorter than it’s battery life, it doesn’t matter if I can do split screen on a Samsung phone when most of it’s practicality evaporates with PiP mode, and I only have a 6 inch screen to work with, it doesn’t matter if you have double the ram on Samsung, when you don’t know how to efficiently use it, gimmicks after gimmicks, while at the same time being a hypocrite and removing the actual useful things on there phone like the headphone jack, and the charger (I mean at least Apple give you a charger when you buys an iPad, Samsung don’t even give you a charger when you buy their Tab) right after they made fun of Apple for removing them.
These two would make a great couple.
Hi!
The s22 ultra display beats every iPhone..out of all people these two should know that1
The only things I found on iOS phones that I think that's better than on Android are the software update support length and the lidar sensor
Facetime, Airdrop, and shareplay are all apps that can easily be replicated (and are replicated almost daily) on Android because of how easy it is for developers to make apps for it.
Lol i can give you a damn long list where Android and Samsung galaxy s22 win far away.and for this  I dont have to be a tech geek 😅😅
Mkbhd is an apple fan boy
I think a better comparison would just be samsung vs iPhone. Android got robbed a lot during this.
Iphones cannot download unofficial apps, iPhone got lots of restrictions................ Android is more friendly
iPhone compared to a mash of all possible androids…
Talking up facetime... Google Duo: "Am I a joke to you?"
""Air drop" is important to so many people" vs charging port on the side of ONE phone? hunh? really?! I suppose these "tech youtubers" haven't heard of COPY+PASTE, ctrl c+v, hence it didnt make it into the argument. This video is extremely biased! wow. apart from usb c and bla bla usual stuff, there are SO MANY THINGS IMPORTANT TO SO MANY PEOPLE!  I personally cant see myself live without specific inbuilt apps that can store and save passwords locally (no internet access) on the device and lock them with fingerprint, so i dont have to remember 50 damn passwords, or care about saving them online. Speaking of that, FINGERPRINT SCANNER!  I'm not saying one is better than the other, cus i have both. but, I mean, this video is just....
Iphone succ in 2022.
Terribly biased video, you should make your own vídeo with your own opinions, which I think are more objective. U either compare IOS vs Android, which Android wins by a load in almost all the categories. Or Iphone vs other Brands, for example vs Samsung imo Iphone loses and it also struggles against some others like Xiaomi. Sure Iphone has some great points, but it also has its drawbacks.
Feels like it should be IOS vs Android. Anyway MKBHD seems heavy biased towards Iphone while Arun just letting him get his way.  Fairly disappointed with this video, Iphone got many points it shouldnt have, it just feels like Iphone fanboying disguise as tech wise. I think if Arun had made his own video without any MKBHD it would have gone a lot different, Arun is a lot more impartial and tech wise imo.
Android can hide videos and photos with free app but iphone cant
apple is competing with the whole android consortium
Y don't you guys come up with an entirely new platform and brand to challenge the ios/android market .... I think you would do amazing... You both understand tech and the market better than anyone these days.... I've seen the views you guys have.... Surely that's enough an audience to give it a shot... :)
If I am being honest, considering the fact that they took a lot of effort in taking the video, I don't feel like it paid off. It was more like a personal preference video rather than a proper comparison of what's actually better. These are two people whom a huge community looks up to, to make their purchasing decision. Considering that, it feels like there wasn't much thought put into this conversation .
Android has options while iOS doesn't... Android wins for me 🤷‍♂️
arun was shocked every time he'd know new things about marq. lol
I think the better battery on the cool new apple watch ultra will make many consider switching to apple
I legit won't buy an iPhone again until they adopt usb-c
for me, if the phone can run games without many problems, make calls, take photos, send messages and watch videos it is alredy very good
I think that when both phones reach there final mature stage they may be on the same level or android wins it cause apple will be making a better of the latest android then once the apple releases a better of androids previous phone, android would have already released a better of there previous phone so basically they beating the same thing if you get what I mean
And my youtube app on samsung just crashed while watching this video🤣🤣
I think the other reviewer is dumb! Like come on.... iPhone has better battery?? Seriously?
If u want to show the cristians that u ain't afraid to bite into the apple... hail satan !
Iphone is just overated.
As soon as they called it a draw on display.. I knew it was BS. Android phones have always had better displays way before iphone 🙄. Don't worry guys iphone 20 will finally get an on display fingerprint scanner. LMAO!
They are taken money from steve Jobs... Fuck....
MKHB ✌️😍
My Samsung s21 Ultra with 16 GB / 512gb is a beast and even the Samsung s22 Ultra doesn't do anything to beat It. The camera setup, the battery life, the fast charging capability, the wireless charging and the reverse wireless charging, the display, the insane zooming camera, plus the amount of Open source software to use it as a PC kills any iPhone by far.
Mk... I believe that you have a lot of bias in favor of iPhone and I don't know where you get the facts that Android is trailing iPhone. Every piece of hardware that Android has implemented in the latest flagship phones by far obscure the presence of iPhone. I do understand your bias for Apple because the Kool-Aid is definitely very strong for those who follow Apple... I used to drink the Apple Kool-Aid back when they werethe best computers in the 80s and 90s
It's clear how mkbhd is completely biased towards iPhone, bullshit
Michael really tried to give him a knuckle 20:07
Actually fret content.. really entertaining and thought provoking
its a bit unfair to compare apple to the whole on android tho cs android have more companies to try and get a better os, specialised phones etc
You guys missed a very very important point. SOFTWARE UPDATES to the OS, which might influence the VALUE for money category.
Samsung s22 ultra best 👌 👍
The software support comments were incorrect. You said that the only phone that comes close to the 5 years of support for iPhone is Samsung with 4 years, but the Pixels now match the iPhone with 5 years of support. It was a big selling feature of the last pixel generation, I'm surprised you failed to mention it.
Lel when you decide to give win to iphone xd tbh iphone is only a beast in videography but it's not even close to android in photography - charging - battery life
it works perfectly! Thanks buddy
I knew the world will comment more on this video, well i think the whole 🌎 has to decide which one is better, iPhone is a good phone no doubt but can't compare to that of Android, the only thing IOS is better is just video shooting and software update, which is just marketing, i think the geeks around the 🌎 will go for Android, Period!
If theyre looking at baseline battery... then look at baseline display... so contradicting and bias
Sometimes I feel this channel is sponsored by Apple 🤣
iPhone battery life is way worse than android
android
Great in-depth analysis of the two platforms.I only purchase budget Android phones and can not justify spending lots of money on flagship device's.
I want an iPhone (hardware) but when I actually use one I get frustrated as hell cause iOS just straight up sucks. Hence I choose Android. But if Apple ever sells iPhones with an option of factory installed (and supported) Android, I would choose that over Samsung's every day of the week.
Thanks for that really helped me
It's all comes down to your personal choice get what you like and not what someone tells you to get. Ik in this video it's you guys personal opinion and people should understand that. Everything has its pros and cons.
I used to get Mrwhosetheboss and mkbhd confused
Did we forget to tell you that we both love and use apple products?  What a joke.
Honestly they are both great phones
Whats crazy is that this the iphone is made by one company only, whereas the android phones, there are so many different companies and still the iphone wins..
Clearly biased towards iPhone 🥱🥱
You know it's the most biased comparison straight away after the displays got a draw😂
Google pixel can take good photos than i phone with its small camera
Marques brownlee is forever biased towards Apple products how page is basically about Tesla and Apple
It’s look like partial comparison
I think iPhone can never match Android costumisation
Fact is mk is bias..  he is an apple guy.. even when huawei was doing way better for cameras.. so u know
Big miss. You guys kept giving gratuitous wins to iPhones and glossing over so many good things about Android phones. Disappointing.
I really dig iphone...android sucks! Voice text works 20% of the time. Facial and fingerprint have alot of (no recognize) and the very face the keyboard blocks for texting are small
Apple wants a monopoly, they want to create an apple version of everything and make you use it on an i device. Phones that run android OS give you way more freedom and flexibility. I don't think you can even download third party apps on iPhones
The phone that is better is the one that works best for you
Bias
Both are really good, but android is better in my opinion
Arun makeing a video where he says that iphone has a better camera
Really?! Android is an operating system not a phone!!!
Is it  biased  Him - yes
UNFAIR  RATING
I am moving more on to the samsung side its more promising features and camera is so much better iphone is boring and they dont change their backover which is very annoying
When it comes to Eco Consciousness, I think you didn't really even bother looking at how iPhone has still not really done any right to repair. It is still better for you to buy a new phone than get one fixed with apple and that's clearly not very good for the environment.  Anyway this is how you make a biased fight, feature arguments that only highlight the strong features of one alternative.
Multi window is the feature I use the most on my s10+, I have Google maps and YouTube to listen to music on screen at same time whilst I'm driving.  I wanted an iPhone but lacknof that feature stops me getting it.
2:18 most decent android BTFO the iphone in games, though, especially in Genshin
Personally I think that iOS and Android are both equally good and it depends on your usage and also which you like some like iOS and some Android
Apple might have some benefits but those are overshadowed by the practicality of Android. Seemless transfer of data across any device, usb type C, hyper charging, wide choice of free application, larger ram for multi-tasking, brighter screens (and Android users been using OLED screens for a hell of a lot time than iPhone users), zero bothersome notches on screen etc to name a few. But if you ignore all this, Apple is the best especially given the fact that it's way more expensive and a nightmare to repair.
I would honestly say this video was wholly BIASED, and you can see it several times when Arun reacts with a bewildered face to the things Marques says. Marques was really reaching on some things, like the flat shape of an iphone, or the software, knowing Android is vastly more flexible with root capability. Praising things like facetime as if Android doesn't have more than one way to video chat. They gave draws to things android won easily hands down. I would say they're closer to tied as competitors. Not knocking either one, but the bias was egregiously bad on Marques's part here. The vast landslide in points that he painted iPhone as having simply does not exist at all. How is iPhone eco friendly when they lobby to block all legislation for Right to Repair? Undeniably laughable. They really didn't think this video through. For a tech reviewer this exposed marques as completely oblivious and destroys his credibility all together.
It's tough being an android user. Always getting made fun of just because of the phone
I think apple pays you good guys 🤣🤣🤣
I disagree with the rating
Homie really had a collab interview to end the debate wich phone is better. Legend.
Uses a Samsung but highly rates the iPhone 😂😂😂.
It’s funny… I have an iPhone, but I never use facetime, airdrop.. Siri... And more... 😅 I am not a regular iPhone user! 😂
I think Apple's claims of being eco friendly are balanced out by me blatant planned obsolescence, trying their hardest to make sure old devices and parts that still work are disposed of, as well as things like removing features and accessories that require more shipping and packaging to be used in order to make the devices usable. Not to mention forcing people to buy new devices and throw away expensive devices that can easily and cheaply fixed.
The truth is that iOS is made to have an quite awesome integration with other devices, witch android don't have. But it's hard to compare cuz android has lots of varieties and different resources/configuration. So find a canonical to compare is hard...
I stopped using iphone at the jet black 6 I switched to Samsung and I won't go back to iPhone
Android are good a battery then ios
Having had most iPhones and now used Samsung Fold 2 for two years, it's no surprise iPhone wins again. Just overall better at everything they do. There are so many things in software on Android that feels cheap and half finished.
Biased bull shit
This comment section is filled with immense amounts of copium lmao
Once I got the s22, I'll never get an apple product again.
Why is this guys sound always so weird?
This is kinda a lopsided comparison. Android is an operating system over multiple phone manufacturers. Where the iPhone and iOS are exclusive to apple.
Cool
I'm about 55-45 in apples favor! I had the note 20 ultra and used the 12 pro max I loved apples UI more, and I fly dji drones and dji drones work better for apples devices! So now I'm upgrading to the 14 pro max I'm excited to get it😁
Let's hear from our video sponsors Apple....
A iPhone lasts 6 years longer than android.
When I saw mkbhd in title, I knew iphone was gonna win XD
Objective...but!
Hello my name is Imran I'm 13 years old and I wanted the Samsung s22 and an iPhone 13 Pro and some cool earphones and a smartwatch I live in Africa and Uganda I live in a town called Kampala I watch your videos a lot no I was asking if you could bring these things for me if you can thank you
And I'm on samsung
the battery is fake for the iPhone I watched a hole 1hour and 30 minute movie on 14 percent and after that I was still 9 percent
Yo iPhone can't download music on the actual phone it makes you sign up to a app that stores the music on the app instead of the phone, also you can't download as much apps as a android phone. IPhone isn't as good as a android when it comes to what you can do on it emetertainment wise. IPhone wants you to subscribe to apple products just so you can do basic phone stuff, but android gives you freedom to do whatever you want. So for me android wins, my opinion is iphone is a cult of fans who feel they need to keep buying from apple just because its the hype, just to say they own a apple product but hey each to their own 🙂
You all are suckers of apple😡😡😡
This guy acting shocked just because he was using an year older flagship phone . Me who is using a 130 dollar realme for the past 4 years
Siri is kinda like the internet explorer vs chrome meme.  I use iPhone, and I swear, 90% of the time he’s special…. Like reeeeal special.  Everything else I love, but as advanced as apple is, they could do so much better.
i like those guys both
shouldn't they be comparing a specific android phone to iphone??
iPhone is overrated
Bros just love iPhone, Samsung is the greatest smartphone ever and if I don't get Samsung I'll use any some other android phones but iPhone nah
iPhone has lost its edge over the high end Androids I think. I am an iPhone user, and I use the latest device. As a software engineer, I feel like living in a cage using it. I absolutely like the MacBooks with Apple silicon, but not a fan of the phones
This video was pretty biased, since most of it was focused on cameras while the average doesn’t really care much about that stuff. Android has a better price range, more freedom and customisation capabilities, and people can download and do all sorts of things like using third party apps very easily on Android but such things are almost impossible on IOS. iPhone has now become the phone of the rich, while Androids have become the preferred phones of the masses
Iv never understood the big rave about iMessage and face time.  Im like aww you mean a fancy name for a text message or video call 🤷🏼‍♂️
wow wonderful comparison
My android charges in 40 minutes with 2 days battery backup lol
I like Android
You guys are apple fan and you are not telling what is right you are just telling what you like as an apple fan
I really like your videos, but this one seems unfair for me, like "filtered" by your location, and the people living there : I mean habits, house income, and level of consumption.. So if your title is "An droid vs iPhone" and not "Best droids versus Max", the result can't be this one.  And no, facetime  is not in large use around me as far as I know - this is an example of how far is my referential from yours.
The day I switch back to an iPhone is the day jailbreaking becomes a thing again. Ahh, Cydia, those were the good ol days man.
Arun needs to state his points more aggressively, he keeps the table open and the other guy just opens his mouth and steals the points. I think this is a very biased video.
I just upgraded from my straight talk Motorola stylus to an iPhone 13 pro max. I am absolutely astounded at the difference.
I used iPhone for 10 years. The battery degradation time is ridiculous. The iPhone is useless after a year. It lasts for a few hours.
I'd take an iPhone over an Android any day; it just has much better apps and all of its products work flawlessly together.  Apple nailed the concept of what a smartphone should be right out of the gate, whereas Android makers only saw smartphones as pocket computers - they missed the holistic value of what a user gets - Apple got it right away.   It's worth noting that it took Android phones years to shed their 'cheap junk' image, and they did so by focusing on build quality, smooth animation, and user experience - essentially by copying what Apple did from the start.
MKBHD is just another one of those brainwashed (US) American isheep. He thinks these are his opinions and that his opinions are based on own his personal experience. They are not. He’s just a brainwashed, wealthy (US) American.  I say “(US) American”, because most people in the rest of the Americas aren’t that brainwashed by capitalism.
Let's be honest this was a biased video and is bullshit.
Alot of average users doesn't know the apple phones are selling you old tech for current prices
Nah i use the multi tasking everyday, chattin with someone and watchin a utube video, or when u want to take notes doin stuff on phone
idk why but it feels so unfair to iOS like when Android is better, it’s because phone A wins iPhone in this aspect, phone B wins iPhone in this aspect. it isn’t rly Apple vs Android anymore but Apple vs 2637383 companies
As of 2022 phones have reached a level of only a few features upgrade every year and both sides are neck and neck on comparison just a few differences. So it really boils down to which user interface and operating system you prefer. In my opinion of course
IPhone fan boys. Known for being brainle$$$ 😜
Complete joke this video! I guess the Android camera is better but we will give the point to the Iphone 🤦🤯
Is Android beter for me but i have a nice idea💡 what if in the future🔮 has a phone📱 it has the quality of the tow phone??? 🧐 is a good idea right?
This turned out to be a disappointing biased video
This looks like a gold spoon comparison. Few things which matter to normal user is compatibility with the external world, Freshness, variety are all missing.
I much prefer the S21 Ultra over the s22
The Nokia smart phone batteries be like: *amateurs*
Ill take Android anyday🤖
Watching the video and owning a pixel I actually agree that the iPhone is the generally better phone. You can do so much with iphones now that you couldn't in the past. I'm sticking with my pixel 6 pro for a few reasons though I'm invested in the system and to switch would be too pricey. I love what makes a pixel a pixel. If iPhone had call screen you can bet I'd buy it in a heartbeat. iPhone 14 is probably the last iPhone to have lightning as opposed to USB c, as Europe recently made it mandatory that apple use USB c on all their devices by 2023. So there's no point in buying the 14 rn. Lastly I'm going to reiterate price!!!! For their top of the line phone, with accessories comes out to 2 grand!!! That's ridiculous money for a phone. They would only take 260$ off a trade in for my pixel. I'm sure I'll get a better trade value when the pixel 7 pro rolls out.  That said my pixel overheats constantly, battery life is meh at best and I have experienced what mkbhd has talked about. Pictures RARELY might just not save. I think it's a big that has been fixed since then, I haven't experienced it at all in recent memory
HaHaHa Iphone Advertising
Also android isn't as greedy for money
I don’t think that score is as accurate as it could be. I am a longtime Apple user, I have an Android tablet for the sake of needing something with Android on it, and a PC for games that don’t exist for Mac, but otherwise I’m very much an Apple user. But I think Android should have scored better. I think the field is much more even these days; Apple does wait to implement features until they can do it well, and I personally like that, but other people like having those features even if they’re less refined early on. It’s a matter of preference, and having the features should win them points even if ultimately some users like me don’t value them.  I agree with all of the reasons Apple won each category as far as my personal preference and user experience, but I think some things that Android users care about should get more weight than you gave it. I expected it to be much closer in the end, even as much as I personally prefer Apple. I just ordered a 14 pro and I’m annoyed it doesn’t have usb C, for example. Like. It’s not better, just different. Short of inventing a phone that can clean my house for me I doubt anything will entice me over to Android at this point, decades and very many thousands of dollars invested into the Apple ecosystem, but I suspect the same is true for a lot of Android users on the flip side. It’s what you said at the end - it’s just about preference.
first video ive seen where iphone wins
TL:Dr if you Rich rich go with Iph but if you Just an everyday dude Android wins
One thing that makes me not want to go to android again, is the connectivity between the devices, like you can copy something on the iPhone, and then paste it with the ipad. I use that feature so much, and just in general the connectivity..
What about security, which one is more secure?
I am not sure how Iphone is eco-friendly, when they dont provide accesories. I think shipping charger and earbuds leaves pretty huge carbon mark.
Watching how Apple is a clear winner, while Watching on my s21 Ultra, yeah I still prefer Sammy. I agree no matter what it all comes down to your likings, and what has the most value to you.
Money money money!!! Paid advertisement is love
Why do i feel like his stanning i phone ... becuase the latest s 22 ultra destrys i phone.....like samsung s 22 ultra is the best phone out there
The compelling case for software "features" on an iPhone I view them more like shackles as opposed to features.
for you both to be so factual..... this comparison only had opinions with no data. This is odd......
My point of view is, apple isn't making phones according to consumers demands. Their operating system doesn't allow you to explore. Android phones, Samsung in particular pays kind attention to consumer's demands and gives you total freedom to to what you want with your phone. To me, Android wins
Bias bs
i've always been anti-apple simply because they've refused ieee standards. i know we've been through a bunch of them over the years but still, could have supported mini-b and micro-b and c, but still just nahhhh despite the fact that there are so many hundreds of other devices that use these standards. also it's cool to see that apple is adding more customization because that was the other thing that always kept me on android. i want my desktop set up a very particular way and apple didn't allow that for the first 15 years of their product line, so at this point sorry i'm not switching 🤣🤣🤣
Iphone is superior in every aspect  except for the lightning port.
Android is the best he is just an iPhone user.
Emulation is better on Android
I feel like a huge plus for android is that you're not stuck with one brand of phone. Designs, hardware etc etc. It's almost endless with android.
I like to play a game on my phone now and then, preferably for free. So android it is. Game not for free? An Android phone happily runs apps that were not downloaded from the Play store. And I like a bit of customization. Instal Nova launcher, and just like that, completely different phone.
A bunch of iSheeps talking about tech
In my opinion the iPhone didn't win fairly, so here's some cool features of Samsung I can think of off the top of my head, there is definitely more.  - one thing that I absolutely adore about Samsung, is you can add websites to your homescreen. I use this A LOT.  - the Google playstore 100% wins against the apple store. On the Google playstore you can get games, movies, books and apps. You can also earn points for using the games, which you can use as money when purchasing things. Samsung also has a lot more apps than IPhone.  - the camera can do so much more stuff. One of my favourite features on the camera is the sideways panorama, it's so useful when taking landscape images. I also love how you can change the enhancing colour and create your own filters.  - just in general, Google being connected to basically the whole phone is amazing. Google is much better than safari and also the iPhone Google can do much less stuff. Something I use a lot is "desktop mode", as it gives me the opportunity to access things on Google only computer users generally can.  - yes Apple may have stuff on the lockscreen, but Samsung has a side bar. The side bar has so much stuff in it that is customisable, a compass, clock, the weather, notifications, websites of your choice, apps, messages, contacts, phone software details, a quick glance at all your apps...  - the design of the Samsung is much more neat. The whole beehive cameras is very clunky and can honestly make me overwhelmed, samsung is neatly layed out. - the idea samsung is getting to with future phones... I mean having a foldable phone... I have the s22 ultra and when I tell you how useful a stylus is, you won't realise until you have one.  - the themes. Apple may have "stolen" Samsung's widgets idea, but what it doesn't to this day have, is themes. Downloading a theme can change the WHOLE phone, the backround of dial screen, the clock design, the picture that shows when you tap your phone not on but just to see the date and time and battery, the keyboard, the app display, the colour of your status bar, the backround of messages. Then you also have the option of using any font you like... Any size.  - One thing that isn't related to the phones themselves, but the brand. I don't like Apple's attitude. "Let's leave the creativity to other people and just steal their ideas and act like we're geniuses". I also really didn't like the way they purposefully were making phones slower to force people into buying new phones more often. If they weren't forced to stop, they would've continued... That's just dishonest and I don't want to support a company like that.  - Samsung may be expensive, but if you are already a user and want a new phone, you can trade in an old phone for a huge discount... I got $577.91 off (which is a lot here, idk in America, I converted my currency) - you wouldn't believe how good watching something on Samsung is, idk but that huge chunk at the top of an apple, with the camera is just too much. I barely even notice mine - the fact that it can connect to your desktop and you can literally go on your phone and do normal stuff on it, on your computer... Also the cable is a huge plus (I mean we all know desktop wins by far against a MacBook) - when I copy something on my phone, I can literally paste it on my computer
You know someone is a good reviewer when you genuinely can't tell what brand they prefer
I do not agree at all. You cannot compare Iphone with Android , use a specific Android phone like the S22 Ultra.
This is the shittiest understanding of a Samsung product I've ever seen.
my Mom was calling me for help and i literally couldnt leave this video it felt impossible  keep up the great work :D
This is like a debate about abortions between 2 conservatives. Fuck this video. It even shows at the end.
they should update it
That's what happens when apple fans attempt to be objective
We needed someone making a stronger case for Android against iphone in this comparison. Not just straight up concede to - iPhone is better 😓
Baised views... unexpected from them..
You must think again about multi tasking option for android.. because my Samsung s8 working well when I put to u tube in pop up mode and work with other app...
if you want free stuff go with the android if you want expensive things and you are a fan go with apple
Biased video... Scoring system was other worldly to say the least ...lol
Follow Jesus
None of the blabber that comes out from marqueefs mouth is based on objective facts. "OH in my opinion,.. to me.. based on feel..." do some research, I know the iPhone is technically inferior but for me that's fine cause it works for me.. complete bs lol
Why that S22 ultra was SOOOOOOOOOOO DIRTY, i mean the screen 😅😆
Every time I think, "Five year support, best performance, camera," some one with the latest iPhone will ask for my help. And the locked down, Apple-only experience - not to mention the price they want for 120hz - consistently leads me to "nope". For me, the OS and its hostility to anything non-Apple remains a killer. Never wanted to be a member of the master race (brand blather). For that kind of money, simply must work for me. The five year support remains tempting, in spite of everything.
damn their is so many android users that are so butt hurt😂😂😂 if android  won I wouldn’t be crying about it 💀
CRAPPLE IJUNK
Great video Arun! But I just wanted to point out that comparing iPhone vs the whole Android smartphone market is kind of unfair. Since “Android” is just an OS that all of these use to run.
Android has nearby share
This is a very biased video
You guys are not comparing ios and android, it seems like you want to prove how ios is better than android. If you had already choose the ios to win then why bother to compare?
Great collaboration
Ur reviews are really so good and iPhones are really way more better than android 🤷🏻‍♂️ but android has also so many features like customisation and more but now also Apple had these too , pretty much all things that android have or even better than android, after seeing the iPhone 14 series I'm so famboying over the sleek design of the island. Definitely well thought out. Looks like it flows beautifully.
Here's how you know ANdroid loses. THey make over 1k+ different phones a year. Apple makes 4, maybe 5. All you gotta know.
Is there an android device, that holds it's value as well as, and also gets updates 7 years into the future as much as an iphone? No, ok, Iphone it is. Simple as that. Anybody in here who says android is bettter, is denying the simple truths that determine what holds value, what retains value, and what is paid for. Anybody who says android is better, is simply lying, no matter how many gimmicks they slap into their phones, it doesn't increase it's value, resale value, or increase it's function or longevity. Jailbreaking your phone is illegal, so being able to "do whatever you want on your phone" is not an intended opportunity for anyone buying an android phone. Just because you can do something on an android phone, that is illegal isn't a "win" lmao. Iphones, you get the clout, you get much more value out of your device, and you get a device that is recognized and supported through 7 years minimum of content.  what's the best thing an android phone has to offer? Cheaper price, gimmicks, can be jailbroken much easier then an iphone? LMAO. Not things the majority consumer is going to consider. LMAO
I would say you guys are a bit biased towards apple. I use both samsung and apple. Battery of android is better, screen is better, i would say camera on samsung note is better tbh but in s and iphones are almost same.
I would never own an iPhone. Overpriced, overrated and must be cheaply made.   I see people buying a new iPhone almost every year if not every other year. I got a Samsung Note 2 back in 2012 and the battery finally took a crap on me around March of this year (2022). So I bought a Samsung Note 10+, that im sure will last me another 10 years and not have to buy a new one every year or every other year, like iPhone users do, must be cheap tech or product.
So who the hell won lol
When Android doesn't get a +1 on software features it just shows that the whole video was just biased. The main big thing with android is the fact you can do whatever you want with it and the insane customizability. Also the whole gaming section seemed like Marques was going to give a "but" answer but he never did and the topic just went to talking about Ram. Also, most games come out at the same time on android. Unless the "games" you play are those boring racing mobile games every phone reviewer seems to enjoy.  I actually have no problem with iPhone winning most of them as the whole appeal of iPhone is the consistency and optimization of their devices (battery, fps, camera, etc). My main issue was not giving points to things that clearly belonged to android. Android for example has actual gaming phones but that's not really factored in or is dismissed with "but do they even run a specific game?". Android should have gotten a point for software features as well as gaming at the very least imo
I've always been on Android, but I believe Apple (as in now 08/09/2022) it's way better than Android for multiple reasons and most of those have been mentioned in this video.
iOS isn't catching up. Not by a long shot lol. Until I can get TRUE multitasking on iOS and I can send my friend a song through Bluetooth on iOS, iOS can go fuck themselves. 😂😂
borders are so 1980's
This is not rationaly voted  also the not arun guy saying "it's a whole year old, it's crazy" gives some very weird vibes
Android has so many choices of devices. It's a win
Use an iphone every day, and you will learn how terrible it is,
Can't play every game on iphone, emulation is so easy on Android
the fact you can select multiple contacts on ios is a huge thumbs down.
The video is extremely biased towards iphones. Even if Andoid is better in a category the point will still go to iphones or it will be a tie, just because Marques likes iphones.
At some points, when Android was better, he had picked iPhone,  as his Personal Preference.  And where iPhone was better,  He explained why it is better. There was his personal preferences in the battle, Which he clarified at 19:48   So, I think its depends on us, what to Choose Am i right Guys?
Stopped watching when MKBHD said the iPhone camera is better. He just proved he is a biased fan boy lol. He is the only YouTuber that has said that lmaoooo
you know iPhone is way better when you gotta compare a phone to whole operating system across different devices lol what a ridiculous comparison, do it phone for phone next time
Android are good in design and easy to use .But have a low performance and durabillity .Drainage battery and heating main issues with the samsung .Iphones life 3-5 years high performance .Don"t wanna  pay anymore 1200£ up for a stupid samsung  burning my fingers while using a task .
Just checked out the new iPhone 14. Been a loyal fan to samsung for over 10 years ago. Was thinking of switching but then it came to my realization that iPhone does not have Google assistant. That killed it for me. I can't live without Google assistant. Super smart voice assistant. Years ahead than siri. So I'll stick with Samsung.
Am leaving this video when you finished with display. Samsung should get a10/10
Marques is so bias....it's like he's getting paid by them
I am an Android guy and I won't rehash why but I do think phones as just phones are reaching their plateau. I'm waiting for when phones replace desktop and laptop computers. I want to walk in my home and have my phone attach wirelessly to a monitor, keyboard and mouse and not have to think about it. There are ways to do that now, but they are all sloppy and cumbersome. I'm also waiting for over the air charging that technology is in it's infancy but it will be here before you know it.
The main thing I didn't like on the iPhone 13's was that the base and mini did not have 120hz or even 90hz refresh rate screens, as that's really important to me. I am a bit disappointed that the 14 and 14 Plus don't have it as well, but hopefully the 15's and 16's will have it on the base/plus/mini model (I will probably never get a Pro Max or a Pro ((maybe)) because they are extremely expensive)
I like both OS's so I didn't really care who won. I have a Samsung right now, but a lot of the features that I really wanted have been incorporated into the iPhone 14's and probably even more features in the iPhone 15's next year, so in about two-three years I might jump to iOS.
MKBHD is APPLE FANBOY 🐑 🐏 🐑 ...Why are you asking him about Android?
why do you have a guy who is Apple fanboy for all his life asking him on Android? This is another biased interactions...Samsung was making phones when Steve Jobs was messing with Apple computer in 80s...
Android will always crush Iphone..
Iphone was stuck on the same thing. That's why I prefer Samsung. Iphone is being copied, but they will never get over it. And how are you asking him those questions when they are both promoters of Iphone.
Iphone =expensive garbage!
MKBHD has been a shrill for iPhone and Apple for a long time. Not surprised by this.
Im not gunna lie samsung / android is such a better photography and videography phone to use than iphone i have a 2 year old huwawi p30 pro and the camera in my opinion is even better than a phone 2 years older
Samsung literarily beats the I-phone in every category, on paper and in facts.
bro this guy is soooo biased
huawei is the best
The iPhones are so much more reliable for everything imo.
Mkbhd is just a fan of I phone and is the reason he is biased
This reviews is base on personal opion not on reality ,  we can see clearly KBHD its an iphone fan
Awarding mediocrity is the norm especially when talking about the iPhone "achievements" You could use flagship Android phones from 10 years ago like a computer, etc.
People when reviewers pick what they prefer: Hell yeah People when reviewers do not pick what they prefer: WTF, that's wrong
You’re talking to an apple fan. Both of you are an apple fan.
I definitely think android is the best, I've only had one iPhone,  4s and never again. Android is 10 years ahead also, while Apple is just now doing stuff.
Neither they're both trash from garbage companies that don't have your best interest in mind. You buy from either to them you don't actually own your phone. Constantly trying to lock you out of the bootloader from being able to customize your property. What's the point of paying over $1,000 for these devices if I don't actually own everything on it?
Samsung battery trash after 2022 software update.👎👎
tell everyone youre an ifan without saying youre an ifan, the video:
My wife is buying the new iPhone 14, expected cost is $1,749 + $178 tax for the 1tb version. I'm personally getting a Pixel 7 Pro that releases in October, same high end for $1,099 plus $114 tax.  So, about $714 difference for nearly identical flagship phones.  Legit no reason apple charges so dam much.
On android insta and snap photos look like 240p tho? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 🤡
This isn't answering my questions
I am having to buy a new phone. But I am trying to decide between iphone and smart cellphone
So my take on what company is more eco-friendly, is people that who use iPhone’s seem to keep that phone longer than people with Androids.
Yes.... USB c is better. Android phones are better for Bluetooth music due to codecs. Better choice of headphones with Android. Also apple owners are more likely to be snobs who own a VW transporter with energy drink stickers, and we all know they are twats!
Why are you wearing shorts
Apples bettter
Iam glad in software you talked about iphone specific features, because in hardware people compare iphone and samsung but samsung uses one ui which has some difference from stock android and different manufacturers make different changes
Completely unfair
I honestly think the performance for the apple is better but the androids battery life is a lot better than apples
Now all iphones are the same and everyone chooses iPhone? Like why?
MKBHD def prefers android and he not stand up for them or argue for them enough. The entire video was you saying how great iphone is. Terrible
you trying to give value a draw shows you are an isheep. Terrible video and biased.
For me android has a Huge advantage over iPhone. You can have a current phone with pretty much all you need and latest technologies for a a third or less of the price of a current iPhone. IPhone is a great expert at sucking every penny it can from its users.
USB C and Storage are big wins for Android devices. Why you didn't talk about storage guys?
this is very subjective
its really weird hearing MKBHD arguing for IPhone all the video , then turns out he is been using a Samsung s21 Ultra for a year and half now , hmmmm ....
I switched to iPhone a year ago and I will say, iOS is far better than android. I'm never switching back to android lol
This comment section is toxic.
Why is airdrop an essential feature? I seriously don’t get it.
Idk I have an iPhone and don’t think it’s better than android in many of the mentioned categories tbh. I only have an iPhone because overall I find it more simple than android however simple does not inherently make it better.
So, green is iphone and blue is android?
I think Samsung v/s Apple would be much fairer, same price = same comparison
I always like the Samung One UI when compared to IOS. But love the silky smooth native apps that specifically made for iphone, apart from that some apps wont work as it works in android. I love the bixby routine , secure folder , split screen , Dex . dex always helps me when I travel and need not carry a laptop with me. This is one of the greates features of Samsung.    this is a great video. but rating would have been balanced.
Marques brownlee the most biased idiot reviewer out there lol.
I think it would be more fair if it as 4-6, because in system features, android destroys Apple, you have total freedom to what you want and more fun/useful things like always on display,(also Apple is not using usbc and they started the charging brick drama, both cause more pollution, they shouldn't get that point)
The display without a doubt goes to android but that really crap what they did. There is no way it a tie not even close.
I don't really know about the whole very detailed tech side of it, but the iPhone design and interface is so beautiful and unique, which is enough to win me over
Android is funking better than ishit
One thing i don't like from apple you can't move the apps whatever you want and new devices are coming very thick I'm still with my S10 plus very happy slim and good camera
You never spoke of usb c...
Mate, How much apple paid you ?
I thought you're better than mkbhd but you're a crappy fan boy like he is but i understand it gives your views...
When I use Samsung galaxy it's like I'm in different country's, when I use iPhone it's like I'm stuck in America
Siri is not very smart unfortunately.
Whats the aspect ratio in this video?
This video is a clown show im so glad i didnt subscribe here. You guys spent the whole video being iphone stans. No objectivity at all. All of the great things the many android phones do and all you mention is great things about iphones. The galaxy 22 ultra is MILES ahead of the iphone 13 which is just a replica of every past iphone. Galaxy phones have so many features that iphones do not and none of that stuff came up. You just compare iphone to a bunch of trash android phones and five iphone the win in every catagory. Never sub to these clowns.
“BuT aNdRoID wInS bEcAuSe YoU cAn ChAnGe IcOns”  Keep mad baddroid users.
IOS wins by a long shot. Android is a buggy, stuttering mess.
It isn't the biggest deal for me, and I am myself a big Apple Fan, but this is kinda an unfair game for the iPhone when there is only iPhones from Apple and Android have such more choice. Although, Apple still won? ;) Either way, great video, my two favorite tech youtubers in a collab, amazing! have a great one
Apple wanted me to tell you guys to check your PayPal after this video. I agree with some things, but this was way over the top, lost all credibility.
No most of Samsung A series they are good camera and good price and strong battery and  plus best performance  lets face it check lots of staff android is the best take A series you will get the best answer. that what we need even the screen is perfect bro APPLE is expensive
Hi, I need your help i stuck in loopmode.  Google pixel 6 phone keeping looping in fastboot mode after opting out of android beta 13. Google pixel 6 was working find on Android beta 13. I decided to opt out. As soon as the Android 12 update started, the phone restarted and got stuck in fastboot mode since then. Going to start loops back to fastboot mode.Going to power off turns off the phone. Upon startup, phone comes back to fastboot mode.Rescue mode and recovery mode shows 'no command'.Unable to flash device using Google Android flash tool as unable to unlock OEM in this state of devide.
Both win
Rooted Android users with God mode be looking like "Get the Fuck out of here both of you 😂😂🤣🤣"
Android so much ugly🤮🤮wtf is that interface tho
Honestly android is very much better than iPhone but iPhone is much easy to use i use s22 ultra and i have millions of things i can do with my phone that you cant do with a iPhone same goes to iPhone
Your have started to compromise from very first battle number like how u can give a draw when s22 ultra have edge to edge with little dot beautiful screen to body ratio have more pixel 🤷.
If Apple users knew how much more you can get from an android they would change their minds. Most iPhone users just like the "Apple" logo attached to it
I’ve used a lot of both Androids and iPhones and I love them equally just because of how great they really are
Strange video.... you need to compare phones then compare os. Andriod experience can vary depending on brand. I can appreciate both phones for what they are. I cant get on with iPhone at all. The amount of times I need to sign in the apple count gets on my nut. Same with the pads. I find the apple brand does cheat its customers as well.
Expandable memory and usb-c.  Case closed.  Does Apple still use Samsung screens and other parts?
Very biased comparison. Please stop it.. I unsubscribed to you on my main account just because you're more annoyingly leaving out information about devices and here I thought a guest would balance out the comparisons but here we are, still the same.   This video didn't even highlight all of android's strong points, which by the way IS NOT ONLY ON SAMSUNG, and only the 'ios' strong points. This video should have been titled samsung vs apple ios  or "me vs [guest name]". Android is on many phones besides this fyi.  I am an iPhone user since the beginning of time just because I am too comfortable with it already but admire everything about android. My whole family uses android phones and enjoy every features and utilities you've clearly missed. Especially the fact that android ensure those who have older phones with android does not limit their users completely and enable them to access all the features and apps for years and years without the need to upgrade. Whereas Apple manipulates the market to buy the new flagships so that 'no one gets left behind.' Need i remind everyone of the slavery to manufacture their products back in the day??... HMM  There are smaller scale youtubers who have compared these in more depth than you. Please stop making biased content like this. It was disappointing to watch.
In display and photography s22 ultra wins anyday
Hi
gaming phones are the best phones period. Apple are behind the tech curve also they don't even come with a charger and that's just unacceptable. Asus ROG phones are my recommendation for a phone in 2022 onwards because they have the best specs.
I'm very much an Android fan. I love to customize the crap out of my phone: wallpaper engine, custom icons, sounds and notifications etc. Plus the ability to download whatever app I want, homebrew stuff or emulators. Iphone just doesn't compare in my experience and for my needs.
Surprised that these consider SAMSUNG DEX useless, it is such a cool feature. Everytime I use DEX I am happy.😃
I’ve owned both. I recently returned my Z Fold 4 for the I Phone 13 Pro Max and I’m more than happy with my decision. I hated the android interface and thought it was very sloppy.
Saw this video..couldn't disagree more...the s22 ultra line and the new fold blow the dinosaur I phone out of the water...  ant take mkbhd seriously at all ..obviously iphone bias
I think its Versatility vs Stability,  An Iphone will always work and be simple to understand,  An android will require some tinkering but tinkered correctly can be anything you want or need
iphone is a joke comparing to great design a true class galaxy ultra. Iphone here is looking like cheap xiaomi or poco. Just look at the huuuge bezels on iphone, who wants that.
This came late, but loved the collab! Hope both of you can do it again sometimes soon. 😄
As someone who works in technology. Android wins until an iPhone can see infrared flashes from a remote control. All Androids since the very first Motorola droid can see the flashes of a remote control through its camera.  It's a tool I cannot live without. Easiest way to check if a remote control is working
pricing includes resale value and iPhone wins hands down
im glad i own a iphone 17 Minus Negative
THIS GUY IS SO BIASED WITH IPHONES. IN EVERY ASPECT ANDROID BEATS IPHONE BUT NO...
For me IOS is simpler and user friendly to most but I don't like the ecosystem lock in. I use Android because it's compatible to most programs and in my country there are more Android users.
The guy on the right is complete on iPhone side😂
Android for life!!!
Look at all these nerds talk abt there phones ⬇️⬇️   (I didn’t mean that in a mean way)    Also me:  Samsung has good customisation but overall for me iPhone is better if only iPhone had more RAM
I blindly pick Samsung s22ultra over crap iPhone
@me being a nokia3 user😶(thinking i have the best camera 🤳)
Haha... I've had my photos and videos not save on the iPhone 13 Pro MAX many times. Especially if storage optimization is on so that it offloads to iCloud.  For example,  I flew business class for the first time with Qatar airways so I wanted to take a lot of photos and videos to commemorate. iPut the iPhone in flight mode and started taking photos and videos of everything and then when I looked in the gallrey app that about half of my photos and videos were not saved or just black. Fun times.
Android is hacking phones at will and disableing phones. It may do the same with chrome books. I have complained it to acer, xiaomi and hp support. Kindly make mankind aware about android coronavirus destroying mobiles and laptops at will.
I have numerous bad experiences with android phones and once I switch to iphone and never look back. I understand android has been improved over the years but eventually the problems that I face was still persists.
Mk is such an apple fanboi. Everything was in favor of iphone. Ever picture I take with my s10+ people tell me is better than their iPhone. Customization android wins hands down. Charging android wins. Customer choice android wins. And FaceTime and air drop has Google alternatives.
The most opinion-based fight on the internet, and even then it mainly boils down to which os you like to use.
In iPhone after 2 year battery health is 85 some like.. but Android 7 to 10 year last longer the boss is Android... But looser say iPhone is best
S 22 ultras beat iPhone ever in all that things ...play game and see the result. Take photos
Big win for android is that they are still affordable when they are offering features no less than Iphone. Whereas Apple is charging more price for Iphones which is not cost effective. High prices of Iphones are not justified. According to my opinion, Iphones are simply overpriced.
This was a very biased video
I think both operating systems have a lot of great things going for them. I think we’re at a stage where it is quite hard to put these two systems side by side and ultimately say that one is better, and it is more so a question about what the user is looking for.  I think the general consensus is it boils down to whether the user wants unparalleled reliability and ease of use versus flexibility and being completely in control of the phone. Apple products are a great choice if you just want everything to work reliably while putting in minimal effort, while android caters for those who are willing to put in a bit of extra work to push their phones to their true potential.
Biased af.
I wonder how it feels for Mr Brownlee to be interviewed this time lol  It's amazing that you two got the chance to colab though. However, was there a time where both smart minded individuals such as yourselves got to a point where you strongly disagreed with each other to the point where you could feel yourselves brewing an argument?  Because two smart people don't generally get along. Kudos for this video though, Greatly appreciated.
How does Android vs iPhone make sense then you segment Samsung separately? Shouldn't it be Samsung vs iPhone or Android vs ios?
Straight up apple fan boys..   🤣🤣🤣... ofcourse.  Everything is going to be apple...😅
I don’t know. I feel like my iPhone 12 battery charges fast.
When it regards to photography you never mentioned sony Xperia. I think sony has best photography.
Personally I don't think either is comparable. Android phones have such an incredibly large market that you can pretty much google an android with any feature and you'd probably find it. The fact that you can (technically) build your own android phone makes it extremely hard to beat in most ways. There are probably android phones that use gaming laptop equipment that we just don't know about because a consumer put them together.
Should have names this video "iPhone fan thinks iPhone is best phone"
Oh u wanna play Fortnite, forget about that ... U want sideload apps forget about that,
That moment when you can only understand an operating system designed for 5 year olds
I love my s22 ultra and i know this is about phones but can my ipad pro get a calculator 😒😒😒 2 thousand dollars and no calculator
When receiving an email with iPhone, try to save an attachment and attach it to another mail that you're sending out. So much better with android.
let us hear from Korean and Asian people what is their view then we can judge
I strongly disagree with the ratings but oh well
I think it depends. In Asia, most people depend on network operator, not wifi. So, they have more than one number. That's why android with dual SIM or more, are more favorable. And, iphone can not compete with this.
Airdrop doesn’t work most of the times !!!
Samsang is beter gaknat
no critique jus think its funny that you talk about marques using a year old phone and that you describe it as a WHOLE YEAR and that you think its crazy while i just got iphone x and think its so new
Not me using this as a resouce for my class debate 💩
To take photos and video it would be Sony experia
A thing that you not considered in the eco section is, that iphone repairs are more expensive and therefore would lead a consumer more to the decision of buying a new one instead of paying an equal amount for the repair. Android phones on the other hand are relatively cheap to repair, as there are a lot of third party repair-shops that can do the repairing for a lot cheaper. Also i think you should consider the Fairphone, because you are comparing the peak of eco consciousness from iphone with a middle ground from android. Android can be in fact more eco consciouss but you limit the range in favour for IPhone.   And I'm not really an Android Fan and I even consider switching to IPhone (but money for the hole ecosystem is lacking xD)
If you compare iphone to Android, you should take into account thousands of phones. This means that since iPhones have many drawbacks, you could almost always find an Android phone that give a better value for Monday for a specific user preference. Just summing winning points without weighing them to a specific user preferences doesn't make sense. And indeed the result is absurd. Iphone gets an overwhelming win while in reality it's android who is winning.
Lmao his point about lock screen widgets 🤣🤣 saying it would be harder for his mom to add widgets on android 😂🤦🏻 how is that a legit point wth
U can buy 2 phones for the price of one iPhone, so u will have software support for 6 years. 😂😂
So biased.
iPhone is better. Didn’t need a video to confirm it but thanks man! Good stuff
🚫 A very biased review... It actually disappointing to see  MKBHD's opinion dominate Aaron's views, even when Aaron had very strong points, he just held back and was so eager to surrender. I had to skip to the end and was displeased
Ok so basically 2 guys comparing iOS iPhone 13 to all other high end and low end Android while holding an s22 and not even comparing it to the same class
bro i just got a mrwhosetheboss ad
How much did apple pay for this ad?
bruh this mkbhd is applebot we all know s22 ultra beats 13pm at photos and 13pm beats s22 ultra at videos he still supports 13pm for photos what a bot
Clearly an iphone fan
Androids fans are crying 🤣🤣
With lightning port you can charge your iphone under water, but with type c you can't.
iPhone's better because not all of the android users use features offered as options by android. And iPhones now have the greater battery life vs any (if not most) android phone.
Why is everything where Android is better ending up in a draw?
I'm switching to the 13PM. Ordered one today. Tired of the poor S22U battery life and instabilities.
If android is able to build a messaging platform that can send UHD videos, game over.
So through my experience, iPhone has had a bit more stability and better performance. However android has better flexibility, help of the community, and a lot more phone choices for the particular user. And I've also seen apple hoard money
This is completely biased lmao
I’m an iPhone fan because I just like the design and it has a a nice texture.
33k fanboys didn't get their way 😂
MKBHD is known for having an iphone bias in everything, he generally lets iphone off the hook amd puts it on the same level as an android even when its underperforming
When they were talking about battery life, I had a flashback to tge HTC Thunderbolt. That thing horrible for battery.
Sorry, but at least one of these 2 reviewers was totally iPhone biased. One thing is saying that the iPhone performs well on a certain topic, but giving it a tie or a win on an obvious underperforming factor it is simply a personal preference not an honest opinion. For that I stopped watching halfway on the video. Sorry, I'll use my time watching other good and "transparent" videos from you. Cheers!
i think the ram really makes the android outstanding, most computers stock only have 6gb of ram and can't run games like Modern Warfare.
Alot of people view iphone as rich guy status   But for me I would never buy iphone even tho I have enough money for it   The looks and the way samsung operates is just so much better for me that I would stay on that
Simple answer:  IOS is better for the general public  Android is better for tech people and developers
apple shills lawl
All phones are not eco friendly because they contain circuits. It's theorized basalt columns are petrified silicon trees that were chopped down to harvest the silicon to use for technology. The documentary is called What on Earth Happened. I can share the link if anyone is interested. Just ditch the term "Conspiracy theory" if you are going to watch it.
The name of the video shouldn't be which one is better, it should be this dude's opinion on what's better. Most americans think iphones are better because they have a weird stockholm syndrom loyalty type shit towards apple which i think is stupid.
Android cuz yes
I use multy window all the time!
Don't buy Mi phones i bought MI 11x . It's the worst software experience
Hmmmm Marques says iOS is better but he actually uses a pixel phone which is android😼
Marques just sounds like an apple fan boy. 6GB of RAM is obviously less than anything a decent android phone is offering. Android is the clear winner. There is nothing like feeling when it comes to hardware. Android just gives more hardware for your buck.
get whatever you like
I think you guys were really partial towards an iPhone. When an iPhone couldn’t catch in some areas you conveniently steered it in the direction of what one really wants and called it a draw. I love both you guys but this was definitely the worst comparison video I’ve seen. Hope you take it positively 👍🏻
Title is confusing. It should be Iphone vs Samsung s22 not android. samsung s22 isnt even the best phone at a price range around the same as Iphone
You sound so much like a delusional apple fan boy Arun. IPhone users are nothing but blind pretentious people who just use a technologically ill equipped phone which is simply dull boring and has features no one cares about in terms of practicality. Ios is stupid, less user friendly and just downright bland. Your views are biased and not based on practicality.
I could make this video in 5 seconds.... Android is better,. Please hit thumbs up and subscribe. 😁
I think Apple vs Android then Apple easily wins. Apple vs Samsung flagship phones is pretty even.
my samsung a53's batterie life lasts longer than the iphone 13, depending on what u use it for
I can sensed that Arun is really into Android but he respected the other guy's (MKBHD's) opinion more than his own in kinda lowkey way.
The guest is so polite and calm
Great comparison its all up to personal preference
Ios won Eco system💀💀 how?? They have their own of everything you can't use a apple charger on another iPhone sometiems even the brick is iPhone exclusive you can't watch the video with a straight face also there was a couple of other factors that could have been a tiekr where android was better
Ios won Eco system💀💀 how?? They have their own of everything you can't use a apple charger on another iPhone sometiems even the brick is iPhone exclusive you can't watch the video with a straight face
You’re missing a major category called accessibility. How would a blind person use their smart phone? How would a person with fine motor skills use their smart phone? How would a low vision person use their smart phone?
MKBHD is literally a bottom for Apple it’s boring
samsung knox & secure folder is useful to me.  I like that I can play apps through different bluetooth audio devices
Load of android users on saying oh iPhone is so restricted but in reality all they use their androids for is YouTube,fb and instagram🤣🤣🤣
20:24
nothing like seeing a fanboy grin every time his toy scores a point. good neutral investigative reporting here.
Android is way better due to bigger battery also it has more RAM and the display runs at 120hz plus in my case my phone charges in 20 min and it can last all day..In my opinion Iphone sucks tbh nothing new
The biggest thing for me, in terms of apple features. Is the mail forwarding. Where I don’t have to give companies my real email. Plus the biggest thing also is the one time password coming up on top of the keyboard. That’s unbeatable for me.
The vibration on the s22 ultra is actually the worst I've ever seen in a phone. It's non existence. It's not a hot take bruh...the iPhone widget is so much better.
I MYSELF LOVE BOTH I WANT ONE PHONE FROM EACH BRAND
iPhone pros:  highly optimised, great industrial design, easy to use, along with numerous   accessories of choice   Android pros: High flexibility, customisation and features, as well as numerous variety of phones  iPhones cons: tight control with limited customisation  Android cons: bloatware, tendency for horrendous gimmicks, poorer optimisation
Are you actually stupid? You are comparing Samsung and IPhone. Android is an OS and should just be compared to IOS.
I use both and each has its pros and cons. Android offers a greater degree of customization and more freedom in connections, on the other hand iOS, due to its limitations, is easier and more straightforward for the average user. Most of the time android becomes chaotic with to many settings and is the reason I end up taking the iPhone with me most of the time.
I like watching you reviews... but to be honest S22 ultra is a totally better phone than the iPhone 13 pro max!!!
Best example of super biased video 😁😁
I harshly disagree with this video it was clearly biased. please make a FAIR video.
I kind of disagree here. the battery category given usb-c, fast charging, and reverse wireless charging makes it pretty categorically for android. Iphone actually only has good standby time, for heavy usage (which drains all phones) You want to drain it all. My mom's iphone 12 after multitasking with productivity and emails on a facetime call drains a lot. Then waiting for it to charge is a pain. My galaxy s9 (a much older phone) doesn't have that problem.   Beyond that features I think goes to android flat out. Android has miracast and wifi direct which are just as good as the iphone ones. Iphone features also have very poor (or no) compatibility outside of the ecosystem. Not to mention  customization  is way more developed on android (launchers, widgets, and themes are way more customizable).   also performance is a little nuanced because the RAM 100% helps out. Especially if you value 'extensibility'. Many areas of iphone performance just don't pop up because everything is so locked down. Also network and wireless performance was not gone into, and overall I've been more impressed with my samsung (except for GPS which is better on iphone).   I think overall the Iphone still wins, but my god these seem like glaring oversights with two of my favorite techtubers. It would be great to get a revisit of this comparison another time. It seems a lot more to focus on perceived 'core' categories which don't capture why people pick the phones they do. (I mean even in 'value' resale and brand perception could be a reason ppl go with iphone).   I'm no fanboy of either, as I've had both and enjoyed both. But my next phone probably will be an android at this point (unless maybe they release the 14 mini).
Today's episode of Sesame Street is sponsored by the letter "A"
I appreciate the iPhone, but I honestly stay on Android for so long because it's definitely more affordable. Phones can be cheaper, repairs are cheap as well, spare parts aren't that expensive. I think taking into account also Play store vs App store, since App store stuff is generally more expensive is a thing. ALSO. Very important is compatibility - people with an Apple setup can be more comfortable with an iPhone, but PC users.. can't really use all the perks of iPhones unless they get such a setup. Which is.. much more costly. So yeah, I think those are aspects that didn't get touched on much.
The black guy is paid IPhone 📱 advertiser...🙄
Android 13 pro ultra
while android come in different designs, iphones come n bigger cameras
iPhone is superior clearly
What is not mentioned here are the features that you cannot compare because they are unique to certain phones and thus bringing an advantage.  For example, the Pixel phones have Live Captions, Quick Tap, Voice Typing, Call Screen, Hold for Me, Face Unblur and other that are not available in any other phone.
Seriously! apple is getting on environmental section! They go out of their way to block repairs.
So we just completely forget about side loading
I love both guys content, but you can plainly see they aren't entirely neutral and have their biases. It's hard nowadays to truly be free of bias towards a certain product in this case cell phones.
samsung is winner
I would like to know about repearability
I prefer  android... and I hate iPhone
You are crazy off iPhone...and you reduce the good options in android...
i felt like this comparison is abit bias because of personal thought and not the real detail info
USB type C, playstore has utorrent, emulators and aethersx2, gaming phones have triggers and active cooling, customization all make Android better than iOS.
LOL! A total Apple ad if I have ever seen one. A notch out of something like 2017 and let's not forget that stupid Lighting Cable that they should have thrown in the bin years ago! Whatever shit you are smoking can I please have some LOL!
I know you have never tested the display for responsiveness, because iPhone displays are horrendous next to Samsung's.  You can wear the thickest beefiest winter gloves and a Samsung will register your finger with increased touch sensetivity turned on.  With an iphone though, if the thinnest gloves are on your hand it is a brick.  Also, when tapping on something small I've seen how inaccurate the iPhone is and have found you have to tap slightly under it where Samsung it has never been a problem.  If you copy/ paste things a lot split screen is great which you just brushed aside.  Also, where is pro mode on an iPhone's camera and why can you only take a panorama in one direction/orientation?  This is rigged by an Apple fanboy and why I stopped half way through.  Not watching a skewed comparison.
It felt like they were stuck on the iPhone. Not much of a comparison, just a feature show.
In some of your videos, it seems like you are trying to praise Apple and belittle Android.  You should understand one thing that Apple has its own characteristics and Android has its own characteristics.  So please don't do that👍
😂 😆
Are you angry with Samsung?
Android is good at innovating while apple is good at optimizing no need to compare them they need competition to make better phones
The reason i would never boy an iphone is i would be very bored. In my android phone, I like to customise a lot. Install a custom ROM any time. That's a game changer for me.
7:18 that has never happened to me .
Oh snap it's on
Iphone will never reach samsung freedom, if i'm paying for a powerful device, i want to use for different things. and iphone blocks me from that. so iphone is garbage for me.
Accurate
I feel like this video is so bias.
wow Marques is so biased
Everyone pouting about Apple  being the clear winner, get over it 😆 . It’s just an opinion!! But Apple is better than Android!! Don’t get it twisted!
helo sir please gifted me one samsung s22 ultra please sir
Sponsored by Apple.
everyone knows android is more ahead of ipone.  but yet again , they still choose iphone is much stronger. bias on this one.
TEAM Android it has more data it has more useful updates every month and it even has that Citra Rom you all heard of it right it is a game changer for the play store Yeah i’m getting an android on my bDay  Boi
Sorry. Team Samsung here!
The guy is an iPhone fan, I don't agree with the ratings
MKBHD is a die hard fan of iphone so hence I don't trust his reviews when it comes to Android Vs Iphone 🚮
ok, this was definitely not biased
android rules
its gotten pretty deep in bull with your comment of eco friendly !! real deep in fanboy bull ! apple does not let you fix your own phone . this a a fanboy worship lie !! apple sucks arse !
I think andriod win
I like android bcoz . It allow third party app.
I've had both companies and I currently have the S22 Ultra and my wife likes apple. She has the pro max 13 maybe it's  me but it's no comparison Samsung S22 Ultra not any of the other one just the Ultra is leaps & bounds better the the Apple.
There are some other features available in android like the fingerprint scanner which is very useful at least for me. The availability of certain apps in play store which are not present in the other side. I think for me right now android is better pick.
I need samsung dex!
photography shouldve gone to android imo. but you do you
Honestly right I'm an Android user right, but I am not gonna say Apple is bad, it's great, an incredible phone, good power, nice software, very clean, all of that, the only thing reason why I use Android is for the customization, and the convenience of USB-C. Jailbreaking an iPhome is the hardest thing to do now, and also like I said USB-C, I can use any charging cable for any phone.
Apple is paying that brother lol
Love the channel, but i dont like this comparasion
free tv on samsung
There's no denying that iPhones are more power and performance efficient, but as someone who wants as much functionality as possible from a phone, Android is the hands-down winner.  So many simple, everyday tasks (e.g. file management) are made more difficult in iOS compared to Android. iPhones are restrictive and difficult to customize - even widgets took years to land on iPhones but have been present on Android pretty much since it's inception.
Too biased,  both are just looking on how to put iPhone on a better light.  Where they find iPhone is lacking then they will choose a lower level android phone to compare with to make iPhone win😂
Android phones always! only had an iPhone for a short while but sold it off for dead cheap as I couldn't live with it......
Marcos . Is a Apple Fan. End  Game
Why is it that most iPhones like X series hv a habit of the camera Shaking when recording zooming and taking pics with the Rear camera but not in Portrait mode
tldr: the one that cost less, cuz they all the same
This needs to be a video with iPhone Vs Samsung or something more specific. I use BOTH phones for work. The newest IPhone and the Newest Samsung and I promise u, I prefer my Samsung.  For many different reasons.
Pure bias
Keep crying lagdroid fan. Top phone experts that used both android and iphone extensively agreed that iphone is much better.
MKBHD is one-sided to IPhone
I started out with the original iPhone loved it went up to the iPhone 4s then went to android until last year when I went back to iPhone for me the iPhone feels way more premium then android and overall I like it better….if you into a bunch of things you’re not going to use then yes android has all that but for me I’m sticking with iPhone
There is a setting on android where you can choose if u want it to be fast charging then it takes around 2 hours from 0% - 100% if you choose to just do it normally (no fast charging) then it takes 6,30 - 7 hours.
Marques is one unbiased reviewer Love to hear from him.
Sick of the vivo ad.
My mobile Samsung not20ultra display green line problem please sir 1video Samsung green line issue
The way I see it is, an Android phone is your phone but an iPhone is Apple's phone.
Iphone(America), Android (The World), iPhone (Capitalistic, efficient, mostly marketing) Android  Trying to please too many people, The EU too many vendors to many distractions.  Iphone ( Ferrari) Android (Any other car)
The fact that an iphone is being compared to a gang of phones just shows how GOATED it actually is.
I still remeber saving $100s because I found an android app that had every Texas instrument calculator ever made. Got me through high school and college. I just enjoy the freedom of the platform rather than everything being bottlenecked around the parent company.
I wouldn't ever own an Apple product even if they gave me a gold plated one for free! I'd immediately trade it for something from a company I actually have respect for!
This is so biased. Android is so much more advanced, and any time an Android wins you just call it a tie.
I can’t believe how far have we come to accept 1000 - 1500 dollars smartphones, and yet we get rampant for laptops in the same price point, much much powerful being hatred for costing that same  amount, it’s quite illogical if you ask me. I know, I know different devices for different tasks, even so i find it nonsense. Nada
Since I use Macs and iPads, it just makes sense for me to use iPhone. I had Android for years and I loved it, but honestly the iPhone lately is a lot like Android now. The files app, widgets, Picture in Picture, etc. it’s getting way closer to Android.
Bro Asus rog 5 ultimate >>>>>>> every iphone
CO2 does not hurt the planet..  it is a indicator or warming..  Apple is hell no based on slave labor..    duh.
ironic..  every time i hear someones pised at their phones..  its an IPhone.  and Iphones are only 20% of the market.   i  IT  all my Phone tech issues are Apple issues.  not andriod.
I noticed that the most popular devices are the best. iPhones for phones, Windows computers for PCs, Toyotas for cars.
wow an apple fun took the android part lol
Apple lacks in every area. Its actually embarrassing.
To save time: obviously android.
I think it would be great to do a similar video but asking in a poll why users prefer one over the other and choosing like for example one of the comments took into consideration usb type C wich I think is a great addition.
I've always hated the curve because it messes with touch targets on the edge of the screen.
Didn't give any score to android for Google assistant.
Nice calves bro!
I have been an Android user for 10 plus years and especially with Samsung devices the OS system has drastically improved. I went from a Galaxy s10e to the s22 ultra when it came out and it seems like it took a few updates to really get the full potential from the new chip. I would get the occasional hiccups but I might be able to reason that the covid pandemic kind of slow development down just like it has with a lot of other things but other than that seems like my phone is getting better and better with each monthly update.
Guys I have a Samsung M53 and a iPhone 12 I used to charge iPhone atleast 4-5times to one Samsung charge . Samsung batteries last really really long. And the camera is also not so much a big difference considering iPhone 12 costs atleast 2times more than M53 and It have a big 120hz display. And per given cost Android phones are best.
You know why I stopped following MKBHD. Because he is not fair when it comes to Android, he always seems biased to Apple. I feel like he is advertising Apple's products in a smart way.
iPhone's spare parts are not interchangeable, you cannot fix an iPhone yourself or in a regular service, so many of them just go straight to waste - they are counter-friendly to the environment (and to technical skills development, too).
Marwho brownee is the biggest apple sucker like honestly.
Apple is the absolute worst for the environment.. You know how many phones and tablets from Apple end up in the trash because they get bricked because somebody forgot their password?? Hundreds of thousands if not millions.
OK...so, I had a XS Max that was great, I loved it and it worked perfectly. For some stupid reason,  I "upgraded" to an iPhone 13. Worst mistake ever. The 13 was terrible. I would be playing a game, get a text, go to iMessage to answer the text and when going back to my game, the app would have to restart and I would loose my progress. Now, this happened every single time I had more than two apps open (and frequently with only two apps open). Any time I left the house, the phone was useless,  unless i manually turned off WiFi. Its like the phone didn't automatically know to switch to data when away from home. Problem was, I would forget to flip WiFi back on once at home and watch hours of YouTube or whatever, all on data. The whole performance of the 13 was horrendous. So, a few weeks ago I sold the 13 and got a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus. Not a single issue or restart, even with 5 or 6 apps open. No data issues,  nothing. Not. ONE. This phone (from 2019) out preforms the 13 by leaps and bounds. I'm going to stick with Android,  at least until Apple does something interesting. Then MAYBE I'll think about using an iPhone again. But, I don't know,  because I'm really getting spoiled on all the features and customization. LOL!
I regret liking apple. The storage is to low
Funny how so many androids players are mad in the comments
But Sony?
Was a Samsung user all my life. decıded to get the iPhone 13 Pro. It was the best decision i ever made.
iPhone for life 😍🥰😘
Of course they gave Iphone the win. Marques Brownlee dick rides Iphone alot, this rating was useless. Very biased.
I really love iphone series with long last battery. However, I'm a wonman and my hands are so small, I feel so heavy and uncomfortable when I hold the iphone pro max for a long time. I hope Apple will launch the iphone with the size 6.1 inches bonus the amazing battery in the future (maybe iphone 14 pro or 15 pro). I'm a big fan of Apple.
Usaing the samsing to rep all of android isnt fair considering android is much more widespread and has a wider spread of features than what just samsung offers. Android is a os and it should be compared against ios. This specific video should be called s22 ultra vs iphone 13 pro
2:28 until apple throttles your cpu Lol
I would have appreciated the app comparison, i like books app on IOS, but i love the personalization options on Android. The reasons i want to move to iOS is the years of upgrade time and iBooks. Honestly,  i still can't decide.
Tell me your an apple fanboy without saying your iphone fanboy.
This doesn't feel like a android vs iphone video Its just a iphones features video like  You forgot soo many features android has
iPhone fan boys... How can somebody who undersand about tech say, iPhone is better then androids looool. Androids have better specs, cameras, batterys, screens, value, less expansive, almost no bugs at all, better custumazation, waranty its way better, androids are fixeble and so on. For dont mention the fact, most androids have type C, and  headphones and charger in the box! Stop been liers to peple.
No use talking to an apple fanboy. Try finding someone neutral
Mkbhd is paid out the ass by apple to give all those points to apply it's just sad and damages his already failing credibility for me...and no if you're concerned about the planet and recycling. You don't buy an iPhone, iPhones are  the only things that brick themselves if you don't sign out of them properly making them effectively useless so you cannot buy a refurbished one or a used one. It just goes to waste making their recycling irrelevant
What was that phone case mkbhd had? It was showing charging indicator!!!
hahahahahaha, this video is so biased towards ios
iPhone's advantages are offset by the simple fact that Apple deliberately treats their customers like children like Nintendo does. Android is be better because it's open source and isn't obsessed with starting a cult like Apple is. There's too many limitations with iPhone to make me switch back.
For someone who isn't big on tech I would say iPhone but if someone is semi big into tech then I would say android because iPhone is a good all rounder but a different Samsung is good for different people a gamer would get a gaming phone etc
This mf was biased asf. Not a fair review
you can play minecraft java on android
This video is pretty biased ngl because of the apple ecosystem. Apple is a great phone but Samsung is very underrated and is more unique. Android had many other things Thata make it better that you could have included instead of neglecting. Great video by both of you.👏🏽
what a silly video doing a  comparison just base on opinions LOL
Let's be real. If you don't casually have 1500$ to spend on a "reliable" iPhone, Android phones especially Samsung's A line is the way to go for most people. If you get an iPhone for 1000$ and a Samsung for 1000$ Samsung outperforms in every little way.
I was a dedicated iPhone user that joined the resistance and switched  to being a dual user. The fun isn’t there anymore with Apple, it’s plain boring. There is nothing more exciting than being locked into an ecosystem that chooses subscriptions rather than innovation. Meanwhile I looked at Samsung and it’s Galaxy S/fold/flip line and jumped ship. The only things that bothers me about switching is the keyboard, CarPlay and a few apps that I can no longer use like (Apollo, Book Track & Deliveries by JuneCloud).
Not a fair comparison. Why not compare an android phone which is the same or very close to the price of the iPhone they use for comparison?
this uk guy is too fruity
When i watched the video and surfed through some of the comments i am of the same opinion that there seems to be some kind of bias with IOS / IPHONE. Did not like this video much 😵
Damn all the AnDrOiD USERS are pissed🤣
Nothing bt biased. Secondly, they themselve r not clear whether comparing android vs iphone or is it Samsung S22 ultra vs iphone 13 pro max. I wish having millions of subs. Gave you the clarity of thoughts before making a video.
I find iOS really complicated and confusing. I really don't like it.
Clearly he is fanboy of IOS. Poor creature.
Been using Android for 6 months for the first time ever. I find the user open customisation and experience better than propriety IOS.
This whole video is one sided
First time watching biased video. 👎 I would definitely go for S22 Ultra.
This felt so biased. They left out so many features that Android have that iphones do not have which makes Android the winner in many areas. Don't really care for the finale results as I have tried both, and can say that Android is so much better in terms of customization, features etc.
Just buy both
IPhone  yaxshi  barbir
The Marcus guy is so biased like they only focused on the strong points of apple
iphone is the smoothest period
IPhone is not ECO-Friendly. If repair costs nearly as much as a new device, user is tempted just to buy a new phone.
This feels like an ad for iPhone... And I've used both.
iMKBHD
The points shouldn't have the same amount of value as some features should count more as than other features that nobody uses...
Fandroids: ”This comparsion is paid by Apple. Display, battery, camera and reliability don’t matter. Usb-c is more important” 😂
In terms of Eco conscious you both forgot a fundamental thing. Apple has an even bigger lead if you factor in a products lifecycle. Apple’s is greater by offering up to six years of core software updates. That is not the case in the Android with some companies only offering two years! Forcing you to replace your handset more often which is less sustainable
Mkbhd was so bias!!!! That's why I like Mrwhostheboss he's non bias.  Even with the cameras Mrwhostheboss was like how about vivo, Samsung and Google. And My vivo x60pro and Vivo X80PRO never failed me yet and definitely takes better  photos than IPHONE. Even the X80PRO takes better video than IPHONE also.
Iphone 2.5  Android 7.5
Isn't this somewhat only for people with huge money? Comparisons between iphone 13 pro max and s22 ultra on behalf of ios and android. Other devices use which software?
bossy
Samsung
How about free music, finger print reader.
iphone
I'm biased but I been team Android since the Nexus days
I’m sorry but this was the worst video you have ever done 🙁
I use an iPhone but man this video was biased af towards apple... shame.
And today Apple security flaw ‘actively exploited’ by hackers to fully control devices. love my s22 Ultra :P
Air drop is just bluetooth transfer, Droid does more in less OS's. Any real Tech will not use Apple.
Why nobody mentioned Xiaomi for photos?
It looks like a fixed video for 🍏🍎
Common apple w
MKBHD is just an iphone fanboy fr
Android is more costomise and cheap with a decent function where in apple you will get a big notch Android will give you a lovely display while watching the videos and playing games.
Got one brand new Asus Zenfone 9 from MyWorldPhone.
I need a black and chrome iPhone
As someone who has both. I prefer my android due to how much more freedom I have on it. Extra features are completely locked unless it's on the appstore or have access to a testflight group. As someone who also develops apps for both phones, iOS is such a pain to develop for and requires a mac for xcode, while android can freely be developed by any computer OS. The only advantage that affects me with an iphone, is it's true depth camera. Allowing pretty good facial motion capture for prototyping and small projects. Also apple really need to get rid of their cables and go for usb C.
Did they just say a iPhone battery is better than a android💀
All these phones do the same thing and cost as much as a person's rent car note
Best review I’ve ever seen 🙏 keep up the good work, your duo is awesome 👏👏👏👏
Whatever the video output is Android is the best
Bro assistant goes full to android
Asking American guy about american product. Naturally, he will be on USA side. They are bread an raised to think that way. America above everything else.
I am with mkbhd , using the same phone as him S21U rn and I love that I used Iphone13 pro before that and i counldnt stand that the fact how much apple restrict me to use my phone simply and i couldnt even do a simple task very easily like setting cusyom ringtone  I felt so inulted by ios and then i switched back to S21U. It has been two weeks with it and I absolutely love it. Especially gaming experience which i couldnt get on iphone , like significantly lowering mu game sound when i use discord in ios but np such error in samsung now. My friends say they dont even hear my game sounds on their discord even i play games with high volume. It os so nice of Samsung
This is the dumbest argument ever!!! And it always has been!!! And honestly I like both of the reviewers but for anyone to engage in this type of debate or argument and doesn't recognize right off the bat that there is no argument because the two cannot be compared they're just idiots!!! Okay so what do I mean?. Well quite frankly and simply put their two totally different devices. Yes they do perform many of the same functions and they do do it in the same way a lot of times as each other. But this is monumentally the reason that they can't be comparative because if you understand how a user interface is built then you would know exactly why they can't be compared. See this whole argument about Apple being faster than Android and blah blah blah is a stupid argument. Apple is built in a closed ecosystem so that literally means that no third parties make any of the fundamental software that goes into the operating system and user interface directly unless it comes from Apple. Now with this allows Apple to do is this allows Apple to bake certain applications directly into the software. So what does that mean bake it into the software? well that means that when your finger touches the screen to open on an iphone that command goes to the interface then straight to the app and back to the screen .. in a basic way!! So for simplicity three easy steps ,UI to app and back to UI .. simple .. no for the reason why these two can't be compared let's see what Android does. On an Android u touch the screen/UI, then it goes to the OS which is Linux then opens the  virtual machine android . Android has to find and has to open the app and then do it all in reverse to get the info to the screen. Many many more steps to open any app on an Android then an iPhone. Facts .  And also a fact is that its still close and in many places faster and smoother.  Google messenger can do all the stuff iMessage can .. and cameras are more opinion than fact . I have an s22 ultra and I got a nice 110 zoom super clear image of  the moon ?
Android vs ios huh. Funny comparison, ios lose. End of story.
Can you talk about Asus Rog Phone 6?
They forgot something that's making me have a hard time choosing, the magic eraser in the pixel, I have multiple pix where I need the magic eraser to remove people from the pic
Biased much?
To be fair the camera category was an easy win for Android devices due to the higher end capabilities, Battery isnt just about oh my battery last X hours. Iphones require a very specific cable and typically cost more for said csbles. The androids use a Type C connector which nesrly everyone has one, vs a lightning connector will only be available to those with an Iphone. Charging speed for androids is way better. Could keep going on.  The video started off with displays being close but was said for samsung having a better display over all but het it splits points? The camera was based on opinion(As did the flat vs curve debate). Much of the "is something better on android vs Iphone" was which do I prefer. Performance simply isnt about a score or game performance. Multi tasking is used by so many people. Also forgetting to talk about the versatility of a samsung device and the ability to use dex, usb accessories, etc is something that can be in regards to performance. I liked the premise of the video but it was 100% which phone/feature does mkbhd prefer in my opinion.   And honestly software support sucks in both ends. Apple has struggled quite a bit with the entire ios 15.x.x line. It has been full of bugs, vulnerabilities, etc. There is a simple bug where to factory reset your phone it asks for your apple ID password. When you go to hit turn off to reset the phone you end up in a cycle where you have to hit return on the keyboard upwards of several minutes straight to be able to wipe the phone. And samsung has had its fair share too, but Smart switch makes setting up a phone so much easier so it makes my life easier at work when somone buys a phone and I have to setup. Dealing with both daily, I can tell you I see 10-20 people having issues with their iphones to every Samsung device having an issue. Thats something not one person that buys iphones regularly will talk about. They will come in complaining about apple, their phone slowing down, battery life being crappy, all on a 1 year old to 2 year old phone. Yes that means the 12s and 13s are already having people complain. Yet they will only buy another iphone and not try another manufacturer.
Iphone has a much better cleaner UI. Admit it or not, plus the incredible camera
Oh the age old debate 😂
I kinda feel like you missed categories and added one unnecesarily: why eco-friendliness? That's not even a feature. How about freedom? How about app availability? How about compatibility? How about development oportunities? I feel like the category choice for the video just gives apple an advantage because they all revolve around reliablility, in which apple is just better. But apple sacrifices a lot for its reliablility.
IMO, iPhone wins this type of comparison because of HOW it wins each category. iPhone is undeniably better in a few ways, whereas the ways android wins are more subjective (or just may not matter for many people). Obviously one phone isn't best for everyone, but when trying to answer the question generally, I think this is the best way to think about it.
NFC pairing is not a niche feature.
when 2 apple fan boys compare ios vs android
Android: 🗿
iPhone 📱 or Samsung are both good phones idk
Interesting the way you chose to weight each of the categories.   So many cases I disagree. Every year I try to go back to iPhone but end up returning it.  I want to love it but…
I can get decent android devices under $250. Talk to me when I phone can do that...
Value should go to iPhone. After using the phone for a couple years you can resell it to a ridiculously high price, making the “actual cost” way lower than the upfront cost.
I have a iPhone and a Samsung  22  Apple  sucks
Talking about eco-consciousness when it comes to flagship phones in this extreme consumer society is pretty fucking ironic.
Quite visible that this is a paid video.
Both of them are paid by Apple to provide biased reviews
It basically boils down to, Iphone has the best screen: S22 is outlier. Has best camera :Pixel is outlier, best Gaming: ROG is outlier, best eco consciousness:Fairphone is outlier. Well that's the point of variety you can pick and choose what you want
Galaxy is the king
There is a hige difference between android and iphone... The competition has to be within ios and android. sony mobile phones seemingly has great camera... samsung delivers screens to iphone so this is  not  a healthy competition.
Poda poore neeyokke I phoning moody thaqngi pidich nadannoii
This is just one sided🙄
well as a ph seller using Shopee, iphone cant do heavy app like Shopee it's so slow with iphone 13 then i changed with 13pro max, still the same, apps load longer than s22 ultra. but the apple ecosystem is great tho. still better to keep both phones tho ~
Android for me because of customisation and youtube vance and youtube music without any ads.
Battery, always winner is Android
U both r iphone lover
These are one of the times you obviously feel like viewing a paid commercial
This one was a total bias towards iPhone
Total Bias in Battery and Camera .
Is quickshare on samsung Not the same as airdrop
Ios is better without any question. Its used by people who value privacy nd security. Android is open for theft nd god knows what else
When it's comes to the debate between Android and IOS, i think there is one point people rarely bring up : APK  Sure, it's open source and extremely risky to install open source app on your phone but if you had some what knowledgeable in what you do, it fine and can make android the best users's experience you can have. I cant live without youtube vanced nowadays
I never understand people's dependence on iOS apps. You only depend on it because apple has market share and you and your friends use it. Just fucking all switch to a new app. Video conferencing has been around for 10 years. Using a messaging app, iMessage only has goofy little reactions and read/unread which already exists on Android anyways. Who airdrops frequently? Upload it to the cloud like a normal person, sharing a Google link is easy
Ok, but giving a whole point for eco friendly, and not giving android any when there are those good options... Wtf
This felt so blatantly bias at times, I almost felt like it was paid for. A draw on features 🤣 half the time they awarded a point before Arun even commented on a topic. Even after their discussion on cameras they're each saying they're in completely different camps and Arun still thinks android is the outright winner, but it's not a tie?
Imagine iPhone without any Google apps
Alternative title: unfair comparison bcz MKBHD likes iphone
If we talk about gaming ios can never beat android. Android has asus rog 6,lenovo legion. I have used both iphone and Android in my opinion the review was a little bit unfair MKBHD always gives more favour to iphone. And yeah samsung s22 ultra has better camera then iphone
i think there is a big factor that is not mentioned here and its the reason why even though I completely agree that all the things you said are true I still think android is better.        LIMITATIONS for all the things you say that Iphone does better almost all those things come at the COST of limitations.  you often can not move defaults away from the required apple ecosystem. And what it comes down to is if you want to lock yourself into the apple ecosystem then Iphone will always win. but i and many others find being locked in like that aweful to a huge degree.
so the BOSS is not the boss anymore? 😅
Android 100%
Android vs iPhone??? I think you meant: Android vs IOS
Right so whenever the android has the edge he calls it a draw, makes sense
Will always prefer iPhones safety over androids freedom
I'm so surprised, that an US American chose the IPhone 😅😅😅
Them  :  "Ironically, we just sat here thinking there's never been a better time to decide who's doing it better, but before we go through the 10 different aspects, here's a long Segway for today's sponsor"  Segway  :  Apple  Me  :  Yep, Android has actually entered the chat...
android is winner at- customization, usb c, repairability, sharing (ios & non ios), rooting/installing 3rd party apps, volume of apps you can select from play store.
Google Assistant is gonna gain 100% market share with Arun's voice.
Iphone still suck at adjusting keyboard size
Was going to get a Samsung and now idk lol
Customisation definitely to Android the flexibility is tremendous.
Galaxy is faster, expandable memory, more customizable and more durable but iPhone gets you laid faster and more. Look it up
Android just makes random bullshit features and lagdroid sheep minded fans think more features therefore it’s better. NO it’s about quality over quantity. iPhone’s features are always way better and useful than random bs Android features.
Iphone wins and always won so go back to your caves with ur lagdroid
Android does it better because all the phones use it 1000 points for android!
S22 ultra is better than I phone
Why don’t u do a comparison between iPhone 13pro max and google pixel 6XL
Apple is the 🐐
Here's a hot take, yes iphone is great in respects of it being its own eco system and self sufficient and reliable. But Android is actually better for most end users with ease of use, being customizable, and having better update support and beta support.
BLACK
This completely subjective because you can do this same analysis with 10 different people and get 10 different results
What's really funny is iPhone screens are made by Samsung
green bubble boys crying in the comments
Should have also compared Android Auto to CarPlay
Lol this is seriously the most biased comparison ever made.
Iphone in my opinion is way easer to use
I don’t understand people who obsess over a brand. From what I can see it depends on your individual needs. I’ve owned both and I like both. I don’t understand people getting butthurt over phone brands lol.
Here come the android users…
bruh
This is the second time I am watching this but it still feels very biased. Not a very objective comparison. I would like to see maybe you MKBHD and any android lover. Or two objective person.
This is bullshit.
4.7 million hits - WOW
Real techy people always have iPhone and Android phone both
Very cool, but have to say Android is way better still, and can't agree with the apple win, like you said really about personal use and taste and that is what this was.
paid for by iphone, soon as they gave the win to the unusable giant notched screen on the iphone it was obvious.  You cant even use the iphone on a sunny day and feels like a brick.
When was the last time an iPhone won best phone of the year award on mkbhd show.
My whole family has apple devices same with me but I’m still switching to android in a couple of years
this is more towards iOS know.. seems android is very bad know when it comes to the point score.
I stopped watching both these tech reviewers years ago.  The bias was becoming so obvious. If you want the truth try smaller channels who don't have to lie to keep their status.
Video was biased I feel, some good points about android. Just seemed like he was just taking his opinions and agreeing to it🤣
Crazy how this is basically iphone 13 pro max vs. samsung s22 ultra and a couple more flagship phones
Love how smooth Marques got away with a unanswered fist bump. but great video guys!!
samsunf m21 has 6000 mah
2:20 YOU CAN'T CHEAT WITH IPHONE, NOT FUN
You guys missed about an important convenient feature that is Always on display.    Who uses Airdrop on a daily basis?
I both used android and apple products but to be honest i will definitely choose android because of many things you can do to it. But sure it depends on what you will use for. 😉
Obviously sponsor by I phone for I phone fan boy...
No they should have said which is better for Marques. Not reality but .. it what they would pick. If you watched them then duh easy pick no matter what the other one has haha
Why are you asking mkbhd about iPhone? He will always defend it... No way iPhone is better than android
That vibration motor is important to me too. Samsung why change something that's not bad ? @Samsung
I think you should have someone who genuinely prefers Android, since you both love iPhones.
I’m concerned about the planet, but I don’t trust politicians or corporations to resolve that issue.
If companies were actually legit they’d have Tim Cock and Google-CEO-Man go head to head on stage
💫
Should use people not wearing an iwatch during the debate. Looks bias af. Lol
2 thirds through and this is the most clearly bias video I've ever seen from Mr Who's the Boss. Really disappointing really, always came for fair run downs but this so obviously apple slanted its sad
You should have used the Google pixel instead of using the Samsung
The brainwashing stuff that Apple has made through marketing campaigns will be studied in the universities in the future. This comparisson is plain ridiculous, it's like doing a Ferrari VS All other cars. Yes, if you take into account the average car, Ferrari will do bettter in lots of categories. If we compare just the OS, Apple builds a beautiful prison for you, 2x2 square meters, nice design and good views. Android puts you in the real world and let you go wherever you want. You can go to Bahamas or go to the local landfill, it's up to you. I choose freedom, for sure.
Software interaction is everything. From hardware standpoint there is so much sameness across all phones and even grades of phones now. It's tough to find the real diffs between mid-level and true flagships. Hair-splitting. But the UI diffs between Android and IOS couldn't be greater. I have given IOS a real, , leaned-in, honest try a few times now and each time I just couldn't get back out of it fast enough. Just so clunky against the Android ecosystem. Android is just so intuitive. So make-sense. And then add the unfettered customizability in Android. The simple eyebrow menu detail. Android is both more simple and offers more complexity at same time - more fluid use while also giving so much expandability. I do wish there was an iMessage equivalent in the Android/Google world. I can't send the huge videos over SMS. There are IOS features I wish were available in Android, but overall the Android ecosystem is just so much more and unrestricted. I have never had an issue with Android phone. Any of the 20 different models I've owned. Samsung 22+ is just flawless. I can't imagine needing another phone.
2.5 vs 7.5??? What a load of bulldust. That's like saying ferrari vs lamborghini and the lambo is way worse or vice versa. Android vs apple is savagely close. Not worlds apart....  2.5 vs 7.5 my ass!
Talking about airdrop, mind it, you have to all apple products for it to work. That means apple successfully manipulated you to buy its products -_-
My iPhone has 6 years
typical aple user😂
It is kinda fake bicuse no phone on world can beat asus rog phone 5
facetime? nah video call
Was this sponsored by Apple? @MKBHD had given the phone of the year award for S22 ultra. MWB has influenced MKBHD's somehow
This only told me I am a shrinking minority. Welp.
Not gonna lie but you just agreed to everything he said Mk.. you didn't said your opinion .
Price is much more important . Someone like me likes a phone who takes just good pics , has a good basic memory ( 64 GB ) and a stong battery and that is more than enough . So in Android i can find it for 100 - 150 Euro for the same i- phone you pay 3 - 4 times that amount  .  Because of my work a phone last 1,5 years so a don't give a rat's ass if it has 2 or 6 year updates
I think Mark is just apple blind.
So stupid. Comparing all the  Android phones with iPhone?? You should select one with one. Baseless comparisons.
ANDROID ALL DAY!!!!! will never go back to apple...everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Siri is shit compared to google assistant
These guys both have had more androids than iPhones so how could you even say that it is biased for iPhone 🤷🏻🤡
SO S22 ULTRA IS THE GOAT
This is not the correct comparison. I get it is sponsored👎👎
I'm definitely unsuscribing of these two. They've sold their souls to apple. I'm out!
How much is apple paying you guys?
Give an iPhone and an android to a person who has never used a smartphone, see which one wins.  It's obviously Android.
Heavily biased
Samsung galaxy S series Better then iphone
Sorry, The dislike I gave is to MKBHD
You can FaceTime with an android user you just have to send the link from iPhone to android.
MKBHD is just biased towards iphone... Lol Losing trust on him
This guy is byest to the i-phone
I used android for a decade but now have iPhone 13 pro max and with the eco system and how great it works with my iPad etc I have to say iPhone won me over. I love this phone. Samsung galaxy 22 ultra is great too but I’m sold on apple now
REALLY disappointed with this scoring. I've just moved from IPhone 12 to S22 ultra, and I'm very very happy.
When a company actively put software into their devices to make old phones unusable and forcing the consumer to buy new phones, it's immorale. Not to mention apple's invented this "environmentally friendly" cash grabbing move. How is forcing people to buy more phones better for the environment than giving people a charge so they can use their phones?
There was not enough discussion for each topic. There were some topics that definitely merited more discussion that could have leaned stuff towards Android for sure. Seemed slightly biased to avoid disagreement
This video is very rigged for the iphone.
That was a very strange Apple hype video....
Indians 🇮🇳 can relate *MKBHD* with *PKMKB* 😂  (Only for Legends!)
This dude is a paid IPhone pusher. Most facts he mentioned are a sales push technique.
I just saw 2 MrWho'sTheboss ads on his own video ... nice
Truecaller works awesome in Android. That's the main reason why I chose Android over an iPhone.
Not mentioning names, however one of them seems to defend iPhone no matter what
This was biased especially for camera Android should have won that no questions asked
Android fanboys should try to use old iphone versions for them to feel the real experience of having a good phone. I mean a phone that doesn’t lag and slow for all the time. 😅
IPhone sellers ⛔️
IPhones suck.... Android is much better
You just cant argue with Americans about iPhones
ONEPLUS FOR LIFE
iPhone won't become eco friendly until they switch to usb-c. I mean, there's no point in keeping usb-lightning at this point, and it's much better for the environment to have a solid unified standard for all devices
for me since samsung remove the sd card option  i find there's no point to stay with them.
you both just really like apple and are clearly biased imo
android screen is brighter and more responsive and has less edge and no nodge and fingerprint but its definetely even between the two.. i can close this video already
Camera point also goes to iPhone? USB-C and still iPhone gets its point? What was Marques smoking before this video? Not impressed at all.
Privacy is a big one, if you dig into how much personal data your Android phone funnels to google its a bit alarming. But I still cant see myself with an iphone.
I wish that i had 10 different phones sitting there that all rang when someone called my number - so that when i went out i could decide which one i wanted based off the features it provided for the activities i was about to engage in.
I strongly disagree with your rating, both guys keep trying to polish iPhone is so many ways, just to make it looks good, no one on earth can prove to me that ios have more functions that Android.. when you talks about functionality Android surpass ios. you didn't talk about software updates and so on
For camera.. That new xiaomi s12 ultra takes the cake for me
Idk, I just feel like I have so much freedom on Android, whilst on IOS I feel like I'm always considering my restrictions and things I can't do. I just don't like how claustrophobic I feel on iPhone compared to Android
Many things that get attributet to the iPhones great software are actually reflected in Android Apps like Spotify. The features are out there, if your app supports it and you are free to choose your apps on Android, unlike Apple which first and foremost locks you into their system.
With all the pushes of Aplle against right to repair, giving Apple the eco-medal feels just so wrong, when framework and fairphone have proven, that it can be done so much better
Look at all the apple haters 😂😂 its not even a contest apple is and will always be much better facts dont lie apple is miles ahead of it competition.
this video doesn't reflect the reality...
you can make a 100 videos about Apple vs Samsung and Marques will always be bias towards Apple
What a grimly biased review. I currently daily both and have been both solely iPhone and solely Android in the past and like many others in these comments find android infinitely better. Unless you buy into the whole apple ecosystem... Trouble is why bother when android works with pretty much everything out of the box? How can you compare the two and only briefly mention the lock in on apple products as a passing comment not to mention USB. This felt more like a fan boy moment than a honest review in my book but there you go 🤷🏻‍♂️
You know my first phone was a samsung galexy s1, but that was my last android until now. These 12 years of apple, has made my question my decision making. I had been an apple fan for what 13 or 12 years?? Why am I looking at these videos and seeing apple getting huge points for these pointless small gimmick's. 12 years and look what samsung has evolved from. On the other hand apple, I have been looking at the same metal and glass for a long time. Its stale, boring and just stupid. I think its my time for another phone. Something that while im using, I can discover more features with it. People say that Apple is easy to use. but in my opinion its looking like they have been thinking we are babies. I need something with more shortcuts so im moving to android.
Biased review.
iPhone is just better
apple win on one thing and android folks go crazy
Statements like "well if I give it to my grandma she would be able to use it, and that's why it's better" are making you both look unprofessional
Only when I'm using my android for productivity then I use multitask
How the Hell can DISPLAY be a draw. NO phone in the market can beat S22ultra's screen. Pretty baised
android slaps
I WOULD STILL PICK ANDROID OVER IOS SIMPLY BCOZ IT HAS MORE FREEEDOOMMM! NO OTHER FACTOR OVERPOWERS FREEDOM FOR ME....MY FATHER BOUGHT IPHONE 12 PRO LAST YEAR....AND TRUST ME IT WAS THE WORST  DECISION....HE ALWAYS HAD TO KEEP ANOTHER ANDROID PHONE HANDY FOR HIM TO WORK....THERE'S NO POINT IN KEEPING IT JUST FOR THE CAMERA(WHICH ALSO WORKS BEST ONLY IN GOOD LIGHTING)....HE SOLD IT ABOUT A MONTH AGO AFTER HE GOT IRRITATED...
Having used both systems, I find you two iOS fan boys really... In my opinion Android totally kills iOS in things that matter while you  give a tie even in the obvious wins for Android!
hahah rubish
I’m currently using an iPhone 13 pro max and a Samsung S20 ultra. I’m new to iPhone but a seasoned android user. I’m giving it a year before I decide which is better
For myself, it really boils down to needs vs wants. What phone has the most or above average options I can use, works with what I need it to and HOW it does that. Myself, I can get past charging cable issues/wireless charging vs the time it takes to charge and discharge that battery.  My choices work for me, so..............  But seeing the differences of android phones (AND different android model choices) vs what an iPhone offers.............................  Have to edit this a month later.   With Android, if you take a deep dive and really do the research, you can find the perfect phone for all your needs. If you instead are like most people, then your choices are boiled down to the main competitors.   My choices here in North America weren't legion, but were wide and varied, but I did decide to stay with the (mostly) stable Apple ecosystem. Which means iPhone 14 Pro. Overall, it has the features I expect with the performance I can use effectively.
S22U dominates the iPhone lol like wut
Eat that Android losersss 🤣🤣. Jk. Life is too short to fight over which mobile OS is better. Just use what you like. For me, I started out with an iphone. Then I got bored and switched to android (oneplus 7 pro, which was a great phone btw). I had fun customising my 7 pro. Now my 7 pro stopped working and I decided to go back to iphone because Im getting old and I cant be bothered to customise shit anymore. I just want something that just works and reliable. Also I have a bunch of apple products so its good to be in the ecosystem again. Just use what works for you
Ultimately.... Android gives more freedom... Who needs good food in a jail...
iPhone is the best,most Used Phones when it comes to Gaming So smooth no stutter,Soft touch All complete set
I know this is a tech video… But Marques… 🔥🔥🔥
Photography, maybe Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra could beat iPhone 13 Pro Max depending on the situation, but videography iPhone without a doubt os the winner
Both got paid by Apple sadly. Disliked the video :)
Pathetic video and comparison
Marques talking like he’s been kidnapped. 😂
The battery award should have gone to the Android especially since the battery on an iPhone degrades so much. (iphone user)
Interesting comparison, apples vs oranges! The best of all Android phones vs iPhone 13?
When I switched from the iPhone 7 to the Galaxy S lineup. My primary reason was the flexibility of the software but in particular the way it handled files of multiple types, it’s so practical to do things on Android that if you had an iPhone would be a hassle to do them and would make you want a Laptop or desktop for. That being said, I still own an iPad that I use a lot, and wouldn’t exchange for any other tablet.
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE BIASED BASED PRESENTATION!!!😠😠  BATTERY LIFE is the clear proof
The best with 120 hz ( iPhone) pixel is much better
Andriod has alot of features that you might not use everyday but when you need it they are always there whereas with iphone you basically just can't do what you want. I was on the fence of switching to iphone but when I learned more about ios I think I'm good with my andriod device. The splitscreen feature is useful to me I can basically have anything playing on youtuber while using maps(I used to listen to lectures while driving which is a game changer specially when you're short on time) whereas with iphone I can't do that. Also, MKBHD is using an andriod phone while complementing iphone which just goes to what they actually prefer to use even tho they have multiple options to choose from.
This is a biased result on Apple, there are so many more great features of Android than Ios
Cosomk
not surprised about the outcome. We all know Arun is an apple fanboy
In my opinion we actually cannot do a comparison between Android and iPhone/iOS Because like iPhone only process with iOS or only one company APPLE to Android with process with many companies and every mobile have their pros and bads.... It's like you are doing a 1v1000 🤝
I mean, isnt MKBHD a pretty big iSheep?
I saw u in Londen!! I walked past u, but i didnt realize it was u until i walked past u hahaha!
Never seen such biased video
Seemed pretty damn biased to me.
Great comparison, it's fun to see the two of you together 😉
Wow…been waiting for multitasking in iOS and then you guys go ahead and say nobody uses it on Samsung. I moved from Note10+ to iPhone 13 Pro Max and multitasking windows and being able to pop up a video on youtube and still be able to go on with my work on the phone, or play a game is the feature I miss the most!  And Samsung Dex IS useful, especially if your work requires quick data transfer between Windows laptop and your phone.   I know iphone’s 13 line put Apple on the radar again, but you don’t move from Android to Apple because you don’t like Samsung’s features. You move because Apple is more reliable, I get more security and a better warranty and my phone is more repairable. Samsung still has drool-worthy productivity features that I miss daily.
Android win
I got an android OPPO A12 for 4years now
How did you give it a draw for special features lmfao, both you guys are coming across as apple fanboys fr.
Bias
thanks so much man
Sponsored by apple.  There are so so so many countless reasons why this video is absolutely absurd.  They start out each question by saying the android is technically better and then ends it with the iPhone winning?  They’re literally admitting the android disappear and then making excuses as to why the iPhone wins.  This is the most pathetic video I’ve ever seen. I use an iPhone it’s an absolute piece of shit in countless ways.
lol title android va iphone
Really? Screen is a draw? Hahaha  That’s when you know this video is not being honest immediately. The iPhone screen is extremely underwhelming with flickering issues on the 12 model
iPhone sucks, I have one.  They have terrible battery life.  They charge the slowest of all phones.  You need allot of proprietary software to do basic things.  Most apps do accomplish simple tasks are no on the phone, and require an app that likely costs money.  Essentially zero ability to customize/locked arbitrarily. They overheat pretty quickly in the heat.  Lack of compatibility, leading to issues with many web based applications.   iPhone is actually quite terrible. Their promotion team is the only thing that is impressive, in their ability to sell the same product over and over again as though it’s completely new.  Having come from android, I was simply astounded and amazed at the limitations and lack of functionality that the iPhone actually has. I found it quite surprising just how much I could not do that I want to cud. Something as simple as turning off animations completely was no longer an option. The fact you can’t even disable the power button from hanging up the phone calls. These are truly the worst phones I’ve ever used in my life there is nothing about it that makes life easier and more fun. There is a reason people say that Apple has its own ecosystem and you become part of it. because the only thing that truly works well with an iPhone is iPhone products.
ECO worth a point???
2 of the biggest yt tech creator and compares Android (an operating system) to iPhone (hardware). Bruh what
Android wins over iOS hands down
Apple is a walled garden ecosystem where you're paying for the brand.
IPhone blackpink✌
Legends always use Android.... 😎😎
Apple is s*** now I'm so glad I didn't get anymore Apple products
Omg, what a bunch of biased pack of bs! I would never trade the freedom that I enjoy using Android over iOS that I used before that. Besides, in Asian traffic, splitting screen for Google Maps and YouTube was a huge win for Android that makes me I would never go back to iOS! File manager!! Come on... Samsung Galaxy FTW!
Too much Biased on iPhone xD although android is somewhat kind of win more in this.
Good video but breaking it down like this doesn't weight things in a "real world usage" way. You have to actually play with both. I use the Samsung mobiles, and on iPhone, while using it there are just small little things about iOS that really annoys me, which are never going to make it onto a rating chart. Little things like copy pasting ease etc (feels snappier on Android I think), just stack up.  For tablets, Apple is leagues ahead in terms of how they feel to use. LEAGUES. The Galaxy tablets feel awful to use.  However, the Android PHONES seem to feel better while performing basic computing-style tasks. The most basic functions. Back buttons, copy pasting feels easier, just tiny little things like that.
This video is a fucking joke lmfao.
I have money but FCK iPhone I'll go for any premium android devices but not that crappy fruit fone.
the hell you saying i once got an iphone and there was sh** smered on it
YouTube ads getting longer
this was very obviously biased
I am disapointed on the protection of planet argument that cant possbly go to iphone because of thirs repair practices !!! You cant repair your iphone which refurbished partts !!!
This whole video is bias ....no lie
Using both apple and android phones. its better than comparing
U guys gotta be from apple cause u guys are full of shit. Ever person with a iPhone has an ass battery life.
Nobody talks about Mod apks😁
Gosh alot of kickback in the comments
Nokia
what about notification-management? Which is (for me) one of the main tasks if not the main task on a phone. Never got mentioned.  I use iOS and Android (work and personal) and I forget to answer a lot of people on the iphone, because the structure is horrible
Android user , turnt iphone user to to try to goin back to android
At the end of the day, the best phone is the one you have.
Video is sponsored by apple, literally because mkbhd likes iPhone, like literally
The salt from Android fans in the comments is ridiculous, you’d think Marcus insulted their mothers or something.  Caping over a phone lmao
The most biased video.  It was obvious when you see brownie was in the video.
Iphones are worst ever...
The battery life on the 13 ProMax is out of this world. I can get 4 whole days easy. As a former lifetime Android boi Apple have a few drawbacks, strange gestures more steps in certain processes but the homologation of hardware and software that Apple has means with the same engine, an iPhone will run circles around Android. It's Windows vs Mac all over again.
I knew IPhone  was going to be the winner
To me it seems like your always choosing IPhone so this isn't far for Samsung but it's your channel stop kissing Apples A$$
I have both  n I still choose Samsung over IPhone
Iphone coz of BATTERY and ALERT SLIDER!!!!!
You forgot spam call handling.  Maybe just Pixels excel here but my wife almost traded her iPhone for a Pixel after seeing mine handle spam calls.  Also, I disagree saying an iPhone wins a category because more people use it.  They don't have a choice if the have iPhone.  That was their decision.  You need to judge these categories by the phone itself.  For customizations Tasker is the reason I will only buy Android.  If iPhone opens up and allows things that Tasker can do then I'd consider it.  I can have my phone call different phone numbers, send out texts, maximize volume, etc based on if I received a text that had 911 in the text.  iPhone cannot do that.
I got my S22 Ultra for $200 less as the iPhone 13 max pro was also $200 less in promotion deals. Never buy it at retail until you look around for better prices. Your a fool if you pay full price.  I love my S22 Ultra. And I will always get android phones.
Extremely generalized comparison, when it comes to specialization, Android blows iOS out of the water. To me what is most important is that Android is open source unlike iOS.
Android won round 2 when it comes to gaming and linking to Xbox and playing xcloud games
I saw a comment on how Arun is obviously a fan of MKBHD, and doesn’t wanna go against his opinion, which has basically caused the review to be entirely lopsided
What about the pricing you missed the price you missed the topic of price of both phones android and iOS
Every android I owned my eyes be red because of the camera or the screen
I am sorry but I need to call bs on a lot of these points
This video seems very bias.I use both iphone 13 and samsung s22 ultra. Samsung is much better.  Iphone is like being in house arrest. Yes you are very fast moving from room. Samsung is like your house is Manhattan.
Bro the android deserves the win because we can't play fortnite on the iPhone
Vivo is best
Nice genshin clip
I disagree with battery statement. My Iphone 13 pro max dies and i have to charge for hours to get it full.
Extremely biased! Is the Apple display better than the S22 ultra? Nope ..but hey, is it better than an android costing 5 times lesser, sure! Let's call it a draw for display then 😂
I never thought two of the best tech reviewers in the world would do something this stupid how can you compare a phone and an operating system that's stupid. Thousands of phones are shipped with android each year so you can't compare android with an iphone nxt tym try using a pixel device since its the only phone in the market that's pure android
Iphone is for sure paying that man
iPhone is 3x better than Samsung jeez lol
So, it is a promotion from apple…
In my opinion if Samsung and Apple just fused they'd make an awesome company
First Video i gotta say is bullshit.
It’s really important to people to have iMessage and put exclamation points on text?? That’s just being fanboy.. it is in no way useful to anybody and we all did pretty good without when it wasn’t a thing 😂
he said if he gave his mother the phone and asked her to set up a widget, she would know what to do, well duh if she uses an iPhone now. hand me an iPhone and ask me to do anything....good luck
did they just talk about all apple strong points? photos should go to the ultra. and the environment shouldn't have even been a category. agree with everything else but like i said they was all apple strong points anyway smh
Apple just makes everything better it’s easy to hate them but hard not to love what they do. If you want the best experience iOS does the job. Easier thing to do is go with them. But if you hate them then you gota give some shot to google pixel. I feel like they will make there own eco system and it will be the best android eco system. Samsung and the rest will use there OS and they will dominate the android side. Apple still king in everything else.
we all knew that the camera of iphone is made by sumsung
MKBHD is so biased towards iphone, i senarios where android is easily better he will try to pursue for a draw....like bruh...being a tech channel stop being a fanboy
this was a roast of android devices disguised as a comparism. They've clearly been bought by Apple
You know that you can get different haptic motors in the apps even keyboards have their own haptics settings
I just don't understand how you can be talking about the advantages of each and then give points to the iPhone every time
Cap!
OMG what an ethereal collab 🥺
Fun fact this comment section is as mad as you’d expect for a phone comparison
I’ve been saying it iPhone does it best it’s not about who has more features or who introduces new features first.. I want a secure, reliable phone and iPhone does it best
So obvious that you guys give points easier to the iphone. No point for google assistant?
iphone is horrible at recording phone calls and Samsung has been downgrading their phones every year I like my S8 over my Samsung 22 Ultra
I like how people forget that apple was the worst in terms of battery life. Like 2-3hrs sot and the phone is almost completely dead. 😅 Its not like Android phones has gotten worst its just that iphones have gotten a lot better.
I like mkbhd but there's no denying that he prefers apple but that doesn't mean that ios is better. It's fine we all have different taste and needs.
5 years of apple emoji updates is better than 3-4years of major updates on android?
Seriously how can you compare  software between  android and ios while comparing the best hardware in ios { iphone 13 } against androids vast range.
The real result is in the comment section.... ANDROID is the clear winner....
Wasted 20 mins. Was here to see fair comparison.
As a consumer who has owned both I  the past samsung wins hands down usb c over lighting cable and I know ppl who have taken apple fines back with in a day due to use ability
uk vs us
Samsung Android is better than iPhone.
Not being forest into Eco system I care Lover about it's five points for me so for me a draw ;-)
Help I still use Samsung galaxy grand prime plus 2014 This thing 4yo and going crazy
Felt like quite biased... Cause Apple has still to catch up with the sales of android phones... So apple need influencers like them, who make ppl comfortable for buying expensive phones of Apple and boost their sales figures... Apple still has to catch up in so many areas where android are far better then apple and its ios..
Quite biased!
Nah! Ihave both phones, ilove android more.. i only have a xiaomi 11T android phone which most people hate and i also have an iphone 12 pro max, honestly i spend more time with my android than my iphone. So weird.. and one thing i think samsung is the one making the screen for iphone so i dont think its a tie.. coz i dont think samsung will give iphone the best one..hahahaha
I like android you can do so many things that aren’t possible on IPhone iOS but it depends on what you like and this clearly just shows they both like simple things, android is there for people who like going a bit further to use the device to its full potential
How can Apple 🍎 be a better phone 📱  when the buy 🤔 the parts from Samsung, it's All about taste and what you like more, iphone brought back to life the iphone 5 on the iphone 13 if you know you know 😉
The point 👉 . 👈 is that both companies are making money.
Yay another pointless video where people dont understand what they are talking about
seriously "it leaves a dent in my hand"? UGH
Samsung is better in all ways you talk shit  I had both phones Samsung better to use the screen better the cameraa better
Basically my friend (android) vs her teacher
I am worried. I have a friend who bought an I pod, then got the I phone, I mac, I pad as well as the Apple TV. Her boyfriend gave her some apple headphones. I bought her an air tag and her brother is about to giver his old Apple Watch.. I am worried that the very second she puts it on, can she snap her fingers and make the android users of the world disappear?
Android vs iOS, first topic: the display 🤔
such bias !!!
Don't like iPhone, I like only Samsung and xiaomi 🥵😒
Nicely answered
I don’t think it matters what phone Apple or android they’re both the same technically he think about it
For me there is only one thing that is important - does the operating system let me - its user, decide how I want to use it. If not, and creators of that system thinks that user is a moron then sorry, its not for me. I want to use my device the way its convenient for me. On Android I can do that. I can install custom launcher that will create environment that I'm used to using, I can manually install certain apps that I need that are no longer available in Google play store
If you have to compare different-different phones to equal the one iPhone…. I mean doesn’t that tell you something?
Really looked like a paid video from apple or at least somehow the 10 lines were  not well considered.   Some very important things are missed, where the android devices are leading.   - Repeatability - Free Applications Store - Freedom of what your device should do. ( Like turning the Bluetooth off ) - Different Brands - Software Connection and Work with other Devices not with the same software.
about assistants on ISO you can also install google assistant but on android you can not get siri
i still prefer the freedom android gives you
dunno, seems pretty biased
this doesn't feel like a fair comparison to me.
Ultimately from a personal perspective, I just do not want to be tied into a closed and very restrictive Apple ecosystem.  If you want to someone else choosing how how your phone should operate, look and which features are allowed then go with Apple. If you actually want to have control over your phone then get an android.
They should change to subject to " dialogue between 2 iphone fans" instead!
Android is the best apps frndly easy to transfer files from other phone not iphone😀😂😂😊🍫🤣
dude if i had a phone b/w iphone and samsung , the camera test you did , clearly shows that android is just better . If i take a random shot , i will know it is good without even LOOKING at it. The 15x zoom on the 13 pro is crappy as hell , I used my mom's iphone 13 pro and that shot zoom photos(more than 5x) so crap that i couldnt click a sinlge good photo with it. Also type c chargers are found everywhere. lets say you lose your charger , You can take it from any stranger and know that it will work. For battery life , as far with my mi 12 ultra , i think that it charges so quickly that i dont even care for the battery anymore.  android deserved 2 more points bro
it is a Samsung screen 🤣 Samsung makes the displays for iPhone 🤣🤣🤣
Honestly I prefer android as they offer more freedom than ios. I have used both android and ios before. During the short time I used ios, I realized that I cant even cuztomize ringtone :(
There seemed to be some unusual sexual tension between them in this video
iPhone uses Samsung's Camera and software and uses Samsung's display too.
I really miss one thing hardly on my iphone i had on Android. The Keyboard of SwiftKey and Google had a special sign on every letter. With my iphone there are no special signs. I can install Google Keyboard, but with that i have only the signs on the numbers, not on the letters. It annoys me everytime i need a special sign like ( or) or /... I have to switch sites. On Android this was all in the letters.
I believe you should have compared the iPhone with Google Pixels (Original Stock Android itself) not Samsung. Thanks
If you are a Windows-User than it is much easier to go with an Android. Copying files to and from the phone is as matter of copy+paste
I love apple, I use Mac, also ipad...but I won't be able to leave Android as long as I get similar kind file management in iOS.  File management in iOS sucks big time.
Not needing a stupid non type c charger is one. Also Samsung battery saving tech is superior my s10 plus degrades at 2.5% a year so it last forever. Also the pro camera features available in galaxy make the camera way superior for photography. The One hand motion plus feature on all Samsung devices meaning I have like 15 swiping commands that I can do with one hand include, split screen, close app, forward browser, back in browser, change volume, power off ect... With just my thumb.
I been with iPhone since 3GS just because of higher buy back value after 2 years of use compare to any android phone that release on the same year
i ship them
It's really just about type c for me tbh
You can tell he's very biased  and a big apple supporter and Mr.Whostheboss knows 😕🤣
Iphone smacks Android but Samsung smacks Iphone. The phone battle is just Samsung and Iphone, nothing comes close.
I still call Android Swiss cheese programing. I avoid Android, years ago While testing a Samsung it crashed 9 times in one day!
They did android dirty
Strangely feels like everytime you say something good on iphone you STAMP IT and on Android you still end up giving it to IPHONE. didn't seem honest at all in many ways, like it was paid   Seriously, i use an Android but even if it will loose in the real world (an iphone) on usage except camera and fast loading (still questionable with the new androids with massive incomparable speed) android should have won this even if barely winning.   Even if the iPhone wins... Sounds rigged to me  (But that's just my opinion anyway right ?)  What's the deal with buying 95% on apple store 🤦
How is customization a draw? Just because it's easier doesn't mean it can do better. There are apps that you can use and other themes available, lots of them in android and you call that a draw?
Nah bro the left guy is just an iphone fsnboy
Why is MKBHD so Biased to Iphone
he is iphone fan. i dont tjink this is ligit try the same again whi one that never have use it one of them for a week each. i phone pff
how come you just compare a single company vs a thousands companies all together from looking at just 10 phones.  This is not fair at all.   You just giving a wrong impression comparing apples and oranges.   That's what i think just like this video is about what you guys think.  From the start of video you guys went a little bias on apple.   Both of you have done videos about how apple makes you locked in to there products without sharing them to other ecosystem. but any feature or a app developed in android is readily available for anyone since it's all about communities. and ease of use and money of course.  If you are doing it fairly it should be like apple feature vs the android phone that beats it. dude there is so many options so many phones so many choices in android world anyone in the world can be satisfied.  it feels like you guys choose the questions having answers all ready decided. if you asked a different set of questions you will have a different outcome.  your video should be about how phone companies came this far copying and outsmarting each other that literally they dont have anything new to give us something than a few software features.  You just one sided in a biggest debate we have as the new generation without proper facts. not nice.  but i still love you guys will be watching your videos.
Your video editing is absolutely AMAZING. How do you edit your videos
Display is a tie? Come on, you can't be that biased.
what about phone repair ??
The biggest flex of ios is that it can still be tracked if the phone is switched off. Android really NEEDS to get this feature.
*Fact:* That Android Is A Lot Of Cheaper Than IOS But Still, It Has Many Features For A Normal User And That's The *Main Advantage* Like For Myself Too
iPhone always
Who even needs facetime or imessage as if messenger doesnt does the same thing🤣
I have been using iPhone and Android concurrently all my life, this review is so biased that I stop watching in the midway.
Bullshit
Good Vid👌
Fantastic comparison. Thank you to the two of you
It's funny how he praises apple but uses the Samsung S21 Ultra...
Haha Android OS vs iPhone
Can i have a phone pls
You have to be blind to not see the paid sponsorship by Apple.
Iphone which is an actual phone competing with an OS? That topic doesn't seem right, it should be Iphone vs Samsung (and not the whole galaxy of android phones on the market)
Iphones are trash tbh. And this video doesnt change that
Why is everyone hating so much? Apple has the better phone, just deal with it. Also I think you two should do more videos together!
The Other Guy Sucks
You guys talked about OS updates very briefly. In my opinion this is hugely important. When the major iOS updates drop, like iOS 16, 3/4 of ALL iPhone users have a reason to get excited. 75% of iPhones are running the latest iOS. While <15% of Android phones are running the latest version.
To me the most controversial topics are the ones that doesn’t have an nailed answers, something to say that “Yes that’s it for sure !” Regarding this android and ios battle surely doesn’t have any relevance to anyone because at the end of the day the winner is always the one that fits the best to the user. As an ex android user for over 10 years me for example i’ve found that ios fits the best for me, exactly because of the well know fact that i don’t have that many options i used to have on android wich as a result makes me spend less time on the smartphone. So there is no winner at all between android and ios and even the smartphones, i’m wondering how many of us are buying an top feature smartphone and how many of us are fully using it ? I had an note 20 ultra and in 2 years i used the pen like probably 10 times, so how many are in the same situation ? So there is no “the winner takes it all” in smartphone operating systems.
MK is so judicious and also loyal to what he loves, I love the way he thinks. He’s a good guy. Both of you tho good job 🤟
NO APP OF IPHONE IS FREE. ALL APPS HAVE SUBSCRIPTION MODEL. SO IPHONE/IOS IS A TOTALLY FAIL CONCEPT IF YOU USE APPS ALOT. NO YOUTUBER WILL POINT OUT THIS FACTOR. COZ THEY ARE NOT SO INTO IT. SO APPS ARE TOO COSTLY.   these two youtubers always failed to point out this.
Aah.. FeelsGoodMan.. seeing Genshin Impact gameplay
I call BS and agree with others this is not a fair comparison when taking into account one operating system is limited to one phone, and the other supports hundreds of different phones with many hardware variances.
You could have used the note series samsung always made those way better
Nice
alot of butthhurt android user here.
The black guy tried good acting but he is a paid actor for iPhone
Android has infinite more features but iPhone's few features are used by many of their users so iPhone wins this category... 😂🤣 What???
I like iPhone better
I don't care about how much recycled product is in my phone. That shouldn't  be on the list
You can’t go wrong with either phone though to be honest
Apple is better hands down
Mkbhd is an apple fan boy video is terrible so biased towards apple
How can you compare IPhone to the entire of Android  When most android mobile companies are completely trash (Tecno)
Please note pixel also give 5yrs of update like iPhone
Was this sponsored by Apple?
Mkbhd saying apple has smoothest phone with 120 hz is big lie. Golden reviewer has proved they jitters in 120 hz
This is your worst video by far. I've never seen a video this biased from you.
Never seen a tech youtuber so biased.
How can you compare a operating system to hardware? Stupid
Where can I get a legit samsung 22 ultra s pen replacement? Samsung saying it's unavailable
It's so funny because in Europe vast majority of people owns an Android phone, so much so that I am yet to meet anyone who uses an Apple phone other than American tourists...
I am worried. I have a friend who bought an I pod, then got the I phone, I mac, I pad as well as the Apple TV. Her boyfriend gave her some apple headphones. I bought her an air tag and her brother is about to giver his old Apple Watch.. I am worried that the very second she puts it on, can she snap her fingers and make the android users of the world disappear?
I phone was untouchable with jailbreaks. Now it’s just a useful phone.
Apple.  Yesterdays tech at tomorrows prices
Money won in this whole conversation 💎
I like the iphone better because it's smaller but the performance is still top tier compared to smaller android phones where it's pretty much a downgrade
It looks an Apple sponsored video. It looks like a very random and biased discussion. The scoring feels unfair. There is no consideration about Geo locations. Facetime, iMessage, Airdrop might be very important if all of your friends and family own an iPhone and other apple devices. Maybe in US, most people own an iPhone and it will be useful but for most people in the world their family and friends don't own an iPhone, so what do they do with iMessage and Facetime.  There is no mention about repairability.  There is no mention about the use of lightning cables.
Almost every comments agrees Android should have take the win.
Just do what MKBHD does carry an android with an iPhone
This guys talked about display and battery, yer they have simply given to iPhone. Definitely iPhone is better overall in many aspects but the unfairness to rate Android just 2.5 is bizzare. It could have been 4.5 to android vs 5.5 to iPhone or let's say 6 to iPhone. This guys missed about usb c and innovation - Apple is trying hole punch display, AOD, 120 Hz LTPO, etc whereas android been doing it from a long time.
Apple is overated. Fark your reviews. You can’t even close all app’s on ios. You have to close one app at a time
It was not biased at all 🤣
apps are specialluy optimised for ios whereas there are far more combination of chipsets in android world its tough for android to optimise apps thats why it lacks in many departments
Apple provides great value for money specially in Phone and Macbook
Apple will be apple
Usb c is life changing for android
I use an S22 ultra, I've never been a fan of iPhone but you can't discredit there achievement, like it's literally all androids vs Apple which is crazy however for a standpoint on everyday life I would not be able to pick which one if I was unbiased. Both Samsung and iPhone are amazing phones and companies
So bias I'll just do me I think
I don't like how when iPhone gets hot it dims the phone all the way down and can't charge the phone until it cools down. Everything is their preference not yours so go check it out iPhone or Android.
Apple and android both have good and bad things about them but apple phones also seem faster because the apps are more optimized for reliability where android apps are more diverse if android did what apple does with apps the performance would be much different and while apple phones may hold better battery life and iMessage and all the other known features android/samsung has so many more features and customizable options and if you really want to have iMessages you can get blue bubbles on your Samsung and have a similar experience and you can also now join FaceTime calls with android users I think if this video went into more depth with the Samsung capabilities this score would be much different.
I am so disappointed that I used to like these 2 shills smdh they are basically shilling for Apple$$$ isht hard man lol
Whole year old. Ha! Im using a note 4. Phone still works. Replaced battery once. Still going strong 💪🏽
Wow, one win in valueand  that was like obvious one. This was so biased that makes me wonder why on earth did you even make it. Camera and display is clear win for Samsung but you care for some obscure values on those. Apple with its closed enviroment cant ever compete with android for that matter. Bs comparison.
I don't think this video was fair
great
2:21 the game is Noah’s heart just a random fact.
Too bad YouTube took away our 👎
A great versus video👏🏾
everyone knows the year 20:22 🤣😂😂
so much hate for Android
Most eco friendly phones???? Woke 😂
Why do people get so caught up over what phone another person prefers more?🙄
Another BIG difference in these two phones are survivability and repair costs, dropped my samsung multiple times on wooden floor and into water and nothing happend to it, my mother dropped her Iphone once and had to pay almost 250€ for a new screen. So yeah i stick to my samsung
I have subscribed your channel   Creative Content 💫
I cannot ever see myself using the Apple environment.   I'm sure it's great and polished but it's just to simplified for me.
had Samsung s10 personal s20 work and replaced my permit rsonal s10 with I phone 13 pro max at my son and daughters request. Just so we could easily do face time and 2 for one at phone company daughter wanted I phone. Bad move for me some issues were os  related to be expected. But the i phones screen does not pickup my touch as well as my S10 did o
This video was so biased like wtf
Fyi the housing of the pixel is 100% recycled aluminum.   if your comparing flagships then android takes it. Kinda surprised at the research here.
We have nearby share, which is basically airdrop
Totally biased and your scores should have been on cards unseen by other .
Very biased video. Samsung is way better in playing games. Iphone might be powerful in paper, not in practice. Iphone gets hot, it hangs, stop working all of sudden without reason. If you are playing strategic games like GOTC, you are screwed with Iphone. Some people I played with had to buy Samsung just for sake of game smoothness. So if you wanna play games in your phone, don’t buy Iphone.  Edit: Also iphone can’t stand cold weather, it would just literally freeze, unlike Samsung.  The only good thing about Iphone is video recording.
Sooo biased.
I use both phone, both are different useful both are same
every single meme about iPhone The battery:⚡⬇️💩
Some guys common be positive man..it’s just an personal preference..i used both android & ios..i used android for 4 years & got iphone 5s..it’s highly impossible to live without apple product and it’s not about fandom i like both ios and android and i use both android & ios now also..both os having different leagues.
I remember how snappy the first windows phones felt with the Nokia lumia 635 only 512 mb of ram vs an android phone with 1gb but that was based on how good the operating system used the resources. Today I still prefer the android ecosystem over iPhone. Kinda biased since I only had one iPhone and that was the original se. It was more tedious to navigate menus. But I loved the small size and the screen was way better than any android I owned. Now I have an s21 but my s7 I think had the better oled screen. Was brighter and better darkness levels. I guess it's all on preference with so many devices out there.
Iphone is better than android but not everyone can afford it. There is a lot of good phones at low price.
Android is way much better. When the world is ending, you’d wish you have an Android.
HONESTLY THEY ARE BOTH PRETTY MUCH THE SAME I JUST CHOOSE IPHONE BC I JUST LIKE THE FEEL OF THE PHONE MORE THEN ANDROID PLUS IV BEEN USING IPHONE FOREVER NOW AND I KNOW HOW TO WORK EVERYTHING
this sentence,,,,,,,''one potential saving grace for android'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,just so shameless you both lost respect in my eyes today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no one fooled this world more than iphone
grossly disappointed by this biased and dishonest video by these two so called giants................
Honestly I think Good Android phones are real VFM these days. One can get the best of both worlds at a much cheaper price than the iPhone. Google and Android are increasingly working towards security updates now , also Android updates are for 3-4 yrs now making software intuitive to use.
in most of the cases i find apple just a follower,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,while others introduce a thing,,,,,,,apple take years to include join that the care for customer is shown by a buyer is forced to get a charger form some other shop,,,,,,,as if charger is not a necessary thing for a cell phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,this is how iphone befools the people
i thought i would get objective and unbiased opinion from these guys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,but everyone is sold here, you just know how to buy one
Games running on iphone are smoother because its easier to fix because of display .. unlike android different phones different aspect ratio
Using s22ultra as my daily and iphone at work. Would never change to an iphone, however iphone is a great long lasting internet router ♡
Wow!... looking at the comments... I'd say you guys missed the mark!... or maybe that was the whole point! Ya got over 4 mill views in a month... congrats!
I like to have an iPhone but  money is always a problem 😭
Sponserd by iphone 😂🤣
Common Android W
Great advertising 👏
Iphone battery 100% after one min 0
Peak proof, theft alert bike mode , reading mode , gaming mode, one hand mode, power boost , nearby share and lot of other that iphone have not
I've never used an iPhone in my life. I would rather use a brick Nokia phone that an iPhone (no joke).
Do you all believe that iphone small screen can beat s22
Two iphone users are comparing
Personally, I think the eco category depends on the person. We don't need a new phone every single year in fact I'm on a moto e right now and it works great for me. People make fun of me in school obviously but I honestly don't care. The biggest thing preventing me from iPhone is how toxic the community is and I feel like a lot of that comes from the company. They wring out as much money as they can with adapters and stuff and I hate it. They're just an annoying company in my opinion. Plus with my phone I get a bunch of cool features that I genuinely use. Plus there are so many features from Google like Google lens and stuff that I love.
I also accidentally trigger Siri a lot
MKBHD is so biased in this video it's ridiculous. How do you give the display to iPhone when it's one of the only phones with the dead screen space at the top. Apple devotee smh 🤦
Marques is a devoted apple user, of course he will say iphones are better.
the subject should be named "Samsung vs iPhone" like there is only Samsung brand with android OS
I feel like this comparison was kind of stupid since you’re comparing operating systems the only fair thing to compare would be the best in their branch, which in the iOS case would always be the newest pro max but in the androids case would have been literally any phone. Taking the average android phone is not really fair since there is just a lot of cheap android phones while apple literally only offers high value phones lol
But you’re comparing an OS to a phone..
The most bias video I have watched on this channel
Ohh he's British!
Those numbers are just wrong.
I like ios
The average Joe wants to FaceTime his family, iMessage his coworkers and airdrop something to his friends because most of them have iPhones. And he can do that with his ancient iPhone 6. That's why you hear people say that they recommend iPhones to their relatives, it's less hassle. And people who are more tech focused still get a top tier phone with the iPhone flagship. This is why Apple sells more phones, it is not a case of what's better point for point. You can get a better deal going for an android. Money no object I would for sure buy the flagship Sony or Samsung are selling, but I would still keep an iPhone.
I like how they're comparing 1k iPhone to 300$ Android.
Oh yeah and multitasking and  browsing , usb c  etc there is no comparo. Samsung has not got enough credit over the years technically cuz the average user is not a techie..but I don't fanboy over any Corp. They here to make billions. This is the least objective thing I've seen from these guys.
I very much like both presenters. But that overall scoring was crappy. ANDROID flexibility and customization compared to Apple strait jacket is BIG!
Imagine 🗿🗿🗿🗿 And android vs Iphone? You guys are tech people common
Every category was "well this android does it better, but i like apple better, so I'm going to give it to iPhone"
Just for Android customizability, i will choose it
Mrbeast still can’t make a win even after trying Android still can’t get a clear win  Also people who are talking about usb-c  Your usb-c was actually made by apple and given free to all they are looking at deploying a better and faster  technology than usb-c that’s why they are holding off.
I for one use my s20 ultra alot  but  the fact that a iPhone 12 pro max battery is lower mAh than the base s20 is unforgiving to me
it doesn't make much sense to compare iPhone, a model of smartphones, with Android, an OS. You should've compared Samsung S vs iPhone. That would've made more sense
hahaha they are talking about a whole year old phone and me using s6 still xD
For fu(k sake apple iphone are shit get over it
When apple wins everyone be like oh they are fanboys mimimi if android wins everyone is like ha I always knew and. Was better bla bla bla, honestly they stated their arguments so good and are both experts on the phone game why the fuck just can’t u accept that apple won that one  Edit: oh another point apple wins video  is biased android wins video is good never have i seen guys calling a video biased when android wins if someone had something against android win its an aplle fanboy if apple wins the video is biased so bad
All the iPhone users are in here eating popcorn and reading all the hate comments 😂😂😂😂
Split screen and pop up screen are one of the best features. Watch YouTube videos and chat on a different app at the same time.
android is just better 😳
As much as I do love my iPhone, I wouldn’t hate switching to a Samsung or something completely different since all I’d be missing is the ecosystem
...
I think a lot of good points were not mentioned on the androide side.
this question is biased against ios and yet you still get a bias towards iphones. how does this happen? need a bigger, brighter screen? there's an android phone for that! need better speakers and microphone? there's an android with that! need the best battery life and/or faster charging? there's android phones for that! need better performance? well guess what! there's an wndroid for that! what iphone has is the best generalist phone, not the actual best in most of these categories.
comparing mid range android with latest iphone just imagine the price difference guys
and the fact is this video is sopnsored by apple i think.
IPhone are very nicely optimized product, they are good but they have a lot of limitations  Samsung is  good and is very flexible but sometimes  software is laggy
I wonder if there was bias in this video xD
Starting looking at the video and stopped right after the screen score, can't believe that the other guy just wanted to give more credit to iphone's screen seems kinda biased from the start so it doesnt give me confidence to continue watching  anyways, would've love to see this video, if you would be doing it all by yourself, I sold phones for a living for a long time, and I walways loved your objetivity, but its not the case in this video. I still love your contect and your style :p
This seemed alittle bias
Damn mk is such an apple fanboy jeeze
Carne Asada lmao
MKBHD is an Apple fan boy. Battery on my S22 Ultra is way better than my brother's iphone 13 Pro
Do it with some one who don't need tweezers to build a pc
DONT FORGET THE TWEEZERS
Who cares what he thinks this should be facts what are yall in California? Hahahahahahvdnsja
No way, jose.
His video was disturbing  to watch and I love these to guys channels.  But for them to rate samsung  this much lower  shows a clear bias.  Very disturbing.
Apple just looks at what Android is doing and does it 2 years later
Android will always be better because of choices
This video was way too biased with MKBHD, he wasn't even being objective about it. Lock screen widgets on iPhone better than android, seriously?   Almost all the points where it shows android having more flexibility and potentially better performance depending on the model, he goes to say he prefers what it was - consistency. That's just being unreceptive to changes from Android and super receptive to any changes or improvements from Apple, no matter how late they come.  I get that this is a personal decision, and of course he can have his own preferences. But really expected him to be more objective here since it was a discussion about what's better, not just what he likes.  At the same time, the weight of the factors matter too. Whether that extra $ you're paying is worth the "consistency" and preference.  Lastly, they should have also brought up repairability and on USB-C ports. Not just about the charging speeds of android phones, but the convenience of using one cable for everything.
I am an apple hater. Simply  because  samsung  has been statistically  better for years
OMG they are really telling that iphone wins you must be joking they dont know what they are talking about android is better than iphone in everything just everything why are you lying to people
There is not two opinions here android is way better iphones are gigamega overpriced offering nothing in return just the logo people bying it are not knowing what they are doing for example iphone 13 pro maxed ram and storage for 1800 dollars FOR 1800 DOLLARS I CAN BUILD A FRICKING GAMING PC THAT CAN JUST FART AND DESTROY THIS PHONE TO ASHES but if they are dumb people bying it there are goimng to be smart ones selling them   pls don't try start an argument with because i am really into tech and going to oblitarate you in an argument  the smart ones knowes already that i am right bye
Well it could have been titled how I phone is superior in every way than Android phones
Talking only in terms of US, UK, Canada etc market doesn't make it a fair winner. This is probably the most biased rating, there are so many downsides of Apple which was ignored just like that. Android takes it home "Hands Down". Apple build's an ecosystem around themselves and make people follow them where as Android gives what people wants.
no drop test
I put this video in the category: continue asking about iphone until it gets at least a draw ...
iOS all way
No one cares anymore.. These are old arguments..
I have been having an issue with the main camera on my S21 ultra the camera is blurry it doesn't auto correct but if i zoom to x3 or higher the image is fine. Any information on this i have been reading that seems to have happened with the latest update and Samsung told me i had to replace the camera for $250 very disappointed with Samsung.
Apple and eco friendly 🤡 Wtf are you talking about?
*cough* sponsored by Apple *cough*
What Marques meant was "...it's only because I'm beholden to apple, and I don't want to be cut off." Apple is so poor for the user experience. (swiping gestures) and always at least 2 years behind on good ideas. I wish apple would make a device with android. I know that sounds stupid, but that hardware with android software and development would be epic!
I am a complete noob when it comes to this comparison but MK (whoever he is) seemed completely biased and the other dude seemed restrictive while conveying something which was contradictory to the other guy. Not a good video for someone like me.
what a straight forward biased video. wow.
Quality video as usual, thanks for sharing!
Marques knows whats up
One of the core aspects that got swept under the rug a little bit in the eco section is: On average, an android users buys a new phone every 2 years, while iPhone users have their phones for about 4. It makes sense that software updates are rather limiting on android devices, because people know you're going to want that next phone doing your niche even better than the last, while iPhones don't particularly cover any niche, they're just good all around.   Personally used android phones for most of my life, because I always wanted cameras with fancy features. So every other year, sometimes every third year some phone would appear with boom, now 64mp, now 128mp and I'd buy into that..  I eventually switched to the 12 pro max when that came out and think I take - on average - better photos on the 12mp main shooter just because the software does the adjusting for me. Furthermore, I've been using the phone for a year now and it still just oozes a premium feel, I don't see myself upgrading to the 14 when that comes up, but perhaps the 15 or 16.  Also how can you ever go back from face id? The convenience is just absurd
I really want to know what music that is in the 'assistant' chapter' Someone please help
Good or bad use what you like ☺️
I use oppo and its fine
He's bias to iPhone I have a android and a iPhone and I prefer android over iPhone it's not all that
wtf is going here in  display samsung always ahead
Has been an iPhone user for years and I was sure that iPhone was gonna 🥇 win
I felt like the pillars conversation of utility went more with the huge demand that comes from apple users rather than looking at utility vs utility. Unfortunate but i get it.
Android vs iOS used to be a discussion 10 years ago. Back then, Android phones were the enthusiast's choice, because they were more customizable, had more user friendly features like removable battery covers, microSD card slots etc. they were much easier to root and install custom firmware on, the Android Market had way more free apps than the Apple app store... Whereas iPhone was for people who wanted their phone to be a status symbol. The little Apple logo was a sign of prestige. Nowadays, the experience is kinda the same on both systems, since other companies just keep copying Apple, sadly, and repeating their anti-consumer policies of removing feature by feature and taking more and more control away from the user.
20:07 that was a bit of an awkward handshake!
This is a joke.
iPhone would be easier but my opinion would iPhone
For phones, I'm always Android. Tablets IOS to go with....
Don't even gotta watch the video to see how biased it's going to be.
Mkbhd was sooooo biased here. How is he even saying the iPhone 13 pro max is close to the Samsung.  Also comparing to all of android you’d need to include the iPhone SE otherwise that’s unfair.  He was also super quiet and in a weird mood here.  I felt like mrwhsoethrboss was shocked.  This whole video made me sad. As a former android user currently on iPhone it made me want to go back. I hate hate hate the idea of a world where apple is the dominant smartphone maker.
MKBHD is DISHONEST indeed.
To the uninitiated, they'd immediately use this video as a reference for "IPHONE IS BETTER HA TAKE THAT ANDROID USERS", but I'd argue they're missing the point or rather, the points that are mentioned by both whosetheboss and Marques.   In comparison, apple or iOS will be better on averages than android. They will just be more consistent with their features, and more reliable in most scenarios than "Android." But the key in every one of these ten categories, is that an Android phone was mentioned but excluded from the conversation because it was an "extreme". And that's why the final point is so important, options truly are why android will forever be a contender against iPhones. In its girth of options, Android carries an extreme that dominates in these specific fields. There's an Android phone that takes 4k, STUNNING photos. There's an Android phone that can compete with iPhones on videography. There's an Android that blows the roof off with its battery life. For every one of these categories, an Android phone takes it to the extreme. You may not have an Android that can do all of it well, but you will have one that does it "best."   iPhones win the game of averages and that's why it has more points in this conversation, but android, and here's my hot take, will forever win the game of extremes.
The most baids b******* interviewer I've seen on YouTube yet please don't know anything they're talking about 🤦🏾‍♂️
I didn't know iphone had ram
I like both but preffer android
For Screen you forgot that the LCD for the samsung s22 Ultra was also made in partner with Wacom technologies and has more capabilities in regards to touch compared to Apple.
It doesn’t seem you are comparing, looks like two brokers are advertising an IPhone.  Compare android with IOS. Compare IPhone with and android phone. Compare price,  advantage we get. You are comparing a phone with an operating system. Hope both of get paid well. Android is much more better in day to day life. If you are a hard user, you bettery Heath will drop day by day. Truly speaking,  using an android for one years,  battery is still performing as new. I Don't have think that my bettery life will be reduced if I am hard user.
Pov: you're only watching but you don't have one 😢
I feel like apple is like that one student who brings his work past the term, after waiting to see what mistake other's make trying to catch up with the deadline, but then teacher decide, hey his job seems better and prize it as the best instead. Seems kinda unfair🤔
MKBHD dickriding apple is unreal
The one on the left is biased AF !!!
Picked up a new 64 Gig 12 Mini a few months back from AT&T for $315. Would have preferred to stay with Android, but was tired of giants. No regerts. and this thing SMOKES. yes, would have preferred the 128 13 mini, but not at twice the price.
andoroid is better
In my country iphone become status symbol
hahaha all the android users are crying rn who bloody cares it’s preference
The s20 ultra is the best for camera wise
I can run gaming emulators on my phone like wii u wii ps2 if I can get a emulator I can play it on my phone I have the s21 I can hook up my ps4 controller too it and such smooth game play androids were defiantly better for gaming
I really like the comparison "well the s22 ultra is better, but we will give the points to Apple". It's funny how even if you compare the s22 ultra vs iPhone 13 pro, everyone says that you can do the same on the iPhone and yet to do that you have to BUY those functionalities for Apple store, am I the only one who thinks that that pushes the price of the phone, which makes it unfair comparison.
Android is the best everyone has iPhone now a days reminds me of iPhone prisoners lol
Loving this collab! I personally prefer android! iPhone does have some nice features, tried it, but I would never switch!
Biased
I think it's funny how Apple didn't think of making the oculus 2 charger Apple not Samsung
New title for this video "Why are iphones better than androids" lol I'm an android user btw.
They knew if they went samsung v apple it wouldn't end well...
As much as I like MKBHD you can tell he's been very used to IPhone his whole life so his decisions usually leans to Apple
2.5 v 7.5? Judging from Samsungs S21 user experience not like it's the latest model or like Samsung's the only android flagship. I think all Android companies should merge together to come up with a flagship and call it android. Cause there's a lot of android phones that can't even be called "smart" phones. Even with Samsung's video stabilization feature and pixels clear camera on smaller companies. Well I guess Iphones worth the hype tho🥱🥱😴 What do I know about all these comparison lol 😅😅😅 Just loving the satisfaction of pixels
When nerds hang out, talk nerd things, and are brilliant in their "nerdness."  It's good to be a nerd.
Fot longevity, Apple takes the cake.
Are those phones or tablets they're holding? Ridiculous phone sizes nowadays!
I'm a bit disappointed by the blunt bias on various points... I work with both platforms daily, but this point distribution is so sad...
I will like to have one soon
iPhone is the best
Still think android wins
Giving iphone the point for eco consciousness looking at their repairability is not fair in my opinion. Apple likes to look aco consciousness but in fact they arent.
20:08 - anyone noticed MK tried punch after hand shake but Arun just didn't notice 😂😂
There are a lot of features you can find on Android phones that you can't on an iPhone... IR blaster, FM radio, Headphone jack. But the biggest benefit by far an I'm SHOCKED you didnt cover it as freedom with APPs, you talked about software support but the biggest thing for using a smartphone is the apps, and that goes so far in favor of android. And I can tell you didn't agree with several of MKBHD choices lol
First one
What anout the lawsuite that there gettibg in Europe about the chargers?
"As always neither Apple nor any other brand was given copy approval or editorial input concerning this video, the opinions contained herein are mine only, So I ask you to subscribe to Mrmobile on youtube , Stay mobile my friends" - Michael Fisher
Android is best
First point of contention: Display. Samsungs is clearly better, but lets make it a tie anyways. What are you even doing.
Value wise I would have based it on how long I could theoretically utilise the phone and divide the cost over that.  Sure, get some great value for money out of cheaper androids, but will they have the same support and usability after 6-7 years?
Android has a version of airdrop and it has been around for longer than actual airdrop I think just no one uses it.
Hate apple for to many reasons to list I've always preferred android and specifically Samsung devices I've never been disappointed ans I use all the features the phone has to offer and being able to connect to my TV seamlessly and display things at will is fantastic also being able to control my TV while I use my phone is another bonus
This has a touch of bias in it.
Where is xiaomi?
Eco-conscious LOL
I love my pixel 3xl but google stopped updating the software and security.  Is there a safe way to install new operating system
I've been using Androids my entire life and I've never ever used a single widget. Some people might, but definitely not me.
It is only a choice of one person that is MKHDD or SDD whatever he is.. There is no comparison in this video..
Fully sponsored by Apple
Eco Conscious 😂🤣😂
Do aq fair comparison google pixel vs iPhone. bunk the samsung.
Android forever
20:07 MKBHD wanted to give a box after the handshake
I want to plug my phone to my pc add files to it and extract files from it. Like photos, music and documents. I want it as painless as possible. What phone  Should I buy?
I think that android has better camera but i use both phones and i like both
I like how throwing away an entire phone is more eco friendly than fixing the phone.
EDIT:  Android vs IOS EDIT EDIT:  S22 Ultra vs IPhone 13 Pro EDIT EDIT EDIT: Samsung vs Apple    Samsung S22 Ultra 🏆
lmfao 2 of the biggest sheeps. Mrsheepthefraud xD
This video is a joke haha Samsung s22 ultra is way better than iphone.
So technically speaking, this isn't a comparison between Android and IOS, it's a comparison between Samsung and Apple.
dont play like this iphone
Android better
i really dont agree
Just the 5 year software support makes the iphone better value for money. during those 5 years you would go through 2-3 android phones if software support and security is important to you.
As both an android and ios user, ios is definitely better.
I just use both. iphone for gaming. android for other things
People here aren't ready to give iPhone the win, iPhone definitely surpassed android when iPhone 12 and 13 came. And the argument about usb c, personally its not that hard to carry 2 cables.
Samsung = 10.5, Android = 8.5, IPhone = 0.5 Samsung win
Android is best!!!
Headphone jack. & It's nice to see you two comparing phones together. So fun.
Don't see how eco-friendly can go to apple with their repairability or lack of especially from third-party repair shops
Oh yes performance on an iphone is great!.... for the first 10 min then the termal throttling is atrocious
everyone's saying they're biased and wrong , but don't explain or can argue with their points ? i think for majority of people if they learned the iphone ops they'd prefer the smoother experience overall despite the lack of customization everyone's crying about
I think you guys are not biased, you clearly are isheeps and do not - will never see the advantages of Samsung phones. Battery, multitask, camera, charging, design, memory, open system are way better on Samsung phones than it is on iphone, but you will never admit it.
this was straight up bs
Jesus, MKBHD is one biased guy. Even when the camera in the Samsung is miles ahead, he is behind Apple.
2 baby daddy's 💜
15:48 ok, I know other Samsung's can do this, there are settings (think it's called 'roaming clock') where you tap the clock while on your lock screen, and it opens up a section of widgets for a variety of things (you can select what widgets appear and what order theyre in). there's a widget to show: the temperature, your alarms, your calendar, your screen usage for the day so far. ever been listening to music on spotify then you have to pause it to go do something, and by the time you can continue listening, the spotify thing on the lockscreen is gone? well there's a widgets for that too!. ever wondered what second you're currently on in the current minute? probably not, but you can see that too!!!
12:54 airdrop? quick share. Nat as catchy name, same damn thing. facetime? google duo. I would even consider duo to be better because it has filters similar to a snapchat call.
I don't know of other Androids do this, or even other smasungs, but my a21s has a feature where, if you double click the off button it opens any set app... it's set to the camera app by default, which you can use while the phones locked...
For me, it is android all the way. Samsung S series uses states of the arts technology and the curved screen is a turn on  since the s6 edge era. Android is easy to navigate and use friendly. Some apps in iPhone are not the responsive, notably Simtool kit. Mrwhosetheboss I always love your  videos keep up with the good job, and I was pleased to see Margues Brownlee as your co-host.
Personally i feel this video has seriously mislead the layman who is not into specs. Arun if you're reading this please do reconsider. I trust you from your initial reviews to date. I know you have no monetary incentives/interests.
12:50 what about snapdrop on android? u told us about it and ur pretending it doesn't exist? 🤔. Sorry, i dont want to b e mean or snything... I personally trust Arun but its just strange this video.
Here's what I think happened: Apple convinced them to generally down-talk android so more laymen would switch to iPhone. Was truly shocked after watching literally all mrwhosetheboss's phone videos at least 3 - 4 times. Kinda sad.
Being a long time watcher of mrwhosetheboss, something just isn't right here... in addition, he's in apple's hq. Kinda sad he's giving up on android
Marc rebillet was right
-Rep
For OS. iPhone is smoother
ios is overall better but s22 ultra design is just too gud XD
Mkbhd : apple gives more customisation than Android ☕😂😂
had the samsung s7 edge for about 5 years and now use an iphone. the main thing that made me switch was apple’s longtime support for their devices when it came to software updates and i was a student then, so i don’t have the money to keep buying a new phone to upgrade often. i’m in waaay too deep into the apple ecosystem to leave it now, but i wouldn’t mind making the switch i again. i just upgraded my iphone again, but man samsung is pulling me in with their galaxy series again.
I like apple more because it seems like a lot more newer
It’s not android vs iOS Its Samsung s22 ultra vs iPhone 13 pro max
Way too biased comparison The screen is a tie Dafuq where they smoking??
idgaf about the scores i just watched the whole video to see if the ratio was whole numbers or not
What do you mean it is sharp the resolution?
Seconds later than 16:00 in, talking about iOS 16 widgets, with the scoreboard reading 1/6
7 to 2 yeah nice comparison 😂
I still don't get why some Android manufacturer hasn't just paid for the social media compnies to optimize their app for their phones so the photos would look better. Think about the marketing: the camera than actually looks good, even i Snapchat
I think its like Android has a phone for everyone and iPhone is the phone for everyone.
Damn all these Samsung fanboys getting butt hurt just because he likes iPhone over Samsung? 🤦🏽‍♂️
Samsung is the best apple sucks
How is apple photos better
He's best
Lies
Hey!x3 i never spend any money to buy things on android. Say apps.🥴🥴😂😂 Everything is free
I hoped it was OS vs OS only but 1st item is literally screen lol
Why iPhone is always better 🤣🤣🤣
I Vote Samsung Galaxy s22 Plus 💪
Well.. Please add sponsored video on the side... Like you usually do... Feels like this one deserves the tag 😏
its always android ppl hating on apple product.. how come? i have a iphone but i still love android to.. the freedom to customize and do things in android is awsome
You missed a lot of categories. • Flashlight brightness • Shipping speed • Accessories • With how much % of battery it's being shipped • Hardware
Why they don't use Huawei honor as  Comparison?      I know Huawei has been having problems  between  Canada and USA    But the expects on the camera and other furnitures  Is blowing my mind
lol i got an ad of mrwhosetheboss whilst watching mrwhosetheboss. is he sponsoring himself?!
The screen goes to Samsung IDC what y'all say, they have higher resolution and higher brightness while the iPhone is just smoother and let's talk about how they skipped the assistant part and that also goes to android and the camera part should go to both since android nails photos while iPhone nails videos, and the battery should go to both since android has fast charging and iPhone has long battery (personal opinion btw)
i bought an iphone 13 pro...i regret it
My dude is an apple sucker lmao 🤣
Glad you are sticking with S21 Marques  One of best phones ever
But MKBHD told that he'd pick the Samsung over the iPhone in the WIRED interview 🤔 and that he's main SIM card is in the Samsung 🤔🤔
If I hear these guys say iPhone one more time I'm gonna throw up. I was expecting a better comparison to be completely honest. This is a dam iPhone advertisment. It's clear who buys Mks Tesla's. Mr. Who's the boss didn't boss anyone around in this. Can't even open a PDF on a iphone for Christ sake.
Sorry to say but this was very biased
Describe this in one sentence. It is completely unbiased people trust me I'm not lying, it justified it's title which is ACTUALLY better? but please don't emphasize on ACTUALLY.
Android: imperfect in its perfectness.  Iphone: perfect in its imperfectness.   I am both android and iphone user.
In America  we don't  much choice  samsung  or apple flagship  phone are good. In other countries  many flagship  phone we can choice.  Vivi oppo xiaomi those made good and cheap android phones. Huawei made very good flagship phone almost  killed  samsung and apple. That is the reason  Huawei be hunting down  by America.
Is samsung that bad when it compares to Apple? I don't trust you guys again
The annoying part of iphone it’s that’s very expensive, has prices over a M1 laptop & you get almost same shit every year, like when it lounches they all say oh what great cpu it has, what great cam but it’s almost same stuff, they say better battery, but they give you some updates & even the new iphone 14 battery will cry again, like all over the net is how to turn stuff off just to save a bit of more juice
i got an ad with Mrwhostheboss in the start of the video
The only thing this video shows me is how much biased MKBHD is for iPhone
Display : Android (Samsung) is better. Equal point is not acceptable Battery : What iphone is Better Battery, Seriously  🤭😳????  This is Unbelievable  Complete Video is Unacceptable... You are showing Iphone is Better. It is not True. Only on performance wise, Iphone is Better. Other than that Android is better than Iphone.
5:35 LMAO! Definitely sponsored by Apple! 😂
I don't believe him when he says he takes photos with a pixel and then finds the picture hasn't been saved. That never happens.
Very biased and apple bought review! I own both systems iphone 12 and recently bought the s22 base and will admit that android is better overall. From split screen multitasking to super fast transfer speeds with usb-c. You guys defeated lost some points with this video.
Ios is very complicated to use
12:54 Android does have a equivalent to Airdrop: Nearby share. But in my exprience is it not that well.  Samsung itself does have an alternative too, Quick share. It worked better for me than Nearby Share. 14:36 ...and Bixby on Samsung itself 😂 (who  the hell does it use?)
Android rules
I switched from iOS to Android (S20Ultra) early 2019 after using iPhones since the 2G.  For the first time, I have kept the same phone for so long and its time for a new phone. Tbh, I have been thinking going back to iOS lately but I am not sure either.  I kinda miss the "simplicity" of iOS but at the same time, there are a few small things I do on Android that as far as I know are not available on iOS.  Another big key factor is the battery life and on Android in order to achieve a great battery life, you have to tweak quite a few things, which tbh is kinda meh, plus the phone wont last me even 10 hours with heavy use.  I am on of those people that cant be outside of the house and feel like my battery wont last, it stresses me and makes me not feel safe.    From what I can tell, iPhone 13 Pro Max is a clear winner on that department.   So yeah, the same old debate, what will be my next phone? Go iPhone 13 Pro Max? S22 Ultra? Wait for the iPhone 14 Pro Max or the new Samsung flagship (I assume, it will be the S23 Ultra)?
It is not really to what the person prefer. It is to if he had used this or that before. For me, I was using only nokia and switched to samsung afterwards thinking I prefer those. But when my sister insist that I have to buy an iPhone, game changer. Most reliable phone ever. simple yet great. It doesn't stress you with a lot of this and that. I have stick to apple since.
I will just buy the phone which is more affordable but still comfortable to use . Phone are too expensive now.  May be a Xiaomi. Good phone, good specs, affordable.
you forgot the most important aspect ....PRICE
all comparision to Android goes to SAMSUNG only? touch sample rate is AMAZING on RED MAGIC 6 and above!  Sony Still carry HEADPHONE JACK And SDCARD SUPPORT ON FLAGSHIPS, i don't know why youtubers are Biased toward ios I always feel hidden agenda in such videos!!!
You’re comparing flagship vs flagship only when it suits Apple? Why?
Android vs iPhone rating Display - 0.5 : 0.5 Performance - 0 : 1 Battery - 0 : 1 Photography - 0: 1 Videography - 0 : 1 Eco conscious - 0 : 1 Reliability - 0.5 : 0.5 Software features - 0.5 : 0.5 Software support - 0 : 1 Pricing - 1 : 0 Total - 2.5 : 7.5
Android vs iPhone? 😂 It should be either Pixel vs iPhone or Android vs iOS This was a really unfair comparision to be honest.
What did you use to record this video? That’s what phone you think is best. 😌
This was by far the most enraging video for an Android user, they messed up big time
Arun Please stop making videos with him, because Marques objective credibility is staying heavily behind on this "Android VS Iphone" Video. You have over 250k👍 Likes and 30k👎 Dislikes, but usually with 4-5Million Klicks you only should've 10.000 Dislikes. That's because of the fact, that this was indeed a biased based video, preferred for Apples Iphones. I will bet everything, that you and him got paid for this from Apple. I can't trust your and his opinion anymore, if you keep going with this kind of biased content
How Apple could beat all phones in my opinion, make a larger community to add features that everyone wants, sleeker design, that's basically from what I can think of, just a community giving ideals and those used like per say Minecraft does it gives what people want, giving more than me making a giant list.
These 2 know nothing lmao
Video is sponsored by Iphone ....lol
I switched to Apple because I’m mad that Samsung only puts the QHD+ in the Ultra phones now. I DON’T WANT A HUGE PHONE!!! Love my iPhone 13 Pro!
I left Android phone usage, especially Samsung, years ago because of bloat. I went to iPhone because of smoothness and device support length and never looked back. Wish Android did the same
Display: Samsung literally makes the display for both phones! I guess a tie is fair.
We can't call the screen category a draw!😤
I don’t understand why so many people are arguing in the comments when it’s just personal choice & taste 😤
This was a bad one Arun. For some reason I believe that you were finding it hard to agree with MKBHD, but were simply agreeing to not offend him or something.  How can google assistant being smarter and having more functionality and marques actually using it, while him saying he never uses siri be a tie for both assistants?  Stick to your usual wow videos and stop collaborating with biased people.
Say you're an Apple fanboy while trying to appear unbiased
Want to switch to android, but unfortunately locked myself to iOS buying an apple watch
Waste of time... got bored once I realised how biased this guy is. Once he said he liked the slab boring shape with sharp edges, I knew what the end result would be .
As a person who plays a lot of games on my android, I honestly prefer iPhone because when I used to have a iPhone, it never lagged for me. Now it's normal for my phone to lag. But still, my android is okay, but I would like to switch to iphone.
from going from a S10 to a 13 pro was easily the worst decision I've ever made this phone sucks
In apple. There is a limitation. Android has freedom. Android is easy to use. It is more user friendly
But in price apple is always defeat than any android phones
Being able to listen to an iPhone video while using your map program to go to work it's a godsend since you guys work from home you don't know what that is
Android got more features than the iPhone. Enough said.
Thank god I can afford both so I have 13 pro and a pixel 6. No need to stoop to fanboyism.
Yeaaaa, MKBHD took over this video.. I feel it was very biased. And not based on raw features instead of opinions…
Surely the Eco category comes down to how long a phone lasts, and you just have to look at resale value to see that iPhone takes that award.
You broke my heart
I'll give him the doubt benefit, maybe he wanted to write "Android vs Iphone - which one is better FOR US" but he forgot to mention it, or maybe he forgot to mention that it was a sponsored video. In any case this video is biased.  I think I'll stick to gsmarena for my objective reviews and leave the subjective suckers apart.  BTW that tiny fraction of users who care about tinkering with their phones makes the majority of your viewers.
apple for life
Iphone is simply better overall I have used both I'm using Android right and can't wait to get an iphone again it's just simply better
I like both of these companies been longer with Apple
I must say that Marques really shocked me with his really weird anti Android stance. I have iPhone 13 Pro Max and Galaxy 22 Ultra and I really love both phones and find them both a piece of art in their own ways but if I was forced to select only one I would take Galaxy 22 Ultra. People of his statue shouldn't be so obviously biased
There's a whole lot of factors from one OS over the other, but here's my take on it. Take it with a grain of salt, as my opinion doesn't matter to anyone but myself.  iOS: It's incredibly stable considering it's built only for iphones, compared to Android which has to work on God knows how many other devices. The ecosystem is nice, the UI is nice, the design language that iOS uses is incredible, everything works with each other near flawlessly.  Android: Unlike iOS, Android on the vast majority of devices has unparalleled customization compared to iOS. You can easily sideload apps without the OS automatically removing it, you can change your launcher if you're not happy with it, you can change your theme, and (on most androids, minus the US variants of Samsung phones), you can install custom roms, which allow you to pretty much let you experience a whole new device on the one you already own. Not to mention there's so many different designs, quirks, and budgets for anyone in the market.  So in my opinion, I personally like to swing towards android more than iOS. It's not as connected compared to Apple, but the fact that I can customize pretty much whatever I want whenever I want with next to no repercussions makes the vast majority of Android devices more appealing than what iOS has to offer.
You should have done this video with me, Android would have won
Hey,
Based.
>Display being a tie  I don't even have to watch the rest of the video to know this will be incredibly biased toward Apple. Disappointing.
The screen conversation is incredible... The Galaxy is SO much better, and that flipping notch?? Who can justify that?? 🤣
MKBHD is a apple fan boy he would never give anything to samsung
The thing about iPhone is once you're in the ecosystem you're in the ecosystem so I get why they both feel the way that they do about it. If Dave 2D was here Android would have had a Fighting Chance
Guyz both has to be excellent in their way...
The lighting cable sucks  No iphone
You let him decide  all the ratings?
This video is bs.
MKB is a fukin apple fanboy you will never get him to speak negatively on apple products.
I'm confused about this video, whose opinion is more important, Marques's opinion or Aaron's?
such video always ends with 'if you are .... then this is better, if you on the other hand ...then that is better"
I like both creators and their content. But this is nuts. Whatever particular issue matters to you can be found better on an Android device, except iMessage, which is why people stay with iPhone. IPhone is antiquated, expensive, extremely heavy and unwieldy and the screens are no better than mediocre (in the universe of device screens). But iMessage makes all of that irrelevant.
you are literally just giving points away to iPhone, for no reason.
You needed to give Marques a mic I can't hear him correctly, amateurs!
It's all about the grip, ladies you know the score
Android = quantity over quality
iPhone = quality over quantity
Art is anything people do with distinction
Simplicity and naturalness are the truest marks of distinction
Vocês são os melhores, juntos então!! 😉 Um forte abraço de seu fã brasileiro 🤝👏👏
The Note or ultra android is a ALL in one device.  Iphone is a ecosystem phone good for instagram things like that.  And the pics usually better on Top android phone the Note. I know I have old Note 10 plus my friends newer iPhones they always want my pics🙄. Both great and expensive but get way more for the money with android 🤷🏾‍♂️
This is the thing about these type of comparisons. They only compare things that iPhone does well.  But the boat load of things options that Android does they IGNORE. Usually because iPhone don't even have the option 🙄
I appreciate the iPhone, but I honestly stay on Android for so long because it's definitely more affordable. Phones can be cheaper, repairs are cheap as well, spare parts aren't that expensive. I think taking into account also Play store vs App store, since App store stuff is generally more expensive is a thing. ALSO. Very important is compatibility - people with an Apple setup can be more comfortable with an iPhone, but PC users.. can't really use all the perks of iPhones unless they get such a setup. Which is.. much more costly. So yeah, I think those are aspects that didn't get touched on much.
The dream collab!! ;oo
If you live in Russia or other restricted or sanctioned country, not being able to download and install an .apk file is a big deal. Recently, many companies' apps have been purged from the App store because of the sanctions. This is not a big problem for Android users, but for iOS it is. Another big deal for me is being able to completely turn off GPS location services, I always do it to conserve battery, only turn it on to navigate in new places.
This is not comparison 😅 This is apple advertisement 😂
It is a personal preference when it comes to the phones.
apks, custom everything, insane developer support, latest hot technologies  go android and don't look back
I am so maniac of " useless " features, I mean I love them. It allow me to do a lot of things which I can find need one time in my life. (I am writing this with my S8+, it is full of technology and I love all of them, even if you can find them useless I can find them useful in some way, because I use them :)  The main thing which i regret in IOS is that we can't install APK easily I am used to install MOD apk sometimes so it's a big STOP for me.  There are some apps which are available in ios and not in android, and same in the opposite.
Android has freedom in everything,
iPhone
HILFEEE, dachte des wird endlich nh gescheite objektive Diskussion, aber das is ja Quatsch
No apple pay vs Samsung?
C'mon i want to see you try to overclock your iphone
Umm this was an apple sponsor ship?
Dude... 20% left after 24hrs? Bruh my note 10s battery can last over 28hrs and still being left 35%
Guys remember that the GPU does a ton of work and geek bench just benchmarks the cpu...
Android and Xiaomi are top notch, specially for price
well damn
He is just a major iphone fanboy
While iPhones do have a slight edge in some of the areas discussed, the final score was vastly lopsided in apples favor, at least in my personal opinion !
Two DC fans comparing Marvel and DC.🔥
Nobody questions what line of work that I need a A13 or a S22? My coworkers like to play games during an hour lunch, and I like to watch porn during lunch.
Can tell apple fan energy radiating from marcus while arun is actually considering the factors of what makes a flagship good.
Personally as a retail phone salesman i ugre most people to stay away from apple. Not because its bad products or anything, but because its extremely overpriced when compared to all other smartphones. Apple always tries to manipulate you further into their flashy ecosystem with products that has low compatability with anything else and often has much lower quality. (as with airpods) Also tech stores bleed when selling apple. Even with insurance we don't break even. Apple as a company is just greed hidden under a flashy brand made to target shallow teen´s need for status and also old people who don't know how to use anything a little more complicated. They do offer simplicity and innovation, but not enough to justify their products price range. Also the locked apple system makes them less valueble than most android phones i think.
If you wanted to do a REAL versus video, you should of collabed with Flossy Carter
How stagnant is the phone market when usb c is a major discussion point.
Clearly a bias argument going on here lads
Most people just like iPhone because there sheeps but when it comes down to it Samsung or android as you can say is superior
I’ve used to get performance/ software issues all the time on Samsung phones, switched to ios and it happened like twice in 2 years
16:46 I thought apple did software support for 7 years 😳
Seems more like an Iphone Marketing. Disappointed!
I love my meta quest 2. Everyone needs one now
Interesting.   I’m an iPhone user and have toyed with getting a Samsung.  I hear the users on Android say things like split screen is so useful and yet I couldn’t see it being any use to me. Funny how these two don’t use it.
This video brings one indisputable fact; you ain't the boss, Marques is.
I love this Thank you gentlemen , God bless you  !
Don't agree with most of the verdict. In all Apple feels like "less freedom" at cost of high privacy
Marquez is an apple fanboy. I expected this.
Android keyboard so much better
This is why I like flossy Carter as a tech reviewer he's not biased like these two are toward apple. I understand preference but when you do a video like this you can't be biased
I love android
How much is apple paying you Marques? lol
@Mrwhosetheboss you didn't pound it man smh!!
Bro I just switched to iOS and it’s no way that apple is this much better than android than your score says it is. Lol. I like my Samsung so much better
People who pick Android over iPhone are probably either really engaged in phones and have the necessity of a freedom aspect or have been with Android for a really long time. But people who pick iPhone over Android probably like the simplicity and graceful design that also comes with a nice diverse system full of features. Or they’re young, 25 lower or something lol. This comment was written on an iPhone 13 Pro Max but I’ve also seen and played with the Samsung Galaxy S22+ Ultra so I am NOT biased.
you kinda forgot lot of things, for iMessage which is still stuck with SMS on Android we have Google Message which use RCS and this is way better for sending uncompressed pictures and videos very fast, both of them have end to end encryption.    For IOS facetime, Google have Duo and this is basically the same thing... peoples are more use of facetime because duo happen later... thing i don't use very much on both. Then there is USB C who can go to 240 watts against a not really 29 watts for the lighting port, USB C can send sound like dolby atmos and DTS-X also 8k videos to HDMI and the transfer rate USB C 3.1 gen 2 can go to 40Gbps against the lighting port max 480Mbps which a very HUGE difference and more important if you take 4k/8k video.  Well i can go on and on and on to drop you ''score'' from Apple winner to Apple loser. Even on camera and video.  So your video is irrelevant to even say you 2 both don't know what your talking about.  I repair (owner company), test and own all kind of OS cell phone since the last 12 years so your are both just kids in a sandbox square. your popularity on YouTube doesn't make you real expert.
Still using note 9 here 512GB 😎
This is BULLSHIT Android 9.5 IOS just 0.5..PLEASE IGNORE THIS CHANNEL because it's a Apple rant!!!!!
I love this guy's videos and have been watching since 2018 but it's unfortunate how they focused on iPhone's strong points and left out some of Android's strong points as well. It's also extremely unfair to make this video Android vs iOS because iOS is just on iPhones while android is on several phones, some astonishing, some horrible. They should've picked a battle like Samsung Android vs Apple iOS. It should of been a fair fight, but it sadly wasn't. I also don't like how they left out a lot of Android's features like USB-C, newer technology and tricks, and features like Quad HD displays that perform amazing. Very unfortunate and disappointing to see Mrwhosetheboos and Marques do it like this; felt very bias and unfair.  To keep going further, Arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while Marques was on here, he was more accepting and less opposing to him, showing bias as he is a fan of MKBHD. To keep going even further, they also stretched out points in favour for Apple by a lot, like the Software Support, which yes Apple has Facetime, iMessage, and more, Samsung and Android are greatly improving their technology; and Google message is to Apple's level too. I feel like this video should've had an as wide focus on Androids features then it did with iPhone features.  Great videos, but I'm very disappointed unfortunately, and this comes from someone who used iPhone and Android for years.  >> Final thoughts: This was very bias  towards Apple, this video should've not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it. This video was a comparison on sole facts, so don't stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other. This was expected with Marques unfortunately because he has very strong ties with Apple which grows his bias towards them immensely, and that is undeniable fact.
This was just a pure joke.. I respect yall but this is a joke😂😂😂
Apple Destroyed Android, that proves Apple is better
iPhone stability and optimization wins it. Tbh it is more so iOS is better than Android.
The iPhone SE is a dumpster fire, better off just buying a iPhone 12 Mini
I have both Android (Samsung) and Iphone and I can say without doubt that Samsung is superior in almost all aspects or probably all aspects than Iphone. I honestly don't understand why the influencers insist to sell the opposite.
I mean, one could objectively call one better than the other, but I did not expect them to lean towards iphones that much.
I love these reviewers but this is so biased, there is little to no consistency. In some category they consider all android phones and in some categories they specifically only consider the Samsung. You cannot effectively compare an iPhone to Android OS. This was not helpful and is a poor comparison from two excellent reviewers.
I would talk about two things here . Firstly This video actually isn't about Android v iPhone , it's more about MKBHD's opinion which is actually his personal opinion not in general people's , secondly In this video you guys talked about everything but what actually matters in daily life and reality
I think the se 2022 is very useless. I mean for 50$ more you can get a 12 mini or for 70$ less a refurbished 12 mini
This video randomly popped in my video suggestions. Decided to watch it and I immediately remembered why I unsubscribed from both of these channels.
Imagine getting paid millions of dollars to sit around and talk about cell phones while I go to work every day. 😂😂
I've got a problem with my s22 ultra .The battery life should be about 9-8 hours on normal usage amd mine hardly goes by 4-5 hours the battery really does fall fast and the phone is brand new  can someone help
Feels like waching apple sponsored video.
MKBHD has always been an Apple fan. Biased.
Either it’s android vs ios or Galaxy S22 ultra vs Iphone 13 pro.  Rest of the names are misleading
Favorite duo ♥️ Legends🔥🔥
I mean I don't know if this comparison could be called fair coz that dude said Samsung has a better display like even when they reviewed it they said themselves that it had the best display but it was stil a draw and even though I agree on battery and performance but I completely disagree on camera one whenever you guy's do a comparison between them you always choose Samsung like I don't even understand what's happening
I hate the iphone user interface experience.
Droid, I care nothing about I phones ,dude is just iPhone fan
4 phones vs 300 phones sure!
This video was not honest
😳 awkward. You love to see an  underdog story but, jeez
I think to compare apple to android doesn’t make sense , say apple vs Samsung or apple Vs google  or google vs Samsung . That’s a much better and proper comparison
I'm just wondering why this video was even made. The name of the video should have been "2 Apple fan boys pretend to compare IOS and Android". I'm an iOS user but I still wish you would just stop making these videos. It's not interesting to watching you two brown nose Apple for 10 mins. The out come is so predictable it's rediculus. Stick to what you love and just do videos on Iphones and how much you love them
Great collab guys. Informative and still entertains the personal/subjective side of the debate
I believe it to be a little unfair to compare the best Iphone with the avarage of all of android, the avarage by deffinition will be way below top class, as it is in between the worst and the best, you should do company vs company, or factor in the other iphones.
Marques is just an apple fanboy. If android does something better there’s always a “but” for apple to tie it lmao
I've never met anyone that uses Dex other than me. I use it for having a bigger screen when an app doesn't allow casting to my TV. Honestly, its really useful in situations.
Got to say Mr Whosetheboss.. You were the amateurish contributor to this ... er.. conversation. MKBHD is across his game. His analysis is for the people you are for yourself....
I like how when Androids users disagree they publicly humiliate opinions. Clowns fr
Got a lot of petty haters of Apple in this comment section, there is a reason why Apple users keep coming back. Reliability. We all have our own preferences, and there is no WRONG answer when it comes to choosing a device. But there are POOR choices. Choose responsibly, choose Reliability.
The whole "which is better" argument is very subjective and varies from person to person.  Person A may like the iphone's battery life, integrated ecosystem, and smooth experience.  Person B may like android's customization, freedom of choice, or features.  Neither is "wrong", it's just personal choice.    You see alot of fanboys on both sides saying that one is clearly the winner over the other, but the truth is they are both pretty awesome at this point.  Personally, I love the competition - it keeps both products improving to outdo the other and the winner is the consumer.
The perfomance goes to android,like you weren't talking about Samsung or iPhone you were comparing android or iPhone,so performance is for android since asus rog is android and, about battery I still think it would go to android or it would be a draw
Iphones suck for so many reasons... its only the status associated  with it... that makes people buy it...!!!!!  Samsung flagships are hands down winner!!!! Most user friendly phones... great customisations...!!!
He's brainwashed tricker
Me personally I’ve been a Samsung use for years I used the Samsung note 10 and I switched to iOS and iOS is Mitch smoother and software and hardware is better on iOS ,speakers are better on iOS in general I feel like iOS is better
love your content bro really enlightening and the collaboration of the two of you is awesome
Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."
iPhone screen is better lmfao
Android anytime
Based.
Extremely biased! I know who's your boss now!
legendary cooperation <3
OMG Android-fan boys are ranging right now. :D
come on man, Marques wanted a fist bump at the end. don't leave him hanging like that
AND-> I love Apple like I love my wife and son because they just bring love and easiness to my day. it's that simple folks. GET A FAMILY OF YOUR OWN folks, a system that just works. LOVE 4 ALL
android users are like that fiancee you had when you were 23 and you got her kissing the other boy. she just wants any excuse to continue with you, "IT IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK, I ACTUALLY LOVE YOU. They just don't let go..
Love the collabo fellas. The Sony Xperia though? That thing kills everything out
Great to see both of my favourite reviewer together..
Ok, I'm 65, and dumb as dirt when it comes to tech. But even I can see that Android is better. But some people drink the IOS koolaid and can't see past the fog.
I thought that you guys are genius in technology world until i saw this video !
I would honestly say this video was wholly biased, and you can see it several times when Arun reacts with a bewildered face to the things Marques says. Marques was really reaching on some things, like the flat shape of an iphone, or the software, knowing Android is vastly more flexible with root capability. Praising things like facetime as if Android doesn't have more than one way to video chat. They gave draws to things android won easily hands down. I would say they're closer to tied as competitors. Not knocking either one, but the bias was egregiously bad on Marques's part here. The vast landslide in points that he painted iPhone as having simply does not exist at all. How is iPhone eco friendly when they lobby to block all legislation for Right to Repair? Undeniably laughable. They really didn't think this video through. For a tech reviewer this exposed marques as completely oblivious and destroys his credibility all together.
You two guys are my favorite go to guys for honest truth on devices.
iphone have better camera than android if the android is not s22 ultra, p50 pro, etc... not even in your dreams these cameras are worst than iphones camera.
I feel like his channel is comparing samsung and Iphone so he can get both phones free but he really only uses Iphone. Because some of the comparisons he does you can tell which one is better at what obviously and Iphone doesn't compare.
Also, the “customization” argument is literally just a “we do it because of its complexities” rather than actual functionality.
The problem with battery life is that you need to let these lipo batteries go way down. It will prolong the lifetime of your battery.
This wasn't sponsored by apple
This guy bought his voice from redit with all the bells and whistles
This is honestly the most biased video comparison I've ever seen. You basically just gave the iPhone all the wins
I love how tech utubers start like we love Android just to gain popularity....and then gradually end up using iPhone themselves
no way screen is draw,Samsung by far is better
Anything not apple is a win. 10 minutes and sanity saved. You're welcome
I think this is a wrong named comparison because Android is an OS made by Google and iOS is also an OS made by Apple so, when you want to compare Android with something, it should be an OS.  There is a lot of brands that uses Android to make phones. If you want to compare phones, you should compare them by names like "Samsung S22 Ultra vs Iphone 13 Pro Max".
Having used both, I'm now android all the way, though its by no means perfect. Ultimately being restricted by an echo system that is their to get more money out of you is bad. Unfortunately to a lesser extent the likes of Google and Samsung are both going the same way. Personally I feel this video has a biased view point.
I will say that I can’t help but agree with the decision. I have been a diehard fan and literally owned Samsungs top flagship phones from the S1 to note 10 plus and s20 ultra. And actually bought my girl the S22 ultra. But my first iPhone is the 13 pro max and at first there were some minor things that I missed like haptics on the keyboard, optical zoom, super fast charging ext. but iPhone just does something better and makes you appreciate the phone more. The eco system is untouchable in my opinion and because of it I literally own like 90% of apples products now. Apps look and work simply better. Facetime and iMessage and airdrop are a must have now for me. I would keep a Samsung on me for a second phone but iPhone definitely takes the driver seat from here on out!.
That's MKBHD review and choice, I will go for Android everyday
Thanks for tNice tutorials content. It was the first soft soft video I've seen that didn't assu I knew my way around all of the functions.
Nice video
Marques : uses a samsung for a year Also marques : iphone is easily the winner
i feel arun takes a full objective and overall point of view that would include all users, proved since hes given a win to samsung before while still using i phone himself. Mkbhd relies too much on personal opinions and personal point of view when giving his judgements, the phone he prefers is always the better one .
switch back and forth from android to apple every 2 years,  just for fun. s21 has made me seriously consider just sticking to apple from now on. what a pos.
okay this is why i prefer aruns opinions when it comes to this cuz mkbhd just seems toooo bias. petition for arun to test phones more often again.
Android Auto is absolutely horrible.
“Reliability a draw”….yeah right
Switched from android to iPhone. Hated it at first, then I got used to it. There are some things I like in iOS but there are some things I miss from android as well. It depends on the user I guess.
The first one wasn't a draw. It was a clear win for Android. I'm still watching but this is bad foreshadowing. All the guy on the left is doing is making excuses for the shortcomings of the iPhone.
These two got allot of g qualities to be honest
Guys, I'm sorry this is awful. Apple biased, both of you. Gotta un-sub for this, for telling the truth but failing to recognize it. YouTube mods! Takeaway two views, one for each.
It feels like these questions were tailored around iPhone's strong points, while some of android's (like usb c) were just neglected. So the final result doesn't really mean much.
Video makes very little sense. Don't remember either of them making IPhone 13 their phone of the year.. If I'm not mistaken.. They both voted Samsung S21 Ultra.  Very biased towards iPhone in this video, robbed android of many points by calling "draws" when you previously concluded Android was better.  Actually, quite a poor video, for once.
I think the title should be Android vs iOS, you can't compare an OS with a brand...
I love android..I want to give apple a try but I'm so skeptical
Accent challenge
Heavily biased..... Iphone doesn't have a decent fast charging but still got a point. wth??
I don’t believe it, I used to love these guys for the truth and the things that they brought into notice of people. But as they have grown they turn into this, a little whinny pieces of shit which is not acceptable. Driving people to consider the facts which are not even important and useless. I own an iPhone 12 pro max, which was a break from using android since six years, but it was a huge mistake. Don’t get me wrong Apple is good but very restricted. Android has features and customisation which iOS can only dream off.
This was def sponsored by iPhone 🤣
that guy seems biased as hell lol
iPhone teammmmmmm!!!!!!
Calling it a draw on software features because iOS has airdrop, facetime, iMessage is the most ridiculous one.
*Like it or not, it’s iPhone and the others*
Saala iPhone ka chamcha
Using my N9005 for 5 years and it never let me down! It does not rendering photos like new Android phones so all things relies on Sony sensor on my phone. Thankfully it is so natural on day light, great white-balance, correct colors with a little bit contrast. Great screen with 6500K white balance. Apps were working fine until Android 5.0.1 were out of minimum requirements. That is the only thing makes me sad. I don't want to switch custom ROM due to my habits with Samsung UI and apps.   I will use my baby till the end.
Okay so i’ve been an android guy from when i was born.. but like a year ago i got my frist iphone.. from a friend with just 20€.. an iphone 7 plus litteraly almost brand new.. at the time i had an S20 FE and a Mi 10T Pro, and i actually never thought ill ever change myself from Android to IOS.. but i’ve started using my iphone a lot.. it felt way more simpler.. way smoother in some way.. like everything felt easy.. i litteraly got used to the OS in like 2 days.. and then i got myself an Iphone 13.. i litteraly forgot about “features” like being able to customise the phone however you want.. and get paid apps for free.. and other stuff.. the materials were also a big thing i noticed.. i had phones from Xiaomi, Samsung, LG.. Midrangers… flagships.. and they felt way cheaper than an iphone would feel.. and i’ve also noticed that BUDGET phones were NOT worth it.. I had an Samsung Galaxy A40 and it was the worst phone i ever held.. i had many phones from the A category.. and for me these were the worst.. they were so laggy.. the materials were trash.. for example i had an A70 (before the S20 FE) i broke it in 4 weeks! How? it got droped from my bed onto the wooden floor.. It didnt have any flaws on the outside.. screen wasn’t broke.. but the display was fucked.. and tbh i would rate my experience with samsung phones a solid 4/10! I also had an Xiaomi and i even have it now as a secondary phone.. an  Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro.. and probably the best android phone i had.. yes there was still lag.. becouse android.. but mostly the phone is GOOD. The display is bright… and fast with 120hz! I feel like androids are getting better tho in terms of OS optimisation.  But iphone’s simplicty and OS are unbeaten. Features like Airdrop, Apple Pay are hands down the best.. apple might not have the “freedom” android has.. but for me apple is litteraly on top!  I never had any lag on my iphones.. not even on the iphone 7 and its more than 5 years old.. and it still was getting software updates.. like fr.. you could play a game like roblox on it.. and litteraly have no lag.. YES on a 5Y old phone.. but play that on an Galaxy A40 and your phone would become a oven and you would have to turn the graphics to 1!  I wont talk about the camera.. and the camera os.. becouse we all know the answer.   People think apple iphones cant game! But tbh i never had lag in any games.. Or any OS Situations.. like browsing and watching videos or litteraly anything else..    Again i do use both android an iphone! And my own conclusion is that iPhone right now is class over Android.. but that doesn’t mean Android doesn’t have its good parts.. like price and options.. and more “freedom”.  Also i forgot to say this.. But when i was like 12-14 i used to hate iPhones.. but never held one until 2 years ago (at 17).. thats why its good to “test” before jumping on any conclusions..   Currenly own an iPad 9. iPhone 13. Mi 10T Pro. S20 FE Iphone 7  Also this is my own opinion.
Ngl I didn't like the video very much because it wasn't handed fair, the point of android is the freedom to choose from many phones with different properties. Comparing IPhones against just flagship Android phones is against the point of android. It's basically a iPhone Vs Samsung video and this shouldn't be the point.
If you compare specs between top tier phones, S22 Ultra vs 13 Pro Max, the S22 will win. If that doesn't bother you it's about the extra features.
I would have to disagree with this one here. I've had more issues with Apple than Android so it's gonna be Android for me.
Marques please change your name to imarques. I feel he is heavily biased towards apple
I can watch it all day..❤️😍
The Apple ecosystem and its continuity is also a huge deal for me.
Stuoid people are angry because iPhone is much better.... and Android... is just Android......
Apple products are pure garbage..only fat Americans use them. Android wins on every category there is .. hands down
Widgets are better on Android period customizing iOS is a nightmare
some of this those goes to android but you're just being biased imo
Thanks apple for sponsoring this video ❤️
I feel like Android phones are for people who want a phone that is tuned to their needs and the iPhone is for people who just want a good phone.
S22 ultra next level@!!!
I listened to your review and there were a few categories that seemed like an Android win and then you spun it around and stated draw.  I had it 5.5 to 4.5 for Android. And then I think about that awful program iTunes I run on my PC and I have to bump Android up even further.
👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾 android 4L ❤️
I'd rather be a free bird than a caged bird in a pretty cage restricting where I can go and what I can do.
Cool and all, but I just find the iOS UI so ugly. Why are there folders in folders? And that is just one thing that annoys me so much
This video made me unsubscribe from mkbhd
I would love to use iPhone. But the App store selection for games if worse and the PiP and shared screen pretty much don't exist in iPhone.
First play is all abt enjoying their accents . Second play is all about the conversations .
DO DEBATE ? APPLE IS BEST
These guys are overhyped and I'm always listen to that one tech guy who is 100% unbiased and with true and more attractive presentations. Mrmobile aka Michel Fisher ! - If he says IOS better than android then i'd believe. not these guys
Most original idea for a video
I like samsung but any other android company is trash. If i could only buy other android than samsung i would go for iphone.                 Ohh and xiaomi sucks
This video is actually biased and Mrwhosetheboss isn't saying his actual opinions 🤐
Very bias and unfair comparison both clearly apple fans
tough to repair phones are good for the environment? at least it should have been a tie as both options are crap
No-one: MKBHD: My phone is a WHOLE year old
The guy who is using iphone and iphone supporter so he doesn't like android but android phones are far better than iphone by screen sizes, cameras, 8K video shooting, battery life, fast charging, c type of charger , long lasting batteries, ram, storage, smooth , faster, even there are almost apps free download but in iphone have to pay for app. He is talking bullsit.
Very well paid promotion by Apple from the two most loyal reviewers of Apple...😂😂😂
I have a Samsung a7 and a poco x4 pro And i had a i phone 13 but it broke  And i Think samsung is better not only from price but form quality i one day (And im not joking) it Fell Down 6 sets off stairs and it had no scratches or dents or other damage to internals But well the iphone sliped out off my hand in the toilet Fell on soft carpet and the screen was completly broken 🤦‍♂️ AND I PAID 1300€ for that  And i mean im a gamer and i love to play games on mobile or console but if i play games on both but I DONT WANT BRAKE IT while playing. So if i coud chose between a mobile that brakes and a another one thats build like a Tiger 2 tank id chose that one     My poco x4 pro comes tomorrow im gonna Update this
This is totally subjective..this discussion is useless and definitely attract users to comment and interact .. and i just did it 🤣
Wt abt the user count? How many of them using iphone and how many users on Android platform.
I was hoping for a reasoned debate but this was more wish washy 'feelings' espoused by one person without much argument from the other. I disagreed with quite a few of the so called 'objective' wins, I know this channel likes to be click bait but this was diving into dime store journalism....
Have to buy an overpriced, shitty Mac to do stuff on iPhone. Probably never going to use.
S22 all day everyday. Apple is basic and boring these days. What's crazy is Samsung has its own version of imessage across Samsung phones. Google duo is compatible with all phones and better than FaceTime. Samsung phones can do the same thing as air drop with other Samsung phones. USB type c is superior to lightning. The thing is that android is more compatible with everything but Apple only works with Apple. Such a closed off ecosystem
Here’s what I say, I think iPhone is better, just really performs better and looks way better and that’s your choice but the main reason android is even an option bc it’s like oh well Apple is better in all these ways why even think about android it’s just because of as cards. On an iPhone if you run out of storage and want to download or update something well now you gotta go through all your videos and images and all that stuff to delete stuff so you have space where you can go to a store and get an sd card and sometimes there on sale where you can get a terabyte for 30 bucks and now you have unlimited storage you know where as If you run out on iPhone your out.
in my opinion I don't care
Just find iPhone too difficult to navigate in. Also, its keyboard sucks and you just don't have flexibility.
I think you guys compared bananas, kiwis, grape fruits with apple.  Not the same public, not the same mission of the iphone and take several personal impressions such as photos missing in an android. I lost all my data in an iPhone 4S once, never lost one single photo on android. And still, points to apple because, yeah sure, why not.
i've always a swapped between samsung & apple per upgrade & usually i find myself disappointed with the iphones after a year - whilst i don't mind how simple and limited they are as sometimes having quick access to things is better - the overall performance really dies down - every update makes my battery drain even more & brings constant annoying bugs. Even little things like having all auto brightness settings off yet the phone is still to dim to see. i even had a stupid phone reset bug that would happen atleast 4 times a day over the course of the second year - was nothing i could do about it, just had to wait it out & could literally happen anytime. Samsung are miles ahead in terms of everything. Am now on the s22 Ultra & im actually changing from samsung - iphone to samsung -samsung. i'm done with apple.
The thing about iPhone is it does almost everything really well. It nails what most people need in a phone. Sure it’s expensive, but there’s very little compromise for most people. 5 years of OS and 7 years of security updates mean you can keep it longer. Plus, at least in the US, Apple exclusive apps are REALLY important for a lot of people to have.
@Mrwhosetheboss - Your argument was, Iphone releases very limited number of models that the apps have enough time to optimize their function on Iphone.
I personally think this would be the outcome from MKBHD because he´s always been a "stock Android" guy, and the phones that have represented Android for ever have been Samsung Flagships, way ahead on specs and software on top of stock Android, and he's never liked Samsung phones, so of course he would go for the iPhone everytime because all he likes is those lame Google Pixels.
All I concluded from this video is that I love Marques even more than I felt I love him. The guy is just so so cool and he always knows what he is on about. I hope to have a tech space someday and also get to meet him someday.
andriod is always best,latest & ios is still in 2000,plz wake up ios its 2022 & the people from 2022 says 2000 is best
Mr Brownlee that's outrageous! I'm not sure if that's an honest opinion. How can a tech savvy fall so low!? (imho!)
Multi window is the best feature of the android. Your both apple fans
I couldn't believe that Marcus could lie for almost 20 minutes.  If he was Pinocchio, he would kill Aaron with his nose 😆
Best duo ever!!
United Kingdom vs united state….!!!!!!
I was a pro apple until iphone 7, then i switched to huawei/samsung and now im getting interested in switching back to apple bc tbh both phones are almost identical nowdays.
I have owned android and iPhones. Although I’m typing this on iPad, i cannot stress the freedom on android. The length that Apple does to let you know that you do not own the hardware and software of the device you bought with your money is just criminal. I hate Apple for that and I’m never going to buy more of their products because that just fuels and cements their view that they can get away with anything
Sponsered by Apple 😅
this video should have been titled 20 mins of arun being mind blown
I like MKBHD.  I do agree that they do seem to obviously be shilling the ole' apple...but I think that this argument is what keeps these two companies competitive, right?  It is good for all of us that there is no actual answer here.  I have been with android since the the G1.  Remember that whole physical keyboard thing...?  I had apple with work, and did not care for it. at.  all.  Mercifully they are slowly siphoning away all of androids home screen "philosophies". I find the amount of control that apple demands insulting.  The whole apple fanboy stuff can get kind of gross, as well.  But it is silly to act like Apple does not make an amazing product.
This is an iphone biased comparison. I'd take apple for only half of the things they gave it credit for. Stuff like videography, battery performance and the ecosystem thingy but customisation, reliability, design, value for money....bruh this should be a tie in my opinion. Mrwhosetheboss is clearly iphone biased in this video
i think my favorite choice is Android 🤩🤩🥰
MK is heavily Apple bias. Just watch how he covers an Apple evening vs a Google/Android event.
Their opinion...nothing will be for everyone, that's why we have choices.
Apples main propaganda machine strikes again, i knew mbhk would let me down. He's been on apple's nuts for years now. Smh..😑
One thing I think they missed from my perspective is about third party app integration. For example my calendar app and company phone app can't integrate as well with the iPhone because Apple doesn't allow that.. the flipside is that it probably make the iPhone more secure, but to me that integration really makes my life easier.
Longer I watched this video, more I feel like Android and iPhone are their own thing, two completely different beasts catered to two entirely different masses. iPhones are more of a Jack of all trades than most Androids. And I guess that's where both its strength and weakness are.
The most ridiculous rating ever...
👎
This video is only bullshit😂. There are just iphone lovers who doesnt know anything abt phones
IPhone is far ahead compare to android in my personal experience
Really? I always consider both of you 2 reviews when buying phones for myself and loved ones. I think I'm over relying/believe on you both
eveytime i go to a iphone it feels like returning to a flip phone with so many missing features.
i don't know why but Apple users have strong support to the company 😅
that's the reason humans feel first then think second. apple does a gread job overall design and user experience
Nice video 👌 keep up the good work
you can do quickshare and nearbyshare (same as air drop)
Ah, another great day to read Android fangirls’ crazy comments. Lmfao
congratulations to samsung on the win!  I bought 2 smartphones, samsung won in my rating.  iphone sold!
You don't have to use the camera in the social media app. You can open your normal camera app and then upload it on social media. Why do people always forget that? Very weak argument IMO  I choose Android because I want the highest quality photos. End of story. But that's only what I want. I want the best photos possible
This is actually so bright that it feels bright 😍
Yea , no matter how comments people do between android and iOS i can’t change or move from iOS to android. Thanks for these reviews anyway.
The polarizing effects of this topic continues to baffle me. The truth is, it is a matter of preference. Use what you like and spend more time pondering more important things in life.
3:15 carne asada is from Portugal and the name is portuguese not spanish
Guys stop being so pressed iphones are better and they just work
too much iphone love :D
As a longtime android user, If iPhone had USB-C, I would give them the win. Whatever bullshit Apple subjects their customers to regarding repairability and device customization, they absolutely demolish Android in the software support game. My mom's iPhone 5s was receiving the latest software updates for 7 years straight, and all it needed was a battery replacement to keep it going.  The Android smartphone market is so fragmented with so many different flavors out there that's it's rare to see software support for an android phone that's more than 4-years-old. And most of them followed in Apple's footsteps and removed once essential features and accessories anyway. If you can afford to live in the walled garden, it's absolutely a better experience than what Android currently offers.
Epic Battle 🤜🏾❤️🤛🏾
I rock both the s22 ultra and the IPhone 13 pro max
try closing all apps on iphone. :)))) what a joke of a phone.
I stopped it when they said Apple has a better battery life,, my god .. what people do for money..  bro i will pay for ur trip if ur full charged iphone beats my s 21 ultra and we both will play the same game with same display settings, or we can play youtube with auto play n will see which one stay living.. useless paid reaction.  Just unfollowing both  as the job of urs is to bring out truth not to say apple is best as they r paying u
You can easily bias a comparison like this by simply choosing categories for comparison that you care most about, which is a personal choice. I myself, don't use Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok etc.. I think calling yourself a power user for a phone when these apps are your primary purpose for owning a powerful phone doesn't really add up to me. Also, you didn't give any points to android for Google assistant and you didn't even mention DRAG and DROP..
I’m an IOS user, but Marquess’ level of meat riding and bias is next level on this video
I phone works very well just in the USA.... But in the whole world?????..... Samsung works better than I phone....... Who care about limited area of work.... It is better to have the phone working well in whole Universe, in Africa o in the USA at the same time.
I phone is like shit..... It is very , very,  very expensive, but not good quality for that expensive price.
I don't understand the point of this video. I should be Android vs iOS to compare the software, or a specific iPhone vs a specific Android. This is not fair to either side. Felt very iPhone biased aswell. I am using both eco systems daily - both phones and computers. My android phone has 120w charging and great battery life - surely better than iPhone. I can think of atleast a few android cameras I would pick over any iPhone camera. I also would pick Android as a OS over iOS just because I like how it just works with everything and not like Apple where you have to use their whole eco system for it not to be a headache. But then again, this comes back to this being an unfair comparision as the Android phones with great charing and battery might not be the same phone as the one with the best camera. Flawed video and rather stupid concept.
It has always been and will remain controversial topic for valid reasons, But you guys made it look perfectly easy using unbelievably biased oblivious showdown.  This may dent the credibility in the eyes of logical people. You gave draws to things android won easily hands down.  Praising the flat shape of an iPhone, or the software, knowing Android is vastly more flexible with root capability. Praising things like facetime as if Android doesn't have more than one way to video chat....The vast landslide in points that he painted iPhone as having simply does not exist at all. How is iPhone eco friendly when they lobby to block all legislation for Right to Repair? Undeniably laughable.  Many vital points are drawn extremely biased & carefully ignored... The video I disliked, not being n android fanboy, buy smelling naked biasness from renowned tech reviewers.
Build quality and design goes to the iPhone. But I'm still using a note 20 ultra because of a couple of things I just can't get past. The iPhone does not allow me to have a full keyboard. Even if I download gboard on an iPhone it does not have all the functions on one screen. My Samsung with gboard has a number row and all of the alt keys by hard pressing on the main screen. I hate having to flip back and forth between screens to get to all the keys. So there's that. Also the iPhone apps don't always work well with each other. If I say hey Google, navigate to the nearest McDonald's while I'm driving, it just does it. The iPhone does not work that well. Also Apple maps sucks ass, and making Google maps the default does not work seamlessly. Customizability of the appearance, themes and wallpapers, apple just has these huge limitations. If they could at least fix the keyboard issue instead of having that rudimentary keyboard they've been stuck with since the invention of the smartphone, I would consider switching. iPhone definitely takes better video, but Samsung has better editing software and allows me to make some really interesting photos, where iPhone just takes good plain old photos. I don't like to use just the stock filters and the Android editing software allows for more combinations. Also, that friggin notch. WTF is up with that? This is 2022 and every other phone has eliminated it down to just a punch hole. Why TF can't Apple get over their obsession with this giant notch?
you cannot compare an operating system "android" with phone device "iphone"  .... what you can say is "Android" vs "ios" because this makes more sense 🙂
It’s funny just yesterday I took a picture on my iPhone and when I went to show someone it didn’t save 🤔
I think samsung performance is not up to par. Quality also downgraded. I am samsung user since galaxy s2 to s22. I think they really missed the mark with s22. Battery performance is sh**tty and overall quality of satisfaction is not there. Only focusing on camera is not going to keep customers like me.
Android is besttt
This is what completely biased review looks 👍🏻
This is why i dont watch reviews on Mkbhd. BS
Android to iphone -when you know to put underwire    We know to put pant
Making a video on which phone is better is nonsense because obviously your opinoom is biased. Im always an Iphone user but switching to samsung made my life easier that I dont miss the IOS platform. In my opinion Iphone is deteriorating because of lack of newer features. Theyre inferior in a lot of sense but huge in copying technologies from samsung. The notch alone for example haha oh my, wake up people steve is not around anymore. Its about time to quit buyimg this overpriced piece of old technology. One thing to add, quit, iphone manufacturers pls stop using samsung hard drives to make ur products work
No language every time best of the best iphone 💚
I HATE IPHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The guy with the Black Tshirt is clearly an iPhone user and have not much experience in S22Ultra he even has a apple watch. For me he is not fair
Mrwhosetheboss you've gotta man up and be willing to stand by your convictions.  Every time I felt like you gave the real objective opinion, then MKHD talked you into forgiving Apple for it's downsides and pretending they were equals or that Iphone won.  Especially screen man, come the fuck on.  How could you let him talk you into declaring Apple a draw in god damn screens.  You said yourself S22 ultra is in a whole other league.  You really think the iphone, with that ugly huge bezel, GINORMOUS NOTCH, less brightness, less sharpness is actually equal??? Bro stick to ur convictions don't buckle just because he tries to convince you.  He's a fanboy, he is blinded, you, however see things truly objectively.  MKHD can't be trusted in tech anymore, he is all in on Apple.  He chose the wall garden, he's an automaton now, you don't have to be.
Hail iPhone...Hail us (users) 😂
And I just subscribed...good one there
They are both so bias, what is going on there??? Apple probably paid them... The funny part is, everyone like Marques who wears the Apple Watch on every single Video, that shows to me that he wants the IO'S Ecosystem from Apple devices, but he still want a Android as a second Daily Driver, because he knows Samsungs One UI has much more to offer in all terms.
I don't know why, they are both not fair on Android and especially on Samsung behave. They both are biased, as if Apple has paid them for that BS
Dude MK is way too biased towards Apple.  There is now way it was a draw for freaking screens.  The fucking Notch alone ruins Apple's chances, plus the screen itself is way better on S22 ultra.  I feel like mrwhosetheboss definitely knew Samsung was better but he let the other guy talk him into giving Apple points...for the flat screen? Wtf!? that's another downside, the curved display on my Note 9 is one of the things I love best about it, it is so futuristic and gorgeous.    I can't even finish watching this video. They already started out with a retarded lie.  Just because MKDH uses iphones as his daily driver means he is unwilling to admit it has some downfalls.  I have no respect for him, fuck him.  I want to switch to an iphone, mind you, but I still have fucking eyes and that notch is fucking disgusting.
MKBHD gives every year the best phone and every time Android Phone wins...but here MKBHD preferred iPhone in most of the category... This proves how poor he is without his team work....🌝
Sponsored by Apple
I’m always with Apple. But the new iOS 16 and the new iPhone will be the best.
I feel mkbhd is biased towards iPhone... everyone knows samsung out rates in display and camera and multitasking...but he's not even giving the credit. iPhone isn't good at multitasking camera and display compared to ultra..just close to it that's it.
The always say ‘android is better for this’ then go ahead to say ‘I would still choose an iPhone’ lol
Not biased at all..
PRICE, outside of the US the Apple loses on everything because of just that. I can get an 120hz Amoled 5000MA fast charging battery, reasonable camera all for 300 USD, the same at apple costs 4x that. So 12 points for android and zero for apple ;-)
No one cares about eco friendly
Both my fav guys in single video, good to see you ❤ God bless u bros...
Android better phone design and camera. No way Apple gets those outside a bias view
Seems biased towards iPhone. Iphone doesn't have high refresh rate, USB C, Slow charging, Huge Price, expensive repairs, Less customisation, Less choice about specs, Low RAM etc have all been ignored. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Android still doesn't have an inbuilt file sharing application or medium except Bluetooth. iPhone has Airdrop which is a whoosh! in transferring files!!
I feel like this is iPhone sponsored
One sided paid promotional video 😀😀 With Android u have better display, camera,design,fast charging, freedom, cool features etcc....!!!! I used to like and following MK a lot! I think he is already sold to someone 😀😀
Android is the king 😉
Hi i am mkbhd from apple 😂 well for me i want both one iphone and one Android ☺️ wbu guys ??
How much  apple pay  to this guy   helping the ihcraps           4 real.   Yea is appefanguy
This video kind of pissed me off a bit, in terms of software features, photography, and assistants; android hands down wins in those categories. And I’m an iPhone user
phone is phone  basicially
They are so uncomfortable doing a duo lmao this feels a lot like talking to my aunts on Christmas
am i the only one who got an add with u in it before watching ur vid or is it all of us what a coincidence
Iphone is beautiful, but ios is too stupid with too little options.
Ladies and Gentlemen before you an ad from Apple, don't be fooled. MKBHD is an APPLE  paid influencer. Apple can't explain until today how taking away the charger brick and wired pods save the planet but they both agreed is the most Eco-friendly company.
MKBHD is a fanboy for apple! And when you put him on this video,i already knew how he was gonna judge this whole thing! He’s a fanboy for apple and iPhones. He can’t help himself! I’m sorry but I can’t watch his lame comparisons because he is very biased and I’m being polite about him
Wow.      . ... .  ..
LET ME SUM UP FOR YOU ANDROID IS THE WINNER  😊😊
Biased MKBHD
As a full fledged android user I definitely agree. People may not like it but Apple's ecosystem and OS they've created is too seamless. And with more features getting taken away from Samsung phones for example, if the iPhone got a usb-c charger, fingerprint reader, and multi tasking I would switch.
This isn’t a jab at either of them, it would be interesting to see this recreated by two tech-interested people with lower middle class paycheck. I really want to know, how different that would turn out.
Genuinely surprised about the outcome. I’m an iPhone user but I was expecting android to win. Yes iPhone is great at this and that but I feel like you could’ve decided on a draw so many more times . Nothing wrong with that. Especially after you guys kept realizing how you were both correct with your reasoning , the better phone would’ve still won if you added in a few more draws , this looks so weird as if the iPhone is much better which it isn’t . Love both of you guys but I kind of disagree with the rating 😅
IOS = Phones for Dummies. ANDROID = BOSS level multi tasking or Phones not for Dummies.
Had android all my life until I got the iPhone 12 which I’m currently using. I’m definitely never going back.
In terms of ram on iPhone, one of the drawbacks is that background tasks seem to take really long or seem to pause once a particular app isn't on the screen anymore (ie. Uploading to Dropbox or Google Photos). Android can handle those tasks at the same time and at a way faster pace, in my experience.
Two iPhone lover talking why they love iPhone. By far the worst video in this channel. Even though Use iOS , this video made me hate Apple in general cause of the ridiculous comparison. It makes me think they are just sponsored and apple products are praised for nothing.
I like the connectivity of iPhone because you can link all your devices with one account
Only buy Android if you have little money or you are Root user.
Android is far better than iOS that's the end of discussion
Mrwhosetheboss after you are my favourite ever youtuber you really dissapoint me for a first time. This is pay by Iphone look a like. Can't compare iphone vs android... compare ios vs android instead.
I’ve always had both Android and IOS phones. I like that I can customize Android to my liking. The Stylus is a big win for me because I like using it like I’m actually using a notepad and pen but on my phone. But that’s it for why I like the Android phones really.. I like how simple and reliable iOS has been for me. 🤷🏽‍♂️ I like how everything just flows with iOS. I prefer the look of iPhones compared to Android phones too. They just look like quality! Feel like it too! Android feels cheap ish. Unless you go all out and get the top of the line phone in it’s category. I’ve had my Android phones crash on the simplest tasks multiple times. Where iOS just does it. Both have pros and cons but iOS has more pros for me. Again I’ve had both and I personally prefer iOS/iPhone’s.
Android phones are easy to used, tones of options customization. For me android is winner 🏆
Use Me As Dislike button  ..!! Who thinks the review was biased.!! 🤔🤔🤔
IPhone socks it's the physical worst
Very biased toward Apple ios
MR.MKBHD talks really smart.
Superb video, youtube is killing comertial TV. All this for free, 2 legends cooperate. At the end of the day u just by smartphone whitch suits u'r budget and demand. Writing from my old huawei p30 pro.
The problem is android vs iPhone is not a fair comparison to begin with the spectrum of android is to big working in a cell phone repair store I can tell you cheap end android phones that people think they save money with are nothing but a waste of money and resources to build them for example the T-Mobile revel 4 is such a pos phone that it lags out of the box brand new phone can barely run the software even iPhones cheapest models will run iOS with no problems you will get the same experience within iOS with the cheap end of iPhone to the very top end android based phones definitely cannot say the same
Paid show 💸
I have used both platforms and I find the convenience and freedom on Android more to my taste.
If android phone manafactures fully allowed for the changing of phone OSes without bricking phones, I'd honestly give Android the customisation badge since it's a bit like Linux.
Display is draw when there is a  shit notch in display?  Battery goes to iphone when we can't even connect USB-C? Eco consciousness goes to iphone bcs of their 2030 plan? That's not even succeeded 😑 and also the lightning usb cable.. doesn't it matters? Just give a USB C port so we don't have to buy those stupid lightning cables and waste ... lol Performance goes to iphone?? Android is a software not phone S22 and Apple doesn't even come close to ROG series and their gaming Performance  Wow, how much money did apple gave you?
Can anyone turn Iphone to computer?  Download windows in S22 ultra and just play GTA V , RDR and Many more , a little smol display tho... but it's a huge win for android
Here come all the android fan boys to cry. When these are basic facts lol.
Comparing Android that is an operating system to iPhone that is a hardware, is a joke.... a funnier joke is that iPhone battery has won against S22.
All these triggered Android users in the comments 😂 Can’t handle the results
What a joke made out of a "objective" test. Avg android phone mops the floor with iphone. As simple as that. 7.5vs2.5? What a joke
I am free to do whatever I want on Android. I can download music, put music on my phone without iTunes, I can even turn my Android into an actual computer. I am not tied to Apple and do not have to have Android approve of anything I do
I’m not a big apple fan but I have grown to like their reliability and consistency they aren’t trying to add crazy features with every generation plus gaming on an iPhone or iPad is a lot better than gaming on an android phone or tablet
People complaining …but marques is actually a shill for android phones
For years I've always used the standard "Android has so much more customisation" argument or "I don't want to be tied into the Apple ecosystem"...but since changing from a Samsung S20+ to my Google Pixel 6 Pro I've actually come to realise 2 things...1) the customisation that I boasted about with Android is something I don't care about or use. I use the standard launcher and have no intention of changing. I change my wallpaper every now and then and do like having a home screen but I don't customise any element of it. The Pixel UI is slick and for me it feels very refined. And 2) I'm just as tied into the Google ecosystem as any Apple user is to iOS. Whether it's Google Pay, Podcasts, Play Books, YT Music or Google Photos, I am very tied into the Google ecosystem (not a complaint) - but I am at the stage where it's easier for me to continue with my existing Google account managing my digital life than it would be for me to change. I know I could change to iOS and maintain all of these accounts, but the simplicity of it all is the crucial factor. I don't want to have to muck about with a phone too much. And I guess thats where I'm at going from my mid 20s into my early 30s now I'm just after something that feels polished out of the box and works well. And for me the Pixel 6 Pro is fantastic for that. But I'm well aware if I had an iPhone 13 Pro Max in my hand I'd be equally happy if I was as tied into their ecosystem as I am to Google.
i want to switch from android to iphone and this video pops up
never seen so many android users coping this hard
Mrwhose the boss can you reply back and say hi
Funny I picked android phone years ago after watching mkbhd videos....the score at the end makes me thing mkbhd was one drug as he speaks so slow...
MKBHD sold out to apple
Nice apple ad 😂👎
I’m more of a iPhone person because when I switched from android to iPhone there was a huge difference in performance. Also on the iPhone there is a ultra realistic camera option.
Display, a draw? With that ugly notch, seriously? It just showed at the beginning that this is going to be a biased video.  Waste of a time to watch this comparison.
Android community is mad, these videos shouldn’t be made just pure opinions :(
This might be based but i just prefer the iPhone overall
The price for iPhone for the performance is not worth it flagships maybe but the rest are crap
...for me...Android all the way !!!!  But..nice video !!!
2 apple users criticising samsung phone
If you next iPhone is USB- C it’s a win
Crapple fan boys ...
Would be allot easier if they asked him what phone do you like
I won't watch it to the end, it's painful how much this is an Apple paid video (or even worse, it's not).  Eco friendly? Battery now when iPhone finally has a decent one? Features (that was a weird one)?  Widgets?!  And the screen? It's a tie?! Cmon, please...  In the end, I can simply ask, why is now a perfect time for this competition?   Because it really does feel like the answer is because iPhone, after many years, can finally challenge androids again...
love thiisss video with these both legends
For me android
Why is YouTube showing 10 ads in one video 😑
I think smartview, where you can mirror your phones screen on a Smart TV, things like this, just make android so much stronger. The edge panel is so useful if you take the time to refine its setup and find the functions that work for you, and split screen view is really helpful when you need it.
What do you recommend for someone who cares about battery,games,management,lasts long time and is reliable?? U need to know which phone as both are very competitive as u said and is up to what u look at in a phone.
Literary a billion company vs Apple Still
Had an Android device for years now and just made the switch this month. I can say I’m loving the ip13 . Everything is smooth and easy
Mk spoke as a typical Apple Fan Boy than a MK Tech reviewer
A number row on the iPhone keyboard, FSS
What I do is lower the brightness completely use battery saver mode and my battery is full or close to 85 percentage why keep charging the phone every hour or every time your battery is about to die just completely lower the brightness and use battery saver mode that keeps your battery lasting for a few hours
Samsung S22 Ultra is LEGAND of phones
Biased towards Apple! 🙄🙄
*I'm gonna be honest. It almost felt like I was watching an Apple Sponsorship.* *They were really trying to stretch so far for the IPhone when Samsung was the clear winner in most points.* *Imagine a draw for the best display? Can't believe it.*
MKBHD is so biased towards apple, it's not even funny. I'm surprised how he tried to equate 3-4 apple features to the endless features found in android phones.
This is great. Real world experience is the most valuable information. It’s all the things that could help you or hinder you in day to day use that you need to know about and that only comes from prolonged use. Frankly the day one reviews are pretty pointless, only slightly more informative than checking the spec list.  When I’m trawling to decide on a purchase, this is what I want to know. Bravo.
ANDROID HATE 😢😢
If you're rich iPhones are best but if you're from an middle class family Android is best at the end of the day
Android= Windows; Ios = Linux
The fun part of all of this is the iphone losses to android in any of these categories when compared to androids that specialize in that category, but where the iPhone is good is that it is passable in almost all categories.
The most obvious answer to this question is that you are comparing a dozen android phones with one single apple phone. The iPhone singlehandedly held up against the whole slew of android phones. One phone against a dozen? That says a ton about the do-it-all that Apple provides. You cant beat that. iPhone is by far the absolute best all around smartphone.
Title should be: apple sponsored
The fact that iPhone uses Android products(Gmail, Google, map etc) and no single ios product is used by any Android phones in the world makes Android superior
I love how you're comparing and operating system to an entire company not really smart on your end guys it should have been Samsung versus Apple
We work for years to have , $1million  while some people I know put thousand of dollars in some meme coins and they are millionaires.
Android
thank you for this comparison. The long term software support is - in my eyes - the most important thing, not only for being digitally save, but it is more friendly for our world.
Mkdhzvs guy is just Apple fanboy
ANDROID IS BEST IN ALL SIDE
This is a paid comparison
Every comparison video end with "It Depends"
Great video. But... hard-core apple pro targeting questions lol. One sided lol. But great content.
They forgot to say "This video is sponsored by Apple".
For everyone saying mkbhd is biased toward Apple, almost every recent year when he does his phone of the year, it's been an android. Just saying
Mkbhd love iPhone so MUCH.... iPhone is a very Boring phone...so I don't know why it's hyped
Could you please change the name of this video to ( From Apple fans to Apple fans) 😁 ?
not ranking lower tier iphones tho lol
It’s not about who did it first, its about who did it better.
I don't have words this video was really biased against android You can't even compare both because android is in a world of it's own It should had been Samsung or Google against Apple not android
I think this video just made me realize I am an Android fanboy. Some of the categories I think are clear Android wins were either trashed or given as draws
I think iPhone 📱 and Samsung are both great 👍
iPhone biased vid.
MKBHD is a blind fanboy of Apple like iJustine.
The final should be "what phone in your pocket right now"?... mkbhd sure got both the samsung and the iphone
Yall already knew how this video was going to go. Ifans deciding which phone is better 🤷‍♂️ wonder how this is going to go ..
This video totally not brought to you by Apple 😂
I still unlock bootloader and flash custom rom to make my phone work the way I want
Man environmental factor went to iphone? What a joke...
This felt more like a biased review than an actual comparison.
No offense but this is legit rigged
If you want a locked phone , get a iPhone.
I think iPhone is better in terms of security system, it’s an independent source of information everything you need for IPhone has an apple product to work effectively with it , that doesn’t guarantee it can’t be hacked into by hackers , my ex phone is an iPhone and it got hacked by an hacker I hired to get me information about her whereabouts and texts discovered she was a serial cheat who didn’t respect me and have no commitment to the relationship
Cortana is not on phones any more.
wtf they talking about apple uses Samsung screens ffs. I phone suckers
Can’t agree more
if iphone can take me to the moon still i wont buy it because i cant afford it, and i'm representing here 80 % of the population.
pricing of android stole all the numbers of iphone.
When they said the S22 Ultra(android) has 12 gb.  Me: .... I had 64 gb and I'm on android samsung-
Shouldn’t value be based on how long you can keep the device?
I hate this video .. you both are looking down on Android 😒 why would I go for an iOS device which sucks .. Samsung s22ultra is way better than iphone .. the freeness to do a lot of things which is limited on iOS is another big win..
I love Marques
I'm thoroughly shocked at Marques lmao wow
I have to say mkbhd had the better takes here, not unexpected.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ white balance anyone?
*PIP...the main reason I switched. Then came ALL the Freedom. 🥰
This is why I unsubscribed from MKBHD. Living in a hopelessly biased iPhone world. Absolutely not objective.
Well. This video is not balanced at all.
I personally have both and use each of them for different things, I used to be strictly iphone until I got bored of lack of customization on the iPhone..so I got an android to basically fill that void lol
iOS is superior
We need to extract the best out of iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry OS, WebOS.
He is all in for iPhone but using 1.5 year Samsung S21
Apple provide you close box to explore whereas Android give you freedom. I will chose freedom all time compare to that shitty box
this seems so much bias
video is sponsored by IPhone lol
Too bad y'all don't really prefer Android behind the scenes... Y'all love it for views and likes though lol
1:00 Touch sampling refresh rate? iPhone has Refresh rate twice smaller than Touch sampling refresh rate (240, 120). Budget+ Android phones (A+) already has the same, their refresh rate is at the same proportion. It is so in 2022 - for instance oppo a96 (other BBK), I think Xiaomi and Samsung (more expensive) has this also. And they cost less. I cannot buy the best iPhone, other models I wouldn't buy because of memory amount and features. So I buy android.
I don't care about the hardware, I only care about the OS, that's why I use Apple for everything if I can afford it.
imagina buying a thousand dollar phone and then complaining about inflation...
This is a very subjective video
I have thought about going back to Iphone a few times but the things stopping me is probably things you cant mention in your vid like illeagle streaming apps. I would also miss chromecast too much. Iphone is probably much better today but i remember not being able to set a song i had brought as mu ring tone, i had to buy it again as a ringtone. With android you have zedge any ringtone you want for free.
i just want an iphone for gaming and android for everyday use😂
Guy on the left runs on iOs
Android is better for majority of people.. although they had used iphone before..
Do windows vs mac os 🙏
How did you miss file and photo management? Android smokes apple (coming from an iPad Pro user who has more screen real estate but can still do far less)
Meanwhile Rome is burning.
Android is still way ahead than iPhone in terms of software experience, be it Google Photos vs Apple Photos, Dialler App, Apps like True Caller, Google Drive, Google Maps and many more, for god’s sake why can’t iPhone show entire call history, Android shows you from an year back as well but iPhone just shows last one week, how “not cool” is that ??  Above coming from a lifetime Android user and from last three years an iPhone user.
MKBHD has a lawyer vibe...
I bet the Samsung doesn't have the Exynos chipset innit.
Apple sponsered video period
Arun was starting to feel bad for android as the video was progressing 😂
The dap at the end was so awkward 😂😂
US :ios rest of the world :android   always on display  is better  than FaceTime period.   out here  nobody  cares about  blue bubbles
MKBHD is biased
iphone sucks  Android>>>iphone I hate iphone & i love Android
i broke my iphone and borrowed a android for 2 days and i was hooked.  never going back to apple.  you can do everything with so many other manufacturers apps with android. and i always thought the free text to other iphones was a bonus but i dont know anyone who pays for text anymore !!   LOL
Usbc is better
Iphone sucks in design, charging, price and software skin these are important features btw in which android provide more stable results so give appreciation to android where its due
Android is better
Imo if it came down to money spent per each of these Android would win most
Flat screens all day curved sucks
Despite some heavy arguing in the comments section, I've had several Samsung phones including the S21 Ultra which I truly love and the iPhone 13 Pro Max. I must say I do agree with almost everything they shared. I really love both, Android and iPhone, in general, every tech device has pros and cons. In the end, is a matter of personal taste and lifestyle.
I watched my cousin who came to visit me on vacation when henocktrosh on lg recovered his lPhone, I was so surprised when he did
Going back to apple. Fb on android sucks cant switch troll account to real account or page.
At the end of the day it's all just preference.  I personally prefer android but others may prefer IOS 🤷‍♂️
Personal preference as always.  Software, form factor, open source or not, available software, corporate politics, camera specs etc etc....  Marques Brownlee is less biased against Samsung. Quite refreshing.   It smells like CCP and Apple too much on this channel.
Mr Boss 🔥🔥🔥
Thanks apple for bringing these two together and sponsoring your product 🙄 I'm by no means a android fan boy. My other half used to use an iPhone,  me an android, we switched phones for a bit. The apps and games were really smooth, camera great but other than that,  it felt very constricting... limited in what I could do.
I don't know about the others here in the comment section but me i did my own test  Red Magic 6s Pro Vs iPhone 13 pro And the results was that the red magic phone was light years away from the iPhone. Everything apart from the battery life was way better. Call me an "apple hater" but i was and still i am an Android user. I tried iOS for like a month and i LITERALLY hated my life.
Aight, so he's a fan boy
Android has cool, yet somewhat useless features that only a handful of people use. iOS has important features that people buy an iPhone specifically just to use them. Its all about the user and how useful and necessary those features are. Android is cooler, but iPhone is better at communication and being a PHONE.
when apple pays you to speak bullshits
They didn't even count assistants or lock screen widgets this shit is biased af they also didn't even factor in the iPhone se to other low range android phones
The problem with this video is either you got to compare OS systems or you got to compare brand the brand is Apple and itself isn't always system but also it is a brand of phone nobody else makes apple style or os style phones
iPhone- if you want reliability, stability, value… but it’s a boring phone.  Android- if you want endless customization, freedom and excitement.
He got paid by iphone for sure
I didn't dislike the video, but after watching half of it, I realized it's a perfect specimen of "If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will believe that it is stupid". If you judge those 2 only by the factors iPhone wins, well then hell yeah iPhone is the best. It's not though when you take into account open source, right to repair, accessible development platform, customization and everything else. iPhone has a competitive market share only in the US, every where else (mostly) android is favored when iPhone was the only choice at some point, which literally everybody on android today at some point were on iPhone. I like those guys, but this is a very bad study all around
Android for life baby 🔥🤝🏾
Also, you missed USB c in s22 is 3.2 gen which gives speed up to 10gbps whereas iPhones lightning port is USB 2 and only gives up to 480 mbps
Good video guys but you guys missing one point the memory like it's too old school now? lol Samsung AND Apple are now both in the same camp first they got rid of that 3.5mm jack but now (since S21) they've remove even the SD card which is to my idea completly ridiculous. Put a usb key type c in it for more storage but how can you listen higher bitrate music with proper headphone without filling all your memory with those big camera I mean..."buy the 1Tb version then" sound Apple argument to me 😂 Yeah call me purist on the music side assuming myself but it definitly is a point not mentionned here 🤔
Truecaller integration and phone calls recoding is a must for thousands of people & Yes USB type-c also...
As an iPhone user I will say android is way much better on android you can do so much more I own 2 android phones they are pretty new still but slow like budget. I saw you can have launchers, more widgets options, more customization apps, home customization, emulators, and they have more games and apps than iPhone. And you can even expand the storage of android. And they have a headphone jack wow. I’m switching to android
Total Apple bias.
in terms of a phone its subjective but to me in terms of a computer windows beats out apple in nearly every way. want to plug in something on mac? you need a usb adapter? want to plug in something on windows? it comes with usb ports.
bitches. ANDROID FOREVER
I own both android and apple I always jumó back into Android bc the fast charging is awesome. On apple I love the accessories. The earphones AirPod Pro are sweet. The oneplus 7 pro today in 2022 has aged well.
He said interesting to the iphone's camera as if it hasn't been the best camera on any phone for years
I'm a battery user. So I go for the IOs. Quick charge, drains the health of the battery very fast. Same with the electric cars, charge it home during the night. If you dont have a home dont buy an electric car.
It's almost the worst comparison I've seen. Non of them really had a mind of their own on any category without the other trying to influence to tilt it towards iOS. I use both OS but I feel more free, uncontrolled and human on Android... By far
This isn't really a fair scoring system as MKBHD is clearly bias towards Apple, so having him decide each score isn't really a good or fair way of scoring it.
Pov:You just watched 20mins of apple ads
You are collaborating with an iphone bias. We know that when it comes to photography, samsung really has an upperhand but, no question, Iphone wins when it comes to videography.
I think having good baterry and good charger is way better then just good batery and lacking charger or i am missing something, why iphone is better at it lol
The KOREANS🇰🇷 are the TECH GIANT🦾 Globally🤞👏
bro im still tryna figure out which side is which??
This looks more like a paid video than a comparison also a comparison should be based on numbers and benchmarks and not on "i think" or "i feel" ...
I think Tesla phone is better than this  two brands.
youtube should bring back the dislike numbers 🚮
Mrwhosetheboss... you were being way too British by letting him take points for apple that should of been android hands down! You even let him take PHOTOGRAPHY for Apple!!! All your vids are about the great shots you get with Samsung! And eco friendly apple! You did a vid on the wasted packaging and add ons just for stuff like headphones. At least 2 points were handed away.  You were a very gracious host though lol keep up the great work :-)
MKBHD is a hardcore apple fangirl now 😂
The Clash of the two tyrants of the phone industry.. How fascinating.
Feels like paid advertising for apple I have both apple 13 pro max and Samsung 22 ultra if I need give wins apple only get two for battery life and video everything else is better on Samsung
Nobody talked about the lightning port, removal of headphone jack, not showing battery percentage, disoriented notification drawer and not showing suggested contacts when given in the initial numbers in the dialler. Those things deduce a couple of points from IOS. This video is exclusively paid  And sponsored by apple
Hey, for a next time comparison, how about giving each item a x/10 score for each, and at the end adding them all together to make something out of 100? You would have something more close I think
You're comparing a operational system with a smartphone. Not only that, but you're not using a lot of parameters that any Android would beat a iPhone easily. Customization not being in this analisys is a joke, for example. Apps too, specially because we can install any apk in any Android. Photography? Well, it depends. Sometimes my Samsung 20FE can take much better photos than my girlfriends iPhone 13 Max. And MIUI is faster and responsive as any IOS phone nowadays. I like your videos, but this was not a good one. iPhone is a better phone than most of Androids, but not entirely and easily much worst in many aspects.
I really wish I could get my hands on a Samsung because my mentality is, I must stay on the fence about preferring iPhone over Samsung until I’ve actually used a Samsung. I used an android back in 6th grade which was a small touchscreen device with a button at the bottom. And after that it was iPhone ever since. I really have no frame of reference for modern androids.
The best two Tech YouTubers I will go for, love you guys!
ngl, one of the very few completely useless vids, marq biased AF iPhone vs Android? FR?  What next, Macbook vs Windows?
STOP DOING COLLABS WITH MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER IM TOO EXCITED
not interested in anything Iphone
Idk I feel like the eco thing shoulda gone to android. If you're really trying to save the world, would the flagship part really matter? At that point it's never a comparison between iPhone and something like a Samsung. You just pick the most eco friendly.
This was such unbalance preference by both of them.
I feel like this was a slightly biased experiment given that a lot of catagories where androids won were tied. You also forgot about the fact that currently, the iphone 13 pro max uses a network wifi 6 chip instead of a network 6e chip which most androids have
should do - Apple face unlock vs Andriod unlock with everything else
This is just weird to watch.. You how are you guys able to keep a straight face? How much did Apple pay you?
omg.. I just started watching.. and this guy is an insane iPhone Fanboy... keeps making excuses for Apple. and giving score based on His preferences. Not what most people would prefer. He's not unbiased at all. Complete FANBOY.....
.
I cannot use a phone where I can't just send a document to my computer using Bluetooth just like that (just one random example). IPhones are so bland and ridiculous it's hard for me to believe they continue to be manufactured.
I have to google assistant app on my iPad, but I never use it However, I have a Google nest mini which I use all the time mostly for playing songs on YouTube music
Although iPhone has AirDrop which is pretty necessary for me, android has themes and launches which I adore, which is why I have both
It is so refreshing to watch both of the tech guys Im watching..that’s all I dont even mind the conversation because already bought S22 ultra before I watched this hahaha
Great interview…!!!
I used to hate iPhones but since the 12 series I think its reasonable to get an iPhone
Well, thats biased.
Fuck this whole industry. Just like the games industry, it's just about miling the customers as much as possible now.  Why don't they "innovate" in a way which makes phone last much longer lol It could be achieved very easily by making the battery removable like they use to be. That way, they don't need to "patch" to "optimize/slow" the phone to make the battery last longer.  But it will just be stupid features which most people don't need or use.  Why do you want a better camera on your phone at this point. How many people are trying to shoot professional photos or videos on their phone...
Switched from android to iphone and the only thing I miss is downloading free apks
From the beginning where apple ties in the screen i knew this was a very subjective review and therefore a waste of time. If apple was the only one with a punchhole they would laugh at samsung for the nodge. And it is a coward move to do the android comparison because they do not wanno piss of samsung. I bought apple and samsung phones and they have reached their peak performance.
The way copy/paste works in Android is way much better than iOS
Before I switched to IOS, I noticed how my Samsung would slow down significantly only after 2 years. I don’t notice the same detrimental slow down with the iPhone.
I just left apple after 9 years. I've had an android before. But my biggest problem was every year an iPhone is coming out the phone starts to act up. I had an iPhone 12 after I had an iPhone 10 and the same thing happened. I try to keep my phone as long as I can. But iPhone crashing when they want you to get a new phone is crazy my phone was overheating infront of my car vent with the AC on and it kept crashing.
mkbhd is obssesed with the iphone
That Apple money is good! Marques isn't wrong he gotta live but man
Nothing just rich people conversation
Radiation is high on iphone
I feel like Apple is too restrictive and you lose a lot freedom. Apple can take away 50% of features and essentially people like Marques will still support them. Once your integrated into ios you have no other viable options even if you don't like what they do. When Apple eventually removes cable charging and just have massage charging Marques will still be supporting them.
Totally Baised Video ever.
iphone all day everyday
the secret is buying an iphone for your daily life and photography and an android flagship killer like poco and xiaomi for your entertainment/games
I was disappointed a bit too! Great reviewers both of you. But you did not even skim the surface of the advantages of Android. Well, Android is the os and iOS is the os, so it was really a rating of a phone built with one OS vs (Not another phone) but an entire OS. The score can NEVER be that much in favor of iOS anyway
android is the best than iphone so pricy yet features and specifications way beyond time apple is behind android system technology.
Only the Android. Never iPhones
One of the worst video you ever made
my two fav person, in one frame. luvv it!
I don't think eco conscious should go to I phone. all of the lightning ports they use which they could easily switch to usb-c like every other device make iPhone users use much more unnecessary plastic than to buy lightning cables instead of using usb-Cs they probably already have from other devices they own
Somewhere in a Multiverse i felt a promotion to apple by Marquez
Come on Marques iOS winning over ANDROID in the features department? I am so disappointed, it feels like this is an Apple sponsored video.
Reminder for samsung fans,  we need one inch sensor with good camera software. not need more megapixels, we need next time 50mp one inch sensor for s23 ultra. We all should take this matter to samsung.
Eco consciousness for Apple? just for the fact that they don't use USB-C that point should be for Android!!!
Can't believe anyone watches videos and photos on rinky-dink cellphone screens. Makes it so immersive and all, eh? Proves people today care little about video and photo quality.
Being able to install/sell my own apps without registering them in an App Store. That's a huge win for android, and a deal breaker for me buying an iphone. Also, using bluetooth to send/receive files. That's a big win for android. What I like most of iphones is the integration with Macs and ipads.
Iphone as the battery winner????? This has got to be a joke
this wasn't fair by any means
I personally prefer iphone for a few different reasons but that not is not someone to pressure someone into one ecosystem over another and I typed this out on the samsung galaxy s22 ultra which is nice besides the subpar battery life even with a lot of features turned off to help with the battery life
I wonder if Marques just has a personal bias...or if he is getting some kind of compensation from Apple?
$500 for a basic iPhone is rich.  Yes, it is still an iPhone and contains many of their nice features, but overall it is still pretty basic.  For that kind of money Android offers some quite nice and powerful phones.  If you want Apple, then expect to pay a premium.
My 100 Euro Lenovo Moto G has been rock solid...and it comes with a removable battery and upgradable storage.  I have not had the glitch problems that these flagship phones appear to have.
Despite large profit margins Apple has never been a leader for the environment.  They have pioneered their devices intentionally to be non-modular, so that if one piece breaks or ends up being a bit too limited, then the whole thing has to be thrown away.  This leads to planned obsolescence and greater sales and profits...but this throw away culture is terrible for the environment.  Phones universally used to have removable batteries and expandable memory...until the iPhone came along.  The iMac does not even use screws, so servicing is more complicated.  Unfortunately, after leading the way in this, much of the rest of the industry has followed Apple, so the damage has extended far beyond just Apple products.  Apple has not been good for the environment.
Look at these noobs fighting in the comments when I’m using both ios n android 😏
One of the problems with the iphone is getting trapped in their closed ecosystem.
using android rn but i'm a huge apple fan.🥲😂
iphone is jut the same phone every year but with the highest price! what a 1300$ iphone can offer more than shooting 4k videos & high quality photos and maybe playing games in a descent frame rates?, meanwhile there are great android phones that can shoot 4k (ois) videos and HDR photos and running games smoothly with high frames and its all comes with a price of 330$ like realme 9 pro plus. iphone is just a garbage phones in terms of display, charging and battery, design and shape, cameras (there are android phones that can catch the moon while iphone can't recognize 200m mark) and also not to mention the shitty ios  I don't see any point or meaning in this video, I see totally misguidance and empty marketing for apple
How about the freedom of downloading even the paid apps for free on Android? Anyway, biased imterview. MKBHD is defending Apple like a child.
mrwhoseboss is cringing so hard LMAOOO with his bullshit
im boycotting mkbhd ////clearly biased  It should'nt even be close. hell ,the note 10+   is better than the newest iphone ,Lmao
So how many iPhone vs android videos do you want  Mrwhoistheboss: yes
Pretty disingenuous to pit one company against an aggregate of different companies using Android. It's not a good comparison
Why are close ones that Android edges get tied, but the ones Apple edges go to Apple?
These guys are so paid.
If only this was a fair price/price comparison but even then my iPad pro is terrible in terms of battery/customization. Even my fake Chinese huawei tablet is better despite costing 3x less than the iPad
all android users whining in the comments
MKBhD is so good.  You should ask young people what phone they use and why.  It used to be android,  but has that change
Quick answer: iOS with USB-C
I am a former Android user. I switched to iPhone in 2019, my own opinion is that iPhone is better than Android
He's obviously bias for the iPhone, that came thru especially when comparing the cameras, my girlfriend asks to use my samsung s22 ultra to take photos all the time because, it just takes better photos 🤷🏿‍♂️
One Of The Best Review's I've Ever Seen. And Ya iPhone Wins The Battle.!
I found the "win" criteria to be kind of weird throughout. One of the main points of Android is price and personal preferences. So to say: "Let's compare the iPhone to the "average" Android phone", and then not _define_ what an average Android phone _is,_ not even the price. It just comes across as setting up the "fight" as a case of Android always having one of its limbs tied behind its back. Like with one of the first questions, the win criteria is just heavily tilted in Iphone's favor; "If you could choose only one camera phone for the rest of your life.". That takes the price criteria completely out of the picture. And then deciding it as a win regardless, not because it's best. But because it's more "reliable"? Personally, I think the fact that you can get 80-90% of the "performance" of a 1500 USD iPhone camera, from a 250 USD Android phone makes that category an easy win for Android. I'm fine with "reliability" being a sub-category or even a separate one. Or comparing flagship to flagship. But you can't pick and choose for every category. And certainly not Apple flagship phone vs Android flagship in one category, and then pit a 1500 USD iPhone against the "average" Android phone in the next category.  The fact is that no consumer who cares about price even considers an iPhone. Not even Apple's "budget" option is particularly cheap compared to the performance of similarly priced Android alternatives. And even if we take price out of the equation, there are compelling reasons to choose an Android alternative. The great thing is that on the Android side, you can choose a phone that caters especially to your personal needs. Which on the Apple side of the equation only applies if you are the _"average"_ iPhone user.
Android
This is not apple vs Android but it is Apple vs Samsung
Its funny how people keep pointing out flaws in an iPhone by comparing it will the entire army of android based phones each of which have one or two stronger points against an iphone from the same generation. They take one iphone and compare one feature with the same feature in another phone then take another feature of iPhone and instead of comparing it will the same phone they compare it with a completely different phone known mostly for that feature. And when everything else fails people end with the cost factor and say android is better overall for that price point. If you really want to be fair than compare it with one phone at a time taking all of its features at once and then see how iPhone really is an overall better phone.
I'm usually a fan of your videos but this time was a big miss,you went out of your way to make the iPhone look better in this comparison you ignored all the faults it has software wise like locked and set operating system that limits you as a user this really feels forced,not to mention that the comparison should be between ios and android
I use Android. I don't an iPhone. Those who want it, go buy it.
Rubbish comparison, means nothing and too subjective. Compare two handsets directly.
I love your content but this was the most biased video
How can eco conscious people buy an Iphone when you have to buy a dongle for everything. Arun even you mentioned this. Android is way less of an impact with singular chargers etc.
Such a bad review! Point to appl for being greener?  The use kids in China to build there phone!! I never met a person with I phone that didn't have a smash screen!!! Photo quality?  Did you try taking pictures in the night with iPhone!? Charging speed its not even at the same plant!! It's start to look like paid review.
Is an iPhone better? Yes it is but the thing to consider is.. most of us do not make over 1k a month. It's just how it is so most people will not be able to have an iPhone and in that case Android saves the day and it does it pretty well. Most of the time I do not feel embarrassed to have an Android or feel like I can't do stuff due to having an Android. Now if we would all be rich in this world than I'm sure everyone would have an iPhone. Take my example.. I'm a specialized engineer in Europe and make less than 1500€ a month working full time and the thing is the "poorer" the country the more expensive things are! Crazy I know.. but for me having an iPhone is a luxury that would maybe make me struggle with other financial important stuff. There are decision you have to make in order to have a better/easier life and having an iPhone is just not an option in my country. I would say that in every 10 portuguese phones.. one is an iPhone. It's not cuz people here think iPhones are trash.. it's just cuz it is like owning a Lamborghini for an american citizen.. it's sth not everyone can have
If you are “genuinely” concerned about the planet: you should probably have a basic phone and keep it until it dies. A new phone every year or two is not really “genuinely” concerned about the planet.
Lighting is not actually sucks, its just not same as usual in yours video, wich as close to perfection, so dont even mention it, most viewers never can tell the difference)
couldn't watch this video to the end, the sheer stupidity of the arguments was making me lose brain cells...
android fangays butt hurt in chat
All these youtubers are hyped to iphone that iphone will always win.and both these guys are making themselves tiny day by day.
I have used both and I will always choose Samsung , also how are you going to give apple a higher score on display when Samsung makes apple's screens. Try not to follow the crowds.
It should be samsung vs iPhone and this video looks apple sponsored. Personally, I feel samsung is ahead of game over apple in many aspects.
You can tell Arun is a big fan of MKBHD but I think that's what made this video kinda biased because you could see how Arun had different opinions on a few things but that would result in a tie, so every time that he might've disagreed it would be a tie. I agree with other comments, that you guys should have each had your score and then come up with a final rating or just leave those out for people to decide.
How can you be "cussing out" anything, let alone Siri, if you are English? Have a backbone, sir.
Marques is literally dickriding apple
You forgot to add a watermark somewhere in the video "sponsored by Apple".  Because everything you say is utter nonsense)
the only reason i still use  iphone is the support for the biometric camera by 3D apps. other than that, android is the best
Yeah, ask the apple fan boy which is better. Yeah, OK. THUMBS DOWN
This is the first video of yours that I didn't really enjoy watching
very lame discussion
They are both amazing, but I bring it down to this.  Apple = More stable Android = More customizable
I've been shocked how very much "biased" this clip was, more even shocked it's from you two.  Like "what happened ??"
What about notifications? They are very easy to miss on iOS. Android creates a notification per conversation in a smart and organized way. This forces iOS people to check apps manually instead of the notification center, because iOS of notification center's drawbacks.
Sorry but your talking pure nonsense,  there's no way  13 beat s22 by that much.
you sold yourself to apple????
Sooo biased
MKBHD kinda ruined this video. Usaully this channel feels completely non biased in any and every review but it's clear that he over stretched everything for apple.
Simple. Apple is like Bentley while Android is like Toyota. Now pick which suits you best.
Am confused on which phone to use now....  Any suggestions and help
Android can be treated like a USB thumb drive…Apple can not allow direct file (pictures, videos, audio) browsing.
not all the andriod kids crying in the comments LMAO
This video is sponsored by Apple.
Display: Android  Performance: Tie, but iPhone has a slight edge.  Battery: Android  Camera: Tie, but Android has a slight edge.  Software reliability: iPhone  Software Features: Android  Assistant: Android (Google)  Software support: iPhone  Value: Android  Bragging: iPhone
So wait, which out of these did you actually score based on YOUR opinion too and not just MKBHD? This should be retitled as (ratings by MKBHD) instead of (ft MKBHD)
Thanks for the Apple sponsored message via Marqass Brownlee! Amazing video!
Im half android, half iphone as you see. 😊
Fully Sponsored by Apple
MKBHD 🍎🍎🍎🍎📱📱📱📱🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
Games are awesome in iphone.
Everyone can see the reality of Paid Promotion for iphone do you think we are fool 😠😡😡😡😡😡Android is the Clear Winner it has better display, sharp camera better processor, durable, finest build quality ever and beauty in any phone
why does this looks like Iphone(mkbhd) vs samsung(mrwhosetheboss)
14:12 where does this idea come from that Apple does better years later? It took them 7 years to add wireless charging and all they did was like it proprietary as a cash grab. They added widgets 15 years late but they aren't as customizable. Same with customizable lock screens, tablet multitasking, all features that came years late and were worse than their counterparts
BS. So much biasedness!
As a Pixel owner I've never taken a picture and not have it be there in the morning. I think whatever phone you have a preference for taints your ability to blindly judge between the two.
when each ones channels android vs ios comparison tells a different story than here,
@Mrwhosetheboss I Love it !!!! It was a Great Compare Video. I am Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra User and  I hope some day to be Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max User.
I left apple iPhone 7 years ago and never looked back.  I'm with the new News 👉 DROID 😎
They’re both good end of story
LETS GO iOS!!!
I guess alot of the choices for Marques were very much mature and practical from a reality perspective. Although it's true that Android has crazy customizations, tons of options and all kinds of bells and whistles, most of them are more of a 'gimmick' or 'niceties' at best that doesn't break the deal. I use Android, but I've used iPhones and I'm gonna say this with confidence that the iPhone is a perfect daily-driver hands down. No offense.
Both gys my hero💐💐❤️❤️
How could you give a draw for a screen and win to an iphone for customization? Really?
feels really apple sponsored video
It is not surprising that these two guys are at the top of their field.
Its absolutely bullshit Iphone can beat high end Android gaming phones lol Like Red Magic 7 Pro, higher GPU score with switchable 120Hz and two fully automatic internal fans, try play high graphic games like Genshin Impact for 2 hours straight on Iphone and see frame rates drop below 40, full performance long gaming sessions are only possible for Android phones with internal fans.
fact that u r c omparing them itself says a lot ..diff is not much...iphone was the way ahead earlier but now..iphone is not  innovating enough while other catching  it fast..sooner android witll outpass iphone
Android is an OS, iPhone is a phone. That's all I have to say.
MKBHD IS JUST PURE BS.
You both guys didn't do the true justice for this review and it is totally a biased video.
that's a total rubbish ... iphone is far backward in customisation, usability, productivity, photography, multimedia consumption, design and 8k video and so on in comparison with s22 ultra ... i got that ugly phone 13 pro too and i know it's day and night difference between them. Please don't make this type of rubbish contents as the guy is totally biased and probably paid by Apple
WACK . TRY AGAIN .
This doesn't feel like Apple Vs. Android more like MKBHD's opinion, why he likes Apple better. But for the price Android provides you everything better and that margin Apple wins by a lot so, that doesn't feel right. Marques is saying everything is apple and Arun is countering it, but then maybe because Mkbhd is the guest he just gave the point. I have one Sim and used both Android and iPhone, but I still had an Android with me without a sim just because some things are better with Android. So if it's only one phone then it's Android for me. This is my opinion 😁🤷.
Biased review, we need a neutral reviewer or 4 strong reviewers, 2 who favour apple and 2 who favour Samsung
Mkbhd is paid by apple
I haven’t watched this video yet, but I’m making a prediction that the conclusion will be something like.. “they’re both great options, but it depends what you’re looking for in a smartphone” lets see 🥤🍿
I'm so broke that I have to watch this video and be interested in because they are out of my league and it helps me learn more
so this is basically an apple promotion video
does anyone knows what the background music is. it sounds familiar but i cannot remember
iphone had taken away headphone port and called it a feature😅😅😅
i thought it's going to be a debate. never heard mrwhosetheboss argue about anything😅😅😅
The amount of bugs I encounter on my pixel 5 vs my 4 yr old iPhone 7 has now made me a big big apple fan. I just cant afford to buy a new iPhone rn, but if I could I would have no second thoughts at all
Let's compare OS to a Phone 😉
iPhone vs android i think its iOS vs android…btw I use Siri only for set timer for cooking
A lot here say they're biased, but i actually agree with them. I still think iPhones are the better "Phone" and actually not trying so hard.
Screen multi-tasking is useful to those who knows and do multitasking
One top of the range phone pitted against THE AVERAGE OF SEVERAL phones. Hardly a level playing field to begin with.
I'm gonn unsubscribe u nowon
i don't know why they made this video
these two dumb guys paid by apple that's why they saying apple is better in any function and features.. don't spread fake explanation..
Bro sorry I loved all your videos but this guy actually uses iPhone and I think he doesn't use Samsung that's why every clear win for Samsung he deflect it for Apple and that's unfair too🤨
As tech reviewers you really should have picked apart updates more. I could sort of also give the win to iPhone, but the fact that older iPhones miss out on features are too seldom mentioned. On Android, if you lack the hardware, you don't get the update. On iOS you get sort of a "update light" and that could be good...or not.  Then there is everything with Play Services and all other things on the backend. An older Android could be more modern then an older iPhone. Despite the iPhone getting "updates".  Otherwise a great video. And yeah, overall iPhone is "better", but to me Android always win!
These men are closet Apple fan bois
Compare Price You Will Get Real Winner 🏆 😂🤣😂🤣.
For the first time, you seem biased.👎🏻
Hey Mr. Android has got Nearby Share
I've been a 'deep' apple ecosystem user for years, and moving to android was hell-ish.  There are definite things i love and hate about both systems, its practically a tie for now, but not for long. For example:  My Samsung can "on paper" do most of the things my Iphone can, but in reality, Samsungs Face ID can be tricked with a photo of my face, and isn't always reliable, e.g. in the Dark. My leg can also activate the samsung screen non-stop in pocket, causing a remote wipe of my samsung pay info. Though the camera has great photo quality but bloody slow shooting when compared to my iphone. Niche Google Apps that work today often stop working after a few updates, and need to find new alternatives on the play store etc. When other users send you a apple emoticon, it comes through as a text "john smith laughs @ *your comment*...   Apple Iphone sucks in a different way. Even though it's Face ID pay is amazing, works in pitch black. But it completely fails in the simple things, like allowing you to have private mode / photo albums etc. Unlike Samsung's Knox sandbox, which allows you to have a phone within a phone (kind of like parallels on a mac), on  a iphone, you cannot sort any photos you hide. So if you want to run a business and do a presentation Tony Stark style, be ready for every man and their dog, cat, wife and children to be flashed all over the screen, or be prepared to start hiding every pixel of your personal life like its a big bag of un-sortable shame (or take it out of the apple ecosystem with a third party app). Because, lets be real... the only realistic option on a iphone in this case, is to have a 2nd phone with entirely different identity and apple app account with full duplication. And don't even get me started with the lack of USB-C, even though they put thunderbolt on all the new macbooks and ipads. I mean... why go half way... And the file management... *sigh*  The verdict is I can't go back to apple because of problems that are definitely within their power to fix, but probably never will. (It's apples way or the highway mentality). Android phones on the other hand, a slutty one size fits all, has all the freedom, even if its half baked and experimental, atleast you have something to get by with. Neither phone is near perfect.  Apple had the upper hand, because it was one of the first smart phones to use a universal connection, i.e. the USB, and offered to play well with computers. Their macs had bootcamp for windows... but no more. It doesn't play well with anything these days. A loner in the corner.  My somewhat half arssed Samsung can connects wirelessly to windows for calls, msgs and photos, backs up to onedrive and is starting to catch up to that apple ecosystem point of difference. The new Surface Pro 8's also more versatile with file manipulation than my iPad... Being someone that owned an iMac, two Macbooks, 2 iPads, airpods, apple tv's, several iphone generations, and used apple music, I'd say apple won a few battles, but is losing the war.
There are some things in settings that just get annoying in iPhones, when you can't change a certain thing. Also things like having music play in the background on iPhone for free used to be tricky but for android was a walk in the park. I think now it's probably more even through the browser apps like Brave and Opera on both systems. I will be staying with Android because when I want a fun change to my phone I can easily customize it significantly. One thing I hate about Androids, especially there value options, is the software updates are severely lacking. Software Updates should be a more major concern for smartphone developers, in this category IPhone does it justice. I like androids usb-C port, it just allows for example your laptop charger to be used for your phone or if you have a fast charging phone vica versa. This way you don't have to carry 2 chargers at all times, and having a default back up, which is either your phone or laptop charger is a peace of mind, for people that don't want to pack a bunch of cables or don't want to buy different chargers.
"This video is sponsered by apple"
I will always choose android over any operating software....
Iphone 13 pro max  has more value in the second hand market as compared to flagship android I don’t understand why point was given to android.
I have been pure android user..... this video made me buy the iphone 13 pro max.... Lets see how life would be. So far so good.
This test was obviously made to make an iphone seem as better phone than samsung, its not even possible that an iPhone has a better battery life than a samsung
I love Android!!!
Cant have gta vc on an iPhone for free 🤭👋
I love watching both of their content but it felt like a lot of important issues were missed purposefully - a little biased maybe...  Eco friendliness: no mention made of iPhone forcing you to buy proprietary charges for decades, the waste from their charges and cables that just stop working because of Apple is immense.  On the software updates: totally glossed over Apple purposefully slowing down older model devices. While there are cases of Android device screwups from certain manufacturers it is limited to that subset, when Apple does it, it's to their entire user base.
I respect and watch both of your channels, which is why I'm disappointed that this video is so obviously biased. One example: The iPhone is less eco-conscious than any android platform that I know of. If they cared about the environment, they would repair people's broken phones, instead of replacing and discarding phones that may be easily fixed. Also pushing so hard against right to repair says the exact opposite about the company; they don't want you to fix a broken iphone, they want to throw it in landfill and make you buy another.  Some of the reasons were ridiculous. Iphone wins because “The most boring team to watch is often the best one" giving all credit to iphone for having a solid platform, when there are androids with comparable quality and even better tools to express artistic expression.   Most of the topics brought up ended up being heavily weighed by one specific aspect that apple does well, instead of comparing the two as a whole.  Here's one of the largest issues with this video: you're comparing one company to many different companies that have a different level of quality, which will, in turn only lower the quality of any one company in its class. The only way to correctly make this video would be to make an iPhone vs Samsung comparison. Android is not a phone; it's a base operating system and none of the phones compared in this video even have stock android, they're all bloated and edited in different ways.
Privacy!
overall it hink this is totally wrong you are comparing a entire class of phones to a phone you can say samsung vs apple but not android vs apple it has to be ios vs apple becouse how you guys are saying it android wins becouse theres always a android thats better then apple at something
Okay let's pretend this video never existed ! this is the most ridiculous, inaccurate, biased, misinformative comparison i've ever seen .. i'm disappointed Mrwhosetheboss !
What is worse, cancer or aids?  Where is my Ubuntu Linux phone?
27,753 comments. Wow! That's got to be a record!
Bullshit video.
this is sooo wrong in so many ways  u r comparing iphone with overall android market from 100$ to 1200$  on the other hand u r competing a 1200 iphone  not in favor of android but this is not how to compare u choose specifically hat if compare to certain phone etc etc @mrwhosetheboss @Marques Brownlee
MKBHD has openly stated that he is a apple fanboy. Watch the video where he gets his very first iPhone. I'm not surprised by this video at all. I just wanted to hear what they would say about Android this year 2022.
This is clearly Apple sponsored
I lost all respect for this youtuber after watching this shit apple sponsored video
Iphone spy... Missed scoring for Android.
Apple sponsored video....... Even that nigga uses an Android phone but that white gay wants apple very Badly to win
I think that android 100% beats iPhone in photography and software
I feel like mr who's the boss had no say in any question and that mkbhd answered every question, I think we need a video where both opinions are added
I wonder who spencer's you guys the most
Apple was definitely the favorite
Android is better than ios
This dude has stock in Android. Ask questions and when you dont get the answer your looking for. Call it a Draw? If he were doing the review it would be 88-0 Droid.
But splits screen, rom, floating these are some great features
Android users boutta be mad 😂
open source vs closed source.
For me, having only used Android, I would stay with Android as I know how to use it. I've tried to help people with and iPhone and its, I don't really know how to do many things. It would be step learning curve.
Y are u asking the most biasedperson on earth?
Nah.... Iphone repair is a POS... you can not buy parts anywhere, they software lock the parts so even if you happen to get the parts they will not work... Samsung is another that started to copy Apple in that regard, so Samsung can go to hell as well... Flagship does not mean the best anymore, it just means expensive, non repairable, lack of real features and an ecosystem fly trap. They all want you knee deep on their cloud services paying for the storage they ripped off your phone. 4k video capable phones with 128-256GB non expandable storage. Paying more than a laptop for a phone with bare minimum storage.
Mr Whos the boss seems to be really enjoy iPhone more than android
What major games aren’t available on android? Like I feel it’s the other way around I feel like when people develop a game because most people use android they always build a game for android like you’re just missing out on the biggest share of the market if you don’t make your game available on android and anything that’s Apple only is probably some ridiculously silly simple game and no major label like call of duty or Diablo Genshin impact or just major games that everyone wants to play or always going to be available on android now if it’s some weird niche I version of candy crush yeah that might only be available on Apple but as far as any games that any real gamer would want to play it’s all going to be available on android.
A very neat comparison and I agree it is true in every category. But I go for android primarily for the customization I used to call freedom, then grew up with smartphones doing custom ROM and other minority geeky stuff. I believe somewhere down the line Google tried to redesign the android OS from scratch but could not do it because the ecosystem had become so huge by then. The big plus for Android I see is I get different flavors of the same phone from different manufacturers around the world. You guys skipped security or data privacy. Not sure who wins?
Turned off the video as soon as I heard "Eco Conscious"
Jesus how does camera go to iphone or battery like wtf
I started with iPhone 2G imported from US to UK. Last iPhones was 6S+. Then I tried Android and for me Android wins. Hands down. Xiaomi with 120hz and fast charging is way much better than over priced expensive piece of jewelry like iPhone.
Yeeah no, once you brought up the environmental point I dropped the video. Giving the point to Apple when they are and have been consciously using proprietary cables and peripherals, forcing you to use their stuff and making it impossible to replace parts, literally bricking your phone if you try to do it yourself. Remember we're talking about the company that dropped the headphone jack, meaning anyone who still uses wired headphones is forced to buy wireless ones if they want an iphone. It feels super weird cause in all other videos i feel you're honest with your topics, this just doesn't feel right
This is difficult to look at, seems to be more personal preference than actual stats.
Can tell there's some Apple bias here.  Dxomark is data proof that android have better cameras. If you're going with apple on that. Then you may as well not bother making this video
The bias on the iphones tho☠️☠️
if iphone could handle floating apps on multitasking, I would have switched to iphone already. Video and battery is the prime selling point for iphone i guess. but choosing over which is better is still subjective and personal biases. if you have your ecosystem that you need to maintain out of convenience then it adds to the weight.
Brought to you by Apple....
what was that last hand shake trial thingy 🥲🥲🥲🥲
MKBHD is soo Biased. Whyyyyy !!!!
What about repair-ability
Imagine these boys comparing iPhone camera to Huawei, Samsung etc. We recently compared the latest IPhone's camera to Xiaomi and the result was no news.. iPhone was disastrous.   Android is far ahead of iphone in every category  these boys talked about.   Who in their normal sense will compare iOS apps to Android compatible apps. iOS has just about 0.5% of android apps while almost every app on the App Store can be found on Google Playstore. Android based TVs including Nvidia shield etc are way way ahead of the funny iOS TVs  which are largely incompatible with most apps, even with tweaks.
Funny boys. These guys are so clueless about what Android is.  Over 75% of things that can be done with Android cannot be done with iPhone. Meanwhile there's nothing on iPhone that cannot be done on Android. Actually it is common knowledge among tech folks that iPhone is one of the most useless inventions ever
Stfu Apple hatters, made the comment section look like shit, just like they're aNdRiod phones
Can i also just say - the music is so lit!
Loved it, both of my favorites to watch and being able to see you guys rocking together is the bomb. Great feedback for those devices.  I'm still getting the s22 ultra tho, we all know it's better than the iPhone in every aspect
? u shoot photo and next day it isn't in the gallery? what is this guy smoking?
I actually scored these at Android 5.5 vs Apple 4.5 - and to be fair, Android has an unfair advantage thanks to the fact it can be licensed by any phone manufacturer rather than just one company. But it was also Apple's choice to operate in such a restrictive way.  Display: Android Performance: Apple Battery: Apple Camera: Tie Eco: Android (because if this is something you care about there are hyper-eco friendly Androids) Software: Apple Features: Android Assistant: Apple Software Support: Android Value: Android
The great thing about Android is that there is a device that will beat iPhone in any given category, but there's no singular Android that outclasses it in every category. Since the average user has some features they care about, and others they don't, it's more likely that there exists an Android device that is better suited to them than the iPhone.
What I’ve heard was “American” “Briish” 😂😂
I have a S21 FE phone is my personal and I have a iPhone 13 pro in my job but I preferred the Android phone I don't care about  consistent or status I preferred the Android over the iPhone is just so uncomfortable to use compare to Android and is more boring in overall...
Android wins, why? Back button. I dunno how much time i wouldave saved if i was android dev instead of iOS dev, saving time designing stupid back buttons. Also the comparison is absolutely unfair and biased.  As a person with X80 pro and iPhone 13 pro , i pick x80 every day any day over 13 to take pictures and videos.  Android has broad spectrum features like AOD, NO NOTCH and USB C fast charging and much more.  Iphone,  well it just works and thats it. But Android is like on a different level.
What's interesting though is that even though the iPhone seems to win, every single tech and phone YouTuber uses an Android. So there must be an X factor.
You forgot to complete who's use more sweatshop in China
Meanwhile Sony goes; Hold my beer.... both phones use sony sensors :P
One of my biggest problems with IOS apart from technicality issues is that they discontinue the software for older versions of iPad or iPhone even though you may have the hardware in perfect working condition. All android phones are easily upgradable and useable.
Apple cares about planet? Why dont you put a BS warning before the video?
Team android here easy
I will always be a Android fan.
This is Android vs iOS not iPhone 🤦
iphones are phones for people with massive social lives android is good for people who wants to experience everything not not related to just social media like pictures and video sharing or whatever they call it.
siri gets on my nerves not answering questions while I'm driving. she can't even set an alarm for more than 24hrs in the future. faceID only was so lame during covid prior to update. but iMessage airdrop and battery life and smoothness of boring operating system is where iphone really accels in my world
one of the things about iphone that's most aggravating is not being able to pause while recording in native app and uploading videos or processing them can't be done in the background without having issues
Apple's ecosystem is like a prison that the prisoner (apple) doesn't want you to get out & that prison is fortified again with a wall of restrictions on every step u wanna take. For doing simple to simpler things one has to go into settings every time in iPhone whereas in android you can do anything you want with ease that too without restrictions 😅
In just 5mins i found this video full of shit without facts that they miss pretty conveniently, actually they are talking about what an iPhone can do but Android can't not the other way around like what Android can do even decades before that apple still can't do & for the question that at the end android will be ahead or iPhone that this stupid fellow mrwhosetheboss answered iphones will be ahead just bcz they take time to polish and make it work completely forgot that till the time apple reaches to android, Android will again be on the next level that too again decades ahead. Enough of the jokes they cracked.
I remember the days when MXBHD use to have Pixel as his main phone
Android users are not happy 😂
Android phones are of utmost value! Here is why! First, you can buy one without burning a hole in your pocket!  Second, with time, budget phones are getting better and better. Whether it's a camera, processor, or design, a budget phone offers good value for money.   Third, a mid-range Android phone packs all the incredible and efficient features and components that are essential for a regular user.  Fourth, even with a tight budget, one can easily hop on to a new phone in a year or two max.   P.S. Android phones are for everyone, iPhones have a specific audience.
Android is an OS. iPhone is a phone. what exactly are you comparing here?
Thank god th YouTube hd remove dislike button man
My Android work better with everything around me, apple does not. The closed system limits you, a specially in countries where apple is not as widely used. And remember an Android phone is yours, your iphone belongs to apple, they decide what you can and can't do with it.
Anyone else notice actual apps run better on iPhone especially games ? Does anyone know why that is and why many andriod lag on games and some apps
What the heck, so Samsung has a better screen but it's a draw. First guy is definitely a fanboy, I don't care if he is one of the top tech savvies reviewers in the world, he is still a fanboy. Regarding to the camera the first time I tried to take a picture on Iphone it didn't take it, I had to try 4 times, coming from Android I didn't understand what was going on, the reason why it didn't work was because Apple kind of forces you to use the camera in automatic, so it didn't focus well. I always use my Android camera in manual, thus I had never had that issue.
This is biased interview. The guy is clearly iphone addict
In the performance section you forgot to mention storage speeds, you only compared CPUs and GPUs in my opinion its a tie in overall performance  there are android phones that will win every category you just mentioned but you're only comparing popular flagships  bugs you mention in software reliability completely rely on what apps you have installed on your android device BECAUSE android gives apps so much freedom (its almost too much)  software features in my opinion goes to android because its so customizable you can add your own features  widgets rely on the developer that made them there are good android widgets if you look for them   alternative title: two apple fanboys discuss why iPhone is slightly better than every single phone running Andriod
Late to the game on responding to this one. I have a Samsung G22U and IP13 pro so I can appreciate both however... seriously... really... granted a lot was subjective... this was a pretty biased video and both of you can do better then that.
The new iOS lockscreen widgets kind of remind me of the Windows Phone widgets in a good way.
Android has Tasker, iPhone does not. That's 20 points to android in a nutshell
I know this is VERY subjective stuff, but I feel this video is biased towards iphone's, some of those draws should have been wins for Android, also the economic win for iphone I mean wtf, they are basically the worst at that all things considered, please DONT take apple's numbers as gospel please, go to phone repair shops etc and/or watch some Louis Rossman.  I understand that iphones's will probably win out in the end overall (disregarding value), but not by the margins seen in this video, not even close.
I love android...but this is 100% accurate. Apple is getting very nice.
This video is pretty biased. Comparing an OS to a Phone, considering apps as Phone features just because those apps are made by the phone manufacturer
Two of my fav tech channels Collab .....it's fire 🔥
This video has been compromised by apple.
If this whole shit was tagged iOS vs Android, it would have made a lot more sense than comparing an actual product that's running on a particular OS and compared to a whole OS on its own. As much as I know and can say, Android is not a smartphone on its own, it's an operating system.  Take one branded product that's being powered by Android (say Samsung, Xiaomi, LG etc) then place it side by side with the iPhone which is running on iOS and let's see which one takes the largest cut.  It's kinda getting too scary to say, but I'm just trying so hard to believe I didn't actually spend an entire 20 minutes watching some kinda clout-chasing-clip from a guy who doesn't even know what he's doing. ʼCos that MKBHD was obviously very biased with his responses then use the question of CHOICE to cover up his lapses.
Did not expect a biased video from you guys. You missed USB type-C, which is very important for inter operability. You missed the existence of IR ports, fingerprint scanners, expandable storage etc. You missed the part where, iPhones look same for generations.
good its work
20:08 was he trying to fist-bump?  NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN didnt work so great huh?
Mkhd is pretty doppy. Iphone fan boy.
🇳🇵💎🌍🇳🇵🌜🌞🇳🇵
By the results, they've wasted our time. Duo is better than imessage, having a pen could have been a Plus to Samsung, Notifications is more customisable on Android, U swipe left & right on a Samsung to call/text, I love Pixel camera than Samsung but IPhone Camera is better than Samsung. I do use iPhone 12Pro n Galaxy s22 ultra, still missing my Pixel 4XL
iphone is just way to pricey for what your getting. Has not got usb c no sd card no headphone jack and a closed ecosystem. Android for me all day long.
Seems highly unfair 😁😁 But hey, I always knew Arun was an Iphone Lover :D
Iphone is great no doubt . But in bangladesh its a pain in the ass . Because of no support and the battery health percentage is mental torture. Cuz u buy the phone for 100percent health and 3month later it might drop under 90 and u lose quite  a lot of resell value. Super annoying and the only reason i sold my 12pro max and switched to s22 ultra
The best software feature is ''Samsung good look''
Unfortunately all my friends have iPhones which mean FaceTime and blue messages so I have to stick with iPhone 😔
nokia is very environmentally conscious by not selling any phone
I DIDN'T KNOW MARK WAS AN APPLE FAN BOY.
So you took the biggest apple fanboy on the internet and he rated the iPhone the winner on pretty much everything. I'm shocked!
MKBHD seems to talk about androids like its windows vista. =/
The thing is so so many people can't afford iphone and also iOS can be extremely difficult to use in some countries and usb c just destroys lightning (which was actually lightning fast before but now it's more like micro usb which was last used in 2016)
CRapple crumbling down 2 usb-c
Bias asf  Mkbhd is basically sponsored by apple now  Like some points don't even make sense and they just give the points to apple 💀 Android would have won but mkbhd is basically a mf apple head Arun tried to give android points but mkbhd just threw in some random trash info  Truely Bs comparison
thanks for our sponsor: Iphone.
Always On Display Is Only Available In Android
It's evident that the guy loves iphone.
On android you can install any apps without the permission of the manufacturer. I can transfer anything without using any PC software. To use an iPhone the way I would want to use an iPhone, I would have to jailbreak it. My android phone isn't even rooted. I can change the launcher app whenever I want. I can replace the browser whenever I want. I can install custom firmwares if I wanted to. On iPhone, no one develops custom firmwares anymore.(whited00r, for instance.) I don't know why.
It's Just like iphone ads
This would be a better vid if they weren't blanketing all the different Android manufacturers as an average vs Iphone. We want individual company breakdowns, why say a market leader phone vs the average video when we know that if we did a market leader phone vs another market leader phone the video would be less "Sponsored by Apple" in feel (and likely in actuality). From the rhetoric in this video it truly feels like..., they know Samsung wins most these categories despite the bias.
I have a Sony L3 (£99) which has a bigger screen than my iPhone 13 pro (£950).  The Sony L3 has a great screen and works well but I prefer the iPhone 13 pro. Update: I now have a Nokia C21+ (£79) which is even better than the Sony L3. But I still prefer the iPhone 13 pro.
Draw on the display seems a bit bs tbh 😅
Yay, more stuff i can't afford
I have a question to MKBHD, if iPhone is that good then why didn't you give that award to iPhone that time, when you were giving awards to smart phones.. just asking 😁
Now I would like to see a comparison between MacOS and Windows
Both of them use an ANDROID as their daily driver. End of debate.
They forgot adding " This video is sponsored by Apple"
This one is so bs..
Nice to meet in both of you  On one frame 🥰 YouTuber's
Are you guys even using the s22 ultra?
Android is so much better.  What game are you talking about????
Yep, totally biased.
I've not seen such an outrageously biased comparison in a very long time.
Really cool video thanks to the people that are in it, but the topic is silly imo. It's almost impossible to truly compare the two because it's kinda not fair. Android is the clear winner just on the merit of Android covering thousands of phones with a variety of phone for anyone and everyone. You can make a slightly better comparison if you just discussed the OS but even then you still have some of the same problem.  Android is akin to an entire world of possibilities while IPhone is just one ecosystem albeit a fantastic one it's still never going to have the innovative advantage of tens of thousands of engineers  working on Android globally while IPhone only has whatever staff they directly employ.
messaging system is the only ios software thats superior
My now well worn OnePlus3 charges fast and it makes a lot of difference. You definitely notice the difference when you go to a slower charging much younger Samsung.
It missed out on real word factors which aren't about the phone. Repair services, variety, third party device compatibility, long lasting phones without having to buy a new one every year. Apple restricts it's services, whereas android lets you use third party services which provides a variety, availability and cheaper expenses
they scared from Apple co  money talk ya
iphone 80% hardware part from Samsung what a Shame  😂😂😂
fake tech guy who think ever iPhone better than Android In the practicality and Efficiency  when i used Android i don't  need to used laptop or pc must of time.  to run some applications or tasks when covid 19 pandemic start we start Work from a distance I'm proud to say i do all my work tasks on my android phone the opposite with the rest of the co-workers who use iPhone  android phones to me is you can used freely and enjoy what you do and you not bored at all  cheers to android community 🍺
This seemed very biased like you guys when the android would be ending out ahead you’d give it a draw or to apple for some reason
iPhones have better gaming performance most of the time, but the annoying Achilles heel is the display dimming when it starts to get warm
How about Elon Musk π smartphone?
I have a s21 ultra, an I've compared it to a 13 pro max and the s21 is way better
Ive been an android users for years i really like the freedom and customization on android even though samsung doesnt support their phones still works i had a samsung grand prime still working like brand new iphone on the other hand support their phone for years but when that time comes they stop supporting even the phone dies sometimes really like the battery life on the iphone is alot better
I think screen wise, if you are comparing the best of iPhone, that's the pro or pro Max, it can't be vs all of Android right? Has to be vs the plus and ultra. Hence I'd say the clear winner is samsung there.
Fake comparison.. Android is far better than iPhone. Just like the days of Nokia, it depends on where it was made.. In those days I prefer Hungary, Germany, or Finland's Nokia Products to China's Nokia products.. Av seen so many iPhone users always carrying Power banks along anywhere they go. Because of the discharge rate of the iPhone battery. This is the worst comparison ever from you guys..  Both of you were paid by apple to diminish Android. Android is a big Family compared to iPhone. If HTC and Nokia were in the game, it would have been a different story.  I just hate you guys so much for this lame comparison.
I don't like the visuals or experience in iOS. It is a personal opinion.
Please talk more about the ecosystem of applications. iOS is closed and has ridiculous control over App developers. Moreover, iOS is such a closed system that only iPhone can use it. To me these are two negatives. Anytime Samsung makes it too difficult for app developers I give them a negative as well.
I’d say Android wins the eco consciousness category since you can actually fix them with a 3rd party or by yourself
Messi vs Ronaldo battle
APP CHOICE! One big thing that factors in on Android is apps and app stores. Without even going to the radical customization like ROMs and Root, you can simply install whatever apps you want, or whatever app store you want. With iPhone, you may or may not get polished apps more often, but at the end of the day, Apple or certain governments that pressure Apple, can get apps removed from the App store. With Android, if an app gets pressured out of one app store, you can grab it from another, or grab it directly from the programmer's website. This also allows you to archive old app versions. Apple? You can ONLY install it from the app store. But it's for your safety of course. And with open source stores like F Droid, you can bypass the google tax. Apple will unalive before it allows any app to bypass the apple tax. Google just allows you to download app and install.
misleading fake biased video  only dumb people can compare operating systems with stupid basics phone iphone 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I had iPhone 6S and this May I got S22 for a change, and I got to say that I definitely miss the iMessage and FaceTime :(
Don’t mind me, just enjoying myself reading the comment section
Watching this vdo, i felt like arun forgot all relevant topics to talk about for android 😂
BIAS is all I have to say
You are comparing the best of the class only.. this is useless. Focus on what people use most today. It would probably be iPhone xr . And in android it would be samsung a50
Say good night
This is THE MOST (incorrectly) SLANTED  video comparison I have ever seen...and not expected from 2 of the better Tech reviewers I would normally follow.  Screen, Battery Charging, Performance,.....these are all dominated by other Android phones...in fact most of these are dominated by GAMING PHONES.......the other joke here is that there were some topics admitting that Android was better.....but was still selected for Apple?....Wow.  what about innovation (Flipp Phones, folding phones)...Don't make videos so late in the night guys ...
only who saw the full videos knows the full story! 2 tech minds what a interesting convo
So a feeling becomes the measure now ! Man makes money ... the more he makes ... its about time the money start making him to the earliest form of him ... 🤔🤔🤔 ❤️💛💚
It really says something when someone is saying iphones are better in every category yet uses an android.
Bias
Mkbhd is biased with apple. So no surprises here. Mrwhostheboss is neutral i think that's why i'm still subscribed to him. Unfollowed mkbhd because he's such an apple fanboy.
Love your videos so much
OS vs Hardware… Display… wow.
a vendor at an AT&T store said the Pixel 6 was better because it has a flat screen over the Pro's curved and it sounded good for some reason, then I found the phone is garbage. the flat VS curved screen debate always bothers me since then 😂 I'm stuck with it for 2 years
You said their wore a tie in some of them and yet you give the points to just the iphone Dosnt seem reasonable
Holy bias batman!
I tried the iPhone earlier this year and didn't even last two months. iMessage crashed on me twice a week and the keyboard was utter garbage - I've never had to focus and retype on a phone so much in my life.  iPhone's are made for ppl who live in rich countries and ppl who aren't tech savvy. They're also for ppl who don't mind paying for everything, such as calculator or pdf reader apps.
I use both  Why choose when you can have both ? Lol If i had to choose between either i would go with android Iphone feel handicapped for me No file system, no headphone jack, no sd card slot etc
lol tried to reply to some of the comments but YT seems to be giving errors saying not able to reply.
20:08 the moment when arun only got his thumb to shake 😅 mkbhd big hands 🙌
I think what got me is some areas where Android obviously had the edge even if it was small you shrugged it off and just gave no points to anyone, or where Android was a little better but Apple did it fairly well too you gave it a draw.  If it is in one phones favor then just give it to that phone lol.  I agree that this was a weighted competition in favor of IOS in how the questions were asked and what questions were asked.
U  guys sucks with the comparations
iPhone is the best but he still uses a year old predecessor of Samsung S22. .
MKBHD is an iSheep!... why would you even do a comparison with that guy?
Very odd comparison and for one the title of this comparison is an issue. Android is an operating system and iPhone is a device. A better comparison would have been iOS vs Android.
I use a Note 20 Ultra and Samsung Pay with MST,  S-Pen as a pen and remote control , Camera that satisfies a DSLR owner and Dex that has let me leave my laptop behind more than once has made it a game changer without rival.
Comments speaks loud than IOS itself...
you both give apple all then why are you reviewing then
Apple is greedy and was last to include Bluetooth and other features. The Tesla phone can be used anywhere  on the pkanet. Get ready for an upset.
Trash.... only thing Apple has going for them lately is Magsafe...otherwise it's a subpar Android
Must have been sponsored by iPhone 🤷🏿‍♂️
iPhone Vs Samsung next🙏
How can Samsumg Dex not matter to you? Oh it matters to me. It kills Apple 3-0
Lighting was okay Man,👌🏾
Please help lol. I have a Samsung galaxy A52s 5g and it's been fine for a few months but lately battery has been draining so fast. I've changed the brightness, took always on display off and everything I can think of. Any help would be grateful you legend 😁
Siri is only good for basic use You ask google to translate language to language it does within seconds, Siri is not able to do it. and seriously iPhone camera is good but Android is wayyyyy better, 960fps slow mo., Manual Mode and soo much more also On ships Wifi it is impossible to use iPhone since on Android you can just use a single app and stop all the other apps from running or using internet on iPhone it is not possible
I have had Samsung phones for many years and I absolutely hate the curved edges on the screen. It ruined the screen protector market, and I hate the in screen fingerprint sensor. It was much more natural on the side of the phone in the button. Another feature that ruins screen protectors to the point that they have to manufacture some of the strangest crap that typically starts to fall apart within the first few days of install. Not to mention android auto is the worst clunky crap I've ever used. I love my friends apple car play. It's much more polished and functional. My next phone will likely be an apple. Especially if they go USB-c. But for now, I'm sitting here with a 2 year old phone and waiting.
The only advantage apple has is the control of the 3rd party Apps...on Android the quality of them if want to use not only YouTube is embarrassing... That's it. Rest of the video state true facts which you can agree or disagree depends on your need.
Love both of you guys, but this video is not it for me! Too much bias for the iPhone!
Why do people compare android and apple. Android has better specs than any iphone any year since phone were made. And if u know MK then you know he is sponsored by apple. he even redid Linus room with all apple products. Anyone with sight can tell an always takes better pictures. Even a dollar general android can outperform iPhone. They sell inferior tech. The Cadillac of phones. expensive crap.
This was, quite honestly, a disappointing waste of my time. I have subscriptions on both of your channels, but the incompleteness of the information, the sucking up to Apple, the dismissal of many of Android's great and useful features was just embarrassing. You even ignored some excellent iOS features. Just check the thousands of comments.  Do better gentlemen!
I would say bullshit
Loved both of you guys and am a great fan of your works and contributionS regarding tech. Two of the Legends of Youtube and I was super excited when this video popped up in my notification, but .....,,,....!!!! I couldn't have been more disappointed  after watching it (and really cringed at HOW massively BIAS Marques was and the length he put into the arguements up until the point when Apple has some favourable edge ??!!). SORRY GUYS, BUT this may as well would have been the 'Most Un-worthy of Fair comparision videos' you guys had EVER MADE !!! The COMMENTS SECTIONS has 'tens of thousands of proofs' that clearly explains why. Alas, this is the best EXAMPLE OF the kind of controversial videos 'YOU GUYS DO NOT NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN !!!' OMG, I am so hating myself writing anything Negative about you two. SORRY .......
When I first got into handset touch technology, I had always wanted an Apple iPhone, but found that none of the few models they offered were ever affordable, given my budget, while Android offered many choices within my price range... Now almost a decade later, I find that I have just too much time, money, and heartache invested in the Google Ecosystem to switch to iOS now!
Bro you really tied software features with apple and android yet apple still doesn't have close all.
YO! android vs iphone. Category: Eco..... Yeah android has way better eco friendly phones....winner = iphone
This comparison is Bullshit!!!!
I think IPhone’s are to me are garbage! And these guys are absolutely full of shit when it comes to Android phones
I worked for Apple support for almost 2 years and quit ....guess why....forced to lie to customers etc...etc...etc....  and I'm not only one if you could work there for 2 months nobody would buy another iPhone
so everything better on iOS but he uses a S21 ultra for 1 1/2 year...  really cohérent
are u crazy.....I would not have even for free....Americans
This question will never die until either platform is gone.
I recently returned an iPhone 13 pro max and went back to my old S9+.  USB C charging, Google assistant, Google maps are killer apps for me.  I miss airdrop, app choice and "it just works" on iPhone.  If iPhone got USB C I'd consider switching again.  They are both so close in everyday use that small things make a difference.
This has to be sponsored by apple 😂
wow, those reasons for the iPhone winning dont make sense. sounds like someone is getting some of that iPhone money.
MKBHD voice sounds low and disappointed. Did you expect an iPhone victory from the start?
Good video to get super engagement and comments I guess. The comparison on one level made at the flagship level but then also extended to cover all levels.  Which in reality Apple cannot compete at in any regard.   Just look at the price one pays for and iPhone SE, the flagship iPhone screen design and stolen real estate already looks dated already vs near entry level other phones, the SE looks like something Doc went back to get in the Delorean.  Maybe a bit more balance considering this in the ecosystems.  Maybe most Apple uses don't care and pay top dollar for the flagship or close to it (perhaps because say and SE is like WTF), but I think globally it would be fair to say so many other brand phones at 1/4 the price of the flagships are the mainstay and can offer great value to the majority while still providing decent normal use performance, usable pics and good battery life to the average punter.  The majority isn't flagship iPhone price points.  The sheer manipulative trap that is the Apple ecosystem even at the expensive it's own customers experience is something that should also be huge factory,  the by far are and always have been the worst and the worse to work against industry standard.  They charge slow because the use a far inferior port simply to manipulate and trap.  Oddly not on their other devices, again just to annoy their own customers.  If ones going to consider the subtle experience of taking a photo and rate that better but not getting a better photo technically, but consider so many other factors as just these few things, sorry, but it seems a bit bias (which everyone is in ways) hardly fair in a ratings system.
I’m an Android to iPhone switcher and I ain’t going back.
Alternate title: Two apply fanboys talk for 20 minutes
If either the apple or samsung had expandable storage for micro SD...that's game over right there it would be the best phone of choice because nothing quite blows the competition out the park with smartphones when it comes to storage the main thing that smartphones lack the most is storage. And it's also the main thing stopping professional photographers and film makers from using that as their main camera. You can't take long videos because of storage issues and nothing more annoying than running out of storage and your icloud is full as well. Micro SD is something that should've been in every smartphone
Ek Number... you are life saver Bro... :)
How much did Apple pay MKBD?
is like comparing living in china and living in the usa lmao
I love this phone.
Working in R&D for consumer electronics, I have to say that iPhones usually always work better with products. Products are always developed to be optimized for iPhone and android. Having fewer models  with iPhone just turns into a more stable integration. Thats just what i am used to, might be different in the future.
They're just being too soft on the iPhone... it's not that if Apple has a feature too it's 100% better all the time
How high you priced a product define how ugly you are
Come to Zambia and do a YouTube video with me... I will rate these to phone makers, and mobile phone OSs.
Let me tell you the honest truth, you picked an American to rate an American product. Imesaage, facetime, airdrop, are all those features working in every corner of the world?  You need a neutral guest who can rate the phones based on their real performance not a biased rating based on location and personal preference.
Android for life!😂
MKBHD kuch gali type nhi lag rha 😶
Two of my favourite technologies guy’s that take deep dives into the spec sheets, but I have a 3rd guy and that’s flossy carter all my phones I have bought was because of his reviews
Video sponsored by apple   Fin!
This whole video sucked 😕 Two apple fan boys talking bad about andriod
Good lord, I thought Marques was a sucker for Apple but now it's on another level.
He is giving everything to the iphone because he is a fanboy he lost my respect.
no
Most hardworking are android guys in the comment section😂😂😂😂😂
No choice. Lol apple is best
do the same video with jerry rig everything .
I think calling it "Android" vs "iPhone" is inherently problematic as Android should be against "iOS" since Android is NOT a phone, but Android is an operating system applied to thousands of phones every year and an iPhone is the phone exclusively able to use iOS. The closest comparison would be iPhone to Pixel since Pixel is produced by google directly. The big thing that Android wins in is the variables of choice that iOS doesn't have. If I can only afford a low end android, I can get one and update later to a flagship one.
I feel this comparison is bias. Mkbhd and Mrwhosetheboss
What keeps me with android is custom rom.  That's it. No hate to apple.
I don't like the curved screen of my old Samsung Note 9. The iPhone 13 Pro Max has a nice flat screen that makes texting easier. Aside from the S-Pen I've never used a ton of the features of the Samsung phones, but having iTunes integration and a dedicated music player that just works out of the box and didn't require me to hunt around and look for apps without ads in it that work. Also, the iPhone 13 Pro Max doesn't have a weak battery that can be used in my use case nearly 2 days, maybe out of the box the iPhone doesn't charge fast, but using their brick and magsafe charger it goes from 20 ish percent to 100 or nearly 100 say 90ish in less than 2 hours. As for the camera I liked the Samsung camera options and I feel the iPhone camera is very basic, but tbh I never really used those extra settings. Apple really ticked me off in 2008 trying to sell me itunes+ versions of songs I'd paid for so I could use them on my Android. I felt that was scummy, and I droped my iPod/Windows Phone combo and went pure Android, until here recently when Google Play Music went away and now Youtube Music became the single source. They say they imported our library from the cloud into this "new" service but I was seeing ads and also a pay wall to access the music I owned and had previously uploaded to the Google Play music service....so now with the 13 Pro Max and iTunes no longer charging for their itunes+ vesions of songs if you already own them, it was a no brainer what phone to pick this upgrade cycle.
android is jct to good 👍 👌
Brownlee is an apple fan boy ever since so it's a bit bias.
Quick share is like airdrop on iphone. Samsung has music shares. You guys are missing important details that are important to people but overall good work
LIke they said... If you care about iMessage and Facetime then go iPhone. If you don't care about iMessage and Facetime then go Android. Also Android can easily use Facebook messenger for video calls without any issues and like 99% of the US has a facebook account. Battery life on the S22 Ultra and iPhone 13 Pro Max are very close to each other. Most people go throughout their day with some sort of way to charge their phone throughout the day so it's kind of a moot point especially when their battery life is so close. Samsung makes the iPhone's displays so the display discussion automatically goes to Samsung hands down. iPhones are smoother and have better performance only because they develop for a handful of devices whereas Google has to develop an OS that works for the entire world of everything else. That should be a draw just objectively. That is also the only reason why apps 'may' run smoother on an iPhone. The other benefit for iPhones would be availability in the US as far as accessories are concerned. It is such a popular phone that the market for cases is huge. Android, however, has a much larger aftermarket availability for chargers, cables, and just general accessories due to the nature of Android not being walled off with proprietary limitations like iPhone is.  If you want customisation, freedom, multitasking, and an open market then go Android. If you like having your hand held then go iPhone.
Still Prefer Android though ❤
They all spy on you. They all cost a small fortune and they all are electronic leashes. Only difference is preference of software in my opinion.
I hate the iPhone design, lightning and lack of transparency option...but all those reasons mentioned in the video are why I'll go back to iPhone as soon as they stop fucking with disgusting boxy, unergonomic, protuberant, thick bezel and notch bullshit that neither Jobs or Ive or any designer really would have approved, I'll switch in a heartbeat.  The Android smartphones have become worse and worse, unreliable, ugly and sluggish as hell overtime.
I liked the lighting
How's that camera good? FaceTime, on what screen??
Gesture typing matter.  If there are small number of features , of course you're bound to use and stay with these
He didn't let mkbhd speak for eco point or what. B he didn't seem happy
Please i need answers to this @mrwhosetheboss are iphones still made in china or made in the USA. I really dont know the real engineers behind the assembling or making of the iphone shipped worldwide
He didn't think iPhone would get so many
Bro, it's okay to have other people on your channel but it's not to be unnecessarily dominated by them. I see there are parts where you wanted to disagree but you just kept quiet because there was a guest. For example - camera, when you mentioned the Zeiss filter of Vivo we all know how awesome it is because we watched you explore it in depth but just because MKBHD is super impressed towards iPhone you gave it a point. I mean come on, we all know iPhone are generally better but there are lots of areas where Android does much better. You said it yourself.
Apple wins after the feature is in place on an Andriod. So is Apple innovative enough to come out with something before Android?
👍🏼
apple is just 🔥
You guys forgetting how Apple goes out of their ways to discourage repairing their phones when giving the eco score. (Hell...ALL of the products) The planned obsolescence "battery saving" scandal. Inventing chips (the T2 comes to mind) JUST to keep you from being able to repair it yourself with readily-avaiable parts. They encourage you to buy a new one, and then they give you a 10% discount and "recycle" your phone. It's all business.  I mean the list goes on with them and e-waste..Apple is not some great company when it comes to that. Their devices have become progressively less and less repairable, INTENTIONALLY, year over year. They even have a subscription service for people to update every year. Wanna talk about "wasteful capitalism", there you are. I get it that you can't cover everything...but it seems like alot of stuff went to Apple, and apple got the benefit of the doubt at the end.  Sometimes you'd compare iPhone to JUST Android flagships...other times you'd compare it to ALL androids, when it didn't win against the best Android flagships. There wasn't much consistency here....2.5 to 7.5? Really now? And there was no consideration about the annoyance of getting locked into their ecosystem.
6:34 what about the Sony Xephera II
For performance and longevity go for iPhone   For customisations and rough use go for android….
Just two questions. What about the quad HD displays on the android devices versus the iPhone?— wish you pressed on that.  As far as cameras, last year I picked the Samsung S21. However this year the new iPhone has a better macro / larger Ultra Wide and it came in handy to me— also I like Apple Watch camera features.. and I don’t know if deep fusion is doing something but the shots are consistently coming out better on the main camera over my S22 (as if iPhone the new poppier king). Not discussing zoom. And I took a lot of side-by-sides. Now the front facing 40mp camera of the S22 I liked more, seems more sharp. I also like the subtlety with sammy’s built selfie filter—pretty cool haha. However I like the front facing camera of the iPhone in terms with having a wider shot— though I agree with Aaron I think at some point he stated on an earlier video how a lot of the selfies on the iPhone make you look weird which I totally agree. Not to disputing video comparison. Camera seems more jankity on the android and the iPhone more smooth— feels like one camera when zooming for the iPhone. Nice up-to-date comparison overall btw! But yeah oddly I think I’m taking more photos of my iPhone this year!  @mrwhosetheboss
Lol saying a reliable for life when you rush to store for a new Apple phone every year.
You know it's going to be apple you got you always do this Apple's not a winner in this category you're just a winner in your decision of thinking this is the winner of the category Samsung apple or way too expensive for the average user and I don't care about square or rounded or whatever screen it is I don't need the most brightest screen in the world because my eyes are sensitive red lights I can wait an hour for battery charging I can use my phone for 5 hours and I'm okay with that I don't need Samsung for an apple I just need a phone that works takes me through the day I don't need to spend a lot of money on it and that's it guess who wins I do I'm the winner in this situation
The best phone in the world is wait for it the new Apple flagship called aPhone because you really need a phone
This is your worst video review ever. Both of you.
"All of Android"?  How about all of iphone. Not every iPhone has the pro motion and oled.  And you didn't even mention always on display.
Android will always trump Apple on technology and Apple will always trump Android on battery life. Only Americans prefer iPhone and I'm an American. I have both. I prefer Android for personal use. IPhone for business use because of the editing apps available and integration with my iPad. Still prefer Android overall. Siri is useless to me. Google is just a much better assistant. I see both phones are simply tools in a toolbox based on preference. I can see their points, but for me I just prefer Android for everything overall. The customization I get on Android I just cannot get on Apple widgets or otherwise. Good luck changing icons on iPhone.
Mrwhosthestupid and mkbSD not hd you should really see this comments your scoring is very wrong. I mean most of your goddam videos comparing both iPhone and Samsung they both have winning stages. Literally you gave a fucking customisation win to apple just because of a fucking lockscreen widget I mean I am very surprised no one in the comment section mention that. Oh God and the display win for Apple omg lmao
I don't think many people can afford apple products to have that efficient and comfortable apple ecosystem so in terms of OS features android takes it for me and for many many people.
They forgot to mention that this video is sponsored by Apple
I'm pretty sure Apple paid them beforehand.
Android is the best, let the iOS rest.
I used both….Performance and smoothness of ios is where android is at least 4 to 5 years behind but other than that Android wins….Gaming in ios is too good…i play PUBG and there’s not even a render lag…it even records the gameplay in 4k yet it doesn’t drop a frame even for once and i am talking about IPhone 10 chipset….
Android should've cleeeeared the Display (samsung actually makes the iphone displays and use the best in their phones) and Camera ones (android cameras have so much more MPs, can zoom so much more, etc) I understand the 3rd party argument, but for just the camera, android destroys apple. And usb-c is great in batteries, but for the rest I mostly agree. Overall iPhone still wins.
but there is android phones that can fo all that but has amazing gaming specs
Here i am with an android 5 tab s 2 like damn life moves fast
A N D R O I D for sure 🔥🔥
If Apple is making his products from Recycled materials , why are they so costly...there products should be cheaper instead....they arr keeping on increasing the prices every damn year .. Apple doesnt have call recorder (a need of hour) Apple doesnt have truecaller (Extreme need) Apple doesnt have customisations Apple doesnt work well with Microsoft apps  Apple doesn't have range of products, its all high end premium super costly products  Apple have more stability Apple have premium feel Apple have good software updates Apple have less bugs
I just love how apple went from being the butt of all jokes in terms of battery and now they’re winning battery contests.
iPhone is best battery ha 🤣 Try in. A 3-4 month after u bought it is gonna fail u str8 away 👍
@mrwhosetheboss you should just compare samsung to apple instead
Just another Sponsored Video by Apple
So dissapointed with your android vs iphone it feels like you both just tell all good thinks of iphone and all negative things of android it is not a fair versus 👎👎
this video is a little biased, if i may say
Samansang wins every time
just title this video we made a video to explain why we spent 1000$ on apple  its what 2 individual think  doesn't conclude anything
I love you guys but truth be told, you guys were totally biased on this video.
My biggest reasons for staying with Android are Notifications (which are still way better) and the fact that I spend 98% of my time between, Search, Gmail, YouTube, and Google Maps.  Don't get me wrong, imessage and Facetime are very tempting reasons to jump ship.  In the end, competition is good for everyone.
This was so based bro
I switched from Android to IOS and I am happy now. The apps work much better and I love. The camera is the best one I have used
quite a few things actually shouldve gone to android
Honestly i am ok with my redmi note 10 because i am middle class 🤣
Baised towards the iPhone. Almost in every category they said iPhone is the best  But practically it's not that great
There's some kind of awkwardness in room
I’m so appreciative of Arun’s android takes
I think we can all agree iphones are more reliable. Apps don't randomly crash and the battery gets you through the day. Androids may have better features, but iPhone does what little they do very well.
Unfortunately the iphone is way more better than androids.
Samsung DEX mode is really good for android when it comes to multitasking
Pixel ❤️
Love those sharp edges! It's a textile thing. how things feel in my hands is a big deal to me. love the new galaxy! I got an iPhone 12 for work and within a few weeks I put my SIM card into my galaxy s22. But i have to give the apple some nods, as some of the behaviors of the iPhone are nice, neat, and intuitive. But at the same time, it had behaviors that left me scratching my head as to "why?" Overall, it may have just been a native apple thing, with people who do apple have no issues with it, but they bugged me enough to go back to my s22. Plus, though for some this may not  be an issue, But I've always been at odds with Apples business decisions, including allowing politics in the mix, and that impacts my purchases in any field. So while it may seem silly to people who don't think about these things (you should), It's also a point for me when making a decision.
Truly iPhone 📱 and Android  are Totally Garbage 🗑 and if you want to be Truly Eco-Friendly Don’t buy Cellular phones 📞 period!
Bahaha what a joke of a comparison. Android is far superior.
How about Speakerssss!!!! Can you guys talk about the Speakers!!!???
haha talk alot
I once was taking photos with Iphone 13 Pro Max and it just didn't save aroubs 40 photos. I was taking pics in RAW BTW, something I would never do on a Samsung because I get a lot of pink pixls and stuff.
Knowing that Android is an eco system, it should’ve been iOS vs Android
Why the massive bias....both the speakers doubtedly know their stuff....but this video is far from unbiased.
Stupid iPhone 🤣🤣🤣
Fake 😂
SO iPhone and iOS wins by a country mile and android fanboys are all crying… shocker 🤣 fact is they are better in almost every way - that’s just a fact. Not saying android phones are not good, they are just not AS good. Get over it and enjoy your phone, whatever it may be.
how about the question- is iOS just boring?
You can see how MKBHD is so BIOS and subjective with iPhone while Whostheboss is trying to be objective and fair.
You forgot most importantly, Security, Privacy..
BULLSHIT !
Not a great review given it's from their perspective. They have access to the latest a greatest... Most people could get by great with a budget phone. Me I want a phone to read email, send/receive messages, skype, gps and the internet. I want reasonable performance (5g when available) long battery life and fast charging. Guess what I found all that on android phones under $400 even $300 - Xiaomi and Realme brands. I have had an Iphone, no way I am going back. I wish there were more good budget android tablets so when my ipad is obsolete I have some options.
As an Android user I will stick to my Androids and despite what they say in this video but congratulations iPhone on your massive win.  I hope you take over America 100% and the rest of the world can enjoy the variety that Android offers in value, variety and a lot of features that iPhone users can only dream off.  BTW MKBHD, if you double press on power button of Androids you go to camera and that's the quickest on any phones. I think this is for Android 11.0 and up.
Ram is a hard comparison, the phone may have lots of ram, but if the OS takes up a lot of it. Whats tbe point?
This guy seems very bias. Why even ask him questions... his answer 99% of the time is iPhone 🙄
I often watch reviews of the two mobile phones, I want to but don't have enough money to buy it 😇😇
There is android phone with 20,000 mAh, and it lasts for 7 days bro 😐😉😉
Bias black man
MBKHD literally said he is biased in the beginning.
The question must be what do you want in a phone. If you buy used you can have a cheap and good phone.
Iphone cannot be compared to Android in any way because they make their usage of phones user friendly and fun. For example you can change the launcher of your Android phone if you do not like how it looks. Buh that doesn't work on Iphone. LOL😝  Android all the way
So biased
The Best collab ever❤️
What I (as an Android user) get out of this video, is that when they are comparing Android to an iPhone, they need one Android with a good screen, another Android with a good battery, a third Android with a good camera, a fourth Android... etc.
Pretty lame
I have my personal Pixel 6 Pro and  an iPhone 12 provided by my employer for work.  I've had android and apple side by side like this for nealy 10 years. I grant that the iPhone 12 has great hardware, but I'd never buy one for myself.  I prefer the android experience.
On android you can put a android peeing on apple on boot  wonder iphones can  do that even on home screen 😉 and these guys says iphones have customization Biased video.....
I phone is overrated
android wins on camera definately
Honestly, Marques is being biased but his choice...
Very Anglo-American centric video.   Believe it or not but 90% of Europeans use Windows computer, the rarely use tablets, and if they do it’s some Android (mostly Samsung devices). So no, AirPlay, FaceTime etc are this that Europeans rarely use, especially that iPhones are far less popular in Europe than they are in UK and the US.
Samsung guy here:  > Apple doesn't do smart search of contacts using dialpad which  I could do in android years back. > Samsung has beautiful display (no creepy notch) > Secure folders, storage encryption option > S-pen to take note even on lock screen. >No samsung routines thing in IOS > Okay google is better in searching things on internet  > Can backup my stuff on my samsung to  home NAS easily with files without connecting my phone to pc.  > Value for money, more choices, more apps on play store, customization, weights. > Type C :  allow to charge with any type c cable, can plug type c devices and storage... > Dex, Wireless powershare, Link sharing, samsung pay, Pass,  wearable, dual account thing, Link to Windows, smart View can connect any TV.
Just take my word for it - kind of review 🤔
I like both really. Right now I’m still carrying a iPhone 7 daily and I’m doing some gaming on a galaxy a42 5g. I don’t have anything really high end but they work great.
I can't understand the result... Android is better in almost every aspect, they both use Android (MB even uses the same one for a year) and still the iPhone wins? Super weird and highly unreliable to me. Sorry.
Apple 🐑 🤡
Samsung Dex matters. These clowns are apple sheep lol
I have no apple device in my house that's mine and the reason I want one so bad is bc I can't video chat my bestie so that's why I want an iPhone
This was all one sided video compared to other videos ive watched of yours like he persuaded change of opinion 🤷🏾‍♂️
This was extremely biased..Mkbhd always only uses iphone, and Mr. is more about android but he just let dude get the points. Also lemme say using an android user all my life I have never taken a picture and then looked the next day and it wasn't there, wtf was marques talking about here. Google assistant, Maps, Customization, Drive are all better than apple stuff, and HOLY jesus its 2022 use USB-C. Lastly if I can get a god damn Samsung A53 5g, up to 16gb ram w/ virtual ram a 6.5" 120hz screen with an excellent array of cameras - or a tiny 4gLTE, single cam, non HD 4" screen, 2gb ram, iphone SE for the same price I AM BUYING THE SAMSUNG... Cmon man.
The iPhone is not a good choice if you want to buy because you have no control. Example: I bought an iPhone app and you couldn't have control over it. Instead on android I could go into the same app in system data or compress the file to save it as a backup. You have no control on the app and no control on the system, I still have other apps bought 10-14 years ago. They don't work anymore. Apple always changes terms and conditions and on all their devices with every system upgrade you can say goodbye to those apps you bought in the past, because they no longer work. There's also a huge system data issue that you have no way to delete no matter what you do, not even with iPhone reset. System data that gathers from all apps and other information not from Apple's system. Suck it Apple.
I still think android has the win 🙂
Apple recently simplified the maps app and I HATE it. Say you want to find the distance between two places to calculate how much fuel you will use or how long it will take to get there.. you cant. Try to find out which exit you need to take to get somewhere.. you cant. And for some reason, you STILL cant get directions in satellite overlay.
Things that ios can do that android cant.. connectivity.
the things like airdrop, imessage etc properly only matters in countries with more regular iphone users. its hardly a plus point. there are many iphone users here, but a lot people buy iphones here to resell for profits overseas! hahaha.
You guys are biased both of you guys are already apple fan boys
And this Video is sponsored by....  LOL
🥱
Samsung
I've only ever used Android phones since 2011, so I'd be hard pressed to make any switch to an iOS now unless someone gave me a brand new one to tool around with. What appeals to me for Android are the features and being able to customize settings more (as I understand, that is) an Apple. Having said, that I remember this time around when I bought a new phone, why I sopped buying Samsung...I absolutely hate their proprietary Apps and find it super frustrating to be beholden to many of the defaults, and have already spent tons of time adjusting default settings when I got this latest one to go to Google Play Apps instead of Pre-installed/Galaxy Store ones. It's just a shame that Motorola, which used to be my favourite phone, has dropped the ball on so many things since 2020, my Moto G7 Play was the best for my needs and I couldn't bring myself to get any of their newer "equivalents" due to being in a price point where there was so much competition for better phones for processing and reliability. I might revisit them when it comes time to update my Samsung, but they do have a decent trade-in program which might keep my custom. Unless, again, someone gifts me a brand new iPhone LOL And that's where they probably won't get my business in the end, the price. I know, I know, you can pick up a decent used iPhone at a fraction of the cost of new, but I usually just buy open box specials and I don't think even a "cheap" iPhone can compare to the cost savings I already get. And oh yeah, the USB-C is a big plus for Android where I can use the cable I had for my Moto with my Samsung, I can't believe Apple still hasn't made the switch yet..
So I've been scrolling for a bit now and read a lot of comments.  Funny enough, it seems to me that Andoroido somehow DOES IN FACT beat Apporu.
I wonder if the results would have been any different if it were strictly Samsung vs Apple
Just want you guys to know that im writing this comment on my iPhone 6s. This iPhone came out in 2016 and still shows a solid performance. I rarely see any lag and the phone still support’s the latest IOS(which is mind blowing to me). The only down-sight to this phone is the fact that the battery die’s really fast, and the phone itself heats up a lot when you are playing game’s.  But to me it actually shows how well the iPhone performs compared to a Android phone. For instance i’ve had a 2019 Samsung Galaxy A10 for a year and a half until i couldn’t bare with the constant lag, and a crappy camera, so i got tired of it, and knowing the feature’s of the iPhone, i knew what was going to be my best budget phone purchase. And it was an iPhone. And let me tell ya, this phone right here, took some of the best picture’s i’ve ever taken in my life… my friends were shocked to know that my 2016 iPhone 6s outperformed their latest Android gadgets in taking pictures. They couldn’t believe the fact that such a tiny and inexpensive phone could do so much. So to summarise the comparison, a phone that was made in 2016 outperformed some of the latest Android phone’s at similar pricing range(the Android costed me 120$ which is 40$ more than a phone that outperforms it). Im truly thankful for Apple for bringing the best tech to the market.  By the way, i want to mention 2 things about the Android phone’s, and that is the fact that there are so many variations of them, that you can get lost in the process of buying yourself a phone. And the second thing is that an Android phone may be better for those who like to have full control of their phone. But honestly i appreciate the simplicity behind Apple products, so its not really a big deal for me to have full control of my phone, and i never really cared either. ill stick the iPhone for now.
Man this is one biased as fuck comparison. Picking the lowest of android to go against apple in each category. Is unfair. Apple chooses to not go the route of licensing their product to other manufacturers like how PC GPUs are handled. If there is a android phone that is better they lose in that category as apple's goal is to be "the best."
IPhone is catching up and they give the rating to iPhone, yeah, that makes sense..  Way too bias...
Too bias an assessment for me.
Iphone can read text from photos. Offline. Can android do that without online Google lens??
Yeah, IPhone is a great mp3 player and it can make phone calls and send text messages too. Sometimes takes photos and videos. For other stuff you either need to pay or ask apple for permission and wait until you can buy an android.   I recently bought IPhone pro max super HD premium virgin...(so simply the latest and greatest of them) Couldn't stand more than a week before I got back to my 5 year old Xperia. I simply couldn't do anything. It seems to me that you either need to read out a whole book or buy a MacBook for things as simple as transferring a few songs from your PC to an iPhone...
TBH Arun never enjoyed this video and it's the first I've never enjoyed!! Looks like the comparisons were based on mkbhd's likings, no offense but it wasn't great
you are asking a apple fan.. this was point;less to me. There is a reason the Galaxy phones are top sellers worldwide
Please revome anoying 20 second adds 1st, these run on both os😭
YALL NOT ON EARTH ANYMORE ..IPHONE IS SOME GOOD ASS HARDWARE RUINED BY A CLOSED SOURCE MARKET ...WHAT WOULD BE IDEAL IS AN OPEN IPHONE THAT DOES NEED TO BE JAILBROKEN AND CAN ANY OS ON IT ...THESE ARE MICRO PC ..STOP CALLING THEM PHONES ..
Guys guys guys what are u trying? it's completely illogical rating, it's may be your opinion but think again MK has given some awards to some phone models from last couple of years and why Iphone wasn't in the list if you r claiming that iphone is the best?
I still prefer android particularly Samsung, iPhone has yet to come out with something to make me switch but who knows maybe one day
No surprise for me. Recently i have seen some of the reviews of @MKBHD, he got a soft corner for apple. Not a genuine review
Its very clear from the video, @MKBHD has got a bias towards apple. I have also seen him do this in some of the podcasts. He has got some hate towards android. I use to watch his videos and felt the same. @mrwhosetheboss you are the only one tech youtuber who is unbiased towards any of the tech giants or os. Very few youtubers are out there who is geniune in their reviews. Unsubscribing @MKBHD
iPhone = Prison Android = Freedom
Looks like I phone promotion
Apple is the reason for people to fight over which one is better. Without Apple or ios people wouldn't  care what phone they had and everyone would be happy. Because so many people wanted to make Apple better because it was from the USA it would be weird for someone walking around with a vivo or a Huawei phone. Without Apple, people would say, "I want a P.H.O.N.E". They wouldn't say that android is crap and they want an iPhone. See my point? Like if you agree.
Nah.. this too much the gap can't be this far... You guys just SUCK at your evaluation.
Y'all should have just said the video was sponsored by Apple cos there was absolutely nothing fair about this comparison
I respect your various points of view, however, there was a lot of bias especially on Aarons part in defending Android's strenghts. 😑
The comments regarding RAM are a spot on… top spec Android phones have more RAM but iOS software tends to me efficiently use the RAM  So it’s a catch 22
good morning
I would choose Android anyday
I have been an android user for like over 10 years and switched to Iphone, Dang what a phone, the only thing I notice is the battery life is less than my android but the speed and camera’s are so much better. I think I’l stay with Iphone for now but good video
I still love samsung android!
Fuck it iphone iphone iphone iphone iphone iphone iphone
Matter of fact the guy is iPhone lover lol 😒
This video is missing "Sponsored by Apple" flyer
It is apple vs all the other phones lol
Bro my opinion apple lack a lot of shit fps reader cant set downloaded songs as ringtone it 16 need a game mode if there is a way to pass the years problem along they could be number easily
When apple fan boy talk hahah
Never had an I phone  so can't speak 2 it I would like to get one and see what all the fuss is about,but on the other hand their are so many Android phones out their with iOS it's just apple as far as I'm aware.
BLVCK vs WHITE 😂
Desktop mode on android is a clear winner for me. It helps me to be more productive than my ipad or iphone. with just a single usbc cable i can connect to the displays at work or home...can edit my websites with no laptop. I was even surprised to find that my Oneplus 8T phone can output wqhd and 4k resolutions all day to external displays which modern day laptops need extra high end integrated or discreet graphics and cooling systems. On the other hand...My ipad feels sluggish when connected to external mouse and keyboard...limited to just mirroring ipad display with 1920 by 1080 resolution... ...Black bars on the sides when connected to external display...was never a great experience. I have to try the newer ipad pros to find out if this has changed.   But here is my concern with android. OEMs need to support the device software for atleast 5 years. My ipad air 2 and iphones are still recieving software updates where as my Samsungs, pixels and nokia phones bought after 2018 are now out of support and lying in my collection which is not good for the environment especially when you are wasting capable hardware and buying new devices for the latest software. Probaly this is one of the reason why I see many iphones  in the USA compared to android devices.
I don't like one thing, using Air Drop, iMessage and Face Time as essential apps people can't live without. You are forced to use them and you can use them with iPhone users only. Makes no sense to use it as argument. Question was about softver and apps you can get and are useful, not defaults or "must have". So, this is why I know MKBHD was way tooooo subjective.
Value for money: Android 10, apple 0 If you're not bothered about paying twice what a device is worth, and like to be locked into a company's prison cell while you're paying for it, it's Apple all the way.
Mkhbwtf inclined more towards apple!
I think the all Isheep idiot now are happy finally the widgets are coming their phone!!! Super good news for the sheep.... it released in 2009 for the android. muhahahha... greets for the fake mr W hoI sth ebO sse.s..
My question is simple. if he preferrs apple so much. why does MKBHD always select an android phone as the best every year ending when he anounces the best phones of the year
I’m Android
Mkhbd likes Iphone & MWB even made video of why he chose apple
God this was hard to watch, soooo subjective. It comes across as so pretentious listening to apple fans describe why they like an apple. There were ao many ways to approach this objectively but every thing that marques had a preference for was marked as being "better". The marketing folks at Apple are probs giving themselves a pat on the back since people are just guzzling everything they've put time into advertising. Most of the categories in favor of iPhone were just different, not better, just different than android. It was basically a pick your favorite UI video and then try bs a reason into liking it. Apple is so toxic and very anti competition, hence why they try to lock everyone into their environment with shit like FaceTime and colored texts.  There was little mention of interoperability of phones within their respective environments.   No mention of compatability with other devices/products.  No technical mention of structural design. A rounded edge makes the phone stronger and more resilient to the environment and falls or hits.  No mention of the auto software resource management on Android that can vastly extend battery life.  No mention of cyber security or file management.  It's annoying how software for Apple was highlighted for being recognizable because its good, when all they do is keep the name and gui the same. Both android and apple change everything under the hood for their main apps. Apple just names them the same thing and keeps the gui looking the same. Icloud and airdrop aren't special, just marketed well.  Support for apple is dogshit, they go out of their way to make sure you can't repair your phone and that you have fork over cash to fix even the most basic of problems, then after all that they say you had water damage some how.
Android is soo much better than iOS as it has so many varieties and if you consider all the Androids then Android wins soo good apple is just a stealing money company
Humorous. U guys so biased.👎
If you need dual screen to use two apps in same time. That function is amazing. A delivering app for packages and a chat or receive email app split to two. Or GPS and Bolt app on the same time
Why didn't you talk about... Innovation? Repairability? Type C port? Headphone jack? IR blaster? Modding? Floating windows? Customisation? Rooting?  Completely biased imo
Price is everything
I will take an Android any day, iphone just dont tickle my fancy.
Bias all the way, nobody will truly settle the debate but we can all agree if you don't have an apple phone literally everybody will just assume it's an android and think less of it
This video is sponsored by Apple.  Man I get apple is better in basic things but a 2.5 vs a 7.5 ?? Seriously!  Why don't you guys reveal the sponsored money from apple, then you guys didn't need to make this video.
Having used both android and apple pver many years, I must say I was surprised at the scoring on this. I had a 13 pro max and now use an S22 Ultra, and I don't miss IOS one little bit. I am on holiday at the moment and my partner has an iphone 13, she has had loads of issues, some to do with her network, but my s22 ultra is the phone we use for photos, streaming, basically everything. the only thing that works better on her iphone is the TUI app!! Iphone do what they can do (which is limited) very well, but as soon as you try and leave the track apple has laid for you to follow, you find you can't. The performance is great on an iphone, but there are so many little things that annoy me I don't think i could go back. Like you can't on an iphone without scrolling to the top... I can also use whatever computer I want now, whatever headphones, whatever smart watch. If you buy into the IOS ecosystem then to gain the full benefits you have to go full Apple, which is fine if you like that walled garden, but if you want to have some variety, then not so much. I am disappointed in the bias in this video, I don't think the scores are accurate at all for real world use cases.
MKBHD agent apple
USB-C was not mentioned..? Huge factor IMO. That aside I went from IOS to Android and will never go back. Typically it's hard to go from IOS to Android but once your there IOS just seems like a world away. Horses for courses that's for sure. I just wonder if Apple will be able to keep up with the Android evolution and the number of competitors?
I believe this is bias and I have never used any other phone than the apple branded phones. but I was just trying to give an honest opinion and did not intend to change others opinions on brands. hopefully this was helpful. (edit) -the only thing I got fed up with was he claimed the opinions in the video are facts and not just opinions.
Two tech unboxing legends in single video😎
This review is super bias mkbhd is a super apple fanboy and they dont talk about any of the android strong suits.
They have good chemistry
He's a hardcore iPhone lover that's it... U better ask an unbiased person in this matter !  I may buy iPhone sometime in future only for playing game, but at the same time I'll keep using Android as my main phone for everything else
this is  a biased review. As android phones are more popular to the international market. the iPhone is more popular in the US and UK
I've always thought "why do people like android over iphone?"   Well, just face the facts.iphone will ALWAYS be easier to use, and I like that. Not having to find the app by going through tabs.  I would rather press down on the dots and swipe to where I need to be.  iPhone also has facetime and better cameras  Im happy with my 12, but buy what you want ig.
i’d love to listen to them in a podcast
Samsuing and Oue UI does alot more than IOS. how the hell did IOS get the point for Multitasking??????
Promotion
NOTE: Please take this with a grain of salt - this is not an attack on this channel or the creator ... I really like the channel and creator.  I don't usually go to comments, but after watching this video I had to go look at comments to see if I was the only one who felt crazy watching this. Multiple categories went like this: "Yes, Android is better and sharper but brighter and crisper... but I like Apple better 'overall' ... so point for Apple." Wha?? Anyway, MANY comments below convinced me I am not crazy - many others saw this video the same way, too.  PS I recently switched from Android to iPhone 13 Pro ... and I have had nothing but problems with it. I totally regret putting myself into a year and a half more of payments to Apple, when I think a Samsung would have been so much better for my needs, but I watched a lot of videos before my purchase, and I believed the glowing reviews (including ones on this channel) about how 'amazing' the new iPhones are.  Honestly, months in, I am still so surprised how wonky Apple's OS is. Something as simple as tapping a button on-screen is so unresponsive I can hardly believe it, especially in the camera app. I often have to hard-press multiple times to make it do something. Indoor photos look like I took them on a Nokia flip-phone circa 2008. Etc etc etc.   So to hear no substantive criticism of Apple seems weird, especially since the point was made in the video that Apple intentionally "holds back and waits" to let Android develop things first, so that Apple can swoop in later and do it "perfectly." Ummm, no, not from my experience. Not by a long shot.  So that's why this review struck me as false: I am speaking from experience with my new iPhone here, not out of any dedicated fandom of Android.
This was great. Watch both channels n I like both perspectives. I just traded my S21U for the S22U. I don't think I'll ever leave android.
Well, this is his personal opinion. I don't share the same having used the two devices. iPhone is playing catch-up.
Mkbhd was baised.. And mrwhosetheboss was just accepting or agreeing to what Mkbhd was saying even when he I thought otherwise.. Why would a vibrator even make you use an old phone😂😂😂 it's kinda ridiculous
Why doesn't Siri answer questions out loud?  Why does it always fail and cop out with, "I found this," and a link to a website?  Is Siri just stupid?
Android definitely
Not gonna lie, this does seem very much fixed in iPhone's favor.  Face Time and iMessage have zero draw for me.  I prefer an app that is cross platform so that I can text and video chat with anyone.
"You get a hammer, everything looks like a nail."  Love it.
These guys suck [ i phone ]  I hate biased type of peoples If they love i phone just love but give honest answers   They used [ iPhone] for their entire time and life  They didn't used [ Android ] for days or hours
I'd like to say you have hundreds of android phones coming on the market and you guys review them as they come in. There are only a few iPhone models which you review also of course but my point is you have an android in your hand 95% of the time so you're more likely to notice faults on android!!
This seems like one man's opinion, you asked him all the questions and he sounds like an iPhone salesman. I use both and there are pros and cons for both but for most folks being able to use most apps and other features makes android much more flexible. If I phones were as good as the fella says most of the planet would be using them would they not? Also what phone company would get away with using an old design that feels like a box. A nice curvy phone can't be beaten imo.
This is a complete off review!!!  There is no way and I repeat no way an iPhone would beat an Android phone. As I believe most tech geeks knows the benefits of customization and use of an Android Phone which an iPhone can NEVER BEAT.... Just take it or leave it... Because I have used both and I know the striking differences..  These Guys are so freaking iPhone Users, who don't even know the advanced functions of an Android Device.
I'm really torn here. iOS just works more seamlessly and obviously it is useful to have your phone integrated with iPad and iOS is also what my family uses but I love the freedom you get with android. If only I had an excuse to have both iOS and Android
Definitely subjective towards Iphone. The masses you speak of that care about Airdrop, Facetime and Imessage are Iphone users. That in itself leans that topic in one direction. Andriod users don't care about those and don't feel like we are missing anything. Iphone users want to make us want to fell like we are missing something ..we dont care...  Additionally whenever I'm outside at events with Iphone users their phones never work because they always overheat.
❤
Iphone is better. Like come on its just the quality. Samsung has good battery life though :)
The major difference between iPhone and Android are responsiveness and durability. You will notice it when using it for a long period of time, note that you know the performance of phone dropped as time goes on but on iPhone is rare.
lmao i dont this mkbhd is right tho for this, feels like android is better in terms of anything. but for battery yes ofc gotta give it to apple.   been using iphone my whole life and changed to s21 ultra and im an android user since that
The black guy is over emphasizing iPhone unnecessarily
iPhone is a superior product for superior people who want to make a difference in the world. If you see a CEO on his or her phone, chances are they have an iPhone. If you see a couple of young start up company execs, chances are they have an iPhone. iPhone represents success, it represents superiority, it represents brand recognition and overall has a solid reputation. Android on the other hand is for those who are not driven, those who want to sit in the back row and not be heard so to speak. Android represents second place, the bare minimum, not relevant and the list goes on. If you want to win go with iPhone.
Great review. I totally Agree with the results. Android does provide choice.  So in a world where one phone proves to be the more stable and minimalistic and just gets it done and can replace all your devices with one device kind of phone with an ecosystem that keeps you locked in at a steep price, there will always be room for freedom of choice at a cost that suits you.  That's pretty much Apple versus Android. Quality over Quantity.  I'm on the new OS (IOS16 beta, not out yet as of the time of this comment). Man when this thing drops chances are lots of Android users ditch their phones. It's the dawn of a new age. About time. Tommy. A +++ review.
I use my phone as a tool and the best tool I found is the s21 Ultra, I use this phone as an internet modem by siphoning unlimited internet from my mobile plan to my computers at my apartment. Also I use it as a torrent downloader because it uses way lower power than my computer and I download them directly from my 5G plan. Plus free Spotify and free YouTube premium with Vanced are icing on the cake. I've tried doing this on iPhones but I always find roadblocks and the need to jailbreak the phone but not on Android.
My android can run call of duty mobile smoothly so I'm fine
Switched From IPhone 12 pro max to S22 ultra, I'm in love with Samsung!  From photos 📸  Zooming, Sharpness  To downloading Stuff, Its so much easier on Samsung and there are so much apps you can have on Samsung but not iPhone.  With USB C charging cable wow, I can charge it anywhere Quick and never had problem with the battery 🔋 life.
Launchers like nova with own gestures and icons that can be placed on bottom are just so convenient for me that it makes me miss android really bad. Also the multitasking aspect is really a big thing for me, as the PiP can be moody
I love MKBHD but he's too bias here. Even when he states a major point for android, he still finds a way to slide something little about the iPhone into the conversation and gives edge to the iphone. I don't know but this screams so loud something that feels like fanboyism to me.
I actually used both and I'm happy with it...but choice of my life 💥💥💥
Kinda biased tbh
I like you both but this is a terrible comparison. How can you compare an Iphone (a phone) to Android (an OS). You were basically comparing and Flagship Iphone to and average of multiple different manufacturers that use Android. If you were to compare two most mainstream flagships (IP13 pro vs s22 note) or mainstream base line (IP13 vs s22) it'd be a different story.
batery ? most android phones charge over 30 wats , some of them even more , and battery capacity over 5000mah
come on man is's obvious you both use iphones and the scoring you gave is totallly off
I am sorry, if apple is so good that you gave it a 7.5 and android ended up with a comical 2.5, may I ask  why  you gave the smartphone of the year award to an android phone for the last 2 years ?
I beg to disagree on the battery. Iphone sucks at it in the long run unlike android. In terms of being environment friendly, that should have been omitted since we all know the reason behind not including the charging brick is to add more sales. Why do I sense some bias in this video.
Great format, love this!
i hope you could do more videos with marques. it is such an intellectual conversation with him, as always.
Comparing a phone to operating system? Lol
In terms of exclusive features LIDAR for iPhone is an incredible tool for 3d scanning on a budget and adds an impressive punch to the focus system.
Mkbhd just like iphone verry much
i just upgraded from the Google pixel 2xl yesterday to a TMobile pixel 6....not loving not being able to unlock my bootloader on a pixel phone but usb debugging isnt working on my pixel 2xl even after fr so its stuck on od fm. wanted pixel 6pro or 6 unlocked but couldn't buy full price and had a tmo upgrade 6 was $0 down.
On the topic of eco-friendly, there is a reason recycle is the last R, reduce/reuse is far more important than recycling which is a last resort, but Apple pushes into the recycle portion and what's worse is you of course can't side load apps, there might be a few workarounds to get some apps to work but once a phone is so old and loses access to the app store it's effectively dead unless you're willing to take the extra steps to jailbreak it.  In terms of being more eco-friendly, all android devices are better simply because I can grab any 10-year-old phone right now and access the play store or side load any app that supports old versions of android, even if it's well past being useful as an actual smart device you can still turn it into something mildly useful like an alarm/clock, weather dashboard, IP camera, baby monitor, dedicated media player, etc... If you can use an old device in place of buying a new shinny thing to do it, then that is the best thing you could possibly do with it and again, yes you can do those things on iphones but only for as long as Apple so generously allows.
This video is sponsored by Apple.
All I just want is the power to customise my phone 😌
Now I know you 2 are paid off, I don't have to waste time watching your b.s. videos.
These Apple FAN BOYS 🤣😂 Talking about how great thier Iphone was then bash android..🤣..
I think it's pretty obvious what is going on here.....
Fair points
Oga this is bias
I could never be IOS. Android is the real deal. Everything is Android. There is very little that is IOS besides Sonos and Apple TV. What else is IOS?
So the iphone looses in every category except video shooting. If you find even one android phone that's better than the iphone then android wins. I am hearing alot of samsung is better but iphone wins . how does that make sense. Am puzzled.
wat do u expect from someone living in USA  hope you know why USA f££kt Huawei  😂😂😂
iv never been an apple fan and always tolde people that asked me that iphone was a bit more user friendly but it was not as good as the android phones... personally i believe that changed with apple 13 pro max.. its just an as kicker of a phone.. sadly its around 2000 us dollars where i live and im not buying a phone that costs the same as a high end gaming pc. ufffff. still wins.. the galaxy s22 ultra made me loose all interest in galaxy s 22 series and am not looking for a new brand to make my daily i switch phones every 2 yrs and my s20 is getting there..
Seems everyone always favor iPhone. I have both I use both, but I use my android more than my iphone
A lot of people are talking about how android is better because of customization, but we’re starting to see more freedom in regards to software in iPhones.   iOS 16 is making a big step towards the customization of the Lock Screen, which will probably spearhead future freedom in customization.
Iphone is a super boring phone.. Samsung is Fun all the way...
Why do I feel disappointed by Marques 😪 ?
The irony of these scores and Apple winning is the only comments I can see are people who switched from iPhone to Android and never went back, or people who tried apple and went back to Android. Lol.
"I took an 8hr flight which was -8hrs so I essential had a 24hr day, and the iPhone still had 20% left" -  yeah but you spent 8hrs of the day on a flight, with your iPhone on Airplane mode, not being used at all. So it wasnt a measure based on a 24hrs of usage really hahah.
Wow lol! A lot of people are getting bent out of shape over this comparison. Look, if you like Android cool, if you like iPhone that's also cool. I'm not sure why it's so personal for some of you all.
Apple is good at building concepts on people so u keep believing their products like "religion".  It is a good product tho but Android has more freedom and gr8er features.  I was expecting a comparison between the most advanced Apple iphone 13Promax and Samsung s22 ultra with a snapdragon processor.  The video seems biased , the gentleman Marques is  from USA 🇺🇸  the producers of the apple iPhone🤪...good video tho😄😄🤟
Wow video
Bro mkbhd is so good at explaining things lmao
But if your screen breaks, which of the two repairs will be cheaper and faster? If my charger is stolen, which brand of the two will be easier and cheaper to buy another one?  To me these things are more important than how many milliseconds faster one is than the other.
that other guy is biased
Ive been Samsung user from the release of S2 up to S10+ (all the models) and in between when iPhone 5S was released, I swapped for less than 6 months and went back to Samsung again. Reason why I changed was because iPhone was the first to release the fingerprint feature but that was it, rest didn’t satisfy back then. Last year I decided to try iPhone 12 Pro Max. Beginning was terrible, wanted to select and delete some contacts that were stored in iPhone 5S iCloud (cause I used the same iCloud) and couldn’t find any selection option, I had to delete them all one by one and more similar hard times I had with iPhone, then eventually I kinda find my peace with the simplicity, little had to worry about all the customization and features that Android offers, I kinda find IOS more reliable, more secure and the physical build even more convenient (flat screen don’t have to worry for the curved edges of android that makes you change the screen protector every month cause in the edges always the adhesive gets loosened and protector peel’s off). I still miss some options that Android offers, but again I kinda find solution in IOS and definitely I’m thinking 💭 of continuing with iPhone, cause of the smooth experience, battery life, responsiveness and simplicity. Last year I got the 13 Pro Max and the battery life is even better then 12 Pro Max …
You can still FaceTime on samsung the iPhone user just have to send a link to you
Even big tech ppl might miss stuff. Like airdrop has had a Andriod counterpart for the longest time, but they failed to look at that
MKBHD is such a apple fanboy isn't almost unfair. Iphones are way too expensive for what they offer and the build quality is poor
Subtle biases . Wow
I've been on Iphone since the 3G and I don't even have a desire to check out an Android phone, none at all.
As a iPhone user, you guys really shouldn’t actually take the opinion of two people incredibly seriously
Side loading apps is the biggest deal breaker for me, 2nd is the god awful notch 🤮 lol. If iPhone let you install 3rd party apps I would have at least tried an iPhone by now.
Android all the way, no point in buying a car with the hood welded shut. You are able to do sooo much more. Yet you cant even change a battery in a apple device
This conversation would have been better with Flossy and Tech Spurt. These two are junk.
sponsored by iphone 😂
Why don't talk about apps, music, videos and all those things Also FaceTime is not using all countries
I'm trying to convince myself to get this iphone 13pro max..  But,  I don't know..  It's a very boring asthetic phone.  I don't feel excited about it at all.
I just now realized that these are two different people, and I'm subscribed to both of them!!  Any time I ever needed to get a phone review, my default guy to get info from was the "well spoken guy of color".  I still can't believe I never realized one is British and the other American.
both are good, but there is something that i don’t like about samsung. I don’t really know what it is, seems like its not my thing. I bought it last year, used it for few months and I returned it and back to iphone. but yes, samsung is better when it comes to freedom, 3rd party stuffs, customization and many more. Still prefer Iphone ecosystem.
u 2 are just hunting for views and building a bigger wall of hate between the users with videos like this.shame
This was the video that we never needed. It was a waste of time and useless imo. It's of course their opinions just like what I'm saying is my opinion, in which i am entitled to as well. Just saying.
The fact they dont even know that android has nearby share means they are total idiots
Dat mam weh a rep android  him nuh kno one thing bout android. Smh
Apple sponsored?
The title of this video should be "why we like iPhone", Rather Android verses iphone, you can compare Android with IOS but not iphone. Android is a operating system iphone is not, I usually watch all of your videos and i like iphone but this title is way off the topic. Pure Dissatisfaction.
The black guy is an apple fanboy, 10000gb on android feels like 1gb on iphone. Dont be an I diot
Are you both going to divide money earned from this video ?
That's a lol comparison
Are we comparing operating systems or physical devices here? Did you mean Samsung vs apple? Or Android vs iOS? There's so many different kinds of android phones out there each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Apple's limited list of devices makes a phone choice simple which is technically a good thing. But all the flagships fail because all the new stuff is made of glass.
Iphone 13 pro max sierra blue is insanely beautiful... but i just cant leave Android behind :( If only Samsung had similarly beautiful phone right now. I was so torn between S22 plus vs Iphone.  But after much thought, i realized that i only wanted Iphone 13 pro max for its looks. Buying it sorely for its looks isn't gonna be worth that price tag.  I wanted S22 plus for so much more so i got it instead. The green one is growing on me lol (still wish S22plus had a easier accessible blue color tho wew).
Who agreed' this video is Fu*king disgusting paid video 🤟
The sheer amount of android copium in this comment section 😭 iPhone definitely doesnt destroy android as bad as they say in this video but it still wins fs
Apple pays mkbhd a lot of money to give them all the praise even tho he clearly knows androids nowadays are better in many ways compared to iPhone
going to compare android vs ios with a apple fan ...
iphone batery: 0.000000000%
Should be iOS vs Android...Too many phones running Android to compare to just one brand. OS vs OS and Phone vs Phone....
With android you can pick a brand but with IOS you can't. Android have much more ways of connectivities to other devices than IOS. Android can be personalized ( change the looking to be yours ) more than IOS. IOS always tell you what to do and how to do it. In Android you the one on command. to be fare, both of you are Apple fans.
Why not the s22?  Errm, because this phone works fine and is only a year old.  Talk about the environment then asks that lol
What a load of rubbish iphone is crap, compared with Samsung phones, you Apple guys live in a dream world
How much did apple pay you to make this shitshow?
This guy doesn't use android.
That was dope
I don't think how probably the compatibility was not mentioned, like for instance the iPhone 13 or any iPhone as matter of fact decodes their videos and photos in .mov and .heic so like when you share a video or a photo from the iPhone its not compatible unless you convert it, where as in androids it comes with MP4 and Jpeg and other stuffs which when shared is seamlessly compatible and theres no hassle to convert the files
Your so baised you can only support iphone because your just iphone 🐑🐑🐑
I never had a good luck with iPhone because the animation is slow. Whereas Samsung S22 Ultra has very fast animation and it feels snappier.
Mrwhosetheboss this review, I think it is sponsored by apple, there are lot of places Android win that you skipped giving the point to android.  to me Android has a better battery than Iphone for its price. And Honestly samsung has a better battery thank Iphone for its size and Apple Uses a double Mah for its battery in Iphone pro maxes and decided to tell the public they use less so as to appear the winner. It is mere business strategy
I’ve used both but I prefer Apple because it just feels more natural to me  Android has a lot of great perks and I wish Apple would learn from it in some regards but I still prefer the general simplicity and ease of iOS
I think for blanket, it works for everyone,  iPhone is great. If you like to tweak and play with settings (especially photo modes) Android is for you Android user married to an Apple everything spouse
For the first time, I'm disappointed. This review does not look objective or fair at all. Why does Arun keep picking up the iPhone for every category? It kinda looks like Apple sponsored the video
the guy on the right is only complementing iphone... bc it more expensive.
Marcus the Apple fanboy
are you getting paid by apple ?
You mention eco conscious without considering repairability, what's good on 20% recycled materials against having to get a new iphone because Apple won't let the repair be possible/affordable? Remember that using recycle materials is as much a saving cost measure as a pr speech. I believe you did botch that one. Pretty good analysis though, it's all about what's your usage.
is that guy from fortnie
I feel like iPhone can't be the eco-friendly winner until they use usbc
I'm sure Apple paid you guys for this
Useless iPhone users
It's quite easy for Iphone to win stuff like these, because they make the OS for their own phones.  And i believe if it was easy to make an OS, and all these other Android phone companies made their own OS at the level of what Android is today, IPhone will be completely blown out of the water.
Biased
What’s the point of having the best performance when it can’t sustain it at all, my iPhone 13pro over heats within 10 minutes of mobile gaming Edit battery dies quickly in gaming too
This is a very american way of approxing many things. In Europe  blue bubble, green bubble isn't a thing so imessages are most of the time a side app that is in the way. People just don't use it here that much. Along with Airdrop same thing. They are just apps that lock you in the ecosystem of Ios. Also Apple is known for purposefully making their devices irreparable for third party stores and we cant forget about the scandal when they were accused of making their own phones to malfunction to force their users to upgrade. There is no customization and it is also very hostile to other tech products you want to use it with. Europe is making a new law so that every electronic device will have a usb-c charger and Apple is doing everything in their power to find loopholes. I was an Iphone user for many years and its just not worth it in my opinion. Adding an sd card was a real life changer for me i was able to load around 3000 songs on an sd card and have them on my phone. Apple music and spotify aren't really my thing. Same with photos no need to add cloud storage and no more photos that wont load without internet. You can always find an Android that will be exactly what you want and you wont have to sacrifice anything that you would sacrifice in an Iphone otherwise.  -An ex Apple fangirl
I my mom or grandma had to add a lovkscreen widget to any of these phones, they wouldn't know how to. Actually I think any grandma wouldn't know how to, unless they used the search feature, it's not as easy if you're not used to any other the ecosystems 🤷🏾‍♂️
I feel like this would have brought a very different outcome, if it was Samsung vs Iphone.  And also it's kinda annoying that nowone seems to remember that there is an Android form of Airdrop(Near by Share).
The Galaxy S22 Ultra is the better device, hands down!
As a user of both iphone and samsung i think when it comes to reliability, smoothness of screen, repairing and camera samsung is better one and the other side gaming, stability and charge lasting iphone is a better one. Actually these two are pretty close to each other. But the real thing why i will go with samsung is the freedom ( from type c charger to smart watches, and sharing things with lots of other phones, pc's, tv's), i really enjoy my iphone but i think anyone can tell that: this video was a good example of apple marketing.
IMO  apple doesn't have different companies they have to develop apps for  android has so many companies using there ecosystem it's hard for developers to make anything reliable for them  As someone that has used both ecosystems I find android more user friendly
Comparing Apple to Android is more like comparing Apples Vs Every other fruit in the world.
S23 Ultra Fast series.
Name this iPhone ad instead of compare... Usb c is a easy win.. just for few apple products  I must have bought many cables and for many android product ls just one cable is enough.. screens :D def with Samsung... Biased review...
This doesn't agree with my confirmation bias
Putting the apple echo system aside, for everything an iphone does well, there's an android phone that does it better.
Unpopular Opinion I actually like the iPhone Notch
Android give more freedom and control to the customer. Apple lock everything and treat their customers like walking ATMs.
To summarise in simple way: Android is getting better and better. IOS is getting worse with time. Using Android's features few years later and call it new feature. Every iPhone user may need Android but not every Android users need iPhone.
The iPhone is 100% def not the smoothest 120hz screen.
Multitasking screen on my note 10. Samsung note on one side anki on the other...
Just to clarify, I prefer iPhone. In general, iPhones are usually consistent. If i have to use an Android phone, I would take the Pixel series. IMO, only Pixel comes close to iPhone experience. All other manufacturers like samsung, MI and shit load of others are just garbage. If you like samsung's one UI, god help you! That is the most useless android UI out there. Don't get me wrong, I fucking love pixel phones. But other Android phones, I cannot stand. I need the stock experience to enjoy Android. Even moto makes better phones than samsung shit phones. Only consistent android experience you get is from pixel phones as the OS is plain and simple with really useful features. Samsung has all dog shit features which take up ram and eat up resoruces in the background. Those of you defending Samsung, you really are mad at others because you might be frustrated with your own phones. BTW, I CURRENTLY USE A SAMSUNG A52S 5G. DOG SHIT PHONE! I came from an iPhone XR. I cannot wait for pixel 6a to release. Only phones i would love to use are iPhones and Pixels. Rest all can go F themselves!
I switched from a Samsung a10e to a iPhone 13 128gb red, I like the iPhone better
This is exactly like the batman vs Superman 🦸‍♂️ movie,so unnecessary 🙄 iPhone is batman,no super powers at all just lots of money,hence its always overpriced...Android, man come on,let me say Android running on a Samsung phone is phenomenal, get it on a galaxy NOTE and you are a God of tech period. Iphone is a girly device hence their camera is pretty good, its for girls to take pics and thats it coz that's all it does. Real man use Android.
Somehow I feel like this wasn't a good comparison unlike your other comparisons
I think many of the areas one phone or the other wins are very subjective. You actually pointed that out at the end where you brought up that Marques gave the point for the camera to iPhone however you feel Android wins. I know many people that iPhone and iOS are the clear winners, yet for me Android multitasking is an absolute must so iOS doesn't work. While this will always be a hot topic the fact remains that without both neither one has a reason to get better.
I’ve used android for year’s & Mainly Samsung, and i use to diss the iPhone and never even used one. Started making more money & i was tired of how my android would run slow after a year or less, and update’s took, well don’t let me get started. Then someone told me to try a iPhone!, so i did and at first i was gonna take it back till i realized most of my family had one, and after that i realized how much u can do & how easy they made it to do, and the security…I Got Stuck🥃
when you hold your phone without a case for the first time in years: Woah. it feels so..... new!
C'mon, no mention of Always-On-Display, easy storage expandability of many Android phones! Gimme a break.
it's sad to see how bias is this video towards iPhone 😅
I think this video would be the most disliked video ever 😹
Such a biased comparison. 👎
basically every comment under this video has a reply by a bot :(
Android vs Iphone. You can beat every feature of iphone by using different brands of flagship phones. that summarizes the topic 😁
Android fans 👍🏻
Tbh this just feels like a promotion for iPhone cause this video is incredibly biased
I just thought Apple sponsored this whole video LOL.
Apple paid promotion😂
Carbon neutral is a scam. I refuse recycled crap, I want new stuff.
I play and watch youtube în multitasking 90% of the time .
If you ask me...  iPhone is the phone for people who have money but are dumb. It's simple. And Android is for people who want to decide how they want their phone to be. It's not simple unlike apple.
the comparison doesn't make sense to me...apple is one company and there are hundreds of companies producing android phones.....compare ios and android not the hardware. Different android phone manufacturing companies have different strengths and comparing their average phone with an Iphone doesn't really make sense to me!
This is the worst review in my opinion by both you guys ever. Especially MKBHD's perspectives. I came to rewatch and I am still like what 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣...
They both don't know about android smartphones lol... They are faking the whole world 😂😂😂.. partnership with apple ...😹😹
As an android user that works with 3d modeling and archviz, the ONLY feature i miss on Android now is the LiDAR sensor, it may come to Android phones later, and i can wait. As they said, it comes to personal choice and necessity
What is the use of this av upload....
Apple is worse in the environmental aspect, for sure. The options for repairing an iPhone are way slimmer than any android phone
I think MKBHD is clearly biased to Iphone - he literally admitted multiple times that android was superior, but he preferred the iphone. Is this video about which has better features by spec or just a preference? Seems like he could've just skipped the whole thing and said "yeah I like iphones I don't care what anyone says" (also every iPhone user ever)
I feel like it's a little based .
The EU literally had to force Apple to switch to USB-C and you're calling them eco-conscious? :///
This review is wack, android is way more better
They are so biased, I thought this was going to be different 😶
obviously biased , but i can say its all about one's opinions
sir  I am your biggest fan. I started to watch your video 2 years ago. please give me a iPhone.😅 sir please give me a iPhone 😢
This video must have been sponsored by Apple. One Disappointing thing is : As MKBhD said Iphone has World Class Batteries. Also he says my ROG phone with 60hz display can easily give better backup than iphone. And give a point for Apple. wTF dude.  You guys didn't talk about the bad side of Apple's ios 14/15 or whatever software it is in. Bashing Android from start to end of the video 😂
It’s a bit unfair, it’s basically comparing an Apple product against the rest of the world. I am apple through and through but do think they are a bit behind, if Steve Jobs was still around they would continue to amaze us at every launch and push the boundaries further.
I am sorry but I don't see this as any comparison at all. Android is a mobile OS and iPhone is a mobile Device. It would make more sense to compare Android to iOS.
This video is a bunch of bullshit👎🏽
for software are we going to talk about one plus and their storage issues?
Iphone is just better bro, I can't say anything then that, I just love the Iphone better
is this collab with apple 😂😂😂😂
Dude great video and very nice topic
allways Android
iPhone is on another level for me
Solana phone all da way.
How much money did you guys make for this iphone commercial?
I really enjoyed the colab. I follow you both and you guys delivered as usual. Thank you and I'd like to see more of you together. To have both opinions are priceless from educated people in said field.
Yup phones pretty much reaching the plateau and Apple not only caught up but passing the Android vendors handedly has made this 'battle' very one sided.
Genshin impact😍
If Apple was so good they should stop buying parts from Samsung. They need Samsung to make parts for them and they have been for a long time. Samsung is one of Apple's major suppliers.
IPhone are made China by Slaves  T/F?
Waiting for Tesla to hit the market
Love the multi Window 🪟
It's rigged. Everytime Android wins a category, he says draw 😂
anytime I watch my pals' status I could download them without their consent, my favourite music with no charges, favourite apps with no purchase, favourite themes n ringtones, and easy transfer on files anytime anywhere. but now I'm restricted to some of these on my own device. you know what I mean. I had to go back to my root.
To be able to overclock and mod phones🤯
👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Give me a phone for my online class
when i first saw these guys give a point for iphone over samsung in terms of display  i knew its biased and they are apple fanboys
Excellent segment on comparison, I really enjoyed this. Well done!
Great video and all honestly I'm still sticking with galaxy and I preferably think galaxy camera is better then the iPhone especially when it comes to stability
iPhone is the clear winner 🥇
Love both these guys but if you ever watch MKBHD's iPhone reviews over the years you can see he's always soft on Apple when compared Android. Which is fine since we all have our own preferences. I'm just saying I'm not surprised here.
I'll take fast charging any day Love my Pixel 4a
Come on 😂 -USB C -If u are unlucky and broke your Iphone. good luck to find a 3rd party parts seller  -u don't have to pay for all apps -i like the fact that i can close all apps with one move - what about the fact that an android phone has a memory card slot and don't tell me that's not important too And the list is looooong
As a Samsung customer for over 15 years .. I decided I would never go back to Samsung! Endless problems .. Moisture detection problem in USB charger that appears for no reason! What's Samsung What the hell? An old telephone from 20 years ago is facing moisture Better than IP68 models.  I also have battery issues that drain quickly even after I have already replaced the new one, Also slowness and crashes after all the updates.   Samsung from now on if you're looking for me call me on my new iPhone XD  I have a Samsung S 10
the major iPhone drawback for me is its exclusivity and less freedom of use to alter and change its operating system
Samsung's better
Holy Sh*t, this is almost like sponsored video by apple. very very unbiased 😂
As someone who works in this field.  I can say without a biased opinion that Samsung is better than iPhone. In every way.  There is no phone on the market especially an outdated DVD player like the iPhone that will compete with s22 ultra.   And your boy Mark here is fake.  He gets money from Apple to give them such high reviews.   He's wors than the fake fitness influencers that try selling their workout plans to noobs on the net.
IOS even from a development standpoint is sht. IOS you are simply a user,  android you are the administrator.  I phone is for kids. Android is superior. I phone does have better mileage on its battery though....  Fair play if you prefer the fisher price UI of the ios.  Also some of what you have said about android demonstrates you in fact don't know how to get the most out of your android or perhaps even how to use it. It was kind of painful to watch.  So for that reason, I've unsubbed.
this is such a paid video by Apple, paying directly to those bloggers. so much bullshit disguised as "review". better go for Linus tech tips for more realistic approach without huge bias of those guys. ESPECIALLY MKBHD is recently got owned by Apple. shame
I Think The Fact That there are a Few ios Phones. Pivoted to leaning to iphone being compared vs every android phone. But i doubt tht iphone can beat every android phone by phone.  This is a Multiverse experience it depends which universe u r in.
ok everything is fine, but when it comes to quick and important shots like taking notes or things quicker, samsung software for photos is king, than stupid iphone which does NOT focus properly, and ANDROID PHONES HAVE MANUAL MODE.. how can you choose iphone for photography??? for video yes nothing beats iphone
Camera....... scrolling through Instagram, you can always tell who's using an iPhone cos the pictures are always grainy, I even have friends who are iPhone through and through say the camera on is s**t compared to android 🤷‍♂️
I laughed when he said a tie at the start because i know he is an Apple Fan. and Battery experience is good in the iPhone but when the new version is out your phone will die faster than ever like my iPhone 12 pro
Iphone is great until the new and expensive one arrives. And your old one is messed up with one simple update.
dudes.....one of the worst videos you could've made together, sorry
iPhone pays reviewers good too
Value is an absolute easy win for Android and it trumps anything the iPhone has. I don't want to spend a £1000 on any smartphone when I get a great phone for ⅕ of the price that does everything I or 99% of other people need. The iPhone SE is a terrible phone and can't compare to a great budget Android.  Also, iOS is way too restrictive and it doesn't play nice with 3rd party software.
this video was biased towards apple phone you need to get someone who isn't biased. this was purely to say go buy Iphone eww thats disgusting who would actually pay money for a piece of garbage like apple they took a bite out of Android will kick that apple where it belongs in the garbage can.
So basically, what you guys are saying is that one single company (iPhone) beat other mutiple companies (Samsung, VIVO, Xiaomi, OPPO e.t.c) if this video is not biased, i dont know what is.  Also, Arun seems to be agreeing to everything Marques is saying, Arun was only awarding points based on Marques's opinions and not his. He seems to be agreeing to everything said by him. Not what i expected of this video to be honest. Dissapointment is just the tip of the iceberg.
It's funny how no one is really talking about what a faster charge does to your battery. I used to use airport mode on my iPhone's years ago for a faster charge, but, what i found was, although I got a faster charge, I don't think some of the cells got a full charge. What I noticed at times was as the battery decreased to a lower percent, it would sometimes die out and I would have to wait a few minutes in order for it to power back up. Only then at times would I be able to power down the rest of the battery. I then discontinued the fast charge. Another thing that was a battery killer were the toggle switches I didn't use on my iPhone. Once I turn  a lot of those off, I found my battery lived longest. I don't know much about the newer iPhone now, but, I realized apple had increased toggles in networking, on the phones afterwards. Its been about two years and my battery has kept its life of 89 percent, after I turned a lot of the toggles off that I didn't need, especially in Siri. I also remove apps I rarely used from my screen and condensed them.
In my opinion, Apple takes the cake but I’m not gonna say either because both companies make very good tech! ❤
Can I have an iphone
Tbh if it wasn't for mkbhd, android would've got 10/10.
Android is like windows. Mac ain't better if windows comes on ARM. Apple doesn't allow for optimized specs(a large mAh battery to full experience of 90Hz) once you know how to choose a proper android phone to your requirements.
Boomer generation the words are a scam bot magnet, if you see any of them reply to this, they are fake so do not respond to them.
Watching On My Brandnew Galaxy S22 Ultra.
MKBHD always favours Apple no matter what.
Display draw ?? Common . That big huge nochhhhh
In at least one case an Android phone was better, but since it wasn't ALL Android phones, you gave it a draw, which is not fair. If something is better on one Android phone it obviously should win, because it has a benefit Apple doesn't even offer. It shouldn't count against Android that only one company makes iPhones.
These guys use Samsungs as daily phones, that's everything you need to know.
The title should have been "Promoting iPhone for Advanced users"
Samsung is best
PPHHHWWOOAARRRR.. I can see up his shorts!!
Idc about the phones, I'm hyped af for this collab, love these two 👑 👑
I'm supposed to believe the iphone 13 overall is better than the Ultra? Okay cool
they both seem so much in love with each other.. :D
arun being a typical iphone fan boy
comparing samsungs camera to apple ok id take the iphone too. But pixel? for snapchat and all that? brooooooo
You lost credibility with this video
I hear what you guys are saying with regards to the battery and i do share a simulair opinion. BUT at the same time, there is always the factor of battery decay. So with that in mind, would the iphone still be better though? With the fast charger, even if the battery runs out faster, overtime the fast charge will always help. Especially in a time where you have a usb connection almost everywhere, from trains to cafe's and etc. If it just takes 5 minutes to get a good amount of percentage, you can have a short train journey and come out with a enough extra percentage to survive longer.
iPhone is like Toyota and Chevy. Maybe not the leader in every category but it does everything well and it just works. No performance degradation like the Galaxy phones or privacy issues of Google. They support the phone for years. I know people just now getting rid of the 6 from 2014. That's 8 years. Android can't compete
They spoke more about Apple, they must have paid them off
We like what we like. Apples the original smartphone. It's also American so there's a little hometown pride as well. It does everything you want it to well without any issues. Doesn't go overboard with the features. This fight always seems to start with Android users. Use what you like iPhone users don't care lol
Incredible details laid out but you guys missed out on manual mode on iPhone where all think that Android phones are greater
Never get this vídeos. It must be paid by Apple. I go from huawei mate 20 pro (high end from 2018) to iPhone 13 pro max and i have worse photos (vídeo is better), battery is less When i play and the mate is more fast opening apps. I must do a vídeo.
Man????
Android is the winner to me. They're just much better. Iphone win for being famous.
U guys miss to add s pen support in s22 ultra ... which make it more value fr money
I still like android better
This is proof Apple has purchased eyes and brain of tech influencers. Sad 💯
Dongles anyone?
I use both. I only got the 13 Pro just for the silicon and the battery life. What pisses me off with my iPhone experience is how the App Store financially rapes you and all official accessories are so expensive. You are forced to pay monthly/yearly subscriptions to use good apps. On Google Play store the majority of apps are lifetime purchase once you have paid for them. iPhones are intended for people with plenty of disposable income. The one thing I like about my iPhone is how there are so many high quality accessories such as cases and screen protectors available. I even purchased a camera lens protector too.
Seems like he just favoured the I phone regardless. People do have favourites but didn't seem a true comparison just an opinion . Good video though
I love multitasking on my Note 10 plus. Maps at the bottom and Audible/youtube at the top
Huawei (Android) with Kirin 9000 should be compared with IPhone...
What about nearby share.... U know what hypocrisy has its limitations 🙂
For my opinion, I’ll go for iphone, here in the philippines we use IOS in mobile gaming (tournaments MPL)
I only love iphones because I look rich period.. my hearts is android <3
You're speaking with someone who lives, breathes, eats an iphone. Android's no joke.
Iphone UI is for grannies.
I'm sorry, but this video was just bad. So many things wrong with this comparison and it seemed like you guys were just excited to see each other, the entire time.
guys focus lang ako sa goal <3
YouTube adblocking, emulation and torrenting
I use both ios and android and i'd chose android every single fuckin time
I Am The Boss :)
Tech reviewers with each more than 10M subscribers doesn't know Android have nearby share 🤷‍♂️
U guys did not give customization medal  to android ? Android have more options that's why everyone stays in the android world . Second : when apple wins it wins , when android wins it doesn't because apple will be better .   Really i don't know if this is a good video any more ... I don't like when I'm getting lied in the face !
Yeah no iphones camera IS NOT quick to shoot.  I've lost so many beautiful moments that my kid has done that I've ended up hating this piece of crap
Sorry but this review is skewed.
Så between Google A vs Siri who got the point there?
The only thing I use android bcs of the money😂.
So i did my own ratings for android and ios while they were doing it and for me,android wins (6.5:3.5)
Most useful discussion ever 😀
They should have done apple vs one android phone company like Samsung  not apple vs the best features of every android phone made because they are comparing apple to an Android phone that doesn't exist
This rating is clearly on your personal preferences, nowhere near to the reality.   Totally biased toward iPhone -  Questions were like - "Do you think that iPhone's display has anything special about that or do you think a pretty average android mobile screen with a thicker border and kind a weird looking notch?" 😅
It was more of like 'Samsung Vs Apple". I'm mentioning this because most of the people in the world aren't even using Apple products, they are basically made for rich people living in developed countries. The rest of the entire population is using android, which offers the general and basic features which are genuinely helpful to people. What about OnePlus, Vivo, Oppo, and Realme..!
I think that the "BRAND" factor Apple plays a big role in getting the attention and preferences. iPhones are being sold for giving better aesthetics in every feature that Andriod had 10 years ago. If you did this exact same video 2/3 years before the results would be very different.
Im Sorry but the Good Lock customization aspect with Samsung is waaaayyyyyy ahead of what apple will EVER do.
So did MKBHD get the 500 bucks for taking apple's side regardless of the argument? Could not have been more biased... And wtf is IPHONE VS ANDROID? Do Samsung vs iPhone or do ANDROID VS IOS
We all can tell he's a iPhone fan boy...ahh poor thing.
Unofficially sponsered ?
If I can see dislikes number, its worth disliking this video, seams to be sponsored .
Seams like apple sponsored the video, even though its not, what about repair-ability and cost of repairing.
On iPhone you need to pay for most applications. You even need to pay Apple to put an app on the apple-store. But Mrwhosetheboss won't talk about this. Big surprise, considering he's always promoting iPhone.
I'm really tired of iPhone vs Android (lets be honest, Samsung) They're both two sides of the same damn coin.  Like with politics, I'm begging for another option. Tesla help us out here!
My s21 ultra runs 20+hrs and charges in 60 mins or less....personally I feel like phones have reached a point they are just so good it depends on two things....your wallet and your preference
I was the biggest android fanboy for the longest time saying I would never use an iPhone, but after switching I don’t want to go back. (I still think android is a better OS though)
What about privacy and security?
so more or less, Iphones are for kids and the elderly while android suits people with more technical interests.
its like:  banana or orange  iphone pizza or tacos iphone bike or car iphone😂
I am iPhone user and do miss Samsung at times because u have more control over your phone in my opinion I feel Samsung has better cameras
Samsung S22 video stabilization is hands down better than any other phone
this is rubbish, you are comparing an os to a phone not os to os, is apple sponsering this?
I think iphone is winner in applications aspect only when used in legit ways, Android supports tons of 3rd party apps which can help people around the world in different ways
A lot of android-supporting idiots in the comment section. Reading comments from such individuals is probably the best form of entertainment available. LOL!!!
If you want to do whatever you want and be able to download and use anything, you get android.    If you want to have no control over your phone, you get iphone.
Welp I'm going off to get an iphone
I use 13 pro max, im not gonna lie other than the built quality of iPhone there's nothing special, I would give anything to trade my iPhone for S22 ultra
I accidentally trigger Siri more than I use Siri.  🤣 "Hey Google, what do you think of that?"
Is this sponsored by Apple?
as a casual phone user who used to be a samsung fan and then switch to iPhone, it is hard to go back to Samsung not only because of the UI but the effeciency and consistency that iPhone gives.
android should win
not real
Reactions buttons in comments section 😁
All I care for in a phone is;  R.A.M. Memory. Camera. Screen Refresh Rate. Massive Amount Of Features Of Options.
Now that's how you make a biased review ;). Complete crap.
Mkbdh is a iphone apple influencer he will always defend apple and will never say anything bad about it. He also uses iphone maxed out, macstudio max out, apple watch, and ipad pro maxed out. He wont use an android ever and thats the thing.
Knowledge and humility at its best form in both gentlemen. Great video!
For him is just the iphone because is the only thing he had used but truly android is stepping ahead in everything
This is just a ripoff to promote apple
This video is literally an Ad for iphone
Very bias video shame on you guys makes me think apple sponsored this video.
mkhbd= Apple sheep
bit biased🤔
Android was, is and will always be the KING 👑Go home iOS baby 😆
Love my S-22 and I can't believe they missed the most important reason to not own and iPhone!   iTunes vs Google or Samsung iPhones get smacked!  iTunes and having to deal with them is a Bad Joke!  Yet, I still missed my old 9+  LOL!
I was so excited to watch you guys together but your reviews were basically out of personal opinion and not spec debate.
Screen is better on samsung so it's a draw. battery is better on iphone but charging matters more and  samsung is faster  IPhone wins ?
Unfortunately I have to feel this was a biased and poor comparison. I would love to see the results from a poll of viewers as I think there would be a huge difference. C'mon Arun, put this one to the people with a survey.    This comparison is actually not a good one. Android is an OS, but Apple is a phone. Shouldn't the comparison be Android vs iOS? On that basis, I think you will have a much fairer review and  also may have completely different score at the end. I grew up on a Apple OS and for a long time it was better, my first smart phone was an iPhone. However, with software limited to applestore and limited customization I feel iOS has not grown much over he years and is still very limiting. For sure Siri is way down the list on AI voice control and information.  Android OS is sometimes problematic due to manufacturers flavors, but a base stock Android OS has been giving more built in features and compatibility than iOS for a long time. Apple has cornered a market with branding more than best features and hardware, and iOS also serves better for people who do not play with phone settings. In reality heardcore users demand more of an OS and especially prefer the ability to customize and add additional features beyond the manufacturers limit.  c
Bro Apple lowkey sponsored this 😂😂😂.
U can attach pendrive  to your android... Also we have nearby share and wifi direct in andorid to share files...at very fast speed so wrong point to iphone....
Are you guys testing the developer previews? 🤔
10000% iPhone 13 pro Max better
Love from 🇧🇩🇧🇩
All IPhone users are dumb there just buying the same phone all over again. Android is better than an iPhone and no one can change my mind.
im the boss 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
Bruh wth , 5-6 .....20's ads which cannot be skipped seems a bit too much to watch a video 🥲🥲
I smell bias
This is more of a iPhone beat up Android video. So unfair to Android users.
I find it interesting that the vast majority of the comments are from Android users. They either don’t watch these types of videos or have no interest in commenting which says a lot about the mindset of iPhone users. They don’t care. Marques statement about the camera and features sums up the average iPhone users. Is the camera the best? Nope, but it just works and is consistent. Androids clearly offer more features but the iPhone exclusive features are more valuable in everyday use like iMessage.   iPhones are more about the ecosystem and user experience than the hardware.   What iPhone users value most is what Android users hate about them. The lack of customization because of the ecosystem. iPhone owners love that iMessage and FaceTime work right out the box. No app to download and setup. AirPods sync immediately and are ready to use just by opening the case. The fact that they can pick up their iPad and take up where they left off on the iPhone. They like the lack of customization because they want the device to work without them thinking about it. They also don’t have the bloatware that Android devices have. Side rant, why does anyone bother to make another assistant when the Google Assistant is better than anything else available and is built into Android. I’m talking about you Bixby.
I think it's down to taste. I personally can't stand Iphone. The closest I ever comes to handling an iphone is because of work.
They need to give that facetime excuse a break. People see me 20x's clearer on duo than FaceTime. I have both in order for me to say this, and FaceTime just added features that duo already had for some time now. I only care about visibility when it comes to video calls etc, and I get less clarity from my iPhone vs my Galaxy
Greetings everyone. How about the One Plus Nine Pro?
iPhone is better, because I like when Facebook and twitters begs for web tracking permission 😁😁😁
They forgot the after playstore apps which u can download in android
I think MKBHD is promoting iphone verymuch 🤣
This is clearly rigged lol
Kinda biased asking a user who is predominantly anchored in the Apple ecosystem.
100% sure. it's a paid promotion
What a pointless and biased video.
yeah iphone better
Totally disagree
Mkbhd is definitely iphone biased
Lol. I guess you guys are being paid for this video. The last time I checked this is not how to do versus video. Who is arguing for Android or iPhone?? iPhone 14 is coming so I understand the marketing.   No argument just the opinion of both of you.
This is the most nonsense videos i have ever seen
these are two of my favorite phone reviewers but I think if you have marques a iphone 3gs and a Samsung s22 ultra he'd chose the 20 year old phone over the brand new phone. Marques is just biased and would never chose android over iOS even if the iOS was silly and the android was breathtaking
comparing samsung and pixel is not great there are other good brand flaship phones In market andriod is the most people choices iphone is so pricy
Next time do iPhone vs Galaxy instead
Top range Android handsets are alot better in every way to iPhone, that's not saying iPhones are awful it's just android is superior,
The aim of this video is to boost the coming new Iphone
Marcus is really showing some unjustified Apple Fanboi bias already and I'm only 3 1/2 minutes into the video.
Great video but completely biased ratings from apple fan boys.
Opinions doesn't really matter in these comparisons. It has to be facts. You guys were 100% bias
I don’t even consider whether a device has USB-C.  It is simply irrelevant as I have piles of other cables and they work to charge my devices.  I have used both Android and iOS.  The latter simply works better for me.  For years the biggest deficiency of Android for me was the lack of a proper backup mechanism.  On iOS you could plug one phone in, back it up, then restore to another phone.  Android required extra software which then seldom actually even worked.  Another big problem with Android for me is the fragmentation and ridiculous range of device options even from one manufacturer.  I don’t want to spend a lot of time trying to figure out which model to buy.  Give me a clear hierarchy and chip standards across devices.  Also standardise the Android interface across all manufacturers.  Then there was the lack of update support for the devices which appears to have become a bit better, but is still far behind Apple.
Good thing is that android and iOS devices have become so good that now choosing either really is purely a matter of preference rather than one is necessarily better than the other. It is now really about ecosystem and convinience features. If apple watch worked fully as it does on android as it does on ios i would be rocking an s21/22 ultra. Really love the spen. Even more than i do the apple pencil
For Display and Camera definitely go with Samsung. 120 hz is definitely faster on samsung. Iphone 120 hz looks very slow. I feel like Iphone has 90hz not 120hz. Because it is slow
galaxy s22 ultra and oppo find x5 pro the King
If apple reduce price by 50% Android premium and mid segment phone will just collapse
Yet another easy win for Apple. All andriod offers is ability to customize a ring tone, make the fonts looks different, and use dex as if it's 1999 and you don't already have access to your pc on a daily basis. Iphone offers a fluid user experience and just works. Not to mention compatibility with all major third parties whose products are worth using.
Iphone is casual users wherein android is for enthusiasts and power users.
Mkbhd goes unreasonably apple... Weird!
I'm sorry, but this was a horrible video. You all often refused to give Android the point (or solely give Android the point) even when they had the better product
Google is carbon neutral
LoL , iPhone is shit
Why does MKBHD always give awards to Android phones then? 😂 Phone of the year. Lol. What a joke.
What always makes me chuckle about these videos is how it exposes the ridiculous ‘Apple Sheep’ meme for what it is.   The second any video dares to suggest there is value in iOS over Android - or *GOD FORBID* it might, overall, be the superior platform the comment section is absolutely inundated with Pro android fandom.    The reality is - both platforms are great, and it’s basically down to personal preference, and how you use your device. That’s really about it.
bruh you gave battery to iphone
If you want amazing innovative never before seen features come out after Android has had them for years then iPhone is a definite winner! If you want a REAL phone with a proper user centered ecosystem versus a curated ecosystem then Android is the clear winner by far.
MKBHD is iphone biased. He ignores many things Android does in a better way.  Even he will refer iphone se over flagship Android. He really does that.
Marques doesnt know this but this was his secret certification test and now he is a certified Apple fanboy.
I disagree with that, bias,...iphone just suck... And i don't like the line of android features are just in small number of people you know its bullshit men
This is just an iPhone commercial...the same hype for "how great" Apple is...they say "(even if Apple's camera is the most boring), the most boring is the best". Stop talking up Apple; they charge the most money for the product which they then have to hype for sales.
Airdrop=Nearby share
Clearly.. I dont think you guys did just to the platforms.. Your audience would shrink to a targeted one.
There is a new law forcing all phone manufacturers (including Apple) to adopt USB-C in the near future.
This is sponsored Apple video...
Cool Video, Thanks :)
It’s not quite fair since some features are more important than others but their value is still 0.5 points.
Charging speed i need thats all,.if iPhone have it..its Total win,.
Lol. He's like"android better bla bla bla" but still pick iphone hahahaha
we can't trust them we know they both iPhone fanboys 😅
MKBHD prefers S21 over S22 because it has better vibration motor (Thats more imp than the rest of improvements). He prefers to take pictures with the insta app than the main camera app because thats how you judge a phones camera. Also new innovative camera features are a bit of the downer, better to have same old repetitive features or teams than the new champions. When you are in a rush to go out and your phones battery is dead, then you would realise whether you like fast charging or long battery life. Where you awake for 24 hrs on your flight using your phone or there was no charging option on an international flight? Your video seemed more like a rating of mkbhd and you agreeing to it anyway, defeated the purpose of the collaboration.
Ah yes, iPhone fan boys
I think one very important thing you guys missed was about the OS. you guys judged it based on features that one had, but the other didn't, but I think the arguably much more important question is to see which of the already mutually existing features is better. I would say android absolutely wins here, with simple things such as the notification system, and volume controls being superior in basically every way. I don't really care about the specs of the battery, or screen, or anything else, I really just care about the amount of frustrations I get with systems that should be simple to use. I also don't think either phone is necessarily less reliable than the other, its just you've decided to point out some specifics which happen to fall behind than the other, where actually there are other features that would turn it around.
One very important point goes to iphone is the size. There are gorilla sized android phones on the market unfortunately. The time came for me to find a replacement for my old brick, and suddenly 13 mini is the only option. I don't care about games(why to do it on a small phone anyway), but I want my phone to last a day reliably. So zenphone is out of competition
Well I think samsung has the best display and the freedom of android to customize and no limitations.
MKBHD sponsored by Apple
for me always samsung
no offense to anyone but I'm team android and apple cuz they both have their brights and flaws
I will admit that apple is much more better when it comes too their software compared too most andorid devices ....  But i do love an samsung but with the current issuses ive had with the s21 i will most likely have too move on too apple ....
Legitimately they went personal preference/bias over measurable things for most of their points. 🤦🏾‍♂️
I don't agree at all with just about any of the decisions you two chose so unsubscribed
you butchered android!!! there are 18GB RAM Androids right now out there, how long is iphone going to take to have 18GB RAM...year 2050??? I will take a Bentley W12 cylinder engine over a V8 engine
Samsung and iPhone fan boys
So at the beginning apple wins for the battery and charging then 5 minutes later it states the charging stops when it gets hot and freezes which is annoying but apple still wins.That is all i needed to see to judge for myself if this was a biased test.
Google maps are way better than apple maps.
Watching  this video on my s22 ultra, and at the same time texting in watsapp using split screen mode 😇
A draw for the display is just ridiculous.. The screen on Apple phone is nowhere near equal
I love apple, from the iPhone, Apple Watch to iPad Pro, Mac and so on… but… I LOVE Samsung DeX and miss it greatly. I’m thinking about getting both ecosystems. Basically just buying an S23 ultra and Samsung galaxy tab ultra model to add. Because I am about to buy a surface pro and I want something I can use well with windows. But my true love is Arch Linux 😍😍😍
Feel like this was biased but I'm glad it's just opinion.
Man I love my IPhone 13 Pro Max in green it’s awesome it does allot of things great the cameras serve me very well I gotta take tons of photos for work these cameras are bordering on DSLR good I’m a fan for sure I always wanted to hate Apple but it’s good especially when you get a watch and the AirPods Max it crazy how well everything works together
Display the same foh..and performance better on iPhone?  Fohhh
MKBHD is such a Apple fan boy now!
Sorry MrWhoseTheBoss I just saw ur reply to my post today. and i guess i am not eligible for the price anymore because its been 7 days already. anyway tnx again
Non repairable cameras, screens, ports, etc Lightning connector, disputed UK insisting lightning was kept for environmental reasons Removing fingerprint sensor Bad operating system for large phones (swiping notifications, app placement etc.) Unable to sideload apps on iOS Terrible screen sleep time adjustment Holding wifi/Bluetooth in quick menu doesn't open respective settings Toggling off wifi/Bluetooth doesn't actually toggle off. Just closes active processes using wireless Unlocking phone with face id requires swipe, instead of just opening Unable to use Google maps, Gmail, Google tasks etc via Siri Unable to move apps to the bottom of home screen  android ftw
regarding eco-consciousness, reparability wasn't even talked about. android takes the win 100% bc you can replace a screen/battery/port and not purchase an entire new phone
Uhhhh can I get a Track ID for the first part of the vid? Like at 1:00?
Android fanboys going crazy in this comment section😂
"Better than the rest but slightly behind Samsung, so this one goes to IPHONE" Apple Fanboys! 😜
The most important issue for me is ads, i havent seen an ad on my phone in a long time because i used moded apk versions which have no ads. I used an iphone and it was unusable due to the constant ads.
I sense biasness towards Android and favouritism towards apple
Apple fanboys 🤢
“Apple, but only because of the larger ecosystem” would be my answer for almost every one of these. I’ve had high end Android phones and I currently have the 13 Pro Max — great phone, but I can’t think of one thing it does better than the now-outdated OnePlus 9 Pro or Samsung S20+. The ecosystem, and my workflow therein, have me “stuck” with an iPhone.
Alway on, quicker charge, spen, more zoom, more nits, usb C...
Ah yes let us ask this apple watch wearin fella, his opinions are surely not biased
Dude lost all my respect for MKBHD here for me he has 0 credibility as of now.
Seems like biased and promoting iPhone, anyway that's his own opinion and choice he's entitled to that.
Haha, guys are funs of apple. Not that objective.  I am loyal to apple and last 10 years user of Iphone. I like its stability and protectiveness.  But sustainability topic -I would put apple 0. I dont care how much they use materials 2nd time if they force me to change devices every 2-3 years by making it slow, week on battery and stopping support. Simple example I have ipod touch which is  7 years and it freezes all the time, no music apps are working (on ipod!!!).  I have nexus tablet which is 10 years and works as new.  Interesting that durability is not the part of sustainability.:/ Thanks for taking time and comparing!

Marcus brownlee will always choose iPhone hes a iphone enthusiast to the point hes blatantly paid by apple
They both have pros and cons.  Use whichever you want.
Ohh no no no no, you don't ask such a question from a guy in the U.S of A
most creators are applefan boys/girls...ill leave it at that
Wow just cause apple adds a bit of customization to their lockscreen, they're on par with androids customizing capabilities?
20:06 Maques: Wait why didn't you do the....oh wait I forgot he's not black....😂😂🤣
Y'all just forgot to mention, sponsored by Apple! You 2 just lost a long time viewer! LMAO, the audacity!
Why put a iPhone fanboy on here surely you should have someone less biased to android and iPhone for a better poll
This was like watching US election, when you define subjects favorably to your opinion you can nullify all the good things android does better with one thing that it does not do as well, and if there is no actual issue  just invent one. Like the complaint of not actually saving picture after taking it. Never happened to me and been using android since galaxy S1. Has anyone actually seen this kinda of behavior with default android camera app?
the lighting was terrible ?? dude relax, most of us come to you for objective reviews...   do this as long as you enjoy it, this is my favorite review channel.
Call unbox therapy on your next comparison 🤣 Fucking Apple fan boys
Why do I feel like you wanted Apple to win for some reason?
So am I assuming the sound quality for music, speaker quality, call quality, ear pod quality, ring quality is all the same across the both devices?
great... It would be nice to have different scores from you two and then compare and discuss where your scoring differs. Great video and very difficult topic to generalise
Two iphone fanboys compare Android with iphone. What score do you think will be at the end 😁
Apple is better every one shut up if you like android
Customization is literally the only topic android users use to try and argue which is better.. MKBHD said it perfectly “Android has good features a small amount of people care about, and apple has extremely important features for a large amount of people”! Iphone has better battery, better build quality, better all around camera, better ui, essential features like airdrop, face unlock, shareplay, facetime, imessage, 3rd party accessibility, etc and in my opinion to much customization is a bad thing, gets overwhelming, Android seems like a restaurant that has 1000 things on the menu to hide that there food isnt as good lol, apple is the restaurant with a more limited selection but the food is sensational (gap is closing though with ios 16)
MKBHD is apple's bitch
I have a feeling this might have had a little outside influence in terms of scoring. Even in the comments a lot is talked about that is missed in the cons of Apple. A good point is that you state how Apple has 5 years of updates but in those 5 years they will brick your phone so bad that it isn't usable anymore, they want you to buy another phone. I'm still using my S8 and its more than enough for watching youtube, browsing the internet, using apps. You can't say the same for Apple, especially historically. Which brings me to another point about sustainability... You mention the eye catching number of 20% recycled material but gloss over the fact they use outdated charging methods to make you purchase additional hardware to juice their margins. They don't include the necessary components to make a phone operate. Apple is terrible with 3rd party stuff as they want you to buy their headphones, watches, and other add ons like streaming. They want you to stay in their ecosystem as it makes them more money. TBH kinda feels like another iPhone fanboy video where you don't actually cover the downfalls of Apple, not your usual video.
You guys did not really go by phones. You made decisions on the popularity of them. And of course Apple would win. Side by side many other you tubers would highly disagree with this score if it were based on phone and not the popularity amongst people.
Yea I don't know about these guys anymore. I have both the samsung S22 Ultra and iPhone 12pro max. I have to say that the only reason why I use the iPhone is because my kids like the popularity of it. But better than my S22, nah. Battery life is not better when I use it as much as I use my s22u
1:26, 2:07, 2:52, 3:39, 6:31, 7:53 "It kinda reminds me of sports where the most boring team to watch is often the best one."
Was about to comment in favor of Android bcz i can customize almost anything free of cost with ads. But, if one can afford Apple, good for them. I am happy with my Android as it is pocket friendly and customizable.
Biased
I switched from Apple to Android a few years ago. There's no way I'm going back to IOS ever again! I love the freedom I find in Android phones.
Android 24/7
*SPONSORED BY APPLE* So biased. 👎
You can feel the tension between these two 😅 Great video, nonetheless.
If you ever did this again, I think a good question is:  Which is better for the mobile industry? The space as a whole. Cause I think you could make a hugely impactful argument that the things that people love about iPhone are actually bad for the mobile experience UNLESS you're on an iPhone. And most of that is refusal on apples part to use industry standards.
You guys are just the best keep up with the good I appreciate it a lot when I have money in the future I really want an iphone for sure.. Thank you
I will always from heart support Android. If I need iphone for work thats different. Buy I prefer android.
I loved this video, I subscribe to you both. I think you should have done a score board beneath both of you. You both seemed to be quite varied on opinion but would agree at the end of each category. 👍🏼❤️ Keep up with the awesome videos.
and still.. MKBHD is using android as his main phone
I hate how they removed the headphone jack. Then Samsung followed because it was trendy. Luckily I have a phone with a jack but it sucks that I have to have Bluetooth if I want a new phone.
Dislike.
What about accessibility features between the two systems?  I use Voiceover on my iPhone how would I find Android and its accessibility?
Windows Phone is better than both Android and iPhone
iPhone Commercial
Awesome video
And here's the comparison sponsored by apple🙂
What battery to iphone??? Really like reallyyy u mad or wot
All the software features that they mentioned for apple are just apps for android that you can download pretty easy and have the same thing. Wouldn't really count that as a point for apple.  Edit: its pretty funny how most of the comments are leaning towards android
Think most of your opinions were too biased for this videos......i can agree for video shooting, and the software performance but iphone is just overhyped...... And biggest mistake is of this video is comparing hundreds of random android phones to one specific device
I think they need to do just strictly Samsung vs Apple. Android is an operating system, being used by literally HUNDREDS of various companies in different forms. Android is not a phone brand. Samsung, is the best representation of Android to Apple.
I think no one should compare android to iphone because there is thousands of them in the other hand iphone is only iphone. If you were to compare iphone to samsung that would be fine because samsung is only samsung and not all of the android phones.
You're comparing 10-1000++ companies with one company. Uncomparable. Software wise, android is undefeatable king. This is a controversial topic with big bias to one side. The scoring really doesn't make any sense. Not that I can blame you though. Obviously you will not read this anyway.
Before this video even started I knew everything was going to go to iPhone it's a gimmick 🤷🏾‍♂️
Hard disagree on eco-friendliness. Apple, with their willingness to force you to buy their charger, their headphones, their anti-repairability, and so on, ultimately results in them being above-average in eco hostility.
7 days and lagdroid users still crying in the comment.  Truth seems to hurt that your device is not better, has never been better, and never will be anywhere near iOS.
hows apple gonna get a point for the display if they buy them from samsung
🍎 has an efficient business model for locking in the maximum number of people into their ecosystem — that's why I'll never cave and my bias will always lean towards freedom, choice, value, and customization😏✅
In my personal opinion and from what I've personally experienced: iPhone does not have good zoom camera, it does not have always on display, it does not support some things like LDAC codec, some apps available in android are missing in iPhone, no way to change your keyboard the way you want it, the way settings are set up feel very annoying and unorganised to me, the notch is a big no no and in general feels very laggy and unreliable, the one thing I loved though is the physical silent switch and the beautiful bright colours on the screen. I enjoyed using Samsung galaxy s22 ultra way more. And in the end, as much as I want to like the iPhone, I am sticking with android higher end smartphones until apple can introduce the things I mentioned above. Obviously, every individual will have different needs and for a lot of people the iPhone might be the better choice.
None of this matters. No one picks android or iPhone for best specs or performance. It all comes down to OS. Do you prefer iOS or android?
I mean iOS 16 really ain’t shit soo let’s be real
I'm shocked that reliability is a draw, but yeah. I've experienced Safari(!) crashing on an iPad and Youtube crashing on a Samsung flagship.
Sorry but not really objective this review.
Obviously 2 apple fan boys
Yeah fair comparison iphone users will always pick iphone and same goes for andriod
Dude, you just rolled over in defending Android.
I don't want to pick up the Isheep card.. but I'm really disappointed with your sheep conversation... Let's assume the things:  Both are taken out the worst Samsung phone ever and compared with the iPhone, and you missed things all the time. Why not compare it with the Pixel 6 pro? The Samsung is just good, not excellent. The software is a piece of sh*t in all Samsung models.. the Laggdroid is named after Samsung. And these things need to know by both of you, you are talking about Android and always pick up the worst model to make an example. If the IPhone model had a bug it always downsized. What about the oversaturated, mostly underexposed photos. Security problems: Wifi certification problems...  My Nokia 3210 can do things that on the iPhone still missing. Of course, the Isheeps says the is the feature not neccessary. And now the IOS16 finally gets widgets, like the movable time widget. TADAMM::: New feature, this feature exists from 2.1 Android, of course from this time until the feature does not exist in IOS it Wasn"t important. I know the ecosystem is much better in IOS ways and knows a lot of things, and in some way is coolest than the android... But I tell to both of you. You are not more than just and good created influencer who really lost their reality - (ISheep)
This was a anfair rating because android in a lot of perspective wins but because iphone have a name for it self a lot of points goes for it. Don't forget mkbhd is a American YouTube channel 💀
The most pointless video I've seen all week!
Waste of my time.
Is it just me orrr. There being biassed as heck😂😂😂. They like highlights the WORLD changing teck evolution of an Android . Than just say that they like ip because of some childish personal reasons and declare ip the winner😂😂
u forgot bixi
Those 2 are just Apple enjoyers, and you can see that the scoring is based on just their personal opinions :) Video feels like sponsored, many iPhone problems are hidden here
For me who can't afford the premium phones (Android or iPhone), I will choose affordability yet still have great features. Most Android phones wins by a big margin. You can't use what you are not able to afford, can you? iPhone can innovate but Android can compete and provide similar experiences at affordable pricing. And lastly, Android doesn't lock the user up.
It was a fun watch.
You guys didn't talk about build quality, that should have been included.  Don't you think that Android phones would have scored better?
Keeping in mind this is the opinion of two individuals, and user experience varies for one person to another. In my experience switching from the 12 Pro max to the Pixel6P, and generally speaking, I can say Battery, video, software support.. iPhone wins hands down. All other categories Android wins.
Too many android fanboys raging right now 😂
So the iPhone took a draw in the customization category based on the lock screen custamization options alone? Android has so many more customization features. I'm going to take a page out of Mrwhosetheboss book and call it as it is.. absolutely ridiculous.
this is an i phone advert, I phones are made in the same place as android but are 5 times the price, whilst maybe slightly better in some ways but no way 5 times. Android YES
I can agree that iphones are really nice and smooth from a UI perspective. I don't really like the look of them, at all. Plus the biggest issue I have is their isolated little eco-system where the stuff you purchase is only yours within that little eco-system. I also really hate the unwillingness to allow people to fix their own stuff. Apple products to me, when you buy them are "yours". There are a million barriers in the way to prevent anyone other than their certified technicians access to fixing them. It's as if they're concerned parents taking the little Leggo blocks out of a box of Leggos in the fear that the child is going to decide to start cramming them into stupid bodily orifices.
Mr who's the boss is too scared to call out MKBHD out when he's wrong 🤣
I used to be an android guy but at a certain point you just want your phone to work I got tired of all the tinkering
So its basically when you are stuck to an environment u want that,,, that was the only place apple won
iOS is better. Android OS ruins all non iPhones for me
Awesome collaboration! love the video
The "BACK"-Button is my winning-piece for Android. Can't use a phone without it - the swiping on the iPhone just doesn't work all the time like i want it to work.
Pretty much apple is for kids and Android is for adults.
My old S8+ has a much brighter screen than the S22 Ultra.
MKBHD team iphone for life.
Apple phones is the best of all phones
I am big fan of mrwhoistheboss but  this video in my opinion is a little biased because mkbhd is  a long time iPhone user like things which are not good in iPhone he is just like ,it is enough for me or something else. At the end I am sorry if I hurt anyone sentiments .....
Funny
5:28 wait what? This charger charged the house from the phone? Is that a new feature?
I lost it at 🔋
It's a promotion video for apple 🍏 🍎
For youtubers
i saw like 10 ads in this video u serious bruh
There are things yet to be discussed ,if this were to be done u guys should have brought up other judges representing other android company who use the phone as their daily driver ,am a xaomi user and I enjoy our ecosystem , coming from updates u have android that are built by Google who receive long update like iOS ,so pls I did enjoy the video but pls make it a fair comparison
Finally a phone discussion that’s not 90% cameras. Nothing pisses me off than over-detailed camera segments.
When growing up i longed for some of my favourite stars to collab , i remember the first time i saw De niro & Pacino in heat then their was the coming together of Stallone & Schwarzenegger and now the biggest of them all MKBHD & Mr Who's the Boss !
0:50 I don’t know how to feel about this my 13 pro max is only working on 80fps and doesn’t feel like true 120fps unless a game is forcing it
Iphone is trash compared to android!
Black guy: Android has that interesting option but I don't use that so often that's why it goes to iPhone.
4 months ago Arun: Samsung wins against the iPhone easily.  Arun now: the iPhone wins against all Android phones easily.
Great Topic!
iPhone is just mediocre phone that excels at nothing except having a easy user interface so any dumb ass can use it.
When it comes to the s22 ultra is it the camera that makes pictures so clear or the resolution
I feel that they scored this comparison unfairly (I won't say who was slightly biased towards iPhone, but his name begins with an "M"), so I kept my own score and the flagships were tied at 2.5/2.5 at half time 😅🤝😌. It's only fair to compare the best of Android vs the best of iPhone.
I like both phones. there are pros and cons to both phones.
One big reason I cannot switch to iphone.  I cannot play youtube and record audio at the same time.  This is important for me because I record myself singing using Youtube karaoke videos.  It has helped me immensely as how much I have improved over the years.  And I cant believe Iphone cannot do this simple task.  All the speed in the world is worth nothing without this feature for me.  I like how androids are practically like mini computers.  The Iphone is too limited.
Why is the white man in his underwear?
Apple has put a lot of effort to push you towards its ecosystem.
I would like Apple to switch to USB-C, but I’m so used to lightning ports, USB-C is an android win for every 2020-22 flagship
Normally you would like to root & overclock a device if it isn’t performing  So with a phone the has decent performance what’s the use?
Summary, Android is better, iPhone is more expensive. 	END!
Used android for 10 years but as Marques said, I switched to iPhone for reliability and the must have apps. Never regretted once or looked back, it’s just a better phone for everyday. The basics we need everyday is what iPhone is so strong at.
Lol bro !! I think you should include this is an apple sponsored video.  Android users know the Truth.
Another IPhone fan boy
Rumor is y’all slept together and made it officially weird af
It is a freaking blowout.  Expected a more even battle.
Fuck iphone/ios with its closed ecosystem. I'll take android to my grave.
@Mrwhosetheboss  Hi guys, there is a scammer in the name mrwhosotheboss1 replying for comments in these videos saying that I have a gift for you. Don't send any money to him, please be aware.
There is no fair comparison, amateur youtuber
I had a note 10 plus and deceided to switch to iphone so I ordered an iphone 13 pro max, I received it last tuesday today is friday and I already put it back in the box to returned to apple. Im staying android :)
You left out Android Auto vs iphone's abomination called car play.   Did you do that on purpose?
Awesome video
Hey I got an s22 ultra the other day do recommend
Man I use s22 ultra, iPhone isn't even close to the looks and performance! IPhone lover MkBhD has lost my fan following! I have been watching him probably since 5 years, but now he is all about iPhone!
iPhone ..it's not as good as u describe it!! Android is 100% more customisable and way more open source than iOS eco system.
Let's be honest the only good apple phone is the 13
And it's opinion based so it's not fair
Lol just let's him win
Ego conscience samsunf is 300000000 times better
Sooooooo buyist samsung camera is sooooo much better
It's all about personal preference... a boring-ass response, but no less true. Both iPhone and androids are good phones. Do you want/need the Apple ecosystem (granted Samsung has one too)? full customization and screens without a notch? a little stronger battery given a better processor and hardware-software integration? split-screen multitasking? iMessage (which is huge for a lot of people)? more options? This just goes on and on. It's interesting and informative to hash out the positives/negatives of each, but any argument of preference becomes a mundane waste of time beyond that.
I also love that you can side load apps. As.a creative DJI often releases updated that you can't get via the PlayStore, having control over my phone means I can get it working etc and don't have to worry a gate keeper will stop me from getting the fix right away.
Software features going to iOS? You guys really must have been tired.
What I don’t understand is why only what marque’s said score points no matter the opinion of the other reviewer. Plus there are so much other stuff you can do on android like add addons or plugins to browsers and apps, you can modify stuff, you get multi platform support, on linux, Mac or windows, you can program on any platform, I can’t do that for an iPhone. Hotspot on iPhone is unreliable, it keeps dropping while on android is top notch. I know because I use those features everyday for work.
Well, duh! 😜 iPhone obviously!
How can you give them the same screen score. It makes no sense.
This is like my dream conversation 😂 I'm so glad y'all collabed ✨✨
Easy to say iPhone won
i feel like marques was using loads of excuses for iphone so that it would be "better" lol
I thought both of you were android fans. Never expected this betrayal. And a drastic difference of score!!!
Favoritism people ,please, please just use what fits you,iphone will never ever be a performance  phone,them tiktokers phone
7:50 dies inside xD
This guy Marques Brownlee is a sold out 💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💸💸💸💸💸💸to Apple big time. He just awarded SamsuNg Galaxy 22+  the best Smartphone  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
in short i am huge fan of both. but for this particular video i strongly think that influencers themselve got influenced.
They didn't judgeed well.
What idiocary is this? 🤔
It’s as if Ronaldo vs everyone lmao shitty androids
so many if and but, still noone dare to dislike iphones 😂 strange
MKBHD behaving like a noob apple fanboy. Now I've seen everything.
I disagree with every fruit win here...why...because using my company fruit vs my s22 ultra...the Samsung wins evrytime and in every category...oh and trying to use fruit is the worst os ever
I Will Keep my pixel ;-)
Two pros literally prove why the IOS is undefeated. 🤷🏻‍♂️  Don’t wanna hear Android clowns cry about how ‘Android can do this but iOS cant”  iOS is objectively better. Deal with it.    But on a more serious note, it’s all up to preference. Use what you want.
My Samsung just works...whereas my company fruit phone...what an awful experience.. let me check notifications...oh you have to pull down from top left corner...why... let's modify calendar in outlook...Good luck...fruit phones are the worst user experience I have ever had in a phone
Google needs to find a solution for Android cameras being terrible on social media apps.
i think mkbhd got money from apple for this kind of promotion 😂. what a waste of time watching this shit
have u lost ur mind. android should have won or tied in the end because these days alot of people know how to use phones and all their features meaning that alot more people would prefer faster and more features especially for gamers which is the biggest thing there is now. and you also have to encounter that phones can only get much better which gives apple a better chance to catch up but if we go a few years back android (specifically samsung) would be better.
Great video as always keep it up
Sponsored by apple
20:08 you left my mans hanging 🥲
It is not aple to aple comparison...if you know what I mean.
I think MKBHD came to this comparison video with Apple Pay cheque!!
Android is an ocean..   And ios is a sea...       Some like sea because but legend's like only android..  Ultra legends also use android..  Its versatile..
Sorry
Recently switched to iPhone… I miss split screen and dex.  I find iOS keyboard maddening.  Adding attachments to emails is a chore.  Selecting text is glitchy.  Even changing wall paper is more complicated.  But one thing that’s unforgivable: not being able to place icons anywhere you want.  That said, face unlock, airdrop, battery life and video recoding is fantastic. As well as third party peripheral availability.   Maybe I just need to have both in my pocket.
Dude chill
Sponsor of the video : Apple Inc. 🙂
Was this an Apple TV ???... Man I knew yall were apple guys but this is offensive . Need someone to do a real comparison not this🐂💩!
I’ve never wanted a knew iPhone more
Worst video i have ever seen from the top tech influencers, you shouldn't  upload these one sided kind of videos, feel pity for you two  Best of luck
LoL. You lost me in the camera section. :v
iPhone= rich people. Android= peasants.
how about comparing that the volume difference between the two is ass, can't afford a mic bruh?
You can't give a point to iPhone just because they locked their eco system and kinda forcing their users to use one specific application... Android is a OS for the free people and you can't skip this... It's like my friend who bought an high end Garmin smart watch and ios doesn't allow him to use it properly. Nahh.. you have to use our products, we want all
Samsung 🐐
This video is brought to you by....... two Apple fans!
AirDrop isn‘t working as good as ist used to be. Share Play from Samsung or Nearby share from all androids is equal if not even better because of more devices
Bad take on the sustainability. You shouldn't even be looking at the "percentage of recycled materials" when there's so much to be said in the categories of reducing waste and reusing products.
The lighting s**ks? I really enjoyed this video. Thank you very much.
the fact that my 80$ phone has a better batt then a 1,000$ i phone
BTW, MKBHD's the prestigious Best Smart Phone Award goes to Android phones. Irony!
I think android software need to be more clean but overall android is better than iOS. Now android does not have the perfect phone  to compete against the iphone
Bias video just to promote iPhone. Wasted my time watching that nonsense
so cool ^^
I know this video is just an opinion, but why did the iPhone tie in display and win in photography? It felt like you guys were actively trying to give points to the iPhone in all of these categories. That said, I think this would be interesting to do with someone who actually daily drives an Android device like LTT.
Basically iPhone is reliable and consistent. Which is a really, really big factor in this increasingly overwhelming world.
I am impressed that this wasn't one of those comparison videos that end up in a tie.
The fact that you don't have to be confused between 10000 different phones when buying an iphone is good enough to pick it over android
This is the most garbage comparison ever. Marques is clearly not objective in this case.  I hate both operating system equaly, but the clear winner here is Android. It got way more flexibility you can actually use it in each and anyway you want. That cannot be said on the iPhone, or iPad for that matter.
All I can say I am a android guy it's amazing
Two Goats of the industry. MkB had a android but seemed to praise Apple whenever possible. Interesting.
I don't care how good it is, I refuse to buy an Iphone. I'm a different kinda masochist.
Go team android!
Hey, just wondering how come iPhones won the score, but both of you stick to Android?
@Mrwhosetheboss I thought it was interesting that neither of considered the services that are used by the OS by default.  So essentially GCP/GSuite vs iCloud in the eco friendly war.  Google has been carbon neutral with the goal of being carbon free by 2030 unfortunately Apple doesn't really state where iCloud lives so it could be in a non-sustainable environment.  Apple has mentioned AWS and Azure in the past only has places "like these" in regards to iCloud, this is important because let's say you keep your device for years those services could still be a daily drag on the environment long after the manufacturing of the device is over. Just something to think about...
Funny how i know iphones are best reasonably in smartphone world.. convenient etc.. But i still can't dich android.. not now.. The freedom is too good
13:34 I love Dex and Bixby routines. No other choice for me than Samsung.
biased and prejudice i feel
Poor comparison. You switched standards (environmental suddenly is iPhone vs top end Android, for example).  This could have been a very useful comparison, but instead disregarded issues like being locked into the Apple ecosystem.  A proper comparison would have compared Apple phones to their price or status equivalents in the Android world.  Disappointing.
I like the "feel" of android over apple. Apple is kinda "toyish"
iPhone only good for who had good money 🤑
Two actors that actually knows nothing about pruductivity of smartphone and Apple paying to them for creating video ads.
Wow, so battery life was covered without taking charging speed into consideration. This seems to be a biased comparison. Oppo has rolled out 150W charging for its phones and iPhone is at, what, 20W? Yes, the increase isn't linear but SuperVOOC can do 50% in 5 mins (for a 4500 mAh battery). Makes the whole conversation meaningless.
Lol, all this comparison did was to open my eyes as to how low the bar is for smartphone journalism in general. On the PC side of things, analysis and discussion is much more objective and rigorous. Granted, a phone does a LOT of things, so it is difficult, but still. MKBHD's comments seemed like a joke to me, too casual and not all that well thought out
I have a problem with this comparison. It's general knowledge that apple's hardware-software compatibility is A+, so on average iPhone will on average will be better. However comparing it to all of android where companies tend to focus on specific areas while sacrificing another is tricky and the end result may very well be misleading.
So sad to tell you that this one looks like a totally biased video. You guys are ruining your fame. 😞
Display is android..IPhone is not that good as a average android Display
*This video is sponsored by Apple*
MKBHD'Sopinions and views are biased.clearly he gives apple more credit than it deserve
To me, android is the only way to go with the ability to swap out SD cards, dual sim support, headphone jack for recording is just a must. Plus Vivaldi browser plus a few other apps I use are non-existent on ios
Apple is shit. The software cant edit phone numbers in dialer pad and have to erase it all to edit
Didn't know apple does paid promotions
Great video. But if you follow Marques Brownlee you know he is Apple bias. A fair video who have been if you were the  mediator, and you get  Brownlee to give his take on iPhone and bring in another YouTube like Flossy Carter for Android.
biased.
That handshake tho
A lot of this is also preference
So which is more economic? "Well if we don't take into account the android additions that whipe the floor with iPhone, then the point goes to iPhone!".
I don't agree with the comparison. Android has AOSP, which means freedom and iPhone's doesn't touch near that in part of software and is available for masses and person can choose of his own choice. A person who has a bit of knowledge can admin the Android with root access and completely de-bloat the trackers, software etc. iPhones don't have that. iPhones are good in terms of stability and long term usage, however, not for everyone. So, don't compare with Android phones. Android software offers to build their own operating system for their own device and many devs build that for everyone for a community, which means freedom from Trackers, ads an so many things. iPhones doesn't have that option and it means you  are slave for the company and you will have to manage what company has to give. A person using Iphone is just a earning source for the company. Main thing is Android is Open Source which means Freedom and iOS and apple cannot offer that in life time.
never have i ever seen so much bias in a video. sheeesh
U both supporting iphone but in reality. Display- samsung winner performance - iphone  battery- equal as depend upon user demand whether long lasting or fast charging. camera- samsung
I like being able to plug in a cable and drag files over to any type of computer without needing AirDrop, installing iTunes (and making a hack out of backups) or anything other than just USB MTP.
I like how people always say: Apple sucks. It is a money stealing garbage. But if you really think about it..Apple is just a little more cleaner than Android. Don’t come after me Android ppl, but all I am  saying the that we should stop hating on Apple for no reason
iPhone won the competition, but both judges prefer Android as their personal phones :p
Watching these two was like peeking into the teachers lounge and watching two professors discussing some science projects.
MKBHD is clearly favouring more of US phones.....not even mentioning the Chinese companies which are way better Google phones
Taking photos with Xiaomi Mi 12 is a great experience, so... why I'm still use my iPhone for this matter? Well... the integration with all my devices and iCloud is very easy with iOS.
Why do I think that this is a competition between iPhone and android
Fast Charging Repairability Eco-System (Compatibility)
Interesting they both don't use androids split screen.   I use it constantly for maps and music while driving.  Or budgeting with a calculator and notes open.  I'll use that when food shopping as well.   I find it crazy apple doesn't have that feature yet.
Iphone will dim screen when playing game a little longer ?
I felt this video was massively biased towards Apple. I have nothing more to say
Happy To See You Anytime !!!  I love you forever #@!
Nice To Meet You !!!
Most of these arguments are sad at best. It's like you take an intelligent point then Weasley your way into a reason to pick apple.  And locking people into having anxiety over leaving an iPhone over FaceTime or airdrop is not a pro. Airdrop, who cares, iTunes, what a buggy pos software. That's a reason in itself to never own an apple product  I don't find anything easy or better on an iPhone.
it would be a good addition to also add the watches Apple and Samsung make and compare them
Yooo android has features that can make it look like an iPhone. Therefore, android wins that section for features
I used both phones.. this completely biased
Biased..  totally unacceptable
There is no YoutubeVanced (or sideloading in general) on ios. This alone makes android the winner.
Not the android fanboys so pissed in the comments
I choose Android as they are not too greedy like Apple. Apple charges more for less. I understand that they have style and quality.. but money is significantly on the higher side.
Camera seriously iphone? Then why would it never made it to the final of your blind camera test?
I use split screen for work stuff.
I think mkbhd is the most racist guy.What a fucking biased review is this.Even screen is equal for him.See how apple pays for techies..1.5 for android is some kind of joke.
Great to see these 2 collaborating! But, man does this video feel biased and sponsored... sorry guys
tbh you know mkbhd is an apple fanboy and he just loves using apple products  so hes gonna go for apple in most of the cases
Biased video though.
When you compare smartphone you should compare markets shares and talk from the majority of share into consideration not only from America/Europe perspective of things.
Android is better for me  And I am writing this from my iPad
Seems like  MKBHD got paid from apple! More like an apple fanboy comparing an iPhone with Android!
For pricing I feel it should've been a draw..   Resale value on an iPhone is so much higher than on any Android. So you get more % of your money spent when buying the phone back when you then sell it on..
FORNITE BALLE PASS
ITS SIMPLE -  YOU CAN USE AN ADNROID, BUT AN IPHONE USES YOU !
please make a podcast together.. it will be fun
If I want an IOS, I can only have an Iphone, if I want an Android, I have multiple phones to choose from
This is bullshit , how can you make a draw in display
This was so bias I mean no one should even listen to this because it does not make sense and it's not true I have both phones and I'm telling you  Samsung Galaxy 22 ultra kills iPhone there is no match not one bit samsung call quality is so much better then Apple  I thought it was my network  but it the phone am telling you I have both phones an samung 22 ultra is a beast it like a computer an phone I still do t know everything about it it going to take time because there wayyyyy. To much features  YouTube is better everything is better iPhone will be number 2 great phone but samung won this time an I am a Apple fan guy have everything of Apple from Mac pro max to airpod max trust my review it not biased like these two
You did not give splitscreen a chance? Than what do you want more ram for? Where is repairability? Where is the impact of both OS in the world? And you guys also thought iphone screen is better than S22 ultra? 😂
you picked up the biggest apple fanboy to represent android, no doubt who is gonna win?
Android is freedom...Apple is like being in jail
Now I'm very confused, which phone I should buy ?
Sorry guys Samsung phone for me everyday💪💪
Tbh nobody is a winner  It all depends on the individual choice  In my case i want my device to be customisable to my interest not myself customised to the  device  So android is my choice
i am not kidding iphone is 80 percent samsung is 20 percent
Call me back when the iPhone can run programs like Tasker and KWGT
Hate apple, will never get another.  Too many restrictions.  No emulators on store, can't just download free mp3 music whenever you want like android, stupid apple ID, etc.  There is workarounds but I am not fooling with all that crap.  Also, there is no cast button on websites when I watch movies on chromecast but there is on my android.  Guess you can buy a lightning cable to connect to tv but then you can't use phone while watching movies like chromecast.
MKBHD after receiving a huge pile of money from apple and hosting event in California and saying apple is the best all others are shit.
I didn't mind both of you because you voted base on your choices. I wonder how a single family beat the hell out of Extended family.  I have one question to ask :  Why it's that many Average Phone Users find it difficult to operate like 50% to 60% of Iphone features ?.
🐐x🐐
I switched to iphone 12 with a flagship Android i already own..Not a single photo I had taken that i can say iphone has captured better and once the night mode photo just blew my mind and I cursed myself that why I had invested 50000 rs on this crap.  You guys didn't talked about tranfer of data . Actually I use it a lot. Buying an iphone means I have to invest 1lac rs for a macbook to tranfer my data.what a shit!! Only One positive thing about iphone i see is its speakers..they are not flat and loud..they have some kind of base in it..apple is just an arrogant company which think people will buy it's products just to show an apple logo in mirror selfies apple owners are good at only those things 😃
Come ooon guys, you really went a bit rough on Android there.. I've been using Android for almost the last 9 years until I eventually decided in last year’s September to get the iconic iPhone 13, and am not regretting my decision to be honest ( well, maybe not much) but I still really miss lots of things that Android has such as missing what freedom really feels like. Dude, the ability of using any 3rd party device like watches, TV's etc.. so perfectly & full-features as well as the ability of charging anything using only one cable (usb-c) and the fact that apple lacks these stuff cannot be just ignored, like seriously you cannot act like naaaah it’s not a big deal. Also the split screen feature man.. I really miss this it was a huge thing for my daily use, the ability of multitasking was a game changer for me and mark my words, when apple does it people will go crazy about it! And yeah one last thing, the fact that I cannot go past 5 days in the call log to search for calls in MY phone that uses MY account which holds My info still makes me sick till this day.. I know that apple did it on purpose due to privacy stuff and props to them for giving privacy an important role in their approach, but every time I go to my call log looking for a number then I remember that I can’t do this on ios I go wondering what in the flarking hell they smoke in apple 😅. Still a great phone though, I am really pleased with my Iphone 13, it’s a great phone after all, but as I said you went a bit rough on Android guys though I really enjoyed this collab a lot! Keep up the good 👍
When I put music on... I phone drains more than Android... Even iPhone isn't so loud as Android
This is dumb....comparing ios with with android is fair enough but your not doing that.
Can you create  same video with middle class family.  Apple is more costly  . it's  not budget  friendly.  If you want to buy a phone for showing then apple is fine. When 5 year finish of apple phone then apple stop support of install  / update  apps from apple store.  Like this year apple stop update for iPhone 7. Then added limitation for install new apps. Means your phone is garbage.
The Bias of the guy on the left is literally 'streaming live'
To sum everything up iPhone is only good for I messenger and FaceTime that's the only reason why they so far ahead
Only 8k video can shoot by samsung.but, not in iphone.. So,  Samsung video quality is better the iPhone if you shoot in 8k..
Apple "won" most of these is because of how incredibly versatile Android is. There is no one kind of Android device. Some are dirt cheap entry level phones while some are cutting edge.
Lets discuss and compare both phones, then give all the points to iphone 🙄
I have never in my life faced the issue of phone not saving a clicked photo even on the old Nokia Symbian phones. That was really controversial remark by MKBHD.
This would be good in YouTube Rewind
Marques has been looking like an Apple ambassador for a while. All his videos now are EVs, Apple products and ocasionnally a Samsung/pixel phone. He does not review any new different phone lately.  Samsung literally makes almost all the screens on the market, including iPhones, but iPhone ties just because it's flat?
In the U.S., iPhone is a clear winner, but in many places Android is much more competitive.
Samsung phones are nearly impossible to take apart and repair. It's truly horrible. iPhone wins big time there.
I love Android but when you see how bad Google is doing with their own phone, when you see how Samsung can even offer more support than Google itself, is just sad. Rest in peace Nexus!
very biased vid.
biased.
shitPhone 13
This is a view from the us market, the reality is that the world already chose Android above Iphone, meaning most of the reasons why people on the us think Iphone is better, does not apply Al around the world
This is kind of apple commercial
So apple gave lock screen widgets with some customization and suddenly it's "the thing". Credit should be given to those who came up with it, of course Android, 6-7 years ago. The new features that he is sold on in iPhone are the same features that I am tired of using for years on my Galaxy devices. Another iSheep.
I m using iPhone 12 but i l also wanna buy an Andrroid 。anyone can recommennd？
HOW MUCH DID APPLE PAY YOU 🤔 😳 😕
Iphones are simple to use so suit children and people who want easy phones android is alot less restricted and far more technical but way way superior!!!! What a ridiculous conclusion these 2 have come too !!!
You forget that Apple is highly restrictive. For instance you can't download mp3 files on iphone, but you can on Android. That's a big issue for me since I download a lot of mp3 files.
Dude ask him even things that arent in mthe iphone he will still say iphones better at those too XD
That dude is an isheeo fan boy XD I mean such useless arguements.
U guys loose me on 1st point. S22 ultra has far more better display than iphone
So why buy an android phone it iPhone is good at everything?
I knew it ever since I got my first iPhone 😌
There is absolutely no way you give the gorilla glass victus on the s22 ultra a .5 That's downgrading.
I rest my case !! 🍎 👑 long live apple
Apple lose in phones since years of non-real development ! Ok, Let's do some heavy marketing. I love both of you, but this time I feel no honesty in this.  Most comments agree with me .  ❗❗❗❗
The iphone 13 max is better than your lower tier android. Big surprise there. Next time compare flagships against flagships please.
Samsung has best tech. But in terms of user experience, UI and quality of features. iPhone wins hands down. My opinion of course. But even the photos seem glossier and off better quality to me.
Come on guys you forget the most important feature privacy. I will never use an Android phone as I don't trust Google sorry.
You forgot usbc and storage per dollar 💵
A collab of legends we knew we needed, and finally got.
They are talking the language of gods
THIS IS AN IPHONE FANBOY COMMERCIAL
If Apple change to full screen, type c cable, I'll be rushing to get one. That's only thing stopping Android users like me not to change to iPhone.
the only difference really between apple and android comes down to look and OS, iOS has always been better and will always be better, Android OS is clunky and gross looking, compared to iOS which is a clean looking and amazingly smooth OS. in terms of look, me personally i like the look of iphone better, but andoirds look good too, samsung is a good phone manufacture but the shitty open source andoird OS is holding them back, they need to wake up and make their own OS BASED AROUND one phone. the reason apple has a huge advantage over samsung is OS, and whether you want to admit it or not iOS is better in every way. ive used both andoird and apple for a very long time, and i would never go back to andoird. but like i said, samsung makes good phone, but their OS is shit. its not about how good your camera is, or how long your battery lasts,  cause both phones has amazing battery life and great camera quality. so now it just comes down to who can pull off a more comfortable and clean looking phone with a good OS, and so far apple has been the only one to pull off a good OS.
👎👎👎👎👎
using both these phose . i can say s22 ultra wins without doubt . this video is biased . not a great genius like you two but knows whats running inside my phones, i can say iphone has no competition when compared to s22 ultra
Funny how MKBHD uses the Samsung for more than a year but yet gives all the credit to the iPhone. Lol
The dynamism of android isn't mentioned . And that's a big feature on it own, especially with the cameras!
I'm avid fan of both of these video content creators. I'm in South  Africa and I must say that I needed this video. Well done and thank you for sharing!
The one reason I find this video is biased cuz he gave equal points to both in customization section.. I wonder how tf one could justify that iphone have better customization 🤷
on iPhone you can't do a lot of usefull tings and apps.
With Android, you can do lot of things compare to iPhone with lot of limitations... Android is better.. make life easier... Btw I owned an iPhone 13 pro and midrange android, but most of time I'm with Android... If I have a flagship Android phone, I guess I will forget about that iphone... 😂
Bias video
well thats surprising that marques is not looking very comfortable in this video just a thought 🤣🤣
Isn’t apple far better for security then Samsung?
two of my favourite youtubers making some valid points but seriously. 7.5 to 1.5 😂😂😂😂 ill keep on using my Samsung and be happy.
iPhone user here, I have a 13 mini which lasts me all day with moderate use (if you consume loads of media do not get the mini haha) But yeah, usb c is a HUGE advantage to android. Overall I prefer iOS’s minimalism and the fact that it really ‘just works’ Love both systems, good to see them evolving over time. Tech is exciting man!
Lmäö what a shitshow
I haven't used Apple since iPhone 4 but if what I've heard about iPhone 14 (pro) is true, I might change from Android to Apple once again.
I came here and the view count was '3,444,222 views' 😄Insane!  This is a really great Smartphone OS & Comparison video! The best Tech reviewers in one room  🔥And... the length of the video is 20:22 lol
They're not even going to try to be fair to Android users.
Opinions from 2 primary iphone users. 👎
Very interesting. But I use both samsung s22 ultra and iPhone 13 pro. Still I prefer Android. When I use ios I ask myself is that it? But Android OS feels a lot bigger.
Track id of the 1st track?? 😭😭😭😭
I think this analysis is not that objective, you can't judge on "your feel" all the time.  iphone has never been that great to me, it's kind of sad but this show is biased.  Ask Chinese people if they would trade an state of the art Huawei for an iPhone....  Samsung is not everything Android has...  The guy only likes iPhones and he would praise them no matter what
Mkbhd wtf 😳…?
this is the most disguistingly biased comparison i've seen so far.
I loved this.....😂iphone fr d best
My wife had the Iphone 12pro max Sim card slot just stopped working it wasn't connecting to the cellular network  she traded it in for the 13 pro max I'm still enjoying my s21 ultra
I love you guys, but this video just doesn't make any sense to me. Most of what you guys called pros of the iphone aren't even popular here in Africa (I live in Nigeria). Here, people mainly use iphones because of the camera, and as a status symbol. Android has the largest share of the African market because they bring good features and customizability to low-earning customers without pulling them into an expensive ecosystem.   MKBHD is conspicuously biased towards Apple at this point, and I could see instances where Arun didn't quite agree, but probably didn't want conflict so he just conceded. The whole video seems impromptu and poorly planned to me. I don't think much thought was put into the opinions to make them as objective as possible.   The final score might have been more even than what you guys arrived at in this video if just one android phone was compared with one iPhone as displayed in the thumbnail.   Poorly executed opinion videos like this tend to be more divisive, further widening the apple vs android fanboy rift. Also, it doesn't help that you guys gave the verdict as "it all finally comes to the user's preference". That statement just makes the whole point scoring a useless act.
That 20% for recicled materials just goes to waste when you need a charger, case or the device to be repaired(that one is not so eco friend for apple)
You can get any result you want by asking the right questions. Just say'n
It's quite obvous why this comparsn is utterly biased & potentially useless in most cases: ♦ Apple ~= Premium only , Android = every tier ;  =>  this makes both groups incomparable in many ways, & with some approaches, notably those used in the video  ♦Android including the ↓ & ↑ end of the market, the average will depend on what MOST manufacturers do & possibly on what their market shares are, since they purposely chose to focus on the mainstreams to exclude some manuf like Fairphone, thus NOT on what Android is *Capable of* .   ♦When Android gathers all the specific models, either in hard or software, we could, most of the time, pick some better choices on the Andro side, if looking for specific features. This gets brushes away by the "average" argument, which makes no sense in term of buy perspective, as we're usually never looking for an "average of its OS bros' abilities" model, but for a "best at x, y, z" model. In which case, Andro wins in so many cases..  Including on the "overall" feature actually, as iPhone still have some specific drawbacks, that lower the overall features coverage, while what's used to pull down Andro is (again) the average of the market, obviously englobing the terrible options, & the bad ones at every specific criterias (we could find an Andro bad for every spec/criteria, while iPhone is bad at some stuff). So Andro could never shine in anything as a whole, whereas it shines at MOST if we pick the good ones + the best soft/apps solutions.  ♦ Many criterias not taken into account, so that where Apple has literally no option, Andro has no chance, again... I get the majority of use argument, but it's still biased & not fully pertinent when it comes to a comparison of what both ecosystems (hard + software, get me well) are capable of & best at, especially when there is a flagrant confirmation bias / Self-fulfilling prophecy between what reviewers talk about, & what normie-users know (if you never talk about x, no wonder most won't ever know it exists, & thus it will remain majoritarilly unused...).  ♦As we're on the Mainstream of mainstream, it's not surprising we get that kind of [actually] ridiculous take on eco-friendliness, not taking into account what many ppl righteously corrected, such as their policy/ jurisdictional propaganda concerning right to repair (Apple = Anti-Repair King), the dumped material reuse (impeachment), & other indirect consequences of their business practices; basically, all of what Louis Rossm. (& others I can't remember rn) tackles on his channel.  I'll keep it there, even though there could be few other points, but the idea would be the same, & the conclusion as unsurprising as peeving : we can't trust *advertisewers* , even though I still enjoy a part of their content, & still find they make nit points at some occasions (which is, surprising, in contrast).
First sponsored video by them both where the sponsor's name wasn't mentioned.
its so bright that its bright 🤣🤣
features are equal apparently.😂 Madd ting!  Suspicious takes.
There is no match for Android. Can't do anything on an iphone besides social networks.
did tim cook invite someone for dinner... bad rep...one sided...and I don't like google...samsung...
Arun: “It leaves a dent in my hand” (referring to iPhone screen edge.   How hard are you gripping your phone?!
iPhone camera with only 12 mpx in 2022 is just pathetic. You are not allowed to pinch and zoom iPhone photos.
Dude seriously? 2.5/7.5??? common, you know that's not fair. To say that's only because of personal choice, i lost my interest
Y como pueden apreciar, claro ejemplo de un iphonelovers 🙄
I Definitely lost alot respect for this channel for not keeping it real
The black guy is bias and you let him take over your show 😂
I can't imagine myself going back to an iPhone.
For me this all boils down to one thing: I simply prefer Android due to it being more open and more customisable.
Black guy is obviously bias lmao
I must say that it was a little too much subjective in my opinion 😅
What about security
The video is much biased towards apple. Apple also has app crashes but that's not mentioned. Multitasking in Android is way better in Android. I wished there would be an honest comparison from you guys. You guys try different Android phones and then compare with iOS (whose OS is only used in apple) so different platforms of Android may be having some issues but it doesn't make Android lose against iOS.
Had the iphone 13 pro max n rn have s22 ultra which I love but I miss the smoothness of ios n the battery life on it might go back idk
Trash comparison. Android vs Apple cannot be compared by hardware vs hardware, if you're going to averaging Android specs is unfair as it covers so many more devices designed for different demographics and should be limited to compatible devices.   Android vs iphone should be a software argument and what you can do with it.
There is a lot of features really Android is far ahead than Apple. The call from a dual sim. The ESim with iPhone really sucks. You don’t have an option to select the sim to call from if the contact is not saved. Basically it won’t ask you for which sim to call if the call came from a contact not saved in your iPhone. There are much features iPhone designers have not thought of yet. iPhone is real waste of money
You guys are just shitting on androids coz you favour i phones
Ask an American and the answer is "Iphone is better". Couldn't watch past the Software Features section. Do others also feel that this video is biased ?
I find both Android and iPhone being competitive. iPhone is just a perfect device which is good for using what they provide. However Android is no where near stable. We have sooo many varieties in Android that we cannot even track them on a sheet. That's an advantage as it provides more options. Customisation is just the thing for Android users. iPhone is all about stability. Just don't compare them as their leagues are different.
I prefer iPhones but prefer Android tablets.
you said bettER performance stop americanasing your pronauciation
20 solid minutes of paid Apple advertisement. Sad to see you guys going down this path.
BS video, really biased against Android.
if you are using Android to watch this video say hi
In short, if Apple is the Empire and Android is the Republic, @MrWhosetheboss and @MKBHD are the Jedi who got a taste of the dark side.
The fact that I can plug my s22 ultra into my computer and drag and drop files, videos, pictures, movies, shows, etc to and from the phone with ease over not being able to do that with an iPhone makes Samsung (android) the easy pick for me
So Biased. Probably Apple sponsored lol
Some of y’all just can’t see the plus sides of iOS, huh?
A couple of juggernauts collaborating.  Good stuff.
This video seems a bit bias towards apple, on the battery factor, like you guys said, it is a matter of preference, but you still gave a point towards apple.  And how can apple even win software supports over android, android can literally get anything you want into your phone from anywhere, like by transferring apk files via usb cable, download from websites or direct from apps like play store, whereas apple doesn't have an official way to install software outside of the app store, when the varieties of apps that are listed in the app store is also far from android in quantity, where customers will have less choices on the apps.  Also, in software features, you said only small amount of people cared about those minor features in android, where apple has features that a lot of people use, but the thing is, similar to my points above, android could have all the features or apps that you mentioned to be important to many people in apple, but on the other hand, apple couldn't do the same, those apps like imessage or facetime is not an unique feature for iphone only, you can find tons of similar apps that would do just the same in android.
I only owned one iPhone at one point and been using android since and I prefer android for so many good reasons this is also coming from someone who likes to tinker with computers/raspberry pis so the similar software experience/ usability is a must for me.
Omg, just try copying a file on iOS. 😆
Paid riview???
I am sorry, but this discussion appears silly. 😂  Once you experience the freedom of Android , you will never be able to use Apple.  Apple traps you in their ecosystem, charges you by the neck for simple things like a fast charging adapter, limits hardware compatibility to the best third-party hardware in the market.   For those who do software development or technology architecture, It's like getting trapped in a single-company software stack like from Microsoft vs the freedom to choose the best-in-class products in an open-platform like Linux.
Such an unfair comparison.
Even without going through the video, we all know the answer. Android beats iOS hands down in every aspect. But no one can argue with fanboys.
Actually I loved Aron alot but you guys are clearly going for iOS clearly iOS I hear battery and you guys are choosing iOS seriously who thinks iOS for battery 🔋🔋🔋
So these two are just here to endorse iPhone  lol
Android Is way better.  I got z fold 3 I can't have a regular phone anymore  lmaoooo
Silly to say android doesn't win customization, you still can't put an app anywhere you want on an iPhone. Android also supports emulators and downloading 3rd party apps. Huge advantages for me personally
Lol iphone fanboys arguing how an iphone is the best.. not a very good gauge of which is better
Camera on the Ultra is Wayy Better, then the Pro Max period. Same with the customization and the features.
The feature he mentions that android doesn't have are on Android just with different names.. airdrop is not on android because we call it nearby share quick share.. FaceTime isn't on android but samsung has a dedicated video chat between smasung.. or even duo if you want to video apple..the list goes on.. I feel like I'm watching to apple fan boys just shit on android because they are not aware if other android softwares.. the video seems bias.
Here we go again....the age old android vs iphone which is better argument. Nobody comes on top in this one
Very nice  video
Hahahha  for content iphone is the best
Is anyone shocked by this? Most of the upper range/popular tectubers are low key 🍎  fanbois. Especially MKBHD. I dunno, I don't follow them closely-mostly for that reason.
I feel like nobody knows how amazing androids are for example you can download litterady anything for free modded games for free like unlimited money and the fnaf franchise is freeand minecraft is free but there apk but there the full games and the newest updates  bit yet theres a ton more good and amazing things about androids that i cant list but in my opinion  androids are better
If you compare averages every time, it would not be fair, since cheap Android Phones certainly don't have every feature. You cannot compare a Motorola g41 (250€) to an iPhone 13 Pro (1.149€) You would have to compare the Flagships here like the newest Samsung (1250€) and other Phones. Saying you always take the average and therefore deciding only shows that you have the option to buy the features you need. Another comparison would be to compare the best Android Phone in a specific category to the iPhone. There, Android would win. This comparison is the exact opposite of your approach. While both approaches ask the same questions, they manipulate the statistics in favor of one side. A good comparison can only be made if you get the target of both systems. Apple wants over all average results, while on Android the quality and quantity of features differ massively throughout the available Phones. Average Android (comparing all price classes, android vs high-end iPhone) iPhone wins. Comparing best features vs one iPhone, Android wins. Comparing high end vs high end, it really is a draw.
I will always use android, at least as long as you can only install apks there
I very much enjoyed this collab and video concept as a whole! I think that back in 2017 or so, there was definitely a lot that high-end Android phones had going for them for the same price, especially in terms of customization and freedom of playing around with both the hardware and software (hardware in terms of storage mostly, back when phones had small initial storage and all Android phones had SD card slots while iPhones started at 16 or 32gb and were limited to that).  I think that back in the day, if I had a bunch of money to spend on a phone, I would have definitely bought a Galaxy S7 or S8 over the equivalent iPhone. Nowadays, if I have $900 to spend on a phone, I'd definitely just get an iPhone 13 over any Android phone. It's just a very consistent experience, the hardware of the phone is the prettiest to me of any phone out there, the battery and storage went from shitty in comparison to best in class and the camera experience and quality is still unrivaled. Also, lack of customization is no longer an issue on IOS, with widgets and all sorts of workarounds to personalize the home and lock screens.  Android still proposes way better value, though. I'd still recommend anyone with $400 to spend on a phone to get a Poco F3 over an iPhone SE. But I'd say the latest iPhone is the overall best smartphone for me these days.
Haha when they showed the s22 ultra for the first time (in the video) it was 69% charged
So far so good, I love the debate, not android phone and apple phones are great. stop been bias and accept the fact. And remember, both phones has it own unique features, pick any of your choice and enjoy the product!
Apple paid a lot to brownee
Wait until Tim Apple gives always on display on the iphone 15 pro  it will be the greatest thing ever
I like the take of browny here arun is totally an isheep so narrow 😑
One day I will once again buy and Android as I used to switch between them. Though older I am, the more I'm rooting for iPhone. Reliability and stability of these devices is insane. Also I'm year by year more into the ecosystem and I don't feel like I could pull back from the airdrop, iCloud functionalities like copy paste between devices or iMessage. Very subjective but I'm for iPhone for sure.
apple is 👑
if you're an isheep, iphone!  if you're a robot, android! 🤣 period
One sided win.
S22 ultra screen is way better, not a huge fan of the curve but the display refresh rate, brightness, resolution is much better
i ❤️ your videos they are so great i never miss your videos this video is really usefull
I'm surprised myself of how much battery life I got out my Pixel 3xl, it's still going strong, can't say that for my iphone 6s I changed the battery for a apple oem in 2019 and it's already unhealthy.
I've seen mkbhd give phone of the year to galaxy multiple times, including last year, hell he's even using a galaxy now lol.  So I don't get why he's saying iPhone is much better 🤔
Markus said:  "If the performance is great but you can't play the game is it a great performer?" That's me about every MacBook or iMac
Huge biased video…I think the video should be called ANDROD VS IPHONE (MARQUES OPINION)
Android Clip board copy (Samsung) copy something on one phone it appears on the other device (ex. tablet) . Nearby Share (android)same link airdrop. Connect 4 devices to Bluetooth at the same time. On the plane, at home we have our onw silent DJ party :). Just way too many features. Android messages, Duo(rest of the world thou) Multitask
I would buy iphone if they changed to no more notch or better notch. It's annoying watching full screen vid.
The rest of the world is Android dominated . So who's the minority now !? 🤔
It would be more advantageous for the Androids in this comparison since Android have more phones to compare to so they can just use the best features of each of the best phones of it to go against Apple 2 single latest released. And Apple still won hands down. And there are some people still saying that this video is biased. I don't even know what to say.
Oh man! this is where a dislike count would have given android some justice to this very biased review. As definitely there would have been more dislikes given than likes for this video.
damn iphone with great battery? what did i miss?
The 2 kings collab 🤴🏿 🤴🏾
Why no one mentioned it iphone pro is how bulk it is? So heavy and thick so you should hold it two hands? Ppl are too generous to iphone
Everytime I think about getting an iPhone one of their fans turn me off. "We have video calling" ... Bruh
Eco consciousness. .... Then androids don't count that specialize? Because there's only one iphone. That's silly
This was advertised by Apple for a fee
I'm an Android user for years now and especially a Motorola fan ...I use the phone most for social media,music, photos and YouTube sometimes... I don't play games and I don't read books on my phone..I'm thinking of changing from Android to iPhone .. Any opinions?Thanks...
Let's just say iPhone is good.
They both can create a mobile company where customers chooses their specs and their company will build it. Just like we do with PCs
I can smell the curry
Smart Android users already can see their score! even if YouTube takes away the dislike count! only 200K likes out of 3.4M views that should speak the truth 😂
Felt like Mkbhd had been paid by apple. Apple is so greedy and none of their products are upgradable. Everything is glued to the motherboard.  no memory upgrades, no headphone jack and they give all the lame excuses and andriod phones are following apple
Both of you have done videos in the past, comparing and reviewing apple and android products.    Like,   ~ MKBHD has given best phone awards to android devices in last year also.   ~ You have compared S22 ultra with iPhone 13pro max and results was more or less to be a tie in the match.   ~ In One of your video regarding the camera of vivo X80pro, you have mentioned that every new vivo device gives 4 or 5 extra features. Viov is just one player in the market and camera is just one app. If one app can give  4 to 5 new features, imagine how much new features are coming out of the box in the whole android system?   There are a lot other instances in your old videos which clearly states android devices have much better performance, features and some better photography skills when compared with iPhones. Yet this video has gone completely blind towards all of that. The scores were absolutely ridiculous.   So @Mrwhosetheboss as a viewer what should I believe?? Is the content of this video is true?  If you say the content of this video is true, then most of your contents in old videos will be a lie.
A great explainer on why a LOT of people, who don't watch phone tech channels on YouTube, buy iPhones.
android phone some time lag but not too much heated up but iphone heated up but do not lag i have s21ultra experience
The draws should be points to straight to Android imo
USB c is the only thing stopping me from going back to Apple to be honest.
You totally lack the fact that Android has more wider ecosystem such as folding display devices, TVs etc. Utterly biased discussion and useless. Two Apple fanboys trying to convince each other that they are right.
The thing that makes android phones good is you don't need to spend much for a well spec phone.
you forgot NR1 THAT EVERYONE CARES ABOUT..  PRICE AND HARDWARE...  THAT IS  WHY HUAWEI IS ALWAYS WINNER WHY WASTE 1400dollars on APPLE WHEN YOU CAN BUY HUAWEI WITH 1000x better hardwares and prirce for only 200dolllars. welcome to NOT APPLE WORLD.. -.-
Whatever you say, iphone sucks because it doesn't give you the same level of freedom that android gives...
2 biggest influencers of the Mobile Phone industry.
🙂Why Do U Guys Lie So Much Literally I Like Your Videos 😄But How Can You Lie That I Phone Battery And Charging Is Better Than Android.Everyone Knows That I Phone Is Worst In It🙂
Just think about it fire wire connections on the outside right USB-C connections on the inside so if any oil or grease or anything like that it’s on the inside of the wire it’s gonna get hot and it’s probably gonna catch on fire that’s why I say I don’t know what you are talking about USB-C is a lot more dangerous than the fire wire and so why are we just putting fire wire and everything else and said a USB-C
I would rather see everybody else convert to fire wire than USB-C for safety reasons
Its like intel and amd, Intel is iphone and amd is android. Intel has less cores then amd, but those less cores perform better then more cores cause they are better quality
the one that rubbed me the most, was. the 20% recycled by apple. LMAO. But they also like to sell you everything in new boxes as a separate purchase. also the charger, nah we got our own so you cant just use the same one your other devices use. So in the end, they cause more damage to the environment than anyone else.
If I had an Android and iPhone in a room and two choices, I'll choose the Android twice
15:37 when you see it...
Display Is a Draw? Seriously Guys? It should be Samsung All Day if you are being Honest
Thank you guys!  Personally, yeah, I'd love to have the new ProMAX. To me it is a very high quality and a absolutely sublime product. BUT, the biggest problem for me is the "restrictiveness" (for a lack of a better word) I'll experience having it, without the rest of the Apple Eco system. I don't have a Apple TV, I don't have a Apple Watch, I don't have a Apple I-Mac or MacBook. This is the difference for me when it comes to Android. I can use my Samsung Watch 4 basically on any Android phone of my choosing. I think it is a important factor which you you might have overlooked, interconnectivity and compatibility. And yeah, Im also still on my S21U. Apple, have you heard of USB C?? Android has....... Just my thoughts. Thank you for the vid guys!
iPhone is always winning if we're looking at the tippity top point. But Android always has great value for money.
Arun what phone do you use
first one, android is better. but i like the iphone more, so its a draw :D
Going into 6.30 mins.... clearly  go forward and dont watch the rest of the shit.. camera of iphone? really?
In video : iphone wins In comments : Android 😅
There is nearby share in almost all Android in present to compete tye airdrop and it works flawlessly 99% of time
Multitasking question including iPhone? What multitasking on iphone?!
Never trust 💯  percent on these youtubers
I find this video very entirely baseless. It cannot be iPhone vs android. If it's iPhone it should be compared to an equivalent phone in pricing and performance. If you do iOS vs android, It should only compare the software part of it. The hardware doesn't count.
Personally I think all iPhone users should thank the Android phone users for bringing out new features - both in functionality and design. If Android phones were not innovating, Apple wud continue to sell the same make and look iPhone models even to this day like the ones they sold in their yester years!!!   Oh wait - they look the same, more or less..🤣🤣🤣
Using iPhone since 2015 but I have discovered Xiaomi for me is better 😍
I prefer samsung because there's so much custom stuff
This doesn't make sense becuz you're tryna compare one phone to a WHOLE OS meaning the bad Android phones are lump with the good ones and you cant really judge meanwhile with Apple you only judging one phone
From your videos, I've noticed most of your comparisons are bias, it favours iPhones most times, and other YouTubers don't do that.. you should do better...
Wait so they had a convo about assistants and google was better and android stills didn’t get the point how?
iPhone is a BMW/merc Android is a Honda or Hyundai
Stopped watching when they agreed that ios has more features than androids cause it has facetime and iMessage lmao, bruh there's Google dual, smart messaging on Android, y'all just apple fan boys, I mean there's dual space, split screen, floating windows, and loads of other features! man says apple customisation is close to android? You clearly haven't used a Xiaomi phone ever, cus my iPhone is NOWHERE near that. This man picks Snapchat, tiktok and Instagram pictures over natural pictures of android because he feels "only android natural pictures are better than that of iOS" really bruh???..the comparison is bias bro, you picked someone who feels s21 ultra is better than s22 ultra just because the phone vibrates louder than s22 ultra?? ..  please....
I respect your opinion even tho i find it wrong. I have used a lot of different phones and have talked to a lot of "fanboys" and users of both Anroid and IOS. And i see Android as a clear winner. All iphones i have used have been really buggy, laggy and drains battery like a waterfall, and just a pain in the ass to use or integrate with other systems. And you say customization is better on iphone? on android you can legit change EVERYTHING. Oh you dont like where a setting is? move it? You dont like the color or look of something? change it. I worked at IT for a couple of years and integrating Apple products to anything other than apple just doesnt work properly. And an "old" android works so much better than iphone. Seems like iphones just age ALOT faster. I can see positives with apple. but i think i doesnt even come close to android. just imo
APPLE PAID PROMOTION , ATLEAST UR RICH 💩👎
Apple FanBoy
So we have a clear answer here :)
So we have a clear answer here :)
MKBHD: The best team is usually boring to watch *The Warriors have entered the chat*
How you guys left out Sony in the comparison beats me.
15:28 😂😂😂
One plus is better than Samsung .
Almost felt like an Apple Promo
I use both android and apple. Android is being backed by Google and Iphone is running with their own apple ecosystem. Google needs to improve to enhance the productivity in android smart phones.
Is it really Apple to Apple or Apple to Orange comparison?!🤔
Samsung is the best
So somebody’s recently tearing apart the new iPhone 13 and none of the parts are compatible so that’s kind of BS for iPhone
Sorry that’s not entirely true if you take a photo on an android it’s automatically uploaded to your Google Drive or pictures
Excellent content
Apple should be best value because Samsung high end phone are higher than iPhone price 😁😉😉
Lmao this comment section is full of crying android fans
i dont agree, but this is my opinion, just quality of ihpone is not what people say, iv stumbled on so much trash iphones that can last me a life time, for now im sticking with android !
My biggest issue with Apple is the mobile tethering
Better Is 100% subjective. It’s what’s better for the person so this video is trash.
Man,  these guys are  from the NAs/Europe  . For sure they are Apple user. It really depends the geographical situation. If you look at the other region,  there are vast majorities are using androids,   regardless of which brand. It's because it's not expensive af , android have variety of choices to choose from, and yeah android is much more user friendly . For example,  take Samsung pay for instance , its an NFC , unlike Apple pay, and yes this payment method is only available in certain Western countries. Dont get me wrong, I'm kinda disappointed in this video, and yes , people will say " He's been paid by Apple " coz of the way he commented . And please do not disregard the fact that, Androids charge faster the iPhones,  and he himself said, " I don't mind if my phone battery depletes fast if I can fast charge it " 😉  all In all, this is just one opinions on which did better, so it doesn't concludes the verdict.
My honest thoughts regarding this video!!!  It's been years since I started watching both of your videos. I think by now I kinda know how you guys judge phones. But for me after watching this video, I felt you guys were heavily biased towards iPhone. Especially Marques who seemed like he had some tie-ups with Apple. If iPhone is the best phone in the world, why don't I see him award the best phone of the year to iPhone? (FYI, He awarded S21 Ultra the best phone last year). Anyway, that's my opinion on the video.
so why isn't the best in class from Android being compared to the best in class iphone... compare in terms of battery with rog in terms of photos vibo or s22 ultra and charging vivo vook and they all beat iphone  this is just bs
It's their opinion
I have been using android and linux distros for years now...even though I used Apple products in the work environment...still I will never buy them on a personal level.
Idk if i am the only person feeling that this video is way too biased towards apple. No offense
Alternative title:Marques Brownlee gets paid by Tim Cook to simp for Apple.
Without seeing the video I am preety sure the conclusion is 'it really  depends on your preference and comfort'. Nothing new here.
Do Ronaldo vs Messi next🌚
Hey I feel apple paid them. I am sorry. I will be the most happy person if I am wrong about this. Guess we will never know.
iphones are nowhere near as reliable as you think, I work at a phone store and like 95% of people with issues are iphone users part of it is there are more iphones out there but constantly iphones seems to have more issues than Andriods
Apple thank you is OBVIOUSLY better😎😎😎😎
What a biased take, anything Samsung was better at like the screen was down played and anything the iPhone was good at was over exaggerated. From this comparison you would think think the iPhone is 5 times better, and that's a shame coming from these guys who should know better.
Most of the remarks at the battery section is totally wrong  And I cannot complete the video   As Per Gaming experience, dude! I used to like totally believe you but you're really wrong
the type c should have definitely split the eco point that went to the iphone in half - that was a bit unfair
the other guys is literally saying whatever he wants and mrwhoosetheboss is just agreeing
Android gives me Linux vibe and apple just gives me apple vibes,
there is no comparison between android and ios android is so vast and dynamic and flexible whereas ios seems to be static,it arrests you once you step into ios.. be it charging,sharing  i was shocked when i first noticed that i can’t share photos,files from my laptop through cable even iphone doesn’t support external hard disks… i realised that it was my biggest mistake shifting to iphone from android.. now i’m bound to iphone system..  you need to buy lots of accessories for iphone to do things but still not easily and smoothly… you must talk about this
As a OS, Android is better. But Android devices are terrible irrespective of which brand it is.. be it Samsung or Pixel (except amazing camera) or anything.... IPhone on the other hand makes exceptionally quality device even though it's OS isn't as feature-full as Android..... Of course iOS' security is way better. Overall, I was Android fan for long long time, but after realising I have spent way too much money on devices, now I am comfortably an iPhone user. Practically it's perfect.
ഒന്നു പോയെടാ. നീ എങ്ങോട്ടാ പുകഴ്ത്തി പോണത്.
Video made by someone paying you, unacceptable result  ￼
I was a huge apple fan and had several of their products over many years. I shunned anything Android. Until I had to use one. I'll never buy another iPhone again.
the i in iphone stands for idiot refering to the owner who was dumb enough to buy it in the first place.  there is so many vids on yt showing how they try too cheat you. updates that slow your phone. lies on the support site and says you cant retrieve your data if not backed up.erases lady and bans her for saying she can do it 95% of the time in her store. inkompentent workers who doesnt know how to repair the produckt. only test which printerplate needs too be changed. new screws in every product, no spareparts for old phones. and with the new iphone 12 you cant even switch cameras on 2 new phones without them not working proberly. would u contiue to buy stuff in a store that cheats and manipulates you.. then you must be an I diot. i wouldnt even take apple products for free if i had to use them. crappy menus and bad reception on the iphone. why do they make it seem that you have a 100 % power when u only have 90%(see test). misleading dont buy their crap.unless u like people who cheats you and tell u misleading stuff.
apple sponsored video 100%
iPhone wins to me, but everyone has their own opinions.
If you are collaborating with apple say it don't underestimate the features on android phones.  It have great battery . Always on display  Split screen Best screen  High customisation than fucking iphones   If you are collaborating with apple say it .  Fuck iphone
Anyone who thought who’s was biased… go cry me a river
Lol
I like reliable budget phones and I found the best one is the iPhone if you get one that is a year or 2 old. I am also a bland user though.
I loved how biased this video was like when aron compared iphone to samsung in camera samsung demolished apple but no now we are in apple hq and we must be biased
I switched to iphone recently. I've never regretted a spending decision more in my life. I absolutely hate it in almost every conceivable way.
Me just wondering how Mr.Arun Maini achieved 10A in GCE O/Levels and 4A at  the Advanced Level 🤔 🙄 😀 😅  This guy is truly incredible,  being able to earn £20,000 at the age of just 14 is a Marvel on its own.......Well done, Sir
If im gonna choose, i still pick Samsung Over iphone... no doubt
This video was brought to  you by apple ....
This video was SO rigged to favor iPhone.
Like I want to know, is this Video Sponsored By Apple or what? And for the Reminder, I love MKBHD but he is always an iPhone Guy.

I think personally, iphone is better but I do love Samsung more, if Samsung would just adopt a fast air drop, and a good I messages, and a friendly camera with ALL apps and not different camera qualities for all apps I'd love it. If Samsung also had a cool design with the lock screen and home screen that'd be cool
Had 2 androids, both crap.    Had several iPhones. No issues really.
I actually use split screen, and pop up a lot for Samsung, it comes in handy with things I do
The Comparison is too biased in favor of IPHONE
Iphone def does not get eco conscious .... Just cause you used recycled materials, doesn't make it eco friendly..... The devices themselves along with the associated eco system make them the least carbon neutral ecosystem. Tws products are terrible for the environment.....
one brand vs over a thousand brands over the world, even it loses, it is still a hero.
guys hold on take it from me .. everything is better on Android except camera on snapcat .. thats it basically  ..  good bye 😂
Marques Voice + Arun's Voice is like the best and coolest lullaby ever. 😅 Nice seeing you guys again in one Video. 💪  Its better to enjoy the best of both worlds tho. I always have Android for daily tasks and an Iphone. 👌
I love your videos Aaron and get excited every time you upload but this is the first time I disliked your video. This is so biased towards apple that it literally bleeds through the screen. all those points in the video that you mentioned are all in favor to apple except the price maybe, and  also, marques's opinion are way too subjective, they should've never been here in the first place, like cmon, he likes vibration mode more so he choses an old phone? or he likes to have his hand cut off by the edges of the phone??? then he says that the split of a second that the camera takes to open up affects the camera rating of all android devices? not to mention him not being able to press the shutter button properly to then complain it didnt save the photo... like cmonnnnn... his answers/ratings were not objective at all, so his presence in this video didnt seem like a great idea... much love and peace tho
iphone is overall better, thank you come again
Lets be real..Samsung is better…
wow that quick awkward moment when Marques almost went into a vacuum after the high five with the bro-fist hahaha.
Awesome video
An iPhone doesn't deserve that 1.5 point from earlier. Mr whose the boss forgot to mention a floating window A lot of people like me  prefers floating window to split screen and an iPhone has none
How about iPhone vs Google Pivel 6 Pro.? I will tell you how it would go. iPhone would blow the doors off of the Pixel. The Pixel is going downhill. Pixel locks up and loses signal for no reason. The iPhone just works. Pixel just breaks.
IOS 16 is gonna make the iphone the best phone in the world by a fair margin. It already is but it’s missing a few things that android has been doing for awhile but in IOS 16 apple will pretty much fix all that. So yep when IOS 16 drops, it will make the IPhone the best smartphone in the world 10 fold.
Wtf?!
Amazing how people can switch tunes in less than half a decade
How apple comes against all these Android brands and still wins is huge
USB c, no iTunes, no apple ID, being able to video chat with people who don't have the same phone as me, not loosing features because someone doesn't have an iPhone.. Honestly, just look at what phones these two guys are using.
There is no comparison of a Multipurpose tool with a plain screwdriver. Samung always win and Iphone will be soon a history just like Nokia  and Blackberry very soon, just mark my words.
I hate this interview that guy is so biased
My phones battery is so bad that it actually takes longer to charge than the amount of use I get out of it, if I was to have it continuously on until it died….
That guy doesn't use android that's why he's so biased
and I changed to Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra after using iPhone 13 Pro Max for 6 months, worst 6 months of my life.
Cortana is windows btw.
MKBHD is the black Jake  Gyllenhaal! Bro you guys talk exactly the same, you even ha e similar facial features 😂 🤣
This is crap... 2.5 for Android really... MKBHD. Really
As a whole, Android. I currently use an iPhone 13 mini, but I’m constantly needed android apps on my old devices.  As messenger… iPhone. I need iMessenger to quickly communicate with friends and family. Even if the rest of the phone is lacking, I need to iMessage to communicate effectively with my children and coworkers.
battery award is that after they disable it after every update🤣😂
One of your worst videos so far, content wise :////
My biggest problem with this video (even more than giving so many wins to iPhones/iOS) is in the first 15 seconds.  "...we're just sat here thinking ..."  Noooooo, please no.  You're just *sitting* there thinking.  Why have people stopped using the present progressive/gerund forms of sit and stand, ie sitting and standing?  It drives me nuts and I've only noticed it in the last 5 or 6 years but it's more and more common.  "He was stood/sat there" makes him sound like an inanimate object that was physically placed somewhere by someone else.  You wouldn't do it for any other verbs, so why sit and stand?  If you think it's because they are static passive verbs/positions, well one, that's definitely not true (ask any quadriplegic), but two, you don't do the same for the most passive position available, reclining.  You would never say "He was lay there" (or lie), you would say "He was lying there" (or laying).
I absolutely disagree, as if there was such an evaluation because you love apple, iphone can in no way surpass Samsung in camera shooting, it takes incredible photos, video, normal photo, videos and similar things, its performance and battery performance are also good, I think Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra and iphone 13 pro max could be head-to-head. not that many shortcomings
Dudes if you had to make an Apple Ad just do it, but please dont trash android with this stupid "competition" there´s no way apple its better in ALL categories and the ones Android was better just did not count at all WTF
Biggest joke of 2022 iPhone is 10x better than assdroid
It seems like some of the things that made android different, the manufacturers are tilting more towards Apple now. Easiest thing to mention is sd cards. It was easy if you wanted to use an SD card, you went android, now, that's harder to find, so it's one less reason to pick android over apple. My biggest desires were customization, sd card and apps. IOS has more apps these days, customization & similar storage options. It won't be long before it doesn't matter which you pick, the product you get is the same and the only differentiator is brand/price point.
Got halfway through the vid thinking that MKBHD was biased towards apple to see that he uses a Samsung:/. For me android is preferable, used both apple and Samsung and prefer Samsungs operation software.
I don't like Apples Design.  And that's it.

I feel both Mkhd and Mr. Who's the boss are just lovers of Apple products. Which is not an issue with me or any other android users but they need to more fairer in terms of rating.
After watching this, it's difficult to see why mkbhd carries 2 phones anymore. He's clearly more of an apple products endorser now. He should just stick to the iPhone
I’ve gone back and forth between both, love the screens on Samsung phones way more than iPhones, love the freedom of Android, but I still choose Apple for the few reasons that are bigger than nitpicks, for support and longevity iPhone is unmatched and every Apple device talks to one another everything is in perfect sync from the watch to your iMac. And the speed is always very good. But honestly you can’t go wrong with either OS these days, phones are so good now it just comes down to what you like more mostly.

Bad video !  :  I like and subscribe to BOTH of you! By your own admission,  " tired " ," 24 hour day" , " not know what time it is". ...So, you weren't  able to properly & intelligently debate . Just agree. Why show up? Send a text message with " bullet points" .       MKBHD is swayed by Apple and can't see  the subtle flaws that persist. " waiting years for Apple to perfect a feature" equals " going without feature for years".     Switching :   OH, let's  put Apple up against  every android . Then , exclude certain brands of Android. Then, compare Apple to budget brands. Try addressing  flagship to flagship, mid tier to mid tier.     Vivo X80 - camera , Xiaomi- back notification screen.,  Apple Tax,  Fast Charging,  Customized user interface... the ability to CHERRY PICK android based devices for features.  Samsung Dex may be important to a group of consumers but certainly not to "top elite tech INFLUENCERS " ..Perspectives  not Gospels THERE  WAS  A WIDE  VARIETY  OF POINTS THAT REALLY DIDN'T  GET FULLY  DISCUSSED OR TOUCHED UPON AT ALL IN THIS CONDENSED  VIDEO - FOR WHAT NEEDED TO BE DEVELOPED....IT REALLY SHOULD  BE A :    " MINISERIES " or " 10+? Part SHOOTOUT "  Let's just face it ,  you are and are considered " ELITE  TECH INFLUENCERS".  BY the true meaning,  your separation from the average person and your intentions to push "certain narrative " makes you money, and therefore,  is biased.  Look at "the video cover shot " ,  size, color, ..it never was equal or unbiased...."INFLUENCERS  gonna INFLUENCE"
In what world is the iPhone display better than Samsung's. Please take this video down its misleading
I wonder how much Apple pays MKBHD
The union i lived to see,wipes tears,is this world peace
Fun fact is that both @Mrwhosetheboss and  @Marques Brownlee  use android phones, but still they give the point to iPhone. I guess they have already spent the sponsored money from Apple. 😂😂
MkBHD is an iPhone shill so not really a fair comparison. And he’s so boring. Idk how he got this big. You are better.
i bet apple paid good money for this video 😂
Android is winning, so I'll call it a draw.
The end result is an Android fan's nightmare; Always trying to evangelize Apple users into going for Android when they seem to be missing the point lol
:)
Luckily I get the best of both worlds however I can live without a android and I can not live with out an iPhone
I disagree with you guys on almost every point. I was a hard-core apple user for years. switched to Samsung at about model 6. stayed with it until iPhone 13. Switched to iPhone 13 plus. Had it for 6 months and had to switch back. The only feature that has an advantage over Android is FaceTime, or messaging videos. Using What's App eliminated that issue. will never go back. Especially with my Fold 3. I'm sure apple religious zealots will be outraged. lol
Yup!  I even have a new MacBook Pro with usb-c and i]an iPad Pro with usb-c.  Mean while my AirPods Pro and iPhone are lightning.  Stupid.  Thanks apple.
I stopped watching after I saw draw in display category.
This video is below belt. So many biases. Is like an apple sponsored video. Jokers
Seems pretty unfair to take the eco challenge and pit the galaxy vs the iphone, when in the screen comparison you compared the flagship iphone to android phones in general.
Mkbhd is biased
Both these guys are just apple fans..trash vid
Should have put a disclaimer for Apple commercial
This is like 2 GOATs collaborating... I was too excited to concentrate on the bias for Apple 😂
I was a huge fan of both of you guys but this video disappointed me a bit by underrating android over iOS. I know that the iPhone is a lot more secure than any Android phones but it's also funny that the iPhone doesn't have a fingerprint scanner which is available even in budget android phones.
A very unfair comparison you basically gave in to the Apple whenever the other guy said he preferred Apple. Just one very simple thing on the Android phones if you want to close your apps you have a button that gives you that choice Apple on the other hand couldn't be bothered, they would prefer the user to close all apps individually
I love this kind of adults conversation.Ohmy...✨✨✨
Lemme help y'all. Droid.
Now we can all see here that Marcus is an Apple fan boy.
This is the most bias video I have ever watched on YouTube to date.
Apple refuses to get rid of the Lightning Port and support the USB-C standard that Android Smartphones hugely are supporting.
This is a complete load of crap! Obviously, Marques is an iPhone fan boy. Love your notches  . . . Pathetic. Never had a single problem with a pic not saving, never ever.   Facetime is the same as Duo or Messenger. Basically everything the iPhone does can be done with an Android.  One thing iPhone does that Android isn't as good at, is privacy. That's basically it.  No, not really, the other category where Apple wins is updates.  5 years is great, though, not many keep a smartphone that long. Do they?  Love you guys, but c'mon. Be real!
I would really like to see something like this again
The Galaxy S22 Ultra allows you to wirelessly link up to your flat panel display or directly connect it to your PC to use it the Samsung Smartphone like a regular computer. You can't do sort of thing with the iPhone 13 Max Pro.
Highly biased video.
Sponsored by Apple.
Basically MKBHD's opinions, we want your opinion and only yours.  Like if you agree.
The best charger wire is usb-c, but the best phone, as seen in the video, are iPhones.
A great and entertaining watch by the two cool tech guys that tell it how it is...should do another collab soon! Just a question, how do you guys feel aboutnthe fact that now the EU is moving towards a common charger for smartphones and communication devices.? This leaves Apple at s somewhat disadvantage in terms of sales in Europe when you consider soon that you can purchase any other smartphone than Apple and be ablento use that one common charger!
Why ask an apple fanboy which phone is better? Yeah about a totally biased view!
The iPhone 13 Pro Max only has a 12 megapixel imaging sensor in it were as the Galaxy S22 Ultra comes with a huge 108 megapixel sensor in it. The more megapixel the imaging sensor hasyou will get upclose you can get without having to use the optical or digital zoom and the more detailed the image with be. I've taken some great picture's with my Galaxy S22 Ultra and the JPEG image's at 12,000x9,000 look just gorgeous.
I recently bought a s22 ultra for the camera. I love the fast charging and the ability to stop charging at 85% but the feel of iPhone is much better. s22 ultra is boxy and not very comfortable to hold in your hands, also doesn’t look very appealing in selfies. So I’ll probably be going back to iPhone in September.
You shouldn't beat yourself up too much about the lighting its very good here actually. Lighting all you need is a hard light and a soft light on the otherside (for what you are doing). But with editing, you can get away with a room light and mess with it to make it look nice, which is I am guessing what you did here. Anyways keep up the good work!
iphone cannot be used as a computer with a file system. Apple only gives you access to the Downloads folder which is insane. Try downloading a video and adding it to your camera roll.
I think MKBHD is promoting iPhone because he gives award for the best phone every year and he never gave one for iPhone and he still says iPhone is better how?
I've been an Android owner but since late 2021 I'm an iPhone owner. You aren't going wrong whether you choose a currently supported iPhone or Android assuming the Android is from a reputable manufacturer like Samsung or Moto. And admittedly, peer pressure is a factor. I made the switch to iPhone for my wife and myself partly because she asked for it after years of liking our iPads.
I don't know why they're choosing the iPhone over the pixel in camera cuz in cam battles iPhone loses the majority of the camera battles especially with the pixel
Urghh it's so hard to watch these apple fanboys trying to judge an android device. And MKBHD raving about iphone's battery doesn't know that the life span of iphone's battery is shit and dies just in over a year or maybe hardly 2.
u need to compare performance compare it with asus u want to compare battery life compare it with redmi. android has lot of type of phone u cant compare it only with samsung and some other phones. 1/6 just supponser from apple just do the true comparison.
Bruh this video is kinda biased coz the iPhone battery sucks and as a iPhone user I can vouch for that
I'm trying to watch this video with an open mind, regardless of the bad decision to blanket all Android OS devices and then compare them to a singular iOS device. But comparing Samsung Dex to iMessages may be the [redacted] thing I've ever heard from two people that I like. iMessages is incredible. And is also a part of a forced-ecosystem. Of course it's popular.
They're just bias.
This is just a pathetic Apple show. Draws Android is shitty...
Lol hella bias in this vid...
I use androids for downloading torrents lol
longest apple commercial I've seen yet
How about friendly-user?
MKBHD - ANDROID MRWHOSETHEBOSS - IPHONE
but speakar quality?
I want both. I’ll use android when I’m alone and I’ll use iPhone when I’m with the gang
The battery life of the iPhone is known to be very limited.
racist thumbnail😅😅😅
I don't agree with it
You forgot the disclaimer "sponsored by Apple". Bro iPhone is the internet explorer of the operating systems and phones. What android has iOS and iPhones get them 5 years later. Get outta here. Why games run smoother on iPhones? Maybe because the OS puts all the resources on the game and when you try to do anything else the phones breaks down.
Theyre both awesome phones. It just depends on the style you use the phone. Iphone is basic but solid, samsung is full of techs but sometimes extra
I am using a Samsung NOTE3 as I type this.
Apple fan boy😅😂
I do wish Android was more compatible with third-party apps like IG. I feel like that's a huge deal that needs to be addressed soon. Other than that, I prefer Android when it comes to EVERYTHING else.
MKBHB IS ALWAYS BIAS AND HE IS APPLE FAN, HE ALWAYS CHOOSES IPHONE FYI HE HAS APPLE WATCH ON.GET A NEUTRAL PERSON ON THIS BRO.
Its funny how wrong this video is portraid, android should have easily won many of these categories, but i guess it was in favour of ios
Freedom is more important than anything else. Android fr life
This video almost feels like an apple ad🤦🏿🤣
This seems like an extremely biased review and he made his guess "who is clearly an iPhone fanatic" drive this discussion too much. Ruining a potential great head to head review
iPhone is just simple and easy to use, but Android is way better. I use iPhone as I own a Apple Watch and MacBook (Apple makes it so easy to keep everything in synced). Regardless they’re both great.
To achieve natural look, you have to overprocess. What?
Most of these I agree with. Photography I think is a draw. It comes down to personal preference. Features I'd still give to Android though I get the appeal to Apple exclusive features
Need a better comparison .. seems like its based on iphones strengths
The best one is the one you prefer. Had both just prefer Android, can customose more. Nothing wrong with IPhone enjoyed my time with them also.
This guy was more iOS biased
it funny that apple have to go again all these tech and still hold it own
This video looked more like an Ad than an actual comparative video. On many points it appears that they didn't even considerate what they were saying. Why the draw on software features,   like the "point" IOS was the "pillars" yet: none of them are unique or exclusive to IOs, like Airdroid which is the Airdrop equivalent that has existed since 2014 and for sure there is many more other apps that do same the job. And with the argument, I don't care about Airdrop or Airdroid, but still have both features in both OS, but Android still didn't for having  actual exclusive features. Apple been env. friendly is the biggest lie told by them, just to cut cost for their own profit. Like not including the charger,  so they can sell it to you later. Arron has said himself a lot in previous videos. And also he mentions that Nokia and Fair phone doing a lot too, but either way the point still goes to Apple. I found this video very misleading, not because some few mistakes but because its extremely biased
Felt biased
MKBHD is a kiddo .... Go get some knowledge about android kiddo
Working
This isn't what I was expecting, you guys weren't fair enough in your opinions
MKBiased. 😒 You know where it's going already.
Oh also the emulators I used apple doesn't allow and some apps that are free for me cost or aren't on the app store for apple
Come on this other guy that I don't know his name is just an iphone fan he doesn't even wants to admit the camera superiority that is so obvious what is the so close words man stop it will you 😁😁😁
I can't trust you two again 😠😠😠
iam an avid apple user. i only use apple but even I must say that they kinda tipped the scales in apples favour by asking apple bias questions. but idk I still do prefer apple
I do video calls on my Samsung and then you can use duo also
Wow... What an ad..  Paid videos should be like this.. 😂
12:26 me the whole time: goodlock goodlock goodlock...  no but seriously imo ios has some things that I've reeaally like to have but android has the things i absolutely need to have
Why not compare huge custom ROM support for android models ..with insane control over the hardware and basically do what you want (android) vs  do what we allow you to do(apple) You can even install windows or Linux on android hardware whereas on apple you can't even side load an app
I have a Galaxy S20 FE 5G. My battery lasts all day and bit. But that really depends on usage. And environment score to the iPhone? For a company that has planned obsolescence at its core? Really? That I don't agree with. Software features? Focus on cross platform compatibility. Apple refuse to make its apps accessible across phones. Which is why it is incredibly annoying when iPhone users "like" an sms and Android users receive an "Liked" sms. Annoying. Additionally - outside of the US? Android. USB-C Charging. Oh and file management? Android wins that hands down. Its highly confusing the way Apple does it. And so on, and so on. Really - the final scores should be even between the two.
Love both of your channels but this was a little to biased...
Decision make easy when you carry both.
No chance display is a draw Samsung S22 Ultra or OP 10 pro is far more superior than iPhone handsdown Android is the winner and MKBHD is a iPhone lover he comes up with some or the other bizzare reasons to pick iOS over Android
For me, it's price. With my carrier cheapest iPhone starts at £24 per month. Cheapest Samsung Android £13. And there are even cheaper Android phones out there.
The problem with comparing Android to iPhone is that you are comparing one company to hundreds of companies and from that fact alone, through all of Android's collective time and knowledge, Android always wins. Because of variety, it's not a fair fight. Now say if you were to compare iPhone to Samsung that would be a whole different story.
All that depends on your budget and choice
I use both iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung S10+ as my daily phones. Almost three year generation gap. I take advantage of all what both platforms have to offer. But if I have to choose one, it would be an easy choice for me to keep the Samsung and let go of the iPhone for all the many reasons people have been posting in the thread. The S10+ will be replaced by the S23 Ultra next year.  My only take on Android coming from Google as one of the most established software companies in the world, is that their software is not as smooth and responsive, and some important apps just behave better and better-designed on iPhones, ironically including Google Maps. Regarding Apple exclusives, I don’t use FaceTime and I don’t use iMessage. Also what everyone forgets to mention is that Samsung has an exact equivalent (even better) to Airdrop now which is Quick Share.
Usb c is nice I admit it, but tbh I don’t mind using the lighting it’s actually comforting that it isn’t as brittle as usb c, and since I use airdrop I don’t really mind transfer speed of lightning
Apple would need to do 2 things for me to ever consider it a possibility. It has to be able to use 3rd party launchers, and you would have to be able to flash, hack, and generally "play" with it. A lot of what I do with phones, I just can't with an iphone, so it's never been an option.
Apple is for the dumb
Come on guys really I feel like u hv let me down
Android is better as their range . Love u android
Price??? No one???😂
Apple definitely sponsored this video
10:01 at this point it was impossible for android to win
Making money with bullshit Videos!
Samsung 51 has 7000 mag battery, but idk if it's there in the market anymore.
wow.. this is probably my most disliked posts by you.. it is just two guys telling their opinions. Of course there are biases at play in this.  This would have been be better with more testing than ppl saying what they like the best.
Android specially Samsung is clearly winner in Screen details, OnePlus and Xiaomi in Charging and battery life and everything but this was perhaps Promotion for iPhone so they decided to go all in favor of iPhone.
It's funny, cause Android is just the OS, while iPhone is the brand. There are so many companies making Android phones, there should always be a phone that is better than iPhone in atleast one aspect.  However, as "Android" has such an unfocused building route, with all the different companies that build phones and put Android onto it. You can't really Compare, You'd have to find the very best android phone and then compare that to iPhones.  Some of the comments I'm hearing are really "Fanboy" like, I've been using the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. The only real issue I have with it is, when using it as a GPS (Maps or Waze or whatever) it tends to really heat up on warm days and just stop working at somepoint. But then, it only does that when I am driving with the sun directly on my windscreen.  Still, heat dissipation could be much better. Thinking that is a thing all phones could do with though.
I like the comparison, especially because one person goes for the average man while another goes for the professionals. Sorry @Mrwhosetheboss, this is not hate, but I think if we were to know at the pro level what a phone has before using it.....Thank you, @mrkAmmMakMg. We want to take a quick pic
IF Google starts G-silicon chips that can compete with top tier Snapdragon,Bionics Evenly becomes True Android KING 👑
I've been using Note 10 for a few years and bought iphone 13 pro... I am not sure I am happy with apple anymore (I was iphone users for 10 years).. Physically, Iphone pro is very thick and heavy and Camera is still worst than Note 10 but battery last long. And I realise how Android is so comfortable to nevigate the windows every buttons are on the bottom side so I can easily go to back and close with one hand also USB C is so convience.
Went from Iphone to Android back to Iphone. I have used an Samsung S8 and S10 for 4 years, then switched back to Iphone. Much easier and productive(also with ecosystem so much better with AirDrop and copy/paste among devices). Android is too much hassle and goes slow/hot after 2 years... Android Auto way too much hassle, GPS that is not working.. was frustrated with the  Samsung S9 and S10. Will not switch back to Android for coming years that's for sure.
I'm a software developer. And the ease with which I can test my mobile apps on an Android phone as compared to an iphone is almost ridiculous. You literally need to own a MacBook to even be allowed to do something like that on an iphone. It's ridiculous.  There are other reasons. And I know this is very niche, but for a software developer, i feel like I'm forced to use an iphone and a MacBook. Not that i actually want to. I'm backed into a corner.
Most of the world cannot afford iPhones, and that is probably the biggest deal/consideration lol
I think you guys lost any possible credibility with this "comparison". As many others already pointed out, you didn't even try to make it fair
All the Android phones in the world and the iPhone.. you already know who beat who.
Considering that an Android cam give you both a large battery and a fast charger and the option to change your charger to a better one anytime you want, Imma have to disagree with you on the battery.  For the camera, it's based on preference. But for the battery, whatever you prefer, an Android will give it to you.
so when are you going to review huawei's os? (harmony os)
I can download mod apks in my android , I think iPhone is a luxury product , you have to pay for a ringtone come on man . I have mod apks worth hundreds of dollars . I have Spotify premium apk , an average iOS user has to spend atleast say 70$ an year . So many other things . iPhone is good for people who like to stay in a cage and the cage is made of gold . Android is a free atmosphere but a bronze world
I think you skipped a very important category in not including openness for apps. iPhone having a more closed system has much less choice than Android that has apps for everything and it's much easier to install apps from sources outside the play store
Was this video sponsored?... coz to me, it feels biased🤔
The biggest problem I have with Android is that it isn't Apple vs Android. Apple is the operating system, the phone, the computer, the cloud, the integration - all of it. Android is maybe a flagship Samsung or a terrible Motorola or an average Sony or whatever, and they are ALL different and they don't have the related computer OS or computer hardware/cloud synergy, Android just doesn't integrate across the entire system that users need, which is to seamlessly use a computer/phone/cloud system.
Interesting points made in this video, however... Screen, battery camera, sound quality are all second tier on even the most expensive iphones out there... The only thing an iphone can win is pure performance and even there, its subjective as the way that benchmarks are developed for IOS are quite diferent from how they are developed for android.  Reliability is all fine and dandy on iphone, but never in my life have i experienced a snapped picture dissapearing from my android and i have been using android since 2011, no clue what that guy was talking about, probably he had a broken sd card or a crappy third party camera app.   I have tried iphones many times and they always had  that locked down feeling tome, as you were missing the entire world out there living in a confined box.  Sometimes in the past, an iphone could be the best of all overall, but not anymore.
Biggest mistake I ever made was switching to Android. I miss the seamless iMac to iPhone environment. Android through Google just doesn't work for me.
Apple does an excellent job on design and implementation. But their focus is on their own profitability, not the user's interest. This translates into situations when their design calls are made to lock users in, not really for their benefit.  Specifically: Planned obsolescence, which is still in place. Blocking other ad service providers from working on iOS but permitting their own service provider to continue. Blocking export of user content off the device - take a video or a photo, and it's a project to take it off the phone and onto your computer. Creating multiple copies of the same content on iCloud, which fills up the space, and then asking for a subscription for more space at 2x the market price for cloud storage. Exploitation of developers - they operate and pay the Apple Tax out of no choice, but it's not fair, and it's monopolistic. Not everybody is Epic or can take the call to walk away from such a big market. Making copies of good games and releasing them on Apple Arcade... I'd like to see somebody try and copy an Apple game and release it on their platform.   On the pro side, Apple phones get cases and accessories and screen protectors that Android can never get, just because of the variety. The recovery of components for reuse is also awesome, again possible because of the limited number of models. Third party apps  work excellently, same reason.   This is top of mind, and it felt like the video was also very top of mind. I didn't get the sense of deeply thought out content that I usually get from these guys.   I stay out of Apple because I feel exploited by them. It's a very simple reason. :)
You all here, but making money. So I will stick to android/Samsung not taking any YouTuber ideas, I come in peace 😌
Hey fixed the title for you guys Android vs iPhone - Which is ACTUALLY Better in the US? (ft MKBHD) - A biased comaprision
MKBHD is such an Apple fan boy
Lol stop trying to debate with ecosystem iPhone users he is delousinal when it comes to photos.
And we have Technical Guruji who just do English to Hindi reading of specifications. 🤣
This is so insightful... iphone bu Odogwu
Thanks a lot for the info! Really appreciate it!
You can’t really compare iPhone vs *all* Android phones. It’s not the same at all. You could pick and choose top things from a wide range of Android phones but not have all of them on one phone.
Only I love stevejobs I love apple 🍎 but u really good awesome men I like it 👍🔥🍎
I feel this video was biased too much towards Apple's side. There are more Android users than iPhone in this version of Earth :P and if you ask majority of people about Expensive vs Affordability, I guess they would go with Affordability.
Android > iPhone 1000000% I regret switching to iPhone 12 and will be switching back soon.
ofcourse ios is better than android but this video is completely biased towards ios. Camera is good in pixel and ultra 22 mobiles but mkbhd said apple has good camera not acceptable. features wise android has vast features. What ever you asked to mkbhd he will blindly say ios i think he is iphone fan boy
stock Calendar/productivity and stock navigation is a primary feature IMO of all phones and would have liked to see stock apps or stock productivity apps as its own topic in a part 2 of Android vs iPhone
A bit biased.  especially on the features side of things, airdrop and facetime aren't popular in my country (in this case Philippines) and so does in other countries since yknow, Messenger, Google Meet, Zoom, Discord lol

where is nothing phone review 🥲
do you guys think that Samsung should team up whit huawei and Microsoft at the same time they could be the best option
It totally appears to be Apple sponsored. iPhone doesn't have one of the best batteries but here it seems to get a winning point.  How is that even valid point?
Im using an iPhone now because i waa curious about the experience  And i feel like im using an downgrade version of Android lol   Is not bad because it works but my god the notifications are absolutely garbage just to name  something i didn't like about this os xd
Still I think android excels for making smartphones a mainstream device in the whole world. It also set a good standard for these devices  Not all people can afford 400 dollar phones.
Pocket wise android 😅
IPhone is boring to have and use.
Watching with Huawei P20pro without any noticable battery degradation, and watching Iphone users that struggle to get signal in low coverage. And laughing at comparations 😁
Commenting for YouTube algorithms
Why it seems more like a paid promotion video by Apple for its new upcoming ios??????????
This video doesn't look like there was a script. And it was fun, for real. Keep making it fun man. We love it
who is blue and green
Android is still better, with capacitities such as: multitasking, ability to download music for free from the i nternet, the ability to root your old android phone for the latest android os, the stabilization of ppsspp app in android and best of all android is more accessible to anyone since its cheaper. Camera optimizations and app stabilizations are all things android can do as well.
MKBHD IS AN IPHONE FAN FROM HIS STARTING CARRIER, SO THAT,,,,,
Bhai indore aaye toh batana milna h tujhse
arun is team Android and MKB is baised team apple  😂
removing chargers is eco... nomic
I'd give the eco consciousness to Android just because of all the extra packaging from Apple and that they paved the way of not including headphones and charger with your new phone.
Love love the colour grading
I've always found a comparison between the two redundant. It all boils down to the user…and every user is unique with specific set of needs and preferences. That's just me.
I recently upgraded from an iPhone 12 Pro to a Galaxy S22 Ultra I have used both iPhone and Android phones in the past my first Android phone was the Galaxy S2 and the battery only lasted from 7:00am till noon my first iPhone was the iPhone 5 I also had a Galaxy Note7 but had to return it because of the exploding battery issue before the Galaxy S2 I only ever used Nokia phones I love both iOS and Android OS but my ideal phone would have all the best stuff from iOS and Android OS
Kinda pointless debate... it's like comparing Havard vs Universities.
Android clearly better with customization, also apps and software choice
I just unsubscribed because of this video Biased
It will never trade my S21 ultra for anything!
This video fake opnniyat worlde best Samsung
What if Galaxy s22 ultra was made by apple : Apple Galaxy S22 Ultra Iphone 13 pro max was made by samsung : Samsung Iphone 13 Pro Max  Which would you choose?
This was clearly a one sided video both of your points were leading more to android in some arguments and then all of a shot apple gets the win apple is rubbish end of and the video was about android not Samsung but iPhone was giving points even tho other android done it better please explain that one Aaron?
offcourse Android ,ask girls about their choice black or any other dxxk they would prefer a black dxxk 😂😂😂😂no doubt about it
How come no one is mentioning IPHONE all of a sudden many apps not working horizontal format? (eg, news apps) Iphone still has worse sound…Apple never improves basic functions …for example you still need a finger the width of a pencil point to scroll through contacts alphabetically etc.
Having never owned and will not purchase an iPhone, I guess you could call me biased but, that doesn't mean that I don't have great respect for Apple products. I do own a MacBook Air. However, 2.5 to 7.5? That's not realistic no matter how much of a fanboy or fangirl you may be. The score lowered my confidence in  MB's future reviews. That score felt biased and contrived. I seldom buy the same brand when getting a new phone as I like unusual phones. I just can't seem to pull the trigger for a phone that 'everyone' has. Therefore, no iPhone and no Samsung for me.
My first phone was an iPhone 6 then 6s and finally, 7 plus. I heard so many interesting things about android so I got myself an Samsung S10 plus last 2019. A real gorgeous phone, it’s really fast and the display is great. As for the android os, it is user friendly. You can adopt with it within minutes. It’s 2022 my S10 plus screen felt crap. It is tapping the bottom screen by itself. Sometimes, It doesnt respond at all when I touch. Most of the apps Im using crashes sometimes. And the battery is so quick to drain. To be honest, aside from the battery, I never experience this on an iPhone. I decided to go back to apple and picked iPhone 13 pro max. It’s been a month and I would say that this is best phone I had and just like my experience on any iPhone that I had, I never had any issues on my apps and touch response of my screen is really good. So yep, Im back to Apple
There are equivalents to AirDrop FaceTime for Android. NearByShare and Duo, but no one uses it. ^^
Apple fan boys this two
Too biased
Quite surprised by Marques's comments as s22 ultra was given phone of the year. There is not much difference in both platforms now as shown in the score.
The black dude talks so much bs. When I got my iPhone 13 pro max I immediately sold it to my dad coz it tends to overheat quickly while playing genshin which results to significant drop in frame rate and I started to experience some lag spikes all in a matter of 10 minutes of gaming. The bionic bull crap is not that great of a chipset. The 6 gig ram is too low in today's standards. The screen of the iPhone is so far behind the android competition. They buy their screens from Samsung they don't have their own screen technology. The reason why Apple scores so high in benchmark tests is because the chipset throttles itself to achieve those scores. You would not notice the drawback of throttling during benchmark testing coz you only see numbers. It's a completely different experience in an actual gaming scenario coz you would then see how apple tries to throttle to force itself to output a better performance which in return heats up the phone which then results to frame drops, lag spikes, and stutters. So counterproductivee and inefficient. Apple is playing catch up in the world of technology. The only thing appealing about Apple nowadays is its name and logo coz many tech illiterates think its a luxury item.
Come on the boss. Did  Apple 🍎 fly you across the pond to batch slap yourself 🤔
That's the most biased video you ever made... but it wasn't you it was M-Guy....
Android > Apple
i like and use android far more than iphone. i think androids are better and more costumizable.and their batteries are stronger than iphone.
If you compare the two, you can't compare the best of IPhone in every case vs the average of android. The beauty of android is choice. So compare the best of iPhone against the best of android and every class and then see the scores balance. There's literally an android phone made for each class, you can't just ignore it because there are different android phones that arnt made for it. It's like comparing the iPhone mini to the S22 ultra and ignoring the 13 Pro max
What they fail to mention is that alot of the parts in the iphone including the screen are made by Samsung, you know, the biggest Android manufacturer in the world. The iPhone is a Android. Apple new they couldn't beat Samsung so they had to join them lol.
I don't know how you can possibly have a fair comparison between "Android" and the iPhone simply because there is only one iPhone and a dozen or so different Android phones, and so comparing specific features between a single, monolithic line of phones versus a multipolar array of phones is a bit like comparing a Nissan Leaf with "Trucks."  Like, okay, which truck are we talking about?  Or, conversely, it'd be like comparing the Toyota Tacoma vs. "EVs" -- okay, like, which EV?  I think a comparison between the Samsung S22 Ultra vs. the latest iteration of iPhone would be a more useful comparison, or the Pixel 6 Pro, or whatever, vs. the iPhone.
Oh MBKHD is definitely an some Apple stuff 😂 It's justified though 💯
I'm really sorry, maybe the iPhone is better than Samsung, but not as you say
Rematch please! I think the whole video should be flagship to flagship to make it more of a fair comparison because otherwise android just has so many options that it scatters the playing field so you guys end up giving the einning point to iPhone. A thing you guys should discuss is shapes of keyboard and autocorrect accuracy, and texting features, like the confetti drop and fireworks etc that iphones have. Also, bluetooth connectivity to cars, airpods, apeakers, and reliability of those connections etc between the two phones or platforms. It also didn't really seem like you spoke about user-friendliness of either platform either. Anyway, great idea, I'd love to hear what you two have to say specifically comparing iPhone 13 vs Samsung galaxy s22 please!! Thank you :)
iPhone sucks if you aren't into the ecosystem and don't use cloud services to backup and transfer...
Air drop is also in Android BTW, it's called Nearby Share
Sorry arun....usually i watch all ur vids n like before watching cause ik its gonna be gud....same goes for this vid but had to change to dislikes.....this is too bias n probably bad research 🤦‍♂️
I have used both, but decided Android was the one for me ... also want to have a go with HarmonyOS ..
Guys let's be real, as both Andriod and Apple user myself, I can confedently say this was way too biased toward iPhone, Display Samsung wins in every aspect, especially during the day, Overall UI usability Samsung wins, USB C is pretty major too, Camera goes to Samsung and so on, iPhone is good only with their eco system and pure performance that's just about it
Two biased apple fanboys.
MKBHD is team iphone.... Mr Whosetheboss you seemed to agree with whatever MK said....
Jeez I didn’t expect so much back lash the android fan boys are out in droves, in general a new iPhone was rated as superior to the average android and we’ve seen from Arun before that overall the iPhone 13 is a solid product that edges out most of the competition, it nothing to call the guys shills over. Sure particular androids might have features like styluses, usb-c or be great for the environment but as we’ve seen in previous videos come with cons. The flaws in an iPhone often don’t matter to the average consumer and that’s what this is about. It’s about what the average not techy and not overly invested consumer really needs.
Android is like shopping in the supermarket without a shopping list. You can always pick a phone that is interesting and fun however for bread a butter, you go iPhone as you know what you are getting.
Though I envy some of the iphone features and Apple's ecosystem fluidity, I think I'll always be an Android guy for more freedom. To be able to work with lots of other systems, being heterogenous, is a positive side in itself.  Anyway, many consider software update support as die hard crucial. I'd say old hardware is old. My old phone from 2016 is still working after 6 years, with worn, discontinued battery, still smooth getting through menus but gets slower with newer and newer apps updates.
MicroSD, Stylus, wireless charging, better nits etc etc samsung wins on many other things
Is it iOS vs Android or Apple vs Samsung? Considering the fact the iOS just supports a couple of HW configurations compared to the thousands of HW configurations supported by Android I would say Apple iOS is really unstable. I would have added another category: Culture. This goes to Android, being a very much inclusive operating system vs iOS being just business oriented.
So MKBHD leans alot to Iphone, being the better phone, and yet he uses the samsung s21 alot as his preferred phone, go figure.
arent you working on your health?😑😑
I still use my iPhone 5s actively 💪🏽
Love both of y'all, but seemed a bit bias. Like, why would you be comparing an average Android to a top of the line iPhone 13 Pro Max?
Gotta justify that Apple sponsorship contract, eh boys?
This video is incredibly biased. The thing is that MKBHD is an Apple Fanboy. There were a ton of points were MKBHD said he liked Apple more, Arun said he liked Android more, like the Camera and Battery sections. These should have been a tie or for Android. Also, this video should have been Android (the system) vs iOS (the system) or Apple vs Samsung, but not Android as a whole vs Apple.
I don't need all the new stuff like airpods I got a Sony sports walkman
Apple versus Everybody
Thank you for the most biased video on the Internet was a big fan of your work but now will never see your videos again
MKBHD is turning into an i-sheep just like iJustine. Notch is meh  outdated design for me .
Why would you use an assistant for a phone
camera and battery"wtf r u say"😂
MKBHD's voice volume is too low compared to a guy on the right.
Samsung is better in many ways… but in case of long time use.. Samsung is worst….after it warrenty period it shows original colors. Hang problem and many more…
Which is better? me: Idc
Wow a video with the best 2 guys in tech reviews
Hummm i don’t know but this looks more like an advertisement for iPhone.
This programe is sponsored by apple.. ha ha.. influencers of apple company. but this video really help people to get a real face of this kind of YouTubers.
It seems Apple sponsored this video because even the iphone has problems that they didnt even discuss.
Android=love
Android users are very bothered by this review. What Android users have to listen to that they decided to ignore. Yes maybe one Android phone has a comparable battery to the iPhone 13 but most don’t. Yes they’re are foldable phones but they’re not that popular it’s a niche thing. Yes some Androids have 120hz but it’s not as smooth as Apple. Overall Apple is just a better phone even though you have android phones here and there that are better then apple in certain categories.
MBKHD has no more soft corner for Android,clearly visible
Looks so one dimesional,S22 Ultra is not a pushover my friend.
No point for Google Assistant?
Biased review,so disappointed from both of you guys
Love the vid
the most unfair video I have watched on YouTube....
Don't disagree with a lot of your arguments. Apple not letting me put my apps where I want sucks and the Notch is the worst looking, least necessary security/design feature ever.
Ain’t no way people 100% prefer android  they just haven’t heed the opportunity to own a 1tb iPhone 13 pro max
Never seen such a one sided argument as this from Marques
Doing split screen watching this and playing a GBA emulator on my Fold3 right now
Mkbhd was always biased and in favor of iPhone, poor video very disheartening. Many times iphone lags or in tie but point goes to iphone. If this video was done by @Mrwhoistheboss alone it would've been much much good and better. So biased video.
The split screen or multi task is great when entering credit card info from a photo or drawing a photo sketch, or lookong at blue print while using cad etc inuse daily split screen
If iphone is best in most cases, then why  mkbhd chose an android flagship for his awards?   Sounded like a promotion
I'm afraid you guys (and especially  MKB...who intentionally or not... came across as uncharacteristically bias in this segment)might be losing more than a few subscribers here as this was extremely painful to watch as you two guys coming across as being bought and paid for by Apple...very much as if both of you were in a paid commercial for Apple! My dissatisfaction AND  disappointment knows no bounds....and this is pretty much the same exact sentiment (some being even worse) expressed by 100 percent of my contacts  that I spoke to after getting their take on this episode of yours,(and this included quite a few iPhone users as well)about the obvious and perceived bias displayed in this segment.Correct me if I'm wrong here...but isn't Android phones sales worldwide far outpace those of iPhone by a significant margin🤔,or is the rest of us out here who are not as tech savvy as you two guys missing something SO very significant that it could probably change our lives for the better?? This is quite possibly the most one sided Android bashing that I've ever witnessed on any  phone tech channel.....EVER!! 👎😤😠 (Ps.I have  both types of phones!)
Wtf did Apple sponsor this?! Samsung destroys Apple no question but I guess this is Android vs Apple which is a very conflicted comparison to begin with... I've been into tech most of my life and I've been thru ALOT of phones and the iPhone can't hold a candle to a Samsung flagship.
You guys clearly use iPhones thus the unfair scores.
Who are you? But it's your site. Who is this guy and why is he expert? Short intro maybe?
Call it a draw if Android  win. Just caught the last one. Maybe Apple caught up since I played with one but really Apple is like the books..  neurosurgery for dummies etc. And I get that. Novelty has worn off. I want my computer to be like a clever TV. Just works simply for years and doesn't spy on me. I really have no need to spend 1000 dollars on a phone. My phone does what I want and takes decent pic and vids for fraction of that. But the insidious software updates and bloat ware etc make me resentful. Apple however try to tie you down like a hog. Quite ironic their old smash the system (emi) add when you consider they are modern day slave owners.
Why do I have a android and a apple?
this was biased 😂😂
Guy on left is Apple fan boy. Only reason I would go Apple is the data and privacy issue.
Talk about a TOTALLY BIASED comparison. I thought it was icrap vs. android - not icrap vs Samsung.... apple doesn't even come close as far as fast charge, screen clarity /size, value and accessibility and absurd amount of available FREE apps.  I gave up counting how many times my wife has asked to use my Realme phone because its BETTER at everyday things than her icrap. Then there's the usb-c that everything uses, as opposed to the cord I am CONSTANTLY replacing and paying OUTRAGEOUS $$$ for my wifes icrap As far as price for an every-day phone, android wins HANDS DOWN! anyone saying differently obviously has a money tree in the back yard, or is the lead advisor of the usa fed...
Something built in to iPhones from Day one, that I’ve never heard of any competitor matching, is; in person Apple store support, either under warranty, out of warranty. Face to face, prompt, courteous, quality no rush support and service. 12 years of iPhones, three times, without pressing them, they’ve just handed me a new(refurbished )phone, once over an only slightly unresponsive home button. All of that costs something, it’s part of the value equation.
Long time user of android and I love my 13PM in anything but camera I miss my damn P40 Pro. Had better quality.
I'm damn sure MKBHD is great fan of iOS 😄😄
Who still thinks android is better🙋‍♂️
No biased here move along guys .😂😂
2 📱 🐐’s
Something fishy, 🙄🙄🙄🙄
apple is not that useful here in the philippines. so many connectivity problems.
First time seeing top two techs reviewing phones.  Been using both androids and iphones... my gf likes apple only... says she's used to the features.  I like apple for the smoothness and better looking icons, but I like the option of having a micro SD card slots on androids.  transfering files to and fro a windows based laptop seems easier with androids.   Had the iphone 13 pro max for 6 months.  The camera is quite decent and has pretty stabilizers.  I wish there is more contrast with taking videos...  I know there are filters, but... Canon Cameras are still better quality for adjusting contrast.  Microsoft is moving to ARMs type chips and they already have a phone.  I wonder how their phones are doing now.  Haven't searched yet.
you have no dressing sense.
Can you do a review on the Nokia 225?
Based
Iphone does not allow to pause while recording a video.
I feel the guy is being bias with his opinions
Wow no V60 for photos? It's so one of the best.  Especially in manual mode.
This was such a narrow and biased discussion completely missing those features that has made Android what it is today, Apple does have the reputation of taking things and "making them better", but it's not such a wide margin between the two. Kinda disappointed with this take, I was waiting for "This was sponsored by Apple" at the end smh
I thought the video was ok. Lighting was fine.  Content was good too.  I find a lot of times most people want a phone that works, they may not care about things like refresh rate and app crashes and use of specific services. Anyway over all good video.
I started watching this video thinking well maybe it won't be biased but it is. Clearly Apple fan boys, Apple sponsored, or both.
Anything besides a Chinese phone lol
I own both iphone and android.  Iphone is absolute crap.  Can't edit or produce a simple video.  Can't move videos or music to PC. Can't even get the PC to see the iphone unless i sacrifice a chicken and the planets are aligned.  Ive gone through 2 iphone chargers in a year and you can't use a regular charger.   Moving music on Android is easy drag n drop. Android comes with a video editor.  Android chargers are sold at gas stations.  I will never ever own another iphone.
iPhones are made by Chinese child labor. That is why I buy Samsung. I have no problems with my S21
I used to be a hard-core apple only user, but I got tired of jailbreaking the iPhone to do some things andriod can already do. Once samsung got better  starting from the s4 I switch and never looked back.
Aw yeah IPhone !
Android  period.
Totally agree (iPhone user), but usb-c and notifications should have been part of the conversation.
Totally biased.  I know this because I regularly switch phones between Samsung Galaxy S22U and iPhone 13 Pro since I own both phones.
🇵🇬🇵🇬
I would disagree that the customization of the iPhone is better than android. Mostly not. Sure they’re keeping up and trying to do it better. But we all now when apple does something new. They still set limits. Almost no limits on android customization. I got iOS 16 right now, even tho it’s an beta. You still feel “locked” you can only choose between 5-6 clock fonts. A lot of widgets but none useful for the normal person. I hope apple will let us customize fully instead of customizing with limits.
I know this is so random and off topic but to anyone else that rides a Onewheel wouldn’t it be cool if he mentioned one?
the most cringe video ever from mkbhd
Hello does anyone know the website that Arun once advertised that they could track where you've signed in with your email and you can request to delete your information too
lightning port makes the iphone way less eco-friendly.
Just because it has a bigger battery doesn't mean it's "better". It's the life of the battery. He said if he puts the ROG phone at 60 HZ, it beats the iPhone but if you put 120 HZ, then the iPhone will beat it
I AM ANDROID FOR EVER
Desde el punto de favoritismo este vídeo es solo para fanboys... De Apple al dar una comparación imparcialial y coincido el análisis de varios puntos de la reacción de su video  marcianotech donde solo hablan desde un punto de crítica donde solo resaltan las características de un producto de Apple pero dejan de un lado sus desventajas.
If u care that much about imessage and facetime just use messenger.
This one felt really weird to watch. It almost felt Apple sponsored. Because even in the cases where Android was the clear winner, MKBHD would stretch really far for iphone. I'm not necessarily team Android or iPhone. I think iPhones a better business phone and Android is better for leisure. But none of that seemed to factor into anything. The numbers didn't even Factor into anything
I knew this video was going to be Iphone bias, don't know why I bothered watching.
Why is this still a topic in 2022? Both iPhone and Android phones are amazing pieces of technology beyond what anyone of us could've imagined just a few years ago.
5:37 how u get drakes new album before it dropped
I like how iPhone won the overall opinion. But Marcus is rocking a year old Android. That says a lot.
"Here are the 10 different aspects of the smart phone experience, but first, a word from our sponsor, Apple...."
Y’all lost me at “eco conscious “ 👀
I'm an apple fan boy but this video doesn't make any sense
I’d like both or even prefer android for its crazy features and innovations but every time I end up with my iPhone, it's more reliable, and whatever features it has, are better executed.
Also when u said that apple would be a head of the game because of how they worked longer on features just means that they have no real creativity and are just copying android
Interesting that Marques rates iPhone better in almost all categories yet carries last years Galaxy
Iphone don't have shit on a samsung s22 ultra. So many more features and all around experience
What where they talking about??? IPhone has the absolute worste battery life out of anything tech imaginable, it dies in a day and  takes so long to charge, it doesn't even come with a charger anymore!!! Android charges super fast and has a longer lasting battery life. Android also has more game support and supports more devices while iOS is mainly and I think only apple. In my opinion all that apple has is their logo😕
I would have to disagree with customization. Android is leaps and bounds ahead of iOS they would have to get at least one full point for that in my opinion
Iphone pay them to make that video,
Sold My iPhone 13 pro max and am getting the better Samsung s21 ultra. The s21 ultra is a better all rounder phone, the iPhone doesn't even have a 100x zoom, the Samsung is the better all rounder phone. Better in gaming and camera
It's really not a proper comparison 😂😂.  I don't Think apple phone was so much like that.. even it's not.. I think Samsung galaxy s22 ultra is way better than i phone 13 pro... Sorry to say but it's like apple sponsored the video... i used iPhone 13 pro but really... Trust me Samsung s22 ultra is legend here... And u guys didn't even think about it... Who check the Geekbench scores?? It's about 4 months for me s22 ultra.. but never got a problem... With any glitch something.. i had s20 ultra for more than 2.5 years.. didn't get any problem.. even I use it a lot... 😂.  The thing is brand name apple which costs u a lot... U r making side to that.. Never thought about the purchases on iPhone apps??  Does iPhone connects with everything in so much easy way?? iPhone can share to anyone??? U can do whatever u need and want on an android!!  It's total looking like biased... Nothing was point their instead of Videography..
I avoided this video for a while because I already knew how MKBHD would vote... I was right...
This is so Biased it's not funny, come on! Better Marques just said I prefer the iPhone and leave it at that!
Andriod sheep reeeal aggy in the comments 😅
Thank you. I really enjoyed this presentation. I didn’t have any feeling things were dishonest. I thought it was more honest than anything presented by either iPhone or Android. Also, I didn’t see this has competitive. It was two guys I respect having a conversation about their opinions without being argumentative. I really enjoyed the dialogue. I’d like to see more. Very information and fun to watch. A great example on how I expect politicians and governments to behave…at least in public.
Apple is Apple Boii✌🏻
The same anwser is true 10 years later: You want a smartphone -> Android, you want a simple phone -> iOS If you think I'am wrong, try downloading and editing an Excel File on your iOS device, than share it via anything else besides mail.  Have fun
The comment about support. While Apple has 5 years, my experience is that Apple cripples the phones so you can't run certain apps, while the Android apps (in my experience) work on old or new phones.
This is cool
This was very interesting. One thing iPhones/iPads do better than Android (unfortunately) is making music. This is because the delay time between hitting a key and the sound coming out is much shorter. Generally, I prefer Android but iOS has some strong features.  Incidentally, why do so many YouTubers zoom in so much, so often? I guess YouTubers are just copying each other.
Felt like an iphone promotion ngl, maybe apple paid them to do this
3:20 iPhone has 4x the L3 memory than the snapdragon chip which may be one of the reason for smoother experience.
Biased video
Hi  of course the Samsung is the best .
How can you compare Android vs an iPhone in 2022 when Android is an Operating System not a hardware device with an OS that is designed for it? You would have to put the iPhone against every high-end Android Phones on the Market. I would have compared Google Pixel 6 Pro against an iPhone 13 Pro
Don't forget this guy came all the way form the UK to an Apple event in the US.... He would be mad to say anything bad about apple , sadly if you want to have a inside seat to the apple world you better be on their side,   Android win hands down in features, you can copy and paste text from pictured to you PC , WHICH IS A MUST HAVE if your in collage/uni, unless you got big bucks and ate rocking a iPhone and a Mac and even then Im not sure about the integration in apps like office or Google docs ,  And get The F outta here with apple being eco friendly, they make their own proprietary charging solutions that no one else uses , and they even change them whenever they want to, leaving all those old chargers USELESS (WTF) that why the EU is forcing them to use usb type C.   google assistant (they even admitted it) is way better,   a lot of apps just work with a PC ,   Android is the cheaper option hands down, you just get more bang for your buck, and equiped with a photo editing app like Inshot your pics on a cheap as chips android phone look the same or even better than standard iphone pics..  Iphone pushed there prices waayyy too far up to really compete with Android since android runs on all the competition from low to high end   and I do agree high end android doesn't make any sense.  Android sits in the low to mid spot were a phone shouldn't cost 1000buks (WTF) even rich people be like "this phone is a statement not really anything more on the functionality at 1000buks"
You may be also mentioned about back up issues on android, even if you hava paid google drive, it keeps your backup 52 or 57 days if you are not active with your phone!! . After that all is gone. Google become the overrated company of this open source era…
You can't even surgically separate marques from iPhone. He actually has a soft spot for iPhone, in addition to the fact that most android don't reach the US
I would also want to talk about cloud support, especially icloud and samsung cloud. One or two years ago, samsung stopped samsung cloud, and suggested to go with onedrive, good, until you see that onedrive is 7x the price of samsung cloud. They also gave out a year of onedrive 20gb (good), but right now this has stopped so I need to download them back on my pc. Btw, if I didn't have a pc at the time, I would have losst priceless memories of travels, FOR EVER as all the pictures got wipped of the phone and couldn't download them as my storage was full + didn't have an sd card (also, when moving pictures to sd card, the date gets reset). All of this to say that I wouldn't have had all these problems if I would have continued with iPhone. I tested android once, probably never going back. ps I have a galaxy s8 exynos and the performace and battery life is crap compared to US snapdragon version, for the same price (or more)
so basically when android is better is a draw and when its really a draw it goes for the iPhone !?
I dunno I prefer Nokia. I just like the war happening between iPhone and Android.
Iphone is just simple and fast I had a Samsung lives freezing 🥶
…and what about privacy??? Who is the winner???
I like looking at the Siri logo and than not use it
I love how is play my favourite game genshin impact
Samsung is better than apple at everything in my opinion apart from the Face ID because it is a very tiny bit faster
Samsung has its own version of air drop
You over rate Iphone for sure. Sincerely it was biased. Android is the way to go in so many areas. You can't compare S22 ultra with IPhone 13. Samsung is way more ahead. Americans love iphones and their products only. MKBHD manipulated Mrwhosetheboss. He is just iphone inclined. Sorry to say, it was a bit of time wasted here!
The Apple had no back button. That makes it an immediate non starter for me. It's the single most useful feature on either device.
A video must be uploaded frequently. Opinions do not have to do with everyone's final choice. Today everyone has knowledge about mobile phones. Do not involve us in the game of your sponsors.
iphone cannot win the sustainability point because they are famously hard to repair and their repair pricing  is geared towards pushing the consumers to buy new one.  But this shows how corporations can easily play common folks and make you think what ever they want when everything is about making shareholders more money.
This is too hilarious...  MKBHD: Android takes better still pictures, but I'm going with the iPhone, just because its more consistent.  More consistent on taking bad photos?  They are in bedded with Apple and they are not ashamed of it.
why MKBHD voice seem bit differnt ?.
No way the camera one is for the iPhone is this a joke ??
2 guys who use iPhone  commenting on which is better platform.. Doesn't work for me...
I think the other guy is very biast towards iphone
With value, another approach is to think of total cost of ownership over a given length of time, including disposal cost. iPhone's have a strong value when you include the used resale price as well as software update length, which gives more functionality to the phone over a longer timeline.
This is the arguments of an apple fanboy
Very nice comparison video, I wonder why you left out or forgot one major difference between the two: Privacy. Is it really that normal to throw all your life’s data points, whereabouts, friends, family etc. over to Google without even raising an eyebrow?
These guys were so excited to see legacy Android features in iOS 16 such that they decided to make this video of their personal preference! Such a waste of time!
This is horrible, you can clearly see how desperate you are in trying to change his mind on giving it to IPhone,  even the last score you called a draw and blamed "Tired" 😆 Just because you recently ditched to the IPhone doesn't mean you gotta sabotage lol
You guys really were biased here .... Like a lot .... You did Android dirty
Android is about options and not forcing or trapping customer in own mindset ... If somebody care about camera Android have significant options, want ultra fast charging Android have options, want big battery Android have something in the repository for you... That is the whole point to give options as per customer requirements. Apple may have better camera than some Android or batter performance than some other Android phone but apple doesn't give that vast options for every price range. So this comparison sucks.
They got paid by apple
This was weird
its a blah blah , i am an apple fan boy , and i am telling you my experience with android and samsung is waaaaaay  better than iphone  , , iphone is a jail !  you pay money to go to jail  lol  and we all knows that :)
The best Collaboration of the tech industry with the most tech issue of all generation 💯👑
One of the only vids I've actually disliked, interesting idea but you guys did not think this vid through. Lot of key points you's missed and the questions didn't make a whole lot of sense then ended with a obvious but not great answer.
Great video......really enjoyed you two together! I agree with the result, very close tho!
This was Samsung vs Apple Not Android vs Apple
this is a sponsored video by the apple you can tell by the eco consciousness point
This video is soo biased
Lighting was bad at all dw about the small details, we care more about content and reasoning behind all that and this is where u shine as a tech youtube, you give great reasoning and logic behind your technological choices.
This is just one very biased video. Might not be fine on purpose, but it's very bias.
Choice is personal
This really should've just been Samsung vs iPhone
Linux home network + Android phones + KDE Connect = Heaven.
Every on is good as you know how to use them
Apple makes "iphone" and Android makes a variety of different models.  My point is this, compare Apple phones to Samsung devices.  People aways fail to mention this. IPhone simply can't compete with Samsung S series, Samsung Note series and definitely can't compete with the Samsung Fold series.
I love how I stayed interested the whole time 🔥
Well, we've seen that MKBHD is BIASED AF one more time! Never watching your BIASED videos anymore Mr MKBHD, go and get your paycheck from Apple. At least you have no idea about VIVO x80 Pro, you are a JOKE!
Lol this comparison is soo biased 🤣Let me try comparing Jalapeno and Beans like them. Category: Hotness MKBHD: Ya if you like your food spicy, Jalapeno wins, but if you don't care about spice, then Beans clearly gets it too.  MWTB: So....Its a tie.
I just need one phone from your big collection of phones,=_=
so now all apple haters know
biased
Best joke of the year from MKHBD, hahaha. I was listening and laughing.
can I have a s22 ultra I've been wanting one since it came out but there very very very very expensive lol I have an iphone 6s rn

I’m manifesting to get a new phone. 🤞🏻 hoped you have extra phone to change my crazy phone lol 😂 let’s see the manifestation hehe 😉
Super biased vid ngl
Imagine using android
Nice videography
respect you but this video was rigged
I love this, also the speakers of the 13 pro max was just on a different level.
Android phones with open NFC also take a huge win! I can get my workout data from my bicycle to my Pixel 4 XL everyday. Same goes for TV Remotes and Headphones. Apple doesn't work with NFC devices.
android should automatically win every software category because you can install custom FOSS roms to android
You guys are just brilliant together huge technical knowledge, and mutual respect-more please?
Arun looks fitter. kudos ⚡️
Just delete this bias video. Don't be a isheep. I thought these two are genuine. But then this video tells everything. Like they both agree that samsung have the better display and we all know no one can beat samsung in display and call it a tie🤣🤣 then features they call it a tie. Lol i was like are they on something. Camera is debatable but still i think s22ultra is better. Another video like this and I'll remove them from my list. Soo bias. Not expected
What does the heart button do in the bottom corner?
im an iphone user but this is way biased they are just sold out
The best phone is the one you are happiest with.
How is this possible.type -c is the best charging cable currently in the world
Mkbhd is a apple fanboy
Everytime Android had a chance you called it a draw 🙄
Atlast I have a video where I have to disagree ;) to some extent
Fruitful talk for me. I was just thinking what phone should I buy if I get money, but now I have clear thought which one I should buy. Thanks for hosting guest… look forward to see more videos discussing with tech reviewers…. I use to watch your videos but only today I subscribed on your channel.. sorry for being late subscriber… now I wouldn’t miss it… keep going lots of love and respect from bhutan…. TASHI DELECK
Hey guys, you should get together more often. Nice going!!
title should be:- iphone vs android - biased towards iPhone
Aaron next time take it as a debate rather than asking Marques for his opinions and adding points. The person who wins the debate decides which phone to give point to...would be more interesting to watch as well as more educational
Apple cryboy once again
Android reminds me of LeBron James. Always in the shadow, chasing the GOAT. Always will be it seems as well.
After getting my OnePlus 9 Pro I literally threw my iPhone in a creek
What are the dislikes on this video?  Most you've ever had?
This comparison is kinda useless: you are comparing a device against a software, which does not make sense...
The guy loves iphone 🤣
But the thing is you can download Google assostant on iPhone
20 min ad
There is a lot of different androids you should be specific. Samsung vs Apple
This looks like completely biased type decision
That intro "boom" sound blew my ears up bro lol... give me a warning next time lol
These are all opinions. We all have our varied opinions. So let's love what we love the most and what we think is the best
This video should be called "bending over for MKBHD". Seriously, you gave a draw for screen? at every price point, any Apple phone screen is objectively worse than what's available on numerous android devices. If he wants a flat screen so much, get an S22+. Same for cameras - the tech in cheaper Android phones DESTROYS even the highest spec. iPhone.  No mention of USB-C? You give Anti-repair Apple a draw on environment? this is embarassing coming from 2 such 'experts' in tech...
0:01 ANDROID WON! 🥳
Fanboyism towards Corporations, it's sthg that Apple took to another level and that ranks as fvcked up and dangerous as anything can be....we are living that world but trust me it still can be worse
Now reverse the roles. MKBHD asks Aron to know whats better in each category... The scores will favour more Android.
Damn these dudes are biased, what was the point of this comparison?Lame!
sensing a weird bias towards iOS … totally unexpected from MKBHD(you lost a subscriber)... cant comment about IOS as I have not experienced it but the development in Android have not been given due credit... myself using Android and totally happy with its utility...few things that earlier required me to go to the windows PC and do them the cumbersome way get done on the Android phone in the blink of an eye.  Availability of free and useful apps on the go make it so much more capable (except for video recording , editing or gaming where iPhone is superior) that I don't need an iPhone with its bugs and restrictions. Many people here don't even have home /personal access to PC or laptop but can get things done thanks to their budget android smartphone and that is of immense value any ways one looks at it. moreover the Google assistant, Chrome OS, Android Auto with google Maps and Android TV are damn good too (heck I am using Brave browser sideloaded on android tv that enables browsing internet like a PC with wireless keyboard and mouse). The maturity of the android platform is higher... only held back back by less capable hardware /silicon. sorry apple you aint getting a penny from my pocket... not yet...do get rid of the notch though..my eyes (used to oneplus 7 pro) feel it outdated even for an entry level device....ironic for a company with vast resources and legacy of innovation.
when u compare u should take someone more neutral, not him men🤣
OMG made the screen part a draw lmao no need to watch anymore because clearly they are biased and favour apple more, if Android phones have a better screen just say that no need to sugarcoat it
This was the most biased video I've ever seen from BOTH of you guys. I'm really disappointed. I feel like a ton of stuff was left out. What about USB-C vs Lightning, repairability, versatility, accessories. Hell even design choices...
I will still prefer Android over iOs, I just don't like how iOs works, Android feels more intuitive to me.
I don’t care what yaw say, these 2 are iPhone fanboys. There are so many things in android that blows iPhone out of the water.
Video sponsored by 🍎
I’m just happy to see both of you working together. Keep it up. And the fact that you both stayed up late, shows the respect ✊  Thanks
This video was no done right.  Apple should NOT get the point because he feels it should if you disagree maybe give them both a point in that case.  But apple has better screens even really!?!?!?
This is disappointing you guys .... As an android user, there are def points where we've got to concede to Apple. This just seems overtly biased imo tho. I wasn't subscribed to marques (many apologies for spelling) but now I def know why. I usually watch this channel pretty regularly, so Im def thrown off by this one .... Y'all didn't even try to defend Android and even went further by somewhat slamming android as a whole. All iPhones look the same bruhhhhhh vanilla af !!!!!! Where's the customization recognition ????? Idk I might sound loony bin but this was more of a shock than necessary really.
I feel like most of us that don’t like Android never have a really good Android we go based of cheap ones that we had  Bad experience on like of course iPhone would win  against a cheap Android
Honestly when I put it to perspective, android is backed by so many phone companies while  Apple is just one company. Of course the potential is unparalleled but considering the fact that android is where it is, it’s quite bummer since there is so much space for innovation. As a user of both, I always felt that the UI and UX was friendly, fast, easy. Just to do simple normal day to day tasks was a pain with android. While yes android gives customisation, just using an IPhone gives you a feeling that you cannot find anywhere, it just fits, and is all you need. Perhaps a mix between the two could perhaps be the product of the greatest phone to ever be made??
So just like all the other "Android VS IOS" videos on YouTube...the answer is, "it's your choice". 🤦 lol Android for life!!!
Massively larger population of the world use android and the features it offers helps hugely than iPhone which less limited features used by a less group of people who are rich or celeb. So, your opinion, only small group of people use android users use the features is very wrong.
I love how everyone is just crying and making their subjective points about how android is better, 😂
"Android vs. iPhone: Which is be-"   I DON'T F[]CKING CARE JUST LET ME PLAY GAME BOY GALLERY ON MY ANDROID PHONE JESUS
No offence...but....worst video on the channel yet
honestly there is a clear bias towards iphone. because some points should have been a point for android but was given as a tie.
That was awesome, two Kings having a chat. You guys should had a beer together. Thanks for the vid.
I agreed with pretty much all the categories. But I'm camp android because I chose to escape servitude! Apple kept me broke!
You should give scores individually without saying it out loud and at the end compared it all and take the arithmetic mean. That would make sens :(
camera, battery,  sound & reliability iPhone wins . If they had zoom like 22 ultra I'd only stick to iPhone. for my job purpose I use s22 ultra but for my personal use 13 pro
This guy is a fanboy of apple
For me when I take an android to my hand I feel like I’m a chimpanzee or a caveman. It’s tooo hard to operate. Tooo messy to find settings and stuff. You won’t believe I had to struggle few hours to find the mobile data feature. It’s complicated. On the other hand iOS is pretty simple.  But when it comes to assistance Google Assistant is best. It does more work than Siri. Sometimes I feel I’m missing out something when I work with Siri, but it does it work 99.99% times based on my usage
Siri works plenty well for me, but my interactions are mostly related to HomeKit and weather.
In my opinion , android is more advance and more task able, more flexible ,more inovative than ios. IOS is closed plateform where as android is open minded software and very vast..I love android..
I think mkbhd is not talking about pro features of android ..type c .ultra fast charging .government apps and zoom capabilities and why airdrop is given a point ...android can do nearby share with ease ...yes users have a problem in transferring photos from iPhone to android then its problem for iPhone not android....the only thing i  can say android give freedom and iphone want users should be in his control and marketing there product for there ecosystem
who wins if it comes to, user friendly, eco system friendly, innovative, hardware support, ports, file support, value for money, post sale support, pricing of spare parts.
I think you are babysitting Apples feelings here.
Android OS Can’t beat IOS
You seriously gave Apple the eco point with their proprietary port!!
bias. I'm disappointed, unsubscribed already
I have issues with this video. You pick android phones to make fair for Apple then pick apple as it does better. Sustainability was the worst for this. Android had the fairphone which beats apple. But your like that's not fair, we need to pick something else. I agree with a lot of stuff here but you spend more time comparing iPhones latest model to the s22 ultra not iPhones Vs android.
Kings of tech🙏🏾💯⚡️⚡️⚡️
My prayer everyday: Samsung now has it's own OS!
mkbhd is clearly biased for Apple. There are so many Android features not explained. Can't believe he would side up with Apple for many points.
nice video  vallathum kittumo
I am a simple man if it works I use it.
Biased, strange review... I hear the points and yet I don't give a flying rat about i-phones! I swear if someone gave me a new shiny iPhone, I'd most likely decline... If someone hinted that I could get new Vivo x80 pro I'd be all over them until I got it :) . So, there are certainly very good points about having an iPhone vs an Android device. But not for me!!! So, this review felt like ... blaaah... And Aaron just agreeing with everything felt wicked as well. This is how these weirdos chat at their World Economic Forums - always asking convenient questions and giving very lovely proper convenient  answers. Gag!
These guys were very biased. You can tell easily that they are apple fanboys
It’s hard to compare IPhone to Android due to the sheer number of android phones. Instead Samsung v. Apple should’ve been the actual test to have some form of continuity
Bullshit android is better
I don't feel this was objective, all the time was Iphone, Iphone, kiss, kiss, for the app that say that are irepleacable on Iphone I bet android can have an app that do the same, and other things like camera I was to shallow the answer to vote for Iphon,e there are greater cameras on android, and just because he forgot to save the picture is a no no is a joke because that will depend on the phone, I can take a picture with my huawei and it will save automatically, so i feel that this video is more like a Iphone comercial, I won't deny the camera or the battery, but there are alot of spects on the Iphone that are not as great as a samsung that where not take in to account
iphone vs Iphone says MKBHD
Since both of you are benchmarks for knowledge, competence and professionalism, this video was such a step back for both. I use both phones on a daily basis, and each OS has advantages, but such biased approach of Markez and passive response from Arun was not worth watching much further. Such a pitty. Best wishes from Belgrade, Serbia.
The video is competely biased..
I didn't expect Marques to be such an iPhone fan.
How much money did apple gave you for that? Just out of curiosity.
Totally can see where his loyalty is...
Bro gave everything to the iphone 🤣
I find this video greatly biased towards iPhone
I feel like this was Iphone vs Samsung
IPhones are 💩
Android for ever ♥️♥️
Features on android vs ios ending in a tie sounds like biased to me...it just does...cuz they're comparing flagships, and the MAIN reason why people buy flagship androids OVER iphones is actually the fact that they have WAY more features...
Honestly Samsung will just always get my vote. Apple is just a leach for money
what a biased discussion
MARQUEES, YOU ARE TRULY AN IPHONE FAN..BOY..LISTEN TO YOURSELF...
There is Impressive Feature called MIUI beta+ for windows and Chinese Android phones like Xiaomi, realme... Just like AirDrop Flawless!
iOS has been better at turning into android than android into iOS.
You are asking Questions to Wrong Person. He is an Apple Fan Boy...
When both iPhone supporters and Android supporters hear Mrwhosetheboss saying "it boils down to value if ANY" at 18:06 : SO MRWHOSETHEBOSS, YOU THINK THAT BOTH APPLE AND SAMSUNG HAVE NO VALUE!?!?!
You should collaborate with LTT on the same topic. They are more technical and specific on these subjects. It will be interesting
I think if this was made two or three years ago it would have ended quite different
For the "eco-friendly" thing, one note to take is that iPhone users will stay longer with their devices due to longer software update cycle.
IPhone doesn't even have a restart button 😳
So let me get this straight, you ask a iPhone user (MKBHD) if Android is better, we all knew what he was going to choose 🤣🤣🤣
Apple user. Android has the best third party software. I can even go into the developer menu and turn a Samsung into a Windows “mini” PC. I can make it use Linux or Ubuntu. There’s really no restrictions if you know what you’re doing. Apple has a great engineering and coding team to utilize every fraction of their own framework. That’s what sets it apart from android. In the great words of Todd Howard -“ It just works”. No matter how much I love customizing, I leave that to my PC. With my phone, I want structure and security. It helps when app developers make the iPhone fun to play with, apple doesn’t really make it fun, I think they know their strength lies in its software and engineering development.
Love the collaborations; big fan of your and MKBHD videos
nii
Apple FTW
Lol this was a mkhbd episode 🤣 to many wins to Apple
Having used an Android device for the last 7 years, I have dealt with so many weird issues that prevented me from doing something simple or strange bluetooth issues that I finally made the switch back to an iPhone in April with an iPhone 13.
Hey there, iPhone user here. I recently switched from my Samsung S9 over to the iPhone 12. I have been a big fan of Android for the longest time, but the reason I switched to iPhone is because of one single reason: conformity. Keep in mind this has nothing to do with peer pressure but the fact that I see people using iPhones almost everywhere nowadays. Whether it be during my work hours, going home and talking with my family or basically anything I do in my day to day lifestyle. It's just not reasonable to justify Android's amazing features to any iPhone user because most of them don't understand the hardware that they're running. It's easier to share pictures or videos with people using AirDrop and the list goes on and on for iPhone users. As for Android... well it's pretty much an Android. Anybody who watches these type of techy videos are already aware of all of Android's amazing capabilities for customization and so on. I understand that Apple charges up the rim for their products but I couldn't recall the last time my iPhone had a glitch in the matrix compared to even the most recent Android/Samsung devices. Honestly, I would love to see more of Android's features integrated with iOS's as well. Best of both worlds - Hannah Montana.
I think this comparison would be a ton closer if it were just Samsung vs Apple, in terms of phones. But, yeah, I agree. Even though I'm a firm believer that Android is usually a better choice, it is only better for those who can unlock the full potential of it, which most people don't know how to do or will even attempt to. And this is where Apple shines, for the average consumer that wants his tech to do things for him without him thinking about it or sweating it too much.
Disagree LOL it's bad but catching up and some things to it.... Nah! LOL
This is kinda more opinion based. I would definitely choose android for photos.
Why for the screen comparison you consider the average of android phones and then for iPhone you only look at the 13 pro and pro max instead of the average iPhones too? (no way you will have the "this is the smoothest screen ever" comment on regular iPhone 13 that doesn't have high refresh rate because any Android at the same price has at least 90hz)   Same for photography, only comparing the optimal case for the iPhone (quick to open the app and snap a picture on the flagship again) as the Victor while giving arguments in favor of Android (Android flagship has better end result, more flexibility on the camera app)  This seemed like since the video was recorded impromptu and in a rush it ended up being very biased unknowingly
MKBHD wan a fist bump if u notice 😂😂
This never seems to get old. The comments are funny and people are still butt hurt by what phone one thinks is better than the other. 🤦🏿‍♂️.
I was an Android user for years, decided to try my first iPhone and have not, will not look back ever again. There's just no comparison! The fluidity, the quickness of the OS is simply better on iOS, it does what I want to do with no problems or weird glitches.   I don't care about customizing stuff, 95% of the users almost never touch anything or won't switch things around for months if at all. And it's not only the OS, it's the support, the 3rd party stuff you can find for iPhones, Apple's customer care and so on
If you take iphones out of the few countries. Some of the use cases don't matter. Such as no one uses facetime or air drop.  Plus the battery life is good but not great and with poor charging speeds it really lags behind.   Also, in photo department, yes the photos are good. But the response for an Android pic would be more than the iPhone.  It is totally how you want it.   I have been using a poco F1 for long and the phone at just 20k rs. (barely 250 usd) got updated till last year. Had great camera hardware and with GCAM mod literally destroyed iPhone X which came at the same time.   Also, i firmly believe 500 usd has to be the sweet point for any flagship.
I use both apple and android…I prefer android…I don’t need these to tell me which is best..I watched 2 minutes then looked at the comments to guess they voted iPhone…then didn’t watch the rest…
We always knew mkhd was an apple guy
Android are easily repairable and cheaper to repair
Believe I respect you because I rather watch a black man video because them say thing straight forward so I watch your videos and I don't believe that you are being real you said you have being using a galaxy for a year so what exactly have you been using it to do over a iPhone that the question he should be asking you a iPhone charger is so expensive in other countries compared to android so when you're making video don't just think about your country and say it the best for all occasions.
Many of the reasons don't apply outside specific geographic areas, where Apple is dominant. I have very few friends that use iPhones, and they don't really use facetime, iMessages, airdrop and so on. Nobody misses those features because there are plenty of alternatives in the Android world to achieve the same result. The fact that you can choose things that fit you is the big draw of Android, at least for me.
Seemed more Marketing Call than comparison.
Switched to Apple from Android and was super bored with my phone for a while. Now I don't think I could go back, it's just way smoother.
Bro your not being real you're making the white boy sounding reasonable than you android is most use and important to poor communities for example the music on iPhone that you have to purchase a poor person appreciate android for that we can have all the songs movies in the world can iPhone do that without spending.
My look at phones is very straight to the point, If I bought it, its mine, that means I can do whatever I want with it, apple doenst allow me to do this, thats why I still cant see why I would buy iphone
6-7 ads in a video , video experience down my ass
"And today's video is sponsored by Apple"
High end apple > High end Samsung Medium end apple < Med end Samsung Low end apple < Low end Samsung  Can I get a witness?
I came here just to ask for a apple pie recipe!
This seem like apple paid for them
I used both an Iphone 12 and a OnePlus 7 pro for about 6 months and sided with android. I sided with android because typing and editing your typed text is a nightmare on iphone. I also left iPhone because it costs a lot more to have 128gb+ storage. The phone also charges slower. The battery life was long, but the screen was not smooth feeling with only 60hz. There is also no free blockada. The calculator app is so oversimplified stock. There are not back buttons (I prefer). No USB C.  Yes, android sometime suffers with battery life, app crashes too, glitches, etc, but I still prefer android (more specifically OnePlus).  When I got rid of the iPhone, I replaced it with a OnePlus 10 pro. I am happy with my choice. Also, the video is just about the same quality somehow.
MKBHD's decision was made up even before the comparison
This video was sponsored by apple 🍎🍎
This is totally a biased comparison 😥 at some points.
Me watching on a 100$ android
Display: iPhone Pro (if not Pro - Android is better) Performance: iPhone (especially "regular" iPhone) Battery: iPhone Photo: iPhone but it is personal preferences, tastes, etc. Pixel, Samsung - make great photos too. Video: iPhone Ecology: idgf Software: TIE, except the support Price: Android Value: iPhone
I was going to say you should take this video down from your channel as you will get a bad reputation out of this, But you probably can't since you have already been paid by Apple for the advertising. What an atrocious video,I'd be ashamed of myself if I were you two.
Obviously android since they are always way cheaper (sarcasm)
guys talking about androids overprocessing pictures brings me to the question why does my girlfriends iphone doubles my gray hair always ... it's far away from real .... and my samsung s10+ is perfect in that case :) ... not kidding
Actually samsung and Vivo x80 pro Is better than iphone. Mkbhd is actually apple fan boy. 🤣 That's why he give it points. Vivo is better in third party app camera also. Im an android user. Yes . I used iphone as well. But some people will reply to my comments about u don't have money to buy iPhone poor boy, that's why ur saying android is better . 🤣... Dude........ Samsung and huaweii costs way more than iphone. So i think u don't have money to afford an android flagship 🤣 beggars
imo it's kinda stupid to compare android phones to iphone. you could, say, compare ios to android or some particular android phone to some particular iphone, but android phones range from phone to phone, so this comparison is incorrect.
Started watching this - first topic - screen.  The argument for android seems much stronger clear win for android right? Nope it's a draw....  Ok this is gonna be a hard fight for android to win :D
Android people are not gonna like this one lol
Apple always have scummy battery sizes and ram , for the price not to mention apple phones are designed to very easily smash the screen
In the end, it is all very subjective. I wonder if iPhone would be this popular if most of the user weren't getting them for free on their phone contract?
I feel like whenever they say something about Android, they drag it to additional things and add the point to iphone or share the point when Android wins.. 🤨
Very interesting indeed.
I’m an iPhone user but I think the results would be way closer if you pick a specific device vs device comparison. It was interesting to see you guys that clearly prefer android declare Apple the winner.
There are too many commercials in this world. Bye.
technically your comparision is wrong. you are comparing a phone(iphone) with an OS (android) . you should be comparing iphone with samsung or other phone makers or better still you should  compare the IOS with ANDROID OS.
I massively respect Marques as all his opinions are rational and insightful. I even stuck with the S21 Ultra for the exact same reasons - particularly the fact that the S21 and S22 are effectively the same phone.
The only reason I am using apple 13 pro max is because they took my Note line away I am very very Sad.
Two of apple eco system users review which is better apple or android🧐
Yeah..I get that it all boils down to personal preference but the margin is way too partial and tilting towards the iPhone
Amazing to see you both together commentary.  This is a great episode.  Love it.
I am ok with my 200$ redmi
It felt like an apple promotion video !
the display of iphone is from samsung right?
Android fans please expect the least, lol
No mention about security or privacy?
Android phones aren't even real. They don't exist. It's all a conspiracy.
U r biased . U r paid agent of i phone
Using android because I'm neck deep in google services. But gaming is so much smoother in Ipad.
This is pure comedy. I have mad respect for MKBHD. But this seems like this was paid by Apple. The iPhone has some things that I like but Android overall has better functionality.
with all respect for iphone users but Samsung s22 ultra has a s pen 🖊  that they never talk about , and has 100 x zoom 😅   5000 mh battery  12 gb ram   and android has many options available to use with another devices   I'm with Samsung galaxy S22 ultra
Restrictions or no Restrictions i choose no Restrictions if your ok with paying for everything the iphone is for you
This one is more about the iPhone than Android. In my opinion, a lot was missed about Android.
I use a sub woofer and this video's first second timestamp was a boom.
Latest topest highest end android phone camera app still lags
Android is best. I have Samsung Galaxy m21. 600mAh battery  48mp camera. 64gb ram
Interesting! The topic is a bit ambiguous because you’re comparing not just one android phone to the iPhone. It’s unfair to both sides imo. Because saying android vs iPhone really is saying windows vs MacBook. If that's the case there's no reason for instance when you talk about eco consciousness and later downplay what fairphone is doing because "it is not a flagship" but you know that it’s an android smartphone.
Very nice content and especially with 2 of the best outhere in the field 🌞😉😁😇 Thank-you kindly
So in a nutshell, you boys spent 20 minutes rephrasing & restructuring generic questions until the only remaining choice, was iPhone - you should have just put that in the title.
i love when you guys collab
The other guy loves android , so he’s saying no where the android beats the iPhone than pricing 🤔
Such a biased comparison (at certain area/parameter), maybe you guys should be more neutral
Watching this in my phone 12 while it reboot it self  lol…..
Very biased comparison
Most clever people get work to purchase their smartphone.
Gotta love seeing fanboys from either side crying
People wake up YouTuber gets paid to talk about apple product, I use both and Samsung phone is way better.
IPhone fan boy on the left
How can you talk about eco-friendliness without mentioning right to repair?
Definitely you two guys payed by Apple. just advertising Apple product there is many good android devices which can do way better than iphone.
I remember when I used to trust you guys
You going good wish you higher possession
the guy on the left is a big iphone fan geek lol
S22 ALTRA  ALDAY
Unsubscribed and unfollowed Mkbhd after watching this video. Seemed like it was Craig Federighi talking, not Mkbhd.
Iphones -> yesterday's technology at tomorrow's price
This is a biased and apple sponsored video.
Apple is a showpiece for high-class people same thing you can get those features in android at an affordable price. when we use the android gaming experience, battery backup,  affordable and unique variety of ranges, In an android charger, is given but Apple does not provide us after paying huge amount 🤣. So I prefer Android.
Na .... s22 ultra all day
They did not mention about Android's freedom, modded apps, faster and smoother animation ( or you can turn the animation off for faster animation) Android is much more simpler and cost less, I don't care about securities if you're gonna say about iPhone, I have an iPhone and android and I EASILY prefer to use android in my daily life. Wake up people, you haven't travelled Android as far as I am. 😈
Apple
Well then you can do more on android then you do on iPhone. Emulation out of the box is one of the major factors why I wanted android to begin with. Being able to play almost ever console under the sun including switch which actually is making huge strides for emulation on android. Having the ability manage files and change the operating system as well. It’s a fully fledged pocket computer.  iPhone will never compare to what android phones can do and how maluable android is.
FOR THIS APPLE PROMOTION , HOW MUCH U GOT BRO ??
I don't think I'll ever buy an iPhone. It's way too expensive for what it offers. There is nothing I can't do with an android that I could do with an iPhone. Not just the fact both are quite similar, but also Apple's predatory tactics to get people stuck in their ecosystem to continue buying their products.
this is biased bullshit... first time i dislike a video
That was Marques opinion. I love apple only for one thing, Security. That's it
Hey, I think you Forgot  "Sponsored by Apple"  Video was a piece of shit Arun  Remove it from your channel   Never do this with a super biased Apple fanboy like MKBHD   Even you prefer IPhones but you atleast try sometimes to be neutral   You are biased sometimes but it is usually not too bad    MKBHD just doesn't even try to look unbiased   That's why you got a dislike but he got an unsubscribed
I have never had a phone update that has been beneficial. I feel like every time a phone updates, apple or android the phone slows down, text prediction gets worse, voice typing gets worse, battery gets worse, more bugs, more crashes. If it let me never update... I would sick with the one that came out of the box
Look at that clap thts gansta fusion mate
Sorry, review is clearly Apple Fan biased.
Never heard a single iPhone user saying that their battery lasts longer. IPhones have the best camera hands down, but I always knew that iPhones have the worst battery in any phone. Interesting. 🤔
imessage and facetime basically don't exist outside the US, so calling them "massive pillars" is a bit much.. Same for Airdrop - plenty of alternatives.
I like how unapologetic MKBHD is about liking Android and just being overly impressed with Apples branding of fairly banal features other companies has had for years.
Why compare androids? That's not fair. Too broad..
Download is different
This is big cap I'm both phones fan but Samsung is clear I feel like your guys were biased
Disaster
Biased
I enjoyed watching the video, hope to see more of such collaboration videos between Mr Whose the boss and MKBHD
Why does mkbhd look like he is feeling awkward
lol
"a whole year old" my phone is from around 2015-16
Wow, that's more like apple fanboy compares iPhone to Android. If all this was true everyone would be using iPhones instead of Samsung Ultras. But why do I and other Ultras users don't switch?
Apple already is carbon neutral across it’s global operations
Why i phone bro
So actually they are saying that one Company that is Apple takes down multiple huge tech giants like Samsung,Xiaomi,Huawei, Pixel, BBK all alone?Very biased video and examples in this video lol
When my wife got the her first iphone, her first ask was: "hey honey, how can i set an mp3 for example from my google drive as a ringtone?" me:   :) I'd never change my Note20 for an iphone.
This is not the correct depiction of android. A very biased review. @Mrwhosetheboss We are dissapointed.
Very one sided biased video, the fact, flown to California with the glimpse of Cupertino at beginning with mkbhd (apple fan) this was sponsored by Apple
Ok this dude is clearly iPhone biased. Even when the iPhone under performs or does something wrong he says yes but he prefers it when its like that... What. I have an iPhone 13 pro for my work phone, and it is incredibly slow. Every time I have to load a webpage or unlock the phone, or open camera from the locked screen, it feels like it takes forever. And I have tried to play games on it and it's choppy as fuck. But i have a oneplus 10 pro as my daily and a oneplus 7t pro McLaren as my backup/shitter phone and even the oneplus 7t pro is faster than the iphone. I can run 4k games and get higher fps than with my iphone 13 pro, or quickly whipping out the phone to take a quick picture, double tap power and hit the volume button... Click photo taken. I phone i dont even bother taking the phone out, i know im going to miss the monent. Iphone just suck at a lot of things... But video recording, uploading media, youtube and facebook etc are superior on the iphone  i dont understand how i can take a 5 min video and send it to a friend and its only 200mb and looks great, where as any of my android phones take 2 mins of video, over 1gb file size and doesnt even look as good? Thats about the only thing the iphone is better at... Other than that its a slow piece of junk
S22ultra will always be worse 🤡🤡🤡😂😂😂
Battery 🔋 of iphones you know from the start still iphone wins 😁 I see iphone obsessed people
Maybe I am part of minority but having a dedicated work profile is so thoughtful and useful in Android. I can easily turn it on and off all the apps at one go. I ended up sold my iphone 13 pro max and went back to my pixel 4a 5G. iPhone did retain the resale value and it has amazing battery life.
This video is biased Your taking to iPhone only🤨🤨
Nooooooo... whyyyy...? You were the chosen ones...
All star teck reviewers
But the iphone don't  have 100x ultra zoom camera😏
mr. boss please never sellout to apple. im going to unsub from MKBHD dam sellout
I've never become a fan of Iphone
hi mkbhd how much 💲did you get from apple 😂💩
A fan from South Africa I must say this interview was very bias. The questions asked were one sided, meaning of course the apple fan will agree to those type of questions. If the questions were better formulated, (no offence) we all know who would of won by a long short. Let's take the most underrated and controversy brand for an example, LG; innovative, bold and spontaneous (not cause I'm currently using the LG V60 thinQ). Always something new to the table, and like you say their marketing were not up to standard. LG Wing can take on iPhone solely and still earn more points than iPhone. That's my 2 Cents compared to the legends on the video.
Android is more dynamic. It has options like MicroSD expansion, folding screen, super fast charging, to name a few. Apple is using stability as an excuse not to open out and focus on profitability I think.
Apple  advatisement
iPhone iPhone users will be happy because apple sponsored this video don't believe iPhone is better than Android even if someone gives me iPhone for free don't want I don't like I prefer Samsung this video is a scam don't believe it
This was not a fair comparison. 😕  the way you guys setup the questions, it's setup to give iphone the upper hand.
They’re Pure brothers.
this video is design to boost iphone. if iphone was on the only phone in the world id use a rock. the most boring team to watch is the best one.. when did he sell out to apple??? bull shhhht
what you want is software and open that all we care about. iphone is trash
I phone buyed you bro
arun: so which phone do you .... marques- oh its iPhone without a doubt
For people who still have fun or let's say geek out about their tech, people who enjoy more customization, making it their own or being into trying new designs and aesthetics, for those who may really dig into specific features, a small example is I still own a OnePlus phone because of the multiple profiles feature, I haven't seen that in any pixel, Samsung or iPhone but you also have something like Samsung Dex which is amazing, but in the video they state it perfectly, these types of users are simply the minority now. Iphone users don't know about half of the features certain android manufacturers offer, but why would they care, majority of them aren't going to be tech enthusiasts and still look for built in MP3 audio players etc.   The iPhone is a really reliable well polished and extremely user friendly experience that focuses less on fun from the tech itself and moreso how well the tech nuances the common user experience aka air drop, facetime etc and things like better optimization with social media. Now given the trade off of truly maximizing that experience is only going to happen inside the apple ecosystem and in that way again I still love hooking up my OnePlus to my windows laptop and literally dragging and dropping a photo album in or out and it automatically being sorted into my gallery. THIS JUST DOES NOT HAPPEN ON APPLE but for me being someone who has external drives for videos and photos it's so easy not to mention expandable storage some Android phones still offer vs being forced to either spend way more for extra storage or have to put all of your personal content into a cloud system you pay for monthly. Airdrop is nice, but at the end of the day not all my devices are apple and with android most file formats are supported and sharable.
Apple eco friendly? That must be a joke 😂. They removed chargers from the box so they can save on shipping cost due to small boxes and now you have to buy charger separately (that's another box and potentially another shipping costs and additional carbon footprint.) How is that eco? Some Android phones starts to do the same and it is in fact the same  - cool story to squeeze extra bucks from users without actually caring about environment.
Translate features for Android (Pixel). I have been thinking of moving to iPhone as I use a Mac and iPad, but I also travel a lot and speak with friends overseas a lot and the real time translator in texting and also voice and photo translators are just a god send. It is enough for me to be hesitant moving despite the advantages of one system.
Apple sponsored?
Here come the fanboys. I have both one for work and one for personal use. It's all choice. I prefer Samsung, I'm used to it and it's way more customizable and I actually use desktop search settings and split screen a ton. Both have unique features. But everyone bashing android for folding phones and saying it's all gimmicks. Listen Apple is legit bringing stuff to their phones that Samsung had 5 years ago and you guys eat it up. If Apple launched a folding phone you fanboys would drool over it. I do like certain Apple features that I wish android would adapt. Sending photos and videos with Imessage looks better and I know you can the features that the I message uses with android 3rd party apps. But let's be real majority of people don't download 3rd party apps for their android. I don't understand why Samsung wouldn't have the same thing when texting Samsung to Samsung like Apple
I use splitscreen 70% of the time
Its crazy one sided review... cmon
Is apple green or blue?
Bro their voices are so soothing tf😳
Putting Android under one category just doesn't work these days. Samsung and Google are so far ahead of other Androids, but get dragged down by them. If this was between Samsung Galaxy S series and iPhone, then it would be much closer.
-Iphones cut edges where they can and still will ask a ridiculous price. Most androids have very good allround things in it and cost 1/4 of an iphone. -They are no where near in any category of all androids. The display is maybe a 6/10 at best compared to high end androids. The size and the notch should never win any comparison. -The camera is not on the level anymore with the pixel and samsung cameras. even more so after the pixel 7 will drop.  -The battery charging time is just bad.   The bias from 2 of the biggest tec ppl of the internet is insane. Dont understand it.
This comparison is flawed. A remake will be needed at some point.
Sir please can u do a review on OnePlus CE 2 lite 5g
Ok, im poor, 200$ phone for the next 5 years so...
3gb of ram on the iphone, feels like 8gb of ram  on the android. Cap 😂
Am i the only one who noticed that 2-3 times in the video they discussed good things about Android eg. Google assistant being better but didn't add a point for it. But as soon as they said something about iPhone point is added or a 0.5 was given on both sides.
Can u pls do a reaction of ur old vids ? Pls
Biased af.
Worst video ever, clearly biased
This is actually a bad idea to do a video on this topic,  but never expected MKBHD @Marques Brownlee to be so biased, even though all these years his awards are majorly going to android phones. MKBHD sorry man you lose my trust, so goodbye from your ex- subscriber.
Sleep more  Android is far more better than iphone  For guys Just to have a phone and do nothing much you can have a iphone because you can't do much in iphone compared to Android   For some people who wants freedom , change of os , customise total phone . Who wants to make fun Android is far better
feels very biased and not reliable. Especially after the videos of the best phones for 2022 so far that contradicts this comparison completely.
Money 💵 is the greatest factor here especially in SEA region 🌚so in here Android wins
u guys cheating the samsung won samsung has many good features tht u ignored
We can create different worlds between ios world and android world. IPhone is a legendary legacy no competition other side compare android with androids not IPhone. 👌👍
I use split screen ... I'm upset it was modified to a hovering screen rather than a proper split
I know MKBHD is an apple fanboy so expected it to be biased
I use split screen frequently. Also, the notch?
i saw the 2nd point of multitasking how well Samsung does it that ios cant and how you guys gave points which is so stupid...i understood where this video is going so stopped right there...i can see if they talk about dex mode in it they will say it is nothing because i wont use it..so no points, i only use imessage, so will give points for that, other messaging app doesnt matter, i can expect these kind of points here...if you dont use useful features how they actually review phone as a daily driver is now my question...
Feels biased towards Apple. Android wins majority rules
Can you make a video on Iphone camera improvements?
Yall was being biased against Android. It should have had a few more points than that.
Problem with this is they're talking about random android phones, and not a specific one
These guys were paid by Apple 🍎👀
Lmao, Android peeps are mad.
I had android my whole life ,bought a 13 Pro max the other , yes great battery life and camera but the interface user it's so fucking old and lame, definitely regret buying one
Android is better in every thing
why does this feel like iphone promotion video?
Mkbhd must changed his channels name to apple fanboy
mrwhosetheboss uses the male Siri voice. That's all I needed to know
Actually in my country. Either phone is ok, but Iphone is priced way way higher relatively to even Samsung's phone, especially 3-6 months after launch, the difference is even more obvious.
Samsung makes screens for iPhone and somehow, the iPhone has a better screen that the latest and greatest from Samsung!!! 💀... the bias in this video is next level.
"How biased can u be??"  Them: YES.
This was Excellent! I expected Marques to lean more towards Android, wow was I wrong.
Is this a Apple promotion video or some what, felt like this watching this video 😐, It's like after Apple event promoting Apple & degrading Android 🥴, Customisation seriously Apple is the choice 🥵, Apple just added a custom lock screen in 2022, Android from its existence had customisation in everything.
I love all your videos and i learn alot about our techs... I wish i could have a decent phone not like im the one using..
I love apple phones, but I can’t stand ios, and how it locks you in.
I had iphone for 12 years. I finally switched basically because they're boring. They're clearly the best phones. But they're boring. Same experience every year. And I hate how apple made me feel trapped in their world. I really love android now, I may go back to apple one day, but no time soon. It's been 2 years, had a galaxy s20+ and then a pixel 6 pro since launch. I may try another galaxy the next time. Then maybe by then apple will be a little different and I can come back. As of right now, Android is winning for me.
I don't feel like this rating is fair It just feels like iPhone sponsored video  .  *Every first time feel like this while watching a video in this channel *Android is a Linux based OS that can do a lot of things that no one even knows *File sharing  *Flexibility *Use a lot of features in an economical way  *Both cameras have their own pros and cons * Only in processor and software wise iPhone having an edge
Android is sea, iOS is just a big aquarium. Now it's your choice, either you really want to free or just be caged.
Okay I'm getting myself an iPhone
My Samsung S20 ULTRA 5G is better than any iPhone past or current. And this comment will hold true for years to come.
snapdrop on android ;) it's airdrop for android.
Chekante channel ill vanit nyc ayit pani koduthit poyi mkbhd  He didnt even give best phone award to 13 pro or max and avida irunn kona 🥂
Android can get free apps.. like adobe..and Ms word.. in iphone you have to pay everything
Man multiwindow is a life saviour nd u guys don't use it:- LOL
i agree, the camera on the iphone is much more reliable.
i never use the split screen on iphone. it makes me more productive using the whole screen for one app instead of two sqaured apps
This video is so amazing. And y’all talked about this without someone getting mad. Lol
I'm a Samsung user but definitely the iPhone is the best out of the box phone, it just works and works really great to say something bad about it
This felt very baised.
Oh my God he was playing  genshin impact
Bull shit apple suckers
Why don’t you guys tell that the iPhone sounds drops compare to the android while shooting in the main camera lense .
How much did Apple pay you & how much did Google pay you😂
In my opinion I really hate this video Other people hate it too So it's not just me It was clearly biased to apple Like you see android win  Buy nah they give a point to apple  Or they count it as a "draw"  Even at the end of the video  Android has a clear win  But mrwhosetheboss said draw haha  What are you guys doing to your channels  People's opinion is matter  You can't just "win to apple"  And expect us to say yes
You did not put Privacy as a category which would be another huge win for iPhone.
So who held them both at gun point to go in favor of IOS even though in quite a lot of segment android would have a fair margin of win or atleast a draw
Everything about that Collab was cringe
🍏 fanboiis
Who’s the boss has a better microphone 🎙
I dont think that its that the Iphone just works all of the time but it works most of the time. Like a vast majority to where when something does pop up it feels like a one off. When I had an android i felt plagued by the ram being over worked on the phone and overheating etc . (This was a recent samsung flagship)
What the hell, if u guys get paid from apple it is only good for u, but don't say apple is the best, maybe its best for you guys, but don't defame other brands, they are providing their best budget friendly devices, even apple buying parts from samsung and u guys saying apple is the best, this is the worst video i have ever seen in YouTube
Camera and display should have been full points for the s22 ultra.  The correct score is 5,5 iPhone vs 4,5 Android
Mkbhd 😄 collab with iphone 😄😄,, battery iphone?? 🙄😄
NICE  AWES0ME KEEP_IT_UP! ✨🎉✨🎉✨🎉🎉🎎🎭🎎🎭🎎🎭🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑✨🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎀🎀🎀🎀
This video is proof that even tech enthusiasts like MKBHD and Arun can have favorite regardless of the actuality of that product. For me everything that Apple does for them Android  does for me . Even their Ecosystem.
Something I didnt hear in regards to value..Trade in Value.. in my personal case I still use an iPhone X.  My current trade in value with my carrier is 800 when I checked last month.  In my android background that would has never happened.  Perhaps an over looked metric
Wow, two of my favorite tech guys in one show?!   Crazy.  More, please.
This Video is Totally Crap and Bullshit according to you there is no point of buying Android Flagships, just see the score difference man.
facetime???? people dont use wechat/kakao/line????
I used to have a Windows Phone, after that I moved to Android starting with LG, then Samsung but once I owned the first one plus one, I decided I wouldn't get anything but a clean android experience. so even since then I've been using Nexus and now Pixel phones. but I did use an iPhone SE 2nd Gen for about a year. didn't hate it but also didn't like it as much as android. now I'm using Pixel 6 and I'm ok with my decision. most of it has to do with apps and the fact lighting cables brake so freaking fast.
only CU CKS are carbon neutral
Y'all would rather have slow charging on an iPhone over fast charging on an android? Like charge 15 mins to get 50% charge instead of 45 mins to get the same charge? Insane
To me android wins by lil my opinion iPhones are Just a beefed up pixel wit a few cuts bks
Siri sucks. Apple notifications are atrociously bad. iOS has a huge hill to climb when it comes to notifications. I personally live in my notification shade on Android. When I use my iPad I don't even bother with the notification shade. It's a total mess. Apple's autocorrect is ridiculously aggressive and inaccurate. iMessage is bloated. The list goes on...  This discussion was designed to favour Apple. Even when Android clearly should have gotten a point they would throw in some BS thing to make it a draw or make it a win for Apple. The categories themselves were made to be biased against Android. And sorry, iPhone users are constantly chasing down a plug to charge their phone. My three year P30 Pro is still a battery champ.   And I'm sorry, but did MKBHD really pull out the "my grandmother could set up widgets and a lockscreen on the iPhone" nonsense? Come the eff on. Did I just time travel back to 2012? Because that's about the last time that argument was at all relevant. Customizing iOS is no more easier than Android. My mom has full control over her Samsung. In fact, iOS is a little clunky with how you customize your homescreen. Regardless, that is such a garbage and lazy talking point. Jesus...
apple = you can do what steve jobs wanted only so nothing else. android = cool things
Mkbhd get out here
In real day to day life nobody really cares which phone they are using
I will die with android in my pocket.
Arun is so articulate about his choices... Marques sounds apple leaning ... "I just oddly like it"🤷🏼
I really can't stand this mrwhosetheboss guy. This whole discussion was totally slanted to Apple. If an Android positive was mentioned douche would say "but facetime and iMessage". This was a waste of time. MKBHD has dropped for me as well. He's a Tesla/Elon Musk rat.
How much Apple paid MKBHD? 🤭👀
Memory handling IOS wins hands down.  Germit kernel is superior.
I have both 13 pro and S22.  Without any extra thoughts on the features or anything… I honestly use my Samsung way more but I think both phones are top notch… I’ve noticed flaws in my Samsung, I’ve also noticed flaws in the iPhone so…
Forget android compare with pixel I want to give reviews
THAT WAS A PRETTY BIASED OPINION IN FAVOUR OF IPHONE. NOT EXPECTED FROM MKBHD & MRWHOSETHEBOSS !!
Even the word dent has a dent on it😅
I honestly really like the point of Android having a ton of features that a couple of people really care about. There's just a bunch of things I've gotten used to that I would really miss were I to jump over to the iPhone, even though I know most people don't care about those things at all. Surprised Android's immense superiority in regards to notifications wasn't mentioned at all though.
Brownlee was speaking like he was on behalf of iphone
I really hate samsung curve edges,  the edge always detect my palm  and I have to use a case with it.
I know it's just your opinion, but it seems biased!
I feel like one thing y'all didn't consider (or maybe you did and just didn't address it) is that this is like Coca-Cola vs every other soda. It's not fair. All of the low quality sodas are going to sway the score towards Coca-Cola. You gotta put flagship against flagship, not "iPhone vs Every other phone"
Sorry to say, but this was like two salesman talking and not two objective reviewers!
Is that an iPhone ad ?
As much as I love both of ur content & find them very informative but yet can't wrap my brain around how iPhone display scores draw compared to android such as Samsung...common dude 🙆‍♂ I feel sometimes too much technicality blurs the clear straightforward facts... 🕵‍♂
Much prefer the ability to work with Android, Nest Home, Microsoft, and Samsung creativity on one phone. I have the Z Fold 3, S Tab, Nest Hub Max  and Galaxy watch 4. Everything works together.
I wonder why MKBHD never gives iPhone the best phone award? This video stinks.
iPhone loses to me because the lack of usb-c, costs of repairs, fighting with customer rights to repair the owned device, prices, lack of fan mods and fan support, ugly notch,  stupid practices that ridicule the whole smartphones industry (notch, popping out cameras). Pricey accessories and invasive accessories or incompatibility practics, impracticality in poorer countries (which are many)
My first and most important criterion would be how ethical are the practices of the company. I will not support unethical practices no matter how good the product is!
I feel like Apple's development hackers paid this video...
Don't forget that iPhones didn't survive the pgtalal storie on Instagram, and most androids survived
Nice iPhone commercial.
I didn't even take the  time to watch the hold video because I know they would both put apple over everything 🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Biased
Mkbd was biased towards Apple
How surprising! Apple fanboys say iPhone is better than android. this video is pure BS everything was extremely biased i wouldn't be surprised if apple payed for this iPhone ad.
apple s customization is shitty
Incoming angry android fans
Bruuuh, they did Android so dirty, whenever it gets a point, they split it, or just bring a feature on ios that nobody uses it, and then give ios the point 🤣
Timely Video! The only reason I can still buy in iPhone is because it has more promise for better and ground-breaking innovation going forward than the Android spectrum.
android is better because it's not apple, no matter what apple puts into their tech, it's still apple and they are run by non human demon rather than human beings, they make choices for you, exploit your stupidity and brand loyalty, abuse your privacy, manipulate you and the shape of their phone sucks. apple makes great tech, but apple is rotten to the core, like as a company i couldnt ever buy anything apple, andi would sell or give away any free apple products i was given.    my first experience with apple was an ipod shuffle, like the first one, before the phones and all that stuff, i hated how absolutely stupid difficult and irritating it was to move mp3 files from my pc to the shuffle, i threw it in the trash and never looked at apple products again, because they never changed, in fact they got worse, they force you to use their apps and programs, you have no control over your own tech, you cant fix them, they didnt give you removeable storage because they want you to use their crappy cloud that gets hacked every few years, i could go on all day about why i dislike apple as a company. android i'm sure is also run by sub human demons greedy and corrupt, but at least they give me control of my own tech that i just spent 1200$ on. at the end of the day, i would like my phone to be mine, i would like free apps in the app store to be free
Really wish Samsung would leave android and have their own OS. It would really be a game changer 🙌
I love you both as YouTubers, and fellow tech geeks, this "Ft." is amazing! Go you two! @mkbhd @mrwhostheboss
The iPhone can't even allow the user to place the icons anywhere on the homescreen. The is good is you want to deal with simple things, if you want to do a lot more... Android is the option and that is why is the main OS, has the biggest market share. Samsung already added swap memory, now we don't need root for that... is another thing not yet available on iOS. Granting other level of permissions over ADB is an option to allow other great things on Android, on iOS you will get what Apple allows.   Android has too much, and for that reason there are people that believes Android is complicated. If you just open and close apps, and you don't do anything more, is not complicated.
iPhone cant be matched in; Siri is flawless when spoken and used to do calls text listening etc, ecosystem ftw, fluidity operation and development, camera/video is industry flagship with Sony sensors, reception antennas; above all, customer service.   Samsung can’t be beat in; the worst customer service possible, screens are vibrant, fast charging, settings, available apps and ways to download, privacy invasion, and insecurities, they are some of the sexiest looking devices. Aside from the hole punch cameras that are tacky to look at, thankfully there are apps like nacho notch to hide it.   I use both. For different reasons. Unbiased opinion off experience, android needs updating, the entire platform is old. I’d classify it about 7 years behind iOS.  I like the app options tho. No question who is the boss here. iPhone wins every time if only they had a better app selection and store, it’s their pitfall.
Damn, some salty comments in here. Guys you hurt a lot of android fans feelings. This is their best phone guys. It doesn’t have to be yours too. Reasonable minds differ.
This is still very opinionated. Not much of a factual win but an opinionated win in some cases. Still a decent video ngl
I don't know, seems biased to iphone.
That was totally unfair against android
Taking a feature and make it better. For iPhone, u called it an improvement. For Chinese phones, u called it stealing.
I got a iphone but there a Apple fan on here and putting android down, Samsung phones are reall good too
This video is annoying
Who knew MKBHD would of picked Iphone? 😏🤷🏽‍♂️
this was purely subjective !
This is more like interviewing Iphone fan boy video.
In terms of performance and battery iphone hands down. For everything else Android
Android is doing a great job, multiple apps or crypto projects such as gateio use the android app and its compatible.
you guys know that both screens are made by samsung right
Yeah this was a biased video. So many weak points of iphone that were never discussed. (USB-C port (which is mentioned by both of you guys on plenty of videos), memory card slot, headphone jack (although dwindling), foldable phones, google photos outclasses iOS photo app by a mile, reparability, etc.) Lots of points missed which are huge in considering some of the evaluation topics. I still expected iphone to win, but the score difference showed the lack of points discussed in the video. A bit disappointing.
totally bias
People lets understand, that these guys aren't saying one is better than the other. They're saying that they like what they like and for these reasons.
Personaly i would like to have an iPhone as a secondary phone. But I would never replace my s22 ultra completely. Android feels like having an actual computer in my pocket. While the iPhone is just a really good phone but very limiting. For basic people iPhone offers the best value especially with its updates and support.
I have only two words.  Fan Boy 🙂  Not saying that android phones are much better then Iphone, but there was somethings that are not true at all  Thats why i enjoy to see Mrwhosetheboss videos, he is quite neutral in relation to the reviews unlike other youtubers
this comparison is super rubbish , the guy donot even know the technical facts he is talking like iphone paid him to do it ,  iPhone they took to compare with The highest they got in Iphone series and in Android for Samsung ? the whole world knows Samsung phones are not at that level where other Android Manufacturers are,dont they Dare to challenge One plus  , RpG, Google Phones , no coz they know these phone will kick iphone till it die
I watch both these guys all the time this video was very entertaining. But you can definitely tell from jump this leaned towards iPhone no matter what...it's funny they say what matters about android phones is only to a small group not sure how that's true if iPhone is really only big in the US....IMESSAGE and FaceTime  MEANS NOTHING TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE US. (Get whatever phone is great for you...I use Sansung Dex alot for work so the s22 Ultra is going to be my choice as the best phone)
Who else got a iPhone ad while watching this
iphone lack of memory, it sucks.  I need to switch back to android.
LOVED THIS VIDEO!!! 😃🍿👏🏼
All the test numbers are not counted in the real world. What matters are two main features of a smartphone display and handling plus specific functions. With fold phones, android has destroyed ios reputation of innovation.
Were is the charger 3mm audio battery drain when coming the new one etc I am not going to privacy because is none 😑 😢
The greed behind Apple is enough for me NEVER to buy one.
Android is the best no question about it this your opinion not the rest of the world
I don't think they will be very fair to android
Go Android. Apple is like one of those reclusive billionaires. Slow and full of themselves. I'll never buy an IPhone.
To me android is the master of camera shots 💯
hey mr.boss do you have a nother chanal named tellagram@realmrwhostheboss
This is more like the Messi Vs Ronaldo battle 😂
Two Goats 🔥✌🏽
Please do more videos together, I really enjoyed this!
Is this me, or this comparison look like advert for iPhone and iOS. As far as I know all people are different and only Android can deliver best experience to every  individual person. And for me personally this is the most important feature in existence if we have to compare Android vs iOS. iPhone just give you status .  Android world can give you everything if you know what you want, mix match of everything you need and more, price point from 10$ to 2500$ , open ecosystem for everybody. iOS will be better if someday become open operation system as Android.
Team iphone I see interesting like when people or a website says fact-check. It's make me think the opposite and double down and question eveything .
Worst video ever. Totally ignored the capabilities of Samsung. You don't ever ask an iPhone head to compare iPhone vs Samsung
Unfollow
I think colabing with MKBHD was a bad idea because  he just let him choose and he was a gaint apple fanboy and there where so many faktors they didnt consider
i've been wanting an android with the flat sides like the latest iphones (and 4 / 5) for so long
However customization went to the iphone would never make sense to me... Battery too? Reparability? I understand that preference is subjective, but I still think it is somehow biased I'm giving this video a downvote   It was a collab we thought we needed, but frankly do not
Extremely iPhone biased. There were too many things that Android does better, or can do that an iPhone cannot that were conveniently ignored.
MKBHD is one of those iphone die hard fans there are all brainwashed
Other than the best in market, the choice totally depends on best you can afford
You guys didn't think this through before posting,  you guys just did video and talkkkkk You guys miss out on a lot of Android advantages
My aha moment was when MKBHD talked of the vibrator, on the S22. I've been missing a lot of calls too and that is really annoying.
Love you both guys but this time you didn't do justice for Android from the tech point.  I don't know what happened to mkbhd he wants everything to be apple and that really frustrates me now because I'm watching him from past 7 years and he was not like this before.
The one thing that keeps me from an iPhone is Siri.  I have found Google to so smooth and easy to use.  Can I put a Google Search widget on the iPhone?
I think this video has to be redone cuz ,It look like iphones good factors were used against samsung, This ain't fair to the Samsung fam man,Samsung got much good factors too man, You didn't give the point for the assistant too😭
Just switched to my first iPhone (13 Mini) because I just can't deal with the huge phones nowadays. My life has been a misery ever since...
Everything was okay until they gave a draw on software features and after that it looks like 2 apple fanboys are comparing ios and android. I am watchin this on my  galaxy s20 plus while working out and i didnt have to close youtube app while switching to app to app and they literally gave points to apple for widgets lol. Such a bs video
Wow how do you guys get anything done if you don't use the multi-window function???
In my personal use, i find ios an extremely locked app ecosystem, and pretty restricted in comparison to the myriad possibilities in android. Also the limited system options and customizations in comparison to Android, as well as restricted file management, made me go away from ios to Android.
I think these is the wrong way to adress these... you cant compare phones these ways cause iphone has way more resources then companies mention on these video. If you compare iphone with only samsung i think is a 50 -50.  Cause android on samsung s22 ultra is 🤯
You can tell that this video is biased.  The iPhone is so boring and I know because I’ve had both.  Samsung is way better and they both know that.
Surprise surprise apples biggest advocates and apple wins
Loved this one. Spoke my mind!
Literally every Apple haters response to me on why Apple sucks is because of a feature they or I would never use. I don’t understand the hate between them and how I “waste money” on Apple
Awesome content keep it up as always Arun bro
I cant agree with almost anything you said, i give iphone the win in battery and video rest its android. So thats my subjective view.
Best presenters on YT battle Android vs iPhone. Epic!!
The fact is that in every category there is an android that beats the iPhone. But overall no android beats the iPhone.
Very biased
Not surprised by Mrwhostheboss, used to follow him years back when his content was very unique and informative, then he switched to stand-up comedy and started competing with Mr. Bean so I passed and never came back  ... and now this video popped up and I watched it to see what MKBHD has to say , to me he's the king of electronics on youtube .. this video is paid by apple for sure and there is no way it can be true, they are so desperate to compete with the androids, yes iPhone is a great phone, but beating android to that extent is an absolute joke!!!! I'd always go with android's flexibility, convenience, ease of use, customization, and google products, not waiting for an arrogant company to keep cutting down features, and components and keep that ugly notch! Can anyone recommend a decent honest unbiased youtuber other than this clown?
were on ios16 and u still cant search contacts on phone numpad. thats crazy
Loved it 🙏🏻🙏🏻 You missed the point for the ecosystem though
Apple sucks
you can do splitscreen on a lot of the newer androids idk why ppl are saying you cant
How about the freedom to do whatever you want??? Kind of a big deal to me
why is it android vs Iphone and not samsung vs iphone or pixel vs iphone
Still love my cheap Moto. Honestly don't need a $1000 phone.
Something seems weird
As a custom rom modder, android will always be my winner.
WAS WATCHING UNTIL 5 QUESTION IN THEN! SWITCHED OFF! .......... clearly android won the question and they even say as much but then pick apple because how they feel about it? NOT THE ACTUAL FACTS!   OF IT!   i have a samsung m51 7000mha battery it last me 2 day!  apple! where the one that started not putting the charging brick in? making you buy one with extra packaging etc and making more waste not saving 20 percent as they say? also android have a eco phone which they just brush over!!    rubbish! i thought marques was better than this and can't believe whostheboss clearly knew  marques was wrong and shocked about it! but then caved in! and gave him the win?  if i didn't know these guys  better i would say they were paid by apple!
You can't tell Samsung it's better to an i-phone guy.. And you can't tell Mercedes it's better to an bmw guy. Same shit... Noob = iphone+ bmw Smart = Mercedes + Samsung
On display that shit was not a draw
This video was pure bias 🗑🚮! 20 minutes of my life I can NEVER get back…🤦🏾‍♂️
I think that outside the flagship crowd, the best phone is the one you can actually afford.
A better title would be Android vs iOS, we are talking about mobile operating system
Biased fanboys trying not to sound like biased fanboys, lol, come on.
I trust none of these YouTubers…
ആൻഡ്രോയിഡ് ഇഷ്ടം 😍
Entire Review was Trash! Samsung charges at 45 watts compared to apples 22 watts. Samsung has brighter display, better screen, hole punch camera which iphone is about to adopt, but their hole punch camera looks like utter shit. A hole punch plus a big pill cutout nxt to it. Samsung has dozens of more features, user customization. Better audio. The list just goes & goes. Built in stylus, foldable phones, etc. etc. etc. You can definetely tell these guys have iphones & hugely biased on top of uneducated enough to use a phone that you would literally have to do anything to aside from having it set one way & stuck that way. Thats essentially what iphone is, they treat you like a user. Android treats you like an administrator, an owner. Hell, you can even use dex mode & mirror your android to your tv essentially turning it into a full desktop computer. Very Very Biased video.
how come you rate display as a draw?
This scoring system is laughable. Love seeing these guys together though!
Android Ringtones Beats iPhone!  The World Speaks!  75% Android Users and 25% iPhone
I know how much Arun struggles to defend the Android empire.
Sounds like matter of opinion and in this case which sponsor paid the creator more!
Really never expected this one sided view
iPhones get you the feature of having your phone scanned.
Them talking about iphone battery and me remembering there is an African budget gaming phone that's 7000mah
Android  for usability but power and battery goes to Apple
You guys made a compelling case for Apple, and the battery efficiency may prove a game changer for Apple in the long run. Yet for me, regardless of the "score", there remains one massive make or break fundamental issue: CHOICE. Would you stay in a country without freedom of speech/expression/religion? In Android world not only can I choose between different phone brands, but I can choose cloud providers, home assistants and smart home devices, media players, computers etc. No one company dictates what I use, how I use it and how much I should pay for it. This freedom of choice even applies to "must-have" Apple features (airdrop, facetime, etc) with a choice of Android equivalents which the rest of the world has been happily using.
Android is garbage
The sh*t comparison ever i seen
🤙
An excellent one, thanks!
opinions are like a-hole everyone got one, that said , i think the topic of  the video should be changed from android vs iphone to samsung vs iphone , cos if you want to compare andriod vs iphone it means every android, you can cherry pick, iphone doesnt have the best camera on a smart phone, iphone doesnt have the best battery life of a smart phone, iphone doesnt have the best screen on a smart phone, c'on !!!
Not the ideal rating video. They basically talk good facts about Android and gives the point to iOS. Few points they have to give android, they just go 50/50. Guys you were better than this. 😒  *Screen - iOS notch SUCKS!  *iOS battery sucks! *Performance? The RAM difference is visible and how iOS crashes apps?! Also it heats up crazy!  *Siri??? Seriously? There you go, 4 points 😒
android if free no limits no boundary iPhone is a prison that works like clockwork and limits you.
Apple sucks 😜😭😭😜😜
Nice 👍🏻
iPhone is a better phone hands down. You might say that I'm the Apple fanboi if you knew me as I use 2 mbp's and an ipad pro for work. However, even though I've been using both phones simultaneously at the same time; as in never has been a year that I don't have both an iphone and a samsung side by side, I still find myself using the Samsung much more than the iPhone for the reason that I find android easier to tailor fit for my needs and workflow. And if I were to choose only one phone, I'd keep my Samsung over the iPhone. I never use the ipad without an Apple Pencil and the Macs are just indispensible for my work, and a Samsung with am S Pen  just does a job so well that I'm able to integrate it with what I do while being mobile.
Paid apple advert
Can't believe how much they downplayed multi-tasking and configuration in this comparison.  That's disappointing.
still the s22 ultra is better then  iphone
Android always wins in features that matters the most:) peace✌️
I honestly think this is waaay to biased and it's like this is just an ad for Apple?
Charging and battery life definitely should have been in two different categories. Battery longevity as well.
So from my perspective I like the iphone for security speed and cam while the android for it's freedom to download any app
Unbox the bossxk
I love your video I wish my channel can be as popular as yours
Love the contrasting outfits - white and black. Don’t know if that was intentional but it was a nice touch
If apple has airdrop....android has nearby share....works same way but only limited to androids
In andriod ,You can do everything what iphone can.  But in IPHONE,  you don't do many things what android can. So no comparison at all.
Should've read iPhone vs Samsung
Not feeling this video. Felt like it so biased lol 😆
Aren't you tired of the everlasting comparisons of Android vs Apple ??? Honestly who gives a SHIT ? You're cash strapped and don't give a shit about your privacy and leaking data : Go for Android. Got cash and don't want to let Google read your emails : Go Apple.  End of story.
This felt very bias to me. Apple gets to focus on their one iPhone that is just different sizes. Android is made by many manufacturers. I felt the answers seemed to be more of a tie rather than iphone winning almost every category.
Looks like Apple paid promotion. Probably Apple is going to release a boring iphone 14 and running paid promotions to increase demand initially.
I tried out the 13 Pro for three weeks... I traded that POS for a proper S22 Ultra, and I'm 1000% happier with it. The only thing Apple does better, is security. But it's not worth having my hands tied at every turn. I'll never touch iPhone again. If you're an Apple diehard.... you're either a snob, or just plain ignorant - iPhone is just a status symbol.
A collab with Tim cock* would end less biased in the end
I think the iPhone is overvalued, in a face-to-face competition against the top of the galaxy s22 ultra, the iPhone would lose in points such as the camera, the screen and the price, it is clear that Apple sponsors the video and in the end the iPhone is an android because some components they are from samsung and sony!
Hi there , I humbly ask if you have extra used phone that you xan donate to me.. my phone sucks..thanks
The one wins the value actually matters alot. Not everyone need every feature. Android lets you chose.
lol,until 2 months ago i was an android fan,now 13 pro, apple watch 7,and ipad9.i can say i dont regret anything.
I think this was a one sided video. Samsung takes better pictures than iphone and just because you don't use multitasking on a samsung many people do which is something iphone in all these years haven't accomplished. Would you buy a computer that you can only open one screen at a time, so since people use their phones more now why wouldn't you want a phone without that option. I admit the iPhone battery is a little better but I watch movies and listen to music 5 days a week for a 12 hour day at work and still have 50% to 60% when I get off and i also can charge my watch with reverse charging. Plus the customization alone makes Android phones so much better and Android phones have flip and fold screens and with the iPhone you get the same thing over and over again. One more thing, it's funny that the features the iphone finally get that Android users have had for years all of a sudden becomes a big deal.
Nha MKHB is bias on this one
Innovation-  Android (with hole punch camera, foldable, sliding phone, telephoto lens, etc) Eco-friendly- Android (usb-c, right to repair, etc) Software featrue -Android (able to use 3rd party launchers for customizations, split screens, google eco system, etc) Value for money- Android (no need for any explanation here)  Iphone may be the overall good phone, but compared to Android it's still far behind in terms of design, innovation & versatility...
I feel like I cannot multitask efficiently on a Iphone - I like how android you can do a lot more things. Like Split screen? that thing is amazing
The photo's App. Google Photos Vs Apple photos. It's just not even close. I like iOS but when I've had an iPhone it's been full of Google apps because I'm locked into Google and Apple's Eco's system doesn't suit.
This needs a revisit....IPhone 13 Pro Max vs S22 Ultra the Android Champ Vs the IPhone poster boy. And not against androids devices that failed every category...no one brought up the SE when we spoke of battery life etc. 🙄 the fanboy in me feels violated🤣
Sorry to comment on this video, but I supposedly won the giveaway, and I wanted to post this here to ask for confirmation that it wasn't a scam. If you could let me know,  I'd really, really appreciate it! Thank you!
No time stamps?
this is a totally biased video, leaning towards the iPhone. Android allows you to use your phone like an external device whereas iPhone does not. Security issue may be a reason, but for an average user, being able to transfer files via cable is something convenient (especially if you dont have wifi or bluetooth on your desktop system). iPhone lacks the feature to close all apps on a single click of a button. Moreover, in Android you have a variety of brands to choose from, whereas iOS is limited to Apple alone.
They are not being fair That is all wrong A random survey will be better
I just need iPhone allowed delayed messages. 😅 only feature I miss since switchinh
I think apple eco system is better
None of them are good they have all at least tried to steal a feature from each other.
Iphone 13 pro leaves a dent in my hand; Marq: 'yes, i like that' conclusion draw!...wtf? Iphone 13 sucksl Marq: 'I like things that suck' conclusion: Iphone wins Arun, not one but almost all of the comments are about this vid being fake af! I liked you because you were neutral. I still like you but please this vid can't be real.... Ps: Marques, I can't take you serious after this video. Like zero.
Android would never plateau do to the competition between the phone companies to want to surpass each other or to stay ahead. That's my opinion. Apple is solid reliability but innovation isn't something that I'd rely on Apple for
Mkbhd is so biased he is an obvious apple person 🙄  apples display is nowhere near samsungs ridiculous
I'm watching your videos from beginning, i Know you had a very big phone collection, as a fan can you give me a phone for gaming
The only thing I didn't like about the video was the apology at the end.  This video was great, and honestly your regular videos tend to be overproduced, imho.  But content is great as always. Keep it up. 🤙🏼
Most people use sub $400 phones so iPhone is out of the picture, except the paleontological looking iPhone SE, this only applies for a few people
The more scientific analyses tend towards a draw between the 2 and have for years. The subjective measures used here were weighted towards iPhone, as many have already said in the comments.
2 iPhone guys vs no android community
after this video i feel proud to,,,, I have s21ultra not s22u. I love s21u
FAKE REVIEW! This is actually the first big thick dislike I do on this channel, I like your videos I enjoy them but this one is a fail 🚫, I knew immediately from the beginning as you gave the point in the screen category to iPhone (which is a catastrophe) that it's going to be just an Apple Fans video  All of the mentioned categories are actually an obvious WIN for Android no comparison
Apple is just a showpiece... Cant explore your happiness...premium Android phones are even better... Do you agree?
Biased 💀
I was an avid iPhone user for years, and was very happy for the most part.  I gave Android a chance when Samsung released a new phone a few years back, and never realized what I was missing out on.  One topic that was not really discussed here, that is very important to me now, is the how much better Android plays with 3rd party hardware.  Watches, Smart TV's, Speakers, etc... There is a world of great technology out there that Apple just doesn't want you to be able to take full advantage of.  And, this is always a hot topic as well... But, Android Auto with Google assistant is just unmatched in my opinion.  I'm not a fanboy of either platform by any means, and am actually making this comment from an Apple computer.  However, these small things are very important to me, especially my smart watch. Great comparison otherwise though. Cheers.
Samsung always is better
MKBHD Is only saying that iPhone is better because he is a apple fan boy and only cares about everything that revolves around Apple, I don't care what is better and what is not, I love My Galaxy S22 Ultra, I don't care if Apple is on top of the charts, android is special in all kinds of different ways, they have small phones, folding phones, Gaming phones, flagship phones ETC..... and what's even better about Android is  The Customization, the Screen Resolution, the Battery,  I get it everyone wants a iPhone, but I am sorry, I am Bias and I am sticking to Android, I just dont like everytimg about ios, Apple has to work on somethings, like who cares about FaceTime, icloud, the camera and social media, heck even how good the iphone battery is, it's the same freaking thing, just the same old os nothing different about it! I am a true Android fan and I don't need to here someone else bashing about Andoird on the spot, MKBHD Is only saying those things because like I said before, he is a apple lover and he is biased to Apple and everyone knows it!! Android beats Apple in someways! just saying!!! And to put the cherry on top, MKBHD didn't even say at least one good thing about Android, everything he said was majority of Apple! That's why I don't like his content, maybe he should do a collab with EverythingApplePro!
Someone got good money here for promotion
One sided completely biased 🙆‍♂️
Forgot to mention the most important thing iWatch !!!! Galactic years ahead of competition. Ecosystem (iWatch, iPad, Macbook, airpods, airtags) There is NO match for ecosystem integration. Airpods years ahead of the rest. It is very unfortunate that Google has not developed the ecosystem.
Hello sir... Please review the honor magic 4
This is the first time I didn't like how your Video's result turned out 😱
this feel HEAVILY biased to iphone painfully biased.
What, too generous in giving points to Apple.
Biased video
Android is better than iphone in many cases we dont need ur judgments
Apple is better. Samsung copied the iPhone’s design. And yes, this is my opinion. The OS is amazing! Very good camera quality! It does look just like android’s camera quality, but I feel like I’m more on the iPhone’s side.
I almost watch your 20+ video i never see any video that u beleave or say samsung is beter than iphone by any thngs. Apple funboy
Mkb lost all credibility for me when he picked the iPhone for photos. Mhtb nails it... iPhone lacks details, poor HDR and crushes dark scenes.
This is some Kanye & Drake kind of shit heheh  Lebron & Steph on the same team kid of shit  Messi & Cr7 in one team kind of shit hehehe
Who’s the boss?
When they gave exclusive features a DRAW I lost my sh*t. The few exclusive features on iPhone all have android equivalents. For ft we have Google duo, which also works with iPhones so it's better. For airdrop we have nearby share which is basically the same. For iMessage we have Google messages. Every other feature that's exclusive to android (of which there are hundreds of useful ones) iphone can't do. This catagory was easily android Edit: You gave "new features" a DRAW too?? All of apples new features are already on Android. THEY AREN'T NEW
I haven't even the video completely yet but how is the display category a tie when there is an Android phone that's around the same price range as the iPhone 13 Pro Max but has a superior display panel? Why would you compare it to anything else, like the iPhone 13 Pro Max is the best Apple can offer and the Galaxy S22 Ultra is the best that Android can offer? That's a clear win for Android in my mind.
Samsung- Maximum features iPhone- Maximum perfections
LOL did apple pay y'all for this??
Sponsored vlog, Probably. Samsung flagships (particularly former NOTE series), as a package, is way better than iPhone in terms of features, functionality, productivity, UI, innovations and so on!
you forgett nearbe share in android its the same as airdropp
12:00 i can’t seem to find that the androids won’t tell you the battery life
Did MKBHD just got paid by apple to say these?..I have never seen him give smartphone of the year award to an iphone😂
So they are both biased towards iPhone. Cause you know repairability is important for environmental issues, and iPhone is less repairable than every other phone in the market especially third party repairs.
I can take amazing pictures of jumping, running, screaming kids, all while djing on my iPhone 13 Max...Good luck trying this on S22 Ultra...for the rest: Android since Galaxy S2! :)
I would pick an Android phone over an iPhone any day
Android is basically the USA of the phone world, it might lack a bit from iphone but it has much more freedom than iphone and that matters a lot
Apple
An iPhone winning on most parameters against many Android phones seems abnormal. I used to trust these two guys, but this video has changed my attitude towards them.
iPhones better than android . Yet both of them are using androids on a daily bases . It just goes to show that everyone uses phones differently for different purposes
Remember you are one of the leading tech influencer and i hope you are staying true to it. Please don't be biased😑
BITCH YOU CAN SIDELOAD STUFF TO ANDROID  THAT'S WORTH LIKE 100 POINTS!
Boo, the rating was bad.  Too many ties to keep Samsung down.  Just say you love your apple and leave it.
Two iZombies. One talking as pro- iphone. And one acting like pro- Android.  Sad.
Given it's basically impossible to repair an iPhone compared to an android. I would give the sustainability point to Android as they will last longer.
Def a biased video, we all know MKBHD is an Apple fan
Neither can hold up to the immense power the Barbie toy phone possesses 😅
Fun fact, iPhone 6s lasted 6 years of software updates 😳
BIASED
Probs from Germany for this very good and informal video 🤝
You ask the best guy about what you choose.. and this guy is an apple fanboy..
Absolute bullshit video. Didn't expect this kind of a biased video. Android is always better . IPhone and ios completely sucks
I am a big user of split-screen apps and USB and hard disk connectivity to type c point. IPhone failed to do so. Samsung dex is insane. In pricing android wins. Iphone only winner in performance
Common guys, having a discussion about which one has more software features? Android is way ahead in many many features. Ask a power Android user. Split screen to copy data between documents and web forms, PiP to keep watch something and read an article without jump back/foward. Android allows full control over the camera lenses and RAW capture (not all models). Can copy easily to any desktop OS data using a USB-C cable. No airdrop but we have a similar thing to share using NFC/Bluetooth/WiFi.
Sponsored video for sure, its so obvious.
Very disappointed in this video. Mrwhosetheboss basically just grabbed his ankles and allowed MKBHD to screw android over without a fair comparison despite Mrwhosetheboss definitely having different opinions then MKBHD. This was a VERY biased comparison.
Samsung ❤️
Video sponsored by Apple
I dont know .. I got vibes of being side with  ios ( payed ) btw I use both
Finally some one did this but if apple had slit screen then it would be perfect
This comparison coming from you is a disappointment. Seems like you got paid by Apple to do this comparison.  Or could be you use Iphone more than Android phone. Android kicks Apple 100 times more when it comes to productivity, usability, and price. You get the price out from the hardware you paid. Sure, Apple has made some tweaks to make the battery last long but you can also do that on android or even make it last longer if you know what you are doing. Apple is more for simple people who don't know how to get the most out of their devices, for example, non-techie people. So, this review, coming from you, makes me wonder if you're a legitimate Techie user or just someone who got paid to make Iphone look better.
You can't really rank Android IMO because e.g. Samsung has horrible value while brands like Xiaomi and Oppo have fantastic value. And one thing that is not focused on enough is the price, the price is by far the most important aspect of a phone, otherwise everyone would just buy the best, if we're talking about price then the Chinese Android brands definitely takes the crown, you can get almost the same flagship phone for half or 1/3 the price. And Android has a lot more customisation options which is a must have for me e.g. on Android I can download APK of games that cost real money for free or get a cracked version of Spotify and not having to pay for Premium, all of which saves me hundreds of bucks every year.
in the past i hugely favored android over iphone, but currently if i would like to buy a new phone i really do not know, what to actually buy, there is NO single phone which attracts me high enough to be craving it to buy... therefore i sort of feel that if i were to buy a phone i would buy an iphone. because it is the most solid device on the market right now.
I think MKBHD is a paid character from apple 🍎
Clearly biased video. As someone who has been repairing phones before the iphone was even released in my country i can tell you theres no legit reason to chose an iphone over an android unless you just want to feel rich or dont know anything about technology. FFS you couldn't even send a song via bluetooth until recently and youre telling me this phone has better software? you still cant sideload apps. if the store doesnt have the app you need you have to go buy a whole android or just live without it, what will you do if apple and your favourite app make falls out or tehy cant pay apples extremely high fees for hosting apps on their store? thats right...you have to run out and buy a whole other phone with android or jailbreak your iphone. androids are so convenient, featured we used to have to root our phones to get are now standard. im not even going to be watching videos from this channel anymore cuz of this clear bias. might even unsubscribe.
You two are both highly intelligent, thoughtful men, the way you respectfully can agree or disagree was quite inspiring. I would love to see more duo's on any kind of tech your both into.
How can phone gurus compare an OS to a Phone? Come on guys!! How about Android vs iOS, Samsun S22Ultra vs iPhone 13 pro max.
Him be like” androids IPhones”…
Samsung The One Best Smartphone History
This guy on the left is a iphone fan and probably paid from apple to talk like that 👎👎👎 I love my S22 ultra,..I don't know much about phones and why I bought it because I don't know what to do with it
you forgot to mention this video is sponsored by Apple lol, all these battery test u were doing were then just a waste of time lol.
Such a biased video.
Not a fan of the IPhone vs Android because that's one phone vs many so it's easier to nitpick with inferior phones when comparing the two
It's bullshit, he is iPhone fan boy
Without Android, smartphones might not be reaching everyone.  iPhone is made for only High income groups.
android cuz you can actually use it to do whatever you feel like. how is this even a debate? its like asking what car is better to drive in 2022. obviously the one that isnt restricted by gas prices.  Iphones are powerful, yes, but the software is build to keep you children on a leash and too make it worse they do everything they can to prevent you from reparing the phone with original parts when it breaks unless its from them. Louis Rossman has been battling them on this for years. Apple products are no better than whatever else is on the market except their chips.
It seems like Mark born with the iphones.🤣🤣
The only problem I have with MKBHD is that, he's iPhone biased. That's why I don't watch him  in iPhone vs android lately.
If u want to say apple is the best then just say that.......not think that this was proper comparison.
Great video y’all.
Believe me if you have vivo x70 pro plus and vivo x80 pro  you have the best smartphones
Android users are fuming rn😌
What kills the iPhone for me is its stupid shape, the fact that you pay for everything and it's low customizability. I had one top of the line iPhone just when it was released and never again.
Bro I just use a Motorola g play
The DISPLAY of iphones is nothing to do with the word "SPECIAL".
Should have included a hardware security option, who provides a better security iPhone or Android?
It's really good for you guys ,that youtube removed dislike count
ANDROID VS iphone?
I try do download a video from my Iphone XS Max, doesn't work.... I try to upload a video on it from the PC... Doesn't work... Sometimes i doesn't recognize the phone with another cable. Don't get me started on adding music to the phone. Camera setting doesn’t stay on 16:9, even if set as written on Apple page. Why can't i have app settings like in Android? Why do i need to have the settings in several places? 😅
The winner is Android... Which phone did each guy Have....? Should have been a 10 second video
These are my favourite videos… the collaboration
Samsung's Displays on iPhone's so😏😁
Make a video about the Poco M3 pro 5g and Poco X3 GT
The Collab we knew we needed
Sorry but this is a biased comparison
But multitasking is not about using personally 2 apps or more, but it's about running these apps in background (like file copying etc). iOS just freezing apps that are not opened. It's doing it even when you pull down the notification bar or whatever it's called. // 9:00 seriously?
aran you should have usen the red magic 7 pro insted of s22 ultra
There is "Nearby Share" on Android as alternative to "AirDrop"
Apple is just being slow in introducing important features compared to Android. The most important point is the stupid price that Apple charges for a iPhone.
did you send ryan trahan 5000$
iPhone refuses to go to USB c even though they use it in all there other devices. Is just a deal breaker for me one but how that not get brought in to the echo friendly part the video
I say this was really biased
Pretty biased i would say!
Samsung is good but i phone is best
End Credits ; " The Video is sponsored by Apple Inc."  End of the shoot : MKBHD say goodbye to Arun, took his Apple jacket and left the room and said : " Bro, you don't need to pay anything to me , Tim buddy will credit it to my account ".  After seeing this , Arun went 😯🥴🥴.  " i shouldn't be here, why I'm here ,who drops me here. " Arun thinks himself.  @Mrwhosetheboss
So we just going to ignore them agreeing on Android advantages and not giving them any points?
android can download paid apps for free
You guys could at least try to make it look like you're not purposely biased against Android. S22 Ultra beats iPhone in every category or at least ties it in the ones it doesn't beat
I prefer having a Android.
they're all talking about new things in the phone industry. to be honest, new phone releases are not as exciting as before. OnePlus 6 for example... it was the last time that i genuinely felt very excited for a new phone. too many phones now, so kany that they've become boring. still loving my oneplus 6 though. this is probably the most durable mainstream phone ever. i only updated my OnePlus 6 to android 9. android 10 upwards are trash.  between android and ios, i will choose android anytime, anyday. OnePlus 6 on android 9 is the best phone exerience ever.
This video is grossly inadequate for android
Guys, a lot of people uses Samsung DeX mode. This review is like a promo for Apple 😐
What a useless video. Why even do this? Just to start a flame war in the comments?
Really enjoyed the dynamic you two had together for this video. There’s a lot of nuance 😉
The title should say "iPhone vs everyone". 😂
I've had Androids most of my adult life, so a few months ago I decided to take the IPhone 13 Pro Max for a spin, and I have two good things to say about it - the battery life was phenomenal, and I loved the solid build, but that was all I liked.  I lasted a week, but returned it in favor of my S22 Ultra.  I just need to be able to customize my phone and I rely on its ease of use features like single gesture closing of multiple open apps.  Apple does what they do very well, and their devices are well built, but if you want greater control of your device, IPhone isn't a good choice.
Dislike button for you guys. It's like you just hate android
Straight up facts!
Nope*
Does MKBHD collab with apple? Huh.
I don't think this is great, the costuming  in Android is suck, the more fun things are only in Android, may be MKBHD or what ever , i don't know he is giving this much credit to i phone why did he give best phone award to, not in a single time to i phone, why, samsung s22 previous, and onpluse to back of that year,  Android is more free i am also a user of i phone using since iPhone 5S till 13, still am with Android, i don't need a string that bind me on not leting me to fly,😂    Nb. If you partnership with i phone  am sorry, and for mewhotheboss, y mahn?.. You guys are great influencer, but it's damn, silly reason  Battery,high price, usability, Repair, service ...... Sucks i phn
in my opinion iphone is good phone but samsung and pixsel is better!
Flagship Android vs iPhone ! Yea iPhone clearly gets the points but from a budget point of view (student life 🥴) I don't think we even have an iPhone vs Android comparison. It's a tone of Android with compromises 🤣 so let's say at the end of the day Android saves my day 🥴
Love the camera and customization I had w/ my Samsung devices over the years. Just got an iPhone 12 PM and it’s pretty nice
Change my mind
Try however hard, never buying an Iphone over Android Options....After purchase charges of Apple, they just looting ppl
This is the most bias review I've seen from you two I'm unsubscribing
The fact that both of them aren't aware of Nearby Share on Android is shocking af.
this was way too biased... idk if y'all got paid by apple for this
Y'all r bias towards Apple
Bullshit, Samsung display?
Yeah over the past 15 years I have made switches to android twice with their top flagship of that year and both failed on me within less than a year. iPhone isn’t perfect but it sure has been reliable for me so far.
You guys should have invited Flossy Carter to this conversation. You guys just sound like Apple fanboys,😂
Seemed like the iPhone show! But, that's only my opinion. They were totally honest.
How can you compare a phone to an operating system???
Look like paid video by iphone not impressed with this video
stupid comparison video first thing i hate about iPhone it's heavy weight 2nd so wide that's 2 thing make me love towards android and samsung
Ios all the way!!!value for money
There are more varieties in Android phones, so how did ONE iPhone beat like 50 other Android phones? You could probably name an Android device for each category to beat it.
Points missed for android - SD Card, -downloading music/videos, -torrent download, -4K screen from Sony, -Google drive sync -watching videos online in websites where safari fails -USB c for charging phone, headphone and my laptop.
Both of these iPhone fanboys never miss a chance to bash Android regardless of how well Android improves over time. It's a shame that these two are also the biggest tech influencers on the planet. In which universe is Android not ahead of iPhone in terms of customization? Come on, a few lock screen gimmicks  in iOS 16 won't change that. Ever tried out Good Lock on Samsung phones, boys?
LoL battery vote goes to an iPhone 🤣🤣 how biased they are and also how much away from the market need.
Bro check tecno pova 2 with 7000mah battery
but hope you find this useful! NO
try to use OPPO FIND X5 PRO u`ll change ur mind
Iam still using eight year old iphone without a single lag  Can ur android do that? No way. I used to used samsung phones ,within 2 years it getting used to lag very slow and iphone work as new.  Thats my opinion.
ANDROID IS INTRUSIVE
2 of the top best tech youtubers comparing 2 of the best brands
Every year why do yu make this same video ? 😅😂
I'm not happy about this 🤞
in all situations android wins
Shit 😂😂😂😂😂 Android is better , fakk iOS 😴😴😴😴
i think android is a better os but iphone is better phone
you both iphone fans and that is not fair bring one android fan and one iphone fan
Android phones for the win. Apple is for the no thinkers everything auto. Android you can do what ever you want with it
Lol Apple sponsored video. I’ve switched to Iphone 13 pro and boy I never hated a device with such passion ever before. $1,000 phone and I just wanna throw it on the wall. I am having to worry about things I have never even thought of while using android for 26 years.  Bull-crap device.
The teamup we all love to see <3
Which one offers more flexibility to get what you want out of a phone? Which one gives you more options, which one is not stuck behind a walled garden. Which one is more customizable. Anybody want to hit iPhone with some hardball today or are we playing catch with these questions.
The ibone is boring
I have both ironically I end up using Google maps, chrome, Gmail, pandora, YouTube, duo, etc on the iPhone so I might as well stick with android.
20 minutes wasted ... Y it was so hard for Mrwhosetheboss to choose iPhone... There was everything abt only iphone ... They just insulted android... If they had already to choose iphone they shouldn't have to make 20 minutes video... Wat a waste ..
Me using Samsung galaxy M51 which is have 7000 mah bettary
These are two different devices and ecosystems and incomparable  - for the noobs
iphone is better at anything it does, but there's plenty things it doesn't.
Not specific to iPhone but to iOS. I just hate that my webpages reload when switching from different app. so annoying.
I must be iphoning wrong.  My 13 pro barely lasts a full 24 hrs without going amber. My multi year old Sony compact can last for 2-3 days…. It’s even more exasperated when you make actual calls lol sorry but I haven’t seen the legendary iPhone battery life when I actually use the device lol  Edit: I’ve found the iPhone gets in the way of how I want to use the device quite a bit.  iMessage never really syncs correctly with my Mac and I hate seeing notification circles.  I’m planning on hopping to android if they ever release a compact flagship (a real one, not a 6 inch “compact”)
This is crazy
Fuck iphone
I prefer mrwhosetheboss because he is the boss the his thinking is way similar to mine
Biased opinion
I still feel that this video has overrated the iPhone. The attention and praise it does not deserve.
MKBHD is too biased.... Android is much better in all fields
I prefer super great battery than charging because at night I charge my phone and in moring I can use the phone all day and never leave my game unfinished due to low battery
I almost disliked this video. Not bc android lost. No. I use iphone myself. But you missed so many things that other comments have pointed out like the repairability. The video also felt very cynical and not in contact with the viewer. Over all not a very good video. You could have taken 5 to 10 minutes more time and go deeper into some topics and actually make the video fair and truthful.
Sponsored by Apple 😄
I liked the Collab but it's a bit sad to see a lot of the iPhones problems not explored.  Kind of makes you feel like apple sponsored this video, or at least overseeing this video to pressure both of you. I would love to see a completely unattached view head on, objective, regardless of external factors. It should be about phone to phone not user to user as you explained many use cases which did make it relatable however this is android verses iPhone, so it should be phone verses phone, what they have and what they don't have. If you know what I mean.  Edit: thanks for 460 likes
Actual score  Display point Android because they are leading…. Performance point Apple, they are king of the silicon market for mobile. Battery point Apple by a long shot. Camera photo point Android better picture quality as stated by them not sure how interface somehow wins Apple the camera category when that would be a software stability issue. Camera video point Apple. Eco consciousness point Android, you know what’s better than making a phone with 20% recycled materials which is done by shredding old phones and harvesting small amounts of reusable material? Reusing the entire phone androids repairability is substantially higher.  Software stability point Apple Software features point Android. I’m sorry but you can simply do more on an android than you can an iPhone. Got an App you want that the store doesn’t support? Cool side load it. Don’t like your keyboard? Cool change it. Don’t like how your drop downs are configured? Change those too. I no way shape or form can Apple claim victory here. Their features may be more polished but at the end of the day features are what android does best. Even the things being referenced as pillars of apple (iMessage) android has an equivalent version.  Software support point Apple Pricing point Android.
Both of them are heavy iPhone users. Really biased review.
It will only make sense if u compare the phones than comparing one software to another phone... you cant compare Android to Iphone, this is the dumbest thing i have ever seen....
Hmm it’s like that Samsung is is the better than apple in the phone market??? BECAUSE IT IS: and I DO NOT CARE IF PEOPLE DISAGREE SAMSUNG IS BETTER
this was one long iphone commercial
Naah… this isn’t a right or a fair comparison. You are comparing iPhone with all of Android phones. Not fair.
Every tech YouTuber uses iPhone. I think this is not biased review but the truth. It feels good when we hear what we want to hear and we are sad when we don’t hear what what we want to.  I am an android user too. But lot of my friends use iPhone not because they are tech savvy. They want iPhone because they say it feels good and they think android is cheap.  People are ready to pay for iPhone and specially the new generation. And this trend in rising in Asia.      Going with iPhone is like playing safe. Who wants to buy Li- Ning at the same price if they can buy Nike or Adidas.    I think the Apple craze will continue going up in future. And android is the only one that will help Apple get better.
I certainly believe with all my heart Marques is a Apple fan boy
Such a bise shit, you just wanted iPhone to win he said Google assistant over siri but never count that in
Android: so much of widgets and features that matters little to many people. iOS: little widgets and features but matters alot to many. I am definitely switching to iOS  😥 So help me God.
You went to the US just for this video and to meat Marquez, right? And you make money off of this video. Did you get a working Visa for the US? Interested
I'm from "minorities" I'll definitely go for Android, I feel I'm the sole owner of that piece that I've bought 😉
iPhone battery 🔋 can stay long last as my experience.
The iPhone is winner 🏆 before the video starts and against an army of android phones 😂😂😂
This is more of iPhone ad :p  Display is clearly Samsung's crown. Being flat is not point changing. Both are equally smooth and responsive.  Zoom should also be a feature when video is seperated, night photography should have a seperate section as well.  Performance? Only discuss real-life differences. We all have seen companies boosting their benchmarks on purpose, Apple can be another exception.   People using Samsung phone find it much easier than Apple. I am a UI/UX person, even I had trouble using iPhone when I did it for the first time (8+).  This is not to say that iPhone is bad. Infact Samsung's camera has regressed after s9/s9+. iphone got better camera, battery, performance it is the best. But Android is not this bad.
I love my Android phones; I have a LG V60 and the S22 Ultra and the iPhone 13 pro max but I just love android.
They both bulshiting
I prefer Samsung because of Dex and I use it. I don't prefer iphones because you need apple products to make the ecosystem to work. Which is not used by everyone. Transferring files from iphones to windows is such a pain in the  butt
Best collaboration ever in Tech 😍❤️
Absolute B/S! Android gives you freedom; loads and tons of options to choose from while IOS locks you in to one man one woman kind of stuff😂
I completely agree with mkbhd
Appreciated your short message at the end acknowledging the lighting! It was totally worth it though.
How come that iPhone is technologically more advanced if it doesn't offer even basics like a built-in stylus or a memory card slot or even a USB-C charging? Let alone foldable devices.
Mr whose the boss i expected an honest perpective /view from you like in your other videos.very dissaponted with this video!
Kinda made me sad to see android behind :( . I'm rooting for you android ...literally lmao
What  I care most is that I can make phone calls- seems not that important any more because it wasn’t discussed at all 🙁📞
android fanboys now cry so hard
You are honestly the Best person I have ever seen , like wow..... since day 1! I loved all the Pictures you share
Come on guys this video needs a do over!
This video is really dissaponting coz it felt rushed and more shud have been discussed .come on guys this needs a part 2 with a longer video duration.i say again very dissappointing video
Iphone fan boy lol
Completely disagree with the end result of this video,come on iphone wining the display category really really man these guys buy the screens from samsung and how can you say iphone is better,some how in my opinion i could see marques be too unrealisticallly suppportive of the iphone.
they did not mention some of the features that I care about which are the reason why I pick Android over iPhone. Such as the different application stores, sideloading, and trying apps from untrusted sources (basically every beta app), And Google services such as drive, sheets, etc which are the reason why I would never switch to iPhone. But overall for the average user, Android takes a few features and pushes them to the limit, while iPhone takes all the features and make them just reliable.
Please do not overestimate the device hardware. Those are part of a whole eco-system. The eco-system is what is important for a user. Also, the question should be "Who's doing better for WHICH PURPOSE". Imagine someone asking "Which is the best car." The question just does not make any sense.
the fact that we can download apks on android is another win for android. Free Spotify premium💀
Shocking from MKBHD
I love this collab. I agree with the analyses…
the comparisons is curated to iPhone to win and ignoring things like changing ports, the different sizes of screens samsung fold and flip, stylus with note.  plus ignoring the fact that Apple messages used only in US and ignoring the rest of the world. plus for anyone want headphones jack you can find modern Android phone with that but you can't with iPhone.
android for sure
Disliked the video the moment they tied on displays. Samsung’s display is much more vibrant any day over iPhone.
Whenever I want to buy a smartphone, I ask myself does it have an ugly notch?         Then I buy the iPhone.          And burn it to ashes
Multiple window on Android? I'm using it almost every day. Haveing a chat on the lower part of the screen while watching Netflix or YouTube on the upper part.
I like Iphone due to it's simplicity  it's kinda like " Less is more "   reliable  and ease of use. it's really goes down to your own personal prefrerences.
Concerning a multitasking on Android, I mean this with split screen etc... I remember I have used it maybe 5 times for 5-years or something. My friends have never used it:) So, yeah technically we have this possibility to use split screen and this floating windows etc, but in reality the vast majority of Android users just don't use it
i was hoping for a build quality category,but the video was 🎉
Good video I’d say although I don’t think someone should make a decision entirely off of this video because although ios won and I use ios all that time and that’s what I daily they made good comparisons but again android has more genres of phone if that makes sense android you have variety if you want to be an absolute power user then the Sonys the Samsungs are really good and then for gaming if you want more options and settings you have dedicated phones and it just depends on preference I think, a good comparison was made but a decision entirely based off of the video should not be made maybe you know use both phones and decide whether you like the experience you had with each and yes some off you may say my opinion is biased because I daily an iPhone but I still feel like android is just as good if not better again even with the cameras the photos on android are over processed but some people like that and even if they’re not consistent I think that wouldn’t be repetitive depending on the phone so yes I absolutely agree with the video but also feel like android isn’t losing as much because essentially both are very good and it ends up on preference
I don’t know why people forget “shortcuts” app. It single handedly beats the android in terms of functionality. How to even begin with.
> "which one is better, windows or mac?"  > Compares hardware features of macbook to literal hundreds and thousands of other laptops  That's the thing, Apple literally cannot sell me a product, because even if they win, they only have that single product which has a lot of things I do not want on my phone.
This review feels so biased. I mean they went over points, yes. But with the diversity in Android a person gets to chose. You guys might use an iPhone and end up learning and using most out of it. But there are so many more things an android can do that went untold of. Different kind of skin on top of Android exhist for a reason. A gamer can chose a Rog phone. A photographer can chose a Vivo. A businessman can chose a Sony . An enthusiast can chose a Xiaomi or samsung. There are phones in every budget. Each phone is built different to cater to an even diverse group of people.  There are a lot you missed out on or it more of feels like dropped of the review. You guys just took an iPhone and samsung and spoke for the entirety of smartphones and that just ain't right.
Guys with all respect, but I think u r very hard on S 20 ultra, it’s better screen and better camera and better battery and faster charging, I will not go any longer.
It's rather funny how 2 of my favorite Tech influencers are Apple fanboys. This video seems wrong because tech is supposed to give you the freedom of expression and not tie you into a system. Safe to say that I'll not be watching as much of their videos anymore.
try adding a country code to a phone number on iPhone or copying a part of a text message. It's just annoying, iPhone just falls flat on the basic functionality sometimes. And giving the apple widgets a thumbs up, without even testing it doesn't sound fair.
iPhone only has good performance cause its a closed eco system. If you take that into account it makes android better as it is in an open ecosystem and can handle more variety of use cases.   This carries over to battery the iPhone is only better cause you cant do anything cause its so locked down of course you will have a long lasting battery.  Facetime can be cross platform if Apple was serious about getting more users, same with Airdrop, and Apple is not making any steps to customizations like launchers.  Widgets are not used much its used cause that is the only choice you have.  Overall phone wise Android is better cause of more freedom and variety. The iPhone is more popular because they limit what you can do and they tell people what they need and do not need. People tend to be drawn to people in higher levels or positions telling them what to do.
Why are all you people bitchin about the outcome of iphone being the top choice??!!! 😂 Dude asked him what "HE" prefers and what works for HIM!" Not what he thinks the viewers feel, or how they would be subjective to the damn android phone!😂 I've had flagship of both Samsung and apple for years. I stopped with Android when I had note 9 and galaxy S10+ because the apple eco system did it for me. I love having all devices (macbooks, ipads and iphones) ring when I get a call and I can choose which device I want to talk on, plus airdrop, screen mirroring, etc. It's just not the same on Android for me! I suggest to the naysayers, make your own video declaring the damn android as winner and watch all apple fans bitch about why they think it shouldn't be! 😂😂😂😂😂
Such a biased result in my opinion. I do not like crApple at all, but I am fair with comparisons. I agreed with SOME crApple wins, but some should have clearly gone to Android which I think would have resulted in a tie. Both presenters have gone down in my estimation as unbiased 'testers'.
Samsung from Asia, and apple from U.S  that's the different. 😂 In every sector Apple gonna win 😂
Very Biased.
I have used both iphone 13 pro max and s22 ultra. Iphone is amazing in video department and ui,battery, but i have faced some bugs on ios and after sometime ios is boring as hell. IOS lacks customization features. Now i am using s22 ultra which is a beast of a phone Great cameras, Display, and most of all it have S pen which is a game changer. The only things i miss from iphone is battery life and video. But i don't shoot videos that much, comparing with iphoneI feel that the S22 Ultra is the best option.
All the same!  Its an scam to troll money out of people pokkeds.  Same fone for more money!
this is iOS, Apple brainwash video 😄
Daily functionality Android W
Since Android is soo wide, taking averages really hurts the android score, there are android phones that I would consider on par if not better than IPhones, like s22, but for every s22 there are 10 p50 PROs, and that’s on top of skipping feature like headphone jack, so cards and USB C on android, I’m not calling them fanboy but I’d not say this is a fair comparison
We needed Linus in this conversation.
When 2 Apple fanboy talking about Android 😂
Today's video is sponsored by..... Apple
S 22 ultra best
Apple like wife  Android like frnd...
Overall IPhone is unbeatable..
Marques seemed to be iPhone biased. And there are lot more aspects that they didn't mentioned in the video.
Paid by Apple
@mrwhoistheboss i think you already noticed mkbhd one-sided apple....I think Apple pays him...I noticed when you asked about vivo x80 pro camera and he still tells Apple is better....I think its time waste for you..
THE IPHONE BIAS MEETS THE ADROID BIAS HAHAHAH = LEGENDS...
The most boring team is not often the best team. Even if it's best, we don't buy tickets to watch such a team.  When people stop falling for brands and dive deeper into design and ingredients, things would be a lot different.
Come on guys!!! So you are just gonna compare a phone against a whole group of phones ??? How does the Iphone even gain some points here ? For every category you just have to take the best Android phone at it and compare to the Iphone. The Iphone end up winning anw, the only fact that you put it against every other phones just shows how good it is. You guys are looking like iphone ambassadors here. Somehow... For this to be my first YouTube comment...😫 I am quite disappointed.
This should have been a Samsung vs iPhone, it does not encompass the Android market as a whole. Buy a top end Android phone from EACH Android brand AND THEN compare Android v iOS. Other than that, this video seems more clickbait than anything. It's Samsung vs Apple, not Android vs iOS.  Edit: that's a lot of money but it shouldn't be an issue for him... I think..
Paid  video
iPhone has 7 years of support by the way, iPhone 6s still has updates and this phone was released in 2015
I feel like it was biased on iPhones side a little bit. I noticed that they were more focused on the iPhones abilities, and are downplaying androids features. I myself am a iPhone user, but just seem really off by the way they were pinnin so much stuff against android, and how they give whole points to something so small between both os’s. They barely even mentioned both sides of the new updates of the phones, and yet they reviewed it as it was fair. Definitely didn’t touch me right to how this video played out. But hey IPhone is great, and android is as well. A phone is what it is, and I would say for their prices, their worth what you get
😂😂😂😂😂 This is comparation or demolition?
the eco conscious made no sense. apple isn't at all eco conscious with its phones or the packaging and there are plenty of carbon neutral companies. Google is apparently cartoon neutral and used recycled material in the phones
Finally, Apple has bought MKBHD and the BOSS
All i see is here marketing for iPhone, even though it's paid or unpaid.
They both were once on of my favourite influencers,but now limited to apples brand promoters😂😂
Android users are mostly broke
Android crybabies on the comments are cringe🤣🤣  They are typing 400 word essays like people have time to go through your pain 🤣🤣
We live in a age where such content is a bait to watch 1.5 minutes worth of ads.
Result won't matter cause i like android and that's it for me so i'll go with the android🍾
What's this new emojis...? 😳 It only in your channel....!
I am a iPhone used from android and I really like their ecosystem and software, but the comparison felt unbalanced . It felt like iphone was being praised more than android
I know iPhone will surely get the high score, but I heard the word iPhone more than Android. It's like this video doesn't even mean to compare…
Why there is no option for chapters browsing in your videos. That's one of the biggest downside of this channel. This is one of the most polished & well edited channel in youtube. Unfortunately the former option is still not present in your channel. If you want to see a certain section in the video then you can browse the chapter option & select it instead of watching some section which one may find boring, not relevant or even disliked. So please include that option asap. Even mkbhd has that option
iphone battery wins  joke of the day
We should realize this is about iPhone vs everybody brand phone androids int the world
Broken the trust on both of you guys
You forgot to mention this video is sponsored by Apple.
I wouldn’t wanna say hey google in public though
it's the first time I felt him as biased😕
I was expecting more from u guys how u guys are comparing 2 softwares diferentes hardware this doesn't make sense
The state I am in right now . I know I will miss a lot of things on my android but still I know iPhone will do things I needed better and with ease.  Going back to iPhone reluctantly 😒
Assume I want to move to android from iphone. Do I have to buy all the apps again in google? That would be a huge cost for me as I am already heavily invested in appstore.
This seems like apple wanted Android comparison and show others just by having techies that they are better even though Android is way better than what the arguing with.
It is paid promotion of iPhone..
Android ❤️
A number of important aspect from Android was not mentioned such as extended memory (memory card), stylus, fordable phone, desktop mode and multi window,  app backup. The list goes on and on. I felt there were a lot that were not discussed. 😞😞
Another thing you can say about software updates is that on iOS everyone gets the newest update at the same time (provided your phone supports it). On Android each manufacturer needs to first get that update ready for their device so in some cases it can take a long time to get to the latest version.
Apple is a hundred storey luxury apartment, but the take is neither it has exit doors nor even wires going out.
It's a hard pill to swallow but at the end of the day Apple is just better.
Some people have died while waiting for Apple to put widgets, did you consider that
If in court this is injustice I rest my case.
I😓 am very poor  can you gift me an used iphone.🥺 12 mini is may dreem phone.But😞 my monthly income 75 dollar. 😩 I cannot  effort  iPhone. 😭😭
The MKBHD guy is an American what else were you expecting 😛
ok guys iphone is better… y’all can leave now.
I think you guys are just marketing Iphone cuz from user experience android beats Apple in alot ways.
Android fanboys are so mad right now 😂😂  They just can’t accept that iPhone is vastly superior
17:57 Mrwhosetheboss just casually strokes himself with an android phone. Was he doing a which phone feels better  test lol?
they are members of sleeper cell of apple.
Mrwhosetheboss was just being polite. he had more valid points than the american. Marques is such an APPLE fanboy he doesnt even notice it himself. lmao.
Marquis is a apple fan boy. I've used both Android Samsung offers more in every department
I like the idea for video, I do not like how it was marked and certainly do not agree with the result. Few months ago, I switched from Android to iPhone and regret it more and more with every day. For me AirDrop, Facetime and Shareplay mean very little because I hardly ever use it. They are "big pillars" only in US and UK where iPhone has such a market dominance. In all other countries they mean much less.  At the same time I get disappointed with limitations and missing features from my previous Samsung phone every day.  WHY NO ALWAYS ON DISPLAY ON OLED SCREEN IPHONES? Because they push me to buy AppleWatch if I want Always on display?   And finally, for me, iPhone user interface seem a little outdated compared to the latest Samsung One UI.
only think iphone sucks is usbc, i love my phone but its just that. tbh it aint bad for anything except data transfer which i use alot as i film on iphone but tbh anything else its watevers imo
Next Invite Lew From Unbox Therapy for IPhone Vs Android!!!!!!
the lighting doesn't suck. less editing is something new so far so maybe you should introduce videos with less editing in them.Anyways its informative :)
MKBHD!!! That cat is the real deal!
how many iphones does this guy have
Trying to multi select photos in an Iphone made me a big no for iphones. Very user unfrendly softeare. Never again
Video should be about Android vs iOS and it’s all about hardware, not software :D :D :D WTF?
Hi
Can you pls make a video about Nothing phone 1.I'm really interesting about it and I also think there will be more who will love to see it.I'm really looking forward your video about nothing phone 1.Thank you.
Can't believe you did not address the ecosystem which is arguably the most important part of choosing a phone nowadays where every top end phone is very good. There is a very high chance that you do your work either at home or at the office, on a Macbook... and for that reason there is really only one choice of brand. If you want to airdrop files, have all your contacts, email, photos etc sycn without minimal effort, continuity, so on and so on, you are better off with a phone from the same ecosystem. And i don't really get the "hate" or.. scepticism about any ecosystem. why is that a bad thing if you are in one? macbook, iphone, ipad, apple watch. these are great products with great software and that software works in unison wonderfully.  If i were on a laptop that ran windows, i would probably be a lot more inclined to not have any apple products and go with the android ecosystem, because the features in apple devices just wouldnt work with my setup half the time.
Common both of you are being silly. This is so bias ots unreal :)
Is it a paid promotion?  MKBHD announces best phone of the year every year I haven't seen he chose an iPhone as the best smartphone in recent years.
I do not ever want to be financially funnelled by an organisation where I am the customer. I earned my money to use it as liberally as I please. Apple loses
You have alot of phones cant you just spare me one
What a biased comparison. They both are clearly paid by apple or apple fanboys.
If you use Android regularly then split screen is definitely a huge help. It made handling tasks easier.
Biased judgement here.... The Samsung may not be the best here, but it deserves some more points..
hey arun can you give me a mid range 4 GIGS of ram phone?
Extremely Biased video.. that's like asking an apple fanboy about ios vs Android
Please consider vivo X 80 pro
Android engineers innovated product, Apple has Intrapreneurs that innovated an ecosystem. It may take a while for Android phone brands to understand this. Sony may look small now..but they have the right USP to connect the ecosystem that they build for the future. 😊
Fanboys
Pp isn’t supported in yt premium right now
Mkbhd is the real boss
They should've compared Iphone To Samsung. Cause now "Android" is too generalized. 🤦🏾
I STILL WOULD NEVER GIVE UP MY NOTE PHONE FOR ANY IPHONE
Wow, I finally discovered MKBHD to be an iPeddler, Software features are where I lost it, draw? Android is opensource, if you want it to be, you can almost beat iOS in many other categories, modding community is not a shrinking minority, it has never been better, I've been here from the beginning, back when Xiaomi was MIUI on Google Nexus One.
Apple Must've paid these guys alot
Honestly... this is the most shit video you guys created... you guys are only looking at USA and Uk perspective... in world market this is not happening.. if you have just 10k followers its ok.. but you guys are pioneers in this segment.. world is watching u.. i still dont understand why you guys made this video and.. it completely stubborn and apple marketing video... i will rate 0.000001 for MKBHD here..  i even wondered they gave positive for apple in battery segment!! weird!!
Very disappointing video. This was in no way a comparison video. It's basically a commercial for IPhone. Arun just allowing Marques to dominate his channel.
It was a no brainer that mkbhd will pick iphone. He is so obsessed with apple that most of his videos are of apple products.  P.S: I am an apple user myself. Still i think he was wrongly biased to iphone at many places here.
The only reason I continue to use iOS/iPhone is because of one specific APP...GoodReader  If iOS did not have this APP available I would instantly switch to an Android.  GoodReader adds a ton of features I need to make the price tag and locked up OS of Apple justified  ...for me
Clearly Google did something that pissed MKBHD, so after publicly dissing Pixel for quite a while he now wants to ignore all the strength of Android and Android phones, and doesn't want to give Android the points where it truly deserves. And they call it "ACTUALLY" better, as if there's some objective scale of how better a complete phone is.
basically, if you have a specific/niche use case for your phone, try to find the matching android phone for it. they can also have the newest features for the tech geeks out here if you just use your phone normally and just want it to work, easier to use, just find the most valuable iphone price
Enjoy you both so much but this was super bias. You were giving iPhone points for categories you both acknowledged they lost. Super strange. I know Marques is an iPhone fanatic so maybe you were being kind to a guest but… not an honest video unfortunately.
We have to remember one thing, that its one phone vs a plathera of different phones. That in itself is a big achievement..
Too Biased.. Sorry.
This is the worst comparison of all time.
What editing softwares and resources do these people use, for this amazing output other than premier and after effects
❤️
Android because you don't have to pay $1000 for usbc connector and 120hz display
For hardcore gamers there's no contest, you have to choose Android, Apple kind of lags in screen responsiveness, I can't specifically tell what it is, could be due to a lesser touch sampling rate, who knows, but Apple phones feel a little less responsive. Niche situation, but that's what keeps me from jumping to Apple's wagon
Android for me everytime. Do I want to be locked in to a single manufacturer with a single app store with little chance of outside modifications? No way. Apple is a money sucking dumbed downed version of any device. It has always appealed to non-technical idiots and recent attempts to reverse this trend have only revealed that people (who know anything about technology, it's cost and flexability) will chose Andriod because they don't want to be seen as a mindless Apple subjugate.
This video was trash; you can't talk about the "range" of android phones as if it's a bad thing, then ignore that iphones are very limited in options. You effectively use the wide variety of android devices as a negative.
Seems pretty biased towards Apple
lmao iphone fan be like android has better things but still like iphone better XD
used android for a few years and got really sick of the inconsistency.  bought an iPhone 12 Pro and never looked back, or forward even. I simply do not care to buy iPhone 13 or 14, it’s still doing pretty solid.
Did anyone else, but me find it funny that Marques gave many points to Apple, but is still primarily an Android user? Fun fact... When I used to work at Verizon, I used to recommend iPhones to pretty much everyone, but I used an Android as my daily driver. This always intrigued my customers.
I'll go for android.
As an artist I do use Samsung split screen to see the photo and draw on the program. It would be cool to see a cloud gaming comparison for latency.
What about antennas? It seems forgotten. But it's very important for those of us who need to make phone calls on a daily.
It's Looks like pad video by iphone..  😂🤣
The thing I hate about Apple is the way you get in and out of individual apps .. every app is different and it drives me mad. On Android, the back button gets you out of almost any app, that's enough for me to have a poor user experience and not use one.
iphone won and still not even best phone :D because s22 ultra is best in the world now. but you ask him and he just makes giving points. I dont see how iphone is better then adroind at all.
i also dont like curve screen
Totally a biased review here. Don't agree with you just my cents.
All of these wins for Apple were so slight that the wins don't really matter, and MrW was allowing MKBHD basically give Apple wins when MrW would have given more credit to Android.  Lets face it MKBHD isn't the worst kind of Apple fanboy, but he still is one.  I disagree with the end result of this video and think there is a bias for Apple which discolored this comparison.
I'm a galaxy s person for years and no matter what i uould still  choose my android galaxy over and over again with no regrets or seconds thoughts over an iPhone 👍👍
Nice ad for iPhone I guess? Did not like it when you gave points for reliability and customization to iPhone which is shite and eons behind Android.
This video is an example that no matter who you are. Expert, experienced or otherwise... human beings are biased. It was unbelievable how forcefully iphone was praised, and android was neglected. Focused only on what iphone can do, and android can't do.   You don't have to go far in the video to know how biased it is. Givining a freakin draw for screen quality is absolutely ridiculous! Samsung screen is miles better, miiiiles!   I am specifically shocked seeing Marqous being this biased. Totally ruined the video. You can see Arun was surprised by some of the choices Marquos made, but Arun decided to go with it.   Staying objective is really difficult. But being this biased was kinda pathetic.
I like Android. Good Keyboards, Customization using Different tyes of Launchers, Widgets, Dialers, Apps are free or less expensive, Dialers etc., Good looking attractive Android phones are available in the market.... so many good features are available in Android phones but you have not discussed in this video.
Mkbhd is a racist.
You never talked about iPhone and the wierd touch issues you have with all screen protectors, my GFs 13 mini is really wierd, we tested alot of the screen protectors, none of them works well at all. Almost all android phones dont have issues.  Or the fact that iOS apps behave wierdly then the same android apps, you need to be more presice on iOS apps then android, my big fingers really cant use iPhone at all.
One feature that's amazing and samsung only is outputting audio to multiple Bluetooth headphones. Can mix and match brands and models unlike iPhone that keeps you locked in with their mediocre airpods. You can also have separate app audio going to Bluetooth devices which is nice if you want to use your phone while music playing off somewhere else.
Only thing missing from this video was a "paid by Apple" message at the end.
Carbon  neutral apple make me laugh like ace ventura. Go visit China apple factory. I fell kill gates  is everywhere
MKBHD is getting biased over the period.
one of the most biased video ever by you two :-) personal preference holds no ground in a review
Enjoyed this video more than I thought I would, it was even insightful even. Great video fellas. Loved it.
The best phone for you is the one you use. No matter what the spec sheet, the test scores, and the reviewers say or which eco systems the phone belongs to, if none of them is relevant to the phone you prefer, then they don't matter to you.
this has to be paid by apple at this point, how can you compare a top end 1000 dollar iphone 13 pro max with avg android phones? you have to compare the android on same price point.
Hey fanboys, just saying, Samsung has Quick Share for years. Goodbye.
Poor content. Too based to be a honest comparision   ( I use both iPhone and android)
Sir I need i phone or samsung flagship please
Wow such iPhone fanboys. Never trusting what they say again. First point talking about screen refresh rate. IPhone just got 120 refresh rate. Android has had 144 refresh rate since years ago. And they still treated Apple as a reference to beat... Never trusting them again.
Android gets a huge point for properly being able to set a default app for everything. iOS does not let you do that for many important elements.
That was more like "let's praise the unimaginative and innovation-less iPhone"
i did not expect this. terrible comparison. so biased
I like them both, but what i really like about Android is the fact i can download music from my pc to an sd card. I have both phones, but if i could only have one for whatever reason it would be Android.
Love on convo
screen is a draw! thats a joke! samsung screen is way better
Ok, iPhones overall may be the more stable, faster phone but android isn't too far behind...iPhones are boring af whereas android phones are definitely more innovative and pack more features... but most of all,  I can't stand Apple's arrogance and its condescending attitude toward their customers.
Its a bit weird to compare Android (10s of different manufacturers) vs Iphone. Cool video thou GJ
Most biased video I have ever seen. This video is belongs to iPhone specifically but the user experience and day to day usage,  iPhone sucks 100%. MKBHD is biased to iPhone from beginning.
Arun this is going to be your most disliked video. Android fanboys are losing it and throwing tantrum 😂😂😂
Dear sir , you are comparing one Iphone against many Android phones . How is that truly fair? One versus many
How wish, one day in my life I'll own a fair machine Dell XPS & have all time internet access🤔 bless God! I'll get daily meal on my family's table 🙏
This is the best "no matter how better is Android... I still pick Iphone" ad I've ever seen...
if you compare the both on top end i would also say iphone. But for most who cant afford 200 dollars phone, i think its android hands down. Also not everyone in the world got US type contract iphone bundled from their carrier. Therefore unlocked iphone SE comes with premium price (same goes with pixel actually)
In the end there isn’t a clear winner or loser  It depends on the consumer  For me while I think the new android phone looks nice and pretty  I’ve switch many times from iPhone to android to flagship android  And I always go back to iPhone because of the core features like iMessage,FaceTime  When I had a android apps that I had on iPhone didn’t work the same way  Wasn’t smooth all the time  Like he said one day camera would work and other take time to load   I didn’t use the widgets   My preference always will be iPhone because I like how simple and easy to use and how pretty things are in the OS
Seems like the promotions are going well for 14 release. 😐
Maachane
The biggest factor for me are the apps.  IOS just have better apps and are more polished.
Of course Iphone is better to a man who lives in a country where Apple Headquarters is located 🥴
Why you use 0.5 point for every your vote?
I like iphones and android but this video got me 😴
iPhone d ryders
I can tell you are a clear iphone fan boy you gave iphone 6gb ram more value than the 12gb & superfast charging no value
this feels like a debate between ios & android user XD
I use split screen so much!
When you talk about Infinix?
Wow! Loved watching you guys do this!
Biased not so correct,  iphone fan boy  need to work hard.
IPhones are for teenage girls
I've never owned an iPhone, and have been using Samsung phones since the S8. Currently on the S22U. Gotta say, Apple is killing it right now. I just can't use iOS lol
0:29 Did he say android is average???/
My eyes is satisfied thanks aarun haha
what about repairability ?! how can a company with such low ratings of reparability score high on eco-friendliness. this comparison felt off ...
Battery is all the same IMO. it's the phone (chip) that controls the battery that makes the phone run longer.
Lol .. coming from two apple faniboys this means ZERO   mkBJ gurgles tim cooks juice
plot twist "this video was sponsored by Apple Inc."
ultra for the win
I really feel this video was all about uplifting the fall of iphones🥸  Call recordings File transfer from mobile to laptop, (not every1 uses a macbook) Stupid hotspot (doesnt work all the time) Earphones only Apple compatibles Inacurate copy paste Expensive repiars Battery backup, etc  There are a lot of things that the iphone lack, hope it gets upgraded after bew ios
They are clearly giving it to iphone all the time
I use split screen all the time on my OnePlus phone.
Android phones *need* more RAM ;)
Very weird scoring system, very biased because they didn't include other Android brands like Xiaomi and Oppo. Overall a pointless video as it wasn't a fair comparison in any shape or form.
We rarely even talked about designs and finishes on the smartphones .. the iphone has owned the same looks for  past years .. someone could possibly give a big hint of how the coming iphone 14 and 14 pro max could look like .. but the android system has been way better (exclusive) to this aspect if I may say .  .. a 🆕 video would be well appreciated 👍 by me from our 2 best reviewers .  We love you and hope you do something about this ... Really.. I'm so upset right now ..
When you just dabble through, Android wins. When you get into the details, iOS wins
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Display: Android Performance: Android Battery: Android Camara Photo: Android Camara Vídeo: iOS Eco consciousness: iOS Software Reliability: iOS Software support: iOS Pricing: Android
This was Dopeeeeeeeeeee
When Arun also said that for the videography it's hands down the iPhone  Android fans (hyperventilating): are you kidding me?
Totally biased
iPhone frame leaving dents on fingers
I myself own an iphone 13 pro and an iphone 12 pro max but still find myself running back to my s21 ultra every single time ..
I'd completely say  the android deserves way better scores Dan is rated by both reviewers .. it has by far a better ecosystem and user environment than the iphone . I could pick up 10 different android phones and have 10 different 😎 awesome  feelings after using each of them.. .on the . camera aspect the vivi x80 squashed my thoughts ..cause I felt the iphone had a better camera.  To wrap it all up .. the android ecosystem has a better suiting excitement for all users .. it might be tough to consider but it's very true .. thanks 🙏 and God bless ..
The end result of this REALLY surprised me. I expected Android to have a better perception.. Personally and objectively, if you're talking about getting the most function for your money, Android is where it's at. From a purely technical standpoint Android is frankly, way more versatile and advanced and I'm being honest. At 12:15 (the section about software features), I felt like Android was SERIOUSLY under represented. I could get technical, but I won't. Most people would underplay something like Samsung Dex, until Apple does it (most recently with its variant called Stage Manager) and then something that matters to no one "suddenly" matters to everyone.. There is a real "Halo" effect around iOS that has existed since the inception of the iPhone. That's not to say that the acclaim Apple's iOS have been getting is not warranted. I have always appreciated iOS's polish and simplicity. The end user experience is what sells to the most people and I get that (its probably why Apple obfuscates app crashes, choosing not to alert the user unlike on Android). Keep it slick, keep it simple. Its a good approach (especially for making money). But I have always liked the dynamism of the Android environment and their willingness to experiment with new ideas since day one.. And that experimentation is what pushes the software industry forward (and Apple often capitalizes on those very ideas).. And I get that software updates are a big deal (and they are) but Apple's walled garden and vertically integrated approach to software and hardware makes software updates a MUCH simpler thing pull off but at the expense of versatility (since its not actually needed).. Android was built to be versatile. There are way too many variables (including mobile chipsets and hardware manufacturers) on the Android side that (because it was built to be portable) makes it definitively more versatile but at the expense of ease of optimization.. Google's own update cycle is great for Android as an operating system but difficult for manufacturers to keep up with, which will result in a higher overall cost per update.. Stuff like that simply doesn't exist on Apple's side.. Both approaches to software design have their advantages..  But for me at the end of the day and despite tablet or desktop class apps being under represented on Android (which is no fault of the operating system itself), I'm more of a function over form kind of a guy... And when it comes to the most value for your money (because remember, not everyone has that), it's Android all the way.. In fact even if money isn't an issue, it would still be Android all the way.. I kid you not, I can ACTUALLY do more functionally with a 3 year old Samsung S10 on the cheap, than I can probably do with the latest iPhone and that's not even an exaggeration.. Where Apple is clearly ahead is in its silicon (mobile chipsets).. If Android devices had the same calibur of silicon, this really wouldn't be a discussion for me.. Objectively. But I do also get the fact that not everyone is technically inclined..  I know this sounds cynical but here is the way I see it. For the technically inclined.. If you're broke, buy an Android for certain.. If you've got the money, uhh.. Buy an Android (but secretly hate the fact that Apple silicon is so good while hoping that Qualcomm or some other chipset manufacturer creates a technical miracle).. If you're NOT technically inclined.. Well.. Buy an Apple device. It has everything you need and nothing you don't.. But be prepared to pay for it.. And if you can't, there is always an Android device waiting for you..
Ifone is like an old person and no fountain of youth for them. But android has some much more to offer you get ur money's worth with android
Android vs IOS!
How are y’all totally missing uvc and other hardware support for android that iPhone doesn’t have? Plus DeX (which Apple is kinda halfass pushing now)?
Two apple fanboys doing android vs iphone, nice.
How are y’all totally missing uvc and other hardware support for android that iPhone doesn’t have? Plus DeX (which Apple is kinda halfass pushing now)?
Wow display does not ducking matter
I have both phones and the only thing that was a real win was the battery life iphone has a better battery...everything else was trash...Best display (hello Android has a folding one)features that the other doesn't have(yeah iphone does not have a folding display)...FaceTime really so we're going to pretend as if everyone isn't not using google Duo even on iphone,ipad,and macbook...just biased 😑 trash
the best of the best
This so bias...tie on display Android literally have a folding display...features that iphone does not have yeah a folding display
This final score is load of bull*shit. I couldn't use nicer words. You could add tons of more comparisons where android would beat the crap out of iphone, especially with the earlier iphone models that are still being used.  This iphone is by far their best one ever, earlier versions had lot more flaws. I agree that the 13 pro max is the best phone to buy today, that comes from android user, not that much of a fan, just prefering android, but this score is just ridiculous. You cannot name the video like this and show so crapy comparison.
Let him try the Vivo X80 PRO
I actually agree with the results. As much as I dislike Apple for their anti-consumer business practices, their phones are much more polished than androids. As a tinkerer, I prefer android for my needs. But 80% of the people out there with the budget to buy an iphone, will be better served by an iPhone than an android.  The old saying about apple products... it just works! It is still very much valid.
He’s a koala
Whatever they praise about Android  They're Iphone Loverssssss Just say it Iphone.,slightly,comparatively , Although,how ever,Technically seriously.
Can I just say that Samsung has Quick Share which is just as good maybe even better than Airdrop they just don't advertise it so many Samsung users don't know it exist I've never seen an add for it, but Airdrop would be classed as better because more people have IPhone if you walked into a room
i have an iphone and an android. i DON'T use the iphone for so many reasons. - the software is clunky, it's inconsistent, sometimes the menu bar is at the bottom, othertimes it's at the top. sometimes you swipe left to go back, othertimes swiping left don't work. sometimes settings is in the settings app, othertimes its in the app itself. - the iphone seems to love coming alive in my pocket, the camera and the torch comes on in my pocket every now and then and i couldn't find a way to disable the options. i'm surprised apple intends to have lockscreen widgets. widgets are meant to be active after you've unlocked your phone. what's the point of locking your phone if it can still be used!? - charging and lightning port - extremely poor notifications, you check your notifications on andriod phones but you ignore all notifications on iphones - you have the option to stop charging your android at 85%, so you can leave your android phone to charge overnight. there's no way to do anything like that on the iphone.  the list goes on, i cannot understand how they would rank androids that poorly. definitely androids have the better experience.
Why was he averaging out Android phones? This is a bad video and it will always be bad unless you have two people one who loves apple and one who loves android state their case and have an unbiased person to award points. MKBHD is definitely biased, to say that you'd take the iphones camera over things like the pixel, Samsung's phones, or the sony Xperia is super biased. I can understand the video portion. But you're reaching bro.
How convenient that you guys praised Apple in almost every category (eco-friendly? Come on) just days after you got invited to the WWDC…
Ther is numerous aspects that are ommited , and i do not agree with the format of the talking, nothing is compared objectively ....  Please take this to LTT .....
Odd that they don't use split screen on android phones. I use mine semi-often when I am needing to do math (using Mint and calculator in split mode), or when I am reading an article or something and for some reason need to cross reference another app or screen multiple times in one session. It is one of the more handy features that Android has, IMO.
LG V60 BEAT THE SAMSUNG AND IPHONE IN BATTERY AND EVERYTHING ELSE,,,THEY KNOW SO MUCH THAT DO NOT KNOW SHIT....
I like both these guys, but i still feel this is a bit biased. I'm think both these guys have always leaned team apple and kinda pick and choose good features and shy away from the blunders and lack of innovation apple does suffer from. I would think they really would be tied. Especially since ecoconsciousness has nothing to do with features and performance and samsung S22Ultra has been crowned best over all shooter by many big name youtubers.
Just bought my S22 Ultra today 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is clearly a comparison of flagship Android vs apple thats it. Its not fair. May be for them apple is enough coz they are not using Android to the full extent
Gaming is not for iphones. Every new game first hits on android and stays there for a while before being run on apple. For mmorpg games being the first one to launch wins because there are limited servers
Iphone 👎👎👎👎 and best Samsung s31 ultra top
And the exeges on an android are more so act like a bumper
You also got to look at integration with the brands other products and accessories and special features with those products
Yes but with flat edges on iPhone it makes it more susceptible to being shatterd
Samsung android THE BEST! Android had so many useful apps you cannot find on iphone. So many Iphone apps you have to pay. I cannot find thr apps i need on iphone. Spen very useful. No multi-screen on iphone. Iphone very hard to customize. I dont care about the plus of iphone, what i need is the ease of use.
Kind of tough comparing android as a whole vs apple. If it was Samsung alone, the score wouldn't be so swayed towards apple. But of course the beauty of android is the verity which comes with it's downsides too.
Really? EcoConsciousness? That's a dumb category. This is about the technology. Not company stances.
I know most views were extremely individual preference for both sides but a video like this deserved a bit more objective approach. Some features mkb highlighted as game changing was mostly for him, its ok to give his own personal opinions but a video title like this deserved a bit more respect. Everyone knew iphone may win the battle but it felt like android didn't even had a chance, its wild.
The amount of in-depth understanding that MKBHD has about tech is simply insane...
Hate iPhone’s overexposed sky. Just so so unreal!
Apple fanboys🤦🏾‍♂️
The fact that one apple phone is being compared to a lot of Androids is a win for Apple. It makes life simpler and with all these complexities these days having one less thing to worry about is very important. (I'm a student and can't afford apple)
I dont keep one phone, never been a fan boy. But android is still a shitter on Samsung. I am going to iphone again. Google pixels are not top of the line but I assume they might be well optimized unlike samsung shitters
You have. A   tie up with i phones.
Nokia 3310 is better than both!
I wanted to see iOS 16 implement basic functionalities which Android has had for years like system wide scroll screenshot, notification categories, app lock, manual camera settings!
very nice
What about security?
This vedio is sponsored by Apple. 😂
bro said iphone battery life is better 😂😂nahhh what
this sounds like a debate that only rich people have bruh
this video is a joke.  Iphone can beat Android sure, but this score is a scam
I had 2 S22 Ultras and they both had dreadful gals. I downgraded back to the S21 ultra and to me it's so much better. It's better optimised and battery seems better too.
iPhone is eco...? They sell you more paper (phone with paper, charger with paper, headphone with paper). How can you say iPhone is eco friendly?
I just want to know one thing? What weed did MKBHD smoke before shooting this video?
I am a 4th gen Samsung user (Note 10, Note 20 Ultra, S21 and S22 Ultra) and out of curiosity I bought an iPhone 13 Pro and an Apple Watch 7. I immediately adopted the watch and retired my Galaxy Watch 4. Regarding the phones, I have both on my desk, but when I leave, i take my s22 Ultra with. There is absolutely NOTHING i cannot do with it, and there is nothing I cannot connect with. It is a productivity/connectivity beast. But I know that for certain tasks, the iPhone is the superior phone. Camera and battery life, for example. I will keep both phones, and I will optimize their use. Great video.
iphone vs android phones  wow one vs all 🤔
os dois crush de tecnologia de todo mundo num video só
I use iPhone is because of iOS!!  Dont really care about all the other hardware feature.. Its basically 50-50 game nowadays!
Como que empate en pantalla fanboys de apple si el S22 ultra tiene mas brillo mas resolucion
I have realized a long time ago that MKBHD is an apple boy. And I'm perfectly okay with it even though I've always been on android.
I have an idea for a new software for probably both. I think they should create a new option in the notification settings, which is to allow a  auto clear function to give the option to set a time for all notifications to be cleared 🤷🏾‍♂️ just a small idea Ig
I love your channel so this means no disrespect, but the title says Android and it seems your video only talks about Samsung in the beginning.  Does that mean Samsung has become so dominant in the marketplace, that it is now synonymous with Android?  Having watched the total video, it makes me think of getting an iPhone because it does seem better
What's a good iphone for an 13 yr old
The Android wins more in all categories in my opinion.  A great video brothers please stay safe.
Waaaaaaaay off… but they are iPhone users
I Love How He Recorded Using An Iphone Camera At The End  (;
FEATURES, people buy Android phones and tablets because of FEATURES that even Apple claims it has no respect for but then gives you the Apple Pencil, and then gives you widgets, and now they're working on always display, cameras with more zoom, so on, and so on.
This Samsung s20 is my last android. It has only brought me hell. The goddamn thing isn't even 2 years old and there is already so much wrong with it. It overheats all time, causing the battery life to shorten even further. On the inside of my phone something is broken, causing it to now be able to charge using a cable. I brought it to some repair shops but they had no idea what it could be. I have to charge it wirelessly now and btw, fast wireless charging doesn't even work. Wireless charging causes the phone to overheat even more, making it so that the battery goes down even while charging, so I need to turn the phone completely off. Then there are the countless software issues with apps crashing and unending loading times. Literally the only thing this phone does good is take decent photos. Worst purchase of my life was this damn phone. Should just have bought an iPhone 12 since it was the same price anyways.
Samsung phones don't use slave labor to make their phones, this is just a tad relevant just saying.
i know iphone is a good and powerfull phone .. its almost perfect phone ...but i dont know why i . still love android .. and unintrested with iphone... iphone is almost perfect phone but it kind of boring.. and when i use android.. it got me excited.. for every inovation they made
not getting locked into the Apple community, mandatory replacement fees or repair costs etc puts the Android ahead for me
iPhone display go dim automatically in sunlight or even in overcast weather which is so annoying and hard to use. And there is no one talk about it
The apps is the reason you are using a smartphone for the first place 10-0 to apple .. android will take the eco system comfortability advantage but improving the eco system futures is way easier over time then filling the gap with quality devs for me apple is clearly in charge with the best foundation.
Iphone is better for a average user in Europe or rich countries where people can buy it. In the rest of the world Android is better only because the pricing
Battery life should be couple together with charging speed. You can have lesser phone life but with faster speed charger, the disadvantage become advantage already. No need 15 min, 5 min already put more juice in android fast charging
Won't buy any notched iPhone
This is NOT Android vs iPhone. Its Samsang vs iPhone!
samsung completely dropped the ball this year with their flagship. I have the 22 ultra and can tell you the 21 was far more stable and smooth
Seems like a paid promotion.
Great Collab!
thank you guys for the nice casual video. I would like to share my honest opinion about it. I'm a gadget and tech lover and I have always used both operating systems and I love particular things about each. However, I felt this video was a little unfair to the Android despite the fact that I agree about many things said. The reason it is unfair it's because Apple is the owner of the iOS and also the iPhone. While Android is just a system and it's used by so many manufacturers, where some of them, produce much better quality than apple in some areas. So the best comparison would be to do one to one comparison between an iPhone and a particular android phone from a particular company. For example, some Chinese companies are excellent at the battery capacity and fast charging where apple has yet long to go. Another example is ROG phones and  those gaming phones where they beat Apple in the GPU department. There is also those manufacturers who produce more value and budget handsets where Apple is way behind and doesn't even care about those users. So in general the video is fun but a bit lacking .😉
Aka Paid promotion
Na should be closer then that.......
I just switched to iPhone 13 Pro Max. There are things that I really miss like the convenience of answering a message while still continuing watching a video on Youtube on the other half of the screen, and also the ability the copy files directly to a usb drive.
valid
Not sure why important aspects like security were left out…
Imagine if iOS is also being used on other brand of smartphones, I think that would be a different experience...
The s21 ultra is definitely my favorite phone ive used.
in my opinion apple misses ALOT of the basics
I'm a gamer and I know this is an irrelevant topic  Samsung is wack on gaming it would literally just shut down and not turn on if to much game is played without even overheating 😒
Riiiiiiggged!!!😫😫😫
What was the comparison??? An average Android phone vs Apple's best phone?? 🤣🤣🤣
You are unfair at this! Android is full of options, It's the freedom to do what you want, Iphone not even close
Pls pls pls pls can i have a phone pls
I'm gonna have to disagree on some things, Android has always had more features and still does while IOS is always trying to catch up, for example widgets, always on screen, samsung Dex that can literally turn your  phone into a pc.... Secondly, the huge notch and the prices of iphones are a complete deal breaker for me. Imagine paying 1500 USD and having a huge notch, the screen in my opinion is THE MOST important aspect of the phone cause its what you look at all the time. Also the prices for different iphones for what you get in terms of features is ridiculous. Iphone 13 950$ with tax for a 60hz screen, really??
Display should've gone to Android💀
I'll probably never buy an iPhone for myself because I'm cheap and I'd rather buy a last year's slightly used Samsung Galaxy. But even if price was not a consideration I think iPhones are annoying. Like the iMessage "user added a heart" stuff they send as SMS, or the special magic charging plug, or the slow/no charger in the box, or $20 for a cable etc. It's just obnoxious. But I know that some people love them, and godspeed to them as well. I would just like Apple to be less of a dick about interoperability with Android phones.
I would just dislike this video and make sure no more reviews like this will be made. The only strong thing iphone have is it's camera. Done. The rest of the features like double screens / pop-up screen, file management, Google ecosystem (google maps, drive, doc online, email, assistant, goole search, etc...)  rounded corner screen, type-c connection, USB flash drive straight into the phone (plus memory card), phone to phone wireless charging, foldable phones, make android a winner .... there are so so many features that iphone do not have. That is a 80% to 20% win 🏆 for androind.
C mon, IPhone with a notch still, should disqualify it from even being mentioned in this challenge
good commercial
How about talking about the cobalt apple uses in their phones that are literally mined by 4-12 year olds in CONGO.... lets not be hypocritical by saying apple cares for the environment when children who are a future of the environment are sent into hard labor just so a certain company in america functions
This video let me down
If huawei not get the ban will have a diferent story, but yes iphones is the best phones for now!
I hope Apple at least bought you dinner before. Extreme bias. All the way to leading questions.
the one and only reason why I prefer iPhone over android is the ecosystem and nothing else but this is very very important for me and I just can’t imagine living without it  It feels so easy to make a presentation or getting a job done on iPhone and it makes it fast.. otherwise I get it that android have changed alot over the years and iPhone stayed the same and could be boring for some people but still deep inside iOS have a lot of features that many people don’t know about
MBK just riding apple lol
I use Siri but it sucks ass compared to Google assistant. If the iPhone had USB-C and you could set Google Assistant as the default assistant then IPhone would be ultimate, but it doesn’t so…
I am still using an Android phone that is going to be FOUR years old, Android 9.0 O/S, and it still does everything I want to.  I wonder how much money that saves compared to upgrade to the latest / greatest...?
When I heard Apple for taking the pictures won, I got bored. I take zoom shots and night shots.
This video confirmed what I've been thinking on for the past few months, somehow both MKBHD and Arun have shifted to a more general opinion view, I'm guessing to get to more people. instead of being a channel where you would check to see what's new and who's innovating in the tech world, it has become just mainstream media with all over the place opinions. This comparison is just too weird and way off to even comment about.
يبدو أن الفيديو مدفوع أو أنك متعصب للآيفون غريب التقييم غير منطقي أبدا
I never disagreed this mich with a video of you
Also some of the questions were not only biased but also irrelevant e.g which camera would your pick for life is not something we ask ourselves when selecting phone cameras a better question would be to mimic real world scenarios e.g which phone camera would you want to take to a concert or group night out
This was more of Android Phones vs iPhones not the OS comparison as I expected, great video though.
This just look like pay promotion of Iphone
Laro
I always want to see you two do a collaboration 🥰
Feels like an iPhone ad tbh
You cannot do gesture for ios camera which is a blessing in Samsung phone. It is quite reliable and handy, especially when you don't want your phone to be shaky when you snap. In samsung, it just works. Only thing I should complain about samsung is that its poor quality of battery. It swells over short period of time.
2021 vs. 2022, lol?
Man love ♥️
Which game was he playing there at 2:23.. anyone please
Faster reload or extended mags.
You kidding me??
The iPhone app just crashes with no error message... (The primary reason I use a PC, not a Mac.) But that's Apple. I am shocked at how much better the score is, but I've never used an Android phone (and only one small Android pad that didn't cut it, but I'm on my 10th iPad - already paid for the apps. Yup, locked in, bot usually OK with that...)
There's way more to the Andriod OS that you guys choose to ignore.
I learned from the sopranos  that the boss doesn’t wear shorts
Totally biased video towards iPhones. Disappointed!
Use to respect you guys opinions on phones but seeing how much you lean into iPhone was ridiculous.
My dad is your taxi 🚕🚕
Bias as anything ask a question and the iPhone fan boy gives the point 😂🤦
Both guys are going to loose a few subscribers here...the watershed moment. Especially MB. This apple fanboy video was probably not needed. Oops
I just want to perform simple tasks quickly and easily. iOS for me
I’m still on my iPhone XS Max.
This was not "Android vs IOS" This was best of Iphone vs worst of Android 😂😂😂
Giving the display points to Apple killed the video from the start. Was a bit disappointing video which possibly damaged both guys reputation of brand neutrality.
Went to the comment section first before deciding not to watch this seemingly biased video
Really loving how butt hurt the Android fan boys are here.
Android clowns 🤡 going mad
Never had a corrupted photo on the Samsung galaxy s21
Very very biased video it's as though apple has sponsored/paid for this video
It was predictabile. They are two very basic tech reviewers😢. Guys that use phone as a basically social media device should always take iPhone. If you're interested in stuff like tasker, apps that use developer options, side loaded apps, torrents, ADB etc. that it's a different story.
Mkbhd is an Apple fanboy! Why even make this video???
Look I love android, but apple has their system down and the higher specs of other phones still cannot get over some of the shoddy performance of many apps. Apple was smart to take EVERYTHING related to phone production in-house (well minus the screens of course) as it really does allow them to optimize the entire experience.   I just wish they’d open up iOS a bit more for customizations
Bro i know but that not fare all things  i phone 😐👎 . For me i see S22 ULTRA  is better phone in 2022 for me its 👍😍😍
The video didn’t sucked! 👍👍
Biased 😂
First thing I would've disliked from this creator
The fact that they disagree on many things is why need both of them to make videos.  Also nokia has been categorised as fringe. Not very kind of you...
I think you guys like iphone that much, that it's very clear you are being biased
Android is better
How much Apple paid you?
poxo x4 pro hs best screen price for 250 pounds, but always freezes on apps and camera .
IMessage or FaceTime being a selling or pick point for a phone is non sense.
Pixel does 5 years as well now of updates
One more can be there like been able to try unique tech and having your hand to the latest tech
Android is too inconsistent! Every brand release updated whenever they want. Some are running different versions. They  different UI’s added by the different manufacturers. After a while I gets old.
Google Assistant is much better than Siri, I accidentally trigger Siri more than I use it.
The most awful opinions this show that arun has been really sick these days bruh appreciate the good people are not mad at this point bruh
hands down the galaxy runs circles around those rotten apples
Wow....great collab. Love it. Do more of these please
I feel like you guys were avoiding the iPhone disabilities to android
Sponsored by Apple
Mkbhd seems a bit bored and slightly arrogant . Also very biased towards iPhone.
The iphone is also the phone with a trade in, how's that for value?!
Apple must have paid a lot for this video 📹
you should make Samsung S vs iPhone. no one cares about "android"
iPhone is still my last choice of phone even after seeing this video
My two favorite men EVER!
I used IP 12 with 4gb. i made a change from S9+ and I was very disappointed,  4gb was not enough, not I have 13pro with 6gb. It is slighlty better, but still some apps are killed in bacground. I am surprised you guys are placing IP higher than S in RAM comparison
As someone who hated on apple my whole life, saw them as overpriced pieces of junk. Now I can confidently say that apple wins in every department. Tablet is infinitely better than any other android tablet. Iphone beat android phones solely on the fact that they just work more often. The bare minimum for a phone. I no longer care about extra customization. I just want call, text, 2fa and maybe some quick googling. Their laptops have been the worst choices ever, expensive storage, old and overpriced CPU. Recently tho, their laptops are the best in the market. M1 and M2 are such game changers, intel even started trying to copy it. I still strictly use windows tho because I need lots of storage and I need to use heavy 3d software. And I play video games
For the eco consciousness one you forgot something HUGE that immediately makes the iPhone lose  Repairability  Android phone with a broken camera? put a new camera in fried cpu? get a new motherboard or use it for parts to help other devices working as new  iPhone with a broken camera? trash it and get a whole new phone (most people won't recycle them) fried cpu? same outcome
most cases probably has a box shape so I agree with the draw on the display
no competition. iPhone is so fantastic!! the ecosystem is so far ahead of everyone else!
"Iphone for photography" *Laughs in Pro photo mode, Expert Raw, Currently better camera*
Entertaining looking at all these comments. Especially when you consider this is video is just personal opinions. Great video nonetheless
MKBHD seem to have lost it here 😂 Or else No way he could have put Iphone's display over or on par with S22Ultra!! And wen he gave an excuse for not using S22U for not having a strong Vibrating motor he just lost it!! 😂 And again screen customization this one can nvr go to a iphone atleast not right now😂 So for me this is clear tie 5:5
This video doesn't change my mind, I hate Apple  I ❤️ Samsung
They both use iPhone on a daily basis , so comparing the two is a bit odd ...and they both get sponsored by apple
I think arun would not quite agree with a lot of these scores
To hell with Apple, period.
One thing makes me choose Android over Iphone: Free apps and sideload apps. PERIOD.
Android  is the best
My iphone 4 user interface looks the same till date and i m happy that i ditched iPhone after iPhone 4. Happy to be Android guy.  iPhone gives butter smooth experience as what others say, but Android gives user flexibility, customisations and much more. My preference will always be for that as compared to butter smooth decade old experience.
MKBHD was kinda biased towards I phone tbh like on the battery topic and the camera(photography) topic
None of them                                                                                                                            Samsung
Truth is iphone has some kind of charm going for it, its just lovable and some feeling of superiority created around it, not really something practical, bottom line ,as the saying goes an iphone is an iphone thats it .
I prefer samsung over i phone coz i use like 4 5 apps at once , and the multitasking in Samsung is just so much better than any other phone in the market
That was one of the best comparison videos I have seen  -  I’ve watched quite a lot of your posts, and admire your professional approach (and humour). The guy with you in. This one struck me as a remarkably knowledgeable person as well. I have nzever used a mobile phones for either Ava ing or social media, but  have had a mobile phone since 1993, and although I was born in 1952, I have always kept up with tech innovations and still do. What surprised me was how Nokia didn’t.
His video quality is show good that I can see John Cena and the air
The winner i android because you can have one from 150 to 1500€!!! I personally don't care how good the iphone is, I would never pay that much for a phone
Apple is dumb They started reinventing the world by bringing smartphones and smartwatch on the market But they didn't invent the standards of hdmi and usb c today Their teams consist of old people who invented all they could  Apple is losing their marketing
Felt biased. Not that iPhone was going to lose but still. Some of the conclusions are too forced. Case in point the Display. It was given a draw because iPhone feels better to hold? Really? Charging : iPhone might last longer but it also takes significantly longer to charge. A good battery with  a good fast charging is always better than good battery is average charging speeds. Eco-Conciousness: Rubbish point. Every manufacturer wants you to buy new phones and new accessories every year.
Worst mistake I ever made was leaving Android! 13 pro max is literally the worst phone I've ever owned!
MKBHD is an iphone/apple guy, just watch all his videos.
Like come on, even clear android wins are being lowered, it just feels like we cut iphone to much slack and we way too biased
Not exactly phone have come to a point where u really wont be able to see the differnece bw photos or videos until compare them side by side. Most people using higher end phone or the FE kinda phone are pretty satisfied with the quality. Things are getting better but you cant tell then differnect whats the point ?
For gaming , battery goes to Android no cap
They are being look like an iPhone fan by giving so much negative reviews on Android Smartphones. But the real thing is, iPhone is just a normal phone, not a beast. There's lots of features in an Android Smartphones that iPhone doesn't have. and vice versa.
I will never like the ergonomics of these sharp edged phones. Sadly some phone makers are starting to copy Apple in that aspect. It all boils down to would you rather hold a sharp brick or a smooth pebble?
Not sure how they chose gave it a draw for display
The display shouldn't have been a tie, samsung literally supplies the whole market
The crossover we finally saw 🤟🤟🤟
Was this an apple sponsered video? Please let us know guys.
Keep in mind iohone is bad at supporting old phones I tried to move data from iPhone x to iPhone 13 I signed in blah blah and then it turned an unknown error and I had to repeat all the process again for 5 times it still didn't work And remember I bought iPhone 13 it had no charger It just had a cable You might be thinking, I have old phones just use their chargers... Well NO IPhone uses us c for less than 4years and iPhone x had usb lighting charger and not usb c usb c charger In my opinion apple convinced me to not use their products at all Especially the communication between android and apple is so dumb It sometimes doesn't work so I have a very good advertisement for apple: One time apple, everywhere apple. If you get what I mean
MK is just bias towards iphone
Comparing apple and Android is like comparing apples and oranges.  And I love my oranges, so Android all the way FTW🙃
Hey look Samsung is  expensive in USA more than iPhone but if you are living in the Middle East it will be cheaper than iPhone or similar price to the iPhone
Airdrop, shareplay, facetime and imessage do not matter. Androids have apps just like them they are easily replaceable
such an informative video didn't even notice how 20 minutes have passed. very well Done big fans both of yours!!
Team Android 👍🏾🤗💯 until further notice lol
overall Mk is right...but I think I fall within the nitch that use android(OneUi to be precise) for its advancement in customization and overall features. Yes I can leave without Dex, AlwaysOnDisplay, Multitasking, Bixy Routines, PeriscopeZoom, S-Pen, ReverseWirelessCharging, TakingPicturesManual etc...but the overall experience on OneUi is just to me suits my style and I just don’t see myself switching to iOS..but at the same time I applaud iOS for being somewhat open to alot of customization esp the current iOS15 & upcoming 16..
Great review! Surprising to see iPhone has edge mainly on camera and other departments
But this is sponsored by Apple 😂😝👌 Whatevr. Mine s22 ultra🔥 isn't ok ok  its insane😈
I’m so glad i’m not the inly one who swears at Siri.
What a biased iPhone person
This video is an excuse to make ios users feel better for themselves that their phone is special  this video will age as badly as the video that mat pat nade about overwatch vs team fotress 2  This video has choosen one side the ios side Even more sad that youtube trashed freedom of judging  I cant see the number of dislikes for this reason you two decided to touch fire and make a video that it doesnt explain both sides but it is one sided only to apple as it looks like  if it was an actual video about a «REAL» comparison between two oses it could take more than 30 minutes atleast an hour  to explain everything and not 20 fucking minutes  Arun is the only youtuber that makes videos with good content and explains the features   On the other side Marques was mostly apple sided i did not see saying anything good about android  Arun did its best he needs his own video to do a good comparison and not this
Btw if you charge your phone many time per day , that make your battery decline quick ? Long life battery is fk better lol .
🙌🙌🍎
report to the whole site that these are fraudulent
report to the whole site that these are fraudulent
Try Sony Mobile camera... Apple is at bottom.. don't do any rubbish comparison.. paid review
Android 💪🏽💯
I just feel you guys are biased... There more categories that many android phones beat iPhone, but then this wasn't done properly. pick an android phone manufacturer and compare and not the whole bunch, apple is just one company.  A better comparison would have been iOS vs Android OS Or iPhone vs Samsung etc
Summer day watching outside on an s22 ultra at like 10 percent brightness
Worst comparison..
It's "bizarre" that he's using last year's flagship phone because it works better for him?
Notification customisation, accessing your phone book before making a call, short cut to setting on phone features.. All poor on the iphone.
End result mkbhd is a huge apple fan
The main fact android is split into so many other brands it makes it a disadvantage for optimization especially taking pics in other apps, It would be better if it was Samsung vs iPhone or pixel vs iPhone. still think iPhone will come out on top because of optimization(again) but it would be much closer especially with photos and battery life
Security?
Ok another thing is with an android or a pixel more specific editing you can download a bunch of third party apps or the system edits are waaayy better i use both but android gives me more flexibility
The Actual facts between these two never ending debate is that Android vs IOS most talked thing IOS offers less features. so less features means less number of bugs and they only have one universal OS which is controlled by them so developer's are forced to code in only that language and code is more optimized there, no doubts in it's ram management and battery backup it's best and also it's processor whereas in android there are more features so there will be more of bugs and sometimes it takes time to fix them and its all normal for day to day purpose you will find it better soon or later for Android Ecosystem!
Comparing one phone vs the rest of the world...
Marques how much you paid from Apple?😃
Definitely iOS can't be a winner by that Margins. Android a definitely people friendly software and iOS iphone only empties your pocket. I think like we are doing a comparison sitting in Mars or something. Android has given people a phone they can have according to their needs. Impractically High price of iphone is not only spine breaking but also a dividing factor in society. Definitely iphone , not a ideal phone. Sorry to say, Biased review!
What phone do you recommend for around $ 250?
Also something not covered but I think is significant is typing experience.  Android again wins by a country mile.  IPhone keyboard options are abysmal and the ones available like SwiftKey are superior on Android.  For me typing experience is huge.  Don't get me started on sleep mode.  IPhone doesn't have a "real" sleep mode.  On Android sleep mode / dnd means I don't get woken up, I can't say the same for iphone sleep mode.  It just sucks.
The Android phone screen is so much better, it's way more user friendly, customization is insane, file transfer is awesome no matter between mac or pc. The iPhone just feels like you are holding a cuboid.. looks ugly too. The only thing good is the apple ecosystem but that will only matter if you are a real lazy person.
I'm sorry but as an iPhone user, having the display as a tie is just dishonest.  The Samsung display is eons better than the iPhone and it's not even close.  Every aspect of the Samsung S21 Ultra display is significantly better than the iPhone 14 pro, by a country mile.
he has an Iwatch lol
Y does it feel like they are totally apple fans
I saw that Arun was at Mark Rober’s new warehouse!
I disagree strongly in the battery. Charging fast is much much more important than baseline. Basically all phones last all day but what if you forgot to charge your phone? (which for young people going to school and work happens all the time). Faster charging FTW
Well overall iPhone is the clear winner, whether you like it or not! Too Bad
He always praise iPhone. He is apple boi, then and now. So before watching the results is known.
This comparison is unfair and wrong, you see that none of them know about mobile phones, this comparison does not work, better do something else, what to buy a phone
That was a good advert for ios. ✌️
I think that when it comes to iPhone and apps where you gave credit for facetime and others this is fine if all the people you communicate with are using iPhones, otherwise the apps are not so great. iMessage is in fact made worse if you communicate with Android users and would be far better to use messaging third party apps that both platforms can use. That being said the whole endeavour was wrong as you were supposed to be comparing iPhone to Android and not the hardware as one would presume since you are comparing an OS.
Typical I sheeps, nobody cares about I messages only in the USA, the rest of the world use Watsapp.
Call recording, T9 dialing many others not brought up, seemed quite biased especially you flying all the way to the US to give the Android a dismal score. Come on Arun, you can do better than that.
I was so hyped for this video, but I ended up watching 75% of it and then I just couldn't anymore. What the hell happened to MKBHD? That was an Apple fanboy talking there, not a reviewer... I have nothing against iPhones, but this is the least objective video I've seen on this channel. I know it's not your fault Arun, you tried to prove your points. And you were right most of the time. (Also, how the hell can a tech professional say there's not too much of a difference between the screens of S22 Ultra and 13 Pro? It's literally 1750 vs 1000 nits....? I  work in a phone shop and have those two models in hands almost on the daily basis, and you can notice rightaway. The Samsung panels have more vibrant colors and they are crazy bright. My personal phone is the S22+ which is "less" bright than the Ultra and everything looks just like it should, even in the extremes, thanks to the Sunlight mode.)
Android should have won on a couple more features, but you let him walk all over you!  Great video...
I recently switched to iOS, I have always had Androis. iPhone are just better: less customisable but simpler and more effective. Everything related to performance, screens, etc is just smokescreen, it does not really affect how you interact with the device.
This is the most biased video I have ever seen and that's no joke. I expected better than this from you blokes. This is almost like paid advertising for Apple. This video almost makes me feel like unsubscribing.
Even you two are the GOATS of this tech game: "I dont trust both of you, because Android is a more open system, its the same way the better system!" More personality, more pos.tis and you got only minor things to glory the APPLE. At the Android world, you have many big players, there is something for everybody. The Iphone is a corp. its the bad thing in person. You cant beat Samsung, mark my words. You can just order parts, chips and producing from Samsung.
Apple claims to be more eco-friendly, but reparability is a real factor there. You can repair most Andriod phones more easily and cheaper than any IOS device. The longer update support and recycled materials are also an important factor though. Would have been good to see reparability as a separate topic perhaps, just to emphasize that you can actually fix your phones and don't need to toss them as soon as a single component breaks down (or pay someone else to repair it).
Yes, the iPhone is best. However, that is exactly why they can afford to charge so much money for one that half the globe can't afford it. Android may not be the best, but it has a phone for every person. It's the underdog we all need.
The iPhones should bring back the headphone jack with a high res DAC built in for Apple music high res audio, which doesn’t work over Bluetooth
mean while the apple product is dying so they need this video so much lol... for me apple product are all the same looks and UI sooooo boring from pc. laptop, ipad, to phone.. same icon and same looks lol
Good to see you guys together 👍👍👍
I don't know but, 1vsMany is not fair. Iphone is purely program to run on same specs etc. On the other side Android have many types and programs so idk
Samsung the best
This review is so biased. My Samsung battery can last for 2 straight days!
Please collab on all of the things
(There are 5 phones on the table)   Arun : what time is it now?  (Looks at another device for the time)  👀  I guess he really was tired 🥱
Everything  android suppose  to win was called a draw lol
Love both of your guys but really felt this video was biased a bit too much on Apple's side of things -   - a lot of Apple features that they said people can't live without are limited too US - outside of that, even iPhone users have/use a lot of other options  - usb-c charging, plethora of phone options, UI features, right to repair and repair costs, GOOGLE PHOTOS - so many options and factors that you could have made this video on!  Comparing the average of Android against the strengths of iPhone 13 Pro Max would ultimately result in such a lopsided score :/
MKBHD forget about you man. Last time I checked you prefer and use Google Pixel 60% of the time to take pictures.
Good screenplay Very good direction Excellent acting🔥 💯💯💯💯💯
Thanks a lot. I think you could also talk about privacy. I believe it’s an important subject these days.
Dos iPhone Fan Boys opinando sin ningún criterio objetivo. Dos sinvergüenzas.
I use more multitasking though
I love Android phone love Android
Thinks like u guys funded a lot by apple than android 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol iPhone has good battery? I’m a 12 pro max user. So i have the right to talk. Coming to the 12 pro max, the weight of the device feels like a mini brick but battery doesn’t even last one day. With the same amount of weight, i get can 2 day battery easily in an android. And coming to display, u gave .5 for each. I have seen s22 from a friend. The display is no match to a samsung display.
also if you want to buy a phone you can just choose any kind of phone in android category, when you are limited in iphone, you just have to buy one they release every year
still happy with my 100$ Android 😂
Just stop doing these giving scores videos now. Since there a ton lot of options & ton lot of requirements from people around the globe. This versus thing is just literally old off the track & makes us skeptical about you somehow trying to push iPhone sales.  It would have been better if you had said it's just your choices or likes.  In developing countries where few bucks or euros make a huge difference the iPhone is still a senseless status symbol.
Missed a very important criteria when it comes to environmental friendliness. That is, apple severely restricts and prohibits 3rd party repair. Samsung does not do this to even remotely the same degree that apple does.
mad respect for donating to the food thing with ryan
felt kinda biased towards the iphone but great review anyways
If you just want a good phone and can afford it, get an iphone. If there is a special feature you want from your phone, you're probably going to find it in an android phone
Just imagine apple paid them to support iPhone
So I’m in the minority here.  But there’s 3 things I must have on a phone.  A great camera.  Smooth with no hiccups and the most powerful SoC available.  The iPhone has all three of these.   The only thing I’m missing on the iPhone personally is the telescopic lens on the Galaxy S22 Ultra.  But look up Genshin Impact between the two phones and it’s not even close.
It was a decent video. However I believe this video had some massive flaws. If you are comparing Apple to Android in this manner it is automatically going to give Apple the crown. There are so many problems amongst the many different Android devices that you end up being able to choose from which device on Android you would like to compare to. No one has ever argued about LG or HTC being able to compete with Apple. The argument has almost always been (since 2014) Samsung vs Apple. I can completely agree that Apple does an incredible job with screen smoothness and game play, but FaceTime and imessage being constantly painted as life support as well as air drop when Samsung has competition to each one. Call or text from other devices, Google duo (respectfully Google's invention) and nearby share( which some could argue is more secure than air drop.) I personally believe Apple wins against every other Android other than Samsung. And if you claim either is better than the other, they both have pros and cons that would make it a tie.
Apple lacks a few key things which made me switch back to android: -Insane complexity of setting up a ringtone -Same with alarms -Lack of keyboard vibration feedback -Lack of consistency back button -Hard to transfer files over PC -Settings are unorganised -Lightning port  -Notifications -No option to change notification tone -Bad bluetooth codecs -Lack of customisation of basic things -Bad speaker sound -Old versions of apps makes them unusable
it's a marketing strategy for iPhone 14 launch in USA.
I this video is unfair to android. I think you two are fans of Android :) in terms of customisation iPhone is far behind. iPhone is too restricted. Many things are not downloadable on iPhone. Price is too high and for that premium price I would expect the iOS software to be fantastic to command that price but sadly is not because it has many bugs too.
I see what you guys did!  Green Buble (Android) Blue bubble ( iOS) !
answer= depends..... for normal people that is. actual answer is Android. Android means freedom, Independence and applied abilities. Apple denotes a sheep like mentality which is why kids now have apples. our future is being fabricated by the ultra ultra rich. they've already accomplished this if you haven't already it's only a matter of time before you realize how f***** we are
Screen is android for sure.
Android! Plain and simple
Usb-C. Headphone jacks. Being able to use MicroSD cards (a spare 64GB is always handy even when all you want to do take lots of high-res or high-fps video without issue).  For me just these three things make iPhones a non-starter for me. It does help that I use multi-window features and, on my particular phone, the S-Pen quite regularly. 🤷‍♂️
This is a biased review.
Arun made up the sections just to make iPhone winner and Mkbhd fell in that trap! Thats all the video about.
Samsung is not your regular android dummies
Iphones are nice but it's really a ecosystem product if you just want a phone that can do what you want with the freedom of choice than get android I recently went from iPhone to Android and I like Google services wayyyyy more and the offer more. Apple is more streamlined than android but I use multi window for transferring songs from different streamers or temporary passwords I just feel over all iPhone is smoother but very restricted and pushy not innovative at all and boring android is fun exiting and more relaxed
And again you clowns have no idea what you're talking about. Google phones are made more out of recycle materials so you've lost that argument as well but don't even know you have. Secondly, Google is already 98% carbon neutral So Apple loses that argument as well. So what are you talking about when you're saying they're winning the carbon neutral race? You are very clearly behind the curve on your information, but I expect nothing less from an Apple user. Just tell me you believe apples the best at everything because you have an iPhone in your pocket. I would respect you more for that. But in reality everybody on earth knows that Apple sucks, which is why their market share is at 14%.
It's just all Apple brainwashing iPhones aren't easier to use. If you give somebody who never had a phone, a iPhone and an Android they would pick the Android which is why most people have Androids and start off with Androids. Androids in reality are actually easier than iPhones. It's just a fact. In reality, Android sticks to industry standard things, which if you never had a sense of phone before, at least an Android phone is kind of close to Windows, so you kind of know what's going on somewhat with an iPhone. Everything's completely different. Everything's named different. You have no idea what Apple ecosystem is unless you've been in there for 5 years but an Android. You literally know what's going on pretty much. That's why most old people have Android phones, which is also a fact that can't be disputed. But I'm sure some Apple fanboy or girl is going to come in here saying oh no Apple is just easier. You have no idea what you're talking about. Apple is not easier. If it was they would have more than 14% market share, especially nowadays, when you can buy a $300 iPhone, it is very obvious that nobody cares about Apple. At least nobody in the real world!
A lot of those stuff like facetime and iMessage isn't really useful if the other user isn't in their ecosystem so.... Apart from those camera and battery stuff on the iphone,bi found every other thing useless. Although I'm trying to get to use the iphone more
I think if they’d given the victory to Android, it just might have made WWDC a bit awkward for them 😂
And the saddest part about it is these two dudes think people are stupid.
I expect nothing less from two Apple users. 👎🏾! And I love that this man found a way to literally completely make up another pixel glitch that nobody else has. I bet it doesn't save any of your photos when you take a picture. And I also bet The Pixel killed your mom and impregnated your girlfriend as well!
iPhone: no one can touch me S22 Ultra: Androids, assemble *Xiaomi, oppo, oneplus, Google, Asus, Lenovo...*
I feel that all the questions are framed in such a way you get response that apple is better...
I can’t even play my favorite retro games on my iPhone 13 pro
AIRDROP IS NOTHING SPEZIAL: ANDROID HAVE NEARBY SHARE AND SAMSUNGS HAVE EVEN QUICK SHARE
Team Android like this comment.
Iphones are built for simple users. Thats why if you take the best Android Vs. the best iPhone:  Android Wins hands down cuz iPhones a for simpletons.
What so ever!  I prefer an android phone 😕
Hey Arron, awesome video i love your content. I was just wondering how do you make the animated backgrounds that play on the screens on your videos. Maybe you know a free program that i could use to make one? Keep the great work up!
Siding with MKBHD. Flat edges over curved edges.
" a draw from software" I'm amazed how this guy's doesn't want apple to lose, like android has a million of features and can be configured at your will you decide to choose a close system. "I i i i think its a draw"
I knew right off the bat based off these two reviewers that the iPhone would be the better phone according to them.
2 legends working together
"battery goes for iphone" literally you have a button that says (Battery safe) while iphone can last 15 hours the modern android like Samsung and Xiaomi can go ultra battery safe and last 2-3 days. Just say that you were paid by Iphone
"iPhone gets more fps" literally iphone can't even run most games at 90fps while gaming phones does at 120 and 90, search for Golden reviewer for it. iPhone is only good about playing Candy Crush
I think Android is feel like ,gives more freedom to user and iPhone feel like limited.
it's a few iphones vs very many androids  😅
This felt like the most bullshit let's give everything to iphone even if it didn't actually win. From a strength to strength for overall well I use blah blah blah more on an iPhone.
Imagine Android and Apple team up and make a phone!
No, no, no - you can't be both in the one video - that ruin's the order of the universe.
If you are going to compare the newest iphone against a specific feature of android, it is only fair to compare it to the best of the best for that feature.
honestly this is not a fair take...
My Huawei battery life is way better than Samsung, if I start the day on 50% I know its gonna last. Plus the faster charging too.
As someone who works in software development, I don't see why people think iphones are easier to use, knowing my brothers pin, i gave up on opening his phone after 5 minutes of trying to get the screen to pop up. Android is so much easier to use.
flaws of this video : apple clear biased 1-not mentioned always on display in all androids 2- customization you give draw but the whole world knows that this what makes android differnt 3-lightening cable no usb c 4- no cooling system on iphone and the screen dimming has no solution yet  5- screen mirroring is horrible in iphone unless you leave all leading screen companies and buy 4k dollars apple screen 6- imessage,air drop ,facetime are apple users only features but how apple and android users would text or video each others ?  7-Repairability  you can use 10 years old kid after watching 2 youtube videos to repair android phone tell me about repairing your iphone?
What about the repairabality of android phones compared to iphone? 9:47
Hi I think this should be personal opinion rather than Android 🆚 iPhone as very clearly MKBHD was very biased which is ok as an opinion not and Android vs iOS  thanks, keep the good work going And be FARE  1.5 to 7.5 that is crazy 🤪
If you want a popular phone with lots of support, choose iphone, if you have a specific feature in mind, go for whatever phone does that one feature best. I go for oneplus because in the us no phone charges faster.
Looked like a live.
I don't use split screen that often either but sometimes it can be really useful
Mkhbd is a blind Iphone lover like many other. Where at last he always say Iphone is better. Iphone still has that notch and lots of features cut out in this generation.
The regular iphone doesn't have a good battery compared to even a 200€ cheaper Android phone. And then there is the fast charging. I'm having both at the moment and I don't see the point of the iPhone.
There is no problem with owning a one year old phone, i have a 7 years old iphone and it does everything i need.
it was seriously unfair , Android platform is just better for some just like iOS is better for others I personally prefer android even though you migh have me changing it for a golden iphone, battery life is actually pretty close on Android flagships and sometimes better I have tested both but faster charging is a game changer I'll give this part to android with a slight edge , cameras clearly for photos Samsung takes it and for videos probably iphone , smoothness is in some cases better on pixels but regarding iOS heavy animations and graphics while keeping with the same performance I'll give it to iphone ......, I could recheck the video 1000 times and still be sure that scores would be closers in a fair situation
This was a terrible review honestly.... You take one strength and compare it to a weakness
2.5 : 7.5 common
you know who actually won? mrwhostheboss's  sponsors 😎 -linus
You left mkbhd hanging there with that handshake.
The second i saw genshin impact I told everyone in my discord server to watch this vid
Nokia dumb phones have the loudest vibrators, you can literally hear it from someone's pocket far from you.
When they said the screens are a draw between samsung and iphone in the beginning I knew this was going to be a joke comparison.
I constantly split screen on my Samsung.  Don't know how I lived without it
👍👍👍👍
Absolutely biased and a waste of time - many comments below bear this out.
You 2 are great tech reviewers , but this video felt like apple sponsered. Even if apple win ,it will be of slight margin, but in this video even though you don't mean it, people will think iphones are like 3x better than Android and there is no reason to buy Android. ( Also point for iphones for display, even with punch hole less brightness, made by Samsung , Are you kidding ? )
malayalis like here 😂
There is no such thing as Android (OS only) vs iPhone (Hardware/iOS). It's Samsung Galaxy (or another brand/subcategory) vs iPhone. Makes no sense to use Android as a baseline which is different from brand to brand vs iPhone with iOS which is always the same.
This bull💩
@callmeshazzam audience report here 😂
16:55, what's your iPhone case?
I would say that Samsung is better in more ways for me I think that this black guy take some money from iPhone company to boost their product it’s totally unfair for android phones
iPhone needs AOD, they've had Pleads since iPhone X but no AOD feature.
The worst brainless comparison i have ever seen. Compare iPhone with one plus 😉
Just get a Google Home speaker or hub and iPhone as a phone. 👍 I met a Google Softare Engineer who prefer iPhone way more.
I wish Android will be as fast/responsive and reliable as iOS or it's third party apps.
Gaming phones?
Does Jailbreaking still exist?
Privacy would have been a good category.
My Mum lost her notes on iPhone, but I would still put my money on iPhone for reliability especially with heat management.
They forgot to mention: This comparison was brought to you by iPhone
I can clearly see now that hes getting eventually biased to I phone I wonder why....sike its clear
7:29, wow that's annoying about Pixel. I think I had that issue a few times as well on other Androids.
iPhone gallery has way better sorting and way faster to process photos/videos. Samsung gallery isn't bad either, has geo tagging but doesn't sort selfies out etc and is slower to open.
🤣🤣🤣
Android users are so insecure. It’s so weird
120hz screen is the game changer for me. I first experienced this on an iPhone. I’ll never go back.
Quick charging shortens the bettery life.
Have used iPod Touch 2008, Huawei IDEOS 2010, iPhone 3GS 2012, S4 2013, iPhone 6s 2016 (felt like a huge upgrade from the S4 which later died in 2017), Huawei P10 2018, Huawei P39, 2019, S21 late 2021 - current and am currently considering going iPhone 13 Pro because my S21 and Huawei P39/P10 all lagged hard af on apps especially on IG, battery never felt as good as an iPhone but I love G board, copying/pasting and AOD better on Android. I don't multi window either (the S21 doesn't really say how to do it from the UI). It was a huge point on the S4. I miss replaceable batteries.
I will he honest Android lose so I dislike
How much did apple give you!? 😂
felt like an apple sponsored segment to me.
At the end no matter how great apple maybe android is just more interesting and fun and I’d pick interesting and fun any time of the day
MKHD is just an apple fan and this prove it right here because come on now. The Samsung screen is was better and why would Samsung give Apple a better screen than them smh
Something is on fire. Oooooops!!!! People crying to say Android is good's as$
When you think about it apple is going up against every android as a whole and still winning 🏆
Apple fan boys having a fair discussion about android and ios😄
HOW TF DID IPHONE WIN ON ECO-FRIENDLY, THEY ARE THE MOST ANTI-CONSUMER COMPANY OUT THERE. WANT TO REPLACE YOUR OWN SCREEN, YOUR IPHONE HAS BRICKED ITSELF. GET THIS BIASED CRAP OUT OF MY RECOMMENDED.
100% iPhone is better it’s hard to just say straight but I always switch and there’s huge issues with android that always let me down.
MKBHD IS clearly an Iphone fan...Mrwhoistheboss is really surprised with his choice as a fan but doesn't want to argue....Iphone 13 is below s22 ultra.. Fact
Do Samsung vs. Apple, Google Vs. Apple, Google Vs. Samsung etc.
I don't know why i am seeing this because all i can see both of u seem bias and pro Apple (ios) sorry for this 😑
have so much respect for both guys but this was one video i regretted watching.....biased!!
lol nah this was waaay rigged tbh  iphone user
To be honest eventhough I love this channel, I felt this is so biazed, the comparison felt unprofessional and one sided.
apart from performance and battery life everything is just a matter of personal preference,, i know i phone is better in performance & battery life but i prefer s22's photos over i phone, like big screen of s22 more than iphone's,,you can't decide who is better you can only say that i like iphone or Android,,
Downloading cracked applications is a very huge win for android😂
Google lens is another asset for Android
Ff
I sell my iphone 12 mainly because of file management system and customisation. With android you can drag and drop files , using ftp easily, can install 3rd party apps. But i still keep my ipad for my gaming device, i can max out genshin impact graphic setting without frame drops.
The video I’ve waited for. A full comparison and analysis of the situation right now. In the end, the iPhone is a clear winner. What matters the most to me is the fact that over the years you are better off with the iPhone because of its reliability and because of the performance reserves it offers.
One of the biggest problems with this comparison is that this totally ignores half of the world and presents a very North American perspective of things.
U should use an Xperia to represent android
I thought I was the only one that liked flat screens 😀
This would be better with JerryRegEverything, because he hates apple xd
This is WRONG  Mkhbhd uses iPhone and he is fully supports it
What is better? Samsung or iPhone? Comment your answer! I think iPhone is better!
I have one simple reason Android will always be better than iOS, and funnily enough that exact reason is Piracy and the fact that you CAN absolutely just go against all the BS ads, in-app purchases and you can just patch all the annoying things out of those ad games and enjoy them however you want. Further edit: Is it good for the developers? No. Definitely not, but remember that those same developers are just looking to snatch your wallet. On iOS all you can do is take it, if a dev feels like making their game or app unfair by introducing annoying paid things into it. On android you can say "F You!", you can both have your cake and eat it. YOU have a choice. And that's extremely important.
Who will win a arm wrestling battle between MKBHD and Mrwhoosetheboss??🤔🤔
At the end of the day it’s just another consumer device designed to waste money.
This is totally false
But with Apple you are locked to their ecosystem deduct 5 pts
Always been an android user, that being said, even though this (very biased) video says iPhone is better, I wouldn't accept one even if it was given to me for free. I use an S22 Ultra and my family members have iPhone. My phone has more features that the trash they have.
Not sure if you gonna see this but can u try  vid on tesla phone?
In gaming android is better because some GE's like Fortnite don't allow the device at its full potential
highly biased video
I’d had also put a section “innovation”.
i feel like there is a bit of bias since both are iPhone users, there is also a lot of subjectivity and there isnt anyone properly representing Android with a neutral judge, great vid though
I always like the Arun always puts his best efforts in his videos.....
Marques it seems has now become a Apple apologist :/
As a person who owns phone of both category, I strongly feel Android is a better choice and even apple is nit picking some features from it.  Surely apple is guiding force but for 90% of people who would invest in IPhone just because of this video and will take loans for it, believe me, get an Android from a reputed brand and you are good to go for many years. I still use my Poco F1 with customized ROM and it works fabolously, no glitches and I play the latest games (on occassion)
I think this video shows that iPhone works if you're just wanting a phone and not really wanting to go deep into it. Android practically offers everything you want with both pros and cons. For me, being unto customization, clean smooth UI, being able to mess around with APKs and stuff, Android is an obvious winner.  But great video as always! Loved the style and the more laid back casual vibe. What about a video on iOS vs Android?
Lmao the Marques dude is so a iPhone shill, no wonders he lives in Cali and is close to their HQ. Ridiculous.
...and yet they both use Android?
SPONSORED BY APPLE.
I think everyone in the world should come together and force iPhone to put back the charger and the earphones,,,we are getting scammed!!!!
So... Like the colour are based on iMessage... Wonder if there's any bias?
Paid lol
Unfortunately, i dont think its a valid comparison anymore because apple has gotten so saturated and ahead of the pack.  And you missed one huge snd major thing in reliabilty, longevity, where theres simply no match for apple
Mr whosetheboss: "So today we're going to talk ab-" MKBHD : "APPLE WINS! Where do I pick up my cheque?"
I thought this was very biased for MKBHD, I think he is too pro Apple and doesn't really explain why. I mean how can you give photography and videography to Apple when the Pixel is far better. Oh because you can integrate better with social media it makes it better. Sorry don't agree.
Iphone flagship to android flagship  Iphone always wins  And I do love the video
for some reason mkbhd makes a lot of sense
Although iOS wins more categories it can't explain worldwide ca 70% Android phones. Even if you factor in price difference it still means Android phones appeal to more people worldwide. And I think the answer is choice. iOS is a black T Ford while Android is everything from a Trabant to a Maserati.
Did he know you can turn up the vibrating level in newer samsung phones 💀💀💀💀
Iphone is a great all rounder, you can compare it a bunch on android phones and still shine.
I like both Brand and both YouTubers and im sorry to say: Despite my opinion, this Video has no worth for the debate cause the points are given randomly and even without the things the both of you said.
I've been using custom rom on my crappy android for almost two years. It is because the support from the manufacturer already ended
Me who love the iphone 5 because of that flat sides
Only thing about Android to Apple is that you can't use Android on APPLE vice a versa and you can't use none Apple Bluetooth products much on Apple items, Still Apple is more of a money making scam company as Android isn't far behind like Samsung too.
Innovation at Android is always winning side no matter what anyone says. iPhone is good in performance bt let me enlight you. Apple do not need to take care much device compatibility. They have fewer model to operate so they will naturally progress well because of limited configuration. In opposite side Android has huge devices to manage and their compatibility. They need to provide much common hardware/software stuff to fit in those all kind phones out there. So Ofcourse they have to be limited. If they stop with it and just focus on Google pixel or Samsung devices just like Apple do, believe me Android is going to be far better than current condition.
Yoo, Mrwhosetheboss, You donated 5000 to ryan trahans donation thingy lol, Thats awesome man, Keep doing good.
What the f**k was this!? A platform which has been providing freedom of customization,  briniging so much innovation to phone industry and many many more pros, and they were counting what 'Apple will' be doing in future!!??? Such a load of crap is what this video is, I love Curved Edges! I love photos of samsung! I love how I can full make my phone my own!
This is an iPhone ad.
Samsung is a user friendly than iphone, multitasker than iphone, iphone looks classy so sexy by appearance, samsung not so sexy but brainy..
Let's just say it bluntly this was the most biased comparison on your channel, I mean whole world knows that MKBHD is Apple fanboy, he is also many time sponsored by Apple, he can't be a nutral if there's Apple product involved. 20 min wasted man but thankgod its a Sunday.
There's a bit too much nuance in the android space for this kind of comparison imo. I think this would've been better as the top iPhone Vs the top Samsung Vs the top of some other Android manufacturer
After sufficient performance incl. camera (hygene factor) the most important factor for me is: I don't like to be told, what I can do or how I have to use my stuff. This is the absolute killer for iPhones. I feel like Apple thinks they know better than me, what I want to do and doctrinate it to me. After removing all the bloat if possible and installing all the Apps I want to use (yeah if Google thinks they don't want that App in the Appstore, I can sideload) and setting up my Nova, I am rarely confronted with things I can't change to my liking on Android.
When it comes to Samsung, only the S and Note series phones are considerable. For any other model, there are much better value phones available. Same goes for the iPhones. Its either over iPhone 12 or higher. Rest doesn't make any sense. Change my mind.
Fkk this shht
Better? Definitely Android (high-end, of course). Which one do you prefer and why? That's the real question.  Some try to look awesome, wealthy, accepted and supposedly iOS provides that.  Some of us just want something that really works and we use Android.
I thinks that was wrong .. apple 13 pro and s22 ultra  i am  was resently used  this two phone  i think all of Samsung s22 ultra much better then  apple (newest version) to  research all think  ANDROID in better ✨
I will tell you my experience, i have been an android user for about 8-9 years (last phone being S8), a couple of months ago i switched to IOS, i bought iphone 13 and an apple watch series 7, they are very good but i wish i spent my money on android since i know the software and the apps. I feel like i need time to get into the apple ecosystem but a part me wishs to go back to android. So really if android works for you dont go IOS its not worth it anymore.
also funny that you both rated iPhones so high but both are using a Samsung as a daily driver, if I understood this right?
This was my least fave of both your vids. It just didn't make sense. I think you were tired. But now I question your judgement (I use both iOS and Android).
I love SharePlay, especially because I work away a lot and spend most my time with my wife on FaceTime.
I LIKE MKBHD CHANNEL AND CONTENT,  BUT I HIGHLY DISAGREE WITH HIS CHOICES HERE. THIS IS HIS EXPERIENCE AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT.  YOU SHOULD DO ONE WITH FLOSSY CARTER, NO FANBOY STUFF IN HIS REVIEWS.
Everyone  will  have  a  varied  view based on probably  what we use our phones for or what we know our phones can do ... Let me explain  . I  use a Samsung galaxy A52 and  it serves me very well .. I  am a teacher  in Ghana 🇬🇭  and I  am pretty happy with what Samsung  Routines  does for me. I  have configured it  to turn on and connect  to WiFi immediately  I get to school  . It should  put my  phone on silence at the time  I start to teach and  unmute it and disconnect  wifi immediately  I leave  the school  .  When I get home , I can easily  play music  from the Samsung  music  app straight  through  my Pioneer  AVR. With Samsung Flow, I easily  share pictures,  videos,  text, and even  executable  files to  my Dell precision  laptop  and to my wife's  phone  ....  I  know the A52 is not a top notch android phone  but  it does everything  that makes life easier  for me .....  On the go , I easily  pair with my JBL earbuds  and am cool ....  Honestly,  I  seamlessly  connect  with every wirelessly enabled  device  that I  have.. And that is life ...  If Apple is having a n ecosystem then  Samsung is having  an ECOLOGY....
talk all u want android is better
Let's be honest here for a sec, almost 80% of all Android users are either Asian or have deep grudge against Apple.
I recently moved from ios to android 12/color os12 and its night and day for me. Phone specs aside, android with color OS is so much more customisable and has many more options i never saw on ios. I dont think ill ever go back to ios. Hardware wise, its nice to have the option of cheaper phones; I got an oppo reno 5A that only cost $200 and has better specs than the iphone X, for a fraction of what the X cost when it came out. Also, different phones like the galaxy flip and fold. iphone only has larger screens and nothing else.
7:12 - i cannot believe in 2022 you can take a picture on android, go home to view it and its just not there. where did it go? software is so bad. android will always be terrible. 2.5 is a generious score. android users in the comments, keep crying.
i just bought iphone 13pro and i never going back to android…its just the best machine .wery hapy with my new 13pro!!!!
Sir please give me mobile phone for study
IPhone 13 Not Better Camera Samsung Galaxy S22 Its Better Camera
Content of the video was ok, scoring system = biased towards apple. If something is preference but apple makes it easier it shouldn't actually mean apple does it better.
i ve been using android my whole life and dont get me wrong, i love android, but as more time passes i see iphone much more better, i just love how iphone is smooth and how good pictures are.
Apple screens are made by Samsung so wouldn't android get the total screen points.
Should've renamed the video:   "Apple vs Android - Which one are we more Biased towards? (ft MKBHD)"
With all do respect this is definitely feeling rigged in clear multiple points that android specifically Samsung definitely deserves the point.
You did not have Privacy as a category?
@mrwhosetheboss very interesting topic. But I felt that @mkbhd kinda forced a few points to iPhone. He’s an apple fan and that’s fine but it felt like where apple is better they get a point and where android wins then it’s either a draw or sometimes u give a point. iPhone is fluid and stays smooth even under heavy stress and heating up. But display, zoom, features, customization, file compatibility and certain things like s pen and Dex the android wins by a mile. Also coming to camera you have to remember we aren’t social media influencers where we randomly take scenery pics. Some of us don’t want to carry a dslr and optical zoom matters a lot. Went whale watching and the 3x zoom on the iph 13 was crappy. Missed my s21 ultra. When navigating I prefer google maps over Apple Maps but if I minimize for changing music or to reply to text there no pic in pic for google maps. There’s no clipboard in iPhone. Such a basic feature. Multitasking I prefer using a calculator with doc open. Fast charging is also imp as I usually charge phone when in shower so 20mins is all I get. Finally smaller things which reviewers don’t try as they aren’t actual users is things like biz y routines where everything is automated. My Samsung when connected to home wifi after 12am goes to battery saver if it’s not connected to charger. Small touches that matter. Also since I was using the iph 13 I didn’t realise. The photos are really bland. In the Samsung I don’t have to edit. They look really nice to directly upload to Insta. iPhone colours are too muted. I was given the iPhone in Oct it’s been 7 months and there are still times when I miss the things android offered. Again. I don’t care which is better but when u create a video with such an interesting topic u should strive to keep it fair and reliable. This was more like a what does Mkbhd think. One of the reasons I stopped watching his videos was cuz I didn’t find his views reliable. Even his titles are obvious when it’s an apple or non apple video. Maybe next time do it without collaborating.
No matter what. I'll still use my Z Fold3
Your clothes colors
You can use me as the dislike button, Since we can't see the number of dislikes
Mkphd only talks about iphone it does not consider of any mobiles shet
I love you both guys mrwhosetheboss and mkbhd. Best reliable smartphone reviewers. Excellent videos always❤️all the best guys
I wish I could see the dislikes 😭
Well, I didn't like it, unfortunately. The categories were chosen in such a way that it just didn't work. For example: What is being compared? Model? Company? Software? and then always in such a way that weaknesses didn't matter... all in all rather weak and not only nonsense, but a whole new level of nonsense.
Anyone counted the number of times Mr.HTB wipes his phones clean with?
Meh two Apple influencers picking Apple. Not a shocker here.
Could not disagree more with this video.
19K dislikes 😂 a video this horrible deserves more. Next time don't involve imarques in anything involving Apple
Recently switched to IOS 13 pro max from a Galaxy S10+ and, and I doubt I'll go back to android because rounded screens are terrible, and ios is just better for doing things without thinking about it.
I thought you was taking a vacation because you needed to rest your mental state and not get worn out from overworking yourself.... Or was you just crying crocodile tears and putting on a pity show? Very disappointed in you but I'll let you do you
Air drop and nearby share is the same thing. But nobody use it!!
MKBHD being an apple fan boy.
Interesting but pixel camera blows iphone away in my opinion.  Especially for the price.  And dual sim.  And those three are most important.
THANK YOU! Fiinally I am glad phone won which is truly true
Love your Both Video Best 2 handsome Boy😍
ANDROID is BEST         RIP  iPhone
Android is the winner 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
I will disagree with the video. Android has everything for the different likes of the people. It is a biased selection in the video.
Trip to US sponsored by Apple😄
This video gets an F. The scoring made no sense at all and I have used both iPhone and Android.
One giant ad for iPhone 🤡 But hey they do discuss the categories I guess... Apple does have great OS and utilise the chipset and ram brilliantly but that's also because the customisation options are very limited compared to an "open source" droid platform etc...
Android fanboys are fuming in the comments 😂😂 love to see that
This was the most biased comparison I've ever seen.
Apple ✌️
Ill take anyone of those phones please.
I believe price is another huge win for Android since it helps people in poor countries to connect with the rest of the world.   If apple were the only phone company on earth, 70% of the people wouldn't have a phone yet.
The excuses they keep coming with in order to make imaginary draws in order not to give the Android the recognition it deserves are hilarious.
HAPTICS HAPTICS HAPTICS
Yep! apple sponserd these peoples
iPhone has really annoying lens flare
INTERESTING SMART ENJOYABLE VIDEO :)  THANK YOU FROM ISRAEL :)
This video is really biased and structured horribly when point's are given is really unclear and confusing. This video is a perfect example of a good idea performed terribly.
Gestures on Android make your life easier, camera is really poor in iPhone especially with lower light, but the battery life is definitively a big plus for iPhone not only because it last longer but you use iPhone less when your fingers get sore from the weight and sharp corners of the pro max
I have a iPhone 13 pro max and I hate this phone
Good one....kinda feel bias towards android tho  Phone world is samsung iPhone and the rest
Sir I want Iphone 13 Pro Max for my studies. Because I have only laptop i use it for 2 years but it was repaired and my parents doesn't have money to buy a new laptop or phone. Please sir gift me iPhone 13 Pro Max or MacBook pro for my studies. Please sir i trust you. Please gift me
The battery being better is Bs unless they changed something in the last couple of years. When I had iPhone 2G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4S they all died before reaching 0%. And all my friends that kept using iPhone 5,6,7,8 the phones could die  suddenly at 40-50% charge and would require charging to even boot up again, and that only made me more happy that I joined the Android side.  Now I've tried Sony,Samsung, Huawei, and now Samsung Galaxy S21+ 5G and I'm definitely going back to Sony next year even though there's nothing wrong with my Samsung except the camera sucks compared to Sony or Huawei. Would choose Huawei again only if Trump wasn't all paranoid.
If the 120hz screen in the iPhone is the smoothest in class, boy the competition must really be bad. The choppiness in menus and some apps is just atrocious.
Keep up the amazing content love your videos
Well this was very biased
Seems like apple did pay for your meet-up 😂😂😂
20:08 Did anyone else notice a missed fistbump?
Mkbhd is bias
No matter how much you drool over iPhone some of us will never buy one. Apple represents  a world of woke imo. No thanks! 😆
It's simple really if u care about reliability overall eco system experience for an easier life as content creator iphone however if you are one of the specialists who needs really specific features that are not available on the iPhone or just simply you're really hardcore with trying features out android both are great options if i had to pick one i would pick an iPhone it meets my requirements even tho i would like to have fun camera app or any other fun software to tweak and play with but for now i wanna have both! I can't decide I'm in both of this sides i want reliability i want the ecosystem that just works however I'm also an anthosiest with other features....
I've been a long time subscriber to both your channels and like and respect your opinions in most things tec, but I must admit that in this upload you sound like a couple of Apple fan boys (specially Arun)!!!.
A video that is generously sponsored by Tim Cook!
IPhone wins, but they both use Samsung :)
One of the most boring video by my favorite YouTubers 🤥🤥🤥
I should have been felt asleep but this discussion was so interesting to listen.
this video was literally all about dissing android and nothing else i use both ios as well as an android and let me tell you androids are beasts and i would pretty much rely on android camera rather than my iphone camera because believe me iphone pics at night are very grainy while my android almost makes it look as if its day
To be honest i use both i phone and android...but i love android more than i phone..i only carry my i phone for calling,photography and for showing off
they tried to make it look not bias
Eww what a shitty video 🤮 Is this sponsored by aPpLe?
Guys, i think they missed the part were they would say " this video is sponsered by apple " and also they forgot to add ' sponsered by apple ' on the title.
I love how every time that iPhone is considered better than android the android fanbase call everything biased, make really unfunny jokes and then proceed to be pseudo-intellectuals.
Well, tough to make a more biased video in favor of Apple. Many serious Apple issues not even mentioned. What a terrible loss of credibility for both
Mkbhd wearing his apple watch, they are meant to be impartial but it's really iPhone users who review androids.
I bought a iPhone cause my old s10+ was constantly having issues and running social media worse than a iPad that was 5 years older. It took some time getting used to but I enjoy it and my car only supports apple carplay so yeah.
alot of people came to see Apple/samsung win, but in my opinion it's all about what you want, you might hate something about the iphone but many people like that thing and same with androids. It's all about what the user wants from a phone.
for taking photos I think it shld be the Android Pixel 6 series
One thing Apple has going for it when it comes to iPhones and software stability (in OS, not specifically in apps), is that Apple writes the software FOR the iPhone. Android is written a general OS and handed-out to the phone manufactures to tweak. Android is the base OS that is modified to each specific phone, not written FOR that phone.  That said, iPhone's software SHOULD be really top tier in terms of stability. The fact that this is a question here and isn't right away answered in iPhone's benefit leaves me to believe Apple is not solving the problems that exist before trying to innovate to get more of your money.  Android isn't perfect either. In fact, Google's flagships don't even run stock Android, and Google writes it. I would expect the version of Android on Pixels to be the stock version of Android; if they did I would expect them to be top tier also. But similar to Apple, Android phones are being innovated to capture a specific target audience (which is much wider range of people) than iPhones, so within the Android community you have certain groups, such as Samsung users who hate Pixels, Pixel users who hate Samsung phones, and LG users who hate themselves, and many more. It really is comparing Apples to Oranges, Peaches, Avocados, and Bananas. Each have their perks, and some are better during some seasons than others, some last longer than the others, and some are just good all around no matter what.
Thank u so much for this comparison
I used androind for many years and never ever have i taken a photo without it being saved.. couldn't finish this video.. this is beyond unprofessional
If MKBHD was not in this video the results would have been different😂 this video is like totally rigged🙏😂😂
Dont they both use iphones ?  Even if not the battery points and camera  were given to iphone although the reasoning was stupid
iphones don't do much so what they do they have to do it great 🤣. I owned one and loved it but the software.... There's literally no features. All you can do is what's in the app store and that's lame imo . I can literally use my s22 ultra like a computer . If I need an actual computer, I can use the Dex feature which I use a lot. Features man. That's why I'm team droid.
This video should be called:  Iphone vs Android? ( Why MKBHD thinks that iphone is Better?)
About camera android z a win especially samsung is very clear than iPhone... This are my opinions
Johnny Carson called..He wants his set back......I'm Kidding.  Hey, this was a cool collaboration video. You guys should do more stuff like this. You share so much common ground it is real comfortable watching you guys together.
It has been a long time since I've seen such a biased video. Why don't you compare the middle tier phones against each other that would be interesting. This is such BS.
you are a English man - Marques is an American thats why he praise Apple ;-) but I personaly use android (one plus 8T) because its cheaper it charches really fast like 30 min USB C it commutate better to my TV,  stand alone speakes and my earbuds THAN my girlfriend iphone 8plus :-)
"Sponsored by Apple"
Android is an Operating system..not a phone...They don't make or manufacture most of their oarts...You're litteraly paying more because the overhead is more
The iPhone litteraly uses Samsung parts...The only thing on an iPhone that Apple actually makes is the M1 chips...Samsung memory, mobo , screen and battery(certain demographics use Samsung but others use different for manufacturing purposes) Sony makes their lenses....Components on a Samsung are 100% better
Did you merge customisation with digital assistants just to ensure iOS gets a point? This comparison is not objective.
Both iphone and andriod are great but i prefer the andriod cause of multi tasking and customize While on iphone i will pick the camera Is dam 👍
Samsung Display is much better at least it is still usable in dark room,.  I have both phones but iphone make me tears every time because it's display make me feel uncomforable while using it in dark room:(   It should not be a draw at least
I don't know if that's just me but with android i feel like i am more in control over the phone And there are apps that use android exclusive feature and the ability to mod If i was an avarage user IPhone definitely wins but android is more customisable and yeah the choice and value of some android for me still makes android's win if you need something specific that IOS doesn't have or can't do
Shazzam uyire from kerala
I usually enjoy these videos but I felt like this was a bit too onesided when in fact some of these didn't really get all points of views. The fact that there wasn't enough debate on some topics and only one of your opinions really mattered is too much wasted potential for an interesting video. Not trying to be rude or mean but I think you should've argued more for your opinions more Arun, as well as bringing more of your view into it.
Im too addicted to 65w fast charging im afraid
IPHONEEEE!!!!!
I’ve owned many Android phones in the past (even HTC! Remember them?!) but now I’m an iPhone user and have other Apple tech. I’d say the flagship Android phones have marginally better tech than the iPhones. But where the iPhone succeeds is in CONVENIENCE. The Apple ecosystem is brilliant plus the ability to go in to a physical store is a big plus for many people. This is why Apple is the biggest.
I would pick s21 ultra just for the screen edges omg apple screen feels outdated
Two of the most hardworking mainstream techtubers ik ❤️
*1:49** notice the ‘dent’ in the dent*   😂
Title should be iPhone 13 pro vs S22 ultra
unbearably one-sided.
I LOVE THE NOTCH
A biased compaeison in favour of the iphone
After watching whole video I came to a very good resolution that when it's compared to a better value then I think still Android seems to be the best but the major conditions is that if you don't concerned so much about latest updates and features. Because with updates it is becoming more prone to bugs and motherboard and other hardware failures like Samsung Galaxy S20+ is having and The Poco X3 pro users faced.
This is more biased
I can charge my Samsung S21 Ultra and iPad Pro with my Macbook Pro charger. I can slow charge my Mackbook Pro with my Samsung charger. Less clutter and less cables are important to me. When Apple switches to USB-C than I'll think about switching.
Bro how much did Apple payed you guys this is an advertising for Apple 100%
Shouldn't have watched this video, I had convinced myself that Samsung was better but now..., need to get a new job or something lol
*Android is iPhone Beta* *Less stable, but offers much more*
its not android vs iphone that is samsung vs iphone x_x
I've been an apple head for nearly a decade straight, mind you I had the HTC Evo when it first came out and had the S4 as a secondary at one point as well. This year I got the s22 ultra and I feel no ways about the switch. Imo apple is a phone you can go with straight out the box that you wish you could customize. With the new update you can do much more than before. The Samsung is a phone you will likely feel more inclined to install added apps into in order to get it to your liking which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Personally I love the freedom the Samsung's gives it's users, it's not a perfect phone but it feels more like yours imo. I love the iphone still, I might get the 13 mini as a secondary just because I enjoy the features especially the camera. Imo Samsung has absolutely no excuse for their trash camera. For $1200 I shouldn't have to install a separate camera app or be in perfect lighting for an acceptable shot. I will say the video on the ultra is good, I've got no complaints with that. Sound quality wise once again Samsung there's no excuse for this trash. Overall I can't accept that the iphone 13 washes the s22 by 5 points, it makes no sense. I've had no hiccups on the 22 ultra yet, and have been doing everything I've done on my iPhone without a hitch and in some cases better or equal. The intelligence of these phones are some of the best. And I find the Samsung is intuitive and smarter in some cases like typing or voice to text. Will the iphone require less configuration upon receiving, yes, however the options to personalize Samsung gives exceeds. But y'all trying to play Samsung like it's some slow can't do nothing phone. This is coming from somebody who still enjoys apple products from my Mac to my iPad and I have to disagree.
MKBHD is always biased
Video from iPhone fan Boys 👦 🤣🤣
It was already known.😂
DISCLAIMER: potentially triggering to a certain group of people. Watch at your own risk
A little bit too SUBJEKTIVE comparison from the best tech youtubers of the World...   I have used both OS for a long time now and i see it like that:  Display 📱 a draw, apple with smoother display, android with more brightness and  better colours   Performance 💻 a draw, yes of course apple has the better hardware but the FEELING of smoothness is in Android 12 much better  Camera 📷 a draw, apple more reliable, android more flexible and fun  Video 📹 clear winner apple  Battery🔋also clear winner apple  Software 💡 overall BIG point to android! Much more features, more customization, better notification system, better control system, better navigation in the whole UI, more beautiful animations...   Price 💰 apple very stable in the last year's, but overall point goes to android for the big range of prices and value   All in all the choice of preferences...  I am excited for the next 🤖🍎comparison from you guys!
This is the first video I see him asking to subscribe at the end 😅
Biased AF
My man is an huge iphone fanboy, i switched from apple to galaxy s22 ultra. And its so much betther ,at the start a iphone display is not even close to a samsung display. I didnt take the video seriously at the start.
The day iOS gets the fast charging , split screen and third party app support.  I'm gonna buy it.   I think the last one is never gonna happen do I'm never gonna buy it i guess..
So Biased.
What a biased review
Apple marketing....how much they getting payed for this????.....No wonder they banned hauwei......
It's all about the ecosystem, I'm on the android side, cause I prefer the android experience, obviously I'm talking about Samsung flagships the only ones that are on par with iphones...
In simple if you want a nice value for money gaming phone it's Android and if you want a phone just for the best multimedia experience it's ios 🤔
POV: you bought iPhone because android emojies are bad 💀
Interesting video. I’ve been Android user for few years. Trying to get use to iPhone. Two simple things that iPhone lacks drive me crazy at times a)The lack of permanent Back button b)The lack of Alpha numeric key board  Really want to buy iPhone 13 because of the picture quality but    think I will end up buying an Android just because iPhone lacks those two features.
"Cortana is available" 💀
Didn't show the iphone weaknesses, i called it  one sided
So the screen on the Samsung is better and have no gigantic notch, so both get half a point, really? Sorry, but this test was probably the biggest bullshit i've seen on your channel. The Fairphone is the most repairability, does use FAIR RESSOURCES, and IPHONE WINS, WTF? Sorry, but especially this bullshit made me unsubscribe.
i used to prefer android, but then i tried to use the iphone 7+. fast forward several years and i bought a sony xperia 5, intending to replace the 7+. but at the end of the day, i ended up still using the 7+ as my main phone. in the overall / general cases, the iphone simply do things better than android. i really want android to be great though, because if iphone (apple) ever gets too dominant, it won't be good for us customers
M K B H D IS BIAS😤😤😤😠😠😠😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬!!!!!!!!!!!!!
iPhone for me. But on iPhone I can’t download videos directly to the memory, which is useful when I’m out of internet or the video from the server is deleted then I can transfer it to computer. That’s something I can do with my Samsung Phone.  But iPhone’s battery life is the best, camera is great. iPhone also is easy to operate with Apple watch. Airpods Pro is so great to me.
Hi can you react to mous please its a phone cover company
how is this a question?
New Apple ad is so long🥱
This seem like a add for iPhone but to each thier own ,this just strengthens my opinion on why I don’t trust tech reviewers
This show brought you by : Apple inc
Not true
Honestly this can’t really be put down to actual attributes like specs or software features. However when it comes down to pure convenience and day to day ease of use , iPhone hands down takes the win.
Very poor poor comparison to the extent that i actually believe that it's an apple advertisement
MKBHD is clearly and Iphone Fan...
Apple premium is premium, but the simpler models are just overpriced as hell.  Which is a minus because most people can't afford the Premium line. Even if they do want a flagship.  You should compare the premium Vs premium and basic flagship Vs basic flagship
When two paid content creators discuss about shit which they're paid for, from their respective ends. Marques who rates Apple uses Samsung S21. This shows an utter bias or foolishness in this crappy video.
I honestly feel bad for Android users. I wouldn’t wish one in my worst enemy.
MKBHD  always make apple shine even though they are not bringing something new.
I actually make use out of the Multitasking features like split window (in very clutch situations), and pop-up window (very often, especially for the calculator app or even browser sometimes) am I really in some extreme minority on Android? Those features are incredible. I personally am under the impression that you two, even though you're hardcore tech users. Maybe it's because you're just older and it's just old fashioned to focus on single tasks, especially because you use both OS's and iOS doesn't have the feature. It just doesn't feel natural to you
Yeah, iPhone has best battery... as long as you don't look at the android phones with 10,000mah plus batteries.
Androids have a air drop type system its called quick share
Android is better
No matter how many time wasting debates come about this topic, Android will always be a more versatile choice in all categories at a much lower price. Value to price ratio will always be high in Android phones. Also there are lots of innovations coming up on Android phones like foldable phones etc. While, iPhone is just switching camera lens positions.
lighting really sucked
i lost my respect for you two I'm so shocked 😱 like how much did apple pay you for this video?
Mr Beast: So which phone is bette-  *Other dude: iPhone*
Instead of comparing the best device from iOS vs. Android, why not compare the average device across each OS? The problem with Android is that it's work to find the best device for you, but on iOS, there's no wrong choice.
Display - Android Performance - IPhone Battery - iPhone Photos - Android Video - Iphone Eco consciousness - subjective Software reliability - subjective Software features - Android Software support - iPhone Pricing - Android
Mrwhosetheboss do u watch Ryan Trahan?
Can we see the dislike for this video 🙏🙏🙏
This video is not sponsored by Apple
It pisses me off how marques is too oriented towards the iPhone unfairly
zero lens be like 😱😱 oh no
Can't trust the guy on the left side... he way to biased for me... at this point I can't take this vid seriously or recommend... cuz dude on that fanboy hype right now and that's not good and he does this more in all the other videos he's in and he don't seem to be a honest person about tech...
I can play mobile legend while watching YouTube on android, but IOS cannnot
MKBHD Thinks ,"ok,it's a worthy QnA.Because it's been hosted by MRWHOSETHEBOSS.Let's Talk real"
Is more on Android than  iphone.
Thank you and one thing haven't mentioned       Sponsored by apple
Manipulating the viewers!!!!  They actually assess the android better, and then “ give it a tie”, or “iPhone is better “😡😤
Honestly, this video just feels wrong and biased No hate, I like watching your videos
This smells like an Apple sponsored video to me. 🧐🧐🧐
The customisation will always be better on android, It's Unix. Unix will and forever will be the most customisable OS as it is open source
only android phone i have been considering for years now is the pixel. i also want a premium 'smaller' phone. i'm not talking about 4a or even 5, but 4a 5G is the sweet spot for me. pixel is dropping in that category. sure, the 6a will be around that size, but is lacking high refresh rate, camera's reduced and old, no extra features,...so i've been testing a 13 pro (done latest iPhone testing for a couple of years now) and this one is getting me really close to switching since a 4S, but photos is definetly do not go to the iPhone! i do Prefer face unlock/id over inscreen fingerprint. home screen customization instead of lockscreen would have been better in ios16. 🤷
I really don't know why i am feeling this but the discussion was one sided. I thought it would be like, one person giving facts and the other opposing the facts and then coming on a conclusion. I wouldn't even mind it there was a part 2 of the video.
Far too heavily biased on MKBHD. He clearly favours the iPhone, and when android should clearly win, he gives a draw. As arun's videos are always more honest, I feel like MKBHD ruined this video completely
This is such a great video! So up until the halfway mark iPhones basically get a lot of point for being mediocre but reliable/predictable.
MKBHD: breaths Arun: interesting 🤔
IPhone kinda got a little camera and quality but samsung is the most popular product of the quality and the most bad ones are the camera but my samsung a32 5g is very good 👍 PS I LOVE YOU ❤️
Dear MrWhoseTheBoss, I know that you are very busy but I would like for you to help address an issue that's plaguing the Samsung Community. Samsung's S20 Plus phones are experiencing Screen Defects and Samsung's Customer Support and Repair Support are claiming that these incidents are "isolated cases" and that "the customer is at fault". There are literally thousands and even more S20 Plus users who have been asking Samsung to fix this issue, but Samsung has only ignored them and force them to pay for the screen and repair themselves. Thank you for reading this and I Hope something can be done!
I have always said that it comes down to you, what do you want? I like Android better but in honesty I've never had an Apple. My wife likes Apple because as far as smart phones go that's all she has used. Both in reality are probably going to suit most people equally.
The battery life comparison was interesting. All the people I know complain about iphone battery life. They say its basically a wired/ landline phone. But maybe that's a problem with older models.
seems like MKBHD is paid by apple for this video lol android is much better man we all know
I think this was an inaccurate comparison  just because android has such diverse option. The screen comparison is a perfect example. Compared to a high end Samsung screen iPhone screens are inferior. But compared to most other ones they would be superior. So they needed to make some things constant. Either the same/similar price range. Or flagship vs iphones. Otherwise there is no proper comparison. Every comparison here was based on super vague standards.
If I have to go for professional work than I'll go for iphone but for long gamming, emulation, third party apps, modes apps and battery life, I'll chose a flagship Android.   But the thing matters the most is"CAN U AFFORD ONE OF THEM".
So despite choosing iPhone as a winner, you guys prefer using an Android phone. Why?
Wanna see these kinds of collab again!♥️
This was hilariously biased... Android clearly deserve way more points...
Swapped to Samsung a few years ago ...and I've never wanted to go back to iPhone ... have an S22Ultra now ... I've had none of the problems MB says he's had ... battery is great,  charges VERY quickly , vibration feels no different, camera is amazing, never had an app fail yet easy to move files around unlike Apple which is a PAIN IN THE ASS ... it seems MBs preferences are very subjective ...  perhaps i don't work mine as hard as MB ... but Apple always seem to be chasing Samsung ... the ONLY product I've found better by Apple is their watch, it is better than the Samsung watch
This is more like MKBHD opinion than Arun 😄
The worst comparison ever. So many things avantages Android has but they didn't bring up. If you're going to compare products, use your real experience and research then make it fair. This guy is just an ass kisser.
This MKBHD seems like an iPhone fan. So annoying.
And suddenly it's so simple: 2,5 : 7,5 :)
So I've been a long time watcher and like many others, this didn't seems like a proper comparision. Key points to note  the question was always what does iPhone have that Android doesn't but not much the other way around. The words that praised iPhone were highlighted using graphics but not for Android even for the cases it won Many times when both had valid points the iPhone still got the point  Look i value Arun's honesty and i know he's unbiased but this video felt off, I was expecting iphone to win bcus it is in general an overall good phone but this basically showed that Android has nothing going for it No mention of repairability , app backward compatibility or hardware innovations (like folding screens or thermals) Hope Arun sees this i really want to know, was this set up to be appealing to iPhone users on purpose?
Feature phones is above all these as it has no comparable features
Interesting concept and great to watch, but the comparison is a bit unfair; comparing an OS to a specific phone brand doesn't exactly work, it should be wither Android vs iOS, comparing purely software-based performance, or a specific phone brand (probably Samsung) vs iPhone, then comparing all of the features explored in this video.
MKBHD is an Apple fan boi so he's a little biased
Y’all are typing paragraphs in a comment section 💀
Samsung have been kicking Apples ass for years
Two of my favourite  mobile tech reviewers in one vlog.
Arun is a more likable guy
MKBHD has smoked up some good weed I see
Best spec doesn’t always mean better. It’s all about how it performs when you use it.  iPhone got not the most advanced screen but it is optimized as hell it runs smoother. Or the battery. It’s so optimized it has longer battery life.  Average user will not care if the screen is the best in the market. Most of us average customer wants to have well made phone.
But apple is getting unwarranted marks here 😂😂😂 mkbhd clearly just loves the brand. Usbc should be a clear win for android battery/charging. Software capabilities android for features and developers
This vdeo made me loose my appatite, it is unfair to compare like, yes i like iphone but you should only have taken one company vs another ezample samsung vs iphone, and honestly when you speak a display we know by far samsung is the king in soo many aspect, now i wonder where did that draw come frm😟 And also look at how many option you hve to get apps in android then to compare it to iphone, and soo on and soo on you name it.........
Why would you guys pick iPhone over Android for battery and charging? A universal port, fast charging starting with the cheapest of phones, massive backup on the smallest of phones (except S22 vanilla), and much much more that works in Android's favour. Apple improves battery with ONE generation and they are better? iOS 16 update is also coming, let's not forget.
Xiaomi would blow Apple out of the water in terms of pricing
Opinions , everyone has their opinion
So basically the things the android was good at were not even part of the comparison. Ouch.
Good collaboration! I would also say that Android has many hardware options and form factors. No flip phone for iPhone. I did like that Samsung had expandable memory previously.
I would say it’s equal between the two of them
advertisement for iPhone & Samsung . it's becoming quite obvious the big smartphone reviewers are on the pay  that's why I stopped watching  everyone is pushing iPhone and  Samsung otherwise they won't get to review (smartphones) First . so obvious
Just change the title to: which is better iphone or android? (But i guess you could argue iphone is better or theres no winner and its a tie)
Android is the best for me..that's all I care about. These people's opinion  mean nothing to me not being  an npc
Well this video is actually more focused on marques opinion but it's totally different from my opinion and some others. I was an iphone user but hands down samsung is definitely better than iphone.. anyways great video!!!
delete it right now
A. I have choice with Android... B. I am actually paying for stuff I want, not an overpriced buffet. C. I don't want my phone to suddenly slow down with every new update. D. I don't want to pay 1500$ for a phone which will become outdated within a year. E. I am still using a phone which cost me less than 400$ more than four years ago. Nothing substantial is missing. F. One wire is my answer to every single appliance I own. If one of my wires die down, I simply have a replacement rightaway. G. Even if I drop my phone and screen's broken, I only need to pay some 70$ to get it replaced. H. For every strength of Iphone, there's an equivalent option in Android. Depending upon your use, you can buy a phone with amazing cameras, longer battery life, better performance, and better screen.
REMEMBER ITS ANDROID VS IPHONE NOT SAMSUNG VS IPHONE
especially that the iPhone is super lame in photography next to the s22 ultra and they talk about opening the camera faster in Samsung you double tap the power button and it opens the camera is a single step
I always liked you reviews but now from few days it looks like all Apple paid promotions but ppl know Android is better then IOS
super disagree with everything they used other Android phones as a base for comparison and it is incredible the level of ignorance of Marqués that he stops making videos on the phone that he is an Apple fanboy
I usually love all your videos, but this was just a total disappointment. Very biased, and neither of you guys are arguing to prove your point. Arun just gives up every time marques says a counterpoint. You could've made this video all by yourself, if you weren't gonna argue. I'd say this video would've been better if Arun did this alone. I hate to say this but, this is the only video of Mrwhosetheboss, which I gave a dislike.
Good one bro
Next video on making a dream perfect phone 😻
Felt pretty biased.
I think android is the best phone multifunctional also best performance and longer can use android , I use iPhone since two years I regret and will get back to android , cause iPhone lose the quality within a year if you play games and use more apps
I agree with MKBHD about the vibration motors on s22 ultra. I too have missed calls and messages and i didnt even feel it vibrate in my pocket. Very annoying
Apple gets 'Eco Conscious' because they don't give a charger with their phones, pls stop encouraging this behaviour of companies
The clear wins for Android were as draw, and the draw were given as win for Apple, pls re do this video, and solo pls
Apple 🍎❤️
You couldn't pay me to use an iPhone. I would rather not have a phone than have an iPhone. The only Apple product I have is a nano from many, many, many years ago, and that is only because I cannot find a suitable replacement.  I despise apple with the passion of a thousand burning suns.
ANDROID
Screen- Android (Samsung make the best Screen Arun himself told it feel like different class) Performance- Apple (Due there heavy integration on software and hardware Apple just take his category no doubt) Battery- Tie (See iPhone has the best battery and bad charging speed while Android might not the better battery but the charging speed is better, when is lacking something it's making up for it in an another way so it's a Tie) Photography- Tie (Always comes down to personal preference even in the video Arun went to Android and Marques to iPhone)  Videography- Apple (there is no competition)  Eco Friendly- Really (0 points for both i feel it just a way of telling no chargers included any more)  Software - Tie (Personal Preference)  Software Features- see apart from the UK and the US no one uses iMessage or Facetime So if are in the US or the UK - Apple maybe And if you not in US and UK - definitely Android  Customisation- Android (just because of lockscreen widgets on iPhone is better it doesn't mean it gets it There are alot more of what you can do in Android and material YOU your whole phone follows a colour scheme and you can change app icons, one can use different launchers etc. Android just takes is away )  Support- Apple* (Samsung is really catching up but as of now it's apple).{but apple sometimes significantly decrease the performance of a older model with new updates so you can may also call it a tie but on paper Apple just has a clear win}  Pricing- Android (No competition)
4 of the most used apps on the iPhone are Google apps. Therefore at the end of the day - it doesn't matter whether iOS or Android is better. Google wins either way. In terms of useability, it depends if you like to "own" your UI experience or not as to which one is better. In terms of quality of all the areas discussed - it was pretty much line ball.
Well deserved 17k dislikes
This is a quantity vs quality situation
Uses Android for more than one year and gives point to iOS 😂 talk about dumb
Dude what an ass talks about Siri and Google assistant but no change in point table 😂
iPhone is not just 13 pro Max. Also, one glaring correction - Display Android, battery draw.
Keep in mind before reading comments more people have an android this is a proven fact so of course everyone in the comments is gonna be bias but at the end of the day apple users spend more money (another proven fact) lol kinda sad really.......... imagine being so defensive over android yet can't put your money where your mouth is and support your company financially smh
Looks like i have to find new tech giants that are not under apple 🙄  shame 😕. Unsub
I have been with android for years ...I tried moving to IOS but it's hard for me ...   Using S20 ultra Snapdragon & S22 ultra Snapdragon and I just love it.
iPhone se value is trash. LOOK AT IT!   It has fucking bezzels. If Samsung made a phone that was cheaper, had bezzels but good camera, chip and had shit battery for the same price as the iPhone SE, you would scold it to hell.   Keep it real guys.
Lol andriod fanboys in the comments can't accept defeat ah..........typical
I see @mkbhd is on backfoot this entire video. First he said, he would love fast charging as he trus he can fast charge. Later he preferred best battery + mediocre charging. All of his videos, he always says iPhone has best camera. But front of mrwhostheboss, he was hesitating to say yes. Iphone has best cameras entirely. He also claimed that iphone doesn’t have best camera over any phone. That clearly shows these people when become teacher in their single video sponsor the brand and exaggerate but in debate they go to backfoot mode.   Thats why i like mrwhostheboss approach, he is pretty sticky with his opinions.
Android should have won damn near every category.   Photos/videos can be debated but according to their stupid guidelines or lack their of, pixel photos are better and Sony Xperia videos are better so Android should win.   Battery life can be argued too since the iPhone 13 pros have crazy good battery life, but they lack charging as fast as basically all androids now. So that could have been a tie.
Man, since when did MKBHD get bought by Apple?
Marques dating Tim Cook confirmed.
This one was awful I know you guys were biased for this one... You two missed out SO MANY important parts for Android that this is just a ridiculous comparison
This was just marques/apple vs android/no one.   Didn't matter what Arun said, points went to apple.
Hello mkbhd and mrwhosetheboss please can you get me an iPhone 13 pro max for a graduation gift 🥹
Wait a minute here!  🤔
The dislikes on this video must be high as
Love you Guys
I admire you too, but this video was disappointing. I won't call it an Apple sponsored video, you both may have your own reasons to support Apple products. But watching you two falling to the levels of Apple fans boys was disappointing.
This probably was one of the worst videos made by a comparative standpoint.   I watch you both and always enjoy your content. This one was poorly executed. The comparisons weren't on an even playing field, the point system made no sense, it wasn't objective at all and the arguments didn't make much sense a lot of the time.   You can't be comparing a $1500 phone to ALL of android which ranges from $100-$2000. There's just no consistency there. Then to cherry pick the best of apple with the worst of android is dumb too. Especially when the crappy aspects of androids are on $100 phones.   It should have been iPhone pro vs android (Samsung 22 ultra + other android flagships). So at least that way the price points are much similar.
Team android. Samsung preferably.
Again a proof that MKBHD promotes Apple devices. Mrwhosetheboss, rest assured you will get loads of views for this view. You guys must own loads of Apple shares 😂
Apple should have lost the screen one for that ugly ass notch alone. Let alone the fact that there are androids with faster refresh rates, better pixel density and the fact that android companies make their screens.   You can't compare the best of apple with the worse of android cause it's not fair.
Marques is too biased towards Apple. Which is fine but doesn't make sense in what's meant to be a "objective" comparison.
Hard to compare apple to all androids when you can buy android phones for $200 and all iPhones are significantly more. You should compare iPhones to android's within that same price.   If that's the case the android screens are WAY better. They supply apple with the screens...shouldn't have been a draw.
Ive using both iphone n android.. Some situation ios better than android and sometime android is more powerful than ios.. I think better to use both.✌🏻
BTW, iPhone displays are manufactured by Samsung.
You should buy and test renewed iPhone and Samsung Amazon
So what if I'm about the bluetooth audio. If Android uses more codecs like aptx for example. Then iPhone only uses AAC and SBC. would my choice be then Android.
I'm mad they didn't talked about how iPhone gets locked after a certain period of time I had bought an old iPhone once, it was telling me to make an update like 6 times a day every single day, so after a week or 2 I decided to do the update, and guess what ? The phone died Because it was an "unsupported / outdated" phone and thr new ios couldn't work on it lmaoooo This is so fucking predatory how do nobody complain about that ?? Your phone literally auto destruct after a certain period of time, because without updating.. an iPhone sucks, and if you update they don't even warn you that this model isn't compatible with what it tells you to download I can't believe there was no class action lawsuit for that it'd fucking insane  I can't even imagine a samsung doing that, everybody would be batshit crazy for that, samsung's brand ans ethic would get so badly hurt in the eye of the public But I guess apple users are used to being Tim Cook's money fleshlight so
Flexibility and community support wins Android for me personally. I know it's niche but if I buy a phone and the software is buggy I can just flash a ROM without this bug or root and fix it myself. With an iPhone you are stuck with their software and only what Apple wants you to do. Jailbreaking does exist but it hasn't got near the community support and flexibility of Android. But I do agree for the large majority of people, an iPhone is the right choice especially if you are happy to get into the ecosystem with airpods, macOS and Apple TV
Just the point that it needed comparison between iPhone 13 pro and multiple other Android devices..  The winner is clear
This video felt like apple was sponsoring it.
I think this video could have been better if a little more time and effort was put into it. I felt it was purely one-sided, and focused on strengths and weaknesses. EXAMPLE: apple vs android usb c: android winner, but instead this is what I got from the video: apple vs android usb c: well apple just got the usb c upgrade so apple the winner.
I am someone who likes things being New, i bought an iPhone 12 pro and i used it for 2 months and i felt like there is nothing new, my phone feels the same as x,xs,xs max and every other iPhone ever. I didn't feel like using iPhone 12pro but i felt like i am using and iPhone. I felt so bored, i exchanged it for OnePlus 8T and oh boy i love this phone so much. Anytime anywhere u can make ur phone software look different and refreshing. The thing about iPhone software is, if u have used an iPhone before and used iMessages and facetime then it matters much to u. But if you never used an iPhone before then it won't mean anything to you.
Apple haters:😭😂
u should write... android vs ios. not android vs iphone. iphone is a phone. not OS
I preferred both and I use both 👾
iOS Apple is a biassed closed ecosystem piece of sh_t
Best iPhone AD ever 😑😑😑
For me this is the most wrong video from you Aron!! Even Name is wrong... Android vs iPhone... Are you comparing a software with Hardware?? when you were comparing phones why you didn't pick just one android model. All the time you picked the worst model and very cheap from android phones to 1500 euro iPhone. Completely useless video! I push Dislike
At the core, apple represents how modern day monopoly looks like and Android represents freedom. Apple's monopolistic behaviour combined with their core belief of anti repairability  makes them dangerous. Finally Mrwhosetheboss talked like "Yes Boss" and not like a bold reviewer.
MKBHD 👎👎👎👎 An I phone biased review.... It felt like before even asking the question he is ready to say iphone.  And fact is he is using. Samsungs21ultra for 1yr 👎....  I am not either ones fan. But this vedios seems not fair
really felt biased even though I'm an  iphone user!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They Both make Valid Points and at the end of the day its up to the user what they want out of a phone. I always seem to choose android and keep dreaming about an iphone. (whenever it happens).  My best OS and Phone would have been the Nokia Lumia Windows Phones, shame they disappeared. Metro UI was Awesome and the Cameras were the Best at that time.  If Samsung would Just concentrate on optimising Battery and Performance It will easily Beat Iphone as that's the only place its lacking now.  Although Lots of People may find this a biased Video I agree that from a general public take On the Iphone would be an overall better phone simply for the Ease, Reliability and Great battery Life.  Then Again, I love  Android for Durability, Openness, Choice and Value for Money.  Will it make me switch to Iphone?    Been thinking about it for years and haven't got there Yet.
Why do you even need the comparison? Is like saying does exercise improve health? Or does stop smoking improve lung function? You are simply answering the obvious.
This felt like an apple commercial
Screen is a tie 🤔
If the final scores are 7.5 - 2.5 then there isn't really a competition here is it? No point making a video about it...... Oh the video is a complete waste of time.
I mean someone got really nice paycheck :)
why you had this at almost midnight
Fact: mkbhd is an apple fanboy 😂
The LAst category itslef says whats is all about.Its about price , nothing else.
I find it so hilarious of the amount of people acting shocked that these 2 are Apple fanboys. It’s been noticeable for years especially when it comes to MKBHD and the way he reviews iPhones vs androids 💀
This was not a collaboration, it was an interview
Sorry, very weak content and utterly biased. And my wife is a full on iOS person (with an Android on the side for little stuff), me the other way around - but both know they are both not perfect. I find your comparison vids @mrwhosetheboss always quite fair whereas this was from the beginning very manipulative.  So...yeah. Sorry. Thumb down.
WOW this was a trash review. It was about feeling not facts. They are probably bought by Apple and joined the cult
Totally Biased Towards Marques.  You Shouldnt Have Done This Video. Because You Didnt Really Tried Making Your Point On Android.  I Didnt Understand This Video Because You  Agreed On Whatever Marques Said.
Biased.....
I hope you like it, subscribe if you did And unsubscribe if you don't
Whatt.. Battery and iphone.. ?? I m done
Samsung wins 🏆
Me watching This on a Samsung .... and i am happy with the decision i made Apple was never my thing!
Lol.
Apple fan boys
Great video, too subjective though...comparing ios to all androids ? there are loads of poor android phones. Comparing phones to Samsung on the other hand, I can see a draw
The fact that they completely ignored the notch as the downfall of the iphone in the draw, that itself tells you how biased they are. They may have mentioned it but in the final verdict, they completely ignored it, meaning that without the notch, even trailing the s22, the iphone would have won. Biased. I didn't realize how far MKBHD is biased until now. Android draw even in the display? LOL
yo Genshin
“The most boring team to watch is often the best one”   Real Madrid in 2021-22 Champions League
I think iPhone wins here,it is almost better in every way
I saw a lot of bias come in but when apparently the most boring team is the best one to watch was thrown, so was all logic out the window. Anything that could've been a potential draw where Android had the upper hand was just ignored to give Apple the advantage.
GENSHIN
It's all subjective. I prefer android, a person who is older or has limited technological capacity prefers iphone
how biased do you want this  yes
They have a good point iphone is very simple and easy to use, that's why smart people use samsung because we aren't basic and are smart enough to figure out how to use more than one device.
This video was brought to you by Apple !
Just how much more biased can these guys be, iphone not being good is still better😑😑. Why don't they admit that they are just apple fanboys and call it a day. So, in reality their channels are I-Phoney
My first ever comment on a video of yours. I've always loved your reviews bcos they are so objective and unbiased. Soo sad that you would do this comparison with such a biased apple fanboy. Whatever advantages apple have got are offset by their high price, the non-existent exclusivity that apple users think they enjoy, absurd differentiations like the lightning jack or other limitations just for the sake of identifying itself as on a higher level than android phones. Also, naturally better ideas are generated and offered at competitive pricing when there is so much expertise in different camps competing such as Samsung, Pixel, Xiaomi, oppo, etc. on android platform, where as while apple provides good performance it would be at a hefty price and other sacrifices that the typical apple fan would ignore while they bathe in their imagined glory of using a "cut above the rest" or "on another level" apple phone, fuelling their personality as well. Marketing done right...  Anyways, very disappointed after appreciating this channel for soo long.
Android 💪💪
Biasedddddd
Samsung 💪
So MKBHD gave "Software" reliability point to iOS because of the vibration motor.... 🙄
Eh, wrong.
Two apple fanboys judging.
Im a Gamer … so the Simple Fact I can play GameCube… playstation 2… xbox games… nintendo 3DS… on my phone… and Apple cant do that Or the Fact u cant Do simple stuff on my iphone 13 Pro like Pausing during video Its ANNOYING.. I love iphone but for custom Im taking Samsung Ultra Over Iphone.
IMO Pixel is the best click and shoot phone camera ever made. iPhone is the best video camera by a mile
why is this so biased? sad to see this much bias.
Shoutout to the boss looking great.. and a great video collab..
Arun has a trait we call Agreeableness in Psychology, he was just agreeing with everything. It wasn't a fair competition in my opinion.
Been using both android and iOS, can’t bear the annoyance of android anymore!!
It isnt fair. Extremely biased video. I didnt expect arun to fall to that same level
Overall, iphone may last longer than most android phones. But that depends on the user's everyday activity. A preference thing i must say.
lit ep.
Android is king if God uses Android then it speaks for itself.
best video
As long as Apple keeps it walled garden and treats developers like trash, it's an instant disqualificaiton for me, no matter how they do other things.
Personally, I like change quite a bit. I used an iPhone 12 for a few months coming from a Galaxy S20, and it just felt like it got old fast. Sure, iOS generally felt smoother and overall more simple to use, but it never felt "innovative", it felt exactly the same as when I used an iPhone 5s. Now having switched to a Galaxy Z Flip, I can say without a doubt, Android offers the more exciting experience, both software and hardware. It just feels nice to use cutting edge stuff. And personally, I'm not really glued to my phone either, so occasional bugs/glitches aren't really bothersome to me.
He is biased to iPhone .
iPhone 14 will be a game changer
Na...you cant put a Samsung and then just say android....Samsung is better than Apple...as a guy that has money I choose Samsung over apple because the apple is technology  far behind the Samsung....if you say andiod that's where you can be like ya overall it's not better
Sideloading apps is huuuge for me, and iOS just is too troublesome to achieve that.
iphone is good unfortunately the newer iphones is not repairable anymore.
Thanks Apple, a nice commercial🏆
The only way to answer that question is to first answer this....Ice cold water or water with ice cubes, which one is better?  🧐
Is it 13 pro vs s22 ultra or iOS vs android? Which is which ,
Guys. Totally different Andriod sys and ios. Check what each term mean first 😅
Did they forget to add points for assistant? Should have gone for Google Assistant
Iphone is better. Know how i know? Because i use both of them.
I like android better than apple
As a iPhone user you guys talked about 3-4 better things about android that it never got a point for. More software customization. And others. Would definitely have made it more even
My biggest problem with android now is that it just doesn't impress me like it used to. Old android phones had lock screen widgets, cooler homescreen widgets you'd actually use, samsung phones had an ir blaster to use your phone as a tv remote, and many more interesting features, but android doesn't do that anymore. It's like they're slowly but steadily changing to a simple to use OS like iOS.   I would like android to take some more risks and embrace what made people like them in the past. Also for Google to push for more innovation on android. Remember how google wallet allowed for mobile payments, Google eventually stopped supporting, then Apple comes out with apple pay, then all of a sudden Google comes back with Android and now Gpay. It's like they don't really want to dominate the smartphone market.
I went  to Apple 2 years ago and hate it
I've had both high end ios devices and android devices, and most of the answers given sound like more convinience opinion due to their like of work. If you take a broader scope of use (not just social media and/or photography) Android its a better device. The only aspect iphone is actually A LOT better is video recording.
Android uyir 🥰🥰🥰 Malayalieeesss undoo
draw on the screen? sorry, but no
For me in my opinion i have experience both platform android and ios if we are talking performance here i would go for ROG 5s pro but iphone 13 pro max is still good for gaming though but i choose ROG 5s pro if its camera i would go for the iphone
Hmmm hmmm, fans of both of you..but I think this could've been less subjective and less biased towards MKBHD's preferences.
Android...Samsung to be exact💯💯💯💯📱
I just want you to "refer" to MKBHD's opinion.  His opinion should not be reflected 100% in the score.
Don't really care about android vs iphone fanboy wars, but the first point you both literally said that android has better display and you still made it a tie lol
Interesting, no surprises
i feel comparing iphones to "android" is a flawed comparison on its face. Because "Android" is a whole ecosystem, comparing "most androids" while excluding the androids that have best features to iphone completely misses the point of android. You want a phone that has the best camera? androids got one for you. You want a phone with a phenomenal battery, androids got you. Thats the whole point of android.
This is way too much obsession for an iPhone. I completely give it to s22 edge for camera and fast charging with the USB type c
As of now apple is on top because they are the best in the main aspects of phones, the 13 pro max has the best battery, perhaps the best set of cameras, and also the fastest chip in a phone, that is self makes IOS and iPhones tough as fuck to beat when it wins in all the main aspects of a phone.
So let me get this right, this was Apple’s newest lineup of phones versus every Android phone in existence and Apple still can hold its own?? That’s amazing!! Hats off to Apple 👏
Great content from 2 great content creators
I just see two iphone simps giving iOS free points not even kidding
You have already preferences set where you live so depending where you live biases show towards one or the other. But I am firm android user and I always going to be like that. Reason why is it is all other phone types except apple has android system in it. It is easier to get avarage phone of 250€ easier than buying Iphone.
Privacy? iPhone lost another point ; )
You should mess with VR, Its very cool
Love how surprised Arun is by some of the answers he got from Marques. "To take PHOTOS" got me real good.
Your most disappointing video ever.   I always thought that you were never biased, one of the reasons I loved your channel.  But this video shows so much bias towards iPhone.  It seems that you completely disregarded MKBHD's opinions when giving Android a flat zero on certain categories.  It's funny that you forgot certain functionality like better file management and file transfer on Android. Apps that you can get on Android but not on iPhone. Etc.   Very disappointed!  I supported your channel because of the high quality videos you produced.  I am not so sure that you deserve my support anymore.   Your next Android phone reviews will be very interesting.
don't compare the apple phone compare to other brands using the android OS platform??? let other brands develop their own OS and then compare it...lol
Both of these idiots don't have tre right to call themselves power users the don't know the meaning of the words!
The only one in android that why cant beat in performance is that the chip optimization, look how iphone consistently perform smooth, and that's why iphone release so long because they optimize every social media app into their new chips unlike androids
Two GOATS for YouTube Tech content!
Its like complaining with a trump supporter lmao why would you ever do this
Ok here is why iphone scks  Android provides you options and freedom  Iphone wants you to use only apple products its like insecure gf  Iphone is not for heavy users coz it restricts u and for that reason its reliable coz u cant do anything atall  And Android may not be that reliable but its more fun it breaks sometime coz u can use it heavily i means its like f1 car  This video felt like biased to me some of their words didn't even made any sense like the vibration one Once u join iphone community u will eat only apple an addictive apple good for u if u like to live on one food an expensive food which is just an apple But in Android community u can hav anything but u will also hav to pay but u will hav fun
Bro, these categories need to be weighted. For example, the camera essentially got double weight for having two categories.
I have to desagree with the display. You have to take the best display, and clearly it's the Samsung one. "Android" is to generic of a term nowadays to refer to something.
Idk why left Motorola  out cause they set the guerilla class fast charging and two day battery and also no duel camera using front and back Camera at the same time.
MKBHD has a clear bias.   MHTB would point out several Android phones that were superior to the iPhone in multiple areas in several categories, to which MKBHD would point out one specific Android model or across all Androids as the tie breaker. The Androids that are iPhone direct competitors are clearly better in multiple ways.   The cheaper Androids are for a different market of smartphone users who won't care about the specs.
not a fan boy at all that guy 😂😂😂
It's all subjective. But everyone is free to choose what ever they wish.
I'm so confused he vote for the iPhone for everything but his daily phone is a Android ?
Wow, I wasn't expecting iphones to win so many categories. As a user of both myself (despite being an android fan for a long time), I agree that iphones tend to do many things right, but one thing I dislike about iphones is on the software side - the file management system. Sharing a file/picture across different messaging aps is a simple thing for android, but for iphone, its a multitude of steps more. However, it is also a fact that iOS is way more polished than android now (I'm comparing iphone 12 mini to a pixel 5a) on my phones. iOS is smoother, works more often, crashes less often, way faster, and has less bugs. Android does have more customisation for tinkerers, but I've long passed that phase.
I don't think they gave the android phones a chance, "if you want a boring phone heres the iphone" it does everything slightly better, not mentioning anything special about android like i remember these two so hyped about the smallest things in tech but now it's like hmm it doesn't matter, btw all the questions were asked knowingly that the iphone has a slight edge.
I pick android any day because of its compatability with other devices. You can use any laptop to access your files in your phone using USB-C and that's a big win for me. Not only that, many apps are available in android that are not compatible to apple.
Guys I have huge respect for u two, i seriously think this content is seriously biased towards i phone, i expected better judgement from you guys.
Cool
Sir my iphone has disabled so I can't connet to internet or wifi so can u tell me if my phone is in disabled can I reset it by iCloud rest device can I connet to wifi or internet after the still the device is disabled plz clearify sir
Apple still sucks and I would never touch anything they made ever again
when the two of you collab. many lesson to be learned.
Next time Make Video with MKBHD in Your Studio
This one felt weirdly biased for you guys. There were certain times when iPhone won despite being the same or worse. For example, MKBHD said that the ROG phone had a better battery at 4:00 and he noted that a lot of android phones have incredible charging compared to the iPhone's "decent" charging. Despite this, it wins the point. For another example, Mrwhosetheboss says that for him, Android wins for the camera section, yet iPhone got the point instead of it being a tie. One more weird example is how in the eco-consciousness section, it's noted that the fair phone blows the iPhone out of the water yet iPhone still gets the point. Mrwhostheboss says that this is because he wants to compare flagship to flagship and that can be a fair point. But if you use that logic, the display section shouldn't be a draw because both parties agreed that iPhone screens are behind Samsung.  Edit : reading the below comment taught me that some of you don't know where the bias is or what the problem i'm pointing out is.  The problem is not that Android lost or that it was a close fight. iPhones are absolutely amazing and they deserve credit for that.  Some of you have argued that it won so much because it was compared to all android phones and not just the best ones. If that was the case, that would be fair but The problem is that they don't stick to that perspective. There are MULTIPLE times where they shift to putting the iPhone against only a few Androids (like the eco consciousness section) in order to give it the win (and multiple times where it wins because its agreed to be generally better than most Androids despite being worse than the best in class androids).  Shifting the comparison around to make one side more favorable is clear bias regardless of what side it's done for.
Can you do an affiliate link for Amazon Australia?
It was closer back in the day. I agree with what was said. I switch to iphone after 10 years of android.
The biggest pros for me on android are quality of life features like a keyboard clipboard history, not just a basic copy and paste festure.the second biggest is easily the fact you can minimise the whole display to reach all four corners, as opposed to iphones shrinking everything down for a couple of seconds with no ability to configure the size and position, or acess all areas of the screen while shrunken down. Lastly, technicals aside, just having one cable across all devices. Otherwise, I don't care much about the OS differences despite how obviously much smoother iphones feel and perform.
price range, availability,  market share etc a lot of points out there, android will definitely win. people are talking about iphone gonna develope a lot in future, what about android? will they just sit and watch? definitely not. Android controls 80% of the market of whole world where iphone is close to only 20%. Not everyone in this world are Millionaire to buy iphone and that doesnt represent the whole world.
This is flagship territory comparison. Not relevant for majority of people. Please consider that
I can't move apps where i want them on IOS and can't Run emulators on IOS either gotta stick with Samsung for that. Also iphone uses are almost as annoying as Vegans so thats a massive negative.
If you are a business, iPhone is better from a security standpoint. Otherwise, Android destroys iPhone every day.

Once apple allows me to use google play to play my games than i might switch.
Here comes the salty android fanboys
Very bad video
Not Genshin impact 💀💀
Should rename this to "two Apple fans shit on android"
Thanks for bringing Marques into this! he brought up some very good points that I wouldn't have thought of otherwise, that I completely agree with!
Came here looking for the salty android fanboys 👀
Personally, I think the scoring was based on personal preference and not on fact. You actually scored more for iPhone just because you preferred using it.
I think only  about ten percent of Iphone users  care about  those features.
I didn’t get a notification for this video! I’m sorry I’m late!
world class battery with iphone LOL
If YouTube could bring back the (dislike), you would be forced to remake this video 💩
You can find them to be equal until you realize how much more of your data is sold by android than apple. Google, Meta, and others don’t care about your privacy as much as Apple. That’s why androids can be sold for cheaper
Samsung > apple
I’ve been an iPhone user since the 4 and I could never switch to android. It’s simple the way I like it. However, I’d never use a Mac which is another discussion.
Marques wasn't a good guest for this.  I watch all his content, but his bias is overwhelming.
Isn’t it a bit unfair that, certain categories are given to the iPhone because only samsung beats it (display) while other categories are given to the iPhone because only budget/midrange phones(fairphone) beats it. As if those phones are not part of the android landscape. No fair😏
Type-C all day, Dex is life and Smasung breaks far fewer promises.  The ecosystem just seems like too much info for one brand to have. Android represents teamwork and forward thinking, Apple is always behind.
They both suck for each other goin cross platform... Cause if I get an update (android) and or my girl gets an update (ishit/iPhone) there is always a few days of issues where shit won't coexist so they all suck for 2022.🤣🤣 Samsung has there version of "FaceTime" but yet another no cross platforming not a mobile that can do
aplle aint got that zoom tho
The first and last iPhone I've ever owned was the 3GS 🤣 I'm currently a proud owner of the s22 ultra  $1300 🥴🥺
I really like both of you, but I couldn't disagree more of this video. A lot was based on promises about iOS 16 and also some of the stuff about androids you guys completely passed just to give it to the Iphone, for example, the customization on Android is priceless and you guys gave it to the iOS based on a promise. Also about the battery life, my friends who does use Iphones they complain about the battery all the time. Again, based on a promise, given points to the iPhone.  But I get it why both of you prefer iOS, I just don't feel like other people uses the way you guys use it.
Did you guys intentionally dress in all white and all black? 😅😅
Very biased scoring there. All of those 'draws' shoulda clearly been Android wins.
Genshin
Vivo 80X pro
I could not disagree more with marques' statement about the iPhone being more responsive (or even feeling more responsive).   I have an iphone 13 Pro Max and anytime I use my girlfriends S21 it definitely feels much faster and responsive.
Totally unfair and subjective
Myr apple
This Video is an Apple Ad... I was neutral but saying iOS widgets are visually better than Android widgets disappointing
What a biased video. Love your content but this was just a waste of time.
Two of my favorite creators but I just don't like the "Which is better a Tesla or the infotainment system in every other vehicle?" Why compare a full package Phone + OS to an Whole plethora of phones and one OS. :/ (I watched the whole thing but the better question is which one is better iOS vs Android? or  Which one is Better iPhone or Galaxy S22. I don't know that's just my take on it.
You went by plane all the way to the USA to talk about mobile phones to another guy when you could have done this by video call...thank you for your contribution to climate change ...if and when your girl friend or possibly future wife has your children remember what kind of world you helped  to leave them... Just my opinion..
I enjoyed this video .. buh to be honest most things said are wrong!!
Alright so let me put thus straight.  First of all, I'm a long time fan of yours Arun and I always enjoyed watching your comparison videos and the same goes to this one. But I have to say that you did dirty to android like it was legit unfair. There's a ton of features on android that Apple os simply dosen't have any of those and you didn't even point out a few. Like the split screen you said, yeah you maybe not use it that often but the MAJORITY of permanent android users benefit from that feature a lot like as a student my self, with the help of that feature, I could attend my online class and open my files all at the same time. And the fact that you praised the Apple os a ton but didn't even mention the latest huge updates that android has brought to the market with its latest updates.  Overall, the video was good but idk it really sounded like two hard core Apple users/fans  just wanted to declare the apple as the winner and trash the android with some really biased judgments and by overlooking all the apple os weaknesses. I don't know you see this or not Arun,  but there are simply some features and things in android that I won't exchange it with any apple products.
Good colab but as for me i give functionality to android especially Samsung while battery 🔋 life to iPhone  Because android has an endless functionality but iPhone you’re limited 🤔🤔
Something is seriously wrong in this video, android was never given a choice... I mean how many android phones have they actually used for long apart from Samsung, we have the likes of pixel,oppo, OnePlus,vivo,Nokia,realme,xiaomi etc this is not about unboxing and you throw it in the trash then you go back to iphone and say hey look everyone iphone is better, iphone is really good and same as android but this interview or what ever they call it doesn't seem fair and right. You guys can do better as tech reviewers and not bringing your personal liking here please... I miss the days when mkhd and mwtb will review a phone without being personal but actually saying the real truth of how it is.
WOW. 2 Fanboys of Apple gone wild. Lost all respect for both of these channels. There is no way these results are in any way meaningful. Money talks
The best tech reviewers in one vid
Display section draw 😂😂 Also, iphone widget is better than  Android 😆😆😆
I like android for being somewhat virtually modular, and leniency towards what's allowed being able to tweak and customize my apps my OS more to the way I want in regards ios so +0.5 android. Lol androids are the innovators brain stormers iOS the trend setters future proofers . jk
Don't care what they say am still sticking to android ☺️
iPhone is boring!!
Nice Collab but the video sucks big time
Where do I start… I regret buying my iPhone 12 Pro. Wasted $1000 USD on a POS brick! The iPhone is worlds behind and has the worst camera in the business. Can’t wait to go back to a Galaxy S phone once my contract is over. Apple still sucks even today.
Why don't you use the S22 Ultra? Am too broke
The worst thing about owning an Android is the iPhone users who are constantly complaining, mocking, joking and generally looking down on you - because they have an overpriced iPhone and you have an Android; even if your phone is better, it just happens too often to argue every time.   EDIT: not ALL apple users i like this, I'm just recalling my experience with a Pixel 5
......Get to access the camera seetings from the camera itself, and the iPhone goes back to zero points.  Pretty sure the average user disagrees with all the points you made there.  IOS is just horrible to use. Period.
iPhone it's still living in the past, only good thing it's the battery life,and that's because it's missing a lot of features which android phones already have them for years, I'm using an Samsung Galaxy S22 ultra and this phone it's a beast,it have everything you need from a phone and much more than big notch iphone 😃
you two simply have a contradiction in what you say that misinforms people I am a user of the iphone 13 pro max it is very good but you have your mistakes, Marquez disappointed me in this video.
As a life time Android user, I'm thinking to switch to iphone now and there main reason is that is been a long time since a truly good Android phone has been made. In fact the last perfect Android phone was HTC one. Samsung is not Android phone. It's basically built around the stupid Bixby. Galaxy watch doesn't run on wear os. Pixel is just disappointing in many aspects. All the Chinese brand are lacking something. So, as much as I HATE apple, but at least the quality of their phone is better.
The 20 % reuse needs to be those damn cables that are destroyed all the time. I hope USB-C will soon be a thing on all devices.  How can you say that that iphone have better wigets when android phones have hundreds pf launchers you can use. If you think the orginal is boring on iphone what to do then ?
I'm still happy with my S20 ultra, I don't understand how the S21 ultra and S22 are cheaper than what I paid for the S20 ultra on release
I love that the S22 Ultra had 69%, beautiful touch
I swear hes an apple fanboi
Bro just decided from the start what phone will win
That's why there is a tool so that you can hear the vibrations on the galaxy... But if you use so long an iPhone you don't know these features, e.g. you hab the setting to make the vibration hearable or there ist nearby share etc
if you want to be locked with product-Iphone, if your want freedom of choice, android  and universal compatibility -android  tech imprisonment-iPhone
Surprised you both don't know "Nearby Share" Exists on Android. Amazing. 😒 The Samsung Spen suddenly doesn't exist. Incredible 🤡 ios now has more customisation than Android. Exquisite 🥱 iphone has a better camera than both a pixel and s22. Continue 🚶🏾
I don't know  y he is  marketing  Apple?bcz he giver5/5 for  s21 ultra  last year. Even his all vedios are  saying  about best premium, cheap,Camara  and affordable  price range  . I didn't  seen any 5 ratings  for  Apple.  May be bcz of he getting  money   Apple. I was his fan but  this is worth less  epi from  him
I would love an iphone. But until they put a USB-C on the phone, add the fingerprint sensor back, and get rid of the ugly notch, I'll be sticking with my S21 Ultra. So basically I'll never be getting an iPhone because I don't have confidence they are ever gonna bring Touch ID back.
Actually, there's the Samsung M51 which I'm using right now with 7000mAh battery
Thanks for waiting for apple to catch up to do this... very nice of you
Naah i dont think this was fair at all
I think comparing "the average flagships" totally misses the point of android... the point is that you have options. So it's like, who wins between the vertical integration king and the OS with options... when you take away all the options
I stopped watching when Iphone got point for display.... smoothness is in terms of system and you should not take it as a.main factor to rate DISPLAY. Android is years ahead in terms of displays. Pop up camera, under display camera 144hz refresh rate even punch hole vs notch....
@Mrwhosetheboss , Can you make your own version on this? Most of the reasons didn't seem as justified and even the comparisons weren't how you do it, as there are so many counterarguments that can be brought up which isn't normally the case with your vids. Overall it didn't feel like your video. Obviously this is just my personal opinion and I don't mean to offend anyone.
I like having a damn choice not an iphone
Personally i prefer using samsung over my iphone. Reasons are  Easier to navigate through and operate. Some things on android or samsung are just easier. Also samsung makes life easier for me as i can connect to almost anything i want to. Iphone is just a big brick with no real function.  Its like a nokia 3310 with big screen and necessary apps. 🤢  Makes it very boring.
Mkbhd's bias is so overwhelming he's always gonna cap for iPhone, like he's on their payroll or something. It's crazy. I have an iPhone and Samsung. And Samsung out performs my iPhone regularly.   As far as the camera goes... I've yet to have an iPhone user who didn't prefer my pic over theirs.   When I take pics on my phone and post them, my son's screen and colors leave a lot to be desired.
To be honest AD in fact is much better than AiOS but each has its way of doing things. In fact Samsung photo gallery editing is better than Apple photo gallery and for the caviar Android share menu is better for apps on iOS is limited to share directly, You can’t share a picture or video from apple gallery to Reddit but you can on android
Android phones have wayyyy more potential than apple due to being more open sourced to many companies such Samsung, vivo and oppo ect are making top notch  phones and I feel like they don't get enough credit for it. I feel due to android's accessibility and support to download apps from any source.i feel Android phones give you so much more customizability than apples. Also one last thing to note is that android gives you so much more control over your precious files eg: do you wanna change your JPG to a PNG? You can do that with a simple rename.  Thank you for listening to my ted talk
This comparison doesn't make sense. Compare iPhone to Samsung, or Pixel. Not iPhone to Android.. Andriod is an Operating System and not a phone. A fair comparison would be to compare iOS to Android. It's 2022 and these guys that do tech review's still don't get the difference. Pick a top end Samsung/ Pixel  phone and compare it to the top end iPhone.. pick a middle range iPhone and compare to middle range Samsung/Pixel.
For me personally I see it like this:  iPhone does the basics very well, but doesn’t have some of the very useful Features that Samsung and other android phones do such as Always on display, fingerprint sensor, under display camera, better notification/ control panel on android, better battery saving options, better display tweaking options, better charging etc.  It’s all subjective
🤓🤓 Android users 🤓🤓
For me Iphone and apple in general make just overpriced things and they don't inovate anymore... so 🤮🤮🤮🤮 apple
Intresting. 2 apple fan boi talking?
Cool video
I gonna buy s21 ultra. Thanks mkhb !
166k👍/18k👎 Pretty hot topic if you ask anyone
Iphone is boring with the same look without fast charging and little choice of apps and no finger unlocking
this feels so biased for the first point they go like "oh android has better screen and better shape but lets give tie then for the camera they go like its a tie but it goes to apple :moyai:
MKBHD is clearly an "iPhone's boy", so this interview is quiet unfair. Get someone into Samsung, and you will see a game changing here
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT TECHNOLOGY?🤣🤣😂😂
It seems they are discarding the simple fact that if you are going to compare android and apple, and you are saying what is better in certain categories, you can't discount the fringe phones in Android.  Especially the sustainability factor. If your main focus is the planet, you can't argue getting an iphone. You will get the fringe android. If you want specific features, you will get the android meeting those specific features. If you want to take photos, you will take an android having the best camera etc.  If you want everything a little bit, you can argue for apple. Video apple is leading. But I disagreed with how they approached this.
This video was nitpicking and biased
I love listening to you guys talk (in collaboration & solo) even most of what you're saying totally goes over my head lol
Is fast charging bad for cell phone batteries? My Samsung Galaxy A 42 charges in 2 hours or less.
I would love to hear what you guys have to say about this issue. I've actually seen in that move on its own. Don't know why apps move on their own. I don't understand why appdata moved back to the internal storage when the app is not being updated. I've had apps rearrange themselves and folders disappear. I've even had settings reset themselves. I would really love an explanation for this if there is one.
I think this is just more of what Macqure likes than having a comparism,  If iPhone was that good, it would have the highest market share
This is an interview.. recheck the title.
This video doesn't seem well planned and riddled with twisted metrics. For instance how do you narrow customisation to widgets and further down to lockscreen widgets which Android has had for years with varying experiences and quality (Not custom homescreens, lockscreens, fonts etc) or the ridiculous narrowing of features to iMessage and facetime and Airdrop, all of which can be done with Android phones but only not with apps that come with the OS, plus third party apps usually do it better.  From a user of both iOs and Android.
I hate so many things about this video. It wouldve been better as a podcast with no bgm.
Great video, as usual. I was wondering why Marquees looks a bit tired, until you mentioned what time it is at that moment.Then it made sense. Nice seeing you both talking about tech.
to be honest.. this comparison is wack and stupid..  iPhone is environmental friendly? when you have to buy a separate charging cable just to charge your iPhone? how is that helping the environment? you shouldn't have done this video if you are just going to give all credit to apple.. this just feels like an apple ad
FIXED IT  🔨 _____________  Camera : Draw  Screen :  Android Software : Android Customisability : Android Pricing : Android Virtual Assistant : Android User friendliness :  Android Fast Charging: Android interoperability: Android Power/Pro user friendliness : Android Dual sim support :  Android   Software support : iPhone Battery : iPhone Performance : iPhone Touch sensitivity :   iPhone Audio :  iPhone Security and Privacy :   iPhone Environmental friendliness : iPhone Less bloat and adware :  iPhone
The tie between android and ios in the display department set the standard on how biased this video is going to be which pretty much carried on throughout the rest of the video.
This guy is a lie
Ah yes, the video that shouldn't have been made Literally a rage-bait, I expected more from these great youtubers.
I phone is good but never an option for me maybe not yet I prefer android and will pick it over apple
Both are EXTREMELY biased and Apple fanboys
Fantastic video thanks to you both great input on both sides of phone land
android all day everyday... huawei, xiaomi and vivo... not the sht samsung and crapple... smartwatch olso.. i go huawei or xiaomi
I feel like they compared all android phones from all price ranges mainly to the iPhone 13 pro and pro max so the highest end of Apple. I feel like for the display category its easily Android with the lack of notches and so many high refresh rate screens where as only the iPhone 13 pro series have 120hz. You can find a whole bunch of Android phones with 120hz or even 90hz QHD displays with no notch. Personally I'd give Display, Camera and Software features to Android and give battery a tie due to all the fast charging capabilities lots of Android phones have. I would also give performance a tie due to all the speciality performance features some gaming Android phones have and high end Android phones have.
@Mrwhosetheboss, airdrop, imessage? Really? Android have always had nearshare and their chat via the message that comes with every android phone. The difference is that android dont force these apps to be used like the iphone… lots of android features that has been existing but people dont use them cause google dont market or force em
You have to compare the most powerful Android phone with the most powerful iPhone on the market, and don't compare several Android phones with one iPhone because it's not fair, this video is not serious, and the silent fans is reality.
Is it just me or is it funny that the keep mentioning android I mean android is unfortunate but I feel like Samsung isn't android they should make their own OS and leave android
the best eco-conscious phone is "don't buy new"
Mrwhosetheboss  after seing amber heard & johnny depp court case..... i say objection leading!  all the questions and argument of Mrwhosetheboss are TOTTALY LEADING... thats why he win by cheating 😤😬
I like both, but I always go back to iPhone just because iCloud and how easy it is to access everything I’ve collected throughout the years
The Joke Of 2022 Compairing Iphone🥵Vs Samsung🤧
20k disslikes???????? wtf
Samsung sales now  📈
mkbhd is such an apple fanboy...
The fact that iPhone is always  Behind android and having to copy what android is done Just shows me that I don't want to phone this 10 years behind time
When they got draw on customization i was like what the hell ? 🙂💔
I just wish this video was more practical rather than a personal preference from the two sides, it would have showcased the actual result between this comparison. Nevertheless, the video was a good one 😊🔥
17:58 Aaron- androids IPhones MKBHD- I’ll just carry on the conversation.
Very good my bro
I think you did android dirty in the sustainable category. Apple uses 20% recycled materials but when it goes out of support it becomes a paper weight. The android phone however as long as it keeps going you will be able to continue to use it.
I love iphone but I can't deny this video was insanely biased with mkbhds opinions. They always overtook Arun's.
Unacceptable opinions 😒
This was a good comedy session. Now let's get serious: Samsung 22 esp Ultra is Da BEAST. Period!
For value apples long support is a bonus, since you can buy a phone and use it til support runs out, they are fast enough.
My take on this video is that it doesn't make sense to compare a phone (the iPhone) and compare it to "Android" (an OS). I get the intenation here but you can see some weird scenario in the video where they are trying to look at "Ok, what phone running Android should we compare this too ?"
I’ve just recently went from android to iPhone and I would switch back as soon as a decent phone comes out.
Android 😁😁😁
I will always choose Android over iPhones because of being able to do what I want, how I want it and just more useful to use. Quicker charging, split screen, change the look whenever, put what you want where you want it, put music into my phone without depending on software. I just love the freedom. No knock against the iPhone but for my everyday use, it's always going to be android for me.
As an iphone and Android user, i believe this is a very biased review.
I clicked on this video so fast 🤣🤣🤣
This video is at least 50%🧢. I honestly think Apple pay them to do this.
I think that the comparison is a reverend 💩 it practically seems that they are comparing the iPhone 13 Pro Max with my Redmi Note 7, and as if that were not enough, you do not even give the point of the virtual assistant
MKBHD will never let Android to get  the lead
I prefer Android just bec i only need a Phone to call or to massage so i dont need to buy a expansive phone and Android is mostly cheaper than ios
When Markass Brownlee thinks facetime, iMessage and shareplay matters to people, bitch stop thinking world is only USA. Nobody uses those shit in other countries and regarding app experience, all the local apps work better on Android for me than an iPhone. For airdrop, you have nearby share which is equally good. And finally not everyone can afford to buy an iPhone, it might be 1000$ in USA which is an affordable amount but it is around 2000$ in some countries
Very interesting video guys! Kind of broaden your thoughts. Keep up the good work 👍
Display a draw???come on tech guys!
I could easily get along with either an iPhone or an Android phone.  It sounds like the same is true for both of these reviewers.  I chose an android phone because I refuse to reward to "lock in" business practices that Apple exploits.  It's amazing to me that iPhone users buy their phone for a the terrific camera then accept that when sending pictures and video to people using other devices the quality is degraded to 1990s levels.
I had no desire to finish the video for a few reasons. I've had iPhone and Android and I like Android far better. Will never have iPhone again. JMO
The iPhone takes it all.
I like both iOS and Android but I stick mainly with Android because I use a few apps on a daily basis that can only be obtained on Android via sideloading or only function with rooting via Magisk. Android also integrates better with Chrome OS which is important because I use a Pixelbook as my main computer.
"its a whole year old", my phone finishing 7 years old
MKBHD talking like he is biased towards apple ....even more than Tim Cook ....surprising he didn't say apple cleaning cloth is slightly better in his ass than TP....FU MKBHD....also arun don't do this in the future have your own opinion or ask a regular user
what you mean in updates samsung is closest to iphone? samsung only recently begin to give updates upto 4 years but that only last 2 generation not beyond that. while google pixel is better than samsung even tho samsung release more phones since even a old google device still got so many years of security updates and more android upgrade than any android does.
Iphone is like living in a box, its made for newbies. Android is all about freedom.
It just kinda sounds like MKBHD is a Iphone fan, and Mrwhosetheboss is a fan of both which makes it kinda unfair cause MKBHD is just saying all the time that Iphones the best all the time.  (Just what it sounds like to me)
Android 📱 anyday any time
I usually like ur vids very much but iphone is still the shittiest shit on this planet earth apple should go bankrupt in my opinion
I use iphone but much prefer Sam . Also i can put any app i need on it. iPhone needs to be jB . So Andriod any day .ps I also like dual sim .iPhone doesn’t . USBc is way better .just saying
I think I’d rather see a comparison between iPhone and a single android manufacturer. Android lost points because some phones are great and others are terrible so iPhone got the win.
I haven't gone to halfway of the video yet, and I believe iPhone won. There's a few reason I love the iPhone but there's so much reason I'll choose Android. To me iPhone would be awesome if they decide to make gaming phones.
This androids battery is better than apples but.... apple is world class so point for apple.... ?? Smh click bait to instigate
i think its too overrated for iphone..for screen i will defienetly will go for samsung..that guy is so biased....i have 13 max..but still it lacks customization,other camera features and so on..it would be good for apple users who has mac,iphone,ipad. But for only iphone users its not good..you should depend upon apple environment
You can tell where this review was going after the first test. In a nutshell -yeah the android screen is a lil better visual. Yeah the android feels nicer to hold but maybe not to you.... yeah let's call it a tie..... do you feel the ram adds anything. Nah it feels the same....  I consider myself a fairly hard-core user... hard-core apple user yeah...
I had music on a friends iphone I was borrowing, and I couldn't get that music off the iphone easily. I am getting a new phone now and was considering iphone until that experience with the music.   Also... USBC. like really.
MKBHD is a iPhone fanboy and you can see it clearly. Android is better but its worse and iPhone can do XYZ better... man it just angers me
15:37 ; i don’t know if Arun planned it that way, but it looked so cool when the score was at 1-6 and the ios 16 logo was in the background.
did they both just skip the fact that Google already fixed the software limitation that didn't allow androids perform properly in third party apps?...were you paid by apple????
It's a pretty big fail in this video that you can be unsure which side of the score or color is Android and which one is iPhone.
It's Android vs iOS, not an operating system vs a device
Fun fact you can't mod iPhones🤣💔
how will battery go to the iphone? how will you consider Batteries like the s22 ultra mediocre?/ whattt?
I can't agree with a lot of this things Because I use both and the Samsung is way easier to use in daily phone than iPhone  My opinion of course 😌  Mkbhd this time waste my time
MKBHD is a pro Apple fan, obvious.
Didn't know that MKBHD is this much of an Apple fanboy, gonna take his reviews with a much larger grain of salt now.
This guy used IPhone for a long time i wonder why he always chooses iPhone go get someone who uses Android let them debate😑😑
It's a bit pathetic that people are getting frustrated with Marques's opinions and labelling him an Apple fanboy. He's always been fairly objective but even I can say, as someone who's only ever had Androids, that iPhones are probably the superior choice overall right now.
Samsung s22 ultra and the iphone 13 pro max...both are great phones🔥
I m android for life, ''The bond between Android and i cannot be severed by anybody''       Hmm... Sounds somewhat similar right weebs !!?
This whole video is just one apple video, I don't think it's done right,I'm no fan anymore. Why why why?  I'll stay with smasung for life. And I hope there is someone what's going to bring out the good and bad points of Samsung and apple in a true way,without going with just apple not doing it right. That's my opinion.  Tnx
you cant just say android and then bring only samsung, what happened to xiaomi, google... and you can't put other androids into consideration in this comparison because apple only makes flagships, no proper midrangers so its only fair to compare androids in the same category, the first point about display was bs, what of the gaming androids with sample rate and refresh rate that have never been seen on iphones???
Really disappointed Totally biased
It seems u support apple
Buh Samsung can last up to 2 days with a single charge
Apple fan boy vs neutral guy who do you think would win? Yeah no surprises here.
Flawed methodology, skittish.
I personally like mkbhd. But in this video he trying to white wash the iPhone. I don't agree with this. Becouse i am a mobile phone technician. I always watch his videos. He trying to change his old opinions now. Too bad to see this.
So 20 minutes of why my Samsung S22 Ultra is a piece of crap and I should have got an iPhone..... Great, this is fine...
To me from very first MKBHD seems like an iPhone fan boy
Paid promotion wow!!
why would you ask a question for a iPhone fan boy there is no surprise at all.
Already subscribed so can't subscribe again. Lighting might have sucked but within the super interesting conversation, didn't really find any time to notice that. :)
Mrwhosetheboss is smarter than MKBHD. And Android will always be better than iPhone since 5S. iPhones has a convoluted UI and stupid function-limitations, more boring, no wireless charging.
"very close"
This video is poorly made in a matter of valuation because they are comparing all the androids against only the iPhone 13 pro max the comparison should be against all the iPhones if they are going to compare this kind of thing there should be the minis the SE that nobody is going to prefer them 😐😐 And where is the point that they should have given to Android by Google assist against siri because siri is years behind in that sense 🤔🤔
The moment they gave half a point to both for the screen, I knew this video was going to be trash
These two are world best tech reviewer but now they are just acting like apple agent.... Battery point for apple seriously.....
Samsung 💯
Also Apple is purposely slowing last gen phones to make you buy the new one.
Apple locks you in with imessage and ICal. Apple also sucks for file storage support and usability. Get a video file on your iPhone from a PC easily? It doesn't happen.
These were biased questions. He literally asked the questions that iOS does better and then down played whatever Andriod actually does better 🤣. Fanboys of either device is disgusting
Interesting episode 🌞🙏
You have to compare the S22 vs the IPhone 13 or Google Pixel vs IPhone, but you CANNOT Android vs IPhone, and you even said it fair comparison should flagship IPhone vs average Andoid which is the S22.
I would never understand mkbhd opinions, why a phone is better, like when he said the pixel 4a is his favorite phone.
Great guys I love that ;)
I have never used any iPhone or any flagship android phone but I can still say it was an apple biased review.
you both are iSheeps, what do you compare here? you are not adequate
Came for the war in the comments section.
Still ANDROID is the best♥️🇮🇳 Apple has some top features but with unimaginable prices so what's the point??? For me always "Phones value for money" is the most important🥰 Android First♥️, that notchy apple next😂
looks like a paid video by apple
Marques has always been very pro Apple (as if he's their rep), so no surprises in this video
WTF
I think it's unfair to compare Apple to all of Android at once. The title suggests you're comparing operating systems, but many of the categories were actually hardware- related, which led to you comparing iPhone, not to its best competitor, but often to its worst. This video was clearly never meant to be a fair comparison.
the most stupid comparison of android vs iPhone that I have seen
I can’t wait to see the “civil” responses to this video.
😩 I'm at 8:55 and can't believe I'm finally about to be convinced to get a freaking iPhone.
*Galaxy S22 Ultra vs iPhone 13 Pro Max - Which is ACTUALLY better?
Mkbhd seems very biased...
MKBHD: sponsered by apple💩
I like this so much, I hope make more videos together ..,
this vid is a waffle
iPhone owners will say Apple and Android owners will say to them, I told you so! 🤣
really.....I mean really....one of the most unfair comparison 🤭🤭🤭🤭 I am just laughing at their points...it's like the decision was already clear for them....from the start 🤣......clearly unfair
You can literally do the exact thing with widgets you do on iphone now on an Android from like 10 years ago 😂 your android aesthetic is as aesthetic as you make it ,you can literally customize it to look exactly like the iphones 😂 damn this is sad
Enjoyed this video, from two my favorite people. Love your work
Imagine saying iphone is catching up in customization with lock screens, how does that make any sense 😂
This is more like MKBHD supporting Iphone for 20 minutes straight 😭😭  Customization is better in iphone??? Am I in a different universe or what because there is no way iphone customization is better than android 🤣
Does he not know that android can video call and share applications and media with multiple different apps?😂😂😂 TF?
Would love to see this video without MKBHD and mrwhosetheboss give his objective opinions. MKBHD I don't rate him anymore
13:15 yeah, there are a ton of things the eco system enables you to do that you don't get with an Android, but the issue is really that you need to get more Apple devices to take full advantage of it and then you notice the missing things when you want to make the switch back to Android/Windows.   Like an example would be how I can copy this text here and simply paste it on my iPhone. I use this a lot, copying a link and pasting it in messenger for example. Airdrop is also something I don't want to miss anymore. The same for being able to pick up a call on my Mac.  On it's own Android is definitely more feature rich, especially with niche things... Apple can compete when you are in the ecosystem.
To me , my iPhone purchase is one of the  worst decisions made in my life. I bought the iPhone to replace android but now looking forward to switch to android back. Moreover, paying extra for charger!!! I am done with it.
Lol android can do all of those massive pillars literally 😂😂 he says it like androids can't video chat on multiple apps, iMessage? So chatting ?😂😂 And airdrop ,oh right ,sharing apps and media? That a million apps can do on Android across any Android device 😂😂😂 that was funny
MKBHD = Iphone Biased.   There! I said it!
No offense but I have always felt that Marques is biased toward iPhone.
It's weird. IPhone only won because it copied android, and most of these bias opinions apply in the US than anywhere in the world. Just think about it.
Meanwhile, me, living in a country where no one cares about iMessage and Facetime.  I have an iPhone XR and Samsung S10e. And really it's a matter of choice: Samsung S10e is my daily driver, not an iPhone. I miss a lot of things in iOS, that Android has from the beginning.
It's simple: if you want to be trapped with an ecosystem where you don't have much control over your experience, but the experiences that are there work fluidly within the ecosystem you're trapped in, go with Apple. If you're someone who just needs to fully own a product that you've spent your money on, and you want control over what you buy and how you experience it, go with Android.   It's that simple.
Two big iPhone Fanboys bashing Android
If yt had dislike sec u would have gotten much..
I think there is a biased iPhone opinion here .. don't know where the facts in that?
I've owned Samsung phones, and I've owned more iPhones than that. I think that iPhones have a better aesthetic, and feel more user friendly to me. Based on my opinion, I agree with every point you made in this video, I love how the video is not biased towards one brand, Great video!
Holy shit, so many cry babys complaining about how iphone won... Watch the video again and understand the important points my god... clear easy points,
Display goes to android, no doubt. They have always on display, in-display fingerprints, thin bezels, notchless. And iphone se 2022 is absolutely not a value phone. That phone is just rubbish for that price
I see in the comments people fail to understand that this is their personal preferanse and opinions
I prefer the flat sides of the iPhone becatit gives me more grip on the device, and I can prop it up way easier
you lot are just violating android
Arun, I believe you swapped to iPhone a while ago. You don't use both like Marques. I would be curious what Marques uses the Android S21 for, if you two rated the iOS so highly why still carry an Android. What purposes are better used in the S21 vs the iOS?
Good video. The great news is that both sides now have excellent phones. I’m a former Android fanboy and now use the iPhone along with most of the Apple ecosystem. But I celebrate the fact that if you know your use cases, budget, etc, we all have good options these days. None of these are terrible anymore. If someone asked me to advise them on a phone, I’d be asking about their use cases, budget, etc before anything else, and suggesting something based on that, and I’d have plenty of options these days. Phone tech wise, we live in a great time period. The rest sucks. Lol
This has to be the most biased video I have ever seen! Google should probably sue for defamation smh!
Samsung android is best
I think I got the wrong IPhone because my none of what you guys are saying is my phone. This is a new phone not used, up to date on all iOS updates. Yet it logs, the battery dies faster then my Samsung galaxy note 10 plus. And this is a iPhone 13 pro. And it overheat.
The video is sponsored by iPhone.
I missed the part where u didn't say,"a subscribe to this channel would be....."
Finally I got an iPhone 13 pro after years of Android, and I hate it, mostly because of the OS...
Battery part should definitely go to android
Still i would pick samsung 22ultra over iphone 13 pro max
Note 20 ultra is the last good Samsung phone. Samsung is going downhill in my opinion.
I agreed with this. Not a fanboy or hater, but have used a lot of smart phones since 2007.
iPhone wins for me. I use it a lot every day. Im running iOS 16 Beta and its flawless.
What ????? The tech reviewers i loved watching talking all these ? 😂 I personally own both but hearing this make me laugh 😂 (in a pity way). Display iPhone ? 😂 Multi tasking you don't use but so that's useless ? 😂 Photos ? I regret watching this video. Lost respect
So you’re comparing one iPhone model to the best Android phone in each category whichever that might be? Not really fair.
The word " ACTUALLY " means this battle is gonna be no less than a WW3.
The reason iphone wins, is because it limits itself to a few phones. It is a far more closed up environment.   From a developer perspective it would be at first glance easier to develop for apple phones, since there are not so many to test on. But it also limits your way of developing, what features to use and so on.  Of course, you can never say: this app runs on every android with that version, since there are so many. But if you develop for iOS you only develop for one company and only a small marketshare.
Iphone is destroying android in this video but I don’t think that everything was fare with android in the video
I love the features androids provide, no offense to any iphones but i love getting new phones and experience new tech, and features ,like i love Directors view on samsung, no need of flipping your camera around, 8k recording,  single take, Samsung Dex, reverse wireless charging etc
Emulators, controllers, non store apps... android kills Apple imo
Iphone users in my community are always asking for chargers.  Giving a winner to iphone in battery is a mistake. There are phones like OnePlus who have great battery and also charge quickly
Ain't no way Iphone won the multitasking portion by just switching between apps quickly. This video is very slanted and not non-biased.
Feels bad what are u guys really saying ohhh😬😬
This has got to be the worst video either of you have ever been involved in. You clearly rushed this video just to have Marques in it and it's beyond embarrassing.   So disappointing.
Such a biased and pointless video, that other dude really has not tested any of his claims whatsoever.
This comment is a dislike button.
I'll never switch to apple, os is terrible, phone is worse than android counterparts in every way. Only people that use apple phones and think it is superior are technologically unintelligent people.
No way in the world I am taking an iPhone 13 over an s22 ultra. I love modded apps, I love the freedom android gives. Also Samsung display is way ahead of iphones screen. No comparison. Then camera is the s21 ans s22 ultra everything and everyday.
i am part of that minority dat will choose android because of its customization
How can you compare iPhone with Android. You are comparing phone with a operating system.
What android has which Iphone lacks is the ability of side loading applications. This feature alone is a deal breaker for me
Hi apple… MKBHD and Mr. Whoestheboss made an ad for you.
It was a nice discussion but I would say it was overly subjective in favor of Iphone. Anyways enjoyed it thumbs up.
Actually Android not lost, it's Arun defeated by Marcus.
Hi
Marques comes across as a bit of an Apple shill here.
not a great comparison. I expected a lil more from you both
It's accurate...  But somehow I feel like if we want some luxury and something like best screen probably iphone...  But if we want some good performance well go for android
its not the only phone that has a notch
The ability to download APKs is the only thing making me use Android. I decided to buy an iOS so many times, might get one as a secondary device.
About giving the phone to mom - the person who doesn't going well with digital electronics, would be stunned by any of the phone - would it be iPhone or Android.
I phone has almost no zoom it hasent split screen and a phone without  that just put it in the bin for all i cear it is a must have . Iphone It hasent thems so you stuck with the same ugly borring s...t and ofcours the sd memory card for that i am stuck with android and for samsung it has a s pen that is a must have is a big down grade when you dont have it .the dex on the samsung is a alfa omega thing ..so for me most of my friends have iphone and thay have to charger  in the phone all the time so that the battery is better on the iphone is so so  Those know that are very happy with it   dont really use there phone alot . The note 20 ultra i got afther 7to8 houres on screen time uses about 70 % of the battery dipends a bit on the movie and even when i look att movies i use the splitt screen to chat or googel stuff and this is now a 2 year old phone so iphone has a long long way to go .
Dear Brothers,   I want to inform you something about Galaxy S20 series. After a year later or after update one UI 4.0 or 4.1 display is not working normally. Sometimes it's flickering,  sometimes green and sometimes full white. There are many S20 users complained about this.  We are suffering with this issue .we want help from both of you.
one minute guys, one another question  iPhone vs Android: -  who have usb-c port ? -  who have bigger repair scores -  who don't lock the parts by their serial numbers?  -  who have normal file system?  -  who have sd- card expansion slot?  -  who had 2 physical sim-slots?  -  who  have fingerprint sensor at the  back and under screen? Alongside with facial recognition. ....... and counting  so much categories missed, huh .....
Arun and Mkbhd did a collab just to bully android I guess..! 😅
Android has more features that are useful to a lot of people
Hey dumb  dumb want gum gum? All flagship are the same. It's a common business practice.
Can you do a Xiaomi 12 Pro review pls
Anyone take a picture of the moon lately on the ultra 100 zoom? Is that a simulated moon? Or is it authentic? My full moon came out almost telescopic on Tuesday’s full moon.
sponsered video by iphone
Comparison feels wrong. It should've been either manufacturer vs manufacturer(samsung vs apple) or software vs software(android vs ios). But great video nonetheless.
I am praying for you right now Receive your Healing, Breakthrough, Blessings and Miracles in Jesus Christ Name Amen!
The video was sponsored by iphone🤣🤣🤣.
Stupidity presented with authenticity. Way to go!
I'm my view S22 ultra has -  Better Display Better cameras for photos  Better hardware Better software - features, customizations. Most importantly - Cheaper buying options - best trade in values. I got it for $600 from Google Fi, can't get even a basic iPhone 13 for that price.
Is it me, or is there a large amount of android users that have android devices because of their dislike of apple? Like I know those users still like android for their unique reasons but working retail around smartphone market you start to hear the opinions of people and it’s crazy how many people have sided with android because they think apple is for idiots or similar reasons. And same could also be said for apple but most of the time I saw it coming the other way.
Na man, I thought this video would be fair, but here we are with these influencers 🤔
They named a full eco friendly android and still gave the point to iPhone 😆😆😆 MKBHD is so bias lol
Flaws of averages, do another video on Samsung vs IPhone and bet results will be different. Great video though 👌🏽
What a poor video,mist use the latest samsung and not last years s22 ultra
Actually I'm surprised from this results, I think the difference in score between Apple and Android is too big and I own an iPhone 13 Pro (and I still have my Android). I'm agree when you say that iPhone does overall better but Android has improved his average level a lot and it is just one step behind Apple.
Liking the video for the content but the eco consciousness conversation was amateur.   Firstly, you should frame it as sustainability, which varies e.g. you should have mentioned software updates under sustainability.   You also didn’t consider basic things like how long a phone lasts in terms of durability and how long the average user of each flagship keeps their phone - that impacts the second hand market. If a phone is durable the second hand market has confidence in buying it. You could’ve also linked how easy devices are to repair. Something as simple as the use of type C across all devices also wasn’t mentioned.  Hope this is seen as helpful feedback as oppose to just bashing you for the content 😊
MKBHD is like: I know iPhone is better but I use 2 year old S21ultra as my daily driver.
MKBHD now owned by Apple.....poor promotion tactics
This comparison is so unfair.
I feel like you two are about to come up with a bad ass smartphone based on your god-like exchange of ideas 😛
Apple watch series 7 vs galaxy watch 4 vid
You know what, you can put it in this way if you have $1500 to spend on a phone, which one would you buy,,?
Side loading ??  Can't argue with that
iPhone biggest advantage is the ecosystem. iPhone has synergy with your watch, home, TV, Macbook, wallet/financial, health and in the future Apple car and VR. There's nothing that come close if you use Android.
Grumpy android
Samsung has the same thing. They have air share and duo
I mean ... are we even surprised?  MKBHD has never been secretive of his love for Iphone and now you make a video were all the subjective positives of Iphones gets pitted against the combined faults in any android flagship phone and have the dude who publically states he prefers Apple pick the winner per category. I have an s22 ultra which I love using for a variety of reasons and I know I would never go Iphone for a variety of reasons. That's it
Android sucks. You cant even text videos that arent all pixilited. I dont care WHY this happens. It happens. Its a pain in the ass.
I can hear android fans crying down here 😂
I've used Android exclusively since 2010 and don't have any immediate plans to switch, but honestly the iPhone is getting more and more tempting every year. If they add split-screen multitasking and USB-C, it might be what finally puts Apple over the top for me.... although the lack of a universal back button or gesture would probably drive me insane. So maybe not. lol
The file system and usb C combination is a big win for android
Comparing Iphone to android is like comparing riding a horse vs using a tesla model x plaid for transportation. OBVIOUSLY  the android is faster, sleeker, and way more customisable. Yes there are horse girls out there but they are labeled crazy for a reason.
Totally biased I must say worst video of ur channel man... Totally time wasted
This video was a disappointing one. You've made many great comparison videos in the past but this is not one of them.  Not fair to android  Didn't expect a video like this on mrwhosetheboss channel. The way we feel about you guys are that you two are genuine tech reviewers but this video didn't make in to that category.
Now th real tech community will knw how biased MKBHD is towards Apple...
Love the content both of you put out, and awesome collab!. Much success to you gentlemen.
USB C Innovation Better looks This all belongs to Android
20 minutes of my life waisted for a sellout, 🤡 🤡
Are you kidding? Iphone have better screen and better  camera... I own a 13pro and Fold3 and S22 Ultra. Im I blind? I don't think so.
Is this an apple advertisement video?
I always wonder why no youtuber calls out the very obvious lens flare on iphones that's just makes photos n videos unusable.  🤔
Wow
👍
Switched to android last year with s21 ultra. Android has way more features. Apple doesn't have a video pro mode, picture pro mode. Very huge deal for me. Dual camera shooting, filters, and many modifications. Screen sharing is so much easier. Touch ID is amazing! The screen is incredible as well.  If you need airdrop or any other old feature from Apple simply use any old phone to remain in the ecosystem. It seems as if these guys get something from Apple to always boost Apple products. Bought iPhone 13 pro for my wife and I'm just not impressed. It's the same phone as my iPhone Xs Max with a "few" upgrades. It's cosmetically appealing but to make the best social media content with flexible video capabilities the s21 ultra is best for me. You can change the iso, shutter speed along with other things you can't do with apple.  Because I use a macbook pro M1 and my wife and the majority of people in Dubai use iPhone I simply keep my iPhone XS Max around for airdrop only.
Smh, Nope
This almost made me unsubscribe it felt so subjective.
When mkbhd talks it's so relaxing Does anyone else feel the same?
Did anyone else feel like Arun just let Marques tell him how to feel? I didn't feel like Arun agreed alot but just went with what Marques said and that's kinda whack.
Marcus is clearly a bit biased towards iPhone. Samsung Note is way ahead of any iPhone, it's a computer in a small form
🔥
There will always be arguements for both sides people who like iphones are never going to convert as they are used to that operating system and same goes with android users definately hate iphone charging cables though prefer usb c 👍
Samsung dex is nuts I use it for emulation and mobile games with a ps5 controller on my tv You always got that 16:9 fullscreen in games although the phone got a 20:9 screen
If u compare iphone vs samsung for example, it would be tougher but hete ur comparing android phones in general including the meh and trash ones so ofc iphone will win.... which seems unfair
Most Android phone have better battery than apple
All the people complaining about bias should also analyze their own bias. Mywhosetheboss has always been pro android and as his viewers, want validation for that. MKBHD has always been pro iPhone, so his viewers prefer that. Since they’re collaborating, Arun probably wants to hear what he has to say which is why it’s more like an interview and very opinion based, not empirical
There is a big bias because you compare android that is on premium but also cheap phones so you will overweight the baddest experience you can have compared to Iod where you will use as a reference the 13 pro or the 13
Been an android user this whole time but I currently just got a iPhone 13 and it’s just simple and everyone I know has iPhone so I guess I’ll jump on it. But I also still have a google pixel 6 and that camera is top notch and my google pixel is linked to everything google so something I keep using. Get the good on both worlds
what hotel is this?
My I phone 7 is my diamond 💎
Android has Mi Music.
The software features being a draw, mehn...👎 you never highlighted what android does well but only what iPhone is doing. How can lockscreen on its 16 which hasn't been launched yet be better?
I guess I'm in that niche group Marques is talking about. I prefer to do a lot of things on  Samsung phones that iPhones can't do. Like Dex, sending files over bluetooth and Wifi Direct, broader support and easier setup of emulators, torrents, customization, the s-pen, dual audio, broader file system access, etc...etc... I miss when Androids set themselves apart from Apple more in terms of hardware features. Like removable batteries, IR blasters, headphone jacks, memory card slots, etc...etc...I feel like, if Android removes so many features to copy Apple, eventually, a lot more people won't see any reason to buy Androids when they could just get iPhones. Google is putting more restrictions on Android while iPhones are starting to have more customization. 10 years ago I never would have thought this is the direction we'd be headed into but here we are.
👎👎👎👎👎
Well if you're a content creator then Android gives you more content, which in turn gives you something to look forward to.
Gotta go with the S22, because of Dolby Atmos. Does the iPhone have it too? I don't think so.
Wathever you say android is the 👌
wow his hairline is receding
Ok, 95% of everything you said I disagree with. I think it is more close to 50/50.
As for software support...Android should have taken that just based off how many phones they have to support. And as you mentioned, the aftermarket support available...
The best
Android
Watching on my android 9
I literally hate iphone for no reason If someone give iphone I will sell it and buy a android or exchange with android
Two the best YouTubers, if we're talking about the technologies.  Smart, positive,  well prepared,  funny and intelligent guys.
Marques is too much of an apple fanboy to take him seriously here, it was cringe.  Even Arun was looking at him a few times with a confused face lol.  He is so wrong on display, multitasking,  photos, eco friendliness,  battery, customization!  And everytime Android or Samsung had a feature apple doesn't, his excuse was well I don't use it so we won't count it 😂
Draw in screen and a draw in customization ..lol  Americans are chained with imessage
This video contains promotion.
Respect to this mans effort. He literally got the samsung to 69% for a 2 second scene 1:08. You are a legend, keep up the good work!
iPhone is better because iPhone is better
I will tell u the truth now why iPhone is better because android uses Java which uses virtual machine that is a mandatory part of Java and we know what VM is an os inside of an os so more cpu processing and more latency whereas iOS runs the data directly on the cpu and doesn't use that heavy compiler c language which is the fastest language so no delay that's why during gaming we feel gyroscope delay even if it's sampling rate is maxed through an app we get 500hz on android and the delay is still higher than iOS sensor which is 100hz yes 500hz slower than 100 Hz this also means that it isn't necessarily that apple uses higher quality materials than Samsung or lg just another example is if lg and Samsung are designing apple LCDs which is a fact  would they prefer to put high quality components on their smartphones or apples it's all down to the software and their optimization which is another topic.
I think this more based on opinion than the facts because u guys aren't really looking at the specs just what u think. But I personally like android better
One more plus point about iphone being eco friendly is that it provides longer update so I can use a phone for a couple of more years and save on some electronic waste.
This video is biased because I see things Samsung can easily win given 50/50 or rather goes for iPhone favor. And lastly the vote was JUST the 2 of you but then I would strongly request for a poll.
I love  prophet Muhammad saw
Arun is playing Genshin :0
“I accidentally trigger Siri, more than I use Siri” 😂😂  i love Marques! Glad to see this colab 🤭🥰
apple team forever
I Unsubscribe
This video feels extremely disingenuous, for example; the first one clearly wasn't a draw if you both think that the top android is better than the top Iphone.. You cant just say android vs iphone and then compare only the best iphone vs a sum of avg androids, it should be best android vs that said iPhone not an average of androids, or then take into consideration other iphones. This comparison makes no sense, why are less than the best androids being considered in this debate when you compare them to apple's flagship ? Apple's APU would still dominate hardware, that's not even my point, but it just feels wrong to constantly go ''buuut some androids are like shit'' when on the other hand you are only looking at the single latest iphone...  ...Not to mention that none of your actual opinions seemed to matter, whatever MKBHD said was gospel and taken as the result, this video felt so wrong in so many ways : ( if i wanted MKBHD to tell me how much bias he has towards iphones i'd just watch his channel man.
From a repair tech view-point, currently iPhone takes the W. Samsung is a nightmare to work with, their testing software is buggy as hell, submitting a ticket for IQC and OQC is buggy, and Samsung REQUIRES a report of the IQC and OQC results. Google's Pixels are EXTREMELY buggy, fragile, and finicky to work with, and Google is very strict and regulate the repair itself. Apple's iPhone though, the calibration and testing software is easy to use and WORKS, and the phones themselves are designed and built in a way that makes it easy to learn to repair. Yeah there's the occasion that one of their anti-repair tactics gets in the way of conveinence, but iPhones are just physically easier to repair and less daunting to approach.
Finally, Apple bought Marques 😁🙌
Worst video I've watched from these two. I'm beginning to question their objectivity.
For me android as an os is better. The problem is with the manufacturers. I use iphone 13 pro max
Hmm this video sponsored by mutherfuker apple 🍎
This is shit
IPhone is not battery king the battery king is Sony experia 10 iv
For photography, people tends to forget about the Sony Xperia lineup. One of the best or the best photography phone. The Pro-I has one of the best phone camera lens and unlike iPhones, it allows creative photographers to tweek camera settings such as Iso, Shutter Speed, Aperture easily. One thing that I prefer androids (the Pro-I in this case) more than iPhones is that you can switch to Raw from JPEG. For creative photographers, that is one of the most important feature. So i think androids should win this category.
This Was Just A Spiffing Comparison Between Android's And iphone.!!! And Yeah iphone's Are The Winner's.!!  😃 Keep It Up Mate @Mrwhosetheboss Make More Content Like This Cheer's.!!!
Wake up   Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah.

Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.

I had a Samsung and now have a iPhone and the brightness is a huge difference on the Samsung when outside not sure how he is saying it’s very very close ?!??
How much iPhone gives you 😀😀😀😀
Ngl it's very bias
FinLy
While I do disagree with some of the points, I do think this video was pretty good. The funny part is seeing Android fanboys getting salty at the scores.
Is it just me that I feel mkbhd sound soooooo biased to apple
Such a biased opinions that make us think apple sponsored ur travel stay and much more..
I switched for 2 weeks to an iPhone X from an s10plus cause it is in repair… and boy, I am looking forward to my Samsung. So many small things which didn’t work on the iPhone… pop ups all the time, smallest crossed to take them away.. so many software things which made my life so hard, that I grabbed the s22 plus of my girlfriend 🤯
Samsung needs to stop holding back. Give us the best camera, battery, and processor they can… and this would be no contest Android win every time
I have a love and hate relationship with apple, but I find interesting how we are comparing the iPhone to ALL the android phones and the iPhone still manages to somehow come on top
For me, it's full on Google Assistant and it's dictation features. When you ask Google Assistant a question, there is a highly chance it will respond with an answer
There is no reason to make draw between iPhone and Samsung on display because Samsung is the king of display.
Airdrop is in Android and Chromebooks and windows now. It's in your settings and you can send an Android version of airdrops to any Android phone
Me searching in comment section for a holy war between android and iphone fan bois 😂. But I see most comments addressed to MKBHD and Arun. They both are most charming than everything else.
one point where android wins over iphone is the fact that android available at all price range, in low income country it allwos people to afford a smartphone. And i have seen people using 10K mi phone for more than 5 years and it does the job for them
i totally oppose the video i support andriod
And the iPhone is still the o lay phone with Face ID. Why is this glossed over when talking about the notch. The other competitors do not have this technology and thus their notches are just for show.
why i open this disappointing video again..  lel accidental
why are you forgeting that the dispaly and the chip A9 or what ever it is  ar from Samsung ? ......
Mans made a lot of "draws" when it should have just been iPhone...but I get it, my friend. It's tough to admit that iPhone really is as valuable as people fear it is.🙂 And I like both os's.
MKBHD is a appole fan boi
@Marques Brownlee such isheep bias
Marques: "with Pixel my photo can disappear!"   Please..........
Iphone 13 camera is not good in my experience. The X has better cams
I'd prefer to see just Samsung Vs. Apple. It's obvious Samsung is the king of Android
I just hate how many people ( not you mrwhostheboss) underrate androids....
This was absolutely the worst video not even comparison video, I have ever seen. I stopped watching MKBHD a while ago because of his bias but a ton of things he said just didn't make sense. You can just see him drooling for apple to give him a sponsorship.
This was basically just a one-sided video on how great the iPhone is, by winning categories that clearly shouldn't be winning
id take 6hr on screen time with xiaomi anyday over the apple cuz with the xiaomi i know i can plug it for 10min and ill be up from 10%-80 and with the apple for 10min ill get 15% battery
Thanks for watching.  This video is Sponsored by Tim Apple
I think a 'deal-breaker' for me is the speed, reliability, and consistency. What I mean by that is like when you swipe between pages (or swiping in general), loading time, touch response or any sort of delay/lag, and SECURITY purposes.   If you think about owning and using the same phone for 3+ years (maybe even 5+ years) especially if you want to 'save money' or whatnot, I give iPhone the edge because Android phones (from what I have experienced) tend to get super laggy and occasionally unresponsive nearly 2 years later. iPhones tend to maintain the same/similar speed, response, and loading time consistently over longer period of time (maybe peaking at a certain point in time, but longer than 2 years). Granted, I have not used an Android phone for very long (not longer than 2 years) and have bought and used iPhones a lot more than Android phones.   Secondly, I have heard about many security flaws with Android phones or at least hackers easily targeting and exploiting malwares towards Android devices. iPhones tend to have better security and are less likely to be hacked from the outside.   Again, there are other reasons that you yourself need to consider. But I believe speed, response time, and security purposes are the major things to consider in a phone (along with improved battery life, lol).
Apple is for "sboroni"
A lot of butt hurt android users in the comments 🥵
As I thought. iPhones are right up there with Android. And eventually the iPhone will seem operable.
Marques as always a bias specially on huawie phone thats y i never watch his videos
20:07 MKBHD handle it like politicians
bruh ur comparing android vs apple with the biggest apple fan boy ever whats the point
I would always go for Android despite you calling the Capple IPhone the clear winner.  For me, adjusting to my liking is the highest attainable and that IPhone does not have.
Love the video colab but I'm so confused by the scoring.
both SPY on you perfectly well.
Only during the time I had online exams I used split screen hehehehe...
I'm normally not commenting on videos at all. Mostly I'm just a silent viewer enjoying your content. This time I really need to comment something though.  For myself, I've been using Android from the start. I've had a Sony phone and later on changed to Samsung since the S3 came out. That said, I still know about everything Apple brings onto the market, what they change and everything around that topic because I am just a tech enthusiast and love to know what happens in the tech world. Nevermind if it's Apple, Samsung or Nokia.   Saying that, this video was completely biased. I really like and enjoy both of your content and follow you since a long time, but this was the first video I needed to stop watching because it felt like it was more a promo action to Apple than anything else. Instead of going head to head you either talked down Android (which is obviously not a brand but a hell lot of brands) or said something that Apple can do in some scenarios that no one ever thinks of. I really hope you could do a remake of this video with a little more... I don't know how to say it, respect (?) for android.   PS: I want to say that obviously Apple has a lot of positive things coming with it and I really love seeing those things get points and rewarded. But seeing that this is exactly the opposite when you're talking about Android is really unfortunate.   Thanks for reading! Have a wonderful day bois and grils
HUGE DISLIKE FOR THIS VIDEO. Is it a paid promotion of Apple?
Homescreen app organization?
This looks more like Apple vs Samsung than iOS vs Android.
As an Android user iPhone SUCK
No matter what Android does, MKBHD personal favourite is Apple iPhone 😂😂
Bro..worse content ever Comming from you guys 😪 Just lost my respect and trust
Really disappointed 😞,  all the parameters are favor to Iphone
Repairability?
Did you attention that android flagship always cheaper than Iphone in same storage. about 2/3 or even 1/2 price so value on price in android will be better
Look like paid
Sponsored and brought to you by Apple
Sponsored and brought to you by Apple
Can you do apple vs samsung only and not all of Android like this video.
the other guy is paid by apple or something?
When you talked about the displays, it was obvious that the Samsung's display was better but you called it a tie And when it was about eco consciousness, you just said let's compare flagships 😂
this isnt android vs iphones cuz android is a software and yall mostly talked about hardware and that's just every android phone out there against iphones
18:9 and 21:9 aspect ratio videos cannot be played correctly on the YouTube app when using an iPhone.  This problem has existed for a while and has never been fixed. User experience is degraded for iPhone users watching videos:  - In 18:9 videos a piece of the notch protrudes onto the display  - In 21:9 videos it is impossible to zoom out to fit under the notch  Today the only solution is to quit the YouTube application to play 18:9 and 21:9 videos correctly on Safari.  Unlike the YouTube application, Safari adapts its display aspect ratio under the notch of the iPhone.  Such problems do not exist on android, so the choice is simple.
Worst video ever made
Seems like mkbhd is promoting surely iPhone,
😔 I honestly think mkbhd bias
How much Apple paid you both ?
This is clearly an advertisement for iphone.... you can tell from how you speak about it.

Ok.. you lost me there: Lets talk about display - Samsung has slightly better but iphone has a sharp edges of the body so lets call it a draw. Dude WTF??? :D This is why i don´t watch MKBHD. He does not know what he is talking about.
No talk about repair-ability? No talk about how iOS is a walled garden? About headphone jacks? About proprietary charging cables? About SD cards? You talk about photography and don't mention Sony's new pro line? Yeah, this video isn't for me. Too quickly thrown together without enough thought. Not to mention you're comparing all phones that can run android to just a handful phones running iOS. You weren't really fair to either.
Marques is biased ASF.
pretty biased one😂
The fact that you Need a Computer to add a ringtone on iPhone is simply embarassing.
Actually better iPhone
This is not a kissing ass comment, cos simply you guys have no clue who the heck I am.....You guys have THE Best content on the internet. This is what our hope was, in the 90's for the internet, before Facebook hijacked the soul of the internet. Also, this was no contest the second Marques put on his Apple Watch 🤣🤣🤣...just playing, personally I don't doubt the sincerity in his evaluations.
Android is better ..always..logically..Apple is over rated for the rich
A nice video but it's weird how every android win was either put as a "ehhh, apple isn't as good but it can be" (customisation) and counted a draw or completly not scored at all (assistants or maps). Also scoring apple as definitely more ecofriendly is not correct either. What about right to repair, no usbc etc?
Smh i think this is bias asf!
Why is Marques always deciding??? NO!!! S22 Ultra is waaaaay better... i sold my iphone13promax for the s22 ultra... So many usable features. I'm angered by this video. There's not even an always on display on an iphone. I'm fuming.
kind of biased to everything to Apple, atleast type c is the clear winner and they let it go to iphone.
watching the video on a 100 DOLLAR  PHONE🙃🙃🙃..pain in heart
I genuinely don't think people would feel any real difference between the two, at least not iPhone and Samsung. The trouble android has on the whole is initially it was laggy and buggy. Some people haven't used an android since 2010 and think it's not changed. My s21 Fe (so a mid range one) literally as smooth as anything for day to day use
I think they're very partial with result  That fax
Battery to Iphone??? Doesn't make sense at all
for me I can certainly do without iOS but I can't do without android. love both iOS by the way .
The biggest issue for me with Android(Samsung specifically) is the smoothness. Like is you do the gesture to switch between two apps(slide the bar), the apps sometimes glitch and it takes you to completely different app for no reason. Like animations are so glitchy on android, I am surprised no one is talking about that.
Apple biased video
Great content.  You seem to forget, the samsung phones give you so much more in there phone's,  that the battery will always drain faster then an IPhone. Put a live wallpaper that's always working. And see how fast it drains. When it comes to camera,  can you take a shot of the moon with an Iphone? Enough said. Customization Android blows out Iphone hands down. And don't forget samsung has good lock which gives you 100 x Moore ways to customize your phone.
Android no1 Using rog3 He is beast
This compare is  not make sense. . Now compare phone is more focus on camera. The essential of a phone is phone call. Iphone does not have the very basic feature call recording. Put aside what legal rules. But it will not go t it even in country is allow.  Amit it . Now a good android can do what other phone can do. You does not lose any thing .
Okay.. My question is to MKBHD........ One simple question..... You explained all this very nicely and voted to Iphone.... So how many times did you given your Best Phone award to Iphone in your previous years ?????
yeah ask an american, of course they will choose ihpone. even if the winner is true, i also will agree iphone 13 is very good. but yah we have to wait for 13 variations before "it gets good" android phones has always been crushing it since its conception. fact. just like they said. iphone took they own sweet f***** time to bring their tech up to speed. just like they said, now iphone us good. so those who bought iphone since 1-12, wasted money? iRock nation? just give your money to the company just because its an iphone.
Interesting take, fun to watch. All in all when it comes to buying a phone, money, location, usage, support, all these come into place. In my country would I recommend iPhone? No, even old iPhones are so expensive here, like the seven. $220. Gamers here, we go for android because it's much more affordanble for great peformance  The downside for Android here is payments in the app store. It's always about not being a supported region. So many workarounds to access in app purchases or the Game pass. But with the iPhone, i did all that smoothly without even having to change the in app region or get an international debit card.
android is better cope
Honestly Apple doesn't deserve the win on the Eco friendly contest. A couple years ago when they released the Iphone without a charging brick under the guise of being Eco friendly, they kind of forgot to mention that THAT particular Iphone model required a higher powered charging brick, forcing everyone with a previous iphone model to STILL go out and pay separately for that charging brick. So I don't agree with your judgement that Apple wins that... they are anything BUT transparent.
Without watching the video I can say the  the answer  "It depends " Do critics ever say like this is better thank that
While I agree with much of the assessment given here, I really do feel they avoided iPhone weaknesses when they were discussing hardware such as still using the lightening port, zero options for a headphone jack and general lack of innovation compared to android options (folding phones are already common with Android).  I'm just surprised that they wouldn't even bring these topics up.  I don't think either is a fanboy, just seemed to avoid areas that would work against apple.
For the algorithm. ✊
you too guyz on  a date something or what ? though I wouldn't tell who is the date host here , what kind of faces are you putting on ?!!!
The Collab we never expected but we needed
When comparing these two giant OS, it 's gonna be very hard to not say that it's gonna be based on personal opinions. Kudos to Arun for taking the challenge to set the winner
Amazing debate and collaboration
You are just saying that iPhone is better because you think iPhone is better and you dont have a view from Andriod. So you are lying about very much stuff in this video and you are saying iPhone is better although andriod actually is
Loved this and nice take!! I have used both for many years (and worked for Samsung) and yeah, I have to say iOS really has evolved and has become my personal go-to. Nonetheless, loved the critical thinking at play here.
Fascinating conversation. Two experts  imparting knowledge to viewers
Looks like u ve been  paid by apple to do this 😜
Fascinating conversation. I really liked it.
Jdjdh
I’d disagree on screen, the fact in 2022 Apple still has a notch is terrible. The punch plus pill isn’t much better. I also find the design boring. For design they just compared to Samsung but there’s lots of android.
I’m an Apple user but this felt kinda rigged ngl, there’s some where android should’ve gotten it, like repairability should’ve been talked about more. But fair enough, Great video!
7:02 the pro color thing is probably the actual normal camera and the normal camera is actually a worse camera on purpose so they can keep on this gimmick lol
i felt it like i-phone ad
I use new iPhone 13pro Max and this is very big,premium phone
I like apple because they just work. You don’t have to worry about it falling apart, or glitching out. iPhones automatically update all apps, which I had a problem with on android. It is just easier. It might make me seem lazy, but I like the reliability, and how easy to use they are. I will never go back to experience the android world again. Ooh again, apple is actually cheaper too.
i hate ties
tbh i feel like android shouldve won
well i have used lumia, siri and google assistant. what i found that Cortana in lumia is way ahead of its time like 6-7 years ago cortana can do most of the staff that siri and google assistant can do now.
Bias
They mention the iPhone Mini battery life should be compared to similar sized mini Android phones... Which phones would that be exactly? Because i would love to buy one!
I stayed with Android for customisability, custom ROMs, and the variety of forms and specs. But over the years Google hasn't gone further with the customisation path (still no custom icon pack support in default launchers), widgets were left to dry, Google assistant died for me when they removed Snapshot instead of developing it (so what is the point of that data then - just ads), custom ROMs are unusable due to banking (and other) apps refusing to run on a rooted device, the launcher. Also all flagship Android phones are the same now - huge phablets that barely fit in my pocket, with no creativity or experimentation or niche appeal at all. I would be ready to move to an iPhone Mini, but it looks like Apple cancelled that too...
SAMSUNG IS BETTTTTTTTEEEEEEERŔRRRRRRRRRRRRR FOR LIFFFFFFEEEEEE
Argument is irrelevant it's like arguing what's better   BMW OR MERCEDES   THEY ALL DO THE SAME SHIT
Dude... 6 unskippable ads in a 20 min video... Wtf
Different models is another Android win. I can get a regular phone or a fold and have a different experience.
All i phone's are made in China.
soooo wich one   won???
Piss off pathetic shills HA  Apple is for simpletons
It feels a lil bit weird comparing a bunch of different android companies to a single one with like 4 new models an year…might be just me tho
U can't give a point for iphone for power management caz Samsung also has to manage 120hz screen, much bright as well as managing spen🤧 which doesn't exist in iPhone.
How much is Apple paying you
Most annoying nonfeature on Apple ever has got to be the notification system.  With Android I can instantly see if I have a notification without even touching it.  With Apple you have to develop the habit of constantly picking it up scrolling the screen to check it.  I regret buying it every day for this feature alone.  Lightning port is another.  There will never be a Dex equivalent even possible until the lightning port is scrapped.  Blacks in photos take a LOT of light to overcome.  I have a black dog and she's just a spot on the screen most of the time.
You didn't mentioned that we have limit on phone's perfomance..if we unlock it android wins!
Having Tasker on Android is a big win. It let's my phone do things automatically. Want no ringer at work, done. Want different sound profiles, done. Want to control brightness, haptic feedback and audio at night, done. Want to create a daily task list, done. Haven't had to touch ringer volume in years. Also, apps like Folder Sync to backup the entire phone makes sure I have a current backup every night. Yes, Google has my photos, but I have a copy of them too.
The Screen is a HUGE EASY WIN for ANDROID considering only the existance of the notch in iphone is a fail, ALSO the INNOVATION MOTO the Apple says its a LIE as in 14:14
I really love the video
I think Android is slightly worse than IOS because Android is an open system and IOS is closed one, so Apple can polish and everything in their software. On the Android side, this would be very difficult.
Thanks for the information am unsubscribing you guys
Couldn't believe, you let iOS win over Android.
So a couple of Apple fanboys pick the iphone, shocker.
Everybody wants their opinion to be the winner lol… funny shît… you’re bias, you’re bias and you’re bias… lol…..guys calm down…. If you prefer android use android if you prefer iPhone, use iPhone.. it’s that simple…
Is that it???? It's a lot to discuss ... Omg this "experts" really dum
how much 💰💰💰 get you from apple?
Yeah sorry to say but this video definitely looks paid for by Apple. They're at Apple HQ, on a trip that they sponsored, so this video had to be lopsided in their favour. As an S22 Ultra user who's family has owned, immediately regretted and then sold their iPhones very quickly, I very strongly disagree with this video.
why do you never test pure hi-res music players.  Well, there are also those that are Android based, such as Sony.  Pure portable music players are considered to have better sound quality than average mobile phone
I use both Android and IOS but living in Africa I think Android is a better choice any day   Just for the availability of hardware and services, and the price also might be key   NB. Photography pixel is the better phone  by the way don't be biased
for my personal opinion Apple ecosystem suck
iPhone is noncompareable king.  Don’t compare messi with harry maguire
An apple macbook can be cheaper than iphone
Most boring video of this channel
Marques looks like he really doesn't want to be there. Not really a good colab tbh.
Sponsored By Apple 😢😏😏
Argument Finally solved! great video showing this to my brother in law thats a android fanatic...
Great collaboration! Fun to see! I respect the opinions shared but overall felt like apple sponsored video. Always thought like @mrwhosetheboss channel is with genuine/unbiased videos and whenever sponsored we get an outright disclaimer
marcus the biased when sponsored reviewer vs the brutally honest arun even when sponsored lol
mkbhd was like Q:which phone will win in pull ups?  Ans:its iphone just iphone
Note:This video is sponsored by apple😂😂
Op
it would have been much better if you choose the single best android by averages and then compare it to iPhone now when you compare it to a lot of phones all of their weakness are more apparent because of weakness in android in general and what a phone does great in one thing it adds a weakness to its other so then a phone specific weakness making the weaknesses piles up faster
Very strange video to watch. Every time you disagree with each other, the point goes to MKBHD (ehm I mean Apple).  Also very strange, you compare the best of iPhone to the average of Android. Either you compare the best with the best or your other videos (e.g. Best Phones of 2022) are flat out lies, since there you let Android win each category
There was a phone manufacturer that made phones that had a feed function so you could get the latest messages from your social accounts and so on.  I think they have shut down.  I thought they were very innovative when it came to the software itself
How does this make sense again? Or fair in what way? Very lopsided
In my opinion, I don’t like the boxed kind of shape on the samsungs
But apple IS better tho. I have never used an iphone in my life for the sheer reason that I can't afford it but I don't bark on an I phone user every time they tell me how their phone is better than mine.Infact I agree with them. I phone CREATED the smartphone industry, android is just figuring it out till today & while android may bring variety, experiment & customization in the industry the apple ecosystem being superior in every way is undeniable. They even make movies on the mac, not on windows. Says a lot.
honestly speaking if all android apps were for sale/subscriptions they would have made Android better but for now as i am using both ios n android...i would give it to apple!
Of course the best is android.
Lost me at battery award.
1:08 nice percentage
I feel this video is actually MKBHD's opinion and not a standard comparison
At the part with eco consciousness...dudes, are you out of your minds? You're literally saying that it's not a fair comparison taking a "special case" like Fairphone and Nokia, as if Android had just one brand like IOS.   This more feels like a "Samsung/Vivo/Google vs. Apple" comparison.   The nuance and the diversity factor on the android side of things is literally what makes Android different than IOS, ignoring it in a side by side comparison is like shooting in heaven and expecting a bird to drop.
Most biased review ever from MKBHD. We can see the @Mrwhosetheboss wanted to give the point to android but couldn't.
Most honest video , for me iPhone is reliable.
Android has the advantage that you can install an app that is not available on Google play.  But from what I understand, you can not install an app for iphone that is not on the Appstore.  Then you can find an Android phone with specific features that you like.  son for example a headphone output can also play hi-res also DSD
I think, giving how good both creators are, this was a pretty poor collab.
Amazing ❤️
This was so biased
Mkbhd was the worst choice to this video....clearly fan boy 🤷‍♂️🤦
iphone won more points cause i think this was a biased kind of competition. thats cause mrwhosetheboss uses iphone personally and not android which is why he chose iphone over android in many cases.
The detail, they even made it have 69 percent.
Was a big fan but u could have skipped this vedio ,u just forget to mention sponsered in your video which u promised to put .🙃
Your bias showed in this video. Lol especially on the "features" question
Apply won as eco friendly, really? You completely lost me there. This comparisons is so laughable. You completely missed the android biggest advantage and it is that the phone accessibility. to use iphone and all its features, you pretty much need to have everything from apple it is extremely closed system. While android is open one. Try getting something from or into your phone outside of the apple tools.
Android is freedom  Apple makes you a slave to their brand
At this point, you can literally see everything boils down to personal preference.
Sho, biased much. Love both your channels and watch you gents all the time, but MKBHD, this honestly seemed like you'd been paid by Apple. You worked so hard to try and undermine any really positive Android features and overhype any minor Apple features. And even when Arun disagreed, the points just went with MKBHD's opinion. Really disappointing video. A first for you guys. I've loved all your videos for years. This one didn't hit the mark
They’re mistaking value for affordability
If you were paid to do an apple review.... Be true, people will always judge....
You guys are  saying that IPHONE 'S are better than android but I have never seen mkbhd giving best phone award to IPhone
Android All The Way! Although it bores me sometimes.
i think iPhone is a good phone but it is extremely overpriced. I can get all the features in half the price in android. a phone is good for  max 2 years. i cant be spending that much money every 2 years just to show off a new iphone model. in android, i can change my phone without worrying much. currently i use oneplus phones and which has features probably iphone doesnt have.
android forever
best value could be the time of support for the device. many people forget this. Android phones end up becoming landfill quicker than any Iphone. Apple support their phones for 7 years. Samsung only support their phones with updates for 18 months
I can see the point of how apple just takes out new features later, but just better. But I personally don't like that. I love to see new features and use them as soon as possible. And by the time an iphone has that feature, there's already a new one in android. Also, I like to be able to customize my phone to the max. That means installing different uis and mods which is just not possible with iphone, and its not like android doesnt have good battery, or good screens. So android is a clear winner for me.
Never will buy an iPhone.... that's how easy my decision is.
🤡
Wonder how much mkbhd was paid by Apple here to talk up iPhone trash.
I literally just watched a video of Mark Rober with y'all 🔥👑
I would honestly say this video was wholly biased, and you can see it several times when Arun reacts with a bewildered face to the things Marques says. Marques was really reaching on some things, like the flat shape of an iphone, or the software, knowing Android is vastly more flexible with root capability. Praising things like facetime as if Android doesn't have more than one way to video chat. They gave draws to things android won easily hands down. I would say they're closer to tied as competitors. Not knocking either one, but the bias was egregiously bad on Marques's part here. The vast landslide in points that he painted iPhone as having simply does not exist at all. How is iPhone eco friendly when they lobby to block all legislation for Right to Repair? Undeniably laughable. They really didn't think this video through. For a tech reviewer this exposed marques as completely oblivious and destroys his credibility all together.
If you care about your social image, Iphone. If you care about functionality and performance, Samsung
Nothing  But paid promotion wins 🤣
Let's fix this.  Screen: Android wins hands down no debate.
how did iphone win by 5 i agree that if you buy the top end model of the iphone its better then andorind but it shouldnt be a five point difrence
In my perspective ANDROID smartphones are like a swiss knife, you can explore a lot different good features and have fun playing with them, on the IOS Apple phones side you have a great comunication device that was built for your social life but you are stuck in that system.
Blatantly bias lmao
According to a Swedish technology website called M3, the Xiaomi 12 Pro is the fastest Android phone in 2022
Best Youtubers in the World
Love MB from Malaysia 🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾
Why Samsung vs IOS? Samsung doesn't do everything the best IMO but I agree IOS is best for those who just want to use their phones without thinking too much. For innovation Android OEMs lead the way. If IOS could be used in other hardware Apple wouldn't be the best OEM. Just my thoughts.
This video was sponsored by ios😂
I drink food and eat water
its better for you and marques but not for other majority
I think there's a wrong in this video
how is the screan a drew
Out of topic: seeing you guys work together feels great, I’ve been a fan way longer than I ever learn how subs work lol. Godspeed to you guys
You guys gave the iPhone the win for software support saying it gives, 5 years of support. I will you to pick up a 5 year old iPhone, put the latest software and see how it performs... If its not an utter piece of garbage, you can take it up with me. I had to use an iPhone once (not by choice) which was a hand me down (basically it was sitting in a cupboard for a year before i used it) and oh boy it got so much worse as the time passed by... The more new updates i installed the shittier it got.  I agree that Android wont give us 5 years but technically speaking, the performance would have changed soooo much in 5 years that i would not make sense to keep using the same phone. If all these new chips each year offer 20% more performance, in 5 years the performance difference comes around 2.5x times. Do you really think that they can offer a new OS version keeping in mind for the 2.5x slower phones? Hell no.
i got scammed i thought it was you
This is just a US audiance focused video. If u r out of us u can ignore it.
RIP etika
LOL Android is best 😂
No, champs, just no. Lol
If i see this type of content again from either of them i will unfollow them
Honestly i didnt expect this type of bias content from either of these two . Shameful what you choose to do when u become famous
Have we really reached a plateau? There is always room for improvement and we have seen how the fast paced evolution of tech has kept up with this.🤔
👍🇪🇺🇩🇪
hehe nice video personally both are great but i would stick with android for the affordability and tonnes of choices,i do wait till the latest iphone gets 2-3 or 4 years old then pick one used for cheap!
The fact that I got a Samsung ad the moment android got a point 💀🤣 Edit: I got a Google pixel ad lmao. I'm waiting for iphone
Can you talk about 3D printers?thar really interesting 🧐 to rang.
BROOO LEZ GOO, IPHONE EZ WIN, SAMSUNG IS BULLSHIT
Everyone said android is weak but 80 percent of people use android???
Mr whosetheboss A big fan from Nigeria.. your video is trending#42 in my country
And once again a completely biased video. Points were given to iPhones merely because they "prefer" Apple over android lol wtf
Arun i like to bring a notice to u, someone is doing scams in ur account in the comment section by representing u as a profile pic
Yeah this is more biased choice due to personal preferences as those who live outside US dont really use facetime and suchs. However, it is their choice.
Android is better
Who else is watching during exams season 😔😅
For me, this is not very objective. Because this video is used by two Apple users and one of them is Apple fanboy. For me Samsungs are better in design, camera and I love open source operating system.
In paid partnership with Apple 😆
I love it when you work together.
I'll buy iPhone only when it comes with USB-C port. Till then I'm sticking with Android Phones.

There is a huge difference in "objectively better" and "convenient for the majority."
Idc for iPhone android for life
fun fact : this video's length is 20:22 (2022)
MKH is literally an apple ambassador at this point how was this ever going to be non biased lol...
With Marques's opinion, this video turns into a dumb review.  Marques is like your average dumb consumer and Aaron is like your intellectual consumer. The video content is "*Android vs iPhone - Which is ACTUALLY Better*?", but Marques's opinions are all self-centered. Aaron and his Editor should title this as "*Which is better for Marques? Android Made or Apple Products*".
I dont know a single person who doesnt think that devices are 99.99% about performance, resolution and refresh rate.
2 iSheeps here talking.... You can't even guess who's gonna win.
Me being a person who knows how to use a phone and can extract maximum outa it like mod apks, free stuff n things, so ill take android all day long, iphone just dosent come in close, but i too accept the fact that for an average user, iphone is just better!
I just feel like you guys sat down to support iPhone through and through.  I'm an iPhone 13 pro max user but I'm way more impressed by the galaxy S22 Ultra  to it.
Loved the video. Well done. On iPhone for a few years now and before always an Android user. What I miss the most (literally) is notifications on iphone. The way android handles notifications is way better. Additionally, lack of always on display on iOS is annoying. These 2 were big enough for me to buy an s22 ultra now that I can get it so much cheaper than I would an iphone 14 pro.
Iphone might have had a headstart, but Android is a lot better than ios or iphones nowadays
MKHBD and  arun both soft spoken 😊  love the comparisons no one's aggressive. they listen to each other
I guess both of you had a great drinks or shots after the vlog.
Omg u can't say that the S22 Ultra screen is a bit better, it's miles better iMarqueesSheep.
People who hate on iphone doesn't have the money to buy it
iPhones will always be better at performance they are exactly like consoles, a closed ecosystem with everything tailor optimized for a specific processor so you can never go wrong, unlike Android phone is like windows, it's broad, performance is based on how much money you spend
Unbiased review is a myth.Loosing faith in MKBHD as an independent tech reviewer 💔
The way of presentation was damm perfect but  throughout the content it absolutely felt supporting iphone on all basis. in case of customization jst admitting iphone z the bst . This is wrong nd feel so bad from the point of view of  best techies f the Mobile Market . Too disappointed one
BRUH I THINK THIS COMPARISON IS SO BAD CUZ YOU BOTH LOVE IPHONE NOT ANDROID THAT MUCH
Seems like Apple products are idea for ppl who want something simple to use. Still took my mom about a month to figure out the basic feature. Now 10 years later and I still get questions. I use an android, so I have to figure it out on her phone first then explain it to her how to do did. she cant just play with it till she figures out the issue.
The thing that sets any android apart, though specifically Samsung, for me is the ecosystem. I'm a student, every college/university I've ever been to uses Windows. I use the google drive system and the transition from Drive to Microsoft is seamless. Likewise, I use the Adobe suite. Now, I use to be more media-intensive but switching my studies to stem meant I use them less, but for various reasons, I do still use them. Using Adobe on a mac is an expensive way to access an already expensive suite. As a student, I was also able to get into the Samsung ecosystem for dirt cheap. I got my Galaxy Tab S7, new from Samsung for £400, and I didn't need to spend £90 on the pencil. My S21 was £580. These are just deals that Apple has never been able to compete with, and if I'm in a bad place with money (as students often can be), if any of these devices break; the Samsungs warranty is far more forgiving AND there are cheaper alternatives to keep me afloat, that exist in the same ecosystem, I could buy a £300 phone, and still have access to EVERYTHING, all it would take is me signing into my Samsung account. Google Home and the associated devices working with Google assistant natively is just a plus. Then there is the fact I have had to help my father on occasion with his iPad, in general, I find the UI to be unintuitive. Buttons in apps with functions I expect them to have, don't have them. The number of times I've struggled to move a file into an email, or just tried to print. And if I had a Macbook, I wouldn't be able to do half of my hobbies like Astrophotography. So I guess this opinion stems from a very unique case, but as a STEM student, in college, Apple as a whole is best avoided, the cost to performance is just not worth it. That and also, a notch after 2019 is a sin. I know this was a Phone vs Phone debate, but we live in a world of tech. If you're like me, your phone often lends itself to an ecosystem.
THE COLLAB IVE BEEN  WAITING FOR
Android is best  Screen : Android Performance : Apple Photo : draw (Samsung's photos are good) Video : draw (depends on brand 8k video is nice Xiaomi prob have best video on flagships ) Software features : Android (freedom , emulator , APK , live wallpapers ,launchers usb c , choice) Sustainability : draw  (average Apple phone is more sustainable but there are niche phones) Software support : draw both are pretty good app support on Android is on a different level  Software reliability : Android (lack of usb c) Battery : draw ( depends on age of phone iOS has more battery glitches) Price : Android (some Samsung A series phones are trash and are better off buying older flagship or older higher a series like A70 ; A80) Android 6.5 : Apple 3.5 is a fair score
Are promot iphone then what the f****
Yeah, yeah, android will always be cheated. Not surprised.
MKBHD is iphone biased.
MKBHD has always been a big fan of the IPhone, I watched most of his review videos upto a point I thought he was an Apple Agent on YouTube
iPhone vs Android is an impossible comparison, I think. Maybe iOS vs Android or iPhone flagship vs Samsung flagship makes more sense.
Here we go again, an Operating System Vs a whole Phone lol
Why do youtubers forget that Android is defragment and that comparing Android updates with iOS is like comparing apple and oranges, 90% of what you get in a new iOS update, Android does it directly from system app updates through play store, now even core system functionalities.
I will give 0.5-0.5 in Gaming to both
Marques looks so relaxed here. Almost like "hey Arun, it's your video, you do the talking!'😅
Marques has become more diplomatic over time. He doesn't make definite choices often.  Arun has always made choices taken sides, been decisive.  There are Pros and cons of both styles. I follow both and it's an observation over multiple videos
Customization , reverse charging , always On screen , fast charging , budgetary phones for all , price , 144Hz , 100X Zoom , camera pixel and a lot .. Iphone is still a kid .. Android is the king !! You too seemed so biased here .. lost a sub
The android market is a vast field, it's better to take one Android device vs One Iphone
Lol. They’re just phones.
Such a stupid video.
MKBHD was a iphone simp
Wow, haven't watched mkbhd for years and now he switched to team iphone lol he used to be the biggest google fan
So to break it down android has a  better screen but iPhone still wins A better camera but iPhone still wins  Good battery and really good charging but the iPhone still wins (but to be fair the iPhones batterie is really good)
You mist the biggest difference and that  is iTunes jail or be free with android
I'm watching to see who's arm movements are the most flamboyant.
This collab!
Me with a windows Phone *Ah...yes yes
I think it’s a personal choice not a matter of which is better.  If you’re living in the US then I guess you would find Apple suits you better. If not, and you’re not in the Apple eco system and happen to like customisation then you would probably opt for Android. Both systems are good.
The most annoying thing in ios, is that we can't set a different volume level between ringtones and alarm!  Come on apple...
MkBHD>>>>>>APPLE 🤮🤮🤮🤮
It just felt like you wanted apple to win so bad. 😂
the iphone meat ridin is crazy
Nah, it was basically clear idiocy there, no offense.  iPhone isn;t the best at photos, but I'll  choose iPhone.  iPhone literally uses the least recyclable materials and packaging, and is the most anti-repais, but because they market their Eco-Friendliness, it wins.  iPhone sucks at features and is basically a few generations behind, lets call it a draw. iPhones have no options, and cost quite high, Android clearly has more options that can get better value, let's call it a draw... oh wait cut cut.
I just can't live without split screen. It is the one feature in Android that I use the most.
I never understands this comparison It is like comparing The Avengers with John wick 😒
bias ass video
Let's all give the video a thumbs down so he would realize and do something about this video
MKBHD mf needs to stop sucking off apple 😂😂😂
HMM clear as mud its just personal choice. I would like to see if this was done in s different country.
The perfect breakfast watching these guys on my s21 ultra. Could as well be an iphone but just love the zoom camera and screen
@Mrwhosetheboss You have to take this video down because I can't understand why MKBHD is being biased towards Apple products...    Every question he is like  Apple Apple Apple  Apple Apple Apple  Apple  Why what the fuck is wrong with him, he doesn't even use the s22ulta wtf and you are a tech savvy?
13:35 what Arun thinks?
Please read my comment There is a feature missing in I phone and I need it so much I have been using I phone 13 pro max for nearly 6 monts and that feature present in android but not in ios and I missed it so much  It’s that suppose that u are on a call and u are also watching a video on u tube u can handle both voices differently  Another example  U r playing a game and have played a song in background now u need less voice of game and more of that song so u can’t manage them differently  In android u can do that, there are different slots for different sounds like call sound music sounds or the 3rd app u are using and u manage all of them differently but in I phone I just couldn’t find that
@Marques Brownlee
I stopped watching when they said android had more features than iPhone yet, they gave the points to iPhone. Come on. Everything iphone does, android can do and does do. Imessage is nothing special other than the fact that everyone under 25 has an iPhone. That is not special, its convenient. Every feature of imessage can be done on android. I have a Samsung phone and when text somebody with a Sony phone.....I can see when they read it. Ohhh..but Iphone users can only do this with other iphones so let's give iphone the point. Yea, sorry guys but that is silly. 🤧
@Mrwhosetheboss please read and check your latest comments being released, this video wasn't fair
@Mrwhoistheboss Arun you are being biased by being following what MKBHD says, because he is an apple fun, he keeps talking about apple and agreeing whatever he says...I hate that shit, android is still the best, if apple was the best will they still be using android parts, they should come up with their own shit, no android company buys any parts from apple but apple buys screens and other parts from Samsung to make their products better, Xiomi Samsung and Pixel are better and ahead of apple...maybe in the video you were scared of speaking your mind...
I disagree
More like MKHBD tells us he likes iPhone.
So basically android is better but the iPhone still wins? Wtf
Arun is being biased by being following what MKBHD says, because he is an apple fun, he keeps talking about apple and agreeing whatever he says...I hate that shit, android is still the best, if apple was the best will they still be using android parts, they should come up with their own shit, no android company buys any parts from apple but apple buys screens and other parts from Samsung to make their products better, Xiomi Samsung and Pixel are better and ahead of apple...
I think the comparisons should have been with Google's lineups and apples
MKBHD has always had a biased opinion towards Apple products. This is known.
Biased video
At battery life the lphone should never win. You are now biased
Me judging iOS Android flagships on my cheap oppo phone 😂
I agree with many of the points. iPhone has always focus on user experience aka normal consumer vs Android where it has been everything the cheap phone, the Nexus developer phone the droid, the flagship killer, The Galaxy. As for iPhone the 1st gen was very behind compared to a Nokia N-Series. No wifi no 3g no front facing camera, No multi-tasking, no video recording. Where Apple won was iTunes and the touchscreen with no stylus. Me personally I love phones so being stuck to the Apple eco-system and looking at everyone with the same phone makes me gag a bit. I personally think Android has the best phones. Apple has the best Tablets and Wearables (unmatched) and computers really is up to the user.
I wanted to get an iPhone to switch it up a bit, then i remembered it has lightning...
There's a reason why FOX News hosts invites CNN correspondents, and vise versa, for a sensitive debate. Android Vs iPhone debate is a strong and sensitive one, you should have included a hardcore Android User in your debate as both of you are MORE into iPhones. Do things well because millions see it. This was very unscientific and hurried.
Am I the only person who thinks MKBHD is biased towards iPhone🙄😐
An Apple fanboy will never admit android being better at something over iphone. Thats just how things are.
don't like the comment about sports: "Most boring team to watch is the best", because it's completely not true
i feels like it concluded in a wrong way
MKBHD has always been an apple fanboy, he is not a neutral judge.
i switched to apple bc of u😂🫠
So, iPhone better than Android ? , I have S21U5G I'm planning to buy a phone next year which one u think is better option S23U or iPhone 14pro Max?
Looking at the arguments, questions and the result score - I can only wonder how much did Apple pay you to do this?
Cmon MKBHD..give android a break!
if i would have such a famous channel as you have i woud collaborate with a youtuber who's not known at all. there are so many people who have the same passion and drive but just don't get a chance these days. instead of doing this i would DEFINITELY make videos with them
Us: T-Shirt Arun: Phone wipe
Apple fan boy MKBHD
* If you are genuinely concerned about the planet, buy the best phone you can and take care of it so it lasts as long as possible. That saves the most resources. You cannot ever be too sure about the health of a used phone, what has been done to it, if it´s not a very recent model. If you want used, seek if there is a store that sells phones in their outlet with a discount, that have come there after being returned within sth like their own 30day return policy - They can be be like new and have almost full warranty for if anything goes wrong. Got my iPhone 13 pro max 128gb for $964 from an outlet like that (there were extra -20% sales) a few months back and I'm planning to stick like 5 years with this! :)
Good thing they are not biased to android 😁 FPS,crisp display, night cam,battery, Performance go for 🍎
Android is More Open, More Variation of Device, Hardware and Software
Sure...android is better👍💖
can I try a 13 pro i havent had a chance so if so get in contact

iPhone on screen? From there, the comparison loses all objectivity.
Android wins in the value category but loses overall categories. I think it was a roughly fair comparison but there's some little things that was slightly better that makes it take the win with a lotta points but in our lives I think the best way value and pricing is a very important factor. I can understand the intentions of this video but the overall score is not really an accurate result
I'm curious that  is this a paid show by apple?
This is Biased.
iphone won the trophy but android won the people's heart ❤
How much did they offer you at the apple event?
For a change I dislike this video and strongly disagree with outcome. And that almost never happens with your videos. There shouldn't be draws as well, display, camera all of which is clearly android. Everything should have the right reference and value as basis while being evaluated / compared - and here it was individual feelings that overshadowed any scientific process..
Android is not the best.must is problem.make to damaged by new one.must telephone makes in china pieced of garbage..why don’t makes in America.make the cloth shoes.the bests umbrella makes in Canada
I guess Iphone sales are down these days? 😂😂 that would explain this video...
The iPhone is better because Apple has full control over the ecosystem. However this comparison is too one sided even though the iPhone is the overall better phone.
Nice collab with iphone
You blow my mind with your level of technical knowledge and your unique viewpoint of technology big thumbs up to you my brother.
Fun video, good to see you guys get together, but you completely forgot to mention privacy -- which iphone also seems to take the cake on.
Great combo!
where is the outro :(
This really sounds like a long apple promo..
💜💜
I watch all your videos, big fan of your work but this is the worst video I've seen.  You can't compare a phone with an operating system. This doesn't make any sense. Do IOS VS Android. That's fine. Do top iPhone Vs top Samsung phone.  That's fine. But comparing a single iPhone against the whole android market and then picking and choosing which android you want to compare with is idiotic. Had to turn this off half way through which I've never done on a mrwhostheboss video before.
Feels like more of an interview with an apple fan boy
Thats more like an American perspective of Android vs iPhone.
Ii am surprised
Super paid review this seemed like this  Iphone is good but u rate it over s22 ultra or 6 pro pixel is unreal  Stopped watching this video after first 5-6 mns
This is so not true  Android is better than iphone MKBHD is an apple supporter
dude you just agreed with everything he said about iPhones when you know he is an iPhone fan.🤓 anyway that’s just his opinion. For me, it all boils down to what you want in a smartphone. For me I go all android because of the features which am always excited to test. Apple is well aware that their smartphones are boring, so they make apps like FaceTime, iMessage etc just to lock  🔐 you in. Whereas there are other better alternatives.
Wow got money selling apples. Try orange 4 a change
I can't agree with it
I repfer Android -- but I am still an Apple user. And because I have an Apple ecosystem, the iPhone makes more sense (somewhat unfortunately)
**Sees title** **Grabs popcorn** **Goes straight to the comments**
I think mkbhd was saying everything good about an iphone and hiding the good in android because never once did they consider developer options or customizability
iOS
This video is fundamentally wrong. IPhone is a phone android is OS, we all know that. It should be IOS vs Android, because even in the beginning you should events of IOS & android.  Guys I love all your content, but not expected such a video. It was mostly again IPhone vs Samsung.
No one never say, It's a paid promotion 🤣🤣🤣
But the whole world is using Android even though it doesn't use many features
It was all mkbhd tbh. We dont need that, Arun where was your opinion?
Say about iPhone restrictions.🤣
Dude look you guys couls compare all day you want with photography on iPhone over Samsung that might be true but look when you talk about software it hassssss to be Samsung idk why but I just don't buy another phone other than Samsung only based on the software like the new features and customization they Give like every 4.1 4.2 that feels so incredible
Repairability is not considered? Hmmm 🤔
some points are accurate but cannot agree with all in Android we can install 3rd party apps without playstore and I a hardcore user for hardcore user Android is farrrrr better than Android
Biased !!!!!! Totally biased !!!!!
What an awful, awful comparison. Good grief.
Tbh I don't agree one bit with the results
did he just call nokia french, xd 9:40
After all everything comes to pricing and i have to go to Android because of that, not all Arun can afford iPhone 13 😂
This just bias actually
This just bias actually
I guess you guys are comparing hardwares of devices rather than the operating systems.. Since Android and iOS are operating systems, your comparison should be more focused on human interface experience..
I highly and respectfully disagree on the features section.  Every thing you can do on an Iphone you can also do on an android with alternative apps. This does not go the other way around. iPhone users like simple and are too stubborn to look at alternatives.
This feels like Mkbhd makes an argument, and arun just agrees with it. He looks like asucker for debates. To me this felt totally biased towards one's opinion
I think this video is joke  i didnt even watch after they said iphone has a better batter i mean what lolf joke of the sentury
@morschuss
You say you have your iphone 13 on 24hours  time and you have 20% battery left i have samsung s22 ultra and my battery holding 120hours total 5days with maximum brightness I test my wife iphone 13 pro max and only holding maximum 24hours not more so that is total wrong with batterytime.
I think it's Samsung because I have seen that its strong er
Is Xiaomi available to buy in the US/UK?  The Mi11 Ultra should be the comparison with the iPhone and would take the points in the screen, battery and camera categories but it seems to be ignored on youtube. Even after Arun said it was better than the S21 in all categories.
Maybe I am wrong but this seems like biased
Apple introduced the smart phone to the world and they fell behind hard. Android is far superior to iOS and the pixel is leagues better than the iPhone. iPhones are archaic and garbage. It’s shockingly inferior. Sorry not sorry
Nice apple biased opinion from MKBHD. apple fan boy all day long.
It’s obvious your friend is an iPhone lover don’t use him nest time
Is this video recorded before the weight loss commitment?
The celilar signal is the worst on iphone! I have used 200$ android phones and had better celular signal than my 13 pro max
So  split screen only matters to some people.
Are you an ambassador of iphone or have you been sponsored by the iphone.  Anyway shame on you. 😠😠😠
Still, this doesn't decide which is better, I would disagree with a lot of their points. Photography definitely goes to android, also there's a lot of more categories in which android would win that aren't put here. I would still choose android over iPhone everyday. But I understand why someone would want an iPhone rather than android
Marques is an apple fanboy and you allowed his opinion to override yours when you didn't agree and still gave the point to Apple! 🤷🏿‍♂️
Marketing lvl🤨
This guy loves iphone so he gives it every point lol such a trash comparison
This is bullshit iphone follows the samsung update. Remember samsung produces screens to iphone.  Apple have nothing to produce to others
The best video so far
fan bois videos are like.. 💩
Mkhb is just giving it all to iphone. He does not give a fair review. That is why I only watch Arun. He's fair does't matter what the phone is. Mkhb is just and apple fanboy that does not like samsung or even andriod.
Use me as dislike❗️
Bro, your videos are good But I like your editing and content
Dawg just bought the iphone yesterday it better win 😭
What the hell mahn..👎
So bad, it felt more like interview of Mkbhd who btw seemed so biased about iphone, pfff
the sound is crisp
iphone is unix(dos) android is linux(dos) ++.  Iphone the commands are done for you.  The software and the apps are bridged.  Credit to ATTnPBell for the unix code.  Android as such YOUR the end user not Apple.  This comparison is useless considering majority of the parts for iphone are Samsung LG Leevo Sony etc.    If your iphone is not cracked its not an iphone.
Idk, but this video feel kinda bias to me 🌝
I Wonder when Mrwhosetheboss say i have 20% battery after 24hours and I compare my s22 ultra I have my battery holding 5days and brightness level maximum! and iphone e have better battery? Answer is NO! And they dont use zoom at all i use that all the time and I do the test of my s22 120hours vs iphone 13 pro max and the iphone holding 24hour after that battery dead.  And the videorecording samsung its big diffrents videorec. With iphone so mutch pixel lost and in samsung s22 so clear and when you zoom in on the both phones when you looking on the video so take samsung the leed. Same like the frontkamera photoshoot in dark samsung take great pic and iphone I test was no pictures i need to swith on the light to take pictures i fel way have nightshot on iphone if its no working same with the frontcamera.
All people in developing world or 3rd world countries don't have enough money to buy iphone so. Anyone which brought smartphones to every consumer is Android..  Also Android many features like fast charging, refresh rate,  crazy features,  App and file sharing.., without any device limitations also  When arun mentioned iphone se(crap that apple launched to I don't know be in budget category 🤮) mkbhd kinda supported it.......WTFFFFFFFF......!!!!!!!  I think mkbhd didn't play fare... But shout to our bro arun he kinda let him do his..  .. Personal opinion...,....!!!!!!!!
You guys are generalizing every android phone.  Rather say iPhone vs Samsung.. iPhone is only iOS and it's only iPhone. Android is so many other brands besides Samsung
I totally agree with Marques with the quote "the most boring team to watch is often the best one"
Super one sided outcome. Android is so much better then iOS, but as it's the path less traveled, people hesitate to recommend. Step out of the West and Europe, and it's Android all the way. After all it's has the best value and feature set money can buy. Case In Point: At Any Budget.
Feels like I just watched an Apple sponsored video on "Android vs iOS"
2 legends collaborating is a phenomenal entertainment ❤️
Sponsored by apple🤌😑
The resolution of this video is better than my eye sight
I hate it when Mkbhd (or "Americans") talk and think like they are only the ones who live on this earth, there are no people living outside the US.  Iphones are only better in US. Everyplace out side US, Android is better and most widely used. So if you  are talking about most people used features it would be Android only the winner. Clearly there are more number of people outside US versus people inside US.
Your vids are absolute quality. Love them!
This just doesn't feel right....
Hey don’t talk about iPhone 😢
Android has a real file system, no need for iTunes to transfer music.  Android has much better spam call and spam text blocking & handling.
I think it was a bit unfair this comparison. I almost changed to iPhone this year because I love how smooth the experience is while using it. Personally I need more power on a phone, also having more options with file management and taking pictures RAW, so I bought a Samsung s22 Ultra and I freaking love it, is amazing. On the other hand video is way better on an iPhone tho.   However things like iMessage, facetime, etc, the ecosystem of Apple. No one uses iMessage outside of USA... Even facetime. Here in my country people buy iPhone just for aesthetic or say "look I'm fancy".   I feel like this would be more like a draw since both Android and iPhone are getting closer to each other every single day.
Ivane eduth valla thottilum kalayadey nthuva ee paryune
I'd go with android they have better battery it's not too expensive (guess I'm looking at you apple) android has more Customabillity and easy to use
I will only move to Apple once it supports USB C. All my other devices use this and I don't want to go back in the past of having to carry multiple types of cables
20sec Vivo X80 ad *_*
This is literally Mrwhosetheboss interviewing Mkbhd. Practically no input from Mr wtb
Both of them are the best!! More of this please!!
You couldn't even bring yourselves to give the display point to Samsung? The iPhone display supplier? Fanboy status. They fear Apple reprimanding them or something!
Honestly speaking guys, this felt kinda like injustice to Android. Many comparisons you guys made are flawed.
I think it's an apple promotion video😒
This was totally biased against Android. If iPhone is this good why isn't it winning MKBHD phone of the year award? 🙄
This comparison looks bias. It should have been a brand to brand comparison. For example Samsung vs. iPhone. Taking  the strength of abrand against the weaknesses of the many doesn't make sense
Look this is completely biased by where you guys live. like in US lots of people go straight to iPhones bc for many years 70% of people around them had an iphone and face time or imessage is a thing there. but in east these options are meaningless. apple ecosystem is not a Global thing. Most apps on android is useable on IOS too so you dont need to worry about "oh my buddy might not have access to imessge or facetime or anything else" you can be sure you will not get into platform problems in android. also if someday apple stop supports a country for any nasty reasons you dont need to wory about it on android! thats what i mean this reviews all biased by someone in a specific location and the world is not just USA and Europian countries, China, Korea or even middle east countries they are more marketplace than you considered!
Comparing the best iPhones against all android phones is probably not fair. You would have gone with best iPhone against best android phone.
Mk just stick to iphone without much  in details why it's better than... We all know iPhone is overrated like vintage cars. People buy cause of the brand but in terms of innovation and durability android won in many ways
Bro android is always better brother no bargains
The iPhone 13 Pro Max is a mf beast I’ve had it since December and it’s way better than any other iPhone because of the battery and new display
So I noticed that @ 20:09 Marques was actually expecting a fist bump 🤜🏻🤛🏻 AFTER the vertical palm clap but he immediately pulled back and retracted his hand when he noticed that that wasn’t happening from Arun.   It’s cultural differences like this that I appreciate within crossovers of content creators. Such dynamism.
This is really shocking...ratings could have been better on the Android side. This collab seems like a biased one, but Arun was trying to go with Android phones sometimes which is really appreciated.
why is Arun asksing Keith questions he already has the answers to
2 apple lovers decided iOS is better
Iphone users vs Android admins 😊
Eco goes to apple? Who swam the sea with all this lighting stuff...? So unfair... And also never ask an American about Android...smh
This is why you can't choose these. Its ultimately down to preference. If you put an Apple fanboy in a room with Smartphone reviewer who see's both the good and the bad. Apple will clearly win. For me, it's not so clear cut. There can be no winner between these flagships as they are both great in their own rights.
The fact is that, over 50% or even more of iphone users buy iphone because "it's an iphone".. they don't know shit about technical stuff or even how to use the features.Lidar 3D scanning,advanced videography and more..most just use those advanced devices just for calls,facetime,Snapchat,mirror selfies.They just want the highest end,newest iphone and bragging rights...
To be honest, it feels it's just like interviewing a apple fan.
Accidentally pressed Siri and says call me now.ahhahaha
Shit and biased
How was Siri vs google assistant a draw?
I like both of you guys but you're also pro iPhone so this one is kind of a miss for me
1:08 why is the battery percentage 69%
One thing is sure that MKBHD is surely an apple fan boy. Imao i disagree with some of his points related to Battery & Fast Charging, Android customization features, Photography & display.
iPhone vs Android - An iphone's fanboy edition. This should be the title of the video
MKBHD does not know enough about android phones specialties to judge android so harshly. For example, he barely knows about Vivo X series
worst thing after the "your health'' clickbait
Android any day... Iphone is just money loosing machine... I switched on android from iPhone and I am glad I did...
Android. Also, get rid of Escobar Boy.  What a sub human.
Ngl, this video felt very wrong. There seems to be a lot of bias towards Apple and I hope I'm not the only who's seeing this
Guys, for those of you saying this is very opinion based, that's the point. They're two users discussing their opinions based on their years of experience. It's going to be almost entirely personal opinion based. Also they're both using the 13 Pro max as their daily drivers. So they've already made up their mind as to what they personally consider the best.
Android wins 3000times
It blows mymind that they say they don't use the Samsung multi-tasking features cos I personally find the little notification bubbles that pop up and open a little window without you leaving what you're doing indispensable. I love that I can quickly reply a message while seeing the messages screen without leaving what I'm doing. It's great.
MKBHD is obviously being so biased and it even suprises Aaron
This is the first time I have actually thought the guys have done a bad review. I'm not technical at all but this review was just too one sided.
Thought the comparison would be between Ios and Android systems, it ended up being between the IPhone (an excellent phone) as hardware, against the other Android phones. Pity.
You already gave the victory to ios before the show began. Pick a phone vs a phone or an operating system vs another not iPhone vs all off android phones cos technically if you do that then apple stands no chance. This felt lake MK's opinion and you accepting them even though you have shown in your videos over and over factual and data driven results from time to time. In balanced assessment.
Android RIP😂😂
This video is sponsored by apple
Apple is still so limited to what you can do. You can do what they want you to do and that's it.
Do a Mac vs PC!!!
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Awesome video. I love the “subscribe if you did”. Very in-line with the whole video.  Straightforward, easy too understand and direct.have fun in California. If your trAveling more through the states and find yourself in the Dakar area, say hello.  I’d be honored to take you to lunch or something. Maybe we can even find the Rick Astey diner ❤️❤️
clearly all the down votes are Android fanboys
Geeks talking Geeky things, ❤️d it
I think this was a very biased comparison based on their personal preferences.. extremely disappointed with this video.. 😶
😂😂😂idk but after watching the boys I feel this guys work for vought
i have iphone 13 but i dont have ios 16
Mentioning in the software category airdrop as a edge twards apple in my opinion is just wrong. Apple decided to remove bluetooth features to be used to share data to sell air drop as a solution this is just so increadible stupid. Creating a Problem and than create a solution is not good engineering ....
this is like comparing some random lenovo laptop to a macbook, the macbook wins and then that means macs are better then every single pc
Android?   That is free, and hardware is not.   What a joke?  Why buy Samsung?  Just buy any android cheap phone if android is key feature.
It should be ANDROID vs iOS...or S22 Ultra VS iPhone
Now do samsung vs apple
this should've been called iPhone vs Samsung
Should have been IOS vs Android  or IPhones  vs Samsung, pixel etc... IPhone vs Android doesn't seems to make alot of sense
After this video Android companies 📉↘️
that was really weird video i feel like just after they explained why android is better they chose iphone ?!
How does the s22 get a draw with iPhone screen, that is was the easiest win for s22 wtf.
Was this video about Android vs apple or just killing the Android image 😂
Did you just talk about Google assistant vs Siri and choose google as the winner but give no points?
Regardless of which is actually better this is not a proper review this is strait up biased for iphone users
Is this an apple commercial? Even though Android have 150 w fast charging still apple wins I can't belive this video
The only multitasking feature I’d say my iPhone needs is YouTube pip; I think YouTube premium might have it? But I think google bank did bringing it for all users. And I would say the back and forth gesture for switching between open apps is better in iOS. Also, I just really love how apple made better battery life with 120hz while on android it has always tanked the battery. Automatic night mode and easy macro mode is also done well in iOS
Mbhd is a biased iphone fanatic,,loool! This is why flossy carter is the best reviewer,, he jus splits pire facts and not just fanboying
This feels really dumb. You're comparing the average of hundreds of phones at all different price brackets to one company with the most expensive flagship
Short comment, S22 ultra is hero.
These are just his opinions nothing else
Nice to see android absolutely demolished😂😂
It looks like Apple's sponsored video......😱😱
I like how MKBHD was going for a fist bump after the handshake but had to put it away awkwardly lol
Marques has been made an Apple ambassador just like anyone else who has significant influence on consumers as well as wireless carriers in the US. Apple is holding Americans hostage!
Don't you mean Android vs iOS?
Android still better>
This is big insult to Android community... Promotion video for apple...
I don't know, but I thought I would give a bit more points to Android...
Amazing video from the best YouTubers. Much love from Uganda 🇺🇬  Nothing beats the IPhone 📱
omg true tone... I love it you forgot to mention it at the beginning
In current times with the increasing importance for security, privacy, etc. Think this should also be a main point of comparison.
It's funny how these tech reviewers consider customization as only wallpaper, widgets and this kinda stuff when its so more more.. Heck iPhone can't even do that properly try changing icons for a change.. But I guess Marques doesn't do that so it's not useful at all either 😂
Not letting apple take any hits there Marcus. Can they do no wrong for you lol...🤣😂
Apple sucks
Honestly I don't really care of the whole apple VS android I just use my phone for texting and gaming, mainly gaming
I think Apple marketing is awesome.Just a thing when some subpar product (iphone) is compared here and come at top is their triumph.Imagine their product under some other logo and think how much negative review it would recive.
Sponsored by Apple
Theres facetime on android except android can only ft android and iphone can only ft another iphone Theres airdrop on android but they can only do it with android and iPhones can only do it with iphones Charging goes to android especially with usb-c
So 2021 best mobile Apple ?  MKHBF you cheated your followers.
Mkbhd how much you received from Apple company ?
IPhone introduce two new "products" 🙄 sry "promoters" 😁in this video.
Worst rating ever
Mkbhd favers iphone
These two are iphone fanboyz,it's not a shock 😲 android is 2nd to non
blind iSheep
Android fanboys in the comments seething
Best I phone ad I have ever seen..Great work guys
For photos that's a big lie, S22 ultra is the way to go
As an owner of iPhones for years now I can't see how anyone in their right mind would prefer the feel of the new square edge shape since iPhone 12?!! It feel absolutely awful in the hand and slips around all over the place. Most of that is alleviated with a case but the fact still stands.
MKBHD talk android for some as there is only America in the world 😂 bro get out.. Android is used but more than iPhone and we prefer those features rather than getting locked with Samsung.. And stop bringing everything in favor of iPhone "somehow" coz it simply shows you're partial towards it
I am big fan of your reviews. Can you please review google Chrome book lenovo due 5. Tablet?  Thank you 😊
Great vid! Thanks lads
dude too many ads!
Where is Windows Phone?
Android is great if you want to get a virus, the google play store is straight up garbage.
I know apple creates the best phone overall, however, I prefer the freedom to choose any type of phone I want and not afraid of trouble shooting my own phone. If I had to recommend a phone to someone who is not tech savvy, then iPhone all the way.
Come on man don't encourage apple to take away the cable too!
It feels like we had two very obvious iPhone fanboys here. The lead up to the video showing MKBHD holding an Android logo and the other fella holding an iPhone made it seem like this would be a lot more balanced. I mean, y'all both just completely shat on Android, and now I have to question whether any review videos y'all do on Androids are worth considering seriously. You've both damaged your respective reputations, perhaps beyond repair.
With MKBHD i never even thought android would win.. He always prefers an iPhone and somehow gives you pros in favor of iPhone and cons against Android no matter what. You on the other hand think logically and and how it actually performs vs "i can trust iPhone in this or that environment".. Its not about trust its about how well each feature performs
The android famboys in the comment salty af lmfao.
no talk about repairability of your own device whit out any error message or security not working? And usb c for data transfer of your 4k pro res.
People from the US will always choose iPhones over Android
Camera quality of iPhone is better till 3x zoom because Apple does not focus on zoom  Apple camera is clear
Android will win million times.. Apple total sucks..
Apple payroll. That is all. iPhone users are quite deluded. They say android features are not that important until Apple copy's them. Then they are so important.
Not hating but im pretty sure Samsung isnt the only smartphone company using android?
Android is best
Sir I'm your fan. Can I ask you a question,  whether MKBHD is getting paid for promoting iPhone? All phones are good. Chineese phones are also  good? But Data Privacy and Protection is uncertain. Whatever, iphone has no Type-C Charger, AOD till now. Shame on you Apple 😡 Android Phones are good. Respect for  both Android & Apple phones 🙏
MKBHD's favourite fruit salad consists of just, Apples. Once he sued a restaurant just for adding bananas in his fruit salad.
This is soooooooooooooooo biased. They both sound like paid sales men slandering one product while praising another.
eco-friendly? stop making new models so quickly and pushing them on consumers
I think you have voted yourselves with what you own. Am I right that you both are using Samsung?
MKBHD, U just another iBoy. You just got  iSickness and "I"ed.
If the world could be anymore biased , this video pops up, the widgets are a thing on the android , ios ripped off of it and how did it win on the lock screen one while android has lock screen customization like good lock and all on samsung... bad video
So... Why didn't all your rave review style comments about Google Assistant vs Siri get Android a point?
iphone is excellent ecosystem and privacy, Android is excellent for all customization and user friendly
Android: lots of ugly customizations. iPhone: will catch up.
How much did u guys get to promote Iphone so blindly ?
How can a charging and battery go to an iPhone .   You should actually take 2 different sides and people's poll side by side. Only some dumb paid shit would go for iphone charging winner. Disappointed
Couldn't complete the video.. One thing came up in my mind, may be unaware, but biased mind 'MKHBD'.
I think is a paid position
5 grand to Ryan trahan ok boi
And that was the fanboy comparison between iOS and Android. Way to go, dudes!  😂😂😂
remember he is comparing one company to an entire software that many companies run on and apple is still on top which is incredible
Utter crap... wasted 20 minutes of my time🤣🤣
I think that android  should have won in display 100%
What...🤦🏻‍♂️
Is this a promotional video for Apple?  I feel offended using Android
When Apple pulls their head out of their collective asses and adopts USB C I will buy an iPhone. When Apple pulls their head out of their collective asses and allows expandable storage I will buy an iPhone. I run Apple and PC computers interchangeably.  I truly respect the Mac... but there is some shit I will not put up with.
I honestly thought the lighting was fine
Am I the only one who felt a little tension in the room.😅
For 300 dollars you can get 120hz fairly bright OLED screen, 80watt fast charging and OIS camera phones in Android ecosystem with Snapdragon 800 series. IQOO & Realme ones. Outside US, it is a no brainer Arun.
Video Sponsered by apple
me watching throw an A33 ....... god how i wish to have an iphone
What color is the S22 Ultra are you holding?
How much apple paid you
Felt so biased but i guess coming from a hardcore apple user, that's bound to happen. Repairability, durability, customization of the phone physically, not to talk about the enormous amount of apps you can use on android compared to an Iphone and so much more.
I love both  phones  are great 👌
Android
The fact that they are both in all black and white is  hilarious 😂😂
I don't agree! Battery award to iphone? Seriously!!!?
Please can you make a video on best tacking apps which can survive a hard factory reset,lost a lot of good phones but cant tack them
Whatever it is, most of the Android users in the world will get it.😜
i got an ipone ad
How much apple payed you guys?
Noice promotion 🙂
nice seeing u mother truckers together I think you guys should make another video in the near future. u both r my go to on phones but just this year I decided to stick with iso I use to go back and forwards between galaxy, plusone, and iPhone.
Best Apple Commercial !
But the thing is for past few years best phone of year for  MKBHD was OnePlus samsung and some android phone..and now what happens..IS there any tie-up with 🍎🤣🤣
how iphone is better than android
Lol this video is too biased towards iphones
If both of you are apple fan boys what is the point of comparing android in first place. Don't do comparison with Android. Biased video
It's just an iPhone📱 ad
I phone fan boi😂
why ddint android get the voice assistant point? im an apple user and i noticed that
Just cant believe this shit... Bro mrwhosetheboss u have not given a single best phone award to iphone in recent years and Suddenly in a video you say iphone is the BEST PHONE IN EVERY FIELD.
Iphone for photos????!!!!! What?
Nothing can beat iPhone 🙂
@15:18 that’s soooooo facts😭
Fanboy trash
So as much as I enjoy your videos, having an apple fanboy kind of influencing the results wasn't great. You work better alone. Plus factoring in Apples ridiculous 500 charge guarantee even with the slow  charging is a joke.
ഹോ പകുതി കടിച ആപ്പിലിനു 7.5 പോയിന്റോ 😏ആൻഡ്രോയ്ഡ് ഉയിർ 💦❤️
im an iphone user but i wouldve given eco to android because apple doesnt ship the phone with anyhting now, so you have to get more packaging. But in the future prolly everyone else is gonna do that too.
MKBHD : The most boring team to watch often the best  Burnley: Allow us to introduce ourselves
lidar sensor in the iphone and i pad is very impressive when it comes to quick photoscanning and camera tracking
LOL ! Video Sponsered by Apple 😂🧐
😂Lol, android is way better than apple
Apple wins again!!!!
All guys please like comments shear this video That arun can recover his flight ticket
Can we talk about how you’re comparing a 2021 iPhone against a 2022 Samsung????
Screen options for me is a priority, in android we can still find flagship level LCD screens, I'm not a big fan of AMOLED screens.
man really played genshin
This is such a biased comparison...the iPhone only beats Samsung in video..these dudes are picking iPhone over Samsung for everything
Now I understand why you are the BOSS.
It's just disappointing guys . Promoting iPhone !!! After all these years you guy's selected the best phones in Android. But this is clearly iPhone promotion Even Shoot from iphone , i guess
1:08 Nice battery percentage lol
Your friends is an iPhone lover you shouldn't even bother putting him in your video cause he's biased
I seriously unsubscribed from both of them SMH
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN AFFORD.
This video title is wrong Android vs IPhone are you kidding me like seriously bro think about. There is no comparison. Android is a operating system and iPhone is a phone
Video is shot on iPhone
This is an extremely biased video most of the points they are saying does not make any sense .
It's weird how Android only took one category. Feels like the match-up wasn't done too well because although most people definitely would give iPhone the win, most indiscriminate users would say it only wins by a few categories rather than absolute destruction.
Looks like Apple has given a lot of cash ആപ്പിൾ ധാരാളം പണം നൽകിയതായി തോന്നുന്നു
Think of price for quality, overall quality, durability and battery life. Also you get privacy on Android with deleting messages, blocking people and being able to shut down certain things
My opinion Android is better
I've always been an android fan and love value, but for the first time, I have switched to an iPhone. The primary reason is with 5+ years of iOS support, Apple just offers more. The resell value of iPhones are also first class. Pixel and Samsung really need to up their game.
Not to degrade this collab, but this is a great example of why you don't meet your heroes 😬
Apple takes a serious hit when it comes to repairablity and how end user friendly it is. As in user friendly I mean how you aren't the owner even if you pay for ig
How cheap can you  go to gain views. iArun+imkbhd :YES
I understand his points on why iPhone is better in some areas, but honestly? I am rocking a used Pixel 4XL. 90hz screen, stock android, unlockable bootloader if I wanted to custom rom (and the dev community for Roms is huge on this phone), fast charging over 25w, still one of the best cameras in any flagship, and I only bought it for $200. And not to mention it is a 1440p AMOLED, which smashes most phones anyway. I could care less about iMessage or Facetime if all I need my phone to do is accept calls and take great pictures with Pixel Feature drops every once in a while.
87% of the world uses android.  The rest are YouTube creators.  😑
Yeah the government can catch hacker faster  on android
Hey man, I really do enjoy your video’s & it’s clearly evident you put a lot of time & effort into them, making for a Professional end product. I do have one comment that is not as complimentary however, that being your “Pop UpCaptions” on screen that come up regularly, I find them very distracting & personally I don’t think they add any extra value. It’s my opinion, I otherwise have no other issues with your content, so keep it up mate! 😎🇳🇿
This is heavily biased review towards I phone. Never expected from you @Mrwhosetheboss
Mkbhd is giving a full on biased iPhone praise which lacks logic at many parts. Just an iPhone fan boy. IPhone battery life is so short it gets poor within 6months of usage. I have seen lot of people out of juice in lesser time than most of android users. Android has a open ecosystem still manages to perform in par with iPhone , will ios be able to do the same if it's open like Android?
Just ask them which editing software they use and which laptops they use on a daily basis.  That will give you the answer as to which phones they use.  iPhone is an accessory to the Mac and to the iPad and to the Apple Watch and to the MacBook.  Using an android while having apple computers and devices is a tiny minority of users.  These YouTubers are all Apple final cut users and thus lean heavily toward everything apple.  The same result would happen if this video was about macOS vs windows.  Or Apple Watch vs Samsung/Google watch.  Or Final cut vs premiere pro.  Or anything apple vs the competition.  These are all apple users.
MKBHD talking like an Apple rep for the whole video... "here's a positive point for Android, BUT here's how you can view it negatively, AND Apple can do XYZ so..."
Marquis is biased on iphone, without a doubt
Symbian Master Race
This is a disappointing one  Mkbhd like :- apple 🍎 apple 🍎 apple 🍎 without clearing a explanation
I’m probably not alone in thinking thst MKBHD comes off a little smug.  I do believe he’s an apple shill.  If not then a huge apple fanboi.
Camera experience to iPhone?! 🤔
Can you please send me the broken phones
Lol
It's actually more like Samsung vs iPhone... not android vs iPhone... I've seen different andriod phones surpass iPhone in different areas... E.g in gaming... Red magic 7 Pro crushes any iPhone gaming performance, let alone heat to performance ratio...
I'm currently using S22 ultra and really love it(switched from 13 pro max). Sadly when it comes to customer service, Samsung is nightmare. Apple to me is reliable, safe but boring. Android to me is fun, flexible but unreliable. As much as I love my current phone, this will be my last from Samsung. I really can't stand the customer service, and it's been years that they've never tried to improve.
I have been a fan of your content for a while. I may not have been one for very long, but since discovering your channel I have enjoyed your content.  This video, however, does not meet the high standards that I have come to expect from you.  The debate of Apple vs Android has been going on for years and will likely continue.  That said the way you compared these platforms was a sham.  There was no consistency to your comparisons.  If you wanted to compare the iPhone to the S22 then that's what you should have done.  To bounce between comparing the iPhone to S22 and then to compare it against all Android devices is a flawed methodology.  Android offers far more features than iPhone.  As MKBHD said some may be useful to a small set of users, but Android point blank offers more.    There is one key difference that makes Android better than Apple.  With my Android device I can do with it what I please; granted at my own risk.  I can flash a custom rom if I want.  I can load whatever apps I want.  I own the device and I do not need Alphabet's permission to do what I want.  Even once you have paid for your device Apple still decides what you can do and cant do and that is why I will never own an Apple device.
Who really gives a sh**............  spare me.
Unfair comparison. So many important things deliberately were avoided, like cross-platform integration. Although, Arun favoured Android, he didn't  give his opinion in any of the categories. Everyone knows MHKBD is an iPhone biased reviewer. If you give him a rocket, he will say apple is better. It seemed like both of them will review, instead it was MHKBD featured iPhone biased review. An excellent reviewer like Arun should carefully choose subject and its reviewer in the future.
Great vid guys. I’m sure Apple thanks you 😉
The only things keeping me from Iphone is lightning port since that still uses usb 2.0, the notch of course, and requiring to be connected mac or pc when you need to restore the system.
In camera and screan samsung 100% wins the shit collab of all time
owning an android device after watching this video feels horrible🥲
honestly im slightly dissapointed in this video. I feel like  everything went of of what Mkbhd said and Arun seemed to have little say. Knowing that mkbhd LOVES apple this video turned into "apple gets camera win because i noticed a small bug in samsung that only happened to me once". From what I have seen the s22 ultra takes better overall photos in terms of end result and dont even mention the built in samsung photo editor the photo categor should have been a tie or went to samsung. Again slightly dissapointed with how biased this video was and I feel like this was more on mkbhd's part because Arun seemed fairjust mkbhd always got to pick who won each catagory. I would love however to see a video where Arun does all of these categorys I feel like it would be much more unbiased based on actual facts and closer overall
The most important category for me: Who has the best budget phone?  Easy.  Apple has no real budget phone at all.  I can get a great Android phone for less than $400.  I can get a very good Android phone for less than $300, and a good one for less than $250.
Apple OS is absolute dog shit and Android is great... What else needs to be said, that is the end of this argument. They completely avoided ease of use and trying to figure out how to do ANYTHING on IOS is like participating in a god damn puzzle gauntlet.
Not sponsered by Apple 🍎
I follow both of you for…let’s say a long time! And I love this! Do more videos togather 🤩
Iphone is useless outside of America (Kinda). You can't use applepay at other countries, can't listen to the music you want because Itunes doesn't work very well. Thats why I give samsung a win.
I only like iPhone for offline siri
I think it is paid one 👎
I guess in the end it depends on each user, here they treat Samsung Dex as a gimmick, but that and the Spen are pretty much why i could never leave Samsung (until some other does something similar). its pretty much my main pc.
Based
Software features on Android are far and away ahead of iPhone because you aren’t locked to a single App Store on Android
I can stop watching when you said it's a draw on the display.
Tech vocabulary is cool
They actually compared 'Apples' to oranges and found a conclusion 😂
Unless you’re strictly talking about software… is it fair to compare iPhone to All androids?  Even if iPhone comes out ahead?
Did these guys make Android or Apple? Don't think so.
Do it again but this time do only IPhone vs Samsung. I curious to how different the score would be on that comparison. I also disagree with MKBHD on the photography section. Android has been killing iPhone the last couple of years. And the social media camera issue was resolved in the S22 Ultra!
Total garbage! Loads of shits!
Hey wait ,I thought this was a iPhone vs Android video... But it's like a iPhone add
Over biased
The fact that it took apple like 6 years just to bring customization to the apple world kinda bumbs me
MKBHD: I think iPhone is better in this category MrWhoseTheBoss: Interesting, I actually think Android is better in this category......... Ok, so iPhone is the clear winner!
Android is not Samsung. Also, Androids are mostly faster and a lot easier to write Software for. That's why you have a lot more Software available on Android phones.  Further iPhones behave weird and Safari is still not fixed, it behaves fully different from all  other Browser Apps (because it does not use public code). Another thing is security: Every Spyware nowadays spies on iPhones, because they're backdoored by some ... you know. Spying on Android is harder due to the variety of phones and there's no such zero-click exploit for it. Samsung has also a feature of Video Calling, but you can easily replace it using Signal or other Apps. So I would not be worried about that. 5G and 6G is better in Android and actually some Chinese Android phones having giantic batteries, so you would not have to worry at all. You can load it once every month under full energy consumption everyday. Which is very impressive.
I've never use an iPhone in my life because of the absence of the micro SD card slot.
What I love is instead of the two biggest tech guide youtber deciding to have beef and try and compete you guys instead collaborate which is a smart move as it benefits both youtbers
Was an iPhone user from iPhone 4 till the iPhone 12 & switched to Pixel 6 when it first released & I don't think I could EVER pay as much as apple charges for their phones again, Google showed you definitely can make a flagship that doesn't require a mortgage. My screen is so much better, my camera is way better, haptics are the same and I don't notice my pixel and slower than my iPhone but it definitely downloads stuff faster than my 12 did & gaming on my Pixel is just as good the only complaint is it EATS my battery way more than it did on my iPhone. Oh and Google photos >>> apple photos. My phone choice would be the Pixel 7 pro 😍 My Pixel takes great photos in any app too, that was something I was super worried about but great video but YouTube's tech review kings
I have one big problem with this video: they sort of set a baseline for Android rather than comparing it to each phone. There are Android phones with better battery than iPhones, better screens, more features, and more. That is the biggest selling point of Android. You either have to look at all androids or take away the ecosystem part of Apple. You could've also expanded and looked at ecosystems in general. For instance, most people use Windows. Android works really well with that, but iphone doesn't. Android can work with thousands of accessories that Apple blocks out. And so on and so forth. I feel like this was sort of rigged for apple.
Still google maps is the winner...😀
Why is that ? 🤔  Then what did you gain ? 🤑
U need a Samsung vs apple with mkbhd
Bruh is so biased that if iPhone doesn't win calls it a draw. 💀💀
lol i love the you say the way you think the iPhone is better but that's  your opinion  and my opinion then still need catch up
The iPhone vs Android comparison is like comparing a metro rail transport with car transport.  one has a dedicated eco system and the other has shared.  I feel it's never an apples to apples comparison.  Maybe try loading ios on all Android models and android os on iphone and then compare.
When Androids and iPhones are exactly the same, Android is the knockoff. Iphones win.   This is coming from someone that has used Android because of the features always. My next phone will be an iphone, the loss of the headphone jack was the dagger in android.
I remembered Arun saying that as a kid when he just started doing videos, he looked up to MKBHD. Now they're chillin' like good old buddies, and Arun even got to be the best Tech Youtuber. More collabs pls!
For me, iPhone not win in a single category. Because I have no plan to use it at all. All the way in Android ha ha
Android is easier to control some phones you can easily remove the storage and change it
android gets games first 75% of the time
WINDOWS PHONE (yes it’s coming back I heard some leaks)
Mkbhd is nit pickin
MKBHD happened to daily drive the worst android flagship hahaha
s22 ultra has the app integration now so a little surprised
How’s the workouts coming along?
Neither--I feel so blessed that silly cell phones didn't come in until I was in my thirties.  These play phones along with the isolating 'social media' crap is creating a society separate from  society...
Soooo we are comparing iPhone to hundreds of Android phones ???? Yeah, that seems fair !!! ??? 🤔
MKBHD is a well known appletard, he's only looking for android surface but checking deeply iPhone features.  i'll still use android forever.
This is such a biased comparison. The spectrum of Android phones make it it impossible to compare "Android" to iPhone. Considering the cost range of Android phones, and how pricey iPhones are, I'd think you should have compared iPhones to flagship Androids, like S22s, Sony Xperia, Vivo, and others only, and not include he lower cost Android models at all .
That's it this guy has always been an apple but licking boy! I'm out, this channel is so biased, apple did a good job here.
Disappointed.
Android been better since the HTC hero 💪🏻
Wiser words from a wise man for whom never gives you up nor let’s you down and never turns around and won’t hurts you who proclaims that he will never never make you cry or hurt you
lol iPhone promotion
Just get a phone that you're gonna be happy with.
This is MJ vs LBJ talk. We all know who the droid is…
I'm so confused about this video/topic... So every category they talk about there's a android phone that beats the iPhone. So shouldn't android have came out on top? If he talking overall avg. Then might as well be best overall Android phone vs iPhone... Title of this video should've been what is mkvhd go to phone...
19:48 ultimately comes down to what people want. did not expect to hear that at all
Lol one day and 2.1 million views wow. You are two of the best . I’d say the two best
I thought it was gonna b a comparison of the OS and not the hardware. U cant take the top of the line iphone and compare it to all androids.
Awesome and amazing conversation that we all were blessed to watch. I’ve watch both of you guy’s channels grow and blossom. Continued success 💐🥃
Me busy watching to things I can’t even afford anyway it’s matters of time
Okay
Two INTJs doing a deep dive; love to see it
These shots n edits are next level cheers !
Am I actually the only person who doesn't give a damn about widgets? From day one Android and until now on an iPhone 13 I couldn't care less about widgets! What is wrong with me?
The I phone SE is horrendous value for money, it's objectively the shitty edition. Who the fuck wants an HD only screen and 4gb ram for 900$ in 2022 ? You must be out of your fucking mind for that purchase... Also software management can never ever compensate for physical ram. If you're a heavy multitasker all I phones are really shitty because of apples greed... And why is the fact that the charger is absent from the I phone box not respected here? Most of android phones still ship with one. The whole interview is so heavily biased that it doesn't really make sense to point out anything wrong with it... Brownlee has to shill for apple to get those sweet event invitations...
You did not even give android a chans do you know that android can zome in better then iphone
To me apple won
ugh the bias in this video. praised 4k video editing on iPhone(which i do not think anyone uses) and did not even talk about split screen on andriod
Iphone camera? Mkbhd is sponsored by apple
I have never commented on any of these before but I think I Gotta for this, this is the most biased and unthought video ever from tech reviewers who claim to be as impartial as possible, choosing niche scenarios when it favors iphone and use to give them the win then when the same niche scenario can give android the win, you don't, like in the case of the fairphone, well what can we expect when it was filmed in the apple factory
I think this dude work for Apple lol... get a Samsung lol
i havent even finished the video and MKB is already so apple biased, had to turn it off. Its annoying
Big creators like this shouldn’t be igniting or sparking phone wars.  It’s 2022 it’s all preference now
See, kids? It’s fine if you’re not in agreement all the time. Be peaceful. Always love to see these two favorite tech Youtubers.
Okay so I'm upgrading from an iphone 7 and i cant decide which is better phone, so I searched and saw this!!
Had me till display being a draw 💀
I've always had Android, my wife and daughters have always had Apple and not sure about all the technical nuances but can say that their phones have more broken screens and just more operating issues than my Android. Cant tell you how many times they have had to visit the "genius" bar for something, me, never!
I have a android lenovo. I need a new phone i really considering getting an I phone.  Im just not sure I phone has a high price tag .
Mkbhd very biased. Arun tried to be unbiased. Iphone never the best phone in Mkbhd's annual best phone award. But this video kind of marketing for Iphone. Disappointed 😓😓😓
Amazing interview sers
A really honest video.
What about accessibility? I wear glasses thus my eyes arent great, android makes texts and images bigger and brighter compared to iphone. Also, the typing experience on an iphone is booty compared to android
I can't believe you didn't mention always on display, a massive feature that iphone is lacking and it's important for a good number of people
The real answer? Real life experience. All my friends with Apple devices are always sighing deeply because some app everyone else uses on Android isn't available to them. The difference is the app store and the sheer amount of apps available on Android. Otherwise, the phones all do the same things and are both susceptible to hackers.
Incredible they dont mention phone size, which is also really important so you dont feel a brick in your pocket, who offers the best for smaller phones, like up to 6" screen max, baaah...
This bullshxt is literally a bias apple commercial and it's disgusting that two of the top reviewers on YouTube are completely bought out and would release some trash like this!
iPhone its top quality is able to be streaming and pictures quality and android it’s multitasking easy to work on😉
Idk how to say this but you totally sound like a different person compared to your other iphone vids😂 Asking things for the battery and such that you already know the answer to because you have done like 10 battery tests. Or the camera vid you did for the iphone. Just seemed weird
The kinds of arguments mkbhd made to justify iphone and ios mannn😂😂😂😂
This is actually insane!!!!
whai do you both promote the worst phone ever made ... hmm ... that's unbelievable
Yeah Apple is better than most of Android. But it's not better than Samsung
It looks like this video wasn't necessarily about Android vs iPhone, but mainly just Samsung/Google vs iPhone (especially on the photography part).  There are a lot of Android phones out there, from a lot of brands. I don't think those two brands can represent Android as a whole.
Doing a comparison video when one person is clearly an Apple fanboy... was never gonna be a fair one
I feel this is biased. Android beat it in screen gaming and photography. I'm kinda disappointed
Half of this is true just for the USA and the UK. Europe and the Asian market mostly use Android phones. AirDrop, FaceTime and IMessages are irrelevant for Android users, because Android has replacement for those. AirDrop=Googe Files, FaceTime=Google Duo and IMessages=Google Messages. It's just a phone and Apple is brand that is trendy so that's why they are on the top. But they don't inovate anything they are just stilling and improving other's ideas. So real tech lover IMO wouldn't support Apple. I wouldn't use it even if you gave me for free. Maybe I would use MacBook for Music production. But in my country MacBook Air base model cost over 1300 euros, which is just insane.
Apple sponsored !
Bro I LOVE Videos like this
I carry both and man this was a heavily skewed comparison
This video def was more biased to apple.  A lot of wrong points given to apple even so android was better on those.  A lot of incorrect info as well honestly this was the worst video I have seen of Arun and MKBHD yet
I saw people think this video was iOS biased. Imo, maybe because their respective country also mostly uses Apple's iOS rather than Android 🤷🏽
Fun fact, Google is already carbon neutral
Would have been cool if you still did the bounce into your chair in the intro
I could only watch about 5 minutes of this show. This is plain and simple a commercial for I-Phones.
IF iphone is a great phone why don't Marques give any awards to iPhone?
lol you cant agree that android design better but you made it tie 👏💩
I feel like mkbhd is fed up with android
Biased ...puff
The result is the wrong way round. Yes apple may be intuitve, but that's because they are so basic. A Samsung for example when used with DEX becomes a PC when you link in a monitor. You can split screen, camera is better, faster charging, have features years before the slow evolution of apple etc etc. In a way, apple are becoming the new Dorro phones. Basic and dull, they need a big shape up or they will end up just like Nokia
Well actually android also have widgets for years, so therefore they have MUCH more experience and android phones are FAR more customizable.
I appreciate the use of facts and actual information but it's kind of sad that a lot of the points to apple were just heavly biased
Stop the cap
A phone is personal, therefore the two  phones arent as any good as eachother, Its all up to personal preference.
marques is basing half his decisions on aesthetics, which is the least important in deciding better
Finally an unbiased comparison.
Them robot dogs n sht is controlled via Android!
i mean both a very decent but the reason why i keep using android is cuz of the marketing of iphones and insane prices they do (btw, on mexico it is pretty damn expensive especially because you have to buy olmost each thing the iphone needs)thats why i mostly try to look for decent prices
So who won
The only show I didn’t like
Stop lying marques
The main issue i have with iPhones is the almost 'cult' surrounding them here in the US, at least in my age group. So annoying to be left out of groups because I prefer Android.
so theyre comparing apple to all of android? gotta compare samsung to apple
Sir I love tech I am only 14 years old can I contact you
You guys are biased. Just speaking for apple
Cringe factor 😬 100000%
Iphone 6 battery...
This is the most bias video ever (no cap).
?
I never had a photo disapear (never used an iphone)
i prefer android
I believe this is biased video towards apple, realistically android is better than apple.
If I had enough cash I would always pickup an Apple phone because of its great resale value. That in itself is like a guarantee for me. So I can exit an iPhone easily even though the entry cost is high.   But cant say the same about Android because they get outdated pretty fast and there is always a 200-300$ new phone round the corner which will make a buyer go for this over a used Android flagship.
Most biased comparison ever. Androids have the best night time photography thats a big win as well as zoom capabilities
Hey con you give me a phone im poor
Worst video ever made lol. Mkbhd is fkn apple fanboy, hard to watch.
One big miss is compatibility. I love the iPhone but I use a s21 ultra because it plays nicely with a plethora of non apple devices and services (ie my garmin watch, and office 365).   Oh yeah, and as a other commenter stated, file management, and Dex. These are actually useful to people who want to use their phone as a mini computer when on the go.   I also find it weird how they sandwiched OS with hardware when Android hardware, and heck...even software, is such a variable experience.
I used to be impartial to iOS, then I tried it (iPad Pro). NEVER AGAIN! People who prefer iOS clearly never held an Android in their hands. Ffs, you can't even change a file extension or clear an app's cache on iOS!
Another apple stroke fest
In my own opinion this video was and is quite biased   I love MrWhoseTheBoss but no man
I do not think it is fair to have iPhone against all other android since there are variations of companies that work on that system but not the specs, like vivo, Samsung, and others. If you want a fair comparison it would be like iPhone vs Samsung for sure. (and maybe do not be biased)
Most unfair comparison, unfair judgements i ever saw. Atleast ne truthful to yourself.
all the ppl who use androids mad in comments lol
Hey Mrwhosetheboss  i just had a question about what you think about the new Iphone 14 flip.
Dang I disagreed with just about all of these points lol
They didn't talk about launchers on Android which completely change the UI of your homescreen with custom layouts, icons, and all that. In addition, Android's file system works more like a PC, then there's the sideloading you can do. These are all things major, major things they didn't discuss.
I feel like the se is a great value if you want iOS, otherwise it needs a upgrade with camera and Face ID, etc. 😉
I like you guys 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 so much, but I am sorry kind of totally disagree this. Because iPhone is good for shotting video in day time only, not even night, it's not let user to use 3x zoom lens at dark! Maybe if only take day time photos, I will choose iPhone too, but not if I only can take one phone with me, that definitely will be Android. Freedom is everything for me, I need install multi country's app and I can't agree with this is not in your country/region, really too bad. But if iOS can more open like install any software I want, I will prefer iPhone again, because it's fast. However, notch is extremely ugly, no body think so?
I think that Android's are more interesting to customize, explore while iPhones are boring and not much to explore. I have MacBooks and iPads which just work but a phone should be different and that's why Android's are more interesting to me. Nothing wrong with iphones are great but to me it has no personality.
I'm not surprise they pick iPhone over android, marquis has a iPhone anyway. There are 2 things iPhone can't do multitask ,& don't have a spen
Why android didn’t got a point for the feature thing it has 2 different kinds of airdrops built in what you don’t know because youre not really using youre phones th stones of features are not nobody using because one of Abu are not using them this makes no sense why are you so stupid i don’t get it is this an argument to do these videos? Some things are clear but than you switch to costmazation which is an other categorie and then its a draw back again you wont tell this bullshit. Do you even believing  what youreself are talkin?
I feel sad watching this vid on my android damnnn
In most countries iMessage and  facetime aren't as important as it is in the USA. Android phones are better value for money if you don't care about these features. This is why android phones are more common in the rest of the world compared to the states.
iPhone is a phone for women. Looks good with their handbags.
Not even surprised at the apple bias 🤷‍♂️
i have a Sony Pro-I and i had a Apple iPhone 13, and in the photo category the Sony wins clearly for me. This cam is enormous, I dont understand why they didnt compared these two monsters..
What a biased opinion!!
you're voting categories were crap, you have technical support but you don't have gaming, you thought Android phones were better for photography but you give the point to iPhone. and the same for video Even though Android phones have high resolution cameras. you didn't have a section for audio, or accessories, or Bluetooth compatibility, or 5G compatibility.
Ive never seen apple doing something for the world there only telling everyone they’ve let the charger out cause of climatically reasons but this is a lie. Android is making phones out of sea nets and many other companies are doing a tones more then apple why this is a point for apple? I thought you’re Profis in this but unfortunately i see you’re only some guys which had luck that they got many views and enough money out of it to buy any fucking phone. Pretty sad
Always choose iPhone! It’s the right choice. It’s a wise idea 💡 and who thinks Apple should bring back iPods?
this whole video is biased.  Marques lacks the ability to be objective.  the top tier phones are soooooo similar, the only decideing factor is which architecture you prefer.  personally , i have hated apple and everything they make for over a decade now.
Now he has to come to your lair in England ^^
Fanboy demais, sabe nada kkkk
Remember some android as a whole projected
beautiful video, but Marques seems exhausted, and something seems off, but since you say its rushed, makes sense...
Wtf was that 😂 Mkbhd is Biased af.
Never been a better time to set white balance XD
two of my favourite youtuber in the same video...great content even though i think it will never be a clear winner between the two o s its just a matter of preferences....maybe the only thing i think android has to really improve is software support.
You guys gave the battery award to the iPhone😐
Android vs IPhone is already an unfair approach to begin with
Come on, samsung dex phone turns in to desktop pc. No brainer
I like MKBhd a lot but giving a win to iPhone on customization that seemed pretty biased to me, especially considering  the fact you comparing samsung to features that you haven’t even used yet.🚮
I think the biggest issue with Android is consistency and stability. As said in the video, the Iphone implements features much later then andrioid phones. But, when the features do arrive they are usually a lot better. Android needs to stop adding so many different features and start focusing on the ones that mean the most to the majority of people.
Android!
How biased u can be?  MKBHD: Yes 😂😂😂 Seriously? Even customisation 😂😂 seems like a apple c***suc**r😑😑
MKBHD is Apple fanboying
A little bit BIAS comparison
Personaly i think an android is a thinkerers phone. Its an open standard that you can do a lot of things with. On the other side iphone is a bit more polished and probably easyer to understand for most people. Just depends what you want or need and who you trust your data with.
In this episode of pointless comparisons..
Pressure from Apple to promote them?
The thing is u both like ios more
alright, I am almost certain MKBHD is a shill for Apple, from his tweets to his vids, every bad thing he says about iPhones are SURGICAL. It's a BAD phone and he keeps saying it isn't.
I enjoyed the video but overall, felt this was wrong, let me explain. You could compare ios to android (which versions?) Or you could compare apple to Samsung, Sony etc. (Brand) but this lop sided comparison was only ever going to land in one direction due to taking the strengths from one and the weaknesses from many. Not disputing some of the arguments, but I also think, spending more time with a phone results in learning the nuances and best settings, I agree iPhone makes it easy through its consistency, but that results in less time and patience with other brands to learn how they work best. Ultimately, its all opinion, and was an interesting watch/concept.
What about 3rd party apps and apk's it's so convenient on Android,and streaming   apps so easier on Android..I had 13 Pro max and swept it for s22 ultra I was so much happier there is so much more depth in Android
Didn't expect.😀
Noo
Seems everything was rigged against the Android from the start.smh
Bro was in the mark rober video both of them I mean
If this was based on the science and not the opinion, the actual score would have been 7 for Android and 5 for iPhone.
I'm a Samsung user and despite all the hate on this video. I Agree with your points. I think you gotta really know about the tech space to understand it.    I am extremely disappointed with Samsung and believe believe are very much behind. I hope Samsung listens to this video and improves in app camera performance, battery life and processor
If this video doesn’t come to a conclusion of which is actually better I’m unsubscribing from both channels
Why Marques look soft?
This video looks like a huge iphone advert. Giving the camera point to the iphone when it's clearly subpar in quality compared to android flagship is just a huge joke. I am not a "fanboy" by the way, I own both a Galaxy S22 Ultra and an iPhone 13 and I still think this video is utterly ridiculous. Also the fact that you can't sideload iPhone apps and are at the mercy of Apple's appstore is not mentioned at all, that's a huge factor to me and why I am using my S22 Ultra a lot more despite the lesser overall battery life, I am not even mentioning the iPhone's lackluster notification drop down menu, the lack of decent appdrawers alternatives or home screen customization, the lack of third party alternative UI gestures...
I love MKBHD, he’s the type of guy who will not be biased to apple. Take for example: Mrwhosetheboss, “Now, what does IOS have that android doesn’t.” MKBHD, “Wait we should look at the whole overview.” So that’s like showing that he likes to be fair.
Apple wins every time. Just the way it is. Doesn’t mean android sucks. It’s means apple is better. 😎
both of them using android liol its clear which phone is better
Subscribe if u did? 😂
Arun trying hard to defend android
That video is a joke
Are those Android phone from the Ukraine? So many holes in them 👍
My s21+ is looking after me very well.
I would love to get an iPhone that is an android os except for the camera logic/software.  But I just cannot stand the iPhone os. I've thought about just buying a used one and operating it solely on wifi to use the camera. That being said I've taken some stunning pictures with my s6 and s10  On thing I've done is dedicate my Bixby button to my camera and it makes shooting much quicker.  Also I just felt like there are more categories that factor into what the "best" phone is.  But I always enjoyed and loved seeing you two together you should do more vids together.
MK  seems to be a Apple fan
Mrwhosetheboss needs to stop including this guy in his videos. He clearly allows his sentiment over cloud his judgement. He is an apple fanatic, the guy packs apple gadget no one uses in his iconic bag pack. The truth is iPhone plays everything too safe but their user are weirdly satisfied with that and that is fine. The android user demand more always and put a lot of pressure on Androids. But we all know androids can't be that bad. He is obviously prejudiced. How dare you say the iPhone 13 archaic design is more ergonomic with the flat edges? I miss when reviews were actually fair.
Bruh ok
I object me lord :p
A brilliant video. Like a Reagan and Gorbachev summit meeting. Well done guys.
I remember flashings roms on android yrs ago, also constantly upgrading to the latest & greatest android! It was fun but also annoying. In reality i was searching for reliability,speed, & attractive UI. Switched to iPhone in 2016 with the X and haven’t looked back!
These guys are legends. The best youtube tech reviewers. I just wish Arun took my advice and started reviewing all things tech like Marques. Smartphones are not the only thing I car about. in fact I don't even care about them anymore. They are an old product. Test Bluetooth speakers, laptops, EVs, e-bikes. Technology is not just smart phones.
Apple battery and charging sucks
the amount of bias that went into this comparison lmao. you were just giving points to iphone
people still doing phone wars these days??
2 legend doctors of smartphones, I like the way the explain about the all-rounder aspects of smartphones and so on , by the way I’m typing this comment from the best smartphone iPhone 13 pro max 😊😊
I care about the back button so it is android for me ! and also customizability. So android for me all day, everyday.
Marques is always biased when it comes to android.
I have changed a lot of my opinions on iphone since last year I know it's good, maybe too expensive but honestly is better than most android phones however I still wouldn't buy an iphone, mainly because it's really really expensive, for that price you could build a good pc (even in my country) and second because you can't emulate on ios without Jailbreak and that basically means having shit security (like android basically)
How does iPhone get a draw in the widget/ lockscreen category and it doesn't even exist for users yet? Thumbs down video.
Finally I Want the Answer which is Best ??? iPhone r Android ???
Y'all are gonna think I'm weird but I think that the notch on the iPhones isn't just a design feature but it is a pretty design feature. I actually loved the way the larger one looked on the older iPhones.
It's so Dope seeing the two best tech youtubers collab like this🙂. You guys are amazing. I really enjoy watching your content and love hearing your perspective on tech. Thank you both for being so awesome. Keep doing what you do.
Damn I had never seen such overwhelmingly negative comments on an Arun video. I mean, politely negative, but negative regardless. I think it goes beyond Android users being mad and it has to do a lot more with the fact that even when you seemed to disagree with Marques he would say something "like does it though?"  out loud and you'd immediately switch your opinion to match his. It feels like you cannot back up your own arguments or stand up for your own opinions-- which for someone who makes a living on tech reviewing is highly questionable.
@mkbhd is talking like a drunk @apple fan boy
Ridiculously biased video, not a balanced analyses. (I want to edit this reply, as you know it's a very divisive question, android or iOS. I enjoyed this video and enjoyed reacting to it. Keep up the good work. Thank you )
the video is 20:22 long
The main difference is that you have hundreds of phones to choose from on android. Just comparing to the "best" is not an accurate or fair test.
As a tech fan, I gotta say, this video suck. I know marques is an apple fan boy, but Arun you too ? Really ? Iphone is good, but giving android 1.5 in a comparison video is fucking hilarious.
Mrwhosetheboss sitting there listening to wisdom.
Poor video. It was more like an interview for Marques's personal opinions. I like MKBHD, but I thought this was going to be less personal more analytical and with 2 way answers.
As an Android user I don't use iPhones for the sole reason of IOS, I hate it, despise it and will probably never use it unless they make some massive changes to it. I even gave it another try last year with the 13 Pro Max but returned it within two weeks.
My Motorola is basically a less quality experience with the iPhone on battery
This video is sutch a lie
Hungry for money guys...he chose  iphone for camera 😆 😂 😆
Even a note 20 ultra has a better camera than iphone 13 pro max
I try to explain that too friends regarding these phones. As a photographer and a pc guy who builds and upgrades his own computers, I prefer Android. Even if iPhone is better is some categories. Apple products in general, aren't DIY friendly. Thus there are restrictions I don't want to have to comply about.  And Android, since the G1 phone which I had, has come a LONG way! To the point they are now and have been for a while a threat to Apple. I'm pretty happy about that.  So, there is no better! It just matters what's important to you. I don't have an issue with refresh rates or whatever else was discussed in this video. My Androids have done me well for years. But, that doesn't mean I go around bashing Apple. Again, there is no better. To me at least.
You should've done this is real world performance, not technical specs.
Less objective, most biased video ever made.
Android got clapped💀
Enjoyed it, subscribed. Thanks 🙏
I think you missed an important part regarding value.  The value over time, value with being able to resell it, or pass it down.  I have a daughter who is using an older iPhone 7 for example.
In these days iPhone and Android comparison is useless. Its all depends on personal preference and use.
As someone who loves my iPhone 13 pro Max. A clear winner for screens is Samsung
I like some Mrwhosetheboss videos, but this one is literally pointless
WOW! probably the most biased review I have ever seen from 2 of the best reviewers on youtube!! lol How come your variables are totally one sided and not the case for majority of the users! The Fact that you gave away the battery to Apple(iphone) is just non sense. what's happened to your logic MKBHD? Very lame.
I massively prefer android because not everyone has 500€ to get the lowest end option available (iphone SE price). I gave 185€ for a Redmi note 9s and I really have no complaints. 5000mAh battery easily gets me two days, a snapdragon 885 can cope with the demanding tasks and the overall feel is great. Yes the MIUI is confusing when you need to dig into the settings but search fixes it and everywhere else, it is great and intuitive. Personally I don't think it is worth giving more than 200€-250€max for a phone. In apple, there are zero options on that budget, let alone have support for the huge number of apps play store offers
I used both apple and Samsung but I like Samsung more
U all are just iPhone fans man ooh
Shitty iphone just people buy for status
He was using his s21 ultra to compare he doesn't use the s22 ultra then compare to iPhone 12
Why didn't he compare iPhone se to a pixel how on earth will an iPhone se camera be part of the reasons it wins 🤔 didn't even mention the battery life but imessage lol didn't mention storage but FaceTime lol
J jai kowk iphone er mayre chudi Android er upre phone nai
King 👑 of photography Vivo x 80 pro
😔😔
This is very sad arun ilke your alla videos but this on I don't know
I hated this video and I hate apple
When it comes to mrwhosetheboss, I used feel a particular genuinety but this time I didn't get it. Everything felt biased. 1.5 score for Android was way bad. It was if Android was some useless phone that could call and message. Really disappointed. Please take viewpoint of the community. We prefer a lot of different features other than what you have mentioned.
i don't think this valuation about apple and android is true... you guys are the best tech influencers people all around the world look at after releasing each and every Smartphone... u have to say some truth about the reality in using the phones...unfortunately i felt MKBHD is giving more importance to the apple...And  the Eco system is not really matter in every country to give more importance to apple smartphones...Very sad and being a fan boy i felt more to think after taking all your words that make us to buy and spent money on a smart phone...Very Sad
Most biased review I have ever heard MKBHD at a time was promoting One plus now its iPhone
Imagine paying $1k for a phone
Now most people buy phones focusing on two needs: Gaming and photography.  Android and iPhone both have their own strengths and weaknesses.  Compared to changing the charging cable to usb c, it is true that Android still has more advantages when they are designed for multitasking.  Why do people choose to buy an iPhone?, in my opinion because of its luxury, quality products and its own system, IOS.  Compared to Android, which is crowded with many types of models and you are spoiled for choice, most Android gives people what they need more than the iPhone.  Let me compare the Iphone 13 with the cheaper Nubia Red Magic 6s cyborg, android phone.  you have a cool phone, good battery life and elegant gamer look.  You can upgrade the phone's memory, which the iPhone threw it away in the new versions.  If you are a user who wants to buy a phone to play games?  Don't buy Iphone because it's expensive and hard to choose option.  If you are a photography enthusiast with luxury phones?, Iphone is more suitable for you.   So which is better, the answer is they all same. It's just different in terms of user needs.  As Asus Rog Phone even has particularly crazy ideas when this is the type of Android phone that can beat the Iphone down if you compare the option of the same price range combined with its warranty policy of the two companies.  Both sides have strengths of each other, but if comparing the company, I think the number of people who prefer Asus is probably more than Iphone, if Asus continues to fight and encroach on phones, operating systems and more.  Iphone will probably lose many users.
The Thumbnail is opposite 😂
Thanks for the Fair Phone shout out!
Useless video. What about flexibility, compatibility with open standards and choice of accessories
Every video of Android vs Apple is automatically leaned towards apple 🤷🏾‍♂️
Strange opinion but I feel actually comparing iPhone to the entire android in general is liter just handing over the win to iPhone I love phones and all and always keep an open mind with them but you are basically just comparing one phone series to hundreds and thousands of series which makes how one is affect the rest  Like in the place where Marques mentioned the issue of actually taking a picture with the Pixel and not actually finding it would be an entirely different story with a Samsung device  All the same awesome video guys  Really hope I’ll one day be able to get my ideas out just like you do soon
On the camera side. Double tap power to open camera in android is amazing , also +1 for Sony's dedicated camera button
The iPhone works better because of its operating system is made custom for the iphone Android is made for all kinds of different systems . I still would never own a iPhone they such as a company like slowing down your cell so you buy the new one. Sansung is where it's at. Iphone sucks period. Iphone holds there value but there memory has no SD card so you pay out the ass for more memory.  I have never owned a iPhone I have had a tablet and  they are a good product but I am not a sheep so I don't buy them. THE displays on samsung are so nice.
More like a Iphone sponsored promotion video
Two isheeps.
Are you comparing OS or iPhone 13 Pro/ Max to current generation of Android smartphones? It doesn't look like comparing operating systems...
Is this Samsung vs Iphone or Android vs iphone
Nokia is the real winner.
I am an Android person but I will admit that iPhones do have a better quality feel to them and their batteries are very very good but in my opinion I still believe that Android is better because they have more phones for different uses with all kinds of different prices from very cheap to very expensive...
The worst unfair comparison I ever seen.
I disagree...
Lol. Android 20. iPhone 12
Apple do use use recycling process in there phones....but at the end of the day apple want there costumers to shift to the new iphones as soon as they are launched and there marketing is based on that too soo just because they do more for the environment tecnically if every apple user change iPhone every time they are launched (which most of the hardcore apple consumers do) actually lead to more wastage of the environment
I personally love the curves , makes the back gesture feel smooth.  As for the vibrator intensity..... previously it was somewhat too strong ... its now more subtle.  And as so long the battery can last you a whole day, whatever is extra is just extra. Cause at the end of the day, one will still want to start off with a 100% of battery.  And the one satisfying thing about the S-Pen is that it's there when you want to use it on not necessarily using it all the time.
ManSpread'sTheBoss!
You forgot durability android definatley wins. I can drop my phone from ten feet or throw it 30 feet and it will be fine (without a case)
iPhone user here.  Great video btw… But, you’re comparing one manufacturer (Apple iPhone ), to loads of other manufacturers (Android).  Anyway, iPhone still won 🏆 😁
I love the collabo,thou I would recommend bias should a little be aside as we call a spoon a spoon but not a big spade
do a mrwhosetheboss vs teh other dude
Samsung s10
Tell me the truth..... How much 💰 you got from apple crew for making this video... 🤣
Wtf this guy is just support Apple 🙂
Clearly paid promotion to apple
iPhone it is!
I mean to call imessage and FaceTime "essential" is very North America biased if you ask me
Android is better. No caps.
So disappointed to see that video on one of my favourite channels. It is so lame! There's no argument, just mkbhd' s personal opinion about his favourite brand. Easy to unfollow Mark, but Arun , whyyyyyyy???
Why are we still calling this android vs iPhone? Shouldn't it be Samsung vs Apple or Samsung/Google vs Apple? Throwing all those other brands brings the average down on Android side
This is the stupidest comparison I've seen. They literally underplayed so many of Android's features...
This video is pretty stupid, have to say never imagined Arun making this kind of a biased comparison. Always knew MKBHD is an Apple fanboy, even Arun disagrees with him in a lot of the categories. Made no sense that Marques got the final say in the all the verdicts without any debate or arguments from Arun's side.
Android is the best
Android phone is better than iPhone, and repair cost is less than iPhone .and Kbhd given the best smartphone award to Android Samsung S21,i think the people usually buys iPhone mainly because of the brand value , and they think iPhone have the best camera,they are not accepting Android phone camera is the best because Apple is known for the best camera phones for so many years and, there is no type C charging and no charger in the box ,buy everything seperately
As a Samsung/Android user, I can agree that the iPhone ticks more boxes. However, it makes better sense to me if the comparison is (for example) iPhone vs Samsung, iPhone vs Pixel, iPhone vs Xiaomi, etc etc etc.  iPhone is a more static system vs all of the Android devices, which present as a more fluid system, hence the challenge of accurately comparing overall systems, without the bias of multiple differences.   I did thoroughly enjoy both your opinions and perspectives on a major tech industry discussion.
You mean samsung vs iPhone not android vs iPhone
Welp i just wanna add Vi-LTE and VoLTE as counter for i message and facetime as both ViLTE and VoLTE can be used on any generic phone app and messaging app for android phones that supports the feature. and hey, you can videocall someone just by directly pressing a contact in your phonebook 🙄 Which i phones dont support without using a separate app.
I understand the idea of taking average of Android ecosystem vs the iPhone, but it's actually not fair assessment. Beside Samsung, the Google pixel and maybe Sony, most Android phones are priced at fractions of the iPhone, so it doesn't make sense that you're comparing compatibility with the iPhone.
"Mkbhd, we will not be biased"  Mkbhd; i would choose the iPhone, only because i like it
Nah I would take definitely Android for camera
TALK ABOUT MISSED OPPORTUNITY: Why didn't you both slam into the chairs after each bout???? I'll never find nirvana.
The reason why ios is running better on insta snap etc is cuz its a single software that's why it runs better as Android and android has so many manufacturers every company doing there own thing with the android software Android has so many more features interms customization or just put a micro or nano SD in it Can't say any other things cuz my english isn't really as good as I would explain it in german
Unfortunately it's time to unsubscribe this channel. I knew that both of those tech reviewers are really in fond of iPhones and Apple's ecosystem - especially after iphone 13. But this material, bias of both of those gentlemen is just crazy. I thought that reviewers should be more indifferent, less of a fanboys - anyway officially. Huge disappointment boys.
SPOILER ALERT. Windows phone won.
Two legends in one Frame 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️✌🏻✌🏻
IT IS ALWAYS IPHONE WITH YOU PEOPLE... CANNOT STOP DRINKING THE APPLE JUICE HEY.   TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT A IPHONE AND TAKE A LOOK AT GALAXY S22, S22 LOOKS LIKE IT'S FROM THE FUTURE
I use multi window all the time
Great Collab  I Always love to see these two do what they do best but their comparison was much tilted to one end and that markee's not fair Keep up😌👌
I'm an iPhone user.But I like Android🥰
Apple is better forever ✨✨
Highly biased comments from MKBHD, his mind isn't about clear comparison but only in favour of his favourite which is the iPhone. Samsung is better than android
The days of iPhone are numbered. Tesla model Pi
I think notifications are still lagging on ios. But privacy is much better on ios
Just the lack of a Back button and easy task switching tends to make the iPhone to irritating for me to use. Not that I don't have one. It's just my spare.
This has to be the most ridicilous and unobjective comparison in the history of comparissons, VERY bad job guys...
You shouldn't compare apple will all of android, majority of android phones cost way less. For the screen should've been 1:0
Great video guys 👍🏾 👍🏾
Marques was biased af looks like he has never used an Android in his life
I like this conversation because it's very analytical of both platforms. I prefer android phones but Apple's software is just so much more optimized that it gives them a leg up in most situations.
Laughable about Apple winning the phone best for the environment when it's made in the world's most polluting country . What it is made with does  not touch that fact.
I'd never pay a penny for an Apple product regardless
Obviously iPhone is soooo ahead in all aspects !! Thanks for unbaised vid it was outclass !!!! Nothing is close to iPhones even
mrwhosetheboss I have always wanted a iphone could you send me one please!
As an audiologist, iOS is so far ahead with accessibility integration.
Is environment  conscious is a major factor in comparison? If yes, Apple may seem like it's recycling more, but the actual amounts of rare earth, tungsten, tin, and gold are minute compared to the plastic and other materials being used in their iPhones. Meanwhile, Samsung is ahead on using 100% recycled packaging materials, and eliminating all plastic within its smartphone boxes. And it uses usb C cable which is very common, where as Iphone requires separate cable called lightning cable to connect laptops or something different from their eco system.
The common matter that second one is always won by reviewer. I love iphone because of it's durability. No features will count without durability.
I’ve been using the IPhone 7 as an Android user for life,and I like some things in iOS,I think it’s pretty good as second phone or basic things but I miss a lot of things on Android and I like that customisation and features and the prices are a lot better,especially midrange nowadays, you can get a strong battery life, great Amoled/oled screen and even very good camera for about 300$ and Android gives that choice for everyone.

I feel like you were agreeing with everything MKBHD was saying. some topics were debatable but you gave in to MKBHD's Iphone
Very disappointed with two big fish  onlyy highlights iphone rather than any android .in ua words android phones are too cheap and even ppl hesitate to buy... we ppl indians can afford android phones mostly .so plz dont kill it with ios  u ppl are inspiration for us .so im very sad u only give this much points to android 😓😓😓😓😓☹️☹️
Am I the only one that have got a emoji bubble just under this video?
I strongly disagree with the camera points for the sole reason of the iPhone's lack of a manual mode in the default camera app. It's very frustrating to not be able to fiddle with the shutter speed and ISO.
Photography for iPhone? We have seen many youtubers reviewin that S22 ultra nails it compared to Iphone. Until last year no body could say Samsung can take better photos. They did their best to achieve such a thing now with S22 and again these guys are sayin that iPhone alone is reliable. And gave a whole point to Iphone. Just Wow.
Android is hands down better. iPhones are for people who are on the low side of the IQ scale. Or something to give to your parents because they don't grasp technology.
The 2 giants collab. Awesome 😎.
No mention of foldables? I'm disappointed
The respect the  both of you have for each other is  💯💯 awesome
This video makes no sense at all. The greatest strength of the Android platform is the options. You completely removed that from many of these categories. I worked for AppleCare for two years. I would never, ever, buy an Apple device after working for them and knowing what I know about how they treat their customers.
Android is still better…
Apple is best technology in world.. android noob.. wakakakaka.. say no to android..
Just because they dont use split screen,  does it mean its a waste of feature? Whats the use of having a powerful processor. I do multitask most of the time, with buttery smooth on both apps.
Not objective...
@Mrwhosetheboss should be sleeping at the time of the shoot 😂😂😂
mkbhd is such an apple fanboy
I think apple bribed mkbhd... This is pathetic you guys were considered as most important tech influencers around the globe..
*Android left the lobby*
Display Android  Charging Android  Speed Android  Raw Power IPhone  Camera Tie Video Tie Software Tie Battery IPhone  Pricing Android  Support IPhone  Customization Android  Speakers Iphone   The Real Results
I think this video need some honest opinion, am I the only one who noticed that this video was not really about the OS (IOS vs Android) comparison cause no matter what it always seems like Android will never do better than IOS  which I think it's unfair. Rather than a meeting between 2 guys that are passionate for the same think and one being impressed  by the other one, It was almost like a celebrity being interviewed by his fun. Mrwhosetheboss, next time  let your opinion count.
I'm sorry, but there's some pretty heavy bias in this video. You're out of your mind if you think iOS walks away from Android like that. A measley 2 points? BS!
MKBHD choosing iphone over android? The irony is MKBHD have been giving best phone award for the past years and not a single iphone got that till now.
Mrwhosetheboss please please send me iPhone 13 pro max brother please
I think the video was on point. iPhone is much more refined in about every category.
This stark downplay on Android is disappointing. Unexpected and shocked. Let your business grow. Good luck
How can there be a tie between Samsung and iPhone on the software features category 😂😂😂
Just went from a OnePlus 10 Pro to IPhone 13 Pro max and I can promise you OnePlus feels smoother and faster with their 120hz, IPhone goes down to 60hz way to much
Not sponsored by Apple at all
I honestly think this is such a bad comparison. Clearly as a standalone device iPhone was supposed to be the clear winner when you have to cherry-pick between a bunch of android devices to compare it to. iPhone as a whole a device where android is just an Operating System. The better comparison would've been IOS vs Android or iPhone vs Pixel/Galaxy or any particulr android flagship
Arun in his mind -" what SE is value for money? "🙄.. Then realised that he is just an interviewer. Ok
Square body is probably my favorite thing about the iPhone and I’ve had Galaxy S8, 9, 10, 21, and 22
Saving grace!? Arun talking like Android still had a chance at winning 💀
Love both of you guys, but this felt more like a "Why you should buy an iPhone", rather than a comparison 👀. In my humble opinion 😅
You really vote for a draw when it comes to display? tbh it makes no sense when S22 ultra has more capabilities and the edge is a matter of person's favorite
Here Marques being an IPHONE fan and Arun  being a Marques fan. Both are discussing iphone vs android. Pretty disappointed with Arun's responses.
adrion have samsung galaxy m51 batery best.
Iphone is better , but only in different circumstances or situation only, The thing is. When the day is over android wins. By all circumstances.  Because its more user friendly than iphone. The thing you guys said is toatly arrogant. Dumb shit
Relax Android guys, This video was Not sponsored by Google
The reason iPhone got a lot of points is because it's comparing it to android itself and android has samsung which beats iPhone and can be seen in his other videos but android as a whole downgrades it's value because like they said there are phones like Nokia and Fairphone
You shouldn't have done this vedio. Bull fucking shit. What the score man . I love i phone but. This vedio is nonsense,  " APPLE PAYS GOOD" Dont be a tech influencer who wants to throw flour in peoples eye, Be an influencer as a great friend of your subcribers, Almost every one on earth sees tour vedio , so dont do it man , even i am your fan, i always search once in a week " mr whose the boss " for what , because of trust,  disappointed bruh. Total wastage vedio,  Give the money that Apple gave you to some poor. Because it stinks.
Day one of asking for a free samsung 32 5g
I don't know why MKBHD didn't tell like "see, whatever your question is I am gona stand with iOS" 🥴
I knew who would win before even watching the video. These two guys are iphone lovers so no wonder they would prefer iphone. Was annoyed watching them give lame excuses just to see prive iphone was better
The fact that I got an iPhone commercial before this video says it all lol
Biased
So Apple destroys mainly Samsung here. Good job
I was a huge Samsung fanboys. Now I hate them so much. They were mocking Apple then they have the balls to ditch charger!! I wish everyone follow what Brazil did with this SOB greedy ass corporation. Fanboys for both let them getting away with this type of shit saying it’s eco friendly.  If it’s eco friendly is ur business choice then stop making phone every year. Release a legitimate game changing after 2/3 years u SOB
Was this video made to promote iPhone? I can't even believe iPhone beat Android in battery 🔋. No iPhone can beat Android in battery 🤭🙅🏾‍♂️
biased
Your scoring sucks  Those who agree with me like here
I disagree with your reaction! The Galaxy S22 Ultra definitely has the better camera, longer battery life, more features, and at the end of the day, the more modern design without those Notch! Too bad I expected more from you🤷‍♂️
Like android
This is honestly one of the more biased videos on the topic. It generally makes sense, but to call iPhones sustainable is an utter lie. I don't understand how two YouTubers with 10 million + subscribers are so far removed from normal life that they think that it is okay to have Apple do everything in their possession to stop individuals from repairing the devices that they spent their own money on.  And no, Apple's self-repair program, a glorified PR stunt, does not count.
Does anyone else feel like MKBHD want iphone to win
Worst Video Of the boss 🥲
Its just a very bad review. These two are just promoting apple
Waoo. My two favorite tech-youtubers in the same room 🙂
a day later and lagdroid users still crying as the two biggest judges have spoken. time to call lagdroid... 2.5 devices LOOL
Apple sponsored this video just put in caption. This was biased and unfair video.
The two most annoying youtubers with their annoying hand gestures.
This is how apple's money influence on tech creators 💯
I never leave comments. But I'm only half way through the video and I feel like the comparisons were not fair at all..I think Arun makes more compelling comparisons alone... In this video...he just agrees
Ladies and gents what you just saw was the iphone show
S21 ultra gang gang lets gather here
I think it would have been a much better video if they both weren't biased towards iPhone
Wow, you totally skipped Google Lens as a useful and powerful app... Your point about Apple making better apps than the original ones; really, Apple maps.
Noooooooooooo…..This is clearly a jeopardised  response … I know that MKBHD is from USA and there are a large number of people are using not just iPhones but apple eco system, how ever if iPhone is best according to mkbhd then why he isn’t gave any awards to iPhones in his best phone of the year show???… this is either a marketing or mkbhd is simply supporting usa products 😂😂😂 coz he is from the same place  Also think Mr.Arun is bit neutral here compared to MKBHD
Really like very much you both in one frame 👌
This guys was mine fav tech Youtubers .I don't agree with this video . This guys sided with apple
Hey mkb if i phone is the best  Every year your  Give award to best  Phone the year then why are you not select iPhone as best . something to fish😂 now your promoting iPhone ha🤣🤣🤣
As an Android user, I absolutely agree with this assessmentl. I'm blessed in a household where we have both. Wife is all Apple with a MacBook, iPad, iPhone, Watch, and I use a Windows laptop and a Pixel. The way Apple devices talk to one another is incredible. But that's where it ends. Google does better with the space you're in. Smart speakers, cameras, thermostats, TV etc. The day Apple decides to add an option to select Google assistant as the default is the day I get an iPhone.
Aron x marquise
what about apple and slavery?
Sponsored by apple
Nah, this video is not it. By it's very nature, there's no way you can make it in less than an hour because there's just so much to talk about. It's so opinion driven and it seems like not much thought was actually put into it. Like how iPhones are really the least eco-friendly choice you can make, that's a topic you can really dive deep into.
My samsung a50 has mediocre battery and slow charging 😒😑🙄😐😪
Two my favorite tech youtubers in one screen😍😍
MKBHD is unfair to Android and also he forgot that he is on Android side
We've just watched two tech nerds talking about technology  but still entertaind us 😅🔥
I need dislike button 😂
My opinion on this: As long as I can't repair it at home, can't download third party software on it, and can't get used to its weird OS, I won't buy an Iphone. Even if it's camera is better, I won't even notice it, because nowadays every newer phones camera is good enough. But I would notice the annoyance of the Apple ecosystem, especially now, when I don't even get a charger. It is so with other things, like battery life or performance. And then the software features: Everything that's an advantage in an Iphone is either fully useless without other apple products, or available on android under a different name.
Marques is definitely more of an iPhone user than an android one
The thing about phones is that anyone can do a lot of things and fix so many crucial errors with both iOS and Android by jailbreaking and rooting their phones respectively. Customization additionally is not even a question after you jailbreak or root your phone.
so true about the camera experince iphone really feels more boring than pixel and some other anroid phones but it works prettier and is more stable
Android is clearly a winner
This discussion is quite biased. There are a lot of factors which are not being compared. With iPhone, you need apple PCs. But in Android, Samsung can connect with Dell Laptops and Vaio and everywhere. And this list goes on. Plus on the international level, Android has a bigger market than iPhone.
Biased.
Unfair comparison, should have compared Iphone and samsung or ios vs android.
Compatibility And reliability I think it's a huge win for Android  My experiences with iPhones has always been super poor, My Android on the other hand it cost around $300 has a pretty decent camera has a Mediatech G95 processor and a 8 GB of RAM, And with IPS LCD screen which is good for me because I hate OLED's and a 5000 milliamp hour battery, my phone is practically ran almost everything I've thrown at it however Wi-Fi calling is a bit glitchy but I'm okay with that for now, and overall compatibility with things is just really good too like the USB port I have literally played Minecraft with a PS3 and a PS4 controller hooked on to my phone with an adapter The track pad on the PS4 controller literally gives me a mouse on my screen which is pretty cool, I have connected my phone to controllers printers keyboards other computers and pocket PC's, USB drives Arduinos and a lot more and it has been fine, A FREAKING PROGRAM IN A ARDUINO MICROCONTROLLER ON MY PHONE! And I already used a micro SD card to boost my phone storage by 128 gigabytes, and well air drop on the other hand I don't really care about because I can already just send files to my other devices with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi so it's not really inconvenience and kids in my school is even bullying and pranking with it so I'm glad to not be a part of it, and Apple products work the best with other Apple products they force you into their community while Android just kind of work with everything even Arduino's and Raspberry pi's, even technology that's well out of date look at my username I know! And I also customize my gestures by applications and launchers to access things much easier than before. And if you're someone smarter than me then you could quite literally just get rid of Android on your Android phone and put another OS on their, Pricing people replace Android with Linux Windows for arm edition Raspbian, And if you're even smarter than you could probably just program your own operating system. My phone has been a lot more for me than I would ever expect with an iPhone, and I have done very similar things with other phones so my phone is definitely not special with its abilities.  My phone is the BLU G91 Max, but at a phone with pretty good specs at around $300 compromises have to be made so the class on the screen is kind of brittle so I recommend using the screen protector but that's it. It comes with a rugged case and a screen protector including a charger in the box so you're going to be fine.
To be fair to you Arun this video has a lot of western biases. For instance do you think the average african would ever care for an iphone if not for stasus?
Wtf is eco consciousness? Is this a joke??  I do love how you guys can properly articulate your thoughts tho. Lovely watch!
This seems to be a apple promotion... Feel pathetic to the two world famous tech reviewers.. I can't even watch this completely.. seems weird when you blindly support apple.. 👎 anyway iPhone fanboys love it 🙂
I'm the person who goes for Android. Cz it's clean & simple
I can see arun not agreeing with him😂
What a complete farce.   This is like asking: what’s better, burgers or every other food, and then saying “yeah but burgers have more beef than salad so I’m awarding the point to the burger”.
I have owned a lot of phones; I used to love HTC, then I found Apple but then I dived back into Android on occasion. I currently have S22 Ultra and the iPhone 13 Pro. I love a lot of things about the Samsung... but I would give the edge to the iPhone as more intuitive and more user friendly for the average phone/camera/streaming person. That said, I think the marking should have been a lot closer than how it was done here, personally. The S22 Ultra is a beast of a phone.
Great video man, your such a perfectionist. It was great fun. The only thing i hate about iPhone is the icons and folders. So much waste of space and huge icons ...
I don't really see the point of this subject - iphone vs Android. It's in the end subjective and upon personal preferences. I never used and never will use an iPhone even if blah blah blah iPhone wins over Android in this and that category. Downright I refuse to use it because I don't want to be in the apple eco-system and iPhone doesn't offer the value/specs I want - they are expensive. I can find a reasonably priced decent all rounder Android phone while the same things only offer on flagship iPhone. I always use Windows laptops and smart TV. Tell me what I will use for better compatibility.
Well, I thought MKBHD reviewed phones for everyone. But what he said was his personal bias because he is a hardcore Apple supporter. Plus, no one mentioned Pixels. Yes Apple can stand out a lot sometimes. But there is a clear bias in MKBHD's POV. No one went into the options for reparability, costs and all. I don't know how to put it. But even though Apple is doing the best they can, most of the innovations are happening in the Android gadget space. For everyone here, let me get this out there. Getting/ Switching to an android is like getting a chilled out room mate. Getting/ Switching to an Apple is like getting a high maintenance partner.
Felt sad watching this video, 2 of my favorite tech YouTubers being unreasonable. Sure iphone might be a better all around package but Android deserves more. It's also amazes me that mkbhd never picked iphone as the smartphone of the year.
3:35 this. i love scrolling apps back and forth, the animations and the feature, and oh boy i do love when the keyboard wont hide when switching apps on android, it always hides the keyboard, on iOS it kinda flickery tries to, but no, the keyboard stays, so if you typing some credit card or any similar long numbers, itsa very useful to have the keyboard stay put to type the info in ur messenger app
There is no A SUB TO THE CHANNEL WOULD BE 😢😅😂
Can I get the red magic man tbh it's cool🥲😂😂😂
Really iphone for photos for thr rest of your life😠...I hav both s22 ultra and iPhone 13 pro max...I always use my Samsung to take photos..It's very versatile in all situation I can't say the same about iPhone tho😶
Battery for iPhone 🤣  ആർക്കും സംശയം ഒന്നും ഇല്ലല്ലോ അല്ലേ
MKBHD was not being neutral
I wanna scream!  Two of my favorite YouTubers in the same room ... Yaaaaaaay
The video should've been iOS best v/s Android best. Basically a biased video sponsored by Apple.
No one  Personal preference : Am I a joke to you?
Important criterion: would you rather support the Chinese regime with its many, many crimes, or would you rather support a democratic country, South Korea - yes, with its own problems, but not to be compared with China in the least. I think that is a huge point in Samsung's favour.
sponsored by APPLE 🍏 🤣
Yethanu eee chegayi.... Iphone kop
Worst Collab to promote iPhone boo!! Arun
iPhone has better optimised os. That's the only thing. Hardware wise, other than the processor, iPhone doesn't hold a candle to Android flagships. That's a fact. And if MKBHD considers iPhone so better, why is his awards shying away from iPhones? Felt like a video sponsored by Apple tbh.
Dex is awesome!!
I didn't like the comparisons you made in this video.  You pretty much only used the best iPhone for comparisons, but used a variety of Androids.
Smartphone Awards 2021!  you both chose android over iPhone 13 🤔
😐
MLBHD IS LIKE HE IS SUPPORTING IPHONE I don’t know why 🤢
I  do often use the Multi Window feature and I really don't like that notch design. I love the Squared Display of the Galaxy and yes flat Screen would be perfect, but I don't mind that. Therefore the S22(+) would be the perfect phone design-wise, but I love my Note 10+! I often use the S-Pen and things like split Screen, Pop-Up Window and more. I would like the S22 Ultra, if it would be more wide, like the screen is smaller compared to my Note 10+.
I love this video, you two should working together more often. I hope you are doing well.
This is wrong  this was a paid promotion
If you picked an Android phone for photos, Sony has the phones with the best cameras lol
lets say your mother cooks you yours fav cookies every saturday and your fav pie every Wednesday! but then one day your mom cooks both for you as a surprise! thats what im feeling today , someday few times before , MKBHD and Mrwhosetheboss together! ❤️❤️❤️
it's a paid sponsored video by Apple. Who are agree with me?  give me thumbs up.
Android is much better.
All these triggered fandroids  🤣
Wasn't Arun supposed to be in bed by 23:00?
A lot of butt hurt people in this comment section
When two Apple fanboys sit down to talk.
I like how customizable android is. My home screen is 2 apps and a transparent clock widget. Swipe left I have 4 folders and Google search bar and 2 other apps swipe right and I have my calendar.
Unfortunately both u guyz are biased...nd we the normal audience think u guys are tanked with apple with tonz of 💰..spcially MKBHD, really after all these years pickup for best phone from his side not awarded for any of this iphone...u just need to understand the fact ios and android and 2 ecosystems developed which have there own cons and pros...customisation really sucks for iphone yet u guys supporting dem ...common aaron atleast u should speak the fact mbkhd from 🇺🇸 have to support iphone mayb he is paid well...nyhow iam unsubscribing u both guys for the biased shit reviews...nd my subscription wont b matter for you guys until nd unless several like me gonna think u guys are a part of fake reviews after paid well...good luck in future
Ultra pro max plus version of a paid content, kudos.
You life changing progress is looking amazing... Keep up
Very biased video. unsubscribing even though i didn't subscribe
Wtf is this... I expected this from mkbhd aka apple fan boy.😐
These reviewers are clearly biased towards Apple, I like both android and iOS but most of these points are invalid. Both of them say its fact but in reality its their opinion.  Im not gonna even bother following them anymore, I want an unbiased review not a biased review
I think Android has a lot of features i wish IOS had, of course also expandable memory, but for performance IOS has always been super reliable and a smooth experience, even with my ipad 5th gen i get this in comparison with my newest Android phone
Probably giving it more depth by including more sections like durability, repair cost, cost of ownership, cross-compatibility (type C?), etc would have made things more interesting. Also this doesn't feel like a 20 minute discussion topic. So, may be you can consider repeat episodes, especially after some new phones get released.
Pick your poison.
the black guy is so biased he's just an apple fan since iphone built his career. I have both iphone and android and apple is very limited and useless in a lot of times
Maybe a draw...or Android is better. Apple never be a winner.
Plus for Android : connectivity lasts. Filenames from your Photos are date and time. Nfc works with 3rd party Hardware, sidebar, flatter and denser, bigger screens, no fking faceid.. I love my ipad but i am glad i had my iphone 12 just for a year and Switched back
No matter how much Android or ios is better, most of the ios users use an android phone like backup phone or whatsoever, they need an android phone for some work which ios cannot do or their ecosystem dont allowed us to do and this explains which is better.
It felt pretty baised
Seems like an ad for apple🤔  like they are forced to tell all this,as per a script.
The chemistry is not organic, I love them both tho.
This was Epic no cap ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Could you do Apple vs Samsung (exclusively)
Rip android 💀
Hi, You can not call this Android V Iphone & then dismiss all Android phones except ones that fit your argument. The whole benifit of Android is that depending on what you want there is a phone for you. With the Iphone there is no choice. You have not done a fair comparison of ANDROID Vs Iphone as in almost every catagorey there is an Android that can do better then Iphone. You seem to have only used the Android that best fit your argument not the best Android for the argument. Sorry but this comparison is not one of your best efforts & I am a Fan.
Mkbhdb, you never gived 1st  stand to iphone, like both are difft, simply by saying best user experience and connectivity, and for usage rather than show off, android is the best, and samsung s22 is super, no dought in that never will be, according to cuurent situation, and also iphone is not value for money never will be, and also same dezine, old tech, over over priced, people who wotks hard and want to save money, they will never go to iphone,
you can tell just how much of an MKBHD fanboy Arun is 😂 love this for him 😂
Both you guys IPhone user and IPhone fan how fucking  deciding
I've had my A70 for about 2 years, still haven't enabled bixby
Google duo in Android is way better than FaceTime.  Wtf is mkbhd saying!!! Customisation is better in iPhone 😂😂😂
I was waiting for you to say it’s all upto personal preference
Don't be Iphone biased man. . according to me   Display: Android ( no notch, s22 series displays are whole another level ) Battery: definitely Android (fast charging) Photos: Again Android Customisation: 100% Android reliability : A tie  Pricing : Android ( my kidney is safe with me)
The fact that Apple makes it so hard to get apple devices repaired/serviced is a huge win for Android.
Wasn't that comfortable... anybody sensed it
Apple buys MKBHD😂
I loved this video so much. The vibes are great, it felt like sitting down and having a conversation with a couple other tech nerds. But gosh, if you're going to do another one, please fix the lighting! The glare on your heads and shoulders was INTENSE.
😒👎🏻😑
Was this a promo for iphone? 😂😂
How much u get from apple company$$
Iphone guy vs Android guy
If only apple iphone would allow proper management of photos. Like really moving photos to different folder rather than just duplicating it.  It would be the best
I like it when it stops wireless charging cuz my iponhe is almost 100% or a 100% and it cools of and I don’t know this but if it is still charging on a 100% does it stil use elektricitie cuz if yes it better if no it’s not that good then but still fine I don’t mind it
Brilliant video guys!  Really enjoyed this, two of my favourite tech guys together.  As for iPhone features, I would add Apple Watch integration and iPod  integration across platforms.  Hugely used by me anyway.  I think it's great Android phones are out there doing great things, and my all-time favourite phone is android too (HTC One) but my iPhone 13 Pro Max is the best phone I have ever owned.
Which used old flagship would be best to grab ? Huawei p30 pro, oneplus 7, xiaomi mi 9t, oppo find x ?
Please don't buy a refurbished phone. I've worked for companies that refurbish phones, and I can tell you that getting a good one is a lottery. The quality control is poor, the batteries aren't new and in many cases the phones aren't cleaned.
The white guy wears white . and the black guy wears black . wow 😳
Semi related my mom took a cool photo of the moon on her s21 ultra and was blown away.
''Is Fortnite overrated?'' vibes
I think it depends on the person which better.  My first smartphone was a Windows Nokia phone and when I had to change I talked to people who had Apple 🍎 and 'Droid.  I chose 'Droid and today I still hear some of the complaints about 🍎 I heard then.  In my opinion the higher the price the less features it has that I want.
I can’t seem to get over the fact that the iPhone won the point for customisation 🤔 i still think there are far greater points to talk on rather than what was talked about here, of which repair and maintenance costs should’ve been one.
At the end of the day, it really comes down to personal preference and everyone has a different preference! Android makes iPhone better, iPhone makes Android better. I don't limit myself to either iOS or Android, I use both. Great video! 😀
Biased
no cell phone for me they is evil !!!
mkbhd riding iphone D
After watching this video one can think the iPhone is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than Android but in real life it is very neck to neck and no phone should win by this margin
Is this an Apple sponsored video
Dumb apple fan boys
seems kinda sponsored
Lol was this side by side comparison or just about iOS
Iits the first time I felt you have posted something by someone else and to be honest I cannot completely agree with it.. feels kinda strange .all felt like a personal choice rather than facts.
The hotel lighting was not the only clue, you guys should have 100% avoided making this video. Was quite boring.
Apple sponsored video
MKBHD seems biased to iPhone
Biased video
The British mkbhd and the American mrwhosetheboss
2.5 Vs 7.5 🤔🤔🤔 This result just proves one thing :  Those two are apple fan boys 🐦🐦🐦
The final decision depends on a person’s choice….😊
even though iphones are better, i just... really liked them.
When Screen quality was a tie, I knew it was just going to the iPhone
As an Android user, I agree with most of this. iPhones are safe which would appeal to most people. The problem is it's so basic and boring for enthusiasts. I've been spoiled with folding and customized gestures that I can't go back to a basic phone anymore. We are a small minority that Apple will never cater to.
Do not say it’s most disliked.
Best apple 🍏 ad ...
Is this android vs iphone or samsung vs iphone?
So weird that despite the fact they ask which is better, you still get to answer the questions yourself!!
They are comparing iPhone which doesn't have mid-range phones to the average Android which has a lot of mediocre phones
Mkbhd paid by iPhone well. I no longer consider mkbhd as a genuine tech reviewer.
I have SE😂
I can't decide they both seem really good! 😻❤️🦶🦶🦶🦶🔥
I think MKBHD is too biased towards iPhone. He couldn't think of any advantage in android OS over IOS? Come on!
This guy is a apple promoter . Don't deeply believe a brand it kills you . Never seen best smartphone award gives to apple from this guy. now he is saying everything is apple there is scam
having less then 50% battery after 24h??? what is that :-D i love my 10000mAh and dont care that the phone is 370g
Reliability goes to iPhone come on! Customization goes to Android! This is the typical battle of Mac OS X VS Windows...  No firefox extensions on iOS devices. Some Android devices are also easier to lock down for security reasons.   But  Apple devices will continue to better overall since they are specifically designed and optimized for Apple hardware.   Unless Sony uses their Playstation hardware or  maybe Nintendo gets into the market of "Smart Phones", I don't see any better devices out there for mobile phones.
I like Samsung better
You spoke about apple using recycled materials but not about being the most anti repair company
Looks like mkbhd is biased towards apple.
Paid Promotion
Very disappointing to see people like him doing biased review. I wonder why didn't Apple win any of his best phone of the year awards, if Apple is so good.
All the points came to Iphone ? With apple slow Hardware technology ?  I really hate to say this , but Marques looks like being paid by Apple..I bet Marques gonna wait for the ip14pm to make a video "best phone 2022" (well ip14pm was meant be a flagship for 2023)
iphone wins cause they are in california
Feel a like you guys took money from Apple..  Espessially mkbhd
This is the worst video u have ever uploaded till now. No more words
This video makes me happy with my judgement of, of u have the money get an iphone otherwise get an android
Apple is a handheld contradition. It is supposed to be the best but Android phones keep folding them in 2 every time, especially the hardware. Apple is 5 years behind.
S22U has the best screen clearly.  How come its a tie ? MKBHD say its Smooth touch? S22u=240hz touch sampling rate. IP13pm=120hz . even from from the start of this video, the first one already been wrong. its all comes from MKBHD opinions not this world real tech.
This is a great collab! But some aspects can be added to the table to make it greater. Accessories, how cheap it is to maintain and repair the phone, some costs from subscriptions, and how versatile the phone environment. While iPhone demolished in the video, these factors may balance the point since many of the arguments were based on very idealistic condition. In a work place where some or even many of the devices aren't in the apple environment, the versatility of Android might be a game changer. It would even be heavily one sided in growing nations since apple environment is considered expensive. Overall, the video is good for a guideline on buying phone, for an ideal-living person.
Guys you know i love you both but this video would be such a better experience if you had less commercials during it…..🤷‍♂️ Loved it and all but….ok thanks!!!
MKBHD appale fanboy.....
Clickbait title. The half point stuff was absolute nonsense, I expected more from these two. Just a whole lot of iPhone D*** riding because all these guys really do is use social media apps, take pictures and decided yeah iPhones better at this so it's the better phone 😂😂 where is the category  on customising the phone? Making it your phone instead of rows of apps? Or all the amazing features android has many years prior but iPhone introduce in 2020-2022 like its the most amazing thing ever. "we have widgets now" yeah, welcome to 2011,you are LITERALLY 10+ years late.
The title should've said" Which is better , ACCORDING to Arun Maini and Mkbhd"
Samsung Vs IPhone?
my man only uses iphone
When you don't want hurt your freind and follows yes or no with him this is what result will be
Android feels more like a work phone and Apple is a social phone. If I were the boss of a company and gave out phones, I would choose Android due to cost and customization. So it really depends on your needs.
There is a Android phones for every type of people. That is a 10/10 advantage of a Android phones
Another video where I wish i could see the amount of dislikes
In short ... You get more of a phone for less price when it comes to Android... I still fail to see any reason to convert to ios and leave all the comfort the android offers
You're looking really radiant dude i think going healthy is working really well for you
Yeah gotta love genshin impact playing game 😌
Big fan I really want a iPhone 13 pls big fan
Android has AirDrop equivalent..
MKBHD is iphone fan boy
How about Tablet which is better
Mkbhd is saying bs android has phones that beat all the good thing an iphone has I will only buy android in my life
Nobody can deny tht is Iphone the best smartphone in the world... Trust me
I think iphone camera is overrated
iPhones used to struggle a lot with battery life, but now they've caught up. Still have no idea why they're not Type C, considering the fact that Apple was actually part of the people that helped design the Type C port.
IOS   👎👎👎👎   This statement is not 💯💯  I'm desapoint....    Camera image android phone is the king 22ultra., 80pro.., pixl.., etc... Nd Dsply.. Refresh rate., extra feature like pen in 22ultra and MOREOVER MOREOVER CUSTOMAISATION... AND lot of things in here android is the clear winner 👍👍 For me...  Android:: 7.5 IOS        ::  2.5   I have to say something but i don't know english very well...
Samsung
I think the android is best, UK, USA most using phone is iPhone, i think . But In other country different both company phones using.  My opinion is android. My personal think. Charging is best android type C Charging port and fast charging..... Best. Camera is best s22 ultra is amazing also iPhone camera. But iPhone have no Type C port and no fast charger🥴🥴.  I like android.  My personal opinion that's all😄😊😊
This was literally an apple paid for ad  So biased. Y'all know nothing about the underlying tech
Android does have 'Airdrop' and it's called 'Nearby share' and if I'm not wrong, it's had it for longer, but even if not, both have it
I still feel like marquis is still on the  apple side even if it is something of clear disadvantage
I switched to iPhone 13 pro max, just for the battery life, especially as heavy battery user. Will I ever switch side? once any Android do better, no doubt I will switch. But yeah both have their good and bad sides, I’m more comfortable with Android
Hiii bro Iam your biggest Fan And Iam from Pakistan my name is Ayan Qabulio and am 12 years old and Iam a Artist And I wanted to be youtuber and vlogger And gamer But I don't have a good phone not a gaming setup and a camera Iam very sad so what did I do😭
MKBHD..  last tym u give award to Samsung S 21Ultra.... I think I didn't seen any award u given to iphone..   but I feel like this is iphone promotion vdo😂😂
Did Arun just make a video without a Rick-roll or did I just miss it? 🙂
I feel like even if Arun disagreed with MKBHD they would still give the category in MKBHD's favour Arun himself said he preferred Androids photography over the iPhones same as batter because of fast charging in my opinion such categories should have been a draw or should have been more debated upon
The issue with this test or comparison, is how one is made for hundreds of models of phones with Open Source and the other is catered for only a select that rock the same Closed Source.   IPhone is like I want the customer to have better this: limit things whether the customer likes it.   Android: Eh, do whatever. Lol
Cant believe my boy Arun flew across the ocean to come and make a 20 min video for us, respect ✊🏿 brother
Android is totally harmed in this video🙂
Is no one going to mention how iOS still can’t have icons wherever you want them to be?
I don't agree that iphone has better display that samsung s22 ultra
Really unfair
Markus says all the good about iPhones and he is using S21 ultra?? 🤔🤔
It's always samsung best
10.7 🙂👌
All hindu people support this YouTuber, Mr. Arun is a fellow HINDU 🙏🙏🙏
The fact that my Android phone crashed at the end of the video 🤣
i swear I am using a iphone 12.. but when i saw the s22 ultra.. my mind went LA la la.. just wow
This video is sponsored by ...
I thought he know every thing about tech....but he don't know nothing....!
Lol I think u got money from APPLE 🙏🙏
bruh... comeon.. is this for real??
Is very clear that MKBHD is Defending apple at all Coast 😂, the vibrator of Samsung u can set the intensity He forgot how to do it 😅
As an apple user and have an android phone, i have a doubt, How much money the Apple paid you?
This is business because Apple promotion
Shazzam kand vennavar undo
In my thoughts iphone only good for video all other things about iPhone they're saying very stupidity
Don't fool people apple is not that good
Sir bigfan sir
I thought I was going crazy with the vibration on the s22 ultra where I couldn't feel it or even notice it ..but it's not just me ... 🤔🤔
draw kis baat ke liye beee
Daily average user experience, android is a better choice for me. It takes good pictures, videos, it's more user friendly and the fact that you can almost immediately transfer files between you PC or Mac and an android device just using your USB cable without needing an extra software is underrated. If you can get the flagship androids you won't notice any difference in performance with an iPhone on average usage. The likes of facetime and airdrop won't be missed by an android user who has a whole lot of apps that performs similar functions and file sharing using wifi is not bad either. Add charging to this list, you can literally use one charging brick for almost all your gadgets with USB C and fast charging on android is underrated. Imagine being on trip and you just have like 30mins before departure and your phone is on 10%, some androids can get you between 60 - 70% in that 30mins. Overall experience goes to android imo.
Bro what the f. Literally the only reason IPhone is winning is because mkmhd hates android and he has never used it. And to the recycle part, That an easy win for android. Apple literally says the charger is good for the environment,but its worse. I know samsung and min does that too busy mostly they dontm.......mm
How much you got from tim
Payed review 😤😤
Me still watching this on a fairly stable one plus 5t with pixel experience plus on Android 12 . Waiting for the Nothing phone
MKBHD is a fanboy
Apple is better for a lot of reasons than Android in general but then again Android in itself is so diverse in its availability of options that its really on the premise of what sort of user the person is. For me personally, I stick with Android since it allows for a lot of tension free possibilities when it comes to using APKs or cross-platform options and ease of accesibility. So the iPhone is great but the Apple ecosystem is a bummer imo.
I love you guys and the content ❤️  but mkhd is higher than a kite thinking iphones screen compares with the s22 ultra screen. No notch, screen to body ratio, brightness, clarity, vibrance, size, and able to have the ltpo drop down to 1htz  Not to mention when consuming video content zoomed in to fill out the screen, Samsungs screen ratio cuts off significantly less of the video.
Title of this video must be, iPhone features praise
Love your colabs with MKBHD.
What about repairability every part is coded the specific iPhone. Changing Components is planned not to be easy. It would be better to the Environment when the hardware locking for older iPhones would be removed. If I buy an apple Device, i must have the right to sell or give away them after a couple of years, without finding every hidden button to make it harder for the next user.
everyone made this seems more biased than it actually is. There is bias, don't get me wrong, and there's nothing wrong with which you prefer, but this feels blown out of proportion. Solid work you two.  Edit: I think the point system was unnecessary and was probably what caused such a commotion.
Finally an honest comparison
This video feels more like iphone vs s22, not android vs ios but still great video
I phone = shite
Invisible title *sponsored by apple
totally biased lmao
Do u have any merch coming i am obsessed with ur videos  i watch like six a day every day  i need u to have merch please
On eco friendly iPhone also has better longevity. I was using a second-hand iPhone 6s until very recently, on the latest OS with very few issues.
Looks like MKBHD got paid for this one
I don't think iphone should be the winner. If you talk about the diffrence between app store and play store, the diffrence between  android is the clear winner here. Iphone dosen't let you download apps to from a broswer or anything else. If you are a gamer you should have an android.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 how much is Apple paying you? Try to use an iPhone in Poland in Polish, you will change your mind
IPhone 14 Pro will be my next phone, and my first iPhone ever.
wow. so bad review. didn't think Marques would be this wrong about reviewing. Battery gose to apple?? my A**
Totally agree 👍
Biased video disappointed
I have both phones an S22 Ultra and an Iphone13 Max, it is not even close the Samsung kills the iphone.  These dudes are just Iphone fanatics not a good review at all
😤😤😤🤬🤬🤬👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
I know you guys think this is a scientific approach, but it's really not! Such a one sided video by two stalwarts of tech review industry.
👎👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Senseless Dumb af Misleading Bullshit opinion Glad i left watching both creators months ago.  They no longer provide any good informative content.  Twitter gets heated that's why I watched this video.  Might be most disliked tech video for sure.
really sorry to say this but this was a miss in my book. A bit sad to see this much bias from my top 2 tech reviewers. Definitely think that a lot of the categories where android would be a clear winner werent mentioned, and when there were ties, android shoudlve been a winner, whereas when apple lacked, it was made a tie. kinda expected better.
Android is phone. Apple is Luxury gadget. end of discussion 👍
Unfair fight
12:53 I think the problem is not that android don't has those kind of features, because it has. It's just, that people don't use them. There is Nearby Share and QuickShare, Link to Windows, Google duo and videocalls only for samsung(a bit like factime), smart view, thr equivalent to airplay and you can share music with other people to listen to it the same time. The people just don't use it because no one knows about it.
I watch both of you guys all the time and I was expecting something different...  So let me get this straight... There are more Android devices than iPhones in use around the globe, yet the iPhone is better because it's good at doing a few things it does better? Like I have and use both, but the limits imposed by iPhone, from file system to not being able to run a wifi analyzer, still make it a better OS? Apple catches up and gets credit?  Speaking of what's better, Beta and HD-DVD were both better, IMO.
Biased
😤🥱🤬
Amazing collaboration 👍
Marques is blind iphone fan boy. Disappointed with the rating
Repair should also be a category. Which is easier to repair?
Apple products are always best to me
I also like flat display
security???
Bro I think it’s dunb that the iPhone would “leave a dent in my hand” when I think who tf would Carry around a $1200 device with the risk of dropping it!!! 🤯🤯
how can iphone win the battery cathegory when every single person which ask for a charging  able is a iphone use? android batterys hold so much longer than iphones....
I Unsubscribed  from MKBHD  (NEVER WILL SUPPORT A LAIR)  HATE u   How could u sell us
unsubscribed from both of you two!! a waste of time this video!
Hello sir Reply pls
Im a big fan of mkbhd But this is disappointing.. Wholly biased
Average people use : android  Not average people use: iphone  This whole video is pointless for average people 🤣.
iPhone's are for rich people . Android you can get as low as $150
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS SPONSORED 🤷🏿‍♂️
Lol you said FaceTime FaceTime has to do with Facebook and to top it all off Google has something Google Duo that always video calls
MKBHD UR WORK FOR APPLE ( BIG  F LAIR)
Very biased. The iPhone isn’t that great
bro seriously , why were you shaking and trumbling and looked like you were meeting a IDOL/ Celebrity ,   we could see in your body language and even in face!
i've used Motorola for ever from Startac to G200 models everytime i go buy a new phone i see the M logo it attracts me
Customization- One UI
I'm watching 2 YouTuber favorite MKBHD & mrwhos but this video is fail.  Y iPhone 7.5 Mark  Cemra iPhone y iPhone iPhone iPhone  this not Android vs iPhone clear video  this promotion video  Android s22 ultra power pixel 6 pro nice phone  Plzz make your opinion not promotion openion Thankyou
I value both of you and have been long time sub to both channels. Obviously have been watching MKBHD because he has been around a bit longer. He missed an opportunity talking about eco-friendly. Right to repair was not mentioned and I can get batteries and screens for my pixels and they are EASY to repair... I phone seldom does well in a category like that.
Isn’t this iPhone vs literally any other phone in existence?
Interesting to see that marques supporting the iphone so much that it felt like he's biased to apple. Also he's never given a phone of the year award to an iphone. If the iphone is so good then why didn't it win the phone of the year? (Last year's phone of the year was S21 ultra)
*ANYONE FROM CALLME SHAZAM REACTION VIDEO*
Apple doesn't pay me for advertising. One thing I can tell you for sure is that Samsung beats Iphone in every chapter. I have an Iphone 13 max pro, and the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra that I bought, neither Samsung nor Apple gave me as a gift. Samung 22 Ultra is the phone for the whole day, and Apple is the backup. This discussion is under the dignity of the two.
After everything it all comes down to your own personal thinking. I think Android's got more advantages and it's better.🚶🏾‍♂️ Even MrWhosetheboss knows the power of Android but he doesn't seem to want to admit it in this video 🤔
Apple clearly wins the battery life segment when you want monster battery and mediocre charging (fun note: my friend disables his _25W fast charge_ on his S20FE, _MK's phone of 2020,_ cuz the fast charge makes him think that the battery _has deteriorated_ and he starts to get anxious of it lol) but that's for Apple's Promotion LTPO on its slightly-better-than-FHD+ display. There are phones that are 2K OLED at 120Hz _without LTPO/VRR_ *neither YouTuber tested* which have slightly worse battery life. And it costs _less than 429_ lmao
Samsung is ahead on using 100% recycled packaging materials, and eliminating all plastic within its smartphone boxes
I don't buy the whole "eco friendly" take. Any phone that's not repair friendly is NOT eco friendly. Also from their part of the world their take may be accurate, but for the rest of the world not so much. Aside from the US, who uses iMessage/Facetime? And then there's USB-C...no need to explain why.
shills
I believe MKBHD have given phone of the year to Android phones. And now a huge jump to Apple suddenly!!!! Why?
Blu is 75% recycled materials and has been like that since Blu avalanche 4.0 came out in 2008
Totally disappointed.... MKBHD is pure apple biased guy....
I don't kniw what you say Android and apple  both are nice But 7.5-1.5 not correct
Then why mkbhd gives award to Samsung s21 ultra ,has not given any awards to iPhone yet.
I think apple promotion vedio because full iPhone support
Both gentlemen are entitled to there opinions and what works for them but I prefer Android
MKBHD is a Apple/ iPhone fanboy, hence proved.
Totally agree
Did I missed that this video is paid shoot by Apple 😜, he might said it but i didn't listen 🤔
Its super suprising that MKBHD gives yearly best phone award to Android but select Iphone as winner in all categories discussed here... even though its his personal view ..i felt like he is brand ambassdor for iphone promotion on  this video. 🤷‍♂️
And what about privacy?
Blu phones has auto save for pictures so you have your pictures with you right after you take them and it a android phone
Camera  point gose to iphone 🤥. That was Paid Promotion
Android for me......
Most of the people buy phone in what others see  So most are buying iphone
🤡🤡🤡🤡
It's like @mkbhd has a tie-up with iPhone. he is fully supporting iPhone. in mkbhd videos, we can see he is giving the best phone of the year to Samsung s22 and all, but now suddenly some influence towards the iPhone. anyway, it was so bad that he is keeping Samsung so low.
Seems soo much biased. Kind of like an Apple promotion.
Apple can’t be beat
For galaxy phones, biggest feature for me is bixby routines, I have several profiles and routines that changes settings of the phone through out the day.
i know it's a personal opinion but it's not right to promote one brand or one eco system. Everything isn't perfect. it's not good promoting one brand like this as the world's most trusted two tech youtubers are doing this. ❤️‍🩹💔
After being part of this channel for over five years, I have finally unsubscribed permanently because I can't stand this bias. I am an iPhone user (13 Pro) but there are just some areas where you guys don't make any sense at all. A friend of mine has a Galaxy S22 Ultra and I can admit that his phone takes better pictures than my iPhone, but for some reason you guys gave that category to the iPhone. I'm honestly disappointed.  This channel ain't what it used to be.
I have both an S22 Ultra and a 13 Pro Max....the one I use constantly is the S22 Ultra because I am an avid s-pen user. I also prefer the camera on my Samsung and multitasking.  Yes, the battery is better on the iPhone, but then again I  use it less, since my heavy lifter is the S22 Ultra.
In terms of performance does no one talk about storage and connection stability here? Justify buying 64GB for iPhone SE 2022 and iPhone 12 for 429+. "3GB RAM on an iPhone feels like 8GB on Android", seems true, but 64GB ROM is 64GB ROM and one signal bar is one signal bar, and the anxiety is real compared to the RAM performance
Marques activated my Cortana, lol 😂.
MKBHD is such an iphone fan boy
iphones are pure garbage
As an android user, I do love apple's camera, specially the built in long exposure when you are around waterfall or wanna capture some movement in the pictures
lol I phone is best but I don't have
you said androids iPhones apple is mad right now
So...the colors? Is it green because apples are green? Which points do...oh no its blue for iphone 😳 ahm...can we get logos please? 😅 i dont have a clue whos winning
nice video, but this topic of debate is kind of stale and pointless nowadays... there's no "BETTER" phone, just what suits you the most
I choose android cause i dont want an oven or a microwave in my hands like my Mac can melt a chocolate man
Paid promotion 🤭🤭
Display:android  Perfomance:iphone  Battery:android Photography:android Videographer:iphone  Software reliability :draw Software features: draw Software support: iphone Pricing: android  Android :5 iphone 4
The Bias of apple is strong with Marques
Interesting comparison, but any mild analisys of the video, including if's, but's, language, tone, text content(and omissions), etc. shows the clear bias towards the iphone. I love it, but this is not iphone vs android, it feels like a paid promotion. I want an iphone so badly, but I will be stuck to android for as long as apple locks up their ecosystem. Any major corporation learns this in the very first days: Apple is a banned brand, for this specific reason. The wait continues. Keep it up!
there is one huge thing about the iphone security: everyone you dont even know with your phone-number can send you a called "crash code" if few cases your phone shuts down as you recieve the message your phone wont turn on somethimes those codes work with ram blocking and are really easy to build/use this is someting big i think those codes also dont work for android because android has a blocker to that...
But always Android is best 😁
I think Mkbhd is a paid promoter of iPhone. Liar 🤥
All I saw in this video, is a competition of OCD
eco friendly until its broken... i miss old phones with swappable batteries like LG G4 for example
Iphone so bad phones that not have value for money samsung s22 ultra is god phone .why are you saying iPhone is good it is a bad phone . All Phones  are good  . I thinks apple companys are money for them I think so bad 😥 i am also fan boy they two people are creating nice video till this video before i don't like this video so bad 😥 Android phone are good phones
Comparison with S22 Ultra is morethan enough to compare with Andriod vs IOS,  BTW from there video they have admitted s22 ultra is best phone. From here it's really feels a paid promotion. Good content creators should be passionate on profession moreover...
Android is the best
Excellent video guys. Really shows the different POV on the features and one's needs.   i have tried dozens of Android phones over the years but always need to come back to iPhones because my friends and relatives have iPhones and iMessage and Facetime are anchors
MKBHD : No more questions. Just iPhone's 🤦🤦🤦
Feels like mrwhosetheboss expected the conversion to go a little differently 😁
Surely mkbhd is support iPhone where phone it's always samsung wins but he boring
I use the split screen feature for my classes when I'm away from computer, it works really well, i would have zoom and my notes simultaneously
mkbhd is becoming boring
Who prefers Android!
Two of my favorite YouTube Creators and this is the first video from either of the channel that I've disliked. 😔
It’s basically iphone 13 pro max vs samsung s22 ultra
This video looking weirdest one I ever seen... This not true... this made for paid promotion 😡
the thing is the video is comparing iphone 13 pro max to the whole android industry. battery life for example non pro version of iphone they have both poor battery life and slow charging compared to excellent charging and battery for counter parts android.
Glad I already unsubscribed from this channel. I find this comparison very biased towards person preference rather than actual objectivity.
I go with Samsung or VIVO for photography... It looks more realistic...
Oh Android is clearly better at this, let's call it a draw. *Slow claps* 🤦🏻‍♂️
Basically you're in an environment thats already fallen into the apple eco system. Air drop, i message, face time, everything. Your location thus becomes i phone biased cuz once they enter it there's barely any chance of shifting to android. Say you are in a country where apple isn't the hype, barely has an ecosystem built up, i guess some points may totally shift. Also it's not like android dosent have these, there's chat features, nearby share, duo and stuff like those, but an average Android user barely uses them. Budget and thus value for money matters too. Storage, customisation, options to choose - everything matters in such locations. In a country where iPhone is the thing, yes i phone goes for a win. In a country where there's an actual competition in the market, no, the points may totally shift a bit.
Don't worry guys iPhone won just because Remember last week they Went to Apple Head Quarters And Apple Paid them to make Iphone Win You can tell That just by looking their faces when they are explaining to Each Other , I mean Android has Better Display, Refresh Rate , Customisation, Features , Battery , Fast Charing , Better Notifications , Community Support For Everything, Repairability , Better Home Screen And App Drawer , Best Control Center , Samsung & Vivo are King In Photography , USB-C , Better Google Ecosystem & Support , I mean guys Literally Android Is King in That Other Than Videography, Airdrop iPhone Is Only for Stupids & people who locked into Apple Ecosystem other Than Only Stupids Use that iPhone, Clearly It is a Paid Video to Show iPhone Is better Even Though It's Looks Like it's Not
I've never hated Android. In fact, I've owned a few in the past, but for what I use tech for I just think it's inferior and fragmented. So much of the Apple experience is about everyday conveniences like AirDrop, as well as being able to multitask between devices through continuity. When was the last time you emailed a photo or video to yourself? For me, it was before I became a Mac user in 2012. Which is why in 2022, I would never try anything other than Apple ecosystem.
IPhone is bulshits phone 🤣😂
This is Gerald from Hey, Arnold
Well I thought a Bad MKBHD video didn't existed , Here it is
IOS is just overall better in everything an average customer cares about. Android users brag about "customisation" but they never use it, they brag about how it's "open source" but they don't even know what that means. IOS users brag about amazing cameras, exciting features, a beautiful, simple and smooth operating system... all of which are something an average user would interact with regularly.
Like seriously... did they give a tie to the customisation on both phones. Like really😹😹😹
i lost faith in mkbhd  looks pretty sad about the scores sorry to say this, you skipped most of the advantages of android.(is this a paid one) :(
Excellent
Dont need apple ecosystem because im not a programmer nor content creator. My job doesnt need that.  No need for iMessage because i dont live in "walled garden" country.  So this video is 75% biased
don't like mkb why not collab uraveageconsumer?
Im sorry but phones have hit a plateau a couple years ago....
Android vs iPhone - Which is ACTUALLY Better? The one that fits your want&need..
It's like a iPhone promotion
This is pakka promition video of iphone.  😀.. i lost trust on you both 😶
extremely biased
iPhones just better for all around user experience
Marques is a fraud for blatantly supporting apple like this. He's painted a 1200 dollar Android phone like it's a product designed for poor people. Iphones have their benefits but Android phones have more features and whatnot. This is an absolutely stupid video and I've just lost all my respect for MKBHD. If iphones are the absolute best, why the f*** does he review Android phones?? Can we trust him anymore?
Whatever I love Android 😌
Apple destroyed android lol 😂 😂😂
Display is draw, hahahaha wtf dude
This is your worst review U never had a iPhone as the best phone of the year and now iPhone is your ballsaa...🤣🤣
For eco-friendliness _repairability_ counts too, and Apple is probably _the weakest_ here. And even though their self-repair program exists it is still awfully expensive and hard for those who don't make a living repairing iPhones in the Genius Bar. Meanwhile, some Androids are particularly inexpensive for repairs, but I know it's not as good as before for more phones go for OLED screens on the Android camp, even in ultra budget segment.  Meanwhile for pricing _depreciation value_ counts too, considering Arun mentioning buying a used phone or a refurb phone. Except for Huawei 5G phones and iPhones, other phones depreciate heavily as time goes by. As a result, _iPhones are better for the high-end segment_ and if you're on a budget, Androids, especially many recent models _neither YouTuber covered before,_ give better overall CP value, even though some iPhones are sold as cheap as them now
Is see this video as: iPhone vs the world
Whats the name of the game 2:20
Apple is the opposite of invoermentaly friendly they have caused more harm to the invoerment than Samsung and Google together ( google is Carbon neutral awredy but i forgot to mention)
Android loosing miserably but mkbhd saves the day by still using s21 ultra.
Love this colab! But I'm confused about the colors of the scorebord. Why is iphone blue and Samsung green? The Samsung logo is blue, (an) Apple is green 🤔
Why is Nearby by Share on Android so underrated?  I must be the only one who uses it everytime I want to share something.
What a pathetic partiality by mkbhd , if the gap was this big them, ur own self proclaimed award should have been won by apple itself and even last year u gave to samsung   If u having a brand partnership with apple atleast advertise beforehand before taking up sides.
Idk if im the only one but weirdly enough i like the notch on the iphones
Is this a promotion for apple?
Samsung isn't the only phone that runs android, I think that you should have used a true android phone that can top everything off like the One+ 10 pro. every iphone user I come across ends up rethinking their life on switching back to android 😂 just saying if you are trying to do it the correct way, use the most powerful device that runs android.
Split points for display? Really? Litteraly the best display on the market vs an odly average one and you split the points, because YoU LiKe tHe FaCt ThAt ThE SiDe oF tHe PhOne Is FlaT!?!? Dude, that doesn't even have to do with the display, wtf?
Every phone not 100% perfect including iphone
Now I need apple products send me iPhone iPod iPad and Mac
MKBHD WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME IPHONE WON YOUR PHONE OF THE YEAR AWARD?
too biased😂
This video is brought to you by Apple Inc.😂😂
MKBHD's points were as a common user and Arun's points were as a tech reviewer
To be very honest. I don't mind Iphone winning most of those categories but the way you are speaking about the Iphone disadvantages vs android disadvantages you sound very biased. I'll give you an example where when you talk about the Iphone disadvantages you say well no phone is perfect and then you find a way to give it a draw whereas when you're talking about the android disadvantages you are ruthless lol. Anyways it always boils down to opinion. But you guys are pretty biased. Iphone sounds like the spoiled favored child and android is the one child that's actually good but looked down upon in the family. That's how you guys sound to me. 🙂 and the way you even take the Best Android features and say well, no one uses those so it doesn't count 🤦‍♂️. This video is so biased maaan, I was literally saying whaaaat thee🤣. So biased.
Android Best Display Best Value for Money Long Photos High Charging speed iPhone Brand Value High Security Best Camera High Performance
Duo Apple Fanboy~
Bro 2 applefanboys make a video 🤦🏼‍♂️
On ECO part, it was a bit misleading to add the iPhone as the winner. Yeah, it most likely uses the most recycled material, but at the same, they the ones that make it least reparable and using other tactics that promotes buying a newer model (slowing down performance, etc).  Even though most of the companies want to make it less reparable, Apple wins big time in that category.
I feel shame on this, Is that a paid promotion by Apple
Worst comparison i ever seen, ig u guys getting paid from apple to do this video
Great video and Collab. I do think though that this comparison was always going to be for an eco system that's built for one phone vs one built for millions of phones. It was always going to be a biased comparison but hey
Feel like you needed to compare one android phone to one iPhone you compare the iPhone 13 Pro to like an average of every android which just doesn't work
As iPhone 12 pro user I just want to know how android user are feeling after watching this video 😂😁
I just iPhone for flex
Thanks man!!!🔥🔥🔥👍 Waiting for this for ages
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
S22+ has the best night photography. Unbelievable from Samsung.
12k android fanboys disliked this video because iPhone won by a huge margin.
M1 made by TSMC and Samsung.. And it's useless because of Apple phone can't even muti task. IPhone screen also made by Samsung and they give them OLED. Samsung uses AMOLED. And I believe you know the difference.. “Techs“ ignored these facts.. They went with how they feel about it... 😂
WHY IT'S FULLY IPHONE 🤐
I'v got Samsung Note 20 and Iphone X and i must say im still on Android. For me there are tons of flexibility. iOS is cool but i don't need it advantage.
ANDROID can do a lot better than iOS, think out of the APPLE box 🤨
Never thought this collaboration would happen
Another big win for android is that it is open sourche
Android users have smaller peepee
Please compare like iPhone and Android in mid-range prices, I dont think Im ever gonna give 600 dollahs on a phone
I feeel this video as a paid promotion for i phone 🧐🧐
Its official , for ppl who has not watched the video .. here is the short ver.  Both of the so-called influences are sold out .   2.5 and 7.5 ??? Are you kidding me ?   Time to look somewhere else for because this looks like an apple promotion to me .
Is this video sponsored. 🤣
Mkbhd 😂😂 wtf u sayin dude 😂😂
so sad.... doesn't feel genuine.... didn't knew MKBHD opinions were up for sale
15:37      [16]         ( 1 / 6 )
Use me like dislike
ios on iPhone might be great but iPad ios sucks... We know what we're getting into when buying an android tablet but an iPad is supposed to be this awesome device that cannot go wrong.. Still can't believe there isn't a proper Facebook/instagram/YouTube app on ipad
If you look what people need in most of activities is android and android can do what iphone can do but iphone not do what android can do most of activities bro
Paid pramotion
the battery part is a joke HAHAH iPhone dies in a minute while most Android phones have 5000 mAh standard capacity.
Now a days iPhone heats more.....
Android Vs iPhone big like 💯🎉🌹🍒
Both of you influenced by Apple 😏😏
20:07 that sound, MMMMM NICE.
I am not a fan of the iPhone, because I find it a bit dumb. No headphone jack, no SD support, and personally I have found that most my iPhone friends try to look for a power bank or something at the end of the day. Also it is kinda unfair to talk about eco friendly approach of iOS without mentioning things like USB C charging and headphone jack. Though they don't directly contribute to the e waste, indirectly they contribute a lot more to the whole problem.
Samsung neee thalakkan patillaa
Is that an apple promotion video  Nice one
Superb
വെറുതെ അല്ല ശാസാം പിടിച്ച് എയറിൽ ഇട്ടത്
Marcus sure is apple fan boy,Arun!
MKBHD is like brand ambassador of iPhone i just huh...WTH
love the chill style
Congrats finally a worst video to point out. Dude it seems the whole video is an interview done by u, if u say tht u stood on ur opinion then i too stand on the opinion tht this video is fully sponsored by Apple. Well instead of this video u could have just updated abt ur fitness challenge.
It's Nate fare any one agree with it ⛔⛔⛔
Its doesn't feel like a brand promotion at all
So u gyz r saying that android is trash... Am not going to support this .. 🤛
-Unsubscribed-
If you are in  US  and you are lcoked to eco system...u are valid...but...from the other part of the world...its different
Unsubscribed Apple fan boys.
Android still has more customisation and easily should have gotten a point there.... you can't use facetime or imeassage as an excuse considering android literally have there own versions of them.....
U guys are talking about developed nation, but we also have developing and poor nations. 'Technology for every one' take this as a criteria. Android is for everyone...bt iphone?
iPhone wins 👍🏼
Shit comparison 😂
We are fools.
Unnecessary video. Both OS has its flaws and upside. Can’t just write off android with such low score.  This video is like a Apple fanboy thoughts
Potato chips
Unsubcribing from your channel. You both sold out to Apple.
Still wondering why we dont see more of these videos!
I always notice, Marques is always bias for iPhone, well, its not wrong tho, iPhone is a good phone. Plus, he use iPhone for like how long already. He's more comfortable with it. But for some people, pay extra couple of hundred only to get a SLIGHT better experience than some android phone is just not worthy. Just my opinion.
I agreed with most of the things said in the video, yet, I don't think that Android has such a low rate compared to the user experience of iOS. I think the biggest issue is that on one side you are buying a brand and on the other, you will have to waste 40 hours to select an Android phone that suits you. There are very nice deals out there, but you gotta look for them, and in the end, the iPhone is going to do a better job at X or Y thing. Buy an iPhone then? Problem is: you are stuck in an ecosystem and experience the pain of paying premium for everything but there's no excuse for bugs, or bad software updates. And as we all know, tech is very prone to bugs
Two tech Gaints talking about two tech rooling Company's 😂
Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra will be better than any other Iphone ever, cause apple sucks compared to samsung/android
This is more of opinion and not actual tests.
Both phones are great!
I feel a little disappointed about how you punctuated the iphone over Android on repairability. I've been year reparing phones, and the iPhone use all different kind of screws just to make them impossible to repair. The 30% recycled materials its just a marketing strategy. Iphone doesn't want the user to be able to control any aspect of the device
This ain’t fair
Paid by Apple
I didn't use an Iphone but still I would like to say that this was a biased video.
Both of them are using iphone though
Hes An iphone user that hates android
Wat the fuck 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
You are missing durability on this debate. This is one of the key reasons why I switched to iPhone after 4 generations of Galaxy phones. Samsung’s Galaxy battery is dead after 1-2 years.
I feel that Samsung's Quick Share feature can go head to head with Airdrop.. Maybe that's something you could test? Airdrop vs Quick Share
Did Apple sponsered this video 😡🤔
mga rich kids amp
Iphone got half a point for display yet android got no point for having literally up to 7 times faster charging? How does that work lmao and please tell it was a joke when you said you'd rather use an iPhone for photos😂
Overall I agree with the iPhone being the winner. However when thinking about what phone to buy next, I am not sure if I will buy an iPhone cause I am really missing a fingerprint reader. I know this sounds minor but if you think about it the thing you do the most with your phone is unlocking it. Not that face ID is bad. I think it's a great addition to a fingerprint reader e.g. when your fingers are wet or something. But there are many cases where face ID just doesn't work and I always see iPhone users typing in their PIN because face ID failed. And a fingerprint reader is just faster when I take my phone out of my pocket because I can put my finger on the fingerprint reader already when the phone is still in my pocket. So it is already unlocked once I look at it while with face ID I first have to hold it in front of my face. Also the fact that iPhones still don't have usb-c is so annoying. So these to me are two HUGE points for Android. Other than that I love iPhones and IOS.
Sponsored video by apple 😂😂
Once again Apple proved that money  can buy tech influencers 😐
couldve just said u pick apple in the first 2 minutes than drag the conversation to 20 mins HAHA kinda boring takes too
iphone has better battery and performance than Samsung and most other android phones so I choose iphone. I know some gaming phones are better but they have shitty cameras so I choose iphone. the all rounder. 🧁
NGL but that was kinda biased and you can see it clearly.
I feel this video is biased.
What about otg or micro sd. Where is extra space offline on iPhone...... On Samsung you can expend build in space or copy somthing by otg on external space. You can even watch blu-ray if you conect external blu-ray 🤔
Who's here before Marques comments?
Would have just preferred your opinion instead of the iPhone fanboy's. Lots of topics not touched like versatility and in the eco section no mention on accessories like cables and chargers.
Still prefer Android over iPhone
Well used ecosystem is of apple in western countries compared to other parts of world ..  that's the only reason why I phone makes the win..
Apple promotion
Two android lovers say iPhone is better because lately at apple they know what they doing
Nice
Android is just better across the board, the key features of iOS are replaced by a number of android apps. I think it really is only america where the Iphone actally competes with Android
How come android still number one in the Market? 😂😂😂
How much does the iPhone pay you,  so opinionated.
Mr mkbhd . I don't agree with you .  If you get any money  from iphone  . Make a paid promotion video . This is not that video .
I think s22 ultra is the best smartphone ever  because we get customers stratification
great video and really good side to side comparisons bit is it just me or does Arun talk a little 'biased' for the iPhone almost sponsored presenting new iOS 16 features?🤨
For me,, how much you can afford? The choice is your.s😂
Ugly ass notch, ugly ass pill and hole punch. Stop there nothing left to say
Hyping the Iphone in some categories,  boooo
The categories were weirdly balanced. Personal assistant is the heart of the OS and clear 1:0 for Android. The same about personalization (still!). With different choice of categories it could be a draw or even win for Android.
I will spare you time: Android is more fun, but slow, iPhone is boring but professional. Period…
This is unacceptable. Android deserves so much better than just 2.5 points. Worst comparison ever.
Use a oneplus the refresh rate is way better
He is just Trying to promote apple. Felt very unsatisfied
This video is not an exact comparison......If any one who haves little commonsense can identify 🤣🤣🤣🤣.............Shit PROMOTION VIDEO 💩💩💩💩🖕🖕🖕🖕 Lost respect to both channels.
Shazzam അണ്ണൻ comment ഇട്ടിട്ടുണ്ടോന് നോക്കാൻ വന്ന ഞാൻ 🤧🤧😊
Moral from the video: don't buy an android phone. Only go for an iPhone even if you have to sell your own kidney.
Ever since your video about how doing these videos damaged your health, I find it harder to enjoy your videos because all I can think about is how it’s basically killing you…
S22 Ultra has implemented Camera Social media integration, itll pass to the rest soon enough
Where is the android’s positive stuffs? You guys only says the possitives of iphone and negative side of android but where is the positive sides of Android??? And what about the demerits of iphone??
I switched from ios to android and changed my ringtone to what I wanted after 9 years😁
12:00 Make a double click on the power button to open the camera instantly!
It's a good argument but lots of people want a cheap reliable phone not the best phone on the market
there are many features that android have what iphone dosent have some examples down  eg: charger in box  multi screen view  game mode for high  throttled performance in gaming in my aspect in flagship phones samsung s22 is the king  or in affordable many are ther like iqoo latest few models etc. edit: there are many more features that i havent mentioned
Shame in you guys 🤣🤣🤣.... I'm sure this video is apple sponsored
Its preference. I liķe apple more.
I felt this as waste watching...just simply giving hike to iphone... Android phones are better in most cases. Purely my personal opinion...not to hurt anyone.
This is a very westernized comparison i.e it draws conclusions from the opinion of a certain demographic usage... I think Android should have gotten more points here but ultimately the iPhone still wins
Paind promotion for apple
I think it is hard to pit iOS against all Androids. Samsung vs Apple would be a better comparison.
What a cool, and fun to watch video. Thanks, Arun and Marques. 👌☺️
apple battery is very poor compare to Android
MKBHD never give a award for iphone 🤣
Why only iPhone it is so costly bro
mkbhd what happen got any tie up with apple ... 🤷🏻‍♂️ ... looks totally unfair comparison ...
I think most of costumer is afford Android phones
From my perspective the points given to iphone for some categories were just pointless and it didn't make sense and was totally diving in deeper when it came to androids while splitting the points for no reason. What can we say tho? Even my girlfriend who doesn't know anything about phones prefer an iPhone cause it has cute colors :(
Mkbhd is an apple fan....  both are good at its own way
We knew how much MKBHD is biased towards Apple. But et tu brute?
I only use Siri because it has male British voice, and it’s much more pleasant to my ears than female American voice.
Bro then why don't you give award for iphone(mkbhd) yet like past years u give s21 and OnePlus device .is this  paid  promotion.
Hi, i would honestly choose a android phone but for gaming it is actually ios but i still choose android
Very garbage compare.. 2 of both are iphone fans gey..
Android should not be degraded like this.... TOO bad comparison..
I disagree on the point that MKBHD made. True, the few number of features like Imessage/Facetime etc on IOS may affect alot more people on a per feature to users basis, but when u add all the people that benefited from customizations within Android, I m pretty sure it benefits more people in Android than IOS.  It should be a draw at least

Lol it's funny how they give all the points to iphone when it's obviouse that Samsung wins in most of these points.
Even as an Android user, i would say that this video is somehow accurate in a way of some people didn't even know...
2:40 But that'S only so, because the apps are created with iOS in mind, because the quality for apps in the Apple Store has to be way higher than for Google Play.
Seriously such a broad topic "Android vs iPhone" discussion went more on top tier specs resulting 2.5 and 7.5, please reevaluate your scoring methods, we wish to see in terms of affordability (cost for the upfront purchase, accessories and repairs),  overall experimentation options available with accessories, the push back market value at time of upgrades, does any breed of the phones have a presence at every affordability point, this discussion especially when it is encompassing broader topics should have highlighted many more information, which was anticipated. Also points on the long run which provides more value for money spent, what ecosystem threats can render these outdated and how soon they can be, I believe these should be the key focus of the recommendations especially with this huge subscriber base following and making their decisions for their next upgrade or first purchase.
Video sponsored by IPhone
Black Vs White
THIS WILL BE FIRST DISLIKE ON UR CHANNEL BE ME. I think I phone sucks in basic things just Android rolls over them smoothly And iOS is the most insane os I've I don't know are u people out of your mind ..... Felt bad after knowing that ur choices are so bad. 😑😑😑
DIDN'T EXPECT THIS KIND OF RATING😒  MKBHD IS STANDING WITH IPHONE, IT FEELS LIKE COLLABORATION WITH APPLE.....
A really important one for me on the software side is the driving software. After being on Android for years, I decided to give iPhone a shot. The difference between Android Auto and CarPlay is pretty massive. I've owned various Android phones and they all seem to have similar problems with Android Auto stability and performance, whether it fails to launch entirely, randomly stops playing audio, or any other number of things. So far, CarPlay has been a MUCH better experience and I like that it has split screen, though that's allegedly coming to Android Auto sometime soon.
How much did apple pay you for this  nonsense???
Iphone sponsored this video 😊
apple dogshit, android op/god
Why is Samsung camera so dark? Even on max settings? iPhone by default is also so much brighter and sharper especially in low light conditions. My only real gripe about android
Marques is an iPhone user. so what answer do you expect with all questions? lol
Am a bit disappointed.. the two with the experience this discussion is a bit shallow..
I think availability is a also a great topic becoz apple arent available in some countries of Asia but androids are available.
these two people are talking fake at this point both used to be good until 2021
I would've liked you to have covered security. Nowadays when all of your life is pretty much in the phone, this is quite an important factor.
Haha Android Modded Apps goes brrrrr
Love ur videos so much they get a like before even watching them.
ഇവര് എന്താ ഈ പറയുന്നത് 😂
Don't know man, iphone may tick a lot of 'on paper' boxes but I would still prefer my cheap and trusty android (OP7T) over an overhyped overpriced iphone. Maybe, it does come down to what you want from your phone and one can't do a blanket comparison of Android phones and iphones. It DEPENDS.
Like this comment those who feel this was not justice to android ! like this comment those who thinks that it is not legit video or promotion to ios/iphone ! like this comment if you are an iphone hater! like this comment most people know samsung S22 is better in many things except price like this comment if you know that samsung is providing display for apple     many more that android have iphone dosent they only looking what is available for iphone i didn't except a video like this unfair content would there on mrwhosetheboss''s channel     i feel this video create war between iphone haters and lovers
I love how mrwhotheboss is totally fab biting for mkbhd , but who isn’t ❤ great video guys
Shazzam annante vdo kand vannr ondo 😁
Fooking paid work😂🤣...Lol
Why I'm I smiling throughout the video
No type c port . No customisation . iPhone is '0'
If only this video was made 2 - 3 years in the past.... Android would've had the audio jack advantage
In my eyes you should be criminally charged for selling a $1200 phone with no headphone jack
👎💔
Why don't talk about wireless power share quickshare which can send anything from android to any other phone even to iPhone users not just airdrop that you need just apple to apple to  share 😉
This is the first time i can't agree with you guys, like the customisation point to apple. Dude ever heard of miui ? Please.
How much did apple pay you 😂 ?
I usually don’t replace my phones often. I pay sleek price on iPhone than buying cheapo phones but don’t last that long. I will have my ip13 for the next 4 years.
Apple is my Fu*king sh*t 😆
Epic video! 2 of my favorite 4 reviewers sharing screen time!
MKBHD is giving all his points in this comparisons to iphone and had given all his awards for best phones to the android phones in his channel and never to an iphone once.... What's going on ???? It seems like he is now the CEO of iphone.
Love them but they are clearly biased.
Fucking lol dude 🤣
iPhone simp vs Chadroid  user
Whenever motorla launch a new phone the boring ads play
This is so true, all those cool features and customization that Android offers only matter for a small group of people and on the other hand all those small features and ecosystem that apple offers really matter to a Large group of people.   I used Galaxy phones for 7 yrs and the only reason I switched to IPhone is because of the great Ecosystem and very Stable software.
I beg to disagree. Android has better screen.
No No No, why mkbhd who always gives best phone award to other phones and uses an android phone saying iPhone like a parrot in every single category. Like whats wrong man I love your videos and now you are saying iPhone to every single question. No this is not the real score, trust me guys this is not the real score
Android is better in more ways than the other way around.
I feel very bad for Android. Both Android and iOS has its own merits and demerits. You should have pointed it out.  Say, Samsung is now giving proper updates to its users and also their cameras are dope ! I think within all the limitations, Android performs well for atleast some set of users. I would expect at least 50-50 ratings for them.
there is something wrong with this video I am not a hater. vivo x series camera is good and c type charging and many more. I am a good fan of your and your videos and Marques were most watching videos on YouTube in technology section.Marques wasn't right with every section.
Most waste video ever😡👎
Latest promotion video for apple.... 😆😆😆😆
Display really draw  ahshdhasd.İf Samsung galaxy s21 ultra and s22 ultra Rolls Royce İphone is Bentley or Mercedes.
IPhones are not customizable enough to hold a candle to android, so not close at all. You can literally put anything as a wallpaper, even a video, create 4D wallpapers, make widgets yourself using KWGT for example, make it not even look like the OS it shipped with and change the launcher as well. Non of that in iPhone. Yeah just focus on the customizable lockscreen sure 👍
As creators I respect both you guys but on this video i don't even understand the scoring logic. Sorry I completely disagree with this.
Disappointed
Display is not a draw. Android is clear
Y not iPhone? it's a PHONE that cost more than a great laptop. Well it's enough.
I think you’ve missed “Privacy”
I think you guys went deep enough into the aspects of android and iphone, but then didn't talk about other things that are also important. I never call Marques biased in any way at all, but his opinions reflect that he just might favor the iPhone a bit too much to neglect it's flaws (price to performance, repairability, "genius "support etc)
Biased AF
the bias in this video is massive. performance okay, software support okay, privacy okay, but screen! design! photos!!!!! come on
Marques is an apple fan boy and the whole video is biased on that. The only thing I agree on in this, is that iphone shoots better video but that's about it. The rest are stupid debates.
do Mkbhd have some deals with iphone!?huh!?
🔥🔥
Don't fool us
Is this a paid one? !! 🧐 Its really shocking to see how badly they downgrading android devices.  I respect your opinion, but mentioned it as ur opinion only , not as a fact.
Sponsored by apple 😵 Shame on you 🥴
neither are actually better. both phones are really good. iPhones excel and some things and lack in other, just as Samsung phones are really good some things and lack in others.
The best phone is the one you already own.
💩💩💩💩💩💩Only stupid PROMOTION 👏👏🖕🖕
Obviously, most of the high mid-range android phones are better than the flagship iPhone in all aspects except for the camera  and all flagship Android phones are much better than the iPhone in all aspects!.
I prefer android over iphone
Customization is a draw? Lol. Some of these YouTubers are losing credibility
Nobody talks about file management, which is what makes a phone to behave as a computer. The iphone is crap in that department and only for that particular thing I will NEVER use an iPhone
Shazam fans cmon
Asus Rog 4 came and became gaming phone of the year and was close too being phone of the year. Asus Rog 5 came so much time back and is still shown and compared in this video even the phone has grown kind of old now. And when it came it was the best too. The entry of Asus Rog 6 would change everything and maybe way better than iphone
👎👎👎👎
Poda kope
I think mkbhd was kind of biased towards iphone...no way those widgets looked btr than android...and it is pretty simple to add them
ARUN DIDN'T GOT A CHANCE TO SAY HIS OPINION? HE TRIED
Biased 💯
M51 has 7000mah
I like very much this video. Finally, is about you, not the phone.
Biased towards iphone
First video i disliked in ur channel. It looks like apple sponsored / paid video.🤦🤦
this is so fucking rigged
Used Android for years but iPhones just became better. Sorry Android.
You can’t compare iPhone and Android without talking about the Apple ecosystem. The ecosystem is completely new way of thinking about technology that you don’t understand if all you’ve used is Android which is where I started. Trust me, the specs don’t really matter, but Apple only features like AirDrop and Continuity are incredible for your productivity. Don’t focus on the numbers, focus on the experience you can get when all your devices are communicating with each other and working for you. Android has nothing to offer when it comes to that.
If you are planning to have this biased opinions better not to post it... We viewers are not braindead you know..
Ok we all know that this MKBHD is apple fanboy. About Arun, he is a little bit more neutral, but still Arun uses iphone the most.
This other guy just loves iphone 🙄
Do you have a any tieup with apple 🙂
You guys should consider which company is more evil, Alphabet or Apple? (Eco friendly is a marketing gimmick rather than an actual lofty goal for tech companies)
jit vs aot compilation make sense to the performance of CPU and Ram.
I've just upgraded to the oppo find x5 pro from an iPhone 12. The way I see it is iPhone is more refined and in theory better across the board then android but both are great. I just find iPhone a bit boring and restrictive.
I've had apple devices and android devices. Android is better and more powerful as a tool overall. I used to struggle to do things on ios quite a lot. so I sold the iPad and iPod, They were total rubbish if I'm honest. Good riddance lol
That's how confused I get watching their reviews . But when they meet they feel like us..
iPhone Vs Every android phones!! This is not fair comparison bcz iPhones are different and Androids are more different how could you compare both of it in 10 categories?
*sponsored by Apple 😅🤣🤣
Title should have been-Which is better According to MKBHD?
I would choose android any day of the week pls
Sorry Siri!
Mkbhd does a  smartphone awards video every year  Never seen an iPhone win
Waiting for the collab of Mrwhoosetheboss & JerryRigEverything for durability test 😁
What the display bw these is a draw omg... I thought mkbhd was among the few genuine guys and now this...😔
WTF you doing
What is this heart thing you can use when in comments? Can anyone explain?
the s22 battery is 69 super nice 1:08
Kinda rigged. Android has software that iOS can't even dream of. The rest is irrelevant.
This is Apple promoting video…..you two are comparing USA and UK market
my android has a notch. and who cares about the notch i Used to have an iPhone and didn't notice it. I am on android because I wanted to try it.
I found biased decisions
Apple are so over priced. Google assist leaves everything else for dead.
The only feature that i think it wasn't brought up was Quick share on Samsung instead of Air drop but other than than than nice video it was fun to see different prospective!😁
Great interview , so mkbhd say's what he likes and that's the borderline answer, mm at the end of the day someone's perspective is what matters 😅
Maybe this video was recorded by an android or iPhone???🤨🤨
Hard enough to prove🤣🤣iPhone : World’s best smartphone
This is biased for apple with Charing camera And photography speed
WTF... MKBHD lost all my respect.... As a viewer i am pretty sure that he's promoting Apple for no reason.. Maybe he's paid.. but don't know.. he just gives the best phone award to all the android phones every year and suddenly makes a collab and gives the Verdict that apple is better than Android.. No.... You're absolutely wrong.. On photography iPhone is better.. Lol.. even customisation apple.. Multitasking apple.. Lol. If you're not using the multitasking on Android it's not like no one is using and want that.. That split screen is soo useful than the non resizable pop up video on Apple. Anyway just lost a subscriber.. pity on such paid videos... It's not like reviewing a phone and telling it's good.. Its promoting one product and defaming the rest. That too falsely..
Love that decision 😋
Moved to my first iPhone in 2016 (having been a big Android fan prior) - and have not even considered getting an Android phone since then. I just enjoy the Apple ecosysteem and UX so much more. But i'll never go full Mac - i've always loved the PC - for gaming, etc - so it's always a mix based on devices and use cases i guess.
Seems this was a waste of time for MKBHD, cause I watched every video of MKBHD channel.
Great video ! Would like to add - Dual sim and support for dual apps in android is a must have feature in my everyday usage !! I’m not sure if apple supports this
my fav collab!!! (always)
Why the hell they all downgrade android?
You took the entire android market with iphone obviously there will be a huge differential. Not all android companies process their work the same way. So it is hard to tell unless individual brands are compared against iphone.
i completely disagrees as an iphone and andriod user customisation in andriod is better that ios and i disagrees most of the things u told and the points given were nothing
This video is so Biased towards iPhones. lol MKBHD lol says he uses an android? wearing an iWatch. Now, I love the iWatch but not the iPhone. Since Apple does not even know how to make their devices compatible with other brands while securing it like ANDROID compatible devices do lol xD!!! I boycott Apple cause their core values from a consumer point of view are SLAVERY and CAPTIVITY which is not American at all. America is all about freedom and independence. But, some people love to be slaves by choice and that's their personal fetish. Some predators wait for the right moment to strike right? I see Apple as such a predator and not trustworthy. Right now its like that crocodile pretending to be sunbathing with its mouth open till everyone gets in then snap shut!
As always Android is  ❤️ iPhone is showoff
I personally don't feel this a fair comparison. I couldn't see this as one to one race. There are much broad varients in android where as the iPhone is concentrated. Bring out a head to head fight. iPhone scores in the point that it can compete with any phone and still stands out in its own personality.
2.5 / 7.5 looks biased to me .Apple is better, but never to this margin.👎 It seems like they are trying to convey to whole world to buy only iphone .
Marques gives all points to iPhone. But in his annual phone awards iPhone has not come as the best phone yet..
Better battery is Android ..better display Android and better Processing is Android soon the mediatek dimansity 9000 is coming that is better than bionic..so i think mkbhd has a tieup with apple..so he is telling apple apple apple apple .........................
Hey MKBHD , Is that a paid review from Apple.. I feel so. Actually your last year's best smartphone award goes to the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra..
The worst video of yours... This video doesn't make sense.
I like to see the different opinions but, yeah some of them are just opinions and not facts
Android phone.. better then i phone. Now
Android all the way.
I thought Pixel was going to win camera cause HDR on that phone beats any phone in the industry.
It's so funny that one of the best tech influencer in the world forgot to mention about type c cables of Android ...lol a paid video would have been much better than this ...marques was always ready to say iPhone is the winner for each and every question but he hasn't given any award to iphones in his award videos.
Paid promotion by apple 😹
Yo Jidion calab thats wsup!
they forgot to say "this video is sponsored by apple".
But MKBHD never gave best phone award to Iphone. He is not true to his words.
Still money speaks every thing right MKBHD..... i thought right..
So glad you guys managed to squeeze this in.  Great video!
Here we go again...
Mkbhd in this video be like... Iphone is the best Me : then y didnt u ever gave your best phone of the year award to iphone
🤣🤣🤣
Arun: Hi what's up MKBHD: iphone
I Unfollowed mkbhd 😂
AppleTard detected
👎😤
Android is best😤😤
I saw from your other vids that I think Xiomi is making phone boxes out of mushrooms. I thought that would win
But he hasnt given any award to apple phone
totally disappointed with this video
No one can judge what is better the choice is on the consumer. Not the tech YouTubers and manufactures.
3rd party apps are quite a major benefit for android due to to the ammount of them
two of the best tech reviewers of this era
Thats not fair, looks like the video is sponsored by apple 😂😂😂
استغرب ان نقطة البطارية راحت للايفون!! بطارية الايفون تعبانه يا ناااس
👎👎👎
I phone have no type c charger no fast charging I'm saying that all mobiles are not perfect
All these people who think android is better and yet Apple have matched or beaten them on everything but price and iPhones only cost more because they’re better.
i dont see how this is a good comparison, you are comparing a OS which is android, which MANY phones run and probably has the most variety out there to a set phone by a set company which is the iphone which has a set number of specs besides the storage and possibly the ram. So its the iphone vs samsung ultra series, the pixel, vivo etc. Great information tho
Is this ad by apple, really disgusting
The whole colab was very biased to what MKBHD liked
Simply Apple advertisement
Lol I have the iPhone 13 pro max and my twin brother has the Samsung  s21 ultra  We’re even opposites in that sense lol 😂
MKBHD looks like he's really suffering here :(
I was literally looking answer for this question 🤌🏼❤️
Especially in battery life you are mostly comparing apple and samsung allthough there are other android phones specialised for having a long battery life.
I like MKBHD but dude is completely biased. He would recommend an iPhone 5c over a 2022 Android flagship.
Totally disagree with these video... Its a paid video... N dont make the viewers fool.... What kind f foolishness r u guys discussing here... I agree u r one of the best tech influencers but that doesn't mean anything that u r saying is correct...
All phones are not perfect
New way of advertisement from Apple.
Bro out of all your video this one is very hard to believe. It really looks like a apple promotion.. and i don't think you took time for making this video. Unlike others this one looks incomplete with lack of research 🥵💯
Android ❤️🙌
Stupid video now I know mkbhd knows nothing about Android phone .
I'd argue USB C, the inclusion of a charger and variety of choice are pretty massive wins for Android.   I also think Android wins the screen game and battery category hands down with up to 144hz screen refresh rates, 1920hz screen modulation, 4k resolutions and batteries with 120 watt wired, 100 watt wireless charging and up to 6000 mAh batteries. No one wants to wait 2 hour for their phone to charge regardless of how long the battery lasts 😅
Kinda bullcrap. There are many more categories that could be added and many point's that could be changed.
🤮 How much did you get paid for this?
Great Collab Arun..Very insightful and thought provoking observations..Huge fan of you two..You two are the best in the business..Am I eligible for the giveaway..I am from Africa
the iPhones are so good they needed to bring in every android to compare to the iPhones superiority. iPhone solos
I love how you actually have two different, independent views and opinions. When YouTuber collaborate and rate different things they usually make sure to basically have the exact same opinion on them.  Also the honesty when it comes to „are you actually using that stuff (like the multitask shit I’ve also never used)“ is very refreshing to see.
This is not fair. I am also an i phone user 🫠
Is an iPhone Better? Yes? Point to iOS, no questions.  Is an Android phone better? Yes? "But do you need it? Is it useful?"  I mean, you can clearly see that this comparison is purely subjective...
I am so disappointed that this is so biased
This is a totally sponsored video  Apple uses Samsung parts so isn't it android
Every draw was an android win until they talked themselves into a draw. It was every android can't do it as good, so it doesn't count when another one does better.
Marques is like the iPhone and Arun S22 Ultra.
I wish you guys filmed this in a proper Studio, or outdoors for better quality / lighting 😀
MKBHD: gives score 7.5 for iphone Also MKBHD: gives smartphone of the year award to Samsung s21
MKBHD Saying that iPhone is better than Android phones.... Then I have one question...every  year he is giving an award to best phones..... None of the iPhone  didn't won those... Awards.. 😂😂😂😂
Apple: good job guys, what was your bank account number again?
I phone have the worst battery
SEE ANDROID WINS IN COMPATIBILTY IF  PURCHASE A IPHONE ONLY THEN YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS IN CONNECTING DEVICES
Lighting sucks? Bro this was such a leisurely video to watch. Vibe was so warm and non-corporate. Thanks for this.
Onnu podey:(😂
Mfking mkbhd is a isheep and disappointed in mrwhosetheboss like bro how the fuck is display of both of them equal what the actual fk and how does iphone win in customisation
what have u expected from an apple fanboy ? sit with unbox therapy and he will make android win. It's biased always
Imagine watching this as samsung losing while watching it on a samsung
MKHD is an apple fan boy, so it's normal for him to be more inclined towards iOS. Buh I believe android gives more freedom to it users, whiles iOS pushes it's users more towards their ecosystem.
I was expecting the loud outro dun dun dunun dun dun dun dun dun dun dununun dun dun dun dunudun
What's about with quick share, its the same as Airdrop or am I wrong
can i please have one of those phones. iphone🥺
apple may well use 20% recycled materials, but what about the extra boxes you have to buy bc there's no charger anymore, or headphones etc
Two black guy..anyway like this video
next time , MKBHD needs to be in london :P
My iPhone se 2 gen takes better photos than my Samsung s21 ultra
Huawei Mate 40 Pro still the best on market ✌️✌️
so lame, draw in features. great biasness
Great video great comparison
Android is superior by far
I think MKBHD has a predilection that Iphone is better in all aspects despite it's not the case. I think it's just a biased opinion of MKBHD.
Ok I use iphone. But customization should definitely have gone to android. C'mon.  Also y'all fanboys in the comments are hilarious. No need to announce your departure.
Baised review
What about headphone jack (to use ur fav headphones), micro SD card support (carry ur own data with u instead of pushing to cloud), NFC etc.. Those could have been pulled into the discussion under a category.. Was it not considered maybe like MKBHD said, it matters to a few, and not the most..?
Another thing after watching this movie - make thought experiment and switch android and iOS sides. iOS have to work on all that different CPU`s, be customisable, has to have gazilion different brands and tweaks. And Android? Few only google pixel phones, enormous company have time and money to make android perfect just to work on their cpu`s and stuff. Compare android and iOS is next to impossible due to their work areas, iOS is closed and apple have time and resources to make it best only for their own gear. Android have to work on everything that exists. Think about that. It`s like you have two cars and highway. One of them is every sporty car, low, fast, like it was born for highways. And other is not as fast, not as beautiful but it can also ride offroad, it can fly, and go underwater, and if you will compare those two only at the highway - well, second car would seem to be worse. Yes? And truth is that those vehicles are not for comparison. One guy will choose first one, other have different needs and he will be happy for having second car.
Lol...as usual Marques....at this point I don't bother listening to him anymore
disappointed by the bias.
mkbhd is so philosophical in this video lol
I can’t believe we’re still having this conversation but I’ll give you the view & like lol
Bro pls come out of US
Android should have won.
gee just two iphone fanboys really. I wouldn't find any of those software features useful.
As an Android user I can't really disagree with this video. However, what I would say is that Android is usually 90-95% of the way there in most cases, and its how important that ease of use is to you in terms of what you want to do. A bunch of the Apple stuff is convenience based, but has pretty similar equivalents all over Android, and usually for free. I wouldn't consider myself a power user by any stretch, but it's so much more convenient plugging an Android device into a PC for content creation than it is to get stuff off iPhones UNLESS you also have a Mac/iPad as your main computer. Similarly a bunch of the launchers/apps on Android do things I want more than the Apple equivalents with minimal-ish barriers to entry.   I think of them like houses to be honest - do you just want a nice new-build condo where everything is functional and just works, but potentially can be a bit flat. Or do you want a smaller/bigger house where you chop and change some of the rooms around to how you like. I think it always comes down to user-choice vs pick up and play.
Faster charging matters
I don't actually get the title.....like android vs iphone????......android is an os.....iphone is a phone with iOS.....it would be better to name it Samsung vs Iphone
never thought this would happend to android🤣
The *Dynamic Duo*
Glad to see these two guys doing a video like this. I don't really agree with everything but I feel like it comes down to personal preferences.
Apple sucks
I want this iphone😅
Too many quirks with iphones for me to truly enjoy the experience
As I say iPhone 12 and 13 series are very hand unfriendly
So we have all these brands having to team up against iphone??? That to me is already a win for iPhone
I just want a good value phone for around 250€, apple doesn't do that so I couldn't care less about their products
I think this comparison could focus a bit more on some aspects of app stores lock, device price, availability,  more third compatibility, app store pricing, multi tasking, more open, more simple, security, etc there more aspects to it. Also I hate slow charging ... iPhone without quick charging is just annoying when you forget to charge it and you need to charge quick.... I pref to lose one hour of battery and have instead a quick charging capability.
iPhone is the best
Such a biased comparison, are you sure this video isn't sponsored by Iphone?
Over time my opinion has changed on which is best. Of course I love apple and my main phone is an iPhone, but I also have the s22 ultra and the pixel 6 pro and there are some things that I like on there, not better than my iphone but I can see why people like android. The 6 pro is pretty much the closet thing to an iPhone you're going to find on Android and maybe that's why I gravitate more towards it rather than the s22. All in all when you think about it it does come to preference, but in my opinion and sometimes it is a fact, the iPhone is better. Better camera, battery life, better OS, better user experience, so on and so forth
Based on the comments, you can tell some people were deeply offended by this video lmao. Don’t let one man’s opinion ruin your day.
Now i really want to buy iPhone 🥲🥲
Android: we have 100+ companies to tackle iPhones. iPhone:
Arun asking MKBHD why he uses a year old phone , whereas i am using a 2017 phone
I love how MKBHD wears full black while Arun wears full white lol
Black and White dress!!!!
Display is a win for Samsung/Android. And I  do use split screen on my S22+ a lot. Battery is better on iPhone, but the USB-C is a huge W for Android. Camera is better on Samsung/Android, but If you use an Instagram a lot (influencers,..) then iPhone.
I can feel the iPhone bias 😅
On the battery piece I went to a concert last night on 38% scrolled social media while waiting and filmed a bunch of video and left the camera open and got down to 20% after I got home with the 13 pro max. PLUS I started the day at 89% and left my phone on in a no service area without shutting off cellular for hours. I'm pretty reckless with the battery.
Subscribe if you did!!?? 🤔🤯😵‍💫 How!!? 🤣
Missing the dislike counter
Video Sponsored by iPhone
This really is; What does Marcus B prefer: Apple IOS or Samsung Android?
Not a sincere Video to be honest
Great video! Next time it would be cool if you guys tallied independently. Since you both thought differently a couple times.
Mkbhd votes pretty hard for iPhone but stil runs ab android phone so who's the real winner
i strongly disagree with most things in this video my realme has a 3 day bettery life and a play games, watch Netflix for 6hrs a day on average
Video is sponsored by Apple 💯🥴😂
Its not fair , you camper 2 totally different operating system
MKHD daily driver is S21 ultra.. nuff said
They didn't even mention the Hardware.... The Repairibility /repairibility cost The Innovation  The Type C usb ports...
If it were only for Arun (Non-Biased judgement) it'ld be a draw or not a landslide win for iPhone With Marcus, we've seen him every now and then tilting towards iPhone  🥱....!   Don't get me wrong iPhones are great but not by this of a landslide compared to Android  (which here is just Samsung for reference rip Pixel,Vivo,Oppo,BlackShark,Asus, Xiaomi,Sony, and every other Android)......!   GrEaT iMfORmAtivE ViDeO, ToTaLLy NoT biAseD At aLl !❤️
Blind test holding all the phones. Ni
Ipun iz real 😪
I think this is an apple sponsored video 🤣
this video is based on a iPhone fanboy not facts otherwise it would've been on the opposite
damn Google, Samsung and others really need to step up. I got a s22+ and honestly if apple could make a better OS and use a hole punch I would honestly switch and USB type C.
You can do basically all things in Android even copying the iPhone but I phone can't.
iOS vs EVERYONE
A smile has been put on my face automatically by seeing these two guys discussing over their-our day to day Phone things together. ❤️❤️
Why do you compare a mobile device vs an Operating system? Android phones are infinite
You better name this video as iphone's sponsor video
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!   "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
I had 6 advertisements pls remove some of em
Nice to see you two in the same video. This is a tough comparison because Android is not the same experience across brands, but iOS is just under one brand. I appreciate the approach you guys took with attempting to do so. This is a great opinion piece. Team Android for me. I still miss the Blackberry. 😋
Photography experience I must say android beats it by far. All my friends with iPhone 13 pro max take crappy photos and when they share on Facebook it looks horrible like 80% of the time... So that point should go for the android phones. But ok... How can you argue when the negative was based in bugs of pixel 6... Which based in the previous models it still took amazing photos... Even a   pixel 3/4/5 would beat iPhone 13 pro max in photography. Also you should mention the Apple store locked system which is disgusting. I know apple would still win in performance, battery, video and smoothness but I don't see anything else appealing in the apple ecosystem, but it's me.
Should have discussed security , privacy and repairs ?? Thanks you
I like how people love getting software updates for their phones but if windows does the same thing, everyone's pissed off lol. F for Windows
You should have a look at privacy and what you get for the price and what tricks they are using just for making money
this sounds more like an interview to me
iPhone sucks, who game in that thing?
You started as a Android vs iPhone video but then started comparing the physical aspects which Google has little to no control over. I know it otherwise would have made up a kinda boring video but again we expect uniqueness from you both.
Android won with so many reasons, fast, sharing, charging, multitasking, if you are inventor, developer, creator, producer and director and professional, Android phones win. Iphone is designed for second hands value and elementry user.
Iphone 13 pro max is King
For the first time, I'm not satisfied with a video on this Chanel. Some points felt utterly dumb like the facetime one because almost every phone from 2020 at the least can do basic stuff like video calls..., and it's not necessary that everyone is in the Apple ecosystem (having all the products from MacBook, iPad...) so features like airdrop won't be of use here, and if certain things were being considered google has its own big ecosystem(maps, translate...) which people heavily rely on as well, and this Chanel itself made a video on how apple removed stuff like charger which was unnecessary and just greenwashing...Really disappointed with the bias and ignorance in this video.
My primary reasons for choosing Android is there are more lower price options available with great hardware options, and the ability to customize is better on the android. My next reason is the very reason why many choose apple over android and that is apple is over secure. In the hands of the right user android is secure enough where as apple builds their products on the premise that all their users are novices and that is putting it politely.
This one of the dumbest videos you've done on the channel.  It's not even that it's controversial, you can't compare an operating system with a line of phones. This is a comparison between the best phone that uses Android vs the best iPhone. Title is garbage. The best selling point for Android is open source and that it is available on cheap devices, and you're out there comparing performance with no price in mind.  I usually never skip your videos but this one is just too dumb to watch. I guess the idea was to get MKBHD on the channel as well as have content from the event, but I would've honestly preferred either a changed title or nothing.
2 Apple fanboys in a comparison video? Your guess is as good as mine.
For some reason I have a bias towards android idk why
What a joke the Apple is nowhere near the Samsung or Sony display quality and experience and also the inhand feel of them is just better than the Apple...
They made it look like  Andriod is just a waste of money And Apple is the best thing you can get  in the case of apple you get little bit of everything In the case of android you get the best of what you want
You guys convicted me! I'm going to sell my kidney now 😂
Thing is for each point different android phones are used. This is the train people stick to iPhone. The All Rounder!
All the video is like: Android is better but i like the Iphone xD
Glad you both have come together! .. Only the Best two in the Tech Market  😍
I thought Collabs were for musicians only, then boom here we are.....best tech collab💥👌
Love how everyone is destroying each other in the comment section saying how stupid this video is or why the iPhone is so much better meanwhile I’m just sitting here happy that I have a phone with a working screen after I destroyed my iPhone 7 😂
screen definitely not a draw
20:07 just to make it awkward, who else noticed the missed fist bump?
The only Thing apple does best is App Optimisation ... Android Phones are not even close... But everything else is either Inferior or just on par
Lock Screen widgets on Samsung are *WAY* better than on iPhone.
Always fan to watch the two of you have a hearty conversation about tech. You have great chemistry.
Looks like MKB is an apple fan... But uses other phones as well
I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max and a 4 year old Huawei p30 as a second phone and the Huawei gives me less problems than the iPhone. I’m definitely getting the S22 Ultra for my next upgrade.
But when you did the battery life test before the iphone lost so idk
The pros of iPhones don't compensate for the freedom I feel on Android, I can install apps from external sources without rooting or jailbreaking, I can change the launcher, the lockscreen, everything is fully customizable. Okay Apple is going forward on that question, but that's still limited to what they want. iMessage to me is useless because SMS are unlimited on most plans, and Facetime too since there are third-party apps that can do the same, also they require everyone to have an Apple product, when third party apps are compatible for everyone. Again, freedom.
10 reasons to buy iPhone, this should be caption
(Sad android fan noises)
I can't sell my soul to tim cook just for the sake of reliability that iphone provides...
Why was pixel phones not included
It also depends on which ecosystem you want to be a part of. Many features on both sides have things that only work with their ecosystem. For me personally, when I switched to iPhone, a lot of the big selling features like iMessage, FaceTime and Airdrop, didn't really get used because most of my family and friends have an Android phone. Plus all my Google Play purchases over the years or now are void now and I just felt like I wasted all that money. So I ended up just switching back to Android.
Props to the collabo. My take on this is that a smartphone is used on the daily. In a lot of cases, quite some hours per day so value wise I would definitely go for stable performance/peak performance when it comes to functionality that requires stable usability throughout the day. I’m using an iPhone XS and it performs quite well. The battery life is not great and from what I have learnt using this phone is that I would prefer better battery life over speedy charging for instance.
I tried iPhone just for fun and oh boy I didn't like it. I have now a S22 and its amazing. The thing that pissed me off the most was no feedback in Calculator. Wtf? and with Good Lock on Samsung u can do anything u want
Feels like MKBHD has drunk the kool aid
Hey Arun! I think you should really consider making a vid the whole Samsung situation going on right now with the motherboard issue in M and A series phones. 😶  Edit: Fixed minor spelling mistakes
Paid video 😅
God meets God
I think @MKBHD was paid from apple 😅
I still make Iphone owners and other brands owners jealous  by my. S21 ULTRA ❤️ Simply Amazing Phone 📱
Wake up   Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature   Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word  scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love   scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced  Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing   ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain   Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one   yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days  A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you   the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right  God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ   my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too   This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved   So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus    Acts 4.12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved   John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me  God bless
Bro seriously I'm still on Android side
 is cool
I kinda know why ppl can’t see these videos in China now
These 2 are unfairly siding with apple  Apple was rumored for a foldable phone for 2 years now and still not released
makes no difference to me as I hate Apple with a passion. I'm using the S22 Ultra along side my Xperia pro i.
Android was well beaten.
The fact of the matter is that the Huawei ban gave the edge to Apple and iOS. Huawei was the most innovative company in the Android world by a pretty big margin, and it helped pushing other OEMs. Now that Huawei is out of the picture, Android has stalled. It's ridiculous.
One reason I pick Android over Apple, is they allow Emulators, so I play PSP, PS2, Dreamcast, and loads of other retro games! Plus my phone got an SD card so can easily expand the storage, shame less and less Android have this but again it about more choice in the Android market. Plus they are just cheaper, specially if you just pick one up a year later you can save so much money, but i suppose Apple phone hold the value more so if you do sell it you get more, but on balance I think I always likely pick android.
Scratches knee lol
Totally Apple Sponsored video 😂😂😂
I don't care about iphone android is way more easier
Does MKBHD use softwares like software data cable on android phones? Just because it isn’t called “airdrop” on android doesn’t mean the tech doesn’t exist there ffs!
I’m one of those who is ‘stuck’ in the Apple closed garden due to my work in music production so I can only watch Android with the occasional envy.  That fact does not bother me much as iPhones serve me well.  iOS occasionally releases updates with bad bugs but that is rare.  What matters to me is the aggregate experience - “does my phone hinder my workday?”  I would say yes but only rarely.  A few weeks ago, Siri simply refused to work at all for almost a week.  That is an example of a massive fail, really impeding my workflow and my business’s abilities in a major way.  Keeping me from messaging clients while driving during a very busy week was a crucial frustration.  Some things just need to work, PERIOD.
Both of this guys use Apple for their daily drive…so!
Marques being a total diplomat ..pretty wise id say
Mad link up 🤯❤️❤️❤️🔥
Customization is a Draw 😂 thats it 😂 dead
In this video I had tech burner add 😂
i think android is better, just because everything is more universal so you depend less on manufacturers software etc. btw i do use spilt screen and never had my photo's disappear..
8:50 not putting a charger in the box isn't saving the planet. If these companies actually cared they wouldn't be trying to get people to buy a new phone every freaking year. Apple customers are the most guilty of this practice. These people will line up around the block because apple came out with a new color for the iPhone.
not satisfied with this it seem more like iphone vs samsung only not android vs i phone
I didn't even sit and watch the video because it's always going to be what's better for you. I've been selling phones for over 12 years and for me I pic Samsung I have both phones Android and iPhones my daughter has an iPhone you know because that's the new kid thing and it cool to them but she always get mad when her phone can't get certain apps because Apple locks it out. Both phones are great it's really up to which one you prefer to use. I really don't even know why they made this video they already know that.
Bring in Flossy Carter and ASBYT to the party next time!
Who wants a Iphone 13pro max   👍
My girl has an IPhone 12 with Face Rec which she hates pin activation which she hates and the way you have to close apps which she gets VERY frustrated with. But the simplistic way to her of opening apps she doesn't mind. Me im Android I bought it I can do whatever so my S21 Ultra is here to stay I'd toss an iPhone out the window if that's all I had.
This video is sponsored by apple
Every android win went as a draw... Wtf
I’ve had recurring issues with iPhone photos taken on my camera not saving and sometimes inexplicably freezing for 5+ seconds.
Who the hell uses shareplay? I've never seen anyone actually use that under any circumstance.  Also it's ridiculous to give any points to Facetime when there's literally tons of video chat applications across both platforms. Just because it's the native app, doesn't give any extra points.
Personally I prefer android but the evidence adds up :/
Couldn't disagree more
You don’t use multi window ? Bruh that is used so much.
Performance and reliability are the main reasons I switched to iPhone
Problem is they are impossible to compare, the choice of Android phones In both hardware and software is what makes Android a better choice.
We can't just ignore that fact that mkbhd is an all-time apple fanboy. And for arun, he remains unbaised most of the time & tells the accurate.
I stand with you Mrwhosethebose until I realised at the end  "It's just few of us "🥲
A friend with an Android phone can turn her flashlight on and off by shaking the phone.  That is something I could use every single day on my iPhone.
I think mkbhd was baised, he loves apple so much that everything else seems small.
Loved this video. Two of the best tech reviewers in cozy setting and with a great format. Love hearing the opinions as its a choice I personally always find quite difficult to make as both phones/OS' offer so much. Bottom line indeed is: pick whatever fits an individual best.  For me personally the iPhone wins. It may lack a few 'cool, bleeding edge' features, but my phone has become such an essential item, I want the stability and reliability of the OS and the battery in which I think it has an edge over Android.
I think if you want a simple phone that does it's job iPhone is what you want. If you care about customizability then you want an Android.   As for iPhone having imessage... Android has a similar thing where we can send texts over internet same as iPhone. The only reason we can't do so between the phones is due to Apple.  Apple WANTS you to laugh at Android users for having a green text bubble. It helps them sell more phones.
I want these two to make a podcast!
This was your first disappointing video
How can you even say that front display is on par with samsung s22 ultra. Mkbhd is delusional and stupid. Even by the looks, s22 takes the win easy. Just look at that ugly notch on iPhone. It looks like a phone from 2014. That display comparison gave it away that mkbhd never used the s22 ultra.
I find it weird when non-tech people compare android to iphone. It's even weirder seeing techtubers do that. Nice video though.
you can tell who is biased here
13 mini and s21U ....best combo..
siri is better voice to text but google assistant is better for everything else
I keep a iPhone for everyday use and keep a android tablet on the side for my emulators 🤷🏾‍♂️ both are great
This is such an open ended question with so many variables that I don't think this was a good way to try and answer it. What I took away from this is that they put a single iPhone against all Android phones and while some Android phones are better than the iPhone, there are many Android phones that are not as good, so the conclusion is that the Android average is lower and therefore the iPhone wins?!   There are so many phones manufacturers using Android and so many versions of Android that you can't use averages to draw a conclusion. I would have wanted them to be way more specific, i.e. pick a certain user group to focus on since different user types have different needs, pick only one phone out of each camp whether that be a flagship or entry-level, and be much more specific about the criteria for each category.   I feel like many of the categories they discussed, like camera and screen quality for example, had really good arguments for Android as the winner but the iPhone took it because Marques just preferred certain aspects of it. In fact, many of the arguments seemed to boil down to what the presenters preferred, instead of looking at it objectively.   There are also a lot of factors that just weren't considered here, another reason to be more specific with the comparison.
One and Only useless video on this channel .
As a game developer, I'd say that low RAM on iPhone is very limiting for games. If you want to have high-res-looking textures, you won't have enough RAM on iPhone to show it.
Simple answer the iphone becase people are bayyas
Cortana is underrated. Its the most natural sounding assistant. Functionality is limited though coz people aren't using it .
Mkbhd loves the iPhone so he is giving everything to the iPhone where Arun is trying to be more unbiased and be more real. I think it's up to the people what they want. Both are great
I don’t think you can compare battery capacity in isolation when speaking of the different platforms when efficiency is a plus for Apple.
Wow my first disliked mrwhosetheboss video, nice job ;-) Maybe next time be fair and compare brands instead of apple vs "average android"
I love the video but i should say i kinda disagree with the scoring, the reasons from Marques is biased, he's like saying good things about Iphone but when it comes to the android, he's like heres what i hate about it. I know that's he's opinion but at least try to be fair, and not just because you liked Iphone. No hate, share love.
In my mind , it's 4.5 android - 5.5 iPhone , due to iPhone being completely unsustainable with the new repairability issues and the sheer unavailablilty of apps/features on iPhone. Saying few people use the features is not the right way considering most buy iPhones to show that they have an iPhone and Android cuz budget.🧐
MKBHD is just being biased (apple connections)
🗑️RÁC
@Marques, so you are obviously giving some of the points based on your personal preference.. "oh this one goes for the iphone just because I feel like it!" not to mention the fact that you haven't even talked about the features that ANDRIOD is capable of, let alone SAMSUNG! Never go full retard fam.  @Arun, cool and unbiased, keep it up.
This video shows that mkhd guy doesn't know shit about technology. He just gets products and money from sponsors and lies to people that he is using them. But in reality he never used that product even for a day. He should just stick to unboxing products not review them. Cause he doesn't know shit about technology
In america I agree iphone will win bwcause of "ecosystem". But rest of the world I think android have better value. For example in my country which is an asian country. You rarely sa use imessage. We use facebook messenger as a generic messaging medium sometimes ever for work purposes. Even iphone users here use facebook messenger not imessage
This is the dislike button
Going through 100s of comments the overwhelming sensus is android for the favoured, just goes to show that all the iPhone hype is just hype and marketing
The android changes so much faster but I'll still put iPhone as winner ?   Can someone say fanboys   Iphone is woefully outmatched it basically every single way
Best Joke I've ever heard : Iphone is better at gaming.
They just ended racism
you should give 20 points to Android for the fact that you can buy any phone you want and in iOS you're stuck with the iPhone
Off topic:  Why is everything in this room brown?
Two people talking about tech while they're not even power users themselves. Especially mkbhd lol
S21 Ultra sits to be the best android phone for me. Still the sexiest and I can see it(in my personal preference) beating the S22 Ultra on every department. Cause it feels like the same overall.
world’s two best tech reviewer 🔥
A non-topic really. No Iphone user has ever bought his/her phone because of screen quality, performance, battery capacity, charging speed, camera quality etc etc. It all comes down to marketing, consumer psychology and group affiliation.
Android is beteer than iPhone
This was an amazing video
The problem with the iMessage, Facetime and other similar arguments is that their value is more due to their branding than their features. iMessage's only advantage nowadays is that it is green, and I don't even know if it's possible to find facetime features that don't have an android app equivalent.
Totally biased. Don't you feel ?
I cannot believe you didn't discuss the back button. This is the one feature that keeps me with Android. Every time I pick up a iPhone it feels clumsy because it doesn't have a back button at the bottom of the screen and you end up switching between windows. So frustrating!!!
By the way, I feel like MKBHD just gives his opinions. It’s like he doesn’t actually play deep into android phone to be honest. He’s like “Apple guy”.
totally bias towards apple  >>>
on the subject of cameras, i find that modern phones have trouble capturing a really misty enviroment, and will clear up mist and rain. which sucks when your trying to capture the drearyness and mist of the moment
horrible. no argumentations. this video is legit one of the worst i've watched in a while.
Speaking of display, a friend of mine has galaxy s10+. The display looks wayyyyy more cleaner and better than the iPhone 13.
One of the most biased reviews!
This is a second or third video where he talked about how eco-concious Apple is without even mentioning how hard they are fighting right to repair. Them opening an iPhone repair program was more of a PR move than an actual effort to be more eco-friendly as it is so limited. The iPhone you buy is 20% recycled, sure, but you're also giving money to a company who has made the decision to make all of their all in one computers useless when they become old, because they removed the option to use them as a display, which probably makes as much e-waste as 10 iPhones.
There are a lot of other features about Android that makes me wanna stick with it like I can download any app on Android, even if it is not available on the Play Store, USB-C support, and a lot of other things I shouldn't talk about 😶
MB clearly has a heavy bias towards the iPhone.
Here's the real take: MKBHD says he prefers iPhone overall, but in REALITY he is using an S21 for the past year. I rest my case. :)
Best TechPodcast ever 😂🙌🏻
Lightning port -1000 points Stupid notch bigger than Hitler's mustache -1000 points  2.5 / -1992.5  Android wins
Make it samsung flagship vs iphone , the score shall be reversed, or One plus vs iphone or any android specific vs iphone, this comparison was biased as fuck
Apple fan boy will be apple fan boy ....
And who will get the revenue generated from this video. You say whatever you want, i am watching this video in my Android phone and this is the fact.
terrible comparison android is much better
As someone who is broke, I love android
really bad video
I see such a great number of experts in the comments 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 (nowdays, people think they are pro about tech just because they bought a xiaomi mi 2 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣) what a shame! Leave it to the Pros and stop commenting nonsense
Markus unique voice coupled with whose the boss perky manly voice
The title of this video is: Things that iPhone does better than android.
Samsung VS  Apple would've been better
IT felt like MKBHD was more or a Iphone FAN, and prefered it more.
This has to be one of the most biased, most infuriating videos made by either of these two tech tubers. My respect for both of these guys 📉📉📉
What video! Dark chocolate and chocolate combo
Common guys you could better together it's 2022 not 2012
Bruh no Android it just better. Cry about it.
MHKB is an apple guy
C'mon MKBHD, you are just so biased. I closed and disliked the video the moment you argued over the first point where you rated iPhone's screen and LTPO to be the best. I mean dude, the shit can go low to 10hz to 120hz whereas Samsung can lower down to 1hz upto 120hz. And please don't forget, the "revolution" of Apple? Was done by Samsung's display only when they provided the housing display units of their iPhone X.  Bdw, you're best and neutral @Mrwhosetheboss 🔥
ANDROID -Best screen in the world -A lot of customasation. - USB type C convenient use sharing with other devices  - More camera Pictures with Pro mode (best zoom, best Night mode, best Slow motion and many more) - One UI - Most beautiful design and many to choose from -Voice assistant  - Fast charging  - Finger Print  - Connects to you tv - can act as a mini PC  - Has MS office apps - Multiple windows and unlimited floating windows. - Bluetooth Sharing which lot of poor android phone have or only have. - Can connect a USB stick  - can connect a external mouse and external key bord. - Can be a mini PC With DeX feature  - And many more   iPhone is simple and easy to use true and it is reliable true. A machine that has more features will always be less reliable compared to an easy machine which has less features. Android is a complex machine  with lot of options.
Mrwhostheboss how much did you get to promote the American mentality
Biased to iPhone you guys are 😂😂
Honestly, I do not care about FaceTime and iMessage but I choose iPhone because of the ecosystem and performance. I don't care about camera as well.
Hmmm i am actually think android
Great video 😁 and the correct OS won. Apple have done a great job at nailing down:  - Support/longevity  - Robust ecosystem  - Aesthetics - OFFICIAL Developer Support - Power AND efficiency - Creating more vertical integration and control over their supply chain - Making the best UX and keeping a very consistent UI.  Android manufacturers have been great at certain things in hardware such as periscope zoom, folding screens and faster charging, but they are terrible at software, developers careless for android due to the fragmented mess that it is and android phones typically have poor support.  Lots of work to be done on the android side still.
Android user since day One. Then I bought the Iphone 12, had it for 5 Months... Was happy when i sold it and bought the S21 FE!
Agree with most stuff, but iOS sucks compared to Android in some key basic usable areas. Like clicking on links, and notifications. There's also no spam control. And for that reason, I cannot use one.
Wow that was one of the worst comparison I've ever seen
end   "this video is sponsored by iphone"
The display quality is best quality in samsung's smartphone compare to iPhone. IPhone have ratina oled display and on other hand Samsung have super amoled display. The best and better display is Samsung display. I give Samsung display A+ rating and other hand apples display I give only a grade without + point..
All these people in comments defending androids who can't affrord iphone 🤣
You couldent make this video more objective... useless video
I am not happy with this VS video  but happy to see  my two favorite  person but IPhone lags way behind  than android  USB type C OTG support  Fast charging  Third party load application  Liquid colling system  Dual cell battery  Custom ROM  Reverse wireless charging  I mean what you can't do on Android  Android gives freedom to user not boundations
For me, my galaxy A52s ticks all the boxes. It has a great chipset, 120Hz AMOLED, good enough camera, fast'ish charging support, great software. And I got it for 300 USD. Ain't no phone beating it in value for me.
I was waiting for "sub to the channel..." whole time
Lol, android users are crying with comments.
pillars because its locked in featuers.
I use multitasking maybe a few times per year.
That's a biased review, Markus stats are based on US.  iphone favor,the rest of the world doesn't worship the iphone, so Android is just as effective and efficient if not more, Choice is king in Android
why it seems bias at the features.
Biased Mk
😉
Interestingly, how much Apple paid them to push this device.  Samsung Ultra is the best device in most categories especially in photography.  And the Android is not a closed version which makes it difficult to work with Apple.  Everything is there with expensive money and not necessarily better.  My personal opinion is that Android is simply better as an interface and currently also with a camera and features that will not and will not soon be on the iPhone.
I hope you're feeling better!
I think these categories just really don't reflect the average consumer. Look at the "green" category for instance, most people could not care less.
Well people are fighting over android vs iPhone, but they forget that even though apple have some mid range phones such as IPhone SE , they don’t buy it. They go for android.  You compared battery backup , performance etc etc with iPhone 13 max pro but in that scenario MI 12 pro is in competition. 5000 Mah battery 120 w charging support. And 50mp Sony ois camera.   Android is the winner in every aspect.
I feel Marques is kinda biased now... I don't know about others tho... It's my opinion...
This comparison is so so so hard. Why? Because you've related iOS to be the iPhone and the Android as everything in the market. I won't be bitter about the outcome but that's the illusion of choice to begin with. The reason iPhone won because it's literally a solo comparison, no other phones were made in iOS. While Android... Yeaaah you get the point.  I do want to own an iPhone as well but with phones getting bigger, the big thing that gets my nerves is how to go "back" with iPhones (cuz my gf has one and I get confused on how to go home or how to go back with one hand)  Android just has that tiny button next to the home button for those and that is amazing for me
I think that this opinion is kinda biased
Where is "THE SUB TO THE CHANNEL WOULD BE...???"😭
Actually the biggest advantage of android is the ability to use third party apps in it and the availability of most apps cost free cuz iphone doesn't let you do that and most used apps are damn costly which is not convenient at all   2nd android are greatly customisable compared to iphones
I've just moved from a P30 Pro to iPhone after 4 years on android. I am missing proper notifications already. the camera and battery take some of the sting out but both OS's have good features.
What if every company use lightening port on android !!🙄
i pick android for rooting and file management. never can stay on ios after my experience in android.
Android Army hit like.
1:08 so is no one gonna notice the 69% charging on the Samsung?
The tech goats🏆🔥
I wonder if I created YouTube content, how many viewers would watch it. Only God knows.
I think the comparison here is western country based.If you make a comparison in Asian Countries,i think most people will go with Android phone.Bcz it's easier here in Asia in some platform,like "software features"" multitasking" plays a great role according to the price we have to deal with our wages. I can make sure that,most people will choose an android better for all tasks.   by the way,Vivo's camera is far better than iPhone's.I Don't know why Marques didn’t like it.
Other apple products price to performance is dog shit
I definitely like the fact that samsung and other devices use fast charging. They have big batteries but on the go id choose an android with fast charging
Android vs iPhone? Which line of Android phones? from which manufacturer? You can't compare all of the zillion different android phones from a million OEMs to just one line of phones from Apple.  Android vs iOs would have made more sense!  or Samsung Galaxy S line vs iPhone
Its always amazing to see you both in a same frame
The only issue i see with the comparrison in this video is that at some points, like sustainability you are like "Oh, lets just look at flagship androids like samsung and sony and not the super sustainable ones"  Then when it comes to screen its like "Oh yeah samsung has the best screen, but we have to look at all androids together so apple wins"  I think its better to either go "Ok, samsung vs apple" or "Ok apple vs android, taking all phones into account, so as there are more super sustainable android options android would win that one"
"Call that on iPhone, no wait we call that on android". Sorry best Flagship android.
Being a big youtuber gives big responsibility moreover saying stupid comparison thats can be justified can bring hate. Markass brownle's channel is a apple one but i never expected these kind of stupid video from this channel 😡😠 understand one thing there are many countries other than UK/US
Mkbhd sucks he is more towards iPhone 🤮
With how eco conscious they are, I would have 100% given that to android almost no question.   Because Android isn't as locked down it can be repurposed. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and order matters.   Neither really "reduce" in this context, but Reuse is really important. There are so many projects someone who is eco conscious can use their old android for without that much technical knowhow. Like a quick google for "useful things to use an old android for" returns loads of lists full of interesting and not particularly difficult projects that allow you to utilise the less locked down nature of the ecosystem. Sure you can do some of these on an iPhone if there's an appropriate app built, but there is so much more customisation.   As an example, I use a very old android as a built-in smart display in my computer tower to display temps.   Recycling is good, but Reusing is better.  Also (this does play into eco a bit too), with android you have more choice. You can get an S22 Ultra if you want to get something that matches Apple's flagships, but you can also get phones that compete for entirely different needs than iPhones. So you're not limited to buying a big phone with an unreplacable battery and the glass sandwich design.
Smart Stylus support, usb c, foldable editions, max customization. These are all wins for android!!
Love the collab! Need more! -Subscriber of both
@MrWhoseTheBoss younsound like you need some sleep and a vacation bro. What are you even wearing lol... Your voice sounds a bit weird if you know what I mean
I like how you've picked colors for iPhone and android on the scorecard. Green bubble blue bubble. Nice one
Really? This is some bs. It's extremely opinionated. There's very little objective about this video. Come on Arun. I'm not gonna go into details but I reckon alot of viewers will agree with me.
Loved the vibe of the video. But essentially, to me it came across as both handing easy wins to iPhone based on their very specific use cases; both the bloggers have defaulted to doing things that iOS does well, while diminishing the significance of those things that it doesn't. One example would be multi-window multitasking which was just brushed aside with what amounted to "we don't do it and neither should you". Also: Anrdoid devices cover all price spectrums whereas iOS devices cover only the top end.
A draw on widgets no way customization is key bro, some of us we like to explore and make our phones unique.
Your friend is a dog to Apple
I think it was a bit unfair
Android is always better
My ocd relaxing at 12:15 😌
The things that is locked to a specific platform should not have such a massive say in these kind of videos.
The two most beautiful voices from the two most brilliant tech channels! I absolutely adore this collab!
2of the best tech met
4:17, Apple loses because of the lack of USB-C
Maybe it’s because I’ve not bought a high end phone in the last few years (been gifts from people; iPhone), I’ve never once had good battery life but we shall see in future if I buy an iPhone.
At this point Marques is Just an i sheep....
It wasn't Fair at all sorry android.
I could not even make the end of this video, I am an iphone user, and yet most of the arguments for the iphone were based on self preference in the face of differing facts complete waste of time.  Thats 7 minutes of my life I wont get back.
Not a good video, all are subjective thought.
It should've been "Android vs iOS" or "Galaxy vs iPhone". Not "All other phones using Android vs two phones from Apple". This is unfair and wrong in so many aspects.
i think far too many points were just handed to iphone. oh its a draw. iphone...
Says iPhone is better but uses an Android as a daily phone
Well vidtos is awfull. Just liking Steve Jobs ass 20 mins. 0 objectivity
Great evaluation, great content! But hey, where's rickrolling? 😩
Photography is for Samsung and pixel ... iPhone doesn't stand a chance ... iPhone smoothens the facial tone which sucks 🤮
u probably guys got a fat check from apple
I LIKE my S22 Ultra more so it gets more use, but I TRUST my iPhone more when it comes to overall longevity.   I admit that I upgrade my Android devices way more frequently because  of the features offered. When it comes to iPhones, the experience is reliable and consistent no matter which one you have, so I find no need to upgrade at all and usually keep it at home as a back up.  I can deal with some of Apple's restrictions like the inability to download  third party apps, but If ios offered some of the features of Android such as multitasking, better customization, and USB C, even a diehard Android user like me would find it hard not to ditch android altogether.
Android is better.
Android phones may win with more customization and flexibility if we are only talking about the different aspects of phones,  BUT the whole iOS community is just too convenient and user-friendly for example airdrop, data syncing when changing a phone
For a hammer everything looks like a nail 😶😐
U nailed the sound quality, at just enough good. No eko No bad background sound etc. Really enjoyed it alot. I also think that the topic and just the fact that both of you in the same video is what we wanted!
The collab we din't know we needed! Thanks Champs & keep elevating
iPhone would be "accuracy" in terms of confined focus to iron out apps that result in top tier optimization like great photos, gaming, battery, and ram for what they're worth. Then there's also updates coming to iPhone first when it comes to features that eventually appear on iPhone or Android  Android would be "precision" with having all these options in which phone they want, while also having that sense of freedom to do what you want in a phone. There are also some Androids with SD card slots. That's not to say, android phones are that far behind the likes of an iPhone camera, ram, or even features though.
Iphone user: I have $$$$ phone.  Inside 😪😪😪  Android user: $$$ phone but great value for money 💰. Inside 😁😁😁. I have tried both phones.
Hmmm quite biased
You can do everything an iPhone does in Android even if it's kinda underwhelming but vice versa,it isn't like that.but like they say for what it does,Iphone does it BETTER :)
Not valid compare. Flagship iPhone vs a huge range of phones.  Also file manager? Devices you can connect physically and wirelessly? Very different with both. Siverely lacking in one. Also...usb-c? All wins for Android..it's like a versatility vs the illusion of luxury.. You need to think about it a little more. Love the rest of your videos though.
This is a bias vid
How about connectivity? Android phones connect with anything by wire or BT. Apple is always a hassle to connect and/or transfer files. This is one of the major drawbacks I think, together with Apple deciding what's best for you instead of giving the freedom to do what you please with an android phone.
Absolutely loved this video! I love all the work you put in but the simplicity of this was just fabulous.
Title is wrong I thing ? You're compare phones.
Finally iOS is better
Finally iOS is better
That's the same ass reason I use an s21 instead of s22 finally someone understands me
The colab of the century
The better phone should get a higher scorer per category. I think that's how the scoring should be.
So the only reason Andriod didn't win the screen round was cause MKB likes flat screen?? Which androids have to ok except S22
Android Has:- Flappy Bird 😆
󰦉
In terms of battery, Samsungs s22 is better than apples battery. Samsung needs to learn your daily pattern and could give you a 2 day battery life but on the iPhone it just doesn't learn what are your daily apps Samsung does keep it optimised so do iPhone but Samsung gives you the feature to optimise about almost every app. The voice assistance on both devices are good but for a faster reply the apple is definitely way ahead.
Finally iOS is better
Android is the best
Have you done a video on the Tesla phone yet dude
I respect both of you to bits. But you can't deduct points from android just because MKBHD doesn't use a feature... I have an A52s and  I open YouTube in the quarter of the screen, and the 3/4 of the screen is a social app, eCommerce website, even chrome.... I wish you would have been fairer in your scoring
Why's the display a tie, lol.
I can already see without watching they will say it's a draw
I don't have iPhone so I cannot like it like Android.  It's wrong to love someone else's wife, right? 😂
Legends collab
Authentification was a huge factor for me in my last purchase decision. I don't want to use FaceID and I actually heard from another person who was using an iPhone before that she switched to Android because of FaceID. (I have been an Android user since forever)
biased
I switched from android to Apple because android kept breaking on me and its software was horribly unstable, and I wanted something that just plain worked.
Anybody noticed that both of u were dressed the opposite of each other he wore jeans and u shorts, he wore a black tee and u a white tee and even his phone was black and urs white🤯
First video that bored me🥵
I love android
We totalny need more videos like that
Not at all fair comparison 😑
I know phones that will dust both any Samsung or any iphone .... Y'all just don't mention them cause your not being paid heavily to and if it's not about money than it means y'all both don't know anything about any phone
You guyz missed many options, iPhone batteries dies more than android, you can easily bost android batteries and it works fine but for iPhones you will need to replace it
Comparing the latest iPhone line up to the best features of all android phones is unfair also…
Android wins in my opinion... Because as a consumer, it don't feel locked to a brand. iPhone locked you out to its brand while Android has flexibility and modability
"Let's take a moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his content to entertain us"

The display thing annoyed me right off the bat. Can't trust MKBHD again. IPhone displays are no where near as good as Samsung's flagships. Is he half blind?
The Two Legends IPhone and S22 Ultra  The Two Legends YouTubers👍
For a phone that has a company that's the richest in the world by networth value, I'll say the iPhone is intentionally underperforming, these guys could give you the best technology there is but they're not giving you everything because they want you to keep coming back every year for a new phone, they're slowly releasing their latest tech and features to keep them alive in the market
19:41   Starts here 😂😂😂 Btw i love the collab 🔥🔥
Such let down ,video sponsored
How can Android and iPhones be compared?  Android is an open source OS------- a platform on which different brands can build smartphones.   iPhones are apple's smartphone.   It's like comparing different cars which use the same engine to a car manufactured by a rich company which makes their own car engine.  Android OS is used to make a variety of products including high-end to budget phones.  SO OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE BUDGET PHONES But as for apple, it focuses on quality (---------i guess because i've never owned an iphone) AND HAS MORE EXPENSIVE PHONES   Anyways I cannot hate Android❤️ which hangs lesser than my windows PC. STAN ANDROID STAN GOOGLE STAN PLAY STORE

This is the kind of video that makes me realise no matter how good android appears to be, I’m just too used to iOS that I’ll never switch. I’m probably missing out on better phones. I just can’t operate them intuitively, so Apple has my bucks for ever alas. I’m probably not alone
My S22+ went out of charge recently and I asked my buddy with 13 Pro Max to reverse charge it and we discovered that it doesn't have this function. That was a surprise for me. Also unlike Marques I'm a constant user of a multi-window mode and it really helps in many scenarios. I'm not even talking about DEX and PS2 emulators that are also very specific things for specific people. Android gives your a personal computer experience and feeling. Iphone/ios doesn't give me such vibes but wins in terms of battery and maybe smoothness. So the comparison really depends on one's preferences and usage habits.
I am sorry i have to stop watching half way, bith of are doing some comments and marking which seems to be nothing more than iphone trumpet. Atleast be honest
This title is wrong. Merging other brands as android against iphone is weird. The only thing other brands have in common is OS. So unless you're comparing operating systems, the comparison should be on an individual basis. iPhone v Samsung v vivo.....
Not gonna lie my phone has MIUI 13
Something is off about Marques🤔. He lacks his usual charisma in this video.
This video was very very boring.
But still no separate alarm and notification control on iPhone... 😏
8:20 real madrid
How you not talk about Software Support, Android is way better than iOS. Im on the latest version of Android for the last 5+ years
For me Android is better than iphone
So the score board is just what Markus says
I use iPhone as my first and last smartphone from 2011. The only reason today I want to go to Android is built in "Call recorder" into android phones.
The topic is always ALL of Android vs. iPhone. Wonder why that is...
What was the point of this video you knew he is an iPhone fan boy & you still give iPhone points even tho you disagreed so not sure whats the point in this video
Mark is literally a iPhone geek
Bravo.....What a biased review and comparison.
No one can deny that has been killing it lately
The result of this video disappoints me ngl I feel like the battery and the camera should have never been won by iPhone and Arun seems kinda biased with it in this video.
Best game changer in android is call recording
Well I've confirmed why I watch Arun and not Markus
With the camera section I think the sony xperia pro I should have featured more.  And s22 display takes the win
What a collab😇🔥
I want Tim cock & Sundar Pichai in Episode 2
If you ask an isheep a question about iphone and Android don't expect good thing about android, what ever crap apple did is the best in their sight for an example imagine someone picked your phone unaware before you know your lock screen settings has been changed without logging in. In isheep sight that feature is the best, the boring interface for years is the best to them, and so on and so forth, anyway is a matter of choice. Lastly wait and see how many ram iphone 14 will have for the little customization they did I'm just looking at people praising for using little ram to operate because it so optimize, no,is because nothing to pulled the ram underground i have been saying this for years.
Missing repairablity but overall it was fair comparison
I get why MKBHD choose iPhone over android. It's because of phycology, I would choose a phone made in my country on any given day eventhough it's crap.
You can't ask an apple biased, almost fanboy person, to choose which one is better. I mean hahaha... That being said, at least he said, at the end, that a lot of items are very personal, at least he said it... When you talk about cameras, it's utterly surprising that people still go with Apple, considering how incredible the cameras on the recent Xperias are. I get it, those are aimed to pros, or at least people who are used to use cameras regularly, but yeah.
So anti repair Apple wins eco consciousness vs Fairphone, what a joke. Also only Americans care about iMessage and Facetime
After seeing the IOS 16  update video and this one....... I feel like I should get an iPhone next..... However budget is a mess :_)
2b fair I thought he was just a copycat of mkbhd but now they collabed.
Apple only make iPhones But Android makes more like Joyui,  Imui, sonyui, more
I dont wanna lie, you guys kind off overrated ios and didn't mention all of androids features
13:35 Dex matters a lot to me & many people I know
love this!
Good video
Wow I watched a 20 min Apple commercial 🥱
I dream of you give me a phone, I was watching this video and I slept, then I dream we are testing s22 and iPhone 13pro max bluetooth, we connect both to different Bluetooth speaker and we're moving alone a road we left Mr mkd with the speaker, it's very funny, when we're coming back after testing on our way you gave me a phone call A plus, it very funny as I dream it
Samsung ♡~♡                             )
Android
You sure about thumbnail? You should have given him the iphone😂😂
cool
mkbhd is a living bias towards apple
you want war
I see the Android sheep assembling here like "Android has too much customization" I am an Android User but after this video I feel like I've been missing out.
Nah -It should be Android vs iOS - features comparison. or it should be iPhone vs Samsung S22 Ultra (or some other flagship), otherwise, this comparison starts looking very clumsy.
I am having issues in my Iphone, I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing it. I got an Iphone 13 pro max with the top specs but I tend to go back to my old Samsung Note 10+ when I do online shopping because when I go to online shops like gilt or even those actual online stores of brands like versace, gucci etc. . . The pictures just won't load or some will and some doesn't and I don't experience that on my 3y.o samsung phone. . .
iPhone 6 is even way more better then some new android phones now
They don't have any content and they're in new game , and that game called manipulation 😂😂😂 Yow buyers if you like any phone whether its android or ios device if you like it just go through the specs sheet and if you like it just buy it as your preference. Eco system only matters to Usa and for Europe countries other than that who cares 😂
This was a very bias video I didn't enjoy it at all you just agreed to all what the black guy said a never once fight for Android and u are the same one who said s 22 ultra is the best phone for 2022 very disappointed at you
This video is gonna cause Android fan boys lose sleep lmao. Both are great, competition is good for the consumer.
Mhhh... Compelling if your in USA/UK. But in Africa. That doesn't cut it. Its android for us. Its cheep. And has a lot of free things (thats super important). And really as a tech enthusiast, i like freedom more than flex, i pick variety....its android for me
My favourite tech YouTubers in the same video . Keep doing these videos ❤️
the problem you did here is that at some points you compared phone to phone (hardware, like ram and camera) and other time s you compared os to os (software and features)
Truth be told: Samsung was ahead of Apple before Back in February 2019 when they Launched the Samsung s10 with its punch hole display. And the iPhone still had the notch. So to conclude Samsung is already ahead in terms of the screens, Lol Just saying Though😎😌♥️
Great video and Collab. I do think though that this comparison was always going to be for an eco system that's built for one phone vs one built for millions of phones. It was always going to be a biased comparison but hey 🤷🏿
most of iPhone‘s app need money
this was biased
split screen is barely used hahahahahha
All I can say is: meh
it's strange when they talk about value when the score is 1.5 vs 7.5. doesn't all those they just discussed be considered as part of the value they will get from a phone? to me it sounds almost a no brainer with 1.5 vs 7.5, the value should go to iphone regardless of the models in the spectrum you choose. oh btw, i find it strange they kept talking about android vs iphone because iphone is a family of phone models for apple and the OS is actually iOS. well maybe iphone is synonymous to iOS as the ipad uses iPad OS but still, android is an OS unlike S22 bla bla and pixel
Androids have airdrop like features too jsyk You can use nearby share on any android with a chrome book as well  You can also use quick share on any Samsung laptop and Samsung phone. But these 'tech enthusiasts' don't know about this but I do.
Fuck I phones
i would get an iphone if they took out the fugly notch and made it usb-c.
That why i unsubscribed to Mkbhd channel the guys always has favours american brands namely apple's mac,iphone,google pixel.Asian makerts are so under-rated such as this video. But i find them best at offering the users the best experience. Dislike from me sorry.
People are arguing in here so i would like to make it clear. You should get the best phone for yourself, not what others think is the best. The phone designs should feel comfortable for you and the way you use it.
20:08 you can see Marquees waiting for fist bump he will never receive.
I am in love with samsung as it is open for everything and easy to use and doesnt need any program to download my favorite songs or need app to change ringtones.  I used iphone when it first came and would hate it bec i couldnt change this and that and i needed pc or laptop. I cant even transfer my old pictures to pc bec i have to buy more space which is a big joke.  Thanks to samsung that makes our life easy and i feel free to use it the way i want. There is something special with samsung phones
Bruh.. We are competing a single brand with a multitude of brands as a single entity
For real y'all stop relying on these dudes who have stopped being about the tech and are more about the content.
Arun and Macus,  My two favorite YouTuber,  very disappointed, it means that I have to throw 1,300€ Euros in the rubbish bin because my samsung galaxy s22 ultra is rubbish 🗑.  For me is very obvious that Apple has pay to (Arun) the fly to California an  Finance these propaganda agents android,  especially against the biggest competitor which is Samsung. It's like give people no choice but to buy iPhone  For me is the most dishonest review that I ever see .  Well play.  No fair guys try to make money in the Honest way.
It’s great when YouTubers collaborate for their content. Especially when I subscribe to both their channels already. Lol
Great video :) my only complain is  the first draw - Android notchless ( :D ) display is the total winer.
im sorry but this is kind of biased lol.
customisation is a draw, hands down iPhone is poor with customisation. Lockscreen can't be it. Looks like the boss is not challenging, but instead bowing down to all MKBHDs opinions. No disrespect to anyone, both are real influencers and the best creators on YT. iphone = US centric phone and Android = rest of the world period.
Amazing collaboration
This should happen more often
What a Collab
Some other categories I would've liked to hear about are Durability (how long it lasts, and physical durability of the phone), Repairs (cost of repair/ ease of repair), assesories/3rd party items for phone( earbuds, cases, ease of use of 3rd party items like off brand speakers/earbuds), connections/signal ( what gets better signal, better wifi connects, bluetooth connections, call connections. Even though your provider may differ hardware in connections can drastically change your options as well) ect...
I love Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G
Literally Paid review by iPhone..🥴
This whole video is coming from Apple fan boy which Marquez is. This video would have been different if Aaron made it alone.
Nice Video! :D i'm an Android guy and my daily is the Z Fold, maybe in the future you will be able to make a video similar to this but by form factor, like "normal" phones VS foldable ones
"Matte Black Everything By The Way"...
Calling screens a draw is already stupid
You are going to start a war.
Apple king 💥💥♥️🥳 If u add one or 2 points at last iphone is the winner android must made like iphone’s security and iPhone is like long lasting asset 😌 Note . If point of security that  leads iphone away from android
“If you’re counting performance as performance than yeah the iPhone wins” LOL!
all answers are base only on mr. marquez. not a collab its interview
These guys look to shy
Hi. I am a great fan split screen on android devices. That's one of  android's best features! I use it to study materials from two apps. I could be watching a YouTube video while fact-checking on another site. It also let me read multiple versions of the Bible. I do not have to use more than one device sometimes. I am a fan of both of you 😍.
THAT'S BS
Based Apple User VS Non Based every phone enjoyer.
Amazing how much vitriol this video has brought out in Android users. Seriously, show us where Steve touched you on the doll 😂
There's a flow in this comparison. Iphone is one brand which makes use of ios and Android is an operating system used by many brands in which some are below par you should have narrowed it to a particular brand and then compare it with the equivalent in terms of release date and functionality because some  android (even samsung) phone might be created to carter for people with low funds eg samsung A13 come after A53 but A53 is better and bigger than A13
Yeah I'm not fucking with MKBHD.
For me there is no going back from Samsung Ultras. The best phones ever.
I stopped when they gave iPhone a point for the battery
I love iPhone a lot and I think that matters the most, so I give 5 points to iPhone  - MKBHD
Great video guys!  That missed fist bump from Marques in the end hurt my insides thou...
In my aspects they are draw and even Android can win im Iphone user I don't say that like apple wins it's on your choice gonna try Android next time.
its so subjective and unfair
He loves his iPhone.
MKBHD, didn`t expect that from you!
I love iphone more than android but i dont think it is that lopsided as what this video implies.
IPhone biased as usual
This literally looks like Iphone biased FAN review. Every segment general android phones are compared to Flagship iphone 13 Pro or Pro max. Specially, fast charge and battery performance both need to be considered. In this case Oneplus is a clear winner.
1:08 look at the battery
Good for MKBHD for hanging up with great YouTubers, that will empower him to grow up more. Good also for Whosetheboss to hang out with smaller and developing YouTubers, it’s always good to give it back to the younger and smaller generation, such a humble guy ❤️. What a king 👑.
Writes to repair
Some iPhones got 6 or more years of major updates
fake android is the best and the battery of iphone is trash no matter what
I feel like something you didn't factor in is - apple creates bad trends that the rest of smartphone manufacturers follow, for example: right to repair, headphone jack, removing the charging brick.. especially with the charging brick my problem with removing it is, it's actually worse for the environment... And while they create these stupid trends they steal ideas from others and make them better.. I feel like if they didn't have such a fanbase people wouldn't be so good towards apple
Mkbhd is really iphone fanboi
I use iPhone for everyday call and browsing. but I like Android for it's flexibility in customization and extremely vast range of apps and usage.  what I like about iPhone: It runs smooth and cool. No heating issue on Mobile data like Android.  Apps never crashed.  Recent Apps stays in memory nicely without affecting battery much. Good battery. Reduce White Point lets dim display extremely low at night natively. --- What I hate in iPhone which is available in Android very easily. No Download manager and Worse file manager. Torrenting not possible. Lack of customization.  Same UI for all generations of ios and ipad os looks boring. Camera is not fun like Samsung.  No Type C. Free software number is huge. Many apps comes Android version first in my country.  Folder music player I miss most. Because there are some audio file nunbering in a folder and I need to play them as they appear in sequence in the folder. and Folder Music Player App does this great. No speed data is available in iOS googe map navigation and so on.   however still I use I phone for better resale value and brand value in community. If I had enough money, I will always buy a samsung flagship along with whatever iphone I used. That's my experienced opinion as an ios and Android user
You should do Samsung vs iPhone
1:08 69%
i used to have an android phone for decades and when my mom said that she will give me an iphone, i was a bit doubtful cause i’m not familiar on its os but then after a week i’m used to it now and i was shocked that iphone is having such a clean and simple but then good and friendly system that easy to get used to
Biased video on my opinion
One of the worst content and rating did by Mr whose the boss
Just a regular video of mkbhd getting an interview by arun
I am a samsung user and even I would choose the iphone for photos 100%.
Draw on display is this is a joke just look I phone display and 22 ultra 😑
so many apple haters xd<  dont buy overpriced shit stick with android if hate much, and its no harm to admit iphones are getting better<
Nononono iPhone is not more eco friendly they are extremely hard to fix they may be more carbon neutral but with hard repairs and paired components. And not to mention activation lock which prevents use of phones that are not stolen
In my opinion I felt this vedio was like a large iphone ad ,if would say the sheer number of phones that android have over the iphone ,there is an android for each person for what he or she wants and the price also goes towards the android , iphone is just the best average of the phone world while android provides personalized phone to all.
MKBHD sponsored by Apple
A lot of small features together makes android much better.  For example: - s pen/ copy image to clipboard - copy to clipboard as a whole feature (iphone delete clipboard content every 15min, no history) - nova level customization - Dex  - photos edition  (layers, precise cut, erase details...) -Usb C (sic!)  These features maybe not for every one, but for me are "must have".   Most of all, this things justify price of high end (samsung in my case) phones.  For iPhone and its lack of feature i can give max half what for real flagship (and give it to my grandma :P).
TODAY in devices i cant afford!...
What about the fold displays on android ?
this confirmed my recent thoughts as a lifelong android user. My next phone will 100% be an iphone, just waiting to see the 14 pro max, otherwise I might just get the Iphone 13 pro max. It would be my first iphone ever. I really love android, but these days, the performance is so close and every single reasons mkbhd said about the phone working without as many hiccups and being stable is whats really important. I have an s20 fe that has deteriorated so quickly. The camera always lags and hangs for along time when trying to use the quick lockscreen button, and then stutters and the shutter doesnt become available (potentially missing the shot). Then, when I want to edit and upload to social media, it bugs out and the quality sucks, and social media is too important these days for the type of quality my phone puts out lol. Regular photos are beautiful, but then the video SUCKS. Its shaky as hell and has weird microstutters and artifacts every so often. Its so bizarre. Ive been on android long enough (since nexus 5) to know that every android phone has some weird shit like this pop up at some point. Its such a shame, and I feel like the pixel line was the best chance at a premium andoird experience that could compete with apple. Now I plan on just getting an iphone as a main phone and possibly getting a budget pixel 6a or 7a or whatever comes out next as a private personal line on google fi. Finally I can say apple has enough customizations that I also think look a bit better than android widgets. The custom rom days are gone, and most android users want the same polished experience and hardware/software relationship on their androids that apple has with their phones. Pixel launcher and UI is great, but I just feel like Google's glory days are ending here. Google assistant is still amazing though, and Ill never use alexa or siri.
This video looks like Arun is trying to give his honest opinion about android phones and trying to think that MKBHD will agree on his points but MKBHD has already made his mind that whatever Arun says, na… iPhone is always best. Sadly, Arun has no voice in this video and had to agree on whatever MKBHD has to say. Probably both should have a pen and paper, rate the features, give their own score and then argue why they think it’s better. Just my opinion.. ✌️
9:50 Iphone already won lol!
Well.... I'm an android user for the free stuff i get from mods and hacked apk lol
1:49 it leaves a dent in my hand ,😂😂
When  mrboss  popped up my phone on the screen i got so confused (the asus one) since im watching on it right now
Is it only me or MKBHD kinda seems not interested in this conversation
It's amazing how until this day we call it Android vs iPhone not iOS. Which Android brand exactly should we compare to Apple's iPhone? Samsung's Android offers the ultimate experience nowadays... No? The logic if usages comes down to the user... But what are we comparing exactly?
was it an interview or VS ?
you guys comparing with only iphone perspective 😂😂 it's not fair comparison tho
Use both Android and iOS and they have pros and cons. If I had to have one, tough as that would be, I would probably go iPhone due to my ecosystem. But win-win and pointless comparing as it is subjective as to whether photos are better and subjective as to whether you are more comfortable using iPhone (tried my 70s+ parents with Android and they hated it, simply would not use it and yet loved iPhone. They are not techies).
When two iphone users meet
As a heavy apple user, I tried the redmi’s camera, and I was so impressed. The zoom is bar none the best I have ever tried.
apple and samsung rn   ( @ _ @ )
Looking at it from your part of the world, the comparison might be justified, but from Africa and some other countries, Apple stands no chance. Android is user-friendly, you can share things easier. This is the first time I do not agree with you, Boss. A part of me feels like Apple sponsored this video.
Is this an interview or a comparison?
I will just share my opinion ok.  In Photography one should be tied  It is really depends on a user since it is either consistency, or creativity. When It comes to photography, as photographer, it will be always choose the creativity and flexible Camera. But as normal people, it is 50/50 choosing between having flexible Camera or The consistent Camera.  For the features, Iphone has some pretty usefull festures. Airdrop, shareplay, facetime. Those are usefull cuz that is how most people see it, the galaxy has those features too but they were not being noticed by many people. You can share play in the google duo same as the share play in Iphone. The google duo is also a facetime, but in Andoroid Version. And also the airdrop is great feature, but galaxy have same feature as the airdrop which is called, quick share and share link feature. There are chances that airdrop loses the quality of the image, even in imessage. But the quick share link is completely sharing the full quality of files consistently.  Those features of samsung and apple just works almost the same. The only big difference are, samsung features works in universal. Like it work on Iphone, and any other android device. Airdrop, shareplay, facetime only works on Iphone. They are only usefull since that's how the Iphone groups hype the iphone features. Quick Share link of samsung is even better than airdrop. You can quick share link to an Iphone, but you can't do airdroping file to android. Also, Airdrop is annoying, when you are playing games in your phone, there will be suddenly a poped up in the middle of the screen of an airdrop file from an annoying friend trying to annoy you while you are playing. Google duo is just works same as facetime, but the difference is, google duo is universal. It can be done in Iphone, and in any other android phone. Facetime is only on Iphone. Iphone maybe good at forcing people to move to iphone, but doesn't mean they are better.  When it comes to more useful simple feature, that is what Iphone is lack of. Why Can't apple have another back gesture for the right side of the phone? Apple just announce a landscape face id, while samsung with no notch can have a face recognition works well even in Up side down. Other simple usefull feature that Iphone doesn't have is clipboard.  It is a very simple feature to add in the keyboard and it is very usefull. Which you can copy and copy more text at once, and you can paste and paste them all at once in anywhere. You will not have to go back and forth between 2 apps just to copy and paste copy and paste....  Another simple thing that is simple useful feature that Iphone doesn't have is, secure folder. Iphone may have added security on the hidden pictures in their gallery app. But it is nothing compare on having the secure folder, not just hidden photos but, another hidden accounts, apps, and more... One more very simple thing to change in Iphone, it is not very big deal but, it may be deal breaker for others. It is how ios keep all the back gestures/buttons on the left side. Not many people are right handed, and not many people use 2 hands on their phone all the time. Their reachability feature is useless, one handed mode is a lot better in many reasons. Other thing that ios is still lacks on is, costumization, it is not simple feature as what samsung can do on costumization, but apple is a big company, come on apple it should be simple for you to add more of costumization on your devices. Other thing that apple should add to their iphones is, usb C. Apple can do it in their macbook and ipad. Why not in Iphone? Everyone knows what is USB C capable of compare to lightning port. Not just in fast charging but, also better connectivity in external devices.  I don't get what is the real reason why apple are so slow. Even just some simple thing like, adding numbers row in there keyboard couldn't be done. Typing a long wifi password that it is mixed with letters and numbers in Iphone is awful. Other simple feature that should be added on apple devices is, having to set up the volumes on specific apps. Like you can have it on galaxy which is very usefull to me since I do music while playing games sometimes. Or have multi task having youtube/video playing while playing games sometimes. It is very useful for me since I treat the multi tasking thing as a very useful feature. I can costumize the volume of the game to be shut up for a moment while I listen to something else that is playing in the background app. Also the very last simple useful feature that samsung has and that Iphone couldn't afford is wifi QR code. Wifi sharing in Iphone is good, but it only works in Iphone. Having someone who is not an Iphone user will not be able to recieve the wifi share from your Iphone. Samsung done it better with its QR code maker for the wifi. If you wanna share a wifi to others, have the QR code on your samsung and let them scan it for them to connect to wifi. Apple is a big company, and just some simple things that are very useful to add in their iphones, they couldn't just be done it.
Found this video halfway playing on my TV and i was like No Way IOS Devices could have more points than Android devices.... but i can say from the points you enumerated...humm it's a bit fair.... you should have spectators or random people and ask then from their experiences with their devices!
Android dare to experiment all kinds of things from samsung folding phone to all kinds of stuff like the oppo motorized camera. Where Apple might have difficulty with that. Imagine they trying new stuff and failed miserably, would that ruin their image?
They should have said this video is sponsored by Apple 🍎 🤣, how can anyone buy overrated expensive trash.
just spotted  sam sheffar 6:11
The video should be titled an interview with iphone fan boy😂  Cable issue of iphone didnt get any mention  the fact that apple users use google suit didnt get mentioned or considered in the software department  besides Google pure OS wasn't even discussed which actually is better optimized than most custom skins and nost importantly ios 16 and andriod 13 got like 30 sec in the video,  and most importantly repairability a strong point of android was completely ignored in the Recycling sector 😂😂
This is an opinion piece, very heavily influenced by user preference and brand loyalty. I personally don’t subscribe to the Apple experience as I feel you become more locked into the Apple brand, I.e. Phone/iPad/MacBook etc and initially it was difficult to get Microsoft compatibility. I’m a big user of Office Suite and Outlook for mail, so went the good old Windows Phone route……that didn’t finish well, 😀. Android was an easy conversion of platforms for what I wanted. I now have the S22 Ultra, best smartphone for my needs. I am getting great battery life, great photos and it runs as smooth as a gravy sandwich
I can see that you guys just sat down and had a chat, love the natural flow, and it's nice to see you do indeed have different opinions in places (like the photography)
The video got 1.5 milion views in 15 hours 😭😭
I feel MKBHD is biased towards the iphone in a lot of things. Battery should go to Android. Display to Android as well.
Yo Mrwhosetheboss I definitely enjoyed your video and you collaborated with my favourite tech YouTube Mk great video great calab anyway nuff respect to Mrwhosetheboss 👊🏾 keep it up one love to tech📲
For apple 12gb ram is only 6gb
Samsung vs Apple. Who wins?
iOS also destroys android when it comes to features
customisation, repairability and overall durability should have been checked. they are pretty big in my book and keeping the headphone jack, usb-c, stereo speakers, ir blaster ect are all things i use all the time. those apps that you mentioned claiming to be more important to alot of users, i dont think id ever use them let alone heard of them tbh. but its all personal preference. its no competition for me, andriod all the way. and when i can get all the stuff i need for $250aud, why wouldnt i.
android user🤓
Been apple since the 3g.but then switched to Samsung s21 in 2022.and wouldn't go back. Just love the ability to change just about everything. Over apple giving you what they want.
Was this filmed in the US or UK?! Great video collab!!
I phone slaves
I was talking about how stupid Siri was and Siri said “that wasn’t very nice” so I laughed and told her her programmers needed to teach her to do more.
What a bunch of bs. Draw on the display? My ass what a biased video. Why not compare best of ios with best of android which is obviously s22 ultra. I didn't see you talking about the 13 mini but you want to talk about lesser android phones when a better is available at almost the same price?
MKBHD is iPhone fanboi 😐
RIP Xiaomi
Useless score because iPhone is not that great to have this score.
I already can’t trust my 13 pro battery lol that thing is ruined its at 91%
mkhbd is a loyal customer of iphpne for sure
apple ke dallle .....hahaha
The video is not fair ..  I can surely say that
Finally 😍Handsdown comparison
To me iPhone is like the Rolex of phones, while android is your everyday reliable gadget. Android is better because it caters to every individual needs.
In your opinion, can android keep up with iPhone sooner or later?
In matter of fact the phone is most probably is used for social media and some files like such and for that regular use you don't require costly heavy phone like samsung ultra or the iphone u can just use the best stable phone with decent camera and good battery with quick charging in an stable software phone , this is what works the most and sells the lot. While reviewing please don't consider the features rather stability always wins vs features in phones
such a great video!
a big win for android in my case is spotify ngl, apple music isn't that good for me tbh. also, being able to download and install apps from other sources is a blessing
The boss is kinda sad 😭
Time to read some angry android users comments🍿
I have both and honestly it's all self preference like both phones are really good and an iphone jailbroken is amazing and a rooted android is also amazing both have pros and cons I reckon if you got the money buy both.
Me watching this, I know Lenny is gonna laugh and say android is trash.... but ill give apple a try
two big reviewers and they called display a tie between the two. i just wonder how good they really are at this
Andriod (Software) vs iPhone (Hardware)   Oranges vs Apples  Or is it just me??
I switched to iPhone 13 Pro Max after an eternity on Android. One thing every reviewer forgets to mention is the app store, more specifically the apps themselves.  On Android you pay once and the app is yours to keep on every device you will own. On Apple you pay subscriptions for almost anything.  Personally if I knew about this before I would have stayed with Android as these costs add up unless Apple's app store rolls back to the pay once system. It kind of feels that this restricts you from enjoying your phones full potential.
Nyc apple advertising 😂😂😂😂
The fact that aaron uses iPhone and is praising Samsung and marquess uses Samsung and is praising iPhone is hilarious to me
Mkbhd and Arun 🔥🔥
Bringind up an i phone nerd .. who says i phone also in his dreams .. I think its a great accomplishment 😂
This was disappointing compared to the quality of each of your videos. The scoring method and practices you used was so poor that it was distracting from the actual subject.
Bruh if it can play games it's fine
great colllab.  but i think you forgot one huge topic.  with an android you buy the pfone and you are done. with an iphone you now need to use all the other apple stuff or it doesnt work as good.  and if you have to use all apple the pricing gets even higher.
Photography was supposed to be a draw, that's cheat.
I agree with most of the list, but there are two areas where I think Android actually does a little better. First, having USB-C is a huge win for convenience and the eco-factor.   Second, when it comes to updates, it's kind of a mixed bag. Yes, Apple technically does provide five years of software updates, but they often lock new features behind new devices even if the older devices are perfectly capable of using those features.
Sponsored sponsored.  It's better but i like the i phone how is that far judging.  you shall use me as a dislike button.
Display should have gone to Android a bit biased definetly
The video length is exactly 20:22! So perfect!
I have an S22 ultra and I am truly impressed by it its the perfect phone for me. Its just my opinion
If Size of phone makes a phone fall on a certain category, why doesn't the price matter too?  Iphones are hella expensive, compare them with hella expensive android phones ..
Lol, what phone did you use to take that last clip??😂
iPhone is garbage Imagine using an iPhone LOL
One category I feel was missing (especially when talking personal assistants) is privacy and security.
You cannot show battery percentage in an iPhone. Instant win for Android
Ye bah or eshay bah
Honestly we keep having this conversation every year and the answer never changes. The IPhone is usually the winner but the answer is usually buy what's best for you. Honestly this video could be renamed to things I like/dislike about android and iphone or something around that.
I don’t agree with the picture taking, I had taken better pictures with my Samsung S7 edge than many of my IPhone users.  Even with my 13, no comparison to what Samsung takes
A draw in customisation just bcos Apple introduced lockscreen customisation?!..hilarious. This video reeks of bias. I use an iPhone but Android blows iOS out of the water in this department.
I think apple wins with figer print sesor as in s22 ultra the  inscreen sensor isnt working with screen saver
Marquez is just an apple fan boy...
This video confirms to the entire tech industry that iphone is the best phone in the world today. the two biggest judges have spoken.
10k dislikes?
Wow apple just paid for every single items in this video… including these two tech geniuses…
🤦‍♂️
Great video
Arun : you use multitasking? Mkbh dude : no i never use Arun : -oh sh-t its not cool?- Yeah me neither
I was always a Samsung guy before until 2021 Android (google) got greedy and got rid of Google music and force you to use YouTube music and no more ability to purchase individual songs, you must stream. Even with T-Mobile Magenta Max, in the subway tunnels of MTA, I don’t get signal. Apple still has offline music and purchase individual songs For offline music , I still need internet with YouTube music Also, Apple tends to remind me like to set my alarm, Android didn’t do that And I do agree with the battery, apple battery was better than my Samsung  Movies and for the one game I play (NBA Jam) both are the same to me I just hate Apple IPhone shut off, 2 buttons to turn off your phone 😡
For me android is better because it's cheaper and good. Like in poco phones 250 bucks will be absolutely godly if you compare the price to a thousand dollar iphone. Also there is more android than apple in the market. I haven't seen an apple store myself actually. All I've been seeing is androids.
I like how non restrictive Samsung software is, if you are an idiot of course you can fuck up your phone with viruses. But things like apk mody for free subscriptions is enough for me to get an android
Am I the only one that thinks that a few months ago Mrwhosetheboss just started to just say that Iphone is better??? its like he is getting paid now by Apple. For me is strange that he get the title of "best tech channel" and he started to use iphone... defend iphone. Is this debate how can he say that on the things you can use.. iphone is better because has some app that everybody use. What about just use any usb thing i want with my android? all the customization, and millions of things. And I think is soooo oriented the video to say Iphone is better.. just sayings the things apple user want to hear..
Oooooo the sexual tension between these two 💕
I disagree on some of the features that were mentioned including the photography and its video shoot especially on the S22 ultra with it's 108mp with 100x zoom camera however the iphone photography struggles so it doesn't come close and why is MKBHD scoring don't you have a say on this Aaron??
While watching this I get a google pixel add the a iPhone 13 ad
This is ACTUALLY not a good comparison video at all.
I suppose you could have done with marques' hand in the thumbnail
you are asking the question and his answering it.. it's his opinion this video is one-sided...
How much did apple payed you guys to make this video.. and this is coming from an apple user for over 5 years😂
Despite the comparison its all personal preference tbh , after using both android is the way for me
I use multi screen, if you take notes and do many other things a great feature from samsung which very few people use it
I think u guys were more biased towards iPhone, and Arun u agreed to everything MKBHD says, i m not saying iPhone is not good, its a great phone but there is a reason that there r more Android users than iPhone. I guess its a choice for everyone u can't compare two different ecosystems.
I would kinda like to see this happen like in every 1-2 years and see how one another's take changes or retains on both softwares
Cheap peoples buy Android kick the iphone Because i dont have money happy with Android customised Okay basically this video is also sponsored by apple maybe
Iphone doesnt make screens u 🤡🤡🤡
Next time collab with a technical influencer like @SomeGadgetGuy to give us a more in-depth, unbiased comparison.
I owned an iPhone for about 2 year's,  was the worst 2 year's of my existence.
Android
Only idiots buy iphone 🤣
Two gays met together 🤣🤣🤣
bro i've seen you in many videos saying that there is no airdrop on Android. THERE IS!!!! BASICALLY THERE ARE 2 "QUICK SHARE" "NEARBY SHARE"
When you are going into a topic in two seconds you are talking about not relevant things
My two favorite tech reviewers in single frame❤
Giving the eco point to iphone is straight up insultingly wrong
I had a hard time taking it seriously when they gave the Display a tie. Android should have won it outright. It was a tie because they threw in trashy phones most people wouldn't consider
This video is brought to you by Apple, be basic like the rest of us 👍
This has to be the geekiest video on the internet 😅... I love it 👍
Very simple, which phones do they carry everyday then it is the indication.  Questions are too general and some of them are a bit lame.
The bias bruh
I use multi window a lot. Once start using it there is no going back. Like learning something from a YouTube video and take note of those at a same time that's so attractive. These Americans are obsessed with IPhone.
I think this is biased
if only huawei got the fair chance of competing, iPhone would be hammered..
I agree with your scoring...however, after years of switching from iPhone to Samsung and back...I realized I need both. Iphone: - low latency audio + 3D touch (xs max) for some very specific music making applications - better video editing apps Samsung: - s22 ultra pen - more open, easy instalation of 3rd party apps - camera zoom + night shooting
Why are you guys comparing Android am Operating System to iPhone a Hardware device..  Are you guys techies at all? If you want to compare phones choose one Android Maker device and compare it iPhone and stop sounding stupid AF by grouping the all android manufacturers WTF..
I think iphone uses the ram much more effectively. So it don’t need 12 like Android…. But I guess all this is preference. I’m so deep in the apple wall of garden that it takes a searchparty to try to find me from there….😅
Bro this was such an amazing video
When two legends talk, everybody listen 👂
I use custom roms and root and the experience iPhone could NEVER 🥱
two iphone fanboys discuss a trivial matter that can just best be solved by saying, whatever phone you like is the better phone.
Battery:- The faster it charges, the faster it will discharge.
ANDROID USERS UNSUBSCRIBE THIS CHANNEL 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
2 apple fun boy .............. :D :D :D about phones
Android Vs Iphone is pretty much a stupid debate, one is an OS and other is a phone. Better topic would have been Android Vs IOS or Best Android phone (i guess S22 Ultra) Vs Best IOS phone Iphone 13 Pro Max and the scores wouldn't be that one sided because the the topic covers a large spectrum of things and is really vague. Also stuff like Imessage, airdrop, things like these are for people who locked into that Apple ecosystem, the whole video at the end of the day was like, how good is an Android phone or an Iphone is good for that Apple ecosystem but it was entertaining to watch, i commented this much because now there will be people who pretty much shit on Android Os and Android phones and Ecosystem like Samsung's and Google's and the likes by using these video as an argument to conclude how bad the Android side is compared to the IOS side.
Right there marquis hit the nail on the head. When I see something I need to quickly take a picture of, I whip out my Note and I'm completely disappointed by how long it takes for the camera to fire up and how many times I have to tap the shutter button before it actually takes the picture. That completely drives me up the wall. The only reason why I haven't switched back to iPhone is the lack of finger print scanner.  If iPhone 14 doesn't have a finger print scanner, I'm buying a new Motorola flip phone for nostalgic fun.
and I feel mk is the only one giving options
Your reviews are biased and misleading there is no way that iPhone is better than android period.
You guys are F*** biased.. How can you give Samsung screen and iPhone screen a tie..  WTF
Can we get Linus in here? Lol
Android is better.
it just makes no sense I'm sorry
So many idiots in one place or so many cheaters? The 2.11T dollar company need people like you.
Totally bias and one sided this video.  Obviously 2 youtubers wanting to milk cash in this lull period from the controversy.  Such a shame.
Marques seemed very held back and shy, 🤔 maybe uncomfortable too?
I don't agree sorry but great content
9:50 Remember how you cannot salvage parts from other damaged iphones to repair your iPhone? It's unfair to say that iPhone is more eco concious.
Great vid, loved it, thanks!  Esp inclusion of MKBHD. I do think you should have made the subjective ones like photography 0.5 each and wonder what that would do to the result...? Also, I am someone who just doesn't like the iPhone UI - never have unfortunately as I can see they are great phones. Lastly, I would not get any use from air drop, face time, etc and really like the customisation of Android so am happy with my choice - but I do realise it's a compromise as many things are in life!
Please please please do more of these videos, with Lew too, like the one in Vegas
As an android user, ios has the advantage music apps wise and latency wise. Ios seems to have the edge apps wise. But android is nice with just drag and drop apks, i feel more free on android if that makes sense. But id give the point to ios sadly.
Fake reviews
What good does fast charging do if you don't have a socket arround to plug in?
It makes no sense that the S22 isn’t winning the screen category
5 years ago, no one would have thought Apple would ever win a battery war. Apple is just amazing!
I'm always on Multi window to be honest. like 80% of the time when using my phone it's during multi window
Aron made better points especially with the screen android screen is way better and camera and customization are also better on android
Like dude a Samsung flagship camera is way better, there's no way the camera feature would have been a draw if Arun made this video alone..
Scoreboard is pretty lopsided is because marq is on the Android end  I definitely feel like if Arun was on Android end it would have been difficult
Personally I don't like iphones since I have a history of them breaking on me for no reason and not ever getting even a partial refund so in my opinion I'd have to go with android
Android I believe 100%
I'm with both Android and IOS. Display : Are you kidding? LCD? 60Hz? iPhones, which era are you? Performance : Bugs? Crashes? Annoying? That happen in both the systems? You just have many phones over one phone bugs to mention. Features? Try using Xiaomi floating window. Battery : you need great battery and great charging, not the great battery mediocre charging. Who said Android has mediocre battery? Infact iPhones had bad battery until now and they have become better only at higher priced phones. Photography : Instagram/Snapchat? Samsung takes better than iPhone there too right? Too much versatility and experience. Hey, come-on man, counting the single bug from a single Android phone now? where is the features mentioning in photography section? Videography : No arguments there. Where are you sleeping Android? Does cost only make it better even if they rock same processor?  Eco-conciousness : Just where do you get those charts like Android takes 2040 to make eco friendly? Software reliability : Depends Software features : Lock screen widgets? Android has infinite themes that you can customise without booting. So many (massive pillar) features for iphone you told are already working the best in Android world, you just never used them.  Software support : No comments, just what are the Android competitors are doing? Pricing : Just buttering again for iPhones? MKBHD - are you even listening to arun? arun just spoke about 250$ phone and you talk about 400-500$ phone as way lesser phones present?
Most important thing Android have is Adblock without root jb and YouTube Venced so iPhone is no go
Feels like this is a paid video by Apple. iPhones photos are not very natural and I just don't get how they can be so good. What about you connect an iphone to a windows PC and it's just a nightmare
The problem of reviews is that pretty much ALL bloggers/designers/etc use Apple devices. So result obvious all the time. Ask Canon-only photographer to make review Canon vs Nikon... Or ask BMW fan to make comparison between BMW and anything else. Ask football fan to make comparisons between team he love and other team. Hope you get the idea.
Don't you think this video was very biased towards IPhone. Marques is only taking those situation where android lags behind and giving the win to the iPhone.
2 apple fanboys
if Lucifer was a tech reviewer
hello beautiful intro it was a good idea to apply on my next video .
Arun singlehandedly rebuilding international relations. Great to see the camaraderie and discussion over an interesting topic. Also interesting to see that neither of you use split screen. It's like it's a feature to try and make things more convenient but is just too much of a faff and even on the bigger screens (mine is 6.9") where you'd think it'd be most useful and usable it's still too small and annoying to use. Much easier to just switch between apps as Arun said.
Android-iPhone comparisons always feel like Star Wars references. Like the Rebellion and the Empire
File management is one of the key elements that's kept me an Android user since my Galaxy S2. My home computers are all Apple Mac/Mac book Pro and ipad but every time I try and live with an iPhone (I have a 7Plus for music production) as a daily driver, I last about 2 days! 😄 PS: Dex rules. 😁
android 13 compare to ios 16
yea right 🤣🤣🤣 android way beter.
About  the battery, for me personally, as phone gets older, android battery performed better than that of an iphone.
They're using preferences and opinions to determine which is better. That's not fair to both devices
This is the first time for me to dislike a video
Sponcered by iPhone
Very nice questions and wellsaid answers .. 👍
They were both recently present in apple conference so how can they let android win I think samsung definitely win in many aspect like performance camera software battery and lets not forget that Samsung is king of display they both favour apple tooo much!
Great video, but I was missing one category which is innovation. There Android clearly wins with pen support for a long time, folding screens, DEX, etc...
Among us memes are fuck
Asus ROG all the way
The really odd thing is I have an s20+ and an 13 pro Max and the charging speeds and battery life are completely odd. The charging brick on both are 25Ws and yet the iPhone takes 2.5-3 hours to charge to full from almost dead while the Samsung takes 1-1.5 hours to charge to full. The battery on the s20+ is actually larger by a bit and is using the old 120hz screen type that doesn't support variable refresh. The battery life of the iPhone is about double the 2 year old Samsung's though. This is a really odd result from my point of view.
The title of the video should be S22 Ultra vs Iphone 13 Pro Max. This ain't OS comparison!
Just a quick fact on eco consciousness!   Here in New Zealand,  I ordered a s21 ultra and charger from the official samsung website & both came in a bigger box 📦 which was almost half the size of a nike shoe box & stuffed with buddle wrap!   Same thing happened when my friend ordered the latest s22 and a charger! Was really disappointed to see that.
expected Apple commercial, from this 2, got one, starting from the screen,  my good do you use eyes ....
The fact you have to use so many different phones from Android to compare with the iPhone, tells you all you need to know.
I think a "conclusive" opinion is:   APPLE is better for a regular user who isn't focused on one particular aspect of the phone or needs anything specific. Specially useful to users who are already in the Apple ecosystem.   ANDROID is better for users who need something in particular, whether that be ultra fast charging, high performance gaming, high zoom or PC compatibility. Specially useful for niche users of many topics.
Shouldn’t this be iOS vs android? iPhone vs android arent really comparable with iPhone being one single phone and android being an operating system. You’re comparing iPhone to 50 different phones of course one of those many phones might do one single thing better
Android is really flexible in terms of practical day-to-day usage than iOS. I find iOS really boring. iOS is good enough for facetime, imessage etc, on the other hand, Android offer Desktop experience, VR capabilities, Fast Charging, Expandable Storage, Universal USB-C port, More RAM, Easy to manage music, media data, documents etc, budget friendly and so much more
So this a video on preference rather than facts. Kinda boring video from what we usually get from Arun.
The reason we like android isn't in this video. The reason we like android is that it's more open source, it's customizeable, don't like the OS? Change it, don't want to pay to some premium product? Crack it, as shady as it sounds. I like it not being tied to ecosystems
I have both.. android for business and iPhone for personal use..
I don't use a flagship so these comparisons doesn't matter to me.
Great Content
iPhone heating issue on editing on third party apps like TikTok,instagram,Facebook ruined my experience overall.
after been user fo apple for more than 7 years and i go android i will never buy apple again,  apple is use user friendly software but shade practices of apple  like battery throttling and now they do every 2 years software update to force sell your old phone buy new one is pretty dodgy.
someone really like iphone for sure.... lol
I will never buy an iPhone just because of their sht non self repairability policies.
wow, who would have thought that would win in a comparison of optimization ? apple (with a couple of dozen phones) vs android (with literal hundreds of variations) ? yeah ... "fair comparison", totally not biased towards Marquez...
Wow, it must be quiet season on the tech front.
Android has alot of good features than Apple
12:56 Schon Mal was von Nerby Share gehört?
It's a draw for me fam. It comes down to whether I can afford Apple flagships or not. Don't care about the SE stuff.
Display is a tie?? Really?? You tried way too hard to please Apple!
Android is an OS not a phone.. get your facts right in the title
I feel like customization has been completely left out. The level of customization that can be done on an Android is just too much. At the very least, Android should have gotten full marks just for having the ability to install apps from 3rd party app stores without rooting/jailbreaking.
At the end of the day, it all boils down to personal preference. That said, it really is going to feel to the majority of viewers that this was heavily opinionated. A lot of people couldn't care less about iMessage or FaceTime. That in of itself kills a lot of the argument for an iPhone.   Not to mention you forgot to factor in the fact that inasmuch as iOS has long term support, android apps have longer support. Because of the way android works, even after a phone has lost major updates, Google apps such as the Google phone app for instance are constantly rolling in with updates to improve usability of the device.
For me as an iPhone and iPad user who also is a family sysadmin for both iOS and Android (50/50), Windows mostly for family and Linux mainly for me, I would give 50/50 to iOS/Android because there’s relative feature parity. I often find that the user of one system don’t know or even care about what the user of the other system rave about. I find that both systems give what their users chose them for, and I know there’s a big one now of the USB-C charging.   The issue with that is the fact that most of that inconvenience of using multiple cables bothers frequent travelers 🧳, most people are not frequent travelers and when they travel, they carry so many bags that also packing an extra cable of about a 1.5 m and few grams of weight is trivial. So some things are not as big as people make it out to be, and the Android users who look at the iPhone and say it’s still stuck on lightning overlooks the fact that the first iPhone to move to USB-C charging will cause a lot of pain and confusion as it will suddenly be not compatible with a lot of accessories/audio gear people have. Buyers of iPad Air and iPads pro line are quite fewer than budget iPad buyers and only iPhone owners who are still on only Lightning.
Comes to personal preference
Comparing samsung display vs iphone and same ? Wtf
I thought Zelenski is reviewing an iphone
The informal ending. Love it!
The more you watch it, the gayer it becomes.
What about S20+ Green horizontal line on display!
It's a shame... How you could release a video full of lies but at the same time say that you are impartial... The s22 ultra is already not the best Android, had to compare it to Xiaomi 12 ultra, and the battery, the performance, the screen, everything is much better on the Xiaomi except the battery on par. And not the ram at Android is used for games but also p For apps to stay open for a long time, Android is best made to be free, it uses audiophile codecs, you can install apks. And Android is more convenient than ios overall But here it depends on the overlays. In short, the real note should have been reversed. Because I tested iPhones, I would never even take them with my MacBook pro m1. It is especially mkbhd which gave points At Apple, if mrwhosetheboss really had the freedom, he would surely have rated the same as me. He also prefers Android.
This interview was supposed to be between a die-hard Samsung fan and iPhone. The comparison doesn't seem fair because before it got started, we already know you are both an Iphone fan...This is just a planned work against Samsung...Get yourself a Samsung addicted user and both of you should face him....This is just a trash
In charging there's an android who has 10000mah and for fast charging there's Xiaomi and for Camera Samsung and Google is there to take the lead and in every aspect, i dare any of you to an argument ☺️. Not a fight just talk about it...
I love how I can just connect, transfer and play / open anything on my Android phone with zero restrictions no software bs.
thank god i use android if the app keeps stopping without telling me ill think i exited it myself
And in the end both have a personal iphone :)
most Techy guys use Android.  android is for everyone. while iPhone is for specific types of people
There are people with 5 x your subs. Yet your videos are 5 x better!
I just buy an older Samsung Note under 500€, S-pen is best feature and I love the ability to draw anywhere.
I liked the video but honestly I think is not exactly fair for Android as are Marquez personal opinion giving scores to each category. Probably iOS would win anyway but not by that much.
You Look already much healthier! Tbh you were the inspiration to Go for a Healthier lifestyle by myself! Greetings From Germany💪🏻
Android any day
Super mad about iPhone getting the battery point
Mrwhoistheboss still wearing half panties….wow, it shows how he became mature on the outside but remained immature on the inside 😅
I think there are several points that should had gone to android like photography and display. And battery life and charging speed should be seprate categories where android will get an easy win in charging while iphone in battery. Also in terms of software features android has substitute apps for imessage and facetime while features on android have no substitute on iphones.
1:17 he is A9
This is weird. I thought it was about android vs ios, but they did Android phone vs iphone.
I totally agree with the subjective / objective thing. It totally depends on the choice of the user nowadays. Android and iPhone both have their pros and cons so in the end, it all comes to personal preference 🤔🙌
I think the reason this seems so unbalanced is because of the set size used. To compare a very small number of iPhones to a wide gamut of Android options is in itself not a fair comparison. There are actually a lot of android phones with very good battery baseline and faster charging, a combo which should make them better in the battery department. And then there is the question of ergonomics and usability. The flat side iPhones look aesthetically pleasing but they are heavy because of the steel (240g) on the IPhone 13 pro max. That combined with the flat sides makes it not that easy to hold.
Mas se MBKHD é um usuário do ISO como ele irá dizer que Android é melhor? Nunca, simples. É lógico que ele sabe mais de ISO do que Android. Para aqueles que estiverem mais atentos na entrevista podes ver que houve situações em que  MrWhosetheBoss não concordou 100%, mas ele seguiu em frente, ou seja, não houve uma resposta convincente. Eu usaria iPhone Só se for para fazer algumas fotos ou vídeos para redes sociais, mais nada. Algumas fotos, porque temos alguns Android que tem uma alta qualidade de fotos como Samsung, píxel, Vivo  Huawei p50.  Claro que é preferível ter um sistema aberto do que fechado, mas isso é de preferência de cada um, porém android oferece muito mais opção,e claro nem sempre mais significa melhor, longe disso, mas tens na mão a opção de escolher qual é melhor para si. No android encontro app grátis que no iPhone só é comprado. Isso por vezes é incomodativo, visto isso de forma global, penso que os americanos não tem problemas em pagar toda merda que tiver no Apple store. Mas mesmo assim é um pouco incomodativo e desconforto em certo ponto de encontrar muitas coisas pagas e poucos recursos grátis. Um iPhone é caro, deveria ter mais coisas grátis ao dispor do consumidor final. No android encontras variedades de app grátis e outras pagas, mas sempre encontras bons recursos grátis para instalar. Android ainda tem coisas que precisam melhorar,as por ser um sistema aberto, em que cada marca tem as suas ferramentas para modifica o sistema do seu jeito, nem sempre o android fica otimizado e fluido como é no ISO. Samsung poderia ser mais otimizado se não modificasse tantas coisas. Penso que agora que a Google está apostando forte no mercado de smartphones, no futuro não muito distante eles possam colocar Android no outro nível, principalmente para os píxel's que são deles. A Google pode vir a melhorar muito o android nos seus smartphones, mas para isso eles devem desenvolver os seus processadores ou ir novamente para snapdragon. Esse tensor tem exynos atrás dele. A Google deve desenvolver o seu processador próprio sem ir para Samsung. No que eu reparei até agora não minha volta Apple é mais famoso nos EUA. No resto do Mundo, as pessoas compram só para "status", uma ideia que ficaram na mente🤣. Eu nunca gostei do iPhone por seu custo e por ser um sistema fechado, digo é um excelente smartphone,as ultimamente Android deu um grande pulo também, principalmente mas qualidades das câmaras fotográficas. Só do tédio de instalar iTunes para poder enviar música no iPad foi chato, enquanto que no MP4 era só inserir o cabo e passar músicas s precisar de instalar programas 🤣🤌🏼. Para um consumidor americano que já está enraizado com Apple é normal e que adora, mas para o resto do pessoal nem sempre ficou confortável e amável com isso.
I think this whole comparison is biased towards the iPhone. Android is an os and not a phone. Should've been iPhone Vs another phone, say Samsung or pixel.
i wish i could tell u the reason why android should have gotten more points .
I've read a statistics a while ago that Android Apps on average run more stable and are ever so slightly less likely to crash.   I also think that eco friendly should never be given to iPhone. The phones are impossible to repair, parts are software locked, the lack of industry standards like USB-C. No way iPhone wins this topic.   Consistency: What I really don't like about iOS is that if I want to change some settings of the camera, I cannot do it in the camera app, I need to leave the app, go to settings, make the change and then go back to the camera app. This is something that really annoys me a lot. This also applies to other iOS apps that can only be adjusted in iOS own settings app. This inconsistency does not exist in Android.
I thought u guys were genuine tech reviewers but this video proved i was wrong. Thank you for the double standard game.
This was a bit biased in my opinion
Probably my least favourite video of mrwhosetheboss .... Totally biased.... 🥲
Main reason I wont buy an iphone. Not the price. Not the Software. It is USB-C. Fast data transfer, unlimited accessories, fast charging and having one cable for all of that is a feature I dont want to give up.
6GB ram in a iphone is better than 18GB ram in a Android smartphone
Great concept but terrible execution. Not throughly researched, full of fallacies, and disregard for many feature equivalents.   The baseline kept moving, sometimes comparing to leading flagships and sometimes comparing to cheap or lesser known phones.
that's disappointing. Samsung lost.
Sideload Compatibility & connectivity with other devices Affordability  Availability
For me my s22 ultra is quite good than 13pro🤣🤣🤣🤣
It was more like " Samsung vs Apple " than the android vs ios. 😑
I think you two are the best 👏🏽
Software availability is the largest weak point for iPhones. Games are hardly ever available for early access, and solutions like TapTap have server issues such as connecting you to a server halfway across the globe. They should take a leaf out of ChromeOS's book and allow sideloading. Pretty much all the apps I use on my Chromebook are sideloaded using Linux.
Plz gift me a iPhone 13 pro
How to tell me that you are doing an ad for Apple without telling me you are doing an ad for Apple.
Arun: Talking like a calm professional..... His Pants: imma just gonna cut ourselves in half
Arun, I really don't want to dislike your video but I am going to   Its as biased as any can be   Not because of you but because of MKBHD  And I am an iPhone user
I know this is off topic to the video but I noticed your update on your progress and got to say your doing great and keep at it. Also happy pride month.
Another dope Collabo🔥🔥💯
An american picks an iPhone....Considering it is the dominant phone in the US market, what a shock!!! 🙄
Why it feels like MKBHD is more biased to Apple for some reason. Like he talks about smoothness of display, camera of I phone. It doesn't sounds like he is neutral anymore!
Love this video 😍😍😍
Big fan of the vibes of this video. The cosy setup, the very few "Whizz bang"  animations etc., and the slightly less intense style was great to sit and watch on a Friday evening. Nice work!
Love thos 2 guys, the true tycoons of tech. Arun,nice to see you all casual
actually unfair comparison for apple.

Android hardware break so fast android is good if u change models often
Hi Mrwhosetheboss (Aaron), I am a huge fan of your tech channel and I have learned a lot from your content. I just wanted to say that I think you just go into public asking people android or IPhone and ask them why, since I have noticed this has been a very long battle that has been going on and maybe getting the publics opinion could help, like I am an iPhone user because a lot of people surrounding me in school, public etc, have iPhones/apple products and the airdrop feature is kind of handy for that.
Open File system, download/upload stuff from/to websites or cloud like MEGA, torrent.  Android can instantly become a no brainer depending on the user requirements.
No need to watch the vid if you ever saw a Mrwhostheboss comparison before ^^V  Sorry I love your videos but with stuff like this you do everything you can to make iPhones look better then they are.  You get completely locked into a way to expensive eco system, there are actually lots of weird bugs all the time (sadly my company got iPhones and as IT-Support I need to support those but damn we get crys for help on a weekly basis and with lots of weird stuff happening, especially after updating those things often don't want to turn on again or have apps, even system apps, not working anymore)  Also stupid prorietary connectors (yeah nice when they recycle a lot but then make you buy those crappy extra cables and extra componnents all the time)  Did I mention how rediculously overpriced those iPhones are ?  Also even though people still say iPhones are easier to use many people don't even know how to write special letters and have to ask all the time as its not that simple on iphones. Sideloading is still not a thing if I am not mistaken ? well except if you jailbreak but that will destroy a lot of other stuff again if its the same as it was back when I had one of those phones ^^V
‎‎ Title should be "Top 10 reasons why we're certified Apple shills" 🤡 ‎‎
Sorry but I'll still select an android phone over an i-phone any day. I did enjoy it though :)
Absolutley loved seeing Marques and Mr Who’s the boss together🔥🔥
Apple is always slightly slow to release features because they take more time to meticulously design and improve a feature and make sure it’s basically perfect before releasing it rather than android which just quickly and badly make features and throw them into the OS.
20:07  that's a perfect shake right there  seamless contact, crisp sound, firm grip, 0% cringe beautiful !
😭😭😭😭😖 android looses the game
2 Goats🐐
I think price and value should be separate. With apple you get what you pay for. I’ve had apple devices running for 5 years that still work flawlessly. Androids last two years and start behaving terribly.
Android is pushing iPhone to add more features and options. So literally iPhone improvement is based on its competitor Android every year. Edit: Notable. Because of Android, apple have been forced to introduce iPhone in budget segments.
These are usually clickbait videos.  In the end they’re going to say “the best depends on what you like” or something similar.  I don’t even have to watch the video to know the answer.
Never used a iPhone 😉 From symbian to Android...
I have xiaomi phone with 120w charger and 5000ma battery and this phone last all day and before I use to put my phone on the charger when I go to sleep until the morning but now I leave it on 15% and I go to sleep and when I wake up I plug it in and it need 15min to fill 100% of the battery just when I finish brushing my teeth and using bathroom. So it change how I use the phone.
Please talk about how android is better for developing, modding and other type of stuffs. Including the store and others
Tbh MKBHD is a apple fan boy
Hello moto🤓
Android vs iPhone eh? 🙃 Windows vs Mac Book next?  Linux vs Microsoft Surface?  WebOS vs Sony TV?
I can say that this is bias😂 samsung isnt that bad??
Boss Arun
Ok I've watched MKBHD enough to say he sucks iPhone d#*@$
When you have 80% iPhonic subscribers on your YouTube channel 😁and you probably won't disappoint them!
iphone wins but its a personal choice 😂
2 Iphone lovers LOL
Personally if you want a nice pic and really care about pix.. Go buy a decent camera... Cameras in mobiles will always be limited... Mobile cams are for fun only
The iPhone continues to be the best. In 2007, the first-generation iPhone marked the beginning of the smartphone era. Consider how Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Nokia, and the rest of the Android phones looked back then. The iPhone, on the other hand, completely transformed the game. Today's competition is fierce. There are a lot of great materials and innovations coming out, thanks to Apple for paving the way. Apple is the smartphone equivalent of Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, BMW, and so on. People will buy it regardless of how expensive it is, just as they do with luxury cars. On the other hand, Samsung and all of the android phones are like compact cars (please don't get mad 🤭) like Honda and Toyota; make all the modifications you want, but hey, at the end of the day, it's still Apple. The elegance, style, operating and support system, the fluidity and smoothness, processors, hardware and software integration, and many more. You will love Apple just the way it is.  The iPhone is the forefather of all smartphones.
It feels like two apple fan boys talking which phone is better android or apple?😂💪🏻
iPhone is like the movie 300….
Samsung has quick share, its kind of like air drop
i really want to cuss out iphone simps but im not gonna go there
I'll go with Samsung/Android..gives just about everything at an affordable budget & is waaay more flexible than the half eaten apple's iPhone..
iPhone uses Samsung displays.
Winner iPhone Sentiment and Heart for Android!! Proud owner of android since forever!!! No matter Android looses for next 1000 years still I will buy an android.
Apple is definitely NOT more eco friendly because of how hard they make it to repair an iPhone, and the fact that they tell customers to buy a new phone instead of fixing it.
Mr Who Is Quiet and has no opinion....
So is the iphone better??
Apple has a long way to go but still wins. but the comparison is more like a preference battle.
Great video there. I like the fact that Arun didn't let his user experience determine the scoring. I always feel that with most reviewers.  Users  an always rely on objective (or seemingly objective) content. Wishing all reviewers would take a leaf or two.
Dual Apps, Dual Sim, Multitasking, million apps that work on android, picture in picture while i use office calls, i can take a video call and slide down the window while i can actually use the phone, full display with almost invisible bezel, repairable, most of my office apps are connected to g world and Android is super useful. I can talk about it all day. And options to choose design based on one OS.
Just to add to the “software” section of comparison.  multimedia production tools from 3rd parties - i mean music production, video production apps - are something that iPhones had forever and actually reached the point when you quite effortlessly can produce these types of multimedia pieces - whether it’s a full-scale short film in 4K or an EP/LP music release - using iOS only as an environment for the post-production stage - meaning videoediting, special fx / mixing, mastering, etc - without compromising the actual quality of the end result.  That’s something that Android seem to catch up for the last few years, but no doubt there’s a huge gap in quantity and quality of the solutions for that purposes on Android devices.  It’s just to add to the basic factory “lineup” that was mentioned in the video - facetime, airdrop, etc
Mkbhd biased
We all know MKBHD loves his iPhones and never gives Samsung a chance.. I for one, I've been an iPhone user forever but since the I've got the S21 Ultra and now the S22 Ultra, I won't be going back to Apple again..
Someone talked about using usb-c on everything... Coming to know that mixing chargers in devices that have diffrent capacities of charging... I think apple is making a good point on making their phones charge on diffrent chargers... I think anyone can take a blow of their laptop battery dying... But their PHONE.!! That is just not good
Idk why but i felt mkbhd was really biased in iphone side
So fucking biased
I need an app to repeat notifications if I didn't hear it, but ios won't let app running in background and many app that need running on the background doesn't work on ios like clipboard manager etc. I think that's why small ram still work on ios
Both little bias...? Iphone is good but make it such a ''clear winner" is kinda a joke...
2 best tech youtuber dating
Quick easter egg  if u can see the charge number of the S22 Ultra in 1:08,  i wont even tell just check it-
I really like to patch my apps to remove ads also add additional options or change current ones, some online apps i do put them to run offline by patching them there is a lot of uses when rooted... But yes very small percentage of people do that.. Also i am using a 150 euro phone hh i would call it environment and pocket friendly. Most of the world cannot afford these flagships. Anyway still have people dying out of hunger while people argue about phones and waste time and money ..
Am I a minority? 😲 Droids..! Assemble..!!!!
This guy is a die hard iPhone user and it affects his judgement. When it comes to display and battery, iPhone is not even close..
This is an MKBHD video featuring MrWhoseTheBoss
apple says they wanna be carbon neutral. but they actually don't give a fuck about the planet. they just want you to think they care. no company truly cares. they just want you to buy their product.
File managers are a huge must for me
People who has Samsungs because they can’t afford a iPhone say *SAMSUNG IS BETTTER LOL* like :/ bruh
Think the key thing to remember is, this is subjective. For me who likes both OSes, Android lets me do what I want, but the hardware is amazing on iPhone, both ecosystems work well within their own systems, Google has better services (web) but the general software experience is better on iOS.  But it's up to what people prefer, they both do your basic smart phone things, it's the UX that's different, or some just love to hate on the other, but both are great and stable.
if you are conscious. then no phone is the correct choice.
One of my favourite tech topics
Android has way more customisation which ios can never keep up with thats fact.
I mean it's mostly iPhone Vs flagship android phones and points on preferences. Also software quality of life features go both ways, there are things that I love on my galaxy, like individual volume sliders, ability to silence an alarm of I'm up early, to silence an alarm in advance for the next day but not forever. Secure folder also comes as an example. It just felt going in the iphone's direction a lot more, and that's from someone who has been considering a switch.
A dent for the dent? Nice touch!
How about apple slowing down the phone on purpose to force consumers to upgrade their phone???
I dont have a camera or an flagship level smartphone but whenever I thought of buying what’s come to my Mind is the Vivo Flagship thats it. 😎🤷‍♂️
What a pointless video. I use Apple and Android daily. And hands down, Android is superior. Apple is just so far behind.
Emulation tho lol
Know one can decide which phone should you buy you need to do some research and find what suit for you🤘
You should’ve just done Samsung vs Apple, it’s not really a test if you use other brands!
You should’ve just done Samsung vs Apple, it’s not really a test if you use other brands!
So confused! When is this going to end!? It all depends on the user.... For me its always android.
Premium comfort box- apple ecosystem Control freedom experimental lab- Android
iPhone : Java edition Android : Bedrock edition
If only mkbhd is doing this video then all points will go to the iPhone.
Sponsored by apple
Marquees is just way too biased. It's cringe worthy
Samsung did a dead wish by taking off micro SD! The only reason I use samsung because of that.
Mkbhd was apparently embarrassed by Android. To me personally, it feels like the fact that such an unbalanced rivalry still exists and being talked about back and forth in the year of 2022 is a joke! However, I am rooting for Android tho.
Once u start using an I phone then u understand the difference. It's grt
I found MKBHD more biased towards iPhone. He is giving every point to iPhone and things in which he things Android is better they give it a draw. It feels like a video on iPhone is better than Android. Like iPhone camera is better but when compare with ultra Android phone they are pretty much closer. And things get better with iterations. As in Android they have widgets right from the starting. Not judge on visuals they know how to get most out of them.
Android has the Fold Market on Lock. While Apple adds a camera, then takes it away, then add a camera again ect ect
2 people who use apple iPhones talking about iphone vs other phones. you should have called me lol
Best collab. Both are my fav YouTubers❤️👑 So the iPhone is the clear winner 🥇 here... 😃
The second Apple allows me to install 3rd party apps, and set my own god damn default apps, I'll gladly switch.
no matter what, marques is gonna pick iphone in every category. I Won't call someone like him a "Tech reviewer". He is just an average iphone lover.
This video is sponsored by the manzana mordida!!
so many points not discussed such as notifications, file management and more
I'm thinking of getting an iPhone to see the which would work well for me more. The current phone I have right now isn't as good as most android flagship devices. It's the A20S. I've had it for a year now and my experience wasn't mine boggling but it does what I want, but the phones very laggy and space gets taken up super fast even with tiny apps. I'm just hoping to get an iPhone soon so I can find out why everybody loves the phone so much as well as experience on my own.
Android put phones in the common man's hand. Led the digital payments revolution in emerging economies. Builds for most apps are extremely stable on Android.
Its like paid advertisment of apple. Can't agree with most of the decisions
MBKHD is just an Apple fanboy. I no longer watch his show because of the lack in impartiality.
Bro apple is stable I know but Android gives you more features
And then both of them will say S22 ultra is phone of the year
This comment will ratio mrwhosetheboss comment
Fun fact. I’m on an iPhone, and before this vid I got an ad about S22 ultra
It wasn't Android vs iPhone, it was Samsung vs iPhone
I would have said biased. But its based on your feelings right? Kikiki good video though
Why does the whole effort feel slightly done and overdone every time when a 'new' iPhone comes out and we need to be reminded yet again why iPhone tallies up higher !!
Mrwhothebosa is samsung fun😂
I prefer android than apple
all about optimization...even you had everything better but you can't optimize to use it fully then it will degraded or even useless
It's a good video, but I think you should refer to other companies like ViVo, or Xiaomi, or Oppo, not just Samsung, because as a Xiaomi user, I think Xiaomi performs better in most comparable scenarios
As always apple the clear winner!
Personally, I buy the phone that I like and enjoy using it. Instead of arguing my point to fanboys from both sides who will never change their views.
iPhone has the worst display and battery my $600 phone has better display and battery than any iPhone. You're just iPhone fan boys who have no idea about mobile gaming. This shows how big of a bots you are.
Everything was going fine then the eco thing just bored everything.
iphone 🐐❤️
This is bullshit. Totally biased review. Did you guys got paid by apple to do this?
I just personally don’t like IOS so to me android is better simply because I’m not a fan of IOS/IPadOS
High performance & Modifications are importance to me therefore,  Android because its open source & with certain computer Programs, I can gain full access  to the Android systems core, so I can over clocking the processor, upgrading/Downgrading Android versions,  uninstalling system apps, install custom ROMS, change the boot animation, hack/modify games & so much more, its basically like having a PC in your hands.
They keep on avoiding things that Android have that iPhone don't. For instance, storage and repairability.
So I wasn't tripping when I took a picture with my Pixel 6 Pro? I thought I was going crazy.
Nice to point out Vivo X Series. Cause his ability to take excellent photos and record videos is the next level in phone industry.
Android beats iPhones if you were to look and vital basics, like being able to charge a phone at any time with any charging cable out there. Sharing files seemlessly and accessibility when I have forgotten say the passwords of my account. IPhone is another pain in the b...tt!! And talking about the price, I don't have to borrow to get a phone, android is affordable at all levels.
I thought it was android vs IOS
mkbhd is useless reviewer now... he is trying to get apple every time.
Absolute rubbish. If you guys like the iPhone, just say so in words, don't have to make prejudiced videos. Very disappointing from icons like yourself.
Being a Software Engineer and Tech enthusiastic, I barely see people like me "Developers" who uses iPhones. Reason is simple, it doesn't allow us to play with it, set everything as we want, deep dive into the system and pick best possible settings for us.  And it comes to Camera, no doubt iPhone is best for who doesn't know how to take pictures and best for portraits pictures but when you want to control everything according to your taste then iPhones suck.
I haven't used Android, but one thing that I would consider in terms of software would be app support, is there a cutoff date like with Apple where Android apps can't be installed if you don't have the latest update? I remember a while ago I couldn't download some apps or app updates because I was still running an old version of iOS. Does Android have the same issue since there are a lot of phones that only get two Android updates?
Interesting video.  There are a few things no one talks about: Uighur slave labor in the Apple manufacturing chain, Apple works VERY hard against the customers right to repair by the owners own repair shop choice, Apple started the "No charger included" syndrome with a going green campaign but it really is just another money grab.  Apple won't let devs in the app store unless they pay (another reason there are fewer apps available for iPhones but their revenue is higher than Google play store).
Arun trying to be unbiased: Marques: "Android is actually really good, but I give that to iPhone because I like them"
GIANT NOTCH loses display, GAH
How much you 2 were paid by Apple?  Markas said apple matters for lot of people and Android for little people.. Really bro? Your eyes ears and even your brain are covered with apples money.   Android operating system hold an 87 percent share of the global market
This video didn't do justice with Android.
What about GCAM though?
Biased alert!!!
I'm still buying Android It gives me all apps Free. 😂
I pretty much agree with this, for most people I'd just say iPhone unless you mainly care about screen/photos, and, for me, tinkering and occasionally used little features and apps that I need as I like to make things. Camera I agree with you Arun, since I find the Samsung camera to be better with I'd say better photos and zoom but a bit of a lack of video quality, which is fine since I'd rather take nice photos, so yeah, on average iPhone, but depending on needs Android
As expected ..mkbhd as always biased towards apple 🤡.  If u want to compare both there are sooo many other factors ... Plus mkbhd is using an year old phone and tech channel really can influence in brain washing the audience mind 🤡🙏
try a specific brand of android vs iphone next time. Features on different android phones varies way too differently
13:51 yeah but who can download a game without paying, download music without subscription And has an app specifically designed like airdrop
I think you should do a tech battle on one side MKBHD getting stand with Android and on otherside you taking stand of Apple ( And Battle Starts )
Is it me as an American? I have known Apple phones forever. (for better or worse); but I have never touched half of the international androids avaliable. (Person who likes to have something unique.) What do I get to be powerful, unique, and stylish? In ur opinion lol
This was biased. The notch is a huge deal breaker. The closed eco system (think Fortnite and facetime), no finger print sensor...
btw they visited mark rober at crunch labs and mkbhd lost 10,000 dollars for mark rober
I prefer my freedom over security in phones i dont like it when my phone fights me plus tbh community support is why i like android that and emulation  in my sense is that if you know what you are doing on your phone then you are alright. iphone i feel like gets everything for people that just want a phone
Android has Sideloading which means : Roms Gcam mod emulators Alternate App stores Better software than iOS Freedom More apps
Android for me.
USB c in iPhone 14-15 and no notch and its perfekt
Apple’s fan bois
Galaxy s22 ultra has left youtube
It looks like 2 apple fans making gimmicks in a sponsored video😆
People are so salty over seeing a video where two people discuss THEIR opinions on phones based on THEIR preferences.
It's pathetic that our world revolves around only Apple & Samsung☹️ I hope there are better brands that will compete with them! Come out fast, Pi Phone!!!
iOS is always better period
I'm surprised they didn't talk about ecosystem. The only reason I'm am android user is because of this
iPhone gets locked up sometimes when you're using multiple apps simultaneously. Also, the car play is not quite good as an android in terms of voice quality. I am not a big fan of Samsung work place culture but I have to give them a benefit to give consumers what they want.  To me, face recognition is a huge security issue my friend girl friend unlock her boyfriend's iPhone by waving the phone on his face while sleeping. Not sure about the latest iPhone 13 but iPhone 12 the screen is way slower than the Samsung S22 ultra and Samsung seems a lot faster than iPhone. The screen of the Samsung seems to be much bigger. Currently using both iPhone12 Pro Max for personal use and Samsung S22 ultra as a work phone. Oh by the way Samsung camera picture is way better than iPhone. (for iPhone 13 model) I don't know.
I agree with all of these, but I'm still going to stick with android. I feel like like I'm in a box with an iPhone, like what I can do is limited. I don't have that same feeling on Android.
Great Video. Regardless, I'm an Android guy and will remain that way coz I want to be the owner of my phone, not a frkn Trillion dollar Corporate company...
Apple using recycled materials and stating carbon neutral goals is B.S. they are responsible for massive amounts of E-waste by so full heartedly opposing repair and resale. 😂🤣
Android
Starts video, pauses video, writes this comment:  Android. There. Now let me go watch something that won't fry my brain.
Battle my 2017 Moto Z2 Force I dare you, still looking for that iPhone 10 vs Moto Z2 Force. But I'll take on a iPhone 14 any day 😡 even if there is a 5 years difference. Clearly you haven't seen a Moto Z2 Force or it's sister phone, the Moto Z2 Play 😏
Dont get me wrong , Arun makes great videos... but the fact that hes doing this challenge with MKBHD, whos mostly an iPhone suporter just makes this video a bit biased. Tbh i personally felt like the draws deserved to be more on the side of Samsung's rather than points being shared with both. Anyways a very high quality and an informative video!
At the end of the day but what you want to buy! Like the iPhone and it’s features, buy it. Like Android and it features, buy it. It your money, your choice.
Iphone some how always wins
why TF I am even watching this
Apple always seemed like a company that was willing to completely screw over the customer to extract extra revenue from them through proprietary connectors, app store fees, astronomical accessory costs, Totalitarian control over accessories market through hardware IP.  I could just never volunteer for that.  The Battery on my S10+ has lasted more than 4 days in ultra battery saver mode when camping. That includes taking lots of pictures.  I have no reason to upgrade to a new phone until this thing dies because it is so good.
The title should be 'Arun with an isheep'
Iphone is lame ..android allday
It's nothing but cellphones dudes, its not your vital organs or something
Didn't expect such a foolish video from you guys. Disappointed!
U can have 2  Personal work:iphone13 pro Professional work:Samsung s22 ultra
You missed the one important comparison which is FILE SYSTEM! I'm using iPhone and love it except one thing which is File Manager and system. Files on iPhone is just a very bad. You cant just copy and paste to your phone from your PC to get the file on your device. All you need to do is import and export from iTunes which is very terridic and not suitable for all kinds of users.  In Android, you can copy paste the files and play them from the various player.  I know Apple claim that for the security but still they need to improve their file system!
You both can startup a tech company and take all the market share of Apple and Samsung.. just give us what is really best and let your profits be marginal .
How could marques say that iPhone has better design when he gave design of the year to S21 ultra ? seems hypocritic.
Hmmm. If the choice is vanilla or rum raisin,  I'm choosing rum raisin.
Am i the only one thinks that the *eco concious* category shouldn't exist because both os are bad at it
Android is actually better for me.
The display is old design on iphone
MKBHD is so biased towards iPhone its actually annoying
My name is MKBHD and i am a sheep
Is thw black guy an apple fanboy or a pay advertiser?
We Android users don't want that stupid lock screen customisation  because we have AOD from where we directly jump to home screen by underdisplay fingerprint scanner. 😎
This battle needs to be between Samsung, Google, and iphone
Great video,  but I will really loved to hear about data privacy and tracking on both platforms.
Amazing video. Nothing. I will change here 💯%
It is a clever way for advertising Iphone. Big thumbs down
The two most handsome tech tubers finally meet.
if the android phone was Red Magic 7 instead of s22 then there would be a different result
I'd rather watch a video or play games on a Samsung flagship screen... Battery already lasts a whole day and then some... Couldn't go back to a huge notch and thick ass vessels
My GOD...two apple sheeps discussing Android...😂😂😂
13 Pro doesn't have great battery if you are a productivity or a gaming user. Need to charge 2 times a day.
the title should have been "which is MKBHD's choice". not which is better. Im sorry i have never expected such a bias comparism from my fav reviewers in one video.. there's no need then to do an unboxing or review for other phones because they are basically useless then? even while sayin these things i always see whats on my phone video and its always android so i dont get this video. seems so bias. how can you water down all samsung's inovation and praise iphone when they copy it and improve on it. you forget that apple makes their hardware and software but android has to work on a wide range of devices. Zfold basically non existent until iphone makes one right..smh
Android is the better melee/range weapon, no one dares to use their overpriced iphone as a weapon.
You effectively had a 24 hour day? That’s innacurate, you only had an effective flight duration day in terms of battery consumption, the time difference between UK and US or wherever you are flying is totally irrelevant if you want to measure the battery life
Why is it Android v iPhone and not Android v IOS, I mean if you're gonna compare the two at least choose a brand that uses Android
Lmao 🤣 bruh this is so biased ... Why is it an actual phone vs a platform with hundreds of cheap/top tier options anyway? And everything iPhone does "Samsung" does and has several ways of doing it, 5 years earlier. I use apple ipad and m1 Mac but the phone aren't up to par sna stripped down.
Apple is stupid.. there.. done with the vid
Apple lost me when they decided I'm not allowed to join a chat room with adult content from my own iPhone. I'll stick with a phone that behaves like I actually own it thanks.
Android v iPhone, which is better? End your video on, "It's basically a personal choice". Great😂🤘
They are iphone Biased. They hate Samsung
MKBHD is slowly becoming an Iphone ambassador.
MKBHD is funny as
This video is brought to you by Apple, thanks for the sponsorship
Dope video fellas.
Thanks for using Genshin as a prime example # Genshin pog
Ha ha .... Globally numbers speaks - simple numbers 83% android vs 15 % iOS speaks lot on whatever which contradicts bias opinion  :) :)
Wow such a slanted biased review
Android problem is optimization 🥲
Now i confidently talk to my friends that who’s phone are best of best 📱❤️🤙
this video was sponsored by apple 😂😂
This is the worst video i have ever seen in your channel and clearly we can know that apple Gave money to them ....    But Arun i never expected that i am clearly disappointed I  a big fan,i love all the videos u have ever uploaded but...  I can't believe it I request to give an honest opinion.  And i am not a hater I am ur subscriber  Please give honest opinion  Well and ofcours it is sponsored by apple
Samsung will draw more performance when opening a game in game launcher, Samsung is trying to be efficient outside of the game launcher.
The Poco X4 Pro in 18:40 is crap
mate is a iphone fan boy cuz he American
Imessage facetime, etc all matter becuase Apple chooses to make them only on ios. to lock you into ios. Bruh
marques -basically likes the iphone, so regardless of performance, it wins . the bias in this video is clear
ISheeps
Only reason i like iPhone is it never lags
The majority of this points comes down to software.
I love the samsung s22 phone better
i missed those small timeline tiles which showed us what's coming next.
My man just simply ask for subscribe? Omg
android users still complaining 😂
Androids have features like Quick Share(Samsung) where  it's exactly like airdrop. I think that MKHD is leaving out a lot of factors in different areas here and in eco.
I go with android I don't care what anyone says android is the best phone ever
why does everyone have to pick one side? i have a 13 pro, pixel 6 and S22. Love ALL of them
One sided review .... american influenced :p
This just feels like watching someone try to get a PC player to say something nice about consoles.
Rooted os> android>>>ios obviously
Great to see you two together but damn the conclusions here were biased as fuk
Happy to see both of you guys sharing your opinions on this endless comparison. 😄 I guess the phone that's best....is what works for you not someone sitting next to you
Because of android smartphones reached in every corners of world otherwise if we only have apple then only upper class could afford smart phone’s…
Samsung is the best 👌
Guys, you missed the mark in so many areas with the comparison. This was so bias. Multile times you said Android was better in a area, then immediately tried to minimize the value of the feature. Ie. DEX. Come on guys you can do better
shouldve also compared to a redmagic 7 +
My two favorite youtubers on the same video just made my brain explode. I'd love to see another one with you both except the next time let MK take the trip 😂
I think the biggest advantage of Android is price. You can get 95% of features in 10% of price of an iPhone. Seriously, it has changed the world. 90% of World's population has benefited from the low price of Android phones. Android has helped to decrease digital divide, lift people out of poverty, made access to education easier etc. And yet, Apple fans and these Youtubers sitting away from all these problems will only care about Geekbench numbers.
14:00
All hail android, _*ck iphone!
I don't know why but this feels Bias
j
It is a grait information chanel
Them: Look Android has all these features, but... I like iPhone so point to iPhone.
YouTube shouldn't remove dislike buttom
Guys again, they were just discussion personal opinions. As they told in the end, it is totally personal and there is no single best phone out there. Just take the example of Marquez, he is using an S21 over S22 because he felt that is good. But still, he was the one who game major points to iPhone. Arun uses iPhone 13 Pro Max even though he likes a lot about android. So it totally comes down to what you can sacrifice to get to your sweet spot. It's time to stop the toxic wars.   S22 ultra was definitely good, but Marquez chose S21 because it is the best FOR HIM. That need not be the best FOR US.
So this a comparison of flagships. Most people don't use flagships.
This video is a joke. 😄
Iphone is just too expensive. I would switch to iphone in a heart beat if it was in the same price range of androids.
I only use Siri to try and find my phone, and half the time it won't pick up on my voice unless I'm only like 4 feet away from it
What ever android does or brings… end of the day iphone just feels great…ngl
To be honest  i have used both this phone, and  i like the samsung camera ,sometimes   iphone better,and the betry life i  give to iphone winner,talk about game some game not able to  run on ios very will,emulator is better on samsung
U guys expanded the way I think about both IOS and ANDROID
I am an android guy.  Had every note . But I have to say the iPhone community is far more usable. Samsung has made the same phone every year I found that I will only upgrade because of lack of updated software. I am not a photographer so pics of things on the street and my wife and kids all look good to me. So without a scumbag zoom what's different?
Booo
Bias video
This video is better than iPhone and Android.
honestly this is weird.... 😶😶..it feels robotic ...
In my opinion Although some android phone are better then iPhone, in the average iPhone is winner.
Iphone battery health setting is an advantage
TDLR: they are both good, this review is super boring and lack any kind of smart or unique opinion or understanding I come to expect from such huge YouTubers... I could have replaced the video with: "both cool, buy whatever you want"
For Gaming, Android is much better because you can play PS2 games and also some Switch games using Skyline.
Two tech beast side by side💝🔥
Classic. Oh yeah iPhone is way better. I mean, the screen isn't the best, neither is the camera, charging is hella slow,and lots of little iOS issues that don't work, features show up later, less customizable, but the iPhone is way better. Right, okay yeah, that makes sense. So M, you have access to any and every phone out there which iPhone do you use? M: oh, I use last year's Samsung 😳😜
android is better because i play games i downlead from the web and you can not do that on apple
this is the most bias vidoe i've seen in a long time
I had the feeling like I was in an alternate universe watching this video lol
This is nonsense comparison when you include MKBHD because he is too biased towards Apple, even some aspects where Samsung does good he will give it to MKBHD...
I love how Androids can't take an L. I read the comments and they try to come with arguments why this or that is wrong. Relax dudes, they are just phones, no need to beat your dog over it lmao.
MB is so biased towards the iPhone....US loyalty 🤔🤨🙄
We all already know the Nokia has every phone in existence beat 😂😔
Great video. A couple of thoughts I had...  Samsung has added a lot of features to replicate things like Airplay. My phone syncs and transfers files between phones, my TV, and my windows computer incredibly easily. The nice thing is that the file transfer between phones works over NFC and therefore isn't locked to a OS.  Also there are so many apps on Android I just can't replicate on Apple especially Tasker for Automation. I hear shortcuts is great but it just doesn't give me the connectivity to other systems that Tasker does, along with the ability to do massive changes to settings based solely on location (ie Lock down security when traveling through airports and other public transportation hubs)
It’s all fun and games until the android battery starts to degenerate and heat up like a volcano
MKBHD preferring Iphone ? What a surprise
Super interesting video on a very hot topic! Love the two perspectives but personally disagree on a few things. Photography for me has been flawless on Pixel and I have spent enough time using different Pixels (not the 6 yet) to be pretty aware of the cameras and have a fairly perfect experience. I know the "look" of the photo, the best angles, lighting and modes for the IMX363 and can confidently take it out and get my desired photo. The other spot was eco consciousness. The fair phone is definitely there for that but if you actually see each company's overall approach Google is much further on a much larger scale than any smartphone company. Google does have resources from a much larger backing since it is mainly an advertising/software company and not a smartphone company so they do have more backing. The things Google has invented for a greener world are often on a scale never seen before. Final thing is integration which Google has worked on quitely with ChromeOS and Android now having a lot of the features (nearby share any file, send/recieve messages, calls on Duo, etc.) that used to be IOS + MacOS exclusives. Difficult topics with each point having very good arguments from both sides. Great vid, cool to see the take that large creators have on this.
Imessage isn't a game changer for me nor is FaceTime air drop is nice but android has their own version its like they forget about it
The boring team is often the best one to watch... Hmmmm
My respect for mkbhd after this video  📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉
Lol so Android not won a single round so ...it means so many people using  Android are stupid...
I thought you taking a break and work on your health 😂😂😂😅
Love the collab, but the entire video and questions seemed to be skewed for iOS from the beginning.  Repairability? USB-C is HUGE plus for Android Curved screens? Built in Stylus? Company Labor Morality (phone production)? Samsung DEX was completely overlooked/undervalued.
Android. I wouldn't waste my time wit an iphone
Cool to see both dress up black vs white as well 😂❤️
To people talking about customization? How often do you really customize? Once in 6 months maybe. And who looks at your phone anyway? Just you.  But camera, battery, screen, software experience is what you USE day in, day out and not just look at. So the customization point is good, but it weighs very little.
I felt it was kind of paid video where both are praising apple only. Very disappointed with you Arun.
I love watching both of you this video was great
اضرط
hello
Not really a good comparison and im an iphone user lol
Android is better in many ways than.. iPhone.
Apple makes a quality product, but Samsung phones are better. Just look at the screen and photo mode. I've had both, but I like the customization of Android.  Apple is for girls and old people.
Lets  not tell apple and go spy on where how by whom they are made.. and Android...yeah that video is never coming.
Android is an advertisement gateway into your life.
Google Assistant blows Siri away, I never use Siri its a waste of time...
I think you should have added security as another key factor..
Thank you for this video, guys! It was so much fun watching you interact.
U should make a video on ur experience using an entry level Android like the very cheap ones.
I'm an Android user, but I really appreciate this very honest comparison.
The UK and the rest of the world use a variety of android phones. You will never a mkbhd Vivo or Xiomi video but Arun does those videos. Marques sounds like the typical American….everything apple. For instance, Marques mentioned Samsung dex not being important to a lot of people. That’s because So many Americans only use iPhones. If they gave that feature a try they would love it. Especially so many people working from home. Lock Screen widgets on an iPhone Andre not interactive. So many widgets on android allow my do things without opening the app. I can’t do what can be done with an android widget on my iPone widgets. I can’t place all my apps in mini folders. Every time I try to orgamy apps apple moves it somewhere else. I can keep going. This is not to take away from apple’s capabilities. I do use both but I will take my Samsung any day over my iPhone. It just does more of what I like including something’s I can’t mention here.
Not being bias but most of people buy iphone cuz it has a apple logo in it, its just a common stereotype that iphone > android in terms of exclusivity.
Personal opinion but I disagree with the recycle eco friendly point, as Iphones are always known to replace parts instead of fixing them. To put it into perspective Iphone uses 20% recyclable parts but if you can't fix or refurbish those parts & keep replacing them instead this all adds up to create more waste instead.
Absolutely hate iPhone, apple in general, after working for them, can't stand them  However, iPhones are good phones, if you need a very basic smartphone to use apps, watch videos, multimedia, etc it's perfect but that's all you get, android on the other hand let's you make a phone yours, full customization, changing a lot of settings, using different apps if you don't like how one works (ie text messaging using different apps, different keyboard, home launcher) which in my opinion makes it much better for someone that wants a very personal device
Mkbhd is quite weird. He says many contradicting things. For eg, he says iPhone for photos and when Arun asks if iPhone has best end product he says no. No wonder his camera comparison from past totally contradicted opinion from people. He is not that good like I thought him to be after all.
MKBHD, is just an iOS fan 🌻
isn t it unfair to take the flagships into consideration only under eco consciousness ? because marques compared the pixel with the iphone during photography...the problem he said with pixel doesn t happen on samsung...and also talking about  battery isn t it better when you have 8+ hour battery life and yet charges faster than apple?
Android always
Please send me this phone as a gift I shall be very thankful to you for this act of kindness
I think iphone is good but i always hate iphone because of lack of custom things which they added it now or did someone tries to replace face ID?.... Iphone is smooth... I dont really care about camera... I want phone which does not die quickly... Which is durable and if its not i want just cheap phone or phone which i Can repair for few €/$/£ ... Example iphone X screen (hard oled or soft idk really) costs me few years Ago just 55€ ... Galaxy note 10 plus costs something arround 300-420€ .... So if i Can preffer phone rn IT will be some xiaomi or oneplus... But my personal pick... S22/S22+/S22 ultra (i love one ui more than iOS, just my personal pick) Also Samsung just for buds pro or 2 because pros fits me perfectly ... This review is about personal pick. Dont blame them ... Iphone is great if your like iphone ... But i got like many Samsungs ... My first touch screen phone was Nokia C5 03 Green one
It all boils down to personal preference.
The title 'Android Phone Vs iPhone' would have been apt.
The Apple complex.
this video is sponsored by apple 😅
Iphone not helping....👎👎👎
Comments are gonna be wild on this one
Look at all these android users seething💀💀💀
How are we ignoring dat , iMessage and facetime are mostly used in d USA and Britain , the whole of the other world uses duo, watsapp . And how can we ignore d fact dat these iPhone exclusive feature don't work with Android.
A lot of iPhone hate in these comments but y’all know who the final stage big boss is (iPhone) 📱
Not sure why Marcus is less expressive or passive in the whole conversation. Do you guys feel competetive to even to share your views
I personally like android better because I like more customization, and the fact that you can show taps. I don't like how you can't show apps on ios.
The reasons I enjoy Android (Samsung) more: USB C port Volume mixer  Multiwindow APK downloads Don't have other Apple products that would be more compatible with an iPhone
I feel like all of these points are coming from more apple users I feel like android would have more points if a Linux user gave there opinion for a lot of reasons
I will like when Android wins
I've revised my comment almost 10 times in my head jeez, there's so much to say.  I personally think iOS and iPhones are amazing, and they've come a really long way from the original iPhone, fairly maintaining their nice aesthetics and great software experience, with major improvements. But the fact that the Android community is just so vast, Android will always continue to be one step ahead. Apple always have their ways of glorifying subtle features that android has had for years, and let's face it, although they polish these features in the apple way, they're not very different from android's version of that particular feature . Oh and the excessive hype that comes with using an iPhone is just blatantly disgusting. To many ignoramos people, using an android phone is about equivalent to being poor or something.
Marques you point out the curve on the S22 ultra is the reason you don't prefer S22 display and you prefer flat display. That's reasonable but you chose apple's display over S22 ultra's based on that reason and that ugly notch is still better than that curve for you to choose Apple. Great!!
Give an extra 10 points to cheap repair for android smartphone
Apple is like an exclusive luxury residential compound where everything is so convenient, clean amd comfortable but it's too expensive and the rules are very restricting.  Android is like that cheap apartment where every amenity is   a walk away, but you have to clean your own room and sometimes the neighbors can get noisy because there's no rules at all.
Just here to drop my unbiase dislike. Apple been bankrolling you guys 🤣🤣 Unsubscribed way back
MKBHD is totally biased. He sounds like an apple fan boy. Even if android is better he just days "technically" apple is top notch. I don't even want to continue watching
The bias in this video is overwhelming!
Give 5 points to android for value for money. For me value for money is everything. I can easily buy a top of the line iphone with my salary but why should I? Apple is too restrictive and wants to keep their customers in that trap. Androids are much more flexible and leagues ahead when it comes to price to performance.
why do you need 12 GB of ram on a smart phone, just curious
Never heard iPhone would win a battery section
For the charging it's kinda like respawning vs immortality if you replace battery life with human lifes
Why does everyone make a big deal about iMessage, but I haven't heard anything about Android Messages, where you can use chrome to text?
I have my iPhone 12 and Realme GT Neo 2, it's good to be able to enjoy both and not fanboy over everything, this isn't Lakers-Celtics rivalry, but I'mma keep hating on Xiaomi and it's ridiculous OS support.
What the fuck!! Don't do this type of paid videos 😤.by the way just unsubscribed 😎.
I enjoy the android OS much better.  IOS seems old school with very lille customization.  I will never go to a phone without a 10x optical zoom or higher.  Also, the notch and lack of finger print scanner are deal breakers.
Eco-Conscious is kinda dumb tbh. If you cared you wouldn't buy a phone for 5+ years. I would go by what companies claim.
Collab of the century
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen
its quite sad to wathc the whole video knowing that in general iphone wins unless you go to specific stuff
No matter how much I try I just can't find any good reasons to use an iPhone. Honestly would go phoneless before buying one.
I've always considered MKBHD an Apple lover. Everytime he'd put out a video, I'd watch to see what he has to say, but time and time again he'd prove himself to be an iSheep. This video confirmed i wasn't tripping.   To say iPhones have a better widget is laughable. And here we go with iPhone users using "simple" as a way to prove why Apple has absolutely nothing new to offer. They sit and wait for other phone companies to release new tech ideas, then go revamp theirs like it's something spectacular. IPhone widget to me, is complicated just from looking at it.
Apple also uses cheap children labor.
Brownlee is just baised towards iPhone dawg 💯
i see they got 2 apple fanboys to comapre apple and android
Value is also about longevity and software support, Apple wins. Siri is much better at doing system controls especially in accessibility. Google is better at searching the web, that's all.
Everyone - which phone is cool ? Meanwhile  *Me -  figured it out who's voice is clear 😙
I dont like it.
Idc if u hate me for saying this..but mkbhd is just biased towards iPhone
Arun had no choice then?
One thing that want mentioned is personal data.  You can degoogle Samsung but you are screwed on Apple. Apple also has a Bluetooth that you can't shut down. It always able to be tracked.  Samsung you can degoogle and you can hide your identity.  Apple you can not. It always is easily tracked.   Apple also isn't opened sourced. Samsung is.  Apple also gives data of your personal information to big daddy government.
No! Android is still bettwr
i feel that this video was biased. can't give points to iphone when there's clearly a draw. MKBHD obviously picked the iphone for camera because of all the other perks that iphone come with. not for the phone having a good camera.
Arun is keeping it in careful not to annoy mkb...
The American guy chooses iPhone over the Android. Never would have guessed.
I love android because it has widgets, I phone does not have that. And I love how you can customise android to your wishes than the iPhone at my opinion. But I never use my phone to call or sent sms, I have prepaid so I relay on wifi and that is everywhere these day's. I actually only use my phone for whats-app, making lists, using my calendar and play an occasionally stupid game.
Woah halfway through the video i could hear the apple haters🤣
Android rocks bc it's open source and Apple continues to leverage basic value for more money.
3:06 so truee😄
Good job comparing 1.300$ pro max 13, to every single Android phone, ranging from 1300$ flagships, all the way down to BUDGET phones. A+ for objectivity.
Apple - PS, Xbox Android - PC  Apple's optimization and software support is unmatched but Android phones have much higher specs, more customization, personalization, apps, and uses.  To each their own.
Android is way more better than ios
Interesting... Trouble is, you aren't comparing one thing against another. iOS is one thing. You use it on an iPhone and nothing else. Android comes in many flavours, and you have to keep swapping these to compare them to iOS. But I don't want to carry a different phone for different occasions when I can carry one that is pretty damn good in all of them.   You mentioned an eleventh category. I would suggest Security. And that one iPhone wins hands down.
In my opinion, it's all just about your preference. I personally just prefer the way iPhones feel rather than Samsung but that's just me, we all have different opinions so we shouldn’t argue about them.
MKBHD is laughing on Arun’s accent, I felt this.
I think it's not fair, sry but i didn't enjoy the video, you didn't add many this that an android has and a iPhone didn't.
This is a bunch of bull crap
This is a bunch of bull crap
Marques has completed his transition from Android to Apple fanboy.
Absolutely terrible comparison you cannot compare Apples , oranges,bananas to a mango
Feels like the whole video is biased towards apple because of the declining economy and apple being an American company..
Just a stupid video honestly. You're comparing the average of literally hundreds of phones from a massive variety of companies with very different values and practices to the 2 best models apple makes. I wonder why apple comes out on top
I think when it's a great concept there were a lot of points missed (especially in eco-consciousness and years of support was wrong 5 vs 4 on android), I think it definitely missed the mark and could've been a much better video. As well as using the pillars of imessage, FaceTime, and air drop as big wins even though imessage doesn't matter worldwide, duo exists, and android has nearby share
i want an android with Bionic chip inside it ... that's all I care about 😍
if had more money gonna choose latest iphone..   if not just stick with android phone!
MKBHD really favours apple 😂
Is this a Apple commercial 🤔
I use iphone so i kinda ssad:(
I  dont understand how customization is not a clear win for Android?
definitely a very Biased video but enjoyable
This isn't a good comparison if the android loss a category you should give some points to it.
Iphone solos😹
I love how Mrwhose the boss is supporting apple 🍎
I have the Samsung 10 plus, 21 ultra, and a 22ultra from work. I have 2 sims and I use the 22ultra on wifi and the 21ultra is my primary also it's upgraded to 256gb and 12 gig of ram. And my secondary is my S10+. Though I'm watching this on my S22 Ultra!
me who is still holding a feature phone...feels so compact😁
MKBHD looks clearly based maybe he is right from his point of view but being a tech reviewer he shouldn`t be that biased. He should have said apple is a winner at the start of the video itself Arun feels more like a reviewer where he thinks more from user's perspective
Its personal preference i prefer android. 😌 u cannot put a point system in dat n for cemera s22ultra cemera its just perfect it have all the needs of a cemera macro, ultrawide, wide, 3x for portrait,  10x for super zoom if i have to live forever with a mobile cemera it will b s22 ultra the complete package
This guy never used android in he's life
i could not continue watching this past mid point , so freaking bias towards iphone , since MKBHD is a fan boy.  no metrics were used what so ever , points were given on a sentimental bases  what u guys think ??!!
Iphone
No one nor features would make me use an iPhone!
MKBHD fully inclined towards Apple 😂
I am Confused. Which one is iPhone? Left or right? Blue or green
For me, the biggest + in android side? Microsd cards. I can up my memory for cheap. If iphones had that...
Ecosystem, Polish, Best Video & Crazy Update Support -> Apple  Flexibility & Amazing Choice Range -> Android  Both have about similar security & Photo abilities
I choose android any day because of the ecosystem freedom that you get. Iphone keeps you in a digital prison.
Marques is a blind apple fan and Arun is totally neutral
A video without "Sub to the channel would be....."!! 🙂
I'm an Android stan but i know apple has the W even before this video has started. Android users know what we get and what we want That's why we prefer Android
After Apple started reducing their prices for the entry level ecosystem ( like I have ) , it made their software more accessible. Even someone who always checks my budget I’m more likely to go for Apple these days because it’s reliable and EVERYTHING WORKS together or individually and with universal control I feel like a TechLead.
i think this video should be made after the iphone 14 series relies
tootsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss from a user and phone tech iphone aint say nothing
I accidentally trigger SIRI more than I use SIRI; so true
Should have done this video alone. Marques is heavily biased towards iPhone. Samsung's screen is far better than iPhone's.
I HATE Apple as a company, but I have to give credit where it's deserved...they have come a long way in the last year or two. They've added a lot more freedom in their products. However, they've also done some really stupid things like restrict reparability on the 12 and 13 series. This is the number one reason that I don't recommend the newer iPhones to most people since you have to jump through Apple's hoops to repair them, and its expensive. But in contrast to Android, there hasn't been anything new and exciting for a while... I guess aside from folding screens, which are sooo fragile. Also, BRING BACK THE HEADPHONE JACK!!!
I just lost all respect to Markus he's so brainwashed by apple that he even thinks they are environmentally friendly, Jesus 🤦
Unfair biased comparison, going to unsubscribe!
You guys only speak of what you to think is the best. Your guys most test ut abd convinse etsothers way the one is bether then the other, abd maybe sone of you chance its vue on the phone :)
I'm an iOS user and this video is rigged. 😊
20 minutes of Arun defending Apple
Proud s21 ultra user here 🤘🏼💫👑
I feel like iOS has a lot of things bc it is more popular like in the airdrop and all that stuff if the Apple wasn't as popular it wouldn't be used as much so it wouldn't be as needed
You can also get extra apps to be able to customise things more
I like how this video is put for #18 on trending today and great video dude :)
I am watching more ads
Biased
Love the collaboration with another one of my favorite YouTubers! Thank you!
How can you compare iPhone vs Android? Android is os and iphone is product. Android vs iOS would be a fair comparision or Iphones vs Samsung S series would be fair. Iphone 13 is a particular phone which you are comparing to very low budget phones just because they run on android? Seems very confusing comparison. Either compare phones or compare softwares/os/platforms. Just my thoughts. Thank you.
There's no Air drop on Android. Nearby share: am I a joke to you??
Apple provide software support as their marketing strategy. By upgrade the software, your hardware will not cope and you will end buying new iphone.
Its kind of unfair because its like taking the best bits of all android phones and merging them into one and then comparing it to an iPhone.
Pants Arun Pants pleaseeeeeee🙈
Personally android does everything grt compared to iOS,go check well guys🙄🙄🙄
Apple fan boy
That dude sounds like a iPhone fanatic..u can tell him something awful and he would tell u why he like that lmao smh
For the camera comparison, considering the front facing camera, the reason why the notch is so big for all the camera technology on the iPhone is because the Face ID is way more accurate on the iPhone compared to android phones. The android considers your face in a flat manner compared to iPhone which can include depth and due to the technology to facilitate this the notch has to be there and the iPhone could recognise if e.g. a photo or plastic mask of your face  was just shown to the iPhone, the iPhone can detect that. In other cases not for security it uses machine learning to dictate different layers of photos for example your backdrop.
I'm a fan of both of you guys, but comparing iPhone and Android is a fundamentally flawed endeavor. Android is an operating system. The iPhone is hardware. A better apples to apples comparison (pun intended) would be iPhone to Pixel or iOS to Android.
Ladies and gentleman you have just assisted to a fight between the most two badass high-tech youtube legends . This is history making . .thanks for reading.
ALL THIS ARE SUBJECTIVE...
cool, nice to see two tech legends together =)
Android vs ios is literally samsung vs apple 🤣
only thing i hate about iphone is the notch
Markus is full of sh** how in the hell apple's screen is better if Samsung itself is the one making the screens dude. Obviously Samsung put the best of the best in their phones 🤦🤦🤦
The average consumer just wants a decent cam to capture the moments, battery life to get them through the work day , have emails and social media active and maybe a game or two. Most people don't care about indepth stuff like this . The fact is android has way more options to fit most peoples budget and so it goes .
9.1T dislike guys
I definitely prefer android they have a better display and looks to me and I spend 100%of my time looking at the display of my phone and android has improved lately I really don’t see any reason with to stay with the iPhone apart from prestige and high resale value
Could've been better, it looks like lack of interest (just looks) .
Although I do wish iPhone had usbc but it really comes down to personal opinion. Like me I prefer apple all the way
One of the biggest problems in this video is, calling them (tele)phones Modern mobiles are NOT  Phones, they are full featured high performance computers
Android currently has 87% market share. That means most people either can't afford and iphone or are content with an Android. Yes, the Android takes the cake.
I love Marques but he's kind of bending to apple's side just cause of certain small features which are important to him. On the other side arun is sort of being fair but he can't really oppose Marques more than a certain level. Also to be fair, the android vs iPhone thing cannot be based on things like performance cause nowadays every damn flagship is too powerful for anyone to use it's maximum capability. The one thing i saw from this video, it's only preference which matters, when you choose between apple and android
The meeting from the most tech philosophers thank u 4 making my day u really understood tech🤞🤞🫂🫂👏👏👏
MKB was so cute while he was talking about value.....his reaction were so cute......
GOD OF TECH TOGETHER
for me  all for Android  iPhone 0 without breaking ma bank ay!  n  if anyone says iPhone hv greatest camera let me tell something lad to hv beautiful photo u shouldn't be needing a bludy fan praise  phone but an person who knows hw to click th bludy shutter.. thing with iphone is Apple got thr customers just contain inside ios & mac os ecosystem like binding them to use it n keep improving internally to keep thr customer intact to tht .so for  those costomers it's normally to utter tht iPhone is best cz tht what thr mindset become n biggest problem with Android is "There are bludy amount of android phones I mean price variation n requirements  justifies but jeez too much Android phones"  thts why Android  companies don't focus on improving a basic stuffs
@Mrwhosetheboss, you that that Marques is a huge apple fanboy. There's no way this discussion is valid. And just because you dont use a specific featrure of android (DEX, Multi-task, S-pen) it doesnt invalidade these features.... Next time, please pick a  neutral party.
Looks like someone is paid by apple..
Looove them both. Very knowledgeable. Apple user here. I tried android every now and then but i always come back to iphone.
Aap log apple ki factory me Bane ho?
In camra department it definitely should be android
the only thing that would make me buy an iphone is because i never had an iphone and i just want to try what it feels like to use it.. xD
This video made me unsubscribe mkbhd
“its the smoothest display on a smartphone” Arun- that's interesting 😹
The biggest problem with Android is the optimization.  Android phones are great in specs but they are not opimized well to use them fully.
Should have given the full point for the screen to Android in my opinion
Split screen features only worked during COVID crisis because had to chat while the camera was on
These nerds still doing phone wars? 🤦‍♂️
Android could functioning without Apple. But Apple could not functioning without Google services such as Google map, YouTube, Gmail
Even if I switch to android phone. I still have to use airdrop and facetime on my iPad and Macbook since 90% of my contact lists use iPhones.
These two plus Leo Laporte and JayzTwoCents = Tech TV 2.0.  Take my money please!
I feel like the answers drifted away towards the end, the whole video was about flagships vs flagships, why are we bringing in cheap phones,
Multi-tasking is something I value greatly, which is why I use a Surface Duo 2.
I Recently changed from android to I Phone and I find IPhone smoother and better than android, facts.
Well tech YouTubers won't make much view for the same phone every year (iPhone) Android had so many manufacturer and features that can attract viewers
He is just Apple fan boi
I don't know whether comparing the Android and iPhone since they are working differently and will have different features. They have their own pros and cons.......
Don't waste your money on apple. Much better value on the android side
Portland, JAMIACA in The Building !!!!!!
Almost all of your arguments are just garbage lunacy.
Im terms of eco consciousness a think a big point for iPhone also has to be longevity. Software support for 6+ years is basically unheard of in the Android world.
I switched to a pixel, and kinda liked it. Then I switched back to iPhone, and I can't wait to go back to android. For me, iPhones are better at texting, calling, and other things - like videochatting (facetime). However, they are better at these things almost solely because everyone has an iPhone, and they work great with each other. The android experience is just so much better overall though. TTS is substantially better, the assistant is actually useful, and so much more. The software in general is so much more feature rich, whereas iPhones feel like fisher price toys sometimes. Just my take
all the android users are butthurt lol.
this video reminding me those iphone users meme tbh.
Looks kinda biased.
somethings wrong with these questions because mkhb is using a android phone even though he voted iphone higher and i've used an iphone and it sucks
Lmao, I take this video being biased to Iphone, there's lot of things Android could beat iphone on
I phone is a great phone no doubt. However, it comes down to one simple question for me. I consume the most media on my phone by far, more than TV, tablets, laptop's etc. Question is simple,  would I buy a tablet or TV with that huge notch in it?......the answer for me is a simple, hell no. Its just way to distracting and apple is so much better than that. So maybe in a few years, ironically what I have been saying for a few years now, I will switch, however by the time apple gets rid of that horrendous notch who knows where Android will be. So the debate continues.......
MKBHD is 100% Apple fan. I dont think the final score was fare to be honest
Im not sure why they are including.ROG phone here. It is so unreliable and full of bugs. It is very inconsistent.
Arun's facial expressions just proved how much he disagreed with him. This kind of colab isn't worth it with a person who uses iPhone 98% of the time
Such a bias conversation. You guys had just found criteria and arguments for making apple win. Apple slaves.
I can't see it to the end... How is it possible to compare a brand (iPhone) with a multibrand ecosystem (Android)... Very bad!!! The comparisons are hilarious!!! Please understand the difference between product, brand and system versus system only!!!!
Lol this is a life lesson. All the metrics can be right and the outcome is still underwhelming 🤣🤣  Androids are better to me 😍
you missed one aspect for software support and that's app development.
😂😂so you don't know the android well 🤟 android
OS 👏is 👏subjective 👏 I am a strong believer of this there is no one winner both have their pros and cons
A lot android crying here?
NAH VIDEOS AND PHOTOS ON ANDROID ARE BETTER PERIOD
What is this all about???    This isn’t fair , the comparison isn’t fair entirely!!!!    How can one compare one company to hundreds of companies out their ? Apple is just one just one for Christ sake and their are bunch of companies producing android phones examples, Samsung, Vivo , google pixel , one plus  and so many I don’t even know all and it’s been compared with just a company that is a very point to Apple points up to A+   Huawei can’t give it all , Samsung can’t give it all , Vivo can’t give it all then why will Apple give it all ?   Now talking about the video I think their are some point given to Apple that should be given to android but in android generally the pick features from different android devices from different companies and be comparing them to a single company just because they run different operating system .  In general if actually I am a newbie on smartphones and I want to get a good smartphone , if I actually know that android is already subjected to different companies and the whole companies is been merged to compare to one company, I don’t even need to watch the video to know I am getting an IPhone  Bcz I can’t buy several android devices from different companies to get it all .
American, loves capitalism! After Steve Jobs Android all day!
Shameful, one of the most biased comparisons I've ever watched.
Lol two apple fanboys telling you which is better, iphone vs android.
Iphone be introducing core features which they steal from Android apps😆😒
This doesn't make any sense...are you comparing a 1500 dollars iphone to a 500 dollars android or what? You have to compare it to the same price. So yeah, only thing you can compare is phone to phone or software to software not random stuff
Android Zindabad
Bias plays a significant role here. I respectfully disagree with most of the comparison. I am a Pixel user and I happen to also own an iPhone and an iPad. I rarely use those iOS devices because I prefer android; My pixel camera can do a lot more beyond just taking pictures. I can text/chat with instant translation with people speaking a different language, my Pixel 6 Pro phone magically translates instantly both ways for instance. I simply like freedom and I refuse to be locked up in an apple jail.
Can you review ulefone pls thanks for the great vid
I think Apple is paying you guys cos this is biased
Day 4 of asking mrwhosetheboss to give me one of his phones
Many people knew your gona push iphone...  Android doesn't put you in their cage ... Apple is always gona babysit you 😂😂😂  amd what Samsung have many super duper features than iphones 😂😂
What!!!!! facetime is just videocall on Android
You can easily tell who the Apple and Android fan is. Mr whose the boss wanted the apple to win and it's his show so obviously Apple is gonna win.
This is totally biased
the results just went south when you gave a draw on first question.
I feel like this is biased they are talking about Android being better then they will give a draw?! Really?
If you know where to look in Android phones for each category... The scores would look very different....    Somehow the screen factor is a tie when the redmagic7pro has better screen refresh and touch response with no notch , and Samsung has a brighter screen with better resolution  Somehow the battery goes to apple when he admits the rog phone lasts slightly longer (I would even go as far to say it lasts as long the iphone with its smaller battery), and they didn't mention the rog also has 65w fast charging....  Camera and features , I can say it's a tie since they both have features not present in the other that are important to different  people. Point and shoot photography and rely of software processing, iphone fairs well (let's not forget google cam works better in certain scenarios)...but for manual shooting, there's Sony phones.  Eco friendly factor.... Fair phone... Modular design of Android phones allow for better repairability.. Nothing else left to say.....   Performance factor.  in demanding game titles... Gaming phones actually win in terms of sustained fps...  Samsung and apple devices both down throttle 5-10 mins into the gaming session. Availability of game titles, android actually wins, Since you have access to multiple app stores and there's also APK installation.   Value for money is actually too subjective to compare... Since different people value different aspects.... If performance for money , android would win with redmagic7 or Poco phones.... But if you want camera performance for money it's a diff story.
It’s literally iPhone vs 35 different phones, if that in and of itself doesn’t tell you who the winner is, I don’t know what will
There is also the "wow" factor that Android have. Iphone is great but it just misses that exciting wow factor that android has. Like a phone that fold into a tablet, or a phone that is screen all around onto the back, or a phone with 100x zoom. Sometime people just want that WoW factor.
Bruh apple doesn't care about the planet 🤣 it's all marketing
This seems more like an iPhone ad than a comparison video
20:08 aww he was gonna give you a fist bump ... awesome as always.
Its really up to personal choice
They're HOT! They should definitely get it on.
Look at specs samsung wins everytime
Oh come on.. we expected more of you.. we expected a better comparison. You're the one who reviewed a 250 dollar Poco and other chinese OEM flagships. You never mentioned any exclusive features of those phones. Not even 5% of  Android features were discussed. We expected more buddy! Hopefully next time. Tc cheers!
Samsung all the way!
This not a iphone vs android  This actually iphone vs Samsung
The iphone 13 battery is weak as you use it more, very weak
this video felt like is sponsored by Apple
I feel like it’s not a fair judgement
the day when ios implements a sensible file management system, including the ability to use it as a mass storage device, is the day that I'll prolly switch to it. until then, meehhhhhh
As a person who uses both,  both are better.
There is nothing on iOS that appeals to me, so the next one will be another android.
I have seen plenty of comparisons. In most of them I watched from real tech YouTubers, (including you), android in Photo's and customization, etc, always won. Not sure why this one is different. But I guess things change...
Well you were quite biased towards apple in terms of features....like to use apps like facetime and other you need to be apple ecosystem first otherwise those apps are pretty useless
Lame video... 😂😂 now-a-day every fucking person know about their devices... So its a totally biased video
Sorry to say but it was not the fair comparison 😞
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                                                                                                                                                   /,.,,,/.                                                     ,/.,/.,/.,.,/.,/
i think most android users if they had plenty of money they would go for iphones
Nice work boys, next time do a bigger list. There was a lot left out I assume cuz of time.

Unsubscribe both for this talk..
Honestly just felt like an interview
Love this video, I am in that small minority who plays around with custom roms, kernels and mods so I would not consider an iPhone dispite how good it is. I personally tell people, iPhone is the better choice. I buy it for my wife and I buy it for my kids but for me, an android phone with good community support.
Really enjoyed this candid relaxed style video!!!! It almost gives a after hour type feel.
I feel like if you're not comparing with top of the line android you can't always compare to top of the line iPhone. Like what would happen if you flip it and took a mid range or low tier iPhone. Screen and camera wouldn't be close to Samsung.
I can't wait to switch to an iphone 🥺
Very biased video. Arun, I feel you are turning away from a niche tech youtuber to a more popular approach, which makes sense in some aspects (popularity, views), but I miss the old real reviews and other products outside of apple/samsung axis
cool video i like the diffrent point of view , android all the way thou imo
this is stupidity iOS user will choose iOS no matter how Android good is
Android user but can't disagree with this assessment
wait u said u gonna sleep before 11pm
Can you get the specific games you want? I love to be able to install an update sooner or get any game or app *lucky patcher* I want.
Love the chairs. Manufacturer?
Iphone camera is better but they don't have features like SM.... Like switching camera while recording or directors view etc...
what a shocker 2 iPhone users & lovers.. u get sooo much mote 4 ur money.. & u reviewers gotta stop with this bill shit about camera.. there no comparison I am a personal photographer for vogue.. GQ.. muscle fitness granted I use a personal camera mostly.. but when I do use phones s22 ultra is so much better even the pixel 4 most part is better iPhone at best 3rd & that's if u dont compare against Chinese brands..
How did the iphone win the display category? I really love these 2 youtubers but this video felt like an Apple commercial.
I, personally, prefer iPhone.
sponsored by iphone
The most biased take ever. Well done guys.
A) The Lightning connector is FAR superior to USB-C! On a daily use of a charging cable, in the car, in the office, on the nightstand etc. That cable is unplugged and plugged back in repeatedly. USB-C uses very thin bent metal and the center of it is hollow for the mating end on the device to plug in, which allows for dust to invade the cable end and it wears out much quicker when it comes in contact with the plastic pin inside the device. Lightning cables don't have that problem because they don't have moving parts on the cable like USB-C. The iPhone side is a simple hole that's bi-directional and there's no plastic pin inside to snap off from repeated use like USB-C on the device itself. B) Apple devices were made specifically for Apple and work best with apple products and software. Which means, software developed on Apple works better.  C) IOS gets updates/upgrades often to keep up with the latest security breaches etc and to add new features to their devices. Sure, Android developers do it as well, but how often does AT&T or Verizon actually give you those updates and upgrades? They typically only give you what benefits them, and not you. Because if you dont have the latest Android OS like your friends, youll trade in your 1.5 year old phone for a new one just to keep up. And if you do choose to sideload the OS on your own from an APK, good luck getting support from your vendor when it wasn't approved by them for you to use it. D) iMessaging! It works even when there's no cell service as long as you have WiFi. Normal SMS doesn't work without an active cell connection. There are a lot of places where there is zero cell service
Control on Privacy should be included
It's a huge paid video from apple
Android  vs ios              Or Samsung vs apple/iphone
With all due respect, you flew across the world to have a conversation with an iPhone fanboy
Apple ❤️💜
I trust these two more than anyone on the internet.
opinion moment
For battery life I think Android was a clear winner.
This was the most biased comparison I’ve seen
As I manifesting having a iPhone cuz of many biases I seen around the internet, Androids are economically better imo
Two iPhone users deciding which is better between s22 an iPhone 13? seriously? the result it's obvious before the start come on...
From the moment they gave the screen a draw i knew the rest is bs 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
This felt like a biased video. Not mrwhosetheboss quality.
Ios outdated features lack of features.super old screen design uglysuperduper big notch Total weak camera at night.super thick phone and super bump camera.what the hell is that
seriously video just seems like influencer problems as a normal human that cant afford everything or be paying for it for 4 years i will get the much cooler android options thanks . how was usb c and sd card support missed ?
Really hit each reason why I switched to iOS. iOS 16 is only going to make it better
BIASSEDDDD
So in brief android is more specialised and iphone by far the best general phone
Underwhelmed. I guess its a good opinion peice.
Now let's talk about rights to repair: Said no one ever 💀☠️
Where is the Sponsored by Apple 🍎 indicator lol
Marques' IQ really on display in this video.  The speed at which he thinks of incisive analogies is incredible.
Sometimes it feels like you guys are just marketing iPhones as the ultimate all round phone. You use it as the benchmark whereas it is good but it is no longer innovative even though it improves what Android phones would have been doing for years. When you look at how Android phones meet the demands even niche needs of customers, you can't help wonder how Android is the market research for iPhone. I just wish I had more facts or data to support my claim whereas here in Africa Android is the most user friendly phones ever.
MKBHD is American, and you are giving the Android any chance? No way!! North America identifies with anything Apple, and that sums up the result 😂😂😂
If iPhones had an Android version, I'd buy it right away.
When iPhone get a 0.5 point in display my samsung started crying..🥲
ಸ್ಯಾಮ್ಸಂಗ್ ಲವರ್...
I remember the old days when I was a diehard Android teenager, now I’m a dual weilding Android and iOS enjoyer.
I watched this video and enjoyed it. But honestly I just really don't care which phone is really better.  They're all basically the same other than screen quality and camera quality at this point.  I'm an android user, and I stayed android just... because. I honestly like iphone's and android phones at the end of the day.   They both make phone calls, take photos and do well using any apps.
19:40 5 phones on the table: exist Arun: fuck y'all imma see time from a different one
Lighting was great. Loved the room and furniture
Apple's Eco Consciousness is a green washing. You should do a little more research about it.
Yes!! Always love it when “the greats” collab.
Me: haha iphone is wayy better losers! *watches on redmi 9*
In my opinion I love Markes but he seemed really apple Biased and showing even the littlest of things and I can see Arin could have argued, but he didin't, overall samsung should of gotten better and this doesn't really which one is better it is more about talking about personal, I didin't like how you excluded the fair phone because it is still android, i'm also suprised how Android didin't take software was seemed really biased, same with Photography and in some they didin't converse much but just kind of came to a decision like for videography and idk it just seemed really really biased.. great collab but honestly I was dissapointed
Apple, android, they all work together anyways.
Shouldn't the title be Android vs iOS?
i have used an android and an iphone before. im not one to deep dive and look into every detail and problem. I am currently using an android and have no issues
And the Most Biased and Improvised Video of the Year Award Goes tooooooooo
Sorry, but I'll keep my more user friendly, no speciallty items to use S22+ any day. Air drop is Apples way of Bluetooth shar8ng for Androids. So nothing special there.
Go team iPhone!!!  That’s right MKBHD, Android sucks.
basically, Iphone beat the shit outta andriod
Good ad we got here. Saying that a display that looks 5 years old with the biggest notch is the best absolutely trolling.
This video is about Samsung vs iPhone Instead of Android vs iPhone 😂
Customization a draw? An iPhone is a uniform; an Android is your clothes. Lock Screen widgets may look ok, but that’s nothing compared to the variability of Android. I can make an Android look exactly like an iPhone. You can’t do that with iPhone. (I use an iPhone).
Pricing, how could Samsung charges 1k+ for the flagship phone when they don’t even have to build the OS from scratch, because of the hardware?! 12gb ram for a smartphone and I only have 16gb ram for my work laptop…
Felt pretty biased towards Marquez's niche preferences. I've realised over the years of watching tech channels that Marquez has certain preferences and specific things he thinks are non-negotiable (his photo preference for iPhone processing when it's very subjective, the need to use the camera right in the IG app when you can easily take one natively and post it in the app after, the software hiccups in android that honestly are nowhere near as big a deal as he makes them, etc etc) that really aren't as important to I'd say majority of the tech community. Love his content but I don't fully agree with how objective these subjective ideas are made to seem.
The widget talk is not trueeeeee
There will be a time when apple will charge for Imessage
My first Android sucked but it had a wonderful mod/root community on XDA. I rooted all my phones u til they got so good I didn’t need to. Now I’m all Apple. iEverything
So many butt hurt android fanboys in the comments. Why do you even care so much?
People are saying that Arun was convinced into giving iPhone points but they don’t realize that Marques is the one that uses an android and Run uses an iPhone as the main device
Why argue when you can have the best of both worlds.
This is my fav tech review video of 2022.  I liked the honesty
Als ein apple user habe ich gehofft, dass apple hier gewinnt und mich gefreut, dass apple als klarer Gewinner aus dem Rennen geht. Es ist erstaunlich das bei einer Bewertung eines technischen Gerätes so viele Emotionen im spiel sind. Sicherlich haben alle sich auf dem Markt befindlichen Telefone ihre Daseinsberechtigung und sind technisch sehr weit entwickelt, aber der Kampf um den Kunden wird wie beim Beispiel CocaCola und Pepsi auf emotionaler Ebene geführt.
MKBHD has Apple up his ass 💀🙏
This was bullshit. Pure bullshit.
I'm going to go out on a limb here. Marques' energy is LOW!! Kind of acting like a douche bag here!
Apple Watching this be like: 👏🏻👁👄👁
yo, i personaly think that Andriod is a bit better
Yeah Apple winning eco friendly is a huge joke. They are the kings of anti repair. And having slaves.. I mean "workers" building their phones.
At this moment, it feels like it was sponsored by apple. I like both reviewers, but come on. This was shitty comparison.
Me using both Samsung and Iphone but both are old: 👁👄👁👌🏻
I am using both systems. Mostly an Android user since 2011 . I started using full time iPhone in 2019 and now in 2022. Got to say as a daily driver iPhone seems the easiest to use. Android though has perks which are occasionally useful which iPhones restrict.
Will people one day understand that these influencers live by praising Apple in everything? without praise there are no exclusives and content, therefore there are no content and no profits.
Paid ad by Tim crook... days after the wwdc... unsubscribed from both
Really unfair judgement for the iphone clearly Samsung wins pictures and some other things that are just given to the iphone because you like it,make this fair
mkbhd sound like someone trying to sell an iphone
They were both so gentle and sweet with each other! I was afraid they would kiss each other at the end of the video! 😂😂😂 seemed like such a moment you guys had there mate! 😁😁😁
Once you have an iPhone and a MacBook the cross compatibility is so good that you won’t want anything but an iPhone.
I honestly think your scores are completely flawed much to the point that I've lost faith in you both for that
Arun and Tim cook 🤣🤣
Yes the small ram on a iphone feel like big ram in a Galaxy cause how light the OS is..
I'm using a Samsung Galaxy A23 now and I will be getting the iPhone 14 once it drops 😆
*people talking about battery life of phones*  That one guy with a tablet: hold my beer
So much of this was pretty invalid I won't lie
How much did Apple pay you or Marques for such a biased review. 🙄🤦‍♂️
Sorry,  that was completely biased...
Before the conversation started, I knew that MKBHD was going to favor the Apple, the guy is a hardcore Apple fan. He has all the Apple computers the watch he is wearing and so forth. Dex is not useful? I used it alot, and find it the best feature of Android.   Samsung - Has better screen and quality Samsung - Parts are better than iPhone (cost more to make a Samsung cost) Samsung - Camera are better (way better) Samsung - Software is packed with more features Samsung - Fastest Wireless charging reverse wireless charging Samsung - RAM management is better (multitasking) Samsung- Watches are FAR BETTER than Apple watches (in terms of functionality and features)  Apple - Better SOC Apple - Better OS (because its simple and basic, this is why its faster less features and optimized better) Apple - Better Battery Apple - iMessage/AirDrop  Apple is like getting a product and being stuck with the same design, and feature that you cannot do anything with. Android on the other hand, lets you customize the way you want. That how a phone should be, not the other way around.  That pretty much it.
15:15 😂😂 sorry siri
Comments are full of android fan boys. I said it. And im an android guy  lol
Kind of lame sauce
unless you are also paid by apple like mkbhd,   their is no point to this video
You guys have to start admitting the iPhone isn’t actually that bad MKBHD daily drives an android, he wouldn’t be an apple fanboy, but he still let the iPhone win multiple times.
I'm here for the duo, not the debate. I just love these guys!
Nice
In my opinion, no one is better. They both have their advantages and inconvenients. But I do prefer Android.
“Android” is soooo broad though. I’ve never understood the comparison. It’s essentially iPhone against nearly every other smartphone manufacturer. Like some features available only on a specific Sony may not even be standard on Android (or other Sony) and it would count as a feature available on Android…
Massive omission. Apple has no global back button. Total deal breaker for me.  Plus the restrictive nature of IOS. Which does not allow many tasks that the hardware could clearly do.  IMHO this is to dumb down the UI to minimise support calls. Or in many cases to maintain more control over UX & the source of content imported to or exported from YOUR iPhone.
Damn. The fanboying has gone too far. Thank goodness for the unsubscribe button.
The iPhone battery goes half as soon as you switch from Wifi to outside world.
Android left the earth...
Tell me you are iphoe user and fan without telling me This guy: talking all stuff what iphone have and talking one or 2 thinkgs what androids have even when androids have tons of stuff....ALL CAP  Yeah right..he told us in the end...it was personal thought
i do not know why this video was boring....this is not how ur videos usually are boss
Mkbhd is always such an apple bias so no surprises there
A fair reviewer VS the biggest apple shill on youtube
With MKBHD???? It will always be an iPhone. One of the reasons why I stopped following him after many years. You could bring @MrMobile or @JonRettinger in this video instead of him.
Looks like "Apple Executives" are discussing about Android Phones..
There we finally have the answer
There’s a reason iPhone got compare to all of android
Great seeing u guys, together should do it more often.
IQOO OS 😂👎👎👎👎. Terrible experience
Hate the part where they talk about the planet. Has nothing to do with phones or tech.
I think it's time for me to unsubscribe to those two Apple fan boys, how many who wants to follow me?? You both gonna get a nice pretty check from mr. Apple for being that honest... Everyone knows that Android is a way better OS. You both no longer product reviewers ya two business man now I used to like MKBHD not any more, the other dude not really.
How much did apple pay you to make this video? (Posted this reaction from an iphone) :)
Arun is better on ironing t-shirts. That's all.......
I feel like I'm probably in the minority on this one, but this collab feels more like an interview. Both of you are very talented creators, but this video is driven very heavily by opinion. That said, all the decisions seem to defer very heavily to Marques's opinion. Marques is making very valid observations, but those same observations are very heavily based in circumstance.
Tbh the best thing I love about Android over iOS is that Android is the weird kid where iOS is the group that follows. I'm not a follower, I stand alone.
Definitely tilted toward Apple
Why do we need a smartphone? To watch movies, listen to songs, play some games, browse internet and take some cool photos? So these are the basic features we look on a phone that an average 100-250$ android phone has.
Apple fan boy is showing
Nice comparison even if I am on the Android camp. Would prefer if it includes the security side of things because according to Apple users only Android is unsafe and prone to hacking - the reason being it is open source!
god a lot of android people are not happy just because iphone won…like it isn’t that big of a deal bruh
I havent touched an iPhone in a long time, but last I remember, you couldn't do anything with an iPhone alongside windows without iTunes. I can drag and drop any office files, mp4s, pdfs and the like on my note 9 and they just work. There wasnt any of that proprietary crap.
Youtube Vanced and better ttv is life for me
Like how are we going to argue that android is better than iPhone damn
I like siri better because shortcuts
I’m a huge iPhone fan but I have to admit android has more customization than iOS
You just made android loose in every category
Thanks you Arun for asking the reason of using the s21 ultra by mkbhd 🔥
I can't believe how Marquez is pointing all these negative things of the iPhone, but still gives the vote to the iPhone 🤔
galaxy S22 ultra is batter than i phone 13 pro max
as a android user, its all down to options, but consistent options meaning i know whichever android phone i get there are simple things i dont think about that i can just expect like usb c, more freedom, and customization. i always see iphone as too sectioned and confined from other non apple tech
Ain't no way iphone wins the battery part? Video looking like an iphone fan boy video
why iphone always compared to samsung there's more brands out there like oppo and vivo🙁
And the elephant in the room is PRICE. A win for Android. Next we have SELECTION. A win for Android. Screens, batteries, cameras and apps.....well this really is a wash. I love my Oppo because it was very cost effective, there are no notches on the screen, it is very fast for me, battery life is all day and the most important features on this mobile...it makes phone calls and has texting. My cheapo phone excels in this. Lets really face some real facts here.....first and foremost a cheap smartphone will sufficiently cater to 99% of all users. I simply don't want to be caught up in the Apple world of everything has to be Apple. Too expensive and too overrated.
I prefer android
Well, apple is better, except for that *tells a android cheaper or same price as iphone* ... *Gives point to apple*  Literally the hole video
When you have an american judging then miraculously iphone's decent display come on par with the best display available in the market ( p.s just cause its flat)  What a joke
This was the most awkward collab. Lol.
Mrwhosetheboss just gave him huge recpect here because we all know few of that points should have gone to android😬, camera first hooow can you even compare the camera bro i am using my s21 ultra as my pocket telescope on a daily basis
What i dont agree is that the battery... As time goes on iphone's batt sucks unlike android.. and i ask other iphone user and they have the same issue... Yeah the photo and the camera on iphone is a real deal but... No not the battery it gets sucks
probably payed by apple to say this
My gosh, I can't believe it. I discovered both of you just recently and was like: These two gentlemen should make a collab someday if possible. ^_^ dream come true
I started with iphone with the 3GS, then I went to Android, back to iPhone, then I have been with android since the galaxy S8, but honestly I have gotten so tired of some android problems, specifically with Samsung. I had a OnePlus 7 Pro, then the microphone started going out so I upgraded to the Note 20 Ultra, which I spent 2x as much for, and it was an immediate and significant downgrade. The only upsides were the screen and the s pen. Now I'm honestly considering iPhone for the software support, and the consistency across devices. I'm tired of my phone feeling like it just gives up after it's first year. Either that or I'm going back to OnePlus.
Completely biased to apple 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Apple paid them well.
You forgot to disclose that this was sponsored by Apple. If it wasn't then you guys both dropped the ball on properly doing a fair comparison. "This is subjective or could go either way, point to Apple."  Both have plenty of good, bad, and mediocre things about them. That's why it's basically up to personal choice. Depending on what you compare and what your needs it swings either way. That's what makes this video seem so biased. You could have easily compared things to come out at 5v5.
Love both of you guys but I kept waiting for the late April fool's moment. I was already raising eyebrows, but when you hesitated on software and customization, you really lost me.
iPhone is better
Iphone only contains Features for showoff type people.. I don't find iphone useful .. dual sim problem, Bluetooth file transfer, usb c charger, alot of useful third party apps is not supported, people need to work according to phone .. are you buying phone to work under your phone or use your phone to work ?? Iphone is expensive and low Features phone .. if you are buying for showoff its good
This video shows the whole world of phones vs iphone 📲
I feel like I more or less agree with Marques on this. I feel like the way to sum it up is "most of the time, consistent greatness beats inconsistent excellence."
I'm surprised that when they were talking about value, they didn't even mention ANYTHING  about Motorola. lol
I still think Android is better. Apple just pulls you in to using their products, and even if the important things, like camera quality, and battery life haven't improved as much compared to Apple, it is videos like these that show how Android can pull off something even better.
Mrwhosetheboss is just apple oriented,  very biased on android products
Apple Is not eco friendly when they put the charger in another box.
Am I the only one who could sense mkbhds bias here?
This feels so much like Apple sponsored propaganda …….just before it’s upcoming release of new iPhones …..propaganda I guess….I may be wrong too….just saying….
Yes, lighting is sucks. But is still kinda great job dude
U guys didn't talk about android feature "custom rom"
Felt like Apple sponsored this video
Battery life is better on iphone than any of the android phones I've had.
I think you didn't say the points.... Just want to unsubscribe your channel, I feel you are not honest anymore. Wish the best for videos made, enjoyed in duration.
Video title, iphone is better than android
This was supposed to be our Multiverse of Madness ... And As I feared, reality is often disappointing.. any reasonable iPhone user will agree the iPhone was cut a lot of slack here. Sad to see you boys have gone way too mainstream for the western tech market.
It's the iphone. Enjoy the rest of the 19 or so mins I saved you
Oh boy I sure wonder what will be the winner, especially since  MKBHD is present 🙃
Doesn't samsung make apples screens?
Cool
I thought these were the same person... Whoops
This is the worst video I've seen from both you guys in a long time. Heavily biased to wards Apple for no reason but to maybe keep you from being blacklisted by them. You guys were honest when you started, but now that this is a business for you, most of what you say is filtered through a monetization and profitability filter. It's not about whether Android or iPhone is better, it's just that you guys are no longer unbiased reliable sources to get that opinion or information from. Sad to see you go this way. I hope new honest tech reviewers come up inspired by your younger days, to fill that "honest" void that you guys have left behind.
my iphone battery gonna die before I'm going to finish this video, how you guys gave that category to iphone? 😂😂
SPONSERED BY APPLE
This is an unfair comparison guys... You were comparing one company iPhone with all the Android phones in the world. People cannot commit easily that iPhone is the best and all other companies follow them, and we can see that just looking at the history of smartphone. Apple try to release anything to market after taking that technology to its maximum perfection.
Yeahhh now shut up android fan boys
I can say weight in on this. I have owned an iPhone since the first week of it's release. I only now just switched to Android. I'll explain why I switched first.  For most people who purchase Android it is because of price, price, price. I have a flagship phone for just $400. How? It's last year's model. Android phones drop in price like crazy.  A few things really stand out on Android that I switched over specifically for. Android has LDAC Bluetooth. It's awesome. USB-C for audio as well is important. Fast charging is great, in screen finger print reader is awesome. Also battery life IS way better on Android if you get one with a large battery. Again for audio, when in the car, Android Auto is superior. You can change songs with voice on Google. Siri STRUGGLES with artists names and songs. Not to mention Street addresses.  The downsides: Switching to Android is a huge pain in the ass. It took me three weeks to setup my phone. It was not fun. Also what's with Visual Voicemail?? It's atrocious on Android. This was a feature Apple has solved a LONG time ago. One surprise is Android new messages app! It's actually good! The problem was that it wasn't installed on my phone. It was a third party app. Took me awhile to figure this out. I think that's gonna be the case for most people. To sum things up, if audio is your biggest use of your phone...the answer is easily Android. Go with Apple for ease of setup, and if taking videos is your top priority. (Android is fine at videos, but Apple kills it.)
Awesome Collaboration. I mean most of the people here are adnroid users so you cannot blame them for taking the favor for apple cuz they're using Apple for months or even years y'all just generalizing Apple for bad stuff where you cannot see there worth. Im an Apple fan but I'm using android for years but still Apple for me is the best. And about the collab is lt's just awesome really great!
If you like Apple I feel sorry for you man
Thanks 🙏 for bundling.... But Considering ROG PHONE, ANDROID IS BEST
Love the collab. Two great channels and love the content guys!
Spoiler alert: It all comes down to choice.
Great video Arun, but it looked like this video was secretly sponsored by Apple, even a blind man could see that MKBHD judgement is biased. Do u see the way that guy is defending apple, it's like The Avengers trying to stop Thanos form laying his hands on the infinity stones, I am pretty sure he's an apple lover.   I stand with android. ❤
I have a different interest in what phone is "best" than either of these two great reviewers do - and that is what phone can I flash the OS of my own preference on it, so that it does not by default "phone home" to a particular corporation (whether Google or Apple), and so that it is not stuck with a proprietary and closed off digital eco-system.  Given that Apple is thoroughly locked down, where as many Android phones can be flashed with Android Open Source Project variants (such as /e/, Calyx, Graphene, Arrow, Havoc, etc.) or Linux based mobile OS's (such as Ubuntu Touch, Sailfish, Plasma Mobile, Phosh, Mobian, etc.) - that's where I'm at.
mkbhd not honest, he is a apple guy
8:20 talking about the Suns again Marques?
Commenting on every video I see challenge
Speaking about value does the iPhone se mean special edition?
I usually don't say this but I can confidentlt say This video is absolutely nonsense  Trash 🗑🗑🗑
Which game was he playing?
You went to California wearing half pant 🤣
Nice try defending the war criminal who killed 3.5mm headphone jack
I'm sorry but I'm still team Samsung.
I dont think Marques has much knowledge or awareness about cameras other than iPhone, and some of Samsungs and Pixels. He really needs to deeply try/test out other great android camera-centric phones like Vivo x80's or dive deeper into Pixels, etc....  And at some points in the video, like in the first display category, you have to compare apples to apples, you compared AVERAGE android screens with iphone's; lot of them are cheaper and obviously cannot provide similar display. But when you were comparing the equals, like with S22 Ultra, Samsung obviously has a better display, you should've given that to Andriod 🤷🏽‍♂🤷🏽‍♂
Please reshoot this video with inputs from comments. MKBHD is very biased when comes to an iPhone.
S21 Ultra also has more RAM, and is an actual Galaxy S phone. The S22 ultra is just a Note with a new name.
I couldn't disagree more! I have two midrange phones, one's a Galaxy, one's an iPhone. Same features, but my Galaxy CONSISTENTLY outperforms the iPhone. Also, and this is HUGE for me, text editing on the iPhone SUUCCKKS!!! Also, the file system consistently pisses me off about iPhones! I've had these phones for over a year, and, in the end, I'm glad to have them both! While the Samsung does most things better, the iPhone does do a few things A LOT better... So, if I had to pick just one- It'd be the Galaxy... But I still need a separate phone for work, so iPhone's coming along for the ride!
So biased towards iPhone. Android gives you choice i.e gaming phones, photography. iPhone is brittle and pigeon holes you.  This video is a fail.
Thank you. Loved the content. Made me think about what phone I want to get when my phone finally dies. It’s still hanging in there. May you all please take and stay safe.
This is so true. Androids fucking suck
These two are just my favorite! Make this kind of collab with Marques every year!
Why is it iPhone vs android and not iPhone vs Samsung lmao.. would be a completely different story
android
Huh...so when you flew to California for the apple event....you tried to look out for MKBHD...Amazing 🥰
Love the collaboration. Hope for more vids like this.
Did you just leave Marques hanging for a fist pump at the end? 😳
Seems like a video made by an apple fanboy lol.
I love both of your content. This is one of the first one that I disliked. So much bias from MKBHD ruined this video.
Shouldn't you have given Android a point for the better voice assistant? Android is also at multi-tasking. You may not use split screen, but I used it a ton! Same for pop up windows. Lately I've been using my samsung note 9 at school like a laptop. split screen, multiple windows open all at once, with others minimize as a little bubble, minimizing and expanding the bubble back into a pop up window just like you would on a traditional laptop, paired with a bluetooth keyboard of course. The way I use my Note 9, it's currently impossible to use an Iphone in a similar way, then there's the s-pen. For multi-tasking, that would have given android another point. Android is also better at adapting to the user than the Iphone, whereas the user has to adapt to the Iphone. Another point for Android. Android is more open and free than the iphone as you can download apks and tweak many various settings in developer options, change the dpi, and so on. Now I'm not saying that the Iphone wouldn't still win. I'm sure that the Iphone would still win, but ultimately the score each phone gets is largely dependent on the questions you want to ask and what you want to consider. For now, I'm still waiting for the Iphone to get a few featires that I use often on my android.
This was actually a really intellectual review that's been missing for idk forever.
I have android phones my whole life, and have the highest end phone from HTC, LG and Samsung (they are beautiful and great) until I switched to 13 pro max last year and I can say that I will not go back to android again. I love the Optimization and consistency from the iphone
Marques mentioning the vibration motor is sooo true, I have a note 10 plus, note 20 ultra and the s22 ultra. I can audibly hear the old 2 when they vibrate, if I'm not holding the s22 ultra I'd have no idea it vibrated
Terrible video. Only from the perspective of youtubers. This was heavily apple biased right from the beginning. A comparison by two guys who use iphones as their primary phones. I don't care if Marques claims that he also uses an S21Ultra, he's basically an iPhone user with that apple watch always on his wrist. Worst video both of these guys have made in years
so your telling me there is nothing a s22 ultra is better at than a iphone? 😂😂
And finally there it is 🎉👏 ... " An apple a day "
Idk how fair this is tbh, since this is basically just Apple vs multiple companies. Overall, android basically had aspects dragged down due to certain companies (e.g. the Pixel on the camera side). Kind of an unfair comparison tbh.
Great collab
the Samsung fanboy salt is REAL in this comment section 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 i have both btw..
Flexibility - goes to Android, Design -goes to Android, Customization - Goes To Android, Apps - goes to Android, Features - goes to Android, and so on....Flexibility for choices and pricing, Design because Android has flip phones, sliding phones, folding phones, dual screen phones, etc. Customization...yes, custom roms are amazing but I ca decide how my icons look, how many I want on my screen, widgets for everything not just specific apps, Apps.....we have apps for everything and all the great things mentioned about an Iphones native apps....well Android has an app for that. Not to mention I can use apps from other places and not just apple/android appproved, Feature is one they mentioned but dont realize that there is a feature for everything including IR blaster, IR Cameras, etc. But if I was a Iphone fan boy I would defnitely watch Marques, thank god Mrwhostheboss exists.
I also love how most of the comments are sticking up for android and pointing out that this review was biased. I think ppl are more and more finding their way out of Apples brainwashing marketing and moving into a better tech ecosystem they call ANDROID
Wow, nice apple ad.
Mkbhd is iPhone guy
I love ❤️ the curved screen. That's why I left Samsung. That carbon neutral is total nonsense.
Taking averages of anything, obviously iphone will win any category. This comparison felt unfair.  Why was the software experience even all grouped into one section? Few other odd thing but yeah, you should probably rethink the video
I am still waiting for Windows Phone to come back
MKBHD clearly did not want to piss off Apple at the same time he openly states he uses S21. He will not loss exclusive access to new phones from both camps that way. Very Dull and one sided.
iPhone solos
MKBHD clearly biased lol
Kinda Surprised To See That Much Big Tech Geeks Just Forgetting About 144hz and screens with higher refresh rates when comparing Android To IOS 🥲
Love this video honestly android and apple are just non compatible for me  apple can control there hardware android cant i mean i prefer android but i do like iphones.ive ownd both apple and android devices. But one thing if i could put android on an iPhone i would use the iPhone but at that point is it still and iPhone? Lol love both tho.edit i really think it should have been equal scores ngl
Iphone/apple products are a dictatorship while Android has a democracy type feel. One is very restrictive and not compatible with other brands/ 3rd party hardware, and one is virtually able to be used on all hardware and software. In my opinion apple products offer the least amount of value for what your paying for and what your getting. And I hate when people say that its simpler to use, which is not true at all, its just that you were brainwashed and fell into the trap of Apple that keeps you in their ecosystem.
missed fistbump @20:09
This feels only like for US or something, the price and repairablity and all those other stuff are not the same and  a lot and i mean a lot more expensive and doesn't worth. this feel really biased ngl
LG has the corners on photography they have the best cameras bar none.
BROOOOOOO NICE! Dope as video!
Let’s not forget we are comparing iPhone to literally all Android companies Android phones. Not just comparing iPhone to Samsung but all of Android and iPhone is still beating in a lot of category’s,
sheeshhh MK 🤣... definitely a Apple lover🤮... for us Android really win♥️
IPhones are manufactured with slave labor.  Enjoy your toy.
LETS GOOO THEY FINALLY COLLAB AHHHHH
This two dont have idea of fixing phone, i smell bias at is finnest.
Repairability Availability Depreciation These are the ones that should be on the list BTW photography and videography is same category And USB C definitely gives the eco friendly point to android
this video doesnt make sense. this should have been iphone vs galaxy, not "four phone lineup vs entire operating system". the moment you started talking about "well it depends on what android we're comparing to", it should have been over. the absolute myraid of options tailored to each users' preferences is an untouchable win for android.
Arun AND Marques in a collab?  I've never clicked so fast.  Not gonna lie... Felt a little biased here, especially on MKBHD's part. A lot of his points were really subjective whereas Arun stayed fairly neutral.  For instance, the curved edges vs square edges.  That's entirely subjective. iMessage/Air Drop/Facetime/etc...  All subjective and mainly based on being a US smartphone user with primarily US smartphone users.  Rest of the world uses other options and could care less about those things existing, which is probably why a lot of the rest of the world just buys what they like and iPhone has a much lower userbase outside of the US.  A lot of Marques' "nuances" were mainly based on things HE and other US users like him use, which is not the majority.  Just my .02  I'd love to see a collab with someone like Flossy Carter whose also fairly neutral reviewer.
Mkbhd is biased towards apple
Why does Marques looks like he wants to eagerly end the vid asap
There are a few features missing from iPhone that I like using even on my mid-range Samsung. If they add those, I would consider getting one over a Samsung phone.
They like getting F@cked by apple hence it's better in every way
After a point of time it was clear that mkbhd was apple biased lol
tbh this comparison was very baised... they will mention so many good points of an andriod but still give a point too apple
.......this felt a bit biased
Theres no hint of biasness in this video. The android fanboys are just being triggered here
Best tech video of the month
TBH, i just bought apple for a aesthetic quo but for all occasions i use andriod.
How much did Apple paid you guys for this piece of work?
Android is win in a poin but the sore goes to iPhone
On the value side, Iphone is the winner as it retains most of its price if you want to sell it after a year or two.   Typing this from a Poco f3.
Android fans really don’t like hearing this huh? This whole comment section is people saying their takes on why android is better. At some point it became fashionable to hate on apple, especially when their phones were so so restricting and behind but the last 5 years apple have fully taken over in most categories.  iPhones just work, it’s as simple as that.
You're comparing the downfall and failures of multiple companies who use Android against a one polished iPhone. It should have been samsung v iPhone or another brand. Pushing the limits to grab some unsubscribes out of this one.
x
phone does phone things
This video feels so biased 💀 This is ignoring so many problems with ios/iphones just to make Android seem worse. It's also not fair to compair Android and iPhone. Compare Samsung and IPhone or a whole bunch of companies. Just make sure you don't let a bad Android bring down the entire grade for Android tf lol
Here is something to bring some clarity…  If you want great hardware, great screen, great camera, great battery, great specs - go for Android.  If you want great software, great app collection, ecosystem, privacy, security - go for iOS.  We buy the platform - not the hardware.  You are welcome…
Why all the android’s users getting angry, this is just pure facts that iPhone is way better then android just accept it.
Power of IPHONE ❤️
DISLIKE..... You compare ANDROID vs crapple so thats mean any android phone... In battery there are androids with 10k+ mAh thats mean its better that any iphone.. almost every category android is waaaaaaay better..  android = every android phone not only the shitty s22 ultra. If you want a SMARTphone then you must know how to use it.. android can do EVERYTHING iphones are completly locked.. you can do nothing!!
Recorded at… Apple facilities?
More collab
The video is biased from the start they are both apple fan boys
"I know you can do more multitasking with androids, but because we don't specifically use these features personally, the point goes to the iPhone" The bias is insane.
it would be best if you also did a collab with flossy carter..that guy is the most honest phone and tech reviewer in youtube history
This is a good video to showcase that "the best" doesn't necessarily have to be your choice (or the choice of an average consumer), as they've said. Because, for most of us, what's important is the price-to-performance/utility ratio.  e.g. If I'm looking for a daily driver, I don't really need the best camera - I just need one that's good enough and good for its price. In most cases, flagship phones are overkill to the typical consumer. The same can be said for other phone features.
I can't believe how biased and untruthful MKBHD is. It's not even a joke, look up Samsung and Apple's eco-friendliness, look at their display tests, camera tests, everything. If MKBHD wasn't there to be the Apple fanboy, Android would have thrashed Apple
mkbhd was super biased.   its not nice seeing a comparison and then looking it in such a biased way.  Arun was so visibly not agreeing to a lot of his answers but then what can be done. Arun was Stumped by MKBHD answers.  Arun your videos are something that we always look forward too...
Are u comparing android average vs iphone?
as some one who works at o2... Iphones have most of the problems
Android is clearly the best especially Samsung And Google android The best Smartphone🔥😍
Who else is looking up Arun's shorts?  😛🤩
Seems unfair, giving iphone all the points.
You guys are bought and paid for by Apple. 😆
Iphone doesnt win, this is hella biased
Videography and os fluidity goes with iphone. Customization and more freedom is android.
Being able to access your files and pretty much do anything with them just like how you would do on your computer is the biggest difference  and most user friendliness aspect of Android over I Ios. There is nothing smart about $1000+ phone If you cannot access your files
So off cricket wireless I was looking to buy a phone off there that is a android  since its my preference, i want to buy one about $200 ish some dollars. I was looking into buying either the Motorola G Power 2021 or Motorola G Power 2022 or Motorola G Stylus 2022 or Galaxy A32 5G or Galaxy A13 5G. Or A13 just  depends on how many gigs of ram is in there.
I say hands down android. Apple wants you to only buy their product whereas Android lets you integrate so much more. Also, I noticed people talking about repairability. I've never had to have any android phone I've owned repaired. That tells me something.
They went to mark rover lol
So sad that MKBHD has turned into an Apple fanboy. Mrwhosetheboss always goes more in depth and actually uses the phone, not just says good things to get paid for them.
I've used both Apple and Android phones. I'm going with Android. Apple does have some strong points, but in my experience Android charges faster of course with the proper charging brick as mentioned, with that being said, in some cases, Apple's battery lasts longer due to the fact that it has nowhere near the amount of features (reverse wireless charging, Bluetooth S-pen to name a few) and customizations that Android has, so of course this impacts battery performance in a lot of cases. As far as cameras are concerned, both are not too far apart as far picture and video quality, with that being said, It does depend on the user and what camera settings are selected during the taking of a pic or video. You can't go wrong with either phone. Just comes down to personal preference and the community you're already apart of, i.e. if you have a Tab S8 and Samsung Earbuds and USB Type-C cables already, I'm sure you'd get an Android. Same goes for the Apple community in having a Mac book and iPad with lightning cables lying around. Lol. Both Android and Apple phone's have a lot to offer and both are really good phones.
I love Arun and Marques but this was so biased.
Most needed at this time. Thank you both ♥
Spoiler alert:       it's all about preferences. Then why would you include a points system anyway? I think that both of you should have given points individually because you disagreed on so many aspects...
I feel like you need to do a 2 stage version as there are enthusiast users that will def chose android and basic users (most people) who would maybe benefit more from Apples offerings as MKB shared "across the board"
You also never mentioned apple's appalling use of child and slave labour in their factory, wonder why not?! That was the biggest biased of all time 🥶
And here we go the fan boys fight again begins :)
Samsung has the best display and still you are making it draw 🥱
I don't like iPhones 'cause you never feel it belongs to you. You can't copy music on your phone like a sane person, you can't change your ringtone without making too much fuss etc. Everytime I wanted to do something I learned either it's impossible or you need to do extra amount of unnecessary actions.
I'm blind so I don't use my camera and my screen is actually turned off. I would like to know how Apple voice-over stacks up against whatever android uses for a screen reader.
my 2 most favorite tech people in the world in one video again... yeeees!!
Never disagreed with the pros. But this was completely biased.
Oh somebody is afraid to annoy Apple.......
I agree with your opinion guys. The iPhone might be quite expensive, but it’s worth it compared because of camera, speakers, build quality, battery and ease of use.
I am not surprised that iphone win because it dose work better than any other phone in evry Situation
pictures were a draw 😂😂😂😂
Very close I think the android overall is the better experience because of endless features
Rigged. Biased.
But we all know where this would end,Marques is a big fan of IOS,there is no way Android would win better than Iphone if hes the one choosing....Jeez😒
Thats a fucking Apple ad, wtf
Okay, I know this discussion was sponsored by Apple by looking at you guys. I know the US gov wants us to stop buying Chinese phones because Chinese phones are more affordable than iPhones and china starting to dominate the economy.   Android we have more choices compared to ios, display Samsung is superior larger and brighter no notch or Sony Xperia has full screen 4K 120fps.  The battery is drawn, and android has faster charging but average battery life but the budget phone also has fast charging but on iPhones, only the ip13pm has superior battery life with slow charging. Social media iPhone win Camera Android win Video draw we have more choices on android we have 4K 120fps on Sony Xperia and video stability is better on some Android phones like Vivo, and Pixel. Google Assistant is superior to Siri no doubt In gaming android win, gaming phone has a built-in cooling fan and can give full performance stable fps, iPhone when the phone overheat the screen will dim and frame drop. Chipsets iPhone win
I really can't sleep anymore. Why did you guys do this? Why? How did you let this happen Aron. We need another retake. This video was super rushed, unplanned and heavily biased.
Probably should have named it why I prefer iPhone 😂 niggas not deeply using the android
uh yeah I phone, how much did they pay that guy?
Android 💯
apple ad
there is no comparison. apple is better. but with android you have more choices like price . i want a 6.67 screen with gaming abilities and a good screen. i can't get that with apple with the budget i have
108>12 Androids have the best screens with highest refresh rates and highest resolutions. Software updates don't mean much when the newest software update that iOS has is  what Android had 4 years ago. Benchmarks don't equal real world use. FaceTime and iMessage are not the only applications that can do video calls and message others with special affected.
Mkbhd logic - iPhones edges doesn't feel good but i like that it feels bad in my hand. So apple gets a point.
Isnt nearby shear the Android Version of airdrop?
Looks like a commercial for apple
Hey @mkbd and @arron why don't you both try the planet computers astro slide 5G and than come back and talk about software support because it can also multi boot with a easy use Linux, Apple or Microsoft operating systems
They know android will win the charging aspect so they just has to add it to the battery longetivity and give the win to the iPhone how.2 apple fan boys trying to be fair here but everything in their body language tells it all😂
Love this videos 2 big YouTube bosses iPhone vs Samsung 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Marques seems sleepy and sounds sleepy😅
I've been watching MKBHD for years, and throughout the years Marques has just became unbearably biased towards Apple. First off, picking and choosing if you're putting iPhone against a mid-tier phone or a flagship depending on convenience is insane. Secondly, saying that the iPhone has almost all the features of an android phone is just demonstrably false, and that's by design. Apple wants you to do things THEIR way. The screens are also not comparable with the high end Android phones, I'm sorry. The worst thing is, I only use android and I do think that as a whole, and especially for non-enthusiasts, iPhones are actually better, but the arguments are just not the right ones.
The only clear win for iphone is its efficiency and software... everything else is 🧢 and subjective..
Soooo incredibly biased...you guys could've done better.
The two of my favorite tech youtubers. Woah
With the end score of 2.5 vs 7.5, it looks like iPhones are far better, when in reality Android is just a little worse on these points. I feel like that should've been mentioned in the conclusion.
As someone who has owned both it is laughable in the comments to see people trying to justify android getting no love from them in this video. Really it would have been more fair if they compared Pixel vs Samsung vs iPhone but even then the iPhone will come out on top since it is simply a better value at the current moment. The only real downside is the "walled garden" being too strict but for 90% of users it wont affect them. I really hate to say it but the iPhone is killing this current generation. Almost every android has a gimmick that ruins it which will continue to be a problem for the near future.
So this basically is an Apple promo video 😂😂😂
USB-C all the way. Apple lost me when they slowed the software down on purpose. Apple is big in the US not most of the world. After Apple screwed everyone years and years ago with that software slowdown to make you think you needed a new phone. Never, I mean never, will I go back to overpriced Apple products.
Android user all the way.
Moving from Apple to Android, there is no way I'm ever going back.
This really jus seemed Biased
naaaa that is not fair enough...Android have some features that are far better than IOS and that is a fact...Aron this is not a fair video.. you and MKBHD are bias here.. tell the truth ANDROID IS BETTER THAN IOS
This is Apple sponsored "trip to USA" for "promotional" interview. This guy sold out and hid his "apple" stuff while pretending to be android guy cause he knew he didnt have chance to grow his youtube ch. with apple in face of competition TILL he "made it" and then came out.
Another biased youtube video.
Since when does iphone have better battery than android?? . The iphone 13 pro max has 4,352 mAh And Samsung s22 ultra has 5000 mAh . Even Samsung a51 aka: 300 dollar phone has 4000 mAh battery
Something tells me this guys have seen the iPhone 14🤞😂
Reparability a huge factor of eco-conscious, USB C is huge, charging on android is far better. Android is just better for photos, even in apps these days. The rest of pretty fair though.  I feel like this needs to be more critically evaluated because there are some huge biases here that need to be addressed.
Android (Samsung) will always be better because you can sync it to the computer and use Samsung Dex.
I can't stand a locked eco-system, so i can never use Apple ever.
Dislike button ↓
To be honest really, for a collaboration long in the wait, I think this wasn't a great idea. Great video no doubt but having it end like this with so much bias, so much question marks. You both should've talked about something else. It feels like you both were paid or forced to do this. Please we need a retake of this video even if I know we can never have that. Another collaboration please and please do not mess it up again. I haven't been this upset in a while.
If you go for iOS then everything else you by needs to be an Apple product which ties you up into their system and expensive
samsung DEX, split screen, secure folder matter to me alot!!!
If it can't fold, have a dual screen or carry a pen, I'm one of those few who won't touch iPhone. I need the split screens and multi windows. Pip just isn't enough. I'm gonna be stuck with my LGV60 just cause I love the Quad DAC headphone jack and dual screen. I even attached a Bamboo pen. Plus... The LG version of DEX is pretty good now. I guess when it's time for a new phone, I'll go Google Pixel fold
Youtube pls bring back dislike button👎
But pointless, they're nearly identical at this point
In my own personal experience I had iPhone 13 horrible phone it would freeze and calls weren't the most clear so I sold it and down $350 on android phone I'm so much happier Ive had no problems no freezing and calls are clear and my phone is 5g so a plus
Personally i say Samsung Galaxy S10+ 1TB Edition is the greatest phone ever made
I think you should call it Samsung vs Apple
2 Apple fans to give an "unbiased comparison" get an Android enthusiast next time. That being said I'm a fan of you both, nice video.
This is totally subjective and controversial 😂 4 of the apple 🍎 points actually went to Android for sure. But Apple is just damn good at what little they do.
These two seem pretty biased towards Apple is what I heard them repeat throughout the whole video.
Apple still don't got Fortnite like Android does 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's crazy how these guys influence the world.
I was sad to see that there wasn't the 10 categories in circles with a logo on the side. I love that they always have a progress ring around it.
Comparing iPhone vs Android phones would be like comparing the US vs Europe. I think you should compare iPhone with a specific phone or iOS vs Android OS.
It's all subjective  iphones aren't bad phones but I'm not a average phone user so an iPhone won't work for me  so I go with the Zfold or pixel I want my phone to be free like a PC so I want a file system , I want custom themes  ,  custom ringtones, custom launchers ,  I want to play emulators and just go on the web and download custom versions of classic games , If I prefer pixel photos I simply download the pixel camera software to my z fold , if I like oppos live wallpapers I just download it to my phone and apply it ,. If I like the pixel launcher better then Samsung's I just download it , if I want to get documents and spreadsheets done and still have access to my phone I just cast Samsung Dex to my monitor or tv and pair a keyboard and mouse so I can get work done and still reply to messages, do video calls , etc. I can't do those type of things with a iPhone
The most controversial question regarding smartphones.
This is an ad for apple
Very first thing, android definitely out does iphone in the screen, and you call it a draw? Mkbud can't be taken seriously. The bias for iPhone is truly out of this world insane. It's not a good phone.
I love how on the S22 Ultra screen comparison B-Roll, it’s on 69% battery
So everytime when Android has an upper edge somehow it get tossed to the side and we hear how great the iphone is
Alternate title : Iphone knocks out android in the second round !
Super.
That's just Bullshit ... Clear Winner is Android!! 😎
These two are the best tech YouTubers and I really enjoyed listening to this conversation. Keep up the great work and thank you for giving us this video.
Team Android for life.  Kinda BS scoring but what can ya do?
Sorry. Shallow garbage.
I just don't prefer Android.
This whole video was epic as shit... Just 2 dude talking about tech... And they're the 2 biggest tech dudes on YouTube no less 😂🤣 It's like the marvel vs Capcom of YouTube videos
Don't ever ask mkhb to ever down-talk iPhone. The dude is an apple ambassador!
Bias
I feel like it's more fair to compare the top Android to iphone since there's are some terrible Android phones that bring it down
What would i say ? It's all about your preference & mostly Budget.
With a number of things that this applies to, some companies are so rushed to get new features, but Apple takes their time and does it better. That’s why so many people use Apple.
He said that the lock screen thing was good on Apple just wait till he hears about KLWP
I am not surprised at all..I never used an iPhone though.. I wish to use it..I think whatever apple does, does it better than Android.. They brings the feature late.
Yess I lov he flat edges on the apple phones
Sorry but apple fanboy video by far.  I'm an iPhone user myself but realize the benefit of open source, fast charging, better screens etc.
The problem with going with an average when talking abt iPhones and androids is that it inherently becomes unfair as you're taking the top of the line from the iPhone sicne that's all they offer, but averaging down on Android because we're starting at the top and increasing the sample size by going down. This means that no matter what category you go for it will always be averaged out to the iPhone since that has a far smaller sample size. What you guys should've done was take a few key android phones maybe 5 of them, and compare the iPhone to the average of those 5 specifically. This would've made for a far more fair comparison as we don't need to lessen the credit to android by going through all the cheap and failed phones or the extreme phones.
I'm android fun but with pixel 6 I feel like the more capable and existing android phone gets - the less stable it is. If iphone 14 will finally get type C and a small front camera cutout - I will switch!
I feel this is a pretty unfair comparison.  Apple makes both the iPhone and iOS, which is designed for iPhone.  Yet Android is an OS for a multitude of phones.  It's as silly as comparing an Xbox or PS5 to PC.  Both Xbox and PS5 have OS, hardware, etc specific to those products, yet across the world there are so many PC configurations you can't really compare them.  Same with Android and iPhone.  You can't compare a single manufacturer with only 4 or 5 phones, most high end, to a slew of hundreds of Android phones.  A better comparison, IMO, which has already been done to death, are at price points.  What does the iPhone SE offer compared to most popular Android phones in that price point, what does the iPhone 13 range offer compared their popular android price points?  That makes more sense IMO.
ROG phone iOS is good
Disappointed, it is very one sided and doesn't always look at the bigger picture. Iphone certainly is a good phone, but kinda forces your hand into apple eco-system. That is a problem, that is barely mantioned. also the variety you have with Android and flexiblity is amazing, you cant forget about that. Very one sided video. Im ok with iphone winning it, but it is not as lob sided as you made it seem.
Android is better and I’ve owned both over the years currently have the 13 pro max but wish I would of bought the s22
There is no credibility in comparison
It's important to note that on every continent except North America, Android is the market leader. And by a pretty wide margin. For Marques that would introduce significant bias - probably his whole social and professional circle is iPhone people. Arun is a lot more balanced, you can see his surprise with the choices Marques makes because he's clearly seen Android in a lot better light.
Are huawei cameras still top notch?
missed universal usb c charging, whilst the iphone does have usb-c at the plug, that female connection on the plug is not handy if i have to buy a usb c cable just to use it at 20w on other devices, so thats a plus for android. Innovation (early access to useful features) - its the option to have these newer features like foldable screens or new ways of working never seen before, good or bad its the users choice.  ease of use eco system, such as emails, google drive vs i cloud etc  and also ease of connectivity with devices  in my opinion those things are a plus for android
Damn Marques seems to be letting his his love for the apple computers affect his judgment with phones. Giving the display a tie and photography to Apple is bizarre ( I have both 13 pro and s22u ). 90% of the time I prefer the photos of the s22u over iphones.   I'd expect a professional reviewer to actually focus on professional level performance you can achieve with both devices. With samsung expert raw you can get actual professional looking results.
sad to use android and not even use multi, wow.
FRUIT COMPANY FOR TECH DISABLED JADED NON-USERS  -6
We know who is an Apple lover =  Mkbhd  :)
.
I really miss rooting my Android phone's. Bricked a few but that's how it goes. It's getting harder  to do these days.
You can't compare iPhone to all android phones. Compare iPhone to Samsung or iOS to android, that's how it's done. And when comparing operating system, just talk about the operating system full stop
all basic apps on google is better than what apple offer. maps, calculator, mail, free cloud storage, traslator. and that make me sad
And this video is sponsored by apple 🤣👏
Uh-oh, looks like iphone spanked dat azzzzzz!!!!!!
Android wins
Mkbhd is fucking biased. Why am I even here. These guys are into the apple ecosystem and so much love it. Their perception of the iOS has made them compare all android phones as one.
Honestly not satisfied with this
Everyone will have their own opinion. I think it comes down to user preference to be quite honest. The scoring could go either way depending on one's needs or wants. Here in the US I wish everyone wasn't so locked into Apple's ecosystem. I like Android hardware better even though I use both. Apple is just boring. They never step out of comfort zone. I mean iPhone still looks the same since iPhone X.  Apple just does it better with their simplicity and ecosystem. iMessage, FaceTime, Air Drop, etc. I happen to keep my eye out to see what phones people are using when out in public just out of pure curiosity. I'd say it's 80% iPhone in my area. Which is disappointing to be quite honest. I switch between my iPhone 13 Pro and Fold3. I always find it hard to stay with one for an extended period of time.
I honestly feel that most of the points here were biased actually.. but then thats base on their opinions
You should have mentioned about USB-C in eco category. I mean iPhone forces you to buy proprietary Lightning products over USB-C which is the big part of e-waste. I think you guys misjudged android in software features category. How come Android couldn't beat iOS? Custom ROMS, sideloading apps, overclocking, adblocking, sound customization etc.
Why dont you guys show us the cheque y'all  got from Tim Cook? Since you both got together, a better topic would've been fantastic!
You could go 10 nil to  Apple but I'd still never buy an overpriced overhyped fruity phone
I feel like Apple’s win here is even more surprising when you consider they’re going up against dozens of Android manufacturers versus a single company, it’s truly impressive
Feels like it was more of MKBHD ft Arun than the title suggests plus felt Arun was was leaning towards what ever he said , MKBHD is clearly a apple fan boi
I think this video was dope af! You picked  a great guest who had very good knowledge about alll the topics as you did you! Always cool to see my two favorite Tech Youtubers collabing! Its like when Batman was in Superman shows and vice versa
This comparison becomes more inaccurate each year. Android phones feel so different after I used a xiaomi and a Samsung. It is better to compare specific phones eg iPhone vs a pixel.
so regarding what MKBHD said about "im ok with phone draining quick if it charges quick" This will potentially halve your phones total lifespan over a few years, as you're using more charge cycles. The reason the I13PM is so good is because it doesn't deplete from 85% to 20% quickly (A charge cycle consumed)  It will last MANY more years, Companies like samsung and similar do NOT offer $50 usd battery swaps like apple, Apple has done a lot of scummy business things in the last 10 years, but batteries is where i will praise them. 5 years of guaranteed software support, they are viable for 7 and up to 10 years if you take care of your device and keep it on the final version. they make a damn good device and that is undeniable.   ultra fast charging just feels tone deaf during a global economy crisis and climate change disaster unfolding before our eyes. Apple wins here on Eco-friendliness. and up to 20% of the phone is made with recycled materials.   I've used droids for over 12 years, im team iOS this time around.
Would never want an iPhone again. They're terribly ugly with the round corners, and the incredibly clumsy notch. I switched from iPhone to Samsung two years ago, and now have an S22 Ultra. Light years more pleasant use than iphone
This one goes to the iPhone,This one goes to the iPhone,This one goes to the iPhone,This one goes to the iPhone,This one goes to the iPhone,This one goes to the iPhone,this is a one sided video in my opinion.
Memory management is better on iPhone.  You can’t compare the ram.
You just called people like me who used to be into tweaking and miss a "a shrinking minority" 😭
controversial but nokia is the clear answer
Nah, lockscreen widgets on Samsung is also cool, to be honest more fun when compared to the iphone. Only if Samsung would give it's users the option to further customize it, add and remove widgets, then hands down it is the best 👍. Enable the feature, click on the clock on the lock screen to access your widgets and more 👍. Customization on Android is also way ahead of iOS, Android is completely underrated at this point because folks are blinded by iOS. I also wish for Google to implement that in Android 13 or 14 with Samsung's approach. Funny enough, I had a BlackBerry back in the days, people would say the BlackBerry 10 OS gesture is not a reasonable approach, spitting dislike over it 👎, fast forward 🔼 they are all loving it in iOS and Android. They world is completely biased you know.
Lol this was an absolute joke... fucking horrible opinions completely biased to Apple makes no sense whatsoever. Particularly the camera.... the IPhone camera is absolute garbage at least 5 years out of date at this point.... seriously wtf
bruh what are half of these features I have a Galaxy s8
IMHO, almost every category would've been a win for Android if not for Apple's SoC. Their chips make them overcome any shortcomings
I'm an Android user (Pixel 6 Pro) and I have to admit, Apple has surpassed Android in almost every way. I would even go as far as to say Androids has taken a step backwards.
Wow, I actually found it useful, in my opinion, I have it mixed. Because, I am in the apple ecosystem, switch to a new so with new accounts, and a new type of device would feel kinda different, in a good and bad way ngl. The good things, are the camera, no notch, beautiful display, even though I feel like the apple iPhone 13 kills it, and is better.. I feel like Samsung is great at have a bezel less phone with the S22 with a sleek and very nice design, but Apple iPhone 13 also has a okay design, in fact it is also really good. So that’s my opinion. Apple is more focused on saving the environment though, not saying that Samsung isn’t.
So far this hasnt been a good video. Every scorepoint they go “well the iphone is pretty good at that but there’s some androids that do it way better, but then most of the androids don’t… so the point goes to iphone”
This is  a very unfair comparison 😒
This is perfect and so unbiased
I have been a loyal Android user since the original G1 and currenlty using a P4-XL.  How can you convince me to switch to an iPhone?  Keep in mind that I tones of free cloud storage in Google Photos and I love to customize the OS.
I have an issue with my s20+. my wifi will be working and it's saying that I don't have internet access. had a previous samsung and had the same issue. but my wifi is always working
Had my first iPhone ever, lasted 2 days before I decided to return it ( I used it over a week though before officially starting the return process). Great for airdrop with Macbook, the camera is great, battery life but everything else was to difficult on iPhone because of its "simplicity" that made my life harder in every respect especially as an assistant while driving (can't check business times, ask it to call business, use another map other than darn apple maps)
Just gonna point out that a LOT of these features were hardware-based. Android does generally have worse hardware, but the software has *so* many more features than iOS. App icon themes have to be done manually on iOS (vs android is hitting a button), jailbreaking requires you to stay on outdated versions of iOS (vs rooting in Android can be done on the latest version), custom ROMs on android, etc etc just aren't there on iOS. Plus the little things like less frequent system updates and smart charging (I actually don't know if that's on iOS or not but still).   iOS is so locked-down and restricted that I don't feel like I actually own the phone, regardless of hardware. Android lets me control basically everything, and make the phone the way I want it.
For a company that uses a proprietary port that creates thousands of tonnes of e-waste and forced users to ditch their wired headsets, the "environmentally friendly" tag is kinda rich
Lol, gonna have to disagree with the Softwate Reliability draw. Android and Software Reliability cannot be in the same room. Also Android is like Windows, where some apps have new modern popups and others have pop ups from Android 2. Like Windows having settings screens from the Xp Era. Software reliability and continuity are not androids strong points.
The screen rating was so not fair. You’re comparing the iPhone 13 pro max to $250 androids with 120hz screens. Bc every other thousand dollar iPhone doesn’t have 120hz. Android should have won for simply having it as almost a ubiquitous experience among new devices. Also to give points for efficiency when it doesn’t benefit you in a real way, like it doesn’t make the phone lighter, why do you care if the phone has 6gb of ram vs 12? It’s just numbers on a page at that point.
very one sided you could see that mrboss was very pro apple for some reason. example, siri is trash compared to google,,, for some reason doesn't give android points....
MKBHD is an apple fan boy
Privacy?
Wow! “It is so bright, it feels bright” - Arun MRWHOSETHEBOSS
Android fans: the iPhones are shit and overpriced Two biggest tech YouTubers 2.5 / 7.5 for iPhone lol
Personally I am never going back to apples products because they only have closed source software for their products only and I DO NOT LIKE THAT!!ON THE FLIP SIDE "GOOGLE"/"ANDROID" OFFERS THEIR OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE TO EVERY SINGLE COMPANY EXCEPT "APPLE" THAT MAKES THEIR OWN BRAND OF PHONE!!
Why do i feel like  Your accent has changed a lil??  Or you’re trying a bit harder than usual? 🤦🏻‍♂️
My S22 message vibration is terrible. I honestly would take it back if I could just for that aspect.
Samsung Is Better Then Iphone
I'm surprised iOS won by a landslide. I have used and developed for both. I prefer Android from a user experience. Simply for the freedom of every aspect. After all these years I could see myself not caring what phone I use because they are both so advanced and mature. But freedom of options, modding, choices, devices, and prices will always win for me overall. I guess another way to put it is "power" in a non-performance way. Both phones are great though and I can tell iOS is nearly neck and neck with Android as far as features, where as it used to always be Android several steps ahead.
This is why Google should discontinue android os because they are so useless. Just force us all to use Apple products
Been waiting for this!! Looking to maybe move from android to iOS
does anyone care about phones, seriously? there has not been any major innovation for a loooooooooong time, its more or less all the same but with minor upgrade tweaks
Actually better phone is the best deal you get on , said to me by a wise man before. The only problem I had with this is that the switch between ios to android is a bitch
lovely as usual
Apples down fall for me is the software, Android wins hands down that's why I switched and have never looked back.
Love both of your channels👌👌
Iphone is one company and android is a world of many many phones I think it wasn't a good idea to compare a phone with a lot others
I still can't use an IPhone, it irritates me
androids actually have higher battery capacity, its just iphones are much more efficient with its battery life, only reason it may last longer, but!!! after a year or two of using it, have fun with your battery being absolute junk and dying incredibly fast on iphones. androids have like 4700mAh by default while iphones barely got 3000mAh. It does come down to your preference though, i'd say samsung is better.
Nice try, but my choice is: I pay for a Samsung phone, but I don't want an Apple for free!
I didn’t like how iPhone was winning
MKBHD just loves iphone, no constructive criticism. It was down to preference not  experience.
umm you guys should try Sam vs IPhone
When are we getting the final verdict on the S22 Ultra?
Lol Marques kept referring to certain features on android are only used by "some" or a "small portion of the population" etc, and I will say that for the most part, the majority of ppl who choose android including myself are fully into that kind of thing. There's so many options and the best of all is having the freedom to choose. So I will stick with my android despite all its shortcomings.
Iphone Over priced phone simple
Uhmmmm really I think it's was a bit partial in judgement, it's was basically personal cus I think both of you uses iphone mostly and I guess you spend lest time using Android,maybe that why I don't really give the best elaboration on it. I couldn't finish the video cus I already knew how it's will end after going half. Buh I think unlike last year..ur judgement on gadget looks a bit shaky and not really feeling that edge to crave for ur videos. Seems partially or one sided. This are my personal thought.
Two legends❤
All the iPhone haters comin in hot. Gotta love it. They hate us, cause they ain’t us.
Marques was definitely going for a fist bump at the end 😂
Come on android phone is also a samsung phone so how on earth is it 2,5 and 7,5 for iphone? We can see that both of you are apple iphone fanboys
I absolutely love this Collaboration hope you guys do this more often awesome vid!
It was awesome to see the two of them in the same room.
S22 bruh
So there are 2 big different problems on both side.  Apple - overpriced and very limited software 🥹 Android - 2022, there are 13 years of development and camera still lags in 3rd party programs like instagram, snapchat, TikTok etc. This is just inadmissible with so powerful hardware 😂...
I had an IPhone, I will never go back.  Samsung phones are better.  Don't know what you guys are smoking.
Even if by some miracle Apple were to have the best of the best of the best of hardware, their interface is still total GARBAGE and their autocorrect is so intrusive and hard to deal with.  I have seen iphones change words in a previous sentence while a message is sending.  That should NEVER be allowed for any reason, but it happens very frequently.  I don't particularly care of some of the features of the newest Android, but it is still 1000 times better than iOS in my opinion.  Bring back physical keyboards, stay with USB C, and DON'T TAKE AWAY MY EARPHONE JACK, and there's no way Android can ever lose!
Sometimes when my iPhone crashes and I reopen, the battery is shown higher for a certain amount and then goes back to the original amount of battery
Sorry, but I almost completely disagree. The only points I would give to the Iphone would be videos, performance and software updates. For photos the S22 ultra obviously is better in so many ways. Also the screen is brighter and sharper, which are by far the two most important things a screen should do. So why not give the screen point completely to the S22 ultra, especially with the disgusting notch on the Iphone. In terms if features and customizability IOS does not even close. Ever heard of things like custom lunchers and even custom roms? Android phones are not in any form limited to what the manufacturers software is having. Wow there are things like facetime to get me in their eco system. I would never use such things that are not completely open to every system my friends have. Lastly the fact that you not even have USB-C on Iphones is so dumb, because it is already the absoloute standard for a long time.
IOS VS ANDROID*
I think it seems like you are both iPhone fanboys... Hhhhhhh
Did iPhone pay you MrWhoseTheboss?  Because of the things you guys discussed we can only hear these from iPhone fanboys.  You guys did not mention the phones that we can get for 200$ with a 120hz screen and a fairly good camera. You guys did not mention that we get a 60w charger with a 300$ phone. Anyway, This video was biased. I still have tons of things that I can throw which makes android phones better.
Quick share and music share on samsung
I kept hearing Battery from the UK and Baddery from the US
I read a lot of novels and the occasional manga, and on iphone i can't sideload the apps that allow me to do that conveniently like tachiyomi/ranobe.. Combine that with apples unethical business practices and i just can't bring myself to buy an iphone.. Something about the idea that i'm not allowed to do things with the phone i bought without apples consent doesn't sit right with me...
iPhone is reliable and long lasting. That is a strong strong point.
Speaking about eco-friendly without mentioning repairability is a crime
Foldable phone.
I agree this was a good video
2 Apple fanboys roasting android world 💁🏽‍♂️
This video never came up in my subscription feed for some reason
Like airdrop samsung have quick share.  USB c and many more things you didn't talk about them
I knew this was going to be super biased in iphones favor when they gave it a tie with the screens smh. the s22 ultra is not even comparable to the iPhone what am I missing here 🤣
Can't agree with this numbers. Apple is like using a elementary phone for social media.
Could have been a Q&A with mkbhd on why he is an iPhone-User. No nuances just all plain personal preferences. Not much informational value, but at least entertaining as always.
Android: You could install any application from anywhere without having to jailbreak!
This test does not make sense. Iphone being just one phone line, but android is a plethora of companies manufacturing phone models like mint leaves
Deal breaker for me is  apple lacks so many apps I can get on Android
Great video.........but I'm a bit confused by the lopsided score. I have a Pixel 6 Pro and and an iPhone 13 Pro.  I love both phones....but there are definitely differences between the two. The iPhone's screen isn't better, still photography isn't better, customization isn't better (and won't be better when the lock screen can be customized - it will only be better at customization of the lock screen...not the whole phone). Android deserves more love.
Rectangle phones look awesome!!!
Yay
A phone that i can see the screen outside would be awesome
This round for me is for Android phones. Just my opinion. For me, android phones provide more choices and at the same time, more open for customizations and also, cheaper! Just my opinion anyway ✌️
Fandroid Cry Babies
I agree that overall iPhones are better there work well in more scenarios. I used an Android device and iPhone and the iPhone is way more reliable. I can trust the android when I need to go and get something down that is very important.
I feel like this is kind of a weird comparison, imo it should just be a comparison between android vs ios in terms of software, or an individual android phone vs iphone in terms of hardware. Like MKBHD said no phones are perfect and its really weird just picking bits and pieces from various android phones just to compare to an iphone. Bits and pieces from various phones dont really represent an "Android" phone as a whole.
People without the budget to get an iPhone: Yes ,iPhone is better
choose iPhone
It's cool that although they both agree iPhone are better devices, MKs choice to go Android shows that both ecos have offerings for either consumer and it really just boil down to trying it out making your own informed decision
Androiiid!
Two apple fanboys sit and compare apple products to other stuff. Hm, not a fair trial your honor. Just because you read a lot of tech blogs and then review phones does not mean that you know what that phone is good for if you only have an iphone as your personal phone. iphone and anything "i" is an environment designed like a prison of the tyrannical regime that has you by your balls. Thanks but no thanks.
2 of my favorite tech youtubers just talking tech, i love it
You wait a very long time to see a new video of arun or marques and suddenly they show up in a single one 😍
Wanna watch two guys who really know what they're talking about when it comes to phones sit and talk about phones?
for freedom flexibility I would go with android… there are just a lot of apps on the android that I use that I didn’t find on apple. Also I use an ipad but still use google keep
Good compare but for me I'll choose the cheapest one, bc you cant use your phone as computer and my work is to use computer, so the phone is just the extra and the cheap one can do almost as same as the expensive one in my opinion
It doesn't matter.
Appl fan this is why iPhone wan look to his hand his waring apple watch
Im not sure but I think a fake account is impersonating you for scams.... The account replied to my last comment
فيصل السيف يقول غير كلامكم من ناحية المقارنات والنتائج!
Shitdroid mudded🤮💩🤣🤣
I love customization, everyone likes customization... Android is better.
Jeeeez, some pressed people in these comments.
is iPhone the green side or the blue side?
Why is MKBHD looking at MWTB as though he gonna give him a surprise hug out of the blue
at the end, it's still user preferences, nothing is superior to others...
I switched to IPhone after using Android from its beginnings. The features that I dearly miss are Alpha Numeric Dialing and Clipboard for copy paste items, calculator and alarm clock app. Split screen to use youtube and google maps at the same time.
iPhone sucks chunks. Android wins for people who don't just want to talk to their grandma on the phone.
ifan discuss whether iphone or android is better
As an app developer, having both android and iOS test phones has been very convenient in every way
I have best of both, I love both  Android is utilised by 5000 different companies and IOS used by just one Not a fair comparison
An iPhone is just a glorified iPod touch
Marques face wanting to go for a fist bump at the end was so painful
To be honest there’s a lot of bias in this.A lot of these things are down to personal preferences
Nice video Mr Gando
Haha Apple employee on the left 🤣
I believe the main difference between both ecosystems is control. In Apple devices, although some of their features are miles ahead of Android with their garden-walled ecosystem, those features often take away control from the users. It lures them into the Apple ecosystem which in many cases can drain their wallets, and those features make it hard to get out of the ecosystem. When I hold an iPhone, I lack the feeling that the phone is mine. Sure, you can stop other apps from tracking your data and having control of your data, but in some aspects, it can simply be perception. What is stopping Apple from tracking your data? The end-user has given away a lot of information to Apple, often more than to other companies due to the controlled perception, but you will never fully know if Apple is tracking your data. Sure, you know that Google & Facebook is taking data from you which can make you more cautious, but you don't know if Apple is, and many users think that Apple doesn't take any data. The reason why the iPhone has all these features and can heavily optimize the select devices that they have is that they have control over what you do, while Android gives you more options like sideloading.
they may not be biased but how the video is structured is 100% biased
My own opinion is that iPhone wins and is better than android I also love that it has dictation and voiceover for people that need it Apple has considered a boat the people that need other features such as voiceover and they even have a whole spot in the settings app titled accessibility I love Apple because they think about other people.
ادو لهم حق القات  Apple deposit money to their account
I think comparing Android with iPhone is ridiculous. It's like you comparing gas with BMW car! An OS vs a phone.
Baist
Always great seeing this collab. Top 2 tech content creators on the planet🔥
Generally agree.  The iPhone just gives you a better just experience.  My Samsung takes better photos but I generally use my iPhone. Why? Because opening the camera app and snapping a shot is much more consistent and reliable on an iPhone. You never know when the Samsung is going to randomly lag and miss the shot. S22U and iPhone 13 Pro Max user.
Not objective at all.
Bro this video is going down. im pretty sure you will receive so much hate for it. 2.5 vs 7.5 score was not acceptable. you should have given more points to android TBH but you dint! You can't even move the icons on the iPhone and gave it a draw in the customization category!!
Apple is always talking about how they're gonna be carbon neutral until 2030. Meanwhile Google is already Carbon Neutral since 2007 😂
My s10+ did last me way longer that my current iPhone 13 pro. It’s bonkers to me that people call this phone long lasting. Can’t wait to get rid of it and go back to Samsung,having iPhone is so boring
Nokia is better
This should have been OS vs OS.
There is no iphone that can beat the galaxy note with built in s pen  End of story.
Hold a minute... iPhone battery life sucks. I'm wife and her sister both have old basic Samsung A70 and that phone beats iPhones by an entire day.  My stupid Samsung S20Fe also beats the battery of the latest iPhone.
mkbhd on all black, whosetheboss on all white..... coincidence, I think not..
Great colab and I really liked the video! However there is one thing I gotta say. During the eco conscious category one thing you skipped over was repairability. That is arguably the most important part of an eco phone and android is a clear winner there with apple doing things like software locking parts etc.
Wow, mkbhd doesn't sound like a tech guy in this video at all. Definately Not the best takes !
Iphone is late.......is that not called copying things......every feature copied from Android.........can you install any software in an iPhone outside of app store? .....no never............the first and only customisation feature introduced by iPhone till date is the latest lockscreen one........do I need to tell the customisation level Android provides since last decade..........for these reasons I miss the dislike button.......
These are the type of events I like to see!
i have been iphone user for long time. Most of things Iphone do it better. But i like some features of iphone and some of android. Stock android would be my choice if i have to choose android.
I know Iphone won it here but I have both phones and I always use Android more and Android will always win for me
Airdrop is absolutely vital for me personally
Hi
Cool video,buy its not fair to compare an open source OS to one company's phones. Samsung vs Apple is way more important,as all other Androids are dodgy.
Apple has a horrible anti consumer and anti repair stance and still gets the eco friendly point? Yeah, nah.
Typical Iphone bias
I will get my first phone soon
Mkbhd is an apple fan so yh your opinion wasn't even taken just his   Lame
many features of iPhone are what they copied from Android, no originality!
lol bs review
7.5 vs 2.5, I think that is a little extreme
This is biased - You guys favored IOS, Siri to Google Assistance - features on both OS, Camera better looking, all should go to android. Only category Iphone should win is the video category - Both of you are yet to tell us how much apple pays you annually.
Two goats of tech youtube
Rubbish!!! What is this??? An apple fan boy invited to convincing  people indirectly  join the apple bandwagon of locking you in!!! While the android guy dosent even challenge the perspectives with facts!!!WORST VIDEO ON THE CHANNEL BY FAR!!!!
This comparison is flawed. Mkbhd has always been an apple fan so I don't expect him to be fair. I use 13 pro and also 21 Ultra. Android beats iphone in most key functionality.
Accessibility is a huge factor, Apple has always been ahead when it comes to insuring the devices to be accessible right off of the box for people who are disabled
Android phones as a whole shouldn't be generalized.
I don’t think this is helping a lot clarifying what the main differences are: I would say in android customizations, flow (back button/gestures/keyboard) and notifications are better and in iOS the privacy, 3th party apps and apple ecosystem are better. Those are the biggest things. Meanwhile camera/video/value etc. are all quite close.
I feel like android got a raw deal with the score. I use an iPhone for work and Android for personal use and enjoy using both - I was expecting it to be a closer battle.
Not a good video at all, the comparison is flawed all the way from the begining:  Samsung makes the iPhone's screens, Android has even foldables, higher refresh rate, higher pixel density, higher resolution, brighter screens, screens that interact with underneath cameras, let's call it a draw in Screen Comparison.  iPhone is locked to 12MP, no 960fps slow-mo, lower optical-zoom, not that many settings to customize, is not even no.1 on many cameras review sites, but I like that it opens faster, so iPhone wins in Camera Comparison.   iPhone is the most anti-repairs, reparing an iPhone being a simple user results in features being disabled, they still force its users to use lighting port, and it’s ONE of TWO products still using lighting, you can even use cables from different Android brands to charge your Android, you can Wireless Charge them using another Android no cables needed, but you CAN’T use your iPad Mini or Pro cable (only the 9th gen currently available in the site still uses lighting, the other 2 iPad models use USB-C) or your Mac cable to charge your iPhone, iPhone wins in Eco-Friendliness.    iPhone lacks a ton of features that even cheap Android have (Under screen fingerprint scanner, expandable storage, AUX Port, IR Sensor and that’s just a few Hardware side, Software side is even larger the difference, Always On Display, Multi-Apps, side-loading apps, 3rd party and manufacturer apps that modify status bar, navigation bar, gestures, system icons, themes, interactive home and lock screen wallpapers) let's call it a draw in Features Comparison.
This was great to watch. you to work great together. hope you had fun in crunch labs
Cache is a problem in Android phones plus their built-in apps require multiple updates and it sucks.
I bought an iPhone and return it the next day for one reason. Sideloading apps. Yeah you can side load apps on iPhone but they make u do those dam stupid survey. I even attempt to do the survey but it never picked it up. Using android now.
Gotta absolutely disagree with the environmental point, apple's right to repair policies are absolute dog sh!t, they make repairing anything so expensive it's worth just getting a new phone, which is what they obviously try to do all the time with every product they have. Apple is a greedy scummy pile of cr*p company when it comes to repairability and that affects the environment much more than any "20% recycled material" sticker. At this point in the video everything else I agree with although i'd've given the full point to android with the displays
Iphone fanboy...🤣🤣🤣
No mention of the Sony re camera? I’m surprised
I feel like Arun was constantly dying inside trying to defend android
Another thing with the environment is that iphones last longer than android phones. You can use them longer instead of having to buy another phone.
Folks, they actually say at the end that it really does come down to preference and what’s important. And iPhone was favored more by MKBHD, but MWTB clearly leaned more toward Android. I don’t think folks who are “disappointed” that Android didn’t score higher fare wrong either, but this whole exercise was their opinions (as are all reviewers) and they went over the parts most important to them. Digging in the weeds of USB-C versus Lightning (which is about to become moot based on the latest EU rulings) and open source (for all the people who care about open source, the average user doesn’t; hell, don’t even know what it is) and whatnot. At this point I’m a “do you” person when it comes to whichever phone you wish, but in this comparison it is what it is. I’m sure there are TONS of YouTubers who would pick Android, so no need for panties to get bunched.
Sponsored by apple guys
I havnt watched the video, but i can confidently say what these guys are going to say at the end🤭, " its your preference, personal choice, comfort blah blahblah" 🙏
What the f are you both using android then?
MKBHD being shocked for using a whole year old phone whiles I'm stuck with iphone 6 lol
mkbhd is like  he is being paid by apple
Black dude got a nice bag of money from apple lol
i love downloading from torrents, using game guardian, and installing custom roms so android is a win for me. my redmi note 10 pro is my baby
I choose android for a proper folder/files system
make a samsung vs iphone
The way you argued the iPhone to get draws when it clearly should have been android points was straight bias. How are we supposed to take your recommendations and opinions seriously with such heavy bias?
I prefer android to be honest...
Great collab! Now please get Mr. Mobile to complete the trinity.... I'd really love to have a tie breaker between the two of you.
What a great collaboration two of my favorite go to reviewers.
I had both phones in the past I am not really favouriting any of those brands, and i know it can be subjective but when you tell iPhone software wise is better... When iTunes is a hell you can not put a single file from outside environment on your iPhone ... So I am little bit surprised. Also you made several comparison videos on cameras and if i remember correct you even compared s21ultra with the new iPhone 13 pro max and still the result was that camera is better than in this video both of you say that iPhone is the better photo camera so sometimes you are not consistent with yourself :)
Arun when talking about cameras, you revealed exactly what it is about android phones that’s appealing.. it’s something new and unexpected, something that you can talk about, something that people generally wouldn’t know. Basically.. android phones are there for reviewers and for entertainment. Because you are “bored” and you need that something that will stop the boredom.   That’s actually the biggest problem of the developed world at the moment.. “entertain me!”
It's 2022, iphone being "more" reliable doesn't make sense. FaceTime,  imessage etc apple stuff .... only apple users obviously think theyre important easily replaceable by apps. So no. And lock screen on iphone looking better... 😂🤣😅   are you kidding me... design android has foldables and iphones are stuch to a notch and a build design from the past who knows how long. So no. Android features to you may be gimmicky but they have pushed technology forward. You think dex is just okay but it pushes phones to be more than just phones. Who knows in the future we would only have phones and a tablet as computers, now that's eco friendly. I respect your opinion but disappointed with this video and perspective.
*Sponsored by Apple*
i am not sure Aron knows how time works   I moved from uk to us, i was moving back 8h, which meant that i've actually had 24h 😂
Your in California! I live in California! I Maybe we're gonna meet IRL! Hope to see you!
Ngl I felt like the argument was biased towards the iPhone quite a bit.
This is some BS analysis.
The two tech/phone YouTubers that I watch. Terrific.  So, how did you two decide whose channel would get to show the video?  By the way, the micro SD card, with the 2,000-plus songs stored on my phone, is why I still have my Android (and have not upgraded to Samsung"s latest phones!).
So my iphone 5s just refuses to save the photos alot of the time
Display is a Draw!?!? How??
Basically summary:  You care about numbers on paper - android. You care about actual performance, reliability and longevity - iPhone.  I’ve recommended more android phones than iPhones, because I always ask what people care about, and generally it’s the price. Well… if you want a very cheap option that makes you think it works well, definitely poco, Xiaomi, realme. 😄 Samsungs are not in that realm. But if you want to buy a phone and forget that you “have to” upgrade - iPhone. Buying last year’s iPhones is the best strategy. They are half the price for an amazing phone that will outlast android phones in every front.
Android takes it idc what u all say
For me Andriod is a clear winner. Love My samsumg Note 10
Always have been someone who recommended Samsung over iPhone and would get really annoyed when people would be like "No use my camera, it's an iPhone"... I now have an S22 Ultra and having watched Arun for years, and valuing his opinion quite highly, especially when buying tech, now sorta makes me feel like my phone is not as great as I thought it was.  Great video though.
That's Why I Kept Android and Apple Both 🤭
Actually I can't agree with all this in my eyes android can give u everything if I were in their studio I could give an answer to any one of their statements
Like it or not, Android is far superior than ios in terms of prices, battery, camera, durability, customization.
I love android much more samsung but my s21 ultra hott 🔥 a lot
This was a promo for Iphones rt?
💙
Nice Iphone commercial  They didn't count Google assistant win vs Siri😂 Also I have a ROG phone the battery last two days.
I watched both of you guys always great content but this one I'm going to have to pass because android points should be way more higher....
Irrelevant to the conversation, but Arun is looking like a snack in this video. That’s all!
Paid video 😂
I'm Laughing at these two while using my Xiaomi Mi 12 ultra demo😂. Don't ask how i got it. It's a beast
Software support and features are a win for Android. Iphone has share play and better sound latency, that's it. Photos organization, file management, file sharing and freedom to install apps are where Android wins! (Airdrop is nearby share, FaceTime is Duo so these are not really iphone features). Software support, a phone with Android 10 can do everything ios16 can. Even better, old Android phones can run modern apps unlike iphones where you get locked out.
These are basically the reasons I just gave up on Android and went back to iPhone. Apple ecosystem is unparalleled.
damn marques is so biased
It was not fair ......android is the clear win !! In almost points 😡😡 It was like supporting iphone for every reason !!☹️ keep it up for iphone....and some guys will say I'm hating iphone that's y im saying this but I also love iphone it doesn't mean that to support  every reason  to iphone !! It was not fair at all 😟☹️☹️!!!
Sorry guys. 2 icons for smart phone reviews and you guys failed.... iOS against android??? Ok go. Apple against everyone else. That's doesn't make sense..
Woooo an iPhone biased guy, vs a Android biased guy.
Marques gave the higher numbers to the iPhone as it’s a better option for most people. Yet he rocks an 18 month old S21 Ultra as his personal phone because that’s the phone ‘he’ likes the most right now, regardless of how highly he praises the iPhone.
Iphone lover how mutch are they paying him?
3:18 Multi window is a life saver when ur in a foreign country and have to translate everything, while using some other app. That's why i am into android.
You’re comparing the iPhone to every other phone optimizing for maybe a few things.
Nice biased shit.
This is 2022 do like do I have both geeesh .......
This feels like a paid sponsorship by Apple. Or MKBHD is now a fan boy. The way all the Apple features are some how justified or argued further to get a result. 🤔 IMO iOS is the most backwards OS to use from a business workflow point of view. Write an email and attach a PDF.. Oh sorry, go find the pdf and share it to email then write your email. Who does that?
This test was so bias they found so many excuses to give iphones a win when it came to arguments it's insane lmao
Bro, Android feels like that one sports team you love but has had a downfall
Regardless if you like Android or Apple, can we all just take a moment to appreciate the fact that he literally edited a small dent in the word dent at 1:48 Like seriously the attention to detail is insane
Yoooooooo 1M views in 9 hours wait whaaaaaat....😳😳
Harsh on Samsung
You team apple 🍎 or team Samsung 👾? 🤔
12:24 I thought of IOS in terms of Optimisations
This was hard to watch.
The ending hand shake 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
I was a big fan of this channel from a long time but after watching this video I'm very very disappointed, not because i support android but they clearly were unfair to android. UNSUBSCRIBED
Can you do a video about the possible z fold 4 including concepts seen online including the samsung fold mini and what you think we will actually get ???
Android>Isheep
I have a tie between photography of iOS and Android, if you take Samsung s22 Ultra you can literally take a zoom photo of moon clearly but if you take iPhone it can only do a 10x zoom but if you take a portrait with an iPhone it will be pretty cool then Android
More Collab needed in future.
Android. Simple open format. I have a fire stick set up on my phone and can watch all the movies and PPV fights. You guys are baised because you're Iphone lovers. I've had both and loved both but Android is way more powerful when it comes to app, camera and video. I have proved over and over in the club when I take pictures vs my friends iphone 13 my S21 kills it. So no iPhone can not mess with Galaxy or android system.
Best collab ever! Great review guys!
That was cool and all, but Android also includes phones that fold -- Apple has nothing in that category, period. Also no mention of things like the S-Pen, which is very important to the power users that take advantage of stuff like that. You could argue its a smaller set of users, but you could also argue many people have older and non-premium iPhones that have so-so screens and cameras. Also pretty nuts that Android didn't win the screen category outright (folding screens, screens with in-display fingerprint sensors, etc), but I guess...?  Both at this point are great platforms that can do all sorts of things, really comes down to preference.
Comparing a bunch of phones with only one offers the final result without keeping the score. As an iPhone user I never asked for an USB-C. Never regretted that I don’t have one. From mechanical point of view, I will always prefer lightning. Eh…no one cares! Enjoy your phone and let people alone to buy what THEY want with THEIR money.
I could handle a whole podcast of you two talking for about 2 hours.
Mrwhostheboss and MKBHD in the same video - today was a good day  My two favourite tech youtubers ❤️
This is something we can all agree on: Neither is better both are phones
This is the most straightes collab i ever seen HAHAHAHAHA
I still prefer Android, i have the A71 5G. I like the customization and FaceTime is just a video chat i could do on many messengers
You missed one very obvious difference. Apps. I was an Android user until the iPhone 13 came out. I was shocked and extremely disappointed once I began searching for third-party apps  It is an agonizing task because 90% of the apps that come up require a MONTHLY fee FOREVER to use them. I never saw that with Android.
the good thing about android u got all kinds of emulators you can run and game apps like cloud streaming apps, reminds me of windows vs mac where u just don't get access to as many games on apple...and then the rest of the phone specs and features are really neck and neck or close enough to just choose android/essentially up for preference, even if iphone may win here in this video...for example id take the latest samsung or sony xperia get a sick 4k screen and stream some geforce now, xcloud, stadia, and then mess with some emulators like the ps2 and nintendo emulators as well as download none app store apps/apk files to pretty much accomplish anything i want and I'm set, while iphone seems too locked and secured/not as open source and customizable, harder to root pirate or whatever u call it...it's like getting a steam deck vs a switch
marques: apple screen is A+ arun: i feel like samsung screen is different league tho @mkbhd: "it is"  bruh cmon man toss the cushy apple loves you life and just say its A- compared to market
How was MKBHD like on Apple side even though he uses a Samsung  I believe he uses a s21 Ultra something like that   Great collab btw love to see more
You know I think I'm pretty happy with my Motorola   g stylus 5g
Marques is Mr Apple... This is not a fair comparison
Iphone won.... wow...
Apple shills
Android = garbage, simply put
Well that was a pile of murica poop
Was the White Vs Black planned?
Wow two of the biggest apple paid shills got together to shill iPhone 🤮. Sometimes I wonder why COVID haven't taken these 🤡 s . These cold blooded liars need to be de-platformed  or be sent to Ukraine to fight for money. Not take Apple's money and vomit bs.  Unlike these 🤡, I am a real phone/smartphone enthusiast and I can tell you with 100% fact that below are the Truth. Best OS - iOS Best solo speaker- iPhone Best battery life - iPhone Best battery longevity - Sony Best screen - Samsung Absolute best high tech screen - Sony Best Still Camera - Sony/Vivo  Best Video recording - Sony (iPhone was king until videopro with 4k120 fps came to Sony phones) Best Stereo speakers- Sony Best Audio through wired headphones - LG Best for work productivity - Samsung. Best budget builds - Motorola/Nokia/Poco
I'm very irritated the first point was called a draw, like BS Samsung screens are clearly superior
sorry a great vid but it is not YOUR format but love it tho
What a fun interview! Well done 👍 !
So another video comparing os and ios yet no use of the best android phones which are gaming ones.... why compare if only mainline super expensive ones are compared not lowerer priced higher powered ones like red magic thats superior to samsung and apple
Isn't it weird how they never mentioned the oh so quickly growing market of FOLDABLES? Where is your praise now? And yes, Apple waits for others to make something and then make it better, but that's because they attack new, already established markets. Thats because they're scared to innovate.  AND just so you know, we on android have our own version of airdrop, thank you very much. And did you know that facetime isn't the only way to videochat🤯
if you wanna know how big apple is, Its always apple vs the rest of the world of smartphones
Wow 2022 is a strange time. Imagine the iPhone wins in battery life category 😂
i have both and iOS is more stable than android. However,I bought my galaxy note jsut because of the stylus and the flexibility of android. Now iOS is becoming more customisable and more fun. I feel that Android is not trying hard to make new updates or add new features to keep up agaisn't Apple.
I like Android more because my experience with iOS back to the time I had the iPhone 6 left me with more frustrations than satisfactions, but I do see iOS as more Premium than any Android flagships. From aesthetics, to fluidity and apps, iOS just feel more refine from what I see.  On the other hand, my experience with Samsung, gives me more flexibility and the experience with OneUI is top notch. I do use the edge panel and split screen for the convenience to access to the apps I use the most without going back to the homescreen and I do use split screen for example one window to watch YouTube, another window to do something else.   I prefer OneUI because it has an identity whereas Xiaomi Vivo Oppo Huawei etc they just all look the same.  Pixel 6 did caught my attention though.  Some Android apps and more particularly Twitter App are just abysmal, and also if you use third party apps for videos, such as Filmic Pro, the features are limited on Android whereas with iOS, everything works flawlessly.  No matter how I prefer Android, iOS still has a lots of good reasons to be the one a good portion of the people would go for if they could afford either of these flagships smartphones. iPhones just feel more premium and reliable, no matter how better Android flagships are in terms of features or whatever.  It was a great interview! Whether we agree or disagree, it was honest. Like it 🤘
It still amazes me how we have gotten so far off the beaten path over a "phone". Primary function: Communication. Call, text/sms, emails. If it handles those without issue then the phone is fulfilling it's purpose. Second is durability and battery life. At this point the iPhone blows away anything Android has. The overall performance, function and longevity with iPhones is what "value" truly is. The fact that vanity has played such a major role the past few years is bewildering to say the least. That is the least important aspect of any product, yet it has such a major impact as of late. Most intelligent people will put a CASE on their investment to protect it. Paying $1000 + for a phone would be silly not to. That would be like driving a 100K M-Benz and not having insurance on it. Android is good for the vanity crowd. But true value, functions and durability goes to the iPhone.
This was the collab we needed 👏🏽  I feel like when you have an iPhone, it’s very hard to move over to Android (not that I’d want to, but I can see why some people would)
I like the collab vids !! Right on !! 😎🤩👊🏽
it's very clear this is very biased in opinions
This is a bad video Arun. Totally inconsistent between categories. Comparing flagship to flagship when it benefits Apple, comparing average to average when it benefits Apple. You also just agreed with MKBHD, the apple fanboy, for every category that should clearly be won by android. Where's your backbone?
Sorry had to dislike the video.  Not a fair comparison
I'm begining to think you were coecered to give Ios more points.
Apples suck
This is just mainly personal pref. Technically and user experiencey iPhone might take the lead, but I will take customization and personalization over restrictions and rigidity any day of the week. And photo and video? I have taken a lot of stellar photos and videos with my Note 4 and after 3.5 years with the Note 9 still (although I liked the photos on the 4 slightly better). Way, waaaay better than my wife's iPhone.
Honestly, at this point we're all pretty well locked in through value-add features. If you're on IOS and you've invested money into the apps and have a apple watch, an iPad, subbed to one of Apple's services, etc., you're not going to be a candidate for switching up for the most part (there are always edge cases of course). Same goes for Android, especially if you're going the Samsung route and you've picked up their watch and bought into their services, it's doubtful you're looking to move on.   Both OS's are very mature at this point, so it really comes down to what ecosystem you're already invested in.
Really wish you’d use chapters in your videos
Comparison is not fair in lot of ways !
Has anyone else noticed the Dent in the Dent?
14 minutes in... thee worst video youve ever made... nothing learned... no new info
Unpopular Opinion: The notch on iPhone’s is just iconic. Without it, it’s just another smart phone. With it, it’s an iPhonep
Everyone: Wow, nice comparison Me: MKBHD’S Veins 😱
MBKHD sounds like an Apple fanboy, he gave every category the edge to Iphone...
Oh please lose the apple  biases.

Yea 2 iphone users are talking about which one is better 🤔
Hmm cameras are incomparably better on some of the android flagships, even in plain and simple auto mode, USB-C is huge win for Android. Productivity is also no contest win for Android. Screens are also mostly better on today's Android flagships, be it 240 Hz monster from Sharp, or 4K accurate color Sony, or just directly better version of iPhones screen on Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, etc. Charging, especially 60-150W ones kind of make battery draw imo, but lets say thats subjective.   Idk not saying iPhone is bad, but for the most parts I'd pick at least 5 Android phones over it, some of which are quite more expensive (like say Sony's Pro-I of 1800$).
My score board would be very different, also Imessages is an unstable mess
Sorry  You're not a hard-core mobile user if you don't use multiscreen.
Lmao iphone battery life is and always will be trash. I work in a place you can't charge your phone for 8-12 hours but you can usually use it quite a bit and alllllll of the dudes who have the 12 or 13 maxs are worried if they don't have a charger near them halfway through our day. My s21 ultra can be at 40%ish and I can use it all day and still go home with it alive. It's also faster than any iphone we have tested it against at work with all the specs like resolution and fps etc. Cranked up Loading videos, websites or anything else my s21 ultra is far ahead in loading full res everything. I knew this was going to be biased so everyone didn't roast these two about hating on apple lmao. Not even gonna get into the camera and video quality for trying to catch things(fighter jets) moving and or farther away lol. But after everything I think will come down to preferences of os and if you want to have the apple name in your pocket
I feel strong bias towards one company
Sad moment as a Samsung phone user: I agreed with 99% of this - BUT for the average user it's kinda here or there type deal - I have the Samsung Ultra note 20, and have NOT NEEDED to upgrade - I have only run out of space ONCe because of video taking when I did that a lot ... and Iphone's compatibility with apple devices is EASIER to a point but air drop does annoy the hell out of me in it's lack of security lol
Apple winning halfway through the video😂
If value goes to Android, than that is the most important category, because Apple supposedly wins on little features, but you get more for what you pay for with Android. Plus there was no contest for durability, and water proof, which Android could win on many phones. I feel the comparison was very biased.
Well, I usually don't comment many videos, and it will even seem that I'm commenting more on what I absorbed from the video than the content of it, but here goes:  I thought the video was clearly led by MKBHD, and I know that in the US the iphone is much stronger than Android, I saw Aeron trying to argue his ideas, but clearly being influenced by Marques, we have to see this from where both are inserted, Marques is in the US and Aeron in the UK, and you may think that this does not influence technology and the way we insert ourselves into it, but everything influences, and as Aeron is a less confident person than Marques clearly , have to do with their personalities, Mr is more restrained perhaps because of his past and having suffered from bullying he is a more influential person. Mk is the typical born sportsman, and he took care of the collaboration in this video, it's a little ironic but it looks like politics, the US and the UK are the best friends but the US always has the last word in the conversation.  I follow both giants on Youtube, but if I had to choose a channel I would follow Mrwhosetheboss more.  In short, as a European, I feel a greater connection to android, on the other side of the lake, well things are much stronger for Apple, I have always preferred the freedom that Android gives me, and although both systems are closer to the that we here in Europe have never been inundated by iphones recently, I continue to prefer Android in many things, perhaps because I have never been deceived by the dependency on iOS, which means that I don't need the strengths identified in this video so much, and I know that someone like MK depends a lot on the Apple ecosystem for their way of being, MacOS, iOS, etc, sorry but this all influences your decision in the video.  This is my way of trying to help the disadvantage we took in the iOS vs Android evaluation.
So if you're elderly/non-tech inclined, iPhone. If you're young/average tech inclined and don't want to spend lots of money on a phone.. Android.
Samsung are way better than iPhone in battery life and I've had both iPhone and Samsung and I also think the person who votes iPhone the most was just a iPhone fan .
That was a pretty biased comparison!! You can tell from your comments, if the feature exists & great on Android but you don't use it so it's useless and no points for that, WHY?!
I bought both s22 ultra and 13 pro so problem solved 😁😉
I think the talk here is a little bit biased. The scoring does not even make sense in real world usage. 2.5 to 7? That's a clearly unfair to what android can do that iphone can't. Not to mention "innovation" for the past few years android innovate a lot more than iphone. When you talk about performance you have to consider the features that samsung is running compare to iphone. Yeah it's true 3gb of ram in an iphone feels like 8gb ram in an android because they don't run extra features. Android phones need more ram because they have more features. Iphone don't need it because they don't have that much feature. So i don't agree with this 2.5 is to 7 score. Not a hater for iphone it's just clearly biased score. Also i think if sir Flossy carter (Samsung Knights) is here he would definitely roast iphone for some reasons. Although i love both of these reviewers but i think they are both on apple side.
I enjoyed it
It's still not comparable, the winner _technically_ was better and it got a ton more points. No matter what, I will still use Android, not because it's objectively better, but because I am hung up on one or two things that Apple will never compromise on. I wish I could use iPhone because of its power and its battery and stuff, but I need those spicific things.
I'm sorry guys but this is laughable...
So sad that personal preferences come in play every time android should have gotten the point and the point goes to the iPhone.
When we needed them most they collabed...
When we needed heroes they sent MrWhosetheBoss and Marques. Splendid
Two peoples that had the viewers dreams job! Had the latest gadget on their hands, do the job what they love and had plenty of money of course😁
If only iphones had a decent screen-to-body ratio and no notch, I'd consider it. That and a micro SD slot but I know that ain't happening
All bias
There is only one answer.. Android.. and not because of any fanboyism.. But because Android has not totally locked down the ecosystem like Apple has. You can run custom roms, custom apks, 3rd party applications, 3rd party app stores.. Your device is more "yours"... Google doesn't really make it all.. "that" easy... But its nothing compared to the prison that is Apple's iOS. Show me some custom roms of iOS where community found flaws or wanted additional features so they made their own port and included it themselves, upon their own authority, as the device owner... Not a single one. Apple would send out the lawyers, they'd disable and destroy your device remotely, they say it was for your own good, but you're simply too stupid to be permitted to do what you want with your own personal handheld computer.
Honda or Toyota? Chevy or Ford?  People who love iPhones, love iPhones. Case in point: The Notch. So much of it's personal preference. Personally I'll wait for Nothing.
Wen it comes to android features,(dey don't need it) iPhone features (very important)....super biased
I used galaxy s2, s4, droid maxx, nexus 6p, pixel 1, 2, 3. and finally switched to iPhone 13 pro max last year. android was cheaper flexible option but now Samsung phones costing more than iphones which is ridiculous. 3 4 years of good battery life and buttery smooth OS or overpriced junk that becomes trash in a year? ill go with iPhone.
ANDROID, WITHOUT DOUBT.  As far as You Tubers go, Neither of these two. FLOSSY CARTER IS SUPERIOR TO 'BOTH' OF THESE EGOCENTRICS, HANDS DOWN AND EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR 😊.
2022 and people are still fighting over both OS. Just use whichever you want. You do you. Jeez
Idk but this video looks boring. No energy in both of you
Lol, love the second point. 😄 all the “iPhone sucks because it has half the ram” and “yea, but android has splitview, if you wanna use it”. Okay, .. and do you ever? Well.. no 😄  What a better way to show that android only is better on paper.
That was awkward when they shook hands at the end and Marques placed his fingers to shake properly and Aaron just pulled his hand back 🤦🏻‍♂️ crazy how different cultures work
Mrwhosetheboss trying to manipulate apple fans in camera
I think the problem is android is is very big spectrum to compare to just apple products
This collab from my 2 favorite tech experts. Let's go!
this was a brilliant video, thanks man
Samsung 💯💯💯💯
Suave and annoying join forces
Coolest nerds in the world 😁👍👌
This review doesn't change my mind how iPhones still suck 😂, Samsung is still a better brand.
This was asking one person what he thought gave him the better experience at the same time he's been using the same Android phone for over 18 months... Kinda weird.  It was your video but your say didn't seem to matter as much. More tech YouTubers' input would have made the discussion more interesting. Thanks for making the effort just feels this was a little floored.
NOKIA USERS ACTUAL CHADS
No front but imho marques Argumentation was rly one sided and he overlooked some important things on the  android side but idk its just his opinion i guess so no hate
Marques just can't look passed his love for iPhone he's absolutely not objective in this video.
get some sleep marques
I use Xiaomi and my lady has a Iphone and best my best friend has the s22 ultra and both prefer my Xiaomi phone 🤷🏾‍♂️ to each their own
Just iOS
android or I is the OS-operating system NOT the apps or widgets on the phone or even the hardware IE camera...
great conversation
Does apple still not have being able to watch YouTube videos while looking at other apps...  I use that 99.999% of the time.   EVERY android phone allows YouTube video to play while using other apps..  I haven't seen that in iphone yet..  Hands down android wins!
Android is best obviously.  Why would you want to be restricted to crapples operating system with no sd card.
Great video guys! The value category I think is one of the toughest. I’ve switched from apple to android and back again. Yea you can skimp out on an android but that price drop comes with corners cut and the phone is fine when you buy it, but 6 months to a year later you want to chuck it at a wall. With that said, when you go iPhone se, you’re investing in a lot of fomo from the other apple people with standard or pro iPhones and even a lot of android users. I think there should be a question of value with the flagships. Especially since when you buy a really cheap phone you’re just trying to get it to do normal smart phone stuff like connect to Facebook and maps. When you’re dropping 1000 plus on a phone, the importance of price per feature goes up.
They are just too hard  advertise iPhone nothing else 🤣
This videos gonna blow up (if it already hasnt 😂)
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
The lighting sucked? Didn’t notice
Samsung Dex Matters!
the most important of all questions in this decade with wighting future is: which one I would choose in the long term if there is going to be an AI having all my data and define my world? for me,it's simply open Android phones...a company like apple that separates themselves from others and doesn't listen or do things that aren't user friendly or hate to admit copying or accepting from others isn't bad taste but rather enriching yours and money is so more important than loyalty of your customers and restrict you to believe the wall garden is for the good cause to you and you should like and believe them like a cult, i genuinely don't think such dictatorship or autocracy , even like the good ones in real life, is a good idea to wait and pave the path for and it's really frightening to let such manipulative company which boast about it's prestige but ignoring other aspects of a good company continue being in leadership for years to come.   if only apple would be more androidy or windowsy or linuxy , they would've all latest features and all major wins of other products and be the only main contender of the market in every category but they choose to stay limited on their narrow vision of what is iphone or .....
Work hard and be able to afford both. 🤷‍♂️. Both works in unique ways.
Anyone else notice that people with iphones always have cracks in the screens for some reason?
Great video
YOU CANT COMPARE SOFTWARE WITH HARDWARE
I think in case of customization no one can beat android but security and privacy still place in iphone . One should try both of them
Tie breaker should go to unbox therapy
Oh my I'm disappointed with the scores lol. I use both of these phones and I keep going back to Samsung. I love the style of the iPhone but the UX is ok. Iphone is missing a split screen, I use this all of the time and I don't want to download an app to do it. It's also missing the ability to play YouTube continuously as you multi task through through the phone.
Multiple SIMs, open file system, settings menu... And I just like the fact that I choose my phone by myself, not by the media or crowd. We live in the world of diversity in the end. I don't want future to look like an iPhone with limited colors options.
Bro before this video I got two ads one for Samsung and other for iPhone
This is beautiful 😍
Meeting of the greats 💯💯🥰
I unsubcribed to mkbhd because he's apple whipped, man said the most boring team is the best to watch, what???? . basically the best android cannot beat the best iphone. I'm out.
As an android main I can agree with this!
@mrwhosetheboss: i am a fan of your vids and your creativity, but would not agree on this vid. This should have been a Samsung vs iPhone comparison, rather than broadly using the term android. google pixel and other phones were used as a reference, but never discussed in detail.  the video is flawed and biased in so many ways: Pricing - Outside of US , the android range can start from $150-$1500. Everybody cannot afford an Iphone. Spare part pricing - high prices for iphones cable, repairs, apple care. Iphone was the first brand to remove chargers.. did they ever lower the price of the phone? Samsung followed the same lead. But there are so many android brands that still come with fast chargers. Yes it makes a difference.  Dual Sim /memory card support - Never provided in apple.  No Dual apps on iphone.  A person usually changes their phones in 3-4 years, so the software support is fine.  Icloud storage- Highly priced, default is 5 GB and if you have a google account, you get 15Gb as free storage.  Android are always the first ones to innovate and bring new features to the phone and after few years apple is proud to bring them to their phones. Android has more friendly user options on the phone.
I don't agree Samsung flagship phone has a much better camera Way more better options of pictures and varieties find yourself wishing you could get a good picture of zooming in. And the battery life is a lot better than pretty good. So really good battery and chargers faster and is US type c so all better. In the flies that they're bringing up is all Androids pretty much like yeah, Google's had a lot of buggy issues. Samsung  usually doesn't have much bugs.
Before I even watch the video, I’m assuming at the end they gonna say it’s all down to personal preference.  It's always that YouTubers diplomatic answer.
I don’t get why there isn’t a phone with full windows on it
No one did not speak about Sony camera. That's bad😞
Stand up!!! U said that u aren't gonna sit I'm your vids no more
Arun is just agreeing with Mkbhd meanwhile Mkbhd is a iPhone fan
Apple better be happy
I never once thought that I wanted iMessage, Facetime, or Airdrop. Android has versions of all of these and they work great!
Just by comparing iPhone with all the Android phone in the market.. iPhone seems to be a clear winner.
Nearby share on Android is a good equivalent to Airdrop
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Apple is better than Androit
I phone 13 vs all android phones 😂😂😂
I really couldn't care less for iPhone. it's a pleb phone for people who have fomo
The reason why this video doesn't make sense is because there are only a few current iPhones and tons of current Android based phones and so you can't really compare them at all. Also ios is a straight up deal breaker for me because I like Android just so much better and it doesn't even matter how good the iPhone hardware is because I think the software is just worse than Android.
I've always known, since he had 6,000 subscribers, that the marquis was never and never will be trusted. Even more a guy who sets himself up politically against his own nation, he might just be a brand supporter and not an actual evaluator. No surprises for me...
I haven't actually used a iPhone yet, but I have heard that you gotta be in their ecosystem to actually get benefits.  Macbooks/Mac-pc are great, you got me. but they are utterly nothing infront of a pc running linux/windows, with like a 3080 ti. Specially with linux, it isn't even a debate anymore.   I don't want to buy everything from a single brand, I like to have control over my choices. that is a major factor in my opinion, also something that makes apple always be a "second" choice in my eyes.  Android is basically a universal device, I can connect my Samsung device to my Sony smart TV with Google home, I can connect it to my custom built pc and do my shit. I can't do that with IPhone, thats very sad.   Price is another reason, I do most of my work on either my laptop or pc. My phone is basically something I only need when I am either out, or don't have access to any of my main devices. Iphone in my country, after taxes and things, costs over 2000$. I can get a great phone in 500-600$ in android that suits my needs, and overall does everything. Is it worth it? No.   Purely a subjective opinion, thank you!
Sry, but this video is just pretty much biased. There are so many more aspects for Android that didn't get a mention. I really love your videos, but this one sadly is very unprofessional 😞
so this review just confirms that Huawei would have never been able to surpass iPhones and the propaganda which they created saying the US was fearing china's technology is a lie.
I don't think the eco consciousness should've gone to iphone. If android can offer something like the fairphone and apple can't, then apple can't win. Because people that wanna be eco friendly don't want flagships, they want eco friendly.
find my iphone is a top one
Why are you averaging all android phones and only comparing them to the 13 pro max tho
I'm sorry but this video was clearly geared towards Apple being better. There was no discussion of security, compatibility, overall features, number of options, and also camera app features.
Interesting would have been good to compare the non pro iphone 13 that most of us use and can afford and even want for the size
What about Google Duo
You know this will determine which one is factually best. 😂 Convince me differently
I love how Arun, who's 100% iphone, actually goes hard for Android. And Marques, who uses more Android, goes hard for Apple.
It depends, they're both great options, the only bad side of iOS is price. I use android, had an iPhone before, and neither is really bad. Anyone who says one or the other is bad is a poser.
a lot of Apple fans just got even more  cocky about having an IPhone
🤔🤔🤔were u guy's favouring ios
idk for some reason mkbhd feels like bias espesially at the camera wtf the resoning oh man
Bruh,ain't no way MKBHD just said iPhone has better widgets 💀💀💀
The collab felt like its an Avengers Movie😁😁
I phone biased
How about the do not track option in iPhone.. is it just me who thinks it's a big deal?
Apple right now is like: Write that down! Write that down! (And then dont use any of it)
Why are they doingvandroid vs ios. Instead of Samsung vs. Apple?
THIS IS.. no.
I'm loving your content lately! I did enjoy your crazy fast over-the-top videos but these videos are so much easier to watch and I'm sure easier on you to make.
I actually really enjoyed the evening/cozy kind of feel the video had and the lighting definitely made that a lot better!
I'm sooo satisfied with my S22 Ultra that i see  those Apple bricks and i'm like nahh...
Can we talk about the awkward handshake at the end for a sec 😂
Are we going to forget that you can charge your earbuds and other phones with reverse charging. I feel like they overlooked all the strong features that Android phones have.
Camera king Vivo and Samsung ...  Ecosystem android... Batery king iPhone but fast charging chhange the scenes so I'll pick android
Samsung the best forever
We cannot simply transfer data from IOS to Laptop as we can do with android. SO, the winner is Android. as simple as that.
this collab was trash ngl; most of the comparisons are made with a biased view.  Apple is more like a kindergarten for rich peeps, where you dont have freedom.
I think the eco point should have gone to android just because of how strict Apple is about repairing by third parties
I get it's the internet but it's wild how many hate on one platform to argue for another. I see the arguments for iPhone but ultimately still prefer to use android. It's called an opinion.
iOS is way better in every way... But Android all the way 😏😏
MKBHD seems so biased with iphone.
Sorry this felt like Whose Boss quizzed Marcus for his opinion.
Yes comparing an iphone to a trash android phone is fair. Clickbait and you've lost a sub. Congrats.
MKBH really outlined some few point that I never thought about
and I forgot to say I can use iPhone why I can't Android doesn't matter
At this point I just own both lol
Where's Rick? Lol
Brownlee is really a very smart guy the way he analyses the whole options and calmly too
Even tho it’s based off you guys opinion, I feel android is a way better phone over all if you think about the average person with music app(free on android), watching movies(free on android), entertainment app(android) along with a long list of other things the android can provide. Keep in mind I was an Apple user and wouldn’t even think about getting an android until I tried an android.
I sure love to see Android get thrashed by two of the most well-respected YouTube techies. Some of you Android fans are absolutely insufferable.  I think there are only two types of Androids these days that are worth using. First, if you don't have a lot to spend, there are so many really good, inexpensive options available. And the other would be if you're really into experimental tech like foldables. I think those are the only two cases that make sense to check out Android.  Its a real shame to see Android phones shedding features over the years. First it was the removable battery, then the headphone jack, and now the card slot. These were things that set it apart from iPhone, minus the jack.  I do use an S22 Ultra, and it's very good, but as I said before, either a cheap phone or a foldable, if I'm to remain. So my next phone is the Fold 4, or I leave all together for the iPhone 14.
Didn’t know you guys were such an apple fanboys 👀
I just cannot agree with the camera comparison. The two biggest powerhouses in the Android space use a 50MP and 108MP sensor and I just find both are so much sharper in colour and focus. The shooting experience might be smoother on iPhone but I think the images always trump that.
I don't think the clip at the end was necessary, another class video and  great collab. Hope you're taking care of yourself brother ❤️
Which is better? The one you enjoy using. There. My work here is done.
at the beginning of the year i swapped from an oneplus 7t pro to an iphone 13 pro and i will never switch back to android its so much better
For me Android > iPhone Swap from iPhone to Android a long time ago and not going back to it!  I had tons of problems with the iPhone back then, software amd hardware. So yeah, when I switch to Android, it was definitive!
Jailbird vs freebird hmmmmm
hi guys but I think the guy from USA is Apple pay him because the screen the screen on Samsung is better overall everything is better jazz battery in iPhone is better I'm not saying iPhone is no good phone is very good and I like iPhone I'm not say iPhone is not good iPhone is camera everything good phone but Android Samsung overall is better phone even handle Samsung is better iPhone is too big or too big an iPhone looks like 5 years old does Guy get nice money from Apple overall everyone have his opinion but I'm so true I love iPhone I love Android and I say Samsung overall is better phone but now you can choice whatever you like my friend someone choice iPhone someone choice Android for me personally Android is better because you can do plenty things on iPhone you know can do so don't tell me iPhone is minion present better than Android you sold your soul two apple money can do everything today or you have some problem with your head screen is better on iPhone or camera come on a problem with your head mate
Huge fan of the Xiaomi Poco series (family) especially Poco X3 pro
Surprised that you did not mark the iPhone down for the home screen design.  Icons wrapping from the top instead off the bottom in the age of bigger phones and I’d deduct 2 sections for that gap between the dock and first icon row.
iPhone accessibility for those with disabilities is unparalleled. Voiceover, the use of refreshable Braille displays, ability to increase the font size to a very large typeface is sooo useful. Not only does it work for texting, iMessage , most of the apps I use, but ally for the RTTTTY access which I use daily. I am both legally blind and hard of hearing, though I speak fine. Many times tho I choose not to since usually people cannot hear what I’m saying. It prints the operator’s translations in the  TTY conversation window..  the closed captions are also able to be made quite large, as well which is also a great feature as well.  the irony for me is that many of us with disabilities have a very difficult time finding work and access to these devices is very expensive. I wish they had a program for those with disabilities that would allow for manageable payments since I’m sure they are aware of this. Anyway that’s my spiel on it. Awesome reviews guys
I have switched from Android to iOS about a year ago and it's all true like iOS is has less features and limitations but what it's have all are useful But Android have lot of features but you rarely do use some. So after longtime Android fan I become IOS fan now. And the ecosystem is 👑
I don’t agree with this output
20:08 mkbhd thought he was getting a fist bump! 😭 No worries, i gotchu! 🤛
A fun late night watch but to be honest it really felt like random categories thought up in the moment. Tossed ideas here and there with added personal opinions while letting the other person affect your own opinions. This should be done with more clinical way with better thought up categories. Not with "How do you feel about x and y. Nice opinion I go with that as well" -style if the title states literally "which is ACTUALLY better". More like thoughts about Androids and Iphones. Collabs are great but it shouldn't sacrifice effort and quality.
I still prefer Android over iPhone
I didn’t even know that android has lock screen widgets
i never used to watch 6min+ but this video has worth my time lol
Didn't we miss a few things? Speakers, mic, fingerprint sensor, haptics, repairability  Android ✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️ (now it's a draw 😉)
Americans and Britons again
I agree with almost everything, but there is no way iPhone display can match flagship Android phones display
Apple is more reliable. But Android. I miss playing with emulators with ease. But I’m a man. And straight up. I can watch anything on an iPhone and be fine 😂🤣😂
Ok.... iphone wins...ok.ok...i am a android user...and why I think it's better... You have a 600 dollar android with more specs then a 1200 dollar iphone
In truth there will never be a time that’s good to compare iPhone’s with Android phones. They are differing experiences deliberately.  Android is choice, openness and customisation whereas iOS is simple, stable (Generally speaking. Nothing’s perfect.), secure with a powerful ecosystem behind it. As an Apple device user in general, an iPhone is a no-brainer for me. At the same time, when I have used an Android device in the past the strength has always been to make that phone entirely me. Down to almost the smallest detail.   A person will either be an Android person or an iPhone person. It is about the individual. Both offer equally strong experiences depending on the person.  As a side note, I don’t find Siri to be terrible. As a means to get things done (control HomeKit devices would be the biggest one) it gets the job done. When it comes to general knowledge of course Google is gonna win cause it’s Google. That is no necessarily what a virtual assistant is for however and when it comes to actual usage very few people have a true need for them (outside of the use case I mentioned).
Lots of triggered Android users in these comments rn lol
Actually Android and iOS is just a Phone OS, nothing too special. It’s like a pair of a shoes but one is from Adidas and the other from Nike. It’s all preferences. So this all Android vs iOS fights on the internet is just legit stupid.
uh isnt the rog 5 android
Great video Guys 🤓
I like this collaborations.
can't believe these two will behave this dumb. shocked.
Why do I get a feeling that marquees is an apple fan?
I mean I have both platforms, but I think you guys are full of it. Some of those are clear android wins, like customizability, are you kidding?  😂
Arun taking a get well break from tech?
Y do I feel like u guys are actually looking for point to give he iPhone 🤔....
Me after agreeing to every single point that you guys said and planning what next Android phone that's gonna be my next phone, probably Honor magic 4 pro or Xiaomi 12 ultra. Let's see.
why did the music in that intro almost sound like such small hands by la dispute
This isn't a great comparison.  Android has so many players that you could really find an offering that meets or exceeds the iPhone.  One could also consider that the iPhone wins on simplicity/consistency alone.  It's really about preference.
If they give 10/10 to apple i still prefer Android
They are both cheating on Android These two people are iOS lovers
There is no doubt that these guys are being paid by Apple.
I remember the days Arun was an Android user. Apple must do something right if they get all Tech YouTubers onboard…
I would give a point in screen to android and another for USB port
Their both obviously iPhone fanboys. Idc if iPhone could rub my feet after work. Id still go with Samsung. Lol
I think with the OS support there is a little more nuance, you can get android phones that you can install custom ROMs that are supported for more than 5 years, something you cannot do with an iPhone.
long live samsung and let the apple rot
Right. Totally unbiased
I also think android should've scored higher 🤨🤔😶👀
Before I even start watching I can already tell its gonna be an unsure answer or apple is gonna win by like 0.5 percent Edit: Oh nope as always apple wins.
This is not a fair comparison at all, Android has so many options, so something that runs Android wins in every single category save for possibly video. Eco, an Android phone is best. Photography, Android phone. Battery, Android has better. Design, Android. Features, Android. The fact that there are so many different phones is a feature itself. Also, air drop, facetime and those things aren't iPhone only features. They are iPhone exclusive software, but Android can do all of those things. Just with different apps. I don't think that should be given to iPhone just because they prevent other phones from using it.
iPhone all the way for me
Bluetooth guys
Alexa is boss
I love my Samsung galaxy phone no debate about that…in my opinion android phone better.
One factor people forget, is apple can control every model of phone they sell and optimize them to one software no one else can use. Android has to fit a huge variety of phones, tablets, car stereos, HiFi systems, and tonnes more. I respect apple for its efficiency and robust hardware, but I also respect the sheer size of the android usage in tech products. At the end of the day, it's never about one being better than the other, it's just a matter of use case and opinion
In practice the results are vice versa
I personally believe that android shod have scored higher and in my opinion the overall feel of android is just way better, but then again that comes down to personal preference I suppose. Overall great video love the content keep it up 👍
Iphone screen made by samsung
Any phone that can turbo charge (efficiently) is plus-plus for me
A Galaxy S7 is a lot more useful to me than an iPhone 13 pro.
Yeah then go explain why 70 % of the world population use Android, i am having a redmi note 10 pro right now for less than 200 USD and make me more than happy ( 45 watts fast charging, memory card slot, headphones jack, 120 HZ refresh rate, 128 GB as a base model, 6 GB ram, snapdragon 730 processor, fulll HD oled screen and more ) i am not sure why one should spend almost 15 hundreds on a smartphone
I can feel the bias
The takeaway here is that neither is actually better per se.  Apple is a phone for everyone while Android has a phone for everyone.
Siri sucks vs Google
I've noticed an awkward but makes sence phenomenon. If an Iphone user decides to go with android he will end up satisfied because of all the customizations and possibilities he couldn't have on the Iphone. On the other hand, if an android user decides to switch to an Iphone, he will also end up satisfied. He will enjoy the smoother OS experience and all the features that just Apple have like facetime and more... I am an android user, Samsung fan with the S22 Ultra, and I am satisfied than ever. I have such a useful features I can't  imagine myself living without, like the S pen, the super convenient notification and quick settings bar and all the customizations android gives me.  I am aware that both options are GREAT, it just comes down to personal experience and preferences :)
Which is better ? There’s no such thing. Have them both they both are good and bad
I mean if one OS was so much better than the other, we'd never get endless videos of people comparing the two....right?
a lot of ppl go iphone cus of how them insta stories look compared to android's
🇬🇭🇬🇭
Should've been more like 4/6
We DEFINITELY need more videos of you two together.
I have being using both for a long time but Ios is better for me. Optimization is it…
Nice comparisons still
Is this a paid apple ad 🤔
to be honest this is the first time  I feel the comparison is not fair. Really not sure why you didn't fight the android corner. looks like it was a given that Apple was going to win from the beginning. it seems you just agreed with everything that was Apple.  what about price point comparison for example. what about stuff include in android phones, charger, cable, headphones. cost of fixing etx
Honestly, that fugly notch, bland screen and yellowish fotos make the iPhone a terrible experience for me.
My Huawei P30 Pro android phone is still the best phone ever made lol. I'm still in love with it
❤❤
Android always. Hands down. Connect any android to laptop/PC, transfer anything, no need of itunes. Also, USB C port, customizability, changing to any OS of your choice and most importantly pricing and many other things.
Two legends at the coffee table with no coffee sharing their experience…. Can’t get better than this!
just let me put an icon wherever the F i want Apple, seriously. SO many reasons I switched to Android and haven't looked back.
F Apple.  I have an IPad and a Galaxy phone.  IOS is so much harder to use and can't do what Android can. Android is just more forgiving because of its open ecosystem.  Apple is just to walled in.  You basically have less choices to get from point A to point B and IOS is slower.
To all the angry android users who are mad about this video, Mrwhosetheboss and MKBHD aren't saying that Iphone is objectively better than android, they are just saying that their combined opinions are that Iphone has an edge on Android.
There's nothing like watching a video about a product or service, while browsing for said product or service online. Multi-window on Android is indispensable, in my opinion.
Personally I don't really think comparing Android vs Apple phones makes any sense. Since Android is open source, basically every non-apple phone runs Android. So it's really comparing iPhones to every other phone. Comparing Android itself to iOS makes sense, but not the hardware.
Just very strange.
Eco topic you should have spoken of the updates on iPhone
The detail you can pull out of the iPhone raw photo mode is unparalleled
Android users left the Earth 😂
iOS has a better UX overall, everything somehow just works and is hands down orders of magnitude more optimized than Android (I'm an Android developer since the last 12 years). Loved MKB's quote "Like in sports, the most boring team does the best". But yeah, the USB-C thing does bug me.
it is a testament to the quality and appeal of the iPhone when just one brand can compete against basically all other phone brands. When you're comparing against all android phones and not for example, just Samsung phones, the iPhone must be pretty good
When my work pc broke I used Samsung Dex to work for a full month, absolutely baffling how good it is.
Android vs iOS is the real comparison
OMG I just got an add for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip phones saying how good their cameras are, while Marques is literally half way through talking about how he'd rather use an iPhone camera for the rest of his life xD
THE APPLECHANNEL!!!!!!
Can't help but feel that this just extremely bias.
Ahhhhhh... bull dookey.  I'm still keeping my Samsung and you can keep your Apple.  You will NEVER convince me that Apple is the best choice.  NEVER!!!  The Sun will burn out into a cold ember before I EVER even consider Apple as a viable alternative to Android.  Other than that.  Have a good day.
Less stock apps on iphone and the option to uninstall most of them (if not all). Great option.
Arun X MB haa perfect combo!
Rog
Where the fukk is design
Mmm, loved the colab with two of my fav tech creators, but for some reason, I felt this comparison was unfairly biased towards apple🙁
Tell me you're biased without telling me you're biased
I'm just starting the video and you say Samsung and Apple screen is a draw? How much is Apple paying you for the lie? Hope I don't unsubscribe before the video ends because of your inaccuracies
Mkbhd is an Apple fan boy loud and clear
I have the one plus 9 pro and find battery brilliant and charging is full in 30 mins from 4%
C’mon man we know  is the BEST but the Droid boys are not gonna like this video too much 🤣
I always say: For people who don't know what they're doing, iPhone is the way to go. On the other hand, if you understand technology and have a lot that you want to do with your phone, Android is for you.

POV: you see him playing Genshin 🙂
You guys should do a video on some of the best Lock Screen widgets for iPhone.
This is the kinda of conversation i wanna have with my wife 😂😂
I accidentally activate Siri more than i actually use it 💀
This is obviously a biased win for the iOS
Lmao iPhone never is level with android for customization 😅
mkbhds outfit is professional
The comparison is just like Messi or Ronaldo
Come on! I was willing to sort of quash my opinion and go along with this entire thing, but at the point where you give apple a draw on customization and assistant I could no longer take the video seriously. Are you kidding me?!
first of all... im not that type of a guy, who sais that this or this is THE best phone nad i actually do have both (android and apple) and i use both very often. But i think it isnt fair that you compare the two, right after apple gave the phones a major update. its like reviewing google vs bing right after google made some enourmos changes and bing not. Still good video
If you compare reviews when s22 get out all the advantages were in s22 favore but now since new thing with all apple they changes all in the iPhone favore  Now I am so confused 😕
Imagine using "vibration motors" as a criterion for choosing your phone
FUCK IOS AND IPHONE!
In my perspective, this is really, really biased. Most of these features are better on the S22 Ultra (such as the camera), but just because of Instagram and Snapchat, it got a lower score. Whenever Android is better at something, they start philosophising, and further spreading the topic, finding the tiniest flaws in Android. The half point system is BS. Every time Android gets a point, it's half a point.
The keyboard is really bad on iOS. The iMessage it’s slow, I hate not being able to swipe on a side to reply to a message…
The moment when the .5 disappeared was so satisfying.
Same video with unbox therapy please!
I love Arun's take on everything!
It's so good to see you guys together.
Android all the way
See this is the thing i don't like about these youtubers south asian countries which are most populated countries in the world use android bc it's VERY cheap, every backward person is getting a chance to use a piece of tech and be on the same level with a rich person which is really a good thing bc everyone should be happy not just privileged people, I'd give android a rating of 10 just bc of this.
Iphones are shit, because youre missing out on far too many games and the fast settings menu (the one with wifi and bluetooth) is far too simple, you need to go into the settings to find most things you can find directly in the menu on android! And thats just two things Iphones are mssing!
I don't trust that assessment.
the title should've mentioned *sponsored by Apple * 🙂 I'm very disappointed i loved these guys ....💔
Apple is still garbage interms innovation.
I watched again and I literally feel this video has to be redone to eliminate the unnecessary biases while sticking in the categories that really matter. I can't see beyond an Android win in such case
You guys awarded points to iPhone for battery? Mrwhosethebose really pushed you into that! For me the video ends there. This isn't a fair comparision
nice vid but im still a android user thx bye
HANG ON FOR A SECOND WHY DOES THIS VIDEO END AT 20:22 IN TRASLATED AS 2022
Neko ko preferira ios ocenjuje koji je bolji . Smesno vise ne pratim ni jednog
this is incredibly bias, they actually contradict themselves
Worst very bias comparison ever from the start display was draw 😂😂😂
More like an interview than a competition sorta thing  There should be a person asking the questions next time and you two respond to it
honestly when 95% of the population is running around taking pictures of food, ordering more useless stuff online, and watching internet cable channels like netflix.... Why are you paying for a $1000 dollar phone? These are the same humans that let Apple shut their batteries down to prevent overheating or something... I cant even remember. This is all a joke, just like how gas is over 6 bucks a gallon but only rich fancy pants have electric cars... Why hasnt our shipping trucks been turned to electric first? EXACTLY. You humans let these people brainwash you and take all your damn money lmao I should join them.
Im an adroid user for 12+ years i had motorola, xiaomi, google, and samsung phones over the years, and i got an iphone 13 for the first time a couple of months ago, and im completly amazed, i mean i knew about all the features i just didnt think were worth the price but they definetly are, im my opinion the iphone 13 is the best phone at this time
Fun video, but way too biased going into it. Whenever Android came out ahead some arbitrary reasoning was put in place (like limiting Android to specific brands to make Apple win). Why combine battery life and charging when you separate photo and video? Also Apple got points on screen with notch, lol
The war has started
I saw what you did for Ryan tryhan that is so cool what you did
Hey Mrwhosetheboss, you should visit Bakersfield. Great place and great food
Markless browlee.
In those inferior environments, innovations are always losing, as absence of smartphones with folding screens...
To be honest that screen comparison is not even close. That's an automatic android. Photos android is way better videos iphone. To be honest I only see apple winning in battery and efficiency
Iphone sucks.... Safari sucks.... IOS SUCKS... 🤷🏼‍♀️
I want a phone, tablet, laptop and wireless earphones… there is no doubt that apple is the best if you want all these to work together.
are you dumb android is wayy better
One thing i long noticed about mkbhd is that he tends to gravitate towards iPhones... Which makes it hard to take his android phone reviews with seriousness coz uncious bias is a real thing
Never noticed how strong Arun's accent is till he is speaking side by side with an MKBHD
Honestly when it comes to software updates I do not think it's that much of a straight topic, at least on Android. Because Android has many variations I have found that even the Galaxy S9+ that is stuck on Android 10 and One UI 2 has more features than the latest stock Android versions. Yes with Xiaomi or Samsung you have less years of updates. But in the end what good are those updates if they are just going to add things that you have had with you MiUI or One UI for the last 4 or 5 years? I love Marques but I have always found him to be a little one sided when it comes to Apple, to the degree that he even defended the $999 monitor stand, so I always take his Apple praises with a small grain of salt.
<feature that's good on an Android> : "but do you actually use it?"  <Random feature on iPhone>: "oh I need it since I'm choosing one phone only"  Tech YouTubers are getting a little silly.
Thank you. My fanfic is almost complete 😘 love to see you two collab. oh yes. yes I do.
iPhone > Android             PS5 > XBOX Series X
I would say that this isn't a valid comparison, you are comparing a phone brand with a OS system, android vs IOS is a better comparison, or iphone vs Pixel... Or iphone vs Galaxy...
Can we stop the argument? iPhones have better support, are simpler and have more support, while android phones have the ability to download apks, are much customisable without a root, and use USB-C. There are plusses and minuses. I use an iPad and a Google Pixel, both are good, please stop
There's a point to be made about value retention. Can you sell Android 2 years down the lane?
They talked about iPhone lock screen but didn't talk about home screen. I think Android home screen is way better. On the other hand you can't even see the wallpaper properly on iPhone. And I think we spend more time on home screen than lock screen. In my case, most of the time, I take my phone, hit the fingerprint sensor and I'm on the home screen skipping the lock screen.
super biased  what can i say sheep will always be sheep
Fun fact of the day: about 93,000 liters of beer are lost in facial hair in the UK per year🍻    you’re welcome👍🏽
9:50 video ends here. apple literally figted on court against right to repair movement. they still not using usb type-c . and they dont sell spare parts to open market.   anyone believes that apple is eco friendly must be living in the middle of the apple headquarters.
I find android to be far more easier to use and offer best experience. Especially if you're not willing to pay endless monthly subscriptions
@4:55 that calculation is not right. You are in airplane mode in the sky, that definitely will save battery..
Android getting so low points? C'mon u guys are tech YouTubers you should know the truth
Colab aside, I like how Arun keeps cleaning the phone on his t-shirt like most of us naturally do.
Me using my Nokia 2.1 to watch this video which is not even nearly the devices being mentioned here 😂
Man. How awesome can 2 people get. Good vid mate, props to you and Marcus. Really really awesome vid.
Purchased a s22 ultra a few weeks ago, been a iPhone user for a fair few years I fancied a change, didn’t end well sold the s22 on 2 days later, I’m too use to iOS speed and optimisation to go to android, the s22 ultra looked a beast but it’s nothing for me against the 13 pro max
Love the two of you having your favorites from both worlds.  There is a phone for everyone, depending on what one wants.
Iphone = show off U can't change so many things in iphone
Why are you straight up ignoring features on android??? Example: how many years of support does the fair fone give you? And how much more user servisable is it? I undersratnd that not a lot of People are going to buy this type of phone but that is the best part of android. IT GIVES YOU CHOISE AND DOES NOT LOCK YOU DOWN!!!
Video 101: waiting for Arun to heart my comment
this comparison is so stupid I watched 5 minutes and stopped.
1:08 i like how its on 69%
best collab
Huawei phone is the best!
honestly i really liked the lighting
Video only for apple fans 😁
Great combo but I saw a lot spontaneous bias for the iphonethe 2 of you. I mean for instance, Android (Samsung) wins the display category and not a draw as you gave. Also reliability and customization stuff or should have gone to android. Likewise your approach to the photography was too simplistic and therefore subjective.
I wish they were a couple
Environment... no mention of labor to make these?? Love how that is always overlooked or not mentioned
Screen quality is always better in Samsung. Apple won't beat it unless it opens it's own factory. Biased
I guess I was wrong. Marques Brownlee does not hate the iPhone. Or his Samsung contract has run out.
I don't like it that marquis is only saying iPhone. Must be the money he gets for it but its not why I'm looking at this video. Very disappointing!
Dah!  iMessage, FaceTime, airdrop, only work on an iOS to iOS.  iPhone gets the best battery life and best benchmarks, point to iPhone.  Camera get a tie.  I wan the 10 time zoom but both phones have advantages.  iOS updates are often released with bugs, no point for that.  Love you iPhone but loved you more without a notch, with a fingerprint unlock.
I'm surprised they don't use split screen. It's an absolute staple for my productivity.
A  extremely fast battery  charging is always better  My wife games on her phone n when ur gaming ur using battery fast. She put her phone to charge n in 15 mins she up n running again. When we work we barely use our phones for gaming So The battery will last a lot  newayz. I work early morning n sometimes i forget to charge my cellphone. But i ino that i can plug it n In the 15 mins it take to get ready for work my cell will be 80% charged
I absolutely hate my ipad its the worst its ipad 7 and 32gb is not good for it already is gone plus the battery is garbage it charges decently plus I cant get apps not from my country and i hate
When MKBHD uses the  X80 pro his mind would be changed
An Iphone sellers  No honest review
A sub to the channel would be… competitive
staying on iphone because the camera photos/videos is just so awesome. like the guy wearing black said i used android in the past and it will sometimes load the camera app so slow and also taking photo you take it, and it’s storing on your album it takes few seconds whereas apple it’s so fast and consistently been better for me.   love iphone always and forever!! ♾
Well you Can't simply win in an argument with MB about apple or iphones, this guy can literally make you believe that the apple fibre cloth is also worth the money.
well only one person having the final word  I am glad we all can use anything we want Iphone fanboys will be happy with this video  not me my note 20 ultra does the job very good
Everyone wants last year Samsung, they just get worse with the updates
I liked it better when you were more energetic
Android has things just like airdrop and FaceTime their just called something different, ex, airdrop on Android is near by share
Marques definitely should return the favour and do a collab with you in the UK
Vick x80 pro makes me want to upgrade from my iPhone X to it
Btw you should actually listen to Rick Astly’s songs apart from never gonna give you up he’s actually REALY good
Am disappointed in this vid😐. Didn't expect this from you Arun just be the honest guy we know
You don't see them mentioning the fact that iPhone maintainance cost more than an android.....and that matters alot
It's easier to comp iOS and Android not iPhone Vs android. Or picture Samsung flagship phone Vs iPhone
Are you actually trying to keep a more brit accent against him🤨
2 kings 👑
Love the video, but I think the apple vs android thing needs to die down now. Apple is a company, android is a software used by a gazillion companies. Maybe compare Apple with Samsung or something like that, then android with iOS.
100% biased competition
It's 2022, and we still have fanboys getting upset that their 'side' didn't win. First world problems, lol.
You guys are apple shills
I am not going to lie but I really don't agree with MKBHD. I know these are subjective, but for example using an Android is definitely more fun than an iPhone. For example, when I get a new phone, I like to a spend a good hour or two looking at settings, because it is exciting. Oh, I can disable pop-up notifications from every single app! Oh, I can straight up block an app's permissions! Oh, I can customize how I want my taskbar or my hotbar! These are the small things that make an android legendary. On an iPhone, it's boring. The settings are same for every device, the looks and usually the options too. The cameras are also so much better on Android than iPhone. It's just more exciting. Like, you aren't just seeing "Video", "Camera" and "Ultrawide" options on an android. You are seeing almost everything. And if you can't you have a "more options" tab. I just like it more. So yeah. iPhones are just boring for me
Apple's phones are honestly like the fancier option for buyers, and it worked! Samsung on the other hand is just the best phone out there you could get because of all the choices, the customizability range and much more but Apple still gets more attention just because it's a unique OS. I think it's all because of  Apple's satisfying software design and Samsung looks like they're trying too hard to beat Apple.
feels biased towards iphone . never talked about playstore and apple store with heavy prices and some apps are not there in apple store.  iphone battery backup is more only in standby it will drain like petrol rate draining money  . iphone will never catch up in customization compared  to android .
i guess android is for the east and africa the west apple wins
I just changed for iphone and highlight problems are for me: Where are live wallpapers without touching screen? And second thing, why the f*** doesnt windows understand iphone as a hard drive? Why ?
Sorry and love u mrwhosetheboss but how r u to happy with taking photos and seeing a bunch of pixels?
Honestly when he put MKBHD in the video I knew the IPhone was gonna win..... A really biased video...... Could've been done better.
Yeah I appreciate everyone has their own opinion with screen but I'm sorry there is no way iphone can win that category -_-
Man missed the whole Jailbreak community on iphone
@1:49  editor mistake😂
Biase
I'm surprised nobody mentioned third party app stores.
I run a repair business and belive me, for reliability android is best
Snobby. Disappointing. Rich kids reviewing rich products. I use my phone for work everyday. I don't think for a minute that iPhone is better than Android. It's not even close.  I'll record a lot of videos for customers. I can record a few seconds and pause on Android. I can't do that to iPhone.  Since I've got a pixel 6 Pro, previously with Pix pixel 4a 5G, I can do videos that iPhone simply dream about it.  And I don't know why you guys obviously chose 10 categories to do it.  If I was you I'll go for 50 categories and see how far I can get to.  90% of the people I work with use iPhones.  But for some reason my pixel phone that has better photos and better videos all around.  It feels like you guys were doing some kind of promotions for iPhone but. We'd forgive you for now.  Thank you for doing a very important, controversial topic when it comes to smartphones. Smartphones.   I watchi all your videos so I know what you guys are thinking.  You're all iPhone supporters or fans. There's no way you will give more to Android.  But let me ask you, are you actually using Safari or Google to search for whatever you are searching for online? 🙂
bah humbug
I felt like it is an apple promotion  for no reason on the day they lost battery gate 🤣🤣.There is no winner,I am using the Pixel as a normal user and my battery never died in 24 hours with some fair use .The point is that Apple can't compete with phone manufacturers with offers at a fair price for many people and Choices 3rd party integration . Apple is just a greedy corporation who bullies open source aspects of tech innovation ..🤑🤑
I wish those two would collab more. Amazing stuff!
so biased😒
i just don't understand why people want iphone. i remember owning a ipod touch 4 back in the day and i had to jailbreak it multiple times to get what i wanted out of it.  the fact that on android i can get the same stuff without having to do that crap is sooooo nice. sorry iphone but the fact i can download stuff off the browser on android makes it soooo worth it ( gives me ad free youtube for ex and i got adblocker for every app :P )
Great colab, well done gents, great production 👍🏼👍🏼
biased.. clearly biased.. once he was said that ios buying samsung displays.. also him said draw now..
that photo want saved and that dosnt Happen to the iPhone? that's not teuer! I had a lotnof issues with bot saved photos on my iPhone 12 Pro.
MKBHD is just clearly an apple fan and that's the only reason apple won.
Without having watched the video I am pretty sure that the outcome is "It depends". Typical no reason comparison between two platforms.
Mkbhd is an apple fan boy, so some aspects are tendentious. The 13 pro max has a very prohibitive price in various places of the world. So it is hard to recommend
I feel like if samsung wants to become the best they need there own OS
I love how even big content creators like DankPods uses just an iphone for his videos.
I really like mkbhd, he's so calm and informative.
How in the name of God does this end at 2.5/7.5... You are comparing iphones to Android but instead you are picking out Iphone 13 line ups alone, we all know android is better at batteries and charging, Android phones have better screens, they even make screens for iphones (Samsung and Sony), Photography is best on Android and Videography is best on iphone.  How do you say fast charging doesn't matter to a lot of android users? Airplay and all the apple stuffs are locked into apple products, they are not usable across platforms so what's the point? What of other features like customization in android which all apple fans are always crazy about whenever apple gives them that? What about owning your phone and ease of repairs? What about type C USB cable?  CUSTOMIZATION A DRAW??? LIKE I'M SCREAMING 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣... Who the hell wants a widget on their lockscreen?😄  Speaking of software support? Why do I wanna use a phone for 5 years or more when new ones keep coming yearly and I can have deals to get new ones? What's the ideal number of updates? And iphone has 5, then that's it whereas android can have as many as possible thanks to it's community of custom roms and mods.  I have been seeing lots of YouTubers debate this top like like Sam and a host of others, I never expected this to be the one I would say... Nah, I suspect Tim Cook running a PR 🤣
Apple by far is better - Android has its bonuses but Meh
The two best of the best tech smartphone reviewer in the universe 🔥
im with MQ, i like the square feeling
Just give all to the iPhone and that's it. Pathetic isheeps. The Samsung has the best screen ever in smartphone and they call it a draw. Pixel and s22 demolished iPhone in photography, but they called it for iPhone.
Its your own view honestly I think u would make your favorite to win ... It's clear that we would debate if I choose a iOS side n u choose android ....at the end of the day both iOS n android are great performers especially Apple n Samsung... I don't think some of the things u voted for apple is what I would say it's true cause to me it's not
Apple basically paid these people that's all very Android biased! I would have a great argument for all of it and prove my point showing how great Google system is by far the best! Waste of time watching this video!
This comparison was paid for by an iOS company I know 🙃  ...
Hey boss i really love ur videos and subscribed to ur channel since more than two years please upload videos faster i dont like youtube without ur new videos thanks BR♥️
From a user of both iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung S22, there are so many missing categories and biased opinions in this video. Top android screens are better than iPhone screens. Not an opinion, just a fact. Especially when you factor in the notch and bezels. Calling it a draw is ridiculous. If it was the other way around and only iPhone had punch hole displays they’d be calling it revolutionary.  The features are not even close. You can do so much more with android and yet somehow this was a draw.  The iPhone is also incredibly laggy from a general interaction perspective. No gesture for going back, you have to find the back button on every app. Unlocking the phone is so hit or miss with face ID in the dark or with a mask. No fingerprint sensor. A clear win for android for general locking and unlocking which is something you do 50 times a day. These are important categories for everyday use where iPhone can be a chore to interact with.
Kind of obvious who pays mote for the "honest" review
Im sorry to say this but this video is clear bs.I respected mrwhb but i think this time its mkbhd fault. He clearly makes the choices whicch favor iphone all the time.Display is an example you even admit that it is brighter it is better and still gave it to iphone like wtf do you want more?1-The chin is terrible that is keeping a lot of users from switching to iphone 2-Thick bezzels less screen ratio 3-less brighter and mrwhb even said they feel completely different in hand.What do you want more s22 display is very simetrical and sharper and greater design what do you want more that you gave a draw?By this logic in gpu snapdragon is the same as a15  but a slightly better cpu and efficiency but lets give it a draw???? BS video.
Never seen a more biased video on iphone than this . Great job 👌
GOOGLE DUO
How did the iPhone win the charging category when it has slower charging compared to the rest of the competition? not to mention that it has the inferior charging port, forcing people in the apple ecosystem to carry two charging cables and just generally being outdated considering that every other phone uses usb-c. also, iphones did not deserve to win the sustainability category when you consider that they have the lowest repairability scores. you need 4 different screwdrivers to work on the iphone, does that not ring alarm bells?  i love when tech youtubers get together and talk about technology, but in this video there was a strong level of bias in favour of the iphone.
This is bias
Marques let me down on android. I feel that the assistant question should have went to Android. I think photography goes to Android Charging capabilities Android.  Everything else is more subjective. In 2022 neither side should be a landslide
videography in Sony Xperia pro i  is insane
"Would you pick the Android or would you pick the iPhone? " what a comparison from gaint tech channels.
Bhosdiwaloon kamazkam customization wala point to android ko dete
%50 of the comments are just android users saying android is better
Also what was the video and parts filmed on?
Can’t believe you left out security
this is such a biased video. I have iphone 12 and samsung s21. they preform on the same level for me. neither one is "better" than the other. but I'd choose my galaxy/android over the iPhone any day! it's more customizable, way more user friendly than iPhone and and i use the multi-tasking feature daily. the screen on the iPhone 12 has a yellowish tinge, my Samsung screen is beautiful. my s21 is 120hz the iPhone isn't and it's super noticeable. like many other commenters have said it's all what works best for YOU! maybe the title should have been iphone 13 pro max vs all other android.
Paid 😪
That’s got to hurt 😂
The fact that you can't add an additional memory card to iPhones is a major issue. Once you've filled your phone you then find yourself paying extra bucks for monthly cloud storage. Absurd.
Where android would beat apple you look a advantage and disadvantages and make it a tie
It has been a long time since you have been with MKBHD
Android of course😄 there is nothing realy to discuss
Lol MKBHD is just pro Iphone, for everything he finds an excuse to make it pro iphone.... alot is just bullshit... Andriod should have gotten way more points. To the point of it being arround a draw
Bro is happy the dislikes were removed
Those features on IOS that "matter", matter only for older iPhone users. All those features are available through a variety of other apps on Android phones!
so how much did apple pay for this get together i wouldn't be surprised if they did  as most of us know how unethical they are
The lightening was great, was never concerned about it thou but the information.
This is complete biased video. Just admit it that you are not doing fair comparison. Android have best gaming phones, Android have best fast charging, Maximum storage and external memory options. Very convenient to transfer data to any another device via Bluetooth, direct share, easy to connect to any pc without software. Lots of free apps which are paid in iOS. Everything is chargeable in ios, even Apple music and have subscription fee. Android is the future and the best amongst all. Price point is view also android is way more pocket friendly. Android offer future technology like foldable phone, flip phones. Apple takes years to bring any changes, even to their phone design. More smarter assistant in Android.
No one mentioned how locked down iOS is sure it got 6 years of updates but once your favorite app updates in the AppStore at End of Life and requires a new iOS version, your piece of electronic turns into E-waste simply due to lack of side loading and support for older apps.  Android end of life devices will work fine for many more years to come until the specs isn’t up to par.  Apple repairability and activation lock and accumulate so much more Ewaste than broken android devices and FRP.
I am agree with the ecosystem that ios have and i realy hope that soon we saw a great match between windows and android but i will never be an apple fan...
the thing with social media and pictures, is, it's easier to make the software compatible with iPhone cause its ONE software. android has a lot of different types, so they just default to iPhone.
Everybody has an opinion, the facts aren't represented well here just two guys giving there opinion and that's respected, but speaking facts its not close android is far ahead, I won't waste time stating the facts, but Google changed the name from Youtuber to influence for a reason, all I know is the pictures, performance, whatever it is,I get is class leading results, maybe cause I know how to achieve that but that's facts. S22U. And don't get all sensitive.
The fact that iPhone came up on top is the best possible outcome. Suck it, Android users.
Remember u have a wide variety of Androids...I am surprised Apple takes it for photography and battery
Linus Tech Tips from now on. Such idiocrasy.
Bruh, Android wins just for the price alone. I can buy android phone that's half the price of Iphone with almost the same specs. Android is so much better lmao.
Based + Ratio + L  JK great video
Disappointed that nobody spoke about the painful text editing experience on the iPhone... Even with the Gboard, it's still not as fast and smooth as on Android. I have 12, so no 120 Hz, no clue if that would improve things. And also the scrolling experience on iPhone in some apps, never seen something so jittery and disturbing. Maybe I haven't set it properly, as this is my first iPhone, though I have it now for a year or so and it's not all apps, just some of them. Anyway, I moved away due to security, another ignored topic. I can say that iPhone is not at all such a great experience, my Samsungs and Pixel were more enjoyable ...
The freedom of android is important to me.
Summary :mkbhd is a nerd
the collab we wanted but didnt deserve
I am a tech guy. I decided to use both to give an objective view on it. Was Android then Apple. While on Apple, hated certain things. Maybe because I was more techy that was why. Most who chose Apple was because of the brand. I'm surprised Android was scored very low.
I have both and this video was totally biased towards apple. I have both and for me android wins in just about every category. Better platform, user friendly, design, cost the list goes on. I-phones to me a overpriced product with under par performance
Great to see mk is sponsored by Apple, talk about clueless
Proper Milking of Android/IoS comparisons in 2022. Is it 2015-16??
I expected them to be more knowledgeable, some of these point assignments just sounded biased. Im deep in both ios and android ecosystems and I do not agree with alot of what they were saying.
6:49 Arun be flexinnn 😂
You forgot to say “sponsored by Apple” at the end
Legendary once more with the two favorite tech guys!  Minor issue (first ever) with sound for some reason, bit on the low side esp Marquis.
Apple will get away with anything even if they slapped a sticker on a pencil and call it iPhone.   It's funny how after so many years of bashing Android, the ecosystem still gives you more choices. Diversity will always rule any day.
I've been waiting for this one boys
Great Collab, terrible scoring as many before me mentioned already
There were many other android usability points that weren't mentioned like the USB-C, open source, how reliable the average flagship is and other stuff and again tho I love these two reviewers bt I fell that both were leaning towards the apple side of things from the start like
Unfortunately, M is iPhone bias.  Display goes to Samsung, no nuance  The rest was OK
For hardware iPhone is the best but Android is better than iOS
How about this, regardless of what is said in this video, I NEVER want the same phone some peoples grandmother uses.
Video on New Samsung is so much better than Apple...
Where is youre "Sponsored By apple!" notification?
Why would you make a 20 minute video without using YouTube Chapters?
6:12 iPhone W and last two scores  & they know it bro stop the bullshit….  Need a bias to android and need a bias two Apple to have this discussion not to people who are biased to Apple
they are apple guys so apple won🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro you've butchered the fist bump😭
If android users don’t like Apple because of customization that can easily be improved, as we can see through ios 16. I am always a fan of simpler however, so the updates to the lock screen I am not a fan of but it is good that are giving the option to those who would like a deeper customization to iPhones.  I used androids in the past for work and tablets for school and was never impressed by them.
The mere fact that there were 2 categories for the camera shows that the entire setup was biased.
The iPhone should've won the value category since it doesn't depreciate as quickly as an android.
Bring out an Android case for my new iPhone SE! It could fit iPhones as far back as the 6 after all…
1:49 just buy a case and you will be fine
Android all the way!!! I tried using an iPhone and it gave me a headache within 5 minutes. Will never use or own an Apple product for as long as I live. When it comes to computers, again it's Windows for the win.
This comparison is kinda hard tbh.....I think to be fair if you are putting up the best iPhone in iPhone 13pro max which has the best in each category for iPhone at the moment.....you'd have to pick the best android in each category too.......I feel almost all the answers here are subjective and you can't really tell for sure.......but cool video anyway.
Are you kidding me. This is the quality of content we expect now? Unsubbed. My God. Trash.
Man i love screen splitting multitasking
i keep laughing at android users complaining in the comments 🤣
Nooo way Siri is a lot battery..my google is deaf
We the android guys thinking 🤔
shit goes real. when android have an edge they didn't count when iphone have an edge they smartly increase count. android forever.
It is so obvious, this is a compensated Apple commercial..
That's why i stopped watching MKBHD because from last one year i've seen he's sold to Apple .
Funny how people couldn't accept the results~ It's their take on it plus they have experienced a lot of phones with that said~
OMG I am still using a Samsung J6+ and it works well...... this is just getting silly, it is a bloody phone FFS not a life thing.
First of all Android is an OS and NOT a phone compony. So you should really be comparing the operating systems them selves instead of the phones. But if you want to play that game, there is an Android phone that will beat Apple in every catagory mentioned with the exception of Apple exclusive apps (there is a way to get them on Adnroid btw). And most "Android" phoned dont use stock Android, so a Google phone has a very different software expierence then true Android and will have different strengths and weeknesses. Also, any phone that uses lightning should have no business taking the win for battery...
Hard-core user? No split screen use? Pfft! Lol..
Been waiting on this Colab 🔥💯
I wonder if this discussion would even be had if google were to remove their services from the app store and be as platform exclusive as apple..
Nah sorry but this is ur worst video mkbhd clearly is owning the video while u disagree. For example as the battery comparison he said i would prefer  mediocre charging with good battery life ,but the thing is that at androids it's both fast charging and last longing life like and yet you still gave it to iphone . Always, this is my personal opinion.
Me with an iPhone:  *android definitely.*
Really? So continue to fill the pocket of uncle Scrooge, oops, Tim Cook!
I love the dent in the word dent.
I hate to see fanatics boys talking about cell phones and technologies. They do any kind of contortion to put their passion ahead. Ridiculous this Marques I don't know what.
At least im not stuck on one screen menu 👍
This video is sponsored by apple in California thanks for watching
Get the entire tech yt community to join you in one video comparing this
No app lock for iPhone 😭
I think you should've both had a separate counter
IOS with a jailbreak is the winner all round
For me i would never get an iPhone even if it was better. The idea that a single company tries to takeover your entire life by making products which only work well with their ecosystem just doesn't sit right with me. If there's a monopoly in the market, the company decides what you buy and not you.
Good cameo, but not exactly true.
I love  when these 2 amazing people get together. They both have such amazing personalities and ability to communicate with class and fun.
Clearly Apple fanboys..Sorry guys, dont agree...
That was a waste of my time. Apple fan boy through and through 😂 mrwhosetheboss lays it straight but the fan boy get the final say. Guess you're on his turf but you could've stood your ground
Bro he's jus an iPhone lover 😔
Apple's official YouTube channel restricts viewers to comment on their videos because they now they will be trolled so thumbs down 👎
Sorry to say but you cannot argue with a typical i phone user... He will always try to say iOS is better and all the apple products... So sorry I didn't liked this comparison video but still a like for you only.. you are the best tecnical phone review channel for me... Love your video's and God bless you..
Imo it would of been a tie if not slightly to samsung. Mainlt because of disagreement in how the points were laid out. But other big factors that make me absolutely despise apple is their unethical practices, their insistence on not using a usb c and also their shitty ways of doing repairs
This is not a good comparison. The problem I have with it is that you're comparing one specific lineup of phones from one specific manufacturer with thounsands  of phones of vastly different companies which just happen to use the same OS.
Owning an iphone is like being in Apple prison. The s22 Ultra is a way better phone, overall, than the 13 Pro Max(which my wife has). The s22 Ultra display is by far the best display of any 2022 phone. What about phone design? iphones are thick bricks with notches. Customability? Slave labor used to make Apple products? Repairability? But if you're tech challenged, the iPhone is a good choice, since iOS is designed for the lowest common denominator.
Almost everything that frustrated me about iPhone was addressed by moving to Android. I preferred Huawei (P20 Pro and P30) but they're no longer permitted to use Google so I've moved to Samsung (S20fe) which has a few glitches such as being difficult to wake up and difficult to screen rotate.
Love your colabs with MKBHD
I personally use multitasking on Android from time to time. I do not use a Laptop at school and if we get an exercise on Teams I just oben Word on the one hand and Google on the other one.
Hi
One of the worst quality videos I've ever watched subjectivity aside, everything in this video is poorly made. clearly they didn't take much effort to produce this content! The whole dialogue is unstructured improvisation!  The video quality is really bad! The end results is clearly biased! Sorry but that's the truth
You use both apple  so you choos apple always
How come the Always-on-Display isn't mentioned? :) For me, the phone isn't usable without that feature — this is how used I am to that feature, which iPhone doesn't have.
This is just iPhone fanboying. Samsung s22 ultra has curved screen on the side so it is draw just don't count everything else which has in it's favour.
For it me comes mostly down to the user interface. I personally don't like the way that iOS handles it. I don't even like it default android experience but the big difference is I can choose another one on Android. My launcher of choice is Niagara Launcher. That one may not be for everyone but it's perfect for me.  I actually like iPhone hardware. I'm not an apple hater. I just like my phone to work in a very specific way.
nice content
This was a pretty bias video tbh. Most arguments came down to the average android Vs the flagship Apple phone. I think a better video would've been flagship smasung Vs apple Vs flagship Google Vs flagship oppo etc.. Comparing like for like, such as s22 Ultra and 13 Pro Max probably would have swung in Androids favour...
The issue may be less of "which is actually better," and more one of recognizing that only a few years ago Apple embodied the pinnacle of consumer tech and innovation. In 2022, at least as far as the mobile sector, Apple seems to be copying Android, relies upon Samsung for the best OLED panels, and still attempts to dictate to consumers that less is more by aspiring to the abolition of ports, removing touch ID, effectively demanding that we use  Face ID (no thanks, touch ID worked fine even before the mask mandates), and still balking at a stylus. Apple's sentiment might assuage the need for some sort of aesthetic purity as envisioned by cubicle dwellers in Cupertino, but out here in the real world we love ports, expandable memory, the stylus, and yes, power bricks included with the phone. RIP Steve Jobs and long live Samsung!
Display? Really? It's not like there are dozens of android smartphones with different displays from each other or anything xd
Legends Collab 🤩
to be honest I trust you when it come to devices but android should have won
We know u guys are apple fanboys so no wonder iphone wins
Doesn't the phone itself weigh in? You brought it up during this when you differentiated a samsung specifically
Marques is highly bias towards iphone. He is what you call you big apple fanboy. You can notice that in all his video.
Anyways, here are all of the missing features on iPhone:  >1080p screen, not 4k >No headphone jack >No option for sd cards >No split-screening your apps >No foldable displays >No second screen >No USB-C >Updates constantly slowing phone down >Can't have gifs or videos as backgrounds >Can't customize alarm (or notification tone) with song that they own >Cant customize ringtone with song that they own, have to purchase ringtone from Apple app store >Cant emulate games without jailbreaking >Can't download apps not in app store >No phone charger in box >No in-screen fingerprint scanner >$120 wireless headphones DO NOT COME WITH PHONE  It's clear that MBKHD is only praising apple so that he can continue to get access to them for interviews and stuff.
What a sh*ty video  You guys are clearly biased lol
who actually buys an iphone for gaming just get a pc
My two favourite youtubers talking about phones together is such an awesome collab
So a iPhone ad...
I love the absolutley on purpose matte black vs white theme they are going there! Cheers guys!
This video is like an Apple adds
Why is there really loud music when you’re talking? It’s louder than your voices. Why do you even have mindless music on when you’re talking, especially when it is supposed to be an information video? I can’t listen for more than a minute at a time. Please consider only using music for emphasis and transitions, not when you’re talking information. Thanks!
You didn't count one of the most important factors, the ability to download third party apps
This just seems biased ......
So either get an android for a specific reason or get an iPhone for an all around ig
I feel like display should have EASILY gone to android.... I have a iphone 13 pro max and the screen is a damn eye sore.
You're literally comparing iPhones, which are designed to be high end, with the whole android world where not every device is high-end. Many of the categories would be going to Android if you'd compare to Samsung, Xiaomi as well as Google.
As MKBHD mention about videography, when you open camera by other app like instagram, i noticed iphone's post quite smoother than android's. It's like android's 120hz video cropped to half when it uploaded on ig story.
I've always preferred Iphone, as it's just a great all round experience and simple to use.
The obvious winner is iPhone for the fact it’s one company against several, how good does a company have to be to compete with that. Android is literally every other phone that is not an apple product.
Asking apple guy Android vs iPhone 😂 Who would  ever guess the winning phone in this situation😂
Didnt you say you would go to bed at 11pm every night? Like you were committing to a knew healthy routine? 🤷‍♂️
I'm using a Samsung Note 10 and the thing I hate is the lag on the camera shutter button compared to the iphone and software updates takes longer to be released than iphones
Screen Android no competition Customization android no competition Battery still android - "charging speeds cannot be taken out of the battery category".  Some bias in the arguments.
The Best Duo!!
The best we can get ..... and inspiring analysis...!
i just hate iphones its for old people 2 old people talking about phones imessage is always mention like how boring can u get, setting up an iphone is one of my most hated thing to do on an iphone , and its boring main so not cool the 2 can talk all they want iis just 2 guys drooling over there stupid iphone. 👋good talk about ur iphone guys.
So you guys are responsible for a loss of one of my kidneys now.
Put of all of this … all I could think of … it’s iPhone vs all the rest of the phones out there .. and for it to still come on top
i thought this was serious but the moment the iphone camera wins i immediately stopped watching. since i have an iphone 13 pro max now, and a friend of mine has the samsung galaxy s22 ultra i could definitely say samsung has a much better camera, all the iphone does is take pretty good pictures via instagram and snapchat , but when it comes down to taking a really nice and serious picture, you just do it through the camera and then I think Samsung is the real winner. But as I see they are just opinions and not serious, too bad.
This is most piss take thing I've seen in awhile
Kitne paise diye sir apple walo ne 😝 kam se kam display ko to acha bol dete 😂😂 ye to har koi janta display me android ka kou todd nhi
*sigh* Siri isnt frickin useless.
This ultimately came down to preference. And following MKB's video about blue and green bubbles and the percentage of people using iPhone in the US, I can see that he would subconsciously go with the iPhone in every case and saying it's preference. And then you see Arun, form the UK prefering Android in most cases. We should take in account that depending where you're from, your preferences are biased.
Well this is biased right from the very beginning. There’s no way iPhone displays are on par with similar priced android phones. Especially with that colossal notch and bezels. That should’ve been a clear android win.
It's hard to say "never" but I have never, and will never buy an iPhone. I have no desire to ever be in their ecosystem. I work in data centres and windows and Linux will always reign supreme. So I will never need to use Apple products. I'm happy for it as well.
android is better bruh, saying this when using an iphone
The score maybe 2.5 : 7.5 for Marques. But for some average person that could be 0 : 10 or for someone else it could be 10 : 0. We can never say that who's the clear winner here. Being the clear winner is totally and absolutely subjective of one's needs and preferences.
I am pretty sure that tim cook will watch this…
this is a secretly sponsored video to boost the sales of the  upcoming iphone 14 lineup, dont be fooled or blinded, i know these guys are the best trusted tech reviewers of this age and this is the reason why iphone chose them for this. I would do the same if im paid millions to shoot this video. reason why im saying this is this video is conveniently released when iphone announced their new ios and obviously to get people talking about iphone again and their new upcoming iphone 14
Apple being eco friendly is just a marketing strat by them, because some more complex repairs just suck because of how hard it is to get parts, or perform some simple repairs (airpods battery accident).   To the people who complain about USB-C being their main selling point to buy an Android with arguments “Oh BuT I cAn uSe ThE sAmE CabLe to cHargE boTh mY pHoNe anD LaptOp” most of the times lets say you are on a trip you would need at least two cables anyways, because you would probably need charge them at the same fucking time. I would understand if your argument was something like oh but i have 10 USB-C cables so if one brakes i can use the other one. THAT MAKES SENSE. Not this other bs of how i wanna carry one cable cause 99% of the time you would need at least 2 anyway.   USB-C port is easier to damage (and brakes more often) because of its design while you could literally use anything to clean a lightning port, and now someone might argue that oh but apple cables get damaged easily YEAH CABLES NOT THE FUCKING PORT would you rather have to change a port on your phone or your fucking cable…
Great video from both of you
I gotta admit, this is controversial but iPhone are getting better. They will soon no longer be scams
Yeah no shitty vid. A lot of the facts were actually fake and unlikely and in some statements the android should have won and you have also said it but the iPhone got the point
iPhone!?!?!  I have had both iPhone 13 Pro and the Samsung S22 Ultra (current phone) and the Samsung blows the iPhone out of the water on the camera.  108mp camera vs 12 and front 40mp vs ???, no comparison.  These guys need to give their pay check back to Apple.
Phones just feel like printers nowadays.  Just buy whatever is in your price range and it will do the job.  I've been using a midrange xiaomi from 2018 and as long as it keeps working I feel no need to change it.
sorry to blow everyone's bubble. but android will never be as efficient as ios.
People need to remember they are comparing iphone to basically every other phone, they are comparing basically one iPhone to like 5-10 android phones
You are on my top 10 most gay looking youtubers 😳🤑
I don’t even think you can accurately compare just the platforms iOS and Android anymore, because the range of Android phones is too great, and the customization done to the OS varies too much by manufacturer. The experience varies too widely!
You didn't say "A sub to the channel would be....."
Let's be honest here, this video is the most baseless comparison from Mrwhosetheboss
I just enjoyed watching this video sooo much, two of the GOAT together on one video, awesome🤙🏾
THE RIGHT VIDEO ON THE RIGHT TIME Thanks both....
I think this video ruined my day, I was so enthusiastic but then I realised they are both iPhone users (auto biased). The scores would have been different if Jerryrigeverything was there, So many features where not emphasised on,  Iphones don't allow room for improvement.
Hey Aron and MKBHD, I was just curious, have you ever heard of or used Samsung's Good Lock app? A lot of features from ios 16, specifically the lock screen customisation actually appeared here and are better here too.
Unfortunate the two geeks aren't using Dex or multiple apps on Samsung. With large screens using split screen is very fun and intuitive. And there  is no score for innovation in Android world.
iphone all day ofc :))
fake news is killing us bigleag
all these android boys punching the air right now
confused about the section where he keeps mentioning facetime as a reason to score for iphone, can you not facetime when on an android phone ?
I also have never met anyone that has had an iPhone for over 2 years that doesn't say it's fucked charge port works sometimes memory full has to keep deleting stuff to take video or pictures I never have had this with the phones I have had surprised you never put build quality into the mix
Poster taking the eco-conscious point, they're the ones who took away the charging brick which is making a lot of packaging
mkbhd is already fixed on choosing iphone. he is just making it seem that he is not so bias
slower charging is better on the battery and make it last longer an i dont want to feel like i have to be thered to a charger
The thing is they are talking about android in general, not samsung vs apple, don't worry samsung fans, this video is not about that.
😏👉 Samsung > Apple
If Apple was really environmental friendly then they would've accepted the demands of the EU to go USB-C directly instead of fighting against it.
Can't switch to iPhone because Google play store data/don't wanna get used to new os.
Tbh the video is quite American oriented from the perspective of the apple ecosystem user. In the rest of the world, people are not so dependent on ecosystems. The iPhone is simply overpriced and boring
I used to be an android user and switched to iPhone last year, I think android interface is way easier and convenient. iPhone 12’s battery is shit. Go for 13 or higher if you are adamant on getting an iPhone. Android is value for money
I think this is so one sided clearly Also can't beat the smoothness of Huawei emui and camera quility
Customization a draw?! Can I change the launcher on iOS? Can I move icons freely? Can I change the keyboard? Can I use a web browser with an engine other than WebKit?   This whole comparison was a joke.
Did you really choose to debate MKBHD? He is the most picky reviewer out there. He takes the most nitpicky problems from a piece of hardware and frames it. Not realistic in my opinion.
No matter what Android is still more valuable than apples iPhone
bro always on display???
This video is biased towards iOS. My budget samsung phone lasts 1.5 days easily on a single charge.
As far as I remember MKBHD himself declared Samsung S21 Ultra over iPhone 13 Pro Max as phone of the year for 2021. Now there is S22 ultra which he also declared update over S21 Ultra. This guy is confusing. :}
I think if you did this test in another county you would get very different results  In US everyone seems to have an iPhone. In other countries I have been to it's a very different story.
Nah screw that it's way to skewed towards iPhones.
The screen a tie? Come on... You said all the ways the iPhone is inferior in that regard and then gave it a tie...
iOS v android, I really don't care I just want a phone that fits my budget and makes calls and text, a phone that I can make video calls on and pair to my Bluetooth speakers. I'm not a film maker or a professional photographer so if I get good quality pictures I'm happy. The phone in my pocket is just a tool that doubles as a computer. I'm the average person that goes for the phone that suits my needs and my budget.
booooo iphone boooo (no but actually the camera points should go to android as well as the display I mean wtf man it's clearly better)
You forgot to thank your sponsor apple
I feel like the older I get, the more I like the simplicity of 'out of the box' features on phone. I don't need customizability aside from having a clean home screen. I am not going to spend more than 5 minutes customizing anything on my phone. I leave everything on default except the wallpaper. No battery saving options, no turning off bluetooth, wifi or mobile data, nothing. I just want to use the damn thing. So iOS wins in that regard by a long shot. I'm using an Android phone rn (Xperia 5 II) but I'm kinda tired of it. Battery life on androids kinda sucks if you don't resort to power saving features.
I was surprised it wasn’t brought up about the amount of software updates that are available, which makes a phones value better. Android are getting better but Apples updates make a phone last longer.
I thought this would be an easy win for Android as iPhone is not really something that comes into the running when choosing a new smartphone.
I can't believe what I saw. Is this a commercial video?
I've been hatin Iphone since 2008 because still to this day you can't send a picture/video from an iphone to another person without internet or third party apps (Heard of Bluetooth??)
pog collab!
iPhone is better when its 13 series otherwise Android is better
such a great video i enjoy it so much
I actual sense an iPhone can never beat our world of illegal software 🤣
Didn't even need to watch the full video to know IOS was going to be chosen here. Android all the way for me, having no restrictions, differences in designs across the board, customizations etc. Always Android 🤷🏻‍♂️
Surprised you left out the freedom of usability on your phones out of this one. Being able to download form the web or from other app stores like TapTap, etc. makes Android imo so much better than iPhone. Also being able to add apps way easier on android makes the total app market on google play store alone way more massive than on iPhone. And as I said before, being able to actually download things from the web is amazing. Also with how IOS tracks most activity, including even pictures, on your phones makes Android the clear winner privacy wise, which again I'm surprised you both didn't add in this face-off being tech youtubers who value their privacy deeply because you know what tech companies can and will do with it. Was an amazing video though and loved it!
For eco conscience... you didn't include repairability. What's more eco-unfriendly then being against the ability to repair your device 🤦, going even as far as to pair parts to the device and saying true genuine parts aren't until they approve the repair.
Android is getting destroyed by Apple.. 😅😅
I expected every comment to be an essay 🤣
I use split screen  many times in a day. It is now a habit
Season 2 of 'The Collab' feat. MKBHD and Mr. Who's the Boss ☺️
You gave the batery to iphone u serius??????????
crap
Love seeing you guys together. You're my two favourite tech YouTubers for different reasons, but when you collaborate, it hits that sweets spot of tech YouTube.
You should cover the glitch in iOS 15.5 where the top left corner of the screen goes blurry
Yes Samsung Dex matters alot to me and yes everything android matters alot to me .. 🚀
Make a video comparing the s22 ultra against the 13 pro max
Android is better than ios in every way, period. Maybe only UK & USA people care for imessege, facetime and that sort of stuff, but rest of the world individually don't even have that much iphone users to care for those features. Battery and performance is something that every other android phone has enough of, even many higher-mid range androids. And you don't wanna even start argument about value. That's something not in iphone's dictionary. And the most fun thing that android has is '*options*'. Be that in a replacement for facetime, imessege (like what's app, messenger which can replace and do more than ios can) to phone customization ability, widgets you name it. Android clearly wins
One thing they didn't talk about was just the experience of the OS android would be the clear winner nothing about IOS is fun or exciting
The two greatest youtuber make a real great video. What else could happen.
At the end of the day, these people are just giving their own opinions, it should be your choice if you want an iPhone or android depending on what you do with your phone
Ok my thoughts are, the s22 ultra against the 13pro max those can go head to head... The problem is with Android there hundreds of devices every year and developers cannot be making apps for each phone and with iOS it's much simpler
Android is far better the Android i dont need a divice thats 5years behind samsung
When talking about the display it's very disappointing that only the pro max has 120hz all other android devices at the 800-1000€ range have 120 Hz so I'd give display to android. Also most Android phones have very similar battery life plus 2-3x faster charging. Apples Eco stuff something is just marketing on apples side because they build their phones so they can't be repaired and the things they do have literally no impact other then green washing. Camera at least for me goes to android because the s22 ultra and the 13 pro max are equally good but apples lower class Smartphones like the SE are just annihilated by other androids. I am starting to feel like you were a bit biased in this.
do either of you have sponsor deals with specific phone companies, just making sure the rational of the choices is not a bias one
I don't care about pictures or videos am not a guy who takes lots of videos or photos  so I don't care about those
Just came here to agree that the android is the better phone.
I'd also consider (either for the screen category or the features) the always on display that is huge plus for Android. Also the usb-c. For the iPhone (for the eco category) the better battery leads to less energy needed since you charge less often.  Lastly, and that is a little subjective, the customization on Android is much better even if the lockscreen customization goes to iphone. You can change icon packs, download launchers and have more empty screens. I for example only have two screens, one with some widgets like calendar and weather, and one screen with my most frequently used apps in customized folders in the bottom part of the screen. That gives me a clean home screen where i can see my wallpaper and with icons that seem to fit perfectly. All other apps can be found in the drawer or i search for them through nova's search function.
Sranje video
You can’t pring an american that ignoring alot of android phone to tell you i phone is better
Correction:facetime is for android the person hosting needs to send a link
Bruh, androids are more convenient. Try using an iphone but owning multiple devices from different vendors. It will suck hard. Iphones are made to work with its kind. Anything else, it sucks
MKBHD is totally biased with apple products..... idiotic tech reviewer ever and is getting paid by apple I think.....Aron also shows that in his face expression everytime when MKBHD talks shit about iPhone....better to pass this video from mrwhosetheboss.
What about security and privacy?
Okay soo I am left more confused then I already was 😏
For me, compatibility has always been a deal breaker for me... Apple limits you to what is possible, doesn't have to be perfect, but it is possible on android, isn't that what humanity is about?
Price/availability of spares and accessories also counts but it's android that steals the point
bias
I think it would have been a more clear comparison if you chose a specific android phone like Samsung. Makes it easier to compare.
wow
Someone asked me a couple of days ago why would I pick an Android over an Iphone right now, this was my answer:  - Price (Accessories, ecosystem etc) - Fingerprint sensor - Notifications - Default Swipe Gesture to go back and overall gestures - The amount of apps on Android - Sideloading APKs - Customization - Charging Speeds - USB-C (No Lightning!) - AOD - Android UI (OxygenOS, One UI, ColorOS etc)   And even with iPhone winning this video by a lot of points and although I agree iPhone are usually more reliable and better, I still 100% prefer Android
It all comes down to opinion.
I'm disliking for software features
Iphones are way harder to repair, so saying a iPhone is more eco friendly when they block the user from repairing their own phone through software is plainly incorrect.
i'll pick a samsung or high end top tier vivo or xiaomi over iphone... just and just because of manual control in camera.. specially s22 ultra..  i'm into photography... and couple of things the android offers are suffocating in iphone... iphone photography is good for social media ready photos... but it's not for us...
There is the same thing like airdrop on Android
Back in the day, my android phones kept getting dropped from the company’s service list, meaning they would no longer be updated, I got tired of my phones needing the next sweet pastrie just to increase the needed battery life. So I got an iphone, they rarely ever stop supporting their phones. A severe tornado destroyed my town, just as android stopped supporting my phone and refused to give my phone the new battery patch, so my phone was useless in an emergency, my sister’s old at the time iphone on the other hand, they issued a new patch just for the tornado and even brought in temporary cell towers, so, Apple 100%.
I totally get the problem with the vibrations. I used to have a Samsung Galaxy S9 and switched to a Samsung Galaxy S10 and I've missed a lot of calls, alarms etc because the vibration of the S10 is much lower than the vibration from the S9. I actually had to buy a galaxy watch in order not to miss any calls, mails, alarms etc so I can be more available. Especially right now it's very important to me to be available for calls and mails because of my applications. I also noticed that the vibration of my alarm was getting so weak that I didn't even hear it in the morning and had to buy an alarm clock in order to wake up on time otherwise I'd oversleep. I never had such issues with my old phone. I always noticed the notifications, calls, alarms etc. I never overslept with my old phone only using the vibration. On my new phone, even if I turn on the volume and chose a song or a sound to wake me up, there's no sound coming out of my phone. Also the battery life is actually slightly worse compared to my S9 when I first bought it compared to the S10. Also charging takes a lot longer on my new phone compared to my old phone. The only reason why I decided to buy an S10 was because of the headphone jack. Now that I've also got my Galaxy Watch, I could never use a phone that doesn't have a headphone jack because you can only keep it connected with one device. I do have an MP3 player but sometimes I prefer using my phone and I couldn't do that if I didn't have a headphone jack. I know I'll be screwed in the future but for now I'll rely on my S10 and would buy one again if it would break and couldn't be repaired
Meeting of kings
This is sort of really hard to do. There's one, supreme iPhone to compare to a breadth of Android flagships of varying capabilities.
This is great! The two top tech reviewers in one video!
MKBHD is so much biased towards Apple
I love how on his own channel he was just agreeing with mark
yeah i hate to say this Samsung should have won MKBHD is getting payed by apple to say good things
i don't like mkbhd!!
I think Arun and MKBHD aren't really on the same wave length. You could really tell that Marques only gave the boring main stream answers and opinions where as Arun thought his answers out. You could feel his passion for tech.
The headphone jack Why does no one talk about the sweet headphone jack ! I think it's worth a point !
I believe in android
I wouldn't touch an iPhone with a stick.
Looks like Brownlee was the only one judging in this and dude was paid off by Apple or something probably. iPhone isn't the best at everything like that lol
I miss the dedicated music app where I could buy and play my music without ads. YouTube music doesn't even come close to what Google music was. Even my own music has ads now after every song, so I would rather listen to the free Pandora over it. So as much as I hate to say it this is a win for the iPhone but not enough to make me switch.
So, if android barely edges it out its a draw, but if iphone is ahead by just a hair its a clear win?
This was made for apple fan boys! Enjoy 🤣
You guys not being bias at all
I really enjoyed this!! Now do the computers…MacBooks vs Dell XPS or any flagship windows pc.
If you want phone that will last, have no issues or slow motion response for £1200 or more … just save your self a £££ and get iPhone … after few years it will be the exact phone as new … 👍
He literally named about 3-4 things andkird did better and it got no points come on now
I can choose and create my own icons and general layout of my phone (apples customization ends on the home screen) that has to count for something
Reparability, charging speed, open-source software, S-pen in this case, cool features (flip smartphones),  multi purpose buttons, x10 more customisations, better price range and options, better notification system as well as live media controls, permission granting, finger print scanners and facial recognition, better widgets, multiple launchers to choose from, more privacy focused if you want it to be, smart lock. There's a lot more stuff you can squeeze out of an average priced Android running Phone in my opinion, rather than selling a kidney to buy the most expensive flagship (don't recommend it)
They gave the camera point to iPhone? Okay I don't say it's bad but c'mon man the s22 ultra is way better in colors, resolution, zoom etc.
Didn't understand what you guys are trying to compare!  Is it Iphone manufacturer vs Android os?  Or Iphone vs all Android  Or what!!  It should either ios vs android  Or Iphone vs Samsung (or other android phone)
Lot of ios hate comments… most of them may not have used it for a week.. switched from android to iphone 6 months ago.. loving this beast ❤️ iphone13
Why there was no category for best foldable phone or what is better android auto vs apple car play. Screen is not a draw Samsung has far better screen. There was no reparability category. Type C vs lightning.  I think they choose only categories where iPhone is better...
20 minutes went like snap
I would give my left nut to have advanced Bluetooth controls on the iPhone
My iPhone has 6 years of software updates which just blows me away. Yeah it cost more at launch but I’ve had it for twice the average Android lifespan so it’s actually quite cheap.
iPhone features are decided by some MBA's and theoretically works for "MOST" people. Nobody is "most people". Individuals buy phones and if you look hard enough, you can find an android which works the best for YOU.
It's Actually iPhone 13 pro max vs. All the Android Phones.
Marques straight up going apples a@@
Note: you cannot download mods in iOS
My take on all this is simple : I don't care ! Pick the phone you think will best suit your needs !
Why is MKBHD pretending to be this cool with Apple? Apple paid this guy tí do this!🤣
I m comparing British vs American english
i love your collabs and the video was very helpful!
you can talk all day about how nice using the iphone... but once you take the s-pen out of the s22 ultra.. it will destroy everything good you mentioned about the iphone.. man.. you can't even send a tiny file to your computer via bluetooth with an iphone!
Wow i hate everything about this video you guest is so much sell on iPhone
Thanks for another, high quality and interesting video!
mans in my state, boutta find this man and give him a high five
disagree on value - own the phone for 2 years and the iPhone will be worth more than the Android to re-sell
I love how mark just dissed android
Nice!
I'll always go for Android just for the fact that if I don't like something I can probably change it.  I don't like being restricted to how a manufacturer thinks I should use a device.  Also, I love my live wallpapers lol. And yes, I know apple has dynamic wallpapers, but they ONLY animate on the lockscreen.
If Apple adds a 'Watch Later' option for YouTube in notifications, I will have no need for Android...
it's kinda rigged as you are looking as android vs iPhone. Since iPhone only makes high end phones, they should've only looked at high end phones on android's spectrum. Rigged from the beginning! just my opinion...
Well it all goes down to how you use a phone.. to me an android will always be better... in the future people will realise why andriod will always be better. Both phones when pushed to their limit.. most cases the iPhone tends to optimise the phone in a way that it pisses the user of
The end result of the photos is better on Android but Apple wins ?
That pop at the beging scared the crap out of me
I feel like you guys kinda biased to apple
Android phone user and Fan but I agree with the results completely.  Even 2nd hand value market you get more money selling a old iPhone.
Am a trader multi tasking is the strength  Andriod can be rooted to any update  Any camera can be used for processing with higher MP Edge is a super feeling  Any display day andriod is rockstar
Mkhd is apple fan boy. I will unsubscribe his channel 🙄
Now we need harmony os vs ios because huawei is trying to overtake (or already did) ios
APPLE CAN NEVER WIN VS ANDROID COS THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY ANDROID PHONES
As far as eco-conscious goes, I have to make a huge point in favor of Android: repairability. The best thing you can do for the environment is fix what you have instead of throwing it out and getting a new unit. Androids are, by miles, easier and more financially sensible to repair.
If you think about it you can install different things into android and third part apps which is a huge thing
ngl mkbhd is kinda biased
2 Apple fan boys. No surprises here. Move on.
How can the display be a tie?? Samsung displays are by far the best in the world. I have both phones and I can definitely notice the difference. Samsung wins by far.
For me, Experience both, if you have the money enjoy the strengths of these phones. Nowadays people have primary and 2ndary phones.
MKBHD full form be like Maa Ka Bh*sda...🙄🙄😅😅
No disrespect but I whole heartedly believe android takes the win
Oh man, the Android stans having a collective meltdown here is music to my ears.
I have an Android and an iPhone. I use the iPhone as a gaming phone. That’s it. Everything else I do on the Android.
interesting to see the Mr WTB's arms work properly when he's with MHB
Why am i forced to think that this video is sponsored by Apple🙄
so it is settled
A lot of people end up having both Android and iOS. Most smarts TVs are Android and car headunits too or even like me I always get a new android phone and a new iPad for home use. Most people get to experience both for the good and bad they both bring
This comparison was biased as hell, damnn
New video title: Apple fanboys think iphone is better than android.
Guys don’t take this comparison to heart. If you have a phone that you really like, then you shouldn’t care about what other people think. Realistically, they both have their strong suits, and I love both Android and IOS for how they are. They need to be different otherwise everything would be boring.
Android :- Allows you to do immense multitasking and customization.  Tech reviewers :- Yeah, I just dont use those features so Im going to give 0 points.
i did not C this coming this lightning quick
lol, 5.9k dislikes as of me watching this now. WTF....?
1:08 nice
Didn't know ppl still took these phone wars serious in 2022 LOL...I use both a 13 pro max and an S22 ultra..why use only one platform and not enjoy the best of both worlds is my opinion...
Strong iOS bias from iPhone biased tubers.. not so surprising I guess.. the guys found every excuse to rate iOS higher, sad to see
Split screen is awesome
1:49 really nice little detail of a dent in the on screen caption
Iphone is trash
So even in an unfair competition where it‘s the iPhone against every other Android flagship the iPhone crushes everything else.  I have used Android over the years and I‘m managing the Android phones of my family members and I just can‘t understand the appeal of them.  I actually have suggested iPhones to some friends who have switched and none of them never went back. The only thing I experience is how they transform from Apple haters to Apple fans but never the other way around.  The biggest hater actually was my girlfriend so I bit the bullet and got her an iPhone for her birthday and she‘s now saying that she will never go back.
1:49 really nice little detail of a dent in the on screen caption
As a lifetime Android user, I accept that Apple's ecosystem is extremely strong and thorough, and if I had enough money when I was young to buy an iPod I'd probably be an iPhone user right now.   The key features with Android devices is flexibility, transparency, and a larger scope of compatibility. Flexibility: I can tinker with my android in any manner that I require without having to jailbreak/root it, and if I want to do those things its much easier to undo. Additionally, desktop emulation of an Android is MUCH easier than an Apple product, meaning I can save tons of battery life and have graphic higher fidelity by using a PC that I will always have anyway. Transparency: I can plug in my android to any computer and dig through the files, manually find what I need, and essentially use it as a hard drive that I can take with me. Compatibility: Every modern Android device can be charged with a usb-c cable. The same usb-c that I can use with my Nintendo Switch, or Oculus Quest, or even a modern Macbook.
how many ads in video dude
It's not iPhone vs Android, It's iPhone 13 pro Max vs Samsung s22 ultra. 😁😂😂😂
Just speaking of software and not hardware, the only thing i miss about android is the fact that is open and i can have whatever i want on it, everything else i think iOS is just way better, and if you consider the features on a apple ecosystem is just another league that android can’t compete. In general I think the best thing on android really is the choice you have and the prices. I believe the iphone is just the best phone for the average consumer, for people that don’t look for nothing in particularly.
Apple get way more hype and stuff
Android Superior to Apple no matter what I don't care about your iPhone fans are fanboys only thing Apple has good as a IMacBook Pro peroid there Phone suck took them 16 OS to get widget  & bunch features copied from Android Apple has no originality or no new technology to bring to the table.
any time of the day ill take the android apple makes me lose my mind what a boring phone. tried it for a few months and it wasnt worth it
why is everything in favor of apple???
You forgot one important thing, iPhone can use even blind people ! I mean it’s more convenient for people with special needs 😇 google can’t do it at all
Wear some trousers FFS!
Everybody have USB C and who watch videos on a screen that has been bitten off in 2022 😂 come on that big notch need to go
iPhone is better quality but isn't as user friendly
We all know the points given is a personal thing. But i would give most points to android. I use both and i just prefer everything on android. Ios just locks me down everywere and i cant do what should be able to do
eco friendly absolutely does not go to the iPhone
20 seconds through "We should've done eleven". Bro just do it you haven't started yet🤦🏾😂
Hi Arun, big fun, I was wondering if you could do a video about any phone or software that revert or remove markups from an already edited photo
beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
loved it! my two favourite tech reviewers from across the pond! great comparison video. i wish more could have been talked about using android and ios with their respective windows laptops and macbook/iPads. the flow and the ecosystem between the phone and main work machine can be a big factor for some people.
why nobody talks about .apk folders? the files managements ?
I have to say, it was quite an unfair test. All of the imperfections of every different android on the market were compared with the admittedly very good singular model of the Iphone.
2 of the world class tech creator.  2 different accents 2 different countries  together in Technology!
When YouTube heavyweights, Collab! 😁
Nahhh, MKBHD is an apple fanboy. This vid is super biased to his side.
Fuck apple
but if you look at price quality is android
Why both sound like Apple fanbois?🤔
my dad said it best after we both had been switching between android and iphone for a few years.  iphone is like a screw driver and hammer, android is like a 150 pc tool set. you can do way more with one, but that also turns off most people off as they just want simplicity/ease of use and reliability over all else. neither is wrong answer.  if anything, both of them try to become like the other (apple getting more features/customization/freedom, android getting better out of the box software experience through simplicity and reliabilty and not taking a ton of settings changes and aftermarket apps to make it a good ui experience)
You know you can adjust the Vibration on the S22 ultra right? from weak to powerful. Maybe thats why the S21 ultra did not vibrate as you wanted.....you have to adjust the vibration mode.
Two GOAT of all time ? What else we need !! 😍😍
Ok so we are going iphone vs average android flagship  Display: draw, android tends to have the better raw display but iphone makes better use of what it has  Performance: draw, most users wouldnt notice much difference but apple does have less rough edges in day to day. In return for that though, android has much more you can do to make use of that performance.   Battery: android, most users arent power users and can last a day. So the difference is indeed the faster charging which android pretty much destroys in.  Photography: android, some more rough edges that happen rarely shouldnt be enough to tip it to iphone. I mean that should be part of the software reliability not the photography. Android has clear superior results.   Videography: iphone, sony does take better videos (and photos too) but we are looking at average android flagships so iphone.   Software reliability: iphone no question.  Software features: android no question. Even iphone users would agree so idk what this video is on about. Just because apple has a monopoly on their features despite android having the same doesnt mean its better. Meanwhile android can do way more, not to mention its much easier to do more on android than iphone. And its clear that it isn't a "niche" just look at how many iphone users were customizing their phones when apple allowed them. So i guess customization was "niche" until apple introduced more of it to you guys? Lol  Software support: iphone but its rivaled by pixel, but on average iphone  Pricing: android no question
This one was a great topic i wanted to watch with both the legends
totally disagree
At the end of the day, I think iOS and Android are really not comparable. It really is a subjective thing whether you decide for Apple or Android. In terms of hardware, I think both are really great, but I prefer the software of Apple. Android gets you better Budget phones tho.
You are quick to share points that were for android calling it a tie... But not the same for apple.... Like the customizable part... Clearly android has been ahead... But you shared the point...  🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️💀💀
Software reliability please try miui once in your life every day new bugs and glitches are discovered
Great video!
Can i have a iphone 13 pro max?
I dont know why, but i felt it was a one sided comparison .
How come a 8k is compared with 4k bull shiting
It looks like MKBHD is an Apple employee! :) He is always biased on Apple.
Value for money is the main thing, we don't need such excellent features in our daily lives whether it is apple or android
Android :- Allows you to do immense multitasking and customization.  Tech reviewers :- Yeah, I just dont use those features so Im going to give 0 points.
Loved it
iPhone has America in a chokehold I envy other countries who isn't bullied into "just get an iPhone."
BRUH bro just had 4 adds in the video
This was the most soothing and relaxing video ever.
that means IOS system destroyed Android
Extremely subjective review & views! The exposure was bad (MKBHD's yellow) ! Shot on a cheap camera! Love the collaborative effort. Thanks guys!
I got iOS on this, I use both OS (I'm typing this on a Pixel 6 Pro) but iOS is just more polished and fine tuned. Tbh Android isn't as customizable as most people make out to be, anything lower than the UI is locked down, I have no want to just change appearance or limited accessibility features.   And also how archaic Android's operating system support is drives me crazy, Apple has been updating its phones globally for over a decade, while Android phones still struggle to this day in age. As a network engineer, I prefer security, so it's iOS for me.
Arun just asking marques bout everything he like the judge
But but but... Marques actually chooses the S21 Ultra!
@Mrwhosetheboss Missed fist bump opportunity with Marques!!! 20:08
I agree the challenge is, There are many Andriod phones that highlight different things. Apple does everything on one phone. So you have one stop shopping. Now saying that, I'm an Android / Samsung user. It works for me and I'm fine with that.
This comparison is so biased towards iPhone...
Nobody talking about apple blocking iCloud permanently and you have to uninstall all your old app and start reinstalling them no matter how many? I mean that sh*t is crap and IPhone doesn’t do widget better than android, most of you judgments are not correct.
i love these kinds of videos - just really chill, relaxed and calm, gotta be my favourite!
iPhone straight up looses in battery + charging category and eco friendliness category at least ofcourse i am not an android fan but this comparison was too bias towards iPhone .
What about in box chargers? Being forced into every apple service? Still can't set custom ring tones, why is this still a 14 step process in apple? USB C?
When you ask an apple fan ... Not fair!
I get it most people here are phone connoisseurs, need 120 fps 144 hz and good cameras, as a gamer the customization is the single biggest point and believe me i wished i could pick an apple product because it's a trust worthy brand with quality but don't allow much in terms of apps, say emulators which give you the best gaming options on a phone hands down
I wish you would have discussed security. I am a novice user and your fair comparison in each category was super helpful thank you
The andriod has more gigs of ram than my pc
For me it's just a typical day of interviewing an apple fanboy.  MKBHD never cared about android.
Am I the only one who felt Mrwhosethebose heavy British accent when compared to his other vodeos🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Display is not in certainly a draw::: iPhone display is more pleasant on the eye than any android phone ever created in this universe!!
Samsung better
I enjoyed this collab. Excellent content as always. How interesting would it have been if you both contributed to the final score!
I just want a Windows Phone
PUCHK IPHONE
Marques just spitting facts.!!
Apple will always bend the user over and shaft them
Ok by Far this is the worlds best Android VS IOS ever.... Period
Wow..this is the most biased video I have ever seen!
this comparison was so bias. damn... mrwhosetheboss backed down a lot...
If you are going to revisit this in the next years id’d put a scoring to both of you and talk about the numbers at the end a bit
i like how arun respected mkbhd
Ive been using Android for 10 years, decided to buy the iPhone 13 Pro, but kept my S21 Ultra for a while.. And to me, Android still the best, found some issues on iOS tha drove me nuts, however there are yes some things that I wish Android had like iOS, but overall the experience on iOS was underwhelming.   Back gesture on iOS for an S21 Ultra user is a nightmare, you have to swipe it precisely horizontally, the notch distract me a little (I guess 14 will solve this), I got tired just of thinking on how to organize the apps on Home Screen, and to add icons at the bottom of the home page you have to have 3rd party app to create a transparent widget.  Haptics on iPhone are top notch, Samsung has improved a lot over the past years, but still some level behind Apple`s.  Another thing that I noticed is that some input lag or low touch sensitivity on iPhone, scrolling on apps like instagram, twitter is very choppy and slow, even considering that both displays are 120hz capable, my S21 Ultra is way snappier and responsive.
Mkbhd nervous
Love the collab, feel you were convinced into giving iPhone points a few times haha!  Awesome video 😃😃
You guys know that Samsung wins with photos hands down when it comes to features.
Everytime I want to put music in my android phone I just plug and play on my android but on my iPhone I need to install iTunes on every new pc I use.
I think your forgetting the fact, that  - Android will be the best in most topics, "IF" you count that it doesent include in all phones.  I wouldnt say IOS vs ANDROID directly because of the fact android is more open for opensource, where apple goes trough all checklists.  I think the majority of the cheaper androids are bringing the competition from android down, i will also say that the S21 ultra got lots of updates on video, so you should check it out if your reading this, i've owned one since Jan 28 2021, and im feeling like video has got competitive on the device :)  - S21U user
Whatever your comfortable using
I just say your ad in the middle of your video 😂
the moment they gave points to iphone rather than pixel, i stopped watching the video. Didnt expect such clickbait video :( Me as a former iphone user and now a pixel 6 pro user can say for sure that pixel is better. Plz everyone knows that as long as there are dumb people who would waste their money on anything, on earth, apple will make money. The day these people get more brain cells, apple would cease to exist.
I love MKBHD  but he always sides with apple products regardless so that to me makes him one sided which isn't good for a tech reviewer
After years of using Samsungs, I decided to try iPhone 13 Pro. I've been almost a year on it now - and I'm dreaming of going back to Samsung! :) The only thing that keeps me is the ecosystem apple watch - iphone - mac thing, otherwise I struggle to see almost anything in which iphone is better and lots of things missing from it compared to a samsung. No always on display and no return swipe to go one page back are huge disappointments.
this has got the same vibes as me and my friends talking about anime lol
Android would have won this easy if this was done pre iphone13. That shit waws revolutionary. Been using android since the dawn of smartphone era but the release of iphone 13 made me want to actually have one for the first time.
Unfair Android is 100% better
Did MKBHD Really said that iPhone have better Display. I think he forget Daddy SONY 4K 120Hz OLED 👌👌
Pixels still get the latest updates. I'm still team Android. Agree with all the points but this is comparing an Apple to a bag of oranges.
This video was great and all but it feels too much based on personal preference and not enough of precisely which one truly is better in that category I agree with most things tho
Disclaimer: This video is sponsored by apple.
Apple is only reporting about carbon neutral in the us at their employee buildings, but not factories and shipping, they also use child labor to mkae their phones and have worse quality of life than most other companies for those laborers.
at the end of they day people have they pic andriod phone last longer with no issue and a more easy fix and not expensive world wide  over sea samsung is the most popular phone ive been to many country and android phone is the number one because its a lot of people who use the operating system more eco friendly to use other then having a mac computer to take care of phone issues we all have our pic i am in the navy and android in south korea is like king and in the us it like a draw  but 3rd world country and island andriod is wining so end of the day both phone are nice in they own way
Everyone talking about how Samsung or iphone has good speaker or something me who doesn't understand anything
Bias
Here I'm trying to fit 10 apps in window mode in phone. And these guys can't even use 2 apps in multi window.
Honestly I look at iPhone users like they're...simple. they have no control. It's funny.
worst video
It's look like apple paid video..
looked like you guys were too damn keen on giving full points to iphone, or declaring it a draw where android was better to some extent. quite biased comparison imo.
Looks like someone got paid to do this video
This usa guy support Apple That's logic for him
But if the iPhone was winning with such a margin and is priced similarly, wouldn’t that mean it’s crazy high value?
I have no idea how you guys gave screens a draw!
its so funny that mrwhostheboss is like why are u not using the latest phone??? and why are u using last years? when i stil have an iPhone5 s 🤣
This made me feel more superior with my iPhone thank you
Android fan bois crying in the comments😂
Aron is probably iphone lover and apparently samsung hater
I will still choose android over apple
I think there’s also a difference with the comparison if the s22 is exynos or snapdragon
Android has a phone for everyone and i-Phone is a phone for everyone
I know your trying to get healthy, but your on holiday. Try 5 Guys Burgers and Fries. Stick with a small fry.
I love when you guys collaborate!
iPhone. Done.
Nice
for some reason this discussion sound highly bias.
Not fair guys. I get it, iPhone is great but the S22 Ultra, in my opinion, kinda embarrasses the iPhone. I love the productivity I get using the split-screen and the floating windows that I can drop down anytime from the customizable sidebar, and the S-pen guys? the number of things that the S-pen does from off-screen note-taking to clicking pics, to the options to copy and snip and translate stuff using Air actions, and writing directly on search bars over typing something, and it's so helpful when wearing winter gloves. Samsung Notes app alone is a lifesaver, for both note-taking, sketching, recording lecture audio while taking down notes etc. Today I forgot to charge my Watch 4 and all I did at the office was turn on my Wireless Power Share on the S22 Ultra and kept my watch on top of my S22 Ultra and it juiced up to 40%. I do that for my Galaxy buds too. The advantages seem to be endless. What about the Always-on Display? with this feature I 'Never' stop to see my Lock-screen, it's more like going straight from 'Always-on display' to the 'Home screen', I hardly pick up my phone or tap it to see my dual-zone time or to see if I have a new notification. What about the excellent fingerprint reader? it's so funny to see iPhone users trying to pick up their phones from the desk to unlock it using the face ID, and don't even mention the face mask problem, that's sad. My wife has an iPhone 13 pro and it's sad that the limited features and the options for file folder management, data transfer and all feel so restricted. I think IPhone's airdrop feature is amazing, but I do get around using Samsung Flow with no major issues. And the biggest of all is the Type C port that the iPhone does not give you! Of course, nothing beats the swipe/translate/voice input on the Google keyboard and nothing compares to saying "hey google". I am not big on making videos and not big on social media either and so I don't really care much about how quick the camera is, but the other day at the office from the 11th floor I zoomed in and snapped pictures of cars parked over 500 mteres across the street and even the registration plates of those cards were legible, I bet the iPhone can't do half of that. I also feel the S22 ultra is much easier to hold and it brings down the menus to your fingertip, also the convenience of pulling down the notification bar from anywhere on the home screen. The problem for Samsung is that they have too many low-end phones that don't do well and those phones set the majority impression of the brand. Pro tip: in order to maximize the screen real estate on my S22 ultra, I hid my Navigation bar and use Swipe gestures to swipe from the bottom and sides, this thing allows you to swipe back from any side edges of the screen so literally you don't have to reach to the top or the bottom.
Iphone sucks it doesn't respect privacy as shown with its C.P scanner that automatically scans your photos on cloud and then warns Law Enforcement.  Also Android is much better because you can use Fdroid to get apps like NewPipe that skip YT adds and can download for free. You can RootDevices and more. Iphone is just a joke that doesn't care about your privacy, security or ability to repair or custom the device you own.
hahhaa battery goes to iphone, dude I have several phones and I could say the battery sucks compared to average android, this does not feel like honest competition
Anyhow,Mr, who is the boss is the winner by a slight margin, nowadays due to his innovation and slight advantages of being cute with a great tech, voice.....
This is not how you make an objective comparison. Android is an operating system and therefore cannot be compared to an iPhone which is the combination of both an operating system and hardware. To make an objective comparison you would either have to compare the latest version of Android to the latest version of iOS or you would need to compare an Android handset that is in the same price range and class as an iPhone.
Wtf is that motog add
This is exactly what I was looking for. I've always been a Samsung/Android user and want to upgrade from my Galaxy S9 Plus. I'm soooo tempted to get an iPhone this time simply because I am craving a new User Experience other than Android. Just two things that keep me from buying an iPhone: lack of usb type C port and the lack of always on display (so used to it, can't stay without it)
from my perspective living in a country with 44 m population where apple doesn't exist, 99% of i phones come to it are stolen and need unlocking and 95% of people use PCs so the features you talked about on iphone no body uses here, so android dominates
Android has some things like app sharing which is impossible for Apple anymore. Apple is the best but not less than Android. Android  is the best when comparing prices
DID I SEE YOU PLAYING GENSHIN IMPACT.
Big fan but this comparison was poor in my opinion.
Bro can I plz get a ps4
The better one is the one that fills your use needs best.    Case closed.
iPhone 13 series have horrible red uneven tint issues.... This guy know nothing about good displays
I love Samsung galaxy s22 ultra
The iPhone bias, it's next level. 😂
How can you say that the iPhone is more eco conscious when they go out of their way to make the phone unrepairable?
tie in display was stupid but camera(photography) not being a tie was even more stupid    battery not being tie was also stupid
Team Android.. I have an LG g8 Zfold3 and the note9.. best phones I ever had!
Apples and oranges!   iPhone is a mobile and Android is an OS!
Would love to see this done again but for all different Android brands. So Samsung vs iPhone, and then Google, etc etc
So they just basically made this video to Diss android 😏
And just one last thing. If a tech reviewer is just an Apple fan boy then how I will ever trust him?
I wish you guys could be my teachers. Because whatever you guys say, it’s so interesting.
I think the screen is better on the Samsung because it is not interrupted by the notch but I love your videos and this one was great as usual.
samsung is better anyway
My iphone has an update for ios15.5. How do you have ios16? Or is it not released yet?
OK Android users, you heard it from the Masters.
SharePlay, FaceTime, iMessage, Apple wallet, and share audio are crucial
The confirmation bias of a Apple fanboy never ceases to amaze me!
10:08 what watch is that?
Don't make it too obvious.
Although it wouldn't make much difference in the overall score, you can't say apple is better when you dig around on a dew things but then for the cameras not bring in that android generally has pro mode. Obviously pixel doesn't and that is why I sold it and got the s22u but when you use pro mode, the pics are pretty much always better if you know what you are doing. For the average person though, apple closed eco system does generally favour that area.
What's the point where two iphone lovers talk about this???
Why the fuck you shoot in down firing lighting?
One of the best collab in YouTube history right here. I hope we get to see more of you two together.
O manjaco é burro
It's the little things, like the dent in the word dent that make your videos quite fascinating. And, I love how you're chill in the video; we're still on track as per your health video.
A plus point for Android is that u can install apks and it is more open sourced than iPhone.   IPhone wants to control you.    Android wants you to control.
MKBHD you are fucking paid for the iphone
That was a great video with respect to the idea of comparison in that manner. It felt as if Marques is playing Apple but on the other hand youtheboss Android. It really doesn't matter which is better as far as they both keep competing in the future too.  The Two very confident, honest and knowledge power houses discussing a topic.... Amazing effort! Hope to see you guys together again soon.
Idk, I guess I would have taken a different approach. Since the Android market is much about choice and every costumer might look for a phone with those specific points they care about, it would have made much more sense if this was frames as any Android phone that stands out in this category vs the iPhone. Because if someone REALLY cares about sustainably, they're not buying an iPhone, they're buying a Fairphone. This video felt more like iPhone vs Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra than iPhone vs Android
Yo Qundagledigle
I didn't get either the "If you only have a hammer every problem is a nail" nor the "most boring team to watch is often the best one" reasoning AT ALL
The 2 goats are here 💯💯🫡🫡
I love the difference in opinion makes the video much better to watch   😂😂
Love the chill
Before starting the video, it's already known that you will choose iPhone over anything 😂, because when this type of competition you did you always pick iPhone over all others 😏.
apple: NOOO YOU CANT DOWNLOAD APPS OFF SAFARI, THEY COULD BE VIRUSES!!!!   android: go ahead and delete the bootloader, i wont stop you
Happy to be in the "minority" group who enjoys using a phone with no strings attached 😁
With mkbhd you know the winner will be iphone, you could have just asked which brand he would prepare and conversation over.
As someone who was android for my whole life, I decided to try out apple. Long story short, I’ll be switching back to android once I pay this off.  There’s multiple reasons but customization is one of the main reasons (which I didn’t think I’d miss until I switched). Plus joining the apple ecosystem is expensive. And if you don’t join in them FaceTime or AirDrop become useless. I never use them because I can’t use them. PS : Great collab! My two favorite tech people doing a vid together!
You should wear trousers, like markus... Its what normal people do
Super interesting to see the NA perspective and the EU (Europe not EU) perspective. Arun had much more experience with other android brands that are not currently available in the US.
Yeah I have the same problem with the vibration motor I always miss my notification I wish Samsung updates for the S22 ultra
The most stupid comparison mixing between software to hardware. Android or iOS it’s not a phone, it’s a software. As an Android user that shift a year ago to iOS, android is superior in features
Android in general terrible as expected
Not to point, Arun you missed the first bump at last mate......😂
If that aint a commercial for Iphone then what is? OH right they are there at the iPhone headquarters yeah its sponsored without them saying it. Thats my take
U got all the third worldlers triggered in the comment section
As a long time Android fanboy, I follow a lot of Android enthusiasts and podcasts... And a few iPhone people as well. Something that I've found over and over again. Most Android folks also use an iPhone. Hardly any iPhone people carry an Android.
I like both of you and your videos but this one was ...................... skippable. You two guys should have better had a drink at the hotel bar at that time of night instead of producing this nonsense!
16:45 5 years???? The iPhone 6s is STILL being supported and that phone is 7 years old. How is that 5 years????
British and American in one video
When two apple fan boys meet 😁
The very obvious thing iPhone is behind is the display but you just gave a draw?
IPhone doesn't give a charger. Most android phones give excellent fast chargers.
two iphone users decide which is better, iphone or android. I wonder who they will choose as a winner hmmmm
Mkbhd is biased to   apple
20:06 that was so awkward
*A great video that I watched after a long day, because you two are my most favorite tech YouTubers* :-)  Arun, thank you for making this wonderful collaboration 🙌
A video of samsung vs iphone would be nice
Nope, Android wins,  has so much freedom, fast pace displays, everything
I love they being together in a Video❤️🙂
The Sony Xperia Pro-I blows all those phones out of the water in the photography department.
❤️
when I started video I already predicted who will be winner but still using android because I feels comfortable with android it's my opinion
I kind of feel like there is a little bias when it comes to the iPhone typically because MKBHD might actually use the iPhone in his day to day life. I have noticed even in his tone of voice when he reviews apple products vs when he reviews new android products. With apple products he shares updates more excitedly but with android product he sounds like he is trying to just make sure that he covers androids too on his channel. I could be wrong but ai understand the loyalty apple users have to the phone. Once you step out of that bubble you start to realise that other phone manufacturers offer way more for the same asking price. Apple gets away with a lot of lazy innovation.
The title should've been Samsung vs Iphone rather than Android vs Iphone
Good that you mentioned that the Lightning sucks… I didn’t realise…😂
You can tell this is a paid for by Apple video.
This shit especially the display,battery part is completely biased towards iphone
I love these collabs with the two of my favorite tech youtubers.
so if you have a iphone budget get a iphone
android is definitely  better, I have Netflix, Hulu, Disney plus, YouTube, music streaming  services, paid games, all for crew because  of android  and my PC, can't do that with iphone/ would  be alot harder to do, I have an s22 ultra and I'm saving  so much money by having all those services  for free, btw it's  called apks  and rooting and just knowing  workarounds
Is this an 'Apple-Lover-boys-collab' or what?
I feel Android beats iPhone in a solid 6-4 because iPhone is good but when comparing to different Android devices based on their purpose like a gaming phone for gaming and a pixel for photography i would rather have the more processing and multi tasking. I feel iPhone is overrated.
The screen doesn’t related to software. Why to be stupid?!?
After watching the whole video (20 minutes uh?), you'd better go check the definitions of Subjectivity and Objectivity... And give a trophy to Subjectivity...
I don't like bloatware and find Samsung has lots of apps that you can't delete but just disable.  Apple is less invasive in my opinion.  You also did not talk about security issues and privacy out of the box.
At 1:09 the battery is 69%🤣🤣
Only tim cook paid isheeps can give display,battery and charging points to apple
This is the best colab tech video.
I think it was just a comparison of 13pro vs s22 ultra not the ios and android. That was just not a fair😔
IPhone is way better than Samsung. I love the content, but we all know the answer to this question already.
Still using redmi note 7 pro. May you send me iPhone or something as a giveaway 😜
shit show of a video you can't compare a software (Android) to a device (iPhone) if we compare ios and android so things like screen or camera does not matter what matters is what you can do on that software how stable it is  plus on android os you can boot custom roms what is privacy and security of the os which is more efficient also the amount of customizability  on each os etc.
Android is featured on a number of high tech phones.
Nice to see you both together. Good idea guys.
This entire video was just "android does it better" "yeah but apple kinda does it too so apple wins?"
I am almost a fanatical Android user, but tbh I can admit that Apple land does some things better. On the other hand, in my opinion it is really hard to blanket over Android, where more than 2/3 of all phones in the world are running it. By this I do indeed mean that some of those phones bring down the reputation of the OS and some go all out and hammer away at the iPhone
3:51 this shot tho 🫶🏼
Junior interviewing senior be like 😂😂
Weird take on USB C but I want USB C to be more like lightning and be more standardised   USB C cable is not just a usb c cable - some do only charging, some have data, some a great some just plain don’t work   When I buy a cable it should just work   I’m okay with usb c and thunderbolt being the same connector but different- but usb c cables should become more standardised
My daily driver is still s21ultra. Recently I have been thinking of making the switch to iPhone and I think I might do that with iPhone 14Pro.
im surprised how there are 10000000000000000 android companies and whatever but  apple is only one and beats all of them lolp
I want iPhone with Android os
ahhhh Android phone wine because of  finger print.
This looked a lot biased to me ig.
Should have compared Samsung vs apple that's a better debate . There are infinite numbers of android phones lol to a couple apples .
It's good to finally hear you speaking like a normal person rather than with this cinematic accent. :)
iPhone people are like weirdo cultists. Who is THAT obsessed with iMessage and Facetime to the point where they consider them important features? When I switched from iPhone back to Android I didn't miss them at all. They're just message and video chat apps, people. They're literally free to replace. Not to mention I found Duo to be higher quality than Facetime anyways.  Amazing how Apple could easily support any of these apps on Android, which would benefit literally everyone ESPECIALLY their own customers, but they choose not to and somehow they tricked people into not only praising them for it, but also  locked them into continuing to buy iPhones just because of it. 😂Sheep.   Apple wont even support RCS and instead only supports ancient old fashioned SMS which is less secure, yet somehow they've even tricked people into thinking they wont support RCS because they "don't trust that it's secure". What sense does that make? It's literally way more secure and advanced than the stupid old SMS/MMS iPhones revert to when texting an Android.
Good to see S21 ultra as MKBHD's primary camera.
Don't have to watch till the end to know that these chumps will just conclude that "it's personal taste". They will never announce a winner because the world has always split in half when it comes to smartphone OS. How on earth can these guys dare to say otherwise. They have become so popular they don't wanna anger their viewers.
I think where you live matters, ask indians  Most of users are over android,
How are we comparing an iPhone to Android? One is an OS, one is a phone product.
I think it is a paid video, because Samsung deserves to win at most of the point, like camera, screen, fast charging and type c cable
This whole review is fucking trash! Camera to the iphone?!?!? No fuckin way in hell!!!!
the lines from 2:16 to 2:28 cracked me up with all the -ER
😂😂😂 I've stopped watching MKBHD's videos on phone reviews. He is always biased to Apples. It's like they pay them!!!
Alright but in terms of looking at things such as customisation, android is still basically smacking apple in that category. And for everyone saying that apple will add USB-C to iPhones, that's only as the EU is forcing them to and that shall be done in the future. Basically any android you pick up except the really cheap ones have USB-C. So with the fact that phones which cost like half or even less of the iPhone come with USB-C combined with the fact that it's taken the EU forcing apple to add USB-C on their iPhones to get USB-C on the iPhone really says something. Yes I do know of MFI, that just proves my point further.
Let me guess before I start watching (is going to be ios right😒😑)
Didn't know you guys are Apple fan boys
Apple has the lead but Android is shrinking it slowly but on iPad anything that is not an iPad does not exist, at the end of the day competition brings dome prices and the consumer wins.
7.5 to 2.5! wonderfully pathetic!   I would rather pity any novice that will take this comparison to heart!
Well, i'm one of those "few people" who customize their phone, and Android is a clear winner for me.
Really looking at the margin android lost I would say how much  did apple paid u....
how can iphone win the eco thingy... it has a lighting port... and the cable ALWAYS breaks
Nice collab..... But Marcus is somewhat biased to iPhone....
Super interesting. I recently got a pixel 6 pro as a work phone after not having an android phone for about 7 years. Was really excited for Google assistant as I use Siri a lot. But, I've actually found it terrible. It doesn't understand me correctly, even after multiple attempts. It doesn't help me when offline, it's slow and never gets anything right. Was really looking forward to it being better after everyone hyped it up.
idk if a iphone or a samsung is better really a phone is a phone and that's all that matters but the users are why people do phone wars
Marques still waiting for that fist bump after the weird handshake at the end 💀
I am a mobile gamer and I choose Iphone because it doesnt crash or lag. androids could not handle long hours of gameplay.
Is Installing apk important to you? Heck yes!
I can pirate stuff on android. Clear winner 😇
It's not logical to compare iPhone to Android. One's a mobile phone and the other is an operating system. Either compare iOS to Android or iPhone to galaxy or pixel
Bro battery life and fast charging is better on the Samsung's. Gotta give that to Samsung
Android all the way!
Marcus gets paid by Apple.
Fantastic and brilliant in depth video 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Maybe this should have been segmented comparisons. Ultra vs Ultra, Standard vs Standard. Or just iPhone vs Samsung and/or Pixel.
I fw mkbhd but I feel like he always been apple head so putting him on the android side (based off thumbnail) makes me feel like he was waving a white flag the entire time.
I'm a pretty avid Apple user and even I'm not sure I agree with this methodology for comparing Android and Apple. You said you were looking for "Who's doing it better?". Well it seems, then, you take the best of the best from each and see....who's done the best. Instead, however, you took the best of apple (usually the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max), and compared it to all of Android... flagship and value. Of course Apple will win in that scenario.  I think it would have been more fair to take the "best" overall implementation of Android and compare it to the "best" overall implementation of iOS.
The android is better you just want the iPhone to win.I think the Android wins because for me,it's better and it's my opinion.The camera is amazing,IT IS eco-friendly soo..yea
Lol this feels like an american vs a british person
Yeah, the moment you said a draw for the screen comparison, you got that dislike from me. Your material quality is dropping because how iOS biased you both are
"Android does better at this, this and this, but apple has this niche feature that one or two people may appreciate, so points to Apple"
I think MKBHD is mainly focused on the USA community and forgot that the rest of the world is wayyyy bigger than the USA, as you will be surprised at the number of people who values and appreciate what you think is irrelevant. So you shouldn't say small number of people. But Good job though.....
Two billionaires maked one video together
Someone gonna “ALL PHONES ARE BEATIFUL!!”
When you love watching them separately and they do something together  frick this, I love you
Can imessage handle RCS yet?  Apple gets a lose for me because they try to be proprietary rather than adopting tech that others use/pioneer.  Apple also historically makes pretty bad software...  I'll stick with the company that every apple fan uses daily.  Google
Such a subjective and unreal video. Android and iOS equal when we're talking about features and special apps/options etc...? S-pen, split screen, always on display and i could count till tomorrow, and on iOs side imessage. LOL, you guys are joke. iOS is centuries behind android when we're talking about that.
An iphone is only better in my opinion if you are in the apple eco system if not android is king...  Video aside (barely) photos on the s22 ultra the best if you talk reliability i had no issues , i can set a costum butten to go into the camera app in a sec en shoot my pic, Great that iphone has the best battery to bad ur stuck with that lighting port , i charge my android + 10 other divices with the same cable. Easy user experience ? Try changing a setting on the iphone ... Make sure u leave your app go in to the settings app search your settings and change it , id rather change my settings directly in the app like on my android. Iphone has the best unlocking mechanism FACE ID in case a 1 in a million hacker steals your phone  how many times did u had a friend or family member aks u to show your face to unlock the phone fail twice and still needed to enter ur pin anyways ?  Id rather use my androids patern or fingerprint reader. If your not in the apple eco system there is no reason to go for a iphone .. Call me a hater but there honestly isnt ... If the screen on the iphone feels that 0.0000000001 of a second respons better but i have to watch my content with a Piece missing i know what to pick :)
He has an apple watch, bias???
I feel like this is a more bias video due to that guy in the video makes video about mostly apple,, I like how samsung is so much better and he can't even give them a mention you can see his apple love, only compare apple to Samsung, Samsung is the only phone that beats Apple the rest stand no chance Samsung is just a better phone that's why they put the word "android" in the title if they put Samsung the score would be way different
I have a note 9 and would take it every day all day over an iphone. With android i really feel like the phone is truly mine. I have it customized exacly how i want it down to the charging sound. You don get that with an iphone all my frends iphones look the same
3gb of Iphone = 8gb of Android👍
Mkbhd must be high😳 Android screen quality is WAYYY better than IPhone. That’s the only correction I’d make in this comparison.
Arun sucking up for Iphone, again! 🙄😏
Ok....I guess the best would be Samsung VS Apple.....I mean that's fair
So BIAS... SOOOOO BIAS! How is the Iphone just for instance the more eco friendly when they are the most difficult phones to repair from 3rd partys, the only ones with a complete out of the standart charger proprietary (that they will be forced to change in the EU because it creats a bunch of E-Waste) and so much more! Then going to screen... Compairing 60Hz with 120Hz with like 1.5x more backlight and giving the win to Iphone with a mile long bezel... C'mon! xD.
Iphone SE is a waste of money id say, its way behind
Wtf total bullshit
This video made me so so happy!
15:40 Why are scores not being updated?
TWO KINGS🔥IN ONE FRAME....Loved it. Bring more like these BOSS 🤟
I'm taking it as it's your opinion otherwise it's just a horrible video 😂
First time I am actually disappointed with your video. Stopped it literally with the photo comparison because this is too biased.  Screen - clearly Samsung -  don't know what u are talking about xD Battery - yes iPhone..no doubt Power - again iPhone but  giving picture quality seriously to iPhone is like mindblowing  I don't even have to watch the rest of the video to know, that both probably voted for almost everything in favour of the iPhone
How much did apple pay you
This whole conversation is so Apple oriented. There are some clear Android wins which in the name of “consistency” was given to Apple
Never even thought about the lighting :)
Mrwhosetheboss: Subscribe if you liked it Me: 😥 you would always say a subscribe would be….( some strange but great word).
I just have one problem, you are comparing the top iPhone model to all Android phones....you must have considered other models also ❤️
Marques brownlee= worlds biggest apple fan boy.
Kinda weird to seemingly compare an average of androids to the functionally all-flagship lineup of iPhones, but go off.
Was it a sponsored video from Apple 🤣
Great video
Android would've won if it was up to arun
I respect iphone and apple's way of protecting customers BUT this video feels sooooo sponsored by them. Most points should have gone to android phones. Design and features? Samsung. Screens? Samsung and rog phone. Performance and gaming? Rog phone. Battery? Rog phone. Camera? Sony. Price? Xiaomi. USB c cable, price, progression are things that make Apple a big no no for me. The only thing apple excels at is security, nothing more at all. Everything else u can find 10x better in androids collection. Iphones are OK only for Americans as they where entended to be. They are horrible for any other apps in any other country, even if its an official app. Apple doesn't even fix problems with their phones in other countries, even if they are as urgent as bank and payment issues in their own systems. That argument about social media is just pfffft. Android works fine. Iphone and android have their own bugs so that's not even relevant
You nigga Samsung wins no matter
MKBHD looks way too uncomfortable in this video
but can i copy files to my pc?
Used both devices over the years,I feel like iphone are more refined devices.although android offers a lot of customisations but after using them I feel like original ui is always better
NO NEED FOR CO LABS  i wanted fair fair judgment on the These Types of phones  instead we got (MR) WHOBOSS) being a (betta) for 20mins on his own Channel.  instead going back an forth on this topic like most decent professionals do. it was the MRWHOSEBOSS lettings the other opinions of some iPhone shill dictate the scores. even when he reason make no sense other than to him self ... ( bearing in mind you watch these people for there professional opinion. Not to hear an opinion that's non professional an sounds like any of your own friends arguing for the phone. which is exactly what the other guy sounded like.  USELESS INFORMATION THANKS FOR WASTING 20MINS OF LIFE    WITH THIS MEDIOCRE VIDEO..   THAT SOUNDED LIKE A PROFESSIONAL WHO IS JUST LISTENING TO A CHILD RANT ABOUT THERE PHONE.  Not good we didn't need it .  an be more assertive in your colab videos dude. you have real value in your opinion(MRWHOSEBOSS) i think this one got Away from you.. i genuinely wanted to see Two professional Rebuttle each on this Topic but i never got that..   which would actually be more fair..  instead yea.
I guess iphone’s gonna bump up its price for this year launches now 😝
Interesting vid but I think some parts yall being bias
No one:  Mkbhd: matte black
Was this Andriod vs iPhone or Samsung vs iPhone
WELL DONE GUYS 👦 👬 👦 👬 👦
The most fanboy video I’ve ever watched
I totally disagree with blue
Let me guess. Wwdc right?
Even I hardly ever use Split-screen but the Pin to Screen feature on Samsung phones comes in very handy for stuff which can't be copied or just copying numbers from data in calculator.
But gaming always Android
IPhone fan boys  for sure
You guys shouldn’t be reviewing android phones after this video
I would switch to apple only if it supports all google apps, im addicted to Google apps. (Like Google notes, gmail app, etc)
Not hating. I love the videos, but I still think the timeline feature on the left was more captivating. Would love it back
Now I'm changing up my mind... Going for iPhone today itself😁🍎
Me watching the whole video knowing that I can only afford middle range Android phone 🤣🤣🤣
I really loved the collab but I think, with all due respect, that you should have chosen a different topic to discucss with Markes or a different video approach, more like a conversation, I think Markes is more onto that. For example to talk about the differences and similarities of each OS and ecosystem instead of giving points which in some point felt akward because of the confrontation. This also makes Markes looks a "fanboy" and he is actually very literate and I would love to know why he choses iOS or what are they key points when choosing which phone to use or what does he takes in count when reccomending a phone to someone else. Keep up the good work.
iPhone screen is the same level as Samsung screen??!! really guys?? .. oh come on 🤷🏻‍♂️ Smoothness of screen is in the category of performance, screen is all about brightness and sharpness.
Does the Samsung OS have Lock Screen Widgets? My pixel 6 doesn't.
For some reason I thought he was gonna interview apple's CEO...
Ios and iphone is like the Gold standard of mobile. Once u shift to iphone there is no going back. Iphone is iphone and nothing can beat that 👍👍👍
I always knew these guys knew Iphone is the best phone these days.
Seems like a biased review, these guys are iPhone fans 👎
Such a biased Americanised iSheep kind of mentality and very unfair comparison. E.g the display of S22ultra is a generation ahead of Apple
This is Biest
I unfortunatly disagree with most of your arguments
how much did iphone pay you all brooooooooooooooo..........
If I'm to go for a good phone, I'm more likely in the end not to pick an IPhone, I'm not ready to drop super fasting charging, imagine getting charged 1500 dollars and wait for two hours for the shit to get full,I can't be fooled,
i'm the shrinking minority
Mkbhd an apple fan boy so clear
actually the lighting was good sir , i dont know abt others but i liked it
It's always good to see you both collaborating.
I will hand down choose Android over an Iphone any day..
I have an S22 ultra and for some weird reason I prefer the sharp edges of the iPhone.
Mkbhd goes to the dark side...
I think generally iOS is much more reliable than its counterpart which is android.. Android just packs in too much feature which we don't use, rarely use or which we might never use because we don't know it is even there.. But for iOS they offer less feature which most people use..
This is dumb. How could one phone gets compared to thousands of phone? Compare two phones, or compare the two os's
rolf 1side vieuw. dit expect a way depper comparision. based on number not fealings
Android is still much better than Apple. The display should have gone a full point to Android. Also camera is much much better Android than Apple.
Interesting. As said at the end, it really comes down to use cases. I'd like to see a comparison focused on which OS has the best phones for for a collection of common, real world, use cases.  Comparing both lineups on average features just covers User A: Needs all the features equally. Lets also cover users B-K, who depend on certain features, want a few more, and don't care about the rest. As mentioned in the video, there are people who would buy Fairphone without a second thought because it matches their values. Looking at everything as an average grinds down gems like that in the Android world.
I think Marques was a bit too biased on this video, he picked the iPhone for little reasons most people won't relate to
I feel like MKBHD was biased towards iphone
Let's put it this way. MKBHD videos are like iPhones dull and bore but informative and MrWhosetheboss are like android a big variety some times informative but entertaining to watch 😁👍🏾
a phone is a phone to me i used to be all into phones not anymore
I would never buy a iphone ever
MKBHD is very biased. Screen should never have been a draw if compared with the S22 Ultra. Hard to compare Android which is found on many devices against IOS which is made for one specific phone. Very controversial video indeed.
Being an apple user for 4 years then to android for 7 years then back to apple for the last year, I feel that apple just does everything correctly. I feel apple were far behind until the 13pro range but now are totally back in the game. What’s best? Never (if ever rarely) crashes. It just works. When you have you whole Financial life / social media and photography etc. you need it to work all to top efficiency. Apple does this.
They forgot to let everyone know Apple was sponsoring the video 🤣  But really, apple phones are pretty darn good no question but you are stuck with very few models, I prefer android because of the huge selection of models from amazing companies, replacing an apple phone is expensive but if your S22 ultra breaks down you can get a $300 dollar phone to carry for a while before you can purchase another flagship phone, but iphone doesn't have anything good in that range
This Video is clearly based on opinion as far as I can see. Android is clearly the winner because of its amazing OS and hardware.
I agree that iPhones are miles away in certain areas. BUT. The whole reason I despise them is that they don't feel "mine". From the moment you get them it's Apple this and Apple that, the whole ecosystem of Apple is so curated that I hate it. I once formatted my computer through an Android device, I don't think an iPhone user can ever do that.
to the camer category, after half a year of waiting for a fix i still cant take pictures using the instagram camera  good job oneplus
I'm happy with my S21 ultra one year now.
You underestimated the price category. Just price alone can keep me away from iPhone. No matter what feature they provide, I just can't buy them. Android can provide all of iphone's features (in one way or another maybe with a lil bit of tweak) with a greater value for money. So, Android wins. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
A lot of people trying to justify their purchase to random people on the internet... its funny, I laughed a lot reading all these comments...
I switched from a new apple phone to a old android and In my experience android has been much better mainly because of software and pricing.
You  are best
iPhone needs at the very minimum a  CLOSE ALL APPS OPTION!!!!!!
is this to bring us truth or them views?
What a load of fanboy wank! As soon as i seen MB was involved it was scripted from there to be nonsense. Mans a total noob!
Let me be frank. Iphone is not a better phone its just like a 1990 car and then upgrade the motor and lights. Same design same model same software style. And the other problem is apple holders can not think right and they always say its Apple and thats why its better.
I THINK PASSION-FRUIT IS BEST😅
This would be more interesting if they compared just apple and samsung flagships since android has too many options and samsung is the apple of android...someone else could make that video tho lol this one is good (a little hard on android for me tho)
I still choose android🙂
a had samsung and iphone. there are much more bugs using iphone then samsung….
Im watching this vdo on an android...... and im ACTUALLY not felling Better😂
Some of these categories should not be equal to others lol
I am a creative person by essence, that's why I prefer Samsung over iPhone. It's just something special to draw out your pen and sketch or write a conceptual idea down when it's fresh in the mind! Plus, Andriod if not equal isn't that far behind iPhone in every important category
The guy on the left is obviously biast to choose apple like- Even when aron was trying to tell him stuff about android. Like with photography andriod should have gotten that point, just bc one phone had a problem from andriod does not mean their cameras are worse like defend your opinion aron.
This is interview for iphone lover
I actually shifted from Android to Apple because of resale value. I'm curious why that is never taken into account. Maybe it's just me.
GRRR ANDRIOD BETTER APPLE MAKES PHOME SLOW
No matter what, I will Always Pick Android First
I am very disappointed 😐
S22 ultra the best
I just find the iPhone so much better and so much easier to use with more practical features I couldn’t get on android. iPhone will always be a winner to me.
So about software support. I do feel like there's still some nuance. Think of it this way, an old iPhone simply cannot function without the latest update. Lots of apps won't work. Not the same case for android. I could whip out my galaxy S5 and download the latest version of snapchat no issue. Can't do that on an iPhone 5.
Fake review
Okay bye.  after the battery point to iPhone
Mi Share actually does a great job like airdrop though not up to airdrop but close and enough for me
Finally find put a Youtuber muslim like me😍😍
I know the winner is apple. Before seeing the video.
The guy with you is an iPhone fan so all he does is brag about iPhone
I am amazed that this doesn't have a timeline
I've never disagreed more. Anyway, great video 👍😉
I mean android is good but ios is still got little tweaks that makes is better... no offence.
Wait you just said SE has a good value??? Didn't you Review concluded in its trash or do I remember that wrong?
10 for samsung ultra 0 for stupiddd uglyy 13pro max ipnhoe sissy phone
These two couldn't be more biased towards apple if they tried. My my how the mighty have fallen i remember when these two used to be back and forth with iOS apple and Android now there are two hipsters with there iPhones all the time ,with androids all of these things are better camera,screen, efficiency,build quality,charging speed, customisation, AI which is years ahead of siri but then Google home products are far more intelligent than Amazon echos but yet the world seem to go for less with there products and buy Amazon  .iPhone has better battery (but as they said some androids have better but not main stream ones ) ,eco system (again if you went Samsung though it would be even ),video and that's it SHAME ON YOU TWO   I unsubscribed to marques about two years ago now he got to big and I imagine he works for apple, Mr who's the boss I usually just watch his videos about tech and facts more now, like best tech gadgets,battery tech and how big companies like Huawei are and things the things they do things like that.
How about Privacy ?
I think it still boils down to what a person wants on his/her mobile phone, and what they actually value on it. A lot of people just goes with the hype of getting any flagship phone out there and ends up being disappointed because the phone they got does not live up to their expectations.
Im sorry... but Marques is too biased for my taste... 1/3 for apple? that unrealistic. A 4/6 in apples favor sounds appropriate (even tho im android user, and a bit of an apple hater, but credit where credit's due). Mrwhosetheboss stayed way more neutral, even defending android on occasion but still, marquess had the last word. what is that format called? ask a fanboy?
It has been quite some time since Arun had this 'serious' voice. Great job as always guys
Yo bro idk how but i can react with emojis in the comments JUST on this video
Is it just me or is this video a little more dull than usual?
Not trying to be disrespectful here but when we are talking about android, we are talking about android not like the main companies like Samsung. Personally I think gaming goes to Android 100%, the amount of customization there are on Android for gaming is absolutely ridiculous not to mention, Asus, Redmagic absolutely destroys the mobile market when it comes to gaming! And we also have include that android is compatible with almost everything there is whereas iphone isn't. Can we also talk about how there are many phones out there (Android) which have wayy better texture and looks than iphone...like seriously when I holding one of those phones I feel like I'm holding something out of this universe whereas when I'm holding an iphone It just feels like kinda dead with the same design everytime...so yeah I just wanted to point out that when we are talking about android we are NOT talking about like Samsung, Huawei or Vivo or whatever company you are thinking about...android is not like a company that makes phones...it's a...how do I say it...it's a "thing" that phones use to run. So uhm ye, in my opinion android has alot of things way better than iphone including things that u mentioned in the video. I'm not saying you guys are bias but I just think you shouldn't like make Samsung and the other main android phone manufacturers the main object here against iphone. If you are going to talk about android atleast think outside the box.
Lol My Life is A Custom Rom 😂😅 S4 Mini LTE : Android 10 Custom J5 Pro 2017 ; OneUi 2.5
I noticed during the Eco consciousness that no one mentioned the Anti Right to repair of Apple and like the actual going out of their way to prevent repair from shops etc etc. That should be mentioned. Another thing ya I saw someone said USB-C on here and that's just massive! Happy the EU made it mandatory they should do that here in North America too. Also another thing, can I just ask the audience if MKBHD is getting more and More a fanboy of Apple? Like honestly? I've seen him become more and more an Apple worshiper and getting slightly hate more on Android phones than Apple. Just a thought that I've noticed.
I don't care about iMessage or Face Time because I live in Europe and we don't use that shit here.
Lot of people in the comment section is like Samsung has this, Xiaomi has that, OnePlus has this, Oppo has that. Stop. U don't buy different phones for different purposes. U buy one phone at a time as a daily driver. So iPhone is the one who wins easily.
Two tack legends🔥🔥
The chilly vibe of this video almost feels as if sth is wrong😂😂😂😂... Anyways, cool video
2 biggest tech. stars in one frame ❣️
It should be samsung vs iphone because the comparison is mostly samsung not android phones
MKBHD is such an apple fanboi
The biggest win for android is price apple is sooo expensive especially in developing countries and with much lower prices you could get close experience with android.
I think he's obsessed with iphn he didn't even thought for a sec about saying samsungs camera like really??🤣🤣
I'm at a crossroads right now. I've always been an android user and I've had my current Note 9 for three years now. It's a fantastic phone but it's starting to show it's age. My service provider is giving away iPhone 13's for free. I'm considering getting one but I'm unsure if It would be a good fit for me. I have an ipad but I use that exclusively for YouTube and twitch.
Totalt not agree with your point of view on s22 ultra.(android)
Comparing a $600 phones to $2000 phones seems very fair (sarcasm)
🚮🚮🚮🚮🗑🗑
Haven't seen a lousy video like this from any of these two in a VERY long time. How does it make sense to compare iPhone to Android? Either compare the best of iPhone to the best Android phone, which in my opinion is Samsung Galaxy S22 ultra OR compare ios to a certain flavor of Andriod. Android has a LOT of flavors from different phone makers, I'd expect these two at least to know that.
Its unbelievable how this came just on time, yesterday I was at best buy trying to find what ecosystem its better for me as an artist because its really hard to decide between the amazing video camera on the iphone plus procreate on Ipad or the fact that I can draw everywhere with a S22 ultra, plus the SD card slot that the tab s8 has and the s-pen that already comes with it. Thanks a lot for this! I hope you have a wonderful day.
Samsung till the best🤴 Waiting the S23 ultra
When people say "tech giants", i visualise these two people
What about the security features?
Interesting answers from MKBHD - a guy that likes tech, is into tech, spends most of the time with tech, and yet still likes the simplicity of the iPhone (for camera, features and so on).
What about privacy and security?
Anroid is compatible with windows that seals the deal
bro both of you guys are promoting apple
i feel like this is just a "iphone vs the rest" competition. android as an operating system is open and easy to understand. its also modular in range. ios has none of that
I personally think this comparison is flawed. it would've been better to compare a flagship brand of android like Samsung or Pixel to the iPhone. If you're comparing all androids, then they should've won in the battery, eco, photography, screen and some other categories because of how androids have a wider range of phones that iOS. It's a good video but I personally think it could've been better with more specificity, especially in the android department. in the end, it all boils down to preference of the user.
Idk why this video feels like a life lesson
I can't say much about the camera. I don't know how taken pictures do look on iPhones. But I realised that, when it comes to smartphones, the question should be less about the image sensor and megapixels. More important is the images professor (the chip that interpreted the data from the sensor and photoshops those informations to the image you get to see later). For example where images with my P30 pro always over saturated. The other important factor is the screen and his it displays colors. The best photo experience on a smartphones I had on LG phones.
Useless video totally biased
First video with no 'a sub to the channel would be' 😱
the fact that my friends are switching to iphones because they've agreed that the phone they have is pretty shit..- Like I love the customisation of androids and if i still had my android i would of kept it but i'm really happy where I am rn because gaming's super easy lolol
sad day for android fanbois
I think the iPhone being one of the last phones to still have a notch is enough of a reason to lose in the screen comparison
how tf a freaking notched screen with huge bezels bought from samsung is the same as a freaking flagship screen with no bezels, amazing brightness, etc?
I prefer android because it has a more open and flexible operating system compared to ios
THE GOATS 🐐
The views and opinions expressed in this video are not that of Mrwhosetheboss, but are solely that of MKBHD.
They're bashing Android lol
Apple you are locked in and android your not.
How many Joy-Cons do you have?!
s22 ultra is better phone then next 5 iphones on line, what google? They pey you, google is bad product
Apple fanboys good sh$t!!
Arun basicly calls everything a draw or an IPhone win...
USELESS VIDEO ALL THIS VIDEO DID WAS SELL MORE IPHONES.  MRWHOSEBOSS'S GUEST IS A IPHONE LOVER. AT LEAST  MRWHOSEBOSS WAS TRYING TO BE FAIR . OR LEAST COVER  THE TOPIC ON BOTH  SIDES..  WHATEVER HIS NAME IS.. (WAS IPHONE THIS ) (IPHONE THAT ) EVEN WHEN IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.   HENCE WHY THE SCORE WAS SO OUT OF THE SCALE   AN NOT TRUE OF REALITY ON THE  SPECS OF THE PHONES.  SO I WOULD RECOMMEND MRWHOSEBOSS  OVER THE OTHER GUY HE ACTUALLY PROFESSIONALLY ANALYSES THE PHONES  not sure what the other guy doing other than Sounding like a iPhone Rep   i leaned nothing.  it was just some guys opinion on iphones basically.  don't bring this guy on here again unless  you want to sell iPhones
Answer - ANDROID
By rule of logic, anytime you say, "I prefer..." you should only consider that a preference, not a feature.
Y marcus  always says apple is best ...in reality androids are very  versatile...
I love how u just never get bored no matter how long the video is
About the battery on Android, here with an S21Ultra battery lasts more than a day normal usage with some gaming.
You should ve been with me sweet drama queen
Plz
Hey bro
Why is there everywhere this complaining about no Airdrop equivalent for Android? No one heard about Quick Share? No? Nearby Share? No? So Nearby Share is not that good, but Quick Share is absolutely in line with Airdrop
I came here to see the arguments in the comments section.
I love iphone but having a lot of affordables andtoid phones, now getting the jump to a midrange samsung and how samsung ecosystem is better. I think the transition from a budget xiaomi/motorola to a midrange samsung its smoother . For example getting from a Poco X3 to a samsung a53 or a73 its smoother than the jump from a Poco x3 to an iphone 12.
I use a 13 mini for the camera and work, but keep a midrange samsung a22 with great battery life for entertainment and regular use. Both have their pros and cons. I brought A basic iphone and midrange android instead one highest end flagship of either gives me kind of the best of both worlds. It really works for me.
Android Forever 😅
Love both of you.
My two favorite  tech guys.
Although I personally would never touch an iPhone and disagree mostly with this video, I am appreciative of how far they have come. I have always wanted an android phone as polished as an iPhone.
Software update for a longer period in iPhone is good but now I hear that some features will only be available in some models. It can be argued that some hardware doesn’t support certain software features but that may not hold good for a few missing features.
Would you like to mention why apple keeps changing the charging cable and at the same time quit sending a charger in the box? Lets consider both platforms like" who scams customers less?" next time. Then I may even think that you haven't both apple stocks or you don't have some sort of interest. I do accuse both of you guys until you start to talk about the negative sides of iphone.
In a personal perception Iphone arent better against Every Android phone in their personal strength like in display being objective the samsung display is better, in performance the gaming phones should technically be better, in battery life the same if isn´t used for gaming. In night mode I believe there´s a Vivo phone that´s better o pixel in some cases, in dalight it becomes to the details or perception in ultrawide maybe the Oppo I feel the design could algo go to Oppo, software it could be more tied o personal choice and to video Iphone is top notch but there are good contenders. And the only things that Iphone can´t compete are in charging and also that Samsung, Iphone, Pixel took away the charging brick and it lead to people having to buy a new one that could pottentioly affect enviornment unless you already belong to there ecosistem and already have bricks or a magsafe but if they increase the charging capacity or maybe the port someday it demands the customer to buy a charger that leads to affect the enviorment cus they dont incluide it to you.  Overall the Iphone fells like the perfect well rounded phone that competes in every category despite it´s price and in Android there are phones that are top notch in there personal strenght but that lacks in other categories. So to the overall user that want a high end phone the iphone is better cus the well rounded it feels in every category.
Marques looking jacked
Most of these categories are extremely subjective tbh and someone else could easily have flipped the scores. But at the end of the day it's about what's important to you. Most of the positives for iPhone are just not relevant to me so I wouldn't buy one. And personally I think the freedom of Android is priceless, I can't stand the idea of being unable to install an app if it isn't approved in the store.  Also I just want to say I would have given the eco friendly to Android. Yes using recycled materials and going carbon neutral is cool and all but apple is so anti repair that they more than balance it out. This bleeds into the software support category as well, sure 5 years is nice but if you damage it you're gonna end up replacing it for the newer model anyway.
Bruv . .android wins most of it all  I'm an iPhone user But you see Samsung..bruv ..don't dare
Android phones are good and we need the competition, but I use an Iphone cause I want something reliable. When i was younger I really liked to fiddle around with all sorts of customization, but nowadays I just need it to work. :D (Seems like an apple slogan xD) Only drawback is the apple tax.
Android had 2 points that wasn't added. They definitely have better software features
9000
others device samsung smartphone
Wow... Could Marques be ANY LESS enthusiastic to talk about this???
I was disappointed that the ecosystem wasn't really addressed.  I have a friend with a huge mp3 library on his android that he cannot put on a iphone, and I do something similar with movies.
2022 and iPhone 14 doesn't have "Always on display" is a blasphemy
Android users just shut up forever now.
Team iPhone. (but I also love Android haha)
Bro apple is better
What a load of Bullshit...😅😅 I am an Apple fan...and I like both these YouTubers....but this video is biased as hell.
You and mkbhd sold yourself to apple
I switched from an LG G6 to a iPhone 12 mini last year and everything is just much better
Don't care wish one is better Samsung is cheap
I swear every video I see about iPhone vs Android ends with, "At the end of the day it depends on what you prefer"
Damn i really wanted this video android and iphone have come a long way but i feel that you both vere really well paid by apple for this video thank you.
Would you like to consider repairability in the next episode as well? Saving the nature without repairing the damaged device by yourself, sounds not so funny! And we all know how much apple is charging for even a relatively small repair.
one thing is sure that marques is a apple fan boy... he literally buys anything that apple makes even if its completely useless
I hear the whole "Apple waits to get the feature right and bests the competition at it" explanation a lot. I agree with it quite often. But by the time this Ipad calculator app comes out it better be able to replace the turbo tax app...  😅
In terms of battery life in my eyes it is a win for android. I didn't had an iPhone yet but I had the P30 Pro and the Pixel 6 and both are absolute incredibly when it comes to the battery. With all other phones I struggled to get through a day but with those 2 phones I check the percentage once in the morning and then basically forget about it for the rest of the day. Even though both phones don't really have more battery then other phones. (Means that it is 90% a software thing how long your phone can last.) But the P30 pro was even more crazy. When fully charged (normally I keep my phone between 20 and 80 percent) it could even survive the next day when I forgot to charge it over night.  And that's the next point: Charging  The Pixel 6 has just an average charging speed but the P30 pro was fast. 30 minutes could fill almost half the battery. That phone charged so quick that I stopped charging over night and just plugged it in when it started to run low (under 20 or 15 %). I never needed to charge that phone for longer than an hour.  The Pixel 6 isn't as fast but that's because the fastest charger is in general the one cable and plug combination that came with the phone and the 6 comes without a plug.
The battery one was supposed to go to android
I am gonna unsubscribe your channel after watching this video
Fake
A few things to consider, Apple with IPhones is much preferable for most people because of usability or is more user-friendly if you will ( it comes with a catch, which is??? To lock 🔐 U in their Eco-system precisely, who doesn’t agree with this?) think about its good business strategy from the genesis this has always being Apple ultimate goal lock U in with all the i’s🤫   When it comes to technicality though, it all boils down to personal preferences, which has to do so more with subjective personal experience, also one thing to always keep in mind is that no smartphone on a market today before and right now in 2022 is perfect, a better word completely perfect perhaps there is always pros and cons and not all reviews on these YouTube streets are legit, some speak on mainly what they prefer or choose at first glance others make fair judgment with their reviews not a lot though if it’s about getting subs or making that cash app get lots of notifications hey🤷🏿‍♂️ I ain’t mad at you, however people will always appreciate reviews that are authentic and fair considering all possibilities thus cons and pros respectively. What has enhanced the video and photo experience over all is these adaptive lens such as Moment Lens which are leading in the game of lens for smartphone in my humble opinion. Also Apple is more well rounded and equipped as they have a chip specifically designed for their smartphone (I-phone) which plays a big role in optimization and software functionality if Samsung can invest in that at least just for their S-series it would be a game-changer very interesting to see this come to fruition in years to come with the way Tech is progressing lately (exciting times) well that is all am gonna say. And also Improvement in apps computability and compatibility which is something Apple does very well for iPhones in IOS usually which is also what most people care about lets be honest, and the very basic reason is favorable over Samsung for some reason that applies to the people that make such choices.
I think the point that was made about how Android still has options that cater to small niches, while Apple has clear staples of its experience, is a clear win for Android. Apple's offerings there still largely only matter to people who are within the Apple ecosystem, and require other users to also be a part of that ecosystem to function at their fullest. The fact that Android still caters toward small niches of people who need a particular feature of the software to remain active makes them far more backwards compatible, more openly compatible with other ecosystems, and overall improve the broader experience for more users.
What about security, spyware, file support, media consumption or flexibility?
Clearly a bias going on here. You have more exposure to phones since we are capped in the US with the availability of carriers supporting all of the super legit Chinese brands....so yeah Android was definitely shafted here
Nah we all know iPhone is the best
If you consider the cost at which Android offering those features...Android is clear winner 🏆🏆🏆
LDAC on android, iOS stuck with AAC
It's  so interesting to see MKBHD become an iSheep
You were with Mark Rober werent u
When you are filming a comparison sitting on Apple Headquarters,  Yes, you are a little bit biased
For me, using gestures in nova launcher is why I'm using only Android 😂
This is very poorly made.
I thought you've previously mentioned how environmentally bad to ship a charger in a separate box. It is good for apple and bad for both the environment and the user. And the environmentally friendly one is the iPhone? Are you guys getting paid from Apple?
You ruined my life.
For me its only Samsung period I love notes I had every single one even the ( note/s22 ultra ) that I have now even though my work phone its an iPhone
I am a huge fan of both of you guys. And Finally saw both of you together. This is how friends, collaboration works. Your Die hard fan. 😍
It makes sense, but I think it's kinda sad that MKBHD considers using a one year old phone an achievement. Consumerism is mad.
This ain’t fair, to the iPhone! The iPhone had to single handed go up against all androids. That’s not fair. Just have iPhone fight Samsung, not agains all of them. Yes iPhone won but if this was fair, iPhone would’ve won more. Remember when the Samsung was a bomb?
I think title should be difference between iPhone 13 pro max vs S22 Ultra, because you just compare the difference of android and iOS just between these two phones ,
All the Android fanboys can’t take the clear loss. Stop complaining. These guys are hundreds of times more experienced in phones than you.
Android is just better. There shouldn't be a discussion about it. And the title shoud be with iOS not iPhone. You can't compare an OS with a brand.
Now we’re also doing one company vs all android phones
If I get an iPhone, I'll definitely throw this sh.. in Garbage. Different Charger, everything on cloud, over rated Safari browser, restrictions on Sharing options.... It all sucks.😏
Jesus 5 mintues in and you've already made excuses for Iphone giving them points for no reason! I'm sorry but you can't award any points for the screen if the other one has better options, even if they're in the top ranks. And the charging vs. better battery? You give two good points to Android (there are phones that do have better battery and then there's the charging) and yet you still give it to iPhone? Cmon
Apple will always win
About the customization I hatted that part that you gave props to ios... They see what works on the androids and then steal that and improve on it... It's not the apple that used to be with steve jobs, you know about Innovation and taking risks...
this is not at all genuine video , seeing good things only in iPhone nd not thinking about android
For an enterprise purchasing choice I would choose android, because of the variability, I can choose the phone with the features our business needs and save costs on a larger scale.
I went android since my dodgy iPhone 6 and haven't gone back looked at the iPhone 13 pro max but it's sharp edges, notch and a few other things put me off. + With Android I can do what I want with it
I use multi window screen on my Android
good stuff guys👍
I think another plus for me is the expandable memory of android phones that are not available in Iphone.
I miss sideloading in my iphone I have to change to different country every-time i want to download something that is banned in my country so that seriously sucks
This is not Android vs i phone., it's iPhone 13 pro max vs every other android phones and surprisingly 13 Pro max won.. So., go right ahead and buy an iPhone 13 Pro max (if you can afford)
iPhone is nothing more than overpriced rubbish for the rich numbnuts in this world who wouldn't know a good product if it bit them on the ass besides Android has more to offer
Idk what magic iphone you guys have used but samsung has ALWAYS had better battery when it comes to battery testing plus iphone is too restrictive in their security protocals up to a point where you cant do anything like watch free movies,tv shows,books,read manga and watch movies for free and they allow apk file downloads which on iphone for the past like 6-7 yeard i dont even thing has been possible
on features i am the opposite. I see it as with things like facetime and I message, I have other apps that can do pretty much the same thing. Samsung Dex is super important to me and I use it almost every day for school. I also use it at home, if I'm gaming or something on my laptop, i'm running dex on a second monitor to watch movies and such. It's been a long time since I have had an Iphone, but for the past 7ish years never once have I said "i wish I still had an Iphone. But that could possibly change when I upgrade my phone because I know new samsungs don't have headphone jacks or expandable storage like my s10+ does, which are major factors in why i prefer samsung over apple.
I still love android
I must say that I found the content unfair and one sided. I would expect better from you guys, disappointing, sorry.
Imo this was heavily influenced by marques, he seemed quite biased, while Arun stayed neutral the whole time, checking every point fairly
You two are the top of tech reviews love your collaboration
MBHD  iPhone 😂 This one also iPhone Definitely iPhone Hmmmmm what actually apple does to him 😂
Just two nerds talking about technology. Love it.
Headphone jack
Not giving the features to android is a bad take imo, especially if you're primarily comparing Samsung vs Apple. The whole thing about android phones is with a little tweaking, adjusting some settings, your experience can be a lot better than an Iphone. The Iphone requieres you to swipe up after scanning your face for example, something you can turn on/off on most android phones. That's an extra swipe every time you unlock your phone.
At least this was a great video by IPhone lovers, if I wasn't mistaken it felt like they said "I love iPhone and I love iphone" I'm sure if we had the video made by a Android  lover they would say "I love android and I love android ".
This collaboration is phenomenal 👌👏❤️
Title should have been android vs ios
I recently switched over to android after using iPhone all my life and honestly despite all the features of Android I really miss iPhone. My android experience has been riddled with constant lag, horrible shutter delays while taking pictures causing me to miss shots, weak vibration causing me to miss constant phone calls and texts, and a lottttt of app crashing. It could just be my s22 ultra and could be fixed with a software update but either way it just hasn't been the best experience. And i miss imessage and just the fluidity of the ios experience and ecosystem.
How can you overlook the provable bullshit of Apple excluding a charger “for the planet” whereas it’s actually significantly worse for the environment because they know people buy a charger too so they earn more from it and the extra truck transport contributes so much more pollution.
I love them both, but they are WAY TOO BIASED towards Apple to a point that it's almost disgusting
Love this video. You guys work well together. We need more of you two together. Great content. You guys ROCK. Here is my take, The Ecosystem is big for me, as I am using all different types of devices throughout the day, and being able to switch between things is very helpful. I love the customization of an android, but sometimes I just want the phone to work, and iPhone and its simplicity make a difference. I also manage my entire family's Tech support, so having one ecosystem helps. This is funny cause I always want to get a Samsung, but I think about my IPAD, my Macbook Pro, my apple heads phones, and my apple watch, and you can't beat how they work together. None the less a great video.
amazing video
Hardware and Repair?  Not included?
You've just compared apples to oranges. Android is an OS and iPhone is a device. This is a huge mistake for two of the most prominent YouTube tech personalities. The whole video is a farce, comparing what? Either compare the two operating systems or two opposing flagships. It baffles my mind on the scale of the incompetence.
Bs
both iPhone 13 and samsung galaxy s22 ultra are overly expensive nonsensical phones to buy, with little and no difference from the mid rangers for practical usability of the phone
I feel like overall effect on the industry/world should also be considered for sustainability. Because the industry copies Apple on these anti-consumer changes, this means Apple directly caused people to buy new headphones when they removed the jack. They caused people to create tons of shipping waste when they removed the charger. They caused people to have to buy new phones rather than simply replace a battery or an SD card. On the positive side for Apple is that as far as firmware is concerned, their phones tend to last longer which means if the battery survives you can buy new phones less often. Android has been making huge strides in this the past few years though.
As someone who has being using smartphones since the mid 00’s and as someone who considers themselves as an amateur tech enthusiast. I would say iOS is better, I don’t say that lightly or because I’m some kind of fan boy, I currently own both a iPhone 13pro and and s22 ultra, but in my opinion unless someone hates apple or has a very specific need iPhones are better for almost 90% of people. You just can’t go wrong with iPhones, they have a best in class for every available category which is actually an incredible feat, because it wasn’t always like that and just do whatever you need it to when you need it, and well in my opinion that has probably been then case since 2017/18.
To me widgets are dumb on both phones
Mkbhd is apple sheep 🐑 what did u expect?
Apple are catching up to the customisation because you can now edit the lock screen? Give over 😂
I think it’s pretty much about what’s best for you and your lifestyle. I prefer Apple/iOS because I think they look better than Android and their operating systems. And also the ecosystem within Apple and their products is just *chef’s kiss*.
Damn you really skipped the rotating timer thing. Already missing it
Pretty biased video
The 'editing desk' at the end is just Arun's kitchen? 😁
Guys... you both are youtubers. It is not reliable comparison... You just use MacBooks and iPhones for "work". It would be fair if this comparison will be prepared by engineers
This should have been the best Android phone right now against the latest iPhone right now
I haven't finished watching the video at all but this is almost a Marques interview but the issue with that is he's an Apple fan. So he'd just prefer it more.  He tries to be as unbiased as he can but you can't disagree he is still biased.
I believe android is the winner coz of a couple reasons 1)i'm cheap and dont wanna spend money on features that i get for free on android 2)all the core features that iphones have, android(particularly samsung) is doing it better 3)google assistant 4)customization 5)better camera And so many more
Perfect phone I phone 13 pro max &Need More Features S22 Ultra….i phone is Toyota &Samsung Is Ford
Even if this comparison is done in heaven.... I will chose ANDROID everyday
How can screens be a draw?? Samsung makes iPhone's screens??? 🤔
I have a iPhone 13 mini that I use for work because its so small and does everything I need on a job site, It's also great to slip in a pocket if going to the beach or traveling to places where its best to keep your valuables hidden.  I also have a Samsung S21 Ultra, I love the screen, the size of it is taller and skinnier than the iPhone max which makes it easy to hold! The S21 still feels new even being almost 2 years old!
Not a Samsung fanatic, but I don't see any logical reason to dump my s22 ultra for even iphone 14 that is yet to be released because I have used both iphone and Samsung, People just think holding an iphone makes them special which we don't subscribe to.
It’s funny because the people who watch videos like this probably are mostly android users who DO benefit from those niche features that android gives you. For most people though they’re going to get a better experience from and iPhone because it’s better more easily.
Honestly if you've been following Marques for years now. You can already predict what he is going to choose. When ever the question arose, he almost always answers the way i assume he would.
The Samsung display is brighter, sharper and has no notch. A draw. You don't have to understand, do you?
Apple marketing
I agree with you guys, expecting more videos like these.
Biggest advantage of Android that no one talks about - Cheap Phones. Not everyone and every market have the ability to buy flagships.
He is simply apple fan. And no point of arguing with him I guess
Imo depends on how deep you are within iPhone ecosystem. The new ios looks cool but I'd never get an iPhone personality. Maybe when they were the first smart phone but in 2022 nah
To me, Android's better just because of how universal it is... you can pretty much do anything you want on it without restriction, unlike the iPhone. The freedom to download apps besides the play store, the freedom to customize and tweak settings as you please, the freedom to open and edit documents without hassle, the freedom to send and receive files (music, photos, apps... pretty much anything) from any device whether it's a laptop, mac, iPhone, or other android phones, the freedom to play with built-in features that just doesn't exist on the iphone. That's what makes Android better for me, it just feels unrestrictive.
Android all the way
Android vs iPhone??? Shouldn't have been vs  iOS?
Android now has near by share that is like airdrop, and works across different android OEMs and with Chromebooks
I think it's interesting how Marques gave the win to iPhone for most stuff but still chooses to use the Samsung S21 Ultra as his daily driver.
Android obviously as you can download apps from 3rd party sources (aka paid apps for free) 😂
In your opinion.  One is not better than the other.
First time Arun bro be like, WHATTT? (GOOD video brothers). My opinion is that both phones are getting better but pricing is increasing.
And here im using 4 years old mobile
In android you download lots of movies and tv shows for free you can do that in iphone 😂😂😂😂😂
I think you have skipped what for me is one of the most important categories.  I can plug my Samsung into a computer and manipulate all the files, add photos, music, share files, etc.  Apple allows some restricted manipulation of photos, and nothing else.  A real plus for Android.  If somebody knows an app that allows manipulation of iphone files on a computer, please let me know.
Come on android is doing the most I think android is better😗
Type C ? Repairbility ? Extendable Storage ? Dual Sim ?
I agree with the vibration thing
I don't know how much iPhone pay him! Totally bullshit interview 👎
Android Vs iOS 😎
I would also like to add that Android has support for more apps. they often come out a few weeks later on Android, but they're supported by the OS for much longer and if the apps in the Playstore (already more than in the Appstore) aren't enough for you, you can always just go with sideloading.
No chargers in the box,no support for universal charging port creates more e-waste than android phones since most of them come with an inbox chargers and  use either microusb or a type c port.
this video is just angled towards the usa market
What is that hearth at the bottom right of the comments?
The first nine minutes android was getting demolished
Need more of these collabs guys, cheers !
Do the same comparison 4 years later with the same phones.
Well i dont know what you say but android is and always will better than an iphone
Either this new guy is iPhone promoter or stupid with his logic.... iPhone sucks in most of the stuff they mentioned
mkbhd is an iphone guy
Having Marques in Apple vs Android debate makes no sense... he clearly has a bias towards apple in every scenario. At this you could even called for TIM COOK to appear for your video and that would have  made same sense as it is now.
first time feeling that this video is biased
A great insight from you two 👍 I just got my first iPhone 13 mini, and I should just weigh more on it's very capable scales. Battery, camera, and smooth sailing performance.  Very few *nah, not today* moments compared to a couple of androids I have used, and I'm glad that it's worth the buy in the end.  Looking forward to future videos. Don't worry about the lighting of the last-minute, urgent video...also hope you got your sleep schedule check😅 I'm sure it was on your list of a better you
8:20 such an interesting conversation. It’s actually part of the reason I moved back to iPhone because I found all the new “toys“ and android software were just such a distraction and a time waster for me. Initially it was boring, but going back to the iPhone I started to treat my phone it’s just a tool that does what it does, and it’s easier for me to put it down and forget about it, stop tinkering, just get things done. I guess the only thing I do tinker with on the iPhone is always thinking about new shortcuts I can create to automate.
I agree with most of the list, but for eco friendly, should you really promote apple? Yeah iphone is 20% recycled but what about the waste thats caused because the replacement parts are so expensive? Yeah they have long software support but if you break your back glass its 300usd to which most people just buy a new one
Android equals to freedom but Apple equals to captivity.
idk what to say other than it's completely rigged, even if the android got 7.5 and the iphone got 2.5 i would still say that it's rigged there is no way that any of them is 3x better than the other, at the end of the day the majority of the sales globally is still for Android, i think it's around 68% android and 32% iphones
Super based as android>apple in alot of things
screen goes to android defenitely. Apple took 2 generations to adopt high refresh screens
the negativity that we  hear  is cause that ,  ur frnd is an apple worshiper nd he loves apple products , we can say this by just lookin at his face itself anf=d the way he jus says apple is best class.
"MATTE BLACK EVERYTHING" - oyu've got me there!!! 🖤
You and Marquees videos are always exciting to watch. I do believe the iPhone is the better choice anyways.
That was the most "click bait" thumbnail ever, at least I clicked right away after reading who is the creator :)
Lmao Android fam.chill guys we all have our favorite phones whereas there is only one iphone so it'd easy to generalize but still even if we put up every single OEM against apple they would still have the edge apple is more than the sum of it's parts of Android
Agreed
I used iPhone 13 Pro for Six months but somehow I shifted to S22 Ultra and believe that shift was worth it
About the features point  All the features you mentioned are only usable when you have alot of people using iphone in youre life other way it going to be useless  me for example I do not know alot of people who use iphone  Android features on the other hand is usable as you like or  want it And for rog phone I thing every single person who thinks to buy this phone is going to use its gaming features 🙃
Display Category should've been Android hands down, Battery Category should've been a draw as per the nuances that the battle included in those 2  Categories.
Out of the mouths of top two tech reviewers on the net, iPhone is the superior phone!   iPhone > Android!
I was a life long android user until I switched over to the iPhone 13 mini. everything about the iPhone is more reliable from battery , camera and software. The iOS ecosystem is also un matched. No android phone maker offers a real MacBook competitor.
caap
Them giving a draw on features is mind boggling
i dont understand why Android Smartphone maker trying to make their devices closer in comparison with iPhones in terms of hardware ( removal of sd slot and Headphone Jack ). Its their image and that's what people buying them for , now its like their own customers at this point
With Iphone becoming bit by bit more customizable, and with their futuristic mentality they are adding quantity while already having quality. This is what I think keeps them one step ahead from their competitors almost all the time. Adding their ecological and new repairability initiatives they for sure are trying to get even more ahead than they already are.
If modding becomes a thing on ios im converting to an iphone use in an instant
Android power.
gg
5 Android    6 iPhone  Would be my score.
It’s good the iPhone won bc iMessage and FaceTime are huge reasons for sticking with iPhones along with the ecosystem and Apple apps and Google app integration tbh. 👌🏾🆒
Seems to be more Samsung vs iPhone. I think Android vs iOS would have been a better video.  That harkens back to when the arguments got really heated back in the day.
When Arun reached California his mind went blank about android 😐
hi
I disagree with the draw on the customisation, Android just offers more and you can do more with it, I've had an Android for years now and I can't see a point in Iphone drawing with Android in Customisation
We all know Apple slows the phone after every update.
Marques not objective, Apple fanboy :/
Wake tf up android manufacturers
iPhone pictures are KOOL depending on what value the phone does to make you make like that particular phone 😉📱
Why i don't watch MKHD the reason is he is always baised i unsubscribe his channel some years back
Mr whose the boss is clearly biased.  There is no argument. and I have never felt this way from ever since I have been watching your vedioes, and I have been doing that since you were much smaller than you are now. Your comments and statements are  exactly opposite to what you have said before in this very channel ( You had said a faster charging is better as ling as the phone lasts 6+ hours as that's what most people need, how s22 ultras cameras are better than iPhone 13 pro max in almost everything etc.)  even when MKBHD pointed out things that are better in android, you just made it biased again. LIKE WHO COUNTS FACE TIME AND IMESSAGES AS FEATURES?   It feels like you are sponsored my Apple, but restricted from saying it out loud. Maybe you are going down the same road as unbox therapy did when he got big, and its sad to leave, as I have been a fan of you since 2018 when you were still growing.
5th topic, i completly disagree,  right to repair is the best way for a sustainable environment, and apple doesn't do that... compare to android
Not really a fair comparison because people use their phone for different purposes. I use my foldable phone, something that an iPhone can't do. I use split screen multitasking, s pen which iPhones can't do. I've charged other iPhones from my phone, something an iPhone can't do. For me android is better than iPhone.
jesus christ mqbhd is boring/dry af in this video yawn
You guys should even be lucky that YouTube removed the dislike button.😂
You picked that feature of iPhone so that u can forcefully give plus point to iphone
2:7?!?!?!?!?!?! WHYYYY
Is split screen joke to you? This feature saves a lot of time. Besides iPhone doesn’t promote customization which is a big factor to a tech lover persons. Besides iPhone will never beat Android in Photography, reliability can't be excuse for making iPhone win this category.  IPhone is good undoubtedly, everybody knows that. But iPhone can't make such a gap comparing to android I think.
MKBHD looks shy 🙈 with MRwhosetheboss ?lol 🤣
There are 2 reasons why I like Android over iPhone. First, I am no longer invested in the Apple ecosystem. Because of that, Android just communicates with my windows computer better than an iPhone will. I also acknowledge that iPhone communicates better with Mac than Android, but as stated, I don't own any Apple products anymore. Second, the Apple app store has much more restrictive ToS than Google Play. Now, I get the point of having a more restrictive ToS, but that stricter ToS prevents apps like NVIDIA's GeForce Now app from ever reaching Apple's app store... unless Apple relaxes their ToS. Now, before you go bitching about being fine with a looser ToS, I believe in a few things. First, as long as you are smart about what you let on your phone, regardless of which operating system you use, there is a lesser chance of installing malware. Second, while very much less likely to include malware, you can still get it on an Apple device through an app. Just because it is very difficult and won't last long doesn't mean it is impossible.
You guys are great but very out of touch with most of the world and most people who use their phones. Getting very rich and elitest now
I will never going to get a I phone over the Android smartphone 📱
biased as fuck
Wait how did iPhone win? who paid you??
Safari ever will be better android such your contact list and trown on your memory all these to fuk u . Iphone become in the cloud … aways better
THE iPhone is more ecofriendly with lightening .......? That is worse than all the recicled matterial they use in all phones lol
There is roughly ist named shere smt
7:10 spot on.  I’ve only ever on Samsung Phones or iPhones, so I can’t speak to other androids. But my observation going from iPhone, to Samsung, and back to iPhone is that I can always rely on my iPhone camera. I had so many moments on my Samsung phones where I tried to pull up the app really quickly and something just went wrong and I couldn’t get the shot in time. Maybe a Samsung software issue, But I consistently had issues where I take the photo and it just didn’t save for some reason, or the camera app crapped the bed and just close and reopened.  Not saying it’s never happened on an iPhone but it’s pretty rare.
And you both assessed software based on face time iMessage etc and don't talk about any feature that people like in android the biggest one is Bluetooth and access that are not available on play store like vanced YouTube
If you don’t care about  customization and only communication: iphone  if you like the ability to customize in every way through different brand options, widgets, etc. android
Sheesh !! I don't like the numbers for Android😑
This is very misleading. I live in Jamaica and iphone is shit here and we have the latest versions. Android is king outside of America
Android flagships should do a lot better for the money they are asking for, compared to iPhones
Awesome video! 🤘😎
I have to add one thing. All the iphone unique features are not used in europe. That point would definitely go to android here
Tesla is better :))
I had a 500-word explanation to why most of your points were incorrect but accidentally clicked on a different video will going through my sources... My conclusion was something like this: Stop thinking the entire world behaves like the US... You are both heavily entrenched in Apple's walled garden. Get out before your judgment gets too clouded...
waiting for Samsung vs iPhone
Very flawed argument. Environmental for example, you should have included repairability and sustainability of apple products. Photography, apple is good for average, but android phones can do things apple can't even touch, long zooms, thermal vision, manual/raw shooting.  Air drop is something android is doing offline  via wifi and bluetooth. Try sharing images or mp3s on apple.  Sorry guys but you were very biased.
Samsung lost a lot of points with the removal of headphones jack, extended memory, removable battery, lack of charger in the box, and others that help Apple look like a not compelling case to others
a great Video
a seamless way to transfer stuff from device to device is a must... Airdrop is king for that
It depends on your daily desires 100%
wow. even i can see the positive difference youve made in your transformation! amazing job. keep it up!
Looking at all the comments it's safe to say the public prefer Android over ios. Seems like there's a bias towards iphone from the both of you.
this video was so biased towards the iphone. even the way questions are phrased and the questions can be answered in many different ways which always end up being counted in the view which iphone wins.  Also this wasn't a android vs the iphone video this was an iphone vs andoird phones video. comparing the both OS by itsleves is a whole different thing
you 2 need to start a podcast
Very good video man I agree about everything with MKBHD and I'm android user.. and don't know for how long..
I soo needed this video. Always been a devout android user and was finally thinking to switch. Kinda justifies my itch now.....
Android is best.
Why is MKBHD so weird here? 👀
IOS is better than Android.  This comes form someone who carries an Iphone and a Pixel daily.  If I had to pick one, its not difficult at all, the iphone wins.
This video greatly overshadowed Google's ecosystem you get with androids.
Why are you collabing with an iSheep for it tho?
Multiwindow does really help like when im copying text from another doc when i cant copy and p in p is awesome when almost all apps can do it on samsung and alot of androids
If i summaries your video you both ranked camera because promptly capture photos are u both in ur senses
Watched 5 mins of the video and realised something. I have to give apple credit, but not for the reasons you may think, yes they unveil and adopt features far later than android do, but they take their time to perfect it or get close to perfection. I'm a heavy android user btw, I'll pick a Samsung phone up every year regardless because I FEEL most comfortable with it and enjoy the full usability and all features that come with it plus design etc. BUT that being said, credit has to be given to apple. Yes, android lacks in a lot of compartments, yes apple one up android multiple times, but I'd still pick an android over an ios device purely due to ios devices being boring, and by boring I mean lack of versatility and variety. But that's just my two pence, both are equally amazing.
Dude I am huge fan of yours for like 4 years now but still I'll have to say that MKBHD was so much biased towards iPhone. Why didn't you just corrected him because the disappointment and surprise on your face is real. Sorry I had to say this but MKBHD being partial just spoiled the video completely.
I don't care what my phone looks like on the backside or the edge of the glass on the front. I just need a flat display surface not bend around any edge or corner. And the phone must not wobble while laying on the table. Like with the LG V30 or the Pixel 6.  For me that means that I will most likely never buy an iPhone because of the camera bump alone.
Mkbhd is obsessed with iphone that's why he makes Android inferior
This video was sponsored by Apple.
5:10 Also when battery life degrades overtime, having fast charging is key. However, I think there is some evidence that fast charging Actually accelerates degradation of battery life so it’s both the cure And the curse
Look I will only use Android I just don't like iPhones
Android Provides Killer appS (look at the capital letters 😉). Clear winner for that reason alone!
I think people commenting here would be more android users and supporters because android users watch videos like this and research about their products before and after they buy. iPhone users just buy because it's an iPhone, they don't watch videos like this and just mindlessly buy (mainly though financing 🤣). They are too busy on Instagram. 🤣
The split window is actually quite useful
honestly this video shudve been different, android vs iPhone doesn't make much sense, shudve been samsung vs apple, or google vs apple, or any other, because android varies so much from phone to phone and ios also kinda varies (lightly) from different iPhone versions.
A better video would have been iPhone vs Samsung. It’s so hard to mark a one to one comparison especially since they are thousands of android phones out there.
Making video with a 🍎 fanboy on this topic 🤣
Moral: make your own choice
DON'T COMPARE APPLE AND ALL ANDROID,  COMPARE APPLE VS SAMSUNG.  SAMSUNG KILLS APPLE IN SO MANY WAYS.
show me your griddy
The comparison is wrong because its turn from android vs ios to iphone vs random phones  If you are going to talk about hardware you should choose  specific android phone  If you are going to talk about software you can talk generally
Do not know anyone with a iPhone no more .
Android 2007-2022 Murdered by Mrwhoistheboss & MKBHD🙂💔
Android camera on 3rd party apps such as Snapchat and Instagram is awful
DC meets MARVEL 😎
iPhone 💩💩💩💩💩
but most apple phones are mainly made up of Samsung and Nokia parts
This is clear case of corruption. How much bro?
I use Samsung split screen almost every day.  Playing a mobile game while watching YouTube videos is great.  And picture in picture is not an option sometimes,  especially if you're watching music videos.
Lew better continue the youtubers daily driver or imma lose my sh*t
It is not fair to compare hardware. Android has a lot of different varieties. It was better if you compared ths os.
great video
I can relate with Marques, I take a picture on my galaxy and if you turn off the phone then the picture isn't saved for some reason. I've never understood why and it's annoying that I have to check that the picture is saved each time. I love my android tho ❤️
These guys Are apple fans clearly,this video should have been labeled Apple is better than Android🤦‍♂️
Just to point out you guys said five years on an iPhone that I see got six years of software support
Eh, as good as Iphone hardware is, the software doesn't offer the amount of freedom I get with android. I can root, unlock the boot loader for custom roms, get really in depth with customization, use third party apps and stores, run linux distros, I can expand my storage, adapt the phone to interact with whatever ecosystem I'm in etc. Basically I can use it like I would my computer. Iphone doesn't really feel like it is "mine".
Everyone is pressed in the comments because the narrative that apple makes bad expensive phones has spread throughout the tech community and people aren't ready to accept that iphone is winning right now.
The fact that ios doesn't have a back button pisses me off
My two  favorite reviewers
I think and apparently the video looked biased like apply pay you both, is it true honestly tell?
The worst video !
YOU DON'T know anything about technology, just an iphone fan boy and a typical youtuber who unboxed new phones when it first released.
I wish it would have been less of an fanboy comparison. Software Feautures and photography definitely go to Android. Nobody who is using Android (the majority in the world) cares about facetime and Imessage.
Not what I expected when I heard you talking about the collab at the end of the last video - but oh boy was it great to see you both together again making those videos where unlike other collabs you actually talk freely sitting beside each other  On the topic - i think with Xiaomi coming in, that value is unmatched. With specs written on labels online the brand value should matter less and less, because to be honest - apple is still IN the market despite having little but it's battery going for its selling points. But in the present - seems apple is finally doing some stuff customers want  This is a very interesting competition tbh and surely fun for customers hehe
I don't agree on the eco consious part.  You gotta factor in the longevity of the device. iPhones out of the box come with at least 5 years of updates, but so do Samsung phones now. And if you're phone doesn't get official updates anymore, at least on android you can install custom roms on it to extend it even further for at least a couple of good years. Also, the android phones are generally more repairable, with more parts available and less likely to have software lockups if you replace a part with a 3rd party one.   The port is also usb-c which means if you don't get a charger with it anymore you probably don't have to spend more money to get yet another box shipped to you, and if you do have to buy a charger, at least it's a universal standard which means you got a lot more options from competitors and the like.
Very good video. I look forward to more videos like these. Congratulations.
In Africa, android is the thing. We have no copyright
Two Apple fan boys ganging up on android phones. Throw Linus v MKBHD will be much more fair
One of the worst video you made
Darn, I wish linus was featured too.
Apple is the king of capitalism.  -removing charging brick,  -no 3.5mm audio jack,  -no type c -charges more for cloud storage.  -Repair is difficult.
MKBHD and Mrwhosetheboss 2022 edition in a video that is exactly 20:22 long. Nicely done :)
WARNING APPLE AD AHEAD!!!
It's very cringy listening to Marcus trying to defend Apple.
This video is really unique.
Paid by Apple
Real answer: Use whatever works for you. (Both are in dark times anyways)
The Collab that we never expected but we got it. 🙌
Pathetic way of portraying this comparison.   Dislike.. andoid is way better than ios can be .
Given how central smart phones are to our digital lives, I was surprised you didn't rate the platforms based on security and privacy concerns. Any reason these were excluded from your review?
You have missed out a HUUUUGE point on differents bro.. It is a emergency situation where you can save voices when you press the clock on the screen( lock screen) and it records right away while iphone emergency services are so damn complicated. Function wise i choose samsung but battery camera has iphone. I hope iphone can better this future and add it too because emergency situations happens and if your damn phone can't help you to save a quick record of voice or call the police for you why would i pay so much money
I wonder how a man could praise  the iphone this far. I have been watching his videos so long time, i found one thing that he is a secret brand ambassador for the iphone😆, or may be its a marketing strategy for apple. Ever since he changed the mobile from Samsung to iPhone, he begun to say iphone, iphone, iphone. Samsung and other android devices has a lot of cool features and essential features but you have done  this video only with your opinion and only by how and what purpose you have been using these phone. If you haven't found anything best or interesting about android phones it doesn't  means that iphones are the best. By the way, how much you got paid by Apple ? 🤭
Well.I'm using android phones but they are buggy and I have battery issues with them all the time.Maybe I should replace android and go to iOS because iOS seems to be much better optimized?
MKBHD clearly likes the iPhone... The results aren't very convincing... Do this with other tech YouTubers Like you videos Arun..
I think iPhone destroyed android here because it was all based more on user experience, where iPhone excels
iphone in usa and uk are overrated
You should have invited Lewis from UT. And you be the judge.😁😂
Mrwhosetheboss made this video only in favor of iphone. He was just forcefully giving marks to apple. Why man?
androids/ samsung is underrated
Collab of the century
Samsung edge displays over any edge display and definitely over an iphone display.
Sorry but repairability is a big factor for E waste, and Apple is bottom of the repairability league!! So that carbon neutral crap should not even factor into it!!
Every  time  mkbhd pick the iphone
This was rather more an interview of Marques than a discussion...
one of the best tech videos ever! The conclusion of the video: What is your choice and your value for that choice!
I am die-hard android, yet these are my favorite tech YouTubers lol.
Really?  How are you saying that the iPhone screen is just as good as Samsung???  I've used them side by side and it isn't even close.
how do you get 2.5 / 7.5.... seems a little bit apple bias
IT CAN'T GET ANY BETTER, THESE 2 IN SINGLE FRAME 🔥
For me android always keeps working. The iphone always ends up slowing down to a crawl with updates. Obviously the YouTubers will never experience this since they're changing phones all the time but having an iPhone requires you to upgrade every 2 years minimum and the common users can't shell out $1200 every year
confirm american all iphone no android they just dont get how android is better than iphone rather than paying expensive phone and dont get fast charging and get better epxperince and keep buying iphone for your lives
I knew their pick before I watched the video.
Very controversial topic iOS is one company you can easily analyze, but for Android more than 50 different brands with total different products, different experiences and so on,  analyzing on an average is not even fair   Nice video tho 💥💥
This analysis is flawed. You are supposed to be comparing OS but you compared hardware. Also, one manufacturer compared to dozens of others. Honestly, I feel this was sponsored by Apple.
This isn't a fair comparison
Love me or hate me but I am just gonna say it, MKBHD was biased towards Apple.
Iphone is boring yet too expensive...these comparisons were rigged for iphone..
You should've called this episode "Apple Love fest" i give the results a big BS. But just my opinion.
mkbhd dude that live in USA literally only care about revewing brand like apple samsung and google , while others great android manufacture he barely touch lol. this is to show that the people living in USA think they are the only one " it's kinda the same mentality with apple , thinking they are the only one existing"
Mrwhosetheboss did not think this one through 😂 we knew iphones are good, but we did not expect them to be this good. But I think the results would be different if it was Samsung VS iPhone. Maybe that is what Mrwhosetheboss had imagined the show would be like.
I think you should have made it android vs iphone flagship.. also iPhone hold value much longer. Nice to see u both together.  :)
Great video on philosophies of user on choosing a phone.
Could you review the Infinix Note 12...This seems crazy and i'm only now hearing of this company
Finally a informative collaboration. Keep it coming. Amazing to see perspective of both of you. 🎉😊
MKBHD is a wrong person to collab for this kind of video. He's soo biased and always has a sweet spot towards apple
Sponsored by Apple
Android !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We all know mxbhd is an apple fan ofc he's gonna go with iphone on everything
My android has double tap on back to trigger automate flows which practically automates all the things on my phone. I dont think i phone provides that kind of advanced use of a gadget which is there to make your life easier.
Isn't the title supposed to be Android Vs iOS or Android phones Vs iOS phones 🤔
I wonder how this comparison would be like 5 years after technology upgrades
With the whole going green thing, don't forget about right to repair and being able to service your phone and being stuck in the ecosystem or having to use first party accessories, and usb c being better, and how they're overpriced but not upgradeable
2 legends together  Wow 😘😘
Lock screen Widgets are not better in iOS. Example Good Lock on Samsung are way better
I just watched this like my favorite tv series just got released 😅. Loved it.
It was so satisfying when the score jumped from .5 to a full number on both sides
One thing I've learned from this is that MKBHD has become so biased towards Apple recently. His recent videos also showcase this. He spends so much time on Apple devices while doing few other reviews here and there
Marques's voice man, what happened?
Nobody: Every American: I love iPhone even if it was made in China but its designs are made on paper in California
That MKBH guy is a little iPhone biased.
I will say this. Android is much more fun to use.
Great video but I think it's a bit unfair. I think the title is irrational. Android is a system and iPhone is a series of phones. There should be a comparison between for example Samsung vs iPhone. And I think Samsung should win I some categories. I think it has better screen and better camera.
It's kind of paid. The fact that previously they were in iPhone  office and now this
Arun is looking like a kid in front of Marques.
There are many terms you didn’t even mention
The fact that as a android user I can pull out anytime I want, yet a ISO user will be basically locked forever (once you got your iphone, you almost must have to have your ipad, your apple laptops, and even apple tv services), is a simple fact that I have never used a iphone, or will ever use one. Any normal non-media person on this planet will not be influenced by any of the advantages or disadvantages presented in this video. Freedom or choices is my choice, I don't want generations of my family got locked in to one brand....(apple is making this happening guys it's happening)
Also some of these things only deserved 0.25 point being that it was so close and if you change this then the points don't seem so far off
they lowkey promoted the iPhone sitting in Apple arena and we all watched em.
i love your videos normaly   but this video is very apple sided
the title should be iPhone vs all the b**ches💀
The thing I hate about "carbon neutral" is that to become carbon neutral, most companies just buy what is called carbon credits. That basically means a company donates money to a startup or another company who are doing things to reduce carbon in the atmosphere and reduce carbon emissions in various ways such as more wind power or making electric cars more affordable and accessible.
i think in a few topics you should have dug a bit deeper, for example the whole thing with eco consciousness around iphones is a bit problematic, i think you guys should also tke into acount when apple was delibaretly throttling their older phones, wich isnt really that eco friendly. Additionally how did you not talk about the fact that you cant really repair iphones anymore witch is super unfriendly eco wise. As a last point there are a few topics like camera where you say both are good but just give the whole subject towards apple and did not even split it why. As a whole you guys should have taken your responsibilaties as pretty much the biggest phone channels on youtube a bit more seriously, schould have done way more research and schould have been way more nuanced.
Don’t even need to watch and can already say iPhone, in almost all ways. Privacy, design, features, compatibility etc… All the android police will come at me, but only because they don’t use iPhones, so they can’t really say anything. Average user doesn’t need to customise, nor do they care. iPhone > android any day
I really think that with the customisation, android clearly takes it... by a mile
Sponsored by Apple, a company who releases updates which slows phones down 🤣🤣
iMessage and Facetime are not a "huge deal" outside the states Marques
An area not mentioned here is the hardware/software ecosystem - which do you prefer, Apple's relatively closed ecosystem or Android's more open ecosystem? Consider security, interoperability, consistency, control, range of compatible apps & devices, repairability, & ideology...
I have been using Samsung Galaxy devices exclusively for more than the past decade. I feel like I don't need my phone to just be a great, reliable phone. I love the iPhone, but I can't get myself to get stuck in the Apple ecosystem. Also, I like Samsung trade-in marketing. I just traded in a S9 plus with a broken screen for a S22 Ultra and got $300 credit. The phone does everything I need.
Samsung vs iPhone maybe much more neck and neck
U guys r getting paid by apple or what i
Guess MKB finally found the perfect phone if he's using a year old Samsung 🙂
At the end, most YouTubers will favour Apple over Android even when Android is more flexible than iOS
I've never trusted MKBHD with reviews between apple and android. He is always baised. You guys remember he reviewed the $999 pro stand and tried to justify it.
This iPhones vs Android thing is just like comparing vergin vs bi*ch
How can You miss security?  😐
this seemed way to one sided for me, they've left out so many features like usbc compatibility and super fast charging, and more customization options than just widgets
I feel like you guys could have elaborate more on the timeframe this devices get updates. This is why Apple has managed to keep a good portion of their customers, I personally know people rocking 2 iphones that are at least 6 years old now but they still work fine for what they use it. When you build a device that's going the obsolete way in just two years your more inclined to make a 'smarter' investment. Lot of people not loving the new iPhone SE, but apple literally put the same chip in the SE and the Pro Max. Watch the SE still outperform new phones with just 2 years of updates 2 years from now. I feel like this is part of the reason we have so many Android phones, which is great, but that’s also why companies can’t focus in just one phone line. Which is what I think Samsung is trying to do as of lately. Going the apple way. That’s what their phones are looking similar as of lately if you ask me.
MKBHD really talks logical..this person is a balanced and gives completely different perspective to look at the technology.
There are over 24,000 different kinds of android brands out there, talk about diversity, mkbhd even used the word Android Land to describe it
Hi may you please tell me which app do I install to record call on my iPhone which works simple like on android phone?
Summary:  "Does Samsung Dex matter to you?"  "Uh ye... No"
for the price android I've been using smartphones from the 120 /150$ and no problem at all
They just said buy an iphone bich respectfully 😂😂
Just wipe the galaxy on your shoulder 😂😂😂😂😂
A lot of this is mostly just opinion
After being a Samsung user all my life, I bought an iPhone 13 Pro recently but returned and went back to Samsung because it does way better in one of the most fundamental things of a phone, "call quality". Nobody talks about it much but there's a secondary noise cancellation mic, that blocks out all ambient noise during a call. Doesn't matter if I'm in the bathroom or a movie theatre, the caller on the other side ONLY hears my voice. Helps a lot in many situations!
The sexual tension between the two best tech youtubers lmaoo
I’m not sure I agree on the value for money conclusion. They didn’t really consider residual value and processor headroom in the discussion. iPhone gets the win in that respect surely?
I disagree with alot of points from mkbhd. He stated more of his personal opinion. He is not very connected with how people actually use their Androids and iOS. There's a huge market outside of US which doesn't get and doesn't care about alot of things iPhone won in. Mkbhd gave point based on how well a phone will work for dumb audience.
Just I phone mad both of you
Emulators are a huge thing for me, as well as the S pen. I love being able to play Wii, DS, N64, whatever all just on my phone. I also like custom APKs if i ever wanna grab something that isnt on the app store. Apple is more secure, but Android is way more open.
Repairabilty????????????????????????????????????????????????
i have both.
My brain: Android My heart: IOS My wallet: KaiOs
2.5 Billion ppl have phone androids in the world. End of the story
Why is the A-Roll yellow? Not saying it’s bad, just curious as someone who is beginning to try and learn about video production
Put the top tier apple versus top tier galaxy
I prefer android because I can't afford an iPhone
Its all about personal preferences and convinience. I can name a lot of features which makes me choose android and some in apple.
Marques has become apple biased and u cant deny that. Arun straight told the facts but Marques was like give points to apple. marques has become apple biased no cap.
A sub to the channel would be... Choice.
This was your secret collab got you!
It is clear that it is a video of two experienced people in the domain. Great job. I like the timing. For me personally I use iPhone and I think for those who need customization will go for android but in terms of updates I really like the lifetime of updates of iOS.
Android>
So mk doesn't like BBW phones 😂 man it's all about the curves it's all about the bass the bass no  treble lmao
After switching back and forth the last few years, I think iPhones are better. This was not always the case. Mostly, what I like about them is that apple sells you a complete product and isn’t secretly scrimping in some way, like selling data, adverts in the os, or using poor quality components that look good on paper.  My 13 pro max will realistically get 3-5 years of highly usable life with at most a battery change and I can’t say the same for most android flagships. Even if you get updates there is a good chance of having significant performance drops only a year or two out.
Best video out there..
Is Apple paid to you 🤣 iPhone never comes near Android where it is about customisation. And there are lots of features where iphone lake's about
Apple won and I saw this coming
Android does everything I need for about $150 dollars and assuming I change every 4 years my annual cost of ownership comes to $38 per year. For that reason I'll keep choosing android over ios every single time
iphone has best camera but android has better technology. Iphone has best performance
Hundreds of companies use Android as software and on the iOS side there is only Apple. That means Android phones automatically has more variety on it’s features right?  And also because there are so many phones on Android they have almost every price so I think that makes a misconception that Apples phones are very expensive, but in reality with the same price you get Android phones with similar specs.
There are lots of 'S' in this video
Eco consciousness is completely wrong! As long as apple does not allow the ability to repair by any repair shop it will be an instant loss! Does not matter how much recycled materials they use as long as they refuse the ability to fix them!
This is just a hate video on Android. So sad to see how you guys hate on Android.
Iphone better.
I'm sorry, but you guys just compared a flagship phone to an Operating System
I think a take on  MKBHD’s sports team metaphor best describes the debate.  The iPhone is the best sports team but usually the best sports team isn’t the most liked one. Everything is good enough and reliable. Androids are cool toys and iPhones are tools. However if you ask someone who doesn’t watch the sport then they will probably choose the best one. The same is true for iPhones. If you don’t care and just want a phone that works then you don’t look at gizmos, you buy the tool.
Completely biased video, you gave ties on points were Android clearly wins. Never mentioned type - C cable. And the list goes on.
in my sincere opinion, i think the ranking is really dependant on the perspective u take for the different aspects. for the display side of things, for example, the color accuracy of the S22 Ultra is a big notch ahead than the iPhone, despite both having Samsung-made displays. the responsiveness of the Samsung phone can be even snappier with speeding up the transition animations found in Dev. Mode.  things like this really make a huge difference in debates such as this. however, thats some nice content right there, keep it up Arun.
Marcus really is confusing the difference between software and actual camera quality when he was talking about the camera department. Okay, maybe when he suddenly clicked, it didn't take a photo but that doesn't mean the iPhone camera is superior because it didn't have any bugs.
These Guys are faking here. They must have been paid a hefty fees by iPhone. Today everybody is a techky so we know what is good and what is useless. We need the youtubers only to demonstrate the new devices and leave it on us to decide what is good n what is not.  I guess Mr Mobile is a straight forward you tuber and better then any one of them. Sorry Arun you are loosing it
Apple...i am sick of that ugly notch
I've learned listening to these guys talk that I just care about very different things than the average consumer. I don't use my camera, really at all. I want less of the front of my phone to be a screen, because I accidentally hit things constantly. I don't want a personal assistant. I don't want face time. I want removable storage and removable battery. I want fast charging. I don't want to be locked into an ecosystem. I want a phone to be cheap and repair friendly. And I want it to be able to run every app on the app store.  Basically I want a phone that nobody else wants and apparently won't be made.
I don't know why I am watching this when i can't buy any of those two.
I'm just watching this on my S10 while my iPhone 13 pro max is being charged. Best of both worlds tbh. The S10 is not that reliable now but it was an amazing phone when I bought it. Also, the iPhone battery literally brought down my anxiety level, especially while I'm outside and need to use maps or the internet.
i use Android Split Screen almost every day, and that's the thing that is turning me off from buying an iphone. But i guarantee the day that Apple introduces working split screen efficently on iphone i buy one 100%.
The fact that I can install whatever I want on android without play store makes android +100
Sponsored by apple 🍎🤗
alright but what about pc? windows vs apple maybe?
This felt incredibly biased.
Ngl this is very one-sided for apple because I don't know more than 5 people in my neighborhood who have an iphone I feel android is the winner
Wow u really asked good questions kudos
Has anyone feels the change of Aruan's accent?
It's like a discussion between two professors of my university 😇😇
Once again my friends the mighty Apple wins. I use apple but I also want Android to win because apple is pushing people to get into their eco system. I did use android for 5 years, so I know there is a better world beyond tiny bubble of Apple. I want more convenient and compatible smart products outside from Apple to work with Apple so that Apple can't take all of my money from my pocket because 'they have the best'(as they say) and also it will keep apple by their toes for their obnoxious prices.
this kinda feels like the downfalls of android device or this could be the downfall of android device but if it is well it would be sad 😞
For the amount of money that I'd spend on the latest iPhone if I use that money for an investments such as saving or in safe stocks for myself, my kids' education or family retirement I on any day will get more value; the future  me will respect the now me better. It is not about my earning capacity it is about value (not phone value which is myopic but life value) I can't see myself buy it. But sure if I accumulate the $$$ rewards that I get from my org and allow it to get to new iPhone cost - would I buy the iPhone or iMac 100% yes. But using my own money while I have responsibilities never.
For me., the one thing that's keeping me in android ecosystem is Price and flexibility with apps
The like dislike ratio isnt that good tbh, he now has 2,2k dislikes ans 39k likes. I guess there are a lot of people who strongly support one side and then dislike this.
In my pocket I have an iphone 12 mini and a Samsung S10E. I love the looks of the iPhone and how quick the camera is to open, but I use the Samsung all the time. The reason is the os. For me android is much more intuitive (I've been using both an Iphone and Samsung in parallel for 6 years now). There are some extremely annoying things about ios. It doesn't have a proper clipboard for example.
The main difference between android and iphone is.. Compare s22 with iphone 12 after 2 years..  Android fone feels hang and slow after 2 years.. bt iphone doesnt feel any hang or slow..   And if someone ask that anyone use a phone more than 2years, then my answer is yes, ofcourse. Most of the people buy flagships with big price is not to use just 2 years.. they expcting minimum 5 years.. And I can easily say that iphone is worth than any android phone.. And I am using iphone 12. Anyway I am an Android developer 🤓
iPhone wins as the most complete phone on average, but it's just that the best average (and most awesome video experience). Android excels at everything in isolation. My $200 Android phone has a 6000 mAh battery, how much have do you have to pay for a iPhone that can do that?
We can transfer files (not just photos and videos, everything!) with other android phones in multiple ways (nearby share, Samsung share, 3rd party apps and much more)
Can anyone guess which phone he used at the ending? XD
I'm a Samsung girl through and through
what tiem is it is lunch time and also wat happened to going to bed at 1030
Iphone 5 Years later "U Can`t install this app buy a new phone" Android 5 years later "install successful"
It's like Apple fanboys meetup😅😂since purely in display  they gave equal points for a big notch vs small punch hole
Idiots, LG V60 ThinQ beats all these new so called flagships after 2.5 years after release. And in videos also! Battery life also.
It was a purely biased comparison!!
STILL NO USB C
Disagree on Photography and Display. Galaxy S22 Ultra's display is Insane, more insane than the iPhone's. Photography, it's been better from launch and even improved a lot from updates.
Me I choos Android Battry + Camera
The video we all have been waiting for.
You two guys are doing good job do more like this
Media sharing ??
I love when my two favourite tech creators collab🔥… you guys are such an inspiration for me ❤️💯
I will not buy an iPhone until they add third party support & usb type c . I hate iPhone for removing 3.5mm jack and charger from the box. It hurts ,, I can't download movie and watch on iPhone but in android it's easy, also iPhone notch sucks.  IPhone is good at battery life , video shooting , sharp and fast photos, design , brand value,  and speedy performance..
I would like to say iPhone I do own iPhone 13 pro max but I’m very disappointed in camera lens flare which completely destroys the camera experience. Don’t get me wrong but iPhone is great but don’t win the camera experience. Reason I got iPhone was because I wanted the Apple Watch series 7
I think Android should have got more than 2.5 points, but most of these categories are very close and subjective and depend on how you see it. iOS is more reliable, Android is more customizable. But both are constantly improving and copying each other. At the end of the day, it's all about preference.
Value part is unfair its andriod where you got lot of different brands vs apple that just got iPhone. If you want compare it fairly you can only do per brand vs apple and not based on the os. Just my opinion.  This for lot of things here you say andriod vs ios but what you did is iphone vs a lot of other brands that use andriod. You simply cannot compair iphone vs 10 different brands its unfair.
I really disagree with the screen and the customisation cause u just have more option like root and stuff which u dosent have and i just have a high resolution screen on samsung and a brighter one  And same goes for photo its just a bit better then apple
I am a Samsung user from 2010 to until now . Nd I never had any issues with Android. It's reliable, easy to use nd mostly it offers so many features. Nd the  cameras are superb. So please don't judge it like this bullshit. If we are talking about the security, then Samsung knox provide us the defense grade security. Which is way ahead of apple security.
So what we have discovered is that iOS is for simpletons and Android is for the Tech Savvy. Glad I'm not a simpleton. XD
Man I'm just amazed that the iphone got so much more score than android !! For real in some categories in which iphones won u could argue that android is better There are So many things that are irretating in an apple product compared to an android
I Never Felt this Worst Watching MrWhoseTheBoss Video
I think the huge factor for me for not choosing Iphone over Android is because of the cost. You can get a very cheap android phone with reasonable specs while you need to spend tons of money just to upgrade storage for iphone, without any external SD card too. I hate to say this but for people with average salary, owning an Iphone is quiet a huge investment unless you really need it for specific reasons.
iPhones have users and quality in mind. Androids (in general) have feature creep in mind. Lots of things that are nice/okay to have just not necessary. What iPhones can do, they do it extremely well despite being limited in scope compared to androids.
Android is cheap We can use crack app Easily connect to laptop Can download video,song Some game comes to Android first Budget Android phone can work for 2-3 year
As someone who just changed to iOS ~1.5 months ago, the features are lacking.   Apps are not very customizable, for example Gboard is nothing compared to the full fledged Android version, it cannot even have a proper number row and pop-up time for special characters cannot be set either. Apple's default keyboard cannot be multilingual and does not support suggestions in my native making it effectively useless.  Sticking with apps it's other stupid and lackluster things like, why can't I set custom notification tones in Messenger and such applications?  Or fundamentally flawed design like how there is no way to have a folder/album that just show camera pictures and videos taken with the device. They are simply put into recents but everything is put into recents, it's a mess in there. The only other way is to filter by location but if I want pictures from different locations then it's a back and forth between albums. Currently I move pictures taken into a camera album I've created by hand. It is extremely inefficient and annoying on a device costing that much. On the other hand automatically made albums based on people created filters for meme characters without asking permission for some reason?! And it was iOS13 that literally took away Camera Roll. Like, why?!  Apple Pay is great and so is family location sharing, but as for daily use there are huge missing things and I'm on the verge of just selling the phone off.  My .02s.
I switched from Iphone to Samsung and world of samsung is much better. Bias video
I just hate how Apple locks sensors and features for Developers that don't pay Apple a shit load.
It was interesting to see their take on these phones but i feel like it was very very unfair and biased. Don't get me wrong, i think its an honest perspective.  Just to give an example, they gave eco-friendliness to Apple when Apple was the one that removed the headphone jack and even the charger. Plus we all know the repairability and extremely bad warranties of Apple. I know some Android phone followed them but Apple was the one that "Innovated" this.  Similarly, another example would be of customizability. MKBHD took it in terms of the ease of customising your phone when that isn't even the question that was asked.  But everyone has their own opinion and seeing this take, although a bit unfair (In my opinion), does show what MKBHD himself likes in a phone.  Just to recap, i think iPhone is really good and is improving constantly but it is getting more credit than it actually deserves.
The problem with this competition is Andriod has too many choices. Right from the first challenge which shouldn't be a tie, Andriod won, but they detracted from the Andriod because the other Andriod phones were shitty. This should be one company vs the other.
We khow iphone is good but the problem is we cant afford 🤣...fking price ..
Great debate bro. Everything is good and acceptable. This isn't a clear win to iphone.  MKBHD will obviously pick iphone as he born in USA.  @Mrwhosethebose should conduct the same interview on IOS vs Android.
heres hoping the comments are pretty chill
Just AWESOME to see you both together again…do more collaborative videos like this
My video ios vs android
Apple has been doing good after the Iphone X. I might get an iphone the next time I upgrade
2 legends togather🔥
Lot of bias here, clearly it boils down to preference in most cases
You're in Cali and you're still spelling "Colour" like that😂😂😂😂😂😂 (no shame though)
MKBHD is practically paid by Apple having early access to new products. I personally do not watch his videos anymore.
I'm not going to pretend I'm on the bleeding edge of technology and know all the latest and greatest features of phones, but it seems iOS has come a _long_ way in the last ten years.  In 2012, Android OS felt leagues ahead of iOS.  Now, I think it's the reverse.  iOS is no longer missing critical features, and Android honestly feels dumbed down from versions I used years ago.  Add in iOS's better efficiency, and it seems like the OS to have.  I'd buy an iPhone for my next phone if they still sold phone-sized phones (think original iPhone size), but they don't so I'm stuck with Android.
You just missed Pixel 6 & 6 Pro at 16:49 it promises 5 years of updates.
u guys are iphone fans and giving point for that
Android has always been better... iPhone to just toddle along with their own complete and utter garbage products, tweaking this and that not much changes,  whilst Android phone are light years away from iPhone... Always will Be.... and don't start me on right to repair with apple (or not) and they're closed ecosystem just sucks
My Google Pixel 2 XL STILL outdoes anything these 2 are waffling on about.
Try to design rather then bullshit comments
i didnt
MKBHD = 🐑
android is too much of a blanket os to be compared, it should have been something like iPhone or Samsung phone,  to group certain android devices amongst others, it just doesn't seem to be a good way to compare... it's a given that iPhone would win at that rate.
💙
Apple copy Android
Many people forgot one thing, that is the Time Apple has and others don't have. Apple already an established premium brand created a hype and released it's first iPhone that is of course because of Steve Jobs. Remember people went mad over a phone from Apple back in 2007 even it lacks lot of features compared to Androids then. People even don't know what is an app bought the iPhones just to show off that they got a premium Apple iPhone. Chinese and Indians who always follow US supported this trend and Apple got instant recognition world wide. Samsung which is in market already has no premium brand recognition like this. Every other company like HTC, LG, Blackberry etc lost in market because of this unexpected trend created by Apple. Samsung survived by some innovation like using Oleds, software features etc on their mobiles. Google just ignored this trend and still is. So, this gave Apple lot of ample time to release features slowely without any rush as their market was increasing even iPhones  lack lot of basic features like filesystem, forceful dependency on iTunes etc whereas Samsung like companies has to rush to implement features in no time to compete with Apple. This resulted in lakluster performance from Android team especially quality control from Samsung whereas Apple enjoying taking good amount of time to refine it's eco system. It took Apple to catch up with Samsung OLEDs and punch holes ten years of time. Apple never cared about losing the market because of lacking features as people never bought iPhones for features. 90% of the people still buy iPhones to showoff. This gave Apple years of time to slowely implementing features with zero issues. I use both iPhones and Samsung because I love some innovations from Samsung. And the quality control from Samsung and Google is still bad compared to Apple. If Google and Samsung concentrate on quality taking good time like refining Android, Apps and hardware issues, camera quality etc sure people will gradually support Android eco system too. I personally love Samsung mobiles but forcefully buy Apple iPhones because undoubtfully they are best. But, monopoly is dangerous for end users, so I wish Android team give serious competition to Apple in future.
I have a feeling Marquez was gunning hard for the IPhone, but then Arun seemed to be trying to defend very slightly for the Android
what I want from my phone is performance, battery life, durability, good price, easy interface with most app settings in the apps and a responsible operating system developer that doesn't limit my right to repair my phone. give me an option to have same controls as on android too.
Yup, all my Samsung phones had a weak vibration motor... Even directly on my skin, I barely feel it. Not to mention if I'm walking. smh  I have a Galaxy Note 9 now, and it's still a weak motor. Like wtf Samsung??
Why does Marques seem sooooo reluctant to be involved in this video?
It seems like a flagship iPhone is being compared with a mid tier Android phone. Very disappointed with the conclusion.
5 year down iphone has never hangged on me . Even with only 400 mb left on storage where as androi with last 2 gb starts stuttering
iphone is still way ahead
i got an ad for samsung as soon as i clicked the vieeo
IME, Android feels cluttered and IOS feels like an OS from the 2010 with nothing changed. Sure, both are (and are getting) super smooth, but Android has always just felt like they have trouble showing you relevant information, while IOS feels like Apple doesn't know what categorization meansor want you to customize how anything really looks/works. IMO, iPhone is the worst product to buy from Apple (still a good product tho). But compared to Macs or even Ipads, iPhone has MUUUUCH better competition and really, the competition wins.
I think you should have considered that we can download any app's apk file on android outside of play store and can't do that on an iPhone.
Oh my gosh you can have a debate about this and not scream!!
Actually I kinda loved your lighting then most of your previous videos
Was an android fan boy but once u start using iphone u won't go back
There is one thing this guys missed SOUTH AFRICA now I get it like is this guy crazy speaking about south africa 🇿🇦 like what does south africa have to do with this well a lot in south africa android phones are selling like hot cakes 1in a 1000 people own a iphone in south africa not the way android phones are android selling 999 in a 1000 people own a android phone in south africa mostly because they can't afford it like duhh like I am using a sumsung s21 sending this message like don't get me wrong my mother can afford a iphone but she doesn't want them why mostly because the first phones that came to south africa were androids and my mother's first phone was an android
What a horribly onesided video. Next time when you want to make a video like this, look for a content creator in Europe or South Korea  and ask them same question.  Funny dudes. the dint even mention quick share,google duo, or nearby share. No need to finish the video. Lol
I love seeing Marques in other peoples videos, you can tell the lack of control makes him fidgety ahah
Worst worst worst iOS thing is the storage spce eaten by the system every time u delete something the system eata that off
Pretty clear iPhones are better.
This is like an iPhone fan boy video. MKBHD now is more like iJustine used to be. :D
yall are in apples pockets, i mean i have seen an android device take better pictures, charging fast and the device lasts longer, i mean you cant be serious, i dont know maybe its the iphones shipped to south africa
Hey guys thumbs up
nerd
20:18 *he says the lighting sucked* me looking around my house
Samsung Quick share, bixby
I loved it but I think you should consider adding more Android phones it is not just samsung
This video reminds me of why i stopped watching mkbhd
honestly they are comparing iPhone to Samsung... not Apple to Android.
I think Android is better
The best phone is the phone that does what you want it to do
IMO, it should be either 'Android vs iOS' or '*An Android Phone* vs iPhone'
This is done wrong, are you talking about the phones? Or the software? ...cz in terms of hardware ...android PHONES are always the winner, iphones only have its software.... hardware wise its mid tier at best. Except in the chipset department maybe.
me only ever owning a 79% battery health iphone 7+:   the iphones are the best in the market!
Let the salt flow!!!
Samsung - Photos iPhone - Videos
are you joking? S22 ultra has better 120 Hz Display!!!
I have an iPhone 12 Pro and I miss my android. I miss the customization with home screens. I wish iPhone had more room for backing up and storage. Which sucks in some features, but are good in others
it's either android vs. ios OR iphone vs [device model name].. 😬 but android vs. iphone?
Team iPhone all the way!
That's not Jidion!?😟
Display, battery are purely dominated by Android
I like android more
I'd say y'all are a bit biased. If apple is good because it's only in some devices and android is on every, take that into account. Take into account every device, that's the biggest feature android has, it is so versatile.
WHATTT NONO THIS IS REDICULOUS
I’m like the video colab but it’s kind of unfair since android is an operating system not a phone while the iPhone is a line of phone running iOS. A true comparisons is android vs iOS. Or a specific phone line like Samsung, pixel, etc to go up against iPhone. So when you compare the average phone running android, you will find that it gets trumped by the latest iPhone, but I guess the video is more interesting with the video title.
Omg the collaboration now this is cool 👍
Haven't been able to print to PDF on iOS
I think breakability goes to Samsung because the owe things just don’t break
WHATTT NONO THIS IS REDICULOUS
To me Android is more of a user-friendly.
How the f is eco consciousness is a win for iphone, they make that repairing experience so bad that you would go for a new one. Isn't reuse a better deal than recycling.😐, And nearby share is pretty good in comparison with airdrop. Iphone doesn't even have usb c where as Android phones of 100 bucks are equipped with usb c. So much for eco consciousness.
Realistically there's no contest. It's android
Thanks for the video, I am exactly thinking about which phone I should buy
android users mad in these comments lmfao
how can MKBHD forget about his photography test and go get the win to iphone!!! like what!!!
18:41 The trailer of the phone I'm using to watch this video, and I do say it's a lot more for the value, and the F3 is on another level in value (Just wait for F4's release) 👍
I only miss one thing from the iphone: The long software support. Performance, RAM, display, Camera, Apps is more or less on par. But I value SD-Card, USB-C, headphone jack, access to my files, customizations, broader choice of hardware in the Android world. I really want to like Apple products, but their weird software choices how to restrict users to use the often world class hardware properly is frustrating beyond believe. Unfortunately true for iOS and macOS. BUT if you don't care about these things, I would recommend the iphone, just because it is so powerful that you can use it for 6-8 years (maybe with a battery refresh). My wife still uses and iphone 6s and doesn't complaint. I am super happy with my Samsung Galaxy S10, which only would upgrade if the screen breaks ....
If I had to spend +800€ for a smartphone I'd choose iphone hands down. It's a no brainer
They do this so that they get invited to the next wwdc
I will suggest you guys to think wide. For example Apple is not eco-friendly at all. If you break the iPhone you have to buy a new one because of the high repair cost.
That's one of the most ridiculous and redundant video i have seen him making . This doesn't make any sense at all... All things coms to you get what you pay. Waste of time.
Such an iPhone centric video. No way iPhone has better photos than Samsung
1:49 Anyone noticed the dent in DENT?
thing with apple, they preety much force you into using the features to do basic functions. they give only one way to do it which is why you get an iphone. whereas android you can haver your way. the fact that you still cant fully drag and drop on ios to windows without proprietary software is still mind boggling. the fact that there isnt a native screen share to standard wifi tvs on ios. the fact that ios is still using lightning vs usb c on all other products.
For me S21U have better Design, better highlights HDR, better Shadow black detail.
Bro you are asking a question and mkbhd is just literally answering iPhone…..iPhone…..iPhone 😂
I have an ipad and an Android phone. Believe me apple is not as great as shown in this video, especially if you are not from a western country. Similarly, Android is not that bad.  Just some personal stuff- apple you suck for cutting literally all the features out of a 2-7 month old ipad.  I don't know what I will do with the news ipad 16. Probably look at weather I guess.
kinda surprised they didn't bring up the repairing aspect when talking about recycling. Android should've won that category easily.
I know they called it subjective and made it look IPhone is better in most but the reality is they are just benefitting from their limited but better route. Having to use both devices, I still weirdly vote for android because it’s just better
Why is iMessage any different from just texting out of an android?
I could have stopped watching this once iPhone took the huge lead, but I love both of your videos, so I couldn't stop.  Great video, again 😊!
I thought these two together would be more interesting & captivating, but in reality a pretty boring flat geek out chat. 😩
I think apple sponsored this video???
You can't really compare it this way as many manufacturers produce the hardware but has the Android OS. The title should read either  "Android v iOS' Or " Samsung Galaxy v Apple iPhone"
OP COLAB
I try to use every feature on my s22 ultra. The only win I give iphone is battery management
Smoking your sox a bit....
This video is soon gonna be on the Trending page
I always used Huawei phones and now i have an iPhone, and i dont agree  with iPhone is more reliable if want to take a quick photo, I had less problems with that before. Also I could trust my Huawei camera to take a picture in any light condition trusting that i wouldn't be overexposed or blurred, dont know about new Samsungs, Google or Xiaomi.
Thing to take away from this I think is that the winner is the phone that does what you want it to. I personally couldn't live without roms and apks etc on Samsung and the higher screen to body ratio is very important to me too. However most people I know don't give a crap about those things and would rather have the better camera etc on the iPhones.
Android vs iphone or Android vs ios😀
So baised video...
Android is always will be value for money , it have all the range for all the range and customer where iphone have very higher cost all over the ecosystem and android ecosystem may need to improve but iphone never reaches all customer ranges as an os.
I feel like the eco friendlyness should be re done I'd say there more of a tie as apple is very anti repair but some androids also copy that and some are very repairable
I’ve used android smartphones since 2011 and always looked down my nose at Apple seeing them as inferior and their fans cult like. After twelve years I became bored and decided to try an Apple phone just for something different and bought the 13 max pro, I hated to admit but it just brings a stability that I never experienced on any android phone and the battery blows me away even six months later. Battery capacity is still at one hundred percent and I have never had the phone die in a day despite being a heavy user. I don’t think I could ever go back.
Please change the title, it's dumb. Android is an OS, while iPhone is a phone. You compared the OSs, so it should be Android vs iOS. Or write Android Phones vs iPhone, it makes more sense. Unless it's just Samsung vs Apple?
Just add a poll we vote because what matters is accessibility in terms of affordability. Check the statistics of the user base for each operating system then conclude.
MKBHD is apple fanboy, that's why i quick his channel. Sorry mate.
I think the decision was made for me many years ago, but watching iPhones flip flop between gen X having hardware, gen Y not having that hardware, then gen Z "adding new features" (by adding that same hardware back in) cemented my resolve for Android.   Apple is great about repackaging an old idea and claiming it's new, or at least an upgrade.
MnM.
Its not right comparison your iPhone vs android , applications and own custom roms, third party app like google cam  Easy to repair cost, repairablity, compared to iphone  mainly lowest budget price range depends on their budget category its clear win android os running smartphones .. ecofrindely means don’t give the adapter and sell the adapter in official site some added extra features.  7.5 apple kk.   But android not done with  2.5.  In my opinion android4.5 …… why because of remaining  score R&D its security of 🍏 didn’t compromise  It’s just my opinion .if incase of anything wrong sorry im using 5years iPhone 📱  3years android 6years of nokia the king of mobiles not in present
How could you give apple the enviro-point when they force you to use their own charging equipment an endless additional wires/products.. hmmm
Most useless video
I use split screen all the time on my realme narzo50
VERY GOOD. The two reviewers out of a half dozen or more I watch in this space who I have the absolute highest regard for. Your opinions, both of you, Matter more to me than any others so I really appreciate this comparison. I’m an iPhone man, always have been, and so is my family. I have Android friends, specifically Samsung at present, and I would never recommend they switch  because their phones suit them for specific personal reasons. To me it’s like clothes or perhaps cars. Whatever you like is what you should have. Technical differences aside., Go with what feels best. If you are trying to do certain things that are important to you how well they do it above any other considerations, then get that phone. Don’t be shy about trying one out the other for two weeks if you’re not sure, because if from a cell carrier you can exchange Inside that period if you’re not happy with your initial choice. I did that in 2014. I got a Samsung Galaxy S5. First smartphone after years of LG flip phones. It depressed me. I took it back on the 13th day and got an iPhone 6. Couldn’t have been happier. Immediately. Since then an iPhone XR and now an iPhone 13 Pro Max with half a terabyte of memory. My major complaint, the one main thing that would prompt a quick upgrade – changing to a USB-C port for downloading large quantities of data from the cameras. I got all the memory for the advanced camera features but I don’t have a computer and editing on the phone is bunk. Otherwise I  really like the phone and will be upgrading no later than next year. The battery is great.
So much biasness and hypocrisy 😂
U are missing the iOS environment feature which is kinda a bad and good side only apple products work well with apple products and if u are locked on apple it's hard to get out of that ecosystem u really have to pay their premium price for everything they launch
Arun really shocked after hearing the reply on camera pick from MKBHD.. like wtf this nonsense z real Apple fan whatever.. 😂
this was rigged.
Display tie da fak
I would have just given the display to android the warm tint on my iPhone still annoys me a little bit especially when I see my friends Samsung. The other big thing is for photos at least 100% would give it to the android.
The comparison would have been interesting if... only, the apple system had been invented to run on as many manufactures or brands as like android does. But its not the reality. That's why, the apple will always have the advantage over android, it being having its own platform, os, and hardware
Sponsored by Apple
That unfinished American hand shake!!!
"This video it's sponsored by Apple"
you should have added one more. Which one is boring the most? have friends who were using iPhones for 6 to 7 years moved Pixel phones, because it was boring
There are apps that work better on android. I hate that I can't control YouTube music with siri. Plus the screen brightness being dropped on iPhone sucks. I personally think Android works better with apps most people use.
Marques sounds so much more American next to Aaron 😄
So you compare a software system with a phone? Android vs. iOS would be better
Just my opinion, but id say that apple takes the win for CASUAL videography, the sony xperia wins at PROFESSIONAL videography
First i dont like why they focused on Samsung in camera and software aspects?! 😏  Today you have one Vivo X70 Pro and X80 Pro who have the best camera phone you can imagine in phone industry!  Sofware, OneUi Samsung software looks good, but is not stable, have bugs and in speed and stabillity is far aways from Xiaomi, RealmeUi, ZTE MyOS, ColorOS... all these UI OS systems today are much better for day using than Samsung OneUi.  Also, everibody knows how Samsung battery is bad.  I personaly charge my S21 and S22+ model twice a day. Compared to other phones in house or some my frineds have, Samsung is the worst.
I respect mkbhd opinion but this wasn't objectively a good comparison between Android and iphone as it was biased by personal opinion and they made Android look way worse and iphones look way better than they are
2:19 so finally Genshin Impact is getting more exposure these day <3 it
Topic = Android vs iPhone When Eco-Friendliness Comes, Arun Says Narrow Down to Flagships. ANDROID Means Everything, from $50 Crap to $100,000 Gold Caviar One. I felt like Arun was Biased with iPhone. MKBHD Was Neutral.
This is "SAMSUNG" vs "IPHONE" Not "ANDROID" vs "IPHONE"  Good christ for people with experience get your terminologies correct you both have enough experience
Which color iphone are you using in the video arun?
I have access to both an S21 ultra and iPhone 13 pro max,  For the Samsung… Feels better in the hand - not so sharp edges USB-C charge  Extremely customisable wallpaper and icon/widget layout  Keyboard with letters and numbers combined  Camera pro mode, and zoom  How Google chrome opens  For the iPhone  Better camera (especially in low light), and Live Photos  FaceTime
You missed the fist bump
This is cool 😎 next PS5 VS XBOXX
of course the phone was 69 percent
So bias to IPhone... so stupid video this time unfortunately!!!!
The title for the vid should be how much better are iphones from Android
Majority of the battle was like boss supporting Android and Mkbhd supporting iPhone and it was all a debate 😅
Well this video is iPhone vs Samsung.  Cause if you talk about Android, there is a 1000different phones from 100 different brands to choose from.  That Battery part had me laughing cause if you talk of Android, midrange phone comes with Excellent battery life and on top of that 33watt fast charging.  I know you choose to make a video to garner more audience since you travelled so far, but the comparison you're making is baseless.
Mkbhd is iPhone biased
First time I ever felt that's not fair about your video. I think you missed many things
bro this makes me feel MKBHD is supporting i phones
First time i feel he started biased towards iPhone He cut points on Android easily and call it a draw for iPhone, but again i guess for US people iPhone is goto option so it makes sense
Apples like shopping at Morrisons and android is is like shopping at Tesco so many junk options
Well I am going in somewhat enthusiastic user's category but ifyou install custom rom then iOS won't be ever to match Android but that's things not everyone does as stated by marques 🙂
Go to 15:37 and tell me what you noticed.
Why is MKBHD speaking so slowly, I love the authority that's always in his voice. WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM? 😂😂😂😂
i dont think either phone can be put down so imidately, its hard to go wrong with either side depending on what you need a phone to do. if you just want to be like everyone else and be a "basic b*tch" iphones exist for you
Arun looks radiant under this lighting
i swear they look like vikk and tobi beside each other.....XD
"features"? You basically have not any other choice what "features"? I can't understand some parts of this video, basically I don't understand the point of this video but it's ok.
I believe no matter how much you break down the variables, Marques's opinion is his preference. He might be a YouTube expert, but this is according to his usage. I would instead bring in an actual expert from the industry to actually look into all of these elements that make up the score. Of course, we have the price and other factors that are very subjective, but the functionalities, other people might be more qualified to give an opinion. No disrespect to MKBHD, I love him.  Cheers Man
I think this was EXTREMELY unfair both to apple and android because you have two die hard fans or mobile phones in general but one is a die hard fan of iphones and one of androids when we should have had random people answer these questions from the perspective of someone who isn't a super fan of both android or apple
what you expect from 2 apple fanboys? Why don't you guys rename your channels AppleRox1 and 2... and be done with it :D ?
Never thought I'd dislike a video from either one of them not to talk of one that has both of them.
New reaction feature of youtube 🙂
As an atual happy iPhone 13 user I can say that Android is probably a better choice for the majority of people, unless you have more than 800€ to spend on a phone and you really really care about smartphone video and Apple ecosystem. By the way, just love the way you placed a green bubble and blue bubble for Android and iPhone…
Asking an iPhone user for iphone vs android is not a very bright idea in my opinion.. and plus a  brand minded guy.. duhh...
> androids are not smooth > uses a samsung (the worlds most laggy flagship)
You guys just trashed Android 🙄
I appreciate that the two of you took the time to examine the top smart phone products in fairly deep detail. Most users would not have the time nor money to review these devices as throughly as that.
Fair.
I believe there is a huge problem here. You should compare android with ios not an iphone with a ton of not iPhone phones
You also have to take into consideration when it comes to "eco conscience" users, repairability. IPhone, especially more recent ones, have terrible scores and have software locked parts, and are generally just a lot more overpriced and expensive, and massively more complicated compared to most if not all androids, with the likes of Samsung recently partnering with ifixit to launch a self repair campaign. Carbon neutral and recycled materials mean nothing if the company pushes new devices rather than repairing broken ones/damaged ones.
MKBHD seemed soo biased towards Apple...Arun was being more reasonable imo....
Android is much better
It was a rost for Android phones. But in the sporting way . I love the  the information. Love you both ❤️❤️
Lol Asking Marques is like asking Tim Cook, he is not impartial at all. My least favorite video, it is absurd.
I not bios either way but I've had android all my life and I'll probably stick with android and I've had Samsung since my galaxy s5, that being said I haven't got to experience the Galaxy s22 Ultra but I completely love my Galaxy s21 ultra and I still get 12 hours of total battery life with between 5 1/2- 6 hours of on screen time which isn't much different from when I first got it a year ago. But like I said I'm not biased but I'm sticking with my Samsungs. From what I've heard iPhone isn't a bad phone at all.  Edit: the battery life is with running qhd and adaptive 120fps all the time with some 4k YouTube video time to time. Also with heavy use. And I really think with Android in general most of the stuff with the phone is down to software and with every software update it messes with the phones hardware and software
Arun: That's why the lighting kinda sucks Me: Wait, What??? *Going back to check again* 👀
Disagree with most of the points , Display and battery is a big plus for android ..samsung phone would last a day and with same use iphone wont. Anyway its my perception, this would be always controversial .
Biased from the very start everyone knows Samsung has the best display in the market ain't no way it's a draw. No need to watch any longer cause I know iphone is gonna win
Excellent discussion by two masters 👏👏👏👏👏
And let the flame wars begin.
its all about personal preferences, try and make me like apple in the slightest, you cant. im a tech nerd and tech nerds gonna be tech nerds.
iPhone hands down, my only hangup is their monopoly on the App Store.
Really Happy to see both of you together.. The king of smartphone vloggers🧡
You can consider accessories, Android will take that point.
compromised quiz
Even though iphones would win for sure there are a lot of categories where I would have given it to Android. Also there's no way you give customisation to iOS. Same with amount of features. FaceTime and iMessage is not a feature, it's basically an alternative because US uses iphones more. Airdrop is kinda cool , but if we're just talking about the phones I'd say nearby share is almost as good, people don't use doesn't mean the feature isn't competent. And also screen. iPhone is good but most Android flagships match it and some even go ahead like samsung  Also eco friendly. First of all if you're gonna take averages fairphones and other definitely increase it a lot compared to others who decrease it , and in general iphones are known for their shit repairablity.  Another thing that's very underrated and kinda win for iOS, are the apps. iOS and apple in general have guidlines and less piracy and other systems in place which make it so that good apps are either exclusive to apple or have better versions which appear before their worse Android counterparts
Biased
This comparison is pretty subjective from person to person.
Bankai!
You guys are biased to iPhone, because it’s the one you use
won't anyone take storage or the accessories into consideration.
How could you possibly say that iphone has good display like android?
Being from Africa, Android is the better. Because of access and financial constraints.
Mkbhd is the best. Arun is a close runner up. You cannot compete with the OG !!
So basically the iPhone is the best all-around phone, but you can find particular Android phones that do any specific feature better than the iPhone.
The moment they gave apple the point for battery this video became a cap I mean Android phones are coming with 6000mah batterys with 250w fast chargers
WGOLE YEAR OLD but my phone is a gazillion years old
mkbhd... iPhone tilted from the base
I agree with marques on most of his points. i use both android and iphone and android has some crazy features like huge batteries fast charging “better” cameras ram etc and yet most of them are just “extra” you know they are not really used that much (for eg. Samsung zoom) but on the other hand iphone has few features but it does most of things extremely well and consistently too.
MKBHD is incredibly partial to Apple products. He always was. I don't expect anymore from him. But I expected more of a fair comparison from your side Arun. Disappointed that it wasn't. I just can't believe you gave a tie for display with that hideous notch from 2018. I for one use the split screen a lot. I also can't stress enough the convenience of having the type C port for all round connectivity which you didn't even mention. I'm sure having type c is way more important to a lot of people than face time and imessage. Air drop may be good, but Android's Nearby share is almost just as good. There's also a 100 other things that Android is better at. You just conveniently missed it out.
This video is has made me really sad... Because I love android...
android takes the W on battery.
Android on average without weighting everything by price is just stupid. Also, wth is Android on average?
"android had more many features than iOS... so is a draw".... wtf hahaha
It is actually so bright that it feels bright. -Arun
hi
So much androidtards in the comment section  malding over the opinion of these 2 guys. Damn.
I’m a iPhone user but I see that android phones have opened up a lot of opportunities to people to own a smartphone than iOS can. Mainly because the starting price of a Android device is nearly a 10th of the lowest priced iOS device.  In terms of a first step towards smartphone and smart apps then android is a winner. Not everyone can afford even the cheapest model of iPhone. Just my thoughts.
Love the vid but why is he sitting down
Things on iPhone are too weak for me or irrational.  13:40 Actually faster charging is thing for most Androids users. AirDrop? There is default cloude software, but u have to initiate by ourself this on non-Android device like Windows. If we talk about small things, there are habits.  Anyway, iPhones are still very good smartphones.
Love that you guys collaborated to make this video.  I hope I see more of these in the future.  I love watching both channels for tech news.  Great video.  I am more on the Android side though lol
This video is sponsored by Apple I guess
Fun fact the iphone screen is made by LG/SAMSUNG
So much androidtards in the comment section  malding over the opinion of these 2 guys. Damn.
After using an iPhone and then using an Android phone, I would choose Android, even if I was offered an iPhone 13 Pro Max. I am never using anything made by Apple again. My mum also likes Android better and my dad couldn't care what phone he uses. He could still be very happy with a Windows Phone.
King Apple
Half way through the video and I'm done. MKBHD is the reason iSheep word exist.😐
The GOAT with the GOAT. Best 2 Tech YouTubers by far, together. It's like Lebron and Curry on the same team, this is awesome!
this is not it  display to apple??? wild video
As someone who's worked in wireless for the last 7 years I'd definitely say that depending on the device AndroidOS is more stable, we constantly have people coming into my Verizon store with troubleshooting issues on their iPhone's, its seriously like a 9-1 ratio of iPhone issues to AndroidOS issues, Whats more is im on Arun's team about Camera, I definitely think something like the S22 Ultra offers way more versatility and better quality than the iPhone, from 100x zoom to 8k video even if it's only 24fps, especially since App developers are finally starting to make Samsung specific versions of their apps like Snapchat for instance.
I feel like iPhone got points undeserving for eco friendly and photography. Only truly outshines android on battery life and videography.   Feel like 4/6 or 3.5/6.5 was more fair result.
Well, it depends on what type of user you are. Some people like to use mod apk which you can't use on ios so yeah, it depends on the user.
After watching this video, I can say MKBHD is a apple fan boy and loves apple a lot. In my opinion Android is the best and apple is just a luxury brand which is just removing necessary things like headphone jack, SD card, chargers from the box making repairs more difficult and making huge profits by setting worse trends in market.  After all of that no one hates apple. In my opinion apple is now the worst brand and I can't support apple anymore.
This type content is great talking about battery life and fast charging and the dynamics I really do Hope Samsung can improve like apple in the battery department and the iPhone improve more like Samsung with screen and graphics perhaps no notch but apple need to stop being greedy and implement USB type c on the mobiles for charging or come out with some iron man movie Jarvis Technology otherwise Mobile phones do not have the WOW factor!  What would be a nice treat is A apple foldable with amazing long battery life foldable phones with great durable screens and water proof dust proof with extra heap long lasting 48 hour battery life  🤣  Funny that the world gov have the technology we haven’t even smelt yet light years ahead of us!
which user cares about eco friendly or not? just making comparison to make iphone win
I really liked the vid and enjoy the collabs with you two. I hope you are having a good time :)
I fully admit that iphones do some things better. It is fast and reliable however, i can't shake the feeling that everything i do is done "apple" way?. restricted. Forces you into their eco system. I like android because it gives freedom. I can customize, sideload and still have 120hz and decent performance that can run majority games in full setting.
Only one quality of android blasts apart ios. The ease of using the phone and customizing it to the core. Plus a very less dependence over laptops to achieve almost every use case. I couldn't forget nightmares I had with my iphone 5s. For almost every casual usage I was rushing onto my laptop like downloading files. Android is so good at it. I barely depend upon my laptop. I couldn't forget how easily I signed various pffs using my samsung galaxy note 9 s pen which even todays iphone 13 pro max couldn't achieve. Android rocks.
Display should be an easy win for Android/ Samsung here . Wtf marques
I use multitasking many times, mostly YouTube in the background and browsing the internet in the front.
Android wins 100%
There’s no better or perfect phone. It depends on what phone you like and prefer. Both platforms has is advantages and disadvantages.
Let me summarize the title. Apple - Just because of the battery life. Fight me but with proof. Im an android user thats why I know battery sucks.
No outro : my day is ruined
The lighting was beautiful i dont know what you're talking about Arun (i think )
Samsung is superior over an iphone
These guys are virgins.
Sense some bias towards the Iphone........
I love seeing how strongly pissed android users get with these videos. They are quite literally the Linux users of the smartphone world, writing essays as to why android is better. As a former enthusiast, this is one of the more pathetic things about being an android fan
Iphone user here, im ok with the results but iPhone could improve SO much. I feel the camera experience has gotten worse over the years for ios. It should have a “begginer mode” with a few features and a “pro mode” with a lot of control over everything.
Simply Android with one UI is far better than iPhone .
Amazing! Two of the best Youtubers!! No clickbait, no flashiness, humble. Pure content! Awesome!!
I love your videos and great colllab, but this video felt less like "what is better" but more like "what I like better". In my opinion this topic is becoming pointless, since every argument stayed almost the same through recent years (besides some like battery improvement on iPhone f.e.) and it boils down to personal preference. Both are great in their own way. BUT someone who likes Apple's ecosystem and convenience will never give up iOS, even if iPhone was mediocre at everything and scored 0/10 in this video, same goes other way around for Android users. Also it mostly felt pretty much like another Samsung vs iPhone comparison. a lot of important points in favor of Android phones were left out, maybe because we often take them for granted now. SD card slot, headphone jack (yes, even in 2022), foldables, better speakers, physical shutter button, the list may go on. And I feel that when Apple catches on something Android had had for years, suddenly everyone somehow loses their minds and iPhone gets a "score" on such lists. Also (slight nitpicking :P) is it stock Android vs iOS? Or Android phone vs iPhone? I get it, but also the titles become confusing sometimes. Cheers!
Arun is trying his best to save the android but...
Am i the only one who thinks that Arun Completely Overshadowed Marques in this Video🤔🙄🤔
I just like my customization and how free i am with choices with Android I also don't like the Iphone fanbase and refuse to join people who think bubble color is more important than life
Great video praising the iphone... 🫥
This is the first time I didn't agree with your scores. Androids are more reliable, better camera, more customizable to the point  which makes the newest iphone look like an android 8/9
Disagree with results.
I have both a s9 and a 12, far far prefer my S9, rooted and modded, but even on basic software it's better in every way, customizations and options are better with Android, iPhone is set up to be simple, very few customizations, look how long dark mode came to it, , honestly, having had both phones, would never buy a iPhone with my own money, very fortunate to have the opportunity to test drive both, and I'm sticking with Android, till the day I die.
I’ve had freezing up issue with couple apps. When i open the app it doesn’t crash but freezes up and nothing works. I have get out and delete it from App switch and open back up again.
i'd say android is superior in its own way and same goes for iphone also being superior IN its own way.
Were they paid by apple for this ?
i don't think so its a fair one comparison.... okay i agree with them that iphone is a winner but with a lead of 6 lol seriously... and the comparison i guess is according to their perspective and everyone has its own perspective... there should be poll btw android and apple than we will se which one winss...
I know huawei is not android anymore but i would like you guys to compare to iphone. Even though they didn't release mate 50 pro, mate 40 pro still compareable with iphone 13 pro max.
I feel like Arun was saying so many positives for IPhone because he switched from Android to Iphone
All I can say is : *BIASED*
The cross over i never expected to want
Not fair comparison & point distribution bcz everything can't able to buy 13 pro Max for 120hz screen.
Man wtf are they serious?? Tbh android in general is wayyy easier to use has more customisation and better value for money than any iPhone. I ain't hating I'm actually a fan of both but its not going to sit straight with me after all the baseless unfair comparisons you did in this video. Both android and iPhone have their goods and bads but my man just went out crushing android, lol!
All the way android really
I think samsung s22's camera is better than iphone
Y'all crazy
Like seriously how can we compare a lagging phone to a smooth non-lagging phone 🤷🏿‍♂️
Great video sir
The title should be Two Apple fan boys Destroyed Andriod......
Nice
and for the points....lol....if you give a general opinion and not a personal opinion, I think andriod will be voted more
Iphone is always Iphone and Android is always Android😄 Both are totally different so I'll will not compare🙂
Some of the new android phoens also have 4k wich is very nice
In my eyes iPhone loses at least 0.5 point in envinronment category just by having proprietary charging port
I think many people in this chat (me included) are going to disagree with your opinion... 😂 But that is also the fun of it, keep the conversation going (and positive) 😁
I think the reason that Android lost a fair few categories is that it is not about one single manufacturer. Some features are defining ones for some manufacturers like Motorola's Chop Chop for flashlight and Samsung's Dex and even Xiaomi's ridiculous community support. This is the beauty and weakness of Android. That fact that Android is little imperfect, it encourages you to make your own contribution towards it without caring about getting sued or anything. Android has a more playful aesthetic and is built for nerds like me but iOS has a few constraints. I love the fact that rooting is so easy on Android and you can use apps like GCam Port.
Looking forward to iOS 16 and the iPhone 14 👌
Lol I half of the video and Android is getting boomed
I think Android is a software and iPhone is a hardware.. not sure if this is the best comparison!..
Do you want to know the true winner? "I want an iPhone but I cant afford it."
I think its not fair to compare one brand of phone with many other  beacuse different android companies can make specific thing in phones to beat iphone
iPhone is so polished, but for me it's the choice aspect that keeps me away. I also have very niche desires for automation and multitasking. Awesome video tho you guys are great!
Am I the only one disagreeing and thinking android's been cheated. Like how can you call the screen a draw. And the sustainability bit, literally every android phone is easily repaired compared to the iPhone. Don't get us started on the usb c bit. They jus[ brushed the mulifunctionality of android like it's never used by the majority. this comparison wasn't fair to the androids. Like at all
Iphone has 5 years of updates - yes. But the features that the latest Iphone gets with the latest update, is way more than a 5 year old Iphone with the same update. It's better than not having an update at all though.
Great discussion. It's hard to generalize Android because there are so many. Android should have been specifically noted within the same price class. I'd say Android takes the screen (Apple catching up). I'd also say Android takes camera, but loses video (this is coming from a pixel user). The camera app lag is a thing though. Android customization is better than  Apple, same with software (think of how many Google apps are everywhere). I recognize Google doesn't necessarily mean Android. I agree with the outcome but the score should be a little different
Ur completely supporting apple 👎
1:49 that’s what she said
Really great video.   MKBHD : Samsung and Vivo do it very well. iPhone isn't bad either.   Point to iPhone . 🤣
I have 13 Pro Max and miss my Samsung everyday.
Android wins, Just not against my jailbroken iPhone 📲 🤷🏻‍♂️✍️.
Mkbhd has no idea what hes talking about . Samsung forever
Software Features and Camera should have gone to the Android. I dont know but for the first time this felt like a sponsored video where Android was staged to fail !!!!!
⚠️JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON. BELIEVE IN HIM. JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN⚠️
Wait this video is about iPhone vs Samsung Galaxy
I bought a 350 dolars S20 Fe, no Iphone can compete with that
Mkbhd is an iPhone fanboy, I follow him for years this is what i have noticed
Also, I think you should have included an accessories ecosystem topic. Then you could have covered connector types as well.
You guys don't multi window!? Omg! That's the best thing ever! I can't live without it!
This video is really flawed: categories like features is definitely an android win, if we are comparing Android as a whole then androids are more eco-friendly due to Apple's anti-repair efforts, photography is close but androids should've won, based on their own arguments battery would be a draw (the whole fast charging vs long battery life). The score should be alot different
Great content
Samsung photo camera is wayyyy better than iPhone camera...I have used both. For videos iPhone is better
imagine what could be possible if apple and samsung/android were to work together
I think Android gets 10 point just for being affordable to almost everyone.  Sometime I think of a world without Android where im still using Nokia its literally a nightmare.
Sorry. i have to disagree with apple product on environment thing. They denied reparability, purchase of charger which they didn't include and the super thick boxes...
I mostly agree with all the points, but although the ratings seesaw in IPhones favour, that's not an absolute metric to base your choice on, because, with photos for example, iPhone wins, so that's 1 point towards Apple, but the difference is between 95% good on the Samsung and 98 % on the iPhone, so yes iPhone wins overall, but doesn't mean that Samsungs phone lose in that category, just doesn't win. I am sticking with the S22 Ultra. Love my phone.
I think mkbhd is a die hard fan of apple products 😂 and Arun is an Android fan
This mkbhd guy is so biased. A long term Android user, I switched to an iPhone 13 mini and for the price point it’s horrible. Terrible battery, below average camera, gets hot using camera/video calls, and hangs while playing games (score, genshin impact)  Not to mention some apps just don’t work (Feedly, DHL). The microphone sucks and the vibration motor is bad too  Waiting for Mate 50 Pro to switch to Android again.
Wooh! Apple is finally able to afford two biggest tech youtubers ✌️
Feels like you bought iPhone fan to talk on 😆
Bruh that video is extremely biased towards apple🤡
This is better than Spider-Man No Way Home
Wow who would have thought google fan boy Marques prefers iphone.
i think the gap will keep shrinking and when it will be negligible, we might shift to a completely different experience of AR or VR, that will be the begining of a new fight. tried so hard gone so far in the end  it doesn't even matter😂
Damn top guys going against eachother
lightning cable is just a deal breaker for Iphone..
2 legends,1 frame
12:53 There is something like AirDrop on android, perticulary samsung with their ,,Nearby Share''
Anythime theres mkbhd apple always wins for no reason
im using S22 ultra and i also have iPhone but here's the thing the iphone Sucks 😞😞 as a developer i love Android
I’m a iOS user and will always be a iOS user 🫡
In terms of software a simple argument is that android can do everything ios can do but ios cannot do even 70% of all that android can do. And once again locking customers in with apple specific applications isn't a feature
This is the situation were a apple person is just convinced and asking Android person to purchase apple phone...it's ok we have done that and back to Android..
they're both good, it's just preference
Seems like my comments are getting deleted. I don't know if it's intentional but I'm just stating my opinion. I'm not those fake guys with checkmarks using bots and pasting irrelevant comments here, nor am I the ones we see in replies scamming people 🤷‍♂️ Censorship on a tech video? Could be? I hope it's just something wrong about comment detecting algorithm.
super bias
It's always awesome to see them both in one video. They are both extremely good at what they do, what I really like, is that at no point in the video, do they try to over show each other, respect!
So biased lmao
There is a MASSIVE pillar on android that you guys forgot: The back button. I can live easily without face time, messages, etc, they have alternatives. I can't live without the android Back button
Is it just me or this video was more of Samsung v Apple rather than android v ios
How come you have not tested Huawei P50 Pro bro?
2 best Tech Reviewers on the planet compile this so unbeliveably well together. Keep up the awesome work both! 😎💪
19:39 congrats on already breaking ur rule to be in bed by 11pm lol
Câmera, battery and security.  This days any android flagship beats iOS. Sick of you youtubers being paid by apple and make people believe otherwise…
Samsung s22 ultra is way better than apple y'all talking crap 🤮
its crazy how one company is fighting against a group of companies and then winning it
Just a ad for Apple..pretty biased with recycling , display and battery
Definitely enjoyed it.  It was quite illuminating to watch and hear your back and forth on each of the topics. Really well done. Thanks
USB C vs Lightning cable??
He wanted to give you a fist bump, you missed it 😒 Btw, great video. Finally it ends down to the end user 😊
totally biased video 😓
wut are these emojis
+Anything that will ensure a point 4 androif, it will be a tie +Eco,software support and update was Ip,tie and ip? All three of them should be Android, full stop. Who the hell in this world think Ios have better support and update than Android?
Bro just say the iPhone is the better phone and move on 😂
By photography has the s22 ultra more options with the telezoom and looks same good. This is more a draw or a point for android
iPhone all the wayyy💪🏻
Using an iPhone is like living in a hotel, you can't paint or change the furnitures  Using an Android is like owning your house 🏠 do whatever you like!
Another quality upload, great to see you both together on the same screen. iPhone for me all the way, it just works!
a typical apple biased guy
The ability to sideload apps is a big point that should be considered
what the heck!!!!!!!!android!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MKBHD is a bit bipolar 🙄
Well. Samsung has airdrop aka quickshare and duo as facetime😂
Wow apple promotional ad video
There were just hating on the Samsung phone because they use a iPhone
Omg, hiii I love you guysss!
Iphones in general for some reason have been very good in geekbench , but isn't as ahead in other benchmarks.  Also, iOS ram feels good not just because of optimisation, but because it just kills app much more aggressively
Woww.. you both are my favorite video creators!!!
I think it's full time Android stop supplying Apple with parts 💯 there's no way apple gets so much score over Android
you dont how to compare
I was hoping to learn something from this... I don't trust fan boys.
Do iPhones allow you to add more Virtual Memory/Pagefile like some Android phones do (RAM Plus)?
I feel like some of these results were a bit biased towards apple
Reliability being a draw is the biggest shocker.  Unless something has changed in the past few years, since during that time I've been using iOS exclusively, Android's OS reliability is noticeably worse than that of the iPhone.  A big part of reliability, IMO, doesn't even have to do with the OS itself.  Even if we said Google and Apple both have equal system-wide reliability (I would argue against that, but say we concede that), you have to consider the reliability of the apps within each OS.  I have just found that the same apps usually work better more often on the iPhone for whatever reason.  Maybe that's unfair since it has more to do with third party developers rather than Apple vs Google, but it must be a factor one considers in overall reliability, IMO.  Anyway, this was a great video.  And I'm glad it's not one of the overly-perfected videos we normally get from this channel (although the content is stellar, don't get me wrong; anytime you get MKBHD or Arun giving smartphone opinions, you watch that video!).  That leads me to believe you are taking seriously your pledge to improve your mental and physical wellbeing.  And that, that is awesome :)
The screen on iPhone is nowhere near better. Nor was it tie.  -Samsung at least have better screen such as AMOLED, which is a higher quality than normal OLED -Also higher resolution, even if you don't care that it's a little higher, Samsung still has more pixel per inch.   Performance and Battery were fair. iOS tends to be more optimized and no one really uses multitask and that. Ram doesn't really matter for iPhones since their OS is optimized. But USB type C is better. It charges faster when you need it. (but it wears the battery down faster), but there are options to get the fullest of your battery life in settings where the phone slow down the charging when it hits 80%.  Camera- I guess iPhones cameras are good since their AI is smart and can make the photos look good even though their camera megapixels are low, but I'd say that Samsung cameras aren't bad, not that it should've lost to Apple's camera, Samsung megapixels are high, and their zooms are useful too, might not use it every time but still uses it quite often. And their AI aren't too far away from Apple's. But in Mrwhostheboss video for camera test. Samsung won. So I have no idea why it's different here.  Software reliability- You can make vibrate motor higher, and I think both phone can be annoying from time to time.  Software features-Both have their own things,  Samsung DEX- I don't personally use it, but for some people it's helpful.  iMessage, FaceTime and Airdrop- It's only important for those who uses iPhones, like I use messenger or Snapchat to do the exact same thing. But Airdrops are actually useful for quick share instead of sharing links and that through apps. (Not a huge point tho)  But one thing about Android thats amazing is that I can just go on the internet and download anything, like Youtube Vanced, Snaptube, Adguard (iOS have it as well, but its just for browser whereas on android its for apps as well), and many things that are much better to have.
felt Arun was biased towards Apple, if Android is better at something, just look for something apple kind of matches and then it's a draw, disappointed
I am not gonna trust any of their reviews anymore
So happy to see you both collab!! You 2 are legit my favorites on this platform
Brooo i don't agree with black guy.
No comment on the way apple batteries always die really quickly after a few years compared to their competitors lol
Hi mrwhostheboss please put the link of your iphone wallpaper of this video I really liked that Hop you reply to me
Pixel 6 Pro here. To me, the most relevant metric when deciding on phones is which brings you the most excitement and joy to use.   Of course, other factors SHOULD be considered; but none are as important as interaction.  Good job guys.
They literally said iPhone screen are better than android💀
And this video came out very well. Great job
Anything that dictates class is only for dictators .. u choose r u mass or dictator
Mkbhd the isheep w@nka
MKBHD hasn't used the vivo flagship. So the camera comparison is very unfair.
Baised video
Biased ... Androids could have had a better score...
0:26 yes the screen has a speciality that is we can easily understand it's a iphone
Just had an apple ad before the video😂 That’s a clear statement
Please don't forget the part when Apple sponsored you, android phones especially Samsung are at their peak right now. Don't bullshit with us / UNSUBSCRIBING
defentily Iphone doesn't have a better battery..
I have been using a samsung for years and I haven't felt anything bad about it. The one ui 4 is actually a good software, the camera is average, since my phone is 2 years old. I also used to use a samsung before upgrading to a s20+ 5g 2 years ago. The software is very well optimized.
The last handshake was noice,lol
Moral of the story if you care about price and value get Android. If you don't care than get the iPhone.
After using Android all my life until about a month ago, I prefer IOS. Much more refined, their battery life claims are actually true. And everything is significantly smoother and more luxurious.
Huawei have the same seamless connection between their devices like of apple,I fell into the huawei ecosystem accidently with mate 40 pro ,mate book ,watch gt2 pro ,and band 6 ,they are interconnected so beautifully and every aspect of the phone is incredible ,kirin never loose their performance with time ,of the ban hadn't occured it would have been a mate in Arun's hand in place of Samsung
Posting something controversial on a tech channel and instantly getting essays from fellow tech “experts” on why you were wrong 😂
When your mind is set on one product you won't see the good things of other  Andriod is far better than the iPhone...
In a lot of categories, I do think Android does it much better. Its use of usb-c and being easy to repair, is really what helps it to make it sustainable. Not having to be locked in a family of products is incredibly helpful as well. Another thing that I could not fathom is how you're limited in what you can and cannot download, which makes transferring files, a guessing game. Since I've switched to Android, I cannot see myself switching back to iPhones.
Display- android easily  Performance- tie Battery- iphone easily  Features- android easily  Photos- android easily  Video- iphone easily  Software support- iphone  Pricing- android  Reliability- tie  Categories that should be here.  Customization- android  Freedom- android  Fast charging- android   Eco-friendly- idk but honestly people generally don't buy phones with this in mind, why is this a category but customization isn't.
You really shouldn’t go average Android vs iPhone. Androids can cost as low as around 50 dollars.
I am now an Apple user & I love it..
fun fact, it’s iPhone vs. every phone.
Great video and so fun to watch. However I felt like this could have been a direct comparison of iPhone flagships vs Samsung/Pixel/Huawei flagships or iOS vs Android, as opposed to iPhone vs Android. Although it doesn't seem like there's any difference (because iPhones are the only phones that run iOS), notice how they kinda had to compare the  best features from multiple phones to the only (premium) offerings of iPhones available. Of course, its not their fault that they had to do it this way, but it would be fairer to people trying to make practical choices if the overall software performances of the two OSs were highlighted over the hardware components since each Android phone handles the OS differently and most users are really only going to be able to afford one flagship.  That way, the comparison would be a lot less assymetrical and could also help us in the audience who  really want to see a direct comparison. To be fair still, most people already know what they like and are just here for the entertainment so this is just a rambling suggestion I guess 😂.
MKBHD iPhone simp
Andoid and iphone
I would just like to ask why this debate is still ongoing, if you compare the best iPhone to the best android then the performance and quality will be on-par.  it comes down to preference, not which one is "better".
ngl I wish my s21 would take better pictures in other apps
you forgot type c, foldable phones , fingerprint sensor
mkbhd is a fake reviewer he only uses iphone and pretends to know a lot about other phones without using it
Finally!!! This collab was needed👍🏾
Wow, it's no wonder that even more Android users are switching to iPhones as if last year's iPhone 13's beat out all Android phones then imagine what this year's all-new insane iPhone 14's are about to do. 💯😁
Mkbhd is an apple fan boy 😅
tbh with smartphones u want / have to change em every year or 2 due to faster hardware or cause u have brake somthing cause u use em every day and u have it with u all the time , just cause of this i would go with android. Imo the value is there especially with brands like realme or oneplus. For me iphone cost just to much. But the ipad have competitive pricing  , and very strong software/ hardware and u can keep it for 5-6+ years. I dont know how the apple have manage this to release the best value product and the worst one at the same time....every year.
Android is♥️
Interesting to post the same survey to the community, same questions, same rate system and then see what everyone thinks ..
A very unfair comparison
Android is the only king for me
Android 🎤drop
Android defines Freedom
I'm so sad Android top not
nothing but class . thank you sirs !
Change the ordinary thumbnail. That's a bad thumbnail for an extraordinary video which is a Collaborative video but not an ordinary one
I love seeing these two together
Android has always been better
Couldn't disagree to a video lol...
MKBHD once said the Iphone 13 pro camera gives you 9/10in every shot, and some android phones go up to 10 / 10 sometimes. And back to 7/10 other times. I think this applies to everything to me not only cameras and that’s why I prefer Iphone. I still cannot stand the fact that I can’t customise the home screen on iPhone specially that it’s huge now I want few apps at the bottom of the home screen but Apple said nope 🙂
Great Content Creators. Disappointing Content. Customisation, Battery/charging, Display, Repairability/Greener, Memory expansion at Zero Cost, USB C, App cost low, Freedom to experiment between brands/features.  The ends justifies the means, I suppose...
What? The both of you doing a sheep video? Lol did not expect that.
1:06 69%
Bottom line between Android phones & iphone; which OS sells more?
I'm ok with almost everything they said except the camera, like, the s22 and s21 have a much more vivid video and foto. And it just looks like the real thing that you are looking at, then obviously there's the zoom that's much better on android
I have to disagree most of point.. USB C ,anti right to repair behavior (eco friendly????) Cam ?? Really best?? Customization minority??? Are you kidding right 😂😑 you remind mejority is dum lazy ppl hmm. IDK why the hell apple wins anyway.
I love iphone
The comparison is not fair. When the screen is better for the Samsung, you give the points equally because the result is close. But when you compared the photography and it was also close, even though the treatment in the Samsung is better, you gave the point to the iPhone, if it was close, why did you not do as you did with the screen????
So much cap in this video.
How much do you want to hurt your credibility by inviting these Apple C*ck succers and doing iPhone vs Apple?
I think the number of dislikes jusy in short period of time just showed fans don't want you doing this kind of video
12:53 Android has an AirDrop-like feature called Nearby share
Mkbhd is a major apple fan. It's hard to be objective in this and you can't put a number on certain things so it's hard to make a fair comparison.
Still Android's Love ❤️
I don't think I like this comparison at all...🤦🏾‍♂
That's what I'm saying all the times Android cool "little" features it's not important in the long run lol IPhone however with FaceTime, AirDrop, iMessage and the smoothness of instant connect with every Apple Device is a Big Win for me.
i will go for Android and I think marques is fond of iPhones, I mean seriously iPhone wins the battery no way because some Android phones have 10000 mah battery
For me it's still android cause i could just buy chargers for it not like apple devices but for style and aesthetics I'll pick iphone so when i accidentally broke it atleast it broke with style
I might be wrong but he should have done suicraty I spelt that wrong
(Android - apple)  (Low security - high security) (Customizable - not customizable) (Cheap - expensive) (Chip ages faster and gets slower - chip lasts longer) [in terms of performance] (Low repair price - ridiculous repair price) (Some downloaded apps may not work well - fully optimized to all devices) (Too many types and chips to choose from - a few amount of chips to choose from) (Expandable storage - storage can’t be expanded) (Too many features and can be used with a pc easily - a handful of features but hard to connect with a pc) (Latest phones has higher resolution and beautiful colors - same for them) (Tablets are still junks and unoptimized - iPads are actually the only best portable tablet out there till now) (pirated apps no need to pay for the actual app - the app you want is paid? Then buy it)  These were just some major things I knew about the two however everyone has his own opinions and it doesn’t matter which you think it’s the best or not after all a phone is a phone, and you use it for what you like.
Best Video I've seen about Android vs iPhone... Of course coming from the best tech nerds. Dankeschön!!!
the display cant be a draw its obvious samsung takes it
while a lot of these points are accurate and imo apple makes the better phone, i still think this was pretty biased. i dont understand how samsung lost at screen, given it has a smaller camera footprint and simply has a higher resolution display. in addition to that, i dont understand how sideloading wasn't mentioned. and the camera on the samsung simply is better. that being said, im still not surprised that that happened, since MKBHD is known for being an apple fanboy. in the end, however, it all comes down to what the user wants from a phone, and what they personally prefer
😂😂 now what android
I am surprised you didn’t consider privacy of user data at all !!
i noticed they moved the goal posts a lot for apple to win  some of the categories it won
Apple paid to them make this video
I would give eco-mindedness, photos, and customizability to android. Apples e-waste, throwing away perfectly good phones and fighting right-to-repair is a very serious issue. The photos is just a personal opinion. For customizability, if android has had it for way longer and apple is just starting to catch up, then android deserves the point.
Lol screen belongs to android. It shouldn't be a tie. S22 ultra has the best screen on a smart phone.
Love this colab! Great video!
Apple's are for the rich and Androids are for us common people.
Just 2 minutes 10 seconds in, and you already lost my interest.. where companies are trying thier best to eliminate notch, you gave s22 and iphone a draw?? Who are you?? Are you even an tech enthusiast???
Expect a HUGE PRICE HIKE on the next iPhone
Is this sponsored?!
Next time bring in more than one other opinion ... like 4 more minimum
The only reason I would hesitate going back to iPhone is the lack of alway on display.
Mkbhd is so bias with iphone
It's not really fair how this was compared. I feel like you have to choose an android phone like s22U and compare that. You can't say is android green yes but let's pick the less green one to win the category.
I don’t care what you would talk but find a way and please you two do something together. I really enjoyed the video even I disagree some of the categories like customization.
most tech enthusiasts know there's different advantages on either but androids have so many choices and features
I am an Android user and lover. But I agree with them at every point.
This was really a fan experience video, rather than anything objective. Apple fanboying at that. Apple winning on environmental benefits....really? Gotta be joking, guys. On camera, Samsung is objectively technically better than Apple, yet....an Apple win? Come on.   I don't even have a bias here and I see this as an unofficial Apple advert.  Sigh.
Stoped at 4 minutes, so i don't know how it ends and who won... but then again... i DON'T CARE... i don't like apple and their policies. ANDROID all the way, i faster buy (again) a Huawei than an apple phone. When apple is confronted with the right to repair movement they look away... why is that?? Because they LIKE to "SCAM" people... "- Your screen don't work because has water damage and needs to be changed" ... "-How much???" ... "- 1200 dollars" ... "-Thanks!!" ... "-hey Louis Rossmann... can you fix this?" ... "- Lets see what we got!" ... ... ... conclusion... cable screen bend pin . Louis fix it in 10/15 minutes (i think) and i bet the client didn't pay 1200 bucks for the fix. I can't scam people it's not my nature but... apple does it everyday and people still buy their produts ... maybe that's why i'm not rich... maybe i should scam people like they do. NOT ...
The fact that the iPhone is up against hundreds of android phones is an absolute win for iPhone.
android is far better than apple..and mkbhd i think always supports iphone.
Thank you for saying that iOS have bug, glitch, or some problem too...i thought its a myth😆
The fact that the iPhone is up against hundreds of android phones is an absolute win for iPhone.
The fact that the iPhone is up against hundreds of android phones is an absolute win for iPhone.
Still team Android lol. One big reason. Customization.
If find it unfortunate, that you didn't talk about the repair problems the IPhones have, as well as the monopoly Apple is trying to build. That is personally the biggest reason why I basically boycott them, even if they've got great features because of said monopoly.
Wow. Marques is officially an Apple fanboy!
I think it's the first video which disappointed me! Such a biased comparison!
This is like mkbhd giving some different view to Arun on each discussion 😅
Lmao now poor android fanbois barking in the comment section 🤣🤣🤣
Ifs preference too if u let two diff people do this video it could be mkre towards Android. I used ios once and I hated it. Android i like how features are first 120hertx took apple so long they look the same and its like following the heard. I think fhe user experience on Android is better.  Akso fhe features like I message all that crap matter to people because its apple if apple released fhe Samsung dex there version it would be used more and more popular just because its apple. I like Android nig screen clear screen HD stuff looks better on it. I dony care about i message it a green ir blue bubble its so dumb. I see more that high-school and under kids all want apple cahsd they think that is ghe thing to gdg aloy of adults transfer to Android
Great video as always. However, the ability to unlock bootloader and having heaps of options in Custom ROM world to choose from, tips the scale for me in favour of Android. Apart from that, strongly disagree on the take with customisation where most Android skins, even bare Android 12, are miles ahead of iOS.
i honestly love both of them. this collab was too good for me to comprehend and i loved EVERY SECOND! 💗💗
What ever they say is their views but normal people are not like them that's why some points goes to Android it seems like buyer's towards iPhone
Loved the video
Apple v/s all the other phones 😂
my two favourite tech youtubers in the same room
OMG iPhone wins😃🎉
What about fingerprint scanner and night photos and audio
I still use a 512GB Note 20 ultra.  I'll never upgrade to the newer models without the SD card slot.
have you ever noticed those Samsung doesn't have to do a lot of advertisements for their phones they just say here it is if you want it this is what it can do every other commercial on TV is buying iPhone this get a discount that every new offer is iPhone iPhone it's like apple is shoving iPhone down your throat because they want you to buy it but like I say if you want to do things easily the Apple ecosystem you're kind of locked in but if you want freedom versatility customizability something that's more of a computer where you can actually use with Windows and do PC like things which also includes an s pen which can be very convenient for certain situations galaxy s22 is the way to go. not everything on this planet is Apple yes they came out first with it but a lot of people don't know that Samsung designed Apple screens for a long time and some of their components. that's where Apple never designed anything of samsung. if you're in the Apple ecosystem stick with apple but if you're in the Android ecosystem Samsung is just fine. it really nowadays just depends on what you're trying to do and what you're looking for.
I loved this video 😍😍😍😍
20:06 that connected so well
Marques on the wrong white balance for the first time.
What a surprise. This has got to be worse video I've ever seen from this channel. Never seen such bias from neither of these guys
iOS just came from behind, stole all of Android's stuff, did it better, and now it's actually better overall....... Never underestimate the underdog 🤦🏻‍♂️
My man really pulled out genshin I bet u he just got the game did not even get the secret chest
biased? or nah?
you should’ve included emojis as a category 💀💀
Sadly MKBHD and mostly all Americans are biased towards iPhones and I don't really trust his opinion when you it comes to comparing, would have loved if you did this by yourself
still i wont gonna buy expensive phones  by greeyd company(if apple is) cause really like why do i care and what things i really get about it androids are really worthy like best value for a casual user who wants to get phone to have any app on it with ram and storage i am basically happy with my poco x3 pro with anything oni t love using google assitant i am actually fan of google too xiaomi so i really reccomend it
Once android gets established features to compete against facetime and air drop I think that's when apple will lose out. Right now there are options for it but not simple enough for the average user.
Totally bias
Android phone makers should have continuously built upon what they put into the phones. For example the Samsung s5 features dont exist today. Sadly,  Android features dont last.
Jesus mkbhd is hard apple fan boying because of the first one how is the apple even compared to Samsung when it comes to display
I never used hey Google and now with my iPhone i use Siri all the time.
I just can't agree with many of these points. I get that most of them are subjective, but I just can see it. I hoping for a fair comparison not a cherry picked one.
Makes sense doing such a video with the greatest apple fan boy ever. He even bought that stupid big airpods after he announced that they are basically a rip off xD
Before iphone 4 I was super user with two tophones at the time. Today all it we have integrate with each other and the expensive stupid and complicated server is scrapped. Would never shift from Apple. Don't care about politics. It's best for us
do this video again when Samsung invites you guys
isnt it sad that samsung is still trying to push bixby. What a joke. There are so many factors that come into play when deciding whats gonna be best for you. Iphone 12 against my S21, Iphone wins by miles except for the camera. Night shots on the S21 are amazing. However the stabilization of videos on the 12 just seem to be clearer.  The list goes on and on. It all comes down to personal needs and expectations of your phone.
I unsubscribed to MKBHD and stopped watching his videos a while ago because he is just an Apple apologist. HIs point point about the screen that it's the smoothest 120hz display due to touch sampling. WTF? Honor Magic 4 and plenty of other Androids have LTPO OLED and better touch sampling rate than iPhone. I don't know why he has to keep defending Apple even when they are just playing catch-up with other manufacturers and haven't actually done any real innovation in years. Apple were the first to remove headphone jack, they never had sd-card support, they took away the chargers and they are the worst when it comes to repairability.
I've been a long time Apple user with the ipod to the iPhone X got an update and it ruined my phones battery and Apple wanted to charge me to fix the issue they caused with me updating so I had enough and switched to Android with OnePlus 9 Pro and never going back at all ever!!!!
Android is better plus you have options
haft a point for displays ? the responsivness should go under performance... i thought android had that point in the bag
i'm simply disappointed with this video
Samsung has quick share link share duo share screen share etc. basically the same thing
Podcast shoot by cinematographer
All I can say is, Samsung is a Korean company while iPhone is made by Americans. if the reverse was the case and all the scenarios are constant, Samsung would be declared clear winner all the time. It is what it is!
You are past your bedtime
One question : How much were you paid? Honestly, I was just praising Arun's credibility and honesty to my brother and then he drops this....
Whatever u say, i feel more comfortable with my android with the more features and options they have
Dude I loved Ur videos so far but this video felt a lil rigged and u we're kinda biased towards iPhone I mean iPhone would've still one but not with such a big difference Anyways personal opinion Peace.
Android Supremacy 🔥
I would say that the split should be like 6 IPhone, 4 Android and I have a 13 Pro Max  USB C is huge, and some of the categories where points could be given to Android they just moved to next topic.
Bixby has got to be the least talked about feature of samsung which makes hell of an impact in real life. I've customized my phone so much with bixby routines and it's just so helpful. Smartphones reviewers have to really start talking about bixby features(bixby vision, routine, assistant, etc)
MKBHD has became kinda fan boy towards Iphone for couple of years. But for me smooth exp doesnt mean the best exp. Lotta restrictions in IPhone kills the experience. Where as in android phone, even with a lower price point you can get a huge value as per your preference. Plus Iphone's interface is like 'You will have to use it however we want you to' vs in android you can customize based on your likings
If you are genuinely conscious about the planet, buy a phone that doesn't require you to buy 2-3 other separate components
It is such a controversial topic you can't really take a side.  I mean like there are many many things android is better at and the same goes for apple but if you just step back and take a look at what you have then your opinion will change completely like if you have a MacBook a magsafe and a iPad there is no point to buy an Android but if you have HP or Dell a tablet and a Android compatible wireless charger then there is no use of an iPhone.
you guys didn't even considder lauchers for android phones
Boring video
Android is the best!
Why are you always get android side😩
I might be analysing it unfairly but I thought that MKBHD was doing to many "word plays" on his judgement. Many times it seemed like there were only positive aspects on the android devices compared to iOS devices, but then he ends his sentences with a bunch of things that don't mean much and end his phrases with "I think iPhones do better". It just seemed like he had his winner since the beginning of the video.
Android every day all day
Ok bist
Being I phone owner I felt this comparison was too biased towards iPhone.
This was really interesting and honest. I guess it shows various things: Why iPhone users are so unlikely to switch to Android, because just so how relliable those phones are. Why Android is basically the only choice for so many people in poorer markets and why die hard Android users defend it: because it has all kinds of perks and gimmicks that are simply cool. But, in the end, where there’s enough money, the bottom line is: Yeah, this is why there’s so much blue bubbles.
MKBHD seems so biased towards apple, just me? ;(
Was there an apple employee holding a gun to your head the whole time? I disagree about the screens and eco friednliness.
This comparison seems a little bias... i have a galaxy, and i've never had battery issues and the screen is far better then the iphone... and the pictures on galaxy is superior
Mkbhd is a typical fanboy NPC. Tesla 😱 iPhone 😱, sleek and plane no character 😱. He is empty.
Android vs Apple repair-ability would have been a good point too
MKBHD as a sales person for iphone -
I thought this would be an actual comparison between the two, not just an opinion
just lol
Iphone seems to be the perfect phone, but in the end the winner is the one you like to use.
Is this the roasting android video
The display is a draw just because its curved? And wait is this android vs iphone comparison or iphone 13 pro vs s22 U comparison? Cause last time I checked so many androids have flat screen Sorry I can NEVER agree that iphone screen is a draw with s22U that one notch kills everything for me.....zzzz
How you Got Geekbenh Score on S22 as it was Banned
Display is definitely not a tie. Samsung beats apple displays by a milestone. The smoothness, the quality, the premium feel is just phenomenal. Also simply put Android phones have more display than Apple display lol because of the notch and bezels
I would like to see battery comparison between Samsung have M51 which has 7000mah battery and samsung f62 (both an old phone but) vs Iphone... Which will win??? Last question, Does iphone allow ban app to use like Android does? Where you can download through browser and still can use ban app!? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
It's crazy how you messed up the rating that badly
I think there should be a category for side loading apps and not being tied to the OS default app store. This is the number one reason I am loyal to Android. It allows me to feel free with my device. The second reason is the third party support on Android.
Not a fair comparison tbh, iphone vs the whole android. 😂  Photography - android, videography - iPhone. Maybe 0.5 each.  Battery same as well, - charging android is faster and my S22 uktra lasts a long time as well.  Samsung has QuickShare, SPen, Good Lock, and tons more features. In features category android tbh wins.   Side note: the S21 Ultra does look amazing still btw! Loving the collab 💙
So much biased.
If apple made iPhone SE Plus it would be best phone imo.

Android vs iPhone? You mean "OS" vs "Manufacturer"? Like "Audi vs. bicycle"? Why not compare Android vs iOS, or Samsung vs Apple, or HTC vs Apple?
Safety and security and privacy are iphone top priority and it works. No spam!!
It seems that *almost* no matter what, Apple beats everything in the whole world. Even if companies are attempting to pass them.
yeah.. No.. Never gonna leave all the freedom in android and go into apple walls. Androids like your buddy.. You can do whatever. Iphones like your guardian or stuff like that.. like always serious. If I dont like the launcher in android I simply install another app that does this particular job better. Not in the case of iphone
I use both and currently have the S22 Ultra but it is kinda hard to argue here if you throw biased opinions out the window and look at stats. iPhone statistically does majority of everything better besides display and customization. Performance, stability, battery life, overall camera package, and longevity all go to Apple and you just have to tip your cap to them. Yes their ecosystem will suck you in and not friendly with others but it just makes it's seamless.
And rawD😂😂
iPhone = lame
Android is open source
Waiting for scammers to reply my comment
So yes, the boss is hitting the gym. Evident
Awesome video. That self critique at the end…. As a former audio/video enthusiast, I get it. But as a fan and subscriber. I don’t care if you’re talking into a cellphone in a wind tunnel and yelling at the mic. Here for you and your content bro. The fact that you work hard to make it excellent quality is just the cherry on top! It was nice seeing both of you in one video!
All i can say out of US, Android is rocking it.
i kinda dont like these phone review vids cuz they make me really jealous
I have not watched the video yet, but i can for sure that they are gonna say "it depends " in the end.
As much as you can complain about iphones and hate on them you really have to acknowledge the fact that quite literally just one phone (iphone 13 pro) was compared to all different phones in each category and it still won in most of them, it's preety embarrassing for android if you ask me.
I personally feel its about preference. Cos I know I'll never pick ios over an android (Samsung)
so this is what markezz thinks not mutual agreement...
I believe that's this is honestly an unfair comparison because android factors in a lot of different companies small and big with a lot of different phones with a lot of different ways of doing different things lol against iOS of Apple which is just one giant company that has been out for a long time and have optimised their products to perfection.....this would've been better if it was iPhone iOS experience Vs Samsung Android experience or pixel android experience, or xiamo  seeing as these  are some of the most used android products imo
iPhone is not this stable thing where everything works great, some things work way worse than on android phones. For example the files app is the biggest peace of crap I’ve seen, it’s actually so bad it’s unusable.   Whenever I access my network shared folder and walk around in it or try to open a big couple gigabyte video file the app freezes for a couple seconds or permanently. What kind of person designed a files app that can’t handle couple gigabyte video files, like what the hell.  Besides that google keyboard gives predictions or corrects mistakes way better than an ios one which doesn’t fix even basic mistakes so often that while writing this sentence it has already failed (I wrote iften instead of often and when I pressed on the word it gave me if-ten and some other nonsense), also google keyboard works well on like every language while ios one is just for a couple most popular ones.
Awful video, just goes to show how much of an Apple fanboy Marques is
0:00 Introduction 0:24 Display 2:09 Performance 3:43 Battery 5:40 Photography 8:29 Videography 8:49 Eco-conscious 10:00 Software Reliability 12:15 Software features 16:38 Software Support 17:53 Pricing
A lot of it is quite biased, because it's coming from two rich people with very specific experiences, instead of a wide variety of people from a wide variety of places, budgets, backgrounds, etc
I feel like these two swapped voices
I put it this way. I have an iPhone 13 and an LG velvet and my sims in the Velvet. I like my iPhone but no matter how many things are just better,it's a very boring phone. Iphone to me,is for people who are really deep in apps, especially social media because the experience and reliability is generally better. Android on the other hand is much more enjoyable for people who literally wanna enjoy the device itself. Features,tinkering with settings,themes etc. I'm the type of person,I play with my screen sharpness,saturation,temp and everything else. I tinker with my phone and iPhone pretty much gives you a grid of apps and you can use them or set your phone down.

Easily title would have been Apple fanboy vs Android fanboy
i see android fanboys are total mess ! can’t accept the fact that IOS is more reliable than android
I love the way you both dressed up with Marques in a black on black while Arun is in a white on white. 👍🏾
Looking through comments and im surprised that nobody talks about this scores like wtf, watching this e felt like every time they agreed that android is better, they called it a draw and then throwing points to iphone for no reasons, this scoring system felt like a joke
Planned Obsolescence Perceived Obsolescence
Iphone make the costumer buy the charger (another box, another use of GAS and money) that is not eco friendly POINT TO ANDROID
The display part is a total rip off like c'mon the Samsung won how is it a draw💀😑
20:07 you didnt fistbump him.
Bah, this time i disagree with Marquez on some points. But probably this thing has been made on purpose to boost comments by android enthusiasts
one of the cool things about apple is that their products are made for longevity and they have an insane life span and software updates. whereas on android, it's almost nonexistent
Been telling my friends with androids iphone was better, but they never wanna listen to me :D
For me it's just: Can I install apps NOT from the appstore? no? so it's no option.
I don't know about all of you guys, but I feel like mkbhd was heavily biased towards the iphone. Keep in mind I have a galaxy s22 and I admit, I'm a little biased.
I am with Android for more being more viable and enough trustworthy...
Apple is the best   Samsung is the GOD
This conversation is kinda interesting to watch ngl, it's nice to see their different perspectives on these topics
the only situation where i would have an apple product is if someone bought it for me, and even then i would just instantly resell it and use the money to buy something actually worth that price.     or idk.. a Better phone for 300+ dollars or less and a new Cpu for my pc...
Tesla brand mobile coming at 2023 🔥🔥🔥
It was funny how i was getting ads of motrola g82 5G over a video of debating which is better iOS or Android
Giving point to iphone for battery and charging even though they don't put a charger in the box... how is this fair, its like an apple fan boy making a comparison.
Interestingly, every close category where Android had an edge was split while every close category where Apple has an edge went to Apple.
I feel like screen and software features should definitely go to Android, photography should be a draw.... So it should be a 5-5 draw
The floating emojis on this channel is the best thing ✌️
Am i pretty🤭
You watch ryan trahan?
Late night convos with the Mandem...
Looks more like a apple 🍎 sponsered video
So for me it goes like any day android cause the fact is that iOS, It's not open and even in android I'll go with Samsung cause obv the UI , So the software for me it's like a restriction and that is something I just don't get along with and people might be like iPhone has better camera  and all , Agreed but for me i'm like there isn't poles apart difference in an S22 ultra pic and an iPhone 13 pro max  My take , always android
nice video! even thought personally i prefer apple, this was still really fun to watch
Personal choice. No clear winner.
Split screen on android has its uses. I don't think it will ever be as comfortable as multi tasking on a computer, but I still use it quite regularly in certain situations.
The thing about apple is.... their ensnaring ecosystem will pull you in so subtly, the next thing you know you're buying $500 wheels from papa Tim
One thing that I think got missed for value is resell value.  You can sell a couple year old iPhone for quite a bit more then a couple year old flagship android because way more people want them.  I think this adds to the value.  The iPhone X and Samsung S8 were both released in 2017 and the iPhone averages on eBay for $250 - $300 whereas the S8 averages about $100.
I really like iphone a lot recently. Bought myself M1 air last year but I won't be buying iphone untill they adopt USB C. Lightning cable alone is huge headache for me
What about the storage..!
What game is this man referring to that ios has that android doesn't? You had to sideload fortnite for how long? What a fucking joke of a biased video
Overall I think that a lot of answers of mrwhosetheboss in different areas were influenced by Marques.
Hey, just wanted to ask about your "challenge", do you feel better already? Anyway, great video.
Happy with my 12 Pro
There should be a whole personality test phone matchup system running for people to decide which phone to go for cause beyond specs, it's about how the phone compliments you as a person, how you perceive your self with the phone in your hand.  Again, it seems the major difference between the two phones is the "we want to get even better" factor, which involves TAKING RISKS. Apple has done that more than all other brands, while Samsung has always played it safe. Look at it this way. If you had to choose between 2 suitors, a Yes-man who's out to  simply make you happy and a more principled man who's not afraid to tell you "no", (since Apple doesn't allow a lot of things that are regarded as "normal" on other Android devices) Who would you choose? That's the phone you need.  🌚Typed this on an Infinix.. hypocrite? Maybe😂😑
Android 3ven if they all have there problems
android since you can get cheaper phones
1000 usd phone without a real file manager and requires the user to spend another 1000$ on another product to make life a bit easier.  Create the problem and sell the solution - No thanks.
How the times have changed - even the Android fanboys have grown tired of the extremely slow process it takes to iron out the bugs. With time, the Apple ecosystem does make more sense, now that every manufacturer is forcing an ecosystem.
Glad I don't watch mark page. I see what he is about.
Excellent video thank you both for your wonderful knowledge that makes choices a bit easier.
No for me Samsung displays beat apple screens.
i appreciate the way Mrwhosetheboss ACCEPTING the other guy's enforced opinions even he when he didn't like the opinion
I use samsung phone and have apple air 4. Both have Usbc cable. I'm so happy.
9:30: it's neither, both are bad at being eco-friendly since they aren't open to easy repairs
I enjoyed this video and respected Marques thoughts about value... he said, depends on YOUR value on features of a phone.
I bought the iPhone 13 pro to replace my Galaxy Note 10  because of the supposedly excellent camera and was so disappointed with the photo quality. The photos look like watercolor paintings. They are so over processed. They are the worst photos I’ve seen on a smartphone.
my bad, i expected marques to be wiser about tech
Yesssss
I don't know about ECO Consciousness... Apple does tend to make claims and then the reality is different. Apple claims "carbon neutral', but what does that mean? Does that include manufacturing? Logistics? For example their iphones uses their proprietary lightning connector and for any other apple device it's usb-c. So instead of one cable - now it's two. And it will be delivered in separate packages probably even in separate trucks. And their wireless charging (which I assume after the EU law will become the only charging) is super wasteful... All wireless charging is wasteful. Not to even start on right to repair. So how far is that statement "carbon neutral" goes?
Really love this entertaining and awesome video!.Awesome Arun and love MBHK on your videos!.Loved to see your views on each category!.Keep up the efforts and hard work!.
What about MOD apk??
Seems partial video. Android has much to offer than IOS. IOS is literally boring which is same from first iPhone
i feel like mkbhd was fanboying over iphone idk
Sorry Siri are you serious  Man ur  Biassed the way you did that competition you pipped it for iPhone to win. yet  in all categories you seem to be negative to android but lean more to iPhone Win I've Seen U on ur own channel  Knock iPhone and praise android U  Wanted to make a good impression on Marcus Brown I Do love you Man Cos Most of the Time ur  Very fair
I feel like it is kinda unfair comparing  one phone company to the average of like 1000
Lock screen widgets are better in Android anyday
How much apple pay bout of u what crapt
At the end i phone is an I phone
Marcus daily drives S21 ultra but thinks iphone is better? That seems to be an interesting take.
Guys here me out, I was an android user for more than 10 years and recently I switched to IOS and I have to admit, the Iphone is better so if you never used one you should try it.
probably the worst video you ever made. iPhones are good but this is sooo biased. also comparing the average phone that runs an OS to an iPhone is unfair, iPhone is a phone android is an OS. compare individual manufacturers or compare iOS to android
Operating system vs phone
I think they were more iPhone biased
that awkward fist bump anticipation in the end 😅
They’re trying their best to defend the android but ios simply is the winner
Emulation without jailbreaking does it for me.
@arun like this comment to tell me you're actually reading these comments
Nice :)
androidickriders crying in the comments section
After ALL this bullshit, apple may be YOUR mobile of choice but there  is no way in hell I would purchase ANY of their phones and be constantly bothered  with password requests.
Apple 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
fuck that, samsung gang forever
Great video, as always!
I like the general idea here, but Android does get short changed a little here. This is because it is being graded on a curve, where the iPhone represents itself. Whenever you assess something from the Android perspective in this comparison, you always have to be like "Samsung does this well, but [other phone] not so much". This is not conducive to a fair comparison.  That being said, I know what you are trying to do here, and in broad generalities you make good points.
I understood that i live in a totally different world. For me root accessing the memory is super important. And usb-c is hugely important and... OTG capability. So no iphone for me. Iphones are a waste of money.
Strange that photography goes to iPhone, even though many Android phones beat it in most features
You guys are sold out by Apple.
There's something called weighting...
It's not a controversy,so that;s  a LIE. It's my money so what I buy is the best for me..We're done here. Anything else is stoopid people debating about stoopid ,overpriced toys...
THIS GUY IS AN ABSOLUTE LEGEND
When my iPhone 6s finally dies, I'm going to get whatever the current iPhone is. Five years of updates and Apple seems to care about how the updates run on the older models. Plus Apple's customer support is unmatched and there are a million and one places I can bring my phone for something small, like a screen replacement.
I'm observing a bias here, get a pro android user to go up against these iPhone fanatics
Straight and is If you are rich then you will 110% use apple and if you are poor you gonna use Android ..... Middle class tries to buy iPhone maybe non pro version😂😂😂
Look man. You keep cleaning your s22ultra so you care for the Android more. Bro lemme tell you, these points are *ss. So ultimately Android wins 😂😂😂
And Sound😠😠 Is Also Very Weak In S22 ULTRA I'm Regretting To Upgrade
I like this late night and calm ambiance
Just saw your donation to Ryan Trahan dude. You're amazing !
two legends
I love both. However all around polished is Apple. Longevity. Apple. Premium feeling apps that match the hardware. Apple. Less stutters and glitches per day. Apple. All around camera. Apple. Android speaks to the child in me for customizability.
iPhone vs every Android built
Samsung learn some good things from Apple and reduce your product prices.
This shows how different YouTuber in the same category have different thought
Nobody gives a shit about facetime and iMessage outside of US.....
I was a big fan of you but I am really disappointed that you trying to force your opinion to other people since you traveled to iPhone. Even in this video you actually missed lots of lot of good android features. You're trying to look android phones cheap and low specs. wrong wrong wrong. iphone is selling because of People who make it look huge. People are not stupid you better to change.
S22 ultra takes better picture, has far better display. Period
Android, hands down.
Arun is not looking happy
Please remember you are not the god’s. You both have done cheaper review than that. Ok… wait… what do you mean even???? Android & IOS??? Right??? If right, android is much cheaper and IOS is expensive. That’s enough. No matter what, money can buy. But you people are sucks.
The best techi Duo on 2022 and beyond 🤓
I use both iphone and Android but i think android is better
WoW
If you watch Marques at all, it's painfully apparent he's an Apple fanboy.
it's very much like Marcus said for everyday work and seamless experience ios has an edge. But for people who like to customize stuff, install custom rom or just want to explore new things android is no brainer.
I feel like you omitted the fact that you can sideload apps on android, personally I cannot survive without sideloading on android as most of the apps I use are not on the play store. So for the software category I would've given android a win but I guess a lot of the points in the video are subjective anyways. I love the content though, keep making awesome videos!
The African- American guy is a fan of iphone but using samsung since 1.5 years … LOL
The screen is definitely not a draw
*Laughs in Linux*
?
You should also include the company's end user support as well as part of the service. Apple support can remote to your iOS devices or macs (obviously with end user approval prior the remote session) to guide you through step by step. Not too sure if any one of Android phone companies do that. plus better queue for support experience, either phone support or Apple Store support appointment system.
I just recently upgraded my old iPad 4 to a new Samsung Galaxy S7 Tab FE. All my Samsung products work together beautifully! I was surprised because Apple is supposed to be the best at making all their devices work together but Samsung is pretty close. It even works with my Windows computer
We need more long form conversations like this great work boys. ⚡️⚡️
Android: Foldable  Iphone:🤷🤷🏻🤷🏽🤷🏾🤷🏿
Based
ANDRIOD IS BETTER!!!!!
Apple has gotten alot more competitive over the past year 😅
Yeah, iOS/iPhone is better than Android. But for me, Android is the right choice. Because my work is basically in android land so.. the thing is how to see and use the phones, then you pick it as the best one.
"I kinda prefer the flat"                         -   MKBHD
POV of Iphone ball suckers
I love Mrwhosetheboss, but this was a totally antiquated rating system. Oftentimes, you compared the entirety of android to this single company. With so many phones floating out there it's a completely unfair comparison in the first place. For example, eco friendly. You brought up 2 phone companies which use android that do better, but gave the win to the one company. A more fair comparison would be top current android vs top current iPhone. Your comparing a phone company to essentially an OS used all around the world. Another example would be on gaming performance aand battery life. Gaming phones with higher performance were brought up, and phones with higher battery capacity that lasted longer than iPhones were as well, and yet iPhone won in both categories. The problem is that it's not a level playing field until you compare individual companies. It seemed mostly like mkbhd made most of the calls too, I like him too but his heavy apple bias made Mrwhosetheboss look like a pushover.  Completely disagree.
I really wanted u to talk more arun i feel like im being ur mom but dont just count what mark says u should have an opinion or 2
That satisfying handshake tho.
This is the collab we never knew we needed and never thought of but was totally worth the 20 minutes
Bruh androids nearby share!?
I used the latest of both os and even watched different comparisons of them in case I missed anything. Both are really similar and good in all aspects, although in some aspects, the other does better. If you have other apple products like a mac or want a smoother experience, get iphone. In terms of the utility and accessibility of the ui, features, customization, hardware, and depending on the model, affordability and value, get android
It's their enthusiastic energy and genuine opinions about our beloved smartphones world for me...loved it❤️
iPhone is not for average people because of its price.
Guys plz be aware of scamer🥺 Thier is a guy that’s saying his arun and do some bullshit  Be aware  I just faced it🥲
Buuuttt...there is no youtube vanced on ios and I am not gonna pay for YouTube premium
This isn't really fair. There are a lot of trash android phones, while all iPhones are flagships. If it's a concrete comparison like appe vs samsung s series the score would be pretty much the same.
IT should be named "Android vs IOS". Android is Software and an IPhone is Hardware and this can't be compared with which each other.
Lighting looks so bad why bro why ? Anyone feels that or its just me...
Also android devices have way bigger screen to body ratios than iphones. Which is why display should go to android
Personally me: I P H O N E   L O S E
With now iOS finally having better customization, 6+ years support,bedt social media upload quality, great battery life i personally think it's a good time to be iPhone user as an android user myself.
samsung has Quik share
Two legends comparability   is genius.
Android wins because of apks 😂
Then buy me an iphone 😭😭❤️💔
uk u are great when one phone competes with various phones  lol
best best best
It would be much much better if you guys put ONE android phone against ONE similarly-priced iPhone
imo value and freedom (as in options and customization) weighs in way more than any averaged out generalized category the iphone wins in
sideloading is too good for me to ditch android
Well in my point of view its all about preference indeed ,,as to me i am a samsung user since i was  a teenager .. and when i used an iphone it didnt wow me to move to ios ... am just a simple guy just need good camera ,,good software , good design of the phone(stylish) and a powerfull cheap which samsung flagships always give me that
All I get from this is mark is just an iphone fan, lol 🤣.
Android deserved a full point on photos cl
There is no way Apple and Android should have split on screen.  Android is the clear winner.
bc i prefer customization android is the pick for me but iphone is better when it comes to overall performance
I expected the iPhone to win, but this was so badly biased towards the iPhone it's almost funny. You even looked visibly disappointed when the iPhone didn't win a category outright.
Biased Review as you guys yourself are using Android
At the end of the day , Android is about flexibility while iPhone is about stability.Its left to the customers what they prefer.
There is this weird thing where although android is much more open and seemingly easier to mod the jailbreak tweaking libraries stomp those of android.
This is very detailed. Expat in both operating systems. I wish in future, there will be an expansion (visual explanation) of the difference. Seen is believing and more understandable. 👍🏿👍🏿
Kind off a unfair representation iPhone is one company and ur comparing it to many other different companies that have android. Should’ve just been iPhone vs Samsung or iPhone vs Google phone etc
If u give me to choose a iPhone 13pro max or samsung s22 ultra .  Whithout thinking I would definitely choose samsung s 22 ultra .....    ..it's just my opinion (Like if you also think like me)
One major point which contributed negatively to Android is that there are so many cheap andriod phones which lack in every point and when you compare Andriod with IOS then in back of your head you have an poor image of Android due to this. Where as there are no cheap phones in Apple, its all one hardware and IOS.
@mrwhosetheboss why is it that you mostly avoid anything that would hurt iphone or apple? I commented on your Vivo X80 pro to compare the cam with iPhone 13 pro, you didn't do it cos you know the iPhone don't stand a chance. Same thing last year, you didn't compare the Vivo X80 pro+ with the iPhone 12 pro.
For me it's apples unique benefits depends on your social group also being apple. As being the only andriod user in a group most of the benefits are lost when conversing with myself
Android if you want customizability, IOS if you like the simplicity and the ease of use. Honestly other than the OS specs are so close it almost doesn't matter.
Did you even see how much packaging comes with the iPhone buying a charger, ear pods and all of that sort of things?
Is this video sponsored by iPhone or what
Two coolest tech guys together 💜
Ha you can't compare their displays android is better i just moved to android and am loving it
dual physical sim support in Samsung😭? And what about S- pen 😢?
you guys are just completely biased on iPhone. There are so many things on Android phone that an iPhone will never have (at least for now), usb c type charging for starters & there are many more
About genshin what you uid
Giving iPhone eco price is the BIGGEST joke ever. You guys are a joke aswell if you believe that shite!! Get your asses behind right to repair!!! IPhone and Tesla are devastatingly terrible company's! FYI,  elon has his own cobalt mine. Minimum worker age ~8
the dent in your hand is helping you not drop it. that is why the last iphone designs were moronic. you'd get an F in a design class on those.
WOW, Nice Video. Great Work...
I can't believe the display was a draw 🤣🤣🤣🤣
apple fan boy
the fact that all Android Phone Companies is competing to each other. But IOS is facing all of them
Google is already carbon neutral, so I think pixels are too.
If iPhone literally kills every process in background, it's obvious that battery will last longer. On iOS when you're updating an app you can't use that app untill it doesn't finish the installation, complitely the opposite on Android; for me that's a pretty annoying things on iOS
Totally biased video by this blacky, did Tim Cook pay for this
Choosing Apple's display over Samsung should be treated as treason. @MKBHD is becoming an Apple fanboy.
Watching from my 13 pro max Have been android user for 7 yrs. Very much happy switched this month. Loved it.
Believe me this is gonna hurt the ego of some android phone companies
Juicers will mald after watching this video. Mr X take on this would be nice 🙂
I disagree with a lot of this. The cameras for instance. Yes iphone takes slightly better video. But the pictures I get with my S22 Ultra are better than what iPhone 13 pro max was doing. My sister even changed phones because of this. The functionality that android puts out is amazing. I don't like that customization in iPhone is so difficult. Like organizing photos is a nightmare. Also the S-pen is a huge game changer for me. The things I can do with the S-pen is so amazing. It even helped me with making a passport photo for my son that has autism and won't sit still for photos. Editing is easier, getting to apps is easier with the edge panel, screen writing is great, the ultrasonic finger print reader is amazing, and just so much easier with more versatility. That's just my opinion.
AFTER LOOKING AT THE POINTS.....THESE COMPARISON DOESN'T SEEMS FAIR FOR ME.......
I Just got and S10 in plain 2022 and I'm happy crazy with it (most of all I love the small size and curved screen), so I'm guessing go for what make you happy!!
It's funny how so many pros of the iphone are just basic features in a locked ecosystem.
Biased video
Lock Screen widgets on iPhones is just like what Microsoft was doing with customizable lock screens on windows phone
Am unfollowing this people are fake.. they want to promote Apple here
What a stupid idea for a video.
If I don’t have much money and I would like a cheap Iphone is a XR good still? Or should I just get a regular X?
you cant even battery replace on a iphone.
I think the Apple vs Android debate needs much more depth than a video can provide. This would be a great debate for a podcast such as Waveform.
Hi
One of the best tech videos in a long long time…
The collab I’ve always wanted
so if you really think that i holy iphone has no comparison to android why did you even make this video??looks like this video was i phone ad...but 20 minutes ad...there is lot of stuff you did not consider mentioning...
camera expirience android..!!!!!!DID YOU BOTH FORGOT FEATURES THAT ANDROID PROVIDES WITH ITS CAMERA!!!!AND S22 ULTRA IS BETTER THAN THE IPHONE
Android is better.....anyday 🔥🔥🔥
Dislike from my side bcz u gave a draw between display . Shitty display of apple 😂
It’s like comparing Donald Trump with inhabitants of United States 🇺🇸
using Xiaomi poco X2 250 dollar midrange phone 2 half year happy with it , 3 & 4 years earlier buying smartphone every year wasting money for same side display for watching videos & browsing daily
I can hear my s22 ultra vibrating in living room when my phone is on bedroom table..
Yo that eco-friendly section was REALLY bad. You didn't mention the part where extra trash is created by phones not coming with chargers, etc., and requiring you to buy more products just to get use of new features in a new phone, etc.
Is it a coincidence that the phone at 1:07 is at 69% battery?
It looked like MKBHD wanted to go in for a fist bump after the handshake :(
look at mkbhd face when arun said vivo x80 pro he be like bro i just use iphone i don't wan tot hear anything i just want iphone
I cannot choose between the two. So I use both of them. The iPhone for AirDrop, Apple Watch and AirTag as well as backup for my main phone, which is the Android, because I like fiddling around in the settings and camera options, which is just more fun to me and always a conversation starter.
Good video but you shouldnt using  benchmarking apps for showing performance of phones
what about the durability!?🤔
So basically from this video we learn: Apple features = Stuff Android has too just named differently  iMessage - Google messages with RCS or any other messages app.  Airdrop - Nearby Share  FaceTime - Video calls from any app  Shareplay - no one even uses it (Source - every online poll) But if there was an universal equivalent it would be Discord or Just any piracy app which broadcasts stuff.  Then there's BASIC stuff iPhones can't do:  Moving the goddamn icons to the bottom of the screen.  GOING BACK ONE PAGE USING A UNIVERSAL BUTTON OR SWIPE  Fast Face unlock that doesn't keep you on the screen and takes you to homepage, or at least a damn fingerprint scanner.  USB Type C.  USB TYPE C  *USB TYPE C* (Not a software feature but still a goddamn pain in the ass)  Tldr; Someone tell me a feature that apple actually has but Android doesn't have an equivalent/better alternative to.
Good video quality❤️🤝
I'm an Android guy all day everyday. But ain't no smartphone can take better pictures than the iPhone. One of my coat workers took a picture of a halo at night with his iPhone and at that time I had the Galaxy S10+ And he had the latest iPhone at the time. And his took a better picture overall. You could actually see the ring around the halo with his iPhone unlike the Samsung Galaxy It didn't even have a ring.
I still don’t get why mkbhd uses the s21 ultra
Mine is basically airdrop and simplicity with Apple
so biased
Marques is biased for iPhone...I own both iPhone n Samsung..but I rarely use iPhone as my primary phone...I guess whoever uses an iPhone always carry another Android phone...
ഞാൻ ഇത് എന്തിനാ കാണുന്നെ? ഞാൻ ആപ്പിൾ വാങ്ങാൻ പൊന്നൊന്നുമില്ലലോ
strange. STILL WONT BE GETTING AN IPHONE :)
Found many points which were debatable. And also it seemed that you were bias (based on your experience) as you used ios much more daily. But again, that is your personal opinion, would love to have a review after using android and then iphone for like a month each.
All these Good PR for Apple inside Apple HQ isn't going to make me switch to apple 😂
This video is not sponsored by Apple 😂
Me reading all the fighting between apple fanboys and android fanboys with my windows phon-jk
This comparison is fake.. Apple battery drains..BH is shit.. Samsung charges more faster and also last longer base on customization
I think Apple company paid you both.
Justice for Sushant Singh Rajput and Disha salian
Interesting opinions. 🤔
Great evaluations. Totally agree with the portion that MKBHD said about iOS having a few features that are massive pillars that are important to a large group and Android has lots of options for niche groups.
The British accent sounds loud today! 😬😬
Android got murked
I have a whole samsung ecosystem. And work has given me apple ecosystem too. But i really choose samsung over apple in a heartbeat. Just the control i have over my devices makes all the difference for me
pfft why not own both OS, both are beautiful in their own ways
The thing is that you can't just do apple android comparison because android has too many phones and most of them just target one thing not many we should do just like apple and samsung or apple and Xiaomi
Biggest issue here is its iPhone vs android. Well android is 100% software. There is no such thing as an "android phone". They range from being the most powerful phone out there, just look at some of the gaming phones, right down to it makes phone calls and you can access Facebook on it. If you're going to make a comparison then take one phone with android and compare it like for like. Or you only look at the software features, which phone has the biggest notch or best screen isn't a question here because what screen does an android phone have? The answer who made it and how much did you pay for it.
Marques, tell me you like iPhone without... 😜
I have been using iphone for the last 2 years. In my opinion android is much better. What people fail to understand is that android let's you do so much more to the point it feels like android is like a small pc whereas ios feels like a calculator in comparison. Iphone lends a lot to the "status" because of it's brand value but android makes you much better at using technology whereas ios restricts you to just consumer. My humble opinion.
trying so hard 😂
Most of the time people only compared midrange android phone to flagship iphone it's 2022 all phone works better in terms of preference
The conclusion is the important part of this video, the iphone is a great device but the worst for your wallet, apple's focus is still take as much of your money as they can, that's why most of iOS 16 focus was to improve the ecosystem features, to lock you in even more... My take is that for everyone outside the US the iPhone is bad value, half of the benefits depend on having apple devices around you and that's not common in many parts of the world.
Android is better because Android has Fortnite and iOS doesn't.
Two apple fanboys come together, I sure do wonder what the result will be 🤔
its ovius that you are iphone fanboys, why bother do this video? iphon is for old ppl, and andorid is geeeks  , and also ipgone is 5 y after andrid in lot of things,
My favorite tech guys in one video, Awesome
Notchhhhh
15:36 !!! THIS MEETING WAS BIASED lol.
👏👏👏awesome guys ‼️
Man, i respect MKBHD a lot, but his views in this video are pretty absurd. Like the split-screen in Samsung man that feature is pretty awesome, when it comes to the camera yeah it might take slightly longer to get a shot on the odd occasion, but rarely am I in a rush to take a photo…so for me I’ll go with android all day long because I’ll often get the better result, more flexibility of lenses, etc and way more fun to shoot with. For me, the better result far outweighs the small things MKBHD mentioned as drawbacks with the s22U. and the thing about iPhones being not too buggy, omg I have dozens of family and friends who have phones and to 12s and 13s, and they are buggy af, but what's even funny is none of them own an android flagship. everyone that has an android phone is mostly budget or mid-range. everyone has this thing where they assume phones are just way way better and it sucks man.  id take an s22U any time of the day.  Watching this video I saw another side of MKBHD that we'd have never known if he hadn't done this video. Because watching him alone we won't catch this stuff. So, yes he is very good with tech, but seeing this video I felt like he cares more about being more privileged, those small things, and being pretentious in some sense. like when he talked about the vibration motor in Samsung, personally I own a budget Samsung phone and I haven't missed any calls on it other than if I have it on dnd or I don't have my phone with me. And saying the lock screen customization in iPhone is better, damn man!!! but yeah it's his personal choice and it's my personal view about him, so yk that's what she said.
I use split screen feature a lot as well on my S21 Ultra.  And I found out that I actually really enjoy using the pen from my Remarkable tablet (which turns out to work just like an S-pen).  It's really useful for drawing instructions on screenshots and for fine-tuning video editing on the phone.  And the USB-C is what I feel all phones should switch to.  But most of all I'm used to my Android phone - I loved LG while they existed and bought only their phones before. Switched to Samsung now and I'm also very happy.  No reason for me to go over to iOS for the time being.   And I grew up and don't care if the other person is an iOS user. We can transfer files now between phones, after all :))
When it comes to gaming..all mobile gamers know iPhone is the clear winner. No matter what gaming phone ur putting it against.
better title will be iphone 13 pro max VS samsung S22 ultra
if we are drawing on display tech I already don't want to finish this video 😂
The best phone is which you can afford.
Mkbhd was not a truly fan of Android so this isn't a fair for Android user there's many points that a Android can do better than ios but in this video its not even try to show that Android is better
Apple sponsored MKBHD ??
I think that pretty much sums it up right? Give the people customizability, and companies accessibility (android): risk security, stability, and more bloatware (each brand wants to add their own unique features, there is only one brand for ios). More companies being allowed a share in the Android phone market breeds inefficiencies in terms of software.  imo the camera is where mwtb should've taken a stand for Android  And then there's software support. I really don't get why google can't stretch it to 5 years, they can mandate that, and the other companies are gonna be forced to adapt to it or be forced away from android os
Great video, I enjoyed it! Comparing these two device categories is a difficult task, and in the end it does indeed just come down to preference. For me, I am a computer scientist and I prefer total control over my device. However, that control can come with the price of complexity and, if you don't know what you're doing, unreliability.  The reality is that most people want something that is easy to use out of the box, and Apple has really pinpointed this as one of their main goals. But if you really want control of your device (without jailbreaking), Android will always beat Apple in that regard. The way I see it, Apple is very single-purpose oriented (do it our way, it works), while Android tends to be general-purpose oriented (do it your way, if it works is up to you).
With all respect, this was a shitty comparison
People don't discuss audio much. The control and options one can have on audio quality on an Android is unmatched. I prefer listening to music on my Android with the sound signature tuned to precisely the way I want using the Wavelets app.
I am sorry, but when anyone tries to compare apple and Android phones, I just scoff so hard. I used to own Android and then I switched to apple, and the difference is unfathomable, apple is in its own different class.
I'll go with an android because I can't afford an iphone😂😂😂
06:45 sweat drop?
Two Apple fanboys talking about iphone vs android.
The entire premise for this video is flawed imo. It should be android versus IOS not android versus iPhone. If you go with android versus IOS then you could come up with an entirely different set of features that will tilt this entirely in the favor of android.  If you go with Android versus IOS then the simple difference is support for multiple devices, wearables and form factors,  stylus support, external monitor support, works with external docks like nexdock, wide range of camera hardware support to suite individual shooting styles and use cases and accessories support. Also android support more hires audio codes. Still offers support for devices with dual SIM and SD card expansion slots.
This feels like the same hotel room from ages ago when Lewis did the what phone is your pocket video with all the tech you tubers
Android enthusiasts, use this as an "outrage button"😂
If you don’t have money for iPhone, buy Android
Android - 2.5 Apple - 7.5  Middle class me -5 for apple cause of price  That's a draw
Why does Marques looks like he has been bullied to do this lmao
I disgaree with the environmental point because it is better to repair a phone and keep it in use for longer than to just recycle it as parts will always end up as e waste also iphone has a their own separate cable while android all uses one cable.
I use both
Iphone can have a 10 point lead, but for me, without sideloading apps, it is just not worth it.
This should have been iPhone vs Samsung. Flagships from each of the two, not comparing hundreds of Android variants to a single iPhone
I think in software android wins here couse ios need to updated for some apps to work🤔
for me performance is like........fast app loading smooth screen and app opening time.....in which samsung nailed it
Arun often seemed to disagree (photos e.g.) and still gave the point to the phone that MKBHD liked more
Iphone for battery life lol What a joke
Depends on the user really, i dont like ios at all, because im a power user and like options in customizations and stuff so android is for me, id prefer something like maemo or meego over android but then again i dont think thatll get popular enough that prople would be able to but it at same prices as android also id still need to keep a android phone around because of all the apps available on it.
This debate felt like if Android is doing good find good in Apple and call it Draw, but if Apple is doing good then Call it a winner straightaway. Also Apple is not very repairable that talks about ecofriendly. Also so many of android features were overlooked. So it was a apple biased discussion imho.
Display: Samsung  Performance: Apple Battery: Apple Photography: Samsung (even on social media) Video: Apple Eco Conscious: Android (lightning cable & proprietary connectors & anti repair heavy) Software Reliability: Apple Software Features: Android (they have replacements for every feature apple has & a ton more) Software Support: Apple Pricing: Android  Apple = 5 ; Android = 5
any iPhone is good to museum, not to use. every specs are from 2005-2010. a bad joke, not a phone.
I phone is better
This video is sponsored by APPLE
I can answer you this question even before I will watch your episode: This one is better that you like more. And this truth is good only for yourself. Everyone has their own ;) and episode I will watch but later ;)
I don’t want to be the smart boy, but the title is kinda wrong, if you are comparing phones it should be Samsung vs iPhone, if it is software it should be Android vs iOS
you missed a point for google assistant , and i think the fact there are so many options for android is a plus.
18:48 Did I hear "PIXEL 6A" ?? MKBHD must be using/testing 6A rn.
Battery life to iPhone is a joke, 120w charging Xiaomi is just amazing, battery lasts all day, charges in 20 min from 0-100, it's just on another level, and generally speaking most android phones charges faster and last just as long if not longer.
Showing some love from Kenya 🇰🇪💪🏽
Why do you let MKBHD push you around.  You had an opinion and let him change it and get his way.
Please do windows vs mac os
so u r saying i should sell my kidneys to buy a iphone.....😱😭😭😭😭
Having an iPhone in a 3rd world country isn't as fun as it seems everywhere else. You're way more likely to run into another flagship Android user than an iPhone because of the high cost factor. So all the features like FaceTime, iMessage, etc. is pretty useless if you're not stacked in Apple devices or have a whole family using them. So I'd say depending on the location in the world, this could go either way. Apple dominating the US, but most everywhere else it's Android.
Great video. iPhone is still king in my eyes and iOS 16 is looking sharp.
the vid is 20;22 min long like the year
The goldy collab
Both are my fav. I mean to say @MKBHD & @BOSS ❤️🙂
That didn't feel as objective. I found myself disagreeing a lot. It would have been much better if both Marques and Arun gave it 0.5 points each
Two Apple iPhone users discussing which is better, Android or iPhone? iPhone crushes it in this discussion. ... Yeah,... who didn't see that coming? 😏
Awesome 🤩👌
Which one of those phones will still receive software updates 6 years from now? Isn’t that an eco friendly? I’m pretty sure I’ll be using my brand new iPhone six years from now.
Privacy and security were conspicuously missing.
I am still going with Android.
i love these collabs video
fuck is IPHONE ...I love Samsung S22 ult
Not gonna lie this is kinda rigged considering that they gave their opinion and not what the people actually need
Keep malding android nerds
I love both, but people bang on about customisation, and iPhones lack of it. Most users don’t give a monkeys about customisation. They just want a phone that fits their needs, takes a good photo, go on tick-tock, YouTube , instagram etc …..
Really enjoyed this collab!
Night photos with latest iphone using the Camera app is absolutely terrible.
How much money did Apple pay you for this garbage?
I have s22 and I will buy another one because its price and real value ratio is equal.
The MKHB Apple bias is real!
android ❤
basically buy midrange smartphone be happy 2-3 year instead wasting money 💸
Just stop this argument! It just depends on your budget, preferences and etc.
Let's destroy this debate I like options in android more than ios plus I have storage option where I can maximize  the memory
Me : i prefer android (Because can't buy i phone {kidney phone})
This is bullshit which come from apple fans since forever.
This is fucked android is being soo underrated
I feel like iPhone is better for more people, the masses, cause it’s easy, fast and simple. While android is better for a more technical minority, people who care about the nitty gritty.
No-no-no. A faster soc is better than 120 hz screen to a mobile gamer, if you could only run the game below 60, 50, 40 fps what's the point of having 120 hz. And the SE at least the 2020 version really deliver on that value. Although I can't argue about the small battery life, but to me I'd rather sacrifice everything for the smooth and consistent FPS. Plus, it helps you to not make your phone the be all and all if the battery is small, it force you to rest and maybe make you do other stuff while you're waiting for it to charge.
You guys gave totally biased opinions towards iPhone. Android phones do much better things that iPhones still can’t also the features that android offers iPhone takes years and years to figure out how they can implement them in iPhone.  When iPhone charges such a huge buck of money they just give you nothing. I am a iPhone user but literally after seeing my friends using Samsung phones I just think I wasted my money on iPhone
biased as expected
Arun : "im suffering my health. going to take care from now onwards"  Later Arun, editing videos at midnight instead of taking proper rest 🤣🤣🤣  Same story for everyone
This is such a one sided video😂😉 I am a award winning photographer and I can tell you that the camera in iPhone just sucks😂 Can't believe he said iPhone camera is better than Android! Seemed like a very biased video.... But all in all nice to see ur POV.,
lol android bash
Let's be honest, MKBHD will always be biased towards the iPhone 😅
This is the difference between US and UK English. might you like it
@MKBHD: "options" just killed it
Amazing collaboration. Love it
This type of comparison fails because it tries to compare one company to an entire ecosystem of devices on an OS. The advantage of getting a device of Android OS is that each device has a completely different approach it's going  for and you get to decide what you want.
The 2 reason I dont use a Iphone is the price and the less customisation
This has to be a secret promotional video for Apple Phones but In real Life Samsung is eons and Eons better than Apple for every day life. They are trying to fool you
Looks like a Paid Promotion by Apple. Don't you think iphone lack exclusivity, which Android has? What about designs ? Lackluster old designs. Now iphone 12 , 13 are becoming so common they are not exclusive at all. Not an a apple hater, Macbooks are awesome with M Chips. But iphones are overrated.  I think YOU & MKBHD both know that 🤷🏻‍♂️
Android gives us more freedom to play with. It's way cheaper then the 13 pro max. Easy to connect with windows.  In my mind I personally think that android is more convinient than Iphone  I can buy a samsung galaxy S22 Ultra RAM:12GB ROM:512GB at 1,19,000₹ Just save around 50,000₹😊
They actually didn't talk about repairs and spares, Apple will lose that.
Yea try to get good ios
I disagree with the environment impact point. While they're made from recycled materials, the average iPhone user drops their phone way more often and ends up having to replace it on a yearly basis.
If u speak about eco friendly.. u should speak about repares... becose apple is trying hard to make repares imposible
Not even a fair comparative. You're comparing a phone with an specific os designed and optimized for some very specific components with an operating system designed for thousands of different phones with different components and performances.
You guys forgot to mention that apple is a very locked in experience compared to android. Moding your divice and repairs are almost exclusively an android thing where as apple had to be taken to court over something as simple as after sale service.
I'm actually dropping this comment before watching, cos I already know you will give the win to iPhone, just because you use iPhone and apple ecosystem makes Ur work easier. To me, I feel when it comes to phone, just the usage of phone, I prefer android, iPhone takes the edge when it's been used with other apple gadgets.
Hope you are doing better and feeling better? 💛
nice collab and comparison!
Funny that iMessage, Facetime, Airplay, etc. are seen as massive features in the US. Those are not really important in Asia or Europe.
"Soo Android is better at: This, this, this, and this."  "Apple is better at: That."  Score: draw.
I do think iPhone as a whole is better, easier, cleaner but also not that anyones complaining but this video is basically iPhone vs every other phone in the world
Oh come on, a tie on display? Really? This is so easily android the notch is so primitive.
Sweet video. I always love to see the collabs.
Definitely android more phone options and have the best camera like on the honor magic 4 ultimate
Two favourite tech YouTuber in one frame
The iphones notch makes Android displays better to look at imo
Two Apple PR guys making a video. You already know what to expect lol
This video should have been called '' iPhone vs Android which is best for our personal use. ''  Alot of favoritism and bias.  I would not change my S20+ for anything in the iPhone line up
Christ if you're going to do a paid Apple  advertisement why don't you just say that? You guys literally in each category described how trash the iPhone was and then said it won based on some nonsense technicality. Guessing the check from Apple was just too much to refuse. I hate when reviewers I trust openly sell out and can't be trusted.
I think a fairer comparison would be Samsung vs Apple, rather than OS vs OS. Android is too broad of a comparison for this to make sense
Just get a pc
13:00 huawei has huawei share and huawei meetime
I feel like some topics, MKBHD was biased
Was the first point a draw becouse he likes edges even though it leaves dents in the hands? becouse eveyrthing else said was better on the s22
Android hands down. No question. Not even close.
I have a different opinion in nearly every point 😂
Lmao i disagree with almost everything but okay, samsung camera is better, samsung has more power in their hardware Just look at a benchmark bro, Iphone isn't even in top 10. Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra is like 100k points above.  And there is a lot more of points that u guys decided to give it to the iphone for no reason
Disagree
As a serial switcher, it’s true that iOS is the best all rounder. I bought the Pixel 6 Pro on the day of release (no easy task!) but I felt let down. It was buggy, it dropped frames all the time and serves way more ads than iOS. I reluctantly bought the 13 Pro Max and was blown away by the battery life. I prefer android theoretically, but prefer iOS in actuality. Let’s hope another OS (or five) gain enough traction to further improve things all round.
Whats with apks?
IPHONE IS THE WORST
Love to see you both together 😍
Giving a draw on the screens was absolutely criminal. If you've ever held an iPhone 13 and a Samsung ultra you'd feel like that was a horrible take
ANDROID IS BETTER THAN IPHONE
12:54 samsungs Quick Share does the exact same thing
I love how they’re talking like friends from years ago These two goats have shaped the modern tech industry I feel  Props to you both and your casual sense of dressing  It’s so refreshing
You are comparing a single phone with whole Android industry...... Idk if "which is better" Is even a ques...... (Don't talk abt the price......samsung S22 ultra is not so cheap.)
Love that duo ! 🤩
Lol! this show is made for Iphone.
Great video 🤗😁. But android is ohk since there are couple of android phones in my country I think you’ve no idea of
the video we've all been waiting for <3
i recently moved from samsung to iphone and after a while i can say that this phone is for old people who can't just multitask and keyboard prediction is awful , as a not english native speaker i have troubles in my language with prediction on this keyboard
This is not fair
Hmmm... lets see now. Do I want an overexpensive phone that hasnt changed its design in the last 10 years, restricts the user to its crappy eco-system, uses different cables from every other piece of technology, the screen looks dated due to thick black edges, and on top of that you cant repair yourself...  Or do I want a phone which is unique looking, super customizable, cheaper, can be repaired more easily, has a modern looking screen, complete freedom in terms of apps and widgets, and is compatible with every other piece of technology out there (other than Apple products)...  Well, that is an easy answer. To me iPhone is not even close to Android phones. I wouldnt use one even if I got it for free. And I am not just saying this. I work in a company that bought me an iPhone as part of my job. I just cant use it after using Android for 10 years. It feels completely unusable. Even simple thongs like copying stuff to my PC or sending an e-mail are super complicated. And I have been using computers my whole life.
I love deep dive conversations like this. ⚡️⚡️
In my opinion everytime you two make a video together is a must watch, it's just so interesting how to leyends give there opinions on tech. Saludos amigos!!
+Since when an game will be relased first on an Iphone, may i ask? Because beta + the Appstore fee is just BS +Who the hell would seperate the imaging and videography? +How much money does Apple paid both of you to said they are the more environmental friendly? Because last time i check,they were still trying to stop the Right For Repair, and did anyone see their speech about sideloading apps? +And how much money it takes
Very nice you both looking nice should meet and make videos occasionally prays❤️
iPhone is most stable phone you can own right now Currently I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max  I may change my opinion in couple of years when Samsung releases something comparable
okay just with Samsung Galaxy S10 the whole topic got boring as I could see that my fav two tech YouTubers actually forgot to say that it's all about which is better for you
At 1:47 there is a dent in the "dent" that is so cool HAHA
😥 samsung...
LOL! MKBHD is comparing S21 and not S22 vs iPhone 13. there are a couple of things that he forgot to mention especially in photography, charging, support, repair, widgets, software.  His review is so bias in a whole lot level. I've been using iPhone 12 Pro for a year now and God the usability of this phone is so minimal compared to a middle tier android phone.  This is actually one of the reasons why I stopped watching his videos.  This is from an iPhone -> Android -> iPhone -> Android -> iPhone (current) user here. I'm also an I.T. and scrutinizing usability of the phone is also my thing and I can tell you right not god when S22 came out I really wanted to smash my iPhone 12 Pro for being a stupid phone and yes I also compared those to Samsung S21 Ultra in various aspects especially photography and never did the iPhone win in any category specially in clarity, sharpness, stability when taking photos or videos.  well if you really wanna see what I've been talking about just buy two phones just like me. (iPhone 12 Pro and Samsung S22 Ultra)
This is mostly compared with s22 ultra and iPhone 13 pro Max Other android phones: these guys completely forget about  us
Ok
I hated the iPhone but I realized the iPhone is the best for me and I'm broke
I love android for what you CAN do with it, but iOS works so well across devices it's really hard for me to give it up. The basic pillars the guys talked about in the video really sell it, plus you don't have tons of custom firmware or whatever on ios so all of the apps generally come out pretty strong on everything. Hoping eventually they give in and do a foldable.
Whatever, i love android and I prefer android over iphone. Average always wins🏆 😉
Facetime, airdrop?
The Android phone can be the best in everything, but iOS will make me to never leave Apple!
It's not Android vs iphones it's mkbhd vs mrwhosetheboss😂💀
It is really personal. For me, Dex is just necessity.
Bro who won
Love it !!!
For the many years I've watched mrwhosetheboss this is the only video I've disagreed with to such an extent. They are painfully obvious in how biased they are.
Bias video clearly Samsung has the best display yet give it a draw. Photography are back and forth with these phones no draw on that. Then battery yes iPhone 13 pro max battery champ but S22 ultra is good also but have have faster charging but no draw smh. Not go say anything about customization but thats crazy lol.
MKBHD while he has great production quality...of course he will shill for Apple mostly. Most of his videos are basically love letters for either Apple or Samsung but hate on other devices.
Excellent job gents! I’m looking forward to 16. Nice conversation from two people who have the expertise and experience with more phones than anyone else.
I have used multi-window once! 2 years ago... it was incredibly useful, tho!
iPhones are more reliable, efficient, consistent...etc.....but the lack of a USB-C port is a deal breaker for some of us Android users.      Look.... I get it, Apple makes millions/year just by selling iPhone chargers, dongles and adapters which solve problems literally introduced by themselves (literally every WWDC presentation 🤣), but has Apple ever considered that they could actually make more money through higher iPhone sales volume simply by upgrading to USB-C and winning thousands of us Android users?
Shouldn't they be comparing   Android to IOS or Iphone to Samsung   It just doesn't make sense
Android is Linux based. iOS is just standalone. And you know that Linux is better, lol.
It felt like it was a completely biased opinion on iphones specially the software category and support , even if iphone does support 5 year software updates i have rarely seen someone using an iphone for the said amount pf time without facing multiple issues with respect to battery and choosing to upgrade also making a case for the environment topic
The worst video yet because you keep making apple good and Samsung bad
7.5 to 2.5 yikers. the only reason i have an android is because it was $90 total with a case and screen protector at walmart.
Mrwhosetheboss is easily the more knowledgeable
iPhone dominates and annihilates android devices
i think this conversation is highly circulated towards market region where people already got used with apple ecosystem a lot. with those thing considered of course apple will win by massive margin. at the end of the day it’s all about how people got used to operate a thing and from this conversation it’s just sooo clear for us what they certainly do care and what not🏃🏻‍♀️
Mkbh was legit making all the decisions talking absolute junk.  And mrwhostheboss was too polite to reject it.  Makes me annoyed.. he's so... British.
-_-
Me watching with an iPhone 6s 😭
Most importantly.. two legends together.. great sight to behold 👍
Boils down to your personal choice or scenario. I use a Mac. I love it. So I use an iPhone mostly because of that. And well I am also an iOS app developer.
OMFG mkbhd is an apple fanboy
*"Its a whole year old its crazy"*  Me with a phone from 2017: 👁️👄👁️
How can you not enjoy having the two best of tech in YouTube
Android is the best simply cz...    BATMAN can watch anime and get other apps iPhone iOS users will normally have to pay for, for free, adless and customize BATMAN'S screen with cute and or adorable anime Waifus BATMAN says!🙂
I will always love Android world for tge options it provides in market.
I decided to go with an iPhone this year as my personal phone (I have had iphones for work) and although I get some of the hype, especially when it comes to hardware, it does a lot of things that don't make sense. Notifications are just not as good as android, Siri is borderline useless, I don't understand why downloading files is such an ordeal, where is a systemwide EQ for music, why no USB-C (though other Apple products have it), and I have noticed way more app closures and app freezes than I ever did on Android. I guess there is no perfect phone but I guess I will see how long I last with iOS.
I just don’t understand how the iPhone got that many points its Preposterous
Just switched from a OnePlus 7 Pro to the iPhone 13 Pro, and ultimately it came down to a couple key reasons.   1. I live in the US, and so many people here have iPhones. Things like iMessage, AirTags and Apply Pay just make the experience better here.  2. Androids just seem inconsistent. OnePlus software is a shitshow, Google hasn’t figured out basic things in the Pixel like a quick fingerprint reader, and Samsung just comes with TONS of bloatware.  3. I don’t have to worry about battery life and performance on the iPhone. Androids do well, but iPhone is the clear winner here.  Bottom line: I didn’t really want to switch. I love the customizability and power user features of Android. I miss picture in picture so much. But iPhone has plenty of exclusive features too, and most importantly, I just don’t have to worry about the phone at all. It just works, I don’t have to worry about updates bricking my phone, and I don’t have to worry about it dying.
I love video when you colab with other youtubers
I would like to see other categories like: maintenance & repair, life of the phone, connectivity with other devices, and other
To put this topic to the rest you need at least 6 billion people. Basically it will never be over
I Have Been Waiting For Your Video 😃 Finally 😌❤️
You're both iPhone users and lovers, you give it all to iphone
Best collaboration
Android 💪
If u diel #*9900# in keypad  in android it makes its faster like REALLY FAST
Being more of an Android guy myself I can pretty much hear the Apple fanboys sharpening their sticks while I'm typing, but nevertheless, I can feel the bias reach through the screen and grab me by the throat all throughout this video, so I feel the need to address a few things. I'm not one of those Android users who's got some personal feud with Apple. I do recognize that iPhones do have their advantages, if not for everybody, then at least for certain types of people. Personally, I can't see those outweigh the advantages of Android - which is why I use Android phones - but to each their own.   This review, though, was substantially skewed in favour of Apple. I mean, it's easy to modify the playing field so it leans towards one side or the other by choosing certain categories or specific brands or phones. It happens all the time. But in this video, they couldn't not give points to Apple for pretty much anything, even if the discussion went in favor of Android. And some of the points they brought up, heck, I had the feeling an Apple rep was standing behind them with one hand on a paycheck and the other on a loaded gun. I know MKBHD leans towards Apple. But up until now, at least on this channel the reviews seemed unbiased to me. That changed with this video. It was pretty clear who was the boss when it came to calling shots and who just caved in and announced a tie when even the discussion went in favor of Android. I'm really sorry, but to me, that's not a neutral analysis. That's advertisement.   Hopefully this was an anomaly and videos like this won't become the norm on this channel. I know, losing a single sub doesn't mean anything to a YouTuber of this magnitude, so I'm not gonna try and make a useless "threat" in that direction, but reading these comments, it's pretty clear that I am not the only one who noticed a certain bias, and I wouldn't wanna see the reputation of this channel suffer from future lopsided analyses.   Just my 2 cents.
Anyone else notice the Matte Black - Matte White Vibes?
You guys should have discussed about the popularity of the brand in the society.For example, if you ask a random person to choose between  An IPhone 13 pro and a galaxy s22 plus,which one do you think could get chosen?  Imo, people would go over IPhone more  cuz it’s more common in their conversations and some people might not even know from which brand the s22 is 😶
I have never use my fast charger and my power bank since I bought iPhone 13 Pro. The battery is so good that it can last a whole day. I only use the rather slow wireless charger for overnight charge.
This video is purposefully made to glorify apple and iPhone.
So, basically MKBH rating. 😄😄😄 Mean individual opinion. Everyone knows Samsung s22 ultra screen, camera, functionality. Customization is best.
There is no right answer to this question...  I 100% think android is leaps and bounds better than iPhone BUT that's simply my opinion.  I've seen some people 100% say apple is better (I don't see it) but people seem to simply love one and hate the other lol
MKBHD is quite and aesthetically answering the questions "Matte Black Everything"
Shortcuts app in ios is incredible.
Android got dusted😅😅😂😂🤣🤣
You guys should have done a category on accessories like the their watch or ear buds.
I just need vanced or equivalent then I'll switch to ios
2.5/7.5 ?? so in your opinion apple is that much better than android
kinda bias because both are iphone users ngl
what a biased conversation! this should be done from a technical perspective, not from a biased perspective as you both are techtuber ... how do you feel about a phone that doesn't apply to others... when you don't use a feature of the phone, it doesn't mean it's useless and nobody uses it... fast charging is an amazing feature, where apple give us a 5-watt charger if u don't use zoom, that doesn't mean its useless... u may love a huge gigantic notch, but others may not like it ... and about eco-friendliness--- we all know apple told lies to sell charger & other products and earn a lot...   so much disappointed !!
As a new iphone user i must say... android is WAYYYY better - how the f does iphone STILL not have T9 dialing? Why the f can i not copy a phone number and paste in the dial? Why are the screen so sh on iphone?
I agree with almost everything, except the end. The iPhone is the best phone for EVERYONE. The only reason people choose Androids is because they want to go against the grain. And that's fine! I'm glad there are people that buy Androids because competition is so important for innovation! But saying that there isn't a "better" option is like saying there isn't truth - and absolute truth is definitely real. Ultimately, you're either picking the best (iPhone) or you're not.
Just unsubscribed to the hater, and subscribed to the real reviewer.
Till date iphone doesn't have an always on display..lol
This video is high on copium... typical iPhone fanboys, especially MKBHD...
Samsung
How's apple more eco friendly if they still use lightning cable? Third-party companies has to produce more and more accessories just because apple decide to keep the lightning port instead of switching to usb c. I understand apple has ambitious plans for the near future, but for now I don't think they are the most eco friendly
This is just your opinion and I don't take you seriously I love my android very much.
Marcus would say apple for everything even if he knows inside that its not true. Boss is actually neutral. Truly just likes tech and isnt bias
Perceived freedom is important to me. Being locked down into some ecosystem scares me. If I wanna go over there one day, then I should be able to go over there. Android is large ecosystem, with tons of competitors offer bespoke options if desired. Different comparison but a similar idea. I prefer Xbox's buy once play anywhere for a very similar line of though. Cloud, console and PC! If I want to go over there one day, then let me go over there with as little resistance as possible.
road to 11m boiiiiiiiiii
i think Android Should Have won the Screen, Battery, Photo and the category about the environment (as the whole point of android is that you have the choice to pick something that better suits you individually)   apple is just like here little sheep go back into your pen over there, that's is not even an exagerration
iPhone is clearly the superior smartphone
Apple add
Great video and great seeing you both go through the differences together. Personally, I have always used Android - maybe it's time for a change? Cheers for the honesty 🙏🏻
I think they skipped over a lot of important topics. Like how you are pushed into their services, so which one has better services? icloud vs google. compatibility with other devices, which ones have better app support, other things like that. They touched on airdrop, but that is just bluetooth repackaged with apple branding, and then bluetooth on iphone is hampered to force people to use airdrop instead.
Is the iPhone worth it without the rest of the apple economy?
the 69% battery at 1:10. lol
Overall in general Android is better. However some companies using Android are getting just as bad as Apple. In general Android is more open, more customizable, able to be better secured, has more choice, and more pro right to repair.  However as time goes on companies like Samsung and Google have become more like Apple. Goggle has gone out of its way to make newer Pixel models less right to repair friendly. Samsung disables the camera if you unlock the bootloader to install a custom rom. Things like these are taking Android backwards.   People should be able to do what they want with the products they buy, get the parts to fix those products, and either fix it themselves or decide who they want to let fix it. It shouldn't matter if the product is an Apple phone, a Tesla car, or a Cuisinart coffee maker.
i thing in photography samsung s22 ultra is better than iphone 13 pro max
iPhone doesn’t come close to android besides marketing and convenience of pointless tools. If you’re tech savvy iphone can hold you back.
So how much did apple pay you for this?
these comparisons don't make sense to me, it should be iOS vs Android , or iPhone vs an Android phone , not all phones that use android. iPhone battery vs ROG battery , iPhone display vs Samsung display, iPhone camera vs vivo or pixel camera .... how does that make sense...
Dude slow downn😂
MK just lost me. I'm still a subscriber and fanatic because I'm broke
If iPhones were that eco concious you wouldn't have to buy a new iPhone Instead of just repairing a broken part. Android is much more repairable since their replacement parts are available and can be serviced easily . Right to repair.. so the phone doesn't end up in the landfill just because of a small problem.
Can't leave android for mod apps being easily available🤣 even watching this vid on youtube mod🤣
Hmmf I kinda agree but disagree as well. IDK maybe coz their talking only about android and Iphone.
I really don't agree with the performance part. Sure iPhones have the better stats but if you go to game emulation iPhones are clearly the loser. So the point should go to Android
Every couple of years I’ll switch between the two. Both have their good and bad points, there isn’t the perfect phone or system 👍
Actually....  In battery, Android is the winner because I heard that there is a phone with idk 10 day battery  and photography.... sony has androids back  Display.... Samsung is the CLEAR winner  Videoagraphy and support go to iphone  rest all to android
There are just so many things about iPhones that bug me. The back button being located on the screen in the top left is stupid as fuck and even with huge hands i cant hit it easily. The settings are super unintuitive in that I cant just go wandering through them and expect to find the thing im looking for without just googling which sub menu it's under now. The complete lack of customization without paying for apps that allow you to do so in a very limited way. Being unable to swipe up to go directly home from the control panel is straight retarded.
I can agree with most of this. But how you give the iPhone the winner for the display is aggregious. Thick bezels and a huge notch. Its one major reason i wont switch. Thats a bad call.
It's kinda fun watching people talking about top tier phones, while having a budget phone for 200$
This really has changed my view on iPhone, thanks for letting us listen in!
i like both of you, but this video looked biased and one sided
I think when comparing features, its important to keep in mind that while some features are better on one OS, that doesnt mean they're not available on the other OS in some equivalent form, either by having a differnt name, or downloading an app.  Critically, if a feature is not possible on one OS, like if Android didnt have nearby share to poorly compete with airdrop, and you couldnt download an app to add that functionality, then it is a black mark on that OS that is just missing features.
biggest drawback of apple, super expensive to repair, expensive accessories
Since you guys are in Cali you should come by my house
The value should account for 6 points lol
With all due respect Mkbhd is little bit not making it fair for android
Android lost 2 points for FaceTime iMessage and airdrop.... outside us nobody uses iMessage and facetime that much... there are other alternatives that are simply better than them...
Most boaring video. Both are behaving awkward.
Tell me your an apple fan boy without telling me your an apple fan boy
Eco-friendly giving to iphone, Seriously?!??! The iPhone removes the charger and sells it separately with additional packaging. Not using universal Type-C for all devices.  I love MKBHD.... But he's throwing everything on Iphone but still uses a Samsung 🤣.
android has so many good options yet they still chose a samesung like bruhhhh
im so triggerd rn bc of some facts
7.5 to 2.5 lagdroid users go cry. Better cpu, best display, best battery life, best software, best 120hz , best privacy best camera . iPhone easy win.
The most biased thing i seen
For everyone saying “it’s about who’s best for you” is just pressed Apple mopped the floor with Android.
The amount of salty android fans in this comment section is crazy😂 Currently using a note 10 right now and I'm not even that mad.
apple better
arun to marques - It is so weird you choose to use one year old phone Meanwhile me with 4 years old budget phone –_-
Worthless conversation.
Dude is iphone pet
well, if i need to pay for anything on iphone then i wont use iphone.
I’ve missed this Arun.. love all your videos but the high energy Arun doesn’t seem as genuine to me.
We need more such collabs. This was fun😀
There is a little video on your BS
I adore you both and watch everything you guys put out, but this process is so weird. It's like what's better, apples or oranges (fine print: oranges means mandarin oranges, navel oranges, why not include nectarines, hell why not a grapefruit they're all kinda the same).  The comparisons are like the opposite of scientific and I understand that's not the intention here, it's muddied conversation to some degree.  I switched to Pixel 6 pro after years on iPhone and was just sick of apple constantly breaking new things and innovating on stuff nobody asked for, the ecosystem that locked you in better than it ever worked with itself, etc. So batteries, RAM, etc cool fine it's a tech channel. But quality of life is important. I remember being annoyed at my iPhone a dozen times a day and while it has its flaws, the Pixel is much better in my experience. It's a phone built for people who do more than just swipe up on social media apps, who actually manage a calendar, who use VPNs and automation and etc.  Idk I think a lot of the way people talk about Apple is just quoting their marketing slogans even when they know better.
Side loading apps on Android isn't on iOS so if you wanna mod any app you can't do it on Apple. Android wins there too.
this test sucks its an opinion not better its about how how you treat your phone.
That white balance tho 😅
tbh Android way better
I love MWTB, I have watched every video from him since I became a fan of him a year ago, but this was the most biased video i've ever seen from him. Many times even when I've expected the point to go to android after what they have said, it still has gone to apple. I just cannot believe that they would call it a draw in display topic, when android definitely smashes apple in this scenario, while apple got point for cameras, just beause they "reliable"? Or making a slightly better casual shor, while they completely lack strong zoom? I cannot believe this video...
Features on the Android are bigger than you think, look a bit closer...
I love i phones
You clearly mistook the points -7.5 should be Android,iPhone should be 0🤮🤦‍♂️
unsubscribed from both for straight lie
It's funny how every video that compares cameras makes iPhone the winner, but, in real life, I've always had Androids and my wife started getting iPhones the last few years. It never happened that my Android completely disappointed me because it couldn't take a good/decent picture. Now, that's not true for my wife's iPhones... On different occasions (even with her 13 pro) we had to rely on my Galaxy to take a good picture because her phone just couldn't... Including low light situations as well as close-ups. Also, pretty biased to give a  tie for features. iPhone has a 20% global market share, so iMessage and FaceTime are not that important to that many people. There are much better alternatives to those apps, people are just lazy to look for them and use them.
They are always talking about the best. But if you really think, do you really need that. You should just choose what you prefer and are the most comfortable for you. Love the video tho (:
iPhone automatically better 1,000,000,000% of the time! Automatically, automatically, AUTOMATICALLY!! *BETTER!!* Supreme in every conceivable way you can possibly imagine! 🥴  Everyone still stuck with a Tracphone ZTE Whirl 2 Android with Android Oreo 1.0 OS: "I can make calls and receive texts and that's all I need!" 😎  iPhone snobs: *"BLASPHEMY!!"* 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 Samsung Android users: 🤷‍♂️
MKBHD would be disappointed with the hotel lighting. Loved the interview!
This video is pretty much iPhone 13 pro max vs s22 ultra
I’m in the minority. I preferred content over quality. Sometimes I just put the video on and listen to it like a podcast. The content in this case was superb, the quality.. who cares 🤷🏾‍♂️.
**** iphones ****
in display , both of them are saying samsung display is better than it becoms a draw
Me watching on an iPhone 6
Android basically does everything iPhone does and so much more , iPhone cannot do what Android does ..
Apple play is more fluent then android auto and Reliable
This is so bias.
Mkbhd just loves iPhone,when you like something you accept it's flaws to
iOS has no more phones with a headphone jack while Android does. So Android wins.
Bro Crush
Some of these categories were like :   Is Android better than I phone ? Well yes but actually no
Arun : Whatever MKBHD said... 😐
ARUN. Aren't you supposed to fix your sleep schedule why are you recording at 11pm? Unless this was recorded before the health video.
I would prefer Samsung as the one daily,  but if I could get 2 phones as my daily then i would buy Apple & Google.
Definitely i phone is better
I ‘mreally disappointed I feel like this is a paid video there is no way I phone camera is the best we the users know the truth I have IPhone and Samsung but the experience I get from these cameras is different en I think Samsung is way too far since this guy is from America where Apple is made he can’t talk negative on it
how does this have 3.1k dislikes. wtf.
As soon as Marques said iPhone screen is "equivalent to Samsung's" I lost interest in the video. Don't get me wrong, things like software, software updates, eco system, RAM and Battery management is all great on an iPhone, but things like camera, display, customisation, pricing are simply the best on an android phone. I don't think iPhone is nowhere close in these areas. Camera, is a difficult pick because Android offers a lot more processing and enhancement and I know that is something of a personal choice. Either way the final score would be close to 5/5 or at max 5.5/4.5 for iPhone.
I use both! 😂
still android (samsung) will be my choice👍
Remember when iPhone battery had a running joke on how bad it was
Everything that was a draw goes to android in my opinion. Always good to watch my favorite YouTubers together, but I kinda disagree on alot of things.
Two Iphone Enthusiast Comparing Iphone & Android ,, From The Beginning I Knew Who Would Be The Winner Though ,
Poor Android phones!
Extremely opinionated  and personally biased  not good
Iphone vs Android is a very hard thing to do. Android simply has too many brand exclusive features that isn't available on all Android phones.. Iphone is more consistent on features since it is a single brand. As a really hardcore user who regualarly unlocks bootlaoder, root or flash custom roms, undervolts & overclock the cpu.. android phones are a must to  me. Also, I use some really obscure third party apps from random places or developers which I simply cannot find apple alternatives. One more thing is most apps cannot be geoblocked on android since you can just download the app from third party stores. Fast charging is cool, I don't need crazy fast but i want at least 45w charging or 20mins for 50% of the battery. Value wise, apple is worse if you talk about reparability. If you talk about how long you can use a device, apple kind of wins since it has 5 years of update policy which is ahead of all android phones. This doesn't matter as much if you know how to flash custom roms which is what I did for most of my android phones. Photography wise, I am an average user so even a mid-range camera meets all my needs. The accessory is much cheaper for android phones too, USB-C cables are cheaper and works for most devices I use.
Multiwindow split screen is super important to me and I use it everyday. As well as a good and proper one handed mode not that joke of reachability mode on the iphones.
I personally prefer android
Most none reviewers basically consumers consider the S22 Plus superior as the S22 Ultra is supposedly overpriced for what it offers with poor battery life don't know how true that is though.
Android has nearby share by the way which is excellentl.  A serious problems for Android is that you can't send photos or files to your computer because PC's don't have nearby share.
MKBHD is known for being an iLover. So biased I guess.
can't believe i spent my time watching two of my favorite youtubers being stupidly biased
iOS is better
Android gang!
I still pick iPhone over anything out there. Thank you!
Seriously display goes for iPhone... wonderful... 🙄
I don't get the iMessage and FaceTime thing,used it for a while and it's nothing special. Just use messenger which does the same
This video is literally just an Apple fan boy video. Android should have definitely the eco category just because iPhone has a 3/10 repair ability and it's so hard to repair iPhone.
Let's be honest here. Most people get iPhones because of the name Apple, and not because they know anything about tech.
Without watching the video I am 100% sure YOU WILL MAKE IPHONE WINNER. REPLY ME IF THE RESULT IS DIFFERENT 😜👍
We know Apple, Samsung & Google are gonna watch this ....
Marques is a Genius. Arun: "Do you think that it's just an average android screen with a thicker border and a weird looking notch." Marques: "It's funny, this phone (iPhone) has so many things which are best in class and weirdly below average." Simple text describing an iPhone screen.  Now, Marques gets into the details  "Screen to Body Ratio. Decent but the Biggest notch you've ever seen, Smoothest 120hz display" then details. Genius..
The biased from MKBHD man damn. Would have been fair if you considered many users complaining about apple using old designs and it cutting into their hands. Its also totally biased to say that the display of the Iphone is better than samsungs when the point of the display is to have better colours, and to be smoother from my experience the iphone can't beat many of the higher market androids on this. smh
One of the biggest flaws with "Android" is that the os is meant to support an unlimited and somewhat variable line of hardware. If you want the same comparison of the latest iphone vs the latest Samsung or pixel or Xperia etc, then the category winners would change.  Apple's biggest asset is the ecosystem. Androids biggest asset is it's adaptability.
I think both are completely biased for Apple.. because in real world.. iPhone can't come close to android in terms of value, camera, battery and customerization..
Never seen this little energy from mkbhd ever
Ironically when i got the Iphone 13 pro max, I stopped taking pictures, it is so boring, I don't know why. Now with s22 ultra and I am taking great pictures :) so it is preferences. loved the battery tho on iphone. but s22 ultra has also great battery :)
lol, no.. for me Android is miles ahead of apple. also other key categories you could consider repairability, accessory options , durability.
I think even though apple is ahead with being carbon neutral, Lots of android phones offer 1st class replacement parts through company's like Ifixit. This makes it easy to get 1st party parts unlike apple which has made it very difficult to get 1st party parts through their website. They also only offer their repair program to a limited amount of country's. So for environmental it should at least be a draw since android phones are easily repairable
Who doesn’t have a usb C around??😂😂
Someone forgot to white balance
I was confused about the whole features part. Apple has FaceTime, iMessage, and AirDrop but Android can also do those same exact things. Not only that, but Android has had those features longer than Apple has. Apple has FaceTime, Android has Duo. Apple has iMessage, Android has webchat. Apple has AirDrop, Android has Nearby Share. So, I think features should go to Android. Hands down
Gaming phones are not better than the "AA " other phones.
android
I love your videos they make my day😊😊
I find the split screen great on my S22 for transferring data from emails or lists to a spreadsheet or entering orders.
Impossible answer, most of all a subjective choice, in fact only for people that make their mind by themselves
Just came for the comments lol
I've been an Android fanboy for over half a decade now and for the first time in years I am interested in going back to iPhone. Honestly if they added USB C I would switch in a heartbeat. Without it though it's still a tough call
I think it's a time for companies to start working on the experience of the application on real life rather than pushing hardwares every now and then. If they want to charge, that also fine.
Apple nailed battery life
I feel like this is a comparison between the highest end iPhone vs all of android.
I respectfully disagree with the results but I do like the video.
Convenience of use could’ve been another category. The fact that I can simply plug in an android phone into my laptop and transfer files is actually mega. No faffing around with itunes
People by the Iphone bacause it is the "must have" fashion accessory,each year they tweak a few things and the sheep line up to buy them,whilst apple sit back laughing at how they have pulled the wool over their fans eyes again counting their money.
The real question is what phone did you use at end of the video for the finishing of the video that would really be the deal breaker (my guess iPhone)
If iPhone have higher results in those test it means only that they paid the company ,it is simple - to be better Apple Has to cheat ,in other case no way it is better.
Really cool discussion. I still stand by the statement that a jailbroken iPhone is the best phone you can get (for everyone, not just niche users) but apple continues to mess that up. But you both had interesting nuanced points.
This video and the final score were both a joke.
my personal opinion, i will unsubscribe both of you 🤪🤪🤪
… thanks 🙏🏻 to both !
As an iPhone user, I have to say that this is one of the worst comparisons I have ever seen. Even points that are clearly for Android are somehow evaluated in a strange way, or people talk around it until they have invented a point for the iPhone 🥲.  I like iOS and my iPhone but the points that are awarded are rather laughable 😅
I watch the video of both of you. You both like love from Bangladesh
Anyway ... It totally depends on your choice and affordability 😅
Shouldn't it be Android VS iOS or Samsung vs iphone.. one is an operating system and the other is a phone! Android phone eco system is toooo vast to be benchmarked against one variant of iPhone. Its like comparing all various types of oranges in the whole wide world to one Kashmiri apple!
Not the Collab we needed But the Collab we deserved
Why not talk about the mod able app for android 👀👀 3rd party apps and stuffs 😂
Blatantly hired by Apple:)   Lost all respect for brownlee
Wait wait wait, apple is better for the environment just because of their marketing......
I feel like Apple had the lead when the companies were first starting. But now I think Apple and Android are equals being good at things each is usually unique to. Personally I am an android guy but it's only because it's what I grew up using and feel comfortable with
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Comparing ios 16 with android 13, wait for android 16 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
amazing
Emulators for Android and controller support are way more developed and polished than iOS, USB-C Support was another huge factor for me. Being able to use the same charger for my laptop , tablets and phone is a huge plus. My DIY Solar setup also is more usb-c friendly than anything apple proprietary.
MKBHD just exposed himself to be honest.
I disliked the video for the fact that it doesnot take into account Android vs iOS and instead Android vs iPhone which itself makes no sense.
I just left the vedio when he give win to the android for performance
For the first time i have seen mkbhd leaning positively towards iphone
Is it just me, or does it really feel like they're very biased towards the iPhone? It really seems like they downplay the capabilities of Android, and spend a lot of time proving why the iPhone works better even though it's not in several categories. The battery? The iPhone is more "efficient". Ram? The iPhone is worse, but if "feels" better so it wins. Dual-screen? He personally doesn't use it so it doesn't matter. They talk about everything on the iPhone's side, and then compare it to the Samsung as a less important part. It seems really weird.
this is the only video I wont believe, I got both iphone 13pro max and Poco f4 gt and believe me, poco is way more better than iphone, performance,battery,display and satisfaction + free apps, iphone only won with camera against a half price phone
I feel they really missed the point with "Software Features" when they spoke of Apples features they just spoke of Apple softwares (which most non-americans don't give a shit about) that Android ALSO has just named differently (messages with RCS, Nearby Share etc). By features: Built in AppLocks, Hidden Apps, Gesture Navigation options (buttons/bottom swipe/side swipe, navigation balls etc), FINGERPRINT SCANNERS and FASTER Face unlocks that make HAVING A LOCK SCREEN almost USELESS.  What I mean by that is Everyone has the same experience with all the iPhones, but many people can have extremely different experiences with the same Android phone.
👌🏿👑🔥
THIS IS NOT FAIR YOU ARE BOTH IPHONE FANS BRING ME INTO THAT STUDIO AND I WILL ROAST IPHONE AND MAKE ANDROID WIN EVERYTHING
Are you comparing Android (which is an operating system) vs iPhone (which is a device) or Android vs iOS ?  If your're comparing Android phones vs IPhones what Android phones are you comparing there are thousands of Android phones made all over the world some which have and will never see the light of day in the USA or UK.
This video brought to you by Apple.  Many times it was said Android had a better one, but I like Apple more so we will give it to the apple.
This Has got to be the worse video I've seen on the channel in years, battery and screen should have easily gone to android. (and that is just the spec/factually better ones) don't top of that the video felt very rushed... he was tyred too saying so in the vid.... i hope he makes a follow-up video with only precise comparisons.  btw i love his videos currently my favourite tech channel and has been for a long time now, been here since under 500k i think, but I'm going to comment when i honestly think somethings wrong.
Very biased 'American' comparison..... They picked features and discussion approaches that puts iPhone at the top. I love Marcus and Arun. But guess their personal phone choice is something that doesn't resonate with me.
I knew before clicking this video iPhone is gone win  . But I don't like them
This seems to be more about Apple, android is there for mere comparison. There are many unique things in an android years back which where not there on an Apple.
So this video isn't about comparing Android vs IOS but its a little about Comparing Apple vs Samsung, and its more about provide Apple's iOS is better thatn Android and thats Hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 I mean ur Android's 100s of features are useless and iOS's little features which are available on Android in some or the other way are more important, im not against any OS its more about which is more suitable for me, but this video is biased towards Apple and i wonder what could be the force behind it(paid video i guess) but who knows
"ANDROID VS IPHONE - WHICH IS ACTUALLY BETTER" a title like we are 10 years back in time... There almost all the same. You can do everything you need to do with every device guys.... Just personal preferences
Probably the dumbest approach the android vs iOS debate
This guest seems pretty biased towards iphone
I will opt for Samsung because of the display!
love your collabs as always
Android better not buying a over priced calculator
Giving a draw for "Features" is so stupid. Android, just being able to sideload apps using APKs slam dunks iOS into the fucking shadow realm. Giving it a tie because of lockscreen customisation is so stupid.
Apple is much prefered in the US because Americans always are proud of something made in the US.   This has mostly nothing to do with money the S22 Ultra is very popular and priced similar to iPhone 13 Pro Max
Ios are just good but I would pick android for my phone beside if I have enough i would keep one ios by my side..I can't just get away with an android os it is just good enough to make me fun and busy through out the days and seeing how Sony keep up the headphones jack and memory card slot I really enjoys those feature that has been taken aways by other flagship companies i am pretty sure to pick my next upgrade with the sony phone i can feel it has a lot of camera feature to play with manual mode i barely take picture in auto.. manual is where I can feel like satisfying with my shot
Boom 💥
I enjoy the lively feeling of just 2 dudes hanging out and nerding over phone tech stuff  very nice
Android is not that bad. That's to ruff on android
Well, the result is expected. The iPhone is way better than all Android phones
Your in mark Robers vid!! I saw you sign the wall!!
In my opinion, the selection between iphone and an Android phone is purely and solely on your personal choice. We cannot declare any winner from them.
Im an android fan (s1 ultra user) but I agree the iPhone is more polished and better. I respect the iPhone and the overall consistency of its software and features. But Im still gonna use android as I love customization, Samsung Dex and file explorer alone technically can make my android phone into a mini PC I can bring anywhere. Plus Im not a fan of face unlock.
iPhone is just boring. I bought one then sold it off and bought a Samsung.
What about  the zoom Rounded displays Design  Flexibility  Moreover  Performance stability? The entire video is made up for iPhone 😂 company..Mrwhosetheboss...come on grow up..
Was thinking of changing from iPhone 13 pro max to Samsung again after like 7 years with apple. Now I’m not sure😂💀
I really don't care for Marques, or his channel, his opinions, really wish you had a different guest featured lol. Couldn't finish the video.
Great video you Guys.😊
Android any day for me💯. I don't agree on the software features. Android is miles ahead even though apple is catching up.
I think Apple is giving you lot of money....... nothing else.😓
should be Samsung vs iPhone
"that photo is never saved".. damn I though it was just me [OP6T]
Dude you can't go *These android phones do it better in this cattegory than the iPhone* and then still pick the iPhone because worse android phones exist
no matter what you cant call pricing a tie, like in no world  I still think phones go over the top with there prices, in an interview they even said they do it to retain its value and royalty
I would say this video covered what’s best on average. So for the average user, the iphone is best, but there are individual preferences that might make android better, it just depends on what you value in a phone more. I hope you guys do this kind of collaboration again some time
You legends in one frame 🔥
MKBHD ruined the video. Next time Arun should do the video himself
So many people defending android at this day and age, i though only apple had sheeps!
*When mommy & daddy do a collab🥰*
For me best is who has better batery
I love your combo
I use split screen on my Galaxy s10e daily, couldn't go without it
You talk about multitasking, but then discuss split screen multitasking. These are different things.  Android does keep things running better in the background.
I’m personally tired of iPhone and Mac and everything apple because you as an individual is restricted that’s why I can’t wait to go back to android cause I’m free there.🤗
Here in the Philippines, not many people can afford the latest iphone so much so that many people are using an iphone 6 or older, that's why the android market is the winner when it comes to third world countries.
Wait for NOTHING
It's more like SAMSUNG vs iPhone than Android vs iPhone
Having an IPhone or having an android < Having both an IPhone and an Android
Dual sim card sd
For me I love my pixel 6 pro. Been using this the nexus 6p
I remember when you made the video, talking about how critical you were of your own content. I really respected how vulnerable you allowed yourself to be, to tell us how you were really feeling about things. The reason I bring this up is because at the end of this video you apologized for a few things, not realizing how great this video is! If you ever read this comment just know that nothing has to be perfect for us all the time. It was great to see two creators come together, and make a great video.  -With love from the T-Mobile Manager somewhere in Milwaukee, that you and some others have helped with learning a lot about phones (:.
It depends which Android you buy...
Anybody remember apple famous commercial that mocked  IBM,  now apple become IBM and android the one trying to change things
iPhone strength is all available (brand new) model come with software reliability and ecosystem.  Android phone strength is The price for the value. Many people around the world need a phone just for contact their friends and family.
I will give you another category, which is for developers. To basically create an apple app you need to pay 90$ licensing fee, then submit it to store and hope it gets approved. For android, you just need the SDK and you are golden.  Someone may raise an issue of security with this setup, but if you are a dev of any substance, you will definitely be aware of secure practices.
Not the 5 minute crafts music💀💀💀
Whats wrong with the attire 😂😂
I couldn't even watch the whole video
You know what I don't need iphone or samsung i will just buy a xiaomi phone and install a custom ROM
This is unfair and unreasonable Samsung is better than iPhone  overall
Android having a back button is so nice
MKBHD went for a fist bump, ugh the dilemma of Dap handshakes.
Third world war will be conducted by Android fans vs ios fans
split window was so usefull
Iphone is like you are engaged and Android is like you are single now choice is yours what you want 😂
No Manual mode in Camera. no points ..
And Iphone had a draw with Samsung for display is enough to believe that they are saying the truth. (My poor English)
I would like to use my android phone without being constantly reminded how "better" the iPhone is
ANDROIDD
As never owned a single apple product and never opened an apple id till now. I'm planning to get myself into the apple ecosystem, . Is it ok? what are benefits i can get from apple eco apart from Android eco.  Would you recommend  to do this?? I seriously concerns right now about my type c cables and other type c accessories.  Getting into apple would cause me type c accessories RIP.
so thats a dumb video. Android is light years ahead of apple. lololol
Years ago I never imagined myself switching to an iPhone because it felt too "restricting" but here I am years later and I don't think I could ever go back to android. IOS just feels so polished, well made and premium. Where Android to me always feels "rough around the edges" and I always feel like I'm using some kind of test software.
One thing that i wanted to add here is that Apple has an amazing optimization team not just for the software but hardware as well,  but that's what you get from a company that only sells a single phone and hardware. Android is so hard to talk about because there is like more then 50 manufacture's that use the open software to make phones, EACH company would have to employ the same optimization's team apple has to make android as good if not better. Google and the pixel line leverages the full use of the operating system and all its optimization's because their the first party developer of the OS like apple is of their OS. Same goes for the apps from 3rd parties, they work so well with iPhone because the devs only need to make it work with one OS just different sizes (iOS, iPad OS, Watch OS, and Mac OS are basically one OS just scaled up or down for the hardware but are all based off one master OS).   In the end this video did one thing for me: opened my eyes to see how Apple is more or less catching up for the majority user and more better understand why people are such die hard fans of the OS and eco system, but for me alas im still a power user, my s20 ultra is always in split-screen, pop out window, i use my pen for notes, editing photos and as a shutter button when talking large group photo's, the phone also is the better hotspot phone (meaning i can connect like 15 or 20 devices to my phones wifi which is crazy), pass thru wifi hotspot as well super useful for not giving people your real wifi password.   I'll admit Dex and Bixby are useless, i have a loptop with good battery, to many desktops so i really have no use for my phone acting like a computer and Bixby is only so good at basic tasks. Google assistant is the ONLY way to go, i use that more then i talk to actual humans lol timers, calculations, conversations of units, planning trips, calling people, texting people, turning on and off system features. Sure all the others can do that as well, even bixby BUT it goes one further, google controls my house as well, lights, heating, window blinds etc. Apple has home assistant but Siri is cumbersome and boarder line useless as well (see bibxy for example).  Overall I would like to run iOS in my hands and see how it feels again, my last iPhone was a Steve Jobs creation and is almost the only reason im exclusively android now, I DO NOT LIKE HOW TIM COOK IS RUNNING APPLE AND WILL BOYCOT THE COMANY TILL I DIE! end of rant :) have a wonderful day if you read ANY of this lol LOVE YOU!
Mod Apk enters the chat
Absolutely amazing video…keep it up boss🫡🥷
W collab
Please disable non skip-able ads from your videos 🙏
my dog died
People live in their own bubble, its nothing wrong if iPhones won this comparison, because at the end the people discussing these things are already more geared towards iPhones from the beginning.  So, this comparison is just a personal opinion of MKBHD & MRWHOSETHEBOSS.  And yeah thats it.
Apple fan boys comparing iphone with android…Seriously?  Well I am using an Iphone 13 pro currently and before this I always had an android. And I will say android easily beats iphone.  The only benefit I can feel is connecting with other apple products. Like I have a macbook ad well and things becomes a bit easier .   But if ur talking about a phone alone, iphone is absolutely nothing .
"Apple ecosystem" is so stupid
Android...( Samsung)
We will do this same comparison in a few years with a pixel and an iPhone after they both achieved what they might think as an almost perfection. Just think about it.
I think mkd is slightly giving points to iPhone where Android is looking great and Arun is more practical and not towards any brand 🤔,  it's my opinion.
As I always say iPhone is for the majority that only need a phone that works... Most of the pple who watch YouTube videos to make buying decision needs an android phone  Android is very innovative and interesting for pple who love to use their money.   I bought a very powerful SMARTPHONE not just to FaceTime or have a 10 hrs 🔋 that's not really useful  I want to stress my $1k+... that's why I'll always and forever buy android  *reverse wireless charging  * very fast Charging speed *heavy customization to make my phone my own...  *developer option... 🔥 *even S pen hahaha *digital zoom 🔥  All of that good stuffs... Android is clear winner for anyone that uses their phone alot  And would get bored of a powerful phone that cannot really feel like their own...  (value for my money)   *Bonus 😂Someone with an identical face can unlock my faceID    but not my fingerprint...  Anyone (power user) that has used a good android phone knows what am saying
prolly one of his rarest videos where he didnt say the "a sub to the channel" phrase
Draw for features? Thats a joke.
It’s 2022; Are we really still having this debate???? (And no I didn’t watch the full video yet)
I actually have both and use both daily. iPhone 12 mini (personal) and Pixel 6 (work). I like living in both OSes it’s really refreshing to have all features between the two. I strictly purchased the iPhone because I wanted a small personal device and the 12 mini is perfect for that. If I had to choose however, one OS to give up it would be iOS. Android and the Pixel UI is just way more fun to use daily.
Mkbhd should check vivo x80 pro i guess he hadn't
MKBHD is without a doubt an Apple guy.
i live in a very tough family! IF my dad has to spend more than 900$ for a phone it would never be An Android phone he only gonna spend that much money for an IOS phone😂
This video is about mkbhd explaining scenarios where apple is really great
Kind of a funny one for me really, found myself disagreeing quite a bit 😂. I respect and like things about both platforms, but when it comes to the camera…ye it might take slightly longer to get a shot on the odd occasion, but rarely am I in a rush to take a photo…so for me I’ll go with android all day long because I’ll often get the better result, more flexibility of lenses etc and way more fun to shoot with. For me the better end result far outweighs the small things that MKBHD mentioned as drawbacks with the s22U. And there’s def a significant different between the S21U and S22U when it comes to the quality of results from the zoom lenses/processing.
This is the hardest video to watch. Thanks for the memes!!! iPhone's are for simpletons. 2016's LG G6's camera specs, on a Functioning Os with a slight boost to ram and storage. The IPhone lasts longer, because it ultimately does less.  You are effectively paying for a dumbed down smartphone. That notch tho!? Hard pass!! For Everything it offers in 2022 vs it's Price... it's another Hard pass! However, it is Great for consumers whom just need a phone to function.
Mkbhd is Apple fanboy
MKBHD was pretty biased imo
That’s it iPhone won and on a cherry on the top the results were decided by the two best tech YouTubers on this earth now nobody can say android is better than iphone
This sounded so biased 🤣
If you buy any one product of Apple, they forced to buy only Apple but in Android we can choose any different company products( mobile, tab, laptop, earphones,etc.) That why I like Android more.
POV: You don't have either of those flagships.
This was nice and all but it wasn't an eye opener fact-stats driven video, maybe you need to invite someone who can showcase what android can really do.
MKBHD apple fanboy at least
can i say.. i love this collab. should ne done more often 💅✨💃🥰💋
I love how peaceful this debate is 🤣🤣🤣
Zoom iPhones bigger weakness
The moment Marques favor iPhone on the display, it already feels like he was bias for iPhone. And it kind of affected the credibility of his opinions on other aspects although he brought up valid points. I am not loyal to any brand (I  switch between ios and android) but I think iPhone is still better in general. Only the price keeps me off the iPhone sometimes.
Why does  @Marques Brownlee sound unusually tired? And what is AirDrop? I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and I don't know what AirDrop is. These guys are suggesting it's very important.
I really like this calm style, please keep it
Pfft, fanboy.
So, essentially, the iPhone kicks Androids ass.😵
mkbhd is getting older,  i think he should plan to retire or do something else?
You guys need to start up a podcast . I'd watch you guys talk about and comparing tech on a regular
This is such a big bait for people to fight over this. Not that it already happens everyday XD I don't understand people fighting and boasting to each other on things they just bought and didn't exactly contributed to. Don't fight me about your phones, I'll show you features I implemented myself LOL
Alternate title :- iphone vs every other phone
Android is the Linux of the phone world. People who use the other system think its bad and complex but when you actually use it you realise its better.
the worst
I've never thought about the late approach theory. Now that I think about it, it kinda makes sense. With the competitors blasting away with their top of the line features and stuff yearly, Apple could just be sitting there and take notes and make it better. Damn, with all that time and patience, Apple could demolish the whole competition.
But Quick and Nearby share is at least as good as AirDrop
Great collab! I always say that if there was an Iphone with an Android software, it will be PERFECT!
19:40 Your bed time is 10 lol
Android ≠ only samsung
It's like iPhone advert. ?????? Samsung,xiaomi is better for photos...
Dear android fans. Apple being the biggest US company by market cap for reasons.
cool
Android army vs iPhone 😂😂
Where is Linus!!!!
Please do more colllabs. It was so interesting seeing two reviewers put up arguments for categories that made the other think and rethink about their choices, decisions, and statements in the video!
Loved the Collab❤️🔥
मजा नहीं आया
Anytime I hear the "iMessage and Facetime" arguments, while I do think they're very valid, I don't think people give enough credit to the fact that RCS is on Android and so is Duo, which works on everything (and I prefer). If majority of the people you talk to have iPhones and you don't want to feel left out, then I get it.
Let's just appreciate this fact, that these two guys doing this comparison together.
Bruhhh iphones display is made by samsung, HOW IS IT A DRAW🥴💀
U are famous that's why we couldn't talk anything but this video is 👎Android is also best..
Arun I have been waiting so long for this  Love from Greece
U are famous that's why we couldn't talk anything but this video is 👎Android is also best..
MKBHD is also a huge iphone or apple stan which also makes it a bit unfair
i really enjoyed this copmaprssion but i think mk is a little bit biased to the iphone ... but over all thats fire keep it up
"Price goes to Android"  Sweet I am getting an android.
I remember the time where people used to roast iphones and think they are over-rated but now the iPhone 13 just Almost destroyed all android phones I still think iphone is over-rated
U are famous that's why we couldn't talk anything but this video is 👎Android is also best..
U are famous that's why we couldn't talk anything but this video is 👎Android is also best..
"Lighting kinda sucks" ?
Yeah, Android definitely wins that poi.... MKBHD: Apple 🍏 Ayy a Point for Apple...
U are famous that's why we couldn't talk anything but this video is 👎Android is also best..
Repairability is another thing in which Android tops. 🤑
Love this combo!
You both look afraid when youre about to talk in a negative way to the iphone. Why? This review is kinda lame.
I personally come from a country with weak currency, therefore I prefer Android phones so that I can download modded apk apps like Spotify premiums, and occasionally some modded games to have 'infinite game credits' for that extra bit of fun. I know it's hurting the developers but oh well I'm a broke student from a weak currency country and I simply just can't afford to spend extras on these apps 😂 Amazing video tho! ❤️
Samsung is good when it’s new …. Few months later then it’s crap ..iPhone works forever
Facetime and airdrop?
Really Disappointed this video...💔
I kind of agree with the score, and I've been using Apple for the past couple of months after changing from the OnePlus 5 and I honestly can't wait to come back to Android. Small things, like you, can fit more on a screen, and put the icons wherever you want (especially with a big screen, having the most used apps at the bottom of the screen is super useful for me), putting this one more app in the dock in Android vs iPhone, for the same reasons as before. Google keyboard is SO MUCH better, especially if you're using more than one language. On iPhone, I need to constantly change the language for it not try to fix my mother language words into English and vice versa, and on google it just detects the language I'm using from the installed languages I got; also after a couple of months of using I have the feeling like the iPhone keyboard didn't learn anything about, and Google just knows what words I'm using and auto-correct is giving me the words I want when on iPhone is the exact opposite, it's just messing up my sentences all the time. And I know I can install google keyboard on my iPhone, but it just doesn't work in some apps for some reason, like Facebook messenger, which I'm using daily. Text editing is horrible on iPhone as well: on Android, I was just tapping in the middle of the word and it was letting me edit exactly where I tapped, whereas on iPhone tapping is hit or miss, sometimes it doesn't do anything, or it's selecting the whole word, or lands in a random place. You need to hold a spacebar and move around slowly, which is such a slow process compared to Android. Also writing with one finger (kind of Swift functionality) is only available in a couple of languages on iPhone (I have no idea why), whereas on Android I can use it with any language. Here's my little rant on the daily activities, that just break the iPhone experience for me 😁
Zoom is the bigger weakness of iPhones
Really Disappointed this video...👎💔
its just an long apple ad ..... right to repair on apple?   ... etc
MKBHD talking like an iSheep.
iphone better
Quick share 13:30 ?
General BS
Really Disappointed this video...💔
Love the takes on both echo systems  need more team ups I don't always agree with Márquez but his views on tech are usually neutral and seem genuine towards advancement of tech. Like his Tesla Commercial that got picked by Tesla a few years back
"When you get sponsored by Apple but not allowed to say it in video "
Really Disappointed this video...👎💔
Light outshine darkness 🤣🤣
Really Disappointed this video...👎
I have been loyal to Android for years. But now two of you guys reall got me thinking. Maybe I'll give it a try for iPhone
Really Disappointed this video...👎
android badly lost
Really Disappointed this video...

Really Disappointed this video...
I just want dual sim and expandable storage, That's all.
Apple is certainly not focused on the environment. It skips the 2nd R: reuse. The massive focus on recycling and getting a new thing is hurting the planet, and Apple is just greenwashing itself.
I've grown to kinda hate marques at this point  He just says the iPhone is "better" with no logical explanation. He's just spouting bullshit at this point.  The features category didn't go to android. Why? Cause why not.
This feels extremely biased and I disagree in a lot of things, but who am I to talk about this?
Ok so to conclude iPhone is better than Samsung in MOST ways
if you are outside the US you don't need facetime and iMessages so you can give that point to Android, and if you don't use the camera that much especially taking videos give the point to Android
Really Disappointed this video...💔
Android is better than Iphone in gaming thanks to emulation,i can play SM64 on my android phone while on iphone you can't
The points are just his opinion for me it would be 10 for Android and 0 for iphone 😂
Best match up on YouTube since youtube
Happy you guys did this video together. Very interesting
Mrboss dont mention anymore ram of iphone he fvck all day and night androin
No mention of good android phone  for about 200€-$
A phone is a tool, not a status or fashion statement because is not even a big difference. Choosing between a USD 1k or $10K phone, thats BIG difference, your whole life is different if you choose the expensive one. But just over pricing a phone doesn't mean your have MORE MONEY! On that take Android phones will be a smart option!
I love my samsung 21 ultra 5g... I stay with it! 🥰
The thing is, the 2022 samsung is already released, the apple not. maybe you do another in october when the phones out?
Clearly Aaron is a Android fanboy and Marcus prefers iPhone. I am glad there is this balance xD
For me, iPhone can have all the advantages in the world, but its restrictive experience makes me choose android always.
Android vs iOS
So Android is shit, well who is going to buy me iPhone 13 Pro max ghhgfsjfaisfoaAAAAAAAAAAAAA?
Apple sponsored
Personally I think you missed a lot of categories that are more important than most of the ones you covered, where android would be WAYYY ahead. For example, connectivity (USB C), and all of the dev features available in Android(like you cant even install anything on an iPhone unless it is though their proprietary app store!)   Also, a lot of the features that you said IOS has that Android doesn't, android does in fact have an equivalent feature. For example, airdrop. Android has an airdrop equivalent called nearby share. And facetime is one of those things that shouldn't be built into an OS at all. Why not just use something else, for example snapchat , that everyone has already and works on both android and ios just as well?  I think that the only reason IOS is so popular and the whole reason that some people think it is decent at all, is because so many other people use it. If the same number of people used IOS and Android right now, and no one was biased at all because of how popular IOS is, I think it would quickly fall towards Android.
This video has probably (heavily) changed my belief on how much I phones are are better than android, and I'm an android lover 🥲
I was subtly expecting this collab when I saw the both of you in Mark Robers video.
how does the iphone win the eco friendly one weren't they the ones who started the no charger trend just to make more money
Surprised Reliability is a draw, still on Android and I've had so many huge issues with Android and just a lot of BS all around that I'm pretty over it and am switching next time. It feels dangerous to some level to have a phone so unreliable and I my phone just stopped working one time when I was in an emergency and that was a huge eye opener
I'm sorry, but iphone customization is not even close to android. Android can completely change how it functions with launchers and apps like KWGT or KLWP. Iphones meanwhile can't even install apps like this; can't even install APKs
Personal choice obviously, I would choose Apple over Android purely on the ability to manage my privacy better. I love being able to turn off tracking - and I find it funny now when apps are asking me nicely if I can turn it back on.
well clear that you guys are iphone boys
me using iPhone 6 be like eco friendly
i just recently moved to iphone after i lost my samsung a few months ago as it was the only xtra phone in the house and honestly am enjoying the experience ,BUT i miss andriod so bad(samsung to be specific) that i am switching back in a week or two when my order arrives . I have enjoyed the simplicity of iOS but thats the problem for me, i miss playing around with my phone and making my phone so unique and my own that i can meet hundreds of people with my exact phone and they will still ask "what is this on your phone" or "why is yours different", thats somthing i have found missing with the iphone, it got boring fast for me plus there are features of andriod that am used to that apple can't offer, just like iphone offers it's old users features android won't offer them. So i guess it comes down to experience and preference, which in my case android fits my personality more than iphone.
Congratulations on being shills, Android cameras are obviously better, zoom, options, settings, every photographer would agree, people who use Apple iOS don't even know how to keep apps on their phone from auto deleting, and no app crash reporting, but just give all the points to Apple, what a joke!  Gaming on Apple is so much better, despite the fact that I can play entire game libraries from old game systems in emulators on my Android phone.    If this isn't the gray poupon of proving to your users that you have no idea how the real world works, then the world is lost.     Yes, Apple wins in processing power, and battery, and video (though that's opinion with Android image stabilization being light years better)...    Weak ass biased video, I expect more.from you Mr. Whosetheboss....  Maybe consider more.outside sources when writing your videos to help eliminate significant biases like these?
Great Apple Ad, fist video of you i disliked... the bias reeks
Android is not a phone. Compare best oF Android to best oF Ios
U are famous that's why we couldn't talk anything but this video is 👎Android is also best..
Camera is much more BETTER ON ANDROIDS THEN ON THE IPHONE 🤔🤔🤔
And iphone is very very good quality and its very hard to actually damage it to the point of not working anymore where as with android its easier to break
Unbelievable how can an iPhone beat Android in charging . I bet lot of iphone users want fast charging . Even the battery life too
Good to see both in one video.
Every time Marques speaks:  Arun: hmm woww....ohh
to me, it is not about which one is better. it is all about which one i can afford. my phone is a $180 Samsung
Honestly agree with MKHB about the Iphones currrent shape, yeah, its odd that it doesn't conform to the hand, but i personally loved the Iphone 4s design and feel, bringing it back for newer iPhones has damn near made me re-consider my next phone being an android.
wait camera goes to iphone ? by what metric ? instant unsub
So funny that Maques talks so highly of iPhone but carries a n almost 2 year old android. I really enjoyed this video a lot and think you should potentially try to do more like this.
U are famous that's why we couldn't talk anything but this video is 👎Android is also best..
Yes the iPhone on paper is better, but Marques still using a 2021 Samsung S21Ultra!  I do think this tells more than setting up a list of questions that sets iPhone on top. BTW also very happy with my S21-Ultra.
I feel that android is too broad to compare hardware with the iphone
This sems to be a very First World Countries (main US/EU) take Try asking anyone in 3rd World Countries (non US/EU) and see which one "wins"
U are famous that's why we couldn't talk anything but this video is 👎Android is also best..
I don't agree
Ooooh
just a phone as long as it works idc
My takeaway from this video was extreme bias was happening  In terms of eco, never mentioned how Apple usually plays up their eco friendliness to get out of drama and not because they actually care  How they don't use usb c for literally no reason and it's causing mass charger waste   In terms of cameras the vivo absolutely destroys iPhone but because the iPhone has better video, literally one feature you gave it the win  How Apple somehow won software features???? This is the same phone that doesn't let you arrange homescreen items the way you want or have a live wallpaper but they have more features apparently because facetime and imessages somehow beat the entire suite of exclusive android features, bullshit lads.  In terms of the screen even, calling it a draw???? The s22 ultra has an immensely better screen than the 13 Pro but it's a draw because lower end androids can't keep up???  No shit, why are you comparing a flagship 1.2k iPhone to low end android phones, it should be price equivalent
ഡേയ്... ഡേയ്... ഡേയ്  mkbhd നിർത്തടെ നിർത്തടെ...!!! താനെന്താടോ iphone നെ മാത്രം അങ്ങ് പുകഴ്ത്തുന്നെ.. Eco system -വും.., battery യും.., video stable ഉം.., ഒഴികെ  ബാക്കി എല്ലാം..

I love how right at the end mkbhd went to dap up mrwhosetheboss but he missed it n played it off
It would have been a holy Trinity of tech reviewers if GeekyRanjit was here too.
Interesting video, would personally never switch from an android to not get stuck in the apple walls. Few things about android really matter to me like usb c, modding as mentioned, bit more freedom (sideloading etc). This was weird for my brain because while i don't disagree with you guy's point scoring, android doesn't feel like a 2.5 vs 7.5 os to me. All comes down to opinions and preferences. keep up the great content!
This was an unfair video but hey. Opinions are just that, Opinions. Android all the way
The best phone for most people its simply tye iphone  especially for older ages its way easier to understand
Android phones don't use more RAM because apps are less efficient, it's because Android apps use the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which means that it just takes more RAM. When it comes to games, both are compiled into native byte code which means that both use around the same amount of RAM.
I’ll just say, the Iphone notch fkn kills me
Nice anyways i'm getting a new phone so this will help
I feel like A LOT of iOS software "advantages" aren't technically features but a case for anti-trust legislation. I mean, what does iMessage do if people aren't locked into the Apple eco system? It's glorified bloatware.   Android sync features are often based on Chrome, free software for any operating system, Apple's requires you to spend a grand on a Mac.
Android. It's easier to pirate apps 💀🔥
did you buy a new mic
Currently iPhone are the best smartphone but when affordability comes to play it completely changes to android. Most people can't afford iPhone.
God  i never ever disagreed more on these two honestly amazing youtubers. If i would have to explain it would be longest comment here 😁 the fact that you have androids with slightly worse battery but much faster charging time it's a pure win for Android. About widgets, while they look great on IPhone you're still kinda limited compared to Android,  not to mention other customization features 😉  Being able to download 3rd party apps must matter guys... and so on 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Android > Iphone
The phones are just same from 2016.
How can you draw screen and asthetics, seriously
imagine that handshake at the end would have been weird
MKBHD & AARON both show us that the IPhone is the real CHAMP by numbers and actual use . Great job I love it
I hate the curve
What you did with dent is so cool
I feel like you need to take into consideration the fact that iPhone is a widescle thing mostly in countries in the west, when it comes to Asia I've found that the majority of people use android Meaning apps like facetime and Imessage are meaningless to lose since we have Google duo and what app etc
There are a lot of things they didn't said but that would be a long long video, but it all comes down to what do you prefer and for me it's android
In Europe 🌍 Android is way Bigger than iOS, and its way better integrated into the Eco System. Here is a slight racist thing we always say "There is always a Chinese that is better than you". Means IPhone is Good, but there is always an Android that is better at that category.   Here you use your Phone for Work, use it to RTM Machine and share things to your Windows PC.. What is Mac?   From Switzerland Side, Amerika is like a 2nd/3nd World Country, not that highly developed and more like "Brands = Personality". And when you have a Doctor in something, you probably need to remake it here.  USB-C is big Killer, no 64W+ Charging, no 120hz, no opem App Store for Work Stuff. iPhone mostly used by forgein or People from Forgein Country and stay here.
Just buy both .
AI was much better on my huawei 30pro than on my new iPhone 13pro max. And enormously better
Mkbhd is just biased to IPhone at this point😐
When it’s question about who is the best  MKBHD’s answer will be any kind o iphone pro max…And for me yes iphone is best
In terms of performance  it really depends  on what you want out of your phone iPhone are great if the apps you want are supported, it's optimal but anything  slightly  obscure  and you hit a wall at 120 mph so android  has alot more flexibility  just because  the amount  of app you can use and how much freedom  you have
iPhone users always says Android is bad software because of the ugly Android 4.4-7 days. But now Android 12-13 is just so good i use both i just prefer Android 12-13 customisation with Material You
That guy's a fuckin iPhone fanboy bro, completely disregards iphones shortcomings and says, "I still like it better" 🤦🏻‍♂️
Great video, love these collabs; keep ‘em coming
Lol do it later but better? Sure, let's copy what they already made. So ez and unoriginal...
15:20 Márquez is 💯 right I trigger Siri more then I use her but that my change with Dictation
Not the video we want... a dialike but 👎
Android all day!!
Boy this is a controversial episode, I can smell the salt from both sides from miles away
clickbait title, love it!
The fact that they compared one phone (iPhone 13pro max) with every android phone says a lot. Great video by the way!!!
This is a very honest comparison for real. Bless you guys, Much Love from Nigeria 🇳🇬
I love this video. Finally I can better explain to my android friends that I phone has really evolved. I mean the features the battery life the software update. It’s amazing 💯. The best phone in my opinion.
*sponsored by apple.
Yes, almost perfect video. Although there’s some mentions that could’ve been more specific, like that Android flagships actually consists of a variety of devices, so we shouldn’t be mixing and matching the specs of Android phones in comparison to iPhones. Other than that, iPhones are really just cheaper than flagship androids nowadays. Not only do they match in retail prices, but Apple offers much better service, updates, and more importantly a much higher trade in value (+ low depreciation), which would make it a no brainer to get iPhones instead.
Both of them are good. I like Android way more because it gives you flexibility in price, customization and devices. If you want an iPhone, you now have to bind almost any devices to Apple if you want them to work. That and Android have usbc cables which I think are very usefull.
iPhone is better!
Convince me it was a comparison between iphone and android in all areas, and not between iphone 13 pro max and S22 Ultra 😐
Hahahaha
So after 20 mins it’s basically, “we don’t know, you choose”😂
basically a pointless video, isnt it
I think this video is about Samsung vs I phone
This one felt boaring
7:55 wth is this video sponsored by apple or wwat
This was very fun......  Was it though 🤣
its totally bullshit its not reality its totally yours personal opinion
MKBHD came across way too biased towards the iPhone so I felt this was not a fair comparison. You should do this same video but with Mr. Mobile who would probably give a better assessment. I personally hate iPhone and only use Android after watching the Steve Jobs movie where you see how much Apple plays people in order to keep their mindless followers.
Very cool video, more videos together would be awesome and could give us both perspectives.
someone wise once told me "Android crawled so the iPhone can run..."
Basically iphone vs Samsung
Not the video we want...not at all good..sorry
i love both apple and samsung
Why does this feel like Apple sponsored this video 🤦🏽‍♂️
Are you a npc? You just spawned in California
Tbh kinda disappointed abt this video bc u can clearly see iPhone was in favour of MKBHD 🙂 even on points where android is way better
At the end its down to personal preference and Iphone for us because of everyone using there it will be awkward to use an android though i still use an android for my line of work and what i do the phone Android offers me more than IOS. I don't see myself using iphone in the near future.
This tech channel finally accomplished their goal. The debate on which is better
Paid for by apple cough cough lmaoo. We here them both say on many accations that Android is up on everything and then in this video no it's apple. Apple will never be the best
Its soooo much easier... do you want iOS or not. Thats is, if you want iOS you dont have alternatives.
Why is he the only choosing?
MKBHD basing towards all Apple products is the reason why I stopped watching his videos  he makes good content, totally agree but man, he is biased most of the time towards almost all Apple products
Fun fact: When Arun and Marques gave a high five, Marques wanted to to a fist bump too..
Apple perfects the little things, whereas samsung and most androids somewhat ignore them and try to be "innovative" with gimmicks
i don't know how the display is a draw
Regardless of the outcome, still gonna be a great video. That said, go Team Android!
After "Master of no trade" video that mysteriously vanished from Marques channel- I saw him as a big problem in tech. Later, when he started to preach about LG not paying reviewers, and that being their own fault- I KNEW he was the problem. At least big part of it. I recommend unsubscribing. He literally made video about paying reviewers (it was collaboration no long after LGs demise) and it was obviously video about himself. I dare you to find his LG V60 review video. Where he titled it (quad DAC, stereo speakers, 4 microphones device) "Jack of all trades but master of none". He is big reason of why we are having fewer and fewer features on our new phones. I recommend unsubscribing.
It's a preference and for me, I'm a lot more efficient with Android. Because I can customize the UI to my liking. iOS is too by the book, it's not efficient enough to me, seems like the most basic task have too many steps to do.
iPhone/iOS represents clean, quick and easy, manual and  a overall what we could depict as a organised system, a, professional view of adulthood, it has young features but at the same time a more adult view. iPhones are more for people seeking a more professional environment than one that allows creativity to flow freely, it limits itself, phone wise to sleek, curved or basic back designs. No fancy stuff basically.    Android represents the more creative type users who don't want to be bound. Customization and more complication in the long run, but overall creative types who don't want to be bound to system rules, modify and develop. Smart, creative but slightly messy.  I used to be an iPhone user, i literally felt my hands were tied on what i could do, I felt limited, little customization, root file access or such. As an android user i felt free. Unlimited. Not bound to the rules of the ecosystem of the OS. The phones just kept evolving and getting better design and hardware wise.
These reasons make no sense to me. I would take android over iOS all day anyday.
Arun watching Ted Lasso ???
Lol
@3:45 How can you use if your Iphone cant do it
If you care that much about being carbon neutral, swim back to UK...
For some reason i like the notch Im weird tho
Iphone should bring the fingerprint & little bit more zoom on camera that's all and it is no1. Maybe multi tasking too😁
It is like conparing a doctor and a engineer😂😂
Oh boy the comments section. And to be honest I kind of like iOS.
Imo Eco Conscious point should have been to Android. While iPhone (and Samsung as well) removed the charger with the thoughts of protecting the environment, MrWhoseTheBoss already had a video explained everything about it. It's kinda unfair to judge based on just carbon neutral point, I think you should have thought about other aspects too
You can do whatever you want in Android, while in iOS, you do what apple thinks you wanna do. End of story.
Why you guys didn't talk about Type-C?
this score would've been a lil different if MKBHD wasn'there. Here's a thing..... He's born & bred AMERICAN &... he works too much to find the little goodies in IPHONE/pixel but ignore hundreds of features on non American brands which is sad honestly. other than that great video
So I agree, iphone is a better phone. I won't ever use one because I use almost all of Googles products (hardware & software), and the Google pixel just integrates better with my life.
Hi, do a video like this but this time Windows vs Mac vs Linux 😱
Why people only compare samsung flagships when it comes to Android? There are several other brands that perform better than samsung in several sectors, so saying iPhone beats Android using samsung as competitive as totally stupid cause even many Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Huawei flagships have some features that better than Galaxy S series
iPhone is for rich people. Apple is just a hype brand. Android is reliable. Android is customizable.
I believe this is bias cuz samsung actually has a better battery life. And I use a samsung
Can gift me any of your phone  Now I am using samsung  s7edge  the phone was passed from my father to me  and I barley  use this   not a single  filter workers
why does it feel like this video was sponsored by Apple? it was quite a few topics that I would have disagreed in.
BEST YOUTUBERS , BEST FRIENDS , BEST VIDEO IN YOUTUBE
MKB - iPhone fanboy as usual! Smh still respect the dude a ton.
We got Nearby share on Android which is similar to airdrop bro 😏
Did apple pay this guys to humiliate android....?
Android Is the clear winner, Android phones are much much better than any iphone.
I kind of always figured the comparison goes in favor of iPhone, But Personally I am not a big fan of the apple So called Eco System, I use a s22 ultra, use Samsung buds 2 and a watch 4 . The Connectivity with the apple products they talk about, the same works with Samsung products, you can do more with a Samsung eco system than what apple does. My phone seamlessly connects with my windows laptop, i can get calls on my laptop and have my earbuds connected to the laptop and switch the audio to laptop to talk in the phone. I never really got used to the apple UI in all the products its not that fun and the power that they talk about doesn't really matter if you are not able to take full advantage of it.
iPhone fan boi
I know! Let's get Marcus who DEFINITELY isn't biased towards Apple to talk about if Apple better than Android. And the SHOCK AND HORROR! Apple wipes the floor with Android in a landslide win.  Joke of a video. I saw it coming from minute 2.
A lot of people are gonna be mad at this one.
I guess  its all about software.....like if we take  PUBG...its runs smoother on an iPhone...   bcz iPhone has a dedicated software  only for iPhone..  meanwhile  the software is kind of different in all phones due to the skins over android...  so thats the main reasons..!
IT'S A GREAT VIDEO  AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT APPLE 🍎  WINS  And unfortunately for " Android , "  That means APPLE 🍎 iPhone 14 Pro Models  Will be the 🌎 's LEADING SMARTPHONES  Of course I will decide after the S22 Ultra versus iPhone 14 Pro Max reviews  But I might as well pre order !  JAH BLESS ...  🙏🏻👍🏻👏🏻🔥🚶🏻‍♂️
you are SUPER biased towards apple, marques was pretty neutral
For me a 10min charge is all i need in my OnePlus and that wins for me
Well, this is a biased video in any case and as any one’s view. And I think that compare a one company product with whole industry is like comparing an apple with a watermelon- You just end up with things of different sizes but some what similar.   For my biased view iPhone just don’t bother me, that’s it.  I won’t some exciters and delighters. I still prefer my previous HTC U11 photos made with excitement than 12Pro’s “ok it’s too time consuming to make it perfect, I’ll just shoot like it is”.   And I tried to play with all preferences on it but found little to no difference and it was fail for iPhone.   iPhone is really good on being reliable white elephant that’s impossible to “get that candy right now”. I like it but I’ll buy exciting Android that can erase items from my photo with one touch.
Fun fact: Skip video to end and decide which was better 😅
Love these guys! Both of em! Literally the two best YouTuber’s on the planet!
Ion know how to feel about this .. mainly .. my issue is.. . Since when has apple\iphone started to beat android\samsung in battery life ?!?! I'm really fighting the urge to think that maybe mkbhd and Arun may have been bought out by apple ....
Aren't some IPhone's made using Samsung screens? Swear I heard something about this somewhere but Idk
waah Arun Waaaah
you forgot to mention your sponsor - apple
you are Iphone suckers, you always lean to Iphone no matter the crazy features and specs in the new generation of android
Im using s21u for a year now, i think. And it lacks battery life, atofocus, reliability. I miss notifications and alarms, it beeps all the time for no reason, but misses the alarm occasionally. The screen is rounded, so my screen protector always rips off. Expert raw is only 2 shots buffer, useless crap! Nah ... I would go for the iphone 14 next time samsung is useless
watching on iphone 🤣
Mmmh how did android tie with Apple on screen. Guys cmon stop the bias.
This should've been apple vs Samsung
What about Privacy?
weird take but i dont think samsung is the android phone anymore. there are way better androids now than samsung overpriced shit. and there performance suck compare to other androids
Another thing is how most people in US use text/imessage and therefore tend to go towards ios more. (not a reason for me but a reason for quite a few people)
Sponsored by Apple =/  real talk though, some of the things that Apple won were done so with disingenuous reasoning and by actively ignoring Android strengths for iPhone conveniences...which isn't what the video is supposed to compare. If it was about which phone is more "convenient" to use, then I'm sure most of us would concede to Apple, but that's not it, is it?  I mean, when comparing performance and RAM, nothing is mentioned about how Apple's 6g of RAM only goes so far because it doesn't do as much. It's like saying a Tesla is a better off-roading than a 4x4 because it doesn't break down. It's not because it's better, it's because it doesn't extend itself in that way. iPhones don't rum emulators, don't do picture-in-picture, don't run apps in the background, or anything that actually requires power. Terrible.   terrible comparison by two of the best in the industry...disappointing.
Why don't you talk about any of the OnePlus phones??
Took many ads
Samsung has USB type C, reverse charging, dex support, s pen, better display. Plus it's much cheaper compared to buying an year old iphone. These things considered I'd say android has better value for money if you can wait.
Oh
For me it's not the product itself that I hate, it's these people who buy iPhone to look rich and trendy and assume everyone using android is poor and out of season or worse, disgusting. I use both ios and android I love them both, consume media on my iPhone 13 and gaming on my 144hz Xiaomi. I appreciate the tech itself, and utilize all its feature.
Awesome video guys 🙌👍👏 thanks should do this often 👍👏🙏
I have no problem with iPhone. I have a problem with Apple. As an app developer, Apple absolutely sucks.
You can't compare all of android to just one brand because even though android has amazing phones from the big companys like Samsung and Google you also have small brands that are bad and take down the whole perception of android.
Android.

Apple = no innovation
Interesting how you both wore exactly opposite colors. Wonder if it was actually for a reason
I stopped watching when they put iPhone screen and design same as the S22 ultra come on bro🤣
In my opinion, I think you compared more iPhone 13 PRO vs Samsung galaxy S22 utra than android vs ios. How can iPhones win in terms of battery life versus android phones?
Came from iPhone 13 Pro Max . Currently using Sqmsung S22 Ultra. At first hour of my S22 Ultra it felt like super laggy compared to iPhone. I convinced myself to not switch to iphone yet and give samsung a try. After weeks now, after few samsung updates. I can say, I now prefer Samsung. ♥️ Somehow, I still prefer iPhone's camera for photo and video.  My opinion only.
This is like comparing cars with trucks. Android is much better overall for Developers and Hardware Power Users. Apple is more for simple people who just text, call and sometimes play a few crappy  games. The battery lasts because of the lack of functionality and flexibility functions that Android uses. Also you can make an Android last longer, just disable all the bloatware and services you are not using. It's just so obvious for developers and smart people, iPhone is useful for people who don't know how to fully use their devices. Camera? Duh use another app if you don't like the stock app for Android. Man, I fully dislike people who think iPhone is better, it's not true..
So basically Apple has its own unique monopoly to itself so it’s sustainability can go further?
I disagree
Android is better in pretty much every way, but iPhone gets 80% of the way in most while on Android it isn't just a single phone that can beat Apple. The way you look at the average here is not really fair, as all iPhones are way more expensive than an average Android phone, so it lowers the score on Android by a lot.
8:19 England being boring and at times tragic at international competitions
I dont know why but it felt like Arun wanted Android to win a couple of times but marques not only stuck with Apple but somewhere convinced Arun for the very same😂
IPhone and Samsung are together their Partners so the cameras and the screen that you have in your iPhone are built by Samsung so basically it's a tie
Ecoconsciencness: winner iPhone USB-C: Am I a joke to you?
Really enjoy your collaborations with Marques..!  Look forward to more in the future!  I Hope you both managed to at least catch a beer together :)
I feel like android phones beat iphones eveytime in MY OPINION but still that's a great collab video
its not proper comparison bcz they are just comparing IPHONE and SAMSUNG not other flagship android phones which are better than IPHONE!!!!!!!
I stopped watching when they put iPhone screen and design same as the S22 ultra
I don't understand in this day and age of mods,hacks and cracks, isn't it possible to make your device achieve everything the other device could. Like if iPhone has a Built in feature exclusive to it, there might be several mods and hacks available to get the same feature running on Android you just need to have knowledge of how to do thst
I will prefer Android,    Apple is totally waste.. 🗑
IPhone sucks 🖕🖕🖕
This video is boring💯
Iphone is no brainer if you're in an apple ecosystem. The pictures that most mobile phones take are amazing to be honest. As we can see from every years blind phone review.
이기는게 없노
iMessage, face time its just useless if you don't have friends who have iphones too.
There is one huge part in Eco you missed, repairability. What's the point of slimming down resources used on your phone when if it breaks I need to buy a whole new one anyway.
this was really bias opinion from two i phone users lol
You both sound super tired , what time was this shot haha
MKBHD: Been using s21 ultra for a year and half!  meanwhile in all the videos wears apple watch, ye could say he uses both! but come on your primary device is what watch you are wearing:D
Idk seems one sided 😕  for saying there about the same   or very similar  there like apple wins anyways 🤔
Android screen resolution matters much more than brightness to me. And I need emulation and only android has it for free. Not to mention all screen phones with complete customization. Android clearly wins unless you just go burrr I want phone to call and text burrr
On paper 12mp, but the sensor is world class build
If you thrive on piracy and cracker apps Android is the only choice
This feels rigged and biased
Android=freedom to choose good/bad decisions and get consequences to grow further based on those decisions  Iphone=strict mother telling u what to do and not to do thereby taking away all the fun 🗿
As usual very good video ❤ and by the way, are you going to the gym?
iPhone is the best
When android is better, it's a draw, when Apple is better, it's a win. This was dummer then i would expect from the to of you. Just stupid....
This is wrong
Two of the best creator in one frame ❤️
So no point for google assistant.
I'll always be a iPhone sucker. Can't stand android for many reasons.
I really have a problem with people comparing "Android" to "iPhone", you’re comparing many different phones against one. That hardly seems fair, that’s like comparing apples and oranges (no pun intended). Either do Android vs. iOS or pick one Android phone or brand vs. iPhone. You’re comparing an operating system to a phone. Shouldn’t tech channels know better than that?
Very biased video
Apple isn't even an option for me. I mean scanning pictures for what ever reason is just absolutely unacceptable. Not to mention all the anti consumer things they do. If Apple were a normal company their stuff would be amazing, but they're getting more and more like an evil cooperation straight out of a cyberpunk story. Wich is why they don't exist for me supporting that in any shape or form isn't morally acceptable for me.
Yum
Meh I think android should've won screen and software features...
This really is fun
14:28 The biggest thing that android has over iPhones is being able to use other app stores beside just one App Store.   And I wish they had a privacy features category.
This video is biased. They are comparing a brand doing hardware&software vs a software supported by a variety of brands. Go and compare Samsung vs Apple, but there are no valid comparisons because an android user can find the very best experience but iphone is all about compromises (and that's cool for the majority of apple users). So the idea of the video is pointless. Good seeing both Markes & Arun on the same project ! Big ups
I don't feel MKBHD a good person to go android vs iPhone. Anyways feels bad that new Huawei phones aren't even mentioned. They're great. I mean can definitely fight the iPhone.
I have a IPhone 13 pro max and it’s amazing if you can stomach paying the $1100 then it’s definitely worth it
iPhones have gotten better and better over the years that they now basically are able to target the general public. Before they had poor battery life, now they have the best in class. Their speakers before were weak but now, they got that covered too. The only thing that Android phone had over iPhones is pricing. Android is just all over the place and comes in different shades that people of many kinds can just pick. However, for general and gamers, iPhone is the better pick. Obviously.   Meanwhile, on Android, while you may have alot that you are able to do. Due to limitations, you are only able to do so much.  These words came from the mouth of an Android user.
*It seems like wearing shorts is not gonna be a cool idea to create a friendly vibe infront of MKBHD.*
Lmao what? Apple screen is not better than Samsung.
And there i was wishing for android to win
Loved the video, loved the collab, loved the timing! Thank you
The best way I could put it is like this. Android and Apple are both great for different reasons. For the past few years I’ve had the best of Android and Apple together. If someone were to blindfold me and give me the choice of picking one I’d be happy with either tbh….
I am an android user. But, what iPhone is doing with their phones is really really inspiring (except for their UI).
This video is just made to promote ios and apple 😅😅😅
Bro how is this comparison even fair, it’s one company versus an entire software company with hundreds of phones
Price matters baby 🤘 android
Sounds sponsered to me
I am an owner of both in the tablet category and by myself an android smartphone since the Motorola Milestone. On the tablet side i am split betwen both. But on the smartphone defenetlie Android. I tested the new Iphon 13 somthing frim my dougter for a week and for me it dosent come near to an android. Customaisabel (stting permisions without root/jailbreak) more mutitask capabel(5 instancestested)... But maybe i am to stupid to use the iphone the rigt way XD. So your decision.
Dent on the "DENT"
Buddy topic is good but q&a session is bad
I think iPhone sucks at capturing color in photos, the android is just a different level.
This video is : When iPhone users review Android phones
This was one of the smoothest episodes on this channel... Just loved it...Thanks Arun 👍
Have you guys observed how Google transitioned from bright colors to muted aesthetic pastel shades and Apple did just the opposite?
As a Android phone user it is delight to see Android phone pounded by iPhone. 😂
My 2 favorite tech YouTubers of ALL TIME! 🤩
To be honest this is a dating question…  You see the girl she is tall pretty and all, some will love that about her another will totally not be interested and might not like that.  So am just saying it’s all about perspective now these phones are so similar now it’s really hard to stand and say which is better than the other. It now just depends on your preference as a person.  My thought what you think?
Is it really a comparison when you're comparing just a  series of phone to a whole world of phones ranging from worst to best?
4:02 ROG PHONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Every time android should get a point they call it a draw
NAHH BROO.... we developers want kotlin / java(for Android) vs Swift / Objective-C (for iOS) don't we guys?
Photos on my iphone 13 pro max come out to be shitty...like very shitty and dark even in good lighting conditions
i still rather andriod
Plot twist: apple marketing video
Come on, You can't give the battery point to iPhone when they don't even sell the charger with the phone!!!!Also the charger alone creates more wastes than just keeping it in the box! Mrwhosetheboss made an entire video about it and still today gave the point (the environmental one) to iPhone. SURPRISED.
This is really pathetic. Clearly a hitpiece. Android does so much more than iOS. Apple wins in some categories sure, but screen? No way. Customisation? Def Android the winner there. All those apple "features" like FaceTime, ect, are bloody useless if your friends and family are not on Apple. And yes, being on the bleeding edge is desirable for a lot of people.   Pretty shitty troll video this, I think. Designed to get the maximum comments.
I like iphone and android but iPhones need better multitasking more ram  and support 3rd party softwares easier  if iPhones do that then iPhones are better  I mean androids are decent but isnt just me
Witch one is actually better, for you* I don't think I'd ever switch back to apple. I'm so deep into the echo system 10+ years now it's hard. And all my imitate family all samsung as well.  Galaxy s22 ultra  Galaxy book2 Galaxy buds+ Galaxy tablet  Galaxy smart tag Galaxy watch active 2
Android is far better then the ios in terms of value for money.
I just really like to think that they both have their pros and cons
I think privacy is worth mentioning here. Google tracks your every move, while Apple is more strict.
Let me guess mkbhd will want the iPhone to win
why the hell do ads buffer
Oh God this video going upset so many android fanboys...time to read the comments
???? What ever ??? Is apple the canera? No? But i world choose it hmmm 🤔
Linux is better
Avengers who? This is the most ambitious crossover lol
Not the tech youtubers comparing android to apple 😭
Sponsored by Apple
Is funny how this Iphone guy justify almost everything about iphone but picks every little detail about Android to complain about it.  The story of almost every people in the Apple world. I know is a really good phone but that guy not very objective when it comes to being neutral and say it as it is! Having a phone these days Is like being in a not that good relationship and making it "work" or not!  😄😄 For me Android is a no brainer, too many options that is better to  have and not need it that need it and not having it!! (That can make your life waay easier)
It’s obvious that MKBHD have special relations with apple .... Technically Samsung is by far the best phone because they know how to build a phone and how to build screens , iPhone on the other hand is made by somebody else.
that's totally iphone biased collab , MKBHD  just don't want to accept that android IS ACTUALLY BETTER IN PHOTOGRAPHY , SCREEN QUALITY , PRICING and he even don't consider fast charging as an necessary feature , and all this coming from a guy who don't even bother to mention about apple charging cable issues , which is off course very fragile and heck , iphones  now don't even include a charger , in his view apple is better because they are overpriced , plus sells an overpriced charger too .
I prefer android as I have 3rd party gadgets that works easier than with iPhone and android has more options and cheaper for me
It's because both like iOS android loses
On the topic of Airdrop, Nearby Share EXIST. I don't blame you for forgetting about it since GOOGLE NEVER ADVERTISE THE DAMN FEATURE SINCE IT'S RELEASE. But I was expecting you guys to somewhat remember that :( I guess google is just shite at promoting their own features despite being an advertising company
Why did they forget that iPhone has blue chat
MKBHD is bad guest for this.  he is basically an Apple guy now.
Marques is heavily i-phone biased. We needed a third party in this.
so basically these guys make such video everytime just to say iphone is better than Android
I'm shocked! The screen is a clear Samsung win =))
The galaxy s4 had lock screen widgets nearly 10 years ago
Hope both companies are watching and taking notes. Excellent work. You 2 are the best tech guys on YouTube. 👏🏽
Forgot (or maybe didn't...) about the cost to repair, let alone the right to repair. Android hands-down win. Knockoff parts aside, screen replacements are gravely expensive on iPhones. Having a device that can get updates for 5 or so years is fantastic, especially for those who hold onto their phone longer (40-50+ crowd), so iPhone is there. I've gone back and forth on either platform so my thoughts go up and down as time progresses.
Iphone vs android? That's comparing one company's physical product to a non-physical phone operating system...
How could you not talk about USB-C or audio processor?
If it would be up to me, I would choose more a good flagship android phone for my everyday, and if I need such things as facetime, or airdrop, I would rather get an ipad for that matter lmao
Have you noticed how MKBHD is in black and then MrWTB is white?  then he just slaps on that short like nothing matters 🤣🤣🤣🙆🏿‍♂️
Technically Android wins every category since there is always an Android phone that does a particular things best.
Just a key note- Most of the Android users dont even look at the lock screen(because of the fingerprint). We just open up  to home screen. Actually lock screen widget for IOS users makes sense, because lot of the time they are stuck at lock screen!
Alright, so with the iPhone, there’s a lot of things it can do that android just couldn’t match, Performance, Cameras, and essential apps. Android is a great phone business but when you put up an S22 Ultra with an iPhone 13 Pro Max the iPhone will beat it in every category battery, screens, performance, screen brightness and the camera, so when you think about the score is accurate. iPhone is just better than a Android.
No offence but MKBHD is deciding the winner in each category and its the iPhone 😂
Or just have both android and iPhone. Living the best world
It is based on our requirements
Loved this, Love you both. Keep it up!!!
I really enjoyed it but it wasn't fair for Android,I mean apple has worked their way up but Android has so many qualities that are actually better then the apple. In this video you only used s22 ultra which an android phone but you are talking about whole 'Android' that doesn't cut it!!
Air drop is a thing yeah but android been have wifi-direct
For the easy to use, go to apple, for customizability, go to android (I don't know if Samsung is still android tho
You can see a clear bias from Marquis towards Apple in this video. 😒😒😒
I'm sorry guys but this felt a lot more of an iPhone ad than as a fair comparison. Android has a lot of better features than iPhone and you just cherry picked the ones on iPhone. I've always loved your videos but this time not so much. Loved the collab BTW xD
It’s not a matter of preference. It is Android. We buy phone not just for looks. Phone is a device which reduces human efforts. By effort means doing things smoothly as per own need. In that sense Android is way ahead to allow you to change things according to your own need.
Arun's voice is just naturally ASMR. I used to think it's about the mic he uses, but now I think it's just natural.
It's really hard to choose.. 😂😂... It is at its best in its own way!!.. . That's what I think..
Just a fun game just like if u are android and comment if u are ios.
I find this video a bit weird. Like how they took in consideration all the bad things about android but it is a huge umbrella. I think you go best that android has to offer vs apple. Like there are so many android phones with a bigger battery than iphone and also has much better fast charging. So iphone won because a lot of android phones have a little bit less battery???? Doesnt make sense to me. What are we even comparing here
Wow 2.5 for android.. Imagine that ?!
iPhone pretty much wins for the overall experience. Individual androids beat it in individual aspects. But iPhone focuses more on the overall experience where whatever it offers is useful and above average. Android phones are more fun for shorter terms.
No offense but alot of things are being left out on the android side im not a hater of aron’s videos I genuinely like them and thats my thoughts and this genuinely fells more like and iphone ad no offence
I love your videos!!!
Marques definitely went for a follow-up cool dude finger grab with that handshake 20:00 and its was totally missed by Arun :D
Am an android user so yeah ill be bias
Totally scripted and supporting/target the iPhone user because usa/euorpion country have high level prejudice between classes upper and lower that is the make reason they fear about losing subscriber if he refuse iphone customer
Everything u told was right but expect the customisation. U guys think customisation of ios is on par with Android Just with the lock screen.
Omg Aron I can’t stop watching your videos download I check every day to see if you have posted please post more often
A Android with root is always the winner. I'm the owner and i decide what to do and not the system or the company (apple)
So this isn't which one is ACTUALLY better. It's just the preference of two youtubers.
Idk your mental health
MKBHD has a  Apple Biased ... Its not that big of a difference .. Every-time android is better its a tie and iPhone is slightly better then its a full point LOL
Unbelievable video
LET THE TRASH IN THE COMMENTS BEGIN!!!!
I would not call it a smartphone plateau, but I only upgrade to the latest phone when the old one stops getting updates.
Do asus vs red magic with the best gaming phone
I like both of you great job
Fun fact: they were actually there to be featured in Mark Robers new vid!
Android, easily
🤣🤣
Best phone s22 ultra...best tablet s8 ultra....these 2 r apple fan boys ...trust me they r biast towards android.....sorry Crapple....most of these  reviews r so biast it's unbelievable...and if u pay attention iOS is becoming android....over priced Crapple....and by the way I have both android and apple.....I have incountred constant problems with Crapple as much as android...I'm not hating as both have good points ....but apple is taking pricing to stupid levels....
Cool video. Thanks!  I am a former android user, specially the Nexus family for context. What eventually moved me away was the overwhelming amount of modification and customization.  I noticed more and more that when I customized/mod’ed/etc., the amount of maintenance I had to do got old. Thankfully android has matured and the “need” to mod is not as strong, but not enough to bring me back so far.
Airdrop has got to be my most used feature
When its comes to Andriod, MKBHD never fails to Disappoint us.
im a 100% in Andorid, but i have to say, im not a fan of Samsung either... what many people forget is, that there are so much more great Andorid devices than just Samsung... last Years, Oneplus had great Software, unfortunately there are suffering cause of oppo, at the Moment, just softwarewise Pixel or Motorola are the best. OC thats all my personal oppinion
Apple isn't in the same universe as Android when it comes to customization. How is this even a question??
"Wants to know what time it is" Checks whatever he checked on the right side of the screen with 5 phones right in front of him, a few of them being on. (Im just messin btw...Loved this collab, awesome vid to watch)
Another aspect that i think this discussion missed is cybersecurity. Android is somewhat less secure especially with older people that sometimes downloaded spyware apk apps to their phone. With iphone problem such as this wouldn't happen. Although personally i do prefer android though😄
lmao
For me the choice is based on the softwares that I use and have become so accustomed to. That makes it really difficult to switch to IoS however good a hardware they have.  Android software gives you so much choices and flexibility but IoS is always trying to lock you in.
Who else notice him playing genshin no one just me alrighty
I used to love android because of its customizations but as I got older I just want things to work and that’s why I ended up loving iOS… and it is true that once you’ve experienced the ecosystem it is hard to leave. Everything just works well with other apple devices.
Currently, I own an iPhone. And I do not understand the concept of multi tasking in iPhones. The moment is swipe up, all my copying processing downloading in apps like safari, readdle documents stops. Even, when transferring files to pc using wire, the transfer stops after the screen goes dark. While downloading files from google drive or any other source, i am forced to stay in that app.  Cant browse other apps while that file is being downloaded.  Then, I am used to keep track of speed and amount in (K, M, G)bytes of file being downloaded. But this only shows percentage.   All apps stay in suspended state in background. I do not know if there is a concept of apps as a background services or not. If anyone knows, if this is an issue with my unit only, kindly suggest fixes.  Soon, going back to android. Waiting for pixel 6a,  galaxy s22 fe.
Collab of the year!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Bias Mkbhd
Apple smacked android once again
This collab  is so great we need more vid we MKBHD
Ignoring the video noticing how Arun wipes the samsung’s camera with his WHITE t-shirt… 18:10
After ios 16 apple is officially better than Android
I prefer Apple and yes I switched  Reasons why I switched is iOS is much smoother more optimized the apps are smoother  And when it comes in terms of customization iOS 16 is taking over, I don’t really care anymore about it but iPhone is taking over with it I like how it’s simple and gives something  And the notch isn’t a big deal it’s for Face ID and to split the control center and Lock Screen 3:08  He makes a good point there Using an xr and it still feels smooth and fast Also I rather have Al day battery life and trash charging speeds because I’m not degrading it with a fast charger
I mean android has snap drop
is this an ad for the iphone? lame
" Value is very much up to what you care about " - MKBHD
Idk about others but for me Android is way better to have. It supports more apps, charges faster, more customization, very easy and cheap to repair, and costs a lot lesser. iPhones are fine but lack many features you get from androids and definitely are not budget-friendly.
After balancing the levels on both: Ios and android, Ios is for those who are not in the situation to kinda play... iPhones are for people who are more mature whereas android, as you said, is a toy for perhaps those who kinda like to play. I would go for an iPhone, coz its for mature people...
Omg, first point and im already cringing. The refresh rate on iphone is THE SAME or worse as samsung BECAUSE SAMSUNG MAKES THE BLEEDING THINGS. This is so biased to iphone it actually annoys me.
byebye samsung till they fixed their battery life. iphone 14 pro here i come

Me wanting android to win while watching it on an iPhone
Can't say I agree with any of the points made about things like facetime and imessage. If you live anywhere that isn't the US or UK, imessage usually becomes close to worthless because nobody uses it. Also for imessage they could just use a more open system like rcs so everyone could communicate with each other but they choose not to. Instead everyone thinks android doesn't have an imessage like experience while it definitely does.
Now do it with linus tech
You both should do a channel together where you talk about stuff
Two great reviewers in the same place at the same time....doesn't get any better than that!!!
actually iphone has worst charging sysytm , time and  battery life really
I didn't enjoy anything because it was only based on his personal preferences , he didn't try to show all good aspects on each !! Sometimes  he's okay with the less he got and got a point while he don't even know how many different he could get if he didn't lock up his mind on his comfort zone !! That's not a fair judgement , I've used both phone and I know what I'm talking about !! For someone whose deciding for a new phone or probably his first phone ,that video is strait a boycott to android !! Just saying
Sorry bro ur content is not trust worthy anymore. u just give out points for iphones
Mkbhd was so biased against Android!
"Lock screen widgets better on iPhone" that's where MKBHD showed. He's Apple fanboy. Just retard comparison 😂😂
People here arguing which one is better than the other and me here would be just happy to have either of the one
when you realise apple built a company from stealing android's ideas
apple airdrop = androids quick share facetime = idk? U can call literally everywhere. Messenger, Instagram, Google duo?? There's so much
Only reason I bought an Iphone and got rid of my samsung was because of security reasons, other than that, my samsung did everything i needed it to
I think your score is accurate if you take Android in general vs the iPhone.  But when you compare the S22 ultra vs iPhone (A specific android phone to the iPhone), the score would be more balanced rather than shifting heavily in either direction.
How about normal mp3 transfer ??? That matters to alot of android people. Something iphone cannot do
Straight up not agree to this comparison
I can play ps2 on my ZFold how can you even compare I would throw the Iphone a way it is not even a smart phone Its a Nokia brick with a fancy camera
Marquees wants to talk about the San Antonio Spurs and the Phoenix Suns whenever he's talking about boring 😂😂
iPhone still wins by 5
I think there is injustice for Android in this video.
Damn daniel
Worst Review Ever.
iPhone still wins by 5
Switched from the 13 pro max to the s22 ultra its all the same really
For me Android is better because it just feels easier and simple to work around around and there are many features the IPhone just lacks. For example on the iPhone is just impossible to use your Wi-Fi and hotspot at the same time, meanwhile with the Android it’s a cool feature
well everyone knows if you ask mr brown he will always say the iPhone is the best in class . I have used both and i think iphone is good at the efficient battery and RAM use for the rest any other phone is better. lol
You cant ignore how consistent iPhones actually are or in fact apple products are
U guys comparing iphone 13 pro max with different android phones? Why the video description shows different?
You know the android World is doing wonders,  by this two coming together to compare them with iPhone,Funny how Marques uses S21 ultra for a year and half and still  chooses iPhone in most cases, Strange!!
Ok why mkbhd gives most of the points to iphone BUT uses samsung for a year and a half???
This vs is biased. It's obvious that iPhone was in your every topic no matter if Android is better. Wtf the edge of iPhone feels better? IPhone is just a waste of money for outdated hardware.
This video is shot on iPhone 😎😎
I'm so disappointed,  it was so biased In display , software features Android wins easily, in battery galaxy a31 (200$) beats iPhone 13 pro max.. This was so wrong in so many categories
Nice
They said everything that was on my mind. Android users used to laugh at iphone users but ios is really good right now. I use both and i can say that ios is so much better than it used to be. Same as windows for pc, windows was crap and needed a lot of third party software to make it better. Nowadays, windows at install is pretty much ready to do anything except the need to use third party software to install drivers but i think microsoft might be working on that too. I feel like android, being customisable is great but at the same it can be a problem. You need to install a lot of thing to make it better.
Why iphone vs Android is an os not a phone...
Windows is best ,still using lumia without any bloatware , social media app , secure s hell , no one can hack it thats why i still use it nowadays as my primary device .secondary device is offcourse rooted android device for everything.
This test seems REALLY unfair, the display, Androids a clear winner. "They both soo good ,it's a slightly better,u cant tell the difference, well call it a draw" AWH HELL NA, the performance is also "cant tell the difference AND gamig phones have certain features like triggers and fans and RGB and stuff.
when the other boss shows up
What phone did you use to record the last part? Android or Iphone?
You made me buy the s21 ultra with an exynos chip, and i lost half of my money because of that.. nobody should trust you man!!!
how much tim cook gave you aron. unsubscribe .
is he apple fan ?
A negative point on the eco-friendliness of Apple is that they are strongly anti-repair. They make it near impossible to repair, even with the Apple care program. It's just to silence the Right to Repair movement.  Edit: By the Apple care I meant that Self repair service they launched. I'm talking about that. You don't need to remind me on every one of the 50 comments.
This is more of their opinion,than of the majority
Me: when the score became 1-6🤤
I use both systems daily.
This was great video, however I think that most stuff about best phones of 2022 was already said in one of your previsious video where you picked best phones from each category  It really depend on presonal preference, I prefer Xiaomi/POCO because it's reliable, low price, great power for games and uses MIUI where you gave sort of "air drop" called MI share  I helps me to transfer photos and files between new and old phone quickly
When they talked about Siri my video paused and that coloured ball popped up…
Love both of you but this is a flawed and futile exercise. Comparing a phone(s)/phone maker with a solid hardware-software ecosystem with basically just a software installed on several thousand types of phones makes zero sense.
One of the greatest collaborations
Android rules!!
iOS for secure data but less customisation and android for less privacy but more customisation
In my opinion, iPhone is boring, but really stable and basic. Android is more fun, and make it like only one for you. So I think it depends on people that who want more fun one or more stable and basic one.  Also Android has similar feature call nearby share, which is almost same as a Airdrop so I think that will be tie.
When they talked about Siri my video paused and that coloured ball popped up…
Wow what a waste of 20 minutes of my time. I stopped following these two for the last couple of years and then this video popped in my notifications... Utter nonsense.
I love both of your channels. Great video. I'm sad to say that I choose iPhone but only because of its security and reliability. thanks guys

Ambos son Buenos.! Ninguno es perfecto...

Want a device that can boot both as android and IOS. Possible ?🤔
I replaced my Samsung for an iPhone. A decision I regret - with a few exceptions, the Samsung was much better. I can’t take this review seriously. For starters, the Samsung display is far superior to the iPhone.
If u buy an android phone it is yours If u buy an iPhone it is yours (owned by Apple)
They should've done iPhone vs (A specific android phone company), because if it were Samsung vs iPhone then Samsung would have a good chance. All the other phones bring them down. And some Android phone companies don't care about the look or battery
Some android phones are pretty lame but Samsung do produce better phones than most android companies it should be android vrs iPhone
MKBHD initially sounded like a defender of the iPhone, but eventually, he was more reasonable about it. MWB on the other hand was always clear on what he wanted and why.
Are things that Apple locks you in really worth calling "features"? I think Android should win this category, simply because it is much more flexible than Android and allows you to do a lot more things. For example: * changing many parts of the OS, like the launcher, keyboard, browser, lock screen * installing apps from outside the Play Store * full access to the file system * use it to do things you would traditionally do on a computer. You can do crazy things like coding, running all kinds of VMs and emulators. You can do all sorts of crazy automation with things like Tasker, like automatically opening the garage door when a message that contains a certain thing arrives.   Android is more like "here's a set of tools that you can use to do whatever you want". iOS is more like "these are the things you're allowed to do and how you can do them".
Biggest Takeaway for me is both of them are using Samsung Android phones and rate iPhone better. I prefer Android.
screen goes clearly to android
Jesus Christ it's so simple, why do people make this so complicated? If you have some money burning a hole in your pocket, just get an iphone. If you don't, buy a midrange (<$600) android.
Watching on my iPhone 13 Pro 128GB 6GB RAM fully paid.
Sure bud.🤣
IDK. How is making phones with slave labor good for the environment?
Really liked this, considered arguments when summing up,  although like everyone else I am sure, I disagreed with some points, but good vid to watch. Genuinely surprised Iphone got the camera and video over Android's phones, considering some of the Sony phones. Disagree with the software purely cos I like open architecture. Android things I still look for,  Battery replacement, headphones jack, universal charging connector and most importantly expansion slot.  I can have 512GB card in my Android, for a few £'s, going up to 1TB.  Iphone you are talking silly money for a 512GB phone, and that is onboard, not expansion.
I like how he's asking an American abt it, it's like he's gonna answer yeah I like android to do imessage or facetime 🤦🏻‍♂️
I prefer this style of video WAY more than the extremely excited adhd screaming vids
I personally think this video is just mkbhd fan boying iphone in general! we know display and software features were of top class in android(s22 ultra)
Love this collab! Hope you two do more together!
I use both Android &iPhone. Samsung's display is the best. iPhone has more reliable software. These 2 rounds shouldn't have been a tie from my perspective
It should be iPhone vrs samsung
My two fav tech youtubers together! woohoo 🥳
almost like the video was sponsored by Apple and they paid 100.000.000 dollars to say  " Apples the best "
For younger generations I think apple is definitely taking more pie. Im Korean hometown of Samsung Galaxy but more and more people in their 10 or 20 are switching to Iphone and tends to stay that way
I feel like they shouldnt be comparing everything with the pro max as the pro max is increddibly expensive and most android are cheaper by a margin so of course iPhone will win in some
How much did Apple pay you 2
I AM UN SUBSCRIBING THIS CANNEL.IF ONE MORE BIASED VID COME OUT
You guys said s22 ultra screen is better in every aspect then you talked about the side which is the design of the phone which should be a different category but then you gave apple a .5 and the Samsung a .5 even tho it was a screen category? A little confused there😂 but anyways I love your content guys!!
I don't get it's an entirely fair comparison. You're talking into account midmarket Android phones for fails, but when the high end does it better than the iPhone it's a draw.
On my lunch break 😃😃 watching two guys talk about things I can't afford
The shock when Arun realised it could be a tie
Android got destroyed 😂. Thank GOD I have both. I only enjoy customization on my android and game emulators.
I thought they were comparing the os features from the title
My little brothers name is Jesus (Spanish) and every time I call his name, Siri answers. And every time I say “Siri” Siri never answers the first time.
Love the colab
Whoa Is the old Arun back?? This vid felt so much like your earlier videos without unnecessary flashy editing and jokes/skits This is making me oddly emotional Great to have ya back boss
This video was so predictable from the first minute. Especially since it features two iPhone lovers. You should do one with someone that daily drives an android like Linus or JerryRigEverything
The collab we all needed! You both are awesome!
apple very expemsive androids cheap boom we have a winner { plus apple requiers you tob uy everything by youraelf the charger the ipod and everything and claim its for quete queto environment hmmmp stupid this itself proves androids better bya million

15:57
MKBHD probably received a hefty sum from apple for blabbering these biased reviews. Camera in samsung is way better than iphone . Overall looks and feels of samsung can crush iphone to smitherins and what in world was "Pixel dont save photos"
Video gets a dislike iphone sucks too many restrictions android is much better ....bullshit verdict
Both agree iPhones are better... Both actually use Androids for every day 🤣 the biggest issue I have with Apple products is how they don't work with anything other than Apple products, despite how good some of the latest tech Apple has to offer, so for me Android all the way. Some of us don't want Apple everything in our lives... Not to mention the amount of proprietary things Apple insist on using, not very consumer friendly imo...
iphone is a good phone but android phones especially the flagships are laptops everything is easier on Android from sharing wifi passwords to using them for work instead of a laptop. I feel way more comfortable traveling to other countries carrying my Android phone than my iPhone.
so basically a full video where android get roasted 🤣😂
Photos is kinda bias just a bit tho
I would like to see comparison between ip 8/10 and top android phone from same year, because almost everyone think that android after years get laggy and iphone is as smooth as it come from a box.
On price you put a drawn??? You Crazy guys, i cant buy a iPhone!! Its too expansíve!!
How can you claim to be tech bros and you don't use split screen
For all draws its pretty much Android, seems there was an edge, especially on screen. Plus it was sold at the end there with the fumble.
Apple Eco friendly? Kidding me? Govind the score based on their future plan is lame. Apple is the reason for non removable batteries, no head phone jack and not opting to typeC. All these things leads to extra packaging and reusability. And Apple is the worst when it comes to repair ability
This debate is so biased. Everybody will simply side with the Phone company that they own. Humans don’t willingly accept the possibility that they’re wrong about their choices. Instead we simply stand by our choices to cope with the agonizing regret of making the wrong one. Somebody who got an android will stand by that choice as a brain defense mechanism to protect itself from the regret of making the wrong choice. The exact same principle applies to Apple users but I don’t want to directly repeat it to be repetitive and I’m just to lazy.
I rarely dislike videos but this score seems to give benifit of doubt to the iPhone a lot. The iPhone is one of the best all rounders but against all of the androids available today there is a phone that wins nearly every catagory. Batterey:ROG Camera: no mention of Sony or huawei or xiaomi  Speakers: ROG Sound: you have Android based digital audio players or LG Screen:sony or Samsung Features:I would give it to android as there is an app that covers almost all the apple exclusives plus any other weird neash I'm looking for  There aren't many android phones that beat iPhone in every catagory but many come close.: what about xiaomi I'm not saying that android should win, even as an android user, but that list I personally think, doesn't fully represent what android is capable of
attempt by apple to sell iphone 13 for the 2nd time
Another thing is accessibility. Even cheaper iPhones are too expensive for many people in 3rd world countries, so the budget options from Android wins
It comes down to this. If you want more customizable features and are more techy, then get android. If you want simple and are less techy and just want basic features then get a iphone.
Kbhd iphone is better but i been using android last year and half. ???
is anyone getting emojis reactions in the comments
Passion fruit is better than Both iPhone and Android
Cool to see how much y’all respect one another. Both as content creators and human beings.   Great video.
Pixel phone is doing great...but iPhone is superior in every way ✨
used both. but for now I prefer ios because it nails all the basics. all I need is messaging, camera and social medias
I thought FaceTime works on non Apple devices too now? (You send a link from the Apple device to the other device).
I'm sorry, you guys can't be taken seriously anymore. Especially Marques seems to be totally out of order twisting and bending every bit while android is clearly in the lead, you guys still give it to apple. Sad to see that you both have lost it
"The most boring team to watch is often the best one."  holy mother
What's the primary job of cell phone. ??? I believe it's making calls but you guys only talk about processor and camera but not quality of phone call...why is that
iPhone is better than Android phones a whole, but the best thing about android is that its present on a huge variety of phones while iPhone is just one. Asus beats iPhone in gaming, So many Camera focused phones beat iPhone in just the photography section, etc. So even though iPhone beats Android in an overall comparison, individual brands beat iPhone if the user chooses to focus on one category. And just a personal opinion  --  Samsung is better than iPhone even if Apple is better than Android
MKBHD wanted a chop knuckle
MKBHD 🥹😇🤩🤩 and MRWHOSETHEBOSS😇😇🔥🥳
MAKE A VIDEO ON HUAWEI AND HARMONY OS
"It's a whole year old"
Well, you two have massively lost credibility in my eyes.
One of the dumbest bias videos I have ever seen, it's so obvious apple is paying for this.
I use iphone I agree on most of these but battery for iphone? really?
MKBHD is an Apple schrill.   Even when the Android beat the iPhone, he was still choosing the iPhone for some other reason. How much was he paid by Apple? Android phones are simply better IMO that iPhones.
as a power user and big user of custom roms and root mods (yes in 2022) I will stick with android... especially the ones that does not lock me in...
Everything is great but the only thing that I a little not agree with that is that they are comparing a 2021 iPhone to 2022 androids
Sorry man i had to dislike bias.
For my needs ios just works better for me. I have various medical devices that I wear and are linked with my phone. It’s so much easier to set up and are much more reliable on ios.
9:46 really bud? Apple is good for the planet? The company that introduced not  adding chargers in the box? Therefore you buy another charger causing more carbon pollution in shipping and packaging. Sure, they wan to "save the planet". Definitely not to sell the charger separately. From the company that brought to you the 20 dollar wiping cloth🤣. Sure bud, your bias is showing throughout the whole video.
Im here because of thumbnail 😂
its kinda wierd watching this video feels like watching worldcup finals .😆
Mk is biased towards iPhone
Where does the Tesla-Pi-phone stand?
PASSIONFRUIT!! 😂
Im thinking of getting a Samsung Burner Phone tbh
OMG, who put MKBHD on gunpoint  He looks dead in this video.
Android gang: *Emotional Damage*
Too many bogus categories. Too much scoring for subjective crap. The crapple sponsor this crap? And taking the average of subjective crap... really. Want kind of BS evaluation is that? And Samsung's crap is way too overweighted and over represented. Samsung is not Android and nor is Pixel android either. There was no category for things like choice, mods, hacks, right to repair, or freedom.
This *Duo*' s doing amazing yar took this Tech explaining world to next level bravo ❤️
Didn't put the rickroll
this is so bias
I want to try an iPhone again. I have a terrible experience with iPhones coz honestly, I can confidently say they seem to work well in other countries, but in a small country like mine, they work terribly. The last iPhone I used was XS Max. I wanna try the new ones
Samsung galaxy has a better screen display than iphone
Bro Marques is definitely on apple's pocket 😂 jk jk
Thinking about it
I like apple but won't buy it for this reasons No Truecaller support  No call recording No side loading No deep apps community like for kgwt , rooting etc  Apple is very good for an average andy  Im not an average andy 💀
Hey Arun, how are you? Because you sound like you either haven't slept or are Ill. Hope you're fine.
I think it depends on our own perspective, I personally would prefer Android all day, for the customization and ease of use..
Your shaved legs look ridiculous dude. At least they match your voice.
From my understanding, the Pixel 6 is getting 5 years of updates like the iPhone
Why they draw when android tends to win😑
MKBHD is an apple fanboy for sure
Has nothing to do with the phones it has everything to do with the user.  Same with Computers and OS systems.   it is true with just about every tool.  Everyone has their own prefs, And that is what matters.
Is markez ok , he sounds depressed compared to how he usual speaks
This is more like let me tell you how good is apple😌.
I'm in the Android camp. That's MY choice. My current choice is a Note 20 Ultra. My oldest son has an iPhone, not because he likes it, but because he likes the Apple watch. Otherwise, he'd still be using his Note. Go figure. I've tried an iPhone, and was shocked because of the huge amount of random music that Apple decided I wanted on it. Just because I have hundreds of gigabytes of music doesn't mean I want to hear a bunch of it on my phone. Especially when that's NOT what I want to use it for. :/ Plus, it decided to reorganize my music in ways that I DIDN'T want to be organized. Nor was I happy that iTunes firmly wanted a grip on my music. Also the fact that the .MP3s I had for notifications wouldn't work without being converted to .M4As (or whatever it was) really didn't excite me. Pay Apple for music that I had already owned to get it in the right format? That was a big NO! Now that was probably a decade ago, so that's seriously dated, but I'm not willing to see if Apple has improved anything. I don't own any Apple products, I build my own PCs, and I'm not a fan of the walled garden that Apple has in place. And yes, I'm an old fart. :p
Apple ‘cause of the ecosystem
Screen, photography, software features are clear Android Wins... iMessage and Facetime are not features, there are comparable apps on Android that are better and don't lock you in the apple ecosystem.
Is it just me or is Marques sounding like a teenage girl? 😂
Samsung makes sense only if you change phones often, otherwise you get stuck with an older Android, that probably even when new wasn’t quite as good as the iOS.
I normally like both guys but this video was bs. You can't tell me that apple is better in everything. Also whenever it was better on Android, they would look foor excuses for apple and call it a draw. I don't care who wins but the results should be closer
I guessed this outcome at the beginning of the video itself when I saw  feat. MKBHD. I know he is an iPhone fanboy and that reflected in this video too. In every category of discussion he raises his hand to uphold the iPhone's legacy. Dude take for instance,the display category, he is taking into account only the 13 pro display which is already a downgraded version of s22 ultra and then he wants to compare 13 pro to budget Android displays where he's completely forgetting there are budget iPhones with IPS LCD display. This is pointless
The Problem with MKBHD's photo answer is that you can take photos with default camera app and then add it to the app you want .
iPhones are just superior in every aspect that matters. They are so above the androcrap that it shouldn’t even be a debate about which is better. iOS is and will always be the gold standard.
You  could have cut the video to 30 seconds, and just say the iphone.
The result of the battle is biased af, especially in photography. But opinions opinions. I'm watching the video cause I love the chemistry between you guys.
Biased af
Why are they BEHAVING??
I think what sums it up is that there may be an Android phone that excels in one particular field like in camera or in battery or in zoom or in gaming but there is no phone that excels in almost every field equally but that is not the case with iPhone
nearby share is the airdrop on android devices with more options
Even though the conversation was OK (kind of forced and bordering boring, imo), MKBHD looked bored most of the time. I did not see the excitement on his face too often.
make best web browsers
The fight doesn’t end here though to be fair
So what type of persona you are? MKBHD or Arun? 🤔🤔
I love both of you
Wow Arun, the stupidiest video ever made. Why the hell would you ask these questions to apple's dog ? He would counter an iphone se against Samsung s22 ultra and call apple a winner . . What rubbish . . Hes trying to sound logical but its absurd too . .
can u play nds games on iPhone?
To me android wins just because ios handicaps everyone not using apple things, while android doesn't care what brand of tech you and your friends use
mkbhd is very biased towards iphone but  but mrwhose theboss is not biased..
and i thought it would be Android and iOS 😢😢😢
Tell me about it, Real Madrid 🥱🤮
I can't help but notice that Marques has strong solid opinions, and Arun opens up with a statement and then after Marques is done, he starts to rethink his perception. I don't think it's the actually validity of the points, rather the confidence and certainty of the opinions. Does anybody else see this or is it just me?
i’ve been using android since 2012 with several “flagship phone” e.g. galaxy note 2, 1+1, galaxy s7 and recently switching to ios, iphone +ipad they are miles better in terms of smoothness and user experience
Meh. This was pointless
android 100% i know iphone has some crazy stats, but its not fair to compare iphone (hard and soft ware) with android (software) then throw up some examples of hardware, maybe next time make a top 10 hardware or a top 10 software, then you can trully see an apple to apple comparisson
The wording of the questions kinda bias
Good Display Good Battery Good cameras Good processor Which can do my work at low price? I think it's Android.
So, I guess you both are into the iphone. 😂
the samsung display is just better than the iphone diplay.... why a draw then?
now i can send this video to every apple hater and tell them that they cant compare it with android
Was this entire interview shot on a phone?
Arun fan boying over every line marques says😂
I only had an iPhone for a year.  It was a 12 Pro, so no 120hz refresh.  I moved back to Android because I was bored. Having the Pixel 6 Pro for 9 months, I now appreciate iOS. I miss the easy camera, snappy everything, apps always working & being better versions of their Android counterparts,  the way the battery charges & its longevity, Apple support, the mute slider, & everything just generally working how it's supposed to work.  Things I don't miss are lack of customization, Settings being an app, some settings being hidden or in odd places, how Apple handles notifications, Siri, no YouTube PiP,  and not being able to use most of the Apple exclusive features because no one I know owns an iPhone. I use Google assistant multiple times a day.  I used Siri often, but it usually was twice the work as it wouldn't understand me or couldn't get the results I wanted. After my 2 years with my Pixel are up, I'll either go back to Samsung or try iPhone again. The iPhone 15 will be a new design, but I doubt Siri or customization will have improved at all. The determining factors will be whatever irritates me more at the time of purchase.
I switched to the iPhone 13 pro last week. This is my first ever iPhone in my 27 years of existence. I must say it is quite refreshing to change and the app optimizations are drastically better than on android. I still love android but I’m happy I switched right now.
Imagine if Samsung or Google went for a phone design scheme like that of the Fairphone, making later upgrades and user repairs possible, while avoiding the problem of limited battery life with replaceable batteries. This would completely change the market and be a long term winner...
Thing i like in Android : Retro emulator Samsung Dex Easy to use Customization (good lock for example)  Camera features (like zoom in S22 Ultra more than 10x zoom) Sideload Apps
isn't the bottom line in this is that  BOTH are same level on hardware. but apple clearly wins with software.  software is the issue on android no matter how out of this earth level of hardware they have it always bottlenecks at software.  if they manage to crack their brains  and use it 100% , android will win in every aspect   just take iPhone XR / XS  it beats every single LATEST mid range up to this day  in how smooth and better the experience is.   go with android and in a year it will slow down and crack you up how annoyingly it is. you can't even argue with it because they will just say about stupid enough when in truth they just don't OPTIMIZE android.   go with apple, slap their board of directors when they intentionally slow down the iPhones then they revert it, you get a fast phone again.
20:05 😂
If they used the best android for each category then android would slam with 7.5 to 2.5 for iphone lol
Interesting comparison. I don't really disagree but would have been nice to see discussion on folding phones, s pens, etc. for features iphones don't address that define the experience for alot of people.
MKBHDs face expression feels like the MrBoss has bad breath issues.
What about repairability? No one talked about it. Android takes the win.  Always on display, pin on screen, screen crop and side panel on samsung phones.  Android takes the win. I feel mrwhosetheboss was biased since mkbhd was the guest.
kinda changed my POV on the 2 phones
You have been biased, how can you consider the features which are still under development, they are not launched to the public yet, like customization in IOS 16
Please compare the camera betwee s22 ultra vs Vivo x80 pro..who is camera king
android = open source enough said . i am not restricted to anything , unlike ios .
I was not a big fan of mkbhd before this video but now i think he’s very mindful person like he knows well what he talks about fr . ☺️
This only apply to android on HIGH END DEVICE ONLY
I disagree hugely with this when it comes to cameras....I own both the iphone 13 Pro Max and s22 Ultra and taking side by side photos and videos to me the s22 Ultra obviously looks better like 95% of the time.?? Especially in video the iphone doesn't stand a CHANCE. To me this video just sounds like 2 people who get paid to talk and say things lmao
Aww Marques’ shyness was very visible this time around. I don’t know if he was just tired or stars-struck or both 😆
This collaboration is the best one i've ever seen
Annoying answer, but it depends the person really. Apple is kinder to a more passive user, but restricts some Customisation. It may be simpler (in some ways) but in comparison to thinks like Microsoft Bob back in the day it still takes some brainpower. Android is more for a user that really takes time with there phone, wants to customise or just generally wants android. Android also takes the basis of can go with anything - cheap phones, expensive phones and the like. iOS and apple, exclusive - you gotta go for it or go home.
I still love Android . I love to be free.
There are android phones that shits on apples battery.
Regarding eco-consciousness I think a point to be considered is how long people usually keep their phones, and if they are recycled more. I'd say iPhone users typically keep their phones for longer given the high price point and longevity. I don't know if Android phones have an active trade-in program but Apple does and recycles parts from old phones. I think these also contribute to their eco-concsious score.
Android is a software, iphone is a device, it seem someone should explain that to most tech YouTubers before they made this video
For recycling, you missed that Apple has a device that can deconstruct any phone and separate out all it's pieces for recycling.  The machine does this in 20-30 seconds, and works for any Apple Phone/iTouch device.  That's a big deal.
4:58 Arun out of context: I effectively had a 24 hour day
Android features don't seem as important to ios users until they actually get to use on an iPhone
Here's my take on it, If your gonna compare android and IOS/ iphones. They should have stick to flagships on the same price bracket on the android side cuz if you generalize android including mid range and budget ones, we all know it's not gonna be good for the android side. Its just like what mkbhd said "rog phone 5 at 60hz has better battery life but it's the only one phone in the sea of androids."
Always Android 💪
Multitasking goes to the iPhone???? Are you serious???????
Isn’t it Crazy How IPhone Is Going against Android (All Android)  Respect😌🧡
For me there's only one factor and that's pricing
As an environmental consultant I must say that the most eco friendly product is the one that last the most and the one that can be used for more people before It’s discarded or recycled… so , considering the updates span , the iPhone is still the winner here, I hope it doesn’t changes with iOS 16 and 17
Didn't know that Mkbhd was an apple fan
Android have better screen, better feature and apps like tasker ,emulation, yt vanced ,torrent, launcher,modded apps , so much stuffs that makes it better and  these biased apple fanboys cant clearly see that.
Neither of the phones deserve a point for eco. They took everything out of the box forcing people to buy a new charger/wire/headphones, which each come in their own boxes. So the phones have made it worse, but padded their own pockets at the same time!
I like the colab of your discussion but I also feel there should have been more arguments. There are a ton more phones than Samsung for Android. Huawei, xiaomi, Vivo, Sony, pixel and oneplus bring something new to the table. Androids open-source nature provides the path towards innovation iphone lacks. The modding community brought so many changes most users would never know about...flashlight feature, themes, bloatware removal,  overclocking and undervolting, and mobile Hotspot to name a few.  Superamoled screens look brighter and more vivid as do Huawei's.  You didn't add a lot of positive points for Android either when clear winners in categories were for the green team.  Also never had a photo not save, ever.
This seemed less like iphone vs Android and more like Apple vs Samsung, the beauty of Android is to give people the ability to specialize into the smartphone that caters to them the most and you could probably find a Android phone for each category that beats apple, it's just that apple is just more consistent overall as it's ment to be as accessible as possible. I don't think that this makes one objectively better than the other as everyone has different preferences as to what makes a phone "good"
I'm iphone user but i love android moree...
For me the last Decent phone Samsung made was the Note 9. I know people still using the note 4 because of removable battery, IR blaster & heart rate monitor.
Imo Airdrop is the only thing that apple genuinely wins . Other things go to android
The fun part is, apple was given a 3/10 for repairablity and the forces it’s users to pay 60% of the cost of the product to repair basic parts that could have been easily fixed for fraction of the cost. The only reason it won the that category was because of its insane ability to market itself out of all its problems
In Android u have "near by share" option it will work same as air drop.... U can send video and apps also
Thank you Mrwhosetheboss for your high quality channels.  I sold Google to friends and family for over 10 years.  2020 changed EVERYTHING. Google first off stopped offering unlimited photo backup which created a HUGE issue for me as a customer.  I ended up downloading all my pictures to several thumb drives.  Then Google stopped offering Google Play Music and replaced it with Youtube Music.  Again I lost access to playing my collection by streaming it a huge selling point for me with Google and now had to have my screen on unless I payed for Premium to listen to music! Then there is the censorship and one sided news.  Google was constantly showing me anti conservative news at the top of my feeds, and removing channels and censoring conservative Youtube Channels.  This was my final straw and in 2022 I purchased a iPhone 13.  I'm happy with the Privacy, and it just works! I never thought I would love a iPhone but it feels safer, more American, and love that there are more conservative apps for the os.
It's a joke the argument that apple is equal to Android when it comes to feature. JOKE
How can you forget side loading on android
The custom rom and overclocking is a life saver for poor user who must make do with what we have....Felt so nice for mentioning it and part of the small community who needs custom rom support
It's definitely a question about who the phone is targetting at...like me currently I'm using Xiaomi Mi 10t and it's been a dream for me using this phone, I've accustomed to the MiUi so much now and yeah there is some problems here and there but that's the point... what's your take on this?
The greatest Collab in the Tech world Great video
Although I love them, but I don't agree with their takes. This should have been a tie at best because it comes to user preference at the end of the day. Such scores only overates the iPhones.
I saw you with mark rober
me: *cries in poor*
Huge fan of picture in picture capability, number one reason I'll never consider Apple until they include it
I would go for pixel due to price difference
MKHD fanboy Iphone confirm 100%
I WILL BE HONEST MARK IS A APPLE FANBOY
The fact that samsung s22 is compared to the iphone 13 pro is in itself a win for Samsung and Android as a whole. The world will never have any one community. great idea, presentation was boring
Sry to say that , but MKBHD is an APPLE FANBOY
20:05 that was an awkward handshake 😄
I used both I think galaxy is better
I mean it's kinda bias towards iPhone and all apple products not giving simple points to Android and iphone win
Well,this all about your preference no facts where involved in this
U went to crunch labs with mark rober too edit: please delete this reply
Kinda looks biased when u think about it there are lot of points can argue when points are distributed....Dint think this can go so biased
But who wins in the package area? Looks like Aaron' has a much bigger package than Mk 😮
i love how there clothing reflects dark and light mode. almost like the iphone is in the darkside lmao
Not sure if anyone noticed but he's ACTUALLY following his fitness challenge and standing and working on that table he showed in that video
that's most stupid compression between android and ios I've ever seen, in android you are free to pick whatever you want, in ios there is only what they picked for you!
It seems like MKBHD was more Pro apple which made this an unfair comparison and also twisting words for apple but when it came to Android he jus ignored the flexibility in the features and software and also the fact that apple is now copying Android and making it look better and he gave a point to apple for that ... That says alot about him in my opinion.
im goona we invalidate ur looks argument. You can change android to look however you want with custom launchers (not rooted), so you guys are really just comparing the default for say your samsung with the default for apple. In fact this really does feel like a samsung vs apple fight instead of a true android on apple beatdown
Is this an iphone marketing video?
I came into this expecting android to be the clear winner, even myself being an iOS user, but this was kinda shocking. TBH i dont feel like they gave android a proper representation when it came to things like app store/app availability, and they could have dug deeper into customization, I think we can all agree Android has far more features and possibilities
Samsung m51 has 7000 mah battery
Which is actually better? For who?  Iphone was clearly better for this video
nice to see my favourites together again. great video.
I can't believe u guys think the environmental thing is real
just came back from hard day at work ....delighted to see both you in one video.
I switched from a Samsung to an iPhone about a year ago and I have to say, I've been blown away. Not only does everything just work, but every little detail has been designed to be useful in every day life. Also, they have the only truly small flagship phone with no compromises (Yes I have the iPhone 13 mini)
There's a lot of things you didn't talk about like usb c for example
Iphone also have Apple Watch compatibility
Someone is biased there
watching the 2 of u is like watching Newton and Einstein. love u guys
bro has the tesla app
As a student, samsung's splitscreen is such a blessing! :)
We can litterly see this dude's standing and editing in the last part...he's the quality one he does what he says
It was like Asus Rog + Samsung galaxy+ vivo vs iPhone 13  I think iPhone is all-rounder
Recent years I’ve seen a lot of android users switching to Apple especially in 2022. I’m sure the opposite is happening too but the reasons don’t match
I’m using both. Actually, both are good in their own way
When Marques said "I very rarely use Siri", Siri on my iPhone woke up right before Marques then talked about how he accidentally wakes it. LOL
Not happy about this comparison. Nothing to do with iOS against Android, but you compare the best iPhone against the entire Android environment and then only one Android against the iPhone. You should one or the other and then it would be more of a draw.
Loved it! Lighting set a friendly but fair mood. Great perspectives and great energy WIN/WIN
2 worst people on YouTube united
Mrwhosetheboss: Goes crazy over MKBHD still using an S21 Ultra Me: Still uses an iphone 5s (Legit)
My favorite part of this video is that there is iPhone and all other Android manufacturers. You have to pick and choose the specific an Android phone for one comparison and a different one for the next.
Hey, Can you do reviews of Infinix phones, they are the best in budget. Please
A meeting of giants indeed! Thanks for the time & effort you guys put in this video, and btw Arun you look great! I bet the transformation is starting to kick in 🙌
In Pubg mobile  compatitive some gaming phone like  ASUS rog phone is not allowed 🙄 so you have to go with i phone 🤐
I feel like comparing the iPhone to the whole range of Android phones is majorly unfair Because there is so many different Android phones specialised to different things- you can get an android phone for any purpose. It’s just comparing apple to the rest of the market. Maybe just comparing, for example, Samsung would make these results more balanced.
Honestly, I don't care for these kinds of comparisons and you see them all over YouTube. There's a fundamental problem here that comes down to individual choice and specific use case needs. Assigning points to a single brand or type only makes this comparison less useful. It's like the old Ford vs. Chevy arguments - which is better? A lot of people drive Toyota's or BMW's or dozens of other kinds. Overall, the best phone is the one in your pocket that you use everyday.
13:22 not for ne atleast 😂
The bgm 14:40 ,reminds me of Arun’s old videos
Android is better 100%
Android peasants mudded as usual
TBH iphones have super efficient silicon, have good battery and charges at a healthy pace - too much wattage ruins the battery capacity. Great battery life, but if its charging ur worried about, just purchase a magsfe battery pack from a third party such as anker. if ur spending the big bucks on an iphone already, it is a small investment to get the best of both worlds.
Samsung phones are the iphones of the androids. Which means, its shit.
iPhone is winner but still comparing 😂 vivo be like look look my name appear 🤣🤣🫠🫠🫠🫣🫣🫣🤌
let me guess because of the co-host: android 0 iphone 238746 just because with no reason given also when you tried to disagree it was the same excuse of "you're just using it wrong"
Is that a record amount of comments in this time period?
Felt like a biased comparison.
two of the best in the game. love this video
This video seems super biased. Did you really give a draw for features? Android is the obvious winner in the features category and its not even close. You should also have a catogory for overall usability and intuitiveness (UX) that's the most important thing to me and Android clearly wins and it's not even close.
Them talking about MK using an year old phone and then there is me who uses a 6 year old phone
Bullshit. The best galaxy flagship stomps the latest iphone flagship, no 2 ways about it.
OS vs phone brand
Very much a subjective opinion, but apple screwed me over once. Not gonna give them another dime ever again.
I hate MKBHD now
i dont consider myself a hardcore android user as arun said, but i still find myself using splitscreen all the time.. maybe its to do with the fact that google removed the shortcut to put app in splitacreen (holding down recent apps/square button) so its more cumbersome to put apps in splitscreen
I was about to say "I'm bored and done being continously updated on what actually is happening in the phone space" and sticking with iPhone for life, because it just works,and usually is the top dog. But then I might one day end up like the people that think Edge is bad because they associate it with what internet explorer was well over 10 years ago. Or I like those professors who think the Office Suite is useless when it comes to writing things in STEM fields and you have to use LaTeX, because of the way things was in 2006, yet couldn't be further from the truth today. Or the people that think Mac screens are "inherently higher resolution than all PC screens" to this day. The thing is, these things can change dramatically over time. But it's nice having an in depth video like this now and then to get updated, for those of use that aren't into this stuff quite enough to stay updated continously.
i feel like the method of scoring was not fair to android. like android has great cameras to , just not better than apple but close. they should have given like .6points to apple .4 to android. using similar approach for other categories would actually tell a much different and real story.
Come on Apple! Give us an Always On Display on the iPhone 14 Pro! 😂
Android: Cause of Downloading.
I think the stability of the Iphone's camera is not as great as the quality of Android's photos and features so it makes me wonder if that plus of stability makes even sense or a difference. Iphone is the most eco friendly? What happened to the tons of plastic wasted with their proprietary cables?
There's some Android features I reallylike that isn't on iPhone. However, I'm not so thrilled with the lastest update to the next Android version turning a rock solid phone into buggy Android of old. Oh and get rid of those forced update reminders
I am confused 🤔. Is this video sponsored by APPLE 😄
But in my opinion, the real winner is Android.
If i have to choose one phone for lifetime. I will definately choose Android
If you see from professional's perspective yeah iPhones are best choice.
2 people you wouldn't want to talk to on YouTube united
Mkbhd is sheeple
This is actually uk 🇬🇧 vs USA 🇺🇸.  I love this guys. The ascent alone 🎉❤
This video was so fun, i love content like this. Just nerds sitting and chatting about nerd stuff
Is it me or does MKBHD seem bored and reluctant?  It's bizarre.
The bias is real lol...I smell Bs
This video today shows me MKBHD and Mrwhosetheboss can be bought. How much did Apple pay you guys to do this. Well down 👏
A video of Android paying the price for being a user friendly, fun phone. Apple may be fast and compact but in the end of the day android phones are always fun, bright, friendly and explorable. Samsung phones never make us feel confused. The camera thou, latest Android phones got next gen camera with twice more features and that got ignored too.
The cream!
I like how Arun disagrees with most things marques says but is too nice to say anything and gives the point to iphone 😂. Samsung display slaps iphone by a mile lol
This is a big marketing for Chinese phones.  U won’t believe this..
Android - 144Hz + 6000mAh + Decent Camera + Gaming Trigger + Headphone Jack OR 120Hz + Great Camera + ... OR 60 Hz + Cheap + ...  Apple - Only what apple gives you. Can't go wrong but no choices.   I always choose android cuz it all gives u choices and I would never get an apple cuz it locks u in the ecosystem.
The first video mrwhosetheboss made i really don't like I feel it was kinda partial 🤷
20:07 ❤️ POP !! 🔥💪😅😅
iphone 13 pro vs all android phone Lol 😑
Great video Arun (& MK). 👌 iPhones definitely need better batteries and better chargers.
Interesting that you guys wanted to compare OSs and not devices but still found the iOS significantly better than Android... Especially if I think what sort of features (software) Android offers and what iOS. What I saw though, was that you often referred to the OSs and gave the win to iOS and when that was not enough, you started comparing a device (iPhone 13 pro Max) to others...
As someone who switched from iPhone to Android in 2021 with no regrets, I don't think either is objectively better. It's whatever the user prefers. All of the Internet bickering is pointless. All that matters is that people who want to use iOS are using iOS, and the people who want to use Android are using Android. Neither need criticising just because of their personal tastes.  With that being said, I like the awesome content that both of you pump out, but I do feel like iPhone got some bias here, a lot of the categories mentioned here favoured the iPhone.
I personally think blue berry and nokia is way better than both like if u agree
Me watching this in a custom rom :D
I’m honestly surprised. I wasn’t expecting iPhone to win by so much tbh
The Video was more of a iPhone vs Samsung than vs Android
Why yo compairing hardware it's the software
I always multitask on Android, one of the main reason I can never switch.
biased
Bro asking these questions to mkbhd is useless I believe he will just choose the iPhone  all the time 😂
We definitely need more collab videos like this! Great job guys! 🙌🏽
It was really fun to see the contrast in some opinions, definitely would love to see another collaboration again!!
I used android & iPhone for years i think iPhone was the best for me, the OS is simple unlike android its kinda complicated. android phone is good too i can customize EVERYTHING it’s good for pen-testing its easy to bypass android than IOS.
Iphone started excluding charger to maintain eco friendly. With less boxing space... But when charger is coming also the in box... Then how it will be a eco friendly....... 2 box is eco friendly... But all in one not eco friendly?.. Marketing gimic....
Arun really killing it , averaging 2.5 mill views every vid
IPhone is just a reliable machine that does the basic really good, Android I can do way more, modify everything to my needs, install ANYTHING and EVERYTHING but with the risk of malware infections, depending on your needs or the Business needs, Iphone is the best for business but if you or your business require more Android is the way to go, is all about the needs.
Comparing apples and oranges though
This is a colab just to make and apple is best in many point and a marketing thing but its all comes to ur guys personal opinion bcs i use both samsang and iphone but not the latest onces, so both are superb in there own way for me but mostly  in my way i prefer samsung  as my daily driver bcs i can do more for my profession and i daily life.
Hahahahahaha im sorry this is very one sided... photo part ruined it.. samsung can do not only stupidly good photos but also 8bit raw ... i think its more your use to apple 😅
How biased is Marques for the iPhone.  Omg.   I find it hard to take his reviews seriously anymore.
Android all the way !!!
Got you in 4K 60FPS ON IPHONES. But on SAMSUNG S22 Ultra 8K 25FPS
Iphones are better but they just don't have some key features like call recording, YouTube vanced and install apps from different sources
There’s definitely been times where I take pictures with my 13 Pro and the pictures never show up in my gallery. So the part about it never happening on an iPhone is a straight up lie.
I respect opinions of your both but first time i am feeling impractical and sooo biased on your channel, like appreciating on for its good but not another
The amount of disappointed comments are about to flood this video. HAHAHA.
I have never used the dual app thing on any android phone. I personally think its not functional at all in almost all scenarios. Just having 2 apps and add the keyboard into the mix, turns into complete madness and preparing your apps for this shit is the worst thing ever.
Coming from 2 youtuber who use iphone as their main Phone... LOL
Half way through, unsubscribed both.
MKBHD is an apple fan boy and a true American. Ofcourse he votes for iphone. He made a video about justifying apple wheels 🤣.  I agree in performance and battery backup iphone is better but no way it's display equals to samsung and photography is better than samsung. Apple is no more doing any industry pushing inventions but doing more money grabbing inventions. At this point apple doing more harm to the industry than good. This point alone is enough not to go for greedy apple.
I honestly don't think taking android as an average is somewhat unfair, seeing as apple's battery, performance come from their focus on those few products. Android cannot have that bonus due to the pure amount of phones. Thus I would argue that androids natural advantage of having all those different phones should also be taken into account.
I feel there should be a Samsung Vs iPhone then a Xiaomi Vs iPhone video   Cos I feel other androids are dragging the best down
It really boils down to personal choice. I don't see myself ever switching to Apple because of those little features that Android lets me do, but is a struggle to do with iPhone. Android is more like Windows, it feels like it lets you interact with everything, and instead Apple feels like it restricts you to Apple.
s22 ultra is a beast no matter what ......
It was the camera app issue on Andriod that finally pushed me to switch to iOS. It wasn't just one phone, it was three in a row. Then the final straw was that a decent Android phone has reached price parity with iPhone. Everything else just got so expensive that the "Apple Tax" almost no longer applies. See the cost of the Microsoft Surface Laptop versus an MacBook Air.
Quite primed a conversation...close to an appy fanboy video. Was expecting a balanced perspective from both of you. Except for the video part Android is better in all aspects.  A typical ifan video goes like this... If something is available in Android and not in iphone it becomes a "gimmick".. If iPhone has something and Android does not..."see Android is crap!". This is the first video from Arun for which I had to click a dislike :-)
To me, it depends on which one a person prefers, because at the end of the day, both can do similar stuff. But I'd say android for budget reasons.
MKBHD just love the iPhone so much :)
I understand that this message is ment for the masses, but assuming people like myself being both of your avid demographic. Tech people are specific to their taste. . . . Edit: considering the general mass right now, I totally agree.
How is the display a draw. The screens come from samsung. Samsung uses Android. Clearly win for Android
this is from the perspective of two tech people rather than a conclusive thing and from an American perspective, at least with iMessage. (MMS/SMS isn't free in my country).   It feels like a "Buy Apple" ad, you can't go wrong. screw having options!    I don't use airdrop as much although I do from mac to mac or iPhones. I personally think that you can't go wrong with either side, unless you buy the cheapest shit android has to offer then your experience WILL vary from the rest. Arun started with trying to make his cheap phone better, and that's what i do too. However, I think since 2014/2015, i didn't feel the need to root my Android anymore. With Apple, the customization isn't even close, it's good that they're allowing some things now but man, Oneplus alone felt like a custom rom back then. Now, it feels like they lost that edge but i haven't touch a OnePlus since 3T or was it  This which is better, really is a use case situation. If you are going to be a light user, you don't need a high end Samsung/Android and might not need a high end iPhone either. If it is ok with you, go with a hand me down phone flagship.   I stop buying phones that are brand new. I always opt for the last year's model or the previous year before that because there are people that will change phones as much as their underwear and those people are good to keep close haha.    Samsung still gave updates to my note 9 recently, which was surprising because i thought it ended actually. I personally go with the more versatile . I even got a gaming laptop before when I hardly play games for the sake of having it there. My macbook has dualboot (intel) so i can flip to Windows when i need to. Otherwise, it's macOS when working. Linux I love, but that is far from being a market mover for now. hopefully, they prove me wrong.   If i was american, i probably be on iOS because my family probably be on it. I can run Linux on my android and i have an m1 iPad that isn't doing much . I find that kiwi browser allows me to have chrome extensions but it's not on ipadOS and I felt it's ok, i can run a VM on the iPad. I can't do it exactly even if there is (i think there is based on some videos i've seen) but i only have the 64GB version and man, that sucks but if you get the 256GB one, it's close to the price of the iPad pro based, which would make you want to get that instead since the difference between the two isn't much.   I thought this video was going to be comprehensive but i guess, they're seeing it from a normies eyes but to me, it's their preference. If i had a tech channel, maybe i would be the same too. Just choose the easiest to manage. I don't doubt normies would prefer that rather than going through customization and shit like that.
you both are apple Biased. wrong choice of people to ask about which one is better.
pls giveaway
Ahh the crossover we’ve all been waiting for
It was like watching man united game
I won't spend more than 200 dollars for a phone primarily because most extra features I will never use
It's interesting how they're comparing a $1100 phone to literally any phone from $4 to $1200. You can compare Android and iOS, but it would have to be the software alone, not with a mix of hardware from 50 different companies.
Its honestly a preference thing, and what you need.
For a dummy, who likes taking Instagram pics and sexsnaps, then the iPhone is the best. Android is better for devs, because of flexibility of the APIs. I don't like to be imprisoned to not choosing what I'm about to eat, what I'm about to change. That's why I'm a Linux user. But, many people used to being an iPhone, or MacOS X user, so they would pick Apple, just for the ecosystem, that will lock them down.
I think Marques does a better testing of a phone than Arun
The iphone max is the most uncomfortable phone to use out there. That alone persuaded me to purchase the S22, still a huge phone but considerable easier to hold
This video is just looks promoting Apple (Iphone) and degrading Android phones. There are so many good features r in Android which is not available in Apple IOS. Moreover Android is  user friendly compare to IOS. When it comes to build quality, Android Phones are far better and easy to Repair. Please stop promoting and provide a decent comparisons.
Looks like you forgot about Sony when it comes to Android. And there camera-app is superb.
For me the notch and the jail is all it takes to ditch that ipn😉
Trade-in prices are also a factor to consider, especially for budget-conscious consumers.
Wow, you just completely skipped out on privacy, surveillance and app tracking. Smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
Im unsubscribing if it’s a tie
I'm pretty sure you just came to hear Marquez opinion..😂 He's an iPhone fan... And honestly, if you prefer what Samsung has to offer.. Just get with IT! Its your preference at the end of the day
I'm an Android (S22 Ultra) and iPhone 13 Pro Max, I find myself using the latter a lot more than the first one for one simple reason, practicality. It does everything I need, and then some, with minimal effort and time consumption.
Marques is Apple Boy 😂
Marques is my man 💪
I just need mod apps. And obviously i get much more options in Android
@goldenreviewer should enlighten these 2 on sustained gaming performance on both sides
I got my first iPhone two months ago after using Android since 2010: I do miss split screen and I had to force myself to get used to not having it on the iPhone. At the same time I feel iOS is so smooth that I don't mind going back and forth between apps, and the copy/paste gesture with three fingers just helps me so much. I still miss the better Android notification system though :(
👎🏻
I feel like mkbhd is way too biased towards apple
It feels generally pointless to compare hardware, since that is specific to one Android phone (S22U) and will change with any new iPhone. With most things like screen, battery, camera, there are probably Android devices that specialise on each aspect and can beat the iPhone on that one metric, but the iPhone generally delivers an A-grade flagship experience on all of them while you might get an Android phone with a A+ screen, B+ battery and A- camera.
There is a lot to be said for personal choice, you have no choices with apple, they make the choices
Honestly, none of these phones are superior anyways. Just use it whatever you have that makes you happy. Smartphone wars are basically console wars that getting into argument over a smartphone 💀     Also, android user btw (and try not to bash me over a smartphone challenge (impossible) (only 0.0000000001% will pass my challenge 😱😱😱))
I prefer Andriod because iPhone has a lot of restriction. If it was before, iPhone was my chooce because it's smooth especially in games but now androids can offer them.
OK right, but I can't survive without Android 🙏
Hi mrwhoestheboss i love your videos your the best
I feel like you've not been fair to android
I  disagree at first but when he explains why, I go "hmmm he has a point." I am a samsung fan boy by the way.
I dont like the way in which he just favorites the iphone like all the time… there are so much things which are not true
I don't understand the battery life argument, as long as the phone is not dead at the end of the day when you go charge it, there's no difference between having 5% battery left or 30% , I'm going to charge it anyway, having a USB C however I find way more important since everything uses it nowadays and I just need to bring a single cable instead of having to bring the iPhone charger and the iPad charger for example.
Not fare at all ...... it is obvious the goal of this video 👎👎👎.... Try to act better next time
f**k iphones they suck i have both iphone 13 pro and galaxy s22u
I didnt really like how many times facetime and airdrop cameup coz it feels like just Americans use all that , and the rest of the iphone users across the world have no clue wat airdrop is and would never bother using facetime . Then comes iMessages bruh trust me I live in the gulf and all of the youth here use iphone but no one legit no one cares about iMessage or airdrop or facetime . The iphones users here r like I got an iphone becoz it's an iphone and not a cheap android
I love both of you ❤️❤️
I usually separate it to do you want more freedom and wanna be able use everything without restrictions go for android. If you feel like you just want a simple life with everything working and you don't mind being heavily restricted and controlled (Little freedom) then go for apple.
Apple is cutting on innovation and just manipulates their hard cord fans whereas the Samsung provides you more bang for your buck and lots of cool technology features.  I mean come one, apple doesn't even have finger print scanner under the display yet. Forget about finger print, they can't even remover the notch on the top of the screen. That's how much Apple is behind in technology.
My last phone was the Pixel 3a and i loved it. So clean and customizable. But the Battery life annoyed me so much that i switched to an Iphone. Now I'm full on Apple. And i have to say yes, Iphones are VERY nice, stable and have great features. But the lack of customizability and the fact that you have to pay for every good App is so annoying.
Mr whose the boss brings the answers to the questions that matters most to us viewers i hope he notices me one day my favorite tech YouTuber 🥺
I'm sure almost 90% of people chose Android because WE can download modded APKs from websites so we don't have to pay for it. Pirate's life.
I knew it, u teased this collab last video
I'm thinking of getting an iPhone but its really gonna be hard for me to leave USB-C and the Always on Display.  Those 2 things are keeping me from switching along with customization, etc.  I don't take pics or videos but I do want a phone with an excellent battery so the Pro Max has my attention.  This is tough.
My man just asked the owner for the iPhone if android is better💀
Point for iPhone Battery is a joke.. 😄
Marques is really getting a grant from apple for this interview.
iphone sucks, android rocks! Android all the way, baby. Not gonna bite that apple, going straight to android heaven
So it seems to me this is biased. You literally said samsung has a better screen, so we will call it a draw 🙄
Personaly I would give the eco friendly point to the Android because it has the charger in the box so you don't have to buy a charger that has it's own packaging and delivery
I know Samsung is so much better than apple like apple is a pile of flamming garbage
Why does the iPhone get points for recyclable when it's barely repairable, and they're the ones who started removing chargers etc?. Both shouldn't get points
I believe preference will change over time, i got myself an iphone 13 mini just because its the most compact and powerful phone and small phones gonna extinct.
This was an disappointing video to watch, its way too biased on iphone for example the screen is a draw because iphone is smoother? Its smoother because the OS is smoother not the screen, the OS features is a draw because iphone has airdrop and big pillars? It does have big pillars that every iphone user loves but are not features that you see android users complain about or want, the camera iphone won for the pictures and being stable because a personal bad experience with an pixel phone doomed all the android phones, clearly you haven't use an iphone when it's storage is close to full its starts giving bugs and problems frequently  Then the android gets a draw with the iphone stability, how? An iphone will always work well it can be a mini an iphone 6 7 or whatever and its gonna be stable, now buy a cheap android that ain't gonna be stable at all  I though this was gonna be based on facts thats why is kinda disappointing.
Photos on newer iphones are bang average. Older iphones take better photos tho.
Siri is utterly useless. Deleting Siri would immeasurably improve iOS
Loved the title tho *Android vs iPhone which is actually better* like it is saying it in a different tone... XD
For me, I don't think both of them know how to use Android properly. They used to, but to level  of power users, I don't think so.
Pov : apple fan
Okay so hear me out, iOS is limited to Apple only while Android has hundreds and thousands of brands working with it and coming up with new features and yet Apply manages to compete with them every year without any problem.
Android for the win , with just Samsung
The fact that all the android phones (Vivo, Samsung, ROG- best phones in each segment while mediocre in the rest) were used to compare with a single iPhone, already makes the iPhone a winner.
This is Apple vs Google
Basically comes down to preference as mentioned, if you don’t have any requirements and just want a great overall phone it’s the iPhone. If someone’s looking into specific benefits of phones androids provide specialties in those categories depending on what you want out of it.
iphone overall much better, except the notch and non usb c port
You literally let him rank the whole thing & you know its bullshit too
Android forever❤️
Marques Brown Lee is the world's coolest " Blerd " : Black-Nerd.
You cant compare iphones and android phones because there is lot of different phones. You should just compare android OS vs IOS not best iphone to random android phones
- Make it repairable with accessible parts WITHOUT SOFTWARE LOCKS (Having to call up support to re-register the official part they sent to you is stupid) - Allow more modification so people can customize and develop features for IOS (Android heavily benefits from this since many community developed features end up becoming mainstream)  I would have 0 qualms swapping if they did the above. I would probably even be fine getting a MacBook.
tfw the 2 biggest tech people, who's opinion you value, subjectively rank iPhone over Android
The screen is literaly a samsung made screen so ofc android would win as they can make better screens and use them themselves. Also i dont use multitasking that often on my galaxy 20 fe as i got the crappy european version. Constant throttleling the performance die to temps. Man i rlly just wanna buy a usa motherboard and replace mine so i get the better processor lmao
well the video is kinda boring for people who do not have this type of phones or money just my opinion no offence
Did Marques try to fist bump at the end 20:06 XD
How exactly did Iphone scored the Eco category?  They're refusing to switch to USB C just to make more money with their Lightning cables, creating tons of e-waste.
You Guys should Create more Paid Promotional Videos like this, they are really entertaining to watch!
I think iphones are damn good, if not the best. But god damn, I hate the OS.  Give me an iPhone hardware with Android and I'll be happy (yes i know apple optimizes their OS greatly)
This guy never fails to disappoint us!💯
great discovery and phenomenal analysis 🥳 as for me it’s really amazing to learn and have backgrounds about all Techs from you guys 🤩🙏
Lies android is much better
Let us be real, MKBHD is an Apple lover like he is a Tesla one...he is more of a disguise user of Android. Once upon a time he was an Android lover first.
You guys are biest for apple
Its funny how Iphone won, but MKBHD is using a Samsung phone on daily basis
My biggest pet peeve from iOS is lack of background tasks, apps stop running in background completely, so if you have long running task like a download, upload or video editing running, you need to make sure that app remains in the foreground and phone doesn't locks until the task is completed, else the task fails. On Android this works great, since even if the app is pushed to background the app continues running it as a service and one can see the progress from the notification center. On iOS even something like a battery low pop up or swiping down notification center puts app in the background, the other day I lost a game since I got a battery low pop up and that caused the game disconnected from the  internet, this is just crazy. I wonder how come more people don't find it annoying specially tech youtubers who would be facing this scenario regularly.
I mean you flew all the way from UK to USA just to make video between IOS and Android preferences. That's hmmmm kinda irrelevant and I still think it comes down to user preference. I use Android and all my friends use Apple which kinda is sad I cannot facetime or have a iMessage group with me. But again Apple ecosystem is like a black hole in which you cannot escape once it starts pulling you in so do I get myself sucked in that ecosystem or do I just embrace it is what it all comes down to.
Iphone could be the best phone in the world no questions, and I still wouldnt want to own one. I dont agree with Apple as a company, and I want to own and repair my phone.  Now apples making the repairability a bit better, but only for their phones, and thats just not good enough when you have a whole ecosystem you try to force people into. Also, as my phone slows down, id like an unlocked boot loader so I can continue to get the best out of it.  I dont really like android either, but atleast i have a little more control over the device I brought
Guys, it’s already 2022. 🥲🥲🥲
zte Axon 40 ultra hands down
If you actually watching this, it's doesn't matter who is beating on the scoreboard, the whole experience and knowledge from these two is so much bigger than just saying iphone wins or Android wins, every single video helps me to learn more about tech and phones, i love ios and android tho, you are so good guys ❤️
Worst video i've seen in my life
IMO: apple=user face and ease of use aindroid= for more technical users. More variety of phones and more settings and costumization.
Wait! Lighting sucks?
12:54 Androids (at least samsungs) have "Airdrop" but we call it nearby share or something like that  Androids have "Facetime" but we call it google duo. Fun fact, Androids can now Facetime if  invited by an iPhone user.
Combining performance with actual user experience was not the best take I think
i’d like to make a few points: apple phones don’t really cater to low end  half the time my older iphone doesn’t save photos
ARUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN ur slaangg dang man... bo tl of woto
I've looked at  Marquez and Aaron channels for years but I just realized how similar my tastes are to Mr who's the boss. When apple finally does something it can do it well but I love the freedom Android gives, simple example years ago a flashlight on the iPhone wasn't a thing while on Android it was common 4 years, there was an app developer  that made it a thing on iPhone but apple kicked them out, then Apple not too long after  implemented the same thing the guys were doing, then acted like they invented it.  I don't like the way Apple does certain things and by that I mean their general arrogant attitude, the battery fiasco is a good example.
Screen is half a point each? Multitasking goes to iPhone?? In what world??
When he spoke about the features ....I got to know that Marcus has been working for Apple
@Mrwhosetheboss bro u left @MKBHD hanging 20:04
So, we are approaching new Iphone release date.  Samsung beat this year and previous year with s22 and s21 . Now all youtubers doing same thing to "prove" iphone is far more better so iphone can increase their sells.  Note. You understand it if they give same point to siri and google assistant. Come on guys google assistant is far better.
Honestly.. IPhone is a beast.. But something about Samsung that dominates... A Samsung phone has so much to offer... While iphone just makes everything basic... Samsung tries to make their phone usable to everyone and its more fun in all aspects while iphone wants you to use what they choose... Marques is just an iphone fan... But its the samsung for me!!
👍👍✌️✌️🤞
I have an old HTC U11. Still works fine no need to change. My old iPad however became unless as Apple blocked OS updates which in turn blocked web browser updates making the iPad unless. So Android it is for me.
Would love to see more collabs like this
I think you're getting paid for this kind of stuffs. This comparison is totally unfair! This actually brings down your credibility
I was with Android but moved to iso due many problems with each phone I had. Couldn’t always find a solution didn’t know when updates where. So I switched to ISO no regrets any problems found all solutions battery us better signal better had no problems learning to adjust to iso. Not into changing things on the phone not bothered about eco system it just works how I want it to just fine. Not going back ever to android! 😊👍🏾
Loved the video, Awesome Collab👍
I feel like Marques Brownlee is too US biased, like yeah people used those features because most of the population have an iphone and other apple devices but outside of the US people use Android and windows pc at home which make the iphone features useless. Also costumer support (outside the US) and repairability on Iphones its just straight up misery and legal robbery.
cool topic as allways , enjoyed  video thx my man :)  .
I agree with Marques on the camera  and thats on stock other than that nahh I feel like I'm watching another video of different guy other than him
With that bezel, it just can't be a draw lol. It's beyond horrific. Finally doing away with it... (almost)  on the next iPhone tho.
But this is what u guys think not really which one is better, because there are a lot of people who just hate the way apple works so then it already cant be better.
watching this on my 200$ phone 🥲🥲
Loved it!!  It's a manner of preference. It's not about which is best like they said. There's a lot of option in Android and in IPhone, it's less but it's promising and Amazing in everything like high end Android phones.  Tech is really confusing sometimes but also enlightening(idk how tho)
I love my iPhone 13. When it comes to Android, my favorite is no longer available: LG. For me though, my current iPhone 13 is best. I don't need a lot: at least a 6" display (I'm a big guy), at least 32GB of storage, and I don't care about customizing too much. So my iPhone 13 is the best for me. I do agree with this video too.
You would think it's a lie both made their careers reviewing Android phones.
I have to say when it comes to customization....Apple  sucks and it will still suck after ios 16...fyi I was a long time apple user. On Apple You still cannot put icons where ever you want. You can't install or change a theme effortlessly. It's a huge wonky process on iPhone.  Iphone for me got so boring. I will say apple is more streamlined. I miss that. Andriod isn't as smooth and it's car play is hideous lol...I went from the iPhone 13 to the Galaxy S22. It has been an easy transition. Yes, it does come down to a personal preference.
If you think Iphones are better than Android you are insane, the only thing Iphones do better than Android is at being boring
Android has youtube vanced so...
This is hella bias
For me I can't afford flagship phone and from the budget i have i can't get any i phone, where i live people don't use i message face time,ect which are apple exclusive, for my work or study theres no things I can't do that my friends with i phones are able to do. There is nothing i regret having very budget phone than i phone expect for cameras and that too flagship also have better. In fact i have peace of mind that my friends with iphone dont have that they always worry about their phone. Android has wide range of choices and that's why android is sold much more in the world than iPhones. All phone are great its matter of choice.
It's not fair at all you're talking about very very small differences even Samsung camera is better even many iPhone users say it you praise the iPhone for using the iphone we can do the same things even with any entry level cheap phone but people like you paying  three times more money and buying iphone
This is bullshit from two guys that use the iPhone as their primary phone.
Mrwhostheboss and MKBHD are not the only people who use phones in the world. I think data collection and statistics are needed to know which OS is better. That will take time tho. Anyway, I totally agree with some of The things MKBH judged between the two OS.
My main question is why the s22 ultra was charged up to 69% 😆
Mkbhd only knows iPhone Samsung and Pixel he never check Xiaomi or vivo Huawei that's where u come and pass him soon trust me
One of the big problem with android and iphone is OS there to different no one can beat another one if you use Android you can have very much freedom in your device but if you use iphone they are not so much freedom but if you use iphone you get a better software experience and a better update experience in Android they are not so much good above software experience because the bug and not so much update coming on Android I know that I have 22 ultra give you four Android update but iPhone give you 5 or 6 update they are very different Eid depend on the person to person who love Android he never want to use iPhone who like iPhone he never want to use Android phone because they are happy with it what he get wait it we talk about update but some people doesn't care about any kind of update there will different in personality and many other things that is that thing.
This was great, please continue making more collaborative videos. These are fun to watch and packed with information & different POVs on the same point. Btw guys, thanks for providing great quality content. You guys rock and  add a lot of value to the tech community. You guys inspire many of us.
So isn’t it basically a single iOS company vs a whole bunch of android brands with their individual RnD departments 🤔
This feels off
What was that last shot shot on
Differentiating between Android user and IPhone user should also be considered as Racism?
Great to hear my two favourite youtubers chatting about iPhone vs Android. Im in the middle of testing both now. Android navigation is so much better. Biggest annoyance in iPhone is when they put buttons in the top left and corner and there is no option but to press that button to get where you want. As a European user who is not tied by iMesssage or Facetime, and I don't use a Mac, I think the clear winner is going to be Android. PS: I think for a video like this clear audio is all that is necessary. Don't be killin yourself with the visuals!
oppo has this feature where  it can connect  to all oppo devices  to act as speakers
The title should be : "Two tech nerds trying to avoid an argument 😂
I love watching Apple versus Android videos.
WOW, what a bonus, 2 tech legends together 😎
Lots of kids who don’t want (can’t) spend money on an iPhone in the comments 😂
Mkbhd : It's a whole year old ....it's crazy... Me here watching video from 3year old phone....
By now this is a dead topic. It's all about personal preference at this time because each phone has its equal share of pros and cons.
I saw more moto g ads than this video. Sucks
*Consider these points too* Using an apple is like having bodyguard around you 24/7 all though it's important but it's not independent Android is independent plus you need to pay for games and apps that are free in Android  Plus iPhone charge you more and also don't include charger or cable which costs more plus Android gives all sorts of device's a chance where as apple does not like sometimes you get a gift or purchase  product that helps you in your lifestyle there's a small chance that does not support it. Consider these points too
You guys are favoriting
My Android phone (s10e) has a sd card, headphone jack and gets at least 4 years of updates (instead of the at least 5years apple goes for (for example the iPhone 7)) The galaxy s10e is the absolute best Phone for me
This is kind of video which I was waiting for.
Seriously Marques when do you switch camp?! I knew you to be Google guy hard core! Just when did apple bought you over?!
iOS vs android industry. Yeah fair fight 👏
very dumb comparison
You guys are so cute
Completely android vs single ios that’s great Apple
If you understand football, this Messi vs Ronaldo type of an argument.
didn"t watch the video. Whoo cares about the same video you have seen every year for the past 6. From a business perspective Android beats apple hands down, for features and provisioning MDM apples dificult to handle and they are far more exspensive to repair and break more IMO.
misleading, should be the title.
can you do a phone giveway please
finally settling the lifelong debate
I use split screen all the time.
Apple is not environment friendly 😒.  One faulty component = entire board change 🙄
what difference does it make when you guys carry both phones all day long? haha
Aren't you supposed to be working out and taking a break!!? Worried.
Biased as hell. There's so many things Android phones have that iPhones don't, and you didn't mention any of these. S22 Ultra for example has  S pen Dex Popup windows Split screen Fingerprint sensor Customization of phones appearance Super intuitive launchers that can be configured to work exactly how you want them to like custom swipe gestures Proper NFC Reverse wireless charging Faster charging Maximum power saving mode and emergency mode 10x zoom YouTube Vanced (I get why they didn't mention this one lol) Side loading apps and not being forced to pay for a bunch of them Torrenting Usb C   Probably many more things the ultra does as well these are just examples off the top of my head.
Are we talking about phone or OS.  it sounds like you mostly talking about the phone not OS!  Depends which phone you buy the Android is slightly different on each phone!
This comparative is valid to US. Here in Brazil the majority of phones are Android, by far. There is a reason. Apple is so expensive, really expensive, can't win compared to Android. Android has the best cost-benefit ratio, Apple can't be taken seriously when someone needs the full wage for almost an year to buy an iPhone, it's not even an option.
Lol this entire conversation is distorted.
He's mainly only asking mkbhd questions, so it's really only he's opinion.
Yo Marquees really knows how to put down points really good
Wtf Why apple winning here in my opinion displays, photography android should have got the point
It's all down to choice but I definitely prefer android due to the variety, features and freedom... Best option is to have both if you can't choose 🤣
About apple's environmental impact, i call bulls, they are heavily against phone repairability. because od that, their phones end up polluting more than other phones. Disappointed, dislike of course
my two favourite youtubers sitting and chatting about the best OS is hands down amazing to watch! love your collabs but the in person ones are even BETTER
Mkbhd is paid 💰 by Apple
Hi big fan
it was nice seeing you both in the same frame again 🤌😌
im currently using a galaxy s10 but my next phone will be an iphone
Lol in my country iphone is a symbol of status..  people in my country mostly buy iphones because it makes you look rich and cool..
In Video points going to iPhone Comment Section :- "I would choose Android"
Few millions nerds are so active online, and they always said android is better forever, while billions else just prefer the consistency from Apple, if their time is money so why spend times on modding their devices if their time that will be spending for that is ways more expensive than just getting an iPhone that they can trust that it's one of the best and will always be one of the best and will be working very well for every long time might be longer than the time that they're gonna buy another one, very very consistent every time,   anyway there are 2 reasons that will buy an Android if :  1- i couldn't afford an iPhone,  2- i have so much money to buy whatever phone whenever wherever
Tbh a limited amount of people use android in the US. I speak to hundreds (700-800) of different people yearly. 95+% of people that I talk to use an iPhone - iMessage, FaceTime, airdrop etc are things used and it’s very convenient. For the masses the features android has to offer is irrelevant - not what a majority of people look for in the US market at least.
Android offers more things that most people need and can afford.
For me IOS is good but Android is just more better cz you can do anything you want like gpu over clocking, change fonts, emojis, change the looks of your phone (themes i mean), change rom like if your phone was china rom you can just change it to global rom if you want, etc.... That IOS can't
I don't really agree on the eco point, apple is infamous for it's making it as difficult as possible for the user to repair their phone. With that, the costs of a repair go up so high, that people just decide to buy a new one, which is awful for the environment.
Was it a comparison for overall general user experience or just based on Marcus's experience??
8:20... Marques was cirurgical here.
It's so bizarre I'm still using a Samsung S9...lol
9:48 . wrong, apple is very anti repair which makes it very wasteful.
What an amazing collab.... MKBHD is damn cool
One phone company (iPhone) vs numerous of phone companies and iphone still cones on top🥱
*this is more likely samsung vs iphone duuh* 😐😑
I think mkbhd's preference is in a way that it falls towards apple
Why did this seem biased towards Apple. Like they were almost advertising for apple....
This is a take based mostly on the US
Best value, iphone SE 2020/2022
I too enjoy vanilla but as a gamer and PC enthusiast it was depressing switching to an iPhone, it did everything right but it was sooooo boooooring and bland, I had to switch back within a week
Damn he looks like an athlete   And the new guy looks good too
that question simply can't be answered in my opinion, it completely depends on how each person use their phone. for me i use a lot of things that just are not available on iOS like emulators and apps to read and watch manga and anime (I'm not a weep tho). and i rarely use any social media platforms so it's android for me but if these things didn't hold me back I'd go for an iphone because it just..works
When the next gen iphone with curved edges comes out, I bet MKBHD looooves the curves then.
The iPhones performance is just superior, the thing that gets me when I switch to android is something soo simple like editing a video for YouTube/Instagram I can use iMovie and it’s easy and it just works and provides good results. Meanwhile for android there are apps and editing and quality always looks like crap on social media. Also battery life sucks on android compared to iPhone 13 pro max vs s22 ultra
British accent sound so different from American accent.
Shouldnt the title be more like Android Vs IOS? iPhone is the product wait dude what are Android phones called
samsung has its own airdrop actually
I feel like i can agree with most what was said and what points were given to who ... Ultimately its a personal choice that you make for a phone that suits you best but even then you have to keep in mind longevity and just overall quality of using the phone cause the software is the most important thing at the end, your interactions with the phone is mostly the software side on a daily basis. iOS clear winner.
BS he just can't talk against the iPhone
I waited whole 20 minutes just to listen “ sub to the channel would be …………” what word should it be
“Who is the best reviewer: Marques or Mr. WITB?” Me: Yes
The colors on the 13Pro display don’t even come close to the S22Ultra’s. I use both.
i think you two hate android😪
It’s time for Sony to make a iPhone 13 mini competitor
apple fan boys telling people which system is better doesnt make much sense,
another genuine one!
It was so interesting it felt like 5 minutes.
i dont know in so many ways you failed cause i lost count... many other fellows  already  commented about that so i dont need to do this ..... you are both masters on what you doing so i was expecting way more than that... sorry guys
My 2 faves!! These collabs should be more frequent. 🥹
Here comes the mad Android fanboys 💀
It’s a never ending topic, can we stop this?
I actually stopped watching it when they give a draw for the display😅
Its based on personal experience
For long-term user iphone is the best. In terms of smoothnes and support
Android, no question.
Despite being submerged in the Apple ecosystem with all their products, I still appreciate what android has to offer then again, when and if you are in apple's ecosystem it's almost impossible to leave because of how good everything works together. My mac just seamlessly connects to my iPhone with my watch and Air Pods all working together as one which is incredible. If you haven't tried it then you missed out on a lot.. (yes I still use windows for gaming :/ )
Completely disagree with it.
Nonsense Video how are you going to know which is better when MarkAssBrownie is biased lol 🤦🏻‍♂😂
The only problem for me on apple is that repairing the goddamn phone is frustrating.
This two platforms boils down to personal preference An android phone with almost the same price as an apple phone give more options than the apple but.......
This video is biased ....
I'm not a fan of harsh comments but I feel the opinions have been predetermined and the value quotient to viewers like myself feel it's losing the X factor which you used to bring to your videos a few months back. Do consider a break and come back with a bang.
I have been waiting for this because MKBHD is more of a Samsung person while MrwhosetheBose is more of an Iphone fan.😅
I don’t understand why people like these over saturated pictures that most android phones cameras take. It just doesn’t look like what I’m seeing in real life 😅 which makes it seem very fake in a way
They hate Android 😭
Yo
display should goes to Android
1:08 haha 69% battery so funny :) Anyone notice that?
Not sure why but there is a random floating heart at the side of the comments but only on this video 😅
Woww , MKBHD 😍😍😍😍
I did love the video but I loved the comment section more. It gave more perspective than the video and people gave very valid arguments, which has me thinking if there is a Mrwhosetheboss community support place idk about, if not there should be one
still the android is my favorite OS 4ever
I would use both by having galaxy s (any) or pixel ± ipod touch
So u got bought by apple as well 😆
I prefer a Samsung, for the reason that I love that how easily it can hook up to a windows or chromebook that is just my preference
They have been paid by Apple
I just switched to Iphone 13 Pro from a Samsung s21 plus and gotta say Android feels more “smart” and intuitive but iPhone does the important things better and takes better pictures
Watching with my iphone 13 pro mx 256 cash not credit hahhahahhaha just kidding
Over all even if iPhone's benchmark is higher remember a good screen is also important to process that Power and I see it in most of the Android phones.....
Nice to see this colab two legends
You cannot sideload apps on ios and for me that’s where I just stop thinking about iPhones as an option.
In my opinion both are best in their own ways, it's just what we personally want according ours tastes requirements but this was a good comparison exploring more about both Android and IOS and differentiate them side by side
I don’t know if it’s the same on high end phones but the android camera degrade but the iPhone doesn’t
This video is fuel for the mactards. Not saying apple users, saying unrationally, biased fans. Sorry, but many of us have a love hate relation with Apple. The thing is that whatever they do wrong makes me boil a bit and always weighs more than the good thing they do. It's the questionable intention and taking users as fools. I would've hoped to see a little more effort put into this video because some points you make are clearly wrong.....
Functionality = android Stability = ios
Always interesting watching you guys together. On the subject, however, I believe the iphone has the edge in that it is being made by only one company (Apple) whereas Android phones have so many manufacturers with different outlook on how/what a phone should be/have. If this was a samsung/pixel/xiaomi vs Iphone this might have been different
Complete bs video
This seemed very one-sided if you ask me. If you know what I mean 😉
I have 2 photos on my phone. One taken with the iPhone 13 Pro Max, and one taken with my Oneplus 7T. Personally, I think the iPhone has too much exposure.
Best 👍😅
Love the comparison but I wish you talked about, the phone!  What about call quality, dropped calls, switching carriers and sims, microphone and speaker quality, the ability to take a conference call, etc.  I'm considering moving to the iPhone as soon as it comes with USB-C, still hanging on to my note 20 ultra.  Love the content from both of you guys, this collab was awesome!
Its fun to build apps on android than iPhone, like you have to be rich to build an app for iPhone but you can build so many apps at lowest cost for android
1:08 nice battery percentage
Two legends in one frame
This collab best! jerry broh Need
Android vs IOS or Samsung vs Apple
id rather stick to android because i can root and stuff yes
The annual mandatory collab of my favourite two tech youtubers!!
so this video was basically the opinion of MKBHD.
Samsung stock price goes brrrr..
"Yeah, the samsung display is sharper and brighter than the iPhone's" then goes to declare the round a draw, lmao. Sums up MKBHD & his biasedness.
Fun fact: The video lasts for 20 minutes and 22 seconds. (2022, the year)
At least wear a decent trousers.
Team iPhone , I didn’t expect it to win so clearly tho 😯 Android is still also very good and I have had two android phones too but ultimately it’s iOS which takes the cake and everything around it 😄
I love my 13 pro. It’s incredibly smooth and it can do everything that i want easily.
The fact that Apple uses Samsung's oled displays so....
"could be a tie " famous last words in favor of Android  I am sorry 😔 but I am using an android and it's good for my budget  The only problem for Android right now is that they focus on features rather than user experience  I am using Android it has gr8 userexperience compared to xiaomi but app opening and closing, the low support of software support  Except for samsung  And bad processor compared to comptiton iOS, I think that Android is not improving  The last improvement was on 2018 and then they just stopped trying  Honestly I think the pixel is the future Android king becus they are using their own chip and to even get that much performance in their first chip is gr8 within few yrs when pixel is totally built by Google with the help of tsmc I think pixel can equal the iphone in terms of performance and let me tell u pixel is the smoothest Android no cap   Best of luck to pixel, nothing and samsung  And my opinion is that for 500-700$ the iphone is the best but higher I still think samsung so ..
Most Android phone receive security updates every year, only Samsung and Google receive updates every month. Apple receive prompt security updates too. As i am very oriented on security, and dislike the closed environment of iPhones, I feel forced to use Pixel phones, mostly for security reasons. Also good batteries and fast charge are a very important element for a good phone. And, do not forget the iPhones are intentionally overpriced, which is a market choice I am never going to accept...
When it came to VALUE, the fact that you acknowledged each individual, values different features differently, made me go, " yup, they may not say it all the time, but they KNOW. And that's why you 2 guys are the best."
I don’t think people really care nowadays it’s like saying who is better MKBHD or mrWhosthe boss
this is stupid AF
YouTube got  special reactions in the comments section. It's only for this video?
When you're running out of viewer's and collar with famous YouTube be like
Boss trying so hard to find a way to give android a point..!!😂
Hi
It's been cleared that MKBHD is iFan
Bad score 👎🏼 All the features that iPhone got face time ,air drop... Just don't matter some of us love how android gives us the platform to create our own desired phone that sometimes only you can understand . Now when I look at iPhones the ain't any thing unique in your phone
I'm using both phone, but android is much much better than ios
This is the most time wasting thing I've engaged in today. Pretty below what I expect in this channel.
Android takes better photos, iphone screen is just not as the same level to something like the s21u, android is more environmental friendly because it uses the same port and better at repairing, software features is better in android. That's the things that I think android should have a score.
Apple is eco conscious... lightning cable anyone?
this american is complete biased person ... why does even he talk or review anything but apple ... just ask apple to make everything everyday products for u from tea , coffee, food to toilets
U forgot to give android a point for Google assistant and the other options.
When talking about the screen you have so many options with android. When you’re looking at all Android phones the screen is MUCH better in every aspect. There are screens with more PPI, a better refresh rate, a better touch sampling rate and better brightness. Don’t understand why you call it a draw. Even my two year old RedMagic 5g has a smoother and more responsive screen than every iPhone. How do I know? I’m the only one in my family who uses android and I’m surrounded by the newest iPhones.
I think this comparison video is biased to apple
This man's ads went nuts
short answer: iphone
I would like to choose IOS cause its best for video shot's and photo's 😅
My two favorite tech YouTubers
Oh how obvious mkbhd leaning towards apple without a substantial fact. It's more about 'i like, i like, i feel'.   Aaron on the other hand is more fair.
How huch did they pay you for this?
The display discussion should've been over with "always on display" cause one has it and other doesn't.
I am one of the few that actually makes use of the split screen
You know we need more collabs
If only the software on Android was half as good and half as well thought through.
MKBHD is talking about a large number of features Android have that matters to small number of billions of Android users.. and says there is a few features on Apple that matters to large number of people out of millions of Apple users
I still prefer samsung over apple
Apple if for people that don't know how to use tech, and normally under the age of 16, Android is for someone who likes choice, value, customization and not being tied to an eco system.
I'm sure by now it works like this, people who like Iphones are boring.  People who like Samsung and have Android phones......are simply cooler and more fun
This is amazing content 👏  the two 🐐
apple fan boys who also use androids................
Apple doesnt make TVs Fridges etc
i think this video is a little Biased
This topic is getting bloody boring
I think value is easily samsung. With samsungs special sales and trade in events that go on all the time you can  buy an s22 ultra now then next year trade it for the next one and get it for like around  100$. Apple gives you a fraction of the phones actual trade in value to get their next phone. Trading in a 12 pro max for a 13 pro max you're looking at $300 dollars every year to upgrade to the next phone.
Which android phone vs iPhone? Because if it comes to it android has so many manufacturer options I would use what's available and best for you.
Really cool video, I enjoyed it!
I loved this video, amazing, thank you guys <3
Fun fact is an iPhone is being compared with whole Android, like screen iPhone and Samsung, gaming iPhone and Gaming Android Phones, Photography iPhone and Samsung Vivo and others, its pretty clear that theres no perfect package in Android or is there any?
Loved the collab. Apple definitely wins in term of software update but once they stop supporting it, a lot of the third party apps would stop working sooner or later due to minimum iOS version requirements. Android on the other hand would still received app updates and other workarounds even if they are no longer receiving os update.
Mrwhosetheboss is the kind of person where I'm not always that interested into his videos but I watch them anyway because of him
The only reason why I am never fully leaving android is just the fact how damn locked ios is out of the box. Or the feel that when you "own" an iPhone its more like Apple owns it but you can use it. It's hard to describe actually but you know what I am talking about. With Android you get way more control over your phone and that's a fact.
Love this collab
Camera =iphone  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Really????
phones with time became the same i miss the days when phones was fun
apple is a status symbol lol.
Its been a while since I've had an Android phone, even though I had the first Android phones made. I'm a simple man and I would rather take an iPhone to the bathroom than an Android phone.
A
Very good video but the judging seems a bit biased IN MY OPINION.
Great collaboration. Still find funny how IOS totally obliterated Android especially in terms of software 🤔
if you are a Iphone fan like if you are a samsung fan reply
a bit flawed
Sponsored by Apple 🍏
MKBHD Humiliated samsung by saying he prefers a model over a year old more than their new model
I usually choose Android, because of my daily work, to transfer files easily and share
Android is more like a pc in your pocket and it is more fun to use and discover what you can do with it .. it is for adventures people who likes technology ... However for iphone it is for people who doesn't car that much about what he can do with the phone and the possibilities it offers you but only cars about the few things he needs the phone for like calling chatting checking news and daily life stuff the more it is consistent the more its better and of course flexing
Two of the best tech YouTubers ❤️
Greeat Collaborate
This video is sponsored by Iphone to the max, too much push to Iphone so obvious :)
The iPhone camera is actually what turned me off from the iPhone 13 Pro Max. It's easily the worst of the top phones out. The 12 Pro Max's camera was so much better.
How can you do an operating system vs a phone?  Android is an operating system and iPhone is hardware :)
There's a point missed here. The Iphone is not flexible at all when dealing with files, documents, etc... And file sharing to android phones is terrible. The locked eco system as a whole gives you so little options when you want to buy for example a new pair of  headphones. In general android is better for productivity and gaming.  Iphone is only better for basic tasks like messaging and photography.
MKBHD is always sides with apple i don't know why maybe because he is from USA and people there are buying iPhones non stop but i don't know he looked one sided in this
Seems pretty biased sadly
Biased af bruhh 🤣 logically Samsung is way better
Alternate Title: *Samsung vs IPhone*
You can't really compare Android and IOS  in the hardware aspect of things since Android runs on millions of different devices with different specs and iOS only runs on IPhones.
I think usb-c is another huge win for Android. being able to charge everything from laptop to phone to speaker with the same cable is game changing
The dual-app feature on Android is something I personally use all the time, and would immediately miss if I were to switch to iPhone (too few Android users know about it and use it imo). Floating windows is something I also use a lot, where you can have an app window that is essentially floating on top of everything else and can be minimised (you can open up a lot more than just 2 windows as well) it's actually a very cool feature you've probably never seen before, look it up even if you're an iPhone user, it's quite interesting lol.  Such "power features" and things like file system access, is why I prefer Android. So in the end it's always up to the specific user and their needs, which is what determines which platform is "better".
I feel that you missed an important category                               Music So many people walk around listening to music which is easy to load into an Android (download, bluetooth, direct transfer, messaging, etc) and is and always will be yours. Not so much with an iPhone though, as I understand it. Unless I'm wrong there. Also how about pairing different types of ear phones/buds? Will the iPhone even accept another companies product pairing with them?     I'd be interested in that one.
12:54 shareplay, imessage, facetime... those are all things you can do with apps. I much prefer sharing my music on Spotify over getting locked into Apple.
Mrwhosetheboss > Mkbhd  In terms of content , Neutrality and everything 🙊
Android is miles behind the iPhone tbh they have a lot of catching up to do
Idk if you can ask mkbhd because he's super biased I love the Collab but arun is super unbiased and is more even with both but nonetheless I love the Collab!!!
Pls make a video on best phones under 384
Yeah, I agree with the comments. At the end of the day, it's really all about Preference. I'm not much of a camera guy, I'm more into games and emulators, media consumption, big battery and performance. That's why I felt the ROG2 was perfect for me.
After watching this video I'm sure it will catch Apple's eye
You don't need the best but the right one.
I gave a dislike when they gave it a draw for display .. c'mon how are u guys so biased for iPhone...
Its for sure iPhones are better overall in 2022. Unless manufacturers stop churning out hundreds of models each year... Android users are going to suffer 😐
Marques sleeps with all his Apple products on his pillar next to his face. It was always going to be Apple for him. Bit of a wasted video experience and time.
I strongly dissagree. Apple is very bad and is a greedy company. Android IS SOO MUCH BETTER
That collab 🎢
Marques doesnt know about phones anymore!!!!!!!
Every one knows this is just for Clicks
The GOATs.
marques sounds like a tech guru, he is enlightened by the technology!!😂
I don't think there's a 'best' option, it's all subjective to the user. Since they were basing scores around their experiences.
And and also include the specialties of Android mean I use most of the Android features on an average usage and I have also Googled the results of those people who use it nowadays a lot of people want a premium feel provided by Android phones...... And you did not include the display of Android is better because it has a higher refresh rate and higher touch sampling rate and a more responsive screen........ You also missed that the battery life in Android is better because it has a higher mah   battery then an iPhone and chargers quicker... Also the extra zoom in camera is also very useful when you want to take good shots of photos and some of the expectations I had on iPhones just faild that and and the smart AI of Android detects if there is more light exposure or not so Android is better ..
The 2022 iPhone is better than the Android Phone
This is an awesome video man it is very hard truly to decide because it’s all a matter of personal preference and taste but when it comes down to it man they are both absolutely amazing feats of technology. But if we’re going to speak from another fact Apple has the absolute best messaging app the best interface when it comes to connection to your other friends via messaging or FaceTime by far supersedes Samsung in that department. But googles keyboard is way better than Apple’s keyboard in terms of use ability,controllability, gestures etc.
Interesting outfit. Black and White
I do not care  if ios gets the best rating  i prefer android for being open and giving you the dev keys to your phone  apple is like  They own your phone your system and your software  And i dont believe the apple is private bullcrap because a company that has its fingers to its system  does not look privacy to me  i am thinking the whole privacy stuff is for the marketing mostly  also android being more open give you more options in software  More than apple will ever give to its user so i prefer android more than the dystopian ios
It seemed to me that you weren't even weighing in on it at all and just giving him the choice to where to score the point. Granted this all boils down to opinions. For example photos I feel look better on android and I have never seen a photo just dissappear after taking it, nor have I ever had an app not work well while taking photos or videos.
You don't see any ads on YouTube on an Android. Rip youtuber. I hate ads and I'm sticking with my Android.  Again the phone that you can buy is the best in my opinion.
I'm an iPhone user but I don't mind Android at all. I have an Android tablet and phone as well I use for Home Assistant Dashboard and other stuff at home and Android is neither better or worse, just different in a lot of ways. I like it.
two tech legands together
iPhone 13 pro max camera stinks imo coming from a pixel 6 pro, the quality is quite grainy and dull and I have yet to be pleased with the results except for maybe two photos on a bright sunny day
🐾 YES YES YES LOVE UR VIDS TO MUCH!!!!! 🐾

i feel like mkhd was way too biased towards apple
Who doesn't plug their phone in on a flight?
3:00 That's not something for debate, it's an architecture problem. Android is based in java, which means the apps run through a virtual machine, which consumes a fuckton of RAM, while iOS is basically C, which in simple terms goes almost right through to "machine language". That's why iPhones are more expensive, but at the end of the day are better, you pay for a cutting edge Software/OS experience.
I use my smartphone as a pc for work - split screen, floating apps so i just cannot use an iphone, but for more casual use i will use an iphone.
u didnt mention folds or flips
Here's my take: This video felt more like Samsung vs Apple, given that the is Apple vs Android I'd say there's literally an android that will beat an iPhone on anything, camera? Sony Xperia. Gaming/Performance? ROG Phone. Battery? ROG Phone. Screen? ROG Phone. Ecosystem? Samsung. The list goes on, point being, if you're truly looking for the best of the best in a specific category there will always be an android that will win against the iPhone. However some people just like the comfort and simplicity of an iPhone and that's ok, iPhones are great phones, but if you want the best of the best and money isn't an issue go android. Also MKBHD is a great content creator, however his biased towards Apple so there's that.
I need you guys to do some podcast , atleast once in every two weeks.   if you do i would dig in everyday....
iphone just wins with camera quality maybe but all the rest samsung is way better get outta here iphone winning? xd
iPhone won? Doesn't matter, most people can't buy it
And I love the look of the pictures Samsung take. Great detail, vivid colors, however the iPhones shutter speed is the best for taking pictures of an object in motion. But in terms of over all convenience and features that someone like myself does take advantage of such as the multitasking I’d go with Samsung if that was my only choice for the rest of my life. But that it an extremely difficult decision. iOS is missing some features that were in previous versions but then they also had implemented more that we’re not there. And Samsung or pretty much any android after a new release is always buggy until they do get a stable version but they will find a stable version of their operating system as well.
OhLookImma1st
A biased video with only a singular perspective being showcased.  Iphones impose control over how you use your phone. While an android phone can be played around to the very last detail in terms of OS ( except for some manufacturers who are against bootloader unlocks). Customization doesn't mean changing a wallpaper or placing a widget 😓  More over iphones may have better batter life, but the flexibility you give up to achieve that is huge. It's like using a phone inside a sandbox setup and not considering to know what's outside. It's like comparing the battery life of a feature phone against a smartphone.  The unlimited possibilities a person gets just by accessing a phones storage is mind blowing. That's a cave man's dream which is still not realized in Iphones ( never will )  IOS is stable because the manufacturer knows and controls every aspect of the hardware to software.  The reason am very confident that this review is biased is after seeing the scorecard tipped in Iphones favor even in camera category, and the most blasphemous thing - iphone 13 pro's Display is on par with a samsung🤣
I love the collab, but I'm calling foul. Eco-consciousness to the iphone? After you literally made a video calling them out for not including things in the box that just generate more waste later? Or fighting tooth and nail to keep a lightning connector which only generates more waste as everything else is USBC? Also, this is an iPhone verse android, it's iPhone vs. Samsung. One of the main points of Android is the fact that there are so many, so you really do need to compare them to the various options. If you want top battery life, can you get that on any Android phone? It doesn't have to be every, just any.
Are you trying to bait the fanboys ?
DUDE POST MORE OFTEN I MISS YAAA🤧
I had a 24 hour day
Hi Arun! This is a great collaborative effort! Well done. I really enjoyed it. As many commenters have expressed, I also think the comparisons were skewed.  If you had compared a specific flagship Android phone with a specific flagship Apple phone, it would've been more objective.  Comparing an entire Android ecosystem to a very different Apple ecosystem makes for far too many generalizations that scientifically render the comparisons extremely biased.  Yes, all your points and Mark's were valid, and I think I understood where you were both coming from. I think. Nevertheless, you both hit the bullseye of the dartboard with your collective assertion that one's choice of one ecosystem over the other is a matter of preference.   However, I wouldn't compare all the Mercedes Benz vehicles ever made to all the Teslas ever made. There are just too many variables and differences to account for that such a comparison would not only be unfair, but illogical.   Could factors such as fragility and durability, ease of maintenance and repairs, and the availability of parts (to mention a few) been included for a more detailed and objective discussion? Probably. You guys seemed to speak from your very privileged (no offense intended) perspectives.   To illustrate, when was the last time you decided not to get a phone because you couldn't afford it and not because it didn't feel great in your hand or because you preferred certain features on a different phone?  That's the perspective from which I think you both addressed the points discussed. That's not bad in itself, it's just what it is...your personal experiences and perspectives. And that's valuable. That's why we keep coming back.    Regardless of the flaws in the baseline premise that the Android and Apple ecosystems can be effectively compared, the product of your collaboration was absolutely beautiful to see. I'm not sure if this was your first time working with Mark, but I'm impressed nonetheless. Here's to more great collaborations! Job well done.
these types of videos, about apple are very interesting make more on apple  great workkkk
UNPAID APPLE  ADVERTISEMENT . THAT'S WHAT THIS VIDEO IS.
iTunes... and because of that.  I am out.
Issue I found with performance is most developers develop for iOS and then port it to Android.  Apps just run better and in some cases have more features on iOS. This hits home with a lot of the topics with performance, battery life and camera cross-app functionality.
I’ll always be an Iphone user but it really mainly depends on what you prefer. You can’t just give an iphone user an android since they may not know how to work the device after using an iphone all this time. It would also work that way with android users. It dials down to which one you’re used to and which one you use daily.
This was bias you can't compare whole android with iPhone U need to compare flagships only or a single android like pixel or Samsung...mid vid guys sorry
(IPHONE) MKBHD vs MWTB (ANDROID)
Guys, we got absolutely obliterated 😔
people bragging that Android had 8gb ram when apple only has 3gb ram  android needs 8gb ram to run what apple only needs 3gb ram to run.
Been waiting to see you Collab with JIDION, the day is finally here 😊
I think the iPhone(ios) is the best all rounder and androids are the best when you want something specific, because there are so many different Companies that use Android and they try to be the best in some part of the phone
Dude tried to pick an iPhone display over a samsung 🤡
There are things Android has that make it more compelling for me. File explorer, Samsung Dex, 3rd party app, back and multitask buttons/icons, and fingerprint sensors. I have both because of work but I always take my Samsung phone out and use the iPhone sparingly.
i think the debate is about amazing=consistent. i always choose amazing. and i dont like to be tied up to an ecosystem that you have to pay for everything. so to me its android, because there are things that android can do more than the iphone.
Theres only a few niggles with ios and they are incredibly annoying.  Why can’t you set your own songs as ringtones easily?  Why do you have to go to contact and search for everyone’s names rather than start dialling the first few digits or use T9 to find their contact?  Why is there no option to add a back button (at least in accessibility) Instead we have to do some retarded double tap to half the screen in one hand. Apple doesn’t design their software for people to achieve tasks quickly, they prefer you wasting your time doing simple things.  Why is there no option to sort out your own folders in the App Library? I never use it to this day because I can’t find anything unless it’s recently downloaded.
bro you asked a american about it . try one with average asian if you get a chance
Android should have won the customization one.
MKBHD's view is more about him than technical. As mentioned, Apple release new tech features late, saying that they did better motivating the high price. But everybody knows that this is a lie. Apple is a Box 😴. Android is outside of the box😲.
Bro this is so biased
I can see you and Marques kind of holding back up cause both of you knew you can counter the others opinion but then the video would have gotten way way longer😂. But that also made the video a little boring and weird for me. You both are yet the best tech youtubers tho🔥
I find alot of these points could have gone vice versa depending on use and preference, like split screen on android, i much prefer the feel of the samsung over iphone etc . Though its odd you basically agree that while the iphone has a great screen the samsung is better, but then call it a draw. Each to their own, for me though samsung would have won more points.
Mrwhosetheboss when he checked the time: Ah s*** it’s close to my bedtime!
Every time a video drops, I gotta watch it because there's simply a lot am learning about tech. Keep dropping them
MKBHD Loves Apples so i think we all should have known the results already.
Really disappointed with some points made here, can only agree with some
your the best YouTuber ever
Marcus looks like he doesn't want to be there
Lies Are you being paid?
Honest people 👍🏼👍🏼
as anandroid user of 10 years...i see ios already like android so yeah...better hardware
I don't even know why I even bothered with this question. MKBHD is so Apple biased, no android phone ever stood a chance against an iPhone in any category.
I think the lighting was fine. It didn't look bad but just like a regular collaboration.
Team Android
If you value options, flexibility, and having a choice to decide what you want from your phone and how you want it, it’s Android all the way. But if you need is for something that you can pick up and run with without worrying about the nitty gritty details, then iPhone is the way to go
I FEEL LIKE THEY DID A IPHONE 13 ( APPLES BEST PHONE ) VS ALL ANDROID PHONES IN GENERAL INSTEAD OF ALL APPLE PHONES VS ANDROID PHONES WHICH PUTS IPHONE 13 AT AN ADVANTAGE .
"3GB RAM on an iPhone feels like 8GB RAM on andriod", is a myth. The difference about 4GB RAM on iPhone is equivalent to 6GB RAM on andriod
I am sitting here looking at my work iPhone which I charged last night and has sat with its screen off for most of the day (I took a call earlier in the day) but yet still seems to be at half battery and I wonder how Apple could win the battery category!
As expected stupid dumb biased fanboy hater content. Android is much bigger than crappy Samsung phones plus most if not android brands mop the floor with the iPhone. You don't understand what you have in your hands, you are such a superficial user that you don't realize the huge lacks of ios
U guys are so iphone fans, u can tell. The Samsung is much better. Alot of opinion went into this vid
I mean, I feel that android has more options than Apple. Which means you've got a better chance of finding what you want.
Its just a shitty review , you guys both use iphone as your primary phone do its just a personal opinion in this case and not a real review
I prefer iPhone over Android but it’s just me. Go with whichever you feel is better for you.
Disagreed many times but it's your opinion so I can't say anything
I personally think you kinda went over a few things that were in favor of Apple. First of all you compared a top-end Iphone against a top-end Android phone, while most Android users have a budget/midrange phone. If we're gonna talk about price to performance, Android is most of the time the clear winner. Also I think it would be fair to mention Apple's notoriously bad repair program, which has gotten worse over the years. Then lastly, the  point where you were discussing the display should have gone to Android, because it technically still is the best display you can get. All in all not a bad video, just think some things should have been adressed.
For eco consciousness I think you need to take into account more of the decisions that the companies make. For example, Apple removed the headphone jack requiring people to either buy dongles or wireless headphones, even if they already have headphones. That in itself probably removes all of the other environment benefits Apple has. I'm not saying their goals aren't good and recycling is necessary bad, but I think a deeper analysis needs to be done.
Mkbhd has a huge Apple bias. It's obvious.
Hot take:  Fast charging is kinda useless. It only is great if you are always during the day near a wall outlet… but then phones are supposed to be portable. Having to charge mid day, even if it’s fast counterproductive. And also fast charging requires you to have a special charger, so it makes the chances of that working even slimmer. Same goes to wireless charging, outside US that really is useless out of home.
wow I always wanted that  collab keep up te video!!!
So where's the this video is sponsored mark?
Android is 100 times better for developers and customization
Does that guy work for Apple?
android....is better
This is the first video of mr whosetheboss that i dislike because he presented a person who thinks that Apple makes the best phone.
Notice how apple is on the right because arun is a iphone user and mkbhd is both
What's the meaning of MKBHD
Screen tie?are u kidding me?
Having both an iPhone and android as the main phone is the best of both worlds.
I don't think  iphone photography is better than android, there's so many android phone has better camera.
Finally the tech gurus address the most controversial topic! Loved this video 👌👌 Good one 👍 We would love more such collabs from you guys!
This comparision makes no sense :D you are litteraly comparing apple to everyone else, that makes no sense. The comparision should have been between apple and samsung or only focused on OS features.
can somebody tell me what's this emoji kinda thing is showing on the side while im in the comments section..?
Gawd mkbhd is apple fanboy
Really sorry for the android fans but lphone is really ahead 👍🏻
I'm still sticking with android even though I'd love to switch to Apple. Just bought the s22 ultra but I would love to get that amazing battery life from the 13 pro max. I just don't like how Apple has such a monopoly. I like to support the underdogs. I had an iphone x and loved it. Might even go back when they remove the notch next year.
There are people who don't use split screen??????
Android is literally better. horribly biased
Android👍️👍️👍️👍️👍️👍️👍️👍️👍️👍️👍️👍️
Apple fanboy mklgbtq whatever that name is
LOL
remember those iphone tutorials where android users go  pov: your here to flex android had it  now the iphone users can do pov: your here to watch angry android users 😂    not saying iphone is outright better both have features different people will like
Can't wait for twitter to be even more toxic over android phones.  And you guys forgot about Nearby share and sorts of stuff.
android is better
Apple, obvi no?
And also a lot of features of Android like this simplicity and you can also capture reliable photos on Android by a feature called shortcut for camera where your move your phone in a chopping manner to open the cameras app and you can also turn off the processing feature in the Android so you can have some more reliable photos and a lots of other features that you missed did not expect this from you i need a rematch
Apple is too boring
Completely agree Aron🔥✅
Become a more bigger fan of mkbhd for picking iphone 😍❤️
Having used both, a Google Pixel 2XL and now an Iphone 13 Pro Max, I can confirm that Android is far better
With the enforced move to USB-C standard, iPhone charging times should improve massively.  Lightning connector was always the bottleneck, but it generated too much revenue to be replaced.
Personally from my experience social media apps like Snapchat and Instagram on the Galaxy s22  have been very similar to the iPhone
Arun woke up and had this conversation straight away lol
This video is way more subjective than objective
This is 2022, why are people still debating this... Either iOS or Android, it's just your personal preference which one you prefer
Why all well weight goes on Samsung instead Android??🙊
i feel with huawei's ban androids stopped/slowed down innovations, this just helped apple to catch up and add the small features it didnt have making it now the best choice in smartphone market
THIS COLLAB IS SO GOOD
15:18  “I accidentally trigger Siri more than I use Siri😂”  Yeah that’s the quote.
I can't ever see myself using another phone other than Samsung's Note, the S22 Ultra now, because of the S-pen. It is magical for everything. The cameras are ridiculous, especially the 10X optical. There is many things I wish this phone did like the iPhone does though, combine the 2 and we would have the perfect phone
Android vs iPhone ... interesting title ... you are comparing a software (Android) vs hardware (iPhone) ... i don't see why we would need such a comparison 🤷🏻‍♂️ I will listen to the video and see what I can find 👍🏻
It seems pretty odd how you found reasons to give android the point and then decided because it wasn't from Samsung or Google it shouldn't count and then default back to iPhone.
Hi
Android gives more control to manage the stuff according your personal use on the other hand apple take that for himself because they know better what's best for you 😂
My phone had an update and removed most the features I had to edit an image. Now, I have to use a app to do the simple features I used to use. Very upsetting and annoying.
Too much biasness from MKBHD and hes not reliable gives Samsung phone of the year but still always makes videos of Apple and I knew he would say Iphone is better. Screen draw just because Apple has a slight advantage in terms of refresh rate? Bull what about full 4K screen? Notch? Etc. Or Camera features they all dont matter now???? Tooooooooo much biasness in this one and I think whostheboss felt in when speaking about camera for example
WTF is he talking about!?!?!?! my android phone lasts near on 2 days and I have NEVER gone to see my photo and its not there???  and I would ALWAYS choose my xiaomi to take pic rather than my iPhone all day long!! I agree that drop is essential I use it all the time but he is so one sided its a joke!     SUCH AN APPLE KNOB !! ( for disclosure I have both! Xiaomi 12 and iPhone 12)
Hi I love your videos personally I prefer iPhone I would be the happiest person alive if I had an iPhone my mom isn't home so I took her phone to watch your awesome videos
This is so subjective to what your needs are!!🤔🙄🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
I like Apple, but they are so expensive
Samsung s22 ultra is a better overall package than iPhone. We will see that in mkbhd final phone awards
Such nonsense
Who is better? Apple or Android? Answer : It isn't company that you're buying, It's the product. Compare what's in your range and pick the best for you. End of the day nothing matters if it's not the best for you.
I can't believe Marques makes a case for Iphone SE vs Pocophone   ...just because of facetime and IMessage.
is it worth to buy phone with 4g connection in 2022? or phone with 5g connection better?
200k views in the first 30 minutes 🤯 This video is gonna blowup
17:03 while apple does support more their phones, once they stop, you're screwed, by the next update their will be thousands of apps that simply won't work with your phone with android however, most apps requiere at least android 7, that's from like 5 years, and some even go as far as android 5, so you can still use your unsupported phone normally. so, at least in my opinion, android is better
You forgot a very important category! The  ‘repairability’ of Android vs Iphone!
give me a ipad and ipod any day but for me android phones  over apple
You got so much thinner!! Props to you my dude!
Mkbhd is biased, he spoke about features important for lot vs features important for some... apple share is farrrrr below Android's, and we're not talking about US only.  Environment... seriously? With how easy it is to repair an iPhone? (Sarcasm)  Battery: you compare the best iPhone to not the best androids.... and I'm not talking only about gaming phones   Customization? Lool, i had a hard time taking this one, I still can't though   Photo: in all blind tests, androids wins, especially if you mix multiple android phones vs the 13 pro max, the S22 ultra is the overall winner  Video: iPhone wins, no argument   Screen? IPhone??? Bwahahahahahahahahahahahahaha... sorry, but nah... androids reached 165hrz, peak brightness and so much more... anyway, numbers talk by themselves.   Features? IPhone?  Sure... yes sure   The whole is biased by mkbhd love for iPhones, it's not a video about IOS vs android, it's about MKBHD preferences
Because I study photography and android camera tweak the setting by flashlight to take photos instead of use flash
You were supposed to destroy the Apple empire, not to join them. I have failed you guys! I have failed you.
S22 camera alone kills iphone. This is coming from a guy that left the 13pro for the ultra and I was die hard I phone
At @1:56 I experienced 2nd hand embarrassment. 🤣
Both are apple fanboys
the display comparison is bullsht android obviously wins mkbhd is just kinda apple fanboy here
Taking Photos of the S22U 108MP allows large scale prints at best resolution i believe.
Aaron is the British version of Marques, hands down.
i prefer android as i dont want to spend 1000+€ for a phone and i want features over polish. and yes i can afford it i have a 2200€ e-mountainbike. i dont take photos in another app at all. i live in germany so noone uses imessage airdrop facetime etc.
Really like the video
Intellectuals giving takes on valid concepts makes me smile One day I shall be able to hold such conversations on my channel
Best video from the both of you.
It depends on people some people like Android Some people like iPhone but Android is better in some time Like s21 was better than the iPhone 12 last year not this year
How did Apple made the widget game better!!!! By far customization and widgets are androids Forte! Let's not talk about third party widgets.
This is video is clearly setup in apple's favor. Its stupid as fuck to compare a single brand of phones to millions of phones. This channel has gone to shit.
" it's a whole year old " he said... my 4,5 year old phone " gonna cry?😏"
How come the first one is a draw?? He said the Samsung is better for screens!
How About Accessories (watch/AirPods)
Android lets me do stuff apple locks iphones out of doing, like instaling APKs for games not released yet or from other regions
I am really impressed the fact that you can find seconds to breathe in-between the rounds of Apple cheers. I tell you man, it's impressive, you can even transform an iPhone into something that it isn't and hide under the coach all the futures that the Android world has over iOS. Tell me, is something, or anything else if not, that goes to Android besides the 'price'?
I have been going back and forward between iOS and Android ever since the iPhone 3GS released. What now locked me into Apple is the OS support. Having phones updating for 7 years is a game changer. I’ll stick to iPhone for now.
An Apple ad from Apple park!! what a disappointing video!!!
7:17 what is he talking about. If u took the picture it was saved but then u somehpw removed it
As a pure Android fan, I feel attacked lol
I personally disagree with many arguments made in the video... Comparing the battery life of only the latest top end iphone with all other android is meaningless. All previous iphones' battery sucks. They tell iphones have less features for majority of people. That is only in the US. 80 percent of users in the rest of the world use android and use the customisation and flexibility of android. Also most android skins have loads of features compared to iphones. And yeah.. iphone se sucks for its price. I am not apple hater..but just wanted to say  my opinion.
These both are the best tech YouTubers on YouTube  Is it correct?
Android daww😁🖤
@MKBHD Will u pls do windows vs Mac OS
Did Arun just say Airdrop as a feature Android doesn't have?
Quick share/nearby share = airdrop.
Ive been on the One Plus 7 pro since last month. Am now pn the iPhone 13 pro max and am probably getting the iPhone 14
Okay.... I don't understand in what world does iphone in the customisation category.
I felt that this was biased, A LOT. MKBHD was putting forth most points just by preference, and by looking at the comments I think that the majority agrees.   What would have been better is if they both had separate categories, i.e we have MKBHD's rating and Arun's rating
Android. Why? Cause can side load. Whta side loading apps that i used? Full version Ad block crack, youtube vanced (even though waiting for it's death)
Could this channel be more biased? :D
I'm sticking with any phone with Audio Jack 3.5mm
AS A SAMSUNG FE USER WATCHING NOTE AND PRO DRIVEN TO KILL EACH OTHER AND HOPING A WIN FOR FE ...IF U KNOW WHAT I MEAN
I wanted to know if the iPhone is better than Android for students?
👎👎💆‍♂️
🔥 📛 killer collab 😲 😱  team Samsung ♥️
wait a min, imessage even isn't  available in many big countries ....
Nice 👍 but I can't buy a +1000€ iPhone , but a 300€ android phone that has basically every software features of the flagship And I think not every categories should won the same points. Like price/airdrop it's not the same . Nice it has airdrop , but if I want it at a fair price I need to buy an iPhone from 2017...
Man it feels like MKBHD is the protagonist and Arun is just interviewing him
But it was one sided We didn't hear ur side of what u can choose aarun. I mean any person who watches tech channels knows Marques love for Tim and his reasons justify to him why he chooses iPhone always. But I feel u need another person we know is android techy say Lew for unbox therapy or Zack and we see their reasons for choosing android as well.
Two of the best guys in the job in the same video, great! Although I noticed that when android got a little edge ( like screen) you gave a draw. When iphone got a little edge (like the battery) you gave a full point to iphone. And what about eco consciousness? The great advantage of android is CHOICE and you limited it! LoL Either way, value is how the customer perceives it for your needs. So the customer is still the one to decide.  But the video helps at least to show different points to look for when evaluating your next phone.  And before any comments, I have both at home and I use both according to my needs.  The worse part is making transitions between systems since the transfers are not perfect, so it's difficult to buy a new phone according to which one would be offering the best value at that time
One more category. If the world could have only one (Android or ios) from now on which would be the best for that? I think Android hands down by far.
You sound more British than normal 🙈
You didn't mention downloading files for gamers. Betas etc...3rd party apps...
best MRWTB video
you people are comparing an operating system against an iPhone. it would have been fair to compare one phone company vs another or the ios vs the android operating system.
MKBHD (life long apple fan) and MWTB(swop to apple) determine who is better.  You just knew these two were gonna twerk for Apple.
Awesome collab, the knowledge of these two guys is top notch. Lovely watch 🫶 and yes I am an IPhone user so I’m a little biased
Android for life!
Why don't people compare pixel os with ios when comparing the software. Why always Samsung (One UI) vs ios? For me pixel os is the simplest os I've ever used.
I'm for Android..or more specifically the Note Series from Samsung. I use the S Pen and its features along with Split Screen a lot.
best collab of the year ❤❤❤
Honestly to me, it's not about "who's better" between Android or iOS. It's all about your criteria and preference for a smartphone. Because Android could have exactly what you're looking for when iOS doesn't or the other way around. 🤷🏿‍♂️
To be honest I don't think this is a fair review. In my testing Samsung phones beat iPhones in pretty much any category. Battery, camera, responsiveness, charging. It's also unfair because you guys seem to make questions in favour of the iphone judging by the video and also your other videos which mostly cover apple products
Pretty biased comparison. You are comparing $699+ iphone with android so you cannot say not all android have those features so iPhone is better. Compare with the same dollar option in android instead of generalizing
Shocker the man with the apple watch would vote for iPhone more 🤣  If you look at most phone comparisons from MRwhosetheboss, Samsung phones either draw with apple or beat them marginally, but now he's taking opinions form a person who clearly prefers iPhone, its a complete wash over with iPhone winning.... It just shows, make up your own opinion about the phone you want, everyone's views are subjective. 👍
both OS are good, but the one that you’re able to buy, and use it the way you want, is the thing that makes it better.
All depends on the user. I use android because I'm comfortable with it, and I love the flexibility (such as use of download files, obviously you gotta be careful though with viruses). However, i used iPhone before, and I love how smooth and consistent it runs. Both are great in their own way, but I just prefer android. Don't hate anyone who uses IPhone, since that's their preference
Android lovers be like : "Look How They Massacred My Boy." 😂😂
Both you guys have openly declared that an iphone is the best phone time & again over successive models & that you are diehard fans.  That's your choice, BUT Pretending to be objective as  in this video is laughable.
Safety? Security? Privacy?
They both have incredible strengths. I prefer to use my Samsung for business, navigation and entertainment. And the iphone for my private life and it’s great video quality.
The thing bout android software tho is that even if you don't update to the latest android your phone is still pretty functional whereas iPhone starts to shut down features when it stops getting updates
Noticed the S22 Ultra was on 69% battery, nice.
Hey dont write off android because motorola is gaining android market more soon
the background music is so annoying till 8:30
best collab everrrrr
Yeah the Samsung S21-22 and Pixel 6 can take photos on social media apps with the same quality as the integrated Photo Camera! So...not really into the tech as I can see? Maybe you need to do some research or really try the phones before having a say.
If you know about the word "apk", then Android will most likely the winner for you.
The two pioneers of tech reviews!
Ofcourse the iPhone is better only some delusional Android fans say it isn’t! I thought with time android will catch up but the gap is increasing every year.
What I can say is due to the myriad of options available in the android market I would go Android. Great video guys.
I've always had android devices but I'm thinking of going to iPhone when the 14 drops 🤔 any advice guys?
In my honest opinion, Samsung is better than Apple, but I personally prefer apple
On software reliability I would say I   atleast come across one bug or crash on iOS than OneUI ( and it’s only and only with OneUI coz MIUI does crashes a lot ) I save daily screenshots and screen recordings in iOS with bugs and crashes and it’s not just in third party app it is present in APPLE’s own in build apps like safari and camera app
Both the tech savvy.....🔥💯🔱
I this an ad??
With regards to the RAM / battery / etc. it's not a fair comparison - keep in mind that Apple develops a lot of their own hardware including the CPU, as well as their own OS.  This means both hardware and software are gonna be highly optimised to work really well with less resources.  With Android there's huge diversity of hardware and software so it makes more sense to err on the side of caution and go with more hardware resources rather than less.
That is apple oriented video I think you should remove Android from video tag line
I use multi-window quite often. Good to keep YouTube playing while also using my phone for other things.
Smh. Smh. This is the most biased video I have seen both Mkbhd and Arun make. You guys should have slept than make this inconsistent comparison btw apple vs android. Screen - Draw (Really?!!!) Performance - iPhone (OK. But Multitasking😏) Battery - iPhone (Aii. But fast charging🙄) Photography - iPhone (Really?!!!🤦🏽‍♂️Yearly blind test says hi) Video- iPhone 👍🏽 Eco - iPhone (Fairphone didn't matter)Smh Software reliability - Draw (fiar) Software features - Draw (Android lots of features, customisation) Software support - iPhone (cos 5 yrs update.lol)🤣 Pricing - Android (let's call it a draw) 🙄
MKBHD is completely biased, wow...  I would have split much more of these points and gave android a few, photography and environment e.g.
I still believe Android is way too good just look the variety of devices this OS can support with the list of features beyond Apple can ever provide. The user control Android can provide to their users, just like linux Android is user friendly. There are lot of things I can't do on my iPhone.  I am a iPhone user.
The customization category is a tie??!! Come on marques, you know deep inside that android can squash ios in terms of customization.
👍
Apple is way better
But Android is better
Both systems have pros and cons. People say Android is more open. True, but like 90% or so are using everything as it is, just like iOS. But for me the main advantage of Android is that I can use my phone as a external storage, with access to all my files, everywhere with any other device. Now try to do that with an iPhone. Also Android is not limiting you to specific devices. You own Galaxy? Not a problem. You can pair it with Lenovo laptop, Pixel Buds, Sony TV seamlessly. You want to have that freedom with an iPhone? Well, let me introduce your wallet to other Apple's devices.
Times Samsung/Android should win, some weird exception is made, which makes it a tie or an Apple point. This didn't come off very objective to me. Reluctantly giving Android any points. I'd hear a tech comment in androids favor, then an opinion would come in to change it. This was way closer to a tie imo and could go both ways, but slightly goes to Android.
You literally flew from UK to US just to know/hear MKBHD's biased take on iPhone 😂😂
I prefer Android, because it's not so a closed system. But I get your points.
Why is there so muxh hype over some dude who has fetish for iphones?? This is a personal preference.. not a good idea imo
how much money does Apple gave you !
Two best tech geek speaking up 😁
this video is just mkbhd rosting andriod
Photography definitely goes to android. Well in some cases it is not reliable as iPhone but the perks of having a better photo at the end is what matters the most.
The only reason i prefer android is beacause i can install apk's
I will always stay loyal to android
mkbhd is so biased lol
Mkbhd simping for iphone lmao
For most people the choice comes down to what gets their job done within their budget.
Subscribe to the channel would be__________?
My phone sometimes thinks about opening the camera app. So annoying.
How about privacy How about parental safety  Android wins hands down with degoogled phone, dns lockers and parental blockers.  Never give a kid an iphobe.
I think you forgot to mention the right to repair???
great collab! - fair enough as well 💯
If you know who's the winner (Apple) than why are you making these type of videos. Why???? Conclusion: An APPLE a day keeps the Doctor (Android) away 😂   Fun fact I'm praising Apple's iPhone means replying through an Android phone 😂😂
Marcus is a Apple fan boy snd always will be. Overall Android is still ahead of ios. He may not use Dex but that alone brings a whole different level of usability to a user.
13:53 Yes, samsung phones have Dex, they have a pen, they have all these features no one else does in the industry (until google added dex in as standard in all modern android) certain users use all these features and wouldn't consider an iphone. Iphones are very good at interacting with other apple devices, but not very good at interacting with Non apple devices. Android will connect to anything. So software features, i'd give to Android. So much variance within this OS vs the more specialised features on an iphone. Iphones are pared back, so what is in them, is used a lot.
One hour comment
as far as the custom ROM/rooting community goes, something that wasn't really covered is community provided support for devices deemed EOL by their manufacturers than can allow older devices to be used for significantly longer than they would've been otherwise, which is one less device in the bin.
My 2 favourite YouTube tech reviewers in one video.... you are WRONG!!! how can you give display a draw?? the Samsung has a bigger, brighter, sharper screen with NO notch!! Oh wait, you are at APPLE PARK recording this!! i expected more integrity gents!!
Two legends comes together.
It really is both… LMAO
Wtf
you can see that Mark sides with apple most of the time but at the end of the day he uses a Galaxy S21 Ultra. why isn't he moving to iOS? well because there's way more to the story than just simple categories.
Even when it will be 10-0 I'll never put my self in to the apple's jail. That is the basic reason. iPhones are amazing but it's just a bait
i am going to call bs on the feature category being a draw. android has always had more feature wise. plus it does have it's own "airdrop" with the "nearby" feature.
Kinda wild how many things mkbhd decides don't matter enough to give android a point for but has a flimsy ass justification to give the iPhone the point. This is just a "explain your personal preference" video, not a serious comparison.
Mkbhd is clearly a Apple fan boy everyone know that
MKBHD takes name  of iPhone  everytime you ask him like he is biased to iphone😒
I'm a Android user. But I think one of them said it. Iphone is more efficient because it's just apple no other thing so they can just work on it and they take their time for features they get them late. Android has to be used on different type of phones and companies. But for Android you have a little more customization and some features here and there.
I only choose samsung or iPhone I do not use no other android only samsung
So Marques has voted almost 100% iPhone but has been using as his mainphone an S21 Ultra for a year and a half. Have been in the same situation for a very long time...don't know why.
I was so surprised when I found out MKBHD is older than MrWhoseTheBoss 🤯
Very good video with 2 tech youtubers but mkbhd sounded a bit brainwashed by  everything going to apple. At the end of the day everyone with what they like to use but you can't really say iphone is better at everything 😂 I tried iphone but turned back to Samsung just because it has more functionalities and the cameras overall. Everyone with what they like more but can't bash android phones like this period.
I stopped watching when apple tied android with display, and when he said curved edges is not more comfortable than iPhone bulky edges. That man was biased.
The real question is what filmed this vid 🧐🧐🧐
More videos like this please. Very relax but the topics engaged the audience.
iPhone is not eco friendly they removed charger
My iPhone 6+ is the best, out of all those phones 🤣
i think you miss a few good area of each ,  pixel are amazing with spam call/text , android has custom rom  but iphone has pair locking which is better for privacy and company locking down their phone , pay store apps are cheaper. side loading app with android
None of this video feels genuine. It feels like they just grabbed anything iPhone was good at (and 2 things android was good at but side with iPhone) and put it in a video. I unsubscribed from mkbhd because of the lack of real honesty and now I'm seeing him talk bullshit in this video?
This is the best video ever.
In terms of customisation features and freedom of choice you'd be surprised what an Android phone can do, let alone a Samsung phone. So no iOS isn't nearly as close to Android. And just because iOS does something better after 5 or 7 years (and it should after so many years!) that doesn't mean Android can't answer back. And what about foldables? Not even a honourable mention....
This topic it’s really subjective, it will depend on which phone you are used to, the ecosystem, the OS, so many factors to take on consideration.
Truth be told its kind of feel one sided voting.
Why use iPhone 13 against  the least android phone instead of the best Android phone made vs Best iOS phone made I think u are all iPhone fans from the way I see it NB Samsung 21 not the best Android please stop the bias
Custom rom is one of the best feature of Android
Live in America, UK or France, iPhone is better But the rest of the is an entirely different story
In my opinion an iPhone is better value cause it has the 5 years of updates and it doesn‘t impact the performance of the phone that much and most apps work better on iOS
hmm...this video doesnt start with Arjun yelling at you. yes thats the different
Reliability and features, compare ios with the pixel series. The pixel only features just make the day.
I just recently switched from my iPhone to an Android and I have to say that the freedom I have with an Android is exactly what I was missing with the iPhone.
For the eco category, I feel like iPhone just markets their “eco friendliness” more, because iPhones are really hard to repair compared to androids and  therefore iPhone should’ve lost that category.
Yeah I don't like to be a company's bitch like most apple users, at this point is basically a cult, specially for women who use it as an status accessory
THE COLLAB WE WANTED 🤙🏻🤙🏻
These is like the most bias iphone video I have ever watched:-🤣
Felt this was biased in favour of iPhones. Just saying
this is like a huge ad for apple
I'm an Iphone User I would say Android was far better than any!
arun up past his bed time
omg the video tone is awful, why is it this yellow
i give camera to the Android definitely.. maybe videography specifically to iphone
MKB: "the most boring teams to watch are often the best ones"  Me: yeah i rather not watch the warriors shoot threes all game long smh
I kinda liked the lighting. It was something different and the change was good!🤘
how dare you say passthrough charging doesn't matter! 🤯I often drive with android auto for long rides and the phone inevitably gets hot from charging - discharging and being at 100%... this DESTROYS the battery long term... pass through charging is amazing for battery longevity. Every phone should have it for less battery swaps, both androids and iphones. Better for the environment and the user.
MarkAssBrownie kinda bias Samsung s22 ultra  is way better lol
THIS topic is SOOOO OLD and overrated!! Are we STILL talking about this? 🤦🏼🤦🏼🤦🏼  It’s all a matter of preference and what you need in a OS. Let’s let this go already.
It would end to ... Ones prefer
No mention of the Camera on the Honor Magic 4 Pro..
android lost bad but would i but the s22 over the iphone 13   hell no
Why do I feel like MKBHD is a big IPhone fan
i think that is not fair comperation ..
S22 vibration is very weak. I'll have it in my pocket and still barely feel any notifications
Battery and camera for iphone 💀
it was better to change title to :- paid promotion for 🍎 😂😂
When it comes to tech, I feel it’s best not to go all in on one ecosystem because you could be missing out on other benefits that may be taking place elsewhere on another OS.
Few categories here are just unfair. Example ecocycling or whatever it is. Other day, Mrwhosetheboss video says best eco phone goes to an Andriod company. So in that case winner would be Andriod right. So here we are comparing one comapny Apple with multiple companies at once, which is unfair
Interesting that you both didn't tal about Gesture based moving around the android phones.  I really miss it when I move between Android and iPad
for me conclusion boils down to - which phone you used to see the clock.
Apple is a perfect garden, but you can't go beyond the walls. Android is an endless field, but you're bound to find some weeds along the way.
I just switched to iPhone after using two Android phones for the past five years. I had an iPod before that so I got experience iOS to a degree as well.   There are things I really like about android phones and there are things I really like about the iPhone. At this point, whatever you pick is personal preference as I don't see one as being far superior to the other.   Yes, app experience and iMessage are certainly better on iPhone. The setup process was so smooth and the quality of life features are very nice.  Android has more flexibility and bleeding edge tech that make it really fun for people like me to experience. Also I really enjoy Google Assistant. That is so nice compared to Siri.   For now I'm sticking with iPhone but I imagine I'll go back to Android in the future. Keep things fun!
Apple all day over android
Nothing against the both of you But i think marques opinions had a lot more preference for the scores not that hes biased but it would hav been a fair comparison if u would also have given your preference like mkbhd telling photos is better on iphone😬(which i was surprised) where in even ur test we saw which won and also display, eco,multitasking which is a lifesaver, and lockscreen better when did not even mention the home screen  etc  Any way nice content Arun
🤦
What about fukery? U didn't rate fukery? If an android goes wrong, you can fix it. If an iPhone goes wrong you are at the mercy of apple
Most of these categories are won by iOS for the sole reason that the apps are optimized for them, there are only few iPhones and a lot of Android phones. If that wasn't the case, it would be a draw all around, and I still think iPhones are overpriced to this day. There are many good alternatives to iPhones in the Android market, that meet just any need you want (from powerful phones for gaming, to good screens and refresh rate, to good camera).  But nevertheless, it all falls down to personal preference, nothing can beat that and there will never be no more people using iPhones or Android phones, which is a great thing because it guarantees competition, and that gives a better value for the customer.
iPhone better
4:40, I agree, but I hate how you have to be conscious of what brick you use.  For eco-cousciousness, two things come to mind: - Right to Repair & other things that make old phones good. - End of Life Recycling: Apple has that recycling plant in the Netherlands which should save a lot of energy since it's much more energy intensive (and non-renewable material saving) to mine fresh rare earth minerals.
I personally think iOS is very good for the masses: a fair experience if you're looking for something simple and straightforward. Android can be that as well, but the choices it offers (in both hardware and software customisation) may fit the general public but also tech savvy people.
Easy win for iphone. With what Samsung is planning though, I'd like to see this comparison 5 years from now.  It's rather contrasting though that MKBHD gives all of the credits to iphones but uses an s21 ultra
As much as I love and been a long time viewer of both of these guys, I could see Marques's love for Apple kinda tilted this video a bit.. but again.. a very informative video nonetheless 😌
The battery award definitely shouldn't be going to apple, considering all the fuss around the older models. Even the software and display. Android is the clear winner Could've added security and personalization as well. One for iPhone one for Android
Which is better? iPhone or Android, debated by two iPhone users...
Not fair one side view
“This would be TIE” the last one…. Looks like MWTB is testing MKBHD, if he goes blindly for iphone again. Smart work
2 secs in the video my prediction is they will say "it depends"
Linux + Custom ROM users when iphones are called "customizable" ☠️
Tbh Marques for me feels like the big brother whoose very like a wise man whereas Arun is just the younger brother whoose just jumping aaround and laughing! But I love both of themm!!! Loved the video mate!!
It's more of a what MKBHD thinks is better.
This video would actually be informative if they weren't always guarantee to carry an iphone as their primary phone. Ngl, feels a little biased
When I take still photos with my iPhone 13 PM, I totally miss my S22 Ultra… it’s camera is rock solid. Video - different story. 😂
In my opinion if you are a person who can put a lot of money for that small thing like working in companies and stuff. They can go for iphone cuz it is all rounder in most of the things. Other persons who have some personal decisions like they want bigger battery or nice display or gaming they can choose whatever they want in Android that's it. It is like no one is better than them
trigzolt said this ios has lack if control but a lot of os stability meanwhile android gives you a lot of control but you lose stability
he is *using* mobile from 2021 you get shocked, me using 4 years old mobile still rocking
Idk man for me android seems like better
Apple fanboys video for apple fanboys.
iphone is just top teir
subscribe for a pizza
Love you both
This was pretty biased towards apple, which is fine, just stating the facts. Samsung screens are far better than apples, there's no comparison, and you didn't give a point for the Google assistant vs Siri. Customization is also no comparison, especially just from a software perspective. Otherwise pretty fair.
I hope Google is watching this
nice
I pick Android since Google assistant is my only friend 😭
I love the iPhone, it just works how i wanted. I don't need a fancy split screen(some might use it everyday), I don't need too much cameras on the back ( macro, portrait lens) because the quality ALWAYS disappoint me. Used to love and Android because of the customizations that they offer, as time goes by, I don't need it anymore.
yes, it's all about personal division 🙂
i love when 2 nerds collab
*Android is winning* Arun- Lets call it a draw...
DISPLAY POINT GOES TO ANDROID! SAMSUNG HAS 2K + 120HRZ + BIGGER,BRIGHTER AND MORE PIXELS THAN iPHONE .HOW TF COULD IT BE A DRAW!?
I prefer Android because i am a student I can't afford I phone but there are better Android phones cheaper than iPhone and do all my work
I really hate the way the apple ui. i genuinely hate it, it is the worst, However it is a lot smoother and faster then android
Crazy how this is basically Apple vs. everything
Yeah we need more Arun + Marques collabs
THIS COLLAB YAY
This is how nerds hangout.....😂😂
Nonsense
i play games while watching youtube.,., XD
Good video but there were far better arguments for you to have made for android against ones made for iOS it just felt like you gave in rather than having an actual discussion, quite disappointing to see tbh
Why? Please for future collabs pick anyone but him or that Unbox Therapy Guy. I like your content because it is thourough and unbiased.
Today's video was brought to you by MKBHD and APPLE
*Watches video *Doesn't agree *Likes the video *Leaves
Samsung users rn:👁👄👁
nice idea but left too much out for my taste.  Good effort late when you two were tired though.
Airdrop = Nearby Share (Samsung). FaceTime = Google Duo (available on all phones) Imessages = Google Messages (literally offers the exact same thing except reacting to messages...)
I knew from the start where this was heading... MKBHD was always going to root for iPhone, hands down!🤘
I already knew apple was gonna win because MKBHD is an apple fanboy 😂
IPhone 13 Pro max display is nowhere near even the s21 ultra
what a waste of a video
My god The feet kissing on the iphone is above average in this video
Super Disappointed.
you should do a samsung vs huawei or iphone vs huawei
I don't have anything against iPhone. I just personally have always loved the customization in the androids. I have a OnePlus 8T. I love the warp charging, it's so important to me in a phone. All the other features I feel like are slightly better for me than iPhones.
For me the Android is far better than ios because of freedom
No joke i just go for Android, bcs i like a custom roms, i dunno I'd like to do that even installing the same apps every single time, but i just like it... Iphone just borring
Once in a lifetime video, seeing two biggest tech youtubers in a single frame. Loved it 😘
As an Android user this breaks my heart :(
You guys should do this more often especially when phones are out and on software comparisons. loved this
Everytime I take a picture of someone with my Samsung, they freak out and ask what phone that was and for me to send it to them. Imo it's not even close, iphone users prefer my photos to theirs always
I think this is very biased
MKBHD: iPhone top of the class!
"you have an hammer, everything looks like a nail" LMAOOOOOOO🤣🤣🤣🤣
Apple, just because of the ecosystem for me personally. I used to fiddle around with Intel PCs and Android phones for 10+years and this year I switched to Apple with a MacBook, an iPhone and an Apple Watch. Never going back to Android/Windows for quite a while. The ecosystem is just genius and make my life actually a lot easier.
I feel like they both already use iphones so it wasnt surprise that iphone would win
ios is dumb
why don't you include tecno mobiles in your videos although i use the latest tecno camon phone and im really satisfied with it
The GOATs collaborated on the same video, so it has to be the best.
I use both, but I prefer Android.
How can iphone lock screen be consistent when it just started in ios16? 😂 This is so biased. I had both phones in my hand and my S21 Ultra is Soo much fun to have. And I never took a picture then a week later it was gone. I never had that problem.
I feel MKB is paid to market Apple products lol.
Pixel is the best in photography better than Samsung or Apple period
No products is better in this world … its all up to ur usage and work .. I luv android & ios .. i like oneplus modes & iphone ✨💕
MKHBD really fought for IPhone on this one💀
The best phone is the one you can use.  If you find Android easier and it has the specific features you want thats the best. If you find iOS easier and it has everything you need then that’s best.  I’ve had and used both I didn’t like old iOS and switched to android for a while but I got tired of the patchy support I personally got and some got the 2nd Gen SE it has everything I need from it though it’s far from the best phone.
MKBHD really sounds like a beginner to phones here. it even looked like the boss thought the same. Best value (pixel phones) like are you for Real? Many of the points are preference. As example i would rather have 9.5hours battery and really quick charge times than 11hours and extreme slow charge. Im not a fan of Android 12 compared to my good old oxygen but the look of the interfaces is soooo much Better on Android and even Better when customized Also for the elders (they might need a little help to set it Up for Them). But i Will give durability to iPhone. Camera is 50/50, iPhone takes pictures that comes out good very often and (some) androids takes just as good pictures with more features. But the fact that MKBHD is giving 2.5 to 7.5 is Crazy
I think imma get an iphone
My take to this is-  In US the best phone is iOS just because everyone uses it. So that's why MKBHD's opinion was more based on that.  However outside US markets, Android has the main market. So it's not a minority in many of the categories.
People lives in States are always biased with iPhones the main reason is that it's damn cheap and most of them didn't use any other phones in their whole life so at the very first place the purpose of this video is fully defeated! That's one of the biggest reasons I unfollowed MKBHD!
IPhone is better in almost everything, but using a old Samsung 🤣
Already knew who's win it because Mkbhd is apple fanboy 😂  Like from his first answer leave Arun speechless 🤣
I acknowledge the fact that iPhone has the cutting edge over Android in a most categories per se, but I personally couldn't be bothered with any Apple product. I am not really a big smartphone user, I don't take photos, I don't take videos, I barely play any games. All I care about is a good and more importantly CLEAN screen and the pricing. Apple is significantly more expensive in the low end comparison and has the world's ugliest nodge. I also hate the fact that all my USB-C cables are basically useless if I'd get an iPhone. It's not really a hard choice for me personally, I will always default to Android.
Wow, always thought MKBHD was an Android guy. Refreshing
19:30 If you called that a draw, as a Barcelona fan I would’ve been fuming ngl! 🙂😂
Every iOS person like this comment if you prefer iPhones
That's a bad video, should be ios vs andoid or iphone vs specific phone. How can you compare anything between one phone vs hundreds
I have to disagree with mkbhd on the one where he said the IPhone's 120hz feels more fluid than the Samsung's. I have used both in person and the Samsung has a faster scrolling rate which just makes the phone more fluid. Even Arun said that Samsung's 120hz refresh rate feels more fluid then the iphone's in his iphone 13 pro video.
I honestly feel like mkbhd just prefers iPhone all the time. It doesn't feel genuine.
@MKBHD bro you hardwork paid off 👍
Apple fans anyone here ❤️
I am an iPhone user and a happy fan but honestly I don't agree with most of this android is almost or even better than iPhone in a lot of the caregories
The video was completely off brand for Arun  He wants the video to be as precise and as enjoyable as possible  Well, this one completely obliterated my expectations
Im on android
Give me my 20 mins back
I love my iPhone so much! It has everything I need and the level of polish and reliability is ahead of anything out there. This video is spot on.
When on Android or an iPad, I use multi-window ALL THE TIME and love that option. But, again, it all depends on if you have a use case for it.
Love the Video I had the Iphone XR and switched to the Samsung 21 ultra and still find myself using The iPhone, There wasn't a single topic I disagree with
All very valid points. My thought is more along the lines of "what does the majority actually use?" I think 90% uses it's device for calls, messages (text, email etc) and social media. Once set up, I don't think average users use a device to it's full potential.
Unfair results Edge detections,zoom, display, charging...and lots of features goes to the s22 ultra
Loved the video Arun, great insight from both of you.
This is Samsung vs iPhone though...
You did not mention resell value for used iPhone when talking about price.
Está tan sesgado

It should be Android vs iOS  Or S22 Ultra vs iPhone  This is confusing comparison
I think the decision comes to the ecosystem, I have my life in the Google ecosystem so I could never switch and have the same experience. The same goes even harder for iPhone users, Apple locks you in hard.
There are many things that can go either way, so it often depends on one's subjective opinion and we know MKBHD is iPhone apologist, so it's not an unbiased comparison. For example, I get 1 1/2 to 2 days of battery life from my S22 Ultra. Everyone is different and will have different opinions based on what they know what to do with their phone. Bottom line, at the end of the of the day, you are very limited as to what you are allowed to do with the iPhone. I was in IT fir 30 years and we used to lock down computers, so that users couldn't change configurations. Reason we did that? Because most users were don't know what they're doing. Apple is doing the same thing. They feel they know best and users need to be locked down.
I'm a 12 year Samsung/Android user that's never owned an iPhone and I've already decided this Note 20 Ultra I have will be my last. Getting the iPhone 14 pro max when it launches.   I think iOS has always been better than Android but the Samsung hardware was ahead of Apple. I think apple has finally closed the gap in hardware and there isn't any competition anymore. I'm excited for the apple ecosystem and the apps. The main reason why I'm leaving Android is simple. The apps RUN LIKE SHIT. Instagram, Spotify, Chrome, and many others just crash like crazy and run like dogshit on Android. I'm done with it.
The thing people need to realise that IPhone singlehandedly always stays on top vs Huge number of android phones from variouuus companies.  🤷‍♂️
I always hate the Apple vs Andriod, coz Apple is one and Andriod is everything else.
Android any day, but if I want best mobile for photo than Huawei is number one and now Sony Xperia I IV. That's why Android. And about stability I never had any glitch on Huawei ,Xiaomi ,Sony and now on OnePlus 10pro perfect experience.
The absolute GOATs of the tech review world!!!
Android better
Sorry but screen is so much better on Android if we are looking top tier
As long Samsung Google and every other Smartphone Company uses Android, they are always going to lose.  Android just sucks as an OS. Just written in an inefficient and old language... like to compare Android with Minecraft no matter how much RAM or Power you will give the Game, it´s always going to have those microlags like every Android Phone. An Completly new and modern Operating System for "Android Phones" could potentialy beat Apple easily.
I game on an IPhone 6s and I am gonna say it power efficiency is a problem but overall it’s still a great experience. With good Wi-Fi and good battery percentage it goes smoothly
at the moment i like android more for my use case
Multi-window is cool for watching live events while simultaneously chatting on wtv site like let's say discord
You are asking a apple boy so he will pick I phone anyday
Need a "flagship value" test... Ie-. Which one you won't HAVE TO replace, etc
Here is what i know with ios and android base on my experience IOS: tells you how to use the phone Android: you tell it how you want to use it.  These are the the observation i had thats why i quit on IOS  Lock screen widgets has always been with android they ios made it better but android can still make it much better  One more is the back, home and options button at the bottom screen, these are always available and there is an option to customize for swipe for home, but the fact that i dont need to search and reach for the back and home button especially in different apps, in android I always know that the back botton is always at the bottom left of the screen is also the deciding factor.
I love your videos
yeaghh
Why this is Android(Software) vs iPhone (hardware)?
the person who shots videos in 4k or 8k his chanal name is called MKB 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣HD not MKB4k
Hii
This is definitely a topic worth travelling from UK to US to film. .
I'm still using split screen feature!! It's so unexpected that u guys don't use this great feature c'mon...!
lol if we are talking repair  its a no no for iphone👎
Did… Did Marques went for a fist bump in the end there without response?
Man you can't give point to i phone for photography. I really disagree with that
Camera better then Android is very biased imo
Actually samsung is also working in features like Air drop which iPhones have. You can share anything pretty easily with anyone who has a samsung phone using Quick Share or to a non- Samsung phone using Google's nearby share. I share files from my computer to my samsung phone using samsung flow which is also very fast! Yeah probably it won't be as good as apple's but here Samsung is trying to work with different companies to work this out (Google, Microsoft, etc) but Apple has to work within themselves.
You can't compare iPhone to to team  android,  I have Samsung and pixel and they are very different to me. You need to compare all separately
Most iconic tech collab of all time!
android no need to have the debate at all
iPhone 14 Pro Max Lom moi May 2027
I mean you have same thing as airdrop on android though its an app that you download
Not another iPhone android war 😭😭😭😭
MKBHD feels like biased, I can only agree with software department & battery in I phone, everything else easy Android
AirDrop, FaceTime and Imessage are only useful, if you only know Apple-Users. All these features have more open Android equivalents.
I was samsung for my whole life, just got 13 pro max.  will Never Go back
On the iPhone, it's like I'm a bird in a cage and I hate it
i want iphone vs android but china edition like what chinese people think about iphones
Android features outrun ios, because android is limitless when it comes to software, you can go crazy with customization, you can go crazy about anything the hardware can support and you are good
Android all day everyday....
I don't really agree with your Apple's assessment of being a more environment friendly company than android counterparts just on one metric. As an environmental economist, let me assure you that there's more to it than just being carbon neutral. You should have factored in how Apple locks their repairs and if you have two same broken iPhone models you can't pick up some parts from one and other parts from other to make a completely working iPhone. With android, that's a real possibility. Apple parts become e-waste because of this but Android offers more possibilities. Then there's the question of not using type-C.  You could have done much better assessing this.
android has the highest screen frame rate
About Iphone RAM. Try to download somthing anf lock the screen) It will just cancel downloading even with 6gb of ram. Amdroid will not.
note: you can't compare "iPhone to Android". Its like comparing "Toyota to Cars". You can only compare phone to phone. I love both OS's. I choose android simply for ease of use for what I do. I use dictation MOST of the time and the iPhone adds an extra button press that is totally annoying. Also, I love the quick access to instant google search (vocally) and also google assistant is drastically better. I do wish you could combine the phones. Love iMessage and Facetime.
Videos for me go to the iphone, it's squeaky clean.
2:23 Genshin Impact?
The fact that both of you doesn't use split screen multitasking, and I do sometimes when I make video chapters, maybe translating something. It's good. Also Great Collab, hope we see soon a Collab with LMG/LTT.😁
See the thing is in camera i agree that the iPhone has better overall compatibility but if we are talking professional photography Android cameras (i.e S22 Ultra) have a larger sensor and all the android phones have pro mode which is very useful in the professional world because you can change the ISO, Shutter Speed, Focal Length, White Balance etc. So I would prefer android, but that's just my opinion.
I would love an older iPhone vs midrange android comparison. Around the €350 range.
Apple is Apple Android cant beat it at all
He likes iPhone even from the way he speaks
I still love my samsung phones though but I definitely should try using an iPhone. Thanks Arun
I think Samsung is Better then Iphone
My main reasons for android are the headphone jack and the ability to force desktop websites in my phone browser. Some sites will just not load you full res images on Safari or other browsers on the iPhone which is absolutely not acceptable when you try to access online auctions and need to make sure what you are bidding on. Neither is it acceptable to use my only port for listening to music in a worse way nor not having an option to insert an SD card. But that goes for most flagship devices now. I used iPhones before and currently write this from an Macbook.
Boxers vs. briefs - its a matter of personal choice.  I have an Apple phone and an Android tablet;  wife has an Android phone and an Apple tablet.  As the tech support person for everything, I prefer the Apple stuff, but Android also works.
The average selling price of an android can't be higher than like 600-700 USD. iPhones can be lower than like 900 USD.   That makes this comparison very difficult.
The main reason that’s turning me off for apple is the ecosystem that their  trying to trap the user wether it’s consciously or unconsciously. I just love the freedom of choice with android. If Samsung decided to make a feature thats really dumb or disliked,you can just go towards another brand but if its apple, if they make weird stuff that you don’t like,your either just gotta get used to it or just wait a while for their next release which ‘hopefully’ fixes it. Basically i despise it when company gets too greedy and try to make it so that literally everything you own is from them. I love(and hate) that apple does do a lot of things well,I just don’t like their attitude about it.
But mkbhd is kinda bias, not kinda ,alot bias.
Tim cook will be so glad that you guys did this  comparison 😀
MKBHD is very calming here, and I love my brother!
A very subjective perspective from your side. I think Android is a lot better in most of the things and is clearly the winner here.
We gonna ignore the s20 ultras display issues that every user is facing
I appreciate what you were trying to do here and to evaluate each phone according to the categories discussed, but more and more people don't buy phones based on equipment, but on ecosystem. I'm so far down the Apple rabbit hole that I'll admit I'm not impartial. I have been tempted by some of Androids offerings (i.e. foldables) but you could show me an android phone that has a camera that can take a portrait of an alien on the moon's surface and I wouldn't take it and give up all the functionality that the iPhone offers. Also, one category that I feel you should have covered was security and privacy. BIG consideration when deciding between the two.
THE AIRDROP THING. XIOMI ALSO HAS THEIR VERSION OF IT (sorry for capslock)
Android is open source, IOS cannot match. Android phones have freedom : easy root access, custom roms, install apps from everywhere; IOS cannot match it. My phone doesn't display ads, anywhere, at all systemlessly and without any additionnal app; IOS cannot match. I can repair my phone (8/10 repair score), the Iphones can't match that. I have a headphone jack, micro sd card, 120hz, ir blaster... The iphones can't match.
I think it’s obvious that Marques is more of an Apple fan and Arun is more Android.
Two most loved tech reviewers in a single frame. ✌️
I disagree here a lot. If you can get an Android Phone that is top of the spec you want you are better off than use an iPhone that is only near the top. The thing you compare is one company to many other. E.g. if you care about the environment you would buy a Fairphone. It's not very objective to compare Apple with an average off all other Manufacturers. And I don't understand this argument about usability. The S22 Ultra Display is better in every way. If you like Apple more it's okay. But not objective.
this sounds like a sponsored video by apple to make iPhone look better. you can not tell me iOS is better, even on the last point they were trying to make it a draw XD
In terms of consumer choice i'd say Android. For those who buy consoles instead of PCs because PCs are too complicated its the iPhone that wins.
Despite how this was supposed to make it clear that Apple is better, all it did was say "Apple isn't the best in *category*, but it's better than the average!"
The last aspect is the only thing I care about the most lol.  The day Apple releases am actual good and 'modern' value for money phone at 30K INR, I'll be seriously considering switching to it. Until then, it's Android only.
The customizability, flexibility and feature set of a Samsung S phone makes them better for me. They are a Jack of all trades. Sure, they don't master everything but they get damn close
I follow both of your channel but I have to disagree with giving a tie to the display category. The notch seems to have little weight in evaluating. I think it's the ugliest design ever and people torelate it more because it's Apple. Every phones are moving away from it. Apple will remove it too in the future. That's the prove of being an undesirable feature but Apple is not capable of, or not too profitable in doing it sooner.
So you traveled to California just for phone comparison?  Nice
Why can’t we be friends, why can’t we be friends
This is the first video of you which i didn't watch till the end, you two are talking on behalf of everyone, like this is important this is not, you don't know what people prefer, so didn't expect such a low quality subject from you Arun.
Nice video👍 i would like a video comparing budget android and budget iOS around 300-500$
I like and own both. Use both and be happy.
If the end result is personal preference, then please tell us beforehand. 🙂
“Android” isn’t a phone it’s an Operating System… ‘iPhone” is a phone… the first thing you compare is ‘screen’. There are hundreds of different Android phones so this comparison doesn’t make sense. iPhone 13 PM is way better than the Pixel 6 Pro screen but the Samsung S22 Ultra is probably better than the iPhone 13 PM. Just a weird video.
@9:45 hell no, to Android. Reparability is close to non existent with Apple.
Iphone sucks in many ways.. Only great with videos
I was waiting for this lol. This is going to be interesting.
I've been a long time google pixel user. I've had the pixel 2,3,5,6. I've never had a single issue with any of the pixel cameras and I have taken over 20k pictures. It has saved all my pictures besides the night picture on the pixel 2,3 are pixelated. The downfall is that they aren't really big on gaming but make up for picture quality. But they've used quite reliable software and it doesn't crash often.  I use android beta for Android 13 and it has a software bug every so often but not much
Oh i can't wait to see the war in the comment section
For me, both are the best
I've been with Android since 2011, but I slowly started to get into the Apple ecosystem, I had my IPad snice 2018 and it's still going strong, I've used the iPhone 12 for two months is the best software experience I've ever had
This a iPhone propaganda bull****  The man is just a apple fanboy .
Regarding sustainability, the iPhone scores even better because they receive significantly longer software updates. However, the easiest way to become more eco-friendly would be to increase repairability.
I think this was a bit biased especially with MKBHD, but still loved the video
This man rides iphones D so hard. Must be paid by them 😂
Lol 😆 Apple owns MKBHD these days 😂
the thing is that android phones are actually being innovative while apple keeps everything boring with same looks most of the time.
Woww 2 idol in one vdeo 🥶
Isn't this a one sided video?
The Collab I've been waiting for!
I love that he always wear a short
Did I just not get rick-rolled on a video on "this" channel?   That aside, I was surprised on the collab. I wasn't sure if it was a MKHBD or Mr.Whosetheboss video when I first saw it.
In Samsung if you touch clock in the lock screen, it shows all your widgets in your lockscreen....
I think we are going to see a lot of android supporters in the comment section on this one, simply because there are just flat out more android users.   Personally, however, I recently switched from a Samsung s21 Ultra to an Iphone 13 Pro Max.   Battery life is by far one of the most underrated things about iphones. On top of that, even though the ecosystem "locks you in", the ecosystem itself is so well thought out and integrated that it makes my life genuinely easier, and I can do the things I want to do more efficiently.   Sure, Android can be customized more, and you have more value options, but with Apple I truly feel like im a part of a community supported by a very thoughtful company, rather than a company that might be more focused on having the most megapixels or the closest zoom.
The perfect colab doesn’t exist is what I would say if I didn’t see this
Samsung dex makes Samsung better
Android is an OS. iPhone is a brand of phone that is hardware and software. Are you comparing apples to apples? Or, are you comparing an entire industry of android phones against one company?
On the batery test you took samsung won
Good vid, but I feel like a lot of answers didn't look out for android competition. Apple is beaten by Android in many categories, but it doesn't seem that way because of their advertising.
There are features on samsung,i Cannot live without like edge panel.I least iphone when after XS..never went back.i feel more productive,and as I'm using s22 ultra, love the screen and sharp corners like note series.
Alternative title:   "Android vs iPhone - Which is ACTUALLY Better? (ft a guy that is on Apple's payroll)"
iPhone 13 pro max user << amazing battery and reliability of the phone. It’s SUPER expensive compared to copious choices on Android. I’m often left wondering at the software differences between Apple and Android with Android VISUALLY far better with lots of options and eye catching personalisation.  I feel safe with Apple but looking forward value for money I may well move to a mid range Android in the future.  I would like Apple to give its users a bit more of a fun experience, that might sway my opinion. Bulk standard calendar is visually terrible in my opinion.  Bulk standard mail also visually terrible. Siri…never used it as it’s terrible! Brightness of my display-not as good as Android. Music playback-lacking personalisation and behind compared to Android. So, not all good for Apple. For me IOS 16 needs to move us back up to be able to retain customers for this price bracket. I guess time will tell. An interesting post and very timely! I think a lot of users from both platforms are looking at the competition thinking it might be better on the other side. For me pricing and keeping users engaged (definitely battery life usability for a mobile device! It’s not good having a zippy charger if the battery can’t last..!) is the future. Interesting post thank you ☺️
I love how we automatically put iPhones up against the millions of androids (as if they are one product).   iPhone 13  has a better camera “android phone (7) has super zoom” iPhone 13 has great battery “android phone (4) has a 5 day battery life” iPhone 13 has a great screen “android phone (23) has the best screen” Great collab though.
The video concept was kind of leading to the outcome from the beginning. Let's compare Android's average with it's billion shit phones to iOS' average with one premium launch per year.
This is a bad comparison! You're comparing a phone (iPhone) to an OS / multiple phones (Android). If you want to have a fair comparison you have to compare two phone series like iPhone vs. Pixel or Samsung phones
End of day, most iPhone buyers purchase it for prestige. Not for its bleeding edge tech. Only hardcore users would appreciate all the technicalities of these phones which are mostly unnoticeable to general users. Tech gurus should put themselves in the shoes of normal daily users sometimes.
Customisation is terrible in iOS. 👎🏻 android is still better than iOS in this context. By the way I’m iPhone user.
lovely collab best of both worlds in reviewers and os
I thought the comparison worthless, but if you only count flagships, it definitely worth it...
I disagree android is better marquess is just a sheep for example he mentioned stupid things how apple is better and then saying dex and other stuff ain't important simply dismissing
Late isn’t a problem…lighting didn’t suck…it was great video
imessage and facetime are not features, they are apps which north americans rely on a lot, and their alternatives are used all over the world. So this cannot be used as a reason to give more point. Moreover, nearby share does work as well as airdrop and it is available on every android phone running android 6.0 or up.
CAP!!!!ANDROID_BETTER(ONLY_BATTERY_AND_IOS16_IS_GUD)
Where's all my android peeps?! LETS GO!
Great collaboration by my two favorite tech reviewers/YouTubers! This space in YouTube is relatively drama free (which I truly appreciate) but you both provide excellent quality, informative, and entertaining content in an otherwise boring-ish (at times), redundant, and stats heavy content category.
15:03 You forgot Celia!
About software support I believe android has to win cuz most apps on iPhone stop support even tho they could be runnable .. hope you see this
90% of video they talked aboyr iphone, i thought it was samsung vs iphone not iphone features
Just Two apple fan boys comparing android vs iPhone
I wouldn't give it to the iPhone for eco friendlyness
You have no idea how happy you boys make me when I see you collaborating
Resuming the video: black guy thinks iphone is better but uses a Samsung daily 😂
Whaaaaaat, mkbhd saying the iPhone display is very close to the Samsung😅😂🤣. That display is stupidly weird and antiquated, even budget android phones has way better display than that thing
I swore to stop watching this types of content the iOS Vs apple stuff yesterday but this got me hooked once again maybe after this video I'll keep me promise to me self 😶😋😋
Arun is an iPhone fan
Android's an OS, iPhone is a device. let's compare iPhone with any other phone that runs an Android!
I LOVE APPLE APPLE APPLE! No way android!
I prefer Android because it leaves more freedom to the user, and because i hate the iOS UI. But i use both and always have 2 phones with me. I also hate the notch.
Should do this with someone who doesn't have a clear iPhone bias. I enjoyed u stayed unbiased but mk clearly has an iPhone bias
The most productive crossover in the Techverse and its non other than Arun-Marquess combo 🔥
Is funny that after forty minutes of being realised it has 2.2k comments
I feel the comparison was kinda bias though But nice 😌
I DO USE split screen multi task even knowing that it would lag my phone too hard considering that it only cost less than 500 dollars
The obvious issue is that iPhone is only one phone, while Android has lots of manufacturers and is not a monopoly. So what are you comparing? Samsung versus iPhone?
Good evaluation. But i still prefer Android. There more freedom & flexibility. 😊
Till date I never used iphone.. But I am going to buy iPhone this year
I really don't get how the 'display'was a draw.
I would say if you compare apple as a whole to android as a whole (or even just Samsung as a whole) for environmental impact id have to give it to apple because there are so many extremely low tier android phones out there that are basically trash, apple keeps a smaller range and every phone is actually gonna work well.
Done Wow i love you both from Uganda
Clout farming gonna be hard 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
so Its basically iPhone vs all other best Android phones..!!!! nice..!!!!
*Tech kings* ❤️‍🔥😍
The 2nd and 3rd i disagree. Android will have more photo clarity and fast changing. Anyways, iPhone Can't Beat Android. It's a universal Truth and that guy is angry that Android can beat iPhone easily haha 😂😂
ios vs android: proceeds to compare scree, camera, and batteries
(Make this a top comment to know): Arun which phone do you use!
Can’t believe Apple won the comparison by a landslide. I thought android would put up a good fight.
Alot of these cases are bias as they edge to senarios favoring iOS. But android is levels above iOS on my eyes.not because you all don't multitask don't mean majority of us don't
Comparing one brand with an entire market.....
I'm a bit disappointed in this video. It was clear from the beginning that this will be biased but some points really didn't make any sense and i expected more from 2 of the biggest tech YouTubers
All the phones are really Gucci so I think it’s a tie either way lol
Great notes on the battery
Hats off to you guys for the collab ❤❤👋👋🙏🙏
I'll still go with s22 ultra..
For the first time switched your video off  half way through.😑 Boring.😬
Don't get @ me iPhone fan girls. If you like the iPhone, more power to you.  I'm currently and is my first time using an iPhone. Been using my 12 pro max for over a year.. Yeah they are good phones but HOLY FUCK is Apple too strict and just overall boring when it comes to iPhone features. I'm going back to Android soon.
What a bias video...
It’s amazing to see my two fav YouTubers together 🤩💯
eco consciousness is not worth a full point... imo that's like an extra perk.
How in the fuck does iPhone wins display
No Rick roll?😢
Apple can make the best phone in the world, I'm still not giving them a penny until they allow you to actually use your phone like an adult instead of treating you like a five-year-old who needs everything locked down. Their hardware is generally excellent, the problem is the companies' attitude toward consumers.
So android mobile manufacturers should watch this video and provide us more stable and reliable products like apple especially videography photography and gaming. Value for money is simply android other that that apple wins in each and every segments. And also they have their own environment which is more easy and compatible for many users. Android developers like Samsung should build such one to stand up against Apple. Pricing of apple products are way higher than we expected each year 😂
Love you both! I see your and Marques’s face more than daylight 😂❤️
Oh my lorddd
I have been watching both of your channels for more than 5 years now, I'm liking all of your videos and your content but this is the first time I don't like a video produced by both of you, the way that you argue both categories seems that you are far from being a tech guy, in some part I clearly see that the android is winning but you say "This point goes for the iPhone" and I'm like what !!! I'm really looking for a fair and a better comparison than this one, I was expecting more from both of you "The best tech guys in the world".
Would have loved Arun and -Marcus.. ?? ugh..- MKHB have another conversation about abs and deadlifts, bench press, and sprints..  Go Arun... 👍🏼
im sorry but for the first time, this is total garbage.
Torrents, streaming to your own tv whatever you download easily without the restraints of apple ecosystem is just enough for me. Both of you guys can easily afford to have subscriptions in almost every streaming platform there is. But for us the poor people of this world Android is just fine
I see iPhone as Drake and Android as Kendrick.
Well which phone stands for each color?
What i took from this video...  Bassically told me, if I have an android, then i  made a bad choice since apple is the better option.   Welp shit, guess I have to swap to apple now since they are the best in the phone market.  My mistake, Sorry
it feels arun is saying "interesting" instead of "fuck off, you are wrong"
iPhone is designed for the user to enjoy everything they need with minimal effort.   Android is about the niche customer but those numbers are limited.   Most consumers just want something they pick up and use. Most don’t want deep customizing in the fast pace world we live in
I almost died laughing when you gave the point for eco friendliness to the brand that makes you buy a new phone altogether just because you broke the back glass 🤣
Messi & Ronaldo of Tech Reviews
I think the important thing is to not fight for these companies, try taking a step back and looking at them objectively and seeing what suits you and what you need instead of pigeonholing yourself into one because of some weird sense of pride
The vivo X80 pro is a better android than the Samsung S22 ultra.
video sponsored by Apple ?
1:42 what's the iphone you're holding?
I use and operate a Samsung S22 Ultra and an iPhone 12 Max. In every area, if I have one that I need to depend on, it's the Samsung S22 Ultra. I completely disagree with the outcome. In my opinion anyway. Great controversial topic!
STOP PRETENDING THE IPHONE SE IS GOOD!!!!!!! PLS!!!! Like seriously the camera is just kinda bad, the chipset is very good but can’t be used anywhere close to full potential and everything else is just bad. If androi made the same phone it would be $120 not like $500 for 32gb storage
There is no way that the screens are same u are crazy, samsung is much much better
Definitely would've flipped the first 5 points the other way.
As a 5 year iOS user who just swapped to android I have to say I agree with a lot of this.  The photography is a lot better experience on iOS for me. It's not just about the quality of the photos as it is how quickly you can capture that moment. iOS just got what I was looking for a lot more consistently and I miss that.  Now Im in the niche case with android because I ACTUALLY use Dex. It's the reason I swapped to android. I've made my own game console/entertainment center with just my phone. If iOS gets anything close to that, I'm going right back!
Thing is there's always an ideal android phone for everyone, I like a device that has a decent size battery which can be charged very fast equipped with a latest chip that has very low power consumption. 6-8gb of ram, a 1080p ltpo screen which can also help extend battery life. Camera's with decent sony sensors, headphone jack, wireless charging, water resistant, that's an ideal phone for me. Most newer chips just increases power consumption to deliver more performance which a really bad trend.
Both are good because they compete with each other and raise the standard for everyone resulting in better smartphones for customers.
2 Lovely persons 💚💚
every time i see a collab with them both its like Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, or Bud Specer and Terence Hill, something that give the feeling that "man, those two should come together Always"
When they said they don't use the split screen I was so surprised cause I am always using it especially when I am trying to do something I'm the kitchen.
Window phones are the best
Can't believe they didn't mention Xaomi in photography.😤
When a tech nerd meets a geek 😬🔥
This is a very wrong comparison. You are comparing a device with an operating system. iPhone vs Android. You should compare iOS vs Android or pick an Android phone and compare it with an iPhone. Simply because iPhone can beat many Android phones in many categories, it doesn't mean that it can beat Android in that category. Even if one Android phone can beat iPhone in that category then Android should be the winner of that category.
If anyone noticed  But from the very start, Arun was so nervous while marques was very calm
Marques's bias towards apple seems real.
basicly iPhone is better for the tech illiterate and andriod will always give you a better result if you know how to use it. ( also, why do i need internet connection and a cloud program to transfer a pdf from my laptop to my ipad!? cant i just connect it? )
ios so far after 2 years of my use still not fix its dog shit photo app and no background download/upload for some app is deal breaker for me. but for some app  the iPhone version is more polish in my opinion
the collab we needed but didnt know we wanted
Its just about personal preference, at this point. With every update, be it iOS or android, has its ups and downs.
"I Accidently Trigger Siri more than I use it" AHAHAHAHAHAH WHO AGREES?
That video honestly hurt to watch. Not because I am an Android Simp or anything but that so many things are factually wrong (Android doesn't have lockscreen widgets anymore since the Android 5 days, they removed that feature for example) or so broadly overgeneralized that it makes 0 sense, like the Update situation on Android or iOS is very, very different.
Obviously this guy is an apple fanboy, I think you picked the wrong guy to do the comparison video with. Of course, that is only my opinion.
iOS always.
I've been an adroid user (MI Mix 2s) until they stoped producing phones for small-hand people. Pixel 4a was the last one I would want to buy but by the time I was going to buy a new phone it was already a bit outdated. So I sticked with the iPhone 12 mini. I really hope apple will still be producing smaller phones in 5 years, when I'll want to upgrade - they are the real saviours for a smallhandkin.
Both of you r iPhone user .i feel it's biased reveiw
I enjoyed it a lot
WOW what a shitshow. When you compared customization you compare lockscreen customization, because why not.
Age is a factor. In my teens I was a super Android fan. I had less money, needed the most value and needed a lot of customisation. As I grew older, money isn't a problem, wanted to get an iPhone due to the luxury marketing and rarely customize my phones
Apple is the richest company for a reason.
The best thing that happened to me in technology related stuff is the collab between the two guys😊
Seriously calling features a draw is ludicrous :). Android way ahead.
The display should have been easily android
I feel like averaging android is unfair here most of the time
Now the midrange please, iPhone wont stand a chance
The value point should have been given to iPhone, it had a 6 point lead when we compare android phones with iPhones within same price range.
The problem is that software support on android is different. On iOS you need to update the entire system to get new features, whereas you can get new features on android with just play updates or app updates. It's a modular system vs a block system, so we can't blame any of the two.
Thank god these two aren’t rivals
I stopped watching mkbhd because he stopped reviewing things objectively and actually started watching your videos because you did. The android objectively wins some categories like display performance and you still gave it to iphone. I have also had many issues with my ipad reliability and stability more than my android. This inconsistency annoys me.
Imagine collab with iJustine, the video will be 2 hours long because of arguments
Recently migrated to IOS and really liking it. Very smooth and polished UI. Scrolling on websites feel as smooth as any app.
I'm surprised they talked about airdrop but not near share, music share, or quick share that Samsung phones have which mimic the features iPhones have. I feel the aforementioned features get forgotten though
Lightning is good man
Samsung is the best brand in the whole world and how much apple paying for both of you🤔🤔
I think this comparison since they are comparing the best from apple in a catagory of phones as apple Literally the one phone they have with essentally the same specs across all iphone 13's, they should do the same for android the best in that category, so in my mind this review was a bit to biased to be credible, as they reviewed the best apple phone for each category, but not android, such as android not winning eco-friendly when clearly they where the best with the fair phone.   so if they are insisting on comparing battery life they should compare the iphone 13 mini to the andoird to be fair, although it seems they forgot to do that but somehow remembered for apple to not compare the best in android but compare the best in apple to it, as your missing one big point of android the phones sometimes are specialists very good at one thing at the cost of others, although Samsung does jack of all trades and such like apple, but if you ignoring this aspect of andoird , that their phones are specialists in one aspect and completely trash apple in their specialty then your basically ingnoring a entire point of android phones, full head in the sand     as it feels more like the answer to you name for Mrwhos(my paymaster)the(corporation apple is, as well as my)boss(and sugar daddy) with this video due to this and not at all factoring this in and skewing android verse apple.
This comparison felt rigged  -An emotionally damaged samsung user.
Android have the best display 🙂
this video has given me a lit more to think about. 🤔  didn't expect some of the opinions from them
Lol whaaa... The two who favors iPhones the most, is going to tell us which is better O.o..?
in this whole video i can only agree on one thing using s21 instead of using s22 like in my Country I would recommend you infinix note 10pro instead of infinix 12vip ,,its a good video
This is beautiful.... My two fab. Techies.... But why does Mk appears shy around Arun! 😊 😊 😊 😊 Is it just me or is that just Mk Is?
2 great men talking to each other☕
android 13 is here ????? android 12 hasnt even come to my oneplus nord CE
best video of the week
My two fav tech youtubers together! YAY! Thanks for this episode! If possible, you two do more collab in the future!
Disclaimer: No Android User's Were Hurt In This Video
You lost me at giving a point for Apple for Eco oriented.... yes the company that forbids the manufacturer of a charging chip to sell it to anyone except Apple and then when they are the only ones able to get this chip and you go to them to fix your phone they are going to rip the whole motherboard out and replace it even though the only problem is this chip.... CPU, Ram, Storage, everything goes to in the bin and i hope its the recycling one but thank god they are making the phones of 20% recycle materials because for their  type of "repair" they are going to throw 95% usable components.... i am done thank you for reading my ranting XD (Before anyone comments that i am not siding with Android either because I think all of them are awful for repair, schematics and repair parts availability)
I think if we go feature for feature, Android racks up more points. The hoops I gotta jump through to do simple things is wild. Androids more chill when it comes to things like downloading mp3s, screen mirroring/casting, etc.
Oh God. Here come the comments saying "they're  both great"
No dought definitely I am Android
Im dead when eco categories goes to iphone... lmao 🤣🤣🤣
Mkbhd is an iphone boy😅😅😅
Iphone is better. Period
That part where they talked about third party support, you can do that on iPhones, older iPhones generally, like the iPhone 4S and older.
Android is made for me because i love customization 🎉🎉
since we all know that at this point Arun is an apple fan boy this is not very fair comparison cause it not from neutral point of view so i am not even surpsised from the result still getting android over iphone every day of the week i think if you know why you just know why :д
i see that mkidontknowaboutphones has been payed to choose apple. I hate the people that dont accept a thing about other companies
I love the concept and I watch both you guys...but you went about this the wrong way...you can't compare apple to "Android" as apple is this small tiny box for those who don't want to change or grow where as android is a huge range of phones for those who want to innovate and experiment...need to compare phone to phone for something like this...would love to see that comparison
Does anyone notice 3G at 12:18..... it's funny how he was trolling Marques for using a year-old phone whilst show casing Internet Technology introduced in 1998...also funny how I expect people to read my comment :\
iPhone wins. iPhone always gets hated on for being simple; but Android has yet to match iOS in polish, there is no real useful non-fragmented alternative to iMessage, facetime, or airdrop. Android is a great operating system, but for everything it can do, it can't match iOS.
RIP ANDROID
"android" vs iphone, then uses a scamsung with the worlds shittyest oem. SMH
For me i always choose android because most iphone features and apps are blocked in my country and they dont have budget phones so i always will buy an android untill i get rich and but a red magic gaming phone😉
MKBHD = Cringe
I thought it was about operating system, not the phones, since there are sooo many of them.
MKBHD forgot to mention that he was sponsored by Apple
I mean Samsung supplies Apple with displays so Samsung should have completely won that field
IPhone locks you into its ecosystem android doesn't. Case closed. Can you even download things off safari yet? Lmao
Both are iphone users promoting it lol 😂 you ain't tricking me... THE GALAXY 22 IS BY FAR THE BETTER PHONE EVEN IPHONE KNOWS THIS
As much as you like to call iPhone the winner, it all boils down to budget. No one wants to buy phone that expensive hence, iPhone users are mostly from the US.
"If you get a Hammer, everything looks like a nail" - Mark-aZZ *Best overall analogy ever*
bad
I use an android for one reason Privacy. I have a custom ROM loaded onto my pixel 6, so I can literally go online, and read every single line of code running on my phone. I own my phone, the manufacturer does not.
andriod is a better phone
Hot take: I honestly think that MKBHD is kinda biased. No hate btw, I still very much like him, but lately no matter what, he sides with one brand/thing. Now for this example I choose to use Android vs IOS situation, since it's more relatable for most people. When there is any discussion about these or comparisons, he always sides with Apple. Not that it is a bad thing of course, I agree, there are things that Apple does better than most brands do. But here is where the problem starts to rise. Lets say that there is a feautre on Android that is absoluteley superior to anything else, for some reason he always goes for Apple. Now, I understand, people do have their prefrences, but come on, really? He literally acts like Apple is paying him for saying these, yet he misses all the useful information to give, or do useless comparisons. Its like saying "-my phone can zoom!" and saying "-well, why not get closer instead of zooming?" kind of situations where its even stupid to bring such arguments to the table. I feel like I cannot trust his words anymore, since it looks like he is purposely disregarding other brands to show one is superior over the other. If you closely watch his videos, you can see that this has became more and more obvious over time. Keep in my people, this is how I see it, and these are my views and opinions. Either way, I'm open for debates.
If u want ios u want a world that apple has created fr u .. in Android u can adapt to the world rather than being in it ...   And in price, beings frm  EU and US might have good money ...  But rest of the world the technology has reached to almost the poorest via Android  So any day IOS is nothing but money game
The biggest issue with these debates is, debates think the world is only USA
It's simple really, android is easily available in my country, there are tons of options from budget to flagship. Apple is not, they rely on reseller which makes their products even more expensive. Until they come to my country and sell their product directly, i'll use android's flagships
MKBHD is fully buased to apple. apple fan lmao 😂
Why you two chill like that😁😁
Android as a whole kills samsung's bold moves in closing down the gaps we have with IOS i dont totally agree with the result. Because i am more into samsung's android ecosystem which i believe has consistent performance and quality.  I somehow believe samsung is controlling android experience. the only point i'd argue with iphone is the Battery and Performance becasue of the Dedicated SoC/Brain/ with android Its one Google that owns it and thousand customers using it so its hard to implement all their wants and needs at once unless they take and make subtle tweak as they want...ITS so Controversial!!!
This video seemed incredibly one-sided especially in departments like eco friendly, display, photography
WOw no rickroll
Apple 🍎
EARLY 42mins
Whoo that collab 😍 👀 ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
🤩
The problem in this question is that Android is a Operating system not a phone so any phone that isn't a iPhone is an android other than feature phones. So comparing an iPhone with an android really depends on the phone that's running Android.
In Nutshell: Arun and MKBHD love iOS more than mighty Android..  Like if at any point Android is good it's draw time and iPhone is comparable to Android yo it's win for iPhone (ya in several aspects iPhone is better than Android) it's just my opinion it may be different for you but i used both products so I choose mostly Android except just on things ecosystem...
If I need a phone to have for the rest of my life it will be the iPhone
I wish windows come to mobile
whats with the sony xperia pro-I in terms of camera?
early
Yeah true, I'm an android user but sometimes I gotta agree that apple is genius in making the product as good or better than android. So yeah it's all about what you want on a smartphone
Nice vedeo!!  Gautam Buddha was born in NEpal/
At the start Didn't realize I would be watching an IPhone commercial for 20 minutes
Before I watch the video I bet at the end is gonna be like you decide which is best for u without given as your own personal judgement.
Actually the title should be  " for MKBHD " Instead of "Ft. MKBHD" as the results are highly influenced by the personal preferences of Marques.  That's my opinion.
Who tf is MKBHD and why is markass brownlee here
Nice crossover! I think it becomes a bit muddy when you compare iphone versus "the rest", basically. I get that it becomes more of a "comparing ecosystems" kind of thing but many of the points are still hardware focused so we're comparing a small focused lineup vs "anything goes" of the all the possible Android phones.   I'd drop the "Android" and go "Apple vs Samsung" or "Apple vs Sony", or hey why not "Samsung vs Oppo"?
Passive aggressive debate
the split screen, display and fast charging is why I choose Android over an iPhone everytime
Android ftw
I always use a split-screen and floating window for multitasking.  Last year, I went out to take some footage of a local football game. A friend of mine who is into photography was stunned at how clear the images and videos I took with an OPPO phone were (Reno 5F).  Maybe if the iPhone had a 2sim slot, I would try it. Mainly due to peer pressure. I'm more productive with Android btw. Android is Bae.
Not fair comparison imo.. you guys are comparing the latest top end Iphone to every android phone out there, basically averaging them out. It would be better if you chose the best Android phoine in your opinion vs the latest iphone. Also Marques seems biased towards Iphone based on personal inclination.
Bro is comparing a one company to a whole army
I'd pick an Android for a lot of reasons, I loved my previous phones, but I had to switch to iOS because of battery life. The last 2 years with Android phones, I feel that they have not been able to deliver a good battery life. I miss split screen though, the ability to do so much things that matters to me with the cameras, some weird choices and this Lightning port !!! The day Android is able to match what Apple has done in terms of battery life (that's what you get when you are in charge of everything from top to bottom), I'll switch.
Display - Android (S22 Ultra) Performance - IPhone  Battery - IPhone  Charging - Android (There are smartphone that supports 165W) Photography - Android (S22 Ultra or Pixel 6 Pro) Video - Iphone  Software - Android (Customization) Software support - Iphone  Voice Assistants - Android (Google Assistant) Price - Android
Dude this is so biased
I would generally chose android as I am quite used to overall having the time to use the throughout my day, and it is very efficient and convenient for me as my daily driver. However I do also love Apple products as well, so innovative and nice looking designs . Although I am not taking any sides but I slightly do to have a preference of using my Samsung S22 Ultra

The hardware isn’t really my deciding factor anymore when it comes between an Android or iPhone. It’s the software. Android apps just do not run as smoothly or look as good as apps on iOS. Also being a Mac user that makes it even easier.

I'm sorry, what kind of comparison is this? I mean, I get that "android vs apple" videos get a lot of traction and views, but what exactly are you comparing here? Apple vs Samsung? Apple vs Vivo or some other manufacturer? Apple vs Google?   Android is an OS, iPhone is a crappy brick that CONTAINS an OS. This comparison should be "android vs iOS" or "x-manufacturer of android smartphones VS iPhones"  As far as the "important features" of the iOS goes, the only reason they are important is because they have no option of using 3rd party alternatives since they won't work thanks to "security" policies of thieves. There is nothing "unique" of their features, their users are FORCED to use them otherwise they paid more than $1200 for nothing, and as a result these features appear as important and frequently used.  I am still unsure what was the actual comparison and outcome of this video.   EDIT: At least I hope Apple paid you enough for this advertisement. You are content creators after all and you both do a tremendous job in your videos generally <3
I wont say that Iphone users are dumb but me personaly wouldn't buy an iPhone even if I would be a rich guy.I still love my refurbished S10 wich I got two years ago.
The eternal debate between users
I just feel samsung is only saving grace for Android. Without samsung Android would have seen as midrange phones
Guys I have iPhone 12 for like year and a half. I never had a bug. I never have even one problem with it. Always stable.
Overall better phone is Iphone,  but Its like comparing a Minivan to Sports car.  Minivan is more efficient at everything, but most people would rather drive a sports car, because its more exciting.
I am using many phones but display of iphones show close to natural colors 👌 🙃🙃🙃
Don’t get me wrong. I love a good android phone like the s22, but I’m hooked on to iMessage and the iOS UI in my opinion is more simplistic.
What happened to the fist bump at the end? You left Marques hanging 😂
This comparison was honestly a bit confusing to me. It just doesn't make sense to me to compare iOS to Android since an iPhone will generally do better than the AVERAGE Android phone, as this video proves, but it's debateable if it's gonna be better than a specific Android. Like, it would make more sense to compare iPhone to Samsung S, or perhaps iPhone to Pixel, etc. It just tilts in favor of Apple if you compare it to Android as a whole since Android is pretty much EVERY other phone almost.
The only problem with iphone is file sharing. That's why I sold it 🤣🤣🤣
S22U is better than any iPhone. No question.
In my opinion, it isn't a question of who is the best. It's about who is the best FOR YOU. For example, for companies which need everything to work seamlessly, IOS is better. But for people who want more customisation and features, Android is better. It is also a manner of preference.

Lol this is so biased. Live outside the US or UK and android quickly becomes the winner in almost all of the categories.

Mkbhd likes the iphone more then android but he used android as main phone for a year and a half 🤷🚶

🤔I expected this topic to be explained in general manner which more peoples thought should be considered,but here this video that you shared was too personal 😔 I don't think this was proper approach
It really is a personal decision like Marques said at the end, you mentioned the reverse wireless charging and how you don't really use it but for me that's a necessary feature because I'm not good at checking my watch and earbud batteries before I leave so if I need a quick top up on either one while I'm at work I just set my phone upside down with the device on the back for a half hour and I know I'll be good til I get home and that's not a worry for me
Samsungs Android is better 😅😅
So this is iPhone vs. Every Phone?
omg my fav
I heard Apple pays more if you advertise it.
Felt that they're biased....
Brilliant video, being someone who uses both operating systems I can’t really argue with you guys but boi people will have opinions on this lol
Iphones dont have Google Lens : )
why was it a comparison between Android and iPhone 13 pro max.... lot of apple users are still using iphone x and it really sucks against same priced Android
mkbhd just hates android i guess😂
Love the discussion aspect of this video 👌
In the last few years, I moved slowly to iOS. I must admit, not only it has become better but open too.  The battery and keyboard for me is the main reason, I am still running iOS.   I’m not sure why they didn’t cover keyboard. I know there are options on the keyboards but iOS keyboard is probably the best onscreen keyboard there is.
I will only use android only from respect of reparability , lack of software locks and unlocked bootloader
If Apple wants it can Take Down android in an instant but then they will be sued for holding a monopoly (or i simply cannot think of another reason)
iOS is very basic to learn IMO, so it's the best for the average middle-aged or older user, that doesn't use external stuff and such.  For those who download APKs and do other stuff that iOS doesn't allow you to do, Android's the obvious way to go, as it has more freedom compared to Apple.
Finally a vid straight to the point  Apple or android
2 apple fanboys niggas
how on earth they gave draw in display category 😮‍💨 S22 Ultra is miles ahead
When a cellphone is more ergonomical yet you choose the most esthetically pleasing but uncomfortable...that's not a fair comparison. That's your personal opinion not the reality. But hey I'm not the one with the millions of subscribers right?
Android over IOS all day everyday ✌️
nice
Due to the vast choice available on Android this is a no brainer for me. There is nearly always a better android device and I hate that notch.
Irony of the video that MKBHD himself is using the Android and here Iphone is winning...
I've used Android phones and iPhones for years. I used to swap each year between Android and iPhone. But after the 12 Pro Max, I'm staying on iPhone. The phone's overall more polished, the experience is imo better, and the resale value is way better for someone who changes phones each year.
The biggest factor is pricing. If I have got 200$ I won't be thinking about iPhone at all, and would be more inclined to getting a suitable Android phone to go through my days.
It feels like they promoting i phone in a clever way , very smart youtubers 😳😑
Time to get Linus on the show!
Amazing Collab that we got to see again , thanks to both for making great content.👍🏼
Android fans are mad🤣🤣🤣
20:08 I remember that sound
100k views in 20 minutes keep it up arun 😀
Well.. It depends on your purpose
It's really unbelievable that you chose an iPhone over android when it comes to display
Realy intresting to see this comparison about the last models, but why is the score so confusing? You usualy make it so clear
Lol android users were making fun of iPhone users me included. But their iphone13 pro max makes any android phone obsolete. Another thing about the software samsung phones regardless how expensive will lag eventually
It's simple,    Better performance/battery life: iPhone   Better customization/features: Android
See android fanboy's Apple is always wins in every important category.🍎🔥
I was waiting for this duet!
The War of the centuries!!!!!
Idk how the sustainability point didn't mention repairability & software updates. Almost always, the most sustainable phone will be the one you use for the longest
Mabey next time use a larger test group and not 2 people with high bias.
huawei p50 pro the king !!!
Marry pls arun
Well, let's not be ignorant. It's clear mkbhd and mwtb have a slightly soft spot for iPhone and android respectively. And tbh, I'm sliding with mkbhd here. I love the apple exp.
You did show us whosetheboss
I think you can say, that for (almost) every feature you can find an android phone that does better, but as a package, there are only very, very few phones, that can compete with Iphone. I think what makes the Iphone great, is that they can do this consistent and have no phone that breaks out, so if u get a new Iphone you can be sure to get a great Phone
which phone can Beat Pixel natural colour..?
Video sponsored by Apple inc. 😂
I have a pager, sadly.
Best collab of the year!
Many of the subjects are about the hardware not the software. Basically it's not android vs iOS which is a software system. It's more or less iPhone vs Samsung.
Yup pip with YouTube and Prime video is all I use.
Thought this would be a debate about which is better but this was just Arun being a mediator and Marques fighting for Apple.
Aren't apple products basically impossible to repair ? and I honestly don't trust any of the carbon neutral claims from any company for that matter.
Ha
Both lighting and audio quality suck. But enjoyed it a lot. MKBHD is a die-hard fan of Apple, who doesn't know about that. And my take exactly matches him.
Something about this is awkward lol
16:38 y'all really forgot about app updates/ support after the software updates are done. Like you could probably use an android 7/6 phone but not an equivalent iOS phone.
Very nice video, but I think this will have such a bad viewer retention rate xD
Is it me of MKBHD has been giving an Apple fanboy vibe? Like in his review videos and comparisons, i somehow feel a small hint of biasness...its not only me right?
i love how genshin is now one of the few games that being used for benchmarks
This was a killing.
Interesting! I'd say they tie   IPhone is slightly better at everything that they both do but not good at a lot of things.  Flagship Androids are good at all categories ,exceptional at some and decent at sooo many things apple doesn't offer.   Imo wait for the iphone 14 pro to get a more rounded iPhone experience over its 5 years of software updates with perfect hardware that will make you overlook its few lacking bells and whistles .  Or   Get the s23 ultra for a feature packed phone that doesn't stun through perfection but through near mastery of so so many things you can forgive its few shortcomings easily.   Personally I'd say go s23 ultra because no one needs perfection but an endless amount of features is fun to have with more than pleasing specs
It has to be Android vs iOS or iPhone vs Android phone like Samsung in video, because you cannot compare operating system to device imho
Iphone: Compact & Best Security  Android : Expandable and Good Security  Coming from an android user
To be honest, I would love more collaborations between you two and you and others for that matter. I love the collabs.
So they point out Samsung has a better camera, and then give it to apple. They point out android phones with better batteries, and then give it to apple. They point out android phones that are more eco friendly, and then give it to apple. HUH?? The entire point of Android is that you have options to get the best phone in any category depending on what is important to you, but they are only going to compare apple to the average android? That makes absolutely no sense
When the two smart kids collab:
Cool video. I use to love iPhones but I'm in love with Android now. But ios16 had me curious a lil bit.
You called 20w in 2022 is decent...u already dead mannn 🤣🤣🤣
This video should be titled “why I love iPhone”
imagine not having full control over your hardware, couldn't be me
Most accurate comparison ever
I don't know I have only tried android and I once tried Apple and it was so difficult to even get to the home screen  I have like how do you get to the passcode screen, it kept pulling the notification bar man I am just glad android still has fingerprint Also like android gives you a little more freedom  And it's interesting to know that you call yourself a hardcore user but bro you don't use split screen, split screen can be a life saver sometimes
Nahh..not the collab i expected..instead you could do both yours and mks seperate points..
I CAN AGREE WITH EVERYTHING, BUT CUSTOMISATION IS SOMETHING APPLE DOESN'T EVEN STAND A CHANCE WITH ANDROID
Mark is so biased
My opinion is that Iphone is reliable and good at most things, but boring, on the other hand Android is more interesting and customisable, but is not as reliable.
U can't repair iphone to third party repair..it's not eco friendly
However I can put a Morbius theme on android which wins 5.5 points. Making it an android win by a close margin.
Nahh..not the collab i expected..instead you could do both yours and mks seperate points..
You know this what we all been waiting for 🤝🫡🙏
what happened to the giveaway?
I love Android phone but not The Todays software, i like older Android software
Always great to see you two together! 😎
I actually liked the color filter in this video
iPhone 13 Pro Max is enough for hole Android smartphones… You can't get everything best here, but you can get everything good here…
But....When You Buys An ios device then you will need an ios environment 🙂which is Very much not affordable by huge population but what Android makes it easy 🙂 by killing such environment
Android is better than iphone, most of the people cant afford iphone, but they can afford  an android.
This is my first and maybe my last comment watching it quietly
What the actuall f? 36MIN AGO AND ALREADY 100k+ views?!
Giving apple the point for ecology after what they've done with the chargers and going against the right to repair is a big OOF
well can I fucking mod shit on an iPhone? didn't think so
Duh Passionfruit is the best
I prefer Android and I hate apple. Android is much more better in price and functions and stuff. (It's just an opinion, you don't have to make a war over this.)
5:50 disagree with statement of  taking time to perfect.. iOS 14 home screen widgets are still non interactive.. Useless
i think MKBHD has become an apple fanboy. this seems biased. Apple iphone 13 screen is smaller compared to Android. Touch response and frame rate of android is just as good as apple. I would prefer fast charging over better battery backup, why? because on average both android and apple battery lasts a day. i would rather prefer a phone which charges in 60 mins than a phone which takes multiple hours. giving apple 7.5 and android 2.5 makes no sense.
I'm with Android always, because Apple makes you buy Apple products only.  But once in a lifetime, I want to use iPhone.
Love your content
Android is better ngl🤙
20 min of wasted time thx.
The result was kinda expected!
Don't know the reason but this vid just doesn't has the charm of regular mrwhosetheboss vids.🤷
Samsung has the incredibly powerful Good Lock app which allows for ridiculous customisation and endless list of features. Some of these customisations would not be possible in other OEMs without rooting or jailbreaking. It also allows for extreme customisation of the lock screen which makes iOS 16 customisation of the lock screen look like a baby. So, in terms of customisation and features, Samsung just blows Apple out of the water. But Marques has rightly said that it is much easier to customise the iPhone. To customise a Samsung, you really have to dig into the settings but you can still do a lot more here. Also for AirDrop, you have Snapdrop for Android, for SharePlay, you have a feature inside of Google Duo which does the same and there is also the highly underrated Samsung and Windows ecosystem, albeit the Apple ecosystem is much more seamless.
Little criticism: You only compared the flagships in the comparison  - thats where apple shines , but not the budget phones, where android usually  shines. Also there are a lot of other aspects, like that the battery degrades faster with apple, which plays a roll in a lot of these categories. Another aspect was that it wasnt very clear what are you comparing, sometimes it was a direct comparison to the latest Samsung, or to a gaming phone, and the software is nearly at every android phones different, you compared the camera of an ”android” phone with another system on top, but when comparing the software  you just compared plain android. I think this video was very subjective, you couldve mentioned this more clearly. But overall a very good and entertaining video, I like them a lot.
iPhone technical support and repairs? No way.
Boring!
Security? What about security
What’s phone is more secure/safe ?
Bruh seriously??, just 2.5 for android. THIS IS SOME WORLD CLASS BS.
Well if you use iPhone 13, the 120hz refresh rate has to feel the best.., try holding an iPhone 12 and see the drop.
For "Eco consciousness" i would give another draw. YES, iphones have more recycled materials but are LESS REPAIRABLE
This was scripted.
This video made by Collab with Marques , Mrwhosetheboss and Apple 🍎🍏  😜😅🙂😜😜🙏🙏
Eco friendliness? How many worker suicides happen at Foxconn? But at least iPhones eco friendly
What I really like is almost every category has a "but" or two. Real world experience with the phones is subjective in most categories as well. My wife uses an iPhone, I use an Android. I don't see that changing as we both want different things in a phone.
I mean .. man showing up with an Apple watch, what else can we expect lol .. People are just used to ecosystem that's about it. The phone is the same old boring thing year in year out. Coming from a 12 pro user about to make the switch.
Mac vs windows
❤
Didn't make him choose one for display and software and allowed it for Battery and Photos. Android does charging better. Apple stays longer. Photos too there is overlap. Something like Samsung is a display you will always trust even in sunlight Pretty biased.  I use both. Like both. But this is so biased.
Bruh them talking about which phone is gonna get the point, is my brain trying to pick what answer is the correct one in multiple choice
How come you guys say stuff then just award the points randomly? "Oh yeah android charges way better but apple has better battery life so apple wins." first of not even true, can we stop using samsung as the basel for all androud smfh second off, so many points were made saying android was better but them you do a 180 giving the points to apple. So weird.  Xiaomi is by far one of the best phone manufacturers I have ever used.
Android isn’t for poor people, it’s for stupid people
would have been better to compare android to ios
But Android has nearby share!
I would argue against the iPhone being eco conscious because of the way Apple tries to keep you from repairing your phone. The more Apple blocks third party repairs, the more iPhones end up as e-waste.
I've had my s21 since luanch and even though the battery is not great (but I can get in a good fast charge) and the proformance dips time to time and little smoothness nuances like when using the swipe gestures  to quickly change app takes a few seconds longer. I've thought about getting an iPhone but there is just a few small but very important features that I love. 1 I like to pirate my music and there is no way I could ever do that on iPhone. 2 I can have a decent ad blocking experience with Samsung internet, which to my knowledge I could not get on iPhone. 3 I can get 2nd party apps think YouTube vanced and Instastander so I never have to deal with adds again. Yes I am a cheap scape
It's kinda weird that in almost every aspect iphone is better, I mean, seriously you can discuss for thing like camera or performance, but saying that the screens are a draw, man you are too obvious... how can you prefer a screen who is way worse than the other and call it a draw.. I was hoping for a real comparison...
Felt like MKBHD the neutral vs MrWhoseTheBoss the iPhone lover.
The criteria they use to compare features changes for each category. Compare all of Android, the top Android flagships, or the S22 Ultra. Without it being consistent the choices don't matter. In the end this is just a fun video, and the real deciding factor is are you ok with being locked into Apple's ecosystem or not. I've had iOS, Windows Mobile, and Android. Windows Mobile is still my favorite, rip. I use Android these days. All the must have features in iOS are in Android and it's more flexible. You can also connect it to Windows to make calls, send texts, transfer files, AND play any app from your phone on your computer. No need for a native app. It's also nice to have more choices in phones to meet budget and need.
I have to say the battery life in long time is terrible
I still don't get it how the people say iphone battery last for the whole day in practical use, i used to have iphone 12 pro max and now iphone 13 pro max and they never get more than around 4 in the afternoon.
It's just matter of pricing in android vs iOS now, if you budget is anything below 50k ($650-700) than android make sense but anything above that you need a phone that has good brand value along with consistent in performance, camera and software support and in that case Apple takes the cake.
the two legends😂
Your a legend
Who else had the karma ad from whoose the boss before watching this video?
iMessage and facetime do not matter to me. No one uses those shits in my country even on iphone owners.
Kings🖤
Downloading & opening APK files for apps etc! Android only! I left iOS for this reason alone.
As right now I'm using android and iphone as my daily driver. I just love how flexible android at almost everything like costumization, modding community, and gaming (console emulation). Other than that, social media, video editing , and photography, apple is the winner. I don't use mac or any other apple ecosystem. So google ecosystem fits better with me (android smart tv and pc). I don't use facecam or iMessage since it's not really popular in my country.
One solution...Get both and enjoy them for what they offer.
This is just a podcast
Oh please mkbhd Is a apple fan .  Has he ever criticize apple?
Mkbhd out here acting like Apple ambassador ◉‿◉
Arun I think you should shot a QNA video 😅 .
MKBHD was totally biased with his judgment, from my opinion the only reason most people use iPhones isn't because of FUNCTIONALITY but for PRIDE/EGO....People use android for FUNCTIONALITY and VERSATILITY.
Marques siding with Apple. What a shocker lol  I am an Apple user but he makes excuses for Apple so his opinion is always biased
After years on a Galaxy, this year I moved to the iPhone Mini. There are so many things Android can do, which I simply don't care about.  I just want something pocket friendly,  which does the basics really well.
dont forget ur comparing a 2022 phone with a 2021 phone tho
The way I see it: iPhone is good but the future is android. Android is developing faster, more innovative, sells a lot more, and is significantly cheaper by availability and by choices. Last but not least, it is a lot less boring.
Android 🥰
If it can make calls and play YouTube the only thing that really matters is price
Okay so this isn't mrwhosetheboss ft mkbhd this is only mkbhd, who's clearly more inclined towards Apple. It srly feels what the user prefers more that's it. I would literally choose Android. Especially i frkng don't understand how display it a tie like srly. Even camera like pixel gives a clearly nice experience. The title Android vs iPhone is sh*t. It should be Android flagships vs iPhone. Compare phones of the goddam price point guys. Else obviously iphone will be the Clear winner bruh🤦
This comparision is a bit weird ngl. Only way to compare to an iphone 13 pro max is samsung S22 ultra and niche cases like ROG. So what is the point? Apple's whole model is to give people luxuries while Android was primarily for the masses but have now become something that can offer both.   Iphone 13 max pro won most comparisions as expected, its a no brainer when the comparisions are about "best battery" without thinking of other factors like price points (A 400 dollar Android is obviously not going to be better). Overall a very bad topic to make a video on
Android is only lacking because there is a gap between the company of the phones and the company of the software. Once companies like Huawei manage to create their own operating system there will be a massive jump ahead of ios.
At this point I would say it's just preference. Even though android phones come up with a much better phone they would still pick the iphone
Honestly I can never imagine not using nova launcher
iphone bias all the way. Boring
Love seeing these two together
android loses because of that they compare all android phones with the newest iphone one, not the old one, some phones they mention are really old...
based
This was such a good video! No one play God with one side or the other, you could both agree and disagree with valid points and that was just amazing!!!!
Arun got a free MKBHD interview. I love this collab Thank you for the work 💜
hello mrwhosetheboss! i loved this vid keep up the good work
I think that you should have done this video in two seperate rooms and compared both your ratings
Get your Before 40 Minutes ticket over here
Day by day mrwhosetheboss videos become b😓🥱😴😪😫
Respectfully i think that iphone won in alot of categories that is worse and it shouldn't have
You should have switched sides. Marques because he's based in the US would like iOS a bit more. But Arun from the UK would generally prefer Android. As for photography, come ON marques, the Pixel and Samsungs are miles ahead. Come on man
Idk if I can take this video seriously lmao. The very first point is apple and android have the same/equal display?? 😂🤡
Appl samsung fight each other whil whoisboss and mkbhd have love collabe. Companies lern from them. These are competitors for money just like companies. But they spread love not hate
it's cheating, mkbhd uses only iPhone, he has no experience on android phones.
Yeah, but when I had a Samsung android phone I never knew when, or if, I would get the upgrades.
watching them talk about which is better while watching on a Huawei y5 👍🏼😐
my take is: Android is the only way to go, because only on the Android side there are phones that let you throw out google and mod your phone the way you want (with custom roms). That's not possible with IOS whatsoever.
I choose Android for google assistant(2 points for that), duck Siri !!!
If there is another passionfruit phone it would be chargeos
Androids definitely take the win when it comes to cameras..coz phones like vivo Samsung pixel have so many differentiating features like a 100x that you may not use all the time..but it’s there when you need it..or the Zeiss mode on vivo
Ah, you guys could have used target demography and geography as part of the comparison. Apple services are widely available in US/UK(maybe), however, for other countries, the APPLE ECOSYSTEM overall does not make a lot of sense given that the net cost of using all of the equipment (which makeup the ecosystem) is high on hardware side and the services are just not mature enough. Google has deeply penetrated developing markets and Windows is the OS of choice for the same markets, hence in all practicality, Apple products are a niche and dont make a lot of sense markets other than US/UK
U
I prefer Android.. Only because i can install tons of cracked apps and games..🥴🥴
3:50 A+ shot right there
marques
Stop comparing hardware in videos like this
Collab that we never axpected
Answer: Android. iPhones are smooth and long-lasting. Androids are more capable, customizable, and have more options. iPhone is for basic people who can afford a good phone and don't want to think much about it. Apple's innovation died with Steve Jobs. Google is the future.
This video is only the opinions of Arun and Marques, because like I know a lot of people who would pick and Android because they think it's very simple, easy to use and has good cameras, the line of privacy is very blur too as Apple tracks you as much as Google does.
Where is OnePlus ??!
The score board is about iMessage - green burble Vs blue burble
Pretty easy take since you can't do shit with iPhones. Sync all your clouds on the device? No. Have 5 Apps in a row? No. See the resolution of a f*ing photo? No.
Android is better because it's cheaper
This man never disappoins...
Bias,... Facetime, iMessage etc. those are not features, in this case: video calls, messaging those are features and they are available on Android as well.
Y
If android users don’t like Apple because of customization that can easily be improved, as we can see through ios 16. I am always a fan of simpler however, so the updates to the lock screen I am not a fan of but it is good that are giving the option to those who would like a deeper customization to iPhones.  I used androids in the past for work and tablets for school and was never impressed by them.
What a stupid comparison
Android better ngl but which one is best for you pick it
Where is your give away results?
i littrally use my fingerprint scanner on my power button and never look at the lock screen
My suggestions for OneUI 5.0 - I need a Very big improvement in Animations - More Material You throughout the UI - Better Optimised battery life through Optimised Software - Stop Region locking Good Lock  - Provide Software updates for all regions & devices at the same time
I prefer Android because I can download 3rd party apps that is not bounded by appstore/playstore
I don't know why you gave the battery to iphones because until the latest iphones, it had a reputation for having a terrible battery.
As an android user, Iphone tops to me. After watching Wwdc, I just lost hope to android. Samsung's literally overclocking their devices and doesnt even feel snappy. Scam me with their flagship when I bought S20 plus, the battery sucked. They really did well until 2018, 2019. Then they kept removing features like silly goofy ahh. I would wanna switch to apple but, I got a windows, and Samsung does well linking with windows just like how iPhones link with Macbooks.
The sub to channel would be un"forget"able🙂🙂🙂
Let's Goo🔥 Fav Two!!
This video is _definitely_ not biased ...
He really seemed bias
I think apple has perfected the user side of things. For example: Home, Health and Apple wallet are just incredible and even more in the IOS 16. While Android is more customisable, Apple for me focusses more on User experience over the long term.
Maps is much better in Android in 80 percent of the world ( Google Maps ) yea you get it on the iPhone but it still belongs to Android. I am an apple fan boy
I really loved the pacing of this video. Glad you didn’t waste 10-15min on a guest introduction like most channels would. You give “us” the fans credit for knowing who is who and what you are talking about. Simple yet high quality…like my IPhone 😉
Is this an Apple sponsored video?   Asking for 19:31
I'm sure Arun took some fitness tips from Marques
Mhkb is an iphone fan so not surprised 😂😂😂😂😂 I bought and iphone and returned it 2 days after For a Samsung  Imagine him say it's a draw in screen comparing iphone 13 pro max to s22 ultra is just blasphemy 😂😂😂😂😂 the only thing iphone can if not biased is battery and software update
5:28 iphone is not flat bottom.... please like if u notice the mistake😂😂😂😂
Eyyyy
They’re both brilliant in different ways. I just don’t get these “fanboys”. Apple/Google wouldn’t piss on them if they were on fire and some of these people defend one or the other like their lives depend on it. Just accept that iOS does some things better and Android does other things befter
MKBHD: Does clipboard function on Android matters to you? Me; YESS!
Title: iPhone vs Android Video: iPhone vs Samsung (mostly)
Did you purposely dress like good and evil for this comparison?
iOS is great but not that great
The thing is that you cant compare forest with playground
I still need my blue bubbles
Beautiful video!
this might be the first mkbhd collab this year
Messi and CR7, basically
Samsung 22 ultra is the best android phone in the world.
But end of the day 90% of humanity are using android phones
We have airdrop facetime and messages on android. Nearby sharing, Duo and just messages
They should have considered that android is more customizable and has more features and possibilities. I have used an iPhone 12 pro max next to an s22 ultra and the latter is better at everything
I don't think I agree with the eco-conscious score here, because one entire parameter is missing in the discussion - reparability. Recycled material and carbon footprint and all are fine, but the most eco-conscious thing to do is to ensure that if the phone breaks down, it can be easily repaired. Having to replace an entire unit when say just the screen is shot or the charging port doesn't work does not sound very eco-conscious. And Apple is not really known to make sure that their phones can be easily and affordably repaired.
The shutter speed on all Samsung I’ve tried to own. is enough to keep me on an iPhone. Every photo taken on a Samsung is blurry or shit due to me moving. or the subject moving because iPhone can take the picture instantly. Samsung takes what feels like 32 seconds to snap the shot.
MKBHD is an Apple fanboy.  you can easily make this out by watching his videos .
Hi, which budget phone would you recommend me? Poco x4 pro or Samsung Galaxy a53 5G? Camera doesn't matter to me that much, I don't need much performance, I just need software support and reliability.
nah man you just giving iphone all the points with almost useless arguments
if android is better then why is it on 13  while apple is on iOS 16
What kind of sense does it make to compare Android and IOs at hardware, as done at the first few kategories?
1:42 thats what she said😬
Apples motto is, “slow and steady wins the race.
Best collab so far 😩😅
If you are out of the USA and Europe. Android is way better because IOS is limited in regions like Africa. Even Netflix is limited here. Alot of apps don't get fully utilized in my region but android makes our lives easier.
I'm gonna have to firmly disagree with a lot of what you guys say. There's no way iphone is that much better than android
Apple stable and reliable? After 2 years your phone slows down to make you buy the newest one 🙃
The return of Unus Annus
I have stopped listening to mkbhd because he is so biased towards apple it's so overwhelming, if tomorrow you bring a phone from 10years in the future this guy would find the smallest downside and say that an Iphone is better overall
I think it depends on the person really
I generally keep both platforms because of several reasons. Android for my work tasks because it's definitely flexible to pair with Windows; I use Link to Windows feature and/or Samsung Dex. I also use iOs since I commonly organize and sign my documents via iPad and I find Apple ecosystem suitable and meeting  my personal needs in life since it's simple, smooth and really reliable. The battery of the 13 pro max is a real beast and I'm going to get the 14 pro max for sure because of the rumored beautiful sleek design. Well I haven't upgraded my s10 5g for a few years now since I'm never missing the flagship experience in this Samsung device. The video and photo editors in Samsung are also amazing. I'll also mention the wireless and reverse charging in Android (Samsung) that are entirely efficient. Well, anyway these platforms have their strengths and weaknesses so I make sure to keep handsets from both of them 🙂
Lemme guess before I watch the vid: both have their strengths and weaknesses and neither  is better than the others it just depends on the user.
I like the iphone better
Western countries like US and UK it would make sense why iPhone would be more preferred.   Most of the people there uses an iPhone already and are locked within the eco-system which makes you care for features such as iMessage, Airdrop and Facetime. Meanwhile, the rest of the world especially third world countries, most would prefer to have an Android because it is the one used by the majority.   Most of my friends don't even use an iPhone so all those features would be useless. For those friends I have that use an iPhone, they couldn't really utilize these things and they are literally using alternative apps just like us Android users because no one here send texts or chats in regular messaging apps.   We either use Messenger, What's App, or even Discord instead, and that applies to our friends that use an iPhone. Also we kind of find it funny how they are so proud of Facetime and iMessage as if its the only messaging and video calling app that exists. People on the outside of west are more flexible and are open minded knowing there are multiple other apps that does the exact same things and sometimes have features that these apple apps don't have 😂
As a person who rooted my S3 Mini and then the S5 on the first day I got it, I didn't touch my Note9 and there is no reason to root it anymore now that we have GoodLock modules :)
MKBHD is biased to iphone.
Consider include the Samsung or Android versus Apple person in your next discussion. Not just the apple guy
How did the environmental friendly go to Apple, I literally have to buy new charger for iPhone 12 and 13, double waste.
operating system vs a phone. Bruh why are people saying this
Android have always been for fan boys and if you want the best phone iPhone it is
well about the assistant thing its not even close in the what the f is this tier we have cortana and bixby but he has not arrived yet and than in the i steal your data we have alexa and in the meh we have siri and google is in the its good i mean no assistant is great but googles is way better this comes from a iphone guy but i have tried android a bit and i own a google home its so much better
Its literally one phone vs the entire android smartphones
Top 10 YouTubers that deserve more subs
I feel like mkhd is bias
loved this video cause it was just sit down and relaxing and no over the top expressions. just a chill video
Am early to the comments
arun left him hanging 20:06
Εμείς που παρακολουθούμε το κανάλι σας από Ελλάδα,να κάνετε στα βίντεο σας και μετάφραση στα Ελληνικά,αν σας ειναι εύκολο.Θα το εκτιμούσαμε πολύ!! Ευχαριστώ☺️
Alternate Title: MKBHD Being biased for 20 Minutes!
Oh ironman and captain America together, nice
HOW DID HE GET 84,000 VIEWS IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR???
7:26 If you take a picture on an iPhone and quickly swipe up to close the camera app. Many a times it doesn't save the shot either (at least happens in my iPhone 12 a lot).
U Cant do a which phone ist better with a iPhone User iPhone User prefer everytime the iPhone even if there technically worst
There is No Comparison.   S22 ultra- ALWAYS THE BEAST ( Better display, No disgusting Notch, Super fast charging, Better video stability, slim and handy design and many more!
Enjoyed that, thanks!
he gets thousands of views in just a few minutes
do u like actually use imessage? ive never seen somebody use imessage irl (ig its an american thing to use imessage)
Perfectly balanced. As all things should be.   Personally, I want to see Windows phone return. If Windows wants to learn how to run on Arm, they should learn how to optimised on Arm. Nuff said.
Iphone = For Personal  Android = Business/Work   I like them both 🤷
The prints on the samsung though
android better
on paper iphone gives 5 year's but I had an iphone 6sp and it even got iOS 15.2, it has stopped then but that's obviously more than 5 year's
Software has to go to android. The abundance of features, the ability to download stuff outside of the app store, the fact you don't have to wait 5 years to get features the competition has. I could go on.
Mutltiverse is real
This has to be one Of the best tech videos .  NO fancy lighting no fancy rooms . Its great to see two of the very best creators out there showing the world how their minds think about phones and genuinely trying to explore all answers to the questions. Also shoutout to @MKBHD for his wonderfull answers which i think most of the audiences would relate . And many many many thanks to Arun for making this happen. Lots of love to both of yous . Also also hoping to see many more of your collabs
In my opinion the apple has the performance but the price is expinsive and the android is much cheaper than apple..............
1:09 Loved the S22 Ultra with a battery percentage of 69% xD
For some reason MKBHD is sounding nervous who agrees? 🙌🏾
Apple really locks you in once you’re in their ecosystem it’s hard to convince me to switch especially bc I use my iPad to study its very nice to just airdrop photos between them (expect that airdrop doesn’t keep the order and the iPhone still uses lightning)
2 beasts of YouTube!
Lighting sucks in the video? Well the color and lighting could have been fixed for the video with simple basic color/lighting correction?
In 2020 Craig Federighi said maybe it’s time for Marques to go iPhone exclusive. Sounds like he’s headed that way.
worst review ever, MKBHD is just iphone lover
How the times have changed. Now it's Arun with the iPhone and Marques with the android
cool
when android does it better they call it a draw, when IOS does it just as good or slightly better they give it to IOS?
The problem with ios updates is that they will last for as long as the phones go, but at the end of apple, that's the end. Android is open source, so it will never really stop getting updates.
The bias there is in using Samsung as Android benchmark and the idea that iPhone vs All Android is a fair question.    Put all the market leaders against eachother
I like how both top tech reviewers can still learn from each other at the same time they don't seem like rivals instead, they're more like complement each other. love you both guys...
I love my Pixel 6. At work. A lot of people will talk about iPhones and how they're superior to Android, but I don't really believe that.
cringe apple fanbois xD go touch some grass ^^
Bruh it's 9:39pm in Philippines when you posted this
do tehy realise the competition finished halway through the vid lol
Unsubscribing cause I like android and don't wanna litsen to other opinions. Dope video tho, liked and commented.
Sponsored by Apple
I have both phones android and IOS , I always go back using android , , I like the option of back space button on android, I don’t all the swiping with your fingers on the iPhone, I use google assistant a lot , and google maps , and voice typing is better than Siri ,  I think the cameras are great on both platforms, but I prefer Samsung and Pixel photos over iPhone, battery goes to iPhone. Performance both platforms are fast and smooth, multitasking goes to android.
1:47 what happens to the N ?😂😂
you know what theres is actually no comparison if you have money to spend.
I think it boils down to what the consumer wants. If he/she wants a more stable and overall great experience, the clear winner is iPhone. And if you want, like reaaaaalllyyy want something and will use daily that iPhone doesn’t offer, then the particular android would be a better choice. The seamless-ness Apple provides throughout their lineup is unparalleled.
Nice interview with an apple fanboy. Android was better in some categories yet he still gives the point to ios 😅... Wife got the 12 pro max and I got the S21 ultra. Long story short she traded in her 12 pro max for an s22 as soon as she could cuz iPhone was terrible... her words lol
Switch from op8 pro tp iphone 13. Biggest mistake of my life 🥲🥲
The only thing i like about iPhone is the battery, ram and game only. Apart from that android is so cool
I would choose iphone if they didn't price it so high
MKBHD looking so tensed like a boy sitting in his first interview
In the end, iPhone is for non-technical people and android is for technical people.
About that multitasking, yeah online exam.
if iphone had android variant i would go for that.
Iphone is a clear winner for 90 % of the people.
you should change the title of the video to Samsung 22 ultra vs iPhone 13 pro max🤨🤨
Pixel, because I want only to be registered in one company and not 4 or 5 companies....
My opinion is that I only like the about the iPhone is the camera and the overall program and the iPhone layout
Having used Andoid both iPhones android, I agree with this video. Apple has been catching up with customization features which were the a major sell for an Android. Then the better chipsets and amazingly optimised software that iOS is. iPhones are overall better than Androids. That being said. I wan't Andoid to catchup with it ecosystem and their chipsets.
I tried to use iOS but after more useful , productive and time saving features of android phones I’m back to oneplus from iPhone 13… it was big downgrade except smooth animations and camera ( video ‘
I'm sorry, but how can you say that iOS has just as much customisation as Android? Also when it comes to photography Android is better. Yes, iOS has the edge in video, but for photos... No way.
Don't want to be that guy but how much did they pay you. I mean I can't argue with you you are giants of tech but you seemed a bit biased sometimes especially in the second part of the vid
East, west Android is the best 😜🙏👌🤞🏻🤞🏻 Samsung galaxy s22 ultra 🔥😍
AirDrop could've been an open protocol. Apple makes up features that are designed to not work (with other phones) instead of features designed to work universally. It's a bad approach to innovation imo.
Man is love a co hosted channel by these two they work great together
Most of takes are bias tbh
For camera i will choose Android
You compared the top IPhone with the average Android, I think that's not very fair... Either compare a top tier IPhone with a top tier Samsung or a budget IPhone with a budget Android but not a flagship IPhone with all the Androids averaged...
Simple if u want good features and affordable prices go for android If u want fast and good gaming experience go for android
Nothing but preference.
Apple is your pet. Promoted well👏🏼
The only Mrwhosetheboss video which I do not agree with 😁... For me Android is the best 💯,as a heavy user.
Overall the android is by far the better OS system because it offers better customization, photos and videos, have faster charging time and they are with recent studies the safer os right now. Until Huawei with their harmony os take the lead
Finally
Display definitely android
You are not being fair
Arun should consider starting tech podcasts. Would love to see this as a series!
Great VID, hope to see more collaboration between you two!
I think that it would be an interesting debate if you talk more specifically about the mid range because a lot of these questions answers would be different if you left out android and apple flagships
In my opinion android should win photography, battery and display.
man you two are actually living my dream haha keep up the great work!
Kinda biased but okay
Am I the only one noticing that the famous outro is gone
Do more videos/collaboration like this.
I like how I'm just watching these videos, while I'm stuck on an A12.
For me, it is a matter of preference; different strokes for different folks.
You gave me justification as to why I still use an iPhone :) ... that and because my wife insists that hers is an iPhone and it's just easier if I have one for sharing or knowing where the setting is located.
I like both and I'm happy we can now  give comparisons instead of shouting "reeeeee android better"
I miss and adore the good old collabs
In USA - iPhone for sure RoW - Android for sure
The two legends of tech
Why you left Marques hanging on that lil fist bump bro😭
I will chooose an android phone ❤
two legends together ❤️❤️❤️
I prefer iPhone so I can by prada cases or luis Vuitton 😬
I generally prefer android as it offers more stuff that I'm looking for
Give me a heart ❤ please 🥺
iphone is good if you love the Apple walled garden and honestly who doesn't love to be in a garden full of apples?!
Samsung has airdrop and shareplay type fetures are there is zoom or google duois there for face time
lol this again
You are not me and I am not u what you love is not what I love so don't say.i phone is better than android they are all phone
for  me the diference betwen them is the os.. and  with android is a phone that adapt to the user.. but with iphone.. is the user who have to adapt to the phone! i do prefere the android for the  way it connect to things.. again .. i want to connect it to something i can simply do it.! with a iphone you can`t.. you need a imac u need to be around apple  for  full connectivity and usage ! imagine plug in to your phone a camera.. well on android u can simply do it.! on iphone you can`t.
I just cant look away from those calves of yours you doing really good at the gym bud

Battery Experiance: replaceable battery Wins xD   and why is a Fairphone not a fair comparison with an IPhone? Its Android! and if a non-flagship Android is better than a flagship IOS ... then it makes it even worse for IPhone 😅
Claim your “Here within an hour” ticket here.
Android for me. Period.
Android all day every day. Custom ROMs, customization, application markets, tweaks/root, repairs, accessories, price, categories..... its way more value for money unless your purely after trends and status.
I so wanna try Samsung S22 Ultra but I just can’t go away from iOS. I truly wish I could install iOS On other phones. I do love iPhone but I wanna try Samsung top of the line phones.
I think MKBHD just likes iPhone lol
In my opinion, there are 4 phones that are the Kings in the industry: iPhone 13, Samsung S22, ROG Phone 5, and Pixel 6.
way better than LTt
I have been using the pixels (a's) for about four years now and I am not going to get any other phone. You have the software support, excellent camera and most importantly, affordable and compact.
I would take SamSung  but because  of the performance and battery life of the International Market Version  the Iphone Is much more suited  to me for now
Bro iPhone destroyed
It's crazy that out of all 10 categories the only one android wins is value...and the only time it seems as if Android is better, it's that tie. I love your videos, but this is some bull. No way is Apple so much better than Android that it's not even close.
we comparing them in the camera, battery and random stuff compare them in system like you did with the assistants
where is the passionfruit vs iphone vs android
Arun feels skewed towards Apple in this video. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
This was awkward
hello
I still prefer Android over iPhone, most of my friends are using android so all the facetime, iMessage, air drop are useless and I still prefer having an app drawer what I can't believe is still not a feature on iOS.  Also I'm a gamer so obv I'm not touching a mac 🤣.
I feel this is more iPhone biased and I use and iPhone.
Android is better as of 2022.
The collab we never knew we needed 😃
I honestly can't live without wireless DeX anymore, it's super convenient and I use it almost every day on my TV while mom is watching a movie on the PC.
I prefer Android over iOS cause I like my kidneys
Never getting tired of this vids
Asking MKBHD about iPhone vs Android?? the Answer is iPhone all day because he loves Apple products no matter what. he doesn't even review most android products/phone but when Apple announce anything I mean anything he reviews. you can't say the Samsung display is equal to iPhone, never
1:30 you lost me there. Iphone is great, but its the most uncomfortable phone to hold!  I see where this is going...
I feel like mkbhd controlled all the choices, feel like it would've been completely different with someone else
Uhm, I don't think the comparison was not really fair. Because it's android ( all Android phones both good and not so good) and iPhone. It should have been a Samsung vs iPhone, I bet the scoring would be waaay different.
Iphone vs android best phone in that  segment ....and still iphone wins   Seems now its time to switch to iphone
When it comes to app performances, it just make sense that Apple gonna be faster, as their app are made optimised specifically for them, while Samsung shares the optimisation with all other android phones that use the same app.
I mean, the title says OS vs Phone
I need more Collabs with MKBHD
Tbh iOS is really limited in what you can do with it, android offers way more control. E.g can download apks, custom ROM etc
I feel like android scored so low gere because there are more variables to point out errors in given that there are more android phones. If this were plainly the 13 pro max vs the S22 ultra, the results could be different  the better phone is subjective, whichever fits your needs 😁
For me (and the person who asked me for advice) regarding smartphones:   "Buy Android when the budget is under 600$, buy an iPhone when the budget is above that."    Android over 600$ is not worth it, iPhone under 600$ is not good enough.
Okay iphone is better. Peace! And i just found that you can't even pause a video recording in ios😐.
You guys generally use iPhone and your preferences are limited that's why you're being biased for iphone. Don't forget that if a person wants a good phone in limited budget, then iPhone won't be near in sight. You're speaking on behalf of rich people who can afford iPhone 13 pro
I really don't understand how's the display better lol. Compare iphones with the same price range Android phones. IT SUCKSS!!

Can't really go wrong with either. Team Android for me. 👍
I feel like apple payed good money for this video
Finally put the nail in the coffin hehe. I switched from Android to iOS not too long ago and I’m glad I did, but Android is still very much dear to my heart.  But it really does come down to what was said in the end: that objectively yes some of the categories make a clear winner, but it really is up to personal needs and wants. I think iPhone is the better overall decision but Android really does offer some great niche functionality. Good video guys!
You guys forgot to mention the buggy experience of all the iterations of iOS 15 each update came with a lot a bugs and problems and the latest being the issue with video recording. Anyone reading this you can look it up most YouTubes have had this problem and even I as a normal user have faced this problem.
Who owns a Window Pc and transfer data from android frequently how does he match with ios?
Marques is very brilliant
Very important thing is that on android you can flash yourself a custom rom for a lot of years of software support and match the things you care about for way less money instead of buying an expensive phone
Arun, I thought you'd be more prepared. Fair points but you left android behind not knowing what it can do more then the iPhone 😂😭. Batteries for example, they need replacing a lot on iPhone, android? Hardly anyone haha but yeah, Where's your reaserch you usually do? 😂😩
as an Android user, I have to give Apple credit, they can make the software and OS so light and efficient, even when on paper they have a lower spec, they still can beat the higher-spec Android phones in terms of performance.
Android's iPhone?
Cause I don't care about face time or any other things like i messages and the rest 🤷‍♂️ I can get app that can do those on android also
It all depends on your own taste, The simpleness of apple is really soothing the features of it is just spot on however lacking on the Customization and on how complex it is, Android now being really customizable and has more options or brand to choose from, if someone is really a phone enthusiast or something they'd rather pick Android or If you want to live just a simple life just pick the Apple.
yep they just completely shatted on android
American english vs British english
Honestly, I never thought I would ever see two of the best youtubers ever in the same frame! Thank you Arun!
My laptop seriously has only 2GB of ram no joke🙁
It all boils down to what does matter to you :p
yall be talking about environment and sustainabilty but you flew to the us for some phone update lol
Mkbhd be like i am gonna use iPhone i love iPhone there is no point of this conversation 🤣
I hate bots who ask you to have a good day :((
Eco consciousness to Apple? That's on par with human rights to Adolf Hitler. I think we forgot a little something a.k.a. right to repair, a few other criterias were biased too.
compared to Mrwhosetheboss, marques feels dumb
Fun fact MKBHD gave most points to iPhone but still uses S21 Ultra
Software: Apple Price: Android
What phone did you record that epilogue with........
I am not surprised, why they haven’t brought google phones 😅 That would have been one sided match.
Tech Goats coming head to head. lol
utter nonsense to think the iphone's display is on par with The Galaxy (android)!
Samsung : 100000000000 Iphone : 0.5
I just love how they argue ❤️
I like the black &  white colors of their clothes।
3:08 lol iOS always kills tasks at background and stops downloading damn file
And you cant talk about ios functions like airdrop when you have to use another apple device for it, its not user friendly, CMON!!!
He always make us proud
'iPhone' a name of a phone 'Android' an operating system  with lots of phones of course they're gonna have a lot more features with the added disadvantage of all their caveats of all the android phones I'm not surprised apple won more points should've been iPhone Samsung or iPhone pixel
MKBHD be taking the convo to a diffrent reality
I would genuinely Choose Both but in ios has one choice and in android we have a lot of choices
Me love your vids ❤️
Arun now seems obsessed with MKBHD😂😂😂😂
S22 Ultra is the best phone on the market right now.
Apple has and always will be the greatest. Androids users can cry..
Appreciate your effort 👌
Me who uses both: 😎 Great video! 💪🏼
Software features draw??? Isheeples channel
As an android user - I will now never know peace, my friends already cook me alive over having a Samsung, this video is about to send me to hell
Apple is not at all catching at customisation. You can't even change icons or even put icons wherever you want. You can do anything you want yourself. Not that lock screen widgets are better on vanilla android, but you can do anything yourself. You have infinite options.
Android way ahead ok bye
Samsung is really the only competitor to Apple. The other androids are more niche. Personality I do use multi-tasking, s-pen, both GA and BIXBY. But the few things Apple does, they do better then Android.
8:53 I'd argue that parts between androids are interchangeable. If my friend has a Huawei I can charge my phone with that charger. If I buy a dongle it's compatible to most if not every Andriod phone. Softwares, apps are available across the board I don't need to buy separate products...if my Samsung doesn't come with a charger I can use my huawie charger and so many examples.   Also Android offers ways more games and apps iOS doesn't have.
No Operating System is superior to another, each of them has different features and bugs of their own. In the end it's just a matter of choice and preferences, spread love not hate ✌️
For me the biggest thing that an Android phone has is you can install third party apps that's the best thing i like and yeah, hell lots of features than i phone. Rest iPhone is okay
outstanding video too! I agree with everything.
Mkbhd biased
Man I don't agree with this Android is good
Nothing literally "nothing"🗿
Why did you use flagships for some categories, but all Android phones for others? I know this is just for fun, but it feels weird
used android for a few years, but recently got an iPhone 13 pro. so far I’ve been loving it, but i miss the USB-C cable. lighting kinda sucks imo
Apple shills... so sad.
noice :D
For most of these categories, in my opinion, Android won. I use a Pixel 6 Pro and I love how many features it has and integrates and how well it does it. I love the cameras. I love them more the Note 20 Ultra that I was using before. The interface is clean and nice looking. I very rarely have bugs and everything is quick and smooth. So for most of these categories, Android wins. I care about the environment but I feel like Apple does not. I feel like Apple is just using a bunch of company PR bullshit to save money. The iPhone SE is a sucky value. It's design is older than dinosaurs, the battery sucks, it lacks a lot of features compared to Android phones and iPhones. So Android wins for me
In my opinion, it isn't a question of who is the best. It's about who is the best FOR YOU. For example, for companies that need everything to work seamlessly, IOS is better. But for people who want more customization and features, Android is better. It is also a manner of preference.
The Dream team up
every android guy gets bashed so all the comments are about the collaboration
How much money did Apple give you?
8:11 Whenever I hold a hammer, I also feel the same way.
For me, personally, I will never buy an Apple product. I just hate the company and how they go to extraordinary lengths to make sure you never fix their products, and Many other reasons. Right now I'm still using my Note 10+, but I'm pretty sure my next phone will be a Sony.
I'm surprised by the environmental score going to Apple. Apple phones while made from recycled materials are made in such a way that makes repairs very difficult compared to most Android phones. One could argue that Apple's poor repairability contributes more to e-waste than Androids. Surprised that didn't get a mention.
The key takeaway from the video is that - there are different android phones which beat the iPhone at different individual tasks however the iPhone is the perfect overall champion
waiting for  all androids to gather and put and end to this debate (IOS) ,ya looking for an better OS but if all android companies launches their prices like apple does then they can also catch up.Honestly waiting for samsungs nxt flagship i know their 22ultra didnt go well so they would give us an extradinary one i guess
Marques on team apple.
Massive pillars in "US" not the rest of the world
2 apple users like apple the better. insane.
They're too close to care about which one looks best on paper. It honestly just comes down to which one you prefer
*iPhone winning* Me who watches this on an iPhone: “WHOOOO”
Apple creates its own problems like sharing files with other device And the still thing airdrop is innovation.
I just like the many android OS available, they r just was more......"soothing" and "cleaner" than apple for my experience of both
And officially Android was killed 😂   Not lying at all but my Samsung F23 5g is working absolutely amazing. Ig android might just have the most compact interface relatively compared to iOS
I agree with MKB with the flat back and sharper edges of the iPhone
the video was ok, just becuse i knew the outcome. BUTTTT its great to see the "Techtuber" back together doing colabs.
Just think... Its not just about android vs ios!  Its samsung / google / vivo / moto / sony / oppo / oneplus / realme / xiomi / poco etc etc...                              Vs                  " iPhone "  We know who is the winner...
You still couldn't pay me enough to have another iPhone.
Always Android, baby...
Personally I can't use an Iphone basically anything apple because they are so restrictive to the point it becomes annoying with Android I can do what I want tweak what I want and make my phone suit my need but if the iPhone can't do it then it wouldn't do it and it's more prominent on their Mac if the Mac can't do something I need it to do I'll have to go to the app store and buy **note the word buy** an app that lets me do what I want and I don't just have that extra money while the other platforms already have a community that have fixed the problem for free. There was a YouTube channel where the host was daily driving a Mac and for mundane task that the Mac couldn't do he was buying software that worth up to $30 and it wasn't just one I mean I'm paying a lot of money for the Mac and I'll still have to pay to use it comfortably it doesn't make sense to me and the same applies for the iPhone
without watching i can say it should be the best smartphone video of the year🥂❤️
super video
Apple is better for average users (is better because is more easy to use) . But symbian  OS is the real mvp
hello you are the best
Whenever you two collaborated  The episode is getting better and  We are all excited
iPhone gang lets go!!!!
1:40 because I'm blind Apple fan and they pays me better than Samsung and by audience is mostly American iPhone user
Display : samsung makes for iphone  Performance : apple is year ahead of Android Battery: iphone pro Max shattered Android with less capacity cell Camera : iphone no doubt Environmental: iphone Software support: iphone  Pricing: droid Now what's your take ?
Let xiaomi 12 ultra come
The dream Collab for the tech world.
Cortana still available? Where?
I have used both an iPhone and an android, iPhone kills it in almost everything, security privacy, but customisations seem less, but now with ios 16 there’s some potential, and android, it seems to drop down, I currently use android and I am thrilled by the things I can do like just pirate apps, customise my device like a beast. But nothing can beat Apple. So I choose Apple. It’s worth that price you pay 💰
I have 2 Devices. iphones and androids. but I mostly use Android on Samsung. Samsung ecosystem is getting better
Android still gives you more options
This is a matter of personal preference. In 2022 you can use any of the two and get everything done perfectly. Personally I use both, but I prefer android as my main smartphone since I get more features and freedom.
i use many android brands in my country and compare it against iphone, i prefer iphone a lot for the smooth ui
Best of both worlds!
the warm light is awful 😖
First time i am disappointed in the video of arun like andorid is tons better so yeah
Once you said iphone display is equal / close to Samsung's display . That's all I need to say you are totally biased .
All Android king Samsung s22 Ultra,  but iPhone another world,
I'd consider an iPhone, I just don't like ios. I really like some of its features but I really hate the whole "all your apps are just lying there on your screen". Edit: oh wait seems like they changed that somehow now so once they use a real charging cable maybe I'll switch
They are clearly just "giving away" points to apple in this. G i wonder why. This was not a fair grading to either phone AT ALL. looks like their going into the mainstream toilet bowl.
Pixel pictures that doesn't get saved? Wtf? That has never happened to me with any Android phone.
Seeing how I am I samsung guy, in 1.5 years my s21u only died once. In 4 months, my s22u has never died
till iphones create a gaming phone like red magic i am sticking with android
Marques seems shy or uncomfortable.
I like that you did a Collab, and it was an interesting to see you guys debate certain things. But it shouldn't have been a "battle" because as always it remains a matter of taste. And to me iphone are just way to overpriced, so I stick to android because it fits in my budget.
We all know MKBHD is an iPhone lover but he doesn't tell it out
This video is rather Samsung vs iPhone
MKBHD the worshiper of apple and Mrwhosetheboss who isn't really an android fan or user is this fair ?
I feel like YouTubers have gotten increasingly divorced from what people even want in a phone
I had as much fun watching this video as much as MKBHD had being in this video. None.
MKBHD just loves Apple  I don’t really think this was necessary cos they’re all not perfect
iphone better
some of these categories should be weighted more imo
Nope no never would I give eco concious to iPhone. Did we all forget the chargers they removed so they can sell them in seperate boxes or remove the headphone jack to sell dongles and earpods. Not to mention the whole thing they do with a wasteland full of broken iphones.
Arun was so hardly defending android🤣🤣
17:59 “Androids IPhones”
I like it when these 2 meet
I'd never get a iPhone, cause android has a bigger screen and it does more. Great video 😎👍
I'm just hoping no one is badmouthing each brand
One thing that tech YouTubers don’t cover: ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES.   As a visually impaired user, I’ve used android, iOS, Mac, and windows. Despite having the same all OS’s having the same features in the accessibility settings, Apple implements it better with a few exceptions.  Where Windows wins is screen reader, Mac Voiceover is hard to use. For accessibility Apple wins everywhere else.
Bro please give me a i phone please
NICE!!!
Two tech reviewers has amazing point of view, MKBHD and Dave2D.. the rest just review phones.
Arun really trying to convince MKBHD to vote for android lmao😭💀
Superb🥰
I had the 13 Pro Max....it was very hard to handle...switched to the s22 Ultra and it felt way better in hand.
The last shot is on an iPhone 🤣🤣🤣
It's all a matter of preference
Hello
I do use split-screen quite a bit
You are considering Android phones as dummy. So why?  Why can compere with iPhone It's creating manoply in iPhone vs Android ? It's some reason dominating
I my opinion both are really good it up to your decision android and ios are both top class sofwares what you like more you take
i can live without an iphone but i cannot survive without an android. But I use both now. 2 phones. yeah
This was like😂😂 Android: We have Arun IOS: We have Marques
Samsung>>>  Its not even close
I love my s22 ultra screen and design so much that Im taking off my phone's case all the time when Im home just to admire the thin bezels, beautiful sharp edges and everything... Just cant go fully caseless all the time in case I drop this or scratch the backplate haha
I prefer Android for customization. But some people yet complain about performance and stuff, and my words on that is is, if you're buying a phone to game then go buy a gaming phone such as ASUS ROG then talk. I just don't like how iPhones are limited on customization(adding lockscreen customization is doesn't really count Android still can do tons of mote stuff).  P.s iPhones are also great tho, I don't hate them. I just hate their software.
"Matte Black Everything" -MKBHD
If the feature is on a certain or a few Android phones, then is it a feature/advantage of Android? It sounds like that is a phone advantage and not Android.
iPhone is like a lone warrior. One vs world of Android.... iPhone 👑
I miss the outro
Imagine comparing a whole community with a whole lot of variety and a solo brand
this is the best video yet
I never trust my iphone for anything you guys said, after a year or two the iphone is more buggy than any android ive had and camera wise its just not that good at all. Youre just not even spitting out believable facts, its like a video for dummies to market the iphone...fuck, youre world class reviewers, and you do such a shitty video???
I like and adore iPhone but Android gives you freedom and like you are not bound bye something.                                                     -a Samsung user
Always nice to stir the Apple vs. Android sides .. . However - in my opinion, they are pretty much the same for a normal person. For me, it is all about design. - For that, i actually do prefer Android, because the bigger competition (in the end, Apple only competes with Apple) - Android phones innovate a lot more in terms of looks (also other things, but i dont care much for those)  Android phones NEED to stand out .. they came up with popping cameras (many brands), Swivelling screens (LG Wing), spinning cameras (Zenphone and A80), manual sliders (Honor and Xiaomi Mix), underscreen cameras (ZTE) et cetera. Apple plays it too safely .. there is no design innovation.  On the other hand - Apple continously uses better materials (on its expensive flagships) - with stainless steel and maybe slightly better glass (if that ceramic shield is noticably better than the Victus+ type)  My problem with Apple - aside from the lack of design innovation - is that it still claims to be the artists, "special" fringe, creator and so on phone .. for "people in the know" - when it has become the definition of mainstream.   As for my current decision ... i have a 22 ultra, because i actually really use the stylus a whole lot - and Apple does not have a Note type phone. The rest falls in place. Because the phone is Samsung, so are my tablets etc. (thank you ecosystem..)
Android have amazing batteries and way better chargers and It's not even close
I was really excited for this video when I saw it (I'm subed to both), but man was this one sided. Android didn't even get a point for assistant, one of the biggest perks of using it.
Ooh, another collab between my favorite techs! Haven’t even watched the video yet but for the names and topic alone I guarantee I will! Someday, I hope to be up there sharing tech knowledge with the world too. Till then, it’s always cool to watch the success of two others!
I agree on all of these
One simple thing iOS can't do, you can't click on an text and edit it. You have to clear and retype lol.
IPhone small world
I feel like this video should've been called "MKBHD's take on Android vs iPhone"... xD
The two legends with my favourite content of all time !!🔥🔥🔥❤️🎉🎉
I am on innovations side
Iphone should not win the eco point because it still uses lightning
Awesome video!
Ok the fact he is in California.. I am guessing apple is winning 😂
Almost all the benefits to Apple require you to already know and like Apple. They lock you in. That makes Android the clear winner.
Well i really don't understand how ios get more gamjng like this review seemed wrong,  ur comparing it to like few sets of andorid while it provides varirty so far it sucks
The title should be ....which is better "according to Marcus"
Health is important. Is the routine stil on?
I dont agree with most of these categories, this is completely up to your preference and that is the case with marques and arun which have been using iPhones as their main phone, so ofcourse they pick that. The display on samsung especially is unmatched compared to iphone, Eco friendly makes no sense because repairing the phone is harder and stupidly expensive which forces you to buy a new iphone.
Why I would choose Android over iPhone? Free Spotify with no ads, browser with no ads, YouTube vanced
This Collab is Been waited a long time and I can't believe this Arun ur the person who is reliable enough so I can get a phone u suggest without a doubt ☺️☺️
Another successful collab😄
IM FINALLY A BIT EARLY
Eco friendly should go to android as they allow for more relatability
u dont notice Arun's British accent that much until Marques talks in American
Money talks with very less money we can get better or at least same level android phones
When i think about apple ecosystem  Yes with eyes closed always with iphone
What a nice collab i love it lol
biase just get iphone
I am the 69420 viewer lezz goooo
Brownlee was always in favour of apple... Lol... Jk
The best collaboration on YouTube
Android would  big
Regardless of what you guys say it’s all a matter of opinion. But realistically the phone that is  easier to use and is more compatible with other devices is the iPhone. Easier to set up, easier to migrate your files to it. Seamlessly works with all the other Apple products. That’s what makes it the better phone.
W
I prefer the iphone because it just works.
hiiiiii😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Used both I still prefer android
The scores would be closer if it was samsung or iPhone. If I am not using a samsung it will be an iPhone, I am not interested in any other android
Its funny couse iphone will stay like that for 10 years while other phones move on
I never had an iPhone but I consider 🤔 to change because consistent in improving.
Arun really caving in to everything Marques says
Lol what kind of comparison is it ...its just like fitting yourself in apple's best feature and comparing with Android and choosing iphone...just a biased views...lol... Android is far better in terms of performance battery and customisation still you choose iPhone 😂😂...for people coming in i already used iPhone and prefer Android ove it
This video is going to be every toxic apple fans' go to in an argument
Me using a realme c20 : yes yes android is quite unstable -_-
iPhone is >>>>
Why the hell MKBHD using galaxy for 1.5 years if iPhone is better?🤣
Overrated phone  iphone is a sect not a phone company only
Mkbhd~Arun ⚡
a really popular news recently in hong kong is a user bought a samsung s22 ultra aka the flagship thing and only rain coz like the samsung said it was waterproof and then the phone just broke
Unpredictable video
Thanks
When 2 iphone fanboys talks about android vs ios:
I think Apple funded this video 😳😆
yayyyy
Goats
Iphone all day because the privacy it gives and all features that androids don’t have.But sometimes there are experiences that we cant get on iphones and can get in android (ios user btw)
A question as old as time
Please give me a iphone 🙏🏻 iam a poor guy 😔pls pls
@3:21: We can multi-task more on Iphone but not on Ipads (coz of ipad-os), very weird
the title should be Iphone fanboys rating android vs Iphone.
I personally love iOS better than android, but they both are great in their own respects.  I just love how all my apple products work together flawlessly  not one to bash android just because I like apple   That is stupid and I can’t help bu laugh when I see people fighting over it
I prefer android because i can unpack zip files, can play emulators, can use it for pirated content, has a better file browser
for eco consciousness, apple also make 4 phones per year, which is gonna be easier to optimize and recycle than the many hundreds of androids that come out
best combo you can see ever ❤️
This is something I already knew the answer to, Apple all the way
Apple = bad security. All the devices are basically spyware devices that look at everything they aren't allowed to look at legally.  That's good enough for me. I like my privacy. Android can be completely modified (gotta love open-source code software) for better privacy, unlike Apple. [gotta have the coding/programming skills though]   I am not going to buy Apple because "it's the newest one", or because "it's the most expensive" or because "it looks shiny" or any other excuse as to why someone would purchase this awful product. Also the company has a "their way or fuck off" attitude. You are confined to only Apple everything. They aren't dramatically faster either. Also the company throttles devices to try to force sales on newer offerings. I have also heard a shit ton of horror stories about the Apple Repair Services too. Apple is an overpriced masonry brick that looks pretty and that's putting it politely.  A top end Android will surpass any Apple.  I will give it to Apple for their marketing. They are somehow getting people to buy these pieces of crap Spybot devices that are guaranteed to be throttled in the future.  Android will always be king.  Edit: I can't believe I forgot to mention the BIGGEST reason why I won't buy Apple. I am not going to support a company that has their California Designed Products built by child labor in China. Gotta love a phone built by slave labor in buildings with suicide nets outside each window (true story by the way). If you support Apple, you support Unfair Chinese Labor Practices.
The conclusion better not be another one of those "It's whatever your preferences is!" answers they typically are for these types of videos...
Android is still a winner for me because of the amount of customization it allows for the user. Like there's an app for literally everything, even if it's a very small and minor thing. You also have youtube vanced (I know it's been taken down but it's still available if you downloaded it before), launchers, a shīt-ton of widgets, not to mention rooting, flashing a custom rom. The iPhone may be a much more fluid and polished experience, but it's also much more limited and controlled and I really dislike that.
Arun looks different when the camera is right in front of him. I am talking about the outro
PIN ME
Iphones are just overall better phones, android do beat apple In one or two things which are gimmick for me
Are you going to talk about how you met up with Mark Rober a few days ago?
IPhone is just the best
comparison is really nice
everybody knows the answer and still watches
ANDROID
One note on the eco thing what about repairing the phone that should have been a much larger consideration
Two best tech YouTubers ever, I love it when you collab.
I want to be able repair my own shit and not be tied to one company for any accessories. Android is an easy one for me
This isn't actually a fair comparison because this is basically apple vs Samsung which if that was the case I'm OK with it but you said Android vs iPhone but you only use the Samsung as an example!
Did you host this discussion in 1974??
I knew Marcus would be a massive iPhone simp before even watching this
This video is going to be the most viewed video of all time on his channel
Can you please time stamp your videos thanks
Great Video Arun .
Android wins...☺
Thanks for unmasking the Apple fanboyish biased version of mkbhd...
It's interesting to hear that other people don't use the split screen feature on the Galaxy phones. I use it so often that when I tried to buy the iPhone 13 last year I had it for like a month and ended up returning it because I missed that so much. I didn't realize until then how important that was to me lol
honestly i feel like the only time i see iphone pro models is in videos cuz everyone i see with iphones is the standerd model so is it really fair to not consider the fact that the standered only has a 60hz screen when judging the screen?
love your vids.
Best collab ever!
After watching this, I realized MKBHD doesn't know much about tech.
Android is king ... Iphone is waste of money
ANDROID TO THE WORLD! 🌎
I live in South Asia and I prefer android. The OS is much friendly and flexible than IOS.  Not forgetting to mention that Apple stuff are stupid expensive here. Yup... Android.
Great Video Arun .
I have both. For business I prefer android Samsung and my private phone I kept iPhone
Mkbhd is an apple guy. So for a start when he thinks apple has the same screen as Samsung. It is already a done deal in opinions biasness
MKBHD is a apple fanboy clearly, he just refuse to give point where android is the clear winner
Android squad ✊
Mkbhd, i am in bro
Great Video Arun .
In the U.S. just go iOS. Seriously, Apple got a monopoly there and its just not worth dealing the anything else.
Iphones are so much bettter but androids are affordable. Thanks
andriod
Iphone is shit and i dont care about u gulls say
Love Your Videos Arun .Great Video Arun .
Nearbyshare ?
iOS users are just here to hear you say iOS is better
Love this collab, but Arun's legs are so distracting!
When Apple does something better, ok does not matter. When iPhone does something slightly better, gamechanger
In Battery department U should have choosen Android because Fast charging is the best thing u can get 😊& when it comes to photos vivo captures the best photos so again Android is the winner 😊
Mrwhosetheboss : Lets negotiate MKBHD                  : APPLE
The advantage of Android phone over iPhone is wide price range with decent quality at the price..... Like you could get decent phone with same or even cheaper than budget iPhone SE..... If Apple could do the same as Android phone maker did, they would dominate market entirely.... But either way, both platform is good..... Just buy with how much money in your pocket and what you need from a phone.....
Awesome video 🔥🔥👍
hi
BEST COLLAB EVER
I can't understand why the dudes have given iphone more Points than Android phones. With android you can do a lot more stuff, the camera isn't important even tho it's better in android for good quality you should use s external 4K+ in price camara. You shouldn't pay for something which don't give you anything good and only the basic stuff. Android just has a lot more useful features while apple make their devices slow after some time to "save battery". You might ague that you don't get updates on Android long. This is a invalid argument because you always can install new ROMs without the need of root Access.
I use android and would still prefer it since I am pretty used to it but the new features on the IOS so I can't decide!!!
Yes, FINALLY they collabed!!!!!!!!!
Android 🤝
I had to use an iphone recently because my phone had battery replacement and I hated it. Just not for me.
Generally, it's for personal preferences.
If you are not so techie person, want a straight forward approach in the mobile - go for iphone  If you are techie and wants to change every thing in the phone and willing to explore - go for android.   Both OS are great. You just need to choose where do you think you are comfortable using with. Lucky us we can make a choice.
I feel like some apple employees were in that room.
1min and 1k likes
Anyone else team iPhone?
You sound so Brit in this vid lol
I use multitasking all the Time
You really think iphone camera is better than vivo x80 ?! I have felling your not talking impartial
Finally someone understands me (MKBHD). 1:50
Before I watch the video, I want to say what I think is the “best”.   If you want a good camera that takes very consistent shots, iPhone is probably your best choice. You can’t go wrong with a pixel either, but it’s not quite as consistent.   If you want a good display, android. 4k 120 looks great on a phone, and many high end androids just have better and brighter screens.   If you want battery, iPhone again. The iPhone’s processor (A xx) is very power efficient when compared to android chips. The software optimization, and integration with the processor is unmatched.   If you want performance, iPhone wins again, in most circumstances. Apple so far has been able to produce a phone that doesn’t get very hot, even under pretty heavy workloads. Android phones probably have a faster chip, but they have to be held back because of thermals.   If you are going budget, android. There are many budget android phones, with very respectable specs. The only big downsides are usually the camera, and built in ads which can usually be turned off somehow.
You guys need to stop smoking
I agree with Marques. iPhone handles photos, performance, stability within the OS and third party apps and that apps are optimized for the phone instead of android's "one-size-fits-them-all" solution. Overall, iPhone will be the best phone you can buy on planet earth.
A collab we've all been waiting for. 👌
i kinda disagree but ye
uploaded 55 mins ago im so early
MKBHD is completely talking based on software experience ! Ne need more than that bro
How can you compare it like this? If youre gonna title the video android vs iphone than you should compare ios vs android, not samsung vs iphone.
MKBHD is a bit biased with some of the points def going to apple that shouldn't have.He def more in the apple ecosystem but furthermore great vid.
Sorry but I will never switch to Iphone as they can't install APKs which is ultra important to me and could you please change this video's name to iphone 13 pro max vs Samsung s22 ultra
Hai Fuckers IOS is far better than Fucking Google / Android whatever you say ........
Can't afford it but if I had a choice I'd go for the IPhone
Using Iphone 13😜🔥
After watching the video till halfway, just skipped it right thru to the end. Sorry, not on point. Purely biased.
Most controversial video in decades
Ist 7 min enough for me camera battery performance so for me iPhone it could be android for u but my use ability i phone is better
Why even they discuss this, just give 10 to iPhone 😡
Hey, you’re a big inspiration in the way that you are able to produce your videos, as well as being the person who introduced me to the tech world Luv the vids! Keep working hard on your health goals.
i was not expecting another collab!!!!
Marquees is quite biased in this video. First of all, the display.  IPhone has a lot of good things. Display isn't one of those. Not compared to S22 ultra's display at least.  Secondly, when he was arguing about features. Things like Imessage, and so....in Europe WE DON'T use those.  He is stating as facts things that are in HIS reality.   I don't think this video is an accurate representation of the reality.   IPhone is more easy to use? I call bullshit on that. Having both I would say that android is definitely EASIER to use. Things like the absence of a file manager on iphone is what made me buy an android....
Wow u guys are so far off from reality that its mind blowing tbh 😂
the winners are those who use both Android and IOS.
My 2 favorite tech review YouTubers in a collab. This is amazing
MKB with hands on any mobile looks like  a piece of cake...
apple fanboys go brrrrrrr
What would happen if Linus was here?
Phones feel safe around these two
Bro i usually respect the things in mrwhosetheboss's videos... But how, in which world can u even THINK of giving the iphone a win in ecoconciousness AND cameras??? The S22 Ultras cameras destroy the iPhone idk what these guys are waffling... Not to mention the design is miles better too! Come on arun, why so biased???
this is perfect since im getting a new phone soon
Very subjective. When they make the iDroid I'll be happy :-)
"Already saur"
Love your videos! But what happened with lighting / coloring on this one?
"This is actually so bright, that it feels bright" Yes the floor is made of floor
Great video, I have one problem though. It seemed very opinionated. It was always just "Would you rather do this or that on IPhone or Android?". Not a lot of facts and numbers.
Looking simply at specs iPhones do take the win but when you actually use the Samsung phone the difference is night and day between them. Apple cant compete.
Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Repairable and recycling go to Apple...
Tell me you are an apple sheep without telling me you are an apple sheep
yoo iphone best
As a person who used both apple and Samsung, I have a counter argument for litelarly every point you gave.  If you prefer something, it doesn't mean it is better.  Apple: makes crappy battery so they can sell a magsafe charger Apple: remove a headphone jack to boost the sales of their bluetoth headphones Apple: remove the charging brick  to be more eco friendly (in reality it mostly creates negative inpact because theese break and sooner or later you'l need another one anyways) Apple: looses a faight against self repair program, so they  start selling original parts for ridiculously high prices and overcomplification (smart but very evil) I can give you hunderds of more reasons apple sucks.  I am not an android fanboy, I just really hate apple because of ther stupid  and evil (but quite smart) practises.
Samsung all day long!!!
Hey! That's how Arun was able to visit Mark Rober's hidden science lab!
Android has a return key for all apps, end of the story
2022 and they still at it ? Move on. Some people choose Ios some Android.
none is better, its like a ball and chain in your pocket.
Generally speaking, neither are better than eacother to be honest as both have there advantages and disadvantages.
I can't wait for the mi 12 ultra ,iPhone 13 pro max, and the Samsung s22 ultra match up
Iphone’s will be alwayz iphone ❤️‍🔥🔥 Android need it become refined and smoother !
A lot of these points I don't agree with at all, especially iPhone getting ecoconscious, you only brought up the marketing jargon, in reality look how they manage their chargers and charging ports.
14 mins = 50k views 😳
i like the 69% on s22ultra
Biased video. Apple paid you well you two
Not I will not have to watch any tech video because iPhone won by way father.
Love your videos, keep up the effort ❤
The now awaited best video
Could you guys do another one but this time samsung vs iPhone
How about e waste issue with usb C
I was really hyped up for this one as it took over a week! As checking every hour, the impatient me got really impatient. But it did pay off.
Hello mrwhoistheboss i would really appreciate if you add ps2, psp, ps1 emulation in your review then it would be best in my openion i really encourage you to add that content in your reviews and i really enjoy your content ❤️
MKBHD Vs MWTBS
I think that it feels biased 😶
Android over ios anyday
i also prefer the s21 ultra over the s22 ultra because it has better battery life, it is way more comfortable especially in portrait and also i prefer the look of the s21 ultra
I love how it's android vs apple... this way apple seems better because when samusung is better then it's like oh but all other androids are shit so it's now a draw 😂😂
I sense controversial comments.
Feel like the video was just to subliminally diss android 😕
Not the collab we deserved, but the collab we needed👍
I would still use android no matter what  and have a iPhone to show i can afford it
Android can be too detailed when it comes to personalization and all the other things, but once you get the hang of it, Iphone will literally be an antique experience cuz the lack of control over the phone, but points to iphones's reliability and responsiveness, cuz that thing is fasstttttt!!!!
dislike
Legit the exact same opinion as brownee on the flatness of the iphone. I like the aesthetic plus I think it feels better than the rounder phones
2 iPhone lovers talking about which OS is better. Anyone can guess the results.
dislike
dislike
Arun woke up and chose to initiate a war.
After S22U experience, not gonna go back to Apple.
dislike
love mkbhd haha
Team Galaxy!!!
atleast madara is dead
This test is like comparing Rolls Royce to Mercedes, Rolls would win most of the tests just because it’s a niche product against Mercedes that has a wide range of cars. Kinda flawed. Should’ve been Apple against Samsung imo. Great fan of you both.
Nice vid
Iphone, don't be stubborn, give an app tray, it's such a small thing that would make you perfect. Those square icons all over the screen, naah, that's hard to ignore
Android 💯
1000th comment
I sense just a hint of bias.... I'm half way through the video and it's 4.5 to 0.5. Good points gone through, but Android deserves more.
Android Is always a first choice for me , but I think apple is great with the looks and stuff.. it looks like very high quality.
Omg. Sorry guys, but that's so biased. The photo point AND the display point are objectively ridiculous.  I would totally agree with video, I would totally agree with battery for the iPhone. But come on....
Android all day
In my opinion this is one of the most professional tech video ever.
Great video but iPhone vs Android can never be Apples to Apples comparison (pun intended) coz literally iPhone is a Phone and Android is an os inside almost all phones (except phones considering you use one of these 2 and not something else) So between Android and iPhone choose according to your budget and on which device the thing you want to do can be done and personal preference and if you have no money problems buy both so best of both worlds This comparison would be equal if Android was also made my only one company (both hardware and software) like Google Pixel still not 100% equal comparison coz both have different pros and cons but much closer than current comparison
999
In conversation you can cut down the texts it clutters the shot
I feel good to  see both of you one screen 🙃🙃
1:35 is just Arun and Marquez fighting but politely.
W crossover
the editing lacks in this video  not being rude just a feedback  just less energy compared to the other videos
Google is better for people who like to tinker. Apple is better for people who just want something that works out of the box. Android is a mid tier gaming PC. iPhone is a high end gaming console.
One of the TWO LEGENDS in Tech space except TECH BURNER 🔥🔥🔥
I love that those YouTuber who are competitior are collaborating
MKBHD you're bias. This is I unsubscribed from your channel
Can I get an iphone pls
Honestly, the only time I'd buy an iPhone is when budget would not matter to me. If you work with a budget android is better 100% of the time
“The most boring team to watch is often the best one”                  ~ Mkbhd 2022
Notice
You're compering the best iphone can offer and average android? What kinda sense does that make
Tim cook after watching this video: Its time to increase the cost of all apple products by 20%. 🙁🤣
Video sponsored by @apple 😂 Jokes apart apple is the 🐐 Stable performance best software experience
How much do you like mkbhd and Arun collabs ?  Me : yes
I disagree in the eco friendly part. Apple literally forces you to buy a new iphone if you break it
I choose android
Both are great. It just depends on what you want. I prefer android, however, iPhone isn't bad. It's all based on what you want. Some people will try to argue what is better, but it's more based on what you want
Imagine if they started fighting at the feeling of the iPhone flats, And the Samsung curve.
Love that collab
You should compare a Samsung to an iPhone, not android to iPhone. Android to iOS would have been a better comparison, just saying. Love the video tho
Always android
🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻 commenting without watching video because i am watching early 🤣
Thor love and thunder trailer song 9:51
Android is best
Love you both.. Its epic you guys coming together to dicuss probably the biggest question in tech today.. :D
I choose android for us live in Africa android works better that's IOS
Here before this video gets a BILLION views... Cause it just might considering the topic and two of the best tech personalities.
I'll never use an iPhone cuz of customization oh and everything is free on my android and I can side load anything I want oh and dex
Subjective!
Yeah, Apple should get a point deducted for its "eco friendlyness". They don't care and you got bamboozled by their marketing. If they were eco conscious, they would not block you from getting parts (chips, cameras, batteries, screens and everything else).
Android, king of the hill. Period.
iphone battery better than android?
The Galaxy I have both and the 13 too heavy and you can't open multiple apps at once
It's basically Samsung vs iPhone again😂
🗿
Man you can't do shit with the iPhone only take photos and talk on discord But with the android you can do almost everything Mod, edit, hack Android>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>iPhone
it is sad that they are not considering oneplus , oneplus settled
pls stop hate to android ok? only 2.5 to android.
hiiiiiiii- Make this the most liked commenT?
WHY WOULDN'T YOU PUT SAMSUNG FLAGSHI VS APPLE FLAGSHIP??
The NOTCH !!!! And iPhone wins  display ????? What a iPhone biased show ..
Samsung!
Marques sounds tired
i love these videos
Next video Samsung all item
me, whose barely heard of MKBHD: oh, it's mkhdb dude
The power this collaboration holds...
Before watching I recon your gonna say iPhone....let's see if I'm right...
I think the topic of this video was more of a cliche. We want something that is in depth and which we already don't know about, from these great colabs. Great video though!
Of course the iPhone wins, all Apple products are killing lately.
Life lesson by MKBHD "When You Have A Hammer, Everything looks like a nail." 💯
Till 6:29  Mkbhd seems iphone fanboi  Letsee what happens next
iPhones are so fucking shit and pointless
I don't understand how you can give the display a draw and this is coming from an iPhone user. My friend owns Galaxy S22 ultra and it is miles better than my iPhone 13 pro screen.
This sort of computation makes no sense. You're trying to compare a brand of high-end smartphone to every other smartphone on the market. An iPhone vs Samsung S/Note series comparison would be much better
I love when you guys do videos together!!
I usually agree with you, but this time, NO. They literally said that iphone displays are as good as androids. You shouldn't just compare the high-end phones, apple's 900 dollar phone will ship with 60 hz in 2022, where androids do it for 300 dollars. If you gave a draw in display, you should've gave them a draw in battery as well because of actual "fast" charging. You drawed android and apple in customization, just get a Samsung and dig deep enough, you just doubled your customization features.
Well if you’re poor and loser of a fan boy/girl then both phones are great in their own way.   I left Samsung after so many years to try apple and I’m having fun time but if I get bored then I’ll just jump back to Samsung SIMPLE
Not the fruit-based logo for sure
Yes my first sub 5 comment
Just renember that the iPhone's battery is better at the start, but it just starts slowing down too fast, and then samsung wins in the long run
You guys forgot about something in the Eco Consciousness section, Androids are super repairable but apple doesn't even allow you to change any parts of it device   edit:(guy's im not saying android should win this one im just pointing out that they forgot to mention repairability which should be varying factor in eco consciousness )
When two introverts hang out..
Me Says Hennlo
The best duo
People argue about iPhone having a better software support but i don't get it...... Android ROMs are a whole new side of it.
I wish I had an Xbox series X
Hi all
Android 👍👍👍👍👍
1sf
i am using iphone 13 now but i really miss my android oneplus 6, android is better 100 percent, people say iphone is stable, my foot stable
Which is better, petrol or diesel?
Omg this is so so ridiculous!!! I was just tapping videos on youtube so boringly even watching old videos on both of channels, a little later thinking about shutting the pc down as there's nothing to watch... Then home feed shows this up & I'm freaking excited I took some screen shots too!!! Favorite YouTuber... Not one!, BUT 2 most favorite tech channels. One of the awesome video you can expect of. Android & ios. And last BUT not least 2 very best falsghip king smartphones in the world, Current leaders in the smartphone world, we know except the iPhone Samsung is the king and here I am an iPhone13 Pro Max user 🥰
I honestly HATE the android feel but that’s just me
ios is better
mkbhd is biased towards apple lol
I gotta say, Arun, this video is really pleasant to watch because it is so calm, hope to see more like this in the future
Samsung  phone best and  A to z Grande  and apple piece high
Oh God, its 2014 again with iOS vs Android
The Video Is Intended To Show iPhone Better. 🙂
I prefer android because of it's endless possibilities. Apple feels claustrophobic
It's a fact he only loves iPhone but then Samsung can beat iPhone it's just that it's so premium and the looks too
How can you talk about best screen on Android and not even mention Foldables?
This is the biggest collaboration we ever wanted!
Sponsored by Apple
I like both but samsung is killer
What the hell apple and samsung tie in display segment this indicates it the worst comparison i think apple paid them I'm leaving
I disagree with the comparison you did on the battery life, android wins on my take.
I'd rather use S21 U than S22 U
i have a iPhone 12 pro max
How can display be a draw when apple has a notch?
Android Is way better tbh i still uses his S9+ it has no cracks 4k quality when I play codm I go like 9ms-20 it gives me a crazy advantage it's why I'm one of the best codm player I get 50-60 on average and 30+ using a pistol only
I dont think that iphone 13 pro needs much battery 🔋
Its just an austistic iphone fan. Dont take it to seriously..
the collab we want 😍 😩
bottom line : marques is a proud Apple sheep.
2 mins agoo damn it still did love it thought should write a good comment to get a heart , but don't have time . Maybe he will have pitty on me and give one . Btw bigg fan .
Android is good
Weirdly I don't feel like it was a fair comparison 😂😂
*Woohoo 🙌 when you're early MRWHOSTHEBOSS video 😎😍*
Apple 🍎 Always Better for health and for  uses👍🏻
I would choose iPhone, the more latest models atleast. The overall ease to use and the performance, the smoothness, the quality overall and ofc the software support is probably the deal for me! The design which everyone is complaining abt is not of a big issue for me as long as I have a well rounded phone! I also think despite of the little outdated design its still beautiful!
So two iphone users sit in possibly apple headquarters after the ios 16 announcement invited by Apple tell us "objectively" the iPhone is better. Yeah, no thanks.
I'm surprised Mark being dark skinned with the pixel 6 can accurately represent darker skin tones unlike the iPhone
Today this both brands are dreams in sri lanka 😔
Ahh yes the Virgins are making videos together
Haha iPhone won! Android sucks
According to me Android....
I wanted to stop watching the video when you decided that it's a tie for the first category "screen"
The worst thing about iphone is it reduces brightness while intense gaming and the selfie camera in night worse than Samsung. Otherwise no android can beat iPhone in any department.
A video!!!
Idk who the other guy is but I firmly believe he's iphone biased. Samsung s22 ultra, Mops the floor against apple with the exception of security.
Simply get what looks great for you. Software is one thing, hardware is another. I wouldn't give up the camera on my S22U for anything other than the 13 Pro Max's battery life.  For casuals, iPhones are amazing phones to recommend by default. For us absolute geeks, at least I wouldn't give up Android for simplicity.
2 legends of tech history meet
I'm lazy leaving a comment here, after you watch please tell me the answer. iPhone or Android. Thanks!
To more videos with both of them in it❤️
For me it all comes down to what OS you like the most or are comfortable with.. it's Android for me hands down!
Im a creative. For seamless productivity and integration, i prefer Apple's ecosystem.
Your comparing Mini PC with Sim slot Iphone with android?, that is terrible comparisons
Mrwhosetheboss and Mhbhd, i beg you guys to start a new channel with both of you together, brooo you guys will be the monopoly lonewolf of youtube tech channels, pls❤️🔥
Keep apple happy.. 😁😁😁😁
Xiaomi Mi12 ultra?
The colab we needed😂
Hi
They seem to bias
After seeing you with Marquez in the Mark Rober video i kinda saw this coming
I would always choose iOS I don't know why it just feels better
For me Android & iOS are very different in a way they are incomparable!!
Samsung and iphone not android and iphone
So ok I forgot what my comment was about because there is a little emoji bar at the bottom and When it press one it pops up on the video….. but what happens after that. What is the point of this
There's no perfect phone unfortunately but this video tells a lot of information!
Android like the nasty thing in your hand 🤚🏻
What i feel about Android vs ios is like PC vs PS.
iPhones for me
Using both 🤣🤣
I pray that everyone is having a blessed day and night so far in the Lord Jesus Christ name amen.!!!!
I bet android companies would watch this video to beat iPhone in future 😂
Apart from the phones, who has a better accent, ? MKBHD or WHOSETHEBOSS.
Ey
nice
Whomever read this I pray that everyone is having abundant health in the Lord Jesus Christ name amen.!!!!
Love you Both 😍😍👍
OMG😱 Please do more video with mkbhd!!!!! Its really satisfying to see you with mkbhd!! 👍
iphone
Apple iPhone has a Samsung Display, even the storage is made by Samsung.
Wow congrats for 10M subs. I were here since 72k subs Mrwhosetheboss. I'm so happy that you reach 10M subs😊
It's said on the part of Android that not Google Pixel (Stock Android) but Samsung's One UI is representing on their behalf in competition with Apple and it's IOS.😢
I want to use an iPhone since my friends swap music projects using garage band all the time. But I can't get rid of the headphone jack so I have to use android for now. Maybe in the future I'm buying an iPhone just for work
I have both.. IPHONE is way better
Android
Having both phones and even on iPhone data package is being paid by my company, Android is still daily driver for me. Top notification bar is the main reason i hate iPhone. Using iPhone i fell like I am still in 2015.
I would choose android not because of the affordability but because of the nostalgia factor. My first phone was an android and I just can't give it up now.
I would genuinely Choose ANDROID Bkz i can't Afford Iphone🤣.my channel is not mmonetized so...
Why don't you have a say, why are you always asking him questions when it's your channel.  He has probably been using iPhone for the rest of his life, so I don't agree with you guys.
Who likes Android? Like my comment
This is so bad
Yea I would recommend android, ROG gang here
Didn't realise I was early
Android better
Samsung (best Android) > iPhone (iOS) > other Androids (the rest of Androids)
Love u always my best channel
The collab we never knew we needed 😃
Iphone is good but.. some android phones are better.. not all... Like Samsung,.. in Nigeria we have Techno. It's not really a good android phone.
Haven't seen Milo and Simba in a while. Are they doing good?  Please give them a hug each from me 🤗
ive had iphones ,ive had androids.......i choose samsung lol
*Realme laughs in 150W Charging
Keep up the great content arun!
Tbh Samsung deserved the screen department, but great vid otherwise!
I am a simple girl, i see a MrWhoseTheBoss x MKBHD collab, i click on it
Apple. Obviously
i  was using always samsung for 20 years and always saying that iphone is shit but this year i decided to buy an iphone just to try it i took the iphone XR and FINALLY i understood the real meaning of a smartphone so fast and 0 lags and the camera is just perfect . I WILL never ever buy an android again i will go for an iphone 13 now .
In my opinion phones are so good you bearly notice the difference, so its all prefrance
games come early on android not iphone 2:19
The thing is iPhone is being compared to sooo many phones nd each Android is good at a particular thing like gaming Rog phone or display Samsung nd iPhone is good at them all tells you a lot about which is better . (I am an android user)
so much biased
I also like the flat edge and u marques you wear ur watch on ur right I also pls  Pin this very pls
My fav youtubers collabing...... goals
And an iPhone has more restrictions
Have been waiting for this video since forever, soo happy you uploaded it. You're the best youtuber arun
Always Android 🫂🫂🫂
I'm all for Android never had an iPhone an gotta be honest the look an feel of iPhone is definitely superior imo jus feels more solid
EARLY GANG
Bruh mkbd fricking likes iPhone he srsly charging off android is 10 times better
I generally prefer android as it offers more stuff that I'm looking for
Is it just me or Arun's voice sounds different ?
the timestamp is 20:22😂 this year is 2022
Kiss me Atrun, am not a bot.
I'd say they're half and half because of all of the android phones out there with so many more features than any iPhone on the market now.
Samsung has always been my thing from tha start
Why did i get a barbie ad on this video
Theres no Better type of phone it depends on who you are and what you prefer.
Best Real Life International Bromance?
first time early O.O
If android won still don't what phone to buy It she be a mix of all phones
The combo all techie will love 😘
Yay finally a new videoooooooooooo also under 10 mins
Imo theyre both pretty much the same. Expet android can download things outside of it appstore. And thats why i like android more. Besides that they are the same to me.
Hola
MKHB seems like is supporting iphones. Not judging though
I'm on the first comparison and it's amazing they have different views and preference. Will finish this immediately.
Most awaited video for me 🥰
MKBHD compares the phone on personal interest than the phones abilities, features etc
Android. Period. And this is coming from a former Apple user.  Apple hasn't been innovative in almost a decade.  Their phones are god ugly. And everything that they have incorporated to revamp their OS over the last few years,  they've gotten from Android.  🤷🏾‍♂️. These dudes dont even have super fast charging and finally getting an AOD .....in 2022🤣
Love an MKBHD collab. Apple for the win 🏆
Damn 5 minutes ago?
(insert rickroll here)
The best phone it's the one we made along the way
I can’t tell if those chairs looks comfy or not
This is not Android vs Apple IT is a Apple  Vs samsung
Android and its not even close
Third
Early lol
Cool video!
wow !!!!! another collab
You guys don't game obviously my red magic 7 pro smokes any iPhone in every way in gaming my iPhone just gets hot and then the screen dims its horrible for hard-core 4hr gaming sessions
Can we have a comment section that accepts other people’s viewpoints? Please?
Whats phone is the blue color and which phone won?i cant find out whats green and whats blue
iPhone ❤️
Conclusion: its your opinion, your choice, what you want, regardless of who won, the winner is what makes you happy
Could you test an phone called infinix note 12 vip Please :) ?
both are good but why the hell iphone doesn't let me pause a video recording, or change camera, or record from multiple camera, i mean how much effort does it take to give these really useful feature?
Men me i prefer the samsung❤🤙
rtugjiofeakds ur vids are kool
To summarize in just 2 sentence (what Arun once said in his S21U vs iPhone 13 pro max): Samsung (Since Samsung is the iPhone of Android): What could be done iPhone: How it should be done  Anyway, why is MKBHD talking so slow ? Is he nervous like sitting for a physics or chemistry viva ? 🤣🤣
Thanks Arun and Marques  This is the video we've all been waiting for The Collab makes it just *wow*
Honestly I stick with andriod mostly because of Samsung not so much the actual software. Imagine Samsung's hardware with Apple's software though 😳  that would be THE phone imo
Both phones are good at different things. It depends on what you want as an user. Do you need the iPhone's reliability OR The amazing customizability, infinite options and usually cheaper price of Android?
I love this vid
Marques Brownlee partner with Arun Maini because he is LOSING views lately!
The war is finally over
Andorid best
Android ♥️
Trillions of views
I was just android lover until I used iPhone from January
damn mkbhd looks jacked
Let's be honest, i don't even know more facts about my redmi phone than the upcoming 2025 iphones, and still here to gain even more knowledge
I honestly love both brands.  I'd go for Android though since you can customize!!  Have the Galaxy s21 Ultra 😎
you are best creater
Android any day
les go
I didn't watch the video didn't need too but Android is better nuff said.....Have a nice day I still gave you a THUMBS UP
This is a great video
I prefer android because it's more flexible and less restrictive but that doesn't mean iphone is bad apple has outstanding technology just my opinion
Can I get a heart?🙏🏼
I just yesterday switched back to Apple after 5 years. Mrwhosetheboss are you watching me? 👀
Apple<=>Samsung😬😊
Bought s22 ultra instead of note 10 plus. No sense to pay more. (yeap. It is better but not batter as u should pay for it)  Also hate that they move buttons and stylus. And it too fat
Damn
This just seems like a podcast shortened into a video
EARLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMGGGGGGGGG
I prefer iPhone, but that's not to say there's anything wrong with Android. Just personal choice.
Funny how this video is iPhones vs dozens of different android companies
ayo new vid?!?
Hello
bro I never knew Arun has a tesla
I think this is the perfect video to get an exact 50/50 dislike ratio
I would generally chose android as I am quite used to overall having the time to use the throughout my day, and it is very efficient and convenient for me as my daily driver. However I do also love Apple products as well, so innovative and nice looking
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
iPhone is approaching Android level customization slowly. It's hard to see how android will improve from this point.
What is name of this channel? Mrwhosetheboss  "Mr whose the boss" or "Mr who set he boss"
I have 6gb ram on my 250$ phone
It’s a good video guys!
Haven't used ios for long but still not prefer er an iPhone
No rickroll??
first
Controversial Topic I know, what's your take? 😂 To check out my Best Phones of 2022: https://youtu.be/0i4z5tqRzPg
Hello I would use a pixel but that is not a option so I would choose iPhone.
I would generally chose android as I am quite used to overall having the time to use the throughout my day, and it is very efficient and convenient for me as my daily driver. However I do also love Apple products as well, so innovative and nice looking
Both are good at their place, apple make their own chips whereas android buy it from other companies so in this case apple is kinda better but android is also rocking
F
For the algorithm 👍🏽
Nice touch with dent in the "DENT" word😂
as per my option is apple but if u want in a good price and go for android
Informative video
One of the best collaborations on YouTube
⬇️Team Android here
I prefer smasung over the iphone
You guys should fight
did anyone notice there was dent in the dent
LOL my Samsung has 256 gigs
Let's go new video
If you pin my comment I’ll Rick roll Elvis Presley granddaughter
Amazing video
😎
Bro this not fair
Great video
These guys voices are so nice to listen to😩especially mkbhd
It is good to see the two tech giants in one video again to debate the two giant operating systems ... Both Take Care ❤️ and My Operating System preference is Android 🔥 I don't care about iOS 👎
Never been this early
Android is cool and all, but the sure amount of support and just the luxury feel you get from an iPhone is just unmatched
bean
I was waiting for almost an hour after arun tweeted bout the collab!!!
"Better" is one of those words that always comes down to personal taste. You do you; I'll continue to do me.
Two  tech mobile giants together Both of them are my Mobile online teacher It's a great pleasure to see them together 🖤
im early :)
They keep spoiling us with the collabs 😩😩😩😩😩😩
Some people's still not know that the iphone screens are made by Samsung.
Comment 622
I Really enjoy your videos,they really help
Even if samsung had better things then iphone not gonna lie i would still buy the iphone😂😂😂
totally finished watching the video
The two goats 🐐 in one video , of course the videos got to be goated,hopefully they can make more videos like this
mrwhosetheboss + MKBHD is like a heaven meeting of two geniuses. 👍❤️🎉
Hi MrWhosTheBoss I love your vids keep up the amazing content
I just love how he posts very fast even though the videos take a long time to make. He is one of the people that puts real effort in his videos and. In one of his videos he said how he is feeling and what's happening to him lately. People really should appreciate his effort 😄
In my opinion, it isn't a question of who is the best. It's about who is the best FOR YOU. For example, for companies which need everything to work seamlessly, IOS is better. But for people who want more customisation and features, Android is better. It is also a manner of preference.
Arun always makes the best videos hats of to mkbhd too
Heyyyy
The fact that he still makes videos and didn't take a hiatus is impressive. Great dedication Arun!
We can agree on the context that ne never fails us with his content
Daddy !!
thank you mark rober for making this video possible :)
before watching the video : i have recently switched from note 20 ultra to 13 pro max and i just cant imagine going back to android since its so god damn sluglish now that i have used ios.  after watching the video : really do agree with mkhb on alot of things
The collab we've been waiting for!! 👍✨
Lessgo
Early
I love samsung ❤️❤️
two legend 🤘
if I am not wrong these guys went to mark rober's crunch lab(in mark's new video)
Android vs iPhone, so an OS vs a smartphone. Nice.
A phone is a phone. Phone wars in 2022 is childish
I swear if this is some it prefers in yourself kinda answer.. Then they can f off.
Exceptionally amazing video Absolutely worth it 😊
Android solos iPhone
I came here one minute after the video was uploaded and it has already 2k likes
Morbius is the most movie ever
Who cares it really doesn't matter there both good but android isn't in phones it's in the oculus quests
Isn't this Galaxy vs iPhone? 💀
1:09 haha 69%, love the vids arun haha. Keep it up
I would prefer samsung display
One of the first comments I prefer tech fails
The major two features iPhone is better than android, is  software (privacy) and body
Dope🔥
Android is fun
I prefer Android, because it has a more Open and flexible operating system compared to IPadOS/IOS
hi
why not both because i love both a w4r th4t n3v3r 3nd
God bless everyone watching and reading this
hi
I'll always choose my android over an iPhone any day any time
I don’t think one is better than the other. Every phone has advantages and disadvantages.
Do you do giveaways?
loved the spirit that arun makes and good explanation too
521st comment 😌🥰🖤
Though IPhone would be trendy but everyone knows in their Heart, nothing could beat a Good Android 🥰

Finally, tnx was really helpful
This right here is the one of the most sought after collab I have been looking forward to! Two of the most influential Tech Giants of all time.
Team Android, hit like on this comment❤️
gift me iphone 🙂
Both of them are holding phones the other prefers
Iphone looks good on paper as I cannot afford an iphone as of now
In conclusion ...  Apple has waited fr all the Android's major updates and learnt the good ones and have updated them in the IOS 💁🏼‍♀️
793rd viewer!
Patiently waited for this 😂
Yoooo Arun!! I started my fitness journey inspired by you and I literally went and started gym the next day your video came out . Started seeing significant result in my mental health the most and even my clothes started fitting me better 😂😂
Well...      Let the war commence :) I'll start. Android is better.
Gotta love an Arun and Marques video 🔥

Passion fruit solos both high diff 🥱

I have been waiting for this since u went to the apple park🤗
Mkbhd be like: I have been using these Android and IOS versions for past 2 months
Love the Collab and the video

2nd comment! Hope you're progressing with managing your health well :)
You can see him slimming down now. Amazing improvement from Arun
And so the legendary battle has been restarted...
THE best combination of creators.
1st!
THE ONE YOU HAVE IS BETTER.
e
Both of my favourites in the same video yet again 🤲🏾
Both have its own pros and cons and it good to have competition. Imagine Apple being the best of all things. Company will reluctant to changes.
everybody gangsta untill you realise that you're 2nd :)

Garadge tour as well please request 🙏
Phone👍

I knew it!! In the last video when you said you were doing a collab I definitely thought it will be mkbhd and it is. Will comment further after watching the entire video.
Apple always looking for Android to introduce new features so they can master them
Wow ! that a good collaboration there !!!
Hi from Kenya 🇰🇪 wishing everyone a great time
the two goats in one video
I would generally chose android as I am quite used to overall having the time to use the throughout my day, and it is very efficient and convenient for me as my daily driver. However I do also love Apple products as well, so innovative and nice looking designs . Although I am not taking any sides but I slightly do to have a preference of using my Samsung S22 Ultra
But iPhone is a phone and android is an operating system😳
I prefer iPhone, but that's not to say there's anything wrong with Android. Just personal choice.
Thank you for doing this video! You made it just in time! I am currently considering between android and iPhone!
Bro personally I am iphone
Your content is fire
Oh i so much waiting for this video!
Pls Pin me 🙏🤘✌(I tried to find the heart emoji)

Android or iOS I will choose Android because he has and unique features and more hidden settings but I was I think so this whole and tough but I like to hear from iOS more hidden settings and more features like to share in my child to I am doing and Android only based but if I get an iphone do the same thing for you video 🤩
2 big brains together
Don't you just love when a new notification comes up saying "Mrwhosetheboss has posted a new video" it just makes me so happy.
