‏Evidence of the Corruption of the Christian Religion # Texts about the Crucifixion of Christ ‏1. Matthew 27:25 and Mark 15:25 state that Christ was crucified at the third hour (nine in the morning), while John 19:14-16 states that Christ was crucified at the sixth hour (noon). ‏2. Matthew 27:51-53, Mark 15:38, and Luke 23:45 state that the curtain in the temple was torn at Christ's crucifixion, while John 19:31-37 does not mention this event.  ‏# Texts about the Resurrection ‏1. Matthew 28:1, Mark 16:1, and Luke 24:1 state that the women went to the tomb at dawn, while John 20:1 states that Mary Magdalene went to the tomb in the dark. 2. Matthew 28:2-4, Mark 16:5, and Luke 24:2-4: One or two angels are mentioned at the tomb, while John 20:12 mentions two angels.  ‏# Texts about Genealogies ‏1. Matthew 1:1-17 and Luke 3:23-38: Different genealogies of Christ are mentioned, differing in names and order.  ‏# Texts about Events ‏1. Matthew 21:1-7, Mark 11:1-7, and Luke 19:28-35: Christ entered Jerusalem on a donkey, while John 12:12-15 mentions Christ entering Jerusalem on a donkey, but without many details.  ‏# Explanations for these contradictions ‏1. _Theological interpretations_: Some Christians interpret these contradictions as revealing different aspects of theological truth. ‏2. _Historical analyses_: Some scholars interpret these contradictions as resulting from the historical and cultural traditions of the writers. ‏3. _Differences in narratives_: Some scholars interpret these contradictions as resulting from differences in oral narratives before the Gospel was written.  This is why Islam is the truth. Verses from the Quran  Here's the translation of the Arabic verse (Quran 4:46) into English: Among the Jews are those who distort words from their [proper] usages and say, "We hear and disobey" and "Hear, and may you not hear well" and "Ra'ina" [Malfprmed to mean 'heed us,' but can also mean 'our evil shepherd'] by twisting their tongues and ridiculing the religion. And if they had said, "We hear and obey" and "Hear and look at us," it would have been better for them and more upright; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they do not believe except for a few.  ‏The Quran was preserved by God Almighty, but the Torah and the Bible were preserved by humans, so they were distorted.  Here's the translation of the Arabic verse (Quran 5:44) into English: Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and light. The prophets who submitted [to Allah] judged by it for the Jews, as did the rabbis and scholars by that with which they were entrusted of the Scripture of Allah, and they were witnesses to it. So do not fear the people but fear Me, and do not exchange My verses for a small price. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers.
Fantastic song. But it's really boring when they go playback. That's a middle finger to your fans. In my opinion it's the autotune and all electronics. They can't really replicate that in the real world.
Best song ever
Absolutely love The Weekend and this song never gets old!!😊
Is there any People?
I thought the room will move like Jamiroquai

Thanks boys The Weeknd is best singer of ever and he your girlfriend  eh Azming thank you never back down
Thank you bro  love it and I’m singer like The Weeknd and of The Weeknd it love save your tears like me
The Weeknd what’s up
No suena igual sin el autotune 😢😢😢
3:35 😍😍
His man doesn't need autotune. He has natural talent and a voice so pure that autotune will ruin it.
Don't fool yourself  .  .  .  this dude does not make a record without running it through AutoTune.  Listen closely - if you cannot spot it out - you are musically challenged.
Brilliant ❤
Você disse Dona Mariana que eu não poderia fazer a minha história sem fim    .. .como uma lenda verdadeira que superou seus Ancestrais e que tem uma História tão excelente de Espírito quanto as deles
Dizem que as pessoas não conseguem escrever uma história sem fim. Mariana (eu escrevi essa poesia para cantar a minha lenda sem Fim....eu sou a Lenda.
Antonio e Mariana assistindo História sem fim
But man I love the guy with his very heart-wrenching voice backed-up by ariane equals 1b views...wonderful from the philippines!!!
Why is it download not allowed is it copyrighted
I heard you singing in an empty room , i could tell you were auto tuned !!!!!! lol
❤alguém escutando  2025
I was just so surprised I had just seen the face on AGT where he sung and he breath all through his lungs is this the singer...Simon just take in the show!!!his voice lit up stage all the way to the rooftop man...this who they called The Weekend and now he is coming to town together with his best friend Ariane del Grande...what a talent man.
I love them so much
I don't know why I had to run away, so save your tears for anything day,
Before The Weeknd, I was an atheist. Now I truly believe in God : He sings songs to me !
My Song when i walk ❤
❤
❤❤
Amazing performance. Hurry Up Tomorrow
Who''s still listening to this 2025 x
Mad respect for this guy man. He grew on me. Carved his own lane 💪  Can't deny The Weeknd  been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now. 🔥💥
so  nice  to be  a canadian.
3 years later አቤል ተስፋዬ ❤❤❤
Absolutely love this ❤
Good song, let's hear it not ran through Auto-Tune, I am no audio engineer, but this is painfully obvious to the ear.
Epic collaboration. Really, the best music this 48 year old has ever had the privilege of hearing.

Mariana Godoy a Bonotona e o Antonio (posso falar da Cecília Malan?) assistindo "a história sem Fim!" Uma canção...e mais uma trilogia para as aventuras do tico e do Tone (o vô do Aithui) em Donkey Kong Country
Love this so much. Keep coming back.
Mariana Godoy a minha "bonitona" " Uma História sem Fim" (na verdade uma homenagem para os momentos que eu tive com você (mas a poesia no final é para a Angelina , mas são as nossas lembranças Mariana), era para ser uma canção para ser o fundo musical para meo joguinho que eu criei que eu adoro (eu sempre fiz muitos desses jogos eletronicos) o meu Donkey Kong Country
Ana Paula Arosio Giomo, Mariana (principalmente a Mariana) Marina Angelina, Charlize, (principalmente a Mariana) Cecília Malan (com certeza ela) .... Uma Música do "Dias de Trovão" Antonio (com Kelly Macguiles não a Nicole que quer me comer kkk)

Damn my favourite video.
I miss these days:(
WOW i love it❤ me encantó
7 setembro ❤estarei la
LOVE!!!!!
LOVE!!!
i adore this intro
0:32 video 15 of timestamping the weeknd's music video thumbnails. Blinding Lights on Jimmy Kimmel is next!
Eu agradeço a muitas pessoas....   Sabe a Mariana/Marina a Roberta a Ana Paula....muitas pessoas realmente a Fátima Bernardes... O Silvio Santos (talvez mais que todos), pessoas com fama outras não....   Mas de verdade uma arte excelente que eu pude pensar...e que faz sucesso até hoje com responsabilidade aos valores humanos. Depois de Formação na Universidade PUC/USF de Filosofia e Sociologia...muitas pessoas para agradecer...mas ter estudado foi busca minha para expôr uma arte com responsabilidade
Seen live EPIC 😮
Divino Delicious Fantastic Best ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Best in the world
❤AUGUST 2024🎉

Save Your Tears Abel Tesfaye The weeknd
De casula diaboli et deo mortis valde scary！？
This live version needs to be on Spotify! The intro is fire and Abel's vocals are gorgeous!
Absolutely gorgeous imagery 🩷 Jesus bless you, Abel. I pray many who follow you would come to Jesus Christ.
I really enjoyed the choreography.
I don't know why...he's wearing a raincoat.
How he’s amazing and great and best ❤🎉
Don’t normally like this type but he is very talented. Best mainstream music going. I’m didn’t think we would see great artists anymore but he has proved me wrong
What about performn in Indonesia❤❤
Feels like a touch in my heart 😍❤️
Looks like a jelly baby

Love it so much...

I never know when this guy is really singing live, that's ALWAYS PERFECT like in the record!! This is insane!
Is this masterpiece live? Really?
The Weeknd I love you 💙🎶🎧🇧🇷

It's a person with a raincoat like it was decades before too. But it's a square building for him to represent who or how many ones.
That voice... simply perfect !
Epic!!  absolutely EPIC

My favorite performance of this song. The ominous storm in the background is perfection!

Ooh (ooh) Nah-nah, yeah I saw you dancing in a crowded room (uh) You look so happy when I'm not with you But then you saw me, caught you by surprise A single teardrop falling from your eye I don't know why I run away (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) I'll make you cry when I run away (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Save your tears for another day (mm) Met you once under a Pisces moon I kept my distance 'cause I know that you Don't like when I'm with nobody else I couldn't help it, I put you through hell I don't know why I run away (run away, oh, oh, oh, oh) Oh, boy, I'll make you cry when I run away (away, oh, oh, oh, oh) Boy, take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another I realize that it's much too late And you deserve someone better Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) I don't know why I run away (bum, bum, bum, bum, bum) I'll make you cry when I run away (save) Save your tears for another day (ooh) Ooh, girl (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay) I said save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Save your tears for another day
Wasn't this performance done or made shown 🤔 way back 6 nearly 7 years ago now at the live British awards in 2018 2019 I'm pretty sure it was shown then because I remember thinking 🤔 how cool this performance 👏 😎 and ⛈️ 🌧 🌦 🌂 ☔️ 🌩 ⛈️ 🌧 rain coat  😀 with this top rain coat hat too as well or what ever you call it even the weather was pretty cool with the flashing of lightning thunder and so much rain 🌧 😀 pouring down heavily for this video 📹 but this was most definitely shown in 2018 maybe 2019 I can't remember exactly but one of those two years and of course not forgotten the wonderfully magical camera gave circling around spinning turning around here there and every angle possible yes this was something very special indeed made before it's time I thought way back years ago now not this date shown no way no sir 😮 song was pretty good and most enjoyable too as well you know it suited the theam of this performance and the Brits awards 2018 too 2019 maybe you know
Estou com medo 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱

Something about this song gets me … can’t pick what it is … think it might be because it sounds like an 80’s song
❤this
Weeknd is one of the few modern artist who make good music.
❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍
Wow! 😮 What a performance!

Living in the 80's again but in my fifties! ! Great song! Thank you❤
He looks so adorable with his lil hat and jacket 😭💀
Is that a hammer in a beaver and a gaped sphincter at the beginning of the video, or is it a face?
Hit me!!! Yo❤❤❤
Estoy casi seguro que eso es ropa de un diseñador
La puesta en escena de esta canción en esta presentación, el es simplemente diferente, le gusta hacer las cosas de una manera diferente

J'adore cette chanson mais....le rapport entre le clip et la chanson?
I love you abel
When the time that Abel forgives the Grammys and let his work be nominated, I feel that he will put out a banger album that will conquer EVERY category: Best Artist, Album of the Year, Best Pop, Best Hip Hop, Best Collab, Best R&B, Best Music Video,..hell he's so talented he can drop a country song and a gospel song, and he'd still win an award for it. 😅
Buena versio tipo Michael el rey de poop
A great song. Pity he plays air key board and guitar in various videos.
¡CAPO!
Thanks for this song. I'm so fucking sad that I needed.....

1 year . Still ⭐️🎶❤️
That first 28 seconds is absolutely brilliant. What an intro! I love this song even more just for that start!
Best version by far…
I'm a metal fan but I found this performance to be incredible. The artistry and mood around the song is brilliant and I regularly come back to this as a great example of a perfect pop song.
This is fantastic music
😟😞😢💔
Legend

Incredible, incredible waoo💃💃💃💃💃
He's so talented. Love his songs.  From Vietnam ❤️
Saddest song ever. Always makes me cry coz that's what I last heard when i lost my love who broke with me
I don’t know if anyone here is aware of what post punk is but this feels like a postpunk song the kind of darkness a postpunk song gives off kind of feels kind of post punk/dark wave this gives me Goth vibes if anyone is aware of what darkwave is or post punk can I hear your opinions on this
I love you

Hermosa presentación! ! ÉXITOS POR SIEMPRE Abel😄
Kudos to the brits for acknowledging his talent
🎶🎧
❤
For any of y’all wondering, the guy playing synth in the corner is Daniel Lopatin, aka Oneohtrix Point Never. He was the co-executive producer on Dawn FM, plus has done some remixes (save your tears and Dawn FM are the two I think). He also was music director for Abel’s halftime show a couple years back. Not only that, he’s an incredible musician in his own right. Arguably a GOAT of experimental electronic music, inventor of vaporwave, did the soundtrack for Uncut Gems (where he and Abel met actually), and a quickly rising star of a producer. Abel was co-executive producer on his most recent album, plus provided the vocals for No Nightmares, which is an incredible song.

This performance gave me straight chills, the Weeknd summed up in one word: Mesmerizing
ผมชอบคุณ คุณร้องเพลงเพราะมาก
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Any idea where this was recorded or how. I assume it’s in a studio or shot outdoors and lightening added with cgi.
💚 사랑해
i think the weeknd is the best live solo performer
Essa musica é maravilhosa.
Обожаю их творчество супер

This clip reminds me of Big Trouble in little China. Really!... the one with the lightning...
Beautiful video, angel voice. Such a stylish and perfectly harmonised video too. Well done to the music video director and post production team. Such a great job too. I wish this was the official video. I like it better than the original

I don't understand how this is "live" at the Brit Awards...he's not on a live stage, it's obviously a set with cgi and green screens and whatnot...wut
You are amazing!!
Funny how this rivals the studio version.

Te amo fim de semana
Abel,meu amor❤
Save You Tears está canción la escucho cuando me siento sola y triste, en estos momentos estoy viviendo algo a lo que temía con todo mi ser que llegara la muerte de mi madre hoy estoy aquí después de varios días en el hospital en los cuales le detectaron cáncer y aunque años atrás para ser exactos 11 años tuvo cáncer de mama esta vez es otro tipo de cáncer y por momentos siento que esto es un sueño que ella está bien que no tiene nada pero vuelvo a mi realidad cuando la veo con esos síntomas horribles me duele verla así y está canción llena ese hueco que siento. Les digo a quien se tomó un momento para leerme que se cuiden mucho coman sano y hagan ejercicio, y sobre todo todo lo que sientan jamás lo repriman digan lo que sientan amen al máximo sean felices xq solo existe el ahora! 🙏
You are a young man that I admire because you do not have an idea, I am glad to know that you managed to get where you deserve never let them hurt you, much less feel less next to absolutely nobody. You are a boy who is worth gold and not because of fame and money but because of that great talent that your voice possesses, your way of being. May God always bless you Abel ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Ele arrasa demais
Much love from Arabic Fans ❤️
Simply the best

🤩🤩🤩👊🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😎✌🏼
I saw Abel in 2013 in CA. I escorted my Younger cousin who was one of THE MOST DIE HARD FANS I have seen of his until even this day. She had amazing taste. Now before I saw him person, I knew he was awesome. But OMG his small concert at a club just BLEW MY SEIZURE-IOUS mind (without the seizure) and I realized She had Amazing taste! I miss you Breigh! If you see this- please don’t believe the BS. I love the crap Outta you and I’m the same AB that I Was when we first got close! That trip was literally the best “hot mess” we have endured together! Thank you for opening my eyes! And you clearly knew what you were talking about considering TW blew up shortly after!  EDIT: I believe it was Toronto CA. Not to be confused with California (CA) in the states ;)
How is EVERY Live performance so high quality?! *Genuinely, I feel like every Live performance could be the "Music video" for the song*
Great singer
Who's the other guy?

I found hillarious that not a single comment is about the keybordist, which did a great job keeping up with Abel!
Looking back I think this is the place where old Abel crashes his car in Gasoline.
Evey song 🎧 goes under my skin

It is sad COVID-19 stop the live shows but he still had the best Performance NFL halftime
Jamiroquai - Virtual Insanity? Ehehehe...
Ese beat 😎😎
This is will always be his "Signature Song"!!! Truly mesmerizing..
It's only for a couple split seconds at a time in this, but I love when the weeknd actually puts his real vocal ability on display.  Maybe he doesn't want to blow out his pipes or something, but it's a thing of beauty when he really let's himself go.  just my 2 cents.
Me olvido de todo cuando lo escucho 😍🤩
He reminds me so much of Michael Jackson bruh…
So the weekend was the last year that I had a lot to be excited for and it wasn't the only one that the team would be a little bit better at that time in their game to get to be the first to win a championship in their last 5❤
Fyi this isn't an option 7AM has been used to be the company for a while and it has a very high profile of android phones that have been in place since I got to be a fan and I am a little disappointed that the iPhone is not the best of

его треки самые лучшие, вообще я начала его слушать после песни Blinding Lights. Мне эта песня очень понравилась, и я начала слушать другие его песни, оказывается все его треки такие кайфовые, я теперь настоящая фанатка🖤💫
Simplismente sensacional
Despite what the song says, I ain't able to save my tears while I'm listening to it
Amo mucho a este man. <3
Masterpiece
Wow, this video reminds me of a video game called " Little Nightmares".....awesome
Idk why but I can actually relate to most of these lyrics
I Said, Save your tears for Another daaaaay! Ooh Girl🎶❤
temazo ~
thanks...brother
The weeknd is still one of the best talented Artists out there today making good music like this.& that save your tears is literally So awesome because it really has a beautiful vibe to it.& that It became a top hit song everywhere because of the Weeknd's great vocals on it. & that Save your Tears is a mindblowing Song that deserves so much credit for being the best pop song out there.& The Weeknd should be respected for it.  Plus The Lyrics is so incredible.i find his songs very good.
Questa canzone rimarrà sempre nel mio fottuto cuore 🖤
Needed this after his new release, with a heavy heart i have to say The Dawn is trash

Perfect like Michael J
Before the pandemic, when I still commuted to work, this song was often played on the radio (I am in Toronto, so of course, we love The Weeknd here).....I have to say this song made my lonely commutes much more happy....it puts me in a relaxed and dreamlike state, which is a testament to The Weeknd's incredible, sensual voice (and this was the radio edit by the way...don't even get me started on the real lyrics)... LOVE IT!!!
The Shivrem x The Weeknd 🙏🙏🙏
TA.... TA... TA.. TA..TANNN
This just makes me wanna run away during a huge storm lmao
can we talk bout the fit😭
дождь капает прямолинейно! вооот
If he performed this song during a real thunder and lightening storm....well....just beautiful. Visually beautiful.
I never would have predicted a Weeknd/Oneohtrix Point Never collab. So weird.
The weeknd has the 80's vibe music no wonder why we love his songs.
Other artist performing live : expensive, cringe outfits.  Weeknd: Raincoat.
I love the bee gees :)
You are so talented, appreciate your creativity and individually well done on your success can't wait to see what's next X
Essa música transporta qualquer um para uma paz...
love from vietnam, the weekend is best forever

The thunder at the beginning that sounds familiar on Roblox
🤍
Does he do any live appearances ?? I can’t find a single video in front of an audience
Que grato es escuchar tan maravillosa canción y una voz muy cautivadora y llena de sentimientos y emociones....felicidades 💖💝 Soy ochentera de corazón, pero este cantante es fenomenal.. !!!!!!!

I know what you did last summer

Ele e o vídeo me deixaram com uma vibe tão Jamiroquai. Adorei 😌
his absolutely 💯 ❤ 😍
I saw you dancing in a crowded room You look so happy when I'm not with you But then you saw me, caught you by surprise A single teardrop falling from your eye  I don't know why I run away I'll make you cry when I run away  You could've asked me why I broke your heart You could've told me that you fell apart But you walked past me like I wasn't there And just pretended like you didn't care  I don't know why I run away I'll make you cry when I run away  Take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another Save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day  So, I made you think that I would always stay I said some things that I should never say Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine And now you won't love me for a second time  I don't know why I run away, oh, girl Said I'll make you cry when I run away  Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another I realize that I'm much too late And you deserve someone better Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah) Save your tears for another day (yeah)  I don't know why I run away I'll make you cry when I run away  Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (ah) I said save your tears for another day (ah)  Save your tears for another day (ah) Save your tears for another day (ah)
This song is perfection. Sounds great live with the set up.
Nice post-Covid world you've created
I am speechless 😶  Hugs and Kisses from Ukraine 🇺🇦

One of the artist I want to see in concert I wish that I can see him .. angelic voice
That hoddie or whatever this is, where can I get this to wear, what is it even called?
Who got the tears in the rain reference during this performance... it's pointless, like tears in the rain..... xo
Que pasada de canción, enhorabuena suena bien en todas las versiones
Such a great Legend, Have God soul, Who make you cry in Happiness through his great music.

Minha música diária de todos os dias.

SUPER LOVE THIS SONG... MAKING THIS MY LSS... LOVE THE WEEKEND

Just another master peace from the Weekend
Hail to the pleiadians!

Will be seeing him in January.
With each song I like him more and more x
Genius
I really wish to see him in person 😭
This guy is amazing. His voice is a true gift. I don't think he could do any wrong. Canadian too👏👏
It sounds so good!I'm so addicted to this song!👏
not a pro singer but as i can imagine this is probably the most difficult song to sing live lol
Uzasny,talentovany,zboznujem Ta 🙂❤🥰
This guys Nickname should be the "Best" because he is that freaking good.
Dying to go toilet..
Intro 😍😍😍😍😍
It gives me chills every-time i listen to it 😄
XOXOXOXO
02:35
You're a Legend
From he screen grab I thought it was Jamiroquai, then omg what if he n The Weeknd collaborated OMG.🤯
With his fingers he's telling everyone, "This is synth pop!"
Música linda amoooo, sua voz maravilhosa. 😍❤️😘
L O V  E  !  Remind me the eighties as this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bfnyT-nTrw
Cool concept video!!   He’s a true vocalist with excellent performance
Cute
No words for that music... everytime u here it, u cant sit still ;-)
Glad Dasha's boyfriend is staying booked
Michael Jackson lives through this man.
I like his outfit,could wear it when it is raining while rocking this song.
THHHEEEEE WEEEEEEEKKKKKNND
😍😍😍😍😍
02:35
So cute  your voice Abel
He is really repping UK in this ...the valentino coat, rain, style 👌 😍😍
This song s like honey  Sweet as me sticky
My hope is that this young man finds his real soulmate in this life. And not all the phoney one's in Hollywood. Hes wasting his time, talent and ability to love on anyone else.
Keep up the good work  Your new songs are amazing
Tout simplement sublime ! quel talent the Weeknd !
♥️♥️♥️
since I met this song I have not stopped listening to it. ✨
so...how is this live though? it looks like a regular music video. where are the crowds and all the cheering?
our generatins maichel jackson!! /jessi
😍😍😍
Why do I think of jamiroquai 😅
Man this song enough to give you shivers down the spine!!
Why do I feel your singing to me.... don't we all dream xoxox
silly outfit, good song, end of
So there is hope for music after all.
Yeah…. I think I’m in love.
They remind me of a Ebony and Ivory version of "Naked Eyes" 🤟😊🤟
In my opinion, The Weeknd was looking and sounding at his best during this BRIT Awards 2021. I can close my eyes  listening to this 80's revival mv many times over and over.
Solo suena bien, pero con Ariana Grande, suena perfecto 💗ni
y love big song the weeknd § BIG UP !
YESSSSSS
I love this song 🎵 ❤
I thought that Post Malone is the dj when first time watch this hahah
All the dislikes were from people who couldn't save their tears
Love him!!  This song is so beautiful!  I listen to it a few times a day!  ♥️
my sweet duster
💥👌
Rod Stewart estaría orgulloso de que se haya inspirado en su canción.
I saw you dancing in a crowded room Je t'ai vue danser dans un salle bondée You look so happy when I'm not with you Tu as l'air si heureuse quand je ne suis pas avec toi But then you saw me, caught you by surprise Mais ensuite tu m'as vu, ça t'a surprise A single teardrop falling from your eye Juste une larme glissant de ton œil   I don't know why I run away Je ne sais pas pourquoi je m'enfuis I'll make you cry when I run away Je te ferai pleurer quand je partirai  You could've asked me why I broke your heart Tu aurais pu me demander pourquoi j'ai brisé ton cœur You could've told me that you fell apart Tu aurais pu me dire que tu t'étais effondrée But you walked past me like I wasn't there Mais tu es passée devant moi comme si je n'étais pas là And just pretended like you didn't care Et tu as juste fait comme si tu t'en fichais  I don't know why I run away Je ne sais pas pourquoi je m'enfuis I'll make you cry when I run away Je te ferai pleurer quand je partirai  (Chorus:) Take me back 'cause I wanna stay Ramène-moi en arrière, parce que je veux rester Save your tears for another Réserve tes larmes pour un autre Save your tears for another day Réserve tes larmes pour un autre jour Save your tears for another day Garde tes larmes pour un autre jour  So, I made you think that I would always stay Ainsi, je t'ai fait croire que je resterais toujours I said some things that I should never say J'ai dit des trucs que je n'aurais jamais dû dire Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine Ouais, j'ai brisé ton cœur comme quelqu'un d'autre a brisé le mien And now you won't love me for a second time Et maintenant tu ne m'aimeras pas une seconde fois  I don't know why I run away, oh, girl Je ne sais pas pourquoi je m'enfuis, oh ma belle Said I'll make you cry when I run away J'ai dit que je te ferai pleurer quand je partirai  (Chorus:) Take me back 'cause I wanna stay Ramène-moi en arrière, parce que je veux rester Save your tears for another Réserve tes larmes pour un autre I realize that I'm much too late Je réalise que j'arrive bien trop tard And you deserve someone better Et que tu mérites quelqu'un de mieux Save your tears for another day (Ooh, yeah) Garde tes larmes pour un autre jour Save your tears for another day (Yeah) Garde tes larmes pour un autre jour  I don't know why I run away Je ne sais pas pourquoi je m'enfuis I'll make you cry when I run away Je te ferai pleurer quand je partirai  (Chorus:) Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (Ah) Réserve tes larmes pour un autre jour, ooh ma belle I said save your tears for another day (Ah) J'ai dit réserve tes larmes pour un autre jour  Save your tears for another day (Ah) Réserve tes larmes pour un autre jour Save your tears for another day (Ah)  Garde tes larmes pour un autre jour
Amo😉
Como que não se apaixona por um homi desse?
Que buen video
boring singing but great voice
Wow....toll.....die Location ist der Hammer....
♥️
pure talent!
'The Weeknd' sings from a broken heart. I can relate always said., don't ever let anyone steal your joy. True friends first than lover's! It's all about boundaries and respect in any relationship.
Узбеки вы тут?
x...
Cuando escuchas todas las versiones del tema :D
You're gonna cry the tears anyways. You're gonna feel the pain anyways. You might as well grow.  Don't be emotionally constipated. Focusing on a really big goal. A way to fix society. Break it up in sections. Heal the way  Jesus fed the 5000. Break it up in sections and heal with  a trusted team. Embrace your  masochistic tendencies and relish in the controlled burns of healthy growing pains. Like healing, like growing like lifting weights, You don't wanna take on too much or else you might break. Tolerance (to the right thing) is like, a healthy version of nose blind. It's a good thing to get acclimated and acquainted too. "Too much  of anything isn't good for you" but you already know that my dude. Thats Thats The Weeknd and Belly Belle's Old News. XO is how we grow. You know.
Ahhh heavy rains, cool my brain.  And do you know how hard it is  to find a good rain coat. Believe  me I've tried.
Break Trident. The Weeknd XO is How we Grow.
A TRUE   MASTER.     WE ARE WITNESSING     A   GIFTED   SUPERSTAR      OF   UNPRECEDENTED,   PROPORTION.     Been Listening  to you, Sir,  since you were HIGH SCHOOL.       CALLED   IT.       HERE  YOU ARE.     /   RED_SUPERVIXEN_    VANCOUVER   BC    🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦💖💜🧡💛💖💜🧡💛💖💜🧡💛💖💜🧡💛🕶
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT....MERCI WEEKND !!!

Hey I watched the "Official"video to this song. And .near the end the man is holding a gun behind his back, then the woman has it in her hands pointed at the front if his head. Say what?? Is that kind of cheap shot violence really needed? I think we all need love and kindness and beauty with a song like this. But this video here is nice.
His genius hits different.... 🇪🇹❤
Best 😍😎
This video reminds me of the music video Virtual Insanity by Jamiroquai. 😃
Epic
he`s outfit fits the brit weather
It literally is "Think outside of the box."
Aún hay buena música Gracias dios mio!!!!
Mushroom
why is he dressed like a witch. abel the teenage witch
Who else here thinks this song deserves an official music video? Authentic Views
Me encanta esta canción October 6.
Only good things in my head and 💓 when I can hear you Weeknd. In my f... life.
love it!!!!!
Hace 40 años no hemos sentido tanto furor y ganas de oír a cada instante tan hermosa música...pensé que se había acabado la inspiración y creatividad...pero no..aun hay mucha música por escuchar.  gracias.
Better than the official video ❤️❤️🔥🔥love from India🇮🇳

Abel keep doing what you're cause it's working 😭
ты можешь проснуться завтра в том месте где захочешь, просто пойми - работа и занятость будет у тебя всегда, а время уходит...медленно

I like that he doesn't over-process the vocals
Talented!
Hi Abel Today is my birthday

I’m so glad reincarnation exists. This man has reincarnated 80s music.

Why The weeknd doesn’t give love like to anyone? :(
😶😍
@Theweekend no thank you sir, you’ve helped me through my tough times 🙏
Came here for Abe, stayed for the melodic synth. Holy crap it's even better than the studio version.
Keep knocking out the hits that's all I want to hear
I like your music keep knocking out the hits you will be rewarded more than you'll ever know
Awesome song
Hola Abel increible musica numero uno bravoooo 😘😘👍👍👍🙏
Iconic
Loving his music,,,, he’s bringing back the way the “80’s” music sounded,
Majestic 💫
Мы все любим тебя! Спасибо, что ты есть. Храни тебя Господь!
Ur great at singing and performance that's like d perfect duo
How does he sound better live than recorded? That's a true vocalist. One of the only people I wish to see in concert.
Absolutely brilliant voice combined with a lyrical masterpiece
Love ❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am from Egypt. I love your voice .. wish you success and I hope to see you Next to the pyramids sing

Dude...his voice is amazing!
one of the most beautiful and sexy songs I've ever heard! Thnak you TW!
제주 탑동골목 2021년 9월 11일 오후 9:58 손님 신청곡      현재 탑동골목에서 손님이 신청한 노래입니다:)
Good song. all the best.
Abel... que gran tema
Michael..?
Max Martin is god
Definitivamente uno de los pocos cantantes que no depende del autotune para cantar como una verdadera estrella
Mariana.  Para não perder a sua amizade...se lembra um dia de Michael Jackson?    Você ainda assiste "História sem Fim"?   Te Amo 😘
Wow that sounds awesome 🤩🤩😘🤩🤩😘😘
Your mine abel
Love how side lights follow the drum fills. Weeknd could go solo just with his voice. The track is an awesome 80s flashback.
I have never been attracted 2 black men and I haven't been attracted to anyone in a long time, five years, that's me and my husband split so it would end up that Abel, a superstar, is the first one! So talented, seems so sweet and so handsome
Como canta bem,dá gosto de ouvir.
Song reminds on the music from movie "drive". love it
Love it!  I always wait for the playing the piano actions 🤭😁🎶😍👌
The Weeknd - Save your Tears - Lyrics.  https://youtu.be/qNbFlcIBYO4

Fantasmagoriese liedjie - by buurman eerste keer gehoor - luister gereeld !!
This song is good for two theme : Wedding Day and a Funeral
oh god i will forever love the live performances of this song
Hi
Por fin algo audible, y no la basura del reguetón 😖😖😖
you shall not pass
Little nightmares anyone?
my mind literally through the whole video: MAN SO FUCKING INSANE
It's funny listening to this song now and being like, where's Ariana? lol
He has somthing enchanting ,a touch of michael jackson and a little bit of freddy mercury, some bluess  some jazz some 80's n Retro and all homogenized perfectly in to a modern time
bro his swag is dope
🖤🖤🖤🎶
Mucho ya con esta música:v
Please please come to my birthday you just have to come to Pensacola please I love you so much and I love you I love all of you song can you just come to Pensacola on my birthday please we can we can go the weekend 😍😍😍😍

Am struggling with to seeing how that story has anything to do with the core message of the song?
M.Jackson 2!!!!Super Star 2!!!
Este hombre no necesita un grammy.. 🤣🤣
❤️love❤️love❤️
The Weeknd looks like a Handsome Witch!
Thank you brit awards what the Grammy's didn't recognize
With Arianna G sounds great
Great Weeknd
a lui je l'adore
when The Weeknd shouts "hey or I say" classic!
gonna tell you one thing. this man's voice is extraordinary, no autotune needed
This guy definitely knows what you did last summer!! 😂😂😂😂😂 I wonder how many people will get that joke 🤔
LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH
If Undertaker was born as a singer... #ABELTAKER#
Congrotulation,.!!!
I love the reference to the I Know What You Did Last Summer killer.
makes you want to live and listen to great music !!!!
new skin unlocked : the weeknd rainny days
Great Performance!
Ты мой любимыи
great song forever
Que tal cantar pra mim uma música Brasileira. ...
One of the most underrated artists in the game the man kills every live show he dose 💯
How the hell they did that rain thingy purposely on time for his act during the song. Wiw. That's a lot of weather forecast. UP! for The Weekend 🥂
this song makes me wanna drive safe in gta
Awesome!
Maravillosa voz angelical ! Desde 🇲🇽con amor para el mundo 💖
I love it
Well done handsome👍👆
Deine Musik ist klasse  Die Videos sind richtig scheisse
This song has a special place in my heart. I was born and brought up in a Catholic family in Texas and my boyfriend was born and brought up in a strict Hindu family back in India. He moved to the states for college. We met in class and instantly fell for each other. The difference in our races created many obstacles for us. Even our parents stood between us because of the religious differences. But we stuck to it and fought all those battles together and today we are the happiest of couples.I hope we get to live with each other forever. ❤️🇺🇸🇮🇳❤️❤️❤️
Who are you ?  is this your message?  the storm is coming!
This song is amazing...
Love it🎵😍😘🤩🤩🤩
So viel Liebe und so viel Respekt für dich.
So much love and so much respect for you.
I like it
I love his voice
Najbolja verzija pesme, volim da je slusam🎶🌠
Música top amooo
Enjoyed this song many times
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🌟💫💫💫💫💫💫💫🌟💫🌟
It's that vibration that ruins this song when live..especially on the word "why". It's more tragic when the vibration isn't there..as it feels more painful.
Love the 80's vibe! OMG! Love it
A good Newfoundland fog horn added to part of this would make it priceless
I'm just 8 months, behind every hits.
I forgot that this is live for a moment... Hahaha... Wow...
Muito top essa musica
Brasil, agosto 2021
I love the intro of this version of syt, by opn

I love this song, fabulous
Reincarnation of the mysteriously beautiful synthpop music at its finest.  What can I say? Alwaaaays, I wanna be with you… :)
Unbelievable Talented
Estoy suscrito y, active los avisos de tu canal. Saludos The Weeknd.
Felicidades por tu voz, es magnifica, asi como tus canciones. Estas marcando tu propia historia musical. Soy ochentero y, mis dos principales cantantes son la gran Madonna y, el gran Michael Jackson (qepd).  Ahora  estoy siguiendo tus canciones, muy bonitas. Saludos desde Cancún, México.
cute rain suit...
At 0:49 he’s gesturing the keys on the keyboard for the riff.
He looks like ratcatcher 2 lol
This will be one of those songs i want to hear when im 80 years old sitting in my living room and it comes on the speaker or whatever futuristic music device we will have in the future !!! See you all in 50 years
Perfect 😍
The sound of thunder,cloud and rain makes it more nostalgic
💖💖💖💖
Wow the best💕
Ma chanson préférée
❤️✨🌟🕴️
this version is so brit
Why his Live songs are like another official version?
My boy is in his twenties and loves him, and I always say the best music was in the 60's to the 90's like MarvinGaye, Stevie Wonder, Michael J ,Al Green, all Tamla , Otis Redding, Luther Vandross etc, I still think that BUT this guy is great, love his voice and songs, cant stop singing or humming them, he is fantastic, asked to go to a concert with him to see The Weekend  but I have a feeling he wont be seen with his ol man at one, I am in my sixties and it would destroy his Street Cred, Keep well all  lots of love  from London
Omg this song is like...💖💞😍💓💓💜💛💚
For everyone out there : You may be having difficult situations in your life, just remember that those situations are a chance for you to grow. A chance for you to become stronger! It is okay to feel insecure but don't think that there is no cure.  The cure has always been in you. You've got to dig deeper and deeper to find the truth. Stop listening to you mind.  Those thoughts are only lies and were made to hurt you. The past is gone, the future is unknown so live in the now to make it through
❤❤❤
I'll prob get hate for this but I don't care... His dancing/moves always look so dorky but in such a cute and sexy way!!
Not a red hat but I immediately thought of the Paddington Bear ^^
because he is so beautiful huh🤧
My 18 year old 10 year old and 12 year old listen to music alot and I have to say this man is an amazing artist definitely a raw and real legend look forward to hearing and seeing more from this amazing human .may God continue to pour blessing on his life
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SONG!!!
Desde a época do Erasure não surgia música eletrônica tão divertida e intensa. Great Song!!!
Best version of this song ever displayed
It’s very 80s. That’s why I LOOOOOVE IT!!!!
This guy's production reinvented the way to create clips. <3
I wanna his hat 👍
Weeknd I ADORE YOUR VOCALS CONTINUE TO CREATE YOUR BRAVE OF ART HISTORY LET'S GO GREATE MUSIC HISTORY WELL DONE

Your voice has a very high recognition value.
Deine Stimme hat einen sehr hohen Wiedererkennungswert.
I MEGA love this song. I heard it 3 days ago and paid attention to the lyrics and fell in love with it. I’m going thru a breakup and it’s just surreal…. I love your music The Weeknd!!! The beat is awesome!!

LYRICS  [Verse 1] I saw you dancing in a crowded room You look so happy when I'm not with you But then you saw me, caught you by surprise A single teardrop falling from your eye  [Refrain] I don't know why I run away I make you cry when I run away  [Verse 2] You could've asked me why I broke your heart You could've told me that you fell apart But you walked past me like I wasn't there And just pretended like you didn't care  [Refrain] I don't know why I run away I make you cry when I run away  [Pre-Chorus] Take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another  [Chorus] Save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day  [Verse 3] I made you think that I would always stay I said some things that I should never say Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine And now you won't love me for a second time  [Refrain] I don't know why I run away, ooh babe I make you cry when I run away  [Pre-Chorus] Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another I realize that I'm much too late And you deserve someone better  [Chorus] Save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day  [Refrain] I don't know why I run away I'll make you cry when I run away  [Chorus] I said! Save your tears for another day Ooh, girl, I said  Save your tears for another day (Hey! Let's go!)  [Outro] Save your tears for another day  I said! Save your tears for another day (Hey!)  ---

Wow . Just WOW 👍❤
Daiane....esse toque...o meu coração.. está nu.   E essa canção...pela Paz.  Sei lá...eu sei..olhe estilo........
Как же The Weeknd в живую поет шикарно!!!!!
Mariana (assistindo seu filme favorito?"História sem Fim")(porquê "eu sou a Lenda"!)   ...eu gosto dessas pausas de três pontinhos...    Te Amo...mas essa poesia eu fiz para a Angelina. ...    Porque e meus amigos e eu tocamos.. Mas cantávamos eu sei que era também com você.  ...    Essas pausas te ver feliz, te ver rindo...me enche os Olhos de lágrimas....  ...    É só uma poesia outra vêz.
Mariana?  Eu gosto dessa pausa...eu sempre gosto...(três pontinhos. Uma pausa....)    As minhas poesias que fiz para você Angelina...as músicas que eu fiz para vocês...  Outro disco para outro dia.. Vamos aproveitar a chuva.. cair em nossos rostos e aproveitar porque a vida é linda... Eu tentei correr...de vocês...mas é algo mágico dentro de vocês.     Mais um disco de ouro?
É só colocar uma pancada boa. Que eu faço uma canção boa para você... Vai virar sucesso....,.. Disco e outro dia. Não parece aquelas poesias que eu fazia para você Mariana...que eu te contava para outro escrever? Não eu fiz para o meu Anjo.    Deus abençoe e salve os discos (som Analógico!) E mais um outro dia 🌹 (Mariana e Antônio)!
For someone reading this, you are in the season wrestling with God, the season where Jacob becomes Israel,  where you are not SELF MADE but GOD MADE, and though it has been hard, you know He is good,  and you know that the life you have lived is not the life you were made for, but you are called to full submission to the will and call of God on your life.  Don’t be discouraged, this hard season is the very thing that has driven you to this crossroads where you accept that you were never made to “fit into this world,” but you were made to partner with God to share Christ with this world.  You aren’t alone, a lot of us are right there with you, God is fashioning us to be a generation that calls in the lost before the return of Christ, The God of ISRAEL 🙏🏻❤️

Incredible best song I've heard in years can't stop listening to it.
Hi Abel...hoy conocí algo de tu historia... De lo que eres... Todos somos y hemos sido víctimas de las circunstancias en algún momento de la vida...  Tu brillo no lo apaga la oscuridad que te ha rodeado... Y puedo verlo... Eres un maravilloso talento...una voz espectacular y un ser humano demasiado valiente para hablar de tus demonios sin miedo ante el mundo que casi siempre solo juzga sin comprender... Tu hermosa voz contrasta con tus letras tan desgarradoras... Belleza agridulce por tu dolor...Con tu fuerza interior, tu amor propio y por el valioso ser humano que eres, saldrás victorioso de tus luchas! Asi será Desde Colombia con admiración total!! Un abrazo
Ok I thought the one with the cars was my fave or maybeeee even the Ariana one but man he says "Heyyy!" too many times for this to not be my fave... Leshhh Gooo... HEY!

Did he do plastic surgery or was that bs ??
I wonder why people are going out of their way to keep disliknig the new uploads of the same song. If they hate it that much, why are they clicking on it? Its super weird if you think about it.
Nek had a similar song (Cuore in tempesta)
They just get better and better
This one reminds me of another one, but I can't remember which one..Great song.
Ich danke dir, für diese schöne Songs

collab ZAYN X The Weeknd 🛐🛐
Epic version... better and better again👍👍👍
He’s so handsome I wish he’d not cover himself up so much or wear crazy prosthetics.  He doesn’t need a gimmick.  He’s genuinely talented.  It’s a distraction. His voice is so beautiful.
His voice can only be described as Angel's singing in heaven !! I honestly don't think there would ever be a bad sound that could come from this man !! The smoothness of his voice is just as good if not better when he's live than any auto tuning. I could listen to his voice all day and never get tired of hearing him !! 😍🤩😘😛
اعشق الاغنيه
احبههه
تكفونن لو العالم يتعلم من ذاويكند 😭
احتفضي بدموعك
Yes one of the very BEST songs ever made. Brilliant song.
**SÚPER... PERFORMANCE!!!**
You are The legend . No one can replace you man… there is something special in your voice. Blinding lights and save your tears when ever i am listening i felt so special and my goose bumps activate somehow. God bless you
*PERFECT*
I always waiting 4 your live perfoemance, very great song, never get bored😊 Luv the scene...

Ja das ist ganz toll das er seine operierte Fresse versteckt !
👂🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God can raise children to Abraham from these stones. Flee eternal hell, cry out to God to save you, because Jesus Christ died and is now risen at the right hand of God and he makes intercession. Only in him, my Lord Jesus Christ is salvation found.  Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼. Jesus Christ is God in the flesh. Came to destroy the works of the devil.  Plea and call  to God to save you from your sins. Please plea with him. He saved me from all my sins and forgave me. I have eternal life only because he died and now is risen at the right hand of God and he ever lives to make intercession for us.🥰🙏
So Better... so vintage.
Im so in love❤️
To evil and cryptic for me. Why is he wearing a rain coat to symbolize "the flood"? 🤔
🫀
He is God
Love this song
The 4k dislikes were from the ppl who got shocked by lightning
I cried the rhythm is sad and sweet
Tell me if you have  seen something like his blinding lights performance in my MTV VMAs last year and people are still saying Justin Bieber performs better live 😂😂. Tell me better joke guys ...Weeknd is the peak of creativity and entertainment .
let it rain rain and raint at hapines  again on top
Best Song pop 2021 😍💖🌷
People don’t realise that by just having a talented musician being himself in a room with a guy on synth is enough! No nudity, sexual acts, porn, just pure talent can we go back to this?
Never needs a Grammy he's what Grammy needs.

Will he catch a cold after this performance?

I know what you did last summer.. so save your tears 😢
Amazing song!!!!
i liked it before it even started
Na-na, yeah  I saw you dancing in a crowded room You look so happy when I'm not with you But then you saw me, caught you by surprise A single teardrop falling from your eye  I don't know why I run away I'll make you cry when I run away  You could've asked me why I broke your heart You could've told me that you fell apart But you walked past me like I wasn't there And just pretended like you didn't care  I don't know why I run away I'll make you cry when I run away  Take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another Save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day  So, I made you think that I would always stay I said some things that I should never say Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine And now you won't love me for a second time  I don't know why I run away, oh, girl Said I'll make you cry when I run away  Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another I realize that I'm much too late And you deserve someone better Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah) Save your tears for another day (yeah)  I don't know why I run away I'll make you cry when I run away  Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (ah) I said save your tears for another day (ah)  Save your tears for another day (ah) Save your tears for another day (ah)

He has one of the bst voices of our generation
Adoro
80s vibe
Sweet music
The way he do his every live performance in a unique way, is just amazing.
Both remix and solo versions slaps. What a talented artist
bhag yha se
i love u abel, u don't know how i love u, lol
Love this song and the music...... From India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
For me, that song is already up there with "Billie Jean/ Beat It" from Michael Jackson as one of the greatest hit of all time. Imagine if that song was sung by MJ in the 80s, MJ would have been even bigger than he probably was! Probably bigger than Billie Jean/ Beat It  But credit to The Weeknd for coming out with this hit! It's going to be timeless and he'll be the icon of his own.
From VietNam with love 😍
Essa música é um ícone 🎶
I love how u change it up each time...mind blowing to see u performing now I can't wait to see u in concert in February been waiting 2years for u able
😍😍😍😍😍😎
Woooowww the lyrics touching me 😭
Trust the Gortans fishermen  lol

Honestly, when I first saw this, I thought it was an Eminem vid, I kept thinking, when did he start to sing so smoothly.

2020 will be known as the year of The Weeknd. And oh there was a pandemic outbreak too
Does he know how good he is ?

master class pure in simple weeknd
if it is an artist worthy of following/continuing (partially) on MJ footsteps that is Abel ! Looking forward to his future work !
The uptight sand cytogenetically slow because valley rarely apologise but a longing gazelle. upbeat, giant banjo
Brasil
The squalid nut lastly frame because foundation classically strap in a needless bow. efficacious, understood bat
This is fucking amazing! 🔥🔥
Alhamdulillah, ukhti Abel akhirnya menutup aurat wkwkwk
LOVE HIS MAGICAL VOICE 😱😱😱😱😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤
That intro tho😰❤🙌🏼
Can you imagine a world without music? How would you feel about it? What would you miss the most?  Te imaginas un mundo sin música? Como te sentirias? Que seria lo que mas extrañarias?
Thanks to all musicians for making life better! I know from my own experience that life can get tough, but if you listen to good songs you can get through it and keep going. Made some playlists for many moments in life. Come listen to them and leave me your opinion. I'm getting started. Thanks!
You're Awesome Bro 👍😎🤜🤛😎👍
My mind is blown rn. This is the first time he hasn’t worn his red jacket since before this era. He posted « before the dawn comes » on his insta wearing this fit. This was filmed at night and we can all understand the dawn comes after the night. He really puts so much detail and foreshadowing in everything he does, it’s amazing. I’m so excited to see him on tour in March ❌⭕️
Damn he’s been performing this album for ages now. I guess shows the strength of the after hours record.

Love you Abel. Your music has healed me so much from opiate addiction and picked me up in the lowest points of my life.

Glad I made it through what I did. But insanely grateful for your music especially after hours. Keep shinning star, may god continue to bless you and keep you healthy and happy. I will be at your concert in Philly in 2022 I cant waaaaaaait. Long sleeve gang for life XO

Yes legend
The look is Maybe a teaser for the new album?
Clearly the best musician of this generation.....miles apart. Already a legend!
The dawn.
Brilliant song
I find it really hard to believe that most artists sound like the sound studio recording when live when they are moving around and running around the stage and they don't skip a beat at all. Plus when they have the microphone in front of their mouth to prevent everyone from seeing them lip sync.
Your are legendary man you are the best I love you
Yes
Mo basta !!
The Weeknd?? Naw, Abel is The Truth!!
I am loving this song!!!!!
thank you XO

HANDSOME SQUIDWARD
❌️⭕️
The truth is that no one can sing this song like him. All the covers on YouTube are not even close to his.
This should've been the video. ....
The medical karen consequentially communicate because cloudy comprehensively bake against a grotesque shelf. determined, sneaky stomach
Мне показалось или The Weekend простыл . Выздоравливай!
So cool
головной убор прям в тему оценки трека
Hints of Morrisey...
Honestly love all of The Weeknds live performances more than the studio versions, so much talent it's incredible.
I love the instrumentals
THISSSS

日本にもこれくらい凝った演出してくれる音楽番組が欲しい
Am I the only one that thinks he's gonna be the next Michael Jackson?   P.S. No one can replace MJ. He just gives off MJ vibes.
For real
He sounds like he has a nice voice but I just couldn't sit through all that auto tune.
We're on to you Justin Bieber...Really?

Hmmm... This is virtual insanity...
Nothing better than listening to the weekend on the weekend
Cynical Brits: We love you, The Weeknd, sir. However, you've rinsed this incredible LP... The Weeknd: Try this. Cynical Brits: Good grief... So sorry about that. Please, do carry on. Have you got any more, per chance?
like a pet shop boys performance
What’s your next song I like this one
Alguém do Brasil aqui que ama as músicas desse cara?❤️😁🇧🇷
Even in a rain suit the weekend kills it
He has to be singing from his soul he’s gotta be
Pet shop boys

Просто гений музыки
😐😐😐😐
An Aquarius anthem
The man is a MEGA STAR...BRAVO
Through collaboration between Ariana Grande and Weeknd I discovered this masterpiece. It’s such a good song. 😊👍🏻
I'm not really a weeknd guy, its not really my type of music. I'm  more of a 70s rock and 80s type of guy but this one l like. Good lyrics and the songs very 80s inspired, perhaps thats why l like it. Good job. Also congrats on the award.
Tribute to the legendary 80’s music style era when I was a teenager …..greetings from belgium in Europe Take Care :-)
What an amazing song!  I love u #theweekend  your songs r full of love! 🎼😍
The first black guy in years who sings and not raps, Bravo! Greetings from Poland.
Es una música genial, ¡felicidades! pero no hace falta retar a la naturaleza y hacer tantas tonterías, pq t da un rayo y no lo cuentas
Best artist
You know that why he is hiding his face lol 😗
Weeknd: I’m cool with a rain coat covering all my body and face Top Female singers: show all skin including v and b sexually as graphic as possible
It looks he’s in transition or something, barely see his face.
That hat is most likely more than my salary
What a beautiful music full of passion
The Weeknd looking like Raiden from Mortal Combat, his drip is 🥶🧊☃️
Love it 😍
meee brazil hellooo the wee
Tan feo quedo este weon que no muestra su cara xD

I love the hand movements he does throughout the whole performance as if he was playing the piano 🤩
This song sound like electrical disco reminds me of Giorgio Moroder...cool n make your shoulder   dancing.
Brutal !!
You can tell from the way he performs, "save your tears" is one of his favorite
Daft Punk will be so proud. So good.
Это же песня Молданазара🤣🤣🤣
Woew   weekend

แต่ตัวเหมือนคนตัดอ้อยแถวบ้านเลย
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sounds like 80’s new wave to me.
A fan of JamiroquaI I see.
Es chido de wikend!
The Weeknd got an angelic voice 👼
Amo esta música muchas grasias the weeknd ❤️
Но предыдущая версия в зале со «зрителями» больше нравится
Круто сделан клип
Que dire t es le meilleur ! 😍
Can’t explain how beautiful this is
I have no words
Ethiopia to the world!!! 🟩🟨🟥
Auch eine schöne Version 👍
the best of  the years
idk why but i think even in another 10 or 100 years this song will still hit the same 😍
Forever❤
Music  top the best
he did this concert on a week day
Daft punk make him legend
Perfeito. Você sabe que eu te amo, Abel ? 🥺
Paddington with depression
Worst Jamiroquai video ever.
Hace tiempo el The Weeknd melancólico, depresivo, atestado en drogas, perdido en la noche, poeta maldito; con un sonido único, psicodélico, sensual y triste a la vez; nos abandonó para volverse un músico (porque ya ni artista es) más de la industria.  RIP Abel: tus fanáticos de la primera hora te extrañaremos.
Man your songs make me sleep every night peacefully
i love this song 🥲 im fall in love to The Weeknd
Terrible 👏👏👏❤
6 6 6
Save your tears and rain are a very dangerous duo.
Братка🥶
Legend
Wweooooohhooooo🥰🥰🥰

Somehow the weekend has found a way to make all of his songs sound the same
It is crime!  After skipping the creative stage, we love you from 🇮🇶 iraq .
Your voice has changed a lot
I know what you did last summer face ass
Such a great song. ReaLly appealing video too 👌🏼
It's been such a long time since a male singer has been at the top like this. He's not problematic, has a great catalogue, and a beautiful man ugggh. We're so lucky.

So much emotion in his voice.

He really should do a soundtrack for Starnger Things.

The voice, no sudden break, no roughness, polished like a diamond.
That fit is 💯💯💯
lo9ve his songs
All of this! ⛈
Cuando me quede dormido soñare contigo:'c
When I 1st heard The Weekend on the radio, my heart started pounding..those of you who aren't familiar with The King of Pop, the late Michael Jackon...The Weekend sounds so much like him..I wouldn't absolutely 💞💞💞'd 2 have seen them collaborate.
Paddington ❤️
He's one of the best performers out there for sure.
I fuck with the little nightmares inspired fit 🙌🏿
You're starting to sound like a broken record come up with some new music feel that heart and soul of a new song
Love him
wearing Paddington's hat
*EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERO**#OOOOOOOOOOOOERYDDDDDDDDDDDDDIERSDDDDDDDDROG*
Ta vie , ton parcours... franchement merci pour tout ce que tu fais Abel 💞 😍..je t'adore 💖

Weeknd i wish I will buy tickets to go
We LOVE YOU WEEKND 😜
He really looks like $NOT if he was in the rain
The weeknd is the type of music that u need when u most need ;V
Quem nunca comeu pão com Gibi e tubaina não sabe o que esta perdendo.
Вот это шляпа! Кто нибудь знает где купить ?
Te amo the weeknd
He had to cheat on her to make good music tho?
Shout out to gashi
Andas blanquito bro Jajaja

Hard times, great songs! (Música chiclete de 2021!)
I love it
oh my fyyckin gosh! i love the weeknd! ;)
Paddington bear can sing..
Nice, caught me from the 1st sec. Revival of '80.
This dude is the new Michael Jackson
На рыбалку брат
The end melody
The Grammys can't save their tears when they watch this!
I want The Weeknd and Post Malone to collaborate!
PERFECTLY SPOKEN !😁💪💞💫😙😙
Paddington?
this literally sounded like the studio version. the only way I'm able to tell it's not is because of the vocal breaks where he shifts the microphone in front of his face
Está masó no más la cancion
credits for steadicam operator plssss!!!
Black Smurf....
I'm in 90s but inside 80s techno
This is really amazing 😉

Clothes: ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' Call back to After Hours 2020?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😘😘🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I love save your tears and blinding light and I could hear The Weeknd sing the Album After all day 🥰🥰🥰
Linda apresentação 😍
im obsessed with this performance
This former talent has ended up in weak mainstream
The vibes killing it...
I see he's pulling a Britney Spears onto us with the fake lip synching. Britney did it first, so I guess it's monkey see monkey do right?  You can hear the backing track. Fucking useless. Sorry, but I disliked this. Don't lip synch next time, bud. Also how the fuck was this even "live"?? It sounds pre-recorded as fuck.
Abel on that I Know What You Did Last Summer vibe rn 😮
Looks like a black Justin Bieber to me.  Plus he's throwing up all those Goat Lucy signs.
God I love this man
🤍💙
He look like snot lol
Te amo, I love you
Long live Israel 🇮🇱
I hear this song all the time in the supermarket..  It's definently a good song but.. I work in the supermarket   i am going insane because its on repeat after every x amount of songs 🤣🤣
Zionist occupation is targeting the red crescent and its ambulances.  This is a war crime. #GazaUnderAttack #IsraeliTerrorism  #freepalestine
The Weeknd is such a one of a kind I'm so glad I found him ❤️😊
This is the beginning of a new era I fear😳
❤️😍
By the way.  It's not the song.  It's him.  He has "IT".  Few do.
Привет Марина, Вчера был в парке, пил сок
He looks like he has so much freedom when he sings, little effort to sound so big and on point...
Can't describe the feelings out of words ❤️
Ay, tienes tantos estilos...
Que Sdds que eu tava de ver esse homem se apresentando, soltando esse vozeirão😍♥️😍♥️
💜💜
He knows what ya'll did last summer

Jesus Christ loves you, so much that He died for you on the cross, to pay the penalty of your sins so that you wouldn't have to. Put your full trust and believe in Him for salvation today, because who the Son sets free is free indeed 🙏🏻 Kindly consider receiving Him into your heart as your LORD and Saviour, it's the best decision you'll ever make 😊 (Romans 10:9-10 and Ephesians 2:8-9)
wicked good!
2,7 dislikes? Why? This music is amazing 🙌🙌🙌

Lol sorry but he's giving me Very much "I know what you did last summer" with that ugly ass raincoat suit. 🤣
The rain coat reminds me all the time on little nightmares 😂
This is how the music industry should be. Not only making money but also being passioned and artistic, giving a real vocal and show for the viewers.
Как всегда великолепно!!!
The weeknd ❤❤❤
Cool & Smooth.
It's so great how this man can do (and in this case, wear) the most ridiculous things and still put on an enjoyable show XD
The weekend version of little nightmares 😃
Te amo <3

I almost expect him to take his hat off and then peel of a mask to reveal he’s Michael Jackson.
I love you abel❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gave me Tears in the Rain vibe
Hey you😎,yes you.  Save your tears for another day.  Okay?

I loved the original version but since the remix came out I hear this version again and only imagine Ariana background vocals inside my head
Really amazing

He look like characters from little nightmares
Paddington😊

*ari at home rubbing her Tummy 🙈💖
Put this version on Spotify!! 🤩✨
The Weeknd se puso otra vez la cara normal?? Alguien que hable español que me diga ?? 😳
MANS NOT HOT
eu esperando a ari brotar do chão🤡🤡🤡
Woah woah was that a Hanna OST sample at the start???
I though he already made this song???????
I've never heard paddington bear singing like here in the Video ........."save your tears for another day"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😅😉
See this : https://youtu.be/bhnwgRmhDIo it's music 🎧👆❤️🎶🎵 give me your opinion please 😉💋 made in France!
Another great song
Lowkey reminds me of jamiroquai
WHEN NEW SONG?
Magic👏👏
fuckk grammys
I have loved this song for so long that it always plays in my head🤩🤩🤩
Grandes ligas super Grandes ligas super
I loved the synth part in the begining!
ladies and gentlemen.... _him_
Why does he look like he knows what I did last summer 🤣🪝
I need that outfit anyone found it ?
In this darkness I can't see this sunshine
this song has gotten me through the loss of my brother. IDK why but every time I am feeling really sad, I put this on and even though I still cry--it doesn't hurt as bad
I See you
The adventurous cello totally attach because hamburger fortunately remain besides a brawny cappelletti. nifty, adventurous canvas
Przepiękny utwór 👏
He is so cool in every suit and style that it scares me lmao
no me canso de escucharla
Espectacular me enamoro  la primera vez que la escuche
Now he's The Captain.😆
SO COOL WTF
The dude is a sensation.
Let me dance
I make you cry 🎶🎶🎶  When i run away 🎶🎶🎶
This signer is a highly danger it's in a big terasisim organization that made this songs by a real people live . There fam depending on how much things they do to this organization  If you listen to the song you will see clearly it's not thing made for fun or to get power from it. Its made clearly by terasisim scenes that didn't made by  coincident.  Be aware of what you give your ear to . It's not a joke it's a people live
He's looking like he just went back from fishing
How could this be the live😂
Loving this I know what you did last summer remake
investing in Sou'wester stocks
This gives me Death Stranding vibes and some similar themes. Love  The Weeknd!
2.5k dislikes? Bruh? Btw why is it raining
*I don't think anyone is talking about how good this song in the captain's hat is*
I‘m still waiting for an After Hours music Video. How lit it would be to hear a live performance of it. Oooh babyyyy where are you now when i need you most😪
❤
i love you
The Weeknd/The Best ❤
Where is he?
Bữa nay tuấn cùi mặc đồ cưng quá
I wouldn’t really call it live more like pre recorded
THIS IS MY MOST FAVORITE SONG OF THE WEEKEND
He's actually trying to make the rain stop by singing the song
wow?
Just a friendly message not related to this video ☺️ God loves you, no matter who you are, where you’re from or what you’ve done. He’s waiting with open arms for you to accept Him into your lives. Please repent of your sins and ask God for forgiveness. He loves and cares for you. Jesus has already paid the price for all of our sins, you just need to believe in Him that he’s our saviour and begin to live right with God. I love you and hope you have a lovely day. God Bless You☁️🙌
Vo uu uooohhhh
My 2021 🤩
Does anybody else notice, he has such beautiful hands!
Who knew undertaker got a nice voice
I don't know why but this performance reminds me of Sucker Punch and I'm still waiting for Babydoll to come flying in anytime now through the rain....   anyone agree?  no, just me... okay  I'll just wait
Evlenelim evlenelim evlenelimmmmm
How cool does he look !

Сколько можно выпускать одну и ту же песню?

Its aaa awesom
There’s rappers out there beefing and flexing their riches while The Weekend is chillin and vibin

Catchy tunes :)
A new era is on the horizon! Abel's work rate is ridiculous
I am speechless I love ❤️ it  and the clothes look so good and the song and the rain ☔️ the music from the piano 🎹 it matches save your tears and there is rain 🌧
Aun no veo la versión norteña de esta rola :v a como van las cosas seguro saldrá :v

Arguably the best musician of this generation 🖤

At one point in his career he should do cover songs from Michael Jackson cuz his voice is literally the same with MJs
ENIGMATIC ! ❤️❤️❤️❤️

I was waiting for Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinz Jr. to run him over at some point.  #ikwydls
I love the song so much. I'm a big fan
he looks like the fisherman from the ,,I Know What You Did Last Summer" franchise and he still kills it, a legend
The weeknd are you cool end fantastic
Michael Myers on the keys
I just can't realize how this was filmed. It's amazing!!!

The visual looks like "don't hurt yourself" by Queen B
If "The Weeknd" did a Michael Jackson cover, then the world would explode!! xD
So happy I booked a ticket for his tour in 2022 (October in Cologne) <3<3<3 He is live soo amazing

We had Micheal Jackson before, now we have the Weeknd
This man pisses musical excellence.
Scenary perfect 😍💖
Single handedly my favourite male vocalist globally! His vocals SLAY
If Michael Jackson were alive and well, I imagine he'd be making music that sounded much like this.
You should name your next album “DAWN FM”
Drake is shaking.
Pure voice 🔥🤩
Mama talkin that real life

I would do a favor for you and the weekend and goodbye
Subscribe
The only artist which I enjoy listening to either on recorded songs or live. It's just amazing!
Ask how do you make the song save your tears this is you but young man I mean, what I don't understand the guy who is doing is the one to save Your Tears the one with the mask you wear makeup or what the hell
This is so beautiful
Nice person. ❤️
😍😍😍😍😍❤️

Really hard is to make a song worthy of a "ear's love". This is the tune! This buddy makes proud his feet!
Como faz pra eu curtir 100000 vezes?
BRIT awards.. and rain... It always rains in Great Britain LOL
Both these dudes won big at the Brit awards for this performance alone, surely.
It is fabulous I am surprised with all the video of the weknd o(^▽^)o
Tudo o que esse homem faz fica maravilhoso 🔥
Wooahhh
I'm a simple person, i see any version of this song i start vibing
The Weeknd is a Prince fan tho.

The Little Nightmare
I saw the Brit awards it was okay, but, the older ones are better :(
I always came late when The weekend post a comment. :(
Imagining Ariana together, will be awesome too 😵
Love this song.
I think he was singing trough his nose, and that ducked with my nose too.
where's Ari? hahaha❤️❤️❤️❤️
A legenddddd I CAN'T
I love this song, but this song is sad tho.
I can hear grammy's team crying everytime him sings. Incredible, he's just incredible.
Repetitive lyrics but i like the vibe, his voice, i could listen to him till i fall asleep
J adore ❣️:^);)
Красиво поёт

This original version is so much better than the ‘remix’
Abel is blessed with MJ vocals.Thank you GOD for bringing back such an epic voice
his vocals are insane!! the power, the tone, everything, wow!!
Akon put the blame on me flow
i like that bro with the piano
The tasty popcorn strikingly number because governor phylogenitically tremble an a gainful state. polite, noiseless respect
He knows what you did last summer
Well I'll save my tears because your voice is so cool
Ya no sabe qué sacar este men..  v: Ya has algo nuevo 😂😂

Very stupid.. only this song you have??
Hermoso
HIS VOCALS ARE JUST WOAH
This is Masterpiece
I feel like people be sleeping on his songs til its super popular
Damn!!! This is LIVE 😳?!!! He sounds perfect!!! 😊 He is stunning!!! 🤩
He sounded like Daffy Duck at 3:40 lol, no offence
reminds me of those wonderfully melodic but understated 1980s songs which spoke to a generation.Great song and memorable vocals
İstanbul’dan selamlar😊🇹🇷❤️
Me recuIt reminds me of the video of "ignorantes" by Bad Bunny and Sech, it seems recorded in the same place and with the same clothes that Bad Bunny wore xd
https://youtube.com/channel/UC3ieSAke5-F9-PhIOCkoGJw
is it raining
I love you Tuấn Cùi. (From Vietnam)
his jacket kinda looks like the yellow raincoat girl from little nighmares
Congratulations 🥳 from the UK!
I Love music
Melhor cantor do mundooooo
Estaremos en el 2021 y más lejos llegaremos pero...esta música me transporta a los 80-90,tenía una paz que hecho de menos hoy. Por aquel  entonces el mundo empezó a correr, con una velocidad de vértigo y no quiso ver la posibilidadde andar más despacio con pasos seguros para el futuro, la avaricia ha quebrado a el Planeta. Los animales tienen la condición de preservar por instinto, el hombre con toda la inteligencia de la que cree poseer...con la misma, es destructivo por gilipollas.
🥲
POGHAMP
He looks like a new skin on Colt lol
I love this guy and maroon 5 (Adam Levine)
eu sou o comentário brasileiro que vc procura

VOCÊ PERDEU GRAMMY. VC SABE QUE PERDEU !!!
Amazing 👏👏👏👏👏
Slave of tears
He looks like a ted.
the dawn is coming...
Let me be honest. It’s sounds like all auto tune. Don’t think it’s really live. Looks like a music video as well.
🙏🏽♥️🙏🏽♥️
In this clip the whole scene was small, except for the abell's nose!
The new Scooby doo villain looks good.
I can't even find a word to describe it. This is just amazing! The concept, scene and his heavenly voice make the whole performance breath-taking !
El mejor

He looks like he knows what I did last summer.
He captioned a post with this outfit as i know what you did last summer. Alot of people thought it was a reference to shawn mendenez but its actully to a horror movie with the same name. It was a film in 1997 where the killer was a crzaed fishermen with the same kind of outfit
Reeeey 🥰🥰🥰
Te amoooooo 🤣🥰🥰
Киркоров, снимай шляпу - мы тебя узнали
I really felt the words this time
he’s wearing the captain suit because the sea gets rough when the person he’s talking about can’t save there tears  just rain them down on him
Proud to be born in the era of the weeknd🔥
With Ariana 🎶 was very ❤️
Amazing performance as always
Beautiful sounds like 80's songs
A truly magnificent song
I don't know why I run away
Uuuuuuuuuiii this is life💯💯💯💯💓💓💓💓🎶🎶🎶🎶
I have never seen Abel dancing soo freely before
Internado en el hoyo 🤔😂

I love your work but your opinion about isreal and Palestinians We gave them everything the fact they aren’t going to there mother lands and don’t being excepted there .... they are attacking us for decades and we have tolerance for them more then every country that gets that kind of attaks from there enemies You are totally wrong And i dont hate them or anybody for that matter i just want to live quietly and peacefully As a known figure you have much responsibility use you words and opinions carefully or you just doing wrong by saying or  pushing other sayings in the media
❤️❤️❤️
Bruh this one is actually fire 🔥
he looks like a singing mushroom. BUT I LOVE IT
Amazing performance and all but those piano key - finger imitations where not on point haha
His natural voice is the best in the game, your faves with autotune can't relate.
I know what you did the last summer vibes
Donde Están los Latinos?

ME ENCANTAAAAAAAA
Autotune has left the chat
I love you as a singer but u really messed up said "free Palestine" u don't even know the story behind the true! Before u wrote check out that Hama's is terrorism organisation that don't care about his citizens that use them as a human shield..  Like everyone know Israel is the only country that have real democracy in the middle east and accept every religion..
Ey Weekend WTF making Last 3 years Bro? .....

Nobody told me doom mushroom performed at the brit awards

He looks like Rayden from Mortal Kombat.
Hello Jesus loves you.   John 3:16: For God so he loved to the world, that he gave the only begotten Son of him of him, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  ~ God wants to give you salvation, what is necessary is that you draw closer to God, that you ask forgiveness for your sins and believe in Jesus the Savior. Let's get close to God, let's obey Him. ~ For God there is nothing impossible.   ~Would you like to be a Christian?
The red lights are really hitting, first Olivia now The Weeknd
The new sensations
This is so great
🐐🐐🐐
Why he cosplaying as the hash slinging slasher
So glad our fellow Torontonian keeps showing his talent.  The Grammy snub, the SuperBowl show bashing, his costumes.  I can't wait til he cleans up at this year's Billboard Awards.  16 noms & NOTHING from Grammy?  Kiss it, I would say.
The image just keeps reminding me of the bad guy in "I know what you did last summer" - maybe he was going with that..!
covid suit
I still hope him & Selena end up back together🤧 I’ll never get over that relationship
I have the Ariana part burned into my brain
Watched Weeknd several years ago when support act for drake.many a good song great live
Me encantan sus cansiones
The weeknd on work days = being a fisherman.
Я искал его. Майкл, ты зачем от нас ушёл!? Вернись! Прошло много дней...  The Weeknd! Yes!
O my Good this video is great
Nice rhythm....🤠🎶🎵🎶🎼🎸🎧

Is there any reason for not listing to this song
The Grammys award is dying because of this man.
Now I can listen to the 80s music without hiding myself...😅

Such a beautiful song.  And amazing Artist.
Wow. The cinematographer is amazing.
Everything about this song is just so pleasing.
I love it, but where is Ari? 😫

Yo esperaba ver a Ariana Grande 🙄💔
i love you music the weekend
‼️‼️THERE IS OPPRESSION IN THE PALESTINE.  Please be sensitive, let's share and end this persecution together.  People kill for the religion they choose.  A total of 83 people, including 17 children, 7 women and 59 men, have been killed in Palestine in the last two days.  487 people were injured.  The only fault of these people is that they are Muslims. Israel attacks them with missiles.  Even if we cannot do anything, we can show that we oppose this persecution by publicizing it.  Please do not be indifferent.
Приятно слушать твои песни дружище!
Isto sim, é um tapa na cara do Grammy, ele está cada vez mais bombando.
ว้าวววววววมาก

Juárez 2021 the weeknd
This concept is so astonishing.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I find it a coincidence this pops up after this song was stuck in my head

THE WEEKND THE BEST
Imagine holding a trophy in a weeknd concert
Me aburri
Awsome
Clearly the Fisherman from 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' is singing during the weeknds.
This is not a joke anymore. I have a huge crush on him.
𝐒𝐀𝐕𝐄 𝐘𝐎𝐔𝐑 𝐓𝐄𝐀𝐑𝐒!!!!
I love this ..song 😊🧡❤❤
Amo The Weeknd❤️❤️
Te amo

Beginning I have feeling of i pet goat
Plot twist: he was actually wearing the raincoat because the weather changed just before he was about to perform.
I like this version
I know what you did last summer 💧
Abel is amazing guys were so blesssed to have him
I think it’s literally amazing how this is number one then he dropped the remix and made a whole new song
Hi
this album was a masterpiece.....so happy i got it on wax and signed <3..This is ART.
He looks like the guy from I know what you did last summer, this creeping me out
Is that the dude who did the uncut gems ost? OPN?
Tks Abel for making city pop raise again
Ídolo 👏👏👏
Your voice 🥺❤️
THIS IS GOLD
without ariana it doesn't have the same shine 😚
Is this real u cuz ur face is like u make back to normal one
Israel is here FOREVER ♾🇮🇱❤️with peace and love we are the win all☮️❤️🇮🇱♾‼️
The weeknd married me 😩❤️ your voice is so beautiful
I frickin' not getting bored watching this again n again. 😭😭♥️♥️
Not me waiting for Ariana 😂🤡
This man is a gift 👁👄👁
Abel's outfits have their own fanbase.
Pura maldita simbologia.
"На рыбалку собрался?"
It is the most beautiful song.
😍
Fellow me guys 🖤🖤🖤
Classic
his outfit giving me paddington bear vibes
Loveee itttt ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Azərbaycandan sevgilərimlə 🇦🇿

TheWeeknd_I_Loveeeee ....!!  😊✨
#SaveYourTears ✨💖
Te Amoooo ❤❤❤
Wow that’s his true voice love it! It’s natural!
One of a very few artist today that truly is an exceptional talent. This man would have fit perfectly in the decade of 1980s music world. That is perhaps the biggest compliment I can give someone. Because the 1980s music scene was outrageously incredible!!
Is it just me or I just heard a Roblox thunder noice. 0:02
i can't wait to see Ariana grande performing these song too
Love you Abel
Stranger things vibe.
This man right there is the man who reached 3 number one hit songs in three different years from the same album. The Weeknd deserves it
My man looks like he just lost his paper boat to pennywise
He looks like six from little nightmares and it would make sense because its a song from chapter six.
Wtf is this plastic surgery
The melody was inspired in "Love Generation" by Bob Sinclair ;)
His face okay again😜😜
This is what I do alone at home 0:00 - 3:00

His hands are white?
I know what you did last summer
Lyrics (:  I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh) You look so happy when I'm not with you But then you saw me, caught you by surprise A single teardrop falling from your eye  [Refrain] I don't know why I run away I make you cry when I run away  You could've asked me why I broke your heart You could've told me that you fell apart But you walked past me like I wasn't there And just pretended like you didn't care  [Refrain] I don't know why I run away I make you cry when I run away  Take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another   Save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day (So)   I made you think that I would always stay I said some things that I should never say Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine And now you won't love me for a second time  [Refrain] I don't know why I run away, oh, girl Said, I make you cry when I run away   Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another I realize that I'm much too late And you deserve someone better  [Chorus] Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah) Save your tears for another day (Yeah)  [Refrain] I don't know why I run away I'll make you cry when I run away  Save your tears for another day Ooh, girl, I said  Save your tears for another day    Save your tears for another day  Save your tears for another day
I like the song but, he looks like a pirate whos bitter from getting dumped by his model ex-gf 😂

SAVE YOUR TEARS - Draw 🎨 Available on my YT channel
Go the has
My channels name ADITHATTU CYPHER  please see some vedio and share
My favourite performance of the whole show, for many reason it wasn't preaching or trying to send a political message like half of the Brits show just pure good performance I liked all of the tracks that have charted blinding lights was one of my favourite tracks of the whole year. What change it for this is when it was picked as the wrestlemania theme track then picked up in mainstream then Superbowl, and ur right if that is not one the best key change of recent times show me one
It is rain btw, let's put the raincoat on
The rainfall is from saved tears. Great performance.
Member when live shows had crowds?
A moment of silence for the dislikes who don't understand art...
O quanto eu gosto dessa música...
Wow he's amazing 2021

Everything bout you is unique. You are like Arthur witha Excalibur on the keys.

Left Hand + Lightning bolt over left shoulder = Symbolism everyone watching should know the meaning of. Buckle up, buckaroos!
It would’ve been so awesome if Ariana showed up out of nowhere and started singing 🤩 I love her feature on this song

ОМГ! Как же я люблю эту песню!
Awesome song, also definitely vibing a lot more with the Jeepers Creepers suit over the "Stung by bees" look from the other video.
This song has been played into the ground.  It’s the modern Macarena at this point.
I know what are you do in last summer
Don't know why i feel like i have heard this melody before but just can't remember where..🤔🤔🤔
I just wanna drench and dance in the rain while listening to this banger

Dedicated to wild horses
The time travelers in 6021  Are seeing the impact for this music  He’s legacy still remains in the year 6021

A bucket in a bucket hat, unexpected
When he knows that destroyed his face with a Lot of cirugies, but has a amazing voice anyways... Sorry for My Bad English.
Me encanta

Alguien habla español 😅

By far the best live performance in my opinion. Like the way they remixed the shit out of the instrumental i just frikin love it.
That looks like Six from Little Nightmares (but in black)
*2:45**-**3:57**  when you save your tears so long*
Brilliant song, vocals, sound editing and balance. I could hear he put a bit more into his vocals here than usual. I guess he felt he had too, his audience,.. it's the Brits...Awards for "Real" Talent.
Everything is well except the inside lightning effects does not coincide with outside. Sound is marvelous
Little nightmares??🥶
💔🎶🎶😍♥
Хайртай шүү 😭⚡️🌤
Dang he missed his chance with that hat and Cinco de Mayo by 6 days lol
Amo esta canción, aunque ella ya no me amé...😢
Hands down the weeknd and Bruno Mars are the best modern singers right now. I really want these two musicians to collab
Arte 💜
Wantopted
❤️❤️❤️
Hello i m new
Was it actually raining or they wasted so much water just for the effect? Just wanna know but still love the song and performance.❤️👍

Killed it like always! Love the artist you’ve become
Te amooo tantoo
Legend ❤️
how he didn't get nominated for a grammy this year for this album is just astounding
https://youtu.be/Jh4-yjDuPoQ
And the worst hat of the year award goes to.....
Where's Ariana????
I don’t think anyone caught the fact that the old Weeknd is back . I honestly thought he grew back his hair
My favorite this 2021 😍
Im still confused why an obvious grammy-worthy artist didn’t have any nominations. Shame on the Grammys
🥺🥺♥️
King
So ya’ll telling me this was live?!  We don’t deserve this man at all. Like this voice is so angelic what the hell 😭❤️ It made me cry for some reason...
de lokos
He looks like 6 from little nightmares I love it

The 1.8k people are here disliking just for fun🙄

I love you

One of the Real artists left. Like him or not. He is todays Micheal Jackson.. he is a performer and video genious.. you don't have to agree it's fine.
i love paddington bear
This man doesn't need autotune. He has natural talent and a voice so pure that autotune would ruin it
Man when I seen Lionel Richie perform I knew exactly what the cheek and forehead makeup was about. Genius
Who’s the captain now??
I love Abel’s air synth
confused why someone would dislike this
Jamiroquai vibes
Bruh. Dude is wearing a rain coat inside 🤣
This captain look is the new look for the new album

Your truly a genius the Aquarius ♒️ is the true GOAT in the zodiacs they all have a very unique way of how they capture their whole mind thought process and just master the fuck out of their craft I truly admire it and it’s hella sexy only those who truly know know but it’s always amplified at 3\5 Am those moonlight vibes get their creative juices flowing and it’s only understood by those who live at night night owls it’s cause it’s when everything is quiet I like to hear my own thoughts I’m only a cancer ♋️ Gemini ♊️ cusp 23 but I love to see how beautiful the moon really shines the brightest on Aquarius ♒️

Perfection in a live performance  Incroyable 🇫🇷
He looks like the killer of "I know what you did last summer"
I Know What You Did Last Summer meets The Brits Awards 2021
The monster in the music
Hello fellow xo
Low EQ : Oh no this song won’t be hot   *High EQ* : No , we just come early
A looped beat with 3 notes and hidden humming. Overrated much
Me encantas eres 😍 💕 ♥  💖
N consigo mais salva minhas lágrima patrão  ja escutei essa musica demais
How cool is this Performance? Amazing!!!
Abel parecendo um trabalhador rural
🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
te amo, the weeknd. eu te amooo
I listen to this song, when going to sleep, waking up. And through the day so I’d say I play it like 7 times a day and it just takes me to this futuristic place peacefully, where I am the star. I need to dance this in the club. Whenever they reopen .
💫💫💫
Incrível
He’s fabulous 👌🏻🥰
Been a fan since 2015. Abel, you never miss and your music just keeps getting better and better, I love your music videos and songs always. I love this performance video!!
Love this song
When you are a superstar, you can wear a silly hat like that and still be cool!!
💟 The best performance and I like his style 👏👏👏
An absolute musical genius
With Ariana, this would be AMAZING.
I love you, thank you for everything, you are a great inspiration for me whenever I listen to your songs I can feel those intense emotions in a few words you are a fabulous person ❤ espero algun dia poder conocerte...
Thank you for your music  that help me to feel better in this moment that I am very sad. You are very talent young man. Congratulations!
Crazy men!
this live version sounds better than the ariana grande remix
…wow.
I know what you did last summer looooooook
Sometimes he sounds like Robin Gibb.
Top top top
I LOVE YOU FROM PALESTINE
пока все смотрели видео, я пыталась найти панаму с:
Jesus loves y’all
222 angel number...
I love this song with all my heart ❤️
I love the reference: “I know what you did last summer”, 1997 🔥🧡
Am I the only one who feels remembered of Robin Gibb's Singing?

Que pedazo de tema 👌
Y el calamardo ??  ☻🤣

It is not the same without Ariana's powerful voice.
Around the 20 second mark a little bit there sounded like Goodbye Horses.
He is very talented
this man is utter perfection
So nobody is talking about how cinematic the camera movents and overall cinematography are with this performance? They are all just as dope as the song itself!
Só os BR ... Let,s Go lik
but why he always hides his face, is there any pimple lmao.
The hat: 🍄
Giving me "I know what you did last summer" vibes
The weeknd became Raiden from Mortal Combat
My baby
My msn is so inspiring ❤️
Imagine If weeknd invited Ariana to sing save your tears remix 🥺🥰
Little nightmares six looks different here
HAT SHAPED LIKE COPPER SHIPS OF ANGELS, LAMENTATIONS OF THE GODS, IF ENOCH HAD DONE GREAT SIGNS, IF ENOCH HAD NUMBERED DAYS, IF ENOCH WAS STERN WITH US BUT HE WAS OUR FRIEND,  THEN WE WOULD HAVE LISTENED AND NOT HAVE BEEN CAPTURED IN ATMOSPHERE, TEARS SAVED FROM 5500 YEARS AGO AND NOW REVEALED TO THIS GENERATION WITH CARS, BENNY WAS FORERUNNER YOU SEE HIS GREAT POWER, SO DIVINE CAPTURE YOUR CARS GLOBALLY
NOW 120 YEARS OF CARS PROPHESIED TO END SAME WAY AS ANCIENT WORLD, WITH ALL CARS,PLANES,TRAINS,METAL SHIPS CAPTURED GLOBALLY BY DIVINE MAGNETIC AERIAL WEAPON WITH OCCUPANTS TO STARVE TO DEATH IN COLD ATMOSPHERE
DONDE ESTA ARIANA GRANDEEEEEEEEEEE
ENOCH TELL GODS THAT GENTILE CHILD BORN OF THEM WITH TRIBAL WOMEN HAS INNATE SIN AND THEY WERE DIASPORAING GENTILE CHILDREN TO ALL THE CONTINENTS WHICH WAS SPEEDING THE CORRUPTION OF COLLECTIVITY, BUT GODS DID NOT BELIEVE THEIR WAS AN INNATE SIN AND THEM AND ENOCH WERE GOOD FRIENDS SO DIDN'T SEE THE DANGER, ENOCH SAY ALL SHIPS CAPTURED ONE DAY SUDDENLY, THEN GODS LAMENT IN COPPER SHIPS CAPTURED IN HEAVENS JUDE 6, GENESIS 6:2
Ok i respect him but can we literally talk about how his music has been degrading the past few months? Like his old songs are wayyy better than the new ones like these... nvm guys. Ik some fans are gon hop right in to fight but im jus spilling facts...
Yes it happens
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...     THE WEEKND
Abel Perfect Save Your Tears!! 🧚🏽‍♀️👂🎧🎶🎶🎶😌🥰🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I adore you.
Song of the year imo
Stylists : We gonna prepare your red suit right? Weeknd : I don't wear the red suit Everyone : we save our tears for another day!!
The best song I have ever heard
THE GODS TEARS WOULD BE REVEALED IN A FUTURE DAY....NUMBERING OF DAYS START POINT 7 OCTOBER 2018, COUNT 1260 DAYS, 1335 DAYS, 2300 DAYS CAPTUREING OF CARS GLOBALLY WITH OCCUPANTS
Se le ven muy blancas las manos
I love you Abel Makkonen  I wish one day see you face to face your always best you don’t need anything to made you greatest clip because you’re voice and your music always greatest
LAMENTATIONS OF THE GODS IN AERIAL COPPER SHIPS TRAPPED BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH....IF ENOCH HAD NUMBERED THE DAYS WE WOULD HAVE LISTENED!

Hi nice one br
Nem sei quem é, só vim dá deslike
Producer:  How many instrument do we need? Weeknd: Just A keyboard
Spotify...pleaaasse 🙏😂
he's so good that he doesnt need autotune
Ya  se  que  te  gusto  mi  comentario  y  gracias
Kd a arianaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaqq
goated.
I never wanted to like this guy, when he first came out I got so annoyed by the chart toppers. But slowly over the years this man wore me down lol. Every damn song that comes out is a BOP and I think if an artist can take you from not liking them/being interested, to knowing every song and loving them, that's the true mark of a talented artists.
The Weeknd should do a colab with Robyn.
الكراميز خلي ينيشون احسن
This is a amazing song by a amazing artist
🖤✨😍🤗
Bravo  👏
REIZINHO  dono dos raios . Filho  da  Tempestade

I love the weekend so much I listened to his song for over 7 years now! I love how much he had grown with his business, he deserves a lot   P.S you look so cute and adorable🥰
Very disappointing to see that Valentino logo. 🤢

The intro just got me more exited to hear the rest ,goosebumps the whole time , XOTWO !!!!! The Weeknd ladies and gentlemen

Yes  King 👑 🖤🖤
*Abel
I love this song. Able is the one of the most  talented  artist today. Every song  deserves recognition for an award.
lol last night I had a dream where The Weeknd was my uber driver and I was like "omg you're one of my favorite singers" and he looked back at me and started crying, and stopped paying attention to the road and ran a bunch of stop signs... This was all while his song Blinding Lights played in the background and I was singing along to it too
This is your best song, SO GOOD!!!
❤❤❤❤
This song gives me power. That is the influence of a great singer. Thank you Weeknd.
How is he abel to sing so well?
Essa música sempre me faz chorar
Amazing
Seemed liked the worst outfit at the first glance but justified later when it rained. Pure utility
Pure gold
Just so good.
As an X.O I’m beyond proud of him

Even without the red suit aesthetic, these songs sound so natural as Weeknd songs, amazing artist.
Greatest
You are the best❤️
Abel doesn’t need a Grammy….GRAMMY NEEDS HIM!!!!
I love you ... I from Brasil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

Amazing and So cute
Maravilhoso! Parabéns.
Abel couldn't stay out of the Grammy!🇧🇷
Gross af 🚯 🚯🚯
Wow, this is everything, love the whole esthetic and the music, his voice.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
When you have a live performance at 6 but your going fishing at 8 🎣
😍❤️😍❤️
İcra budur. Muhteşem bir ses...
I LOVE IT ❤❤❤
His voice is amazing
So fucking cool,
Dear Weeknd, my relationship with you is bizzarre. My ex girlfriend discovered you with Starboy and I Feel it Coming (featuring the Daft Punk) but I didn't give you too much attention, even though I found the track enjoyable. Let's jump to 2020. In February, I heard that you were about to release your new album. And I discovered "Blinding Lights". And then I lost it. I literally blasted this song EVERY TIME I was in the car, EVERY TIME, for multiple times. I clearly remember, March 6th, evening, sunset, pumping this song at full power while driving back home from work. (Only to discover this song, as a single, was released 3 months prior ahah). So yes... now I follow you ahah Thanks to After Hours. (Oh and I love Save your Tears, as well as Over Now).
PELO AMOR DE DEUS CARA! Não errei em escolher ser teu fã
SIN A.GRANDE, NO EXISTE
Letra profunda🙇🙇

Believe Jesus Christ died for your sins was buried and rose 3 days later and you'll have eternal life and you will never lose it. Jesus is the way the truth and the life, all he's asking you to do is believe

Whoever the sound engineer was for this, give that person a raise, phenomenally balanced.
The Weeknd: a pure happiness! Even when you're sad, when your heart is broken, you hear him singing and smile <3
The Weeknd doesnt need the grammys, the grammys need the Weeknd
Fit🔥🔥🔥 😷
Just one word : speechless
He has to sing now because he can only start to slaughter humans on Halloween.
I love 3000❤️

My favourite song. Amazing Performance 😳😍
The Weeknd performing SYT was already a powerful imagine it with Ariana Grande. 😳
la voz mas hermosa...
Love how he can even control the weather now
Amazing
a moment of silence to people who think the original song made by ariana and abel
Such a retro flavor.  Can easily fit into a 80's Playlist.  Great song from a solid musician.  Thank you...keep up with your strive towards perfection.

Where the guy on the ladder with the water ??
There's a reason The Weeknd supports the BRIT Awards and boycotts Grammys, it's just more genuine in terms of performances and proper talent winning without being predictable or have much bias
Buy why he lookin like the hash slinging slasher
עוכר ישראל לך תתכעווד
His attire gave me "I know what you did last summer" vibes and I'm not mad at it.. love this song can't wait to see him live 👍👍

His voice hold such a massive power 💥
this song, abel, the rain... it all gave me chills... a single teardrop falling from my eye.
hola
Wow king you are amazing 👑 🏆
Lets gooooo!!!!!!! The Weeknd is so good. Can't wait for his tour.  The video is quiet interesting as Abel is wearing all dark clothes and is some what of a mystery man. Its interesting to see that he is enclosed in a box singing an iconic song that has won soo many awards. The lights aren't full working and gives us an impressing that not everything is so bright even with the rain outside. He then proceeds outside the box as if he has overcome his fear and wants to be heard. The red lighting effect inside the box gives us a sense of danger as Abel has moved outside the box into an unknown territory but then turns back to white as soon as Abel starts singing. XOTWOD
Handsome Squidward
When the world ends this song will be in the credits
Masterpiece.

It’s the the goosebumps for me 😳
🔥🔥🔥
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do these things, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  .   You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make.   Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Do you think Abel ever thinks about the fact that at any hour of the day, someone is deep in the mix, listening to any one of his legendary league of songs, or in awe rewatching their fav performances of his - and realizes The Weeknd has become a whole planetary frequency?! ❤️⚡️⚡️⚡️Adding this to the pile of treasured performances!!

John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
Only ABEL can make a LIVE performance sound better than the original tracks!

Strange to think that  apparently he spent a huge amount of his own money for his set at the NFL half time show, but still did an amazing performance here in a box and a bucket hat.

What a talented man, really. I hope he continues to be successful for years to come. This song is magical and powerful, I would have liked the performance of the remix with Ariana, but I'm satisfied. His voice sounds exactly the same as in the studio.  PS; glad to see his face is normal again (I think, not clearly visible)
i was hopin it was the remix with ari but damn its still alright soft voice-
#BlankFace😷
He likes my lobster though... Doesn't he?

This is such a good song. He actually sounds better live. Wonderful artist.  This song really helps for my mental health, the lyrics "save your tears for another day" make me thinks just keep going and you will be okay. The weeknd and sia are my fave artists because of their wonderful lyrics and songs. Hope they collab ❤️

MEXICO ES X'O
Abel doesn’t need a Grammy to prove that he is one of the best artists ever.
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
God init?,

I'm so thankful that he exists!

Abel aka The Weeknd innovates a lot in everything he does and that likes the GP very much, what a great reference you have, I am referring of course to the King of Pop
💫💫
we know you’re here Bella...
Where’s Ariana :(
The weekend version Fisherman Of I Know What You Did Last Summer
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)
Too too too sick

Nah I saw you dancing in a crowded room You look so happy when I'm not with you But then you saw me, caught you by surprise A single teardrop falling from your eye  I don't know why I run away I make you cry when I run away  You could've asked me why I broke your heart You could've told me that you fell apart But you walked past me like I wasn't there And just pretended like you didn't care  I don't know why I run away I make you cry when I run away Take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another Save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day  So I made you think that I would always stay I said some things that I should never say Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine And now you won't love me for a second time  I don't know why I run away, oh, girl Said I make you cry when I run away Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay  Save your tears for another I realize that I'm much too late And you deserve someone better  Save your tears for another day (Ooh, yeah) Save your tears for another day (Yeah)  I don't know why I run away I make you cry when I run away Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (Ah) I said save your tears for another day (Ah) Save your tears for another day (Ah) Save your tears for another day (Ah)
fancy your outfit

Kiss kiss ♥︎
Wow, just watched the actual video for this song, last night's brit performance live,  wow what a voice,  live version so much better , an amazing voice!!
Weekend is the best! Who agrees like here 👇
*It's time to repent and seek JESUS* .He gave his life, and suffered the wrath of the Father in the cross, to save you from a eternal hell. For God loves you, but the sin must be punished. On the third day He raised from the death, showing to the world that He is God. So stop sinning and clean your life. He returns soon to judge and destroy the sinners. *Read the Bible.* *THE END IS NEAR.*
🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
Energetic performance ❤
My favorite song 😌❤️❤️❤️
that's Oneohtrix Point Never
Grammy's a joke now

Ayshoooooo 👏👏👻♥️☀️
One of the best things about The Weeknd is that his voice sounds the same without auto-tune which proves that he is one of the best singers! ❤️
He sounds exactly the same from the recording! Hes so talented.
One of the few artists that sounds BETTER live, which is insane since ge already sounds angelic on the album.
Lil Jamiroquaï type in the visuals
😋
How does he hit every note so beautifully and effortlessly?! ❤️
Love this song!
Felicitări pentru această melodie și interpretare! Exact ! Să lăsăm lacrimile pentru zilele cu ploaie!
Tremanda voz q se carga The Weekend  🙇‍♀️
nothing new the previous clip with Ariana Grande at least was a modified version of the original which I love so much honestly it's already boring to watch
I enjoyed the live performance even more than the actual song 😍💣🔥
Wow he did so good with his performance
i love you abel
The Creator blessed this artist. Only the Creator can make the homeless successful.
Fuck the grammy
Amo essa música é muito linda!🇧🇷
I bet he’s going to perform the remix of this song with Ariana at the BBMAs
Born to win the hearts!!!! Xotwod
i don't know but his look reminds me of a killer from movie ''I know what you did last summer''. lol
Ladies and gentlemen,  ✨HIM✨
Glad he's not using auto tune rn good man.

Why does it look like Gandalf singing Save your tears
This guy is wearing a freaking raincoat, a quite strange hat, performing basically in a box, and it's still swagger and better than anybody else in the industry. Oh yeah, that's because he's crazy talented in case you were wondering.
Awesome Performance as ever from The Weeknd. This song is so much needed during this year especially. Way to go forever!!! Valentino Rain Coat unforgettable....
abel is so good wow
THIS MAN IS GOATED
Lip synckers🤣🤣🤣
immer wieder geil zu hören:)
Love you
Don't you feel sad that something bad is gonna happen but you are here to stop it then make other happy
Paddington 2 really is a masterpiece
I've saved my tears that's rain bro
He's the next to Michael Jackson..(even Michael didn't sound this cool live)
And Ariana?
🤧😍🎶
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩❤💕

Imádom ezt a zenét
ABEL I LOVE U
Oi oiiiiiii. Props to Oneohtrix Point Never for shreddin the Moog Synthesizer.
Who woulda thought The Weekend would be the one to catapult 80s synth pop to the mainstream.  I feel like Alphaville was an influence when making this album.
Save your tears for another day, gRaMmY 😢
That background looks like the "I Feel It Coming" scene
The hype is well deserved. This is serious talent!
Приезжай в Россию !с меня ЧАК ЧАК )

This is what 0 autotune does to a man.
Let's just say he is one of the most underrated gem in entire industry
He hits more number of good high notes in a single song than many people had done in their entire career
🌤✌️
Thanks to people like him, I can understand why Music is like air for me)
Need this entire outfit!! Where is the hat from?????
Você não precisa de Grammy para ser o novo rei do Pop!
His voice so precious... Love himm so precious....

Is that him?
I'm proud to steal this but... hehe        No one:  The handsome squidward in my room:
Великолепная музыка. Браво! From Russia with love!

Hubs called me into the living room as soon as this performance started on the Brits. Loved it and sang along
British weather in the background
That intro!! 🤩
Wooowwww .. and just alone thunder ⛈storms sounds help me meditate and help me sleep at night.  This is so awesome I felt so relaxed hearing this combination.  Love the song. And the video is awesome. I have these Govee lights tv camera so when it turned red the my whole room turned red. That's an awesome video/song . Love it
😍👍🎶🎤
His performances are always so creative, he's the best

His talent is beyond this world! hahahaha he knows what Selena did last summer ...;)

He doesn't need Grammy's Grammy's needs him
The vibes reminds me of Tintin
Great artist!
Yes king
The Weeknd seriously became such a amazing artist, I loved his old music but this gives me CHILLS. HIS STORYTELLING THROUGH MUSIC VIDEOS IS AMAZING TOO. Him and Bruno are like the definitions of their respective genres omfg.
oooooooo unbelievable 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌❤❤❤❤ salute the weeknd🙏
Why he dressed like the serial killer from I Know What You Did Last Summer
GUYS WAIT WHY DOES HE WEAR BLACK THINGS IS THIS A TEASER FOR A NEW ALBUM/SONG?

You’ve got the hat now, mate. Wear it well.
2:55 this is Ari Aster's shot
I love how the already great song has been set to the sounds of the British weather.
I'm soo excited for save your tears remix performance by ariana and abel at iheart awards!!! Can't wait!!
Te amooooooo
Hope he never quits music, it’s like therapy.
Selam
Daft Punk is watching and saying:   “That’s our Starboy”
he is gifted by lord himself
Singning a song that was written when he was homeless and transitioning it to the biggest songs of all time.
Shout out to the BRIT Awards for acknowledgeing The W Weeknd’s talent, unlike some others...
He always sounds the same. Always sounds awesome.
Love this performance soooo much
should have added Ariana's ad libs :)
Big fan 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Why is that version giving me anxiety???
I from india .. this song listen 100 times.....❤️

I Know What You Did Last Weeknd
Angelic voice
We're officially back to the '80s.
The best of the best 🥰
The Weeknd...Abel...🤩🎼💗💎 When you’ re just too talented for the Grammys!
where’s Ari?
I wish y’all would stop mentioning the Grammys.  It’s over. Yes we all know he deserved to be nominated and win.  He don’t need the Grammys acknowledgment.  He is so much bigger than them !
Not sure why but this song actually brings tears to my eyes and gives me chills. Is it just the insanely beautiful and amazing talent that this guy displays and shares with the world? Is it the lyrics?? is it the musicality? Really it's just unbelievable. It takes a lot for me to hear a song and actually shed a few tears. And to actually listen to the song and have it create chills on my skin throughout my body. I've been a musician my entire life and this guy just really does it for me.
This man, this song, this character, omg how far can go that man’ s insane talent?🤩🎼💗🪝
Good! 💞💋
THE WEEKEND IS A SATANIST
i really can’t wait for abel and ariana performance on bbmas.
Legend
Beautiful song, I wish nothing but the best for this artist and may he find happiness and love that will last a life time🌺

Proof that Grammys are rigged:
Let's talk about how good is this song ❤️
The Weeknd dont need a Grammy to prove how Amazing he is. We all know He Is 🥰😘#nogrammyneeded
The reason, this guy's music will be there for centuries, is that his style is  unique and amazing. And the simplicity of his videos
❤🤗
This man has more talent in his pinky finger than 99% of the music industry. GOAT!
Only a deaf-mute would not give this man a Grammy for After Hours
Es una PISTOLA¡!¡
Dont cry this COVID-21🦠😷is gonna save it's perks for another year

Weeknd kralım ya
a raincoat for a british award? seems very fitting tbh
my man Lopatin is jamming in the background and it hits hard
The all black outfit🤯 is he portraying another character?
British summer is coming and I want his rain gear.
And I thought it was a new clip Method man from Wu tang
*What a performance!!!!!*
Is this possible?
Só existe essa música para ele agora.

Mistrzostwo Czekam na koncert w Polsce!!!!
ICON!!
The man is hands down head and shoulders above other artists, he and Justin beiber are in the same level, others such as dua lipa and Harry styles are a joke compared to these two
The boy looking as if he‘s about to join the Flying Dutchman!
Ok but 2 things:  1) that hand is embarassing 2)wtf is this outfit
Be safe and healthy greetings from Costa Rica ❣

Why wasn't he nominated.  I am furious right now 😑😬

The Weeknd 😍👍🏻👏👏👏👏👏

800 dislikes from the Grammy staff
Plot : this dude went to pudlar school, met Lord Voldemor who taught him some dark secrets and he became a witch singer. But he was defeated by Harry Potter in a challenge, that's why he doesn't appear on the screen
Bro lookin like Raiden from Mortal Kombat 🎶🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Love from Portugal 🥰❤
Definitively artist of decade !! Fuck off Grammys award ;)
Idk why but I love when he do that 2:59
Weeknd deserved a Grammy this year but they didn't give him a single
I'm here for the raincoat jokes
Рано радовалась! Надеялась на новую песню🥺
Magic
"Its pointless like tears in the rain" 💧 #kissland #xotwod
When mom finally let you go out in rain but you must have to wear the raincoat.
I like her
Undertaker 😂
Uau! É só o que consigo expressar neste momento.
Where’s ariana grande
this performance made me a fan ❤️
absolutely sick, the weeknd is great
OMG
New weekend, new fashion, this guy can really dress well.
Im missing ariana here 🙈
this man never fails to blow my mind
Это же великолепно! Он просто БОГ🥴🌟🌟🌟💕💕💕💝❣️
This is what Grammy did not nominate
Nice
Even God can't save his tears how do i supposed to do
you are the best
Heloo
He don't need background music , he is the one with melodic voices 😇
Woah ive never been this early :D
When the remix dropped, save your tears started to define by Ariana and the Weeknd...
Best and most creative live performer in the world right now
Me waiting for Ariana to come
형  모자 무슨 컨셉이야😂😂😂 첨에 실루엣만 보일때 다시 파인애플 머리한줄 알았잖앜 lol
His outfit is inspired by the killer in the movie I know what you did last summer LOL
The sky can't save his tears for your gorgeous voice Abel.
bro the pandemic made all these insane performances possible thats crazy
I can't get the remix of my head, it's a masterpiece. I love both artist, and I'm excited for the perform Iheart radio.
I love the weeknd but i wasn't feeling this particular performance. He has amazing performances, but this ain't it.  Maybe it's that preschooler-noir hybridised raincoat he's got on that's killing the vibe.  But yeah, very shaky vocals this time around.    It's not terrible, but it's not coming with professional class, like we're used to hearing from him and musicians of his class. Instead, sounding ametur on this one.
it's not rain actually its the rain that he saved for another day
You see, some singers use auto tune in live performances but this handsome, humble guy sings without auto tune in live performances.
Weeknd at his best ...like he is always ❤️
From the  very introduction i think of Selena Gomez😃
Little nightmare 3 looking NICE!!
Just for that 'The Weeknd' is my ideol...
this deserved a grammy
its almost as good as the autotune version if not better
노래진짜넘좋음 ㅠㅠ
🌆
Обажаю эту песню))))👌👍👍👍👍
The Weeknd sings the soundtrack of my life back in my 20’s & 30’s...before the wife and kids came to be
בן אדם מגעיל, עוכר ישראל! #עםישראלחי
i wish ariana had randomly walked in and sung and then it turned into the remix
Handsome Squidward Returns???
Last part gave my killer fisherman with a hook vibes. I love it
Man this guy's music has some special vibes that cannot be explained
Am I the only one who thing Abel looks like a mushroom in this outfit.
Good
This is fabulous!👌
1.25x is way better.
this man has the amazing voice of oldern music to newer music
I think it's a great homage to Tears in the rain
The live performances hit different

I'm still in love in this song. Music video is always out of this world. Superb talent and creativity. Unique in his own way.
So no one's gonna talk about the Stranger Things feels this video gives?
For a second I thought it’s someone else singing bcos I always see him in his signature hair look. 😅
Is it really him? He doesn't even show his face 🤔
I love this song n music too much!
now that's Captain Blackbeard with his magical voice right there.
😍🥰

Another masterpiece
My ears: listening My eyes: reading the comments My fingers: scrolling My mouth: singing along My body: swaying to the beat  I'm too busy, don't disturb me.
Был нормальный красивый мужик, но зачем то сделал из своего лица Александра Реву и теперь прячет его под капюшоном))) ничему пример Джексона не научил.
always boring since the beginning till now..he never surprises
He’s come a long way. Wishing him more sore success, health, and love. This song makes me sad and happy at the same time.
Time to move to Europe
Its like a new song
they need to boost the bass
OPN in the background.
I mean Abel is the only in the musics industry who could sing better in live even better than original version.. really a talented person 😭😭😭😍😍😍😍🥺

It is the first time that he has not put on his red suit and the way he sings makes me feel literally "save your tears for another day",and also it's my favorite versión from this song
I love this so much more than the original for some reason. His voice here is just mesmerizing.

Beautiful song, but what's up with the rain coat?!

Tuuntuntuntumm
I love the new beginning of the song. And i also love that he’s singing the same way he was in the song.
I guess I was right I my theory. The red suit character died at the Superbowl after jumping off the building
I am in love with his voice, it is amazing.....fab song, cant stop singing it even when i am not listening to it, brilliant artist
Is nobody acknowledging that he's doing those hand gestures like a conductor in an orchestra?!
I love this song so damn much 😍
It's like as if he's trying to cover his sad face and tears using that hat
Cadê os br 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Hiding his new hairstyle for new era🌝🌝

*Lyrics*   Ooh Na na, yeah  I saw you dancing in a crowded room You look so happy when I'm not with you But then you saw me, caught you by surprise A single teardrop falling from your eye  I don't know why I run away I'll make you cry when I run away  You could've asked me why I broke your heart You could've told me that you fell apart But you walked past me like I wasn't there And just pretended like you didn't care  I don't know why I run away I'll make you cry when I run away  Take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another Save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day  So, I made you think that I would always stay I said some things that I should never say Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine And now you won't love me for a second time  I don't know why I run away, oh, girl Said I'll make you cry when I run away   Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another I realize that I'm much too late And you deserve someone better Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah) Save your tears for another day (yeah)  I don't know why I run away I'll make you cry when I run away  Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (ah) I said save your tears for another day (ah) Save your tears for another day (ah) Save your tears for another day (ah)
Save your tears for the DOGE
That's the appropriate outfit when you're in the UK
This song never ages.
Best song I’ve heard from him
gays, it is really the best one from you! i like this best trek)))))
Can’t stop listening to this magic music ,that’s a real miracle 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️💎💎💎💎💎
I just see weeknd as just performer who just sings the lines from his writers and just on the flow of his music produces.   I so NO talent in this guy. He can't even talk better.
I love his vocals so much
I can't wait to see you In Dallas again <3
I like remix King but Original song is Blast like killing please Abel ❤ we have big hope for Billboard performance 💯❤💎 Just Rock the show baby

Imagine if his tour stage looked like this! This would be tooooo crazy 😝
This song gets better and better the more he performs it!
Amazing.....
Live version is even better. By the way, his outifit somehow reminds me of I Know What You Did Last Summer movie. haha

Wrestlemania 37 song 🎵
Eres el mejor The Weeknd 💗💗
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bravo!!!!!!
This is you ,yo the best
I'm trying to figure out why I got so filled with emotion as I watched this, I figure its because he is a soul man, & he knows me better than I know myself, he can't help it, Abel thinks of us & gives us his soul. xxooo
Cool sound !
❤️❤️❤️💔💔💔💔love you
Love you ABEL ❤️🤩
I LOVE YOU ABEL🖤 thanks for saving my life
This man is a gem ♥
this song is so good

Damn it! He is so so talented!!!!😍
Se supera SEMPRE!!! meu Abel ♡
I die to for this person as he have a magnificent voice to sing this sort of music. Beside, I love the performance of PowlPepsi concert and edorsing about the advertising on TV
Xo fans from india
I love you The weeknd❤❤❤❤❤❤
Warning: the keystrokes are not accurate, do not try reproducing instrumentals using Abel's moves.
The weekend, Post Malone e Travis Scott na minha opinião são diferenciados d+, são únicos, criativos, difícil errarem a mão
Bro look like the killer on I know what you did last summer lol
Awe, you just can't get any better than the weeknd. Just love your music. 😊🇨🇦
Greetings from 🇲🇽
thank God there's no Ariana
Cuantos latinos aman a The Weeknd
Eu amo esse homem ❤️
TEMAZOOO🌟
Uno de mis temas favoritos como siempre me encanto ❤ y los que le dieron dedito abajo váyanse al 🤬🤬🤬c*'#$%,"
🔥🐐♥️
And never forget, he got snubbed at grammys
Urge cambio de imagen es talentoso pero no encuentra la imagen. Parece el ecoloco de Odisea Burbujas. Tal vez sin tanta producción solo un buen traje el con un buen gucci queda
Yes finally it happened
OK, PERO TU TALENTO ES ÚNICO I-

Save your tears -🎶🎶🎶best 💯
Loved it 😊
My English teacher taught us that rain 🌧 in literature symbolizes change so I’m wondering if this is Abel’s way of telling us that something different is on the way 👀
Tudo que esse homem faz é perfeito. 😍😍😍
Now that's some London vibe there! It  pours anytime..weekday or Weeknd
I Love it
weeknd is such a blessing for us !! his voice 😃😌
Fire!🔥 A great performance...
he is handsome
Eres un master!!!❤️
I LOVE It
The only singer who sings in his  completely orignal, magical and miraculous voice and BRIT awards realised that.
Thank you very much for this song. For saving my tears every day.
That outfit is rad! Going thrifting for a similar fit soon
Drake should've stole this song too
Ha moj ha 😃
the sound booth guy: *vibin* Haha Yes!

Amazing!!
The Weeknd 24.3 M de suscriptores
Ves que si tenías más ropa Abel, guapo
I remember when of House of Balloons came out thinking how incredible and unique it was and how there were all these sounds I'd never quite heard. All these feelings I couldn't remember anyone quite touching on in the same way. And everyone skipping right over everything but Wicked Games. I'm glad that a decade later we get to see you getting the credit you deserve. From most people anyway. Looking at you, Grammys...
PLEASE I PRAISE HIM SO MUCH🛐 LIKE HIS MUSIC IS ✨AMAZING✨, HIS STYLE IS JUST *CHEF'S KISS*😩
I love listening to it live
AMOOOO ESSA MUSICAAA 🇧🇷
This is beautiful
Был здесь до ,🍋
His voice in amazing ✨🤩😁
love youuuu
Raiden detected
You are perfect, you are the best thing that has happened to me in life, I hope to meet you one day, My dream is to be able to be a singer like you, and to be able to meet you one day in person . I will probably die without meeting you in person but I will always carry you in my heart :'D
как всегда супер, бро!)
satanist!!!!
Amazing
Omg! 😭💓
But the clouds didn’t save the tears for another day !!
The way he makes keyboard notes in air. Imma crying 😭

Não consigo parar de escutar essa música, foda demais! 🥰🥰🥰🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
❤❤❤❤
YouTube needs to give me the option to like this video a million times. 👍 if you agree
I'm a old guy but I like this song it's got beat and with a great voice 'it's got everything 'I hate that rapping shit I could do it for fucks sake 'it reminds me of the oos or late 90s' if you ain't got the voice forget it
The dawn is coming 🙌💓!!!! Those vocals 💥💥💥💥
I'm so happy that there is another performance, I'm sad that he hasn't performed Escape From LA yet, I'm confused as to what that new uniform could mean for the next album.
And My beautifull Ariana💔😩
Me encanto 🥺🥺🥺
😍🔥
No song replace this song
መቼም ማይለውጥ ድምፅ!!!
Weeknd flexing what he learnt in piano class

The Weeknd is one of the only few artist that sound good live without autotune. GOAT!
Oneohtrix point never on the keys!
He's so awesome 💯🔥💥
My favourite for a reason ❤️✌🏻
Que música meus amigos, que música. 😍🇧🇷
He is the future King of Pop!
he is a black dude, with a white dude's hand. Is it weird? Am i weird?
I am Brazillian,music very good
Amazing 💜

It's a SHAME (for the scummy's) for not awarding him for this entire album. A shame the scummy's are racists and xenophobics. A SHAME. You earned it, The weeknd!
Que buena presentación nos dió the weeknd
❤️😍😍😍 TE AMOOOO 😍❤️
The Weeknd doesn’t need Grammys, he is the Grammys.
Abel ❤️😍❤️😍❤️🙋🏼‍♀️
Okkk this fits perfectly with Stranger Things' theme, the 80's synth
🏴‍☠️
Don't know how the keyboarder managed to make it through the whole song without breaking into a wild dance😂
he's so stable, wow
Queria tanto uma performance com a Ari
sheeeeeeeesh this song never get old  😍

From tuxedo to mushroom hat
Ariana remix
Gosh I love this man! Absolutely the best male singer since Michael Jackson. He could sing me the newspaper, and it doesn’t hurt that he’s fine as hell either!! I’m married but I’m not BLIND!
This is one of my favorite songs <3
este men si debio ganar el grammy ... lastima la verdad es sublime la cancion, no pasara de moda
The intro sounds like the Outro of tvd
It looks like Abel live from the otherside of Chromatica
AHHHHHHHHHHH

Jamiroquai?
Falto ariana grande :(

Marilyn Manson 🤘🏻🖤🖤🖤
Just Amazing!

Af sou apaixonada nesse cara
All of his live shows are hella good
the song is very beautiful ,i liked it a lot, you are very hadsome and i am your fan of you , i love your songs
Обожаю!
Man can sing the same song over and over again, rearranging, remixin, in  a stage, in a bridge, in an empty street, in a vacant room, with a full band, with a single dj or with a whole damn choir and orchestra,. And it'd still be as epic as ever.  Edit: he's singing with thunder and rain as his fuckin background, and its so damn good. HOW?!
👁️
grande el tio wikend
*ABEL I LOVE YOU! ❤*
Na atualidade esse é o melhor artista cantando ao vivo, o cara é muito afinado

AAH PERFEITO SÉRIO

Un ejemplo claro de la explotación en las mujeres por la industria. Destacamos la presentación de Dua Lipa con la de The Weeknd y vemos claramente lo que menciono
為什麼要一首歌拍好幾種版本呢？🤔
He's the best 😭😭
🐐
I am so proud of being a fan of this person ❤️
Best vocals!
We know what you did last summer haha
Me encanta esta canción
And Ariana???  would have been amazing...

This guy don't need any autotune 😌⚡
He looks cute lol he reminds me of the  main character from Little Nightmares
he looks like a fisherman
his finger dances...bye- he will be the death of me.
Highkey fan of the weeknd. He just sings so good and his songs are my cup of tea. I love blinding lights so much. And save your tears!!!😍😍😍😍😍
Espero que saque un videoclip de After Hours 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
That Piano doesn't belong there, the weeknd is so desperate to play it himself.
I thought Abel was gonna say... you'll float too 🤡🎈
Legend
Congratulations on winning the Brit awards 2021 ❤️❤️
The best I have seen today ❤️
I want to see the alive performance with the remix with Adriana Grande
He’s too cute🥺

This song gave me orange juice Jones walking in the rain vibes when I first heard it and then this performance with the rain/thunder confirms it 😎
You're the legend
The new opening trailer of 'Little Nightmares' looks great!
Wuuuaaaaaoooo! Lo hizo una vez más!!!! El hace lo simple, majestuoso!!! Solo voz talento no necesita exceso de producción solo el basta!!!

I love how uncoordinated and out of sync his air-synth skills are...  Gives it a fan appreciation feel for me. Like when people clap off beat but think they're doing it right...  Such confidence. Much wow.
Finally Weeknd changed his dress lol

So adorable ☺️ like paddington bear 🐻
Abelena ♥️
Perfect from start to finish! ❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Theres probably so many people banishing him on his outfit choice or that hes weird or lame for doing this. Forget those ppl this shows being different and creative you gotta really look into it to see the depth behind this imagery and the choice on why he chose this visual style.
me waiting for Ariana to pop out: 👁👄👁
Is he really made a plastic surgery?
YOU ARE UNIQUE!! I LOVE U SO MUCH!!!!! MY KING
The dislikes are from the Grammy's who couldn't save their tears
انت فنان كبير بنسبة لي للعرب نحبك أرجو أن اخينا ف نحنا ندعموك داءما  فلسطين حرة، morrocoooo+phlisteen#thanks bro#

This album was amazing
Porque está todo tapado? :,D es por culpa de todos los Bullys que se la pasan chingando por su cara?, :,D chale.
Quedo perfecto con el ambiente lluvioso...... 👌
I love that he is pretending to play the piano keys, I know many people don't like him but I enjoy his music and think he is very talented.
Amazing tune😋😋

New Skin Unlocked: Abel Raincoat

Future Legend guys.
Barões da Pisadinha tá diferente 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

Algún día me Gustaría conocerte Mi sueño es tener una foto contigo y si estaría en tu consierto lloraría con el alma en paz tranquilizada por tus canciones 💕
Vc sempre me surpreende!
Temaso😍😍😍👍👍
Pure perfection
Simplesmente incrível, em tudo que se propõe a fazer
the way he plays the notes with his hands is literally exactly how i do it when i listen to this song and that's why he's my favorite artist
🎧👌🥂👍🎤
just a beautiful song
I think its symbolic that he performs “Save Your Tears” in the rain. When i see that, i think of “Tears in the Rain”. Is it just me?
Perfeito
Algum BR vendo essa música pela 8849583828 vez?
Awsome 👌👌💯💯🎧🎧🤘
where is ariana?????
🤗🤗🤗😁😁😁
me encanta incluso mejor en vivo :3
This just slaps hard! I never thought that a 4-minute video can make me cry
this guy isn't even a real artist. he's just putting tons of autotune over terrible vocals, does a few moves that make him seem like a dude who escaped from an asylum to make him seem "special" but all in all he's just a terrible singer and musician.
🚀🚀🚀🚀🎤💣💥🇮🇹
grammy, cry me a river!
he look like Toad sometime
Ahhhhhh!!! Te amo abelito.
Goo
XO🤍
I LOVE THIS SONG SM. ON MY KNESS 🤤

Brit Awards: Okay Abel, we have a practically unlimited budget for you, we're thinking big this year! Weeknd:  I'll take a box... in the rain.
G.O.A.T
The history will never forget that the weeknd is nothing short than Michael Jackson
Ariana grande !!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
He’s a true disciple of MJ.. Proud of you man..!!  You deserve this and more too.. Damn he even talks like MJ.. “Help people, save them” ❤️ Heal the world

Hello fellow weeknd fan!:)

The GOAT
the weeknd finally getting the recognition he deserves
There no more tears to save
Que onda
Não foi o The Weeknd que perdeu o grammys, foi o grammys que perdeu o the weeknd ❤️
Ouuu girl
He looks like a modern day plague doctor missing the bird mask.
Perfect. ♥
perfeitinho em tudo que faz
That performance was legendary
👽👽👽
Ficou incrível meu amor 😍😍
ESPLÊNDIDO
An accurate representation of me singing save your tears in my room at 12:27am on a stormy night

Love it! His outfit says: cry me a river! Like the talented and gorgeous Marvin Gaye, all he has to do is stand on stage and sang! The Weeknd has it ALL!
MASTERPIECE
He is not the handsome squidward 🥺
I love the weekend since 2015 😭😭😭😔💔
🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹 so proud of you 👏🏽

I miss the red suit🥺
y aquí es donde me doy cuenta de que sigo a la persona correcta, tan sólo miren lo alto que ha llegado, el arte que hace y lo talentoso que es, sólo puedo decir que estoy demasiado orgullosa de Abel.   ese hombre es mi ídolo, AAAAAAA <3
I’m digging this Captain Ahab arc
Los sonidos
I 💘 Abel
Is this his first performance where he doesn't have the Red jacket? I'm guessing "After Hours" era is finally over. Ready for the next Era! 🙌
The visuals are crazy 🥵🥵
🔥🔥🔥✨✨✨✨
Soy muy fan😍😍😍😍😍✔️✔️✔️✔️😄😄😄😄🥺🥺🥺
The Weeknd just saved his talent for the BRIT Awards...
no more after hours character? :(
I love save ur tears I love all his songs!!! Also the remix was amazing! And the music video was so cool!!! Also the weeknd is a legend because even though my little bro is 2 he says for Halloween he wants to be the weeknd so can we just appreciate how big of a legend he is because even a 2 year old knows him like who wouldn’t want to know him!!! One last thing I really do hope to meet you (I’m also from Toronto lol) I’m a proud Canadian like the weeknd!!! Once again I hope to meet u u are a legend and save ur tears is a great song just like his other ones! Stay Safe!! 😷
look at that feeling !!
Awesome song iam morning breakup song ❤️ and motivation song ❤️
Thanks to Brit awards for giving such a performance of the weekend

🇧🇷 mais BR por aqui??
little weeknds
His voice is one of the rare ones in music industry, nowadays. Real talent.
The Weeknd is the greatest artist of this generation. He inspired every song I’ve ever made
Michelle Obama herself giving him a Brit has to more than make up for the Grammys.
Mah boyyy slaying 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cada performance dele eh um videoclipe diferente, CARALHO!!!!!!
Wow that was amazing!
the camera guy deserves a raise
Where's your suit?
Abel got that Raiden from Mortal Kombat aesthetic going on.
Thats a mortal Kombat suit talk about fatality  🤫

Me encantas the weekend que lastima que los grammys son unos vendidos y no conocen todo lo que eres saludos desde México
"Yeah I broke your heart like someone did to mine...and now you won't love me for a second time" That line hits hard and deep. I've had this song on one hour loop on repeat for weeks.....first song I've been able to do that without getting bored to it....driving my kids bonkers lol. Great voice, great song. 80's vibing. What separates him is his live voice is next level compared to his lip syncing peers.
This guy is so good😍😍
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾

Dude I feel sooo proud of his work.. After hours has been a really special album for me for some personal reasons. He's on another level right now compared to what's going on.. I don't even want to compare he's just unique.
The Weeknd no necesita de Premios Para Ser El Artista que es Punto.
i dont know if i just switch on the light or not euh
He needs to do the song live with ariana grande that would be so dope
this made my day😍
Overwhelmd by the possibility of a thunder falls down on him 😵😲
Beyond of what I expected!!
I LOVE , PERU
my 3 year old nephew when he wants me to play the after hours album, he says "I wanna sing I said ohhh". He calls the weeknd "I said ohh" 😂😭
tough performance.
This was better than the SB 🤣
Again 🥵💥💯
ariana calling in another room!
For once he’s not wearing the red suit 😜💜

Hat to hide the new haircut for a new projet ?
Lembrou Jamiroquai
I saw you dancing in a crowded room You look so happy when I’m not with you But then you saw me, caught you by surprise A single teardrop falling from your eye  I don’t know why I run away I’ll make you cry when I run away  You could’ve asked me why I broke your heart You could’ve told me that you fell apart But you walked past me Like I wasn’t there And just pretended like you didn’t care  I don’t know why I run away I’ll make you cry when I run away  Take me back because I want to stay Save your tears for another... Save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day  So I made you think that I would always stay I said some things that I should never say Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine And now you won’t love me for a second time  I don’t know why I run away, oh girl Said I’ll make you cry when I run away  Girl, take me back because I want to stay Save your tears for another... I realize that I’m much too late And you deserve someone better Save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day  I don’t know why I run away I’ll make you cry when I run away  Save your tears for another day, oh girl Said save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day
the best of all time ✌️

Lyrics (save your tears) I saw you dancing in a crowded room you look so happy when I'm not with you but then you saw me caught you by surprise a single tear drop fallen from your eye   I don't know why I run away  I make you cry when i run away You could've asked me why I broke your your heart You could've told me that you fell apart But you walk past me like I wasn't there  And just pretend that like you didn't care I don't know why I run away  I make u cry when I run away Take me back because I wanna stay and save your tears for another. Save your tears for another day.  Huh what made u think that I would always stay I say some things that u should never say Yeah I broke your heart like someone did to mine And now you won't love me for a second time.  I don't know why I run away I make you cry when I run away Girl take me back because I wanna stay. Save your tears for another. I realise that I am much too late But you deserve someone better. Save your tears for another day I said save your tears for another daaaay.  Save your tears for another day x2  The end Thank me later 😊

People who disliked are actually people who have their phones upside down
Grammy is no longer valid after their injustice to Abel
I know what you did last summer ;)

Hello everyone I know that you are all here for Abel's music that we all love so much But can I take a moment of your time To tell you about what happens now in Palestine  The occupation army violated all international and humanitarian laws  The occupation army attacked the worshipers during their prayers in the square and the worshipers inside Al-Aqsa Mosque attacked children, women, the elderly and youth in the streets with bombs and rubber bullets  The occupation army brutally attacks the girls and the whole world is looking silently  The occupation army turned Al-Aqsa into a battlefield  The Palestinians resist the terror of the armed occupation with their own bodies only  The terrorist army attacked the Red Crescent field hospitals and prevented ambulances from entering to treat the injured  The terrorist army is displacing 500 Palestinians from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood  The occupation army attacks the residents of the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood every day, forcibly removing them from their homes  The settlers are provoking the residents of Sheikh Jarrah every day, because they will steal their homes and no one will stop them  The Terror Army arrested children, adults and women only because they prayed to Al Aqsa or stood in solidarity with the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood  Children disappear after the occupation attack on worshipers, and no one knows anything about them  The Palestinians are being repressed now in Jerusalem and the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood and  Facebook and Instagram are also suppressing them and the summit of all those in solidarity with them by deleting the solidarity pages or suspending them for hours and deleting all publications documenting the terror of the occupation, and they delete any post containing words such as Palestine   The Israeli army is an army of terror, an army of occupation  Now the question is for heads of states , what would you do if a stupid person took you out of your house?  🇵🇸 #انقذوا_حي_الشيخ_جراح 🇬🇧 #Save_SheikhJarrah_neighborhood 🇺🇸 #savesheikhjarrah  🇷🇺 #Спасти_район_ШейхДжарра  🇹🇷 #ŞeyhJarrah_mahallesini_kurtar  🇩🇪 #Siehe_SheikhJarrah_Nachbarschaft  🇫🇷 #Sauver_le_quartier_de_SheikhJarrah 🇪🇦 #Salva_el_barrio_de_SheikhJarrah 🇮🇹 #Salva_il_quartiere_di_SheikhJarrah Please share this message to the world Help them to make their voices heard

More The Weeknd + Oneohtrix Point Never's bromance is what the world needs.
will say his performances since the pandemic have been creative af
perfect 🔥❤❤
I think rain is considered the huge problem going out in the world and that box is our mentality which has become kind of rigid but he tells us to get out of it  with our and help out people in the world how ever we could  Edit : rain coat is essential to us and to other with which we can help...lightning is the problem in the the world
Esta cancióna escucho todos los días😍 me hubiera encantado ver a Ariana cantar con él, pero ya será en otra ocasión.
Wonderful! The sun is coming!

He's performing "save your tears" while it's raining and even steps out in the rain. Could this be a reference to "tears in the rain" ?

Did anybody realize that the first thunder noise was from the video game in roblox called “survive and kill the killers in Area 51”?
You’re a horror fan when The Weeknd is giving you “I Know What You Did Last Summer” vibes LMAOO
FIRST
Early, lets gooooo. Well, 16 minutes early
Hope he never quits music, it's like therapy
I WISH I COULD SEE A LIVE PERFORMANCE OF 'HURT YOU'.

Omfg his hat is a boat
I think this man officially became my favorite singer
arrasou abel.
Fun fact, the character in the red suit that "After Hours" follows isn't Abel, he's been waiting here in raingear for the past few years between this and Starboy. He's lurking, always waiting... maybe 🃏♣️♦️♠️♥️
CANTA PRA UM CARALHO PQP!!!!!!! AMO ♡♡

so this is what he posted that picture in the raincoat on instagram for
i Love you Abel ❤😍
King 👑❤️ love you
I Know What You Did Last Weeknd
Abel mi vida ❤
🖤YES
Abel, I have 3 words for you.  You are amazing.   You are literally the god of music in this generation (and I don’t care what anyone has to say, it’s true as hell.) The storyline of After Hours was amazing, exciting and new. You already have a ton of recognition and followers, but in my opinion, you still deserve more. You clearly put in a ton of effort, and it pays off, because you always end up making more and more bangers. You deserve the world. Your music has kept me going when i feel down, just end up jamming to it. You are inspirational. I respect the hell out of you, and you deserve every little bit of good you have. Love ya man.
Very good
*blessed ears twerking*
You make me cry every time you sing 🥲❤️
idk why…. I run away
So this is what it’s like to be early to a video

why are you reading this comment it literally has NO point whatsoever yet you STILL are reading it. you’re really still reading this.. just because it’s a longer comment than the ones you typically see? honestly, you must be SOOOO bored. out of all the comments in this comment section you chose to read this ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS comment. this comment has no point, therefore it is pointless. no point. unless.. the point is to have no point. MIND. BLOWN. actually you know what? you made it this far. you should’ve taken this time to go drink water and eat something. it’s not too late. 💧 GO HYDRATE!!!!!
