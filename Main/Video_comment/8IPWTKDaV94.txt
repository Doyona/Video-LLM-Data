Mad flavor with those stick potatoes.yrah secret ground beef spaghetti sauce.
Nah tht ain’t no garbage plate bruh
If you’re wondering if this gross looking dish tastes any good, I swear by it. The most delicious thing you’ll ever eat!!!
When guys cook, there's so much slamming, tossing, throwing down, squirting. Guess they think it's macho. 🙄
Lol love how music (Green onion) stops when he slams the onion 😅
Jenna Marbles would be proud 😂
Oscar the Grouch’s favourite food!
Garbage plate huh? So it’s you on a plate???
Spread the good word brother.
Ah Rachacha seeing you on center stage warms this Buffalonians WNY heart.
I love how he says homemade mac salad then pulls out maxilla from Wegmans
In Indiana a garbage plate is a breakfast meal and is noting like this
Bro someone needs to start selling fast food brand fries.. 99% of homemade one blow ass and are soggy 2 seconds after you take them out the oil
I mean the meat hot needs a little work need some cinnamon and clove and a bunch of other spices but for a super quick sauce it’s ok
This is probably the worst thing you’ve ever recorded
This looks like shit and you hold your fork like a troglodyte. Did you grow up in the ghetto?
Love how people think they inventing something with this whole garbage plate bullshit going around
No your just stoned.
Give props to the original
Looks more like a fat man’s dream meal 🤮
I'm embarrassed for you man
Naw .. Naw Bro … Mac Salad ..  naw that’s Not Life at all
Mac salad, home fries, two cheese burger patties, onions and extra extra spicy meat sauce.

Nick Tahoe's Rochester N.Y the OG of the garbage plate ... Going to get one now 🤯
A garbage plate in my home is left overs. But like left overs that go together. Like pizza and broccoli Alfredo noodles. Or mashed potatoes and lasagna. Orrrrrrrr yeah just left overs in one plate. I'm not sure the exact definition.
Them fries gonna be mighty cold
The name fits.
Try that same thing with a green goddess dressing…!

You must not be from the ROC.  Rochester, NY home of the garbage plate.
Rochester New York stand up. Home of the garbage plate but you didn't do that thang right
We call that Stoner Food
Yeah made for the garbage can alright.
"So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
Instead of water use beef broth

You really brought out the whiskey ice balls for fries 😭 🤦‍♂️
That's a high ass plate
What are you doing with the fries?? once on 150-160degree for like 3,4min,let them dry a bit and than 180degree for 5,6min ;). Not french fries,but fries and it’s invented in belgium and here we know how to make them.. Because in france,uk,spain,germany,... it’s a waste of potatoes.. In belgium you will find the best you ever ate ;) 😜
I mean, executed decent but it's not a garbage plate unless it's from the old guy at Tahous.
Those fires need time in the water to cook right
Garbage plates, garbage bread… I’m glad that Garbage is mainstream Again.
Hangover food
S/O Rochester NY!
Stupid

😖
Product placement as its best.
A hour and you cooked the fries first???
I swear I could eat these types of food forever  than that high class shit

"Smallest American food"
Weggies Mac salad to make it authentic
That Wegmans mac salad just put it over the top… 😂
Shout out to upstate and central New York home of the garbage plate believe it
Hold the mac, that store bought shit gives you more bubble guts than that whole plate.
It originated in Rochester, NY where I’m from. So good man. I always got cheese burger on beans and fries. Spicy meat sauce on top of everything is a must, along with onions. Never been a big fan of mixing with the Mac salad
Nasty
Just come to Rochester ny to get a good plate
Foh
As i just ate a big meal, this looks disgusting. But I'm sure that when I'm hungry it'd look really appetizing
An American tradition
this is what I take home after a birthday party in a third world country
What you call a plate of garbage I call I Michelin star meal
Bro Only good thing about Rochester garbage plates and bill grays
Bro you have the most annoying face known to man.

Never trust a cook that can't cut an onion lol
If it’s just one of those days, I’d consume this
I prefer the plate with gravy   I wonder how many people outside of western New York have no clue what this is
Why did you shock the potatoes first?
What that fuck???
Is it burnt? Did you drop it in dirt?
Bro you're garbage. Give up on life
A Rochester staple! Great video
Was that ice death stars?
That's a New York sewer 😂🤣😂
MARKIPLIER?
What is that slicer thing?
Gross
I live like 20 mins away from the maker of the first garbage plate in upstate NY. I grew up eating these unhealthy tasty things. But where you screwed up big time is the fry's my guy... They r supposed to be little cubes. Other than that gg.
Where's the coleslaw? Where's the sauerkrout? Beans?   Thanks for the garbage plate representation, just not the NY variety. It's been my favourite cheap meal that lasts two days since emigrating from Ireland.
That's what the inside of my toilet looks like after eating taco bell.
Love the song
American poutine
Lost me at macaroni salad.
Home made grocery store salad
Tell me you're either pretentious or an alcoholic without saying it: ice spheres instead of ice cubes.
Diabetes
We just call that a refry, or a fry up here in NZ
The gadget he used for the onion what was that

Best garbage plate is at Jimmy Zs in Brockport NY
Jeez you can’t cook for shit
Rochester NY staple...Nick Tahoes restaurant still makes the best!!
My version of trash that I’ve been making for a while is hash browns, bacon, and cheese
Could atleast mention the a actual garbage plate restaurant instead of stealing the idea...
I really appreciate when "chefs" using mandolin to slice onion. Lol😂
stay out of the kitchen
Probably the best part about Rochester over here besides the music
To be fair anything this man makes could be called a garbage plate
Yo where did the doors goooo
looks like a food challenge from regular show
Why'd the music stop halfway? This is a garbage video!
🤢🤮😵‍💫😵
Fuck you mean garbage that looks good as hell
One mans trash is another mans treasure
Lost me a macaroni salad. 🤢
This man is trying to pass off Wegmans Mac salad as homemade. TO BE HONEST IT DOES TASTE HOME MADE THO
That looks fucking disgusting
What was the fancy ice for
"this would be great for a hangover" I thought to myself, before he so rudely interrupted me saying he's not even hungover.
That small leaf on top of all that garbage tho 🤣
Best way to make fries is to fry it once for 1-2 minutes, then spread them out on a wire rack to let them cool before tossing them into a freezer bag and freezing them. The single fry + freezing really draws out the moisture, plus you have single-fried fries that you can quickly fry anytime you want fries. Crispiest motherfuckers you'll ever make, plus it's more convenient to freeze a large batch so you can make fries whenever you want.
A fellow Rochester goblin, noice
Quite ironic that there were no green onions used
I Will never understand the American taste of food
Love your vids and not tryna be mean........................................................ where da moosic go?
Sure looked like a steaming “country pancake”
“not even hungover and that is insane” hahahahha
Ngl that not good lookin garbage plate but I still eat the hell outta that
Your mustache is garbage
That right there is Disrespect to a Real Garbage plate#SteveT’s
If you use chili and mac and cheese this would make it better
Nice I think I seen it on travel channel once

It’s so cool to see other people liking garbage plates. I live in Rochester where it originated and we go to a certain restaurant here called Charlie reidels  and in my opinion it’s the best there is

Kinda bruh moment when the music stopped but the food look good tho.
Looks like something I would love drunk
The heart attack 2.0
ppl who call mac and cheese “mac” seriously piss me off
What’s the point of taking time to cut out the shape of fries if they’re put at the bottom and not a side? At that point just save time and plop some mash instead
Omg it's the skate 3 music
Lets go
That looks like garbage
A garbage plate to go with the garbage video.
Trash
I like how u stop the music halfway trough the vid its nice

When I hear the beat I feel like he’s about to get away with a crime
Looks fucking disgusting.

You better be disrespecting the seed oil with your fry oil and Mac salad
Missing the pork and beans. Rochester NY original
Not sure if it was intentional, but I find it hilarious that the song literally called “Green Onions” ended as soon as he ‘killed’ (chopped) the onion
OK I come from the city the garbage plate was created. Way to much work your putting in
Nasty 🤮
A very appropriate food to usa people
That garbage looks delicious 😋
This is just weird loco moco
Merica

Waiter: "And what would you like tonight sir?"  Diner: "I couldn't give a f**k, whatever you've got in the kitchen just chuck it on a plate."
This man used ice globes to destarch his fries…
That's a big pile of shit!!
Tell me you have money without saying you have money “ice spheres” 😭😭😭

Nick Tahou Hots, Rochester, NY!!!!!
ROC-CITY, ROCHESTER NEWYORK- NICK TAHOE’s. Restaurant *
Waffle House  hash “all the way”
Bro this is an old recipe.  It's called a mud bowl.  What the hell is a garbage plate?
Ah yes Jenna Marbles favorite dish
Where is your stale bread?!🫣😒🙄
Looks like you'll be sent straight to the bathroom.
You had me until mustard.
More people need to use Green Onions in the background
Why didn’t you peel the potatoes…
Bruh I get not peeling potatoes but at least get the dirt off with a brush 💀
jennamarbles introduced me to this dish and now i so desperately want this
This does look like garbage
Honestly so garbage, bro. Respectfully
Garbage plate ? Umm now I really feel poor . Dat looks like ah 5 star meal to me
Like a poor man's poutine
That lil leaf gives helth.😉
I personally like the breakfast garbage plate
I woulda done the fries last...
Lmao weggos is still homemade
Correct, a plate of garbage
Ya know I’ve never had a garbage plate, should’ve went out for one when I was upstate NY
Yeaaaaaa, garbage plate.
That’s pretty disgusting 🤢 🤮
He's must be so baked to make this
So good. I might just have to make some.
That has the perfect title!
Did he just use cheese sticks?
Ever since I heard Jenna marbles talk about this literal AGES AGO I've wanted to try and make one of these. Never had it, but it looks so mouthwatering
I love how he uses no herpes or spices at all, so you know you have got that bland middle western USA flavor that reminds one of steamed shoe lace.
Home made Mac salad… hahaha
Disgusting
True name is an amalgamation
I got to be honest that doesn't look too good
I'm not even hungover  I'm just stoned
The only difference between a real garbage plate and yours is that they use potatoes in squares like home fries   which soaks up the grease better
Its more a heartattack plate if you ask me, jesus christ! If my dad ate that he wouldnt have had his heart attack at age 62 but age 40!
Speaking of onions, what happened to the song "Green Onions"?
An egg
Oh fuck i wanna try this. It looks amazing
What does the ice do for the fries
You absolutely ruined those ingredients when you added buffalo and water. Also your homade Mac salad came out of king Soopers brand container and looked like the Mac salad they have at King Soopers. No garbage for me
No one fucking peels potato skins on YouTube
Diarrhea
Wash those 🥔 tho
Dude wtf, spray tan?
The store Mac salad
🤮🤮🤮
Nope
Next time you get blazed and get the munchies.... don't make a video.
You will be regretting this meal.....your stomach will never forgive you 🤣🤣🤣
Needs avacado!!!!!
You mean drunk LOL but yeah good hanger food too🤣🤷‍♀️
Wrong I'm from 585 you messed up a lot of steps
I’ll eat that if I’m drunk
The skate background music 🎶
All that work for trash.
Looks like some pretty gnarly chili cheese fries to me.
I've had them on a few occasions. It's been years though because it's not even a little healthy.
Looked great till you pulled out the Mac salad.
Ur gonna simmer hamburger meat for an hour but buy plastic cheese? U got your priorities backwards
Yeah don’t fry the fries too hard and I would love this
Didn’t even use green onions while playing the song green onions???
Heart failure waiting to happen, Lol!  But it looks so good and I'm ready with my fork and spoon.  😁😁😁
Disgusting
This is Jenna Marbles favorite meal ! She had a video making it and eating it ..or Julien making it. I knew this looked all too familiar lol
Not hungover but he is definitely high!
The same thing but with baked beans…oh yea! I do mine with a roasted tri tip chopped up…so good! Mac salad & baked beans is sooooooo goooood!
Wow the music choice caught me off gaurd, crazy for once not hearing the same 5 overplayed edm/pop songs people use...
Reminds me of the Velveeta, hot links and no bean chili I throw together once a year.
It definitely looked like garbage...  So... Congratulations I guess.
“Homemade Mac salad” proceeds to dump it from a name brand container. Uh ok 😂
Remember always fry ur fries twice
This is like if someone had only ever heard of poutine and tried to replicate it and then went overboard adding stuff.
I had my first garage plate 2 years ago in Rochester. Soooo gooodddddd!
This does look really good but, he made these beautiful french fries that were so crispy-absolute perfect and then he completed covers them which makes them soggy! Am I being blasphemous if I asked would it be possible to put the fries on top?
Garbage plate.. lol. Isn't that all of your videos
I am not grown up enough to like this
I grew in Rochester NY I know all bout em
Shit actually looks fire
Who thought of this

“Homemade Mac salad” scraping it out of store bought container 🤣🤣🤣

"Label says home made" I didn't say I made it
I feel like Gordon would say something like, "Garbage Plate? Not even the garbage will take that!" Idk y
A Rochester classic.
Disgusting
Omg that sounds so g
🤮
As a person that doesn’t eat fancy foods and eat stuff like this I’m interested
I didn't think you were hungover UNTIL you said "I'm not even hungover."
Nigga got the wegmans Mac salad. Garbage plates are so fucking good! Recommend going to Mac’s philly steaks and getting a philly plate!
Dont add water..
Garbage Plate ughhh i instantly thought of Jenna marbles ;-;
That's the most delicious-looking garbage I've ever seen.
I’m surprised he didn’t dry age the whole plate

It won't make a turd.... but it sure as hell will push one out
Bro this and a Genny Cream will get you through anything

Any fool is a  cook now. Very annoying, who wants to make that crap.
That was originated in my home town and I think you did a pretty great job making that dish. 4stars out of five⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
What was tht song, reminds me of my GPA
Dated a guy who was from Rochester and while visiting family he just HAD to get me to try one. Let me tell you, garbage plates are sent straight from the heavens!
Yo is that Wegmans Mac salad? Stuff is basically good enough to be homemade
Why he hold fork like that🤔
Bubble guts coming soon
The home fries are supposed to come from a pile on the side of the grill like it was at Nick Tahous!
I'd eat that!!!

Да нам вообще похуй

I love the foods of western NY. I wish  I was could still eat them and not gain 50lbs like when I was young.
585 born and raised outside of Rochester NY  Nick tahou's inventor of the garbage plate
Disgusting
It looks good, but if I was hungover I’d be projectile vomiting just from the smell.
It's home fries not fries. And you forgot to add the Frank's red hot to the top. From Rochester NY.
I thought this was gonna be poutine
That’s not a garbage plate. Fucking disgrace. Btw it’s not a hangover food, it’s a drunk food.
All the calories you need inna day plus more all on one plate
Finally someone make a garbage plate
I’m not even hungover and that is insane? Wait you actually wanna eat when your’re hungover ? What you drink white claw?
Brosky is gonna get really bad food poisoning yikes that is some scary cross contamination shyt going on

Why the frys so small
Wait I'm sort of confused about how you say I'm not even hungover and it's good you must have not been hungover before cuz to be honest if you put that in front of me if I was hungover I would throw up all over it....now maybe if I was super stoned and had the munchies I would be like hell yeah let's try that s***.....lol
Actual no offense, but my brain was so dumb.  At the end : "looks like garbage" *remembers name*
I need me one of those🤤
It was all good till he said mac salad he should of just made it mac and cheese

Booker T. and the MG’s 😫
Looks like somebody took a shit.
I can feel my arteries clogging looking at that but that looks so good
Yeah this belongs in the garbage.

That is a disgusting pile of crap that only a college student drunk and baked out of his mind at 3 AM on Saturday could appreciate.  It’s missing kimchi, salmon and pizza.

That's fuckin disgusting my man.
I refuse to come home drunk and not have snacks in the house. I came home one night and made something, what it was I don't know. It had cottage cheese in a carton (they don't sell cottage cheese in cartons, guess what it was) green furry rye bread,  braunschweiger which I hate and I ate a whole box of Little Debbie cupcakes.
Rochester cuisine is 🔥
gross
Representing for Rochester, ok, I see you.
Looks delicious
I feel sick just watching
"Homemade Mac salad"  *shows Wegmans container*

585 if you know you know
“WATER”
Trash
Eww
Pretty close but you gotta double the portion put it in styrofoam and eat half a tub of pickles waiting for it to come out
Garbage is just a bunch of breakfast items thrown in a pan cooked together, it should be made in one pan and the most other utensils you should need is maybe a knife and cutting board, throw all the meat in the pan and cook it, throw the veggies in and saute them, then throw the eggs in and cook the eggs, congratulations you have garbage, literally the least fancy thing you could possibly make.
Why is it called garbage plate
As a native Rochesterian, at least you tried.
Raw meat and veg on the same board??? Absolutely not
Sorry to hear that y’all have such shitty food in Rochester lmao
Forgot the gravy
That ain't garbage that's dirty fries
Pinchi comida culera xD
Garbage plate is the perfect name for this grabage.

You need to visit Nick Tahous in Rochester, NY to get an idea as to the original garbage plate. There definitely is not any Buffalo sauce involved at all.
What mandolin is that?
You made it wrong. It’s supposed to be served on a paper plate.
Average americans meal
Aaaayyyeeee 585 baby
Correct me if I'm wrong but, there is a place in ny that specializes in this stuff and its amazing
A true American Dish...id actually eat....all of that🖤👅

Everything touching is fucking me up, it all tasted like shit because it had eachother flavors on it

Rochester babbbeeee
The song is called green onions i preformed it at my jazz concert epic
But what does guy fieri think ?
I was told not to eat junk food but DANG
That was funny we all know you got that macaroni salad from tops

Green onions love that song
Bad boys get put in a pear wiggler

Nice try
This is a hangover meal if I’ve ever seen one
Crispier fries brother
The only thing missing is the 🪴you 💨 before you ate that 😂😂😂
Be great without the macaroni salad 🤢
this doesn't seem like the type of dish to put a bay leaf on top of but it still looks good
Lol I love this song and I bet most people don't know the name of it
I'm high and this looks bomb ASF 😂
Good God what hell spawned trailer park did this s*** crawl out from under?

Home made by the people at the grocery store
Its not garbage, its a masterpiece
Watching this made me take a second shit.
This my buddy but with a little extra care
716 > 585

YELLOW MUSTARD?!?!    fuck yea def garbage🤮
THAT, just looks like a heart attack on a plate.

I took a fat dump just watching this
Good food doesn't need to look good best food you'll eat I stg will be at a shitty looking food cart in Portland
Water? No.
….yea no…you’re the real garbage
I don’t trust people that don’t peel potatoes
Never trust a cook who uses a guard on a mandoline… especially one that uses the very same to chop an onion… 🙄🙄
it's a staple in Rochester NY
Yeah no ill pass🤮🤮
That's great Rochester Ny invention! Nick Tahoe invented it!
mf even made the water look dry 💀

Onions are legit one of the most underrated ingredients there is
That Mac salad is a no for me dawg.
*WATER*
Looks like the my 600 lb life special
My mother is from Rochester no a fan, but thanks for sharing only ate it once didn't like prefer nyc cuisine
My family calls it heart attack fries
🥲
Become Nikado avocado any % speed run
I love food that can be cooked in a couple of minutes, everyone should know at least a couple things to cook by themselves like thse
Lost me at water
New Yorkers: *takes a bunch of leftovers and tosses them on a plate, a thing that everyone has been doing all over the country for a hundred fuckin years*  Also New Yorkers: "IT'S CALLED A GOIBAGE PLATE. IT'S A NEW YORK THINK YOU WOULDN'T UNDASTAIND. EEEEH I'M WALKIN HEYUH."
I never thought I'd feel flexed on by the shape of ice used to rinse French fries.
My biggest gripe is the meat sauce. Never in my life have I seen it made with red hot and water lol
This kinda food porn should be illegal
This is the type of shit I make when my ma doesn't say anything specific when she says "make dinner"
Buffalo cheeseburger poutine
America on a plate with added in laziness(bustard cannae cut onions man)🤦🏽‍♂️ horrendous
Do it's cousin, greek fries
Aww i remember jenna marbles used to make this
Thank you for cutting off green onions right when you cut the onion 🧅 🔪
That looks good, but in my opinion. No need to add water
The "im not even hungover "
Its a white mans carne asada fries 👍

Americans

The brown on those potatoes is MUD. YOU LITERALLY HAVE DIRT ON YOUR POTATOES. YOU’RE EATING DIRT !
Yes this is garbage
The only thing trashy about this is that I can't eat it
I got diarrhea just from watching this.
A rochester / webster ny special
Nothing makes me hungrier than someone throwing my food onto the plate like so much trash. It’s not cool or macho, it’s just unappetising. Grow up!
Unfocused shot, cmon man.
Only weiners use a holder for your mandolin slicee
Ah Rochester. Home to the Garbage Plate. Garbage plate for a garbage city. Stay classy, Rochester.
Home made trash 🤢🤮🤮🤮
Ill take 2

This is definitely comfort food
Those fries are drier than this comment
bro had to state he wasn’t hungover lmao
I was on board with it until you added mustard on top at the end. You fucked it up.
We used to call staff meal at a place I worked at garbage plates, since we used to re-heat leftovers from weekend buffets throughout the week
God is with you all godbless and your families and everyone in the world amen 🙏
Heres the Gospel of Jesus *if you're interested* All people have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. The penalty for our sin is death. But Jesus came to Earth, lived a perfect life, died, and was resurrected to pay the penalty for our sins! Repent and have faith in Him💗.
Tbh I understand the joke but uh that potato still got the skin on it :(
Washing the potatoes after cutting? That also without peeling ?  🤨
I love seeing my hometown of Rochester being appreciated.
The last frame of his face has the stench of shame eating on it and it's hilarious
Mandelin amazon link please??
me: oh shit that looks pretty good him: this right here is a garbage plate :)  bro broke my heart right there
Should have used “green onions” lol
I feel like I baked a version of this while working in the cafeteria in high school but it included chips and some other stuff I cant remember but think of a bunch of junk food a stoner would buy and bake it into some cookies
The kinda shit I be making when I’m high and I be feeling like Gordon Ramsay
"This right here is a garbage plate" You can say that again pal
I can't lie it looks tasty.
They used that same music in sandlot
trash ❤️
Was good until the mustard 💀
No zweigles no care!.. do it right
The shit look bussin
Sooo....anytime you are out of  buns.....it's a garbage plate?
That should be called America on a plate
Well it will make your stomach a diabetes dump
Is there a reason why Americans never peel potatoes? All the dirt and mud goes in
I never thought that post malone could cook!
Now I see why I haven't subscribed to your channel !
So are you going to give me some dude ??????
You must be from upstate NY. Tradition! Let theme know you forgot to tell em’ about the zweiglers hots.Yum!!!
In what sense is macaroni and cheese a salad?
Bruh I just noticed he kinda looks like Nolan arenado
Surprised he didn’t use any flakey salt
That’s a plate of diabetes
Anyone else know this music from “Sandlot”?
WATER😂
As someone from Rochester, NY (where the garbage plate was created) I appreciate this!
Im from rochester we loved late night garbage plates
That looks like a plate of delicious garbage
I haven't had garbage in years the last time i had it was when my grandfather taught me how to make it and it was amazing.
Ewww
Wheres the green onions?
That meat hot recipe is weak
I live in Rochester NY home of the garbage plate
Love when people use forks like spoons
I can see raccoons making the gesture pacha did in the emperor’s new groove. “When garbage is made just right…” 🖐😌👌
What’s that you used to slice up the onion?
It blows my mind that this clown has followers. Everything he makes looks nasty
That complete dish is very unhealthy. You Americans love to fri everything. You learn to grill more and avoid putting sources on your food, like maionase, mustard, etc. Learn to add veggies or salads on the side. Peace ✌️🕊️ 🇦🇴🇦🇴🇦🇴🇦🇴
Not garbeg it's liftovers
I had an experience with some like gumbo pasta that Darrin brought Me. It was delicious. I could even taste the pan seasoning in the noodles. I was wondering where He got the New Orleans gumbo pasta.....
That truly belongs in the garbage
Take Potassium cyanide.  Same effect, much faster and less gross
That actually looks good
I found Markipliers lost twin
Green onions Booker T
Those fries look hard as hell lol
Ok now send me that like idk deal it up or something I neeeed

As a Rochester native... Yeah no that's far too bougie
Dibeaties

Okay but I could never eat something with mac salad, mustard, buffalo, and water on it
That meat hot sauce isnt right its supposed to get garlic powder cayenne all spice cumin crushed red pepper

This right here is bullshit
Skate 1 menu theme!
I am laughing my ass of by the fact you put a basil leaf on top of *that*
Dam, that garbage tastes like trash

Rochester gang
No wonder why he put 2ice *balls*
No one gonna talk about those round ice cubes….just me ? Ok

You're supposed to mix everything together before you take a bite
That looks greasy and not appealing to me to be honest.
Fries sound dry as fuck
That looks so disgusting.  Yuck

I know this dude be high especially with this mixture 🤣🤣🤣
Probably a Dumb ? But what's that slide chopper thing called?
This is bill grays

Anything with processed cheese is a plate of garbage
Delicious
Green Onions by Booker T. & The MGs quit playing when he cut the onion.

Never seen homemade salad out of a container like that 😂
Most american thing i have ever seen
I was down until that psychedelic yellow mustard. 🤮
Heheh.. Merca'!!!
Get rid of those anemic looking sausages.  Also add a touch of vinegar, sugar and salt to the fries bath water. Only a touch though as they soak up flavouring. Makes them taste better than mc d's
More like heaven plate this shit look bussin ngl
Yeah just put in back in the garbage
Now that's my type of meal
High snack if if I've ever seen one 😅
Mac salad? You definitely do not know what a salad is!
Homemade mac salad *pours out of store bought container*
I forgot Jack had a kitchen w all the recent outdoor vids
It's  weird to watch an Underbite eat. Gross
Americans have a very weird taste for Food sometimes..
Does anyone recognise the Garbage plate because of Great Big Story?
Absolutely       Disgusting
If someone tries to make this from this video they are going to burn themselves so bad putting wet potatoes in hot oil
Ruined with mustard
Yeah no that's not a garbage plate, this is a boogie failure

Man all I could think about was skate 3s theme song
Rookie mistake... SEASON BOTH SIDES OF YOUR PATTY... (line cook/chef here... good luck eating your bland beef without proper seasoning! DOESNT MATTER WHAT THE CONTEXT OF THE DISH IS, SEASON EVERYTHING BOTH SIDES EVERY PLATE EVERY DISH. NO EXCUSES. DO THIS AND YOUR PLATE WILL LITERALLY SING!)
Looks fire to me
This is real man food
Thank you for this, you have been Roc approved 👏🏻
Gotta give credit too the creator of the garbage plate in NYC!
Who is have the time to cook these meals to when hung over

5 year old me thinking if I combine all my favorite food together, it would taste great
I remember when big story made a video on this it looked so good I almost wet my sidewalk bench
Deluxe chilly fries
Only reason I wanna go to new York
Looks awfull
I am from New York and this only has been a new york thing if you go anywhere else they will look at you crazy. But this video just might take the food industry out there considering it's only a new york thing especially the white hots
There’s nothing more American than calling cold mac and cheese a “salad”
You said it mate. That’s a garbage plate.
Heartburn plain and simple 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You forgot the ketchup and diced raw onions
Stoner munchies in full effect!
The song playing is Booker T - Green onion. A masterpiece

"Looks like the insides of my grandpa's colostomy bag"  -Gordon Ramsay

Garbage plate - garbage video  How fitting 🤣🤣
You do need to be stoned to your conkers for this sort of thing.
He looks like he's gonna puke at the end, why does he put mustard on the entire thing afterwards? I love mustard and wouldn't even do that.
We all know that mac salad is from albertsons..
American culture cooking 😂
🤢🤮

I moved from Rochester to Texas about 2 years ago... God I miss garbage plates, and to think most people will never even know 🐻
Good name fits the look
Looks like Shit Salad

Rochester classic
What are those chopping tools i would like to know
More like a plate of diabetes
I know a woman form Rochester NY would be proud seeing this while sitting on her couch wearing leisure suit, sipping on her wine with crying dog noises in the background
And not a single green onion on the plate, sad…
Should have platted it with a paper plate for the real authentic garbage eating experience lol
It's not supposed to look good🔥🔥
What’s the song?
the song is green onions by Booker T and the MGS
Not bad
Throw some spinach on that shit and I’d get down every morning.
“Homemade” my dude you got that from wegmans it does smack tho and I knew you were from wny
I guess it belongs in a trash can.

Fake ass garbage plate
S tier song choice
is this guy from a pokemon?
WNY bro right here
Yeahh roc city dish
I've never seen such an unappetizing dish look so appetizing. Crazy how amazing you make these look.
I like how he uses a grater to slice the onions, but uses his bare hands to flatten the meat in the pan.
Gotta add the fresh chopped onion on top! Where are you from? It's driving me nuts I know your close to Rochester but where?!
Amazing
Nice cook, Ash.
Should change the name to a shit plate
You lost me at the onions 🥲🥲
Idk what looks worse the plate or his sad excuse of a mustache
No he didn’t drop it in the garbage, grown up! 👀
Actually looks pretty good man
ngl i'd try it without the mustard
I know the song is Green Onions but you didn't have to completely and awkwardly cut it out once you got to the actual onions, Jack.
But where is that ketchup my guy?
I see you tryna flex with the ice spheres
Nick Tahoe’s VS Stevie Ts
This made me think of Jenna Marbles…😢
Rochester finest lol
Shit plate. Shit W people cook when their not on TikTok plate.
420 plate
You need to visit Rochester NY and hit Nick Tahou’s downtown for the real deal.  You’re not even close buddy.  BTW - there’s better recipe for the meat sauce online..  nothing close to sitting in the restaurant and eating it at 2:30 am.  Just make sure you sit on the college kids side because you are not even close to a townie. lol
Rochester must be stopped 😦
Love how the music stops when he cuts the onion ( song is called green onion for those who don’t know)
peeling the potato, ow iguess americans dont do that
It's so extra to use spherical ice for a potato ice bath and I love it
But it wasn’t raw! Remember all this channel is about is raw meat! Remember!
Fries look fucked mate
Man’s meal 🥘
I wanna shit myself
Jenna marbles intensifies
Anybody ever thought that jack and acooknamedmatt could be brothers?
Rochester New Yoorrkkk
You cocky SOB wit those ice spheres🥶🥶🥶
The rest of the food is okay, but that fucking Mac salad, I don’t mind the taste nor eating it, but it gives me fucking massive heart burn and causes my stomach to not feel good in comparison to the rest of the food in this video, what is worst is the fact that I have eaten food out the trash and not gotten sick or felt sick unlike a mac salad.
That is effin disgusting 🤢
Nawh man
A diarrhea plate
The SKATE music brought back so many memories!! That food looks bussin
Getting fancy with the ice haha 🔥
Nah, your just high 🤣
4 years of Syracuse and about 2 million garbage plates.
I hate when people place food on top of other food… you might as well just put it in a blender….
That right there, is an artery clogger ☠️
Its garbage just like your facial hair !
The name has to change... I don't believe this is garbage, I see gold...
That looks disgusting
With out the random leaf in it it just looks like Cesar Dog food
Looks pretty bad 😂😂
“ wwATER.” 🤣
You lost me at the mac salad, n whatever that was slighy charred cooking next to the burger, and topping it all in yellow mustard. The name makes sense
I’m a New Yorker, and I approve of this garbage plate
I remember this because it’s Jenna marbles favorite food 😆😆😆
I know you are a Buffalo boy, but as a Rochester guy, I love to see this!!!! Let's Go!!
Rochester
I've been to Rochester, where the garbage plate is from, and I gotta say that they know how to make some bomb hangover cures in NY
Beef
I’ll pass
Dude you’re amazing ❤️
Man said homemade
The music sounds like your planning a heist
Looks tasty but that's _way_ too much work when you're hungover lol.
We call it the white version on carne asada fires.
Song name?
That is still looks kinda RAW
Does anyone remember Jenna and Julien making this? Didn't know it was actually a real thing 😋
Dude ea skate vibes with the song at the beginning
Nice tan for being in new york my guy

Rochester,NY classic
Thank you for using the mandolin guard! Nobody ever does and it makes me physically recoil
I’d tear that UP! Good job CHEF!!
Where do you get your garbage plate from, I use to go to the place across from Wegmans in gates, but now I just settle for Salvatore’s. FYI yours looks so much better.
Well done.
hey i seen a long version of this.
No Hayburner with this one?
He’s either from jersey, Pennsylvania, or New York lol
"Homemade mac salad" my ass
Holy shit, I heard green onions and the first thing to run through my head was hopping on my Xbox and playing the first skate while super trashed
Now ur getting lazy bro . Get this shit outta here
That's a no for me dog.

Noice  I mean garbage 🗑
No ketchup, the disrespek is Hi Key.

Gross! To each his own...
From what culture does your Mac salad originate?

A ny staple
Next Beef on Weck? ;)

Rochester homies get this one
Love the music.The sandlot was a phenomenal movie. And that plate isn’t trash it is killer.
A drunk plate lol
I'm sorry but i can't back you up on this one Jack
Diarrhea plate
Just peel them damn potatoes. It will take 40 seconds and you won't eat dirt.   What's next? The same with onion and garlic? Ohhh, wait .... it already is.   Allocate time & effort. We eat with our mouths, not only with our eyes.   And no, don't tell me that it is cooked at high temperature, because it is about the whole principle
Shit american version of carne asada fries lmao
This shouldn’t be called a garbage plate because the real garbage is the bots in the comment section🤦‍♂️ YT gotta fix this asap
