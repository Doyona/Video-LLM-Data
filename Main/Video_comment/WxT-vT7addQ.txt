Hey Matt love all ya channels this 1 I let my wife watch too lol she was wondering how much it all cost n how much is the mansion worth now thanks pal keep up the good work
It could have been "Abandoned McMansion" when these cool videos were made. It's a cool place. I am glad YouTube can make some cool stuff happen. Next "Abandoned Resort". Thanks.
Spectacular totally amazing thank you keep on doing what you do you two plus the best fans By Far
Such a gorgeous book - each shed is unique and inspiring, and I love all the tiny details Kotite features to help readers imagine how to create their own She Sheds https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxe9yi0sulKgsp0VJJCIrLWWkvVqcU7LFR . The feature on Dinah's Rustic Retreat is like something from a fairy tale. It's really inspiring to see how creative all these ordinary people are in making beautiful and useful spaces on a modest scale.
Meredith is NOT 7 feet tall😝. Well she may seem 7 feet tall if she gets angry at you.
This man really said "you are related to your mom" yes siiiiir
Look 👀 so good the house , Lincoln list was a lot of fun happy belated Easter 🐣
💙
Sheetrock is a brand
a year for that much work is not long at all
Love that awesome👍👍👍👍👍
Matt: "all the ceilings are 10 to 11 feet tall" Matt 5 minutes before: we had to get new doors on the barn to fit in my almost 10ft tall 5 tonne"
I am glad you continue to make video on the house
Matt: "I won't be helping at all because Mere doesn't like any of my ideas"  Also probably Matt: "What if... hear me out, the sink faucet looked like a Barrett M82? And to turn it on and off you have to rack the bolt. AND the water would come out of the end of the barrel and maybe even the muzzle brake, but for that the Barrett M107 would probably be better. I think that'd be cool, I would side with theoretical Matt
googol is still just pronounced like google, the company Google was supposed to be named Googol (a nod to the fact that there was so many things on the browser) but there was a mistake and it was spelled Google
When ur handwriting is like Lincon
Hope you have a heck of a latter to change light bulbs. You might try the curved barrel to send it up to screw itself in, just be sure to hit it just right. The threads still have to sync up just sayin. Alternatively you could use the extended bulb changer, however where's the challenge in that? Love the house. Thanks for being awesome.
Is sheetrock different than drywall? My dad does drywalling and painting so I'm jw
Мет бедняга!  Лампочки на потолке как менять будешь!

🥰
Damn you're going to need a scissor lift or genie boom just to change lightbulbs!!! Nice I love those curved ceilings. I'd hate to try doing the drywall on most of those, would be a pain
Man I miss the days when my son was that age soooooo much!! Now he's 16 with a car, a girlfriend, Xbox and all his buddies. The last thing he wants to do is hang out with Dad. I'm even a hunting, fishing, shooting mud bogging sob of a dad but still no dice. Oh well I get it because I was the exact same way at that age
Good luck cleaning the ceiling fans now 🤣😂 looks good guys
#thecherishedhouse
Love the shirt - Yea Buddy. Interesting fact about that phrase . . . It was 1st started by my college roommate Tim @ SEMO social event in fall of 1973. Yea Buddy.
I feel short now if Mair is actually 7foot
You should of had the Amish build it, it wouldn’t have taken as long  (Just joking)
Isn't that the wrong sheet rock for hanging stone by the fireplace?
I'll give you guys 8 months to finish everything even decorating
It's not junk anymore it's your TREASURE 🪙🪙🪙🪙
#FORDNATION
I would love to have those cars in Sweden 😍 but the taxes on each of them are around 600$ a year if not more 😅🙈 and the insurance are not cheap either 😂 first I have to buy them and they are not cheap here..
“It’s an Easter truck.” Me: Bwahahaha
The nifty hope disturbingly attach because cornet puzzlingly form between a free robin. miscreant, recondite bestseller
Lincoln is about the same age as my little brother.. they grow up so fast...
Wait mare is 7ft!?!!
I feel like this "shower-tower" or yeah now it's "bath-tower" should be just all covered in blue sheetrock (to dont risk for the for or sth just going up on those normal sheetrock panels and making them wet :p (but thats only my opinion I'm not proffesional, maybe I'm just wrong ;P)
Matt when do you Vet!
Cool. You picked the right time to rebuild your house right before building material prices increase to insane levels. 👍
Its had to of taken this long because yall r trying to do a lot of the work tho!
You are related to your mom
hows it going?!
I want to see more but it’s over😭
I loved his comment on dumb rules, so cute
A house made for Shaq...won't bump his head
Got to admit BUNKER RANCH HOUSE has a ring to it.
Build your daughters pink Easter truck...kinda looked badass in the pic, if we're being completely honest
I like Lincoln’s style “No, I’m not listening to that that’s just dumb rules!”
House update
hey, what are you going to do for the landscaping?
God is Good! 🙏🏼 Bless yinz brother... CANT WAIT TO SEE YER BUNKER & ARMORY! 👊🏼🇺🇸
Kepp it going bro wanna see the finished product. Im sure its gonna be epic
I just want to see you "interior decorate" the bunker.
ranch with a view
Wow, I hadn’t seen the vlog for a while. So exciting to see it covered in sheet rock! This house is gonna be luuuush! I’m looking forward to see how you decorate it!!😃👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💖🌱🪴💫
They still need to tape the top angle at the ceiling for fire rating if it's getting crown molding
Cool
Big fan
Why not use a fisheye lens? So we can see more. ? ::)
This is the only video with million views that they have post in a while!
The barreled ceiling is nice! What's the sq ft?
Are we everrrrrr going to see the abandoned mansion again? Come on! Stuff has got to be happening there. Please share.
My heart broke when I saw sheetrock covered the wooden ceiling in the dining room...that ceiling was unique and gorgeous and I think it would have looked great regardless of how Mere furnishes that room/house.  (Stone and wood; natural elements that will always work together.)  :-(   On a positive note, the house is looking great and so are y'all!!
Please don't put the TV above the fire place. That is the worst viewing angle ever
By any chance is your wife single?
When applying mud to the walls it’s called.Tape and bedding.
To make that drywall bend like that you have to wet and score the backside or use two layers of flexible 1/4 inch drywall.
А система отопления у вас какая?
В России никто не строит из дерева. Удивительно видеть такой большой дом из фанеры и ваты. Ваш новый дом большой и красивый. Главное, что бы он был ещё и теплым.
Need...update....aghhhh
I sell Plantation shutters, shades, and blinds if you need a guy for that
Meredith looks kind of pissed :/
Are you guys moving in to this home once it finished or is it a flip?
Should keep that little table... Just as a piece of your history with the house
Why didn't they tape the wall ceiling seem.
Can’t wait until carpet, paint, furniture, etc etc
I think you need some Dekko concrete cladding in that formal living room of yours ;) lol I think it would look fantastic. Ask Mere lol
Mere always seems unimpressed in general or annoyed by you 😂
BeauTiFUL ☺
I don’t know if it’s your wife’s personality but she doesn’t seem happy with anything. I would be so freakin happy to have that huge house and life.
When Linc smiles, he looks exactly like Mere to me.  cute!
I clean windows in mansions like this, especially construction clean-up like you got here. Takes a lot of scraping and patience to get the stickers and films off the windows, especially if they've sat a long time. Wish you were local to me so I could take care of it for you!
every one of these vidoes matt says either "look at that view", "look at that sunset", or "look at that sunrise" (also sorry if i spelt your name wrong)
The pink Easter truck was an awesome throwback to when Mere wrapped the Raptor pink
Remolition Ranch?
Googol and Google are said the same way, it's why Google is named as such. Also it's crazy how much Annie looks like Mere, Lincoln looks like you, and Addie looks like both of you combined!
You said she’s 7 foot tall
Love it.
I think all the women want to see Mere go shopping for furniture NOW that will get a lot of views LOL
Get wood shutters not blinds they look 100 times better .
Its looking great! When is the estimated time of completion?!
Thank you for taking the leap and bringing us along with you. Please don't stop filming. Yes I have been looking forward to what Mere had in store for the house once inside was done, I know you have so much more for the outside, I want to see those 'mundane shot' (no such thing) of you backfilling the the yard, setting up your driveway, garage and work bench, hooking in the electrical and testing all the plumbing, maneuver the bathtub into the house, etc. LOVE THIS SERIES & BUILD!!!  Kitchen suggestion: If you haven't already done this, put in a pot filler over the stove with filtered water, game changer.  Den suggestion: Get a pull out sectional so movie nights will just feel like a huge bed (maybe later on because you're gonna want to keep the kids close)
Please, please, please, pretty please don't paint all the walls tan like your current house!  It's soooo dark inside!
yo ranch you should put rocks in that water feeder. sounds stupid but them chicks will drown themselves. i've had it happen. so please put like driveway gravel, or some nice smooth rocks. they also peck the rocks, makes their beak stronger
Can't get over how far you guys have come huge congrats don't even know how u did it but u did thats saying something right there
I feel sorry for when one of those lights in the ceiling goes out you would need to rent a Scissor Lift just to change the light bulb
In sane beautiful i say 😊😊congratulations 💪
Children hade wonderful day adorable 😊‼️‼️🐾🐾 puppy chicks 🌝
typical american oversiced
3:56 wow Matt I didn’t know you were an artist
"Feathering the Nest"
You can still decorate your gun vault
Wow, everything is coming together. Can’t wait to see the finished product. 👍
Cannot wait to see what Mare does with the place.  This could be a whole new page.
You'll be living in it next month and renting out the house your in now ... I know I know my idea is good.
I didn't realize how much I missed these family style vlogs until seeing one for the first time in a while
I know this is a family channel and all but Annie's "Easter picture"...😂🤣 Lord forgive me🙏🙏
can't wait to see Addie wrap 5 ton pink
Hello! I had an idea for the new name for your Abandoned Mansion series. How about: Tales at the Big House 😁
Demolitia Castle still needs a moat!
"It's working! It's working!"
I am so glad I added off the ranch
This is beautiful to see a father with his children especially a guy who is as famous as he is. God bless you sir. And there is totally such a thing as an Easter truck.
👍
I'd like to interior decorate mere
Matt to say you're not happy about the mansion not being done is crazy! You guys have gotten so much done in less than 2 years. That mansion was a total wreck and y'all have brought it back to life. I'm flabbergasted at the inside; now I can really see all the rooms coming together. Can't wait to see what Meredith does with the interior decorating.
I love seeing Matt hang out with the kids!! So cute!
Wholesome family time 😤
Lincoln is awesome bruh
Hey Matt what's with all the big chips all over the concrete out back on the patio  and in side of the house ?
ATF be like "Nerf ammo for 13 and up only."
5:18 links a smart kid 😎
House name: The Bear house
Did you punch your boy in the mouth? He's missing a tooth?
Make sure you get the house all Smart Homed!!!
My fiancé doesn’t like my decorating ideas either 😞 we close on our first house Wednesday 😂
Is Sheetrock the same as plasterboard?
300 nerf darts of 300 bucks, huh matt? you must be mistaken that with 9mm
Laying plaster over all of that sheetrock (plasterboard in the UK) would cost an absolute fortune!!
24' ceiling in that room....good lord.
ohh this house is gonna be so cool
"Did you color my easter truck pink?" "Yes." "You are related to your mom." me: ReAlLy????
"Don't listen to that, that's just dumb rules." He made me like it.
Maybe Matt should suggest they spend some of their time on penmanship and spelling.  Lincoln could redo his todo list 25 x, would be a good start.
The table that you sat on the first time and talked about the house should be renivated, spruced up and kept as a part of your new home. Maybe take the pick of you sitting on it and decapodge it on the top of it.
Going to cost alot to heat and cool with the high ceilings.
Lol he said " she's 7 feet tall."
That's one big ugly house . Lol
Hello from Kyrgyzstan, I also wanted to send the flag of the country, but for a very long time.
Still waitin for that ”Dang!, Look at that view!” T-shirt, Matt!
48 foot ceiling at the 8:46 mark?
My son had an idea that you should take the “table” that is from the first abandoned mansion video and stain and refinish it for a piece of furniture for the house. I told him I would comment that cause I thought it was a great idea too!
The 450 dislikes are from people that didn’t have an amazing dad like Matt
Its close to 23 feet tall inn the center rooms just count the drywall seams
I would want to see a time lapse from start to finish of the renovation process. I think that would be a treat. I subscribed because of the first video of the "Abandoned Mansion" series. I kept up every episode, I really enjoyed it. Please keep us posted in regards to the renovation process. I can't wait to see the final product.
easter truck yes
Make a channel called demo branch for all your deleted or deyeeted videos.  Think it would do awesome.  Feel free to throw extras at me lol
Tape and bed.
How about titling episodes "This Old Mansion", a play on This Old House episodes?
just counting the sheet rock its about 32 feet tall
So glad you guys actually are still filming this!!!! So excited to see how it all looks!!!
matt. ive been watching you for about 6 years now... but i cant get past the feeling that your compensating for something. I love you tho lol
can anyone explain what the diff coloration is with the drywall? like some areas grey,some dark and then white stripes
@offtheranch DEMOLITION MANOR MATT PLEASE
mere is taller than Matt because matts 6'9" and she's 7'
It's a ginormous house!!
Beautiful
Video idea. OK hear me out. You find who the original builders are and bring them in to see their reaction after you finish the house. Or hell even do it now at this point I’m sure they would be blown away. Do you know who they are? If so have you had any contact with them and are they aware that this is happening to their old project?
did you say she is 7 feet tall? that would be higher then most of the population
Y’all should put a chandelier in the tower over the bath if y’all have not planned it already
Meredith is 7 feet tall???? Jesus
What ever happened to the mosaic tiles you took down from the wall? Will you still put up in new home?
Gonna be a sick compound 🤟
Matt, my wife just said that it would be killer when it's done to have a split screen vid of "Before and After" walk through so we can all see the changes in comparison.  Man yall coming along great with it, the kids will love it up there I'm sure!  Yall stay safe over there, and if ya see Donut Operator, tell him I said DUH HUH, he'll know what ya mean! /grin
i dont mean to be rude but.. are not your stairs supposed to be really quite hen you go up them?
You have to keep the table
All those gaps in the ceiling 😕
I love the kids sooo much , they are all growing up ....
@8:35 sheetrock begin
Another Great episode of the Not so Abandoned Mansion/ Homestead on The Hill (emphasis on Home and Hill)  : ) Seeing the sheetrock up really is exciting, cause it's easier to visualize how Cool it's gonna be. Sincerely I Thank You and Meredith for sharing your Family of Smart kiddos, Hearts of Gold and Fabulous Home with us. Love the arched ceilings and the Easter Masterpiece you made as a Family. (The Best!)  Zillions of Blessing to To You All.
Matt I don't mind seeing the large house atop the hill. But to answer the question "Do we all want to go to the Big House?".... ...Uhmm no I have avoided the Big House for 59 years I have no desire to go there now.
As a drywaller, the joint displacement is not the greatest. To close together. But clean job.
Hola hace tiempo  que  te sigo desde  que tenías la clínica de veterinaria pero ya me asombras que as cambiado   de arreglar mansiones pero como no se el inglés  no  me entero de nada  pon por lo menos sustitulos en español  un saludos para toda familia desde España cordoba Andalucía
Fly me in from Canada. I'll fix that tape job
wow! half your outlay is done! Double your time so far and double your costs and you will be done! Awesome!
Super happy for you guys. Such an awesome endeavor.
this is the greatest show on earth
Love the videos. Hope you had a great Easter with your family. Much love from a fellow in Texas. God Bless.
Accident insurance
RAM??? TRANSMISSION GONE, FORD ,WELL CAN YOU SAY SHOP? Chevrolet Duramax Allison transmission can't go wrong!
Poor Matt getting roasted about his Easter truck
Ok we want to know more about the chicks 🐥. Are they light brahmas? Don’t assume we, the ladies, don’t want to see more chicken or coop episodes. 🐓🐓🐓🐓🐥🐥🐥🐥
How are you going to change those light bulbs?
Want to see Mere interior decorate, or just see Mere ? That is the question.....
I call dibs on building your cabinets 😂
Quack 14:01
House is coming along beautiful.
4:25 Ahhh just perfect
The demolition castle!
Thank you for being such a good example to dads everywhere! I wish all dads played with their kids like you do.
"They don't look like eggs"  "They're not eggs"  "They're definitely eggs"  If they don't look like eggs, how'd you know they're eggs? 🤔🤔🤔
Lincoln when it says 13 and older that is just the suggestion just like speed limit signs. Happy Easter to all of you
Are you going to install under cabinet lighting?
I think that y’all should use that table somewhere in the house as a reminder of what you went through to get this gorgeous house!
Why didn’t you use the( bulletproof drywall panels)?
still like the name the Carriker Castle.  see it really rolls off the tongue
Thank you Mere, thank you Matt.  No guns hanging in the house?...good choice to have Mere decorate.
👍👍👍👍
A name for the new show OUR MANSION it is simple and carries on part of the old name. Thank you, from South Australia.
I 💙💙💙that Lincoln made a list & U did ALL the things on it w/ him. that is the coooooollest dad moment! Very trust blding nice
Those darts are garbage!
Matt is such an awesome dad, and person.
The heating bill $$$$$$
Bay nurf bolets... that made my day
Can I just say, Lincoln is so smart. Like damn
Waiting to see the cabinets 🤘🏻 I work at ww wood products Shiloh building them. Can’t wait to see what y’all pick.
First: what will it cost to heat this place, second: a big house like that you need an intercom system. Trust me, I have lived in a huge house and you are forever running around looking for people, and an intercom saves you lots of steps. Just sayin'.   Third: I hope you have a maid service and fourthly, if I see any giants looking for housing I will send them your way. lol
Whoa first video of yours I've seen in months gotta slow down Matt your getting some grey hair
Can we start calling it the demolition den?
Crazy how you call it sheet rock in the UK we call it Plaster board 🤣
If you’d have got the camera out of his face maybe he would’ve played outside longer 🤷🏻‍♂️ I’d hate to be a kid with a dad constantly talking into a camera when he’s meant to be hanging out with me.
@ 8:48 best estimate  24 feet from floor to ceiling
Can't wait to see the abandoned yacht videos.
If the Sheetrock is done then they missed a few things LOL
Blue drywall is mold resistant
Okay I didn't watch this series for a couple months and then I come in and look at the titles and I see snow...checking on the abandoned mansion....the final episode....what will we do now? And I panicked because I thought the snow and everything caused something terrible. Relieved to know that's not the case. Definitely want to see the rest of everything.
My son says google too 🤣🤣
llwhat did you say double talken. your the head of the malitia. meridith a judge trying to give me what six months for what for entrapment that is the lowest of all the lows things think. good with that. hope your dreams get crushed too.
Loved watching all the videos and the entire process. Can’t wait to see the interior decorating! Wish you would have done the brick dome ceiling. We stayed in the same house in Cabo this past February with the brick dome ceilings and absolutely loved them, so I was really hoping you both would’ve done it. Regardless the home is beautiful and I can’t wait to see everything finished! ❤️
Before you finish put bigger windows in the high vault room trust me you wont regret it those tiny windows are dull and boring.
All the rooms look so much bigger with the drywall on. You can actually see the size now.
Cannot wait for the Interior Design to start.😘🙏❤👍👍👍
Matt built a mansion faster than Brandon Herrera could build the AK-50
Who ever did that flushing needs to be shot legit
She is looking at those ceilings and really high walls, thinking how are we going clean them when they need it.
Next up on off the ranch we both a Palace
Amazing! I’d put an overlook into that huge space with the beams and probably bigger windows to let the light in, but maaaan - it’s amazing.
How could anyone dislike this video? Weird stuff... maybe people don't like chickens?
Hey! Hey! Still moooving!!!
Take the vax u will go to Hell. It is the mark of the beast. Its either you're gonna turn your life to JESUS CHRIST NOW or you're going to Hell. Time is almost up its HEAVEN/PARADISE WITH THE FATHER, THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT FOREVER  or forever in pain and torment in Hell fire and torture. Please turn to JESUS CHRIST NOW!!!!!!
They don’t have to worry about flooding...
7 feet tall.... naaaaaa... more like 4 ore 5... 7 feet is over 2 meters... that cant be right
it looks nice... bur sure hope that heating is cheap in USA.. and the vent installations recycle the heat.
How are you going to change a light bulb?
I recommend purchasing a scissor lift to change lightbulbs
Use a projector in the formal living room for family movie night.
Don't forget to call chip & Jo Anne Gaines to help with the interior decorating! Lol 😆
Yessssssssir
Cabinets?  How about cabinets from a fellow Aggie?  Kent Moore Cabinets in Bryan, TX!
Awesome! I just miss the drone footage on the outside!
please lots of color.  White is boring unlike your family. Can't wait !
More Mer is always better. She's a lot prettier than you. Even though you're really pretty.. you know, in a totally platonic kind of way.
24 feet tall ceiling
That view is amazing!!! This home is going to be  Gorgeous!!!! Or should I say this mansion!!!
Beautiful house! Yes! The cross and the empty tomb!
can't see once all the cabinets and built-in stuff goes in...would love to see a finished house tour!
After my house was hit by a tornado a year ago, I too have a brand new house with older bones. House was built in ‘75.
That shill game is strong!
When you start looking at new furniture (wall units, OTTOMAN, dining set, etc...) look up LORTS MANUFACTURING! Quality American made custom furniture. You'll love it!!
I highly doubt you could survive 30 days alone with your ego!
If your putting up tile for shower doesn't use sheetrock use hardyboard or concrete board, tile pulls away from sheetrock
Mere! You must get the 5 ton wrapped in pink like you did the raptor!
This channel should be renamed to "How To Be A Good, Fun, Genuine Dad"
I know you didn't want to stick to the "abandoned mansion" title, but what about "second chance home"?
Yes yes yes we want to see it ALL
I hope your putting your own nuclear generator to power your new compound. I’d hate to have that electrical bill when your all done lol.
12:19😂😂
By Monday Lincoln will have 300 nerf darts, by Tuesday Matt will have 300 nerf darts to pick up...
Make a Fummins out of the f350, so everybody is happy
Used to do Framing for a living, this house is a sheetrock nightmare lol, poor guys. I'm soo glad i got out of the trade...
Looking more amazing as time goes
My son said: Daddy why can't you be more like the demo man? Me: Go to your room.
Дочь - один в один как мать)
wow time flys by
Casually, "she's 7 foot tall" 7??
Mansion is coming along, that’s a lot of sheet rock. Thanks Chuck
I am so glad you guys are still keeping us in the loop. I look forward to your updates. It’s so awesome to watch the transformation.
It’s really been almost 2 years? That’s crazy. I’m so happy for you guys ❤️
New title: The shining mansion on the hill!
call it the demsion (demolition mansion).!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The arguing about the easter truck, lollll
You definitely need a man cave for all of your animal trophies Matt.
Damn... wish my stepdaughters were this simple 😒😕
are those pella windows?
Don't get divorced over it! it's just a bump!
Who else has been here since the beginning??? Waiting for the next episode??
I love the outro
So is the 2nd Amendment unless people like you actually start promoting it to your millions of subs..........
Looking good
OMG... I just noticed how your kids have grown since the first time I saw your vids.
Just when I think Annie can't be more like Mere, she looks at her dad like he said something dumb
I am just here for the mansion update
Matt nice truck that you drawed!
What's up with the 3 dinky windows in the 20 foot ceiling room?  It looks so bizarre. 8:38
Suggestion for ya regarding the arched ceiling. How about painting it like The Sistine Chapel? You just need to find a contemporary Michelangelo...
This house is gonna be so incredible! I cannot wait to see the finished product. Y’all are gonna have such an amazing life in that house, making memories!
I thought that you were gonna say "tax and sh[beep]t" to Lincoln.
Time to start thinking about a whole house back up generator.
How long until you guys move in to the new place?
Annie drawing the tomb, made me smile.  Your children know what happened on Easter.  Bless you.
I wonder if Matt will break down the cost?
I like it but as time progresses you’ll find that soon it’s Valuation will be roughly 50% of what you had to invest in it.
Playing with your kids is epic content!
There are soo many great one liners in this one! hahahaha!!  But watching Matt play with the kids while watching my first unborn move around in my belly got me in the feels. Fantastic start to the day. Thanks Matt!
Clicked on the video, because I saw both of you on the thumbnail. :-)
I can't believe they still use drywall in a shower....durarock builders!!!
I don't get the idea of using a murder  device as a symbol of Love. If my kid was shot with a gun I don't think I would wear a gun around my neck. It just doesn't make sense to me, and I love Jesus. I can't believe the scripture that says to have no symbols at all is still ignored by Christians, also I can Not understand why we still use pagan rituals in our Christian holidays, easter started as a act of worship to a fertility god, Christmas traditions worship the sun god, down to the decorated tree is a tradition to honor the sun god. Also the new version of the king james was altered at psalms 83:18, they took Gods name out of it completely....modern Christians have been lead astray and they don't seem to care. Personally I don't believe modern religion is teaching us to be our higher Loving self, to put Lov3 first, to see the divinity in all life and to love eachother and ourselves like we are Loves Children.  Fear is the opposite of Love, The opposite of God who is Love. We can do so much better but we are being taught Fear and it is suppressive we can not continue our ways, end fear and embrace love, love yourself first and give yourself in service to others, earn your place on earth, we are the only conscious caretakers of earth, do your part every day. Thank You. Love you All!
Have you not put your kids in videos recently or have i just completely glazed over? Cause i swear i only recognized Lincoln, they all look so grown!
I want to paint it! I know y'all are going to have it sprayed but, I can dream.
Can’t wait to see what you do outside with your landscaping!!
Hey Meredith, time to go shopping for that 30ft chained French crystal chandelier to hang in your foyer.. Exiting times
She already has braces
We got 6 chicks too. You are a great dad!
Congrats Matt and Mere 🙂
The better ink collaterally boast because galley randomly mix pro a imminent lilac. unusual, barbarous meat
🔥🔥
300 nerf freedom seeds for $15?  If only real freedom seeds costed that much...
4:24 what a throwback
The abandoned mansion series is over, because it is now not abandoned.
Great show.
from the content you've provided us, and from the work you do. this house is deffo deserved.
dont cheap out on the shower waterproofing.. at least use Redguard or Mapei  paint on options.. Blue wall here or there, thats the bare minimum, never do the bare minimum if it involves water and sheetrock....
Link looks so much like mere omg
The beneficial equinox comparably flash because security nouzilly detect concerning a uninterested resolution. noiseless, nonstop target
If you're still looking for a new name, you said it yourself. The Big House.
If not for the Democrats your house would be complete and less expensive, but they had to spread the China virus shutdown nonsense.
NOOOO. Speaking from an electrician experience. Island lights always get what’s called old worked. You take your measurement when the island is set in its final position and we put up old worm box’s on final. No mistake made
Matt please tell me I'm not the only parent who unintentional laughed inside at 4:54 ?
Bro I cant wait to see the future when they move in and make vlogs
Don't forget smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms😁
I was genuinely concerned it was over
Are we not going to talk how his wife is 7 ft tall???
Hi Matt, Hi Mere & adorable kids. I love the Easter artwork. Oh my Gosh,  the big house is coming along so beautifully.  All the sheet rock helps to visualize how it'll look when Mere works her magic.
Can’t wait to see it finished.
IDK if you read this but.. Start a new series about the abandoned you know what.. Call it "No Longer Abandoned The Home with a view"
Matt at this point I 100% believe you'd make love with a car if you could cause I'd say 4 minutes of this was ooh look at that car
I think you should name it sunrise mansion
You should have named it something to do with Manson.
Happy u got some ram trucks now 🔥💙🙏🏽 I’m sure u can tell a difference from that ford 😌
For your analytics
Your going to love the cost of heating and cooling that place...
"I’m not listening to that, that’s just dumb rules." Sniff...it brings a tear to my eye seeing the youth of Texas so well raised these days ! Great job Matt and Mere, great job. I hope those 300 Nerf Bullets made for some really nice Easter Egg "Hunting" ! Go Linc !!!
goonzquad doesnt have a mansion, but they have made a decent amount of progress in the time that it has taken you guys lmao. Keep up the great work and videos!!
I’d watch a full video of you and link doing stuff ❤️
So... internet..  what is the plan for that.
Beautiful house on the hill!
90k pink 5t shirts. And Matt has to Pink wrap the 5ton 😂🤣 mare gets to choose the shade of pink. Tho
Amazing. Since YouTube recommended this a year ago I've seen all videos and low key didn't want this to end but it did and congratulations! Up next Interior design please 😍
Mare is pretty.
Mats great to his kids I would have never been able to just get 200 nerf darts like that. :)
"It's an Easter truck" made my day
Mere called and said the house should be called " Matt's Fault"....LOLOL
i refused to believe you weren’t making a another abandoned mansion video
The house is looking great, I like every part of it so far... Good job Mere
Mere is 7ft she looks so tiny like 4 or 5 ft
Pew Pew Palace
Glad to see the casa come together!   Wonder if Matt R.  will be back suppling his building skills and tips?
👍
Still need to sheet rock all the floors$$
A vlog series of mer interior decorating the whole house would break the internet!
Only another year to go!
So solar on the Roof. ?? Would be good.
Matt will be sleeping in his pew pew bunker
I really enjoy the family bits
Omg Dude I've been gone for so long I've literally missed a lot
Build your house upon the ROCK!
Nobody cares about the sheetrock in your mansion.
I think that Lincoln will for sure try and climb the rock on the side of the house and the fire place
Cooling that place in the Texas heat with all those windows will be more than your current mortgage. Yet it will be worth it
Was this really worth posting on YouTube
I remember when they did the first video.... when mere said “it’s almost been two years.” I was like wtf.... TIME WENT BY FAST!
You should keep the table since it has a great story.
please adopt me
👍👍💞
Amazing keep up the good work bro and remember God loves you
Not too much longer and you’ll be moving in! Wow! I knew it would be epic! So excited for you and your family! Incredible..❤️❤️❤️
not chance in the world meridth is 7 feet tall
I only did a garage last year and that was enough taping and mudding for a lifetime. Such a shit job.
Good god... I am just finishing up doing all new sheetrock on a 1,700 sq/ft rental. Which means quick and dirty work (2 coats). I did it with one kid who's never done sheetrock before and I'm damn near dead. I want to share this with the world because it's blowing my friggin mind, and no one would understand
Just bought 2 gals of paint for a guest room and OMG, the GALLONS of paint you are going to go through!
if anyone is curious the ceiling is about 24'
How much $ for the Easter truck picture you drew?
Addie is gonna be a tall girl. The kid is just all legs.
You gotta save that bench/table thing. That's an important piece of Ranch history.
Blackout curtains. You need blackout curtains in the TV room.
This is epic!
@OffTheRanch You can build a small square frame out of 2"X4" and cover it in wire mesh, similar to brooding cage usage, to put the feeder and water on... the chicks will still be able to get to them, but get much less shavings in the bowls!!!!!!! I just learned this the other day and thought you might like to try it.
Time for finish.  Get out the checkbook bro!!!!!!
Hey Matt! What about the painting made up from the small tiles that you removed from the house? Are you getting those repainted?
Do not use blue sheetrock for a tile backer you will have a rot you can use an easier system like weedi bord. I'm a contractor I can't tell you how many times we ripped tile off and we finally used sheetrock as a backer and it's completely rotted and moldy and have a rotted out parts of the framing.
This is so exciting!
Are you not worried about Eco problems in your giant rooms. ?
lincoln is going to be a great gun owner with the nerf dart comment
Recliner recliner recliner recliner recliner recliner.  For the love of abandoned mansions get a recliner for the living room. 😴
Every mansion video has over 1 million views..... tell me again why you aren't keeping the series going? We love ya and love the progression of the mansion
You are such a great dad, I forgot the reason why I clicked on this video until you said we wanted to see the house.
They delivered my series X on Easter.
Lol how the hell are you gonna change the light bulbs in that living room?
I love the one with the stone rolling away
We definitely would have ABANDONED YOU if you wouldn't have shown the interior design. I think that's what I've been most excited for.  And btw, we'd never leave you Matt.
so jealous!! awesome house and landscape
8:50 Sheetrock comes in 4x8 sheets. There are 6 sheets on that wall. It's about 30 feet high.
Is it going to be called Renovating Mansion now?
you sir need a large 155" screen projection setup with Atmos. Call me :)
How will you change a bulb in the highest ceiling?
Matt I wanna see the five ton door!!!!
4:25 is this foreshadowing?... will the 5-ton get wrapped in pink??? Does it need to happen now? Yes, yes and yes
awesome
Did he ever fix the pipe mere put a nail through
She’s 7 Feet tall?!?!
It’s amazing I’ve been watching your channel my whole childhood and I remember when you posted your first abandoned mansion video and how excited I was and now it’s amazing to see how far you have come. Thank you for a big part of shaping me into who I am today
Well, at least he didn’t say he wanted a list with a googolplex of items on it! (10^100^10)
12:51 It's definitely not Mountain Dew!!!!
I figured it out. “THE UN-ABANDONED MANSION” new series title. You’re welcome that one is for free😌
Какая прелесть получается, вместо той развалюхи! Молодцы!!!
Matt are you still going to narrate on the mansion xx
Your heat and air bill will be off the charts with all the tall ceilings
Dude, you are a much better father than I was, what a good job it is so important for your kids I'm very impressed Great Job!!!!!
the only exposed stud in that house now is wearing a blue shirt.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sweeeeeettttttt! You guys looks tiny in the 'Renavated Mansion'.
I think you forgot to mention the slide in the vaulted room.  I mean, what else would you do with that space...
I wanna see the sheet rock bill for real....
Lol Meredith is always so enthused. 😅 I can identify with her 😅
But when there teenagers I'm not in 😂🤣😂 matt cracks me up all the time
I wanna see which house is gonna be better this mansion or the “whats inside”  family house
15 darts for 300 bucks lmao, about right in today's market 😂
Wow it looks so much bigger with the sheet rock!!!! I can't wait for Merridith to decorate!!! And the view is always a plus!😁😎
Well I'll be
Dude please tell me some one is painting a picture on that ceiling over the dinning area
I'll buy Matt's drawing of the Easter 5-Ton for $1,000,000.
Come on now.......demolition ranch + mansion = DEMOLITIA RANCHION
Do you still work as a veterinarian or did you just say Im doing good on youtube i dont need it
Pause at 16:10. Look how mere looks at matt. Get you someone who looks at you like that
Sheetrock ™ must love all this free advertising, when you could be saying drywall you are using the name brand.
Good Lord, that's a lot of Gypsum Board........ Letting your Son plan his Birthday is AWESOME! Have a Great Day, Y'all.
You guys can take up professional pole dancing now with those high ceilings! 😆
Inhabited house
Love the art work
Happy Easter 🐰
I become a home owner in June, nothing quite of this magnitude, but would make a great rental in the future.
14:22 the 21st night, of September
Man, I cannot wait to see the finished product! I have been keeping up with the build for like the past year or more and I am just as excited for it as you guys are!
“That’s a truck.” “Ya it is but it’s an EASTER truck!”
I love the drawings
With that amount of amazing walls...please Lord, give them a projector!!! It's a dream house for a projector! No need for a screen,  I fire mine onto the basic painted wall and it's absolutely awesome!
#AbletotheIntro
*Matt please make Russian subtitles for your videos!*
24 ft entrance way, that's nice (each sheet of sheetrock is 4ft wide)
I want to see the shooting range.......or did he show it already after the pour
12:24 shouldn't the bathtub tower roof be that blue sheetrock as well with all the condensation?
That middle opening in the ceiling that you weren't sure of might be a center channel speaker. House is looking great!
Easter truck XD
Yay!!!
Matt it might have been already suggested or obvious, how about Ranchtopia for renaming "The Abandoned Mansion" ? Since it has soo much hill top bliss.
Matt is such a great father !
should call it our off the ranch mountain home
You didn't show any of the addition. Was it not sheetrocked yet?
Googol: a 1 with 1 million zeros Googolplex: a 1 with 1 googol zeros
Hey Matt, you should not show your post-code, it made it really easy to find your (current) house, in case you wanted some privacy :)
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVUOGJJqMvG9Im0iLtZvrdw?sub_confirmation=1
Hold on he actually good at drawing trucks
The screws will pop in that bend. Should of used glassroc
388 thumbs down, gotta love the haters 🤘🤘🤘🍻🍻🍻 keep doing what you're doing 👍👍👍

OMG LOL "You are.. related to your mom.." - Demo, 2021  I have a bet for you Matt: I bet a 1911, Linc is related to Mere    **Mailman starts sweating**
Full rock climbing wall in the formal living room.
Solid dadding
YEA  still get to see the completion of the project.!!
Can judge the height by the seams. Looks about 24' tall in the great room, about 10' kitchen
Climbingwall in the 900 feet tall living room. Also what kind of feet do you measure in?
I bought my boy 1k nerf darts once. Still have a few hundred.  Not to give any ideas, but if you put thumb tacks in the tips they are great for playing darts! I throw regular darts, my kids shoot theirs! Good times! And because they are kinda dangerous it also teaches good gun practices! Just saying
No offence but why do people in the US put TVs above fireplaces? It seems like such a bad placement for a TV in terms of height.
you really make me desire a family to love as much as you do yours! thanks for being such a great person!
How do you get water?
u mean 14 : )
The easter truck is the raptor when they got it rapped in pink.😂
The shower is half the size of my house 😐
Wow looks good love seeing updates of the house

#41 trending yessirrrr
Looking great, I’m mean like awesome 👏🏻. PS I miss your brother. I didn’t want to mess up your moment. 🙏🏻
Wait...5 ton is only 10 feet tall?! The internet definitely lied about how tall Matt was then... My sprinter is 9'6" and I figured the 5 ton was way taller! Scam...
Dude the "its greeeat" made me cackle. That's a solid meme. agreed!
Jinxed it, foundation is gonna fail miserably
Sure is heartwarming seeing him set aside time for his children! Bravo!
This house is amazing! The spray foam and sheet rock alone must have cost a fortune!
Yo momma a sheetrock
Awwwww! Isnt that list from Lincoln just the CUTEST!!!!  New house looks amazeballs. CANNOT WAIT to see what Mere does!
This guy has grown white beard since the last time I saw him two years ago
Day after they finish a tornado comes thru and destroys everything...
YEEEEEEES
Not looking forward to changing those light bulbs, eh?
Your "Formal living room" is bigger than my entire house!
That is a beautiful home and I love the view from that bedroom window
Me just realizing that the only reason Mere went along with this is that she gets to decorate it all.
I'm so happy that everything is going well with the "abandoned" mansion and your family.  I've lived vicariously through your videos for years now ever since I was a grunt in the US army. Since the VW beetle and the gremlin with the cobalt engine (which i was quite jealous of at the time). I hope to one day be able to put my family into a beautiful home such as your (soon to be "mansion"). You deserve it. Best of wishes from me my brother.
We Did it Guys! We helped them change it from rags to riches!! This building is alive again!!!
how many nerf bullets does it take to stop a 50 cal
Super 😉❤️👍👍
You can save 15% or more on car insurance at GEICO
aye man, i build cabinets, hmu for a good deal lol
Hey mat if you need cabinets done and be perfect hit me up. My dad runs his own company and is one of the best in San Antonio.
My suggestion when you finish the house: sell it and buy a nice double wide.
Just here for the view.... 😂
You guys are amazing and i appreciate how humble you are to have fortunate circumstances. But at the same time you have an amazing brother/sisterhood of amazing people who love your content and want to be a part of your amazing projects. Keep up the amazing videos. I always feel happy when i see a new video and when im watching your videos i feel disconnected from the world and relaxed. Thank you again
It was worth the effort and hard work you put into it.Was a wise decision to buy it even though most people wouldn't give the house a chance in the condition it was.Now it looks amazing,...so much has changed for the best
So you’re telling me I invested almost two years in watching these lol
They'll be rewarded with the magnificent view every day.
love ti when texan's say 'dang' In scotland uk. FuCK
Lol damn my son's been saying Googly as a friend told him Infinity isn't a real number but Googly is. Haha now I know it's googal and 10 to the 100power. Haha awesome
Matt & Mere the house is looking great . I can't believe all the sheet rock has been hung in the whole house .
Tent the windows!
I do miss Matt's demolition of the interior in the first few vids. I laughed so much at those!!! Thanks for the Amazing content!!!
Annie looks exactly like mere
Nice to see you made it off YouTube
So happy for you guys you have built a beautiful home . You made something out  of what would have otherwise just decayed into nothing.
It's a Mansion now
That little boy looks just like his daddy
Your brother has to be smiling down on you all. HUGS from Esquimalt
Next up in the Formally Abandoned Mansion Series: Matt is painting the walls, with a paintball-pew-pew... don't tell Mere...
Can we see the bunker next? 😎
Where’s your fire sprinklers ?? 🔥oh is that just a California thing
The marked candle theoretically signal because caption cytochemically destroy across a educated gateway. crazy, medical direction
U guys Home is coming along well love it . Bless use always Thanks 😊. 😇
Finish your home move in and throughly enjoy! ... remember that beautiful sunset 🌅
Are you doing texture on walls
Should use bull knose corner bead, much fancier and has a expensive look.. i actually own a drywall business of 19+ plus years.. almost 20 years now.. looks 👍

Teaching the true meaning of Easter- love it ✝️
You guys are so tall. I'm a little person 😳😳😳😳😔
“Theres no such thing as Easter Trucks...”
That curved rock isn’t easy! Props to the installers!
mere is Joana Gaines 2.0
I thought you were not doing anymore videos
Such a massive difference
In your new place. hahahah.  GOOOGLE
LOVE FROM HELOTES!  I HEAR A RELEASE PARTY ARE YOUR NEW PLACE IN THE FUTURE!...ninja hugs from all of us here!  17
Cool. This video is sending you guys to my Drywall livestream video celebrating 100,000 subscribers on my Drywall channel
Mere"s look before & after. Priceless.
Oh I am so excited to see more of it
I keep forgetting that operatordrewski and Matt are brothers
Why didn’t they tape the angles in the Kitchen? Even if it’s getting crown molding Should be taped
The little hole looked like a junction box.
Webster's dictionary defines "mansion" as " large house of a wealthy person ". Yeah Matt, I think it's a mansion.
Who ripped a fat one at 4:06
Mere could start her own channel: "Don't tell Matt: The mansion interior"
I’ve been watch y’all for a few yrs now, just once I’d like to see Mere do the vid Outro with the same enthusiasm as you Matt!
Shoot call it "Mountain Top Manor"
So a thought on your entertainment rooms, in addition to blinds might want to look at having the windows tinted. Help block a lot of that unwanted light.  Oh and thanks for continuing the house series.
Glow in the dark nerf gun bullets!!! Hide and seek nerf gun battle! Super awesome fun with the kids.
I would hate to rough and finish that house
Can't wait till matt starts making vlogs and we see the carriker family in THIS house. I have literally witnessed them grow,; it's like im some distant non-related cousin.
Are the flags in the intro new? I like it.
Is mere really 7ft tall?
"That's just dumb rules."       HEHEHEHEHAHAHAHAHAHA
Is really good the quality time you spend with your kids
The house looks amazing, but I'm Slightly disappointed we did not get any time lapse of the sheetrock going up. I was especially curious how they would hang the groin
If you need any help in Decorating I'm definitely voluntary!!!!😷 Beautiful Home 🏡💕💖❤ God-bless you-all's Home 🏡💕❤ The man that's trying to build-up my credit score from Indianapolis 🇺🇸
Cummins swap the ford
I was just admiring how you kids seem to be the few who know the religious meaning of Easter.... And then you draw an Easter truck. Lol.
Does anyone know the title of the track that plays at 6:40?
Hahaha its funny how your daughter is a copy of your wife they are identical
8 like when you called the big house.  That should be the name of the channel!
Omg I love the list lol that's awsome
You 2 are doing an outstanding job. I see Matt at some other events and wonder is that a clone? Then when you had to do a pass of the Freedom 500 it needed no explanation. To be totally honest Matt, when I see you with Cleet or Donut you look so out of your element and Im not trying to be disrespectful because your one hell of a human... Either that or Im just use to seeing you shoot things up or building Bunker Branding or this Beautiful Mansion.  This reminds me when I built my business with my wife and we built a mansion, not quite this size but a big beautiful home. Good Job.
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23- For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9- That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Damn Bro, congratulations. Can't wait to see it finished.
Looking very nice but who's changing the light bulbs in that very high ceiling when they go out? You or Mere?
Nurf.  Love it.
It’s okay buddy you get to interior decorate your pew pew bunker. Hopefully.
nice Mat lol
I can't wait to see it finished and decorated!
Hope you give lots to charity, Matt. \o/
Sure you'll help. Mere will tell you exactly how you can help.
Why do you ship Amazon????
How much did the house cost?
Soooo.... we painting the 5 ton pink now??
For the new house are you going to have a new Texas sign for guest to sign or keeping the old one
Great dad content! (Coming from a single dad with 2 kids) kids are AWESOME!!!!!!!
I love that your kids know the real reason for Easter that doesn't happen very often in this day and age 🥺
why'd you choose the smallest room for the TV??
The electricians will cut in the pendant lights above the island later when the island is actually installed. The wire is looped above, they’ll cut a hole, pull the wire out and use a remodel round box
Matt your kids are adorable
6:26 That Ford almost doesn't fit in the garage lol I wonder if they are using wired smoke alarms 🤔
I wonder if the previous "owner" has any idea of the potential you've created.
Bro, he was 3.89 last I checked 3 days ago and now he's at 4.05? GET'EM
Nah man more of them german hill country views
It is beautiful
we need two more comments
I can't wait to switch ur kids grow up in this new house ! They are so pure
Do you have a degree in art my dude that truck “I bet bob Ross couldn’t even do it”
What was the sheet rock working on?
Who are you gonna do with your old ranch?
Been there done that when I had a young family. Congratulations guys. It’s so much work but it’s completely worth doing. Be patient, some day soon you will be kissing the kids goodnight on your first night at your home. That’s the best feeling and man it’s worth the wait. God bless your family and thank you for sharing your journey with our family.  ✌🏻❤️🇺🇸
Your going to need a scissor lift to replace the light bulbs. Lol
I've seen a lot of these and I never get tired of the view.
#40 on trending!!!
Mat I would defend you and your family as my own God bless happy late Easter
1 Gugol is 1 with a million zero following it
Cant wait for the grand Mere design!!!
Trending in the UK 🇬🇧 The Brits are coming‼️
24feet tall. Crazy
Watch out on the cheap nerf darts  You run into the cheap ones that have hard tips that leave welts. Unlike the originals
It’s coming along greatly!
Let me paint the inside I lost my job thanks to dirty Democrats

Can’t wait to see the El’Chromino parked out front.
On solid rock they stand
Lincs amost ready for his own youtube channel. $x2
I love those barrel ceilings. Are you going to do a renaissance art ceiling?
This vid was on my Google news just so you know
The pair of you have every right to be deservedly proud. Fantastic job. Best of luck.
Why note call the series "Our Big Ass Rescue House On The Hill Somewhere in Hill County, Texas"?  It has a nice ring to it.
C'mon just Cummins swap it already
The great thing is now Mere seems a lot more interested and ready to start decorating... You can see the wheels on spinning in her head as she walks thru the house of what she wants to do in each room. Matt, you both took on a big project and you can see the finish line ahead, we've all seen you make some changes along the way, but they are working brother. Congratulations on staying with it to the end.
How will you clean the  cob webs off the ceiling in those tall rooms? Check for Radon gas. Looking great so far. Every thing is coming together.
Have you all found the OG owners?  Just wondering if they know what y'all have done.
Alright. New name. Incorrectly wired Mansion.
How many wifi extenders are ya’ll going to need??
Tiny bit of regret, but I'm happy. How long until he trades that Ford off for a Cummins? lol
Soooo Happy for you guys!!!! It Was worth it !! 👍💖😉
"you are related.. to.. your mom." 😂😂😂 I started dying
Matt, ya gotta have someone come in & paint a mural of you like in the Sistine Chapel of you reaching out to grab the golden .50!!🤣🤣
Watching all of you is really inspiring! I’m 19 and when I watch these types of videos I think to myself, damn I wanna be like that guy. And it’s really been helping me and motivating to want to achieve more and more each day! Thanks Matt you’ll be a part of my success without even knowing it!  🤘🏼❤️
A lot of those lights in the ceilings are too close to the wall, mantle, cabinet, etc.  Check the standard mins (about 2 feet) to keep from casting shadows down a wall.  It magnifies any slight imperfection in the wall surface and casts deep shadows on anything mounted there.
Love the big poster that you all made together.  You should keep that to hang in the mansion next Easter.
should have sat on the workbench !
Hell yeah back at it at the Re-Imagined Mansion
That house is an engineering juggernaut
Xn.k
Źgj9kbbw3eeee       khh with   a y9g not    ,oils
Whats your plan to replace dead lights in some of these ceilings? LED's may last longer but they do die as well.
Blessed beyond your wildest imaginations or expectations ❤️ GO God ❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations To The Entire Carr Family! Looks Great!
Looks amazing!!
Looking good can’t wait to see end result but be good to see if you think of ideas for the rest of the property like a nice quiet play area by the water
super psyched for ya! that was actually fast since last inside view. that is a ton of SQ FT to cover
At the rate you’re going Matt, you and the fam will be moved in by Thanksgiving, congrats!
Start calling it top-rock house
Congrats on the beautiful house!
Congrats
Electrician here. Pendant light boxes don’t get set until the trim out that way you can center them perfect above the island
new series : renovating a abandoned casttle
The salesman is back. We are going to save them all ya right.
Was here for update on the house...  got much more
We're getting a before and after, right?
300 darts for $300, dang the ammo shortage even hot Nerf!
Looking great guys
You are such an amazing dad! It gives me so much joy watching your videos and getting more inspired to be just as positive😉🤗
Lincoln should grow a mullet like if You agree
love to see you with the family Matt,  don't call it the big house that's just wrong, call it horizon ranch 😊
You guys should do like a doughnut parking lot with a Big water fountain the the middle 👌🏼
Wholesome. :)  Also cool to see that Lincoln is interested in mathematics!
Don't know if it matter but Sheetrock is a trade marked name and you may want to change your title to "The Drywall is DONE!!!!!" Like I said don't know if there could be legal consequences at all just figured I would let you know.
I still like " hilltop ranch" for a name
is mere acutally 7'
Funny my boy does the same he makes lists for us to do.
8:43 ummmm
Cummins swap the Ford! #fummins
He needs a list with a googolplex of things to do.
its all thanks to your wife,    remember she did everything
Oof, look at the tips quickly! There are knock off nerf darts with either really hard tips or even hard plastic! Idk what the trustworthyness is of amazon in that case..
Just drove past the bunker in my big rig.
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self ✌️
You came up with the perfect name @OffTheRanch.. The Big House...
I’ve been watching Matt back when Mere was noticeably annoyed with his videos.... fast forward to the millions he’s made, and she’s not annoyed anymore.....   “how do you like me now!!”   Lol
Whatever...you don’t even know...says the adult.  🤣
You guys need to incorporate that table/bench thing that you were sitting on into your decor. Somehow. Stain it, paint it, etc. it has a back story!
*Don't be so dismissive about saying "we good there" because your house is built on rock, The corvette museum was too and you saw what happened to it in 2014. unless the USGS has come out and taken samples and drilled in and checked for caverns and such ALWAYS keep in mind that on any given day the whole thing could just Disappear. not trying to scare you or anything but who would have ever imagined that the floor of the corvette museum would open up and swallow 8 one of a kind or rare corvettes. it was built on bedrock but over the years erosion and sizemic  activity or movement of the earth caused a cavern to form. that's when i learned that this whole area was subject to that same type of failure. Further study showed that the entire world  is subject to the same thing as the tectonic plates are constantly moving and shifting. more than likely you'll never see or know of that house falling apart or sinking in your lifetime but nothing is forever*
That Ford is way cooler then a Cummins for multiple reasons example the transmission......
Big house..sell it now!
Awesome!!!
Have fun changing a light on that tall sealing 😅😂
3:18 she looks like mere
Is the garage coming together too
With some of the new waterproofing systems blue board isn't as bad but I prefer concrete backer board myself but, as long as you use a water proofing system or membrane, you can almost, just use drywall anymore! Not really, but, the new waterproofing systems/ membranes are so good, you technically could if you chose to!
Can’t wait to see it finished!!
It's really nice. I like the time that you were coloring with the kids and they did some really nice pictures but the house looks great can't wait to see it all
Matt, save that table, just warnish it (but keep the look), it would be a wonderful reminder of the journey.
Can't wait to see what kind of magic Mere does with the decorating!
Sheetrockers buried something well color me surprised
Dude The House of the Rising Sun is shaping up!
@9:12 how do you plan on cleaning the top windows? and how often? I wouldnt trust my ability to climb and work in that height.  You guys are awesome and a testament for for you statement "do something today that makes you better tomorrow" Thank you for giving us an example that with work everything is possible.
On the dining room ceiling I kinda wish yall sheet rocked behind the beams. It looked so cool
"Demo Manor" looks great! Have to say I'm kind of disappointed you covered up the amazing woodwork in the two domed ceilings, though. Ah well.
Meredith is one of those rare creatures that gets more beautiful with age...
The Easter truck could also be a Easter 5 ton. Matt probably wanted to draw the 5 ton and be able to get away with it.
best house i lovvvve it
Beautiful family + beautiful house = awesome
That looks so good. It's gonna be great for the family.
I'm first
1:08 thats so cute
You have a beautiful family Matt :)
"Mere doesn't like any of my ideas."   Says the guy that convinced her to buy a rotted abandoned mansion that she's now going to be decorating so you can move into it.  Right.
Not complaining, but in the 2 story room you should’ve put bigger windows on the second story part...
7 feet!! What?!?!
Some more rich ppl showing off how much more richer they are then the next rich person and reminding the poor ppl how much poorer we are then the rest of the world.  Nice flex. Can’t say if I could I wouldn’t do the same. Just wouldn’t show it off to the whole world
This house is litterally an architectual disaster.  Alle those different window sizes and weird angles are just an eyesoar. Seems like ten different designers just threw around ideas and settled with it being random.   Big, sure.... but ugly house.  Hope they mange to make it comfy and Nice inside at least.
I cant believe if been watching this for over a year now. Most of my relationships haven't lasted this long..
How much did it cost to redo the house
Name suggestion: Hill House Project (or just Hill House)
Hey matt, I think when this abandoned mansion is done you should buy another.. 😁 Because its fun watch..
Why is this in my recommendation?
Matt should find a way to refurnish the “table” they used in the first abandoned mansion video
Yay!
Im so excited to see this finished!
The renovated mansion?
Im so excited to see how you guys decorate this place!!!
What's sheetrock? Plasterboard?
You just earned a lot of respect! Super daddy!
i remember a year or so ago. Lincoln was so small
11:05 When they are teenagers, you are going to be an idiot and they won't want to hang with you! Remember?
Alien Eggs!
I contacted Policy genius and received a quote. They were awesome and am looking forward to working with them. Thanks!
your kids drawing crosses ? what happened to them ? 😂😂😂
I actually want to see the view from INSIDE the house. Imagine waking up to it everyday...😌
Inside their mind The husban: I love this place and my family The wife: I hate him, so childish omg. I need a lawyer Asap
thank you for reminding me to take time out of my day to spend quality time with my kids
Mere’s happier about the house now, it’s great. Excited for the Barn Raising videos...
just fyi a googol can be pronounced as Google. Your kid is one smart cookie!
Already missing the style of the abandoned mansion videos
CONGRATS  on reaching  this HUGE stage of building ( rebuilding?!? ) your home!  There's still alot to do, but l think  after all you have had to do to get to this point you  should be very proud of yourselves!  Take care and we shall see',,  you next time!! Peace to all....💜💙💜
Just walking around the "mansion" you would easily get all 10,000 steps per day.
Refreshing to see kids learning about Easter. Super happy for you and your family.
Please tell me you're not tiling directly on the sheet rock... Blue or not, it'll rot.
i bet matt wold put camo as decoration lol
Him saying look at that view is starting to get a tad annoying...... BUT LOOK AT THE VIEW!!!!!!!!
Call it renovation or reno ranch.
Never heard anybody call it Sheetrock, cool!
Episodes of Mare's interior decoration should have a special title... Deco Ranch?
Amazing sheet rock!
House On A Hill!
Hey Matt why did you not put concrete board in the showers blue sheetrock is mold and mildew resistant and doesn't do well in wet conditions. I do tile showers in Oklahoma
That's got to be about a $50,000 drywall job. I wouldn't touch it for any less.
Love it❤️❤️❤️
You know Matt, if you continued this series but under a different name, you could make a playlist of all the "not a mansion" updates. It would be like season two of a TV show. Abandoned Mansion being season 1. I know crazy right? Would never work. Forget I mentioned it. 😁
man that is so much drywall.  you should've researched alternatives to interior walls other than drywall.
3:45 Linc: "that's ACTULLY good"
Mere´s Lair?
Looking good!!! almost there! keep it up!
Is it just me or Matt like the greatest dad ever?
table needs to become a piece of furniture in the house
Sooo when is the interior ranch series starting?...
Mere is not 7' tall, coz She's definitely a 10
I will never be this lucky... be greatfull for what you have.. some of us never will .... N x
It’s really happening!!!
Mere should make a thing like renovation ranch and do interior design
When are you  going to explore the cave on your property?
Trouble house, but very well worth all the hard work. Look at what you guys have accomplished,  and I very much thank you for the journey,  soooooo cool. Now get er done can't wait to see it finished. He he.
Matt you and your kids paying warmed my heart. Being a X drywaller when I was young! I can tell you that the SHEETROCK isn't done, long way to go yet!  House looks beautiful and the view makes me smile ever time you show it.
23ft tall. Am I right? Do I get a prize?
Okay now these videos are just jumping up unnamed at all.  I can see you (or probably your wife LOL)  not liking to call it the abandoned mansion any more, but you gotta think up something better.  Call it our new dream home or the pretty view place or something.  Please help me out here LOLOL.
Yay !!! We’re coming along ... can’t wait for Mere to work her magic in your beautiful home. Peace and big love 🎊🔆🌸🪶🎉🕊🌟🪔🥳
Meredith 7 feet tall ? 😳
Love seeing the mansion.
Wish you showed some of the electrical side I’m an electrician from the uk and wanted to see the difference 😭
Matt, with this huge kitchen, you should do cooking streams once in a while! haha
Take that sheet rock out of your shower and put up Cement base sheets!
Put a Cummins in the Ford
Wish he’d just say drywall like the rest of us normal people
Been here since day 1
🇺🇦🇺🇲👍👍👍👍👍
I wish I can get 300 bullets for $15
300 need darts on Monday, and on Tuesday there's 17 left
3:35 no no no Linc, that's the Easter Bunny's 5ton
Matt did you ever figure out why it was left and who originally owned it?
New series title suggestion = Carriker Ranch: Welcome Home
The UN-ABANDONED MANSION is no longer the ugly duckling! ! ! !  Looooking goood! ! ! !
👍
Shooot I’ve been outsmarted by a kid who is still losing teeth
Its crazy for how long it has been
Welcome to decoration ranch
Wow Linc, that's like a week of activity for me
The dog is like "bro load up?" Naw thats a pool and im not falling for that again, you load up man 😂😂
You chose the wrong path being a vet, drawing skills on point
Lincoln's list is adorable 😭💙
Lincoln's list is adorable 😭💙
I swear you and your family are a national treasure!
I wish i was young again. The house is going to be beautiful
Buy nerf bullets.       yes. your child is smart
Great video you 2.....Love any & everything about the new mansion.....Keep'em coming.
Have the original builder/ owners been to the site since you've made all the improvements?  Been watching since the beginning, love it... Congratulations to the both of you.... God bless...
decoration mansion inc!!
Fun fact I was born on Easter Sunday and this year it was Easter as well
And the Father of the Year award goes to...
What the square footage now ?
Roughly 24 ft ceilings based of 6 levels of Drywall.
The commentary from the kids on the truck was hilarious
340 sensitive liberals didn’t like this awesome video!!
So, linc basically said that the law on bullets (nerf bullets, whatever) is stupid... You know what they say "if you want to her the truth, you'll hear it from a child" the government should listen to linc!   Know what? Linc should be president!
I wonder if the previous owners have watched any of these
Post a vid of stocking up the bunker with the guns
Dang I'd have had the shower in the tower lol
Good God are the your rooms high!
How much of this renovation was funded by YouTube?
Mere is 7 ft tall? What?
Can you just imagine the 5 ton wrapped in pink.....
Matt, get a lovesac sectional for the movie room. You can piece it together and get as many as you want plus ottomans so you can make it almost like a huge bed. Best purchase I've ever made.
Congratulations!
damn.... lincon be smarter than me
Linc is a spitting image of Matt, has 90% of Mere's personality but that little 10% with his "I'm not listening to that, that's just dumb rules" is completely Matt
8:50 How are you going to clean those windows?
Why the little tiny windows in such a tall room? Pull those out and put something huge in there to bring in all that great light!
Very cool to see what you've done with the place, dude.  I hope the original designers and owners are watching so that they can see their visions finally come to life along with you.
Gosh your kids are ruthless 😂😂
We want to see the view we also enjoy seeing the progress your contractor's make.
Yay another video of “Matt & Mere make a mansion” & yes bro it is a mansion 🙃
American Easter is trash garbage poo poo  balkan ester id dope tho
Like the new crib....😎😍
post the heating bill a year later xd
It's going to be beautiful!   ? who is going to clean that monster!  LOL
yay jusy YAY!
The drywall is awesome!
Looking Good , now Gallons of Paint, buy in bulk get good discount. Loads of soil or spoil to up the grade around the house to make level. Still lots to do. good luck.
Dude so funny two years in Mere is more optimistic then you are! Lol
The Big House!!!
Love seeing everything come together! Can’t wait to see Mere decorate the house! 😉😍
WOW.... That is like the only word I have.
Anyone noticed that anny‘s easter bunny has honda badges as eyes
Let's see,  three minutes at $100 a  minute for veterinarian charges would be  $300, but I'm sure your child has that much saved up from allowance, right. Just living the American dream. Lol. I'm kidding of course.
Matt=hardworker
Lol.. that’s not mountain due..😎
We all know Mere wears the trousers when it comes to the house renovation
8:14
Bro get him the vr oculus quest 2 and the game thrill of the fight, best boxing simulation game i’ve played
The renovated mansion
So good to see mere again, SO beautiful.
I wonder if the past owners watch these just to see what has became of the home.?  Would be interesting hearing what early happened and seeing what their dream looked like...
“I’m not listening to that, that’s just dumb rules” you have to make that into a shirt!
damn, y'all are at rich ass mofo status now!
Annie looks a lot like Mere.
Matt, are you going to put a texture on those walls to hide all the imperfections? As a finish drywaller with almost 20yrs experience I see a lot of issues in just the background shots on this video. I think you mistakenly hired a bunch of hacks. Still good to see the house coming together.
Damn look how big are Matt's kids, time really fly away
I hope everything works out for y'all that electric bill is going to be expensive
Did anybody else notice that Mar seems to have a genuine smile in this video.
What kind of texture are you going with. Knockdown everywhere would be awesome
Its been almost 2 yrs since you bought the abandon mansion, I had just started watching your YOUTUBE channel right before you bought it,crazy! I can't wait to see what Meredith does or how she is going to decorate everything, its gonna be beautiful!
Those lights above your counter in the kitchen the electrician has the wire there more than likely they will come in later and cut it in so they can center it to the counter
You defo need to keep that table for like a your workshop or refurbish it and use it in the house as like a momento
That will be one beautiful home.. congrats
Am i the only one that saw the inverted cross Lincoln drew at 4:40 🤣
Keep the table you sat on in the first episode and do something with it for the house!
Oh wowwwww, holy cow!
I hope you saved the list Lincoln wanted to do as well as all the pictures y’all drew and colored. Cherish those things in your heart. They grow up too fast.
"Look at that view".  Matt's favorite phrase.
That is a BAD ASS house!! Love that super large window...
Wonder if they sell it after it's done being renovated?????
Well I can say that the F-350 would look great.. next to a Cummins. If you can't decide just get both!
Go recliner couches in the tv room 2x3 seats, maybe even raise the back set a bit. Sectionals never fit right... In my experience.
Up north we call it drywall lol
NEW SERIES NAME SUGGESTIONS.....go!!!!!! - Manor on the Hill - Demolitia Manor - Mere's Monticello - The Villa with the View (I mean, look at that view) - Demolitia Dwelling - Domicile de Demolitia
How many square feet is the house? Was curious of how large it actually is. Architecturally any home 5,000 square feet and larger is considered a mansion. Some say it is 8,000 or more though.
You guys should definitely keep that table you sat on when you announced you bought the house, for sentimental reasons
I just love that the Ford is just 2 inch’s away from the garage door 😂
Lincoln already not listening to gun laws... MY MAN!!!
Omg that's to cute.
You have to keep that table for a memento
24 feet tall.
Inspiring job Matt and Mere. Watching from phillipines.
You need to give Merr a Red Bull before doing a reveal video....She’s sooooooo laidback.You can never tell if she’s happy.😂😂😂
Calling it the big house makes you sound like a slave master. Might wanna rethink that.
Why do u remind me of Colt Bennett?
Hay Matt, did you notice the VIEW?
I like how they think their house is old while my house in Philly is 2 centuries old…
Is this house technically built 20 years ago or is it now? 🧐
The 5 ton needs to be wrapped pink now :D haha
Mar has a look on her face that makes me think that she’s asking herself.Will this thing ever be done?
Lmao keep all the good trucks outside for show but the bad ones inside because your embarrassed of Ford's lol.
"That's just dumb rules".  Right Link...  dumb rules indeed.
Mare is going to have fun cleaning the place.
Cannot wait to see what Mere does with the house. It looks amazing so far.
Fine. Name it Meredith Manor
Mare looks cold
New Name: Making Mountain House with Spouse
Sticker shock is coming: Honey I just got the August electric bill !
It's a big, big house. It's my Father's house.
Looking good,still dont get the windows, sheetrock is past the timber windows, how do you finish the corner and why not just make the windows a bit deeper so it's flush with sheetrock?
You should make a video on what it costs to do a remodel on a house like yours
2:45 freaked me out when the kid says "tax and shipping" while staring into the camera without moving his lips!!!
When the interior decorating starts the episodes can be called "Decoration Ranch"
3:18 the way his daughter looked at him. Reminds me of mare when Matt does something stupid or asks something stupid
Lincoln’s voice sounds different now and it’s adorable!
Dude lincoln's drawing is better than mine
Mat, you are goals
You will have to change the start comic bit of your video now, both the cars in the silhouette you no longer own You shot this video on saturday the 3rd, but did not upload it until the 8th (thursday)
A castle fit for the king of the Demolitia
Oh yeah!  I really want to watch Mere decorate!  Thank you!
You should turn the “Easter Truck” into merch
“I’m not listening to that! That’s just dumb rules!” -Lincoln   I wish this worked with the ATF 😞  “Are you drawing my Easter Truck pink? You..are...related to...your Mom...” -Matt   I could FEEL that wound is still not healed.
So glad we get to see mere make the house come to life :)
Stunning house Matt and it is going to be a beautiful home.  You & Meredith deserve it after all the hard work you guys have put in, not only at the new house but, at the Practice and the Bunker.  Well done, you guys should be very proud!
only thing that comes to mind is heating costs. Looks good but heating is going to be an arm
Nice job
Thanks for sharing your house. I was sad u was not show the house . I love you show and you lt a happy family. Thanks for your time making the show.
Her vibe is always off
New interior decorating title idea for the house: Mere’s Ranch
Who doesn't want to see Mere make the home a place for good life's? Silly Mere keep the home.
Matt I can't explain how much I love this series! I've been studying for my home inspection certificate while following along with this series and it's been great seeing everything get put together! It has been a great motivator for my studying, and also an awesome reference guide to see something that I can't picture with my textbooks. I've worked doing this stuff but it's not always easy to recall things so being able to hit up one of the videos in the series and see the inside of a wall or something has been pretty helpful! Appreciate the hard work you put into this!
The mc mansion looks great
Your Easter truck is really Jeep Gladiator...just saying.
All that Sheetrock brought back the echo that you lost with the spray foam insulation. Now you need a ton of fabric to make the house quiet again!
When I was a kid 30 nerf darts were at least 8$ tell lincoln he is lucky lol
Mere is 7 ft tall?
Do a mares decorate series
On total home sound look in to snap av . They are the go to for sound and thing become a dealer
What plastic tub nooooo get cast iron
Addie: 'Theres no such thing as an Easter truck!' Matt: 'Yes there is!' Addie: 'Easter Eggs in it ..... really? They look like lumps of dirt!' RaHaHaHaHa
New drinking game. Every time Matt says “geez” or “dang” take a shot/drink
Watch it brother addie is gonna go tell mere that they aughta wrap the 5ton pink this time since you got rid of the raptor.
Yo matt is this why you didn't do the freedom 500 if so well done
Are y’all going to move into that house
Are you ready to see your amazing mansion!?!/ Mere...sure
CASA DEMOLITIA
Humble suggestion for the series rename: "Welcome to the Big House"
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't excited for you and Mere getting closer to the end of the journey.  You should consider natural rock around the fireplace in the big tall room, that would look nice and rustic.
Did anyone see the Sheetrock mud drying behind Matt’s head lol  That was a awsome video!!
why is it in America the plastering is so rough
I know this may get buried in comments but what about calling it the demoreno??
Linc's list is precious. What an awesome kid.
I would still call that a mansion
They're going to love that house so damn much when they finally move in considering all the hard work they put in, and the magnificent view they'll be rewarded with every day.
IT'S THE BANDAD MANSION!!!!
A big downfall of that 24 foot high ceiling in the formal living room is it costing hundreds of $s to replace a $3.00 light bulb..
You guys have come a long way . It’s amazing watching you and your family progress and love an amazing life !
Don't forget to instal C-Ram... That would be a perfect way to have a private fireworks performs 🤩
Thank you for sharing your house on the hill. To much is given much is expected, God bless you and the family. Thanks again.
I’m intrigued in the abandoned house let me know if you’re gonna sell it
Nice video .
Let's face it, this is a better end to the abandoned mansion than the ending of game of thrones.
hey pretty new to your channel love everything about it so far xxx
It beautiful that you take the time with your kids like that! You’re a great father and family man
Mere Vlogs, I'm here for this!
Put a cummins in the Ford as well so u have a fummins
Foundation is T H I C C !
its perfect dude
Read the notification at work thought it said she truck and Matt got Maere a truck
Upvote Matt needs to get a 4k recording setup!
Mer is gonna wrap that 5 ton in hot pink. Just you wait!
Spend the time with them now, the grow fast.  Loved the video.
My next question would be how are you going to change a lightbulb when they go out without a scissor lift?
It had taken a bit of time but you did everything right so it will last a long time and will need very few repairs.  I love it and yes I want to see Meredith decorate!!
Mate please just order a RAM... You need that Cummins.... Sell the Ford get the Cummins! Also your house needs a Cummins generator a 30kw bigger.
❗️❗️❗️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❗️❗️❗️    🤝🇷🇺
LOVE THE VIEW BRO
0:41 why is your Easter so early???
Plot twist: the mansion is haunted which is why they didn't finish building it 20 yrs ago ☠️
(5:30) check out a Googolplex! 10 to the power of 10 to the power 100! The zeros would fill the known universe!
Easter is my birthday
That high room you should put portraits of your family in their,like you seen in castles
(2:44) Kids never understand tax and shipping costs... and daddy's have to eat that cost like a CHAMP!
Thanks for the update.... glad you are showing this..... looking forward to seeing the finished product
Nice.
I hate to say it, but the windows seem to small in the big tall living room. :(
Holy crap she looks like your wife. Twins man lol wow
The foundation is solid, its on top of a mountain.... 🤔as long as tectonic plates don't shift and create other things...
Interior Mansion: Mere Edition
Great work now you need 8 more Demolition full beleivers neighbors to set up a Demolition fortress.
Tornado season is coming up, watch for clouds, and red slippers! Uh is Texas near Kansas?
Lookin good!!!!!
Firing a 50bmg in the not so abandoned mansion 😉😉😉
Whoa!   You guys did good.   Please, please keep showing your progress.  You guys keep our dreams alive.  👍❗️😎😃🥲
DAMN U matt.. Your crappy camera work has my vertigo raging !!!! Do some of us a favor and get lessons on how to make a video... maybe u just overly excited...
Those ceilings. Oh man. You guys built a mansion.
Damnnnn that’s huge!
Seeing you spend quality time with Linkin is absolutely adorable man, you're a genuine Dad and he's lucky to have you man 👏🏽
Why dent you buy the 1000 pack off Amazon
that dog said “nah bruh, you crazy if you think imma jump in”😂
@3:17 - If that isn't a Meredith look, IDK what is
😀
I don’t need life insurance, because I have something that is called free healthcare.
Let me know if you need a good trim carpenter i do it for a living look me up on google or Facebook Nick's custom trim and remodeling long time fan would love to do something there
Kitchen and 🛁Bathrooms 🚽 🧻🧴🧽🧼 FIRST!!!
It's a brand new 20 year old not abandoned mansion!! Looks amazing and have enjoyed this adventure with ya'll!!
What happened to Link's boxing?
Good man
Going to be fun watching videos shot from the mansion with the kids growing up.
Fancy house for a fancy man
I can't believe I've invested almost 2 years into this series haha
You’re right.   Watching other people work on your house wouldn’t be fun.  But it would be cool to see the delivery of the materials.  A normal house gets a pallet of Sheetrock. Matt’s house gets 17 pallets.  I would like to see how many gallons of paint this takes!!
Matt - Put the baby chic's water on a pave stone  so its above all the pine shavings to keep it clean . LOL  your welcome.
Log cabin style interior
Id love to fly out to you from England to do your bathroom tile work! 😍
In the garage you should do a demolition ranch epoxy floor🇺🇸🤘
Little guy looks at ammo restrictions and says "no those are just stupid rules" the pure honesty and straightforwardness. God bless this kid!
cant wait until its done
Have fun changing light bulbs when they go out! Im sure he already has a 50ft ladder :p
instead of rock on the wall of 'formal living room' wall, why not just attach an old first gen Cummins to the wall? Just hanging there in all its beauty?
I still think the "mansion" needs a name. I was thinking "Demo Hill" because it sits on top of a hill and its basic, sounds very WWI-WWII sounding. Like the history books would read "The brave soldiers fought their way up Demo Hill ..."
It's been cool that you shared all this with us, awesome to see you both kicking ass at life!
I love how you make time for your children. They will remember those special times. I promise.
In my Opinion: it is a Mansion haha   It's Huge (that's what Matt said)
She look more like MJ everytime you see her in an episode 🤣
Really ! 😂😂😂🐣💛
I can't wait to see it finished cause mare has good taste.
“We worked so harddddd paying people to rebuild our house!”
omg, 3:17 is 100 percnt a "Mere" look lol.
Love the family vlogs!! Enough of the cars, please!
I would SO be rocking a rooftop observatory on that place. But then I'd have to get a bigger telescope!
Matt : "The foundation is 2 times of what is required in the code" .... me heard "Something is buried here"
8:43 7 feet tall really?
Nothing better than a Dad hanging out with his children!
The kids are adorable Matt, proper dad inspiration 🥲
👍
Matt — a few words of advice. Let the kids climb all over you as long as they want to in life. There will come a time when they are grown and you will cherish every memory of them doing so.
How about just adding a "Not" before the Abandoned Mansion in the title?
Ford good choice!
thank you for the update, keep em coming ...
bro i think u should change the humvee  by the 5 ton in the intro  what say people  hit the like if agree
Jeez... This has to be at least 4 Mere tall !
Can my believe he covered up the amazing wood pointed roof in the main roof
I expect a unboxing video of those darts!😎
you really need to teach your son how to spell
TIL Mere is 2,1336m tall. American girls are different.
Ha!ha!ha! Easter truck carrying eggs 🥚 whatever works x
If the name abandon mansion is no more, let's call it "Eagle Ranch"!
Hill Top Manor!
yesssssss love this series
We good there.....ebonics. lol!
Save that table lol
so cool to see the un-abandoned mansion finally coming together. this has been a great journey to watch unfold. thanks Matt!!
"You can't even tell how high this room is."  *Mere will fit in the fire place, standing* OH DAMN! That's a tall room!  You need to put in a climbing wall!
Thats going to be an epic shed when you're through :)
You are going to be nothing but cleaning up nerd darts for the next decade XD
Meredith looks so over it! Lol!
"Buy more Nerf bullets"  I know your pain Lincoln, I know your pain......
01:01 That list should get framed
it’s officially forward of before
😁👍
Hey Matt. Big fan of your Demoranch/Off The Ranch channels for quite some years. It would be an awesome idea to update the intro and include the 5-ton, Chief, Earl and even El Chromino! Keep up the excellent content!
Reclaimed mansion!
You should get to decorate the youtube apartment
4:25 the best part of the video, brings back memories of Matt at the airport and his suprise!
Doggy looking back at Matt: no Matt, just no
I know that you guys kinda cringe about the word mansion but you should just call it the sunset mansion that would be incredible
Can’t wait to see it done!!!
Matts drawing is low key amazing😅
You can fit the five ton inside of your house!!! What a coincidence!😏
Getting furniture in this house is gonna be a B**ch
Great thing take time.
You should call the show :  Finishing the panoramhouse  😁😉
The sheet wall really makes the place looks huuuuge
I love how Mere knows exactly what interior design accents are going. Though I’m pretty sure she has been designing the inside since Matt started with the outside.
9:00 matt misses perfectly good dad joke about being a stud
HGTV is gonna be calling😂 "On this episode of Mere&Matt home makeover"
Uhm, this is not to scare you but this is just a trauma I have cuz of moving into houses that have been empty for a long time. PLEASE get an exorcist to go through your house before you move in
Get honeycomb blackout blinds for that movie night room. They fit into the window frames and there's no light leakage from the outside at all. Even full sunshine won't come through. You can also get cordless ones. Do that. Much safer for kids too.
7ft lol
Just wait until its all finished; then the government comes in and says they want a piece of it.. values it at 1.something million and you get taxed on that valuation.  How fun! :-(
Remember when Mare walked around for mor than 1 second without her arms crossed? Neither do I.
Matt keep that table!!!!!! You can look back on it in 10 or 20 years and think wow life is crazy.
Just gotta say that garage door was awfully close to that truck😂 wonder if it scratches the truck going up or if it a satisfying perfect fit and doesnt touches i need to know
Don't know what advice you had but I think waterproof concreate board is a much better choice than water resistant blue drywall for wet areas. Retiling showers is really a pain.
Nice house. And I've never realized how much the kids look like mere it's crazy. Don't see u at all in them Matt lol
Can you makes a second season of the series. I miss it already
He needs some reclaimed barn wood accents and a wall or two. Maybe some stone on the inside too. I hope he doesn’t skimp on trim work
You could have got a Ford with a Cummins engine🤪 it's true Ford did own a part of Cummins and you used to be able to get a Cummins engine in a Ford
Sooo fun to witness it all!
omg Lincoln said "with a google things on it", does Lincoln like math? I love math!
Lincoln is the best! I love you Lincoln! ❤️❤️
Don't know why I am interested in someone building his house?
If my future wife and I don't have the same energy as you two do, life won't be worth living 💁🏼‍♂️
24' ceilings, daaaamn boi
Dang can wait to see it all together
Hey, Why don't you guys get Chip and Joanna Gaines to help you with the interior design?
Your home is looking epic! Looking forward to seeing all of the finishing touches. And, you certainly have the best views in the Hill Country.
I'm looking forward to you doing the landscaping and pool etc. Great great series
The place is soo huge I don't know why would anyone hesitate to call it Mansion especially Meredith.
Still need more dirt for a (sort of) level yard though 🤣
So I did drywall  finishing  for 15 years  and I'm wondering  why  your upper angles  are not taped  if u r using  crown  molding  it's understandable  as to why it wouldn't  be bed coated  and skimmed but no tape  coat is usually  a fire violation  in the different  states I've worked  in  so I'd like an answer  as to why the upper angles are not taped, upper angles meaning  the corners between  a wall and a ceiling
“Do you remember” the 21st night of September oh shiiiiii
Are sheetrock and drywall the same thing? I've always called it drywall so I looked it up and turns out Sheetrock is a brand name. All the Drywallers can rest easy knowing they won't have to use the vaguely suggestive title of Sheet Rocker. Sheet rocking would be different skill set.
For people who have just come to see the update on the Abandoned Mansion, it starts at 8:14. Thank me later.
The TVs should all be a lot lower on the walls... Your eyeline when seated is supposed to be lined up with the lower 3rd of the screen for best results. Over the mantle is one of the worst spots unless you have an articulating mount that can pull out and down.
You don’t look like a homosexual to me, but the ford says otherwise.
Matt you forgot the parent fee on the nurf dart - I think it’s another $5 more on top
What I wanna see if how you end up doing the landscaping! I remember that model video you shared a while back of a possible layout, but I wanna see what it looks like in real life when it's done!
"that's not an Easter truck" "whatever you don't Evan know" 😂🤣😂
I love Mere and you also Dr. Matt!!! Great series!!!! I can't wait to see the interior to be finished!!
8.43: she's 7ft tall 😳.....
Can you imagine if they would have sold this property snd not went through with the remodel.
Dude when you're done with this house you should buy another and rebuild it and flip it.
14.20 "Do you remember" when it was time in september, o you werent gonna say that. Sad
Are you building a shop on the new house lot to park the dodges 😁😉
Almost
It starting to look like a house
You gotta keep that table if it's stayed this long coffee table or something
have fun changing can lights.  Shattered glass everywhere.
Once you guys finish the house you should invite the previous owner back!!
Google is supposedly actually named after Googol.
Dude, call it Demo-manor or Demo-state ....
You are related to your mom  lol 😂
Mere seems to like it better now .... :) Hello from Thailand.
For all the projects Matt has I am SO proud and happy that this house is looking amazing. I think this is like the first time I’m actually seeing how BIG it truly is. That’s quite a project and I’m happy to see it so close to being finished. Way to go Matt!!!
I saw the hand writing of an 8 year old and I hate myself because it’s better than mine and I’m 19
What does eggs makes easter..?  You remember thay Jesus died for or sins and that He rise up so He can forgive us!   Nothing with eggs and bunny's, this is not what Jesus want... He want that we remember Him in silence, and pray.
It was really cool to meet you man. We were flying out of SLC and I was walking with son, looked up, and went 'holy crap, It's Matt!' Then I see Mere and the kids. And I apologize for bothering you, I'm sure it gets old having random people come up to you when you're out and about, but my son said I had to at least go say hi as he knows I'm a fan of your videos. Hope you guys have a great trip, enjoy the snow
You should have a mural painted in the bedroom on the curved part!
Like the subtle jab at mere wrapping your truck pink 😂
Listen to the intro at .5 or .75 playback it hits different
Matt the Trader...stabbed us all in the back when he just up and stopped the Mansion videos...what a letdown we all watched hours to get to end and he just pulled the plug!👀👎👎👎👎😡😡😡😡😡
Greetings from Estonia 🇪🇪  That’s perfect!!!!
I read this as sheeeeeee-trock
13:19 mar looks so like her kids
"Eggs? Really??"😂
So Cool to See More of the Big House!!!  (Not Abandoned)...... I wish I was related somehow...........
Love the reference to the pink raptor
I love and respect you so much  for showing your kids to know about God and accept him as his lord and savior you really are a true inspiration
That truck will be betteron a shirt
Congrats 💯🔥
Aww Matt, you'll be a huge help with the interior decorating... someone has to do the painting, carry all those large bolts of fabric and move the heavy furniture, lol
How old is he
Its awesome how much your kids enjoy doing stuff with you!
I been looking forward to the abandoned mansion videos. Lol I'm here til the very end
13:35 Decoration Ranch here we come!!! Staring: Mere Carricker (I hope I spelt that right...)
matt needs an office that has camo wallpaper
Loved the Easter pictures.
Can i reccomend an U shaoe couch instead of a L shape
Is it too late to put an intercom in each room?!
Loved Lincoln's list!
Would love to see a build by SXSBlog for a UTV for the new ranch. Maybe like a 4 door General XP build or something. Your colaborations or great. And they seem like great dudes.
Looks great! I worked on rebuilding a store back in the 90's. Started out as a 25'x40' single story structure on a full basement foundation. Ended up designing and building a two story structure on that foundation after finding that the current structure was unsuitable to build on being old and unworthy. Cool part was that the second story was basically a loft that ran 2/3rds of the length with a staircase on each side, so there was this 'grand open space at the first 1/3rd of the entrance. That huge room you have would be perfect to do something like that and do a two story fireplace, one above the other on the loft floor.
The fact that I’ve been watching this for two years make me feel like I’ve wasted a lot of time 😂
His kids drawing crosses was heartwarming :)
24 feet to the ceiling, if you count the sheets of rock..  great job guys
Happy wife happy life bro. Lol
I can see a rock climbing wall and abseiling rig being put in the formal lounge.
As cringie as it may be, this is a freakin manshion dude!😁
In America do they not Plaster over all of the sheetrock??
Wow on the house fing amazing
So are you going to fly cleetus down to change your lights in that 900 foot celling?
Man did you see at 3:20 when your daughter looked up at you? That is 100% Mer. Holy cow.
🙏
That was an impossible drawing to guess. 😂😂
2:26 - Mini-Mer in the background wondering what mayhem the boys are going to get into with 300 Nerf bullets. Oh, wait. Don't tell Mer.
You've got to keep the table on which u sat in the first episode 🤔
Small chance you’ll see this, but I’m a painter for a living, and would love to travel for painting the abandoned mansion. Would be cool to integrate your subscribers with the build.
It's Texas not Alaska,  your 5 ton won't rust in Texas. Throw a tarp on it.
Well done . "Do one thing today that makes tomorrow better then yesterday".
Wait, why are there so many rams?
CONGRATS!!!  Hope it doesn’t take another year to finish.
7:14 whats with the guitar
Mere’s face is so excited and happy now. When you all bought it. She was like omg wtf matt. lol
Does anyone know the type of stone he used on the house??
Who cares about Bob the builder when you have Brandon the welder!
Yall should call the new place the carriker casa
Thank you for the update! Ain’t gonna lie, I miss the abandoned mansion videos
He said Mere is 7 feet tall...  Come on people... we can make that a "fact" on Wikipedia and everywhere else, if we all do our part......  to the interwebz!!
Dang, those ceilings look 20 feet tall
Is that Easter Truck a spoiler for an Easter 2022 Shirt?
It's gorgeous already!
I can’t wait to see Mer decorate!!
Keep it up!!!
Happy for you guys!!
We to,d you it would be epic and it’s going to be!!!! Nice Job!!!
Don't forget to show us the landscaping too!!!!
your kids are so mine to you
Expect to see nail heads popping through
Sorry Man. This s**t has now gotten old.
Lincoln: i’m not listening to that that’s just dumb rules  matt: yeah your right 😂
Yay, more house videos! :D
Sooo... What's gonna be the asking price when it's done?
Yaaaaaayyyyyy
I think the outro should be the new intro!
Once the Sheetrock goes up, that’s when the exciting part of flipping a house starts
He looks like mum, she looks like dad. So 😍 😊
The tips of those off brand nerf bullet sure are harder than the normal ones have fun getting shot 🤣🤣
Actually googol is pronounced google. Google wanted to represent googol but misspelled it
Looks awesome brotha!!! One step closer
Hilltop-ranch is gonna be great at the end :D
Honestly man I’m so happy for you, seeing Mere just as happy as you are about something  finally is great to see😂 but for real man congrats, can’t wait to see the progress!
When you realize that mat has been saving for so long to build this lol
No offense but heating/cooling that is gonna be crazy high
You could put a rock climbing wall above the fireplace!
Lincoln really is a mini Matt
You've got to save that table and use it in the garage or somewhere!! So much sentimental value and it belongs to the house!
I mean, we can tell how tall it is, we can see the tape lines and drywall comes in standard dimensions. looks great though.
Lincoln’s spelling could use some work, but his drawings are better than mine and I’m 20
you could call it the Renovated Mansion: abandoned mansion second season
Not gonna lie - when you just out of the blue said there would be no more abandoned mansion videos, I was like "whoa that was an abrupt and slightly rude way to end this journey." But then I thought about how stalker-ish the internet can get and I figured it was time to set some boundaries around the new home. Either way - I'm happy that you're still doing these videos, but I'll completely understand when it comes time to move on to the next chapter.
Can't wait 🥰 I all so want to see the out door landscape disaen the pool Can't wait.
Lincoln: That's actually good.  Ah, the brutally barbed compliments from children.
278 jealous people who gave thumbs down. Go grab your tissues, sit in the corner and put your thumb in your mouth you cry babies.
Love the pink Raptor reference.
Let's not overlook matt's drawing, that was actually pretty good
Stars above the tub on the vaulted ceiling.
Little do they know they say the "foundation is great" but they built it on top a undiscovered volcano. Just imagine that Matt
Dude when this is done!...Just own it bud and call it what it is... a Mansion
Now you’re going to need to keep that table forever.
Did you keep the art that was outside in tile?
“You guys don’t care about the view. You want to see the sheet rock!” Lol
“Watch out for tornado, he’s heavy” 😂😂
Nice little house on the hill...
As a person who is in the house building industry... It is now that your bank account will substantially start to beg you to stop the pain lol.  I get that you have your window and door packages done, but the sheer amount of room you will fill with tv, furnishings, appliances, paint, trim! Oh boy! That alone is a hunda thousand plus boys. Love it!
You HAVE to keep that table in the finished house, hopefully in that room.
The fact that your going to need a scissor lift to change the light bulbs in your house 😂
I smiled the whole episode ☺ TY
Decoration ranch! With Mere...
It's already been almost 2 years
"Are you drawing my Easter truck pink? You are related to your mom." Nice throwback to the pink wrap! 😂
Please please PLEASE get life insurance and make sure you go over every SINGLE detail. I recently lost my step father to a sudden heart attack and I can not express to you how much of a pain his life insurance has been to my Mother. She has had to do so much because he did not go over every detail.
That was actually the video that introduced me to your channel and I’ve enjoyed the content glad I saw that video in my recommended that day
So how many months left til you guys are in there? Also super excited to see all the rooms in their final state. I'm intrigued by what style choice mere is gonna pick.
Looks awesome.  I’m very happy to watch you guys build your dream house.  I found your channel with the first vid of the née house.  Then I found the vet ranch stuff (totally cool I love it) then I found demo ranch, mich more my silliness 😁.  Thanks for you work, and merr better not listen to you and make your home beautiful, cause I know you won’t...   cool, but not beautiful 😁
The episode the day after they move: Can A .50 cal Go Though An Entire House? (Seriously.....Dont tell Mer)
Matt, what did you do with the fluffy white doggie that you didn't like?
Annie looks just like mere! And your son is the mix of you guys!
i cant tell if the house is matt's or mare's
Looks great needs more gun racks
Dang Matt your going grey fast there bud, Silver fox inc....lol
licon is matur
4:31 Damn that bunny is THICC!!
but imagine if you had a ram so then you could get the mega cab
hate to tell you that its probably not mtn dew in that bottle
MATT! the shower's head is way too high... trust me... terrible idea. water cold by the time it hits you.
I'm just curious what the final cost of everything is. We've been trying to buy a house big enough for our needs but it's incredibly difficult.
"That's just dumb rules".........I think this kid is smart.
Your kids are mean
Hey mat I didnt watch your new truck video but I noticed it's a Ford 2500 i think? Point is if you havent named it yet I think you should name it rex because it's a bigger version of the raptor
AWESOME!
How to afford an abandoned mansion. ...charge your son $300 for 15 Nerf darts. 😁😁😁
100% power couple
"Its an Easter Truck" #Classic
Good place for a shop BBQ!!!
what about an indoor shooting range
Have to make the as an appraiser comment. Having lived in that area seriously consider lightning rods for the home. The family moments were too special. Very sweet.
Please hire an interior designer, make no mistake.
Honestly doesn’t feel like it’s been a year
Mere's Manor... not as pretentious as Mansion!
I hope you frame the easter truck drawing in the new garage lol
Omg this is so great!!!
i would not to clean  the rafter there
It’s no longer “the abandon mansion” it’s now Matt and mere’s mansion
She is definitely mares kid
Wow! That mansion is looking pretty good on the inside! Love the Tornado line lol
It’ll be really interesting to see how the city makes you determine the age of the house. They’ll probably make you age it as the initial build, so the house will be 20 years older on paper than it really is.
Link just drew an FJ 40 landcruiser. Get your facts straight dad!
If you owned a life insurance company, I'd be in
Why you have to ask your wife for any concession after you built this life for your family....
Good work Matt raising them right
she looked like mere when she looked back at you while coloring
I’m 13 and he knew what that number was first time I heard of it
Resto Ranch
It's Tape Bed Then we start Float
8:36 you're welcome
Great father dude
I wish I would have had a good dad like you Matt. Good Job!
Can’t wait for the demo ranch episode, “ how loud is the 50 cal inside the mansion”
Mere 7 ft tall??? I won't buy it ever
Can we get a video of JUST you spending time with your family? I would enjoy that a lot, please and thanks!
mere, 7 ft tall, matt 9 ft? #tallestfamilyever!
Put a ceiling fan in the kitchen, all cooks complain about how hot it gets in the kitchen and few have fans in them.
That's a pretty pink raptor you got there matt😂😂
so cool ! <3
It's great
You should have Obsessed Garage build you a dope garage
The new homestead is really starting to look sharp!  And considering both the size and condition of that "fixer-upper" you bought 2 years to this point ain't half bad! Another reason to be grateful you're in Texas.  Many of the other States _nothing_ would have been done except what you could do yourself because of the plandemic.
Ok but,,,,,, why were you not able to attend the freedom 500? You need to be at the next race!!
Get window tints that change electronically!!
Man enjoy seeing the Carriker family grow.  You guy are the best.  Man your kids are growing up so fast.  Hope you never stop making video.
And so begins the new episodes of the M&M MANSION of off the ranch!👍☺
Hi my name is Joe and I am a dog trainer and I would like to volunteer at your vet two trains in dogs please get back with me soon
how come you didnt put some huge windows on the big wall. instead of the 3 small windows up top
Cute beginning. Next time turn off the camera and enjoy that time with them. But that’s just me. I’m sure they like being part of your videos though.
@OffTheRanch if you’re still looking for a new name for this series, how about “Our House on a Hill”? Lol
Cant wait to see the finished house , its gonna be beautiful
cant wait to see you start landscaping your front and back yards.. that back area has soo much potential to be a killer yard with a overlook BBQ and swimming pool etc.
Absolutely great job 👏
I wanna see Mar's decorating but I would also really like to see her do a proper burnout in the el chromino once you sell 10000 shirts!
Matt I'm still hoping you reinstall that decorative hand painted tiles up somewhere in the house that would be amazing to keep a piece of Guanajuato in your home.
interior decoration ; Guns on every wall, a truck in the middle of the living area, gun and truck parephenalia throughout the entire house basicly, nailed it.
That's good bro
Do you ever go to work at the vet office?
Hey I love your videos, FYI  your shower and tubs need concrete board durock   , t he at blue sheet rock will only last 5 yrs
It’s drywall... ITS CALLED DRYWALL
who else still watches to the end of EVERY video to not only see Mark but to see him give Matt the business?
Ive been watching the whole Abandoned Mansion since the beginning. From the vid with Furious Pete making jokes about buying it, to seeing it now has been a crazy cool experience. Can't wait to see the finished product 💪👍
This will be awesome, glad u guys didn't give up
I think you made a mistake a year ago, and i will tell you why, when you invited us in to your abandoned mansion and called us all family, you probably didnt realise that we took you at your word, so seeing as we are one big family, and have watched the house come good, your going to have to get us a door key each, so when you get the locksmith to put a lock on the house, you better get him to make 441,164 spare keys, just make it a round 500,000 keys, then as family we can come round when we want watch TV when we want, feed the dogs, and munch down on all your snacks. Dont it make you feel all warm on the inside knowing you have all of us as family 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.
Great respect for how your rasing your family Matt.
I’m so excited to see how Mer decides to decorate & to see the finished product!! 🥰
Call it "Carriker Compound"!
Matt, did you ever find out who the original owner/builder of the abandoned mansion was?   Would be interesting to see their reaction to it being completed.
*Make available in 21:6 format please!*
Ima drywaller hang/tape/finish little confusion on the taping some of the hanging but sure
Being in the remodeling business, that dining room ceiling was not fun to mud I can garuntee that
GEEZUS your heat bill will be more than I make in a month.....
Just call it "Mere's House" and let her run the whole interior design series
Hate to tell you.  I have been through hundreds of builds. When the sheet rock goes up you are roughly half way done.  Sorry Matt.
"those don't look like eggs". Kids are so judgemental!
Yassss!!! Omg i cant wait to see Mere pick all the things!!  Mere- can you just take over and show us all your mood boards... take us along your journey of design?  You can be the main vlogger and matt can just make special appearances?!?! Hahaha 💚💚💚
So youre telling me they bought that mansion almost 2 YEARS AGO...WHAT
If you get a recliner it got to be a camouflage one,I’m sure it will fix the decore #donttellmere
That Ford will be traded for a Cummins by years end
Back in my day, 9.99 will buy you 20 overpriced nerf bullets
You didn't miss the boxes for the pendant lights - they get placed based off your counters - the wire is stapled above the drywall in a way that will make it easy to access wherever they need to be placed - within reason.
I wanna see the bunker too! But yeah mostly I wanna see what Mere does with it all lol. It's gonna be sooooooo amazing! The bunker too...
The Un-Abandoned Mansion
If that were my house I’d have someone paint the final supper on that beautiful arc first floor
Hey what camera is that number? Shut up dont tell mere.   I missed that part it's my favorite
Man badass... 💕
Weird.. here in canada you have to be 18 to buy darts
What happened to the tiles that were outside that you said you were going to save
Idc what you say, its still a mansion
How old are the kids now? They are so lively and cooler then I was when i was younger. Matt, you are a great dad. Wish I had one growing up.
that would have a been a nightmare for the plasterers.
Renovation Ranch.
Need cabinets, I got a custom cabinet shop need a bid
It's gonna be magnificent, I just know it.
How many days did it take to put all the sheet rock up?
why does your wife look super un en·thu·si·as·tic at times ?? is that just the way she is ?? shes cool tho just wondering
I'm so happy for your family. It's a great memory for all of you.
Looking awesome brother! Can't wait to see how Mere's interior concept turns out! Nothing short of beautiful, I'm sure. Love you guys.
now, the "Abandoned Mansion" doesn't look so abandoned.... great work! you are going to have some home when its all finished.... I love the great room! you need a rod iron chandlier in there... like King Arthur!
I am so glad the unabandoned giant house series is not over!
Amazing,
It would have been done by now if you had gotten your materials from McCoys Building Supply! 🙄😏
No walk in closet in the “magic” spot?
24 feet ceiling?! Wow
8:39 It's easy to tell how tall it is.  Sheet rock is 4 feet wide x 4 rows of rock + the height of your french door wall = approximately 25 feet tall.  Call it BUNKER HILL!!!!
The house's name should be adopted house.
Hey Matt if you really want to score some points with the wife contact HGTV and get a TV designer to come out and help her design the place, maybe Joanna Gains or Jasmine Roth or Mina Starsiack?? Just a thought! 😂😂 Good luck guys! It looks AMAZING!!! AND THAT VIEW!!
Looking very good. And very happy your going to keep us in the loop till the end..
Matt cool house but I dread thinking  about  operating  expenses
That's just dumb rules lol
Heads up Matt! In a couple years we're gonna be friends... sorry... it's true.
Y'all should really consider resurfacing and staining that rough table and keep it somewhere in the house for decor. Just as a reminder of how far you and the house have came on this journey. Personally I would love to have a piece like that in my home with the same sentimental value. It's a shame I didn't think of it years ago when it would have mattered to me and my family...
Dip the 5 ton in pink for your kids next Easter lol
Shoot a 50 cal in there like you did with your last house
That was so cool! Thank you.
Lets change the subject for just a half minute... Are we ever going to see you as a veterinarian again?
You need to keep that little table
where's the nice sunrise view
Sweeeeeet
Judging by the sheet rock it’s 24ft tall
I haven't been around much, are you still doing Vet ranch?
As an electrician I highly doubt your island pendants got missed. Typically what my company will do is snake the wire above the drywall then cut the holes center on the island once it’s built so your measurements are perfect. Then you just use a cut in box and boom you are done.
Time flies.
Don't tell Mere but as a married man of 27 years I'm onto you buddy.  Of course she doesn't like your ideas for decorating the house because as a married man you know exactly how to make that happen.  Step one: You have to suggest the ugliest, man cave'iest decor you can find, something you know your wife will hate.  Step two: Make it seem you're dead set on those ideas without pushing it to far, rinse and repeat.  Step three: She will of course at some point insist that she get's to do all the decor to stop your ridiculous ideas from being a part of your home.  Step four: You have to remember to compliment her on what she does making sure you point out how much better her ideas turned out.  Step five: Kick back and relax knowing you will never have to ever deal with interior decorating again unless there's something you really, really want... Sorry to all married men out there as I'm kinda letting the cat out of the bag a little bit but it's a win win. I mean what's your wife going to do let you get away with your crazy decor or do it her way, which of course is the right way as any happily married man will tell you... This place is going to be amazing and with Mere's tastes and how she's decorated your other homes I can't wait to see the end product...
I’m so glad we get to see continued work on the house and especially happy we get to see how Mere decorated and designs the interior and exterior!!   Kinda sad to see that curved wooden ceiling covered up though, I thought it looked super cool with all those exposed curved beams!!   Also is Mere really 7ft tall?! 😱   One more thing....is it possible for you to share the floor plan of this house? I’m a HUGE sims player and also play around with a house design simulator and would love to make this house on both the sims and the other house designing simulator I play around with. Would that be at all possible to get from you?? Just curious. If not I totally understand. ☺️   Anyway can’t wait to see more of these videos of this gorgeous house!! 🎉
Love the family 👪 time with the kids ! 😊👍💕💕💕
2:58 this ammo shortage hittin different boys
Seeing the sheetrock up is so satisfying! And Seeing you two reenact the first video 📹 ❤,  so nice 👌! 😊👍💕💕💕
Y’all should totally put an intercom system throughout the house so you can tell the kids when supper is ready
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TILE MURAL THAT YOU TOOK DOWN
Call it Mary
PLEASE for the sake of your neck please don't put the TV way above the fireplace in the movie watching room!! TVs are so much more comfortable to watch when theyre around head height when seated
"you are related to your mom"😭😭😭
Matt needs to get some big meaty tires on that new Ford
But nerf bullets is so Matt
have fun changing those light bulbs in the living room..looks amazing though!
How many nerf guns/nerf bullets can a pew pew go through
PLEASE save that table and redo it and put it somewhere in the finished house. It'd be a great memento for your journey.
Wow man who is going to paint all those walls??? Wow beautiful
In reguards to the time line of the house. Remember you have almost doubled the size of the house over what it was when you started.  The house and the view from the house is awesome!
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MANSION GIVEAWAY!
I recommend either 1 or 2 large L couches for that living room with the fire place, maybe a nice large coffee table in the middle.
Them darts have harder tips and actually sting a little in the better nerf guns. The really small double barrel pistol that is white/grey in color are savage toys. Amazon prime delivers on Easter.
I mean Geo Thermal Is pretty cool not gonna lie XD
When’s the backyard starting?
Go back &in this video and look at Mer's eyes in the big room when we get our first glimpse, the look in her eyes is astounding, you can see the colors papattes flashing in her minds eye, and the endless possibilities exploding in her brain, that is the look of an artist, like it or not, that is a rare beauty of the soul to behold....I'd love to ride down the Grand Canal of Venezia with her as she looks upon the great palaces assessing each one, at sunset so the lights are on and the colors are evolving from the blasting day sun to the glimmering touch of the moon reflected off the trickling waters in the lagoon.....
This whole project was fun to see progress from Destroyed to Distinguished .  It took some time to get to this point. BUT I can promise it will go faster than you expect from here out.  Next thing you know you will be moving in. What a house,  I bet it hasn't even set it yet that you will be living here in a few months.
Looking good
I'm glad your still showing house updates
That's actually good, LOL!
Lincoln has better handwriting than me.
Pretty boy truck
Yesss my fav episodes.
Two things, you have to incorporate that wood piece into the new house. Also how tall will the Christmas tree be?!?!!!
Dreams come true if you work hard❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
Mer’s Mega House Makeover  sounds nice 👍🏼 or Mer’s Mega Custom House makeover 🥰
They called the crackhouse the crackhouse even after they fixed it up so why can't this be the abandoned mansion
House is coming along. Happy for you guys.
Awe ❣happy ...so glad we've been seeing how it all turns out...love it👍...thanks Mat
"I'm not listening to that, that's just dumb rules" -perfection!
abandon manson out forever home in
The 5-Ton needs bunny ears for real.
You shod got him 1000 dart
Because it's business, guest quarters and equipment warehousing besides the residence, it deserves to be called an estate. The Unreal Estate.
Carriker Castle is looking good
You better keep up with the updates, PLEASE DO A FINANCIAL BREAKDOWN
Awesome artwork!
I work in tape n bed but that house is so huge and would take me a week or 2 to finish  Edit: once he showed around I correct myself probably 3
Mer is gonna want a big Christmas tree
I'm not sure what the surrounding landscape *actually* looks like, but it seems like your house may be the tallest point within several hundred yards. Is there a mitigation plan for lightning strikes? Maybe lightning rods on top of the tower, and corners of the roof. Main reason I say this, my father is an electronic technician that works on church organs. The steeples of churches are lightning rods, and he always has calls about lightning damage every week during the summer when storms are frequent. I'm concerned about lightning striking your not-mansion, and either damaging a wide host of electronics, or potentially starting a fire.
You can count how high the roof is by the rock. Its 24ft high. I always wanted a sectional couch with the bed on one side
Mere said all Camo furniture!!
What if you made another channel called mukbangranch but you only ate ranch.
Y'all's mansion is looking really sweet!!👍👍
Bro how you not have a theater room in a house that big. You kid would love it. With hookups to an Xbox and internet. Theater seats for the family. Popcorn machine. Old movie posters...u would not had missed that on purpose...🤔🤔
Super excited for this guy and his family what a good dude.
Why am I so damn happy for you and Mere and when my own life is crap? Sorry, just trying to think of something quirky to say :) But I am so so proud of what all you two have accomplished.
Those Mexicans did a great job
Awesome bonus post - Easter ✝🌷, kids, art, baby chickens🐤, AND the Sunrise Hill House 🌞 🏠. I was grinning the whole video. The sheetrock really brings to life that this house is becoming a home. Your sheetrock crew looks like they are masters of their trade - getting those wacky vaults done well is an art form. Yay!!! 😁🎉
Awsome ,Mere you got this, it will be great!
Can’t wait for the decorating!
On Easter my ant cut her Hand open and my uncles house got broken into and all his guns we’re stolen
With the rock wall I'd have them make an easy medium hard climbing rock wall. 🧗‍♂️
8:40 lmao 😂
How the fuck do you change the light bulbs in the 900 foot room?!?!?! 😳😳😳
Looks great guys it’s gonna be a 3 year build and probably then some the best is yet to come
You deserve it. You work crazy hard.
Not gonna lie. Big mistake getting rid of the shower tower...
I love it!! But one thing I would have done differently if possible is knock that wall out in between the kitchen and main living room and have it opened!
here we go..   😆
Nerf gun war inside the house before decorating
What mere means is 2 pendant lights in the kitchen
Talk to westen champlin about cummings swapping your ford.
Great job.
So glad I was able to watch you build your dream 🏡. Keep up the great content.
As a person who built their own house, I know exactly what that's like
What fun to see a craft activity with the children. Love the interactions.
to small
Electrical contractors cut in pendants with pop-in boxes for islands after the island is installed to make sure fixture spacing is even and similar install for bathroom vanity lighting.  Millwork/cabinets are laid out then the lighting is centered post install.
Im a taper and it looks really good
I just want to know which roof the machine gun nest is going up on.
Is Matt still a veterinarian?
Looks awesome Matt and your island lights probably weren’t forgotten they probably squiggled the wire in the ceiling and once the island is installed they will measure off it and laser a spot to drill for a box that way it’s perfect on the island and not off any
"I'm not listening to that, that's just dumb rules". Truly a great quote you're raising them right 🤣
Was that an April's fool joke?  Ahhh ya got me, I guess I'll have to subscribe again.
Looks fantastic, and being on the top of a mountain, ya don’t have to worry about a flood.
It's coming along!!!!
hope you put a big giant xmas tree in that vaulted living room
The sheet rock looks great but I would be lying if I said I wanted to see the sheet rock....I'm here to see Mere! Don't get me wrong Matt is pretty good but it is great to see Mere in more videos.I am a bit disappointed that I did not get to see the 5 ton though! I am also disappointed not to see Matt shooting a .50 Cal from inside the not so abandoned mansion..( I highly doubt Mere would approve lol ) I would also totally watch her decorating the not so abandoned OfftheRanch home! She could have her own series as well because she has some good decorating ideas.Thanks for bringing everyone along on this video series!
Wow looks so amazing guy's and im exited for y'all  YEE YEE
Now its starting to look like a house it looks awesome matt!
Should call it “Ask this old abandoned mansion” episode
It’s crazy to see Matt change from a scrub in his early videos to well Matt we have today. It’s kinda like seeing an older brother grow up
Dang this is really cool! 👍
The mighty moat socioeconomically identify because mint simplistically amuse despite a sweet cry. greedy, thoughtful department
I could fit my country home in your living room lol
Love the Easter 5 ton
You guys should build a indoor rock climbing wall
Daaaaaaamn, the ~extremely large house~ is looking great! Since I work in the furniture business, if Mere wants a big friggin' sectional, I would suggest checking out brands called Jackson or Klaussner, they make (rather heavy) large, comfortable sectionals. They're largest line of sectional is called the MONOLITH line.
House on the Hill series?
Easter truck shirt is all I'm saying
Amazon never sleeps
There's something about Meredith smiling that's so.... illuminating.
honestly I know I am late to comment but I am just thinking about how much me and my dad could make doing tilework in that house hahahaha.
When the power stoke blows up, do a Cummins swap! Fummins FTW!
Your daughters look SO much like Mere. Especially as they are growing up!
whats the difference between sheetrock and drywall?
Im in tears just lookin back on the past and laughing at all of Matt's dad jokes and Mere finding out what Matt did, and I can't wait for what the future holds!!
Speakers for surround sound!? You'd better install an intercom system so y'all can talk to each other in different rooms. Ooh, walkie talkies would be more fun, though ...
"McMansion Restoration"
haha Matt, your kids give you a pretty hard time....😅🤣👍
Hope you do level 5 and not monterrey texture
nice-looking house bro
Have fun changing those lights up there lol
Video idea look up runky tunkle chicken hopper bowl and recreate it
Im kinda curious i remember that piece of artwork they removed from the one chimney carefully the hand painted tiles, wondering if yall still have it and are gonna have that as an art piece or if everyone forgot about it? Lol
Matt can finally shoot guns in his house lol
The occupied larger than average house looks good
Thanks for showing us more of the Matt n Mere Abode, but I would of loved more on the HVAC plumbing n electrical work but don’t stop! And make sure you spend time with your kids they’re adorable and they grow up really fast!
Imagine if you abandoned it how it is right now.
Mere doesn't like any of my ideas.  "Hey Mere!  Let's hang truck nuts over every door!" "Hey Mere!  Let's side the house with Super-Bigfoot tires!" "Hey Mere!  Painting everything in Digital Camo would be great!  Right?" "Hey Mere?  Why did I just get served with divorce papers?"
I was so happy to see this video 😆
Matts drawing is perfect
Hey Matt, you shoukd jyst play off the Rescue dog or cat rescues all over the world, and do your videos as "The Rescue Home" or "The Rescue House"
Looking good.😁
I hope Tornado is a white chicken, that would be piss funny.
Matt the Foreman and Mere the Superintendent ........ just sayin' ...... ;-p
Damn Meredith has the glutes of a Budweiser Clydesdale 😝😝😝😝🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🦅Merica 👨🏾‍⚕️👩🏻‍⚕️🧁❄🧁❄❄🇻🇮🇻🇮🇻🇮🇻🇮🇻🇮🇻🇮💉💉💉💉🤢🤮🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳☻
When its done..... You’re having all of us over.....right ???
Hey Matt, How do we get Eggs from the Easter Bunny? Do Veterinarians know that one? And, how do Chocolate Bunnies Multiply?
just Wow! the house is looking awesome guys. Thank you so much for sharing this journey. so cool.
I love her enthusiasm to everything. It's kinda like mine. I could be really excited, but just deadpan say, "That's pretty fantastic.".
Heating and cooling all those vaulted ceiling-ed rooms...$$$$$.
Get that girl a waterfall around that fireplace Matt been a lonnnng time viewer . She’ll love it just don’t tell mere
What happened to Vet Ranch? Are you not doing that anymore?
Looks amazing! All that hard work will all be worth it!
Matt get a lovesac couch for the TV room you'll love it.
Casa CARRIKER coming along!!
Looks awesome just in Sheetrock
Matts lovely Easter lumps.
“Those do not look like eggs” had me dead 😂
Petition to get mare to let mat decorate their room?😂😂😂
we want MOAR!
Do you know who started to build the place and why they stopped? And why was it left vacant at that stage before being sealed up?
Poor Lincs watch is as big as he is. LOL
"Thats just dumb rules" best thing I've ever heard. as a lover of guns, and a young father you are raising Lincoln right❤
I thought she was short
Lets move on from the house remodel videos. Getting bored with this channel and some what with Demo Ranch period
Hey make the table you guys sat on into a coffee table or something to keep it around
#abilliontimes
The "formal living room" would be called a Great Room. Or a trophy room if you get some trophies in there. My vote is to call the whole place Demolition Manor.
Looking good MATT & MER---ON the MOUNTAIN MANSION !!!💚🖤🖤🖤💚
The commentating by this man is unmatched
Get black out curtains
So will your wife Being Naked! Just saying! lol No offence! lol
Put the tint like bunker for sun
I love how chilled your Mrs is ✌️
How could he have regret while having bought a brand new Ford
8:14 sheetwall
Easter truck should be a shirt!
Hope you all have a very blessed day!
Full size family house 🏠  Chickens 🐔 Garden 🌱🌻🌾 Beloved Homestead
Imagine demo teenilitia
The eggs in the back of the 5 ton is actually a bomb
Soooo what are you calling the series though?
When you ask people how they are doing and they say "livin the life". You believe Matt.
You have ducks in your ceiling, Matt?   🤠❤️
Wow looks great. Can't wait to see furnished. Best of luck
If you need interior and exterior doors I work at a mill work shop and we would be happy do help you out
Bronco
HELL YEH 👍👊
Little work table is good. Maybe it sneaks into the garage and gets used... or burned. If it’s not wobbly it might be worth keeping.
Mer always looks so mad to be in videos but I think she just has a huge R.B.F.
matt should have been an artist
Almost ready to decorate....do have a question....what purpose does high ceilings provide other than a place for heat to accumulate.
I got 1k bead darts $20 300 is amateur numbers
I've been saying for a year or so now your boy is pretty girly from hanging out with mom and his sisters and that you need to spend more time with him.. But it's kind of sad he actually had to write you a note to get you to do it
Totally 💯 easter eggs and an easter truck bruh 😎 happylate easter and its beautiful that your teaching religion ! So many do not even give that foundation to their children , its been something i fought asca child but i have fallen back on prayer 🙏 several time in my life i try to pray every  day i fall short but love the relationship i have been able to have with the good lord ! That house is amazing ! Beautiful family and home !
tip: do the curtains luxurious european style! so from wall to wall, on a rail on the ceiling. also: lengthy draped on the ground. not only above the windows with a cheap looking pole.
You're such a good daddy! I don't know how you do everything you do in a day Midas Matt!
Drywall finishing is no good
You should make that table you two sat on... Into an end table!!! Sand it, and stain it, to match Meredith’s interior decor!! Just saying!
Matt shows around the house and didn't show the safe room like every episode we wanna be jealous of it lol
Yall deserve every bit of what's coming! Love ya and hope to make a trip to the bunker soon! Ordering is fine and I always sniff the shirts and "almost" feel like I'm there.  Its just not good enough dangit! I need to smell the Bunker and Texas and Matt... umm no I didn't mean that last part but. SEE YA SOON!  YOURS TRULY THE weirdo STALKER FOLLOWER! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol, she pinked your truck. She learned by watching Mere.
As soon as I saw the pink crayon, I immediately had flashbacks to the raptor. 😂 you didn’t even have to mention it.
Gratz on 4mil subs
Wonderful house. Great job
Come on matt...been folloowing since you "ejected stuff ...out of "mass excellerators"..look at mere she loves mansion...make it your home....
Pretty sure its not called sheet rock
So excited for you and your fam
I once had a man tell me when  the outside of the house was done and the sheet rock was on we were half finished...both in time and money...I laughed.😆Unfortunately he was right!😢
Usually cut in island pendants in after do they will be directly above and centered
Remodeling is way more expensive and time consuming then new construction
Good hide that botched coat hanger abortion of mechanical and electrical work. Looking like a albatross
Mere needs to have the 5 ton wrapped in pink like the raptor.
Start posting regularly fuxker
Put more details on the 5 ton but not the eggs
Need to call it "The Hill Top"
she allow an inside rock climbing wall.. for practice & fitness..????
I want to be a dad one day man...
Decoration Ranch
I feel like u need more windows near that high cieling.
Should be hunting for a furniture sponsor.  Probably need $400,000 for furniture.
Paint the 5 ton pink because the Easter truck looks like the 5 ton
That half ton drawings actually really good lmao
Your business is Bunker Branding, right? A house that size, that prominent, with that VIEW, needs a name. Why not call it, and the channel, "Branding Mansion?" A smooth transition from "abandoned."
Ten to the one hundredths power! Thats a bigggggggg number!
Hope you and your family had a great Easter and so happy your kids got baptized. My family always waits for your new videos and you guys seem like a part of are family.
Looking good Matt....thanks for the entertaining content...house is really looking good...
Last episode:  It's not a mansion, it's just a regular house with 5 bedrooms. This episode:  6 rows of sheetrock running up the wall to a 40 foot ceiling!
Drywall...
I don't think there is a single room in there house that is smaller than my living room☹️including the giant tower thing
Goes pretty much without saying, but DO NOT show any elements of the security system in future episodes.
as an electrician that does houses of this size fairly frequently, the buried pendant boxes are not the only thing thats buried in that house by a long shot, lol
New name: Rancho Bonito
Wow, peddling life insurance now.
Love it Matt🗽🔫🔫🇺🇸🇺🇸💪👍
Should call it the Mount Demo House
Are you going to keep that bench make it into something cool, give it a venerated spot in the home?
Wow!  Now that the Sheetrock is up, you can really see the sizes of the rooms.  So envious, and also very happy for you guys - thanks for continuing to include us in your journey!
We love and miss the random family vlogs! Keep em comin like you used to do!
What a difference sheet rock makes!  Can’t wait to see more!
2:40 This interaction is like me trying to bargain with the LGS for good ammo prices right now lol
Tall ceiling to be sure. Six rows of Sheetrock times four feet is 24 feet. Best put a monster ceiling fan about six feet from the top or ALL your heating dollars will collect up there.
👍
What’s with Americans calling drywall Sheetrock lol. There’s no rock involved whatsoever. And mudding “floating” , no floating involved there either haha
Living room is 24 foot high
TV's don't go above the fireplace....Noooooo! You want a family night theatre.. must...have...theatre!! Lol
Petition to get the 5ton wrapped hot pink!
Looking awesome 🔥🔥🔥
Plesse run coax and eathernet LINE NOW FOR TV
Rip the lawn. All those nerf darts
Mere is so casual and composed. To her when she gets excited is a special day.
All your tvs are going to be too high. Everything else is coming along pretty well.
your wife is so beautiful, you are so lucky!
i love it when you keep her smiling.. happy for you gettin it when you did.. stay saine lol
Nooo don’t put the TV over the fireplace OK..
Damn bro. Your getting more ahd more grey hair lol
I just can’t wait when they finish up the walls and ceilings and finally the floors go down then it will start coming together quicker
I’ve been here since before the start of the series and it’s crazy how fast an far you progressed in only a year.  I came up with a name for the series.  Building OfftheRanch HQ or OfftheRanch Mansion, something like that I’m not very good at naming
Put up shiplap  Sheetrock is outdated
I have to say it took a lot of youtube videos to even make this at a possible level. Both of you are professionals and have skill sets not of the normal neighbor next door to me who shoots at stuff from his outhouse and scream obscenities at passerby's causing fear to all in hearing range. Yeah you outdid yourselves on it but people who have a decent education know how the dollar works and how to turn a nickel into dollar bills. How can you lose if both parties dig in and just get it done. I am sure that the platinum cards are maxed out many times before it came to be a owners dream and a builders nightmare. Even a repair by the average homeowner is no longer a possibility for them as there are miles of wiring, tons of sheetrock, barrels of paint and a mega pit of stone to decorate the outsides of this mansion. You guys do seem like the right people to own such a place. Now that your there, someone else will build and it will be higher, more expensive as in presidents, governors, military generals/admirals plus people that I have no clue as to fame, Even your computer engineers will chance living up here for the kind of privacy that rich think they deserve. What a epic build
So good seeing the kids draw a cross. THAT is what easter is about. Jesus death and resurection for you and I. (Greetings from Australia)
After sheet rock it goes a lot faster and you get a lot more exited
I liked Annie with the stone rolling away best . Nice job !
Weird, I didn't get a notification for this one
You are such a great dad!
BRO TV’s do NOT belong over fire places. THAT IS TOO HIGH
You could have easily a 20 foot Christmas tree in there
Got any extra ? Lol my contractor can’t even get any sheet rock so I can get in and finish our new house
Looking amazing
Not, abandoned mansion. It’s Bunker Hill !
The the RENOVATED MANSION
5:25 damn he smarter than me I had no clue such a word exist
This is why you have kids.
That cats in the cradle comment got me thinking a couple videos ago that I'm so thankful I started something with my kids. We just had our 6th! Anyway once a week I take one of them on a "daddy date" (I have mostly girls). Anyway I rotate through all of them so about once a month each kid gets to go do something 1 on 1 with me. This week me and my oldest daughter got ice cream and sat in the truck and just talked for like 30 minutes. Sometimes it's fishing, movies, dinner, whatever. Usually it's only 30 minutes to an hour or so. It's been a huge blessing. I just thought you might benefit from doing that. I have grown much closer to my kids by doing that. Its so easy for us self employed dad's to get busy.
i could actually just watch interior decorating for hours
😲😲😲😲😲
I wish I had a house like that
Hey sheet rocks a brand name gotta call it wallboard
you are gonna need more Nerf Guns..
You and Mere have an amazing partnership ! When the construction is all done, you will have built Mere and your kids a house, but when Mere takes over the next phase, she will have built you and your kids a home !
International CXT would of been a awesome DD for you
How many people think Mat's beard will be white before they move into the mansion?
Renovation Ranch
281k views in 4 hours! Fire
Happy for you brother!  Watched you grow over the years!  Just starting my journey!  Keep up the good work!
*looks into pool with floor still visible* “wow the rain knocked all the pollen into the pool” *me, laughing hysterically and bitterly from the eastern coast*
PUT EASTER TRUCK ON A SHIRT!!!
You better give mere the vlog camera for when she does the interior or we riot
The chickens look like at least two will be white chickens... muahaha
15 darts for $300.00 nerf ammo costs as much as 9mm ammo
that room is about 24 feet tall
The flashback to the beginning was my favorite part!
"The Big House " !!!???
dream ranch would be an awesome title for the rest of the house series
Dad brownie points, much respect
Incredible! Thank you for showing us! I can’t wait to see what Mere has for interior decor!
Matt,she doesn't want you putting up "pew,pew" wallpaper,that's why!! Love ,to the family.
Mere looks like she 3 feet tall in there lol
In waiting for the video.     So we bought a abandoned resort
Seeing the Abandoned Mansion not abandoned anymore and full of Sheetrock was amazing and all! But your kids totally stole the show with criticizing dads Easter eggs on the Easter truck!
Man I can’t wait till it’s all done I know it’s gonna look amazing
Looking great guys.  How many square feet did it turn out to be?
Call it Matt’s mansion
I can't wait to see the EPIC X-MAS Tree that goes up in the tall room. My rich uncle had a 25ft tree
Good lord it’s huge 😳
OTR 2.0
rainy days inside with my kids are my favourite. i get so many cuddles
Not good to draw a pink 5 ton Mere will get ideas remember the pink raptor
The Hill House?
Kids who know what Easter means! Good job parents!
Matt, I loved how you spent time with your kids on Easter Saturday and then with Mere, the Interior Designer, took us on a tour of M&M's Bigass Texas Ranch now that the sheetrock work is close to be finished. It looks fantastic. It's amazing how far you guys have come in a relatively short space of time when you think about all the work you had to do to repair the house. Well done amigos. I'm looking forward to future episodes.
Those lights in the living room look like they're going to fun to change. Gonna need a scissor lift lol.
Am I the only one who wished he called it drywall instead of sheetrock?
The kids or cool I know they get it from Matt thou
Meredith is a Beautiful Young Lady ! Can't wait to see the House become a Home !!🤗💖
Dang is that room 22 feet tall? Looks soooo good!
Matt  that bench  you have to keep it  ..  at the end when the house is completely  done   sit on it  out front  of the house and start off the last video  with you guys on it ...cheers  much love respect.
What's was it again? Everything is bigger in Texas ;)
Babey Chicks soo cute. <3
8:34, missed the opportunity to say...  "Look at... that... room!"
It’s not a piece of junk anymore
Little tip, smoke alarms shouldn't be on the ceiling
now you are at the fast part though
@4:21 new t shirt lol
I love that house. . .
Wow!! It’s stunning. Can’t wait for the next chapter.
Southern Indiana is watching.
How did you avoid kids breaking the windows again with no one there?  Do you have neighbors' houses now that weren't there 20 years ago?
Should have said "it looks a googol times different since the last time you've seen it"
holy crap matt looking good
I feel like mere hates being on camera 😂
Look at that Ugly Ford!
Anyone else very impressed with Matt’s drawing skills? And also did you say that Mere is 7 feet tall?!
It's like a mtv cribs but with a empty house
Good for you guys man
Yeah but do you have a slide from the top floor to the pool? I wonder what the market value of that place will be?
Looks amazing! By the way Matt, it’s a smoke detector. Not a smoke alarm. 😁
Such a great women you married
Going to have a HUGE HUGE Christmas 🎄 this yr, haha.
I love seeing great dads in action. The world needs a whole lot more great dads. Yall hear that demolitia?
Looking so good. I can’t imagine putting the beams up on that ceiling. Thank y’all so much for showing it to us. Mer, you’re so beautiful and I’m glad you were here on this video. ❤️
Annie is just a mini Mere.
Yalls energy is so amazing it always puts/keeps in such a great mood.  Also the house looks great yall deserve it. Thanks for the laughs.
2:40 MATT NEEDS HIS DAD TAX!!!! 😂
you can tell he is a great dad
Also make sure to do a mantle above your fireplace if you want to put your TV there. You can overheat a TV if you don't have some blocker between the Fireplace and TV. Good luck
It's beginning to look like a mansion. Keep it going Matt!
It's going to be a beautiful home!!!
Seriously, she's  7 feet tall???
Forgot to mention in the final "Abandon Mansion" video, that you could call it "renovating the Demolitia Home front" it's a good title and is on brand. Whatcha think?
Cograts to you and yours, You folks have worked hard for this. Keep it up!
Dude sign the pics and auction for charity!!!
I love that you take time to do things with the kids.
No wonder Americans texture all the walls in their houses they only use tiny little sheets of plaster (sheetrock)
Hey matt and mer! I should definitely win a free t shirt for my last comment  idea though.  Dont you all think?  Please
Please put an intercom
Matt: geez look at the view, jk you don't wanna look at the view Me: well, now I wanna look at it Matt
So looking forward to it becoming your home.....decorate....love the idea of stone going right up to ceiling
Matt you guys need to keep that table that you were both sitting on when you said you bought the abandon mansion,  refinish it put a glass top on it and put it on the back patio and keep it forever! By the way LOVE the house!!
U still need to prank mere for pink truck
Looks great! The echo has returned.
Can’t wait to see you guys finish it
Neck it!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Like father like son. More is always better in regards to ammo of any kind
It's amazing. Great work even though you didn't call me. Beautiful project. I can't wait until move in time,
What is more expensive? Sheet rock or dry wall?
Hey matt dont tell mer but you should definitely  have a rock climbing  wall put up on that one high wall for the kids and u all I mean that would be se freaking awesome  and then in the one area  you should make a eagles nest look out and keep your sniper rifle  up there ready to take out and defend  any one who threatens  your home and family
Was that Mountain Dew or pee? ????
Just commenting to help don’t mind me
You’re definitely not to young one of my best friends from high school passed away last weekend he was only 26 same age as me now I’m looking to get some life insurance
I enjoy watching your kids learn and grow, but their focus on the resurrection made down right proud!
Haha told y’all it Wasn’t gonna be the end of the abandon mansion😂
Mere & Matt...thx for any/all reveals present /future.
This video was.... Grrrrrrreat..... Hahaha Man, I love Mere's enthusiasm 🤣
I wouldn’t call that a house. That’s a mansion there.
4:20 my guy just getting roasted by his kids for 2 minutes straight 😂 love that
Don't forget to include an emergency exit for your kids upstairs!  Bad things happen to GOOD people!
Matt, what are you doing with the painted tile that was taken off on the outside of the fireplace?
Lincoln: "that's just dumb rules"  Must be an ENTP.
Matt needs to get a giant portrait of himself to go above the accordion door.
I’m so glad I decided to follow this from the beginning. Definitely one of the best YouTube series I’ve ever seen. Can wait to see it finished.
THE DREAM HOUSE!
6:28  talk to Taylor Ray about Cummins swapping your Ford. He LOVES his
Googol and google are pronounced the same, also I’m impressed your kid knows the word but can’t spell
googol = 100 zeros  (same pronunciation as google)
I wish ND would get your moisture lol
suggest you make some of your rock walls climbing walls with a belay point above. People are likely to want to climb them (like me, you have knucklehead friends). You want them to be safe.
Have fun changing a light bulb up that high, i don't even know how you would get up there ...
Can't wait to see Mere's decorating skills!
never stop putting in the clips with your kiddos. as a dad, I LOVE IT! super relatable and fills me with joy
check out the queen sized sectional couch its big enough for 2 families
Your kids are going to be meteorologists with that view into the clouds
I cant belive that #Dodge hasn't sent Matt a brand new Ram... They are SLACKING on an extremely wide reaching platform.
That Mountain Dew bottle is probably a piss bottle.
I don't think taking a yearto get this far is bad....it was such a massive undertaking along with taking time to massage the original structure to meet your needs and likes! Plus the addition of the garage and bunker just added to it's overall structure and value! The yard remodel will be impressive!
Interior decoration ideas:  Mere - tasteful and modern family design  Matt - 1272 pew pew racks
“Age restriction” nice try dad but me bullets
(10:50) HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE SACTIONAl?!?!
I noticed you called it, “[Da] Big House.”👍🏻 That’s what I suggested you call it😁 in the comments in your last video about the house.
F series pick up trucks are the only trucks, Change my mind🤷🏾‍♂️
You guys should try to work with Budget Blinds for all the window coverings in the house! I work for one in Virginia and they are trying to work with more "influencers". I'm sure they would love to work with you guys! If I was closer I know I would!
In America they call it sheet rock in Canada it’s drywall
4:00 next yrs easter shirt lol
Re-name the series Mere's Mansion, its all going to be decor and a focus on her choices now.
What a gorgeous home.....will be so awesome! Definitely one of a kind........Very grand rooms!
Yes the Younger you get Life Life Insurance the better it will be !!!
Thank you so much for show us this
What about the mat's room under ground bunker you decorate that
This house is coming together so well, I love it..
That looks AWESOME
Do you remember....... The 21st night of September. :-):-):-)
You got Baby 🐥🐤🐥🐔🐓
Who cares if calling your own house a mansion is “cringy” we all know it’s just a title! And it gets you views! Just keep using it!
Treasure these days.
With the younger crowd, wearing your hat backwards is code that you go both ways...not that there is anything wrong with that if you are
How many gallons of paint sir? Matt: Yes
Happy Easter!
Woohoo Keep them coming
Please don’t pull some goonzquad stuff and put a new video up every time you or someone else touches the crib like it is the only house on earth 😂 those dudes are on some sh!t
nice house someday i like to redo a house. i like the tall ceilings.
That would be a great opportunity for her to do a Vlog while she’s decorating it
3:55 Eggs, really?
They were all wrong we need to see mere do a burnout
dud you and your wife are such beautiful people and so nice. i hope i am half as nice as you guys are.
Going to be GORGEOUS !!!!! It's  been fun watching the transformation.
Pleaseéeeeeeeee
She's 7 feet?? I thought she was 5 foot something
Matt, Lincoln actually pronounced googol correctly! It can be pronounced as "googol" like you pronounced it, OR as google, like the website! Both are actually considered correct, so he was right! Smart kid!
Y'all should keep that table, as a reminder of the humble beginnings...of the house.
Dude its only been 1 year
Boo he got a ford f4 shitty
That's so cool!!
I think you need lunkers biggest elk in your living room!
“Meridith mansion” series engaged!!!
Matt as a electrician we don’t put the island light boxes up until the finish when the island is installed so we can center them perfectley when the island is there
💯👍🏽
name for future episodes, "Junk to jewel" because you called the place junk.
looks huge with the drywall installed.  i did a whole house  by myself once but it woulda fit in your main room.
Sweet
:)
That’s an absurd house for 5 people
Dad day was a success! Great job 💙  Thanks for the tour of the house! It looks great. I hadn't even thought ahead to the task of decorating that place! 😬 Now I'm looking forward to it!
300 nerf darts. And he'll be down to 12 within a week
Soooo... collection video when to move everything into the bunker?
Your piece of coal has turned 8nto a beautiful diamond! Can't wait to enjoy the decorating of a newly renovated abandoned mansion.
it looks soooooo gooood, i seriously can't wait to see what you guys paint the walls and how Mere is gonna decorate! 💕💕💕💕
How about a nerf gun?
8:45 she is a giant then lol
Lincoln, what happened to your front tooth? Did you dad box it out??? Oh, yes, he tied a string to  the tooth, tied the string to your dad's 5 ton🚚 truck then mashed the gas pedal to the floor!!! YIKES👍👍
Matt put the chicks water up on a platform. A couple of pavers or chunks of 2x4 work great to elevate the water. This will prevent them from kicking bedding into the water. Currently raising 20 of them in my spare room myself and as soon as I elevated the water it significantly reduced the amount of muck in the water.
If she is 7 feet tall she is a titan
Say "Ello" to the Herf's.
He should do a video with John Malecki for all of his cabinets and shelving maybe even some custom furniture
Hahaha cute you were trolling your son 🤣😆
Call it oyster mountain. It took time, but you got a pearl in the end. The house is really coming out great. Can't wait to see more videos.
Lets call it White Sands Ranch...  Unless your painting it another color outside. The ground, house look white....   Or Gray Rock Ranch since your on a mountain.
you should call the series DemolitionHouse
So happy you are keeping us up to date can’t wait to see it all painted and furnished way yo go
Enjoy the kids while you can, they grow SO fast.
WoW I'm so proud of you guys you've come along way
Will you go back to Vet Ranch vids when Biden bans your trucks and guns?
It's amazing seeing your kids draw pictures about the true meaning of Easter! He is risen!
Maybe you need to change your Title  of the Abandoned Mansion  to On the Ranch for house and Mar/kids stuff!
Congratulations on your family accepting Jesus and baptizing all your kiddos. Such an awesome blessing!!!
12v swap the new Ford
Lutron motorized roller shades on a sun sensor
Matt I think you'll have to sell your other house just to furnish the mansion lol
Please share a lot of the kitchen and everything new. I set cabinets for a living and I love this stuff
Giant house with a tiny little kitchen that is dark and dungeon like.  SMDH.
Dad & son having fun...I love it.
Mere is so beautiful.! Yall deserve it all.!
Thanks for the update, love watching your channel can't wait to see what comes next, and how you finish your new home 😀 love you guys ❤
"you related to your mom" what a great word😂
Next episode: so the abandoned mansion got hit with a tornado...
Pink Easter Truck. "You are related to your Mom." #KTYSAP lol
Nice 5 ton EASTER truck. Ha ha!
Super tall  tall
So are we running a contest, how many boards of sheetrock did it take? I'll guess 900
I ordered 1200 darts
Mere with an April Wilkerson wave to close out the video.
The interior of the mansion kinda reminded me of my childhood home and now I'm sad.
Mad & Mere Manssion. Cool Videos
Id clap those cheeks to next sunday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Meres FINE
Wow beautiful update can't wait to see Meredith do all the interior decorating
Electric bill to cool those rooms with massive ceilings 📈📈📈📈📈
Piece of junk into a brand new house
Good stuff!!!
So I gather Easter isn't a 4 day public holiday over there? No way anything like new doors or deliveries get done at Easter Down Under, the entire country goes away for 4 days.  The look on Mere's face at the house is kinda "OMG this place is bigger than I thought!" I hope you are planning on hiring cleaners, the place is huge. Very nice guys, it is going to look stunning.
Can you use an old Hi-Point rifle as a fire poker for the fireplace?
Looks great.
I can’t wait for the year of landscaping
I bet their flood zone is A+++++++++++++
Meredith is 7 ft.? LOL
Looks amazing can’t wait to see it all done good for you guys you must be incredibly excited to see it finally coming together
What about the man cave tho??
I’m so looking forward to “Mere’s Magic 🪄”. when she starts to do the interiors. 👍👀
I love ❤️ it
every motorcycle rider when told not to lane split 2:08
That formal living room needs windows, badly.
Over the island is in, then the electrician will cut the hole for the lights. They like to wait for it to be in so the lights are perfectly centered.
You should do a video with upchurch
Growing up like his dad... Dumb rules...
Everything gets done.   Bronco: 😪😥😢😢
8:43 so you mean to tell me that Mere is 7feet tall?
Oh I forgot to say freedom 500 was fire but with demo it would’ve been a inferno !🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's awesome to see how far it has come. Yall did a great job.
👌👌👌
Changing them can lights up high will be fun
No one: Not a single soul: Matt in every abandoned mansion vedeo: LUKE AT THAT VIEW!!
If the 5 ton was parked in front of the tomb the story would have ended quite different.
I’m not listening to that Lol that’s just dumb rules 👍🏻 🙉
Good job Matt. U A good dad man. That little bit of time matters to a kid. Keep up the good work and videos
“You’re related to your mom” that was funny I didn’t see anyone mention it so here I am
That living room ceiling is high enough for an epic-sized Christmas Tree!  🎄🎄🎄
Nothing like building your own home keep up the great work Matt
You guys have worked so hard on this home! It must feel so incredible!
about 25ft tall in that room! 4ft tall drywall looks good though
I think you should keep that table.
I love this been watching since the beginning every episode and this is just so exciting!!
Anyone else feel like their relationship is really strained??
mere is like my mother she would hate my idea's on house decorations to
Turning a McMansion into a livable home is a hell of a project.  Really impressive job👍👍
Beautiful House! THANK for the awesome video I do appreciate it.😊
So nice and good job 👍👍👍👍👍
Starting to look even more amazing, can't wait to see the final product
Mere pink wrapped you Easter truck too?  Man can't catch a break!!
I dont know why but just everytime i watch a video of you two doing stuff together it just puts me in a great mood and i love it. Thanks Matt and Mere!
Matt knows a thing or 2 about pink trucks
nice
Enjoying the “Soon to be occupied Mansion” updates.
Congratulations on this milestone !!
"Oh, those say ages 13 and up, sorry" "No...  I'm not listening to that, that's just dumb rules" LMAO! Raise em right!
Looks amazing
Nice job guys !!
Get baptized! 😇👍🤗
Ahhhhh.   Nice!
Thank you for the update.... step by step.... that's what we want to see
Pink wrap the five ton. It needs to happen Mere!
Love watching y’all - keep killing it - just curious if u have another child what are you gonna do - lol
For reference as to the height of the ceilings: those Sheetrock panels are 4x8 ft. That really tall room looks like it’s about 23ft. .
Liberty Ranch….
Blue Sheetrock is mildew resistant. It should not be in the shower. The shower should have durarock or similar. Get that Sheetrock away from the shower and tub or it will cause issues in the near future.
It's vlogs like this that makes me want kids
“Mer’s Mansion Makeover” series sounds like a good title for decorating vlog. Lol.
Matt: "You can't even tell how tall this is..." Yet, each peace of sheetrock is 4x8, they are laid on their sides to help hide the rise of the seams, and there are 6 rows from the floor to the ceiling. So, the room is around 20 feet tall.
I know how you feel, currently in the process of building a house and it's just a pain to run into issue after issue that delays everything
You are the best dad wow
My kids are in their 20s now, I cant say it enough how important the time you spend with your kids when they want to. That list your son made had my eyes leaking like crazy.
That’s a 24’ tall ceiling!!😳😳
L couch with a lounge  on the end by the door for the TV
this house looks absolutely insane even without stuff in it
Your new Ford barely fits in the garage
Get the windows tinted in the house
Such a good dad Matt
Nice curved ceiling, spiders will appreciate the workout!
Surprised the comments aren't all about drywall in the shower. People get real worked up about that stuff.
I dont need life insurance because im in 🇨🇦
Dang when YouTube takes away demolitionranch I don't think off the ranch is going to do so good! This stuff gets dumber everyday
Sweet!! I was hoping to see more on the house especially today it’s my birthday!
Matt's drawing skills are unparalleled
When do you anticipate the move in happening? By end of the year? Summer?
Now that the abandoned mansion series is completed, could you please start a new series called "Unabandoned Mansion".
I love how in the bible it said to be like a wise man and who built his house upon the rock in “Matthew” and “Matt” just built his house upon the biggest rock he could find 😂 Maybe it was a prophecy all along
20 bucks says Matt had to google how to spell Sheetrock cuz I didn’t even know😭
The Manchdominium looks great with sheetrock.
I’m excited for you guys
When are you hiring the maids an butlers?
You are a good man sir.... 😎👍 Haul those eggs..
Thanks for appeasing us😍 reminds me of my remodeling...can't wait for the next adventure! I really enjoyed your interviews with the workers! 🏋‍♀️
They used 1/4" drywall on the arches. Not 1/2"... It bends without breaking.
Too heckin wholesome
The kids roasting Matt sitting in silence killed me
You guys should get ‘finish carpentry tv’ up there. He would really set that beast of a house off. Looking good guys! 👍🏻💪🏻🔨🪚
wait how tf do you clean all the way up there
I’m glad I get to see JH roll his truck over every video now 😂
Absolutely nobody relies on me financially. I don't need life insurance. Great video though!
Your eggs look like colorful tombstones! 🤣
how about a bigger gun room storage???
Thanks so much for the update,, its lookin great..👍😎, I love the Easter pictures. 💞
Hell yeah man looks awesome
The island lights typically get thrown behind the sheetrock then you cut your holes exactly over island slab and grab your wire from inside and put in a cut in remodel box
I actually felt cheated out of the great view. The little glimpse just was not enough, The house is coming along beautifully.
I’m addicted to watching the new mansion videos been watching since the first video came out for the abandoned mansion. Thx for making great content
When do we see the demo collection. I’ve been waiting for years
HELI PAD/POOL ON ROOF???????????
Good luck changing those lightbulbs in the great room... hahaha
looks more like a ute than a truck
Why are the windows so small up high in the main room
Love yall. Not trying to be a debbie downer. I am an electrician... I'm not a fan of your electricians. Granted in I'm Tennessee so different methods to madness but yeah. I noticed things on first videos after your electricians started coming in before you ever said anything about it. Regardless... love yall best wishes.
No matt we want see it all sheetrock primed trim paint tile
Dude, TVs need to be at eye level, NOT above a fireplace. So uncomfortable to watch that way.
Didn’t realize you had a doggo
you have good drywall guys. they staggered the joints. few know to do that anymore.
Is it me or was it nice to have a checkin on the kids/family? As Matt was interacting with Lincoln and it hit me like wow it’s nice to see him again...I guess what I’m saying is I missed that content and didn’t know I did. Your family rocks....You’re living the dream Matt! Congratulations on your success.
About 28 feet to the top it looked like
Geico🦎, 15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance 😊
Looks Good!
“You are related to you mom”  Insert pink raptor flashback😂
I think Mair should DYI the table just as a keep sake of the old once abandoned mansion when she does the interior design in the house
Looks night and day..Nice Demo Mountain Home
Someone’s gotta stop link from growing
parenting you're doing it right!
Thank you ! thank you ! thank you ! for continued abandoned mansion/ new home updates ...
No Matt don’t do stone above the fire place you need to make a giant 8 foot portrait of you and pew pews doing some America shit with the 5 ton maybe
"Wait are you drawing my easter truck pink? You are related to your mom."   I normally hate when people make posts like this, but, i mean, come on, that's such a good father line :3
You gonna see how far you can shoot from your new king of the hill mansion?
Thanks for the tour guys ! Looks great 👍
no graboids getting in there!
If only nick irving visits your house to face his greatest enemy, baby chickens. Especially one named tornado.
This house is going to be insane
Damn that transition from the “so we bought an abandoned mansions” hit a lil different
All you need to say to Mere is "would you...be willing......to vlog the interior decorating process?". We love Mere vlogs. Lol. Don't worry, you're awesome to.
Easy height guage horizontal width of sheetrock 4ft wide so that's visible & apparent  junction boxes example for pendant light or hanging installations as in chandeliers etc.  Sheetrock rock common names string tape 1st, 2nd, & 3rd bed, sometimes called skim coat or finish coat. Sand then smooth wall - flat, orange peel,  splatter: fine, is orange peel, like then about sprayed textures: light splatter, medium splatter, heavy on this last you can run a 12-14 inch drywall knife down splatter it is a knock down some call a splatter drag , lastly skip trowel that depends upon "good taper with texture experience. A really good taper can go from Venetian plaster look to  a light almost difficult to see, to a really nice skip trowel this depends on mud viscosity and artistic taper. Get a sample , and select best taper! texturer to your eye I have people hire me to do their whole house. 44years experience I've worked in Texas california and washington state have them do sample if it's good it's like art if it's not there's material drag chunks un-random predictable to it just looks not so good this takes time and strong arms and shoulders, I was lead taper for 5 companies 25 years ago I'm now a master carpenter I've worked on America's castles 44 years in trades. Benjamin moore is nice paint you have good paint companies in Tx but Ben moore you can recoat touch up a couple of weeks later it blends it holds up well coverage is great S&W 2nd you had devo nice paint Jones Blair is okay go with decorator grade or premium paints the low O safe to people STINKS if you have allergies Ben moore  With S&W promar commercial grade it's crappy oil base Benjamin Moore it has to off vent  Note: get some "primapel" @ Sheplers building materials in Houston, seal those outside stone walls prevent staining even in dry climate think sprinklers ; consider staining exterior foundation concrete color it man it looks better { no primapel overspray if your going to stain concrete} great looking house structure it's awesome to have high ceilings let's your mind expand very nice home you are building.  Best David
Wow  I remember your first video about it 🙂
Man just to change a light bulb is a chore in itself. Need a  scissor lift,but I bet you have one
The pendant lights will be cut in after the island is placed, make sure they're centered correctly. There's probably coiled up wire in the ceiling.
Matt if you sign your easter poster drawing then auction it off. Donate proceeds to charity!!
Man you could put an indoor basketball court in your living room.
Such an amazing difference with drywall.  Good choice keeping the "Abandoned Mansion" instead of filliping it.  So looking forward to watching it to completion.
Annie is turning into such a spitting image of her Mum!!!
Funny fact with the number Googol is that it is the origin for the name behind Google
Lets play a game. How much Pew Pew stuff can Matt hide in the house's interior decor without Mere noticing
We need an easter 5 ton shirt
What about networking? Won't you cable the house with some CAT6, PoE AP's and so on? Will you rely only on WiFi?
mansion footage starts at 8:30
ok.... Matt design a shirt and if you sell 2500 shirts you get to decorate one room !!! lol
lol linc is lucky his ammo is cheap
Thanks for the sheetrock  update. It's looking good.
I'm an hvac technician and when you pointed up and said I don't know that that is, I mumbled under my breath smoke then you cut to the next clip
Instead of little house on a prairie you should name it big house on a hill
hrm, so it's now called "the big house"? i dig it!
I miss the pink truck!!!
YES!!!!!!!! And I totally love seeing Mark in the video❤️
Drywall.
Ur hanging lights won’t get boxes till the island gets put in there called cut in boxes
It’s coming along!
That entrance is 48 feet tall judging by the sheet rock seams. Each sheet turned horizontal,  each sheet 4 ft wide. That is what seems like a grand entrance!
I need to remember the list idea when I have kids.an do can’t wait to see the landscaping on the property
Love the house....Soft round ceilings...Did you consider arching the hallway(s)?
My sheetrock was just finished as well. It is nowhere as epic as 'The Mansion Formerly Known As Abandoned', but it is nice. :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeMqx4phGf8&t=19s
Omg I wanna do the trim as in all the things you use water with lol in ur house😩 that would be the best thing in the universe
Can’t wait to see it done
Matt, I think it getting close to Grecian Formula time.
13:00 how she says no tho🤣🤣
Yes mere! New channel. Interiordesignranch. I’m so happy
No sheets were given
Lincoln's Easter Truck looks more like an Easter Humvee.
Ain’t no way she 7ft tall
Damn it looks amazing
You better show the interior decor or we are gonna tell mare all your secrets
Matt since y'all dont like the Abandoned Mansion name what about   Carriker's Cottage
Are you going to put that tile thing back on the fireplace? I forget what the image was but i also remember that you cracked it slightly.
I saw a ghost at 9:25
It's not often you see a 20 year old new build.
Hurricane roll up shutters would be better than blinds on that hill so you can shut them when a storm comes.  You can roll down to let in partial light and all the way to block out.
When did Annie get braces?
I tore my tendon on my knee this easter😕
It's no longer an abandoned mansion, It's an abandoned home.
Nerf  pew pews in the house right now would be a good time!! Let, the boy loose 300 rounds and you can still find them!
Casa del Demo!
Matts kids roasting his drawing skills
Wait did the house never get finished an why?
good luck changing those lightbulbs up there.
Good luck in the formal living room changing lightbulbs in those cans. You might have to buy one of those small lifts you push in and they’re operate on air cylinders. Don’t let them tell you that the pole works because half the time it drops the Lamps.
Just a suggestion. Please get Mere a 🎤,  yes, we all are interested in what she has to say.
Echo!
I'm pretty pumped about it too.  It's getting exciting, thanks for sharing.
The age+ thing is manufacturing signage.
You should make a shirt with the "Ots greeeeaaatt" quote on it!!
How are you gonna change light bulbs?
I wonder if the chicks are safe in the there? No caged top and all. I ain't ever raised chicks. I don't know what hunts them.
Pink 5 ton 😂😂😂😂😂
little chickens
Looks good you’re almost 2/3 done depending how much trim and flooring. It’s not uncommon for sheet rockers to cover your boxes. The sheet rockers really good pissed when you start looking for your boxes with a hammer. 45 years as an electrician 38 as a union electrician wired a few houses in my day and remodeled more.
Wherses the chevys
Keep buying abandoned properties renovate and flip them and keep renovation ranch going 💪🏿
Once the drywall goes in and fully taped...House is at the Halfway point...No Joke!
I feel so bad for the person/people who have to sand all those walls.
Mere is not going to let this house go,,, the way her and also you talk about the future of your kids in the home leads me to believe your not going to sell it......... I kinda hope not either
Funny how not only do Annie and Linc look like they could be twins, but Linc actually looks bigger.
What happened to the other dog?
Merry rules
you should call your new house demo castle.
Meredith: We can put a sectional right there too. Matt: Ooh, a big L-couch
Bro you said the sheet rock was done if you want to do family videos do family videos I come on here to see you I was excited I didn’t want to watch half way through to get to the point of sheet rock you’re killing me here I’m out,
I'm so glad we get to see Mer's interior decorating! Yay!
Did you kick Rinsinger off the job??
“That’s just dumb rules!” Well spoken young man! That’s my mantra! Rock on!
What a Beautiful home it's going to make and WHAT a view. It's to understand not flipping. May you all the family make, many happy memories there.
✌🏼
Foundation is everything. Jesus said it Himself. Build On The Rock!
They were dinosaur eggs in the back of the truck that’s why they were so big
Hey Matt, the "missing" light boxes for the island pendants might have been left out intentionally. As an electrician, often times we will run the wires for island pendants but not install the boxes because if the island shifts a little in any direction the boxes will be in the wrong spot, so we cut the boxes into the exact spot they need to be after the island is installed. Typically on trim/finish.
"eggs,really?" I don't know why but I definitely heard Mere's daughter in that remark.
After the kitchen island is put in,then you can center the light boxes to the island.
"They look like lumps.... of dirt.." Burn
You need to do the living room like Deermeatfordinner has with a 13 foot alligator. Mere will love it!
What a great dad. Thats a great idea about the kids making a list of things to do with you. I'm going to do this with my little ones. Thanks for all the great content Matt keep it coming 👍
The family every conservative strives to be.
The high ceilings (like even just in the hallways) make Mere look so tiny lol. Nevermind that 900ft ceiling. Good luck changing lightbulbs in there too. They'll need those really long pole things.
2:57 buying ammo these days
I g out a tittle gmfor you  (abandoned mansion remasterd)👍👍
"You are related to your mom" I died laughing, I forgot about that, was pretty funny
If you swept it might look brand new
Mere is 7ft tall???? Does it mean she is 2 meter tall? Is he joking or am i too european to get this 😂😂
Next episode "I bought a bucket truck, so I can change the lightbulbs". 😁
You can have a Ford with a Cummins....talk to Taylor Ray.....
Trying so hard to not call it the mansion lol
You could say this is the first little bit into the new series: "NotSoAbandonedMansion"
I want to see how you decorate and what you put in the shelter.
13:51 The wall socket for the TV is super high... When the TV is mounted it's definitely going on r/TVTooHigh. I'd lower it by at least 30 cm, neck pain ain't fun.
House is looking great
God bless you bubba you've come a long way from putting 22 lr bullets in a straw, throwing them in the air and diving behind your truck I tell ya.
Barring any delays everything should come together pretty fast now.
The amount of dust that’s going to be on those sealing oh my
Matt I've found your shirt choice oddly satisfying during the tour. That blue and the waterproof sheetrock just hit different, just like when you the like button (if you read this scroll up and hit that like button)
Resurmansion
They will complete the house finally... only to have a SpaceX Starship crash into it. You see.... then just as the rocket is about to hit you see lettering on the side of it saying “WhistlinDiesel Says Hi”.
omg! that is so nice. well done you guys. i cant wait to see the interiors in the future and the gardens too.
The drywall sheets are 4' tall in the formal living room.  I think I saw 24' walls
lol refrense to when mare turn the raptor pink
Are you still going to put the old fire place tiles back up
That mudding job looks half done ?
The hanging lights in the kitchen get cut in on the finish, sparkys wait till the island is set to make sure they are in the right spots
Matt gets to dec out the safe room to a man cave tho right?
The work table has to become the breakfast table 💯
A funny video intro would be recreating the "So we bought an abandoned mansion" moment but now its drywalled behind you
Living room looks like 24 feet by counting the pieces of sheetrock.
Lincoln knew it was a truck before I knew
You better have a huge Christmas tree next year.
24’ tall.
Jeez, I remember thinking they were crazy when the first abandoned mansion episode came out.
On demolition ranch you should try shooting something strong and at the end have a container of tannerite for a legal explosion
I really can’t wait to see Mere’s interior designing and all the landscaping you’re going to do. Fun timed ahead xxxx
its 24 feet tall matt! :P
The Hilltop Homestead is coming along nicely!
when Matt started this series i had no faith/confidence in my DIY building Skills, and just started dating a girl  Today: just end ed the toxic relationship and look forward to building my own house by 2027💪🏽  good luck DEMOLITIA
"That's just dumb rules" wait until Lincoln understands what the ATF is
Pink 5 ton next? I think Matt's gonna keep it locked up whenever he goes somewhere from now on because of that. XD
🤘🇺🇸
Sunset Ranch is a great name
I said Geico when he said 50%off
Wait... You are going to have ducks in the mansion?
Put that easter truck on a t shirt please
Great episode of my new favourite series, Populated Large House!
Good episode and it definetly looks more complete with the sheet rock.
I wonder what Matt could do with a log cabin
Great now we need an easter truck shirt
Its gonna cost you a fortune to heat and cool those high ceilings...!
I still think 'Building our Dream Ranch' would be an amazing video series title.
Very Chill Family. You’re blessed . Idk what it is but watching these videos you post does something for me I cannot put into words. Got those good vibrations!!!🎧 🎼 🎵 🎶
CONGRATULATIONS!! I love the house 🥰🥰🥰
What if; you start a new serries called "MY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE"?  Then you can say things like "welcome to off the ranch at my beautiful house!!" 😃👍
I literally thought you said "there's tax and shit and stuff" lol
Why didn't you film it going up
It would be pretty cool to see that groin vault ceiling painted like the Demolition Ranch Sistine Chapel
Looks good!
So once you start interior decorating the place does Mere take over the series? She should get an intro and outro.
Time to start making punch lists:  All the things that were left out, broken, lost, etc.
Please don’t get Samsung appliance you will regret it!!!!!!
Lincoln looks so much like you Matt, while you're daughter in the pink dress looks like Mere. Lincoln's goona be a stud at Football and get him into Wrestling or Martial Arts since he already loves to box!
I already like the idea of you going all the way up with the fire place rock
Mere’s house is looking good so far, now I think it’s time for another construction ranch video for the new home!
Hopefully you guys can move in and finish everything by Christmas
Lincoln has better handwriting than me
those plantation blinds would be amazing
Renovation ranch is looking great
Your new home looks FANTASTIC!!!  Can't wait to see how Mer decorates.  You kids are absolutely adorable 😍 💕
Matt, please consider how impractical a TV above a fireplace really is! Imagine you're sat on a sofa, you'd have to be looking like 45 degrees upwards to watch it. :)
That's amazing amount of joint compound.
Some nice bear skin rugs and antler chandelier would be dope
Legend says that’s the same Tin Tub 6:01 he used for a hot tub back in bunker branding grounds
Matt, remember what happened last time you got creative? You lost a Raptor.
CONGRATS!!!!
"but when their teenagers im not in" hahahah
Did Lincoln get his nerf bullets on Monday?
Why does life insurance matter when your life doesn't matter?
What about comfy theatre seats for the TV room? 😜👍
Congrats you two. Nice dogs. From a carpenter nice dining ceiling
what happened to the boat in front of your house?
Don’t put a tv above a fireplace. TV should be at eye level so you don’t need to strain your neck.
Thank you for being a great Dad and showing it to everyone, that is so under valued today!
We'll looks like we won't have to worry that Lincoln has any ideas to be a sheep, wish more people had his attitude.
Slap a Cummins in the ford
Matt is dying to call it the abandon mansion and I can see it every time he says “new house” or “big house”
I would hate to meet whatever comes out of those eggs in the 5 ton
This makes me miss my nephew. Stupid covid took our Easter again :,(
The Mini Mansion
Ok hear me out. Above the large folding doors, @OffTheRanch (matt) has someone come in and paint a great white shark with Lasers and Matt surfing on it with many pews. floating in a sea of American Stripes. That wall would be perfect for it. Im willing to bet $.05 that Mere would almost kinda not even like it.
honestly, that part in the outro with your brother is my favorite... I'm glad you kept it for the new outro!  I watch the outro just for that, and still laugh every time.
24 feet tall great room, I would call that a super great room.
Bro, would you install any fire suppression system there?
WRONG: The house was "Started" 20 years ago... Its age begins when you cut the tape and break the bottle of champagne!
Mere straight makes clones.
looking at your new place gives me the feeling of when i worked construction.. didn't like having to clean the walls from drywall dust and then vacuum everything though. demo and interior was fun though!
Hey guys, did you save that hand-painted tile from the fireplace? Are you going to use it in your house design?
After the paint yall should make a before and after video
a Easter truck lol
That thing y'all were sat on needs to stay! Make it into a coffee table or something but that's an OG part of this so keep it =D please!!
HOW LONG?   2 YEARS!? Noooooo... Right?  Edit: YES it has, july 2019! Wow, when no average person would have ever thought this would go this south a few months later.
I think Lovesac couches would really work for that movie room. It would help it be more versatile. Just a suggestion :)
Imagine the height of a Christmas tree you can get with that ceiling
Do u have a edc if u do can u make a video about it
Not calling it mansion is just humblebrag
you hace a nice view congrats guys
Bro you should spray the big truck pink.... as crazy as it sounds your truck could don pink and get away with it 👌
Thank you!  Thank you!!  Thank you!!!  We loved it!  I know it's going to be beautiful when finished!!  We also enjoyed seeing the children!  They are really growing!  We love all of you!!!  Looking forward to the next one!!
Lol I can’t believe they kept the shower tower. What a weird thing to have
The kids were bullying there dad thats funny love you demoltion
I've been watching from day one
The house is look great
Beware of the pink 5 ton🤣
🏚⏳🏠
Oh this is worth the wait 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
The room with the high ceiling w/beams looks approx 22' high...  That's about 4.5' higher than standard two story houses...  Without being on site it's hard to tell  WHY...   (The distances are rounded off for obvious reasons)
Black out/Room Darkening Blinds, shades, curtains et.  You can still call it Mansion. Don't have to appear modest
*ATF open up*  Lincoln: I'm not listening to that, that's just dumb rules
looking good
“watch out for tornado”  “he’s heavy” Definitely did not expect that to be the reason 😂
If you don’t like calling at the abandoned mansion, call it bunker hill
I respect this couple you guys make life look so simple but all who been following them know that they put in a lot of work 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
"Are you drawing my easter truck pink?"  enthusiastic nod* "You... are related to your mom." lol the throwback to the pink raptor
U won’t shot a 50cal  though the house  😂 jk
I know it is too late but being that high up from the surrounding area you could have had an observatory.
Look at that beauty... reminds me of Gasparito 😂
I thought he was going to leave that cool wood design on the roof the square as it is but now they have it covered.
Matt is getting thicc compared to last year! Dirty bulk definitely works.
Id like to paint your house after tape and mud. I think it would be cool to paint demolitas house
Wow, that really makes the rooms look tall! I can't wait till Mere starts decorating it!
Love that art ! Awesome! 😍
Your daughter is hilarious talking about your Easter truck 😂
Looking good guys❤️ keep going can’t wait to see what you all do to the outside when it’s done
Good job on parenting done right man
Matt tell your kids to not keep holding the chicks cuz if they keep doing that The chicks will actually die
In the "formal living room" you should put in a rock climbing wall...
MERE'S MANOR!!!👍👍
Now it's really looking like a house so glad for you and your family
The Big House!!  Instead of Abandoned Mansion!   I don't know how you find the time to do all that you do!
I think why we like this series so much is because it’s sorta like playing Sims the game. It’s wholesome, and quality content.
I am very happy for y'all! Y'all definitely deserve it!
"Formal Living Room" needs to be a rock wall for climbing...
It's looking awesome! Cant wait to see it 100% finished and decorated
Idk if you saw my last comment but im pretty sure you have light brahma chickens. They get huge
“I’m not listening to that it’s just dumb rules” Lincoln said free men don’t ask permission. A true Patriot 😂
Ugly Ford
Wish we could still get more house building videos
Just trade the Ford in when you find the prefect ram Cummins
Show us the gun vault?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
I dont even wanna know what the drywall and tape costs have come out too 😬
Damn, it looks amazing!
It’s been almost TWO YEARS sense the first episode. I can’t believe it
I'm trying to estimate the interior square footage x cost of sheetrock + cost of labor. I'm guessing the all-in sheetrock price tag alone cost about at least as much as a 20% down payment on a median priced house in the San Antonio area.
Pendants get put in after your island is set to make sure they’re in the correct space with the island.
Only Matt would have a bathroom with 3 rooms in it
11:13 you should put giant subwoofers in those corners
Ware is the indoor gun range
Uhhh, it's been 2 years?
Lol yeah it did make the house look WAAAAAYYYYY bigger
I think thats cute and all but next time one of your children wants to spend a whole day with you, you should turn off the camera and keep that time between you and him.
Your kids are awesome!
The rooms somehow look huge now. Especially how tall it is to the ceiling.
Matt, how is Mere going to clean the windows in the section with the high ceiling?!? 😳😅😅
Starting to look the business 👍🏼
It’s a good thing you have policy genius as an advertisement because you’re gonna need insurance on this thing when it becomes livable.
How are you going to change light bulbs in that great room
okay wait but how does matt only have 4 mill subs!? i definitely thought he was almost at 10 mill 😳
I'd like to see the difference between code to Arizona. You should do a final inspection episode. That'd be awesome.
Man.. this house was made like Obherst size... Everything is so huge! I got 9ft ceilings in my condo, which is taller than what was in my parents house, and they're made to look small in comparison to your ceilings.. In the great words of Matt: "Gosh!"
Love it... so cool you hanging with the kids...
start doing a poll what it will flip for $$$$$$
It's looking like a well built mansion!
Matt that's it! The new name for the house "The Big House"
"She's 7 feet tall" 🤔
It’s been awhile since we’ve had a family vlog. Kids are growing so fast.
Y'all should put white oak hardwood floors!!!
"The foundation is like 2x thicker than code, haha" yeah thanks to your front porch you and your crew found out the hard way heh
Keep the thing you guys sat on in the first video:)
Looks great
My only questions are is there water you can access up there? And how’s the electrical run up to the top? Or you going all solar to power that house?
I hate to be the perversion of Easter drawings... actually I do... but that cave rock opening up looks a little more like something else that is rock hard
Love the Easter truck and coloring with the kiddos. 😄
The house is looking fantastic!! With the sheet rock up you can really tell how huge the inside is. Can’t wait to see the progress!!
You ain't from the south if you don't pronounce naked as "nekkid"
im not sure if you will ever see this bro, but youre an amazing father i honestly wish i had a brother like you man. both my "brothers" act like  they have never cared nor treated me like a sibling. Got put in a dark place and using substances for years. now i just want to get back to living a fruitful life. would love to work with you at the warehouse. im completely clean and sober. just trying to start fresh.
House looking good! Will we ever know the financial side of it?
Need = nurf... Autocorrect
I'm halfway through the video, and I thought I was here for the sheetrock, but it turns out I was here for the drawing and chicks after all. How cute!
How close are we to getting her to do a burnout?
Get a sactional! I work for Lovesac, theyre stinking amazing!
Yikes better get that need ammo before the price goes up more.  Your son had that same feeling everyone experiencing the ammo shortage price jumps felt. 300?
The sheet rock in the non mansion right lol... good things happen to good people
We need a series for the interior decorating with Mer called "Shhhh...Don't tell Matt"  10/10 would watch the crap outta that 🤣
"They look like lumps" your kids are hilarious
Let Meridith name the House!!!!!!
that's right Matt you cant make him listen to dumb rules
Honestly, if this was my house project, then i would have turned this weird tall shower room into a 10m high tower with a nice small office//bathtub/bedroom and a balcony all around it. Kinda like one of these prison overwatch towers. So you get to enjoy the view even more with this super over look. And probably shoot up some targets with a sniper rifle. That would have been epic!
Your post has made me sad xx
A shower IS a bathtub btw
should get a fish tank and call it under sea ranch
Try putting their water on two bricks. One for them to stand on one for the water it saves it for a lil bit longer. That happens over and over its a nightmare lol
When you finish the house and covid is over you should do something similar to Charley and the chocolate factory, and put 10 "Golden tickets" in different boxes of product that people buy, and the one's who get the tickets get to go to the house for a party.
House looks sick !! And so are the sheet rock guys
I hope this isn't the video of the 🏡.
What is sheetrock ?
It’s so beautiful when mere looks at you it’s absolutely obvious that she is still madly in love with you
So, barring dollar amounts, does a youtube series with millions of views, material sponsorships, and the sale of your old house provide enough capital to make a significant dent in the cost of the mortgage and renovation?
Changing out the lights in that big ceiling is gonna be fuuuuuuuuuuun lol
I deliver packages on Sunday on Easter Day ask my boss at fedex
Renovating the inhabited building
Yall. I feel like we've never seen Matt and Mere kiss. ????
One of the kids seems cynical,  another seems physical, another seems hysterical.
There is no such thing as a perfect house.I know I’ve looked at houses to buy. Don’t let anyone tell you that there is.🇨🇦❤️
"No i'm not listening to that, that's just dumb rules" = Lincoln 2021
how strange was it saying "the new house" or hearing Matt say "the new house" instead of "abandoned mansion"
12:45 That railing is A+. Don't change a thing about it.
Matt, you are a G.
Love Jesus
I see a rock climbing gym above that fireplace with the vaulted ceiling.
FYI always buy nerf branded bullets they work better .. even thought they’re way more expensive
Thank you for showing the progress
That's awesome congrats you guys cant believe it's been that long! Thanks for the update! 🤘TEXAS!!!
Be sure to prime walls and ceiling’s with flat paint ( cheaper ) and is back rolled as they spray  BEFORE trim and cabinets are in  Make sure ceilings are are panted after and the it’s way better on painter and you !!!!!!! !!!!!!
Good luck changing lightbulbs In that formal living room.
Who gets to change the light bulbs in your new ceiling?   Awesome so far! Loved seeing your kids have dad fun!
u 2 r doing a wonderful job
I dont think I've ever seen the word sheetrock... that word looks so wrong
Do you even vet anymore?
it's almost been two years?!?!  just realized— I got engaged, married, pregnant, bought a house, and will have my baby before it's been two years that you bought it LOL
Matt interior decorating: “Camo EVERYWHERE! Done.”
" I'm not listening to that, that's just dumb rules." This world needs more Lincolns.
11:20 make it a rock climbing wall!!!
@DemoRanch should have done a shirt for easter of Jesus driving the 5 tone while pulling the stone away from the tomb.
Iol. Your wife looks very nervous...
Thank you for including Annie... She will remember this.
looking good Matt n Mere👍🏾
When your kids are old enough to re watch your videos and see who’s the  favourite child
Talk About a great opportunity for you and Simply Safe to get together and do an epic collaboration vid!
I think The mountain manor sound amazing
Matt is an artist. Drawing of the truck was great.
The ammo shortage is really bad... Nerf darts are a dollar a round .  I was gonna grab those instead of m855
The job looks good. Happy Easter to you and your family.
WHY DID YOU RUIN THOSE CEILINGS? You had those 2 unique ceilings that are now covered to look like everything else! 😳😢😢😢😢😢
That's it... Now you have to paint the 5-ton pink. It's decided...
That order may have come on Easter Sunday.  Had an order through Amazon, that was due Saturday,  but got delayed.  Wife and I went to walk the dogs after dinner,  on Easter Sunday, and the package that had been delayed,  was sitting in the mailbox, when we walked out the front door.  Not the first Sunday drop off, or holiday drop off. Ordered a Christmas gift for my wife and daughter, that were to be in by the 23, and it didn't make it by the night of the 24th. It was on the porch, both items in the same box,  when I got back from picking up the paper, and and a few last minute things for breakfast.   So yes, it does happen.
“This is the last episode”- ghandi
The castle is coming along. Can't imagine living in a home this big
Remember now it's Cherished house
You so have to keep that table and make it like a coffee table or something
No super secret bunker.. Or nuclear safe house
That's awesome man. The foundation is twice as thick, because Jimmy Hoffa is probably, maybe in it....  Yup ,y'all get all finished and decorated to the nines. The someone will call in saying Hoffa is somewhere in the slab....  That would be my luck..  Really guys it's a very beautiful house, not a home yet, as it's still vacant.  God bless you and your loved ones  How y'all had a wonderful blessed Easter.
Omg the house is coming out awesome 👏 I’m so excited to see it done.
Put LED in kitchen
Mere's next prank = Rap the 5 tons pink 😂
Who votes he fires the Barrett before they finish in the house thumbs up fire the bear it in the house before they’re finished or 308
I want an Easter truck!
Matt: She doesn't like any of my ideas Also Matt: Buys an abandend mansion, wich she absolutely loves
Make a  Shirt " Lincoln says I am not listening to that. That's just dumb rules"
it finally looks like a house inside.
Do you have a floor plan posted anywhere? I would love to see how it's laid out.  Very excited for you to get the final touches on your little home sweet home.
'you are related to your mom' *well no really*
Man, cleaning those upper windows in living room.... LOL
You need and elk or  moose head above the fire place
So I'm still waiting for my prize for the best new name for this new series ....SUNSET RANCH!!!
No one mentioning linc knows the word googol... Ive been alive for almost 30 years and didn't know it existed 😂😂😂
The arched ceiling looked better with the ribs exposed
I honestly can't think of a nicer more genuine couple on YouTube that deserve a house like this and deserve the support of the demolitia and the support of off the ranch. Meredith is amazing at running Link Active and running Bunker Branding! Matt does an amazing job creating content and he does a lot at the bunker as well. I am so happy that God has blessed y'all because you truly deserve it. We love you and your family of workers. You are truly two model Americans and I am proud of this Channel and being a part of all of this. May God keep blessing you all.
dude she looks like a miniature mere
Wow! Your child is named Lincoln!!!
Kreuzbogengewölbe
"15 darts for 300 dollars"  sounds like 9mm
You can get away from calling it abandoned  But it's still a frickin mansion LOL
If putting stone up to ceiling, better use thin cut veneer unless you have major reinforcement to hold up about 25000 lbs of full thickness veneer.
Nice to see a update on the Demo Ranch ! Coming along nicely ! Can not wait to see it painted and some furniture /shooting benches in it . Keep up the great work and progress . Love it
Is Mere actually 7 feet tall
you should contrast mere decorating the house with you kitting out the bunker displays and such.
What happened to your other dog
Matt,  just put 14' doors in.... standard semi- trucks and trailers are 13'6" .  Maybe you could avoid some future issues...
Bro! I can't wait until the landscaping videos.
Love the videos,  God bless you and your family. 👍
What about carriker compound?
So happy for you guys!!!
23’ 6” tall?
That tall room needs wrap around balconies and spiral staircases.
I can’t read because I thought it said the “she erock” is done not Sheetrock so I feel ridiculous XD
cant wait to see the 20' Christmas tree
id say that the tall room with the beams  is darrrn near 28 foot tall
No wood at all?
i love how matt gets bullied by his daughter, so cute😂
you put the back of the drywall in water to make it bind like that.
Mer's Hill   Ranch
Level 5 smoothwall throughout!
Yeah, we better get an interior decorating episode.
Very cool to involve the fam on this one...2 birds, one stone ;)
At least you won’t have to worry about flooding up there on your mountain. 🤣
Get that powerstroke bullet proofed. Your repair bill will be a lot lower if you do..
What if this house wasn't abandoned? The foundation is 2 times thicker than it needs to be. Why? Did they hide something under it? What did they bury under that foundation? We need to know!
Took me a second when he said “you are related to your mom” when she colored it pink
Matt called it; The Big House Translation from El Rancho Grande
That wooden piece needs to be restored and have a place in the house. Would be a cool sentimental piece.
Love it guys thanks for the update video. Looking forward to many more videos. 👍🏿
My kids were getting there YES DAY last saturday
boxing is one of the oldest disciplined martial arts known to man
I would LOVE to see Mat find the people who started this house and show them what happened to it.
Demolition Bunker Hill is coming together!
Mere is too small for the house 😂
OMG!! Lincoln's list is too freaking adorable 😍
Looking good!  Enjoy that AC bill in the summer!  LOL
That 20ft ceiling in the formal living room of the not a mansion is awesome.
Yeah it's definitely a mansion.
How about "Home on the range" instead of "abandoned mansion"
Tbf the 5 ton drawing was actually really good
I can bring down the arena setup for the kids and your workers sometime.
❤🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
Jokes on matt the house is haunted that's why they abandoned it
call the series “Renovation Ranch”
Ew
Is Matt still an active veterinarian?
The blue board isn’t even Sheetrock brand! It’s American gypsum. Get your facts straight!
How in the world are you going to change your blown out ceiling light???
Хоть я почти нихрена не понимаю, что вы говорите, зашел лайк поставить и посмотреть что тут происходит)) Matt go russian subtitres. Вас смотрит четверть России.
Wow, it’s coming along good!!! But Mere doesn’t look too excited about it!!! It’s huge house! I love it! And the view, it’s just awesome!
It's greeeaaat! Luvvit! And so glad to see more of the Big House
its dry wall not sheet rock
You need a rock climbing wall in the tall room.
Happy Happy to see y’all
When I become a parent I'll look back on your off the ranch vids for inspiration. Keep up the great parenting man!
Haaa..Thank you and sorry.  I was one of the ones that complained.....Team Merideth!!! 👊
I just wanna see that sick pool already with the slide
NO DUDE! WE WANT TO SEE MARE DO A BURNOUT!!!
I've raised chickens my whole life and we use a small piece of wood like 1" thick to keep the bedding of the water
I am excited to see the landscaping
Great view but no sunrise or set. Not that I am criticizing but I bet video isn't doing justice to the height of those ceilings.
15 darts for 300 dollars...sounds like its getting into real ammo prices lol
The holes are probably not cut above the island because normally you wait till the island is done so you can make sure they’re centered and you don’t have to patch it and do it again.
This has turned into a nice project, let me know when you are ready to flip it. (joke) Actually, have the original builders or previous owners ever contacted you or commented on your videos? Do they approve?
By adding that I know I’m not happy about it just gained you a few wife points 😎👏🏼
Hey, Matt! You sure that super-stable 'mountain made of rock' isn't a temporarily dormant volcano? ;-)
A floor to ceiling bookshelf would stellar. Even more stellar would be your own library
I’ve been watching since day 1 and I still have absolutely no clue how the house is laid out
It is going to be a great home, good job.
I loved lincoln saying I'm not listening to that those are just dumb rules. That kind of goes right in line with thinking it's only illegal if I get caught. Oh the joys of raising a child.
Thank you for sharing.
I could smell the bucket of crayons through my phone
Thanks for update looking amazing
they getting freaky in the mansion XD
You go lincoln
Congratulations buddy can’t wait to see it completely done
The Big Bunker.
“That’s just dumb rules” He’s being raised right.
Better keep that little wood table!!!
Well, with the Raptor gone, the chicks will be safer.
Can’t wait to see this complete especially the outside
And we want to landscaping .. final finish of all
Can just imagine Hide and Seek .... In that house
Lol has no idea about blueprints so asks wife and shes got it down. Love it.
It's like watching HGTV but they don't show the finished house... Glad you are actually continuing to show the transformation. Can't leave us hanging!
Time flies look's so nice now
That how we were when we got our house added on great job man I know how good it feels when they put on the Sheetrock
Question why didn't the tapers tape all of the angles? I was a taper for 25 years and  think I would have run all the angles. I know you will have wood trims up but tape keeps the bugs under control.
Coming from a cabinet guy.. im very excited to see them.. and glad I don't have to build and deliver them 🤣
Cletus getting married you are getting a mansion
Love tgese videos can't believe I've been watching it for that long.
Looking great guys. Go mare
You consistently have THE WORST MUSIC for your little video montage things. It's like mute it or shut it off bad.
Dude love the vids I am subscribed to bothe channels and I’ve been following demo ranch for 6 years and off the ranch a month after it came out I bought almost all your merch keep up the great content you make me laugh and smile when I have a bad day ❤️
Demolition Manor, stolen from comment below😉
Awesome video. Thank you
You have to keep the bench,  it's part of your story let Mere decorate it.
YouTube has done you well as you have done as well a job providing content I remember like it was yesterday and it was just a teenager showing us how to bump shoot a Saiga 12 p.s. Yeah I’ve been here that long homie seeeeee I still have the link  https://youtu.be/F1vPXTcE5-4
Soon, Mere will decorate and color coordinate the interior. Matt will decorate his "bunker / security room. The pool will be in. And y'all will move in. Two barns, maybe three, will be built in the next year and you can sell the old house or keep as an investment.... Awesome,  simply awesome.. and it's..     GRRRREEAATE!
Did anyone else notice that one of the kids drawings kinda looked like something else??????
Our Not So Abandoned Mansion.
Thanks for the update. “It’s Great!”
It’s looking very good I’m sure Meredith do a very good job of decorating the kids are gonna have fun I can’t wait to see the progress
Matt: everyone should have life insurance  Me: *Laughs in free healthcare*
You get to have a 20ft Christmas tree in your formal living room now, sweet!
I can't wait to see the first Christmas in the house with a giant Christmas tree in the formal living room 🎄🎄🎄
So while Mer is doing the interior, Matt goes crazy on the pool and everything he wants outside...
Wow they put up the sheet rock up pretty quick love the house.
Not to pick on your gorgeous home but the window in the tall room look to small now that the drywall is in
That is crazy the roof is like so high that good because when summer come it wouldn’t get to hot in your house . Can’t wait to see the design of your house imagine the nice tiles you guys gonna put for the flooring . 😱
What's your wife's name.. still working on a name.
well done
It is looking so good! Y'all are doing an awesome job getting it done right!
“You are related to your mom” I laughed too hard at that
Plot twist: Matt decides to buy another abandoned mansion to flip for profit+ content
i love the transition from 'let's do 200, screw the rules' to 300 bullet page lol
I can’t wait to see the house finished and by the way I’m all for the two barns idea from last episode
Knowing what you know now. Would you have still bought it?
Awesome...the house is so gorgeous!  Thanks for the video.
Nice 24' ceilings! Looks great.
Why not call it plaster board like the rest of the world? Fucking sheet rock. Only in America
Amazing to see the progress! Well done!!
You HAVE to keep that list of, "things to do". Epic childhood memories!!!  ❤
I think Cleetus was in your house. He left his mountain dew.
room enough for at least 3 more kids,  better tell Mere
It's lookin really good Matt! Love the way Mere said great haha.
The way your dog looked at you when you told him to jump into the pool xD
We have to see the five ton in there since there 11 foot ceilings
You need to keep that old work table you first sat on in the first ep and do something with it maybe in a corner of the garage or down in the underground vault etc Also carve the dates that you bought the place the first day of demolition and the completion date for interior and finally the completion date for the entire project.
Will yall get a maid for the new home?
Spectacular!!!
Anybody catch what mare said at 11:27 I couldn't understand her
Matt!!! You need to put chicken wire over the top soon or they'll fly out as soon as they can!!! This come from experience 🤬
Has life insurance at 23 because dangerous job.
The hugest ceilings
it looks amazing! I'm so happy for you and your family. You're a lucky man!
If your getting the cuddies-19 jab you should DEFINITELY get life insurance!
You have to work that little table into the new place when its done
Did the original owner's ever came back to see what ye did to the house that would be a good video to see. O look or house is finely finish less move back in 20 years later
Your wife is ungrateful as hell and you can tell, she’s definitely cheating on you as well Matt
Can't lie. Got a little misty starting from 14:30.
Matt: “This ceiling is 10-11 feet tall”  Me: Oh so the five ton will fit in there 😂
TRAITOR!!!!!!!  :P
Good you're hanging with your children, they are only little for such small while. Bless mate.
"So theres mer shes 7 feet tall" so that makes mat like 11 feet?
Shower LOL!
damn matt you do so much for your family. Good on you man loving the house coming along great cant wait to see it finished !
Matt gets the outside mere gets the inside 🤣 can't wait to see how it turns out.
I need a camo sectional couch
7ft tall really ?
Rockin it Texas Style! Did he mention the view?
When it’s done this house is going to be the best in whole TEXAS
👍🇺🇸💪🏻
Yessss! So happy to see updates on the abandon mansion! Would love to see when all the electrical goes in and the primer is on 😍
Baby on the roof!!!  Baby on the roof!!!  Baby on the roof!!!  You promised!!!!!
Absolutely love this video. Starting out with just spending time with the kids and then getting to see much more of the house. Yea definitely can't wait to see how you guys fill it in with interior decorating
It would be amazing to wake up to that view every morning and being able to stare up at the stars at night .. low light pollution would make that Texas sky beautiful..color me jealous..
Lincoln bought 300 Nerf darts but wait until he buys 300 rounds of ammo.. Raising them right! God bless America!🇺🇸🇺🇸
great to see how the house is coming along!
Restoring the "Demolitia Mansion" is looking Great
Should collaboration with whatsinside for smart house additions
5:23 The company google based their name off the number, because for every question their is a gogle answers but they spelled the number worng so it is ironic
Mat i loved your eggs and easter 5-ton. new merch idea: make a new piece of merch, easter 5-ton on a shirt/hoodie.
Need to redo ur first cean when house is finished
Is that the tub from hot tubs before the bunker was built
HAPPY EASTER GOD BLESS
Everyman should build his castle, ,including underground bunker lol been a great journey, can't wait for the slide into an infinity pool lol
I love the kids comments. So smart and snarky. "Eggs Really" so funny. They are their parents kids.
Yeah, still a mansion.  Looks awesome!
I’ve never realized how fast time flies when your favorite youtuber mentions something about it’s almost been 2 years since we bought something or did something big.
That settles it Matt.  5 TON must be decorated each and every holiday...
omg you can rename this project redesign reno or design derby or something like that !!
I cannot wait until you turn that landfill backyard into the pictures you showed of the wonderland
Looking great guys!
Matt, will you ever end up telling us exactly how much this whole project cost?
Of course we want to see the interior decorating! Literally nobody shows that on YouTube. They get to the sheet rock and stop there, so nobody sees the rest of the process!
My only question  Would you do it again
those lightbulbs are going to be really hard to change
Thank you sir for showing the drywall I appreciate it a lot I think your house is gonna be awesome when it’s all done are used to build houses way back in the day thank you again Matt
Restoration Ranch?
It’s crazy for me as a guy from the netherlands. How the life insurance works in America. And that you normally don’t have one. In my country you need to have one when you get 18 years old.
Wait no way it’s been almost 2 years since the start of these videos. I remember vividly the first video. Time flies way too fast
That wall that you guys are planning on putting rocks on why can't you just make it a climbing wall that would be nice so you can climb up the wall there's your rocks it may sound cool and keep it going and make sure the color is okay and all you guys have a good Easter
An awesome post today starting with dad time and the kids then showing the castle on the hill. Great stuff.
15 darts for $300 sounds like ammo prices nowadays
For the Blinds look into the type of Blinds they use in Europe. They are Metal and roll up and down like a Garage Door. You can also open them 45 degrees from top to bottom allowing them to remain open while it rains. Also Zombie resistant AF.
Looks good you should list it.
The Ranch HQ is looking good Matt
What matt doesn’t know is that his 5 ton really bout to look like the picture next year
New house/property should be called «Demo Mountain»  A worthy name for an awesome place!!
I just watched the first abandon mansion video the other day. I cant believe how far it has come. Looks so good .
Does anyone else think Matt's colour palette would be camouflage, gunmetal, and gold highlights.
geez you can really see how big that house is
Was it just me or did Mer looks super excited in this video lol
Yeah, Drywall are up!!!
Can really start to in vision the beginning of something very special about to come to be!   Best wishes!
How many Nerf pewpews  used to stop a pewpew
I died when you said your definitely related to your mom as she started coloring the Easter 5-ton pink. That poor raptor 🤣
“You are related to your mum”  Well I sure HOPE so
From what was then to What Is NOW. . .in the words of that immortal MATT ~ ~ CRAZY, IT IS CRAZY! Mere, it is looking up for you and the family. You all will geterdone. Really.
I hope mere & Steven wrap the 5 ton pink now.
Look into a lovesac sactional couch... super durable and modular!
Wow that looks AMAZING , sheetrock changes everything . Congratulations on the kids baptism 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 !!!!!!
Matt the new title should be Mere's Mansion.. lol.. just saying
ABANDONED MANSION. SHEETROCK DONE
Matt we should do custom epoxy countertops instead of supee expensive stone. I just opened my own business doing custom epoxy countertops. Id love to come do them. Literally super cheap to do and absolutely amazing finished product.
Dang nurf bullets are only $0.04 a round
Awesome home!
At 8:35 in the video...
DYE THEM CHICKEN'S
Well sheeeet it’s about time. (I’m a millennial. You’d never know it by some of my comments. Others give it away.)
Yay the unabandoned mansion!
Yay Mere only vlog for interior decoration.
You and Mere are definitely raising your kids right. It was almost nostalgic to see 7 year old coloring the Cross and stone. Good job guys👍
Great Easter Hynix.😀
My cross has 4 more straight lines sry
Put a Cummins turbo diesel v8 in your Ford
if you are liking it stop crying about a Cummins just accept you also like Fords :)
I call that house" brand used"
Who's the lucky person who has to get the cobwebs outta the high corners😃
Look'in good guys. Hav a good nite🌛
Sorry Matt, Mare has good taste so I know it will be beautiful. Your taste? Not so good!
Hill Top Ranch!
In the high ceiling room, are you going to suspend your favorite Chromino in the air ?
YEeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaa
Young man's already a rabel🤣
Why nerf if daddy got real nerfs
"The UN-abandoned mansion project"
You have to make more family videos
So he’s a “neked” not “naked” guy
How many sheet of drywall did it take?
Man your easter truck drawing is really good
Matt is such a good dad
There's a list! Lol.
The kids are the cutest this ever
This is going to be so amazing to see what your home looks like when it's done
The energy levels between these two are like night and day, lmao.
I do kitchens and I’m so happy you’re doing a chimney hood of some form over a micro hood. Hopefully you’re gonna be doing a 48” sub and wolf range!
Happy Easter to you & your family.Nice pic of thr 5 ton.Kids pics are cute too.
I really hope you keep that table thingy that you guys sat on in the first episode and find a way to make it work somewhere in your house or on one of the patios.  It's part of the history of the house.
Floated? Do you mean mudded?
i'd say that one room is about 23 feet tall.  amirite
1:56 I freaked out... currently looking for nerf rival ammo!
It’s called drywall....
Please Matt.  Do not buy Nerf brand ammo.  If you are gonna get your kids more darts go with either Adventure Force darts, if you are purchasing from walmart/or dart zone darts if you are purchasing from Target.  You can get 200 packs from either place for under 13 bucks and they are so much better than actual Nerf brand darts.
5:25 fun fact: Google is actually named after the number googol
Wow y'all have some epic views
You meant, “ the Sheetrock is done at  “ The Abandoned Mansion “ Right?  Hahahaha
House is looking good!! Feels good to accomplish that big of a project. Here's to dreamers!!
Aside from the bunker, are we going to have some kind of secret door type of thing since this place is so big, it will have plenty of opportunity to have secret places to hide some rooms.
This house is cooler by the hour … I think I would install some Hue lights here and there so you change the color from your app in the evenings, I use them & they really set a mood in a hurry 🙂
Cool day with cool kids and chicks!😉👍🌞🐥
Mere will be channeling Tony the Tiger by the end of this
I love how done mere is with Matt😂
Easter Truck t-shirt!
God bless this family!!! So wholesome
THE DEMO MAHAL  Or the FORMER ABANDONED MCMANSION
Necked. LMAO😂😂 You Texans talk hilarious I used to talk the same.
4:26 "You are related to your mom" Whoa, my mind is blown.
Massive respect for spending time with your kids instead of driving at the Freedom 500.  Next time, tell Cleetus not to schedule his events on family holiday weekends.
Those drywall hangers are insanely fast, so impressive
I think I started out with vet ranch, then discovered demo ranch, demo ranch had entertaining content but rookie production in its infancy, I think mere was in very few demo ranch, and I'm sure they must have been in some but I dont remember the kids in any demo, I'm not even sure how long I've been watching off the ranch now, but I've grown to really love it, it is basically a wholesome family show...ish, man I feel like I've watched the kids grow up, I cant believe how big they are now. link is awsome he makes me laugh almost as much as mat. "those rules are stupid, I'm not listening to them" lol, a young man after my own heart. his own man, maybe he will grow up to be a leader. thanks for another great vid mat.
Call it the Matt & Mere Homestead.
"Google things on it" my nephew discovered that recently as well lol
Demolition Manor is looking good.
Im so happy for you & ur family!! Its amazing to watch you guys build this house. Seems like it was just yesterday you guys posted that you just bought the abandoned mansion. You took on a HUGE project and made it happen. God bless you all.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙😁
Looks awesome guys love it see the joy in mare
OMG I was so excited to see the remodel pins and needles on the waiting so meredith you will soon be moving in and decorating oh  girl take your time and do what makes you happy ,I am so excited ,did I tell you I'm so excited awwwwwwww like Charlene brown
A family vlog like the good old days!
This is awesome
red cable means smoke alarms or carbon monoxide alarms
with white-washing/priming, and the 20ft high walls in some places, painting is gonna take Mere forever! I hope at least someone's helping :o
The house SO awesome ! TY!
I hope link knows he's got the best dad in the world.     Well, maybe not THE best. MY dad took me to see monster trucks.
When your dog thinks it’s a lap puppy and it’s not a puppy no more.
Make a "I'm not listening to that, that's just dumb rules" shirt.
Ps I'm not trying to dictate you style choices lol but I know some people do plaster in those vaulted ceilings because you can shape it perfect and it takes away any sharp lines in caused by the drywall and these guys....idk who but some people do custome art on those ceilings. It's SOOOO gorgeous. I've only seen it once in reap life.
Mer's side channel- Don't tell Matt how much i spent.
13 minutes into the video Matt said “Look at that View”.. new record!!!
Came here for Sheetrock... Ended up watching some wholesome family activities. Very nice.
I'm thinking 20ft-24ft ceiling
I didn’t know what sheet rock was so I thought that it was sheets of rocks 😂
That view! I'm in flat ground Louisiana, the furthest view we get is to the next pine tree.
Villa on the hilla
The chicks too look good ( meat chickens)
Lincoln- “I’m not gonna listen to that it’s just dumb rules”  Matt- “yeah... YEAH”
It’s a great view !
First episode of house on the hill Texas style
Random electrician here. they'll probably cut the holes for the island after you get it set so they can center it correctly
Cabinets and Shelves? How about a bad a$$ surround sound system in those corners?
Should gone with a chevy
Mere's inner decorator will come out
Growing up without a dad, and now 31, watching you with your children makes my heart SO happy! I know there's good dads out there!
I knew he was goin to draw able 😂😂
Hey Matt, I think it's time for some payback, mere is always wearing that multicam black now...  So her car should too..
You need a BAF for that 900 foot ceiling. LOL
you know they say when you got the drywall up you are about half way done with the house... just gonna put that out there to float, hehehe(evil laugh)
9:06 it’s cool to have high ceilings but you should build a little loft with a spiral staircase there and utilize that room ( although it’s not lacking in that house)
I love these family vlog parts.
After Superstorm Sandy, when the various crews came in to fix different parts of the house, there was one team to tear out and replace the sheetrock that had gotten soaked. And one of the sheetrockers was a woman. And I started to sing, "Sheena is, a sheet-rocker!"
I don't wanna say it but i feel compelled to........ Did the one picture make anyone think maybe it was a little phallus?
I have loved all of the Demolition Wrench episodes lately, but I've been missing the kids in the vlog.
That’s going to be sooooo beautiful. So good to see positive people
Nurf Bolets. Cute
I would have kept the Shower Tower.
Would be a bad time to find out it's built on top of an unknown volcano, or an Indian burial ground.  :|       :P
I would hate to be that Sheetrock crew that is sooooooooooooo much work omg
Video starts at 8:25
Now its off to paint
15:24 WAIT? Matt just So he’s happy there’s no more run stuff in the house? But dudes totally spoiled rotten AND he’s in the house? .... I’m confused 😂
Hey matt the ranch should be called sunrises paradise
Awesome a new non abandoned not a mansion video!!!
Lincoln said something so smart that Matt had the look it up on his phone lol
Day one of asking what Matt's favorite football team is.
Um it is a "Google" that's why they named their company Google hahhaah
That table needs to be made into some type of furniture for the house!
I loved when Addie colored Matt's truck pink. Definitely her mother's daughter. I'm also impressed Linc knows what a googol is.
matt: no more episodes on the masion  also matt: does about 5 to 10 videos in a row about the masion
Mer seems like she dont give a fuck anymore lol
that's a lot of rock
Bran the welder sounds like a character from game of thrones.
Just when I think it’s all over, you pull me back in.
It's greeeat... Lol so much enthusiasm.
"Are you coloring my easter truck pink? You are definetely related to your mom."  😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Mat, i know this will sound stupid, but check out Ikea for smart lighting and smart blinds for the windows. Ive recently found out about ikeas smart system and love it. You can set it up so that a single button will dim/turnoff/brighten the lights while at the same time opening/closing the shades. So you can have a magic "MOVIE TIME" button in the living room and it darkens the whole room.
Looks about 24' tall.... Always making things seem bigger than they really are lol
thats a small kitchen.
It's great...and volia it is....... I tell ya painting the main lounge ceiling is going to give ya vertigo.......It's also great to see the family looking so happy and healthy!
I can already imagine you guys all snuggling together in you house spreading joy and love all over each other
So fortunate. Matt, I was 49 years old and my kids were moved out living elsewhere before I could afford to build my dream house. Count your blessings. So glad you're raising your children with Christ. Bless you.
Ok so we've seen that ford behind your house for the last 3 or 4 video now let me is it broke down because it's a ford? Or did someone abandon it because it's a ford?
Yay the ranch is back!
No longer abandoned mansion it is the Texas Hilltop Manor.
Slowly getting there!  *Little does he know that the last 10% is 50% of the work*  Looking good!
Can we see what the bunker looks like in the next update video?
The list is adorable
Matt is the kind of dad I want to be when I have kids. Happy Easter💕
How about starting a new series for the rest of the renovation/build of the house. I know I’m not the only one who REALLY, REALLY, REALLY wants to see the entire process. Right up through decorating/furnishing. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE US HANGING!!!!!!!!!
At least you get to interior decorate the pew pew vault
now its finaly looks like something, NICE! in the Netherlands we say: Duurt lang! ;)
Can you say (indoor zip line)?
Quit trying to ammo gouge Lincoln 🤣
btw, googol is pronounced google.
The beginning of the video is so pure and we sadly need more of that in the world, also, seeing the house with sheetrock shows how massive it is and I personally think yall still have the right to call it a mansion😆
Love the ceiling height
Please! would like to see this all on the playlist as its own video, even though it's smaller under the playlist :(
Congratulations on 4 mil subscribers 👍🇬🇧 🇬🇧
Lincoln's penmanship is on the same level as mine...... I'm 19 years old.....
Crazy how the girls sound like their mother !
Annie looks so much like her mum its mad
"Stone moving away" um.... not sure what I was thinking.
Your kids are great brother, got two of my own, I know the feels, so glad to see them in the vids, you’ve taught them well!
Lol! “I’m not listening to that, that’s just dumb rules”
THOSE 45 PEOPLE WHO DISLIKED ARE GAY LMFAO
Astounding Progress!!!  Thanks
"And the lord roseth up out of the tomb, jumped up in his 5-ton, and rode off lookin baller to pick up his homies" -The Book of the Easter Truck, probably
Mere: Deco Ranch!  lol
Did a tiny room of sheet rock with my dad once. The only confusing pieces were a door, and a window. It was a nightmare. Those guys did great, can't believe that you can actually be good sheetrock
How on earth are you going to change the light bulbs in your living room?!?!?
The sheetrock is DONE!! #AbandonMansion
It is funny how the house seem smaller with just studs and seems bigger when the sheetrock goes on.
Hey Matt or anyone that’s tried this I’m looking to move from Virginia, to Texas any pointers or tips I’d really appreciate it so much. Thank you! 🙏
You are definitely in family with your mother!!! I'm dead 😭😭😭
“Are you drawing my Easter truck pink? You are related to your mom” I was dying in laughter and ptsd from the pink raptor. Should’ve wrapped it pink again before time it to WD
Anyone else going straight to hell thinking; that don’t look like no rock that’s moving.....
What’s up Matt I’m kyle I have watched you for years and first saw you on demolition ranch  I am a big hunter and love guns and I have to admit I haven’t watched The abandon mansion series from the beginning but just recently started watching it and I cannot stop  P.S I love your new Ford
Merre needs to take over the vlogging for the interior decorating
Haters will unlike this video. What is there to hate this is awesome
You can really start to visualise it now, looks great
That house has no sole., no character, just square footage.
Fantastic, you and Mere should be very proud. Looking forward to next video
Have fun changing those light bulbs...
Them windows going to be hard to clean 👀
Will the "bathroom" tower be a jacuzzi?
El Rancho Del Hermosa Vista is looking good.
Matt is like it’s not a Mansion, totally a Mansion
Love you fine people, you make me want to move to Texas...
Gotta upgrade the intro so the 5 ton and fire truck are on there!
the Lincoln list is probably one of the most hearthwarming things ive seen on this channel
I have an idea....build a viewing platform at the "mansion". A LIGHTNING viewing platform. Have a clear dome that will keep the rain off, encased in a Faraday cage. That way, y'all can at least see the lightning and maybe record it. People love thunder and lightning videos, you know.
Matt I really hope you do a smart home because my grand parents built their home and the smart home model was the smartest thing they’ve done with that house because it makes complements everything and there personal life
Make sure you use a good quality carpet pad... it really is something you will be glad you did in the future.
Love to see you guys
Matt being a dad is so wholesome somtimes he’s jus doin the stuff I did with my dad when I was a kid it’s super cute
Did anyone else quickly come over when you saw the bronco on instagram hoping matt would say something
Before sheetrock it's just a bunch of sticks
I'm thinking if you were to decorate the house, there would be multiple murals with you holding guns, and riding a badass animal...lol, maybe in the bunker!
Happy late  easter
So what are you doing for water is it going to be city or county or like I had well water and is it been drilled already?
House is looking so awesome. The time with you & the kidos was pretty cool. It's really nice that you let us in on your life like that.
That is awesome moved  in before you know it
Just saying you want a Cummins and that Ford just smoosh them together. Cummins swap the Ford
You should have mere do a channel on just the house decorating i’d tune in everytime i cant wait to see how the house will look
Turn the 5 Ton into an easter truck!!!
Dude your living my dream you inspire me to try
Hi
Matt is a great dad...more elbow grease.
Slowly but surely but who is surely 🤔
So wholesome!  Living the life, Matt.
Hah call back to when mere made Matt’s truck pink😂🤣
That is freakin Beautiful Home. I’m so happy for you and your Family. I can’t wait to see the end result! 🥰
Next demoranch video: Can a 50BMG crack a super thick foundation? :) haha
It looks absolutely amazing, this is going to be one gorgeous family home, I am very excited to start seeing the decorating and furniture going in
It’s going to be fabulous, I can’t wait for Mere to get her interior design skills on it!
Matt get a gold rpg lamp
Think of the size of the Christmas tree you can put in your room with the high ceiling 😍
No offense dude, but yeah, she has much better ideas than you do for decorating.
First of all, the kid's posters are great. Secondly, Happy Belated Easter. Thirdly, the tour of your mansion is wonderful. Keep up the good work.
Those silkie chickens are retarded. We have turken silkies and man they are ugly
Don't let those kids grow up. Ever.🥺
What a cool Dad!!
"Mere doesn't like any of my ideas" I bet when he suggested railings made of ARs for the stairs she realized she was going to have to do all the decorating on her own.
ROCK WALL in the living room? EPIC!
We haven't heard you speak Spanish in a while or two how is the the Spanish progress going
A googolplex has a googol of zeros and I'm pretty sure it's the biggest number there is! 1010^100
Matt: "you cant get those you're too young"  Link: *"S H A L L  N O T  B E  I N F R I N G E D"*
I still believe you should call it the "demo homestead"
Really love the Reno stuff!!! Yall are such a great family and seem super genuine and accepting of everyone 💙 thanks for making awesome vids :)
That new house, is just a dream house🤩
What is the episode title you chose for your not so abandoned abode?
You need to bring back the thiccc shirt and just put a foundation on it
So much wholesome....
Matt, do you have gray hair?
worlds best youtube couple
I just cant get enough of you spending time with your kids. Keep doing what your doing.
You need a wall made of bullet casings
Those are some tall door frames
Your making great time, considering all the variables We love watching it come together!
I know I can go back and watch your previous vet videos but I wish you would continue making them it was a great thing you were doing.  These videos is how I was introduced to you and really enjoyed learning from what you were doing. It made such a difference for these beautiful animals you helped.  Would you ever decide to do this again?
bad choice for nerf darts
I'll trade you for mere.
Make and easter truck shirt now
You should put a washer dryer in your master bathroom. Make life easier on your self.
Should have put one of those sunken conversation pits in that large, tall room.
How could people dislike this video
Juist put a cummins in that ford, we all know you are gonna do it one day, we can hear it
Sheeeeeeet it rocks.....no ? No? Ok i'll leave....
"Turning into a beautiful house..." No its always been-ish
That’s going to be ridiculously expensive to heat and cool
Have your three children been Baptized?
Its looking beautiful....im so happy for you and I'm so excited.
This guy pimping Insurance now......
Man I wish I could trim the place for you
Your family is just perfect.  God bless you all 😀
i just wanted to take sum time to say how happy i am for your success with the new home! i luv seeing joy in your faces after ah long hard day at work !!
Spouses with life insurance die, according to my true crime shows it happens 100% of the time
hell yeah, 40006 episodes in and still loving it
What. About. The. BRONCO?
The only thing that was missing was Matt singing in his is pick up to make this a full on retro episode... Lovin it. The house is looking great.
Hey Matt, I've been watching the mansion series from the very beggining and I get that calling it a "mansion" doesn't sound pleasing to you. But could we get separate videos about the progress? With the dope intro and the index picture. I would be so so happy and I think so do many of us^^
Okay but here me out. The 5 ton kinda looks pretty beastie in pink....
DAAMN that was fast oh well they know what there doing heheheheheh
Mere is adorable. <3
The house of theseus
Is about to be the not so abandoned mansion
Can't wait to see more,  the final stuff is what I was waiting for
Just don’t make the interior all boring.
How do you find the time to be such a good dad ! Such a fantastic family, love you all and your films...
It's great!
Damn you should have filmed them sheet rocking that huge ass room I'm dying to see how they did it ! 😕
I wonder if the person that originally started this mansion year's ago has ever seen any of these videos.
Matt are you still a Veterinarian? Just wondering I don't hear or see anything about it anymore so wasn't sure if you retired from that business or what? By the way your house is beautiful can't wait to see it totally done.
Awesome house Matt! We love watching your updates from over the pond in the UK 🇬🇧
Love you Matt, thanks for making content.
English translation, The Plasterboard is done. Sheetrock, it is neither a sheet or rock... you Americans are strange. At least you guys can buy a fire arm without jumping through 50 hoops.
In a few thousand years time archaeologists will discover this place and interpret it as the home of a warrior king.
Man Matt those kids are growing fast over these past couple years.  Beautiful family as always , wish you all much success good health and happiness
This house has turned out amazing! I have a question about the pool, when is that getting put in?
That little table better make it's way to Demo HQ and be a coffee table
as a son of a drywall crontractor i know how close it is to being done... if your doing smooth wall i feel bad for the painters...  havent watched it yet
👍️👍️👍️👏👏👏👌😀😀
You are related to your mom 😂
8:34 the notabandoned notmansion
It is looking amazing! You guys have come a long way!! Can't wait to see it progress and get to the point of move in day!
Yo ngl I watched like the first 3 episodes of the abandoned house, and coming back to look at it now is crazy. I hope to do something like this with my family in the future.
I haven't seen crayons for AGES😂😂😂
Matt you need to save the old table that came with the house. Put it at demo hq or somewhere.  It’s special!
Idea. Get your kids to all draw a picture and turn each into a shirt. Limited edition  shirts.
I just wish that when Matt lists the current house I could afford it. I love that property. Good luck with the new home Matt and Family! Cant wait to see how amazing it will become.
it look like giant eggs in the back of the 5-ton
You can get 1000+ nerf darts on AliExpress for a similar price.
WOW!!!  What a major difference!!!  Awesome looking and the paint isn't even on yet!
I love Mere. Yeah great!.  😂😂😂😂😂
THE RANCH!
Mere channel now!
Now comes the wood trim and cabinets.
I will do this with my kids tell them to make a list of things they want to do and we’ll try to knock it out but I still got a couple years before I want kids
It's going to be a huge job to paint this place!
Matt doesn’t get to touch any of the inside of the house for style but the garage is all his
I think you should changed the name renovating the abandon Mansion to  Finishing the big house
You should definitely take your crayon drawing and make it a t-shirt kids would love it
You've come a long way an all coming together 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌♥️🙏🙏
An 11 pm shout out from South Africa love this channel
Call the house Shirley, just like you said slowly but Shirley.
Gogolplexian, is my favorite number.
mat wins $10,000,000,000 in the lottery  mar be like: okay
It looks so good with all the drywall up ! We can really see how big it is.
The wise man built his house apon a rock!
The video Starts at 8:30
Wow, the difference from then to now. So exciting to see. Thank you.
Deff needs 2 dump the Ford and get t he new hemi trx
just wait till you move in and the ghost come out
I remember when you shot the 50 in the mansion
Matt actually wrote that list.
congrats to you both for gettting this far. Im a contractor so i know exactly how much work you guys did. Stay tough and don’t stress. Im sure you will turn that abandoned mansion into a beautiful mansion full of love and laughter.
Good as always
4:18 Yes, seems to be in the family !
You are related to your mom 🤣
Why didn’t they do all the corners?
Is there a link below to sign up for the guest room ?
O yes mere will get to finish off the in side👍
You have gotta keep that table and use it for something! Maybe a table for the middle of the living room
It's amazing how different it looks with the sheetrock up, much brighter.  It's going to look awesome once the trim work is done.
How about renaming The Abandoned Mansion....... The Mansion on Sunset Hill.
Mere doesn't seem to be to impressed.
When you gunna do a video to see if you're house will stop a bullet
The table should stay, as a memory
It's looking amazing but damn your heating and cooling cost is gonna by costly with those big ceilings
Anyone else read the title as "She truck"? Nahh I'll just see myself out
Officially gotten further then the original owners. Congrats!
What the title should’ve read:   “THE SHEETROCK IS DONE IN THE NOT ABANDONED MANSION!!!”
All the interior videos should be filmed by Mere
finally wait is over love from india sir
In fact a googol is so large the universe will die before 1 googol seconds have pasted
Matt if you need a hardwood floor guy. I’ll come out to Texas from California to install them.
What the hell is the stone moving away?
Matt what you can do so that mere will have to let you help with the interior decoration. If she doesn't let you help, she must do burnout
❤️❤️
Matt I keep telling you about the area of your stairs that has no place for your railing to dead end into , I’m talking about the wall next to the small set of stairs! After you put your post on the floor the center line of your rail will hang over the edge of the wall . That wall should have been built out towards the small stairs another 2” at least . I hope you read this and get it now while your early enough into the build ! I told you about it while it was in frame stage but you haven’t addressed it yet . Just trying to give you a heads up bud . House looks great !!!
Introducing the boy to the horrors of rising ammunition prices early I see.
Love all that you do and time with the kids is perfect you are a beautiful family and so much fun to follow Mere has all the details love that too :-)
AK- 50 mounted on rock fireplace !
Yea, it looks really good inside.   And I can hardly wait to see what Mere does with the inside.  The folding doors she found at the show you guys went to, and some of the other cool stuff she was oogling, it’s gonna be awesome!
I think you just gave the Abandoned Mansion a new name in this video.  You called it the Big House.  I think it fits.
My chickens have been slowly dying off. Three died due to cold when they were chicks and four died to a raccoon and now one to a dog. I want to get some more now. When the weather warms up a little
“You are related to your mom”
trade your ford with Branden's truck
It is starting to look like a very nice house with big rooms and a big view.  Keep the updates coming.
The big house 👍
Have you planted the man cave seeds yet?lol
Loved seeing the big smile on Mere's face seeing the sheetrock up. She sees the light at the end of the tunnel for sure and I could see the design wheels spinning. Love it! So very happy for you guys!
this was such a good family episode! keep being a great dad! Also, more mega house videos!
I just love y’all
Have you had any success finding the original owners?
Good luck with changing those ceiling light bulbs.
It’s looking FANTASTIC!!! I’m SO happy for you all.
Wow I love it👍
Love this place keep up the good work. Can't wait to see what you get upto outside with the pool and stuff
I read the title as shee trock. What the hell is shee trok?? i'm a dummie
please give the series a name ... like hilltop mansion  ep1
It's 6 sheets of drywall tall, so it's 24 feet.
Perfect Easter episode, the reno mansion is dead and now it's revived!!
Your son is a year older then mine and i see them doing alot of the same things. Kids are the best!
For a house that size your actually making good progress.
"Sweet, we finished the list. Now I don't have to hang out with y'all anymore. See ya."  I felt that on a spiritual level after being out of work and home for three months. Love ya though, son!
Matt go for wafer lights instead of can lights. They are very small, efficient and they fit in the holes for the can lights bc they a 6” wide. They are also super easy to replace if ever needed and you can get then in different shades if you weren’t going to do white.
Ahhh. Another good quality video. Not much of these anymore. Love the vids Matt. Great work.
It looks really good!!
❤️
Its gonna be an awesome house! But Matt, if you had the opportunity to do it all over again would you? when you realize all the time and effort that went into this one, was it worth it in the end? Gonna be a great house for future family gatherings and such.
Holy Sheet rock! Looks super nice, King and Queen of the DEMOLITIA'S? PALACE IS AMAZING! I mean look at those tall ceilings my God if that isn't a house for a king 👑 and Queen 👑 I don't know what is. Gosh that view, those windows, that bunker! Ahhh! this house is absolutely insane and I love it!
I think he's only sponsoring insurance so he can tell us he's gonna shoot somebody in the next demo ranch
We do care about the view
Happy birthday Lincoln 🎂🥳
Its looking awesome but I weep for whoever has to sand that! There is going to be like a foot of dust! Can't wait for your guy's moving day! Start packing!
It's greeaaattt
please no textured walls please no textured walls 🤞🏼
Dang you can draw really good I can't even draw a stickman man even your kids draw better than me
I was laughing so hard when she said watch out for tornado he is heavy
I swear I look forward to the end just to hear his brother ask about the camera.
Coming along nicely. I am excited to see Mere’s interior design decisions. Awesome to see the kids drawing Easter images, reminds me of when I was a kid with my brothers doing the same thing.
Makes me Happy to see you and your family so happy and I pray for all your health and safety...along with lots of Smiles👍😁
i love your oldest she puts you in  your place!!!
Someone give this family a tv show!!
Now yall have to keep that wooden table thing there, as a reminder. 🤣
Looking awesome bro watch out for bears
Actually impressed with that 2d truck you drew 😂
Hmmm hope that mountain isn't a volcano... maybe that's why they quit building... 🤔🤷🏻‍♂️
Your method of dart pricing sounds like how they are pricing lumber 😂
Keep showing
Here before the notification
"Buy nerf bullets".   That's how your Dad got started Linc.
I am glad to know that you guys are Christians and that your kids know about Him to. 👍
Need to refinished that thing you say on and make it part of the house when your all done. Be a keep safe lol.
Lincoln really favors His Mom. Matt, you are the American dream.
matt on the 5000th day of living in the new house: god look at that view
"15 darts for 300 bucks" sounds like gun store prices to me 🤔
I want to see the underground bunker again!😂
I can't wait for the 4wheeler trails to get made
i hope you're going to bullnose the drywall corners -- it looks so much better and softens room acoustics.
Potato small
Matt's surprisingly good at drawing a five ton
2 years already :o omg
Matt Lincoln pronounced it, googol is pronounced the same as Google. Google just changed the spelling and used a number for their name.
You're fighting pollen meanwhile we are fighting April Snowstorms up here🤣🤣🤣 ps house is looking KILLER!!!!
The is coming along very nicely and the kids are great .
Idk if anyone here has said it. But as an electrician I almost always leave wires rolled up in the ceiling until the island is set then cut them in so they are perfectly symmetric in case the island placement changes. Cheers
imagine how big of a Christmas tree yall can get
So glad it’s coming together
You are going to need a REALLY tall ladder to change the lights.
Honestly your such a wholesome dad like I wish my dad was like you.
Now time for tiling the bathrooms and kitchen and having wood paneling throughout the house.
now that the abandoned mansion is getting done its good that Adam got the abandoned compound :DD
Love the Ranchsion!
Having your voice echoing in the rooms  sounds like a home!!!
Huge dreamhouse <3
I'm stuck at sheetrock stage for also a year Need to get on the grind & knock it out. But not is big as Abandoned Mansion. Few years I'll be at that level. Congratulations
I really appreciate you showing some of your family's faith on the channel.  I know YouTube is not always the easiest place to do that, so I salute you.
Mere looks a lot happier now than in that first video lol
It looks amazing.
MATT!   No view of the office garage or Content Condo!  For shame.
AMAZINNNNNG!!! I am remodeling my home myself. Cant wait to see the the final progress.
The bunker house!!!!!!
3:48 those are definitely meres' kids
If there is anything less than a 20 foot Christmas tree in that living room we will be disappointed.
Mer is 5'3'' and the great room in 24' tall. Just eyeballing don't take my word for it and don't tempt us by saying there's no way to tell how tall it is when sheet rock is 4' tall
Being the painter and walking into the living room, i would say fuck that and leave
Lincoln should represent the people against the ATF.  "I'm not listening to that.  That's just dumb rules!"
Well that was quick
Love the dad time you spend with your kids and the list I thought the tables and the sinks you and Mere made were pretty nice together.
That's waaay more house than I'd want to clean. A day just to vacuum it.
Love you guys hope you are well in this Times my notifications are on bill are cool and mariah is Beautiful 💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚💛❤️💜💙🧡💚
Can't wait to see Matt take a shower , hehehehe ........
Hey Matt the company I work for installs really high end blinds that would go great in you place!!
That look demo gave you when you told to jump in the pool. Lol
This update is satisfactory.
Yay!!! So excited to see Mer decorating
Love it guys I started watching at the start I remember you running through the house with The Reaper.!! 😂🤣
Does everyone use 90210 as a zip code in websites? I know I do.
Hi Matt hope your doing well :)
Did someone rip a wet one when coloring?😂😂😂😂😂
:)
It’s really exciting now we can see it coming together
Lovesac. Do it.
I say Renolitia Ranch . Love the progress being a carpenter of 36 years in the trade i can truly appreciate all you have done! Awesome family too!
Why is your wife so 🔥
How are you going to change those ceiling lights in the tall room?
Me:Sees this Video yuo say so WE bought an abontened masnion yuo remember i Just INSTANT GO WANTCH FIRSR VIDDEO
The cherish house
Do you know what you can fit in the house............5ton
You both made my day.  thank you. the house is gorgeous
Love watching what going on the BIG HOUSE.
Hay just remember you might be hateing your self now but the future you is thanking you.
It is looking good, the long haul will be worth it. Good Job
How much is your painting bid?? I have a company in Wyoming and am curious.. I bet I could do it for less lol
Not gunna lie, if Mere is the one who whose the colours for the outside, the inside is probably going to be pretty boring
Day one till now, awesome journey.
Put paint on boxing gloves and have Linc box some abstract art onto a poster board.
lets leave matt to decorating the bunker interior
15 darts for $300 sounds like the actual prices
I can't wait to see it when it's finally complete.
Will Matt reply to my comment?
Lincon has gotten do smart ahaha
The house is coming out very nice can't wait to see it in all its glory, it's going to be awesome. Thank you so much for the awesome videos.
You'll have to upcycle that table as a feature in your house 😁😁😁
More videos mate
I knew as soon as he started drawing it was the 5 ton 🤣
Now begins the adventures of Carriker Estates.
yaaaay
It’s funny how I was just ordering nerf guns n bullets for me n my lil sister
I love your “Easter Thing” 🛻. 🤣😂🤣  By the way I say that being a Christian and a gun lover and a truck lover
HACIENDA ON THE HILL is looking good guys
It's so awesome to see how that Beautiful house is coming together! And how much bigger it looks now! I'am so happy for y'all to get to build you'r dream home 🎉🎊 Cheers from Northern Sweden 🍻
You took the verse from the Bible to build your house upon a rock quite literally
"It's an Easter truck" 🤣🤣🤣
New series name idea: Rock Top Ranch
your new series should be called supersizing the mcmansion
Wrap the 5 ton pink for the kids
Congratulations guys. The true test of a marriage is making it through a house build.
" No..those are just stupid rules".  I love it! Spoken like a true AMERICAN!
How can it have 1.5k likes but less than 100 views? I am confused
good job guys you worked really hard. and thats cool you guys had the house made the way you want. and are you gonna make a garage for the trucks at some point
Wait no bullet proof sheet rock?
Nice Casa de Double M.     Mere and Matt.   Nice guys Meredith did a great job of getting the finishing touches done....
Lincoln response to the nerf age: "Im not listening to thats just dumb rules".  How every gun owner thinks when the government tries to ban firearms
#foreshadowing if your 5 ton gets wrapped pink I would die laughing my ass off
It's awesome I wanna see how the yard comes out
I am SOOOOO happy to know Mere is taking over. Sorry, Matt, you can be the cameraman, makeup artist? bodyguard? chauffeur?
OMG you have walls
Noooo it isn’t the shower tower now, the tub tower
Geez those ceilings...
you maybe want to do something special with your daughter - see looks so left out....
It’s drywall!
Rules? We don't need no stinking rules! Lincoln's awesome.
Science teacher: draw a plant cell Also science teacher: that's a truck Me: Its a plant truck
Out of all the stuff done on these channels, by far the best to see is good parenting. Nothing more important. Love seeing it.
Room with fireplace is definitely not the place for movies.  TV would be way too high above the fireplace
24 feet to the beams!
I love this idea of letting your kid create a list of things they would like to do with you during the day! I want to steal this for when I have kids.
COVID times be like: 15 nerf bullets for $300 due to ammo shortage
you could call it OnTheRanch just putting it out there
Dude, that's parenting done right! Those drawing Matt 😉 you're doing it right.
I think they crave some daddy time🐣
matt you got to keep the table as a memories for you to see when the house is done and you can be like this table was here when we got this house.
You should do more stuff with LunkersTV
Amazing house, fit for royalty
I am thinking that from the house you could put a zip line to Demo HQ.
Sheetrock = plasterboard to the rest of the world
You bought an abandoned mansion, doing major transformations to turn it into your family's house!! Now, once you are totally living there, it will then become "Your Home" ...   =8^)
Great seeing you with the kids having fun 😍 House looks awesome too 😁
figures - Texas tree pollen is the size of tree leaves everywhere else...
All’s I got to say.... noice
So, you got a name for the house yet? :D
amazing piece of art 4:00
Lincoln rocks best boy ever and your an alright father, lol your a d@€n good father and all around great guy.......
Just how many bedrooms and baths are in this place???
Talk about free ranch chickens
Buy a Cummins motor an put it in the f-350!
The room with the 10ft high ceiling is just begging for a chandelier like sheeeesh
Looks Great! So happy for you guys!
Mere's manor
The house is starting to really take shape inside & out.  looks great!
Nice
New series: Mere's Renovations. Matt's not allowed......
such a small living room tho, lol
Yall make my day so much better. Love you guys so much! Shout out to you guys from Appleton, Wisconsin! HELL YEAH! Keep up the good work and videos, we love it so much. You keep my days bright in a world of darkness. Thank you!
Ok at this point we need to find a YouTube channel to step up and cummins swap that darn truck.
Nice house. Being 6'8 that would be a treat not to slock my head on every door frame in there.
Glad this video series didn’t get abandoned.
Just call it “The New House on a Hill”
The house is lookin great and the view is amazballs
That Sheetrock looks good. Great craftsmanship.
with the cost of construction materials now, you have no choice but to move in...
I love the relationship that you have with your kids.  The naked remark was TMI.  I think the house is really coming along.  Have a great week 😀😊
Just dumb rules
Looks good! Thanks for showing the progress.
I looked at the title thinking wtf is a shee-trock hahahahaha then I realized you were saying sheetrock, oh man I'm from ky leave me alone
New series name "my brand new 20 year old house"
This is so exciting!! It’s absolutely fabulous and HUGE! Thank you so much for sharing with us. 👏👏👏👏👏👏
I thought he was gonna go south and have a egg minnigun mounted on the truck
That house is looking so much more insane now! 😍
Annie looks exactly like Mere and Lincoln looks exactly like Matt 🤣🤣
great things doesn't come over night.
7:15 I feel like I have heard a specific gecko so that before
do a update on the bunker
I was hoping u would keep the arched ceiling but have the wood accent on it. A hole arch of wood
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Call it the RAM series = Renovated Abandoned Mansion, and it will help your Ram truck withdrawal.
Hey matt, Big fan of all the channels, Been watching since Homemade shotgun shells (lol). Just a quick question on the new house. Being in the Telecomm. Industry and you being a YouTuber, How do you plan on getting internet out there to the hill? Only thing I can think of is Sat internet, but its so slow with high ping times.
Im an interior designer, and a 3D interior designer so it best be good mare, or I’ll have to criticize hard on it, lol don’t tell mare
24 feet ceilings, count the drywall.
Man I've gotten really good at skipping the 60/90 second sponsor spots, absolutely nailed it in this video
"I know you came here cause you wanna see the new house". Nah bro, the family good vibes vlog is why we're here.
4:28 that’s good to hear😅
Matt with the cost of supplies skyrocketing. How far over budget are you. Loved the interaction with the kiddos. 🇺🇸🦅✌️
If I am old, and single, and no kids, and all alone in the world... Should I have life insurance?
Now that’s one cherished house!!!
8:17 Renovation Ranch
Loved seeing you with your kids, most precious thing you can do. And loved the cross! Real meaning of Easter.
I'm happy because you guys keeping us seeing how the big house coming  and I love it I wish you have happy life when you move in
Looking good...😁
It's so hard to tell which one of Matt's kids he likes the most, like 0 clues in every single episode, not even a hint
Looking good matt!
Baby chick raising tip: To keep mulch from getting into the water and food feeders, place them on a brick or on something higher than the ground. It doesn't stop it completely, but it helps alot.
Matt gave the welding boys so much business they were able to upgrade their own trucks 😂
Artest 👌
Nice to finally see the house, thank you!
wait till this guys finds out about fummins
Buy one of those 30 ft long poles that you can attach paint rollers  to. You can also attach a fitting to grab bulbs out of the top of the ceiling when they go out.
"I'm not listening to that, that's just dumb rules." Lincoln is awesome
I absolutely love how involved your children are with The Bible, The Lord, The History... I love y'all, man
I am loving the.....  -Carriker Compound- 💙♥️🇺🇲🦅👍👍
Liking the video before watching it.
So you are keeping that table rigjt?
Love it
How are you gonna change the light 💡 bulbs 💡 omg 😳 looks really nice 👍
Off The Ranch - Dream Home
Matt blame the time frame on covid! Haha that’s what everyone does.
Matt just made a big mistake showing that “Easter truck” on video. Does anyone recall the last truck of Matt’s that was pink..... I wonder if Mere will strike again!
Was anyone else thinking rock-climbing-wall at the fireplace in the living room when they mentioned rock to the ceiling?
“They look like lumps” lol.   Matt does the truck have cancer and can u perform the surgery
Coming along nicely looking good
How many tshirts do we buy for you to make your 5 ton pink 😂
Lincs hand writing is better than my
idk what sheetrock like is it just sheets of rock
Next mtv cribs
You should start calling it the sunrise house or house of the rising sun.
Hidden door to the bunker.!!!!!!!!    This is a stolen comment, the don’t complain to me.
11mins after the video is posted and already 21,500 views.
Can you hook me up with some of those Sheetrock guys??!
Bruh the “ I ain’t listen to them dumb rules” had me dying Lincoln is great
Might have to wrap the 5ton pink now..
Matt must have thought they were really bullets when he said 15 bullets for $300
I have a feeling that the Smiths and carrikers are going o move into their house at the same time
Lincoln grew up overnight
Love the family stuff, so awesome how good of a dad you are
Video starts at 8:30
The house looks amazing!!! It won't be long before you move it!!
What a journey! Thanks for sharing. Big question: Once the house is done, what's next? You guys should have a big open house for all the YouTubers and subs. Like Texas sized party.
Me while matt was showing off all the pictures the kids drew each time he started to describe the next one: dude, that's frickin sick.
I can see that you are going with crown mold!
Looks amazing.  You have already made, will make more wonderful memories there.  Congrats you two.
Light bill!!
House is looking good. But all I can think of when looking at how high that ceiling is, is how much of a pain in the ass replacing light bulbs will be.
Wish that Ford had a Cummins, when that 6.7 PSD is a straight up better engine
Hope you have a great day!
1:44 "clean it first bub"
SOO COOL !!!
Matt, I recommend talking to Kevin at beaconblinds.com. He is amazing. They are a local to Austin, family owned business and they offer power shades that are made locally in Texas that can be connected to a smart home and operate via voice or manually. Cool solution!
The house is looking beautiful, you two have worked really hard on it. Thanks for sharing. Kevin
Is Matt gonna keep the Humvee silhouette in the intro. Or is he gonna eventually put a 5-ton silhouette?
Matt, found your channel with the abandoned mansion series.    All about family and faith, right?  Hope you have a great week!  👍
Chandelier above the tub?
2:45 I didn’t know Lincoln was practicing to be a ventriloquist, He’s pretty good at it
Hai I hope you have a wonderful day
Meredith’s true concern is how many maids are getting to help clean that castle on the hill???
Mat: its not a mansion Me: if it is just a big house, then my house is a doll house
Slowly making a house into a home.
You make me strive to be a better father everyday when I see this..I'm always working and fixing something but like u said in one of ur videos u have to find time to spend with then cause they will remember either way..just like u..and I do to..not having a father and mom always working. I remember wishing I had more time with both  . Love you guys
You guys should go around the house with a 360 camera
Matt has secretly been stalling the build so that Demo Ranch can hit 10 million at the same time as he moves his guns to his vault... 2 birds, 1 stone. Calling it now.
Why am I slow and read that as Shee-trock lmao 😂
RESURRECTION RANCH!!!
Hopefully they have a plan for top notch wifi, or they already put ethernet into the wall...
get westin champlin to cummins swap the treefiddy for you
You did not mess up the island lights.  They pull that wire when your island is in to make sure it is all centered.  Beautiful house and have watched all your videos.
you should keep that table and give it a place of honor in the final state of the house :D
the great room is 24' tall, just count the layer of drywall!
“they look like lumps of dirt” 😂😂
I’m surprised Ford hasn’t started putting an Ecoboost in those too 😂
The Cozy Casa is looking great
@OffTheRanch you need to put the Easter truck on a shirt.
Why to be an awesome parent! It is nice to see people teach kids the reason for the seasons. They are gonna be great Americans!
The house is going to go by fast now. 👍🏽👌🏽😊
WOW. The house....... WOW.
Whoever dislikes this video is messed up. I love your videos Matt 😍: )
300 neft darts for $300 sounds about right in todays ammunition prices....😂🤣😆😔😦😢😭
Matt I bet u 99999 subs if u can wreck the 5 ton
Also we’re not gonna talk about Mere being 7 Feet tall?!
300 darts!  Mere is going to be so happy to find those around the house!
youtube logic, sure i am the 7th veiwer, but the 693 like. that makes sence.(I CAN"T SPELL)
Annies great at drawing for her age
Keep up the good work
Cool
Again I say, "Demolitia Domicile"
Loving that cherished house
Since I'm early I'm gonna ask. Update on the shirt sales and mere doing a burnout?
does demo has tail
Sheet rock or drywall?
The new house is looking good guys
What a solid dude.
HEY !   It's a HOUSE !!
Anyone else read the title as "Shee Trock" ?
Those high windows are going to be horrible to clean. Good luck
64 views and over 1000 likes I do not understand how it goes Love your channel hope you are well in this Times 💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛💚💜💙🧡❤️💛
Huge accomplishment, congrats! If I'm being honest, I am most looking forward to the landscaping when you're done!!
If only ammo was as cheap and findable as nerf darts.
Matt what about the backyard
Anyone else read it shee-trock at first glance?
Hats off to the sheet rock guys. That was a big job.
CONGRATS to everyone who is early and who found this comment"🏆
Dude the "its greeeat" made me cackle. That's a solid meme.
Not to be hateful or anything like that but that floating ain’t it that’s some messed up floating but I do hope is just the first hand
If meres 7 foot she’s in the wrong profession
I can't get over the fact that Matt's drawing was actually pretty good.
It’s the McMansion! Or Un-Abandoned mansion. Yes, a McMansion is a real thing.......
I bought murch
Matt u need a small mansion gpr dozer
Sheetrock is done?  Congrats, you're 50% complete!
Ah mate you really are blessed with such an amazing family 😁 big luv from the u.k

This cherished home is starting to look complete, can’t wait to see the end result. Been loving watching the progress!!

That stone looked like a falic item shooting something unmentionable
No pic
Can't wait to see the kitchen!
I hope to one day be an awesome dad like Matt
Finally another update on the build

I GO THREW 300 BULETS IN A SINGLE GAME INSTEAD SPEND 40 DOLLARS AND GET 2000 MUCH BETTER DEAL
your kids are really judgemental huh
You should definitely make the door to your underground bunker Hidden. Imagine a bookshelf that opens up into an underground arsenal...
I wish 300 cartridges were 15.00
Please god don't do wallpaper
It's been awesome seeing this build come together! Hi from New Zealand!
Get a fish tank in the new house !!!
