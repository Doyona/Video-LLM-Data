This might not seem true, but it is. So when I was 5 years old in 2013 I asked my dad to buy me a Nintendo wii for my birthday. It's finally my birthday and my father gave me a big rectangular box. I rip the cover open to see an actual (this is so real pls believe this)WiWi Console. I am not joking this is what I actually got for my 5th birthday. My father asks me "do you like it son" and I turn to him with tears in my eyes and lie that I did. After that, my mom scrapped the WiWi.

Life lessons number 99, never drink and watch a Steven He new video, you'll probably choke to death. At least with videos you've seen before you can prepare, but new ones you're going in blind, and are screwed. Also steroid woody broke me, good god that was rough.

You should do offbranded movies, there has been a lot of parodies over the years

Tuna would probably be a brand name I might seriously buy… and I don’t wear brand clothes consciously.
“WiWi” sounds sus
“Who wants to play with a WiWi?!?” People who are poor: Choices must be made...
Star Wart!!! … They should probably see a doctor.  😂
The fact that he was going to spend lots of dollars on a Nintendo is unrealistic for Asian parents too expensive
“Ball” had me absolutely dying
I like how when steven’s dad comes in the shopkeeper immediately gets off his phone
Hello uh do you guys sell emotional damage, um no actually we have mental discomfort, MENTAL DISCOMFORT what the hell
He finally got sent to jesus😂 lol
I lost it when he yelled wiwi 🤣🤣🤣🤣

I love the off brand videos the most 😂 they always have the drum beat in the background when showing the product adding the extra comedy 😂😂
Literaly  in my city wiwi sounds like wee wee which means pee XD
Wiwi is what we call pee in my family and the reason why is because it sounds similar to umihi which means pee in filipino, we are filipino

“You got Steven He?” “We got Stefan She”
SPERM
I’m waiting for the day he makes one of these but the roles are reversed like it’ll be “IN AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE” and the dad comes in looking for off brand things and the seller only has original things but then he starts questioning if the og things are knockoffs and reality starts bending due to this singularity. Like if u think this is a good idea and don’t if u think it’s a good idea
My favorite game Boblox
this serie never gets old
Hey Steven tell your dad alot of men play with their WIWI it's very popular actually

RIP Off-Brand Salesman. Steven's dad made doubly sure to send him to Jesus.
The sheer disappointment 1:50
I’m fairly new to subscribing to your channel and you most definitely don’t disappoint your audience. (Definitely not a failure. Shhhhh don’t tell Stevens dad I said that. Shhhh.)   Edit: I think Steven dad just sent me to Jesus along with son for my stupid.
Every day in school I pick a period where I only talk with the Steven he Asian voice the whole time I take great inspiration from you master
WiWi
In you case of someone confused, UM is 1 in Portuguese.

The tuna got me laughing hard
This video is full of EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!
Best part is:Boblox who the hell is Bob (clap)
Beautiful, I have now bought both a tuna and a sperm shirt.  High fashion.  Think Phelous reviewed the 'Ball' toys, he did 'Motorcycle the Pooh' too, a craptastic epileptic experience. XD
Do you have any, "I will send you to Jesus" shirts?
Nah cmon we gotta see a luobu (Chinese roblox) reaction now lol

“You have Steven “failure” he?” “We have Stephan “loser” them!”       “I will send you to Jesus “We nghave that be, but we do have “I will make you meet Buddha””   “You have emotional damage?” “We got hurt feelings”

1:38 dude i wheezed so hard on this part
Even Steven He has an off-brand version of himself out there. Adamsheey. Dude's just ripping off Steven's jokes and doing the exact same gags and accents.
I used to work for a small import business, you wouldn't believe the sheer amount of knock-offs I've been exposed to. It's enough to give an intellectual properties lawyer a heart attack twelve times over.  In my experience, superhero and Disney franchises are targeted the most.
"Do you have My Hero Acadamia" "We got My Bad Guy Exams-" No because I can't 💀💀
Yooooooooooooooooo You hit 6M on this glorious day am commenting on! congratsssssssssssssssssssss
Steve she
Yaaaaaaaaaaa 6m subs goood joooob Steven

Where do you find THESE brands, I need one of those
With Nord VPN ,  now you can allow a third party organization to catalogue your online activity , freeing up normal dedicated public servers and data farms  Through privatized drag net gateways. Lol. Love the videos man, funny as heck. But I will never sign up to a Virtual Private Network... It's a privatized dragnet and no more secure than the suboena it would take to get public records over "private" ones.
its too funny for my
happy 6 million subs day sir ji
Tuna!
Sound?
I laughted so hard, my soul got send to Jesus instead. 😂
hmm no shirt with the phrase "Emotional Damage"?
lol
Vegeta:yes i will be immortal right after i get a wish from a BALL
"IS THAT SHERIFF WOODY OR STEROIDS WOODY?"
Someone should tell Steven's Dad that offbrand stuff helps make lots of cash.  He'd be interested.
I just binged this series and I’ve never had more joy 😭
Amazing! This is insanely relatable if you have gone to some shadier places to buy stuff!
Here in the first 5 days.
1437960th
Is that sheriff woody or  steroid woody?
Man Steven you have come a long way as I remember you having 100k
I love how Steven's dad just looked at the shopkeeper and calmly takes off his slipper so that he would YEETED in the face of the shopkeeper-
"Star wars IV: Return of the Gym" Got me
I will send you to Jesus.

"Wow I can't wait get a wish granted by my baaaaaaaallllll"

Wow toy story
Lets gets some of your balls

Wiwi haha
Nice
Who want to play wit a WIWI?!?
You're videos are so funny
This is gold. When I first saw this and he mentioned the Nintendo part about the wii. And he said wiwi, I swear I had every good intention to see the console as just a mock up of the wii and it just flew over my head when he said “oh I have one myself” I thought well he’s a gamer. It’s not until I watched it again just for the laugh that I realized that he meant it as a dirty joke…  I was like, oh man… I swear my intention was to think innocently and just think of it as a mock up. 😅😂. I laughed even harder because of it. 🤣🤣🤣
My cheeks hurts 😆😆😆😆
XD
1:55
"WIWI, who wants to play with a WIWI?!  That got me rolling on the floor 🤣
Im afraid you cant send him to Jesus cuz jest off brand too
"we got sometimes strong" got me good
"you must have Minecraft" "Oh yeah, you mean breakmake?
Steven is goated
My son is a FAILURE
I wasnt even drinking anything and I still spat out spit. Dude i needed this good laugh.
Every time he says " I will send you to Jesus " is the best part of the video 😂
Eventually everything will go so off brand that even the usual skits will become off brand.
When you want to buy something in Russia:
Wi-wi actually means pee in tagalog/filipino
He got me rolling on the floor, when he mentioned divorce Karen 😄
WiWi murdered me 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Steven He is sponsored by NordVPN and Uncle Roger is sponsored by ExpressVPN. Rivals in the making?
🤣🤣🤣
Your videos make great out of context stuff to show to my friends
This made me laugh so much 🤣. Hey, can you make one with streaming services. Thank you.
Emotional davage
finally he send to Jesús.
"who the hell is Bob" is the best line!
when your parents buy you the off brand console for Christmas but you don’t have the willpower to tell them:
“WIWI? WHO WANTS TO PLAY THE  WIWI?” Me:Hold up, wait a minute, something ain’t right
Love this.
"I'm going to send you to Jesus."   😄😄😂😂
This toy says "*BALL*"💀
"I will send you to Jesus!" 🤣
3:15 giggity
Who else raise their hand after he said, "Who wants to play with a WiWi?" LOL
Sperm
I loved playing on my WiWi as a kid
Imagine Steven he trying to convince his parents that YouTube is a career....
My indian dad look at the off brand an Brad price and sees which ones cheaper we usually leave the store with a UM
"WIWI??! WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A WIWI?!"  "I CANT WAIT TO GET A WISH GRANTED BY MY BAAAAAAAAALL" * sperm * its all starting to add up
B A L L 0:48

Who want to play with a WIWI!?  I actually have one of those myself... Had me dead
I’m just dying of laughter every time I watch it
After many videos and threats....he finally did it...He sent him to Jesus! (Great way to end it,lol)
Imagine if it actually happen
Love hearing your accent Steven, reminds me of my old boss...miss the old farts.
He planned out of anger I love it
Moves like disappointment and f- in math asian parents moves the slipper and I will send you to jesus
Wow Asian dads actually buying games for his kids last time i asked my dad for a bicycle he teached me 15 years economy experience in 14 hours. I told him it's impossible,he told me that what your asian uncle said when i invented Algebra.
I got a good video idea a Pokemon battle but its Steven as the failure and his dad as the asian parent
🤣🤣🤣 Imagine using Sperm stamp
🤣🤣🤣
The one fault: Asians don't buy name brands for their kids
spirit cyclelist actually sounds sick
I always love these Chinese knock off products.  Still not sure if they're actually trying to _fool_ anyone, or just make us laugh.
I will send u to Jesus...😀😀
I'd buy Uno if it's name is Umu.  Only men of culture knows.
3 speed man the hell
Wow i can't wait to get a wish granted by my BaLL    Everything about this is perfectly funny

Hilarious. Squatting is great for circulation vs sitting but, can be embarrassing when your asscrack comes out. They should make an invention for that. Then an off brand version.

The Dragon Ball and Star Wars part got me pretty good, "Wow, I can't wait to get a wish granted by my BALL!" 🤣
"Steroid Woody" had me die laughing 🤣🤣🤣
Steven were can I get *"ball"* XD
The way Ludwig handle this is just inspiring. Actually made me reflect on myself and how poorly I've reacted and handled my own problems sometimes.
At least steven's dad shows some positivity by buying presents to kids
The funnest part was wiwi
Emotional damage
There is naruto at the background though.
I was laughing so much.
Omg... Hilarious🤣🤣
Off brand is so on brand! 😂
“Boblox? Who the hell is Bob?” THAT GOT ME DUBUWBEIHBWIHB
Shady sales guy: *sent to Jesus*
Je je
Imagine this: Steven's dad walks in and asks, "Do you have Steven He?" And the shopkeeper answers, "Yeah, we have Stephanie She"  Even better: The shopkeeper answers, "Yeah, we have Failure"
Star wart should be renamed “light battles” 😂😂😂
Asian father: I'ma send you to jesus!!!! Me: /waiting for off brand jesus

I kinda want that tuna shirt
The “sperm” did it for me 💀
The silence as he's getting the slipper was perfect. I couldn't stop laughing for like 2 minutes straight.

I remember going into a store in Brooklyn to shop for a bookbag and they were selling “The South Place” 💀
i play with the wiwi👉👈😳
Sometimes when I laugh I cough and when I saw this, I sounded like a car breaking down
"Hey what's Um?" "What do you mean?" "I mean this game named um" "Um what? "ITS NAMED UM!" "WHAT IS UM?" "AHHHHHHHHHHH"
Okay all jokes aside, I'd actually pay money for that "Sperm" shirt

Gotta love playing with your wiwi whilst wearing sperm
1:37 killed me out right.
"Want to play with my new WiWi"
😂💗😂💗😂
Hey Steven! Can u make a "When Asians go to a Haunted House" Video?🤣
Oh goodness I love his accent especially “wut ta hayllll” gets me every single time
Better than “boblox” for Roblox would have been “roadblocks.” I’ve seen someone make that mistake
Who wants to play with a wiwi!?!   I have one actually that is perfection
How is this man not at 10M subs
Hey bro got the wiwi
"I will send you to heaven" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What game are you playing? Um. You don't know what you're playing? Yeah, It's Um! It's okay if you forgot- IT'S UM! I'M PLAYING UM! YOU IDIOT IT'S CALLED UM! It's from Umbridge.

Advice when you make the ads blend it in the video with your sad actor humor  A.k.a don't break the illusion
This is every conversation I have ever had with my mom as a child
I have one of those actually.

"WIWI WHO WANT TO PLAY WITH A WIWI"got me dead😂
SPERM?? HUH??
"I will send you to jaysus"
My favourite part of the video is when your neighbour checks in to see if you’re OK
Nord vpn is the worse, its owned by the feds. Stay away from it.
I will send you to Jesus! 🤣
" BALL I CANT WAIT TO GET MY WISH GRANTED BY MY BALL" was too funny
Not gonna lie I'd buy that steroid woody in a heartbeat and I don't even like toy story 😂
You should do when everything is off brand at a music store
Do you have emotional damage?.... We have feelings destroyer
僕のヒーローアカデミア… 😃
Oh crap you live in an apt now. Dang your neighbors on the regular basis now are gonna be saying, "what the hey-ull!"
bruh one time i went to a store and I saw woody with misplaced limbs inside a star wars box
"You got my hero academia" "We have my bad guy exams" You really did them dirty
Stevens neighbor was probably like "ah shit here we go again" when they heard Steven shouting tuna 🤣
"WiWi?? WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH WI-WI?!?!?!" 😂😂😂
I too have and love playing with my wiwi
The series is so good keep going❤
"You have Mary Jane ?"    WE HAVE DEVORCED KAREN🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀🤣🤣
Emotional damage Guy I love him❤❤❤❤❤
Am I the only one who doesn't like the voice? Not the typical "ooh soo offensive" virtue signaler, I just find it annoying because Steven can be funny without the gimmick
Bro you are good
𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠🤸

Hi mif
My man send that guy to Bezoz
Steven he I have an idea for ur next video: change a nickname for ur future son. Like yk you could watch those doctor movies and get inspiration of names but ur son would say he wanted to be Leo decapio(idk if there’s wrong spelling). Anyways I think that could be a good content and sorry for my bad grammar cuz I’m just a pure Asian :/
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Instead of Amazon Prime we have Sahara Composite
Imagime what Steven's neighbours hear everyday

My wife plays with my WiWi every day. So I never get to play my own games... 😥
Change the color grading why so much whites?
“I will send you to Jesus!” Best line ever
Star Wars Galaxy battle
In Chinese culture, lying, cheating and stealing are socially accepted as long as you get money by doing so. And if someone is wondering if i am lying, no it is actually true.  Different cultures have different values.
Wīwī😂😂😂😂
That store clerk desevered getting sent to Jesus after showing off the new "Supreme" t-shirt.

Someone’s copying your videos -> https://youtube.com/shorts/8dKRazi7Hp4?feature=share
I have been following this channel for at least 2 years now and watching it grow over time. Especially before the ''Emotional damage'' became a popular meme. I am glad to see this channel given the attention it deserves. Quality comedic content. Keep it up!
Never watch these in bed if your honey is sleeping!
Aw, YouTube deleted my comment :( I guess it thought my impersonation of Stephen's dad was too angry.
My bad guy exams 🤣
These are getting more dumber and I love it! 😆
He missed viagra woody damn
The tuna brand had me dying 😭
The Wiwi Makes Me Laugh
Steven's Dad: You got Ghost Rider? Shopkeeper: We got Spirit Cyclist.  SD: ..... SK: ... Steven: .. The whole universe: .. Me: 🤣🤣🤣
Snow White: a Deadly Summer is being attacked in a personal level with these of brand movie references.

I will send you to Jesus 😂 best dialogue
Emotional damage!
Stevens's physical comedy is the best
This video has planking…😅lol 😂
NGL Steven did his best skits when he didnt have all the new equipment, it just doesn't hit the same anymore.
my son called it star warts when it first came out..what a hoot.
This is inaccurate they would never buy their children such goodies.
poor neighbor wondering what you are on.
“Sometimes strong” perfectly sums up allmight though (until after season 3)
WiWi who want to play with a WiWi
3 Speedman sent me to Jesus.
Made in China
This was accurate to my childhood in the middle east, you could get anything, as long as it was pirated or a knock off.  I used to own 90% of the ps1 and saturn library, "own"....
half this video is a sponsorship you might as well have had the whole video be a sponsorship
A wiwi
Steven he to Stephany she
1:52 it doesn’t say “Sheep” :(
I am not asian nor have asian friends-but I LOVE YOU!!
This is so funny for some reason 😂
I actually hoped the VPN is off brand too
The jokes in this series keep getting funnier. Especially the “Wiwi” and *BALL.* Lost it. XDD
I'd absolutely wear that Tuna shirt.
Him laughing in the bloopers made me laugh so hard!! 😆
I have one of those 'Supreme' shirts.  I overpaid for it too.
I don't know so much english but..... After this video I have graduated In English.. Tuna 🐟
If you keep this up, my death certificate cause of death will say: Laughed himself to death. I mean, WEE WEE and BALLS is too much humor to take 🤣🤣
"WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH WEEWEE?!" 😂
He finally sent someone to Jesus…

I'd buy the sperm shirt. Just because it's funny.
Sorry Steven and sponsor. I only subscribe to Fjord RPM 😂
imma need that Beijing Corn pillow
I would rock the help out of the sperm shirt
This is hands down my favourite video on all of YouTube. I had to watch 2 times cause I couldn’t hear anything from laughing so much the first time
Steven He in 2050: When Everything is off brand 69 Steven’s Dad: Can i buy a ”Undo” Book? Shopkeeper: You mean the “Unfailure” Book?  Steven’s Dad: *silence*                            “I’ll take 10”
Dad didn't see the Naruto backpack in the back😭
WiWi?! WhO waNts To pLaY wiTh A WiWi?!”  -Steven He 2022
“WiWi?! WhO waNts To pLaY wiTh WiWi?!”  -Steven He 2022
0:32 is just WIWI
It is almost midnight and I was trying to hold and laugh the entire time I love the plank on the chair and I love your videos so much
Bruh 3speedman
The brands are so ripped off that it's enough to even make Stevens dad plank anywhere in the store
Your almost 6 mil! Congrats!
THIS IS THE BEST ONE YET!!!!!!!!!
So funny man would like to see you in a convention in Ireland there’s two coming up next year in January and March
“ is that sheriff woody or streroids woody” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If I ran into Steven's dad in real life I would want him to insult me, it would be an honor
xD
I like how the shopkeeper jumps every time Steven comes like he knows one of these days Steven is going to send him to Jesus and he finally does!
Dominican República
Woody on steriods got me😂 keep it up!
Okay, I have to say I couldn't stop laughing. The pain of these off brands runs deep, especially when you run across them accidently, or when there are so many of them that you can't find the originals. Oh is "3 speed man" supposed to be "spiderman" or "flash"?
To be fair, Sometimes Strong is a much more accurate name than All Might
my man went ya *y e e t*
The Who want to play with a wi wi had me wheezing
That "sperm" got me rolling round the house 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dude! He finally made it! He finally has sent him to Jesus!
Smooth transition to today’s sponsor!
Oh no... he just sent him to Jesus...
The SPERM got me so hard   #NoHoMo
I love watching Steven He.  Oh, you mean Stephan She.  😡🥿
All those knockoffs! I bet he has the north faith and ikes in there
Not only did I get a laugh I got schooled on how to view stuff in my own country that apparently is blocked from view. 🙊🙉🙈😂
His videos never fails to make me laugh
"i got one myself" 😂😂yeah absolutely😂😂
Ah yes, the wiwi, my favorite game console
I have a WiWi and enjoy playing with my WiWi. 😂
“Who wants to play with a WiWi” Jesus Christ man.. that sounds so wrong
https://youtu.be/m-eNkk_SvJ8  This isn’t a Rick roll I swear on the sandal that sends people to jesus
I will send you to Jesus🩴
The WiWi part was so sus 😂    wow I found this channel before 100k subscribers and now it has almost 6 million !?!?!??
I kept it together until he said, "I will send you to Jesus!"
NO BOBLOX
Hench Woody is my personal favorite
Star wars: return of the chimp 😂😂
What?!? No..."Emotional Damage!!" ;)
It’s time to get right with Jesus! You aren’t going to automatically enter heaven if you’ve lied or stolen or had sex before marriage, don’t be deceived! The punishment of sin is Hell fire and we are all guilty of sin. We are guilty before God and need forgiveness. Call upon the name of Jesus and follow him. Pray and ask him to help you repent of your sins! He died so you could have everlasting life with your sins dealt with justly. He bore the punishment. You must know him today! You may not have another day.
Is this Star Wars 5 '' Return of the gym ''  🤣
Bro Steven's vids are so funny and when he said wi wi I DIED
"who wants to play with  wiwi?" I got the wrong idea 💀

Steve he: WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH WIWI Me: i do (I swear I’m not gay)
“Do you have Nord VPN?”   “We have express vpn”
YES OFFBRAND
I like how he just magic the show into existence I saw his shoes that was not the one he was wearing the Asian power to magically summon I shoe to beat your kids with
3 sPeEd mAn ???
WiWi? No!
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE 😂😂
SPEED-MAN
The one that killed me was "w i w i" like if someone's mom got that because of a sleepover then their kid would say " hey Timmy Johnny! Do you want to play with my w i w i at home?" They going to laugh at the little boy!
Offbrand Steven He is Stephen Huh. He is mildly confusing.
Tuna and sperm genius hilarious 😅😂
B A L L
Oh my god "Spirit Cyclist" I am freaking dead😂😂😂
This dude has so much damn energy. I hope some comedy show picks him up
You sell the cup for 20 dollars you failure
0:48 “BALL!? Wow I can’t wait to get a wish granted by my BALL!!!” this part truly hitted me giggles hard
Dam I've been calling roblox boblox for over 3 years now
1:53 is the point where I laughed so hard, I'm pretty sure I lost my soul. Which then unturned laughed so hard my soul lost its own soul. I don't know how that works, but that's the power of comedy sending you to Jesus!  EDIT: I hope your neighbors are laughing in confusion from hearing the insanity of you making videos.
The sperm one might be good as a gag gift.
Lol
Man had to come in and double lock the door 😆
When you go on wish
WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A WIWI got me dying lol
1:09 "The one with All-Might?" "Yeah, with the Sometimes-Strong?  That's... actually not too far off.
I swear these offbrand jokes/puns never miss lol
Steven's dad and Uncle Roger need to collab again!!!
the sp*rm part made me laugh like heck!
To forgive shopkeepers is God's business, but to send them to him is my business.  -Steven's dad, probably.

In my day we had sugreen not supreme
he finally did it  he sent the shoplift to jesus
I will send you to Jesus 🤣🤣
Who the hell is Bob 🤣🤣🤣
I don't know, I signed up for Jord VPN and all I get is spam now.
1:29 could've been better, show show him kicking his foot up and catching the shoe... And the way you said it sounds like someone who auditioned to play you and did terrible.
Mary Jane : Divorce Karen Never knew that Karen is the opposite of Jane 😂😂😂
Why were they pointing different directions at 0:26

Who else has been watching so much Steven He that the accent has started to catch on?
1:49 I mean you do recognize that don't you?? 💀
When you 80 yo Father catches you laughing hysterically watching Steven He, then as he walks away you hear him tell your Mom that he'd like new slippers for Christmas = Emotional Damage 😳
You should build like a fake cardboard shopkeeper set and do it like you are selling product. lol
😂😂 Love this guy
This is the best one yet
0:27 had me dying laughing so hard😂
WIW BALL
out of all the off brand things WE NEED "My Badguy Exams" as a series

I would normally run when he proceeds to break out the shoe, but it breaks the laws of physics.
666k views😂
3 speed man got me dead 😂💀
The way he says Wiwi is too funny
Next off-brand video should be about music. "You got Justin Bieber?" "We got *Just a Beaver* "
Got to be one of the funniest vids ive watched so far
At some point, there should be a “ when the Karen walks into an off rand store” like Karen complaining and stevens dad is the manager
steroid woody got me
Hysterical
I am learning new brands watching Steven He
I was not expecting mha to be here, I laughed my head off
"You got Mary Jane? We got Divorced Karen." God this is a great joke.
Hello Steve I also live in china but I moved into macau:(  大家好我是張進泓
Well, I think this is the end of the ‘When everything is offbrand’ series, after that slipper throw. He ain’t coming back from that.
Nice
"Wow I can't wait to get a wish granted by my BAAAAALL"
Funny thing was, me & my friends went to this flea market back in 2010, and we're just wondering around, and stumbled across this Wii looking console, then when we saw the "Wi Wi" logo, we just laughed our asses off 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I would legit buy a Tuna shirt.
steven:U got puma yeah of course :Here it is!! (TUNA) steven: holding his slipper
Lost it at the end😂😂😂I want that shirt now
HE FINALLY SENT HIM TO JESUS
IS THAT SHERIF WOODY OR STEROIDS WOODY
1:17 Legit almost murdered me. I was having some water and I had to force it to not burst through my eyes when I heard "Return of the Gym"
My ex was addicted to playing with Wi-Wi', just not mine
Great idea. Now time to make a giga Chad version of Sheriff Woody
Omg this dude is the GEEK 😂
“WiWi and Ball and boblox
Thank you for this masterpiece
love how there's just no dialogue after "sperm" :D
star wart... so close.
I would actually wear that Tuna shirt.
1:56 he finally send him to Jesus

These are very relatable
Lmao nice
TUNA! Is it just me or is that kinda fishy?
I take a WiWi
This is… Yes!
Ahh yes divorce karen
Wiwi literally means piss or pee. So in the video’s context, when you play with it then it becomes an FPS game too.
Who plays with a wi wi That had me dying
This is painful, this is annoying, this is killing me, I don't like him, I don't like them, I don't like them!!  I don't want to Stay here I don't want to see them I don't want that I'm not one of them I'm not happy They say that I'm just a game That's nOt true It's all not true This is not true Please kill me Please don't let me die PleaSe They are everywhere
1:14 He’s not woody, He’s Loggy
WiWi is a normal nintendodog
I love My Badguy exams I m gonna go watch my bad guy exams I love the main character brocolli boi
" Return of the gym"
" I will send you to Jesus" is one of my favorite lines and cracks me up every time.
I assume WIWI was made by the French?
‘I will send you to Jesus’& ‘Emotional Damage’ are official lingo in my office of almost 75 people lol you’re pretty much our happiness sponsor… One dude was a can of Beijing Corn at our Halloween party 😂
It's made in China and that's why it off branded.
LMFAO "Wow i cant wait to get a wish granted by my BALL"
🤣🤣🤣
WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A WIWI
Wiwi.....heh
Divorced Karen🤣🤣🤣
ive been bamboozled i didn't know he spoke English Without the accent...
“ you got mixles?” “ um, here is fusers ok?”
0:31 Wait What? Is that a Chinese thing or a vulgar word? 🤔
He got sent to Jesus
“WiWi, who wants to play with the WiWi!” That got me hard
Um :) wiwi
LMAO
By god he actually sent him to Jesus!
Ngl i would wear that tuna shirt
As soon as he started talking about Supreme, I just knew it was going where it went. 😂 Crappy off-brands are hilarious
Here
“Wiwi wo da heil is wiwi!” -Steven he
This is officially my favourite series 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Sperm

Steven: Double locking the door. Steven's neighbour: Also double locking their door.
I love the part where Steven was laying down face first on the chair
1:38 to be honest, I would wear a Tuna™ shirt
Dragon balls should be serpent spheres
Spirit cyclist got me lol
I liked the Bentendo OwEe better
There is a Naruto bag in the background
He was sent to gesus
Star wars 5 return to the gym was on an other level 🤣
I LIKE THESE VIDEOS THERE SO FUNNY
I enjoy the fact Steven had pictures of the off-brand this time
Beiling corn 🤣
Tuna is it just me or does that sound fishy? LOL 😅😂😂
The most unrealistic part about this video is that Steven's father is trying to buy a game for Steven.  This is not what Asian parents do.
Sometimes strong is a better description of all might then all might 💀
Wiwi! 🤣🤣
Have you ever had to deal with a Karen when filming in public?
yes take the nord vpn money nobody will click on the link. they get completly robbed very nice
Mann the Supreme Brand xD 🤣
Nah man. I'ma good with these off brands. I'm too broke for real ones
Bru

0:30  Wiwi in filipino: 💀
My bad guy exams 🤣🤣🤣 that threw me
Off-Brand Steven's Dad: What the Sleet??  I will send you to Zeezus!  Off-Brand Steven She:  I MOtional BLOckage!
Steroids Woody and 3 Speed Man?! What the Hail?! Ok you know what? I am not paid enough for dealing with this.
I love these so much lol
almost 6M ehe. I remember when there were only a few 10k
Divorced Karen lol
he has been sent to jesus
One of these days you should put a real brand and refer to it as off brand
That made me laugh so hard🤣
The who wants to play with wi-wi part is hilarious
0:46 Beerus looks hilarious
These are Chinese games
The part when you said "BOBLOX" hit me because I believe was early 2021 when on ROBLOX people would call the game "BOBLOX" for some reason along with calling robux "bobux"
He got sent to Jesus.
i will send you to jesus
Return of the gym 🤣🤣🤣
"mall has left the chat"
“Sperm” 💀
Emotional damage
In our country wiwi means pee Hahahaha
That last made me LOL. God that was funny

By my ball
WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A WIWI?
"My Bad Guy exams" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I Love 'I will send you to JESUS!"
My bad guy exams xD
NordVPN/FordVPN
Wiwi 🤣
It would of been pure gold if your neighbor walks into your video saying "wait, you have 3 Speed Man?!" 😆 🤣 😆 💀 ⚰️
He finally sent him to Jesus
"sperm" 🤣🤣🤣
he finally sent him to jesus
Something I recogni… “Sperm” I mean you are not wrong tho
"3 speed man?! i will send you to jesus" that got me
TUNA shirt😂😂👉https://tinyurl.com/ymbjew5s
1:53 LMAO 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
hi
"Tuna?! Is it me or is that kind of fishy?" I'm dead
THIS IS AMAZING Keep up the great work
I feel like the only reason Steven's dad goes to these stores is because that they are offbrand they are cheaper, but he doesn't know they are off-hand, just on sale. That's why the shopkeeper is so surprised to see him, cause everyone knows they are cheap because they are offbrand
I will send you to Hesus
[SPERM] Steven's dad: "Your channel getting demonetised this time for sure..."
To u Steven he: emotional damage
STAR WARS 5 RETURN OF THE GYM got me dying💀💀
“Star Wart” sent me over the edge! Thanks for entertaining me during my never-ending insomnia.
Wtf is wiwi
Enjoying this while taking a cool sip of Emotional Damage 🥤🥤
Best videos thank u for such amazing content
Bro what was that laugh at 3:15???
Mom i made varsity
I legit thought that slipper was a really weirdly-cut slice of pie. Even when watching the video, it was only the, "I will send you to Jee-sus!" context that tipped me off the first time.  I can't be the only one who sees this, surely?
My favorite part is that "Sometimes Strong" is actually quite accurate at least for the first few seasons X'D
"I will send you to Jesus"                            ~Steven he [All Time]
Yay more when everything is offbrand my favorite episode
the best off-brand superhero is and will always be, hentai kamen
lets play um
No your not on YouTube your on MeTube!
Honestly Steven's dad should give the wiwi a try, they're quite fun if you have at least 2 players
Off Brand RPGs
Opposite of batman joker.. totally Asian❤️😂😂
1:48 🏆
Maybe it would be funny to do your references in an offbrand way too
Wiwi means pee in tagalog 💀💀💀
3 speed man
He ACTUALLY send him to jesus  this time
SPERM !!! KILLED ME THE MOST 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It is so wild seeing Steven He go from under 1 million subs to almost 6 million in what feels like only several months! I remember when he used to make jokes about his pathetic failure of a youtube channel!
is there a off brand Steven dad?
When Steven He is off brand: Steven She
i love the "boblox" part, it killed me 😂
''who the hell is bob?''
You got Gold Experience? We've got Golden Wind. You got Moody Blues? We've got Moody Jazz. You got Purple Haze? We've got Purple Smoke.
This getting kinda sus wiwi ball and supreme
To much ad
Lolol
All the fake stuff cracked me up😂🤣
Steven He when he speaks english using asian accent: has weird accent Steven He when he speaks American English: straight witty english
Steroids woody uwu hahahahhaha
Missed opportunity couldve been GOBLOX (dumb in indonesian) Instead of boblox
Wonder if I try playing these games FR especially the WiWi
"TuNA?!?! Is it me or is that kind of fishy?!"
The brand names never get old . How do u get all those names XD
BTW love your vidio ideas keep up the work
"WiWi?! Who wants to play with the WiWi?" "I have one of those myself actually." Out of context is so much better here lmao
Bro the ball was 🔥
Dude, this gets me so hyped
2:00 The shopkeeper got sent to Jesus.
"Who want to play with the WiWi?!?!?"   *all of france joins the chat*
Bro Woody be lookin' like gigachad
Is it me or is that kinda fishy?
nah I can't 😂 that entrance at 1:31
Sperm 🤣
I discovered your channel in 2020 when everything was miserable for me and your channel created my day , can't even realize how much this channel has evolved , keep it up.
OMG! That jacket! I feel like I’m standing in the middle of a colorful preschool, but watching this, and trying not to laugh my ass off. 💜😂😂🤣🤣
You’ll be surprised of the rabbit hole of bootlegs and off brands  It’s just blursed
i love ur videos man
How this guy could find these branded-ness stuff
I think your "Everything is Off Brand' videos are my favorites, even more than the Professional Asian Dad. They destroy me every time.
There's never a Steven He video without the "I will send you to JEEEzus!"
Why want's to play with a Wiwi, (VINEBOOM)
The "Supreme" T-Shirt got me
Why is this funnier than usual, This absolutely killed me! 🤣🤣🤣
I was expecting Uno's Rip-Off to be Dos or another language 😁
Jessus: what are you doing here? Guy: I was trying to sell off brand stuff to his Angry Asian Dad’ and he hit me with a shoe. Jessus: again?!! that’s the fifth time this week!!
Bro the first vid i saw was the ranking TikTok video…. Bro you are the next KSI 😮
I kind of want a Tuna shirt
:)
拼多多给了你多少钱😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
From Supreme to Sperm 🤨

AINT NO WAY HE JUST SAID, "WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A WEEWEE?"
When you are searching aliexpress
The way he was sitting on the chair had me dead 😂
"I will send you to jesus" gets me everytime
Finally he sent someone to Jesus
You got android? We got apple.
Anyone else get flashbanged by the high bloom in the video
Roblox, robux Boblox, bobux
His accent makes it even more funnier
yayy he did another When Everything Is Off Brand video i was waiting for one Edit: i forgot this was created 3 days ago
daaaaaam half the vid is a dam ad xD
Steven He, keep sending more people to Jesus.
Boi that Naruto Bag on the background is super cool !
The greatest, like absolutely GREATEST part of these vids is when you're laughing at yourself and mistakes! I love you and your videos, Steven, keep going man! Nailing it every time!

Random fun fact:        (Keep scrolling)            (A little more please?)        I AM ASIAN
Supreme... ... I'm dead :p
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is it racist that I thought he was holding a giant plush fortune cookie in the thumbnail?
When the Supreme shirt was shown you should have said "actually, it makes sense"
Don’t you just want a sperm tshirt now? All the cool kids are wearing them these days
He got sent to Jesus
I think Steven should be the next James Bond…..
Oh my diaphram!
YES! love this series the soundtrack kills me lol, the beat has that shit just got real vibe going for it
I love this series
I was reminded of pewds neighbour concerns watching that part 😆😆😆
0:49 wow I can’t wait to get a wish granted by my ball😂
Hmmm... Which Asian dad goes to toy store willingly to BUY A CONSOLE!!!! FOR HIS CHILDREN?!!!!! OR ANY TOYS!!!
“I will send you to Jesus” sent me bro 💀
The opposite of dragon ball would be draco square
1:30 I will Send You To Jesus Is always legendary 😂
3:37 How do you not get noise complaints called on you lol, did you soundproof your entire apartment? must have cost a fortune

Okay this was a good one
this guy is so classic . love him
0:21 Who the Hell is bOb!? 😂
1:01 the way he becomes a plank is just hilarious 😂
"You Got My Hero Academia" "We Got My bad Guy Exams" Probably the best one 😂
Finally made good on his threat. He sent him to Jesus.
I keep expecting Canadian stuff, like Nanaimo Bars, Tim Hortons and Poutine
SPERM! 😂WHEEZE!😂
Star Wart ☠️
Make more offbrands
Wiwi 😂😂😂😂😂
WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH THE WIWI?!?!?!?!
Dragon Ball , Ball when it's out of brand lol 😂

feeling kinda blue today so needed this good laugh! OMG the ending 😆
I wish a girl would play with my WiWi.
Do have legos?
Send you to Jesus, it's like speaking to my grandmother on my birthday....why no children,  why no Jesus....you burn in hell
this is my favorite series of yours
Sperm. Did you pronounce that right on purpose?
Steven's Dad's outfit (orange shirt and grey blazer with random pants) is so classic at this point
Can't wait to max out my moms credit card on bobux
B Ä Ł L
Well, that really was quick draw speed on the slipper. 🤣
my bad guy exams tho might be better than the real anime
bro that last one caught me off guard man. Holy crap that was 10/10
nooo....NNOOO...THAT SHIRT CAN'T BE REAL XD
This is so freaking funny, the best laugh I've had in a week
I'm surprised Steven's Asian Dad wanted to buy a Nintendo for a party. Did Steven come first in his exam by any chance?
Y'all forgot adidas' off-brand, Alqaeda 💀
You guys got Aston Martin? Uh yeah,I think so ... AILING MARKET?!
Finally, something I recognize... 🤣🤣🤣
Dad Ha had enough and just yeeted the slipper without warning whatsoever and currently said projectile just broke space-time; pierced through the shop keeper and heading towards my hea-
This is the funniest video ever seen🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
WIWI WISH GRANTED BALLS
😮😮😮 You're in the top trending Steven!! #17!!! Holy crap! I never thought I would see you see you trending! Amazing!  Congratulations Steven!!
i would buy that shirt
Did you know that if you say Boblox mean dumb in Philippines, *trashtalk*
"boblox" is a somewhat rare colloquialism in filipino which means "stupid"  it comes from the root word "bobo" which also means"stupid"  another variation is the term "bobocop" which is another colloquialism that means the same thing
“My Bad Guy Exams” lol!!!
“What the hail, is that sheriff woody or steroid’s woody?” -Steven He
Therapist: Buff Woody isn't real. It can't hurt you. Buff Woody: 1:14
I love that they used Portuguese instead of Spanish for "UNO"
This is alright, but not as good as the Stephen Him channel.
“WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A WIWI?!”        ✋ um… I… I do…
I would pay money for a TUNA name brand shirt
cow boy with steroids 😂🤣
Offbrands are capitalism for FAIL-LURES, we have economy of Crackhead brokeman! We will send them to Jeeezus!
This is the best one of the off brand series 😂😂btw I can’t stop laughing lmao💔🤣🤣
God is good
i found meaning in life

Finally after all this time Steven’s dad made good on his threats and sent the shopkeeper to Jesus.
"The one with All-Might?" "We have Sometimes Strong." 😂 Surprisingly accurate tho
"I will send you to jesuss"

Yo, I'd wear that Tuna shirt. No lie.

3 speed man, my favorite racer.
That is the most cursed Woody I have ever seen.
Are your videos just you? Because I honestly thought it was actually you and your dad
The most consistent and funny Youtuber 😂
He sent him to jezz sus
Ah yes...I also have one of those.
I think from uno , uyes is the correct off brand name I guess.
It’s not even “I will send you to Jesus” we must make a “I will send you to satan”
Seriously LOLed at this! 😂
I bet he didn't even managed to send him to Jesus he sent him to Heysoos
3 Speed Man might be my favorites of all.
What is the percentage of people who watch this and aren't Asian?
I died at Ball and 3 Speed Man.
My family use the word Wiwi same meaning as peeing
That shoe was sending Steven, and the wall behind him, straight to Jesus.
Why is the color so saturated and blinding
Plsssss do NES-SLOW instead of nesquick!!!
The only genuine product in the room is Beijing Corn.
love your skits can't wait for the next one XD
TUUUNA!
😂💀
Promise me this series won't ever end
So no one’s gonna talk about that shirt?
This man will never stop with good content
I wonder what a good off-brand name for NordVPN would be. Or Rick & Morty.
"We got Rick Mad" 😹😹😹
Soupsperm
The store employee jumping never gets old 🤣🤣🤣👌
Woody on steroids got me so laughing also ball and WIWI
He did recognize it “sperm”
“Who wants to play with the WiWi” got my laughing 🤣🤣🤣
Dang, dude. I clicked to watch because the video was almost 4 minutes long... And almost two minutes for an ad?? Gross.
Steven never disappoints, keep up the good work or I will send you to Jesus 🩴
Id watch my bad guy exams it sounds like a comedy about either a teacher that has to trick hero kids into becoming villains or a hero in a villain school and trying not to get caught. eather why shenanigans ensue.
I can see how fast-growing your acting skills are. Fantastic....FAILURE
lagging irl... would be a banger video
Offbrand Stuff are back, they are funny, *EVERYTIME!*
I play with my WiWi like 3-4 times a day.
Not "Spirit cyclist"🤣🤣🤣🤣
Me: (sees the shirt at 1:50)  Also me: (Also does 1:53)
Who wants to play with Wiwi?!  Ummm........
Ngl buff woody is kinda👀
Rerez watchers when they see the WiWi  Hang on a minute, Hamy made another Wii Knockoff
Steven 1: Do you have Nord VPN? Steven 2: Oh yea we have South NPV
Imfao, He Finally Uploaded Again.
He sent him to Jesus
I love the sperm. Supreme has to be the dumbest brand ever. Whenever I see someone wearing that merch, I make a point to avoid them at all costs.
TOO FUNNY 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
0:34 what 😃
I lost it at 3 Speed Man. The delivery was Supreme. I mean [Sperm]
Boblox 💀
the one thing that i noticed was him mentioning mha  love it.
I dressed as Steven for Halloween and I kept hearing "Oh my god it's Steven He" whenever I walked down my hallway, considering I somewhat don't look like him (ps I threw a slipper at someone)
"i WilL sENd YoU tO jeSUs" lol
Friend: “Can you give me your wiwi passwords?”  Me: “….what tf?…..it’s please……”
NorthVPN
Who wants to play with a *shouts* WIWI?! 😭🤣
The only YouTuber whose adds I watch.
I love playing on my wiwi so does my sister and mom
At long last, the off-brand guy has finally been set to Jesus
So my new pair of Tunas aren't cool? lol hee haw 🤣
You can't play with "WiWi" right now or wear "Sperm" due to the conflicting month upon us!😔
You got loud walls
Woody on steroids! What is this return of the gym ? Head me dying
UM
“Were they high?”  Definitely
Mom said it's my turn on the wiwi
"You got Steven He?" "We got Steven She."
I like a YouTuber called steven she. Man he makes a great content.
Who wats to play with a wii wii?!?!? Im dying
I think Supreme is a dumb brand that thrives on stupidity, but even with that I think the shoe throw was justified.
First time I am watching one of your videos and this is so hilarious I just subscribe 🤣.
❤ I will send you to Jeezus! 😂
Excuse me, I just need a bit to prepare my weapon of choice
wow i can't wait to get a wish granted by my "BALL" Im dying of laugher
2:00 he had enough 😂
50% vid 50% ad?? I WILL SEND YOU TO JESUS
5th one and I just noticed he’s using real pictures of real off-brand stuff.  “Um” was probably photoshopped but “WiWi” looked real!
When Boblox came up, it was funny because I am a Roblox player as well, also the Wi Wi.
Balll...... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hooray, you're back.  These are good lessons for everyone because  this is what life will become. 🤣💔👞
I’m like 80% this isn’t the real uncle roger
its funny because roblox is actually just called boblox by the players sometimed
The slip is for “I WILL SEND YPU TO JESUS “
sperm and then he sends you to jesus lol This one was very funny
this made me laugh to death🤣😂
"Spirit cyclist" 😂
Yay!!!
He got so pissed off on the other off brands in the passed and leave, but this time he teach that guy a lesson by using his classic asian throwing attack for saying all of those off brands for the past 4 different variants of off brand series.
*”I will send you to Jesus”* the slipper never gets old as everyone says😂 1:30
Watched one of these and I’m in LOVE with this!  Please make more!  Their amazing!
He finally sent him to Jesus
The shoe throw/toss never gets old! I’m a little disappointed that I didn’t get to see it hit anybody tho
Friend: comes over one day after school  Me: “Hey bro! What’s up!” Friend: “What’s up bro! Have any of the new gaming consoles we could play on?” Me: “Yeah! Wanna play with my WiWi?”
"Cowboy on steroids"😂
Oh you got shoe? We’re actually running a sale. Cut to a shot where they’re selling shue
My friend for some reason calls Roblox, Roadblock
0:03 “pahty gaem”
You described my experience growing up in an immigrant household perfectly 😂😂
There is a Speed Man 3 already? Damn. I missed the first two
I actually played with my WiWi multiple times today, sometimes you can’t go wrong with the classics.
That thumb nail hurt me
i will send you to jesus 1:30
xd
i cant wait to get my wish granted by my BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL
It's like real life, but on opposite day.
wiwi LOL
I watched this so many times. Lose it every time at 3 Speed Man. 🤣😂🤣😂
who da hell is bob
You my fav youtuber la
My favourite knock-off off Nick Fury is Dirk Anger, Director of H.A.T.E.
fkn *lost it* at 1:50
When the shop clerk gets a jumpscare…😂
You can run but somehow that shoe or sandal would find you .
Ah yes, I too love playing Boblox, specifically games like Angry Town and Catastrophe Outlast, so much better than Roblox's Mad City and Disaster Survival.
T
"alright, cheers" I think he lives in my city
I LITERALLY rolled on the floor laughing out loud! Well. Done! 😂😂😂🙂🙃🙂👏👏👏😅
Emotional damage!
These discount 99 cent knockoffs are killing me, because I actually see these when I go out. XD
Bro toy story on steroids be like
"you have Playstation?we have POLYstation!"
I send you to Jesus! Made me lought so hard!
The funniest thing is your normal voice is so normal 😂😭
umo
I love boblox
Captions: "Wee Wee" Shirt: "Sperm"  *DIRTY MINDED ACTIVATED* 😭💀
"do you have nordvpn?" "no, i have nerdvpn"
Cool
I love how he just narrated his own thoughts naturally when the camera roles, “double lock that please!”   probably done it enough where it effects his real life.
This is the corner store in my hood.
"WiWi, who wants to play with a WiWi". That WiWi sounded cute.
off brand items are just from an alternate universe
*_The number of jokes Steven had really took research and effort to make it funny._*  *_NOOO! MY WII, IT'S BECOME TWO WI'S! Also, Chad Woody is gonna be the next meme... Tom Hanks will become A MEME._*
WIWI 🤣
2:03 Steven finally sent someone to Jesus XD
I also have a WiWi, I play with it every chance I get! In my house, in my car, on break at work, and even with the kids! ... Where'd all these SWAT come fro
Steven. I went to an offbrand store just for you. Where do I send the pics
Star Wart....I'm done!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Supreme exclusive :  Sperm
star wart and star wars same thing
I will send you to Jesus - finding Jesus 2
I died at divorced Karen
I can't even get mad at the All Might joke. He did legit just become sometimes strong. Touché sir. Touché.
Ohhh snap
lol 😂 I feel like that every day
Has there been an off brand video games video yet?  "Do you have Silent Hill?"  "We've got Loud Mountain."
Hello
BoardVPN
Flat Steven's Dad isn't real, he can't hurt you.  Flat Steven's Dad: 1:03

Sending them to Jesus because all they have is off brand things. He really sent him to Jesus. That show hit hard lol.
I died at “Sperm” 💀
Anybody from the US who's been to China can confirm this is how it feels going to China.
Hardest I laughed in a long time. You are a gift😂❤
the last will send me to jesus
0:30 mines is small🙄
I came for the planking and was not disappointed. 10/10 quality He content 👏
Finally, you send it to Jesus
1:40 “is it me or is that kinda fiSHee”
You can’t be racist anymore. Why aren’t you cancelled yet?
My Chinese adblock is so strong it skips your sponsor video. Muhahaha
1:54 I guess this means that this is the finale of asian dad's nightmare of r/crappyoffbrands
Jesus could not save that man
Sweet
WiWi is just the French version of the wii
Sperm
I would unironically wear that tuna shirt
I'd absolutely watch 'My Bad Guy Exams'
I lost it when he said WiWi  "Who wants to play with a WiWi" 😂😂
UNO could've been NO U or U YES but overall the vid is still entertaining!
SIR DONT U MEAN UNO
It nighttime and this video still managed to make my day 😂
Broooo first time I started watching this channel it had 400k subs. Look where he @ now. Dats crazy
off brand stuff
I take equal parts comfort and dread in knowing La Chancla is a universal thing.
“You guys got StevenHe?”  “We got VanessaShe”
The slipper throw gets funny
"Sega genesis?" "Prisma exodus." "That actually sounds kinda fun to play" "It has a key board like controler and 3 joy sticks"  "... I'll take 1 of those. Sounds interesting"  "You got sonic the hedgehog hog?" "We got hyper the ostrich" "Do his games suck too?" "No actually their really well made and the story is actually good and it makes sense, but the songs are kinda boring"  "You got mario party?" "We got dario gameboard" "Da- oh my god"  "You got the flash?" "We got blur." "You mean like dc?" "No hes from Washington comics."  "You got iron man?" "We have metal boy and fe-male, who is his mother" "Fe-male?! What the he'll kind of parody is that?!"
0:33 and 0:35 and 1:15 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 (pause?)
Funny that... i once saw someone wearing a SUEPRME shirt. Yes, you read that right.
Spotify? more like spot iffy
Can we just get an EMOTIONAL DAMAGE in one of these???
Steven's dad is just suffering emotional damage every time he tries to buy something. Rice, Sprint, Contacts, BigHard, Tournament Failure
I wonder if you can do Off-Brand YouTubers. "Do you know Steven He?" 'I know his sister Steven She."
“My villan exams” 😂😂😂
Who wants to play with a wiwi
U Do good but u cousin got 6 million subconscious do better u a failure!!!😄🥊👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿
Why did it take so long for him to do that?🤣
“Who wants to play with a “Wiwi”?”  😂😂
3 speed man does not just go fast he goes (very fast/extremely fast and ultimately fast) 😂🤣😂🤣
If these were legit products I would buy a bunch of them!
I love playing with my WiWi
“3 speed man” I’m dead 😂😂
Lol I lost it at 1:08 🤣
YOU AHVE TO PAAALY WITH THE WII WII
Wiwi. So cute)
Divorced Jane. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You’re hysterical Steven.   ❤you
""you got black bolt"". Nah, we got "white balls"".
not me tryna find sparkle unicorn's comment because she said she got noticed by steven😇👍
my dad bought star wart lego on my birthday
U know sometimes strong isnt that inaccurate
The last scene cracked me up 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When Nephew finally disappoints Uncle for the last time....
Lmaooo personally, I go out of my way to find the dumbest off brand merch possible. I wear that shit with pride, and I always make direct and intense eye contact with confused strangers who throw me incredulous looks after reading the stupid shit on my clothes. 💀
50% content, 50% ad. I hope they pay you good for that sort of time with your reach man.
My favourite game is to guess what the off brand item is before he says it
"Wow, I can't wait to get my wish granted by my BALLLLLL!" Love that line!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HE DID NOT JUST MAKE AN OFF BRAND OF DRAGON BALL NO WAY NOOOO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO. NOOOOOOOOO
If he sold some of those, (steroid woodie, Tuna®, a WiWi™️ Skinned Wii), I would probably buy them.
You know how "uno" means one in spanish? Did you know "um" also means one but in portuguese
I like how every comedy movie combined can’t be funnier than steven’s 3 min vids
1:14 TOY STORY FIVVEEEEEE WHAT. THE. HEEELLLLL **LIES ON THE FLOOR**
"Is that sheriff woody or steroids woody???"  I laughed until I got pneumonia
What this video is made of 50% content, 40% ad (which shouldn't be that big) and 10% bloopers
tuna killed me! 🤣🤣🤣
Divorce Karen is by far the most perfect náme combination
Ball
Ah yes boblox my favorite toy definitely not a ripoff of a popular game called roblox
*I WILL SEND YOU TO JEESUS* is a joke I do to a friend of mine that just so happens to share the same last name as Steven he
Sperm🤣🤣🤣
_How come we don't have UM in stores?_ 😔
For me, "I wiil send you to Jesus" start been better trend than "Emotional Damage" 😂🤣
I Will Send You To Jesus 😂
Master planker
Not gonna lie. I'd wear a tuna brand shirt for fishing.
THE WIWI
Wait.. you were acting?!!
Want to play some um?
hol' up ther... what failure management professional ever went shopping for the latest and most popular games for their kid's party?? There's a party??? xD
That WiWi part had me dead 😂
I was half expecting the pan from Star Wars to be to Star Trek
Um is me on every test.
BALL 😂
Why the hell is half the video NordVPN
I got NordicVPM.... I can watch content only available in Greenland XD
Yooo
the wiwi i thought was normal and bobloxe i thought it was lego thats why but then i saw the bob
I thought the first one’s joke is Spanish to Portuguese?
I was waiting for Emontinal Damage but that hit home to well 😂😂😂😂
Omg off brand 5!
i cant believe Steven He MURDERED Steven He with a slipper
Tuna now stating to get me
You know wi wi is chinese for pee/piss
Sperm T-shirt that got me so hard 🤣🤣🤣
I am happy to find you in Youtube. Hi from Russia ✌️💙😀
On 0:46 THAT ACTUALLY GOT ME REAL GOOD.
My god, this has to be one of the best series of skits you've made so far, it's absolutely hilarious. In fact, they make me laugh so hard that my sides hurt, like to the point where I feel like I'm gonna get a six pack just from the amount of laughing I'm doing.
When the recognizable one is the one you don't want to see lol
i show my dad these he says you are very funny
We got Divorce Karen 🤣🤣 that one almost ended me 🙏🏻
lmao
i laughed at "IS THAT SHERIFF WOODY OR IS THAT STEROID WOODY"
those toys are real and I did have them.
I swear I will this is so so funny
well that went dark......shame on you...
“E M O T I N A L D A M A G E”
i just imagine steve actually has a wi wi
You got my whole class talking In a Asian accent 😂
ITS BACK!
SPERM
Is it me or is it kind of fishy hmmmmm....
Finally, he's sent to off-brand Jesus, Hesus.
Me going in beach shops:
i would like to play with a wiwi
Kick the shoe off into his face, no hands
I love to play with my WiWi. Lol
Emotional Damage Remix :) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgL1teG4K70
Love it and hate it at the same time 🥲
HES SENT EM TO JESUS!
Plot twist, they are the actual brands, he is just dyslexic.
You got Star Wars?  Nah we got Galaxy Battles
Anyone notice the mining device in the background at the start? 😂😂😂😂
I'd wear the hell out of some sperm
It has returned on my birthday
Steven He:3 SPEED MAN!?  Me:HOW ABOUT SPODERMAN
I was expecting Pumo instead of Puma but Tuna works just as well.
Longest ad? For nord vpn?
2:03 Storeowner goes to the knockoff version of heaven
Steven’s dad saying WiWi WhO wAnTs To PlAy WiTh A wIwI had me cracking up
Even this show is off brand.   The original actor looks like cloud from FFVII
Steroid woody
Best off brand Supreme to " Sperm "
In my country Wi-wi means Pee...LOL
SPERM??????
3 SPEED MAN is my new password ^^
The way he says “what the hell” gets me every time
Speed man 3 tho 😂
Bro what's wiwi💀
"WI WI? WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A WIWI?" "I actually have one myself."
You should have just left the Star Wars bit alone and let the fact that it's from the sequels speak for itself.
0:48 I was on the floor laughing at this for 5 minutes straight that is brilliant.
I love the "WiWi" OMG 💀💀💀💀

“You got my hero academia?” “We got my bad guy exams”
"WIWI, WHO WOULD PLAY WITH A WIWI"
Soup time
This is so funny I fell of my chair

"Is that sheriff woody with steroids! "  Steven he made my day😆🤣
I vex an I watch this an just couldn't stop a laugh
Can't help but think some of that went into naming me....

The off brand supreme tho 😂😂
“Who wants to play with a WiWi”  Well not until the end of November. Stay strong boys
i think Jesus has a very busy schedule because of steven
Sometimes strong sent me
"Who wants to play with a wiwi??!?" "I have one actually"  Best quote this year I think
"Who wants to play with the wiwi?" "I have one of these myself actually" **Relatable**
I love your vids
U M boblox wiwi contacts divorced Karen BALL! Rick mad spirit cyclist Star war my bad guy exam’s sometimes strong what the hell 3 speed man tuna. Sperm
god this one killed me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Walked up in the crib playing WiWi
I am both dying and concerned at how out there each off brand is, but it is very concerning how some were actually produced since they are just so… out there stupid
Who wants to play with a wiwi XD 3 speed man XD star wart XD SPERM XD
1:45 I knew what was coming and I still laughed
The plank on the chair broke me
your videos are awesome, but your missing out on being in character as Steven's dad for the sponsor part, would been awesome to see. And people would actualy watch that part instead of skipping through it, just sayin.
did he said tschüss???
"Who want to play on the WIWI."  😂😂😂😂
Love it lol
When the AD and Bloopers is as long as the actual Video:  *E M O T I O N A L   D A M A G E*
finally
Can’t wait to come home from school and play Smash on my WiWi
These series are hilarious, love ya
I'd play some ummmmm
Neighbors are like "WTF is wrong with the Asian guy down the hall?"
Wrong, true asians never have birthday partys
Everything. Is. Perfect."I'll send you to Jesus"🤣
"You got Namor the Atlantean?" "We got Nah-mor the Aztek"
the last shirt  killed me XD
3SPEEDMAN and TUNA bad me dead
Kitkat, and tooldog
" is that sheif woody or steroid woody"
The sponsor of this video is Sud DCG.   Explanation if you didn’t get it: “Nord” means north in Italian. “Sud” means south in Italian. “VPN” means virtual private network. “DCG” means digital communal grid.
I will not stop cleaning my aquarium with soap until you make a part 6
The planking gets me every time 😂
Wi wi 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:39
"You got Steven He?" "We got Stacy She." *"STACY SHEEE."*

I'm going to need to see how well the Sperm merch sells. 😄
"Who wants to play with the wee wee??" "I actually Have one of those" I am dead💀
My Hero Academia/My Bad Guy Exams 😂
I would love Tuna lol
the fact he pronounced it as 'um' instead of some random asian 'yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu m' threw me off more
Jesus loves you
Planking is the best reaction ever
Thank you Stephanie Her
New vid
1:06 the best
That is giga chad, buff Woody.
I know it's not game series but do know that in game yandere simulator is new level diffuculty: Asian?! As a pro you are could you try it out, please? 😁

THREE SPEED MAN
The bloopers are the best it’s great when he laughs at his own stuff! That’s how you know your funny!
Hey I went to your link, but what is NorkLeak  VMP?
It only took five episodes to finally send that poor bastard to Jesus lmao
Hey yo gimmy that woody workout routine he built in different
It’s not off brand, it’s just the localized names.
i just broke up with my girlfriend we both agreed we enjoyed being friends better and this really cheered me up thanks man
you should have used "fix it in post" cus its very bright
Nord VPN is blocked by Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Prime, and more. You CANNOT use Nord VPN to bypass region locks. I love your videos but your sponsor is a liar who scams their clients with false advertisement.
0:33 WiWi   0:48BALL
2:03 Say the line
It's pretty unrealistic that Steven's dad would allow his son to go to a party. How's going to a party going to make Steven a doctor?
Steven He is the only one that can make us laugh with saying and doing such simple things.
He finally threw the slipper. So much I must learn. The technique, so many hidden techniques I must learn from the master.
"my villain exams" so basically the ACT
BALLLLLLL????
“Is that sheriff woody on steroids?”
This might have been one of the best ones so far.   "I can't wait for my wish to be granted by my BALL!" 🤣
"Wow I can't wait to get a wish granted by my BALL." - Steven He
My favorite part 1:15
Why do you only upload withs sponsers
Steven He Is my favorite YouTuber he is so funny and makes great content
why is uno, um and not uyes
Still he inspires us all on a daily basis even with the emotional damage videos
"do you have stranger things?" "no, but we have funny matter"
UM. Were they high when they designed that?
I swear this is too damn funny!!😂😂😂
I love these
quality content <3
“i WilL SeNd yOu tO JEsUs”
A lot of uh... *innuendo* there 😐
Speaking of knockoffs I had a seller try pawning off a nendoroid from chinese SNLL COMBANY instead of the official Japanese SMILE Company.  I promptly sent him to Jesus using my Timberland boots.
Are you French?
Gets better when you remember Wii Wii sport, Wii Wii Play, Wii Wii Music and Wii Wii Fit. But you really should have called it the Woo Wii for all us live subscribers :)
Imagine if steven got sponsored by Coke:  "Do you have coke?" "We have !sd3d"
WEEWEE!
That slipper was thrown for the sake of all of us.
"Who wants to play with a WiWi" lmaoooo💀💀💀💀
Who wants to play with a wiwi lol
Do why Elon musk didn’t buy Facebook
Do you have Best Buy? No, we have Worst Sell
bro im laughing so much i think i might die lol i love this series
Spirit Cyclist xDDD
Sperm
I love how the store clerk always startles the moment the customer starts talking. XD
I would like to play some UYES with my friends
Amazing video glad to see you back Steven By the way can I buy a sperm shirt from you
"The one with All-might?" "Yeah with the Sometimes-Strong" Lol wtf is that.. who the hell in this world has a superhero name like that
"Who wants to play with a WiWi?" Actually me with my weewee. 🤣
Tuna 🤣🤣
I lost at the slipper🤣🤣🤣🤣
WIWI!?!?!? Who wants to play with a WIWI? 🤣🤣🤣
WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A WI WI?!!!!! 😭😭💍😭
Now this time the Asian gets back at the seller for "sperm" merch lmao
Hey ya know what? I want a Divorce Karen
Someone should send he a weaponized slipper
My favorite is the Superman knockoff called Special Man!
he discorvered a new reverse card: the um reverse card
Finally something I reconiz.... 🤣🤣
3 speed man 🤣🤣🤣
Nice
No one gonna talk about supreme being copied to”Sperm”?
1:17 WOODY ON STEROID bro that literally made me bust down laughing
Legends say that the store manager is still flying through space to this day
When you find out that those are unedited pictures :/
TUUUUNAA! btw did you use that jacket other than making videos?
That slipper became a murder weapon that day  But even the police were knockoff, because the Pop Ice arrived instead
And soon he started selling rip off products to Jesus
wow, this never gets old
I will sennd you to jesus!
Boblox is a goofy ahh game company owned by Kaka V420  Edit: It was fake
great skit.
Bro how can the Beerus figure look both jacked and skinny at the same time.
Star Wart: Send It To The Moon! 🌚
The silence as he's getting the slipper was perfect. I couldn't stop laughing for like 2 minutes straight.
Wish X Alibaba has taken over again please help
Hey are you still in Ireland?
Do you know the supreme brick? ...yeah a sperm brick would be weird.
0:19 As a Robloxian, I can confirm everything about this image gives me fear, and trauma
Sperm lol I've been waiting for a new video. Nice.  Was that a neighbour at the door,
I can't tell in words how much i love your videos ❤️
I bet in like part 100 he’s finally gonna find a real brand
ITS BOBUX NOT BOBLOX
These off-brain dudes need to fInD THEIR LAST BRAIN CELL!
He was sent to Jesus 😂
I like this series
😂
WIWI?! WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A WIWI?! I AM GONNA DIE I CANT STOP REPLAYING THAT PART. 0:34

So the rumors were true. Nintendo's next console is called the WiWi!
Make when the fortune teller is asian
The wiwi got me on the floor 💀
Ah yes my favorite type of brand S P E R M
Is that sheriff woody or steroid woody 😂
He actually sent him to Jesus.
Spirit Cyclist 🤣🤣🤣
Woody with the GAINS!
Whatever happened to regular monetization where companies paid you to put ads on your video. The entire reason I paid for YouTube premium is so that I don't have to watch ads, but it seems now that every single f****** video that I watch the people are now doing commercials in their own f****** video. What's the point of a premium membership for no ads when a third of the content is still people promoting s***. 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
Finally he got tired of their shit and sent them to Jesus
He finally sent him to Jesus
"Steroid woodie" 🤣
I want a shirt that says “I will send you to Jesus”
Puma and Tuna killed me😂😂
It's always a good day when Steven He posts
Was that a bag of Beijing Corn Chips on the shelf?...lol
Tuna would actually sell well, but only to players of _Honkai Impact 3rd_ , 'cause it's a character fan-name. She comes in Regular, Salty, and Spicy varieties. We also have Chicken. She comes in Mild, Hot, and Scam. But don't ever ask about cooking the Goose.
So happy I found your channel. You are just too funny!
Nord VPN? I have West VPM
Star Wars 5: Return of the Gym 💪🏼🤣
It finally happened.  He sent someone to Jesus.
Is the FPS low on purpose
OUI OUI
"WHO WANT TO PLAY WITH WIWI????" *Jared Fogle has entered the chat*
the last one got me 😂
I have to wonder how Steven's Dad would react to Transformers Authentics - not knockoffs, but actual Hasbro product that, due to being made very cheaply and very simply as they were sold at bargain retailers and meant for young children, end up looking and feeling like knockoffs.
FINALLLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYY
"Sperm" LOL
Okay did not see off brand supreme coming lmao 😂
After that slipper throw every off brand thing had ceased to exist
WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A wiwi!!   I have one of those myself! xD hahaha  Also who the hell is Bob cracked me up!! Steven you are hilarious. Thank you for making us laugh!! Puma to Tuna?!?! Lol
I want that semen shirt (I’m a gay man)
Steven's Dad: "The time for threats are over."  *throws chancla*
I can’t believe Steven’s Dad just pick up the slipper normally, and wipes the dust off it, instead of sending him to Jesus in 2 seconds😂
I was half expecting it to be “Star Trek”…     Please don’t kill me…
Sperm 😂
UM is literally just Portuguese UNO
Nick Fury and Rick Mad 🤣🤣🤣
Great Video!
Boxblox what is David buski going to say about it
Steven's Dad's windup on that slipper throw was so good the Astro's got the camera out for it.
These videos are getting better and better.
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
instead of saying: "I will send you to jesus" say "I will send jesus to you"
Something actually kinda connected to this vid, my mom bought me pants with a buncha random logos(She's asian btw) , and I looked at one which I thought said supreme, then I looked a bit closer and it said "Superme"
Corn
He was not about to buy a whole gaming console for a party 😑😑😑😑
“Did Amber Heard lose the court trial?” “Oh, don’t you mean Amber Turd?”
Supreme-sperm 😅😅😅😅
🤣🤣🤣🤣
We get to witness the full power of the legendary slipper. Truly a weapon forged before physics was invented
I would buy the last two. they are too funny
You heard of nordvpn get ready for Nordicvpn
The last one before the commercial ^^
They finally made a portuguese version of UNO, darn, I need that.

3 speed man

Omg sitting on the chair 😂 absolutely killed it
BALL
The whooping was coming for a while.
"Star Wart? You should go to a docta!"  "Docta? Too expensive!"
"You got Mary Jane?" "We got divorce Karen." This is why this channel is great.
"Um" means one which also means uno in my language so, i guess that checks out
I bet he would've taken it if it was Spaceballs.
"is that Sheriff Woody on steriods? WOODY??"  that killed me! why is he so buff?? 😂💀
I can't believe your neighbours don't know what's going on and have to ask you during filming...  Don't they realise just how famous your Dad is?!!
Thank you Steven youre videos have helped me in hard times. And you help me forget thoose problems. And i love youre videos.

I loved the video it was super funny, but can you add more kid friendly stuff like the "sperm" joke, it was funny but I would really want to show my Asian dad this video without getting whooped like the store guy.
He sent him to Jesus
Emotional Damage.
😂 TUNA!!!!😹
Now he's sent to Chinese Jesus. Show us Chinese Jesus
When I saw the scene of him yelling from the hallway "Tuna!?" I thought to myself "I bet it would be awkward if he encounters a neighbor while filming that" .... Then I watch the outtakes 😂
PLEASE KEEP MAKING THESE VIDEO THESE R THE BEST AND ALWAYS MAKE ME HAPPY
Wow the jokes are starting to get vulgar
Ow man I just piss my self in a clinic seeing this lmfao 🤣
"We got My Bad Guy Exams." had me laughing too much.

B A L L
I love this series, but this episode I think it was the best one so far! I want that Tuna shirt so bad! 🤣
Boblox lmao
Maybe Steven's dad should ask for only Off Brand stuff, to see if they have the real stuff instead...
this off brand series never gets old! But have you heard of that youtube channel called Stephanie She?
The UNO offbrand instead of UM i don't even get the joke lol...I would have put "dos" get it?? Uno dos lmao😅...ok I'm done😐
“WIWI?! Who wants to play with a WiWi?”  *Little do you know…*
“Who the hail is Bob”   …then who’s Rob from Roblox
The best video to ever exist. So as the others :)
Steven's Dad going *everywhere* in fluffy slip - on slippers lol
Goku and Gogeta look okay but beerus and piccolo went to Ohio and came back looking like this !
“WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A WIWI” they way he said it was too funny
I'm dying. XD
He just sent him to jesus!
11/10 for the throw performance
I. Am. Bob
I love how the shopkeeper looks at the slippers so patiently and wonders, "what could possibly be done with those slippers now?" 😂
I remember seeing fake brand stuff like that my first time in NYC Chinatown. I was so confused.
Star Wart... EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!
I love these videos they are so funny!
who want to play with wiwi... that almost killed me
I love the random planking. Just a classic.
Steven: Screams in frustration “Who wants to play with a WiWi?!?”   My response: Uh, ladies of the night do. 😉😉👌😂🤣😂  I couldn’t help myself when you setup that type of questioning Steven. 😊
I love this it funny 😂 nice videos
Marry Jane- Divorce Karen got me!
I wonder if Steven smokes weed
I will send you to Jesus. Never gets old
1:51 I would buy it, and wear it proudly on the streets. Gives massive pp energy, literally
The Sperm shirt looks like a Red Bubble creation 😂
"double lock that, please." killed me :D
Wiwi
The jokes keep getting better! This is my favourite Off Brand vid so far keep grinding Steven 💪
The most unrealistic thing about this skit is that an Asian dad is going out of his way to find actual entertainment for his children.
The best part about this videos is the reactions that he makes when he role plays
🌾
I am looking forward to see a real spanking with the shoe. Not an off branded spanking.
wait wait, double lock?  you ok Steven, do your neighbors not enjoy the behind the scenes recordings?
Yay Steven, you finally threw the slipper at the off-brands employee, fuiyoh!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"wHo WAnTs t0 pLaY wItH a wEe WeE"
Toy Story 5, the movie where Bo is killed from falling and breaks (since she's made out of glass), and Woody goes full John Wick on the antagonist.
The unrealistic part is that Asian parents would never go out to buy their kids video games
I would love to buy steroid woody
Boblox is the real one roblox is fake
my doctor acedemia seem too real; to be a joke
WiWi?  who wants to play with a WiFi? Use with Joystick Controller 🕹
I absolutely love Steven's videos. They are only a few minutes long, but you always know there is going to be at least a few great jokes in there
Give me my hero academia
Woody on steroids 😂😂😂
I absolutely love these videos 🫶🏽
Neat
I though those weird brands we're only in LatinAmerica🤣
supreme ->>>>..>>&*(*% = sperm
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY WHATS NEXT WIWI U

The moment he said: "WIWI?!" made me laugh so hard i had a heart attack
XD
🤣🤣🤣
1:31 Why is Steven's dad coming out from behind the counter? 😂
I love this series 😂
*planks on chair
Tuna *thats kinda fishy*
The wait is over for off brand😁
0:33 wiwi? Pff ive got something beter. Weewee
This series is perfection.
3:27 You can hear the echo of his apartment. He probably bribes his neighbors with Beijing Corn so they don't call the cops.
I’m just waiting for him to actually buy one of the off brands and just throw it at him instead of the slipper😂
Please plank at increasing heights like a step-ladder to a full-ladder
DO YOU HAVE MY HERO ACADEMIA?  No, we have *"YOUR VILLAIN COLLEGE"*
The thumbnail already got me laugh lol      𝙒𝙞𝙒𝙞
“WIWI?! WHO THE HAIL WANT TO PLAY WITH A WIWI?!” I died at this part
THE SLIPPER THROW NEVER BE GONE BUT BAHHAHAH THIS IS SO FUNNY
Like Supreme? Yeah you're gonna love this we actually have an exclusive. Sperm 😂Imagine getting pregnant of a t-shirt
Tuna is the best 😂😂😂
Oh my god, he actually sent him to Jesus this time! RIP off-brand salesman, you will be mist.
76k views in 3 hours is amazing
Sperm

He got sent to Jesus
Been waiting for another one of these!
I still wait for them to actually have the item xD like the one none off brand is a toaster or something

Forget the super hero’s say good bye
My cat has requested the TUNA shirt please and thank you. LOL
So close to 6M you can do it Steven

I remember being here when you were about to hit 50k subs
The legend of slipper has returned with ultra emotional damages that is 160.5 %  guaranteed
🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣🔣
I actually really want one of those Tuna muscle shirts. They look nice.
What happens if Anime goes Off brand???
“I will send you to Jesus.” Now that’s some serious emotional damage.
“I will send you to Jesus” 😂
Yeah baby, a new episode
You got NordVPN, we got FordPrivateNetwork
3:39 plot twist: Steven was actually British the entire time
Week part 5 baybeeee
Sperm
Wii wii
Steven: "Welcome to everything is off-brand 527... I'm tired.. My legs are almost dying off.. I'm in therapy. I'm on 16 different medications that all cancel each other out. I have no sense of time and I'm severely depressed. I can't anymore, I'm broken. But apparently this series will never get old to you, and my dad will slipper me if I don't make another, so here I go..."
The best part was the last part  The slipper was well deserved
I love the Steven's Dad videos. Can we get more "emotional damage" and "failure management" skits? It reminds me of my youth.
Love him saying, “I will send you to Jesus.”
I will send you to Jesus - is the best line
For dragon ball I legit thought he was gonna say “lizard circle” or “Lizard Sphere” 😂
Waiting for video where Steven fianlly send him to Jesus.
U M "Were they high when they designed that" No just confused
Asian stores be like.
Is there an offbrand version of NordVPN?
"Who wants to play with a WiWi?"😆
That slipper preparation... priceless! 🤣 .....and ....woooooooosh! Thank you I really enjoyed that. You make me wonder why you have O N L Y  5.9M subs.
Best actor ever😂
Funny as hell man love the off brands 🤣 😂
I'm from Bahamas 🇧🇸 I love all your videos
MORE OFFBRAND HORRAY
HE POSTED
Off brand Supreme at 1:50 made me choke on my Doritos.
Ah yes Steven's Dad getting so mad that he is slowly breaking the fabric of space and time by coming out of places even though he was in the room in the previous shot.
don't forgot about  overstory
"divorced karen" im dead💀✨️
This is probably the best part of the series yet.
I love your contents especially the punishment videos when i showed mom one of clips the one that you say to force a child to learn useless skills like piano she almost wanted to send me to jesus

He was so disappointed he didn’t even try to take the slipper swiftly he just did the
Bro alright I gotta stop watching your videos when it's potty time.... Was trying so hard not to laugh my ass off in that stall. Someone walking by hearing me giggling like an idiot in the stall. Especially when you start yelling out who wants to play with the wii wii.  Almost repeated it out loud until I remembered where the hell I was! 🤣🤣🤣

He back
That slipper ... very strong weapon
This is so much more funny then the others. The pictures really make it for me, but I do know it does take quite a lot of time to find and come up with them though.
"WIWI" AND "BAAAALLLL" SENT ME FLYINAHAHAA

2:00: Your slipper looks very similiar to my new slippers.

Stop this madness, what do you want? PLEASE, WHAT DO YOU WANT??
1:14 toy story 5, I thought there was only 4
I found your channel about a mouth ago, and man I gotta say. Your fucking videos kill me 😂😂. Tell your “dad” this Steven said, hi 👋🏻
You got spiderman?  Nah we got Rabbitman.
This is definitely my favorite series from him
"Who would want to play with a WiWi?" "I have one of those, actually." *Ayo?*
I like your dad. He reminds me of my Chinese acupuncture doctor who has helped much in keeping me around to enjoy videos like this!
Best series ever 😂😂💔
the sperm shirt was so random. What is more random is that I've seen that shirt before, and I'm weirdly considering buying it
This vid got me cracking up at 12:39 in the night😂😂

"You got One Punch Man?"  We have Two Kick Woman
I have been waiting for part 5
“Can I have all these games?” “No, we have all the games at home” *The games at home:*
I used to think that this video format might get old , I was wrong it never gets boring
Lol!! I'm always laughing so hard whenever I watch you Steven, especially when you say the most ridiculous things with a straight face 😂💕
Been saying for a long time. Get kevin hart and Steven he in a movie
UM  in portuguese is uno
Your video just made my Friday! Hillarious!!!
How to get rid of people problems:   “I WILL SEND YOU TO JE-SUS.”
The store worker finally got the shoe
That slipper looks too new please make it look like emotional damage
r/crappyoffbrands - The movie
Yesterday I watched Steven He in a lifetime movie titled: betrayed by my bridesmaid.
Motherfucker actually got sent to jesus tho
0:34 PAUSE!? 🤣 Edit: 1:28 Basically Spider Man No Way Home in a nutshell. I can't think of an off brand name for Spider Man No Way Home can someone think of a great off brand name.
"...B A L L. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET MY WISH GRANTED BY A  B A L L."
I though when he said, "I will send you to Jesus" he was gonna say, "oh we got him too" and it pans to Mexican Jesus.
This series is my all-time favorite part of your channel Steven. That series always makes me laugh! You deserve 10 million subscribers! Keep doing your thing. #Emotional Damage
I could seriously feel the pain from him just saying BALL.
1:19 he says Star Wars 5 instead of Toy Story 5 here lol
"Who wants to play with the WiWi" 💀
WiWi and Star Wart had me dead 😂😂
I had a WiWi, best christmas gift ever found on a flea market
loved it so much keep being amazing :)
I am pretty new to your channel and  just love all your skits! You make me laugh so much and I thank you for that! Unfortunately, it seems YouTube turn off notifications for your channel on me and I can't seem to fix it. So I will just have to watch out for your next video.
This is soo funny! Thanks for making me laugh 🤣 But that slipper tho 😆
sheriff woody or steroid woody 😂😂😂😂
Put  a brand and their off-brand together and see what will happen. I'll go first. Supreme Sperm.
I bet making these videos are biggest abb workout
0:48: BALL
I love that this video is liked more then it's watched
It finally happend!  He sent him to jesus.
Instead of "Star Wart" it would have been an epic burn if you labeled it "Star Trek" looool
Allright cheers or tschüss?
You know when your parents take time to take off the slipper you fucked up
I use South PVN!
BAAAAAAAAAAALLL
I wish someone would scream "Sometimes Strong" instead of "Allmight" in the actual anime
Imagine Seeing this on 12mn
Star wart had me rolling. Almost blew my soup thru my nose.
... WiWi 😂😂😂
"Who wants to play with a WiWi?"  Not gonna lie... I chuckled a bit.
1:08 Honesty 'Sometimes Strong' is the most honest off brand name I've heard for All Might you'll know if you watched the show I'm not going to spoil it for you
Steven’s Dad finally sent him to Jesus 😂
Do you have any slippers?  Yes, of course!            *shows a slider(a glove for your feet)
Stevens dad made pink t-shirt and coat combination a legend in history
This gave me emotional damage😄😄😄
Were they high when they designed it
When other Asians meet Chinese:        And just to go certain: this is just a joke. So please don't explode like an overheat teapot.
"Boblox?"    "Who the hell is Bob?"
This is his breaking point after 4 videos of off-brand products.
I guess he really got sent to Jesus after all
Oh my goodness. Planking is the best part but seeing the off brand items is the 2nd best part.
The best part is him juat screaming "B A L L! I CANT WAIT TO GET MY WIISH GRANTET BY MY B A L L S"
The ball games must be nasty
The slipper throw is Steven's strongest - and most humorous - strength. What a comedian 😆
It finally happened. He sent someone to Jesus
"You got Monster Energy Drink?" "Ya, we got Hero Lazy Drink."  "HERO LAZY DRINK!?"
LOL Tuna?!!? Lol that was so funny keep up the hilarious videos  also bring back redit report card
Never fails to entertain!!
Where do I get that sperm shirt
The DragonBall absolutely killed me😂😂😂
3 Speed Man 🙄 Like seriously 😂
The WiWi 🤣🤣🤣🤣
dogen sound effect
I like how the merchant is always shocked to see a customer walk into his store.
Tuna shirt would be epic tbh
You got an a? No we got B
Boblox? Who the hell is bob?
When you came from outside I was thinking "I wonder what his neighbors think of all the yelling"--only to see the blooper at the end. Also got me good with "Supreme" 🤣
0:50 bro had me chuckling a lot
Do you have moon Knight we have sun knight
These off-brand videos are great!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
My degenerate mind can only wonder how many takes it took for Steven to finish the "WiWi" part.
4,057
There's no way XD
fun fact: some Roblox players actually call roblox boblox as a joke it's a joke in the Roblox community
I like the boblox
“STAA WART- hehehe”  That laugh just killed me 3:13
wow 4k views and 18k likes
Love your Asian accent
I'm sorry to say this... Is something wrong with a quality?
thats crazy.. is this how they display them actually ?? bc we have the original names for everything NEVER ever seen an off brand ._.
“who wants to play with a wiwi?” “I have one of these myself actually” 😂😂😂😂😂😂 PERFECT!!!
NOT THE WI WI 😭😭😭😭😭😭
DUDE I REMEMBER ASKING MY PARENTS FOR A WII AND THEM GETTING ME A WIWI YOU JUST UNLOCKED A CORE MEMORY LMFAO
I will send you to Jesus    Steven he-
Steven's Dad is already a bigger star than him.
WOW I CANT WAIT TO GET MY WISH GRANTED BY MY BALL
Amazing
And with that one launch of the shoe...a man was sent to Jesus today.  REJOICE!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
The offbrands 😂
You got "Mary Jane" We got "Divorced Karen"  that got me good!
“ Um? Where they high when they made this ?!”
That Tuna shirt better be added to the store
*"SPERM"*
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
The Wii bit killed me 🤣
Star Wart!!😆 dead dead
Steven if he lives in China: This Video is sponsored by SouthVPN
I expected to find "Bejin Born" merch🤣
All Might is technically Sometime Strong now
Who likes to play with their WiiWii you say? 😏
I wonder what Stevens favorite off brand product is
BALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Steven He can't miss a funny joke
nice,.
The WiWi, the French entry to the Gaming Market with motion controls
Not realistic. Flying slippers must be thrown on a daily basis in that store so the employee would have jumped out a window (and still been hit.)
MY FAVORITE SERIES IS BACK
Lost is at "Sperm"
wiwi 😂
the force Stevens father and CEO of Beijing Corn threw that slipper. that shop keep instant transmission to Failure Management summer camp with Jesus is the head counselor.
Is it just me or his view count stuck on 3.8K.?
@1:57 the clerk should have started running. Then again, there's no escaping the slipper.
Is Nord VPN also off-brand😂😂
WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A WIWI? "I actually have one of these myself" got me on the floor 🤣🤣☠
HOW CAN YOU FIND UP WITH THESE
And when the branded items are there they can't afford it!
How do you not know who bob is?
So many jokes could've been made with 'who wants to play with a wiwi.'
We got WIWI
"Is that sherrif Woody or steroids Woody?!?!" nah man, this cracked me up too much
Mary-Jane = Divorced Karen  I died 😂
I will send you to Jesus is the greatest line ever
Someone has been browsing Wish
Woody on steroids hahaha 🤣🤣🤣
Awesome Awesome Awesome.  So great. At Star Wart I got my own slipper ready. Lol. Thank you, I appreciate the  laughs.
I will send you to Jesus always has be dying 🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Misbehave: Slap with hand Get complains from teachers: slipper Fail in exams: Belt.
‘’I will send you to Jesus’’ casual Steven He
This takes off brand to a whole new level
‘’Is that woody on steroids’’, i bursted in laughter haahhaahha
Steven's dad: "I will send you to Jesus." *Clerk offers more off-brands, get's hit with slipper* Clerk looking around at all the clouds: "Oh this must be the pearly gates." Nice guy Jeter: "So, sorry  this is the Milky Turnstile." Clerk: "Am I in hell?" Jeter: "No, no, this is worse. This off-brand Kingdom of Heaven, officially called Republic of Melvin. Everything here vaguely looks like it's supposed to, but somehow everything is very wrong."
Who would want to play a wiwi?
i love your videos im chinese as well come from lan zhou and now im in africa , i make kids here all support you !!!!!
Say hello to Jesus from me
2:02 Fire in the hole!
LOVE LOVE the outtakes
the “I will send you to jesus” makes me crack up every time
0:34 *slightly looks at camera* he knew what he was doing, and he was doing it well. **edit part, following original comment** 1:51 *takes off shades* now this. THIS was what I wasn't expecting, but I am kinda happy he did it because, well that is funny. But I did not see that coming -._-.
I would actually buy Tuna branded merchandise 🤣🤣🤣
the "double lock that please" blooper was the best
3 speed man 💀
Anybody knows where to buy a Tuna Shirt? XD
"You got Mary Jane?" "We got divorced Karen"  Alright, that one hurt
need unreal tournament soundtrack for the slipper hit... like the announcer said "Headshot"
Star Wart. Of course. Good choice and nice job with the video.
Fantastic!
Wii but is rip-off
I'd play boblox
No one:  *Steven records a video* His neighbours: wat ta hell?💀
Ok, new headcannon. This is why Asian dad goes hard. He doesn't want his boy peddling off-brand. (Keep up the good work. This is hilarious.)
Only in Ohio
we want more off brand videos  It's the reason I subscribed to ur channel
NOT ROBLOX, AND MY HERO ACADAMIA
This is my favorite Steven He Series, I always love seeing the store clerk get scared and then showing him all these products that are off brand to the real deal. So what's next, is there gonna be an off brand for Doraemon?
BRO WHY DOES IT SAY SPERM?!😂😂😂
Me and my friend's favorite line is I will send you to Jesus, my mom is not too happy with us saying that per say
The UM game is probably a Brazilian knock-off of UNO since "UM" means "one" in Portuguese 🤣🤣🤣
Mcdonalds would be mcDaffy
Slipper: ' I will send you to satan.'
They say laughter is the best medicine. I watched this video and my flu went away, thank you Steven.
A fost one. Good job
You got NordVPN? We got SafeAFK
Absolute f-in genius
Wiwi, toy story 5's (woody in steroids) and 3 speed man got me hard... seriously I can't stop laughing lool 🤣
The way he says WiWi... I completely lost it.
Wait, isn't this a store? Was he wearing slippers... outside?
uno is one in spanish, Um is one in portugues , so it is not wrong, just not the right country.
Steven brought back planking. The world is doomed.
sperm-print was the best
Nah steroid woody would be much smaller
i’ve been watching u before EMOTIONAL DAMAGE and i can’t believe how much u’ve improved. also, “i will send u to jesus” hits different 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
buff woody got me cracking up
No Matter how bad my day is going your videos always brighten my day right up.
FAIIIIIIIILURE "with asian accent"
*planks aggressively
WiWi how mature
HOLD UP 1:04 did he just said that this should be seen by a doctor? I thought he is a Doctor  My live is a lie :(
First of all, I want you to know that, I love your videos man! This is why I am writing this. This video (+ some/many videos) look too high on contrust and sharpness as well as brightness. My eyes felt uncomfortable watching this video. He my bro please look in to this. Big Fan. Cheers..
Is it wrong I unironically really want a TUNA shirt?
Wi Wi, who want to play with a Wi Wi 😭😭
We had an old af social network called iWiW in our country - made the WiWi joke all the more funnier.
YESSS CONTENT
I have to admit I may not understand the jokes as I am not a regular visitor. Is this mocking how in Us everything is about brand names and trademarks, instead of the actual content?
Alternative title: When you have to pick up stuff quickly for a house party but you stop at dollar tree
Bro why his channel so Damn good
Bro for the first one I was expecting just "one" or "un"
Nord VDN
3 speed man🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
3 Speed Man?!! lmaooo
I think at this point Stevens dad just goes into any store that has a discount sign on it :)
0:09, 0:17, 0:33, 0:47, 1:01, 1:15, 1:28, 1:29, 1:30, 1:39, 1:50, 2:02,
dude half your video is an ad
Do you have Stephen he? No we have Stephanie she…
The word “sperm” was ultra emotional damage to my brain cause now I have to bleach it
Wildman
HE DID IT! HE SENT HIM TO JESUS!
1:49 *He did recognize it*
Steven my cousin got the boblox we were happy

"You got Mary Jane?"  "We  got divorced Karen"  Lol that was genius, took me a bit to catch it.
"finally something I recog......."    sperm
"Double lock that" yeah I'm pretty sure that's what your neighbour said too 😂😂🤣
yooooooooooooo
I think the Tuna brand would be really successful in Asia.
Come on Steven....this is not fair Daddy has to do everything.
That one type of content that never gets old keep up these types of videos ❤️
3.8k views and 14k likes sounds about right for this masterpiece.
Steven : you have my hero academia?  Him: we got my bad guy exam  IM DEAD LOL💀

Steven's Dad: Who wants to play with a WiWi??? Shop Owner: I have one of those myself, actually. 😂😂😂
I WILL SEND U TO JEJUS
"were they high when they designed that"
I’m surprised the store didn’t get taken down.  You know how strict Nintendo is with their copyright laws.
These puns are glorious!!!🤣
The way he said WiWi got me laughing  🤣
Tuna brand! 😂😂😂
The neighbours: "Kelly, our Asian neighbour is going in and out of his front door yelling 'tuna!' Should we be worried for him?"
Dude experienced a failure management class first hand (literally) at the end
In bosnia i saw a off brand uno game called dos with a blue packaging lol

WiWi 🤣
Color of this video is a failure
happy day
Off brand uno exists. They call it Duo. It's... It's well.... It's a thing...
Ngl, I thought it was gonna cut to a Star Trek set, that on a second look said Star Rek
So....are the pics of the off brands all real, or photoshopped? 😂 I have a feeling they're all real.
Since the salesman is unalive because being hit by the slipper, does this signify the end of When Everything is Off Brand series??😖😖
I bought a sweater that I thought had "Star Wars" on it. When I got home and looked closely, it said "Stop Wars."  I have it collecting dust in the closet, although I think it's a good time to put it on now that I think about it...
YEAH! So Epic! 🔥🔥🔥❤️
That shoe on the hand.. 😄💗
"Supreme" 😬
Hahaha so the neighbour doesn't watch these videos ??? 😂
Yes I got the GordVPN
Spirit cyclists🤣🤣🤣🤣 i cant stop laughing
Do yo haf NordVPN?  yes, actually we have VPNEast
Ah yes he finally committed Asian violence towards the off-brand seller.
Imagine one day you go to a shop and suddenly everything is off brand  Steven probably: establishes off brand fairprice  Also him: 📈📈📈 stonks
We got divorced Karen OMFG I am literally skipping abs workout today from laughing that hard
"Tuna, it's kind of fishy." That killed me.
Those dead poses were simply hilarious 😂😂😂
They get B for failure.
(Drips)
Love you steven
Another wonderful video that made our day for all of us!!😊 Superb video steven! Cant wait to buy the BBALLS to set them up along with WIWI
“Do you have any YouTube channels like Steven He?” “Yes, we have Steven She.”
This is exactly like toy shopping in a Chinese mall in Toronto.  Hilarious!
What casuals get: SUPREME a.k.a Drip  What Asians get (75% discount): 1:50
Who doesn’t like wiwi ?
Bro his videos are so damn funny and awesome xD

*clears throat VICIOUSLY*   Ahem....   Sperm.

The floating over the chair and steroids woody 🤣🤣🤣🤣. My poor ribs
This dad came expecting to buy board/card games, jumped to a FREAKIN GAME CONSOLE, then settled for toys and finally just... clothing.  I don't know if Steven's dad knows what a party usually consist of, but I at least know I would have wanted him as my friend's dad
What about Star Gate? We have Planet Door.
"Do you guys have Steven He?" "We have Alex She."
LOL I love these skits! xD xD Wiwi and Tuna! I can't!! xD xD xD These are genius!
"Speed Man" got me xD Excellent video and acting.

Clash Royale players when they hear "spirit cyclist":
Are the neighbors not yet used to Steven's dad?
Wiwi and Ball are my favorite brand 😂
i died 💀💀💀
XD I love this series XD
U forgot the Y Square game block
Never ask a women her age Never ask a man his salary Never ask Steven he how does he find fake brands
FINALLY
you missed an opportunity to do 'roll mad'...
*"I will send you to Jesus"* never gets old
Woody built different 😳😳😳
2:03 my personal timestamp
"Were they high when they did that?" Had me rolling
40 minutes early
"You got hi-c?" "We got low-D" "You got little Debbie?" "We got big Debra?"  "How bout music? You got Jay-Z?" "We got May-B" "You got Iron Maiden?" "We got Steel Gentleman"  "Okay, okay. How about video games? You got Madden 23?" "We got angry 22" "You got Final Fantasy?"  "We got First Daydream."  "...I will send you to Jesus..."
”Double lock that please!” Killed me
why does spirit cyclist sound like a dead version of mumen rider from opm
“You got Mary Jane?” Asian dad knows how to party
The "I will send you to Jesus 😐" never fails to make me laugh 😂

Bro you are an oof brand Asian
Lmfaooo the Sperm shirt got me 😂😂😂😂
I'd buy that TUNA..... and the SPERM too.....
I genuinely bought my son a star wart millenium falcon off of Taobao. It is the best way to reward your failure for getting 100% at his math test. Sadly he got 98 on his most recent test so my wife beat him to death. Thankfully we are allowed 3 children now.
"wiwi! nobody wants to play with a wiwi"   "I have one of those myself actually"
"I will send you to Jesus" LOL
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I knew the sperm one is gonna come up
Asians too smart for this world  They deserve a better place
BALL?!!
only 34 mins 700+ comments
Mary Jane Divorce Karen.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What’s that racket in the hall honey!? No worries, it’s just the FAILURE making another video to upload to FaceSpace
'Tuna, is it meal, is that kinda fishy.'   Next level of speach
you got a b failure!
It feels illegal to be this early
The neighbour asking him to quiet the f down, or he wil get some huge Tuna all over his face xD
what the heeell? 2 min video 1:47 sec advertisement
My favorite game boblox
"Who wants to play with a WiWi ?!!!"  *teenagers trying not to look sus*
The way you said "What the hell" on Woody, I felt that.
i love your videos keep up the great work man and love everthing off brand series. keep up the good work
I’m going to sound so weird and silly, but in an ideal world, Uncle Roger and Mr. He (the Asian Dad with slipper, not Steven) are a cute, bickering couple.
NEW VIDEO 30 minutes !!!!
Lowkey one of the best series on Youtube
You missed the opportunity to make the joke about Woody and Viagra :D ... get it.. because ... bigger Woody... yeah, I'll show myself out
This video made me laugh so much worse I also coughed when Steven said I will send you to Jesus Christ I also said Jesus Christ thank you so much for making this funny video steven

The "I will send you to Jesus" + Slipper threat is also extremely common amongst Mexican mom's (personal experience)
Wow! You heart a lot of comments. That's cool!
My Hero Academia = My Bad Guy Exam 🤣

Still love the Chinese's shirt that was clearly for kids that said, very clearly, "Fuck You" in English.
SPIRIT CYCLIST HAHAHA TALK ABOUT SUSTAINABLE UNLIVING.
Funny enough, I have that exact Star Wart model sitting on my shelf. it's not that different from the actual lego
He def deserve the slipper for trying to sell a shirt to kids with that on it.
Messaging in the first 30 mins
And he planks himself once again
Tuna 🤣🤣🤣
*WiWi🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣*
When every knock off brand is an oxymoron
can I get a like 🥺👉👈? big fan ❤️❤️
The devil works hard but people creatively plagiarising products work harder.
Haha. Good stuff. Well done steven
These videos succeed in making my days a lot better 😂. Thank you, Steven
the not on brand names is absolutely perfect for chinese ripoffs
"I will send you to Jesus." If any asian says this to you, you need to grovel, but if it's too late just accept your fate, prepare your words to say to god, because they will send you there in a flash.
Ayo where can I get that Supreme?
Dad caught me flipping him off.  Now I have motional damage.
3 SPEED MAN?!!! WHAT THE HAIL HE SAY ⁉️
Omg, I thought I misread that last one 😅
hii
You pull out your Wii it's party time, you pull out your WiWi, the cops get called.
lol
Asian Dad: “Who wants to play with a WiWi?” Gentleman with Bright Jacket: “I have one of these myself, actually.”  I see what you did there, you man of art of and culture.
Always makes me laugh 🤣
Ghost Rider!

Return from the gym 🤣🤣🤣🤣
lol

This will forever be amazing 😂😂😂😂
Not gonna lie wiwi is something I would give to my nephew if I could you know... for some emotional damage
Ngl bro i'd probably get the steroids woody and the speed man 3 backpack bruh 💀
Fuiyoo
Finally boblox is a real thing
I’m dying—I just want to do my work—but u said nope “laugh”
Um
Off brand punishment: "I'll send you to Judas".
I never thought I'd see the day when Steven's dad would ACTIVELY request a video game console. Less time to get that 5.0 GPA, y'know?
I don’t know about the Looking Glass but I feel like I have definitely stepped into a 2000s video game where proper licensing didn’t take place lol
Lol
How does this series get funnier each time?
I acutally have a knock off star wars lego set. Its Fire
you have a small WiWi
I'll send you to Jesus 😂
I’ve been wait for the 5th version of this video!!!
im in vietnam and now it is 00:08
TUNA!!!!!!
I LITERALLY JUST WANTED THE WHILE SERIES 30 MIN AGO, AND 7 MIN LATER HE UPLOAD THE 5TH
Sperm was perfect timing.
Best videos ever Steven keep up the good work man so funny 🤣🤣
Me: Do you have NordVPN? Uncle: Yes, we have KnotVPN Steven He: I will send you to Jesus
1:52 💀
Not at WiWi 😭 And damnn woody kinda buff bruh.  Just kll me now. Oh wait im dying from laughing too hard. BYE U can send me to Jesus now🩴
WiWi Is the best switch ever made. I wanna play with my WiWi now
I will send you to Jesus 💀😭🤣🤣🤣
We all come just to see the slipper throw 🤣
Mom I want a Supreme merch. Dad: oh boy.
Got something a little cheaper than Nord VPN? Got Nerd VPN?
I've never been more proud of Steven than I did when he made the My Hero Academia reference, "Sometimes Strong" HAHAHA
0:33 I nearly died with laughter.🤣
3:28 bro just teleported lol
Lol the WIIII WIIII
"TUNA? Is it just me, or does that seem kinda fishy?" 😆 The off brand vids are the best!
Why play ‘UNO’ when you can play ‘SUMO’? All the powerful cards will throw less powerful cards from the ring.
I like how each time Steven enters a shop the dude in there makes this surprised little scarejump.
🤣😂
Why does he continue to go to these stores? (If any bots steal this comment it was originally made by catsTM)
"TUUUUNAAAAAA!"AHuahuHAUhauHAUhauhA
I love kike and supoeme merch
I came by just in time
It’s no longer Sheriff Woody, it’s Senator Logger
The Star Wars one made me chuckle. These are all hilarious.
"TUUNA?"
I have tears from laughing, hilarious as always
the shopkeeper has been sent to jesus
🎉 been waiting for a new video , thank youuuu😊
"WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH A WIWI!?" Steven He, 2022
1:38 Tuna!!! That one had me laugh out loud.
I have a wiwi as well. Many fun times.
Hey, he recognized it
This is the result of unmanaged failure.  Top marks for content and humor!
Yess I've been waiting for this!!
upthumb for the content, then downthumbed for half the vid being advert. worse is that these commercial vpns ar just honey traps aggregated for the gov agencies to slurp data from more easily. they are not vpn at all. they are just proxies behind a firewall.  and if anyone think they are not able to be suppoened for all the data and ip addresses that go through their services... you're kidding yourself.
dcdcd
I need the WIFI password.
0:50 omg balllsss
The neighbor whos probably concerned for Steven's sanity lol
Steven should make a video called: When Half Of The Video Is A Sponsor Segment
The one with wiwi was funny
Hhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiijiii
I love this series. It’s my favorite series that involves Steven’s Dad.
That Bob Lox's was hilarious hahaha
Already said this but I just love the idea of Steven He's dad trying to buy bejien corn but there all discount versions
My father is a shop owner we sell  Kiss-kat Dark magic 🤣🤣
"Were they high when they designed that?" Gotta be my favorite line
he finally sent someone to jesus by the slipper throw
Steven, you are just to good for this planet.
BALLLLLL
Sheriff Woody or Steroids' Woody 😭😭
Top 10 strongest anime characters:  Steven's Dad, there is no escaping his slipper.
I can’t even imagine what it must be like being your neighbor 😂😂😂
i LOVE this series
Nice.
puma eat fish though, and tuna is a fish...      *could it be that it's a brand eat brand world out there now?*
I actually seen wiwi at a store at ross I believe
I was hoping you would`ve said "Does it look like I`m French?" at WiWi
great vid bro u never make me stop laughing
Dude!!!! You grew so fasttt I was there since 600k Subs Ago
The wise steven's dad once said: "wee wee"
Sperm im dead 🤣
The supreme off brand got me dead 💀
Steven always manages to catch us all off guard and give us a good off-brand laugh, keep up the good work!
“I can’t wait to get my wish granted by my ball”  I was drinking coffee when I heard this line lol
That's not woody that is irony.
I’ve seen Boblox in stores!
Well . The guy finally get send to hell
FAIIILLLURE! 😂
"The one with all might?" "The one with sometimes strong" Never have I ever been offended by something I 100% agree with
Balls damaged after this
Divored Karen probs the best thing in this.
Love the colors, but the video feels a little overexposed. Not an expert, just a viewer's opinion. Maybe fix it in post? 😜
FInnaly someone got sent to jesus!!!!!!
Whenever someone does a live action skit there are always comments of "wow the neighbors must think you're crazy"  From the ending I'm assuming that's the case lol
Isn’t the store clerk Walmart Indiana jones.  The off brands videos are just the best
UM?
As many times as he's said "I will send you to jesus" he finally does it
Uhmm where they High when they made this game?
What the hell is still epic. Love from india.
I am seeing comments from days ago but for me this was uploaded 9mins ago  Ur telling me I was late before it was set on private
"The one with All Might" "Yeah with Sometimes Strong" Isn't that... what he already is ?
Yes
Oh cool, The revenge of the off brands is out.
Soo funny
Please make more videos like this XD amazing !
The Color Saturation and image focus on the image (of your dad character) is definitely off. Camera's contrast is poor, and possibly excessive soft filter or something if its not the focus. (Funny video... but, hard to watch)
15 minutes early but there's already 500+ comments
Not first
BigHard was best ball is second
Been waiting for this series for a long time..... It's an excellent one 🤣🤣🤣 I hope that you continue all your good work in the future also for these banging videos.. From an Asian boy......😂
Why do I continue to watch your videos at work when I know full well I can't control myself.  🤣🤣  Great job!
Ball
woody been pumping iron, like goddamn
Bring that WiWi in PH and it will receive a biggest laugh.
These are the best of your videos, the Off brand ones
Woody on steroids 😂😂
King is back
when he said 'Party Games' it reminded me of a specific artist.  If you know what I mean😏
The thumbnail looks as if the French took over
Massive W

Laughing loudly. Out.
Hey, atleast you got a WiWi, all we got was WWii....wait

Hes gone mad so the slipper gose -------------------------> x
*(Take off my slipper)*  I will send you to Jorge!
“WI WI”  baguette….
That’s such a good ad transition
Beijing corn went out of business. Rebranded as China Numba Wan agricultural products
"cant wait to get a wish granted by my balls" lmao 💀
I would buy that shirt
I know I say this a lot, but YouTube is sooo much better since you started your channel. Thank you Steven 🤍
1:50 speechless

“You have Lightyear?” “We have Dark Days.” “You have Angry Birds?” “We have Furious Fowl.” “You have Captain Underpants?” “We have General Panties.” “You have Moana?” “We have Moan.” *“I will send you to Jesus.”*
478th
"Niice finally I take a.. WIWI!?!?"  Imagine if the pause wasn't there 🤣 I love these videos so much

The “I will send you to Jesus “ makes me laugh every freaking time😂
As a person who sells off brand things, I can confirm this happens on a daily basis
as of the time I'm watching this, your like count is 911
Boblox, mix between boba and locks
The tuna one was actuelly nice imo
*An incredible level of production quality has been achieved by Steven He. As you can see he is incredibly humourous in his natural habitat* Edit: No I aint a bot I am just really stupid
Steroid woody
This one feels really inspired. And I can actually relate as a gamer.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

“My bad guy exams”     “3 speed man”                 “Bobblox”                   “WI WI”
Not a real asian. Struggling  to take the slipper
I love the innuendos in the video Steven, they really made me giggle!
Hi
Hmm    S p e r m
I love watching this it make me laugh so much
The man says he will send you to Jesus and he is a man of his word.
Steven always drops amazing content. As Dj Khaled would say,.... "Another one!☝🏼"
Lol the Wi Wi
bro i got a partycity ad before this started
This sketch has wiwi and ball 😂
I lost it at Bad guy Exam 🤣
Star Wart! You should probably see a doctor 😂
What if you used reverse psychology and asked for the off brand item to get the og item
SPERM? I would toss a slipper too.
There is no video better than when he turns into a plank. Love it!
*”WHO WANTTU PLAI WIT A WIIII WIIIIIII?!?”*
Can’t believe I laughed so hard at BALL 😂
Never fails to amaze me
😂😊
Steroids woody 🤣 1:18 I love your videos ❤
"we got Sometime Strong" I'm dying lmao xDD
You got Optimus Prime?  We got Pessimist Subordinate.
Divorce Karen? I'm dead bruh💀
Hallo let us play boblox
Steven bothering his neighbors and "Cheers man" is so wholesome
There is a special place in hell for all of the laughter this video caused me. Hilarious man, hilarious. The ending though.... finally, it happened!
that neighbor part
Puma to Tuna 🤣🤣🤣
The "Supreme" was indeed something unexpected
I like it
waited long nf...xD
hey man lets play a quick game of WIWI
You have Frosted Flakes we have covered Lice 😅
Good ol slipper
Unironically "My Bad Guy Exams" sounds like a manga that would exists
These are just the perfect things i see every holiday in Turkey😂
I remember finding the channel when it was about to hit a million subs, now its closing in on 6M. Insane to think about. Steven you are killing it with the comedy and quality of stuff!
*...BALL!*
I M I N Y O U R W A L L S
Finally, he recommends a doctor...
lolmao
So funny
when you're early but don't know what to say:
I’m disappointed that there wasnt my favourite console for sale there - the nintendon’t shift / (any synonym for a lever or button)
SPERM
He finally did it.  He finally sent Off Brand Salesman to Jesus.
He has sent someone to Jesus
Ads are half the videos....
Stevens dad has even sent stevens upload consistency to jesus
Bro threw the slipper into next week💀
3k views in 7mins bro
0:34 😂 WiWi
"All Might" who is "Sometimes Strong" even makes sense lol
How do they get better every time? 😂
Those videos are always hilarious. I like how steven's dad lost it in the end with the shirt. Also, we need Steven He offbrand merch guys ... like Steven Bee (or Steven A+ ?)
I eat massive amounts of spaghetti
Love your videos 😍
I've been all over Asia, I'm betting these are all real products.
"Who plays with a WIWI?!" " *I have one of those myself actually-* " 💀💀🌚🌝
Next time, we need to see the dude selling the off brand stuff go to a store with only proper branding
_"Wow I can't wait to get a wish granted by my_   *_BAAAAALL."_*
It’s already a funny video! 😄😂😂
you got sims? we have karen marry and divorce
They took boblox to literal as a meme
favorite was "U M"
Okay, come on... Every man I know plays with their WiWi!!
1:13 bro since when did they release toy story 5
the absolute moment this dropped had to watch it. One of my favorite series on the channel.
The offbrands you come up with are super creative and funny! good job!👍
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!
STEROIDS WOODY LMAOOO
Beautiful asian video as always
The slipper throw though...
Uyes
You got Mary Jane ? we got Divorce Karen 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love you bro and your content makes me laugh when I need it most
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 i CAN’T!!!!
You always make me laugh. Thank you for your content and making millions laugh. Appreciate it.
“I cant wait to have my wish granted by my balls!”  Things that sound inappropriate in a bedroom.
Woody on steroids has potential.
Next on off brand series: You got Nord VPN? We got South UOM
I love the off brand videos
*sperm*.
When my mom says we have "__" at home
When i saw sperm i was waiting for  " i am not even gonna say that " but  u can never go wrong with slippers
So don't put your private information into offbrand websites.  Get LordVPN.
U should feature Aids (Adidas)
I was half expecting for Roblos
Who just casually buys a game console because there's a party.
Most video games are based on real life situations asian people go through...
I will send you to Jesus Warhammer version:I will send you to the emperor you heretic
“BALL” also buff woody will give me nightmares
Steven's Dad's outfit (orange shirt and grey blazer with random pants) is so classic at this point
1:51 I was not expecting that ☠️
great video.
Oooh my gooood
Reminds me of some dollar stores and flea markets.
Someone: *Gets a Wi Wi and play boblox*  Me: mmmmh smells like failure
And over half the short  video is an ad.
Steven He made my day when I am going through tough times in university. 😂
BoredVPN. Off-brand sponsor.
That nice sounded a bit American lol
Alternative title: How Asian Dad Sees A Brand
lol
294th
304
Next thing you know, they’ll have sliders and not slippers
instead of um it should have been dos
"you got fruit loops for the kids to eat?"  "yeah we got veggie hoops"
Well if everything is off brand then they should all be off shelves
"WIWI?!?" That one solidly killed me😂😂😂😂
Omg I love off brand series.  Your humors and those bad brands bland together. Please make more tho.
I’m sick right now and this just uploaded and that just cheered me up.
You make my day  Thank you steven
Boblox?More like bob the builder
These offbrand videos never disappoints
Always a good day when I see my Asian dad upload
1:29 "I will send you to Jesus" 😂😂
How do you come up with some of these?
Woody on steroids ha ha ,, 💪 🤠
Ayo Its November whats with the shirt
(Asian accent) Steven He so poor he can't afford slippers for thumbnail, he buy cheese.
Get your “within a hour” ticket here.
Hallo in the first second ... was that a German word 😅
I will send you to Jesus classic line
"TUNA"!!! Finally, the word which I told once for that company!
The Moment i Saw the video my reaction:What the haillllll! I was laughing so hast!
Every time you go "Hallo" I die!! :) lol
I’m laughing harder than I should’ve 🤣
He's looking more and more desperate
IT HAS ROBLOX BUT BOBLOX
I am an ancient method of sending people to Jesus which is still followed by asians  - The Slipper
Hi Steve!!! Love your vids!!! Thanks for making me laugh ❤️❤️❤️
I can't stop laughing 😂🤣🤣🤣 Thanks to Steven He for making our days wonderful and for making us wheeze badly 🤣🤣
I don’t think that anybody would want to buy and take a WiWi.  😐
My favourite series. I particularly liked the one of superheroes. Can you please make one of them again???? Pleaaaaasssseeeeee?????  For the sake of all asain heritage  Like if anybody else also likes this series
“They should probably see a doctor” Who is they?
I will send you to ✝️ 😆
Legend says the dude still dint get up from the slipper throw
Sperm😂😂😂💀
Love from Germany
I can’t help but just laugh at the amount of off branded-ness that is happening here lmfao
0:33 No one, at least not this month
They knew what they were doing when they made stuff like Sperm and WiWi, like what were they doing? playing with theirs when they thought of the name?
