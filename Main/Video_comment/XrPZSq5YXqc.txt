Made me buy a PS5. Ich war hier
My fav ps5 game
This ability wheel with symboite colour looked much better
Every once in a while I come back to this in order to relieve the insane hype I had prior to its release. Awesome game, but sadly, no DLC's whatsoever dampened the overall experience. Ich war hier
Please Marvel bring this game on Android phone please😢😢😢😢
Here after the new wolverine trailer
Yea even the models ripped off from web of shadows nothing original here Activision are the true super hero masters
Marvel Entertainment terrible guy’s terrible  this game PS4 aswell Excuviles PS5
2028   Back
This feels good!
2:22
Marvel entertainment videos are sooooo good
Finally after Over a year I get to play this masterpiece (mostly spoiler free) in 2 hours
Revisiting this is so nostalgic already. My reaction to this was absolutely insane I was so excited. So like, where that DLC?
Just freakin love the theme of kraven. Still wish he was alive...
a year ago already.. wow
Bro how did Troyoboyo17 called it???💀💀💀
Already nostalgic 🌠
The world was shook when the famous words were said "you have no idea"
One year since this legendary masterpiece of a gameplay reveal came out.
I can not believe it has almost been a whole year since the game came out. One of my favorite games that I have ever played. Thank you Insomniac and Marvel for making this happen.
It’s not literally a year from the date but it’s a year since the day (Wednesday)
g
It’s almost been a year already that is crazy
It just doesn't hit the same now that the game is out. I miss how excited I was
Çox gözəldi izləməyə dəyər👍👍👍👍
PC???????????
Superdi elebil canlidi

I Love This game❤
The scenes are different in the official game play
GOTY 2023
Anyone from 2036 here?
Whos here in 2024?
3:32
Best Marvel game ever and it released on my birthday so great birthday gift too
Déjà 8mois que ce trailer est sortie et que je pense que quand je l’avais vu pour la première fois il était sortit y’a 7min et qu’il fallait attendre 4mois pour sa sortie
That dude at the start did not deserve that Karevens brutal
الخيال العلمي والحركة والتشويق مثل سابقيه من سلسلة سبايدرمان  انصح بالمشاهدة
واااو ابطال مميزون وفيلم مميز حقا
How about that game of the year tho
I lowkey wish they kept the dialogue and the suit transformation when it released it was so clean
Best version of spider man🥳🗿🍷🔥
لقد إندمجة فيه كتيرا هدا جميل ويدعو للدهشة
حقا انه لفلم اكثر من رائع ارجو من الجميع مشاهدته
The best film in the world it was so beautiful
Yooo very good
Yooo very good
Bonne film 👍🏻
متابعة شيقة مع هذا الفيلم
i finally finished spider-man (with DLCs) and spider-man: miles morales. i am so hyped to play spider-man 2 rlly soon, i am finally all caught up
I can’t wait to watch this movie
Just amazing ,pete is not only aggressive
that was fire!; con't to play!!
Marvel's Spider-Man 2018 is a MASTERPIECE! Miles Morales is a POWERHOUSE, now imagine this one OH LORDY!
Nice like 👍
😊😊😊
Love
Good movies I like is joob bravo
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Everything is beautiful in these movies
Nice film
My friend: How racist are you?  Me: 2:28
I WANT TO PLAY IT SO BAD!!!!
çok etklileyici görünüyor. bir ance izlemek için sabırsızlanıyorum.
some of those things don't even make sense, he'd be able to let something explode near those and they wouldn't notice
3:08 HOW DO YOU DO THAT 😭
4:41
11:54
Dear Marvel, I want this opportunity for Spider-Man 2 on ps4 but released on ps5 why?  There are people who have a ps4 but no ps5. Please make Spider-Man 2 on ps4 please!!!
Game Of The Year 🗣️🎙️
Back after game came out and it exceeded my expectations
Can’t wait for this to be nostalgic
Under the mask is Raiden from Mortal Kombat
Looking back at this brings memories of waiting
Ohh
2:31
What a way to drop the freakin ball. Worse than Velus Jones Jr.
anyone know the name of the sound track at 3:26?
As a pc player i am crying 😢
Somebody know how to perform this  3:05 ?
It’s refreshing to see this dialog a little different from the dialog in game. But anyways, this game is by far the best spiderman game of all time
the trailer did a better job than in the game 2:25
3:45 The slingshot was really sped up here. I have updated the traversen Speed to the max, but I never reached speed like this
c'est  trop bien  les Marvel c'est incroyable
le  jeu vidéo  spiders man  2 et incroyable
Who's here nov 1st after playing it already? got plat in 4days
I beat and platinum the game and i saw some changes in the scene the part where peter say "we dont have much time move" that part i wanted to see that one but this is Game of the year 100%
I am do glad i didn't watch this trailer until after I beat the game. Pretty much everything nee was shown off in the trailer plus pretty much the whole mission
So I bought a PS4 to finally play Spiderman PS4 ( I didn’t buy a PS5 because I didn’t have the money). Just to find out that this game is a PS5 exclusive. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Just saw this in the game yesterday. OH MY GOD
can you switch from the red suit to the symbiote suit without going into the menu? like how it did when peter jumped out of the basement
After playing through this game, it's actually insane how good it is. You thought you were close to finishing & it would give you so much more.   And venom is just insane🥲😭
“I have an idea” Gaslighting Spider-Man: 2:25
2:26
Rewatching this to see the differences between this one and the actual game and there’s quite a few! Kept me on my toes though when I actually played.
Goty
This looks awesome, wish they did a multiplayer story mode you and a friend can play Spiderman and Miles together.
I love the theme song with Miles makes a slingshot. Wonder what’s the name of this music…
That kick move at 3:11 did they remove it for the full game?
Hey uhhhh… what happened to double Take down??
Here from the future when the game reveals. I never watched this because I didn't want to be spoiled and man the "so do I" made me soil myself
Did anyone manage to do this move at 3:11?
My Opinion: First of all, with all due respect, but I didn't like these things and this this needs to improve:  1. Harry Osborn as Venom?  he was always a green goblin or the son of a green goblin, he was always like that  2. Why have 2 spider mens fighting if you can't even play with 2 local players? It doesn't hurt that you put a 1!  local game with 2 players, they only want to separate people with these online games  3. The textures of the black suit are not realistic for me, I could see low quality bit lines even at the maximum graphics, as if there was something solid, I thought it was too solid, there could have been more gloss blocking the solid  4. Why would Spider-Man need wings???  he has the webs!!  In short:  There are a lot of people in the film music industry wanting to change the normality of stories, changing skin color causing racism, creating discord, fights, separations, sadness, so that we don't turn an army against them, take away conventional usage, the natural order of things, putting meaningless things to us fans who know what they are like in our comic books, which have nothing to do with these stories created by the imagination of these guys from the ruling elite. I'm sure there are many people who have the same opinion as me.
3:10 how can I do that animation against the wall? I’m playing the game rn and I haven’t gotten that animation and yes I’m already in black suit
I came back to this trailer after the intro and noticed they pulled an MCU and changed who shows up on Kraven's pad, I will not say who is supposed to show up to support those that are trying to avoid spoilers
Watching this after finishing game feels so nostalgic
I was going to play it until I heard the woke language. I'm out.
What percentage of the game is this? Like the start at the vid like 2:23
Just did that fight at Connor’s house, it was NOT that quick this dude was playing on goo goo gaga baby wawa mode wth
Who is here after playing the mission and experiencing the changes made?
this mission is very different in the release version less guys at Connors Miles starts on a roof Ganke doesn't hijack a drone from the fish market the scene of miles gsttung ti the fish market is different Chain Lightning and Thunder Burst have different icons less enemies in the Fish Marker the garage segment is really diffferent with crawling through pipes and stuff theres an explosion in the garage Miles doesn't find the drone probably more as well
Apparently Insomniac lied to us about this 1 simple combat move where you Hit a guy with faster kicking while the guy is next to the wall
I just played this mission in the game and it’s done so much better in the game
Actually playing it felt amazing
The number of main enemies was very few, they were not among the old villains, Electric Man, Shocker Rino, I hope you make Spiderman 3, we are waiting for 2028 PS6 coming dlc carnage.
They really did a good job of not showing too much here now that I'm halfway done the game I'm noticing that the first kraven scene is a cut from another scene in the game which is nice as they showed the entire start for miles and I found that a bit boring as it took away from my first time playing, great job insomniac
Watching this as I’m done with spider man 2 lol noticed they changed the dialogue lol
First party devs for Sony are some of the best in the world. Never doubted insomniac 😍
I tried to do everything in this trailer the same way when I played the game
Bro where’s my symbyiote finishers? Completed the whole story to not even see them smh
is the graphic in a game same like in a this gameplay?
Well. This aged finely
I can’t figure out how to do that downward punch move Peter does when he bounces the Hunter off the ground with the punch. Not sure if it’s tied to a skill
Finally they’re starting to release games exclusively for the ps5. I’m sick of developers hindering their games by catering to people who didn’t upgrade. The ps5 released 3 years ago; if you don’t have it by now, too bad.
5:00 Miguel moment
What mission is this
One of the most exciting gameplay reveal trailers I've seen in a long while. The web slinging looks incredibly better than the first game.
After so long of waiting we finally have it!! I'll see you in a long time where we come to remember this gem of a game 🕷️
TOMORROW BROTHERS TOMORROW
"He's gonna wish he never came to new york!" Still sends shivers down my spine.  30 hours till launch🎉🥳
Man, my only wish is for Peter to have said "so do WE" instead of "I"
BE GREATHER TOGETHER MY JOURNEY END, MARVEL SPIDER MAN 2 LAUNCH FRIDAY
My goodness, games these days sure are wild.
The music in that intro had major Destiny 2 vibes lol
So the graphical downgrade at release is really noticeable...ugh...
It's gonna be the ultimate spiderman game and a great action game.
From Ben 10 to Sasuke Uchiha
Every ps5 owner need to buy this. We need some carnage! Maybe some moon knight DLC. Hope they plan on supporting this game while they are making Wolverine!
who all are rewatching it before the game drops this week???
It is ps4 or not
So unrealistic. Where are all the poor blacks shooting eachother? If there is a black superhero he should go where he is needed. Where his own kind slaughter the young and pedal drugs like ratsm
Kraven dies
Is it multi player? Bit of a misleading tag if it’s not.
Watching this one last time, amping the hype for me.
Okay. Six days till launch. I think this is the first ten minutes of the game personally. Then after Peter goes off to grab Lizard, we cut to black and it goes 3 months previous perhaps.
6 DAYS LEFT MY JOURNEY IS ENDING
Did anyone else hear the woman say watch out for his new power. Maybe we will see the origin story of how miles gain blue bio electricity. I’m still leaning towards he got it from the previous game when he stopped roxxon
There is no way im not getting this game!!
1 week
This game play demo is so cool how do you use the web wings
you have no idea
Totally hawkeye at 7:34
If this Game come on Xbox i would buy it
It’s been 4 months since this came out. I still come and watch it once every 2 days. only 8 days left. we’re getting closer and closer by the minute
Good to see Yuri adding in elements of Sasuke into Spider Man.
The wait is almost over boys, we're in the homestrech now, 10 days left!
He’s gonna wish he never came to New York!
Craven wants a hunt? I’ll give him one he’ll never forget!
Leave conners alone!
This lizard hunt ends now!
You have no idea
For me I get it 2 hrs before release day🫡 so 10 days for me
Game of the year
I hope they give us a choice of who to play as when the two of them actually do fight. Because i want to know what it would be like to fight Miles or Peter.
I have always wondered: Shouldn't Peter's spider-sense have tingled when Miles warned him about Kraven's gunship had denfenses the moment it was about to shoot him? Or did his anger make him ignore it or something like that? Otherwise, it looks cool and I'm excited to see the game.
I cannot believe how good the graphics are and fps! The story looks so good, when I get my hands on it I will not drop it till I 100%
Marvel's Spider-Man 2018 is a MASTERPIECE! Miles Morales is a POWERHOUSE , now imagine this one OH LORDY! 🕷️🕸️
Why spiderman eyes change in 11:55 min
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 launches in 13 days exclusively on PlayStation 5.  Pre-load begins 6 days from today.
Peter went from Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man to Sasuke real quick
That looks super fun!  It would have been cool if they gave player a choice of which spider to choose each time they're both fighting the same scene.  That would a perfect reason for game replayability. But they didn't implement this.  That sucks, but gameplay still looks awesome.
Miles did the thing Spider-Man 2099 did to miles in Spider-Man across the spider verse
15 DAYS FOR MARVEL SPIDER MAN 2
When kraven broke that guys neck my neck started hurting
Man being able to use miles and Peter  this game will be amazing 😎😎
11:54 "Nah,resume"
5:03  Bro learned with Miguel
I just realized how cool the black suit is cause towards the end when Peter said he got away from us I don't think he ment him and miles.
I’m so exited bruhh
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 launches in 16 days exclusively on PlayStation 5.  Pre-load begins 9 days from today.

Psalms 109:24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.

Find  me some fish
He gonna wish he never came to New York
Creighton wants to hunt I’ll give him never forget
I’m on the miles and peter side now and my one of the best ps 5 games is spider man miles morales 🎉🕷️🕸️⚡️
Does anyone know why miles bioelectricity is blue now instead of orange or yellow whatever?
18 DAYS FOR MARVEL SPIDER MAN 2  LAUNCH
I bought a ps5 just for this game
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Launches This Month On PlayStation 5!
It's all cool but the wing suit is silly. Mf out there flying through the city like he's Superman. Even flying through rings 😂
I don’t think this game will have the necessary rating for it, but there is a lot of potential to dig deeper into Spidey‘s own darker side. We have seen different Spider Men struggle with rage and losing their control, this game could be the perfect opening to explore that part of him deeper and more extensively than usual. How Venom‘s presence, words and thoughts slowly begin to weaken Peter’s own mental stability and he starts losing control more and more often, showcased most during combat, where his attacks become more aggressive, powerful and unhinged the longer you‘re into the game.   Venom is giving Peter powers beyond anything he knows, and it is easy to get lost in the pursuit of such power. It could make for a very interesting piece of story. The more Peter taps into that power, the more efficient his ability to protect innocents will become, because he can easily take on very powerful foes. So, with good intentions at heart (to be able to protect even more people at once), Spidey taps into that power more often, compromising to „only use it for good“. And the more he taps into Venom‘s powers, the more he is letting the Symbiote in, giving him the opportunity to gain control. And eventually, it will lead back to how everything started. With great power comes great responsibility.
Play station I Love your profile and can you add Spider-Man two
Pls please  add spider-man 2 to ps4 I am your no1 fan and I would  appreciate it very much
Saving bad guys from other bad guys while being attacked by both bad guys
Is it just me or does Peter act more like Arkham Batman when he’s got the black suit. He goes from traditional Spider-Man to a mission focused obligated heavy lifter with little tolerance for messing around. For example batman in arkham knight, Batman insists on working alone to stop scarecrow and the arkham knight. Whenever Robin tries to help him,Batman shuts him down to keep working on the joker cure and when they do work together batman criticizes him for making any mistakes. When nightwing offers to help,Batman insists on working alone comes off as ungrateful when he does help, same thing with catwoman during the riddler boss fight. Here peters doing the same to a lesser extent,he only brings miles in when he had no choice and is scolds miles when he makes a mistake and accidentally gets civilians caught in the crossfire (something peters done before).  And when miles offers to help peter keep chasing lizard peter shuts him down and insists on working alone.
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 pre-load begins in 2 weeks.   Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 launches in 3 weeks.
I would've been bummed out if Peter was being mean to Miles. I like their relationship, the kinda mentor/student friendship. Dismissive and rude, yeah, that's personality and character evolution, because of the symbiote. But not just mean to the lad.
peter really went from merciful to a full aggression machine and it’s crazy 🫠
Diverse miles vs white Spider-Man, should have seen this coming “miles” away.
I just noticed that at the end before Peter launched the drone at the helicopter, you could see that Miles was calling both Ganke and Peter at the same time. Some kind of group call or something

I wish this was multiplayer sooo BAD!
Love that they made the game like Spider-Man 3 except with Miles. Toby Maguire is still the best Spider-Man tbh.
24 days for spider man 2
This game looks amazing but it's not fare for people who have a ps4 😡

I’m wondering how Pete got himself chained in a l cellar 2:22
4 WEEKS TO GO
Kraven reminds me of farcry primal
I hope I get to see a spider woman game with Spider Girl and Black Cat #1 just like Spider Man 2.  Well my man is back with a new Electric Adventure and he's not alone.  now I have 2 Spider Man at once but each plays a important role  in the story and game play.  I'm ready to see which one becomes my favorite or my new #1.  It's Spider Man 2 The Exclusive only to the PS5 .  I feel Special .

Only if shocker was confirmed in this game: We need to reenact that “SHOOOOOCKER” episode 😂😂😂😂
DUDE.... THIS JUST HITS HARDER AFTER THYE EXPANSION AND SUIT TRAILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why is there a black Spider-Man? I'm not talking about Venom Spider-Man. I mean Afro-Spider-Man. Peter Parker is Spider-Man, not the other boy. They should have made him an entirely different superhero, like Robin or Nightwing or something.
YO spider venom is back baby🕷
It's been 10 years we've been waiting for a new spider man 🕷game in PS4 and PS5 console can't wait for October too play the game 😂
I love spider man games ❤❤.
This game needs to be on gamepass
Why do I feel like there will be a final battle between miles and peter
So A few months ago I tried getting a ps5 SOLEY for this game  (Well this and a few other games..) but i failed.   Im so happy i managed to get a ps5, pre ordered the game instantlym
So, it's a small detail and i don't know if anyone has caught it but, the web sound is also different from the last two games and betweens miles and peter.
Mann this is going to be a freaking cool game and im ready for it 🔥🔥waiting for the spiderman 2 game few days left
I can’t tell if the web wings are cool or cringey.
36 days
I love how we could play Peter and Miles, but I wonder the names go. Peter can still be called “Spider-Man” and Miles can be called “Kid-Arachnid?”
Spider man on top💯🔥
*PS5 only...such bulls**t.* 🙄😒
I like how the suit looks low quality and then it like resets making it look all smooth
nahhhhh waiting another month is crazy
People who got the limited edition ps5 version and pre ordered the collecters edition 👇

Top d+ não vejo a hora de jogar ...
I just love the “thwip” sound for Miles
Please don't do to many unnecessary and repetitive optional missions, I always want to play 100 % and Spiderman Remastered really was a drag...
i hope that this game comes also to ps4.
If there isn't 2 player co op campaign I'm not buying
Insomniac can pull off a superman  game by looking at the gliding of morales.😀

Android device Ke Liye Bhi Banao Aise Game 🙏🙏😔😔
The wing suit
this game looks amazing, i am a bit dissapointed with the water
was it that hard to add some momentum-pendulum type to swinging ?
this is not spider-man.

This game looks better then real life
12:10
Will miss pete's humour in this one😢
This looks so good can’t wait
This is going to be the best Spiderman game of all time.
Miles : He's got big teeth.. Peter : So do I...
"Can't let them find Connors, or hes done for." Yup, Kraven would become a snack just like his wife was.

Is this the very beginning of the game or is this already a bit further on the story? The game starts and Peter randomly has the black suit already with no explanation where it came from?
I love it ❤
Can't wait to watch Peter breaking people's bones.
Jesús
🎉
Peter is still standing straight while swinging, unlike miles who immediately dives because of the falling momentum.

3:26 god i love this theme please release it!!!
I have a feeling harry will die
The part where miles is in the dark torn apart garage looking for lizard reminds me of the Batman Arkham knight season of infamy DLC you are tracking down killer croc through a dark torn apart airship just waiting for a jumpscare with all that being said the season of infamy dlc was amazing so if this is giving me the same immersion I have no doubt this will be amazing too

THEY BETTEE KEEP THAT SPIDERVERSE SUIT ON DECK TOO 🗣🗣
🗣🗣 THIS GAME IS NOT RATED E!!!
Wojohhh this is very good
The level of detail in Pete's symbiote suit is amazing. The eyes even look fleshy, since it's the symbiote covering Pete and not a typical suit.
Grandissimo gioco , già ho fatto il pre-order non vedo l'ora che mi arrivi così lo porterò subito sul mio canale YouTube in Live

Everybody please read this can you please release Spider-Man two now because no one can’t wait for the game to release. There is also going to be a Spider-Man three for 2024
49 days
I wonder how long the campaign will be. Miles Morales was really short :(
He GLIDES!?!
Venom is my favorite Anti hero in the Marvel universe
I can wait for this game
I dont know why I hate the story mode , in story mode there is less of game play and more of the movie and graphics
I'm so so happy when this  happens 😊😊😊😊😊😊

kinda disappointed he doesn't say "so do we" to "he has big teeth" like cmon what a missed opportunity
This is amazing!! I hope they bring back the original spiderman  2099 suit and Sam raimi suit!!
Tell the truth, you came here more than once did ya?
Bro, this is on its way to becoming game of the year
Real talk Can anyone stop coming back to this?? Cause I can't 🤣🤣

Dude, so excited 😆
3:51 its so cool how the web wings work and the fast motion you will get from them like going mock 10 then into the web wings to eather go slower or glide in the air like a peice of butter glideing across a hot pan
Praying we get this on PC too. 😭I need to play it sooooo bad.
I kinda wish Miles would get his own hero name. It's gotta be confusing when they're working together and both are named spider man.
There’s a double perch takedown

dang i can’t wait for berleezy to play this game
To those disappointed by the graphics, so watch R&C Rift Apart gameplay and then go PLAY it. This game does look a little rough due to YouRube rendering, but if it’s anything like Insomniac’s last PS5 exclusive where they didn’t have to compensate for last gen, it’s going to be one of the best looking games ever.

CAN WE PLEASE GET AN OPEN WORLD HULK GAME ?????
new you an save the world for you if you have game. for your life could expect to invade others life expectancy
Not to be too negative but I am afraid the glider will be too good and will overtake swinging most of the time. Not the direction i was hoping for but let's see when it comes out
I can’t wait to be purposely more brutal and aggressive towards enemies and blame it all on the symbiote suit 😎
Some may say his symbiote voice is over the top, but I love it. It reminds me a lot with the 90's animated series.
all those new extra abilitys r looking fire
I'm starting to get the superhero fatigue, but this game looks amazing

11:33 when Spiderman (venom suit) throws the person he just saved out of frustration that he had to save him instead of chasing Connors shows how the symbiote has taken over pete. Even miles was like tf why'd he throw the poor guy
I think Miles has blue lightning because he absorbs the roxon reactor
62 days
“kraven wants a hunt? i’ll give him one he’ll never forget” gives me chills every time
This is literally a game and movie in one so excited! XD
The small detail of peter being rough with the civilian he saves speaks volumes. Amped for this game!!
Seria possivel trazer a Black Cat pra esse jogo e no proximo filme do spider-man?
This hits different knowing miles has dreads under that mask.....
This game looks amazing. I can’t wait to play this game when it comes out October 20, 2023 with stunning graphics and stunning game mechanics who else is excited for this game let me know❤❤❤
I'm loving how sick Miles music is when web slinging ❤
I hope there might be more spiderverse suits?

If Marvel’s Spider-Man 3 would come in 2028 with Peter and miles again the villains are green goblin mysterio sandman
When games have better graphics than Marvel movies
Game's not even out yet but I can tell this one's gonna be better than the first one and spider-man miles morales 🤩
I am super excited for the webline and. The double stealth takedown feature!
Miles as goku 5:03
The graphics amazing, the story we will see how it plays out because will venom be eddie brock or harry? Is just weird, Harry is the Green goblins son, so his dad not green goblin here just some weird rich politician? This story is weird weird

This comes out on my birthday im so excited!
6:51 miles doesn't sound too surprised by the symbiote, so it doesn't seem like it's his first time seeing it, but he says "new threads" which means the symbiote costume changed since the last time he saw it, so we might be getting a spectacular spiderman type suit that changes over time
Sasuke is that you?
Pete and mile gonna be fight intense
This game is the only reason I'm choosing PS5 over Xbox Series X.

Cool, when i have the money for a PS5, i won't have time to play Video games anymore, cause it would take me up to 15 months to have the money to buy one. The game would probably also have a PC port at that point, so I also would'nt have time to play video games anymore.. GREAT!
Just realized miles can do Miguel's choke slam
Imagine this is movie, LOL 😆

I really get the feeling that somehow Lizard is going to influence the Venom symbiote becoming full Venom after it leaves Peter. I feel like Insomniac wants to have a story reason that Venom has such beast like features when its off of Spider-Man, and since they are also pushing Lizard so much in the promo I feel like that explains it. The teeth, the tongue, the claws, the insatiable hunger, these are all characteristics that Lizard already has and I feel the symbiote will either bond with it first or Dr. Conners will somehow infuse his blood into it or something (which would make a lot of sense considering Conners wanted the healing powers of a lizard, and Osbourne may have persuaded him to use that same logic on the symbiote in order to help Harry) I don’t think Lizard himself is Venom, but I think Lizards DNA somehow plays into Venom becoming the beast he is
Ganke yelling as the Spider-Men threw his drone at the gunship is so hilarious. He was trying to the give the drone his personality to make the move more meaningful and stylish. 👍🏼
Yo Cant Wait For It...😊
By the way does anti venom appear in this game?
2:26 entry of spider man
Peter without a symbiote slams Miles But with symbiote Peter is not using his great IQ and BIQ

Already waiting
Please release it on pc also.....
73 days
WTF? Peter seems way younger than in the first game. I actually liked the feeling of playing as an adult and experienced spidey.  Not vibing with this one, honestly.
This is probably obvious to everyone, but after watching this a thousand times: I just noticed you can see Peter Swinging alongside miles from 7:37 onwards if you try to follow him on screen
wait did miles just do a kamehameha 4:59
74 days
Yo what’s up with miles venom color. At first it was blue but then it looked kind of red. It used to be yellow. Wtf
im so hyped
Fricken awesome BUT I did notice Peter has the exact same swing animations.
I don't know what is this A movie or a game?  It's so good!

Looks insane in the best way possible. Really hoping we dont have to wait long for PC version.
I like how his webs are black when he is swinging.
5:07 great miles has the kamehameha
Dude you know how you can run up walls? I think That would look really cool in a remastered Hulk game that i played. I hope some day I'll Play one
something i don’t get is wasn’t kraven on the helicopter thingy when it crashed down?

One thing im worried about is that the wingsuit sort of makes swinging useless
I would love to play this, too bad their locking it to the ps5
Spiderman 1: 9/10 Spiderman Miles morales: 7/10 (game is way too short to justify 60 bucks price) Spiderman 2: Potentially 9.5/10 judging by the trailer only
The symbiote has bonded with Harry as venom how cool is that

I love the game and all of its glory, but if I don’t fight Peter Parker at the end of the game as miles I don’t want it
Can’t wait for this to drop
I mean how pete is gonna fight with miles tho?... Miles have venom  punch.
This game looks incredible. There are so many new moves and gadgets and little improvements. Cannot wait.

Even at his worst Peter is still trying to do the right thing.
I can't wait for the Venom boss fight. Especially since Peter can't detect Venom after being bonded to it for so long. He uses it to gain an advantage over his enemies and it will make the boss battle extra tricky.

why does the water look so bad? this is ps5 only right?
The swinging still looks too forgiving. Not letting you fail means you have less control, but in a game that has to be as accessible as this one i understand why it's not like spiderman 2004. At least it's faster now that they can stream the city in fast enough to keep up with you, it was pretty slow in the first game.
4:02 something i just noticed here is that the cutscene starts with him flying on the wingsuit instead of swinging. Does this mean that every cutscene has 2 beginnings depending on whether  you're swinging or gliding?
Why Is Angelo Bronte here?

Peter has been living in mays house for 9 months now but i wonder if he still feels weird about it, considering he is renovating a sink in the guest room bathroom i would say that he  is mostly over it but it could still affect him even a year and 11 months after the devils breath outbreak.
I loved both of these games on pc and I am almost debating buying a ps5 JUST for this bc it looks so amazing
9:18 I like the detail of the symbiote making Peter more reckless.
I wonder if they are going to do a thing in the story where people confuse the two spider-men, seeing as both have black suits.
Venom suit is the best spider man suit the i like
Boozer survived the apocalypse to hunt spiderman
To be honest the Spider-Man venom is rushed

OH NAH I NEED THIS GAME
A Spider-Man game with Peter and Miles, Black Cat, Kraven, Venom, AND Quick Time Events? Yeah I'm getting the Spider-Man 2 limited edition PS5 just to play this.  Edit: I might skip Spider-Man Remastered and Miles Morales and just play this first 😂
See u in 10 yrs bye bye
Imagine for DLC or later down the line of updates, they add an online option to play with a friend, with one being miles and the other Peter, where both can free roam where they want, and do crimes together, they could even take it farther where both can play the campaign together. Peter has his missions he unlocks after the other does theirs and for some missions they’re together, and with a mission like this where you switch to miles, instead of the player playing Peter spectates, he swings like kinda off camera, now I think this would be dope as hell. (Sorry to ramble)

Did anyone else hear Peter growl after he said “you have no idea” or am I trippin 🤷🏾‍♂️
O jogo paresce estar perfeito, mais se tivesse o duende verde mn 🤯🤯

This game looks absolutely spectacular. I hope spider man does the tobey dance when hes venomized at some point
The way he threw the guy on the ground though
Even the blue venom is referencing to the end of the miles morales game insane!
CANT WAIT!
Please l need this game in  XBOX 😢
What is everyone’s predictions of where this is in the game?I think maybe a third of the way through.
Just finished the miles morales. so excited to play this.
I want to be able to straight up kill people as Venom
That voice crack at Alley-Oop had me rolling on floor
3:44 we don't have much time, MOVE!!
I can see Insomniac pulling off a Prototype game maybe prototype 3. Especially Pete's tendrils animation perfect for Alex Mercer's abilities. Wish they could revive the prototype series.
I got a feeling symbiote peter is going beat the bricks out of kraven with that aggression
87 days
3:10 That execution was brutal😭 I bet every rib in that man’s body was just in pieces and the shards punctured his lungs
"That all you got?"  I guess we can rest easy knowing there's a Bully Maguire quote in this game.
The Guy In The First Scene Casually Tasting Someone Blood And Pulling Out a Valorant Knife xD
5:02 looks like miles took notes
Love it bro
Already know this gonna be game of the year
🔥🔥🔥
Something I don’t think is being talked about is how awesome the haptics are going to be with this game. In ratchet and clank every gun genuinely had an effect that blew my mind when using it. While also when running through different environments and jumping it was really crazy so now to see all the w swinging and fighting on top of I bet the symbiote is going to have a cool effect and then miles lightning will also.
cool spider
Peter going from vitriolically defending Connors from Kraven's guys to darkly declaring "he's mine..." at the end is a perfect illustration of how the symbiote affects him mentally.  This game is going to be great
i cant wait for this game
I'm so annoyed I don't have a ps5
Insomniac needs to keep making spiderman games forever
Me: Theres no way the movement could possible get any cooler   Insomniac: Hold my beer

And Shocker is no where to be seen in this game I predict.  He's not coming back there until next game.
Already loved the first one,but the symbiote story line has been my favorite for 30 years and they are actually doing it right!.    It's not just a suit it's a personality and a boost in his strength and abilities.
not gonna cap, gonna play all the previous ones before this........................AND GONNA ENSURE NOBODY BOTHERS ME ON IT
The game looks great, but am I the only one who thinks the venom suit looks bad?
I hope they have a demo
If you need a play tester I would love to help and I'll do it for free
in 3:35 when pete is like "i'm not gonna make it in time!" and he calls miles and the game switches to miles! AND HIS MUSIC STARTS PLAYING! IT Sounds So GOOD! I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS GAME TO DROP!
My big guess is that this is the BIG action point of the game. I’m sure there will be others but I think most of insomniac’s effort went into THIS mission. Remember the gameplay trailer’s for the first two games. The helicopter chase and the bridge battle. Both of those were the points in the game where you did crazy stunts and BIG moments. You never did anything that crazy again in either game. I think this will be similar
Okay, it's looking like the symbiote is an extraterrestrial that Norman finds and probably utilizes it for characteristics it has that he believes could cure Harry. I'm cool with that. Venom doesn't have to be Eddie Brock. Make him whoever you want, just keep the symbiote *alien.* The whole "bio-experiment gone wrong" origin from the Ultimate universe was always so cliche'd and so lame to me.
Pete looks like the incarnation of violence. I LOVE IT I also love the animation of those that take the hits.
TASK MASTER!!

This looks so sick!!! ONLY note is I’m not sure I love the more guerrilla style camera during combat and traversal, if everyone else likes it I’ll gladly shut up!
On the "super-tech" PS5, the walls are not drawn beyond 10 meters, but the houses are like from the game Spiderman 2.   2:50 , 3:18 , 8:14 (!)
On the "super-technological" PS5, walls are not drawn further than 10 meters, and houses are like from the game Spiderman 2
Miles is making the inner 4 year old in me love spiderman again.
Kraven the Hunter...! 🦁
All right, the hype is real.
I can just imagine Ganke screaming in his room at his desk and his parents going, “wtf?!?” 😂 @11:15
Peter/Miles - cool I like this, it's familiar. MJ - Full-blown Caitlyn Jenner.
they gotta add a normal walking animation instead of that stealth walk, it looks so unnatural and weird. it's been my only issue of the past 2 games 😂😂
just here to leave a comment
Wait a minute... I was playing the first game and I noticed in one of Peter's bags that you have to find there's a vial with Connors's blood and Peter said that he used it for finding a cure, he cured him but also said that Connors died! So how's it possible that he's alive and still turns into a lizard??
he's gonna wish he never came to new york 😎 3:03
11:36 - I think Peter means from him and the symbiote. After all it's always "we".
Annnnnd it is for PlayStation only... iam happy cod will be exklusive for XBOX unless Sony releases their exklusives for xbox also
I will be disappointed if this game doesn’t see the epic comeback tour of Spider-cop
I wish this was on ps4!
90 DAYS ALERT!!!!!! 90 DAYS
I can’t believe this is actual gameplay. You can’t convince me that you can do all these awesome moves in the game
Can’t wait for that miles vs Pete 1v1💀
Ganke's battlecry there at the end is just my favorite.
This has potential for Game of the Year
dude please come to croatia im your biggest fan
Is this going to come out on the PS4?
Ooooooo🎉
Wow seems like a big improvement thanks to all of these new abilities and gadgets, both especially in stealth but also in combat
One of the most game ever
When I said Connor that ring the bell because at the end of miles morales In the post credit scene there is a guy name Cult Connor. My guess is that that’s the guy that helped Herry live And in the game at the beginning I think this is where this will take place is a Henry can’t walk or speak so we have to get Connor back from Kraven the Hunter because Henry is the one with the Symbiote
91 days lets go
Seeing how Shocker is in the first game, ill be very disappointed if we don't get hyper aggressive Pete chasing after him screaming like a mad man  "YOU CANT RUN AWAY FROM MEEEE, I WILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH, SHOCKKERRERRRRR"
So harry is venom
The only way they can get fans to even care about Miles is to force you to play him.
This is the kind of Kraven I’m talking about, a VILLAIN. Not a heroic Kraven with the upcoming movie.
Here before the game comes out hello future people answer this question did they make another spiderman game?
Nice man it’s looking good as hell I’m glad to be here for it
PLS PUT IT ON  PS4
I CANT WAIT OMG
Do you know how cool it be if miles also got symbiote suit
2:57  Love that line. Shows how much the suit has changed Peter.
10/20 can't come soon enough.
This is the best graphics ever
This is the only scene where we see the venom power from spider man miles morales. 11:08
Since when did miles have 2 venom power? In the game he gets 3.
“He got away from us.”  I’ve got a feeling that Peter wasn’t referring to Miles…
Daym
miles gana fight peter in that i just know it
92 days😊
hoping there are more dodging animations
bu sefer de hele bi türkçe gelmesin var yaaa

Excited for this game !
May have to buy a ps5 just for this and wolverine
Fire
This game is gonna be Soo cool they finally gave the lizard the size and look he deserves😮 can't wait to play
The Lizard is super fast huh ._.;
You know what I would love to see make an appearance in this game? Either Daredevil, or the Punisher... But MOSTLY the Punisher.
Should go just made this a venom game
PlayStation I’m switch to ps5 to the xbox bro because this game don’t come and august me and going to have some problems
Pov: u came to see hate comments
remember me when Spiderman 2 is 5 years old.
Why does miles have different venom color
hello marvel could you make marvel spider man 1 and 2 /miles morales available for xbox one
I’m so glad prowlers back

Kraven the Cunter?>
Please change the bio electricity to orange or red whatever the original is
See ya buddy lucki 😂
I really hope there is an option to turn into Venom from the 2018 Movie, but you can still use webs
Maybe i wont sell my ps5
You can definitely forshadow that miles morales and Peter Parker are going to have an epic brawl
I can see the build up for a Spider man vs Spider man fight coming
Y’all better have fixed Miles messed up cut😭💀  Edit: Les goo he got a new cut
amazing definitely playing on launch day
THIS IS INSANE WTF
Am I the only one hoping and praying for anti venom to be in game?
Can’t wait to fight Russian Bradley cooper
Immediately pre ordered the game after my birthday.
Brawl somia don't like your games
Emo Peter like in Spiderman 3?
so sick
Why do i have a feeling that peter will be the final boss
Yuri Lowenthal is about to give us another masterclass in voice acting
I NEED the spot to be a villain in this game
It looks like Kraven's not only hunting Lizard, he is after every super being in New York City
it’s just been confirmed that fish is Richard
Really hope venom acts like spectacular venom  Costly taunting pete belittling him pushing him to the edge and overpowering him till the point of defeat
يخي اموت فيكم وفالقيم بلاي ❤🎉
I got my marvel knowledge from games growing up and then youtube & wikipedia so im glad to see they brought back Kraven i could never beat him on my gameboy advance😂😂😂
now that i think abt it peter kinda sound like matpat
I’m so excited for this even though I don’t even own a ps5
Can't wait for the game to NOT look like this again!
Insomniac gotta release more spiderman 2 content this was from may lmao
or Miles and Peter fighting against Venom
I think Peter is the final boss or its Venom but if its Peter then it might be Miles and Peter fighting
Cannot way to play this game, I hope the symbiote gets its own animations Etc. (Traversal, Swinging, Combat, New Dive Animations, Finishers and The Rage Mechanic From Spider-Man 3 Game) That would be lit!!!
The only real complaint I have and God is it such a grass touch one...  The suit is MAYBE a bit too shiny? Some extra detail might help. At first I didn't like how unexpressive it was but I slowly realized it added to how alien the symbiote is. Love how the suit actually looks organic and just sorta...gross and tar like. And how Spider-Man is just extremely focused and ruthless rather than immediately becoming a jerk. Remember that the Symbiote only heightens already existing emotions, rather than just making someone evil.  Not to mention this may be one of the coolest looking takes on Kraven the Hunter I've ever seen adapted. Immediately sold him as a real, genuine threat with just a single trailer. Plus it's oddly fitting that he's introduced alongside the black suit, since his defining story had Spdier-Man wearing said suit.
2:32 3:41 4:20 7:38 8:48
2:58 sounds like Sasuke
I have a big Big ultimate Question: do the Avengers tower building still standing in this Most Anticipated and Must-play AAA Superhero single-player or coop video-game, Marvel's Spider-man 2 PS5 sequel video-game version?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
that was awesome
First 2 games,lit.this looks 🔥
This is amazing! I can already see this being the game of the year!
I kinda wanna see more from this game as far as who are the other characters Miles and Peter will interact with besides Ganky. Hope we get a State of Play before this game comes out. My excitement for this game is only 8 out of 10. It looks great from what we saw but I just need that one banger preview cut to amp me up to 10 out of 10
I LOVE that we're swapping off between Peter and Miles seamlessly. It is so much better of an idea than having to interrupt the action with us playing powerless civilians like in the last game. That was the only complaint I had in the first one, and now it looks like it won't be a problem anymore.
Never been so hyped for a game
Incroyable ce jeu
I want it now!
Sasuke voice
I like the black suit just like when it has armor it makes the suit look bad
of course it is on ps
Miles’s bio electricity looks OP as hell. They really turned him into electro
3:03 MattPat?
03:10 what is this? 😂
Haven't played it yet, but this seems like one of the games whereby everything is done for you
I’ll beach in 5 years looking back
Just got my ps5 I’m ready 😭
I got it
Wah sangat hebat bro gamenya, from Indonesia.
hopfully the game is gonna be long
Peter's Venom suit is kinda ugly  bruh
The big guy at the starts gonna be venom
Bro this looks absolutely incredible- the new mechanics, the camera movement, everything looks so badass- im extremely excited
Miguel move on miles in across the spiderverse. 5:02
WHO IS THAT BLACK SUIT IS THAT PETER??
I thought that was supposed to be Venom, not Carnage
Im happy you're able to play as miles as this, since he's my favorite spiderman
Btw spider man can be defeated only 1 way scroll to know               Bug spray 💀
peak
Man I cant wait for this game
I really hoped that this would be co-op or vr
I hope there will be no LGBT in this part
I wish this game would come to Xbox since I don’t have a pa4 no more and even if I did it would have to be a ps5
If you guys don't make a Carnage dlc then you really are wasting potential
The biggest thing I hope they do is rename Miles from Spider-Man to Arachnid.
This is great
This game looks amazing the symbiote mechanic looks so fun to use :D
Graphics are hideous in most parts, hope it's addressed.
Still waiting
Miles was shocked when Peter threw him 💀
2:59 mat pat?
Why does symbiote spiderman sound like Sasuke
Sheeeeesh
I suprise raven the hunter main villen in the game 3:56
This game looks sick
The venom suit made Peter Parker turn into Sasuke Uchiha  really quick. 😹 🕷️
Amazing content
Just got my ps5 today. Sl excited to play this
Love Peter's new black air force energy
At least he’s not referring to himself and the symbiot as “we” or “us”
this is so cool
I wish IT was on PS4:(
Because of his aggressiveness, all I hear is Sasuke when hearing Peter talk.
bro i wish miles fights peter when the symbiote takes full control over him
this looks awesome... more abilities and a symbiote suit. I can't wait until it gets released for pc.
no way thats grafics is laging on my pc but is not a game XD
I can’t wait for this game to come out I’m going to buy it on my birthday.
Will this be on PS4 as well?
Im glad that peter parker still have the original suit.. before turning into venom
What if the venom in this game is the person we saw in the spider verse leak
5:00 When Miles pulls a Miguel O’Hara.
I am buying a ps5 to play this like I bout a ps4 to play the previous one
That Miles beat tho... 🔥🔥🔥
I’m so hyped for this game I can’t wait!
Pre ordered it just 98 days til this masterpiece
Lol I can see from a mile away peter snd miles are going to fight at some point
I like how miles spidersense warns him of Peter arriving. Obviously cause of the symbiote
😎😎😎😎🎉
They can fly...
I had to keep checking to make sure this was the trailer for spider man. The music sounded like destiny, and I'm at least 85% sure New york isn't a jungle.
The alley oop was crazy i love the team up
Who’s excited?! Anyways add this on PS4
Bro i am so hyped
i hope perter dose not get more mean becouse of venom
i really hope this game gets ported to PC. It looks amazing!
Am definitely pre ordering
Spiderman 1 is already good think of this game
2:26          i just really like how they did the revealing idk
Am I the only one who loves the facted that sony and marvel partner together and a game maker
I bet Yuri will come back and turn Peter good
nobodys talking about how ganke is FIGHTING now!!!
So it sucks that the story forces a switch between the og spiderman and the other fake one. Enjoyed the first game but points got taken off for miles sections. And now it seems to do the same here.  Guess ill have to pass this great looking game. 🤷‍♂️
I can't wait
Also we wanted marvel avengers 2 game.
I love how the symbiote turned easy going peter into batman, no jokes, likes flying solo, doesn't trust anyone.
i waited a long time for spider-man 2 with the venom symbiote suit and can,t wait to see Peter's classic showdown with Norman Osborn as The Green Goblin by Insomniac Games with Miles Morales. Excelsior!  Thanks! Steve Ditko and Stan ' The Man ' Lee.
hello
I do look forward to this game, but I do have some concerns. Like when Miles took down that metal bird in the stealth section.. All that noise, and no one down below heard that ?? And why would he need to shoot a gadget on a wall for making a Web line, when he could just use his nomal web shooters for that... am I overthinking this ???
Can't belive Rais and Angelo Bronte is in this game
See you guys in 2 years when the PC version drops.
Time to go boom boom😂😂😂😂
Whoever complained this looks too familiar to the last game is just stupid cuz there's nothing like this mission in those games
I like how miles became an anime character when he had his electric powers out 4:51
Hopefully soon I get my hands on until October 20! I really want to play this from Web of Shadows but better gadgets 😃✨
5:00 When Miles goes all Ryu mode Miles: Hadoken! Shoryuken!
Wow.... Good!!!
😢😢😢 I play on xbox
1:28 looks like Yuri is returning as a villain. Wonder how they’re gonna handle that.
“Light the FYURS”
I tried holding X to skip cinematic 😂
Bro, how is nobody talking about Miles' new finisher? 5:00 that's the same move 2099 used on Miles in Across The Spider Verse
Just me or does anyone else think the soundtrack played at 6:35 is the same as TASM 1 lizard theme?
Hello, all is good thank you from this game
I hope the animation where  Peter uses the symbiote to swing around the light post and launches himself is in the game!
cold
W game
I have a feeling we will fight shocker as Peter in the black suit who will get hurt because the black suit doesn’t like vibrations so you have to switch to miles to finish the fight and miles will remember this and use the vibrations to get the black suit off Peter eventually
The visuals, the animations, the mechanics,  the devs did an incredible job and I’m sure S2 will sell millions of copies. Keep innovating!
Kraven looks like my uncle
Hi please make it famous so after 10 years I know am a og 😊
I just finished Spider-Man remastered so I’m hella excited
ой блин... ну и ШЛЯПА! У черного паука даже паутина черная, а то не толерантно было бы, да? Просто капец, в каком мире я живу... Что сделали с человеком-пауком...
Awesome
Did they really have to include Miles in this game?  The first was pretty awesome without him...  Whatever.  smh
Pls tell me that peter will get more expressive swinging too
I'm so glad Miles managed to evolve into a better spider-man while maintaining his swagger of a black teen
Of course Miles has to save spiderman
If this game comes out on PC I'm going to get it!
Cool
Why are there two spidermans isnt one enough
I don't get why spiderman2 is not on ps4
In my head i'm playing this game as: Web of Shadows 2
If you look at miles load out on the left you see two of them are blue and the other two are orange. I think this represents his bio electric powers and you can even see his orange venom powers when he does the allay hoop with peter
Black
Peter in his emo stage:
The 2077 spideman slam 👍👍
How are miles and peter going to differentiate from each other in public without calling each other by name?
AND I THOUGHT SPIDER MAN MILES MORALES WAS THE BEST SPIDERMAN GAME😭
why did he sound like angry matpat at 3:03 what the hell
I feel like the clarity of the graphics took a step back for sure. Looks like TASM 2 quality
4:59 na bro miles learned that move from spider man across the spider verse
There is webgliding!
I wish Peter said"Mine are bigger"
Peter with symbiote is basically sasuke lol
miles morales aka the abomination
Happy with the look of this game  Still think the wingsuit is not really needed though
Now Jay Jonah Jameson can have something to really complain about
waiting for pc release
Sasuke is very present here the voice actor had plenty of practice for symbolite spider-man by doing Sasuke
11:51 🔥🔥🔥
i see marvel isnt just ripping of dc character wise but as well as mechanics ( and vica versa ) nice decision isnt releasing this on pc, lost a couple million copies there i dont know what i was expecting, you didnt even make subs oh well, at least until then it will be clear if the game actually have what it promises, and not half of it just collectibles
11:35 With the Symbiot I can confidently say Spiderman has been upgraded to Sasuke Parker-with the curse mark! If the extra base in Peter's voice wasn't enough to tip you off that something us wrong then the way he disrespectfully Yeeted that poor dude after he rescued him definitely is
I loved how Yuri channeled his inner 1994 animated symbiote Spider-Man! Don’t know if it was intentional, but he definitely sounded rather similar.
ABSOLUTELY LOVE the detail on lizard it looks awesome!
All I hear is Sasuke
5:00 so Miles can do kamehameha...nice 👍🏻
There's a wingsuit, instant buy
requesting “miles shoulder touch venom strike” in the skill tree! make it happen!’
Come on Empress baby, show me your love.
UR STEALING THIS VIDEWO
Love how in the comics when Peter had the symbiotic suit on he was more aggressive and less patiently, which rubs off on the game
the new color for miles  Morales's vemon power looks cool
For once Jonah might have a point about Spider-Man given Peter's attitude and aggression 😂
Wish i can play this. I already accept that im not going to play this game since I'm broke and when i graduated, I'm already old and probably busy working.
1:33 Hold on who was that target above Taskmaster and below every R.A.F.T Prisoner ?
Why its only on ps5 😭
is it a game or a movie???
I’m fine with all the Kraven and Venom stuff I’m looking foreword to how Norman Osbourne is going to play into this, if miles will have to fight Peter and if Harry will survive his illness
3:35 Me when my homie has a 2 man thats about to leave
Sooooo this trailer revealed ALOT . Obviously new villains (Venom , Kraven , Lizard , and possibly green goblin/hobgoblin with the mention of “harry being sick “ ….. this is gonna hit HARD LOL .   Not to mention in the beginning Kravens locater thing scanned over New York and revealed multiple spider peeps . I’m wondering if we could possibly see the spidey verse since he made an appearance in Across the Spiderverse . Time will tell !
Knowing how yuri was the English voice actor of sasuke, this game will be crazy
I hope they bring back the old black rami suit again it was so sick
So who else is re-watching this while waiting for the game to drop?
Two things -  1. One, Miles got new Venom powers. Does anyone think Nuform enhanced his powers? 2. In general, Miles can't catch a break this year🤣 Loving the new Symbiotic suit!! Reminded me of Shattered dimensions and Web of Shadows!! <3
Nah that ain't Peter anymore That's sasuke
Bro i bet Wolverines line will be be greater forever
pls have multiplayer
I’m so excited to see  peters arc with the symbiote, the potential is crazy
Is it just me, or is this the first time that Miles has been thrown into the symbiote suit tradition?
Bro when miles use us venom powers and it has a new color and peter has venom bruh this game is gonna be great
Playstation players don't be soo happy . May be pc players have to wait for 2-3yrs for pc release but we are going to get the best version😂😂😂😂
I can’t wait
11:37 peter is not talking with Miles he’s talking with Venom
peter sounds like game theory
Miles got choke slammed so hard by 2099 , he began choke slamming other people
Can't wait to see more venom action
Can't wait for the stealth missions and hideouts missions
The gameplay looks so amazing and looks like a good continue to the miles morales game...the web line move would be so good
YOOOOOOOO
shottttttttttttttttttttttttttt
No co op ? Now youre just teasing me .
And you wanna tell me theres no co op mode ?!?  For real ?
Am I the only one who can't believe theres no 2 player co op in this ???
Still can't believe theres no co op😢
Even tho hes in the symbiote suit, he still holds on to the goofy side of himself and calls the drone the metal murder bird
You know, I've been thinking about Insomniac's approach to portraying the symbiote on whether they will adhere to the concept of it being an extraterrestrial entity or the  narrative inspired by the Ultimate comics where the symbiote would be depicted as a suit created by  Eddie and Peter's fathers, intended to cure cancer
Yoooo! We get to fight mark Zuckerberg at his full potential in this game,iam so buying this game.
Waiting for PC port. See y’all in 5 years
Wait was shocker confirmed for this game cause if you slow it down and go to 1:34 you see shocker on the map?
I’m a ps4 player this game  looks so clean it’s just prices of the ps5 got me crying
WE WAITING FOR VENOM
We will be playing
I hope we can see the old Peter's face in this one
No way they have wraith yuri😮
I love the soundtrack in the beginning
Wish it could be on ps4
hope this gets goty fr
Bruh, I can't believe it looks like they outdone the previous games' gameplay. I'm impressed, can't wait for it to appear on PC.
wow, this looks sick af
Venom: You want to save your friend, and I need him to live so I can survive. Merge with me, and we'll both get what we want. Do we have a deal?  Spiderman: Fine. Just don't make me kill.  Venom: Can't make any promises.
3:43 music is soooo goood
He is more evil and it looks like he actually kills them instead of knocking them down
po
How to download this
its like watching a movie!!!!
khoon khoon khoon.
I cant wait to see what Jameson has to say about that tour boat 😂
Look how much faster  the traversal is
the peter parker boss isgonna be tuff
Can’t wait until tom holland finds miles morales
Miles is a goat he carried the whole time( it’s crazy none of you talking about it)
Peter is going to say the n-word. I know it.
Now this... This looks fun! Time to start saving up for PS5 I guess. Spider-man calling Spider-man as Spider-man, that's gonna getting used to lol.
Anyone else notice that you can dodge under in midair now?
How does miles fly???
Peter looks like venom he probably upgraded his suit
Finished both games and now I am so hyped for this
Ride em rawhide.   And let's put jaws music on.
iam so glad pete isnt a criminal after being choosen by venom
shut up and take my money!
How do we switch to miles to peter and Peter to miles?
Ps4???
anyone notice at 10:49 peter is much serious more over he wants to do things his own way
I was here 💀
Based on the movie across the spiderverse. There can’t be 2 spidermen, do u think peter will die in this game?
Prototype 3?
I AM SO HYPED
MY DAD BOUT TO BUY ITTT
This is probably gonna release before silksong
They should make this game for Xbox players
When lizard is chasing miles there are some odds collision and animations, I think the game needs some polishing in that regard. I also don't particularly like those over the top moves in fights.
bros opium now
It was god dammit like 2 years so we can see god damm gameplay
Spiderman: "HE'S GONNA WISH HE NEVER CAME TO NEW YORK!!" Me: Goddamn peter.🤨😐
Does anyone know if it’s the old peter Parker or the new face peter Parker?
I ALREADY PLAYED IT THE FINAL BOSS IS ONE AGAINST EACH OTHER AND PETER DIES BUT VENOM SURVIVES FOR THE NEXT GAME
Yuri Lowenthal went full Sasuke for this new Peter
Isn't spiderman 2 spiderman miles morales
5:01 Miles did Miguel’s move😮
Only negative is leavens men’s use of tech really bored of villains using high tech body armour and robotic animals ? Really?
Kinda disappointed that were not fighting venom
This is so badass kraven inna new spider man game then he’s gettin his own movie a dub fs😮‍💨😮‍💨
Bro I swear this is going to be game of the year for 2023
So excited especially how dark Peter might become if he stays like this and how if the symbiote leaves him the how much it will change
How do you use that wing suit?!?❤🎉😮
i got the feeling of prototype stuff in here
Is Peter Parker playable in this sequel? Thats all I wanna know, I don't care much for the new spidey.
И ради этого покупать PS5??? 🤔 P. S. Ага уже несу бабки 🤣🤣🤣...
Spiderman is officially canceled for hitting a woman💀
Grafiknya gilaa
I hope they don't force the Miles switches too much. I want to play as Peter Parker, not Miles.
You can just tell the developers were inspired by the animalistic killer croc design from the Arkham games.
Pc players gotta wait years to play it 😭
at 8:38 the guy literally just jumps overboard 😂
Who knew that the guy who voiced spider man in the unlimited mobile would become one of the best voiced for spidey in the best adaption of the character
See y'all in a few months ❤❤ . This is gonna be a masterpiece .
I’m so sad I can’t play this since it’s a PS5 Exclusive and I have a PS4 :_(
spider man:im ganno make him wish he never came to new york!!!
I still have a ps4 :(
5:00 bro really did the choke slam from 2099 in across the spiderverse 😭
At least it's being honest about being a movie game since 70% of the gameplay reveal was cutscenes and scripted sequences lmao
The need to remaster webs of shadows
i do not understand i played spider man marvels i played spider man miles morales but in spider man marvels harry was going to be venom but now peter is i just dont get it i guess i just have to find out
Did they take Sanji voice in one piece 😂
how many paid hacks are on this thread?
I love that kraven is basically Kratos 😂😂
Watching this on July 2023
Anyone else wondering what the plan is once Peter gets rid of the suit? L.all the venom abilities can’t just go away right?
Will it have splitscreen ?
Dope 👍
Please stop the bending with move of metal armor !
❤
türkçe niye yok su spiderman oyunlarında arapça var türkçe yokk
This will go down as HISTORY
💪🏼
3:10 Peter definitely killed that mf
Maybe there will be a fight in which we will be Miles trying to get the symbiote off from Peter....That would be awesome!!!
Gahhhhhhhhh when this dropping?
I wanna see symbiote Spider-Man fight silver sable 😈
I hope Peter Parker doesn't turn into venom
How is this game popular. The amount of views is cazy
Do you know how HARD you'd have to be hit to bounce like that goon at 2:42?
10:43 A really cool blink and you’ll miss it detail I noticed is how when Miles saves the fisherman’s life and webs him up, he also webs up the fish he was reeling in!🎣
Remember this was supposed to be shown last year just imagine how the graphics would look when the game come out
5:00 Miles did Kamehameha
OCTOBER 20TH
so hyped
Lets hope that the suits in across the spider verse are in this game
THIS IS INSANEEEE. OMG  I LOVE THE IMPROVEMENT THAT MILES GOES THROUGH
i wish spider man 2 was well cheaper cuz then id buy now
I'm really looking forward to the Peter Parker scenes after the symbiote attatches itself to him. I wonder if his complexion will look similar to Cole Macgrath from inFamous 2 where it makes his skin grey and his face is gaunt.
Omfg we gotta fight Peter?? Probs as the main boss or sm
1:26 she devoured her 1 second of screentime fr
excited for it to be in queens instead of harlem. brand new map 🎉
The bgm at 3:26 has me feeling like Spiderman no lie
I love how the UI changes for each of the Spider people! It really adds that extra bit showing that they're different people.
Conners be looking like Killer Croc
I am leaving this here so in 10 years someone likes I get to see this masterpiece again🔥
Let’s go spider man 2 was the greatest game ever back on PS2 and this game won’t disappoint
The real question is how will the symbiote suit will affect his relationship with Mary Jane
Emo-Man
❤❤❤
Can you put the across the spider verse suit in the game xoxo zakkyg gaming p.s do it on a easy bit
Does anyone miles entrance music?
WoooooAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
All I know is they BETTER reference Spiderman's meme where he's screaming "SHOCKER!! YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME, I CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARRRRRRTH!!" For another character. Also, great symbiote suit, and great symbiote abilities, I think they're saving venom for the final boss
no ones mentioned how peter is effected by the symbiote the same way doc ock was from the neural interface, becoming something that he hated in otto
Black suited symbiote spider man is 🔥🔥🔥 Can't wait for this.. & i love to see the Venom in action baby🔥❤️😍
Is it just me or does Peter’s visor change slightly when he say’s “he’s mine” at the end
Hi
wow now spiderman is consuming the power of venom,electro,rhino(aggressiveness),and oh green goblin...cus he's gliding!! :p
3:10 I would... NOT wanna be that guy 😂
Theory: as we know from the new movie only one spider man can exist so Peter is getting corrupted by the suit so maybe in the end we will see a fight between miles and Peter resulting in most probably Peters death
at least like 60% of those kraven goons are definitely dead
💯🔥🔥🔥
This is very nice. 🖤
Did you know that in Marvel’s Spiderman, when MJ is trying to find we’re the Antiserum is for devils breath, when she freaks out that a spider jumped out at her, and when she is hiding from the sable girl behind a desk, and that’s when a spider is on her shoulder and the best part about that spider is that it has the numbers 42 on it just like the spider that bite Miles in Spiderman into the spider verse.
New suit, new personality And I thought he wanted to protect Connors not kill him I think Harry has a cure
1 month already?
Peter’s evil voice is just so awesome...
i kinda want there to be an option for singleplayer or multiplayer
i kinda want there to be an option for singleplayer or multiplayer
i kinda want there to be an option for singleplayer or multiplayer
This video gonna be fire in 10 years and I’m in my 20s 💯
I was here
11:32 The way he just yeeted the guy💀
Sasukee!!!!!!! 😂😂😂
I'm so glad they improved the traversal abilities and swinging speed. I was so scared this game would be just as slow.
8
Cant wait for this to come out and i alr preordered it
I really hope this is as emotionally traumatizing as the first game XD😊
looks cool but if it as grindy as one ill pass
Gliding and walking on web mechanics excites me the most. Imagine how much more tactical this will be.
Man I love the expression of the symbiote's eyes at 2:50. So sick
xbox fangirls crying right now
My friend has decided to use the digital one and we said he plays pete i play miles one mission and then we switch for the next mission
I see you rewatching this video in 2033 tryna relive old memories, you aint slick
This game is mid          I'm joking this game is gonna insane
Can’t decide between this and assassins creed mirage or hogwarts legacy
As a switch owner, I may have to order a PS5
I am good karma
This is like Sasukes curse mark.
Hyped on this Game
ah yes the Prototype spiderman, make more bullshit pls, all this bullshit you added is not what spiderman is, 1st he is not mutant, or fantastic 4 gummy man (even with venoms cels), he cant fly, slow time,  see through walls, bullet proof ,invisible and other holywood star craps....all he have is sticky hands, no the web is not fired from his hands, its a device, and his sense that flashing in danger, and a little of fighing and prakour technique....and yes a SPANDEX suit (not armored hulk/ironman) to cover his identity, and Parker is not bodybuilder half black half mexican he is white guy, like it or not....
Yo, I'm buying a PS5 JUST because of this game!
I wish under the mask of Peter would be the old version’s face but not the remastered one, I really hope insomniac would listen to our comments.
This looks brilliant
Looks great
Thought this was the next Tomb raider game from the intro
im alive
I LOVE THE NEW SPIDER MAN GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
can we talk about the fact kraven broke someones neck with 1 hand whilst talking
The attention to detail on Pete is just amazing. He no longer uses quips or makes fun of the situation. He is grumpy, serious and considers everything as a threat.
Comics Spider-Man: *rejects the black suit as soon as he finds out it's an alien*  94's, Sam Raimi's & Spectacular's Spider-Men: *accept the black suit as an alien and only reject it when it starts to influence them too much. Still, none of them really tap into what the symbiote can really do*  This Spider-Man: *GLORY TO THE SYMBIOTE EMPIRE*
Cant wait
ужасный симбиотический костюм, графика местами мыло, анимация движений коннорса в форме ящера просто кошмар
I wanted to feel that venom brutality again!! can't wait
When you walk down the street in black suit I hope he breaks camera phones and dances when he hears jazz music
Can you pls to ps4
This looks great, but why the sudden change in color scheme for the UI?
I’ll be here
Am i the only one noticing the "spider dance" move from the Web of Shadows DS game? 😢 3:09
the person behind the controls playing this, has my kind of eye. >!). To whom it may concern.
I need to know if having the symbiote will allow us to throw dirt in someone eye. Should have a move “imma throw dirt in your eyes” so his transformation the dark side is complete.
You know what would be a really interesting idea? The symbiote suit or Venom is actually an ally sorta like Eddie and Venom in the Venom movie. His abilities become a permanent thing but not only with the Symbiote suit. Maybe it can be like the Venom Movie where Venom sorta hides until he comes out, so whenever you're wearing another suit, Venom is still there to give you his powers, just hidden.
wish this was on ps4, cant afford ps5 :c
Ayo you can beat women now?  Hell yeah I love equality.
I really want this game to have PSVR support
4:47 when she say watch out for his new powers maybe the nuform changed his abilities in some way? As before it was more yellow now it’s blue
Bro ain’t having kids😭 3:11
What happened to am just knocking them out
Hope it comes out on Xbox 360.
God savvesesss
Please, release version PS4
The Rise of Peter Uchiha!
Can’t wait to see what collectibles we’re gonna find in this game
See, if you're feeling underwhelmed by the graphical detail - remember the first gameplay reveal for Spider-Man PS4 and compare it to the final game. Insom got this.
Sasuke about to go HAM 😂. Kraven better ask the Kages
What I worry about is the game doing Venom the same disservice the shows and movies did, watering him down into a big-talking bully no more violent than Spider-man himself. All I'll say is I really hope for a spinoff that lets Venom be Venom.
Theory Symbiote is going to make Peter kill someone and he will be guilt tripped Miles will get a bit more distant and Peter will have regrets
The small details make a big experience to see Peter be more aggressive with the symbiote is Mwah
Women fighting? Bruv theyre gettin slammed even harder.
I really hope they do something like in the Arkham knight where u can switch between characters whilst fighting a group of enemies. Imagine being able to switch between miles and Peter during combat
I hope this game has co-op,to play online with friends
Please release on pc
I hope to god this has a co-op option
miles is literally raiden wtf
Honestly, all I want is the TASM 2 suit and the black Raimi suit and it's complete for me. 😩👌  And I'd like the Big Time suit to return for Peter and the T.R.A.C.K. suit for Miles, after that this game is literally perfection for me. 😝
See you when this game gives vibes like San Andreas in 10 years ❤
I think Peter will realise the symbiote is evil but by the time he thinks that he would have already driven Miles and MJ away and will result in provoking Miles in order to get the Venom Blast to rid of the symbiote
Since if first played Spider-Man miles morales I got the feeling that miles is going to hook up with Haley. Like it’s going to happen in this game. Anyone else get that feeling because their scenes in the last one?
I love spider man
yujiro hanma can really learn fro  him😟
Very good game, too bad I will not be able to play this. Inflation is annoying.
Fitgirl repacks goes brrrrr its free ❤❤❤❤
If lizard is a new villain in this universe, how come Dr. Isaac Delany was dressed as him in the party?
2:50
I hope they scan your save files or something like taht fromm miles moras and spiderman remaster/orignal for thesave file and you get all the suits gadgets ect taht you ahve unlocked as extra thank you  for owning that/those game
Is there gonna be a customizable suit?
Just love the fact that peter threw the guy he saved on the floor
Kraken in the hunter kind of looks like kratos from god of war
All bad things of this channel i cant
What color is your ps5 ?
KRAVEN YOOO
Is this gonna be released on steam
We will see cat again!! ❤️😭😭
wow so cool
Sooo Spider-Man 2 its just all about new swing and fight animations. No new maps like manhattan or any place."Spider-Man Venom DLC" This game should come out like this.
To future generations,this is peak gaming
I hope this drops on pc too
Ironically peter here is not actually angry all the time . He has some control . When he says to miles that he is his , it looks like he is afraid to unleash the full power of the symbiote . He knows that he suffer from a kind off personality disorder
Truly amazing. But the chase sequence gave me uncharted 4 vibes. Can't wait for the game to be released though.
Let's wait for it    I wish to see kraven get his a$$ handed to him and his backstory and venoms too
Really hyped . But when realised
theres probably alot of people saying that peter's extra-gruff voice in the symbiote suit is corny, but i just don't care. Yuri Lowenthal is hamming it up in this and i love it
You should allowed Alf people who played miles morales and spider man to have there old costume
If they released this on pc they would get so many sales This is just disappointing
i just hope they change peter's model back to the old one, it fits yuri's voice much better than the new one
Why is Miles's Venom blue? What happened to yellow?
That's a lot of making it seem like you're playing while you just press buttons through their scene. You can't make any real choices yourself.
If Insomniac doesn’t add the dancing scene from Spider-man 3 i’m not buying the game
Two words that best describes this game: AWESOME AND BADASS!!! I can't wait to play as Peter, Miles, and most importantly VENOM!!!!
I hope they fix the ui
Seeing that the have gliders means Spider-Man 2099 suit has to make a return
Peter is probably slowly becoming venom
in spiderman 3 when he had the venom suit he didnt have venom powers did he?
If only I had a PS5 to play:) Still on the PS4:/
Very well
Please be available ps4
Am I crazy or can I hear a cackling laugh ie Green Goblin? As the Symbiote explodes to reveal “Spider-Man 2” I distinctly hear a laugh
This is going to be a good game
In the first game's post credit scene symbiote was attached to harry and has a green light on normans face. Green goblin must be a surprise villian in this game
Bring to ps4 😭😭
yea i’m preordering now
rum dum dee loo
potential to be goty 2023🤔🔥
I don't think insomniac are the Devs to make these games great. They do an ok job but the gameplay looks like it needs a lot more work to feel fun, in fact I think it needs to scrapped entirely and redone
Excited for Miles Vs Peter👀
They really going for game of the year👏👏👏
Naruto: Sasuke what are you doing in that spidey suit!???
I LOVED the first game, and I 100% the Miles Morales game, I just hope for a same date PC release or soon after
4:59  “Watch out for his new powers!” Miles: *electrifies and body slams mercenary*   This game is going to be among the greats 🌋
Friendly Spiderman
every year i rewatch DanTDM play both spiderman games so i cant wait for this
i cant comprehend how many times ive watched this i think spidermans (peter) gonna keep being wreckless and get caught by kraven, leading into a boss
Does anyone else think that spider man meant him and the symbiote when he said "us"?
Already see that Kraven the Hunter is going to be better villain than Mr. Negative and that is hard bar to pass. It's same move from the last instalment , they showed Mr. Lee in Gameplay reveal from 2017 but not actual villain of the game.
The fact this trailer is better some whole games I have seen is saying something
It would be cool if they added the theme songs for Tom, Andrew and tobey when choosing their suits
I really hope they get rid of the Tom Holland face mod bullshit...
"Light the fires."
It feels wrong knowing that peters face looks like a newborn baby under the mask 😂
I just realized that in 6:26 Peter is watching Miles on the left
Just pre ordered, can't wait to see angry peter
Did nobody notice Miles doing the 2099 chokeslam at 5:02? Bro took notes
why peter is venom
oh my god
5:03 I guess Miles must have learned from Miguel.
Venom (I got that) Adrenaline momentum And I'm not knowin' when I'm Ever gonna slow up and I'm Ready to snap any moment, I'm Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em They ain't gonna know what hit 'em (When they get bit with the)
One thing is sure ☑️ This game is gonna change the records in no time!!! 🎉The wait is just killing me😵
The only thing I don’t like about this is that miles still sounds like a 13 year old
I have got to stop watching this over and over lmao it’s so close yet so far!
i just noticed that peter is punching a lot more in this game. In the first game he relied on kicks alot. Like when you performed a square combo he would just kick. In this one he punches. Little detail but its so cool
wow 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Crazy,10 years from now we’ll be looking back on how hyped we were for this game.
Bro it’s been a month already???
Is it multiplayer
Oh but for what console?!?!?
1:28 Wraith!
That Ganke guy who "hijacked" a drone, I dislike him already
Elraen
OMG new Spider Man
He’s going to wish he’s NEVER came to New York… YES I LOVE THE BLACK SUIT RAGE
I cant wait him to say im gonna put some dirt in ur eyes
spidey chussa
ehe
I just finished both games and I gotta say. This looks so hype!!! Can’t wait 🕷️🕷️🕷️🕸️🕸️🕸️
9:15 hope they changed this scene cause I am NOT pressing the triangle button
I swear during the first finisher at 2:44 you see the symbionts pierce through the enemy head.
I know I'm getting too hyped but would be sick if spider-man 3 or 4 has a superior spider-man storyline or we get a dlc or something hahaha
Peter sounds so overdone, edgy and ridiculous. Sounds like some normal dude trying to sound tough or something.
Will this version of New York city accurately depict the homelessness, crime, and drug abuse?
Did he just threw him to the ground 11:32 lol
Can't wait
ring updated
spider-man game of the year edition
5:01 that was so sick 🔥
Ganke : He's not normally like that right? Tobey : Yes
give a like if you like spiderman
Yuri Lowenthal had an excuse to utilize the classic anime protagonist voice.
I cant stop watching this!
i like to imagine the story will basically be in 2 halves, the first half is us dealing with kraven, and the second half being dealing with the symbiote. the story of the lizard will likely be an overarching story for both halves
Wooooooohoooooohhh!!!
Gives a mode where we convert the world to look exactly like into the spider verse or across the spidy verse.
lookin good
Game will be only on ps5 or on ps4 too?
Love miles kamehameha 😂
Looks amazing
I feel there is a moment in this game use Miles to fight Symbiote Peter
Is it gonna be on the ps4
Reminds me of Prototype
Yes
Miles VS Peter ( ready ? )
omg man cant wait
Gonna make a quick prediction  I think the teaser was a fake out. I think that Harry gives the symbiote to Spider-Man in hopes that he can find a more effective cure to his disease and PETER becomes Venom and miles has to stop him and we have to fight Peter as venom and maybe even play as venom.   It would really work from a narrative standpoint and it would be a good call back to the Ultimate Spider-Man video game where you get to play as venom.
peter parker sounding alot like emo Sasuke Uchiha lol
peter parker sounding alot like emo Sasuke Uchiha lol
Man, Peter really be turning into Sasuke in this
Be Greater Together (while playing alone),(RIP: No Multiplayer)
I want moreeee
birthday money fanna be nice
well now we know who is  gonna win game of the year
2:30 the line he says "You have no idea" could he be talking to venom? as we know that venom can to those people who he is in contact with.
There will be 3 villain here,kraven the hunter,venom and the lizard
Oh my god this is already amazing, I can't wait.
The fact that you can tell he’s STILL pulling his punches is Terrifying
3:08 this man’s lungs just absorbed his ribs
Come let's pray for it to be on pc 🙏
It’s sasuke
No way this is gameplay? Looks astonishing.
This is going to be a masterpiece🔥🔥. I’m so excited to find out venom identity🤔
i can’t wait for this
I paid 650€ to play spiderman 2. 570€ for PS5 today and 80 for game, I'm so excited to play it soon
Thats not Peter thats Sauske Uchiha
How come peter is alive again? He died in the first game?
Fire 🔥
this game looks so realistic cant wait
What I hope to see is a fight between peter and miles where miles tries to get the symbiote off peter. There would be a second phase where peter full on turns into venom with teeth and all to really hammer in how much of a parasite the symbiote is.
Wheres the part where he swears
I know this is taking away from how phenomenal this trailer is, but the water physics are distractingly bad.
i know we don't see a lot of it, but i love how the advance suit looks much more red now
look at miles channeling his inner goku at 4:59, al it needs is a kamehameha.
1:28 Thank me later
Who else hears nothing but Sasuke talking
Made me buy a ps5 for this game 💀
Wait Venom and Miles are friends? Can someone tell me what happened? I thought Venom and Spiderman are enemies
So is nobody gonna talk about miles' kamehameha?
Thank god Peter has venom, people were really hating and doubting. Old heads hate seeing new narrative and plot 😭😭
wait so it miles spider man 2 ps5 and spider man 2 ps5
This is so fire
I can honestly say that Spiderman & Wolverine (and originally Returnal)was the only reason I bought a PS5 . Im so used to K+M and been gaming on PC for so long that now when I play ps5 the controller feels foreign to me. That wont matter come October 20TH because I'm going to be on the PS5 EVERYDAY!
yang servernya indoensia ngumpul sni🗿
Shut up and take me Monday
I defo wanna see miles vs Peter to show miles’s maturity and that the student reminds the teacher what they taught ‘em
The fact that they changed Peter Parkers character design to look like a twink, I don't think it lends itself well to this great voice acting. Should have stuck with the original older looking design in my opinion.
**P E R F E C T**
please keep working on it theres so much potential.
When he said” He got away from us “. I don’t think he was referring to Miles
Bought
I personally think they should really remaster spiderman web of shadows so new players could get to experience the old gen classic and so they get to show where they got the ideas from‼️
just figured this out but i never knew the voice of spiderman ps4 is the same voice actor for sasuke i probably shoud have known tho
Thug: How bad do you want to play Spider-Man2?  Me: You have no idea
Man im getting this, but my brain may explode for how overwhelmed ill be with the fighting mechanics
I just want them to improve on the tentacles physics. Like when he lands to the ground, I fell like it needs recoil or like a bit of rebound with the fall. They look a little stiff. It would at least portray the mass that the symbiote can create
October 20 release date
I absolutely LOVE Yuri but I just can not NOT feel like I'm hearing Sasuke. Like the minute spidey said "he's mine" I imagined spiderman just swinging across NYC with a headband and a chidori screaming "narruuttooooooo!!!"
Nahh sauske voicing spiderman is crazy good
ngl the only thing thats disappointing is the UI i miss the ones from miles morales and the original game from insomniac
Fun fact: Spiderman trying to find Connors for medicine and trying to save him while being in the symbiote suit is a reference to Spiderman 3 game where Spidey fought Kraven too while trying to save the lizard and he also fought the giant lizard. Nice Easter egg.
I like how Yuri's black suit voice is just Sasuke LOL
PL -> Chyba się zakochałem. ENG -> I think I fell in love. 😍
Its cool how they are showing the effects of the symbiote and how peter is starting to become more aggressive and agitated towards miles but he has not completely changed yet
First, we had Bully Maguire. Now, we have Furi Lowenthal.
The gameplay is fire but the thing that got me hyped up is Kraven finally coming back as a (probably) major villain
My word I cannot wait to play this. My job let's me play video games in my office at home all day except when I'm on a work call which is very rare so ive been playing spiderman 1 and miles morales in anticipation for this game. Starfield will get me through until this comes out
spider man now can fly and no more web string
looks sick as cant wait for the pc release
... Wish I had a PS5 man this looks SO AWESOME!👌
Shocker better be shitting his pants in this
I wish I had a PS5 so I could play this, it looks sick, my goodness.
1:28 just noticed that wraith was shown in kraven’s screen meaning that there is gonna be a side mission as Peter to track her down and stop her from killing criminals
Good bives mfs when bad bives mfs pop up.
I would like to think that Yuri took a page from the animated series symbiote spiderman. The way he says “I told you to stay away from Conners” really reminds me of the cartoon spiderman screaming for shocker
Why do they use his back symbal for the logo and not his front symbal they do this with all the merch for the game too i wish they used his front😢 i like it better
I wish this video was in 4K 60FPS like the one playstation uploaded
is this game gonna be on pc
all his attacks sound and look... genuinely brutal.
KRAVENNNNNN
I’m guessing venom is coming near the end to set up 3
Im really hoping that we fight peters spiderman when he has the symbiote as miles that would be soooo cool!!!!
Ghm  , b 00pom.    مخ هه٩حخخVخمر Oiuuu00
Nope ur not the only one checking here again just beacuse u wanted to watch it again
ну что можно сказать, интерфейс если же он такой и будет в чем я не уверен, то полная хуйня и костюм венома, не он классно смотрится, но как на него легла графика моджо даже проблеваться, а так игра классная это при том, что она еще разрабатывается
Good luck to the 10 who can play it
I think kraven the hunter will be venom
Water graphics is mid. Bleh.
5:00 Bro really tried to steal Miguel choke slam 💀
Just a few more months, my friends.
WHyyyyy why is it PS5 exclusive??!! WHyy???!!!
I dont have a ps5 so cant play this game. Hope they suddenly say that its coming to ps4 too. 😢
Here's an interesting thought, for gameplay purposes Peter will need to keep the symbiote after the games story is finished, so like, I wonder if Peter and Venom will come to some sort of agreement or something else happens.
Spiderman 2 the movie game was a technical marvel. An extreme acheivment made my extremely talented people. That game had so much more than people realized back in the day, no loss in framerate, webs actually stuck to objects, and there was so much combat tech like jump cancels, etc. But these new games man... they really are art. Idk if the technology is pushing the same limits like it was back in the day, but these new games absolutely delivered on what I, as an old fan, wanted. I will be preordering this game because i have that much faith in insomniac, making it the only game ive ever preordered besides halo 2 and splinter cell blacklist. I just know its gonna be good.
Its not going to be on ps4 :(😢
If we get to see kraven vs Taskmaster ima be so hyped for that
Is sucker-punch somehow involved in the development? Dude this feels a lot like InFamous
I can't wait to see so many "Spider-Man doesn't kill" videos from this game 11:05 😂
WHAT IF YOU HAVE TO FIGHT PETER AS MILES AND THEN FIGHT VENOM AS PETER IN PETERS HEAD
Please bring back the spectacular Spider-Man
This looks aweasome
Everyone: *enjoying the edgy and cool spiderman with the venom suit*  Me: *realizes that it's gonna be the shawn Mendes and tom Holland child peter*
this year for spider man has been the best year xD
bro take my money Edit pls put it on steam
yo miles using the hadouken at 4:59
Am i the only one who is watching this trailer in every 2 days???
Peter voice is deep
Guys there's a chance this will be the story of spiderman 4 !! . I mean look at the possibilities
I am Batman
Did nobody else see the fact that Peter harshly threw that random man down after saving him from the explosion?
I definitely saw prowler
Question is the game out or did he just get early access?
🤩what a game it is😵
2:29 This transition is amazing. And I love the black suit design, it’s the perfect mix between sleek and gooey. Like how they’ve included black webbing and the tendrils as well, with Peter already rocking the symbiote’s enhanced abilities and how it’s taken effect on him.  And Miles just being like “New threads?” hinting that he’s used to Pete wearing different suits like in the previous games. This is going to be incredible.
My only disappointment with this game so far is the news that Venom will NOT be Eddie Brock. I don't know why the developers chose this.
People if your wondering how Spidermans lenses changed like that its possibly because of the venom symbiote taking over.....
will it be out on pc?
peter really pulling an anakin right now
Moment when he said time to go boom boys. I just knew that wasn't the normal spider man we all know and love. Bully Lowenthal is born
It's time for peter to throw some dirt in your eyes
finally, Prototype 3 is coming out
Bro Peter is Bully Maguire😂
I can't wait for that game I CAN'T
when peter is aggressive he kinda sounds like kachan
Am I the only one that noticed miles venom power went from orange to blue
3:02 THERES A PARRY!?
Hate this game... you must presa 10 buttons to do one thing lol
Honestly can’t wait for this game looks so good I have played both spider man PS4 and miles morales and the anticipation is so higher for the the next chapter in the insomniac Spider-Man universe
Symbiote sounds like Sasuke
i love when they do the ally-oop
GOTY loading...
Looks nice but also frustrating, the best actions are in cinematics
So cool
i can't unhear the "naw his lizard cheeks are mine" from that one vid
I have a bad feeling the game will feature much more Miles than Peter...
This is like if the first Spider-Man met just cause 3 with a tad of uncharted lmao. This looks incredible
I had no idea how they were going to top the first 2 games but goddamn this is unreal
Most deppresing thing abt this game is that its not going to be released on ps4
Miles just straight up used the move that Miguel used on him
2023 is stacked for games, with this and Tears of the Kingdom
Dont mind me. Just waiting on the next paycheck to pre order the game
Anyone else notice that Peter is seemingly FLYING at the end of the trailer? Or at the very least gliding with Venom wings.
So this is not the beginning of the game right we don’t have to read any comics to get why Peter is in a house and genke has a drone
Please don't be just a temporary upgrade and then get rid of it in completely .... Do something new, upgrade spidey. Keep the suit but altered or freaking something.
🕷️💪
Reminds me of neil fisher from resident evil revelations xD
They just turned this into genshin impact with the gliding
Oh, ofc theyre shoving miles negralis again
Will this be available for ps4 or pc?
This is getting better and better
Peter Parker letting out his inner Sasuke
Imagine kraven was venom?!
Spider cop is back in the neighborhood. Can't wait to see him again. 👮
holy moly finally
I'm so excited for this GAME. It's a dream come true. Thank you insomniac for your amazing work and dedication❤ You always give as gem's keep up the good work.
10:48 man that lizard
kraven loking so good❤
Dumb. Tired of movies and games attempting to erase the original character while using the original character. Spider-Man is Peter Parker and only Peter Parker.  Miles needs to go.
The different style of music that plays when switching between Peter and Miles, indicative of their own themes, is an awesome detail. Can’t wait to play this when /if it drops on PC eventually!
bro i want this game but i dont have a playstation.. UGHH IT LOOKS SO GOOD
Still just Phailstation? Welp we'll probably have it in 3-4 years on PC too...
The video games are better than the movies now 😂
I really hope Peter doesn’t die I want to see miles and Peter have more games
This would get many new ps5 buyers just to play this game.. Meanwhile i'll just wait till it released on pc/steam, which we don't know when.. Play the waiting game it is then..
Please make more mobile games cuz we need the spiderman mobile games
DLC
If they don't add Bully Maguire Dance to it, Ion want it!!
I hope symbiotic Spider-Man is a boss fight
5:00 Miles learned that from Miguel O'hara
Yo they have gone completely all out on this, so hyped for the release
This looks incredible, but theirs one roadblock I can’t mentally get over. The enemies starting at 2:40 just stand there looking and waiting for you to make a move! Doesn’t seem smart at all, which In then doesn’t make Spiderman look as cool. Just my thoughts.
Never been a fan of spiderman, sorry but this is gonna be a pass
iS tHaT a mObiLe gAmE?
I guarantee this game took inspiration from the old spiderman games like Edge of time, shattered dimensions and web of shadows and maybe some other games. This is a perfect definition of retro style modern gaming where old mechanics in gaming are coming back with some modern twists.
Arkham ran so this could sprint
Arkham ran so this could sprint
Arkham ran so this could sprint
Between this and Zelda, lookin to be a good year for sequels
3:01
Sasuke!!!
I love the organic eyes and stuff on the black  suit reminds me of the movie version of venom
9/10 just remove miles and keep spiderman without all that another verse crap , its over the top , love spider man 2018, the miles morales game seemed like i was playing a game for 5 year olds If they a successor of him it would fit the whole movie/games better. Miles is the start of the loss of the genuine spider man. Game after this one you gonna be able to fly and shoot laser beam cannons out of their eyes 😅
When is the PC version coming? Again 3 years later? Because of the game, I don’t get an extra ps5
The web-swing slowdown is so depressing
I’m definitely pre ordering and getting the ultimate edition hard copy if they make one
Anyone else notice wraith who is Yuri from the first game
Fights look like mobile games ads
i like how we went from joking about peter and miles "killing" enemies in their previous games to 2:40  they're ain't no excuse after that one bro 💀
2:46 So we're just gonna ignore that he ate that dude?
Is it just me or peter in the symbiote sounds like english sasuke. Im not a anime fan but i know how he sounds.
3:00 mattpat is that you???
The 90s called! They want their edge back!   (This a compliment, not an insult)
ok now some people might disagree with me, but the first game is probably the most boring one and this is probably gonna be the most fun so far
The gameplay trailer is amazing but i am a Little worried about the frame drops, and stutters, im hoping that its just because this is an early dev build that those will be weeded out
Aren't there any authorities in this NYC?? - Seem you can just roll up and waltz into it with ground and air vehicles and cause chaos with no police or military ever showing up. XD Meanwhile, back in 2001 they had to decide to not use the teaser-trailer for Raimi's 'Spider-Man' with the Twin Towers anymore. - Guess NYC anno 2023 is really chill about invaders.
Out of all spidermans we ve seen so far only marvel spiderman and spiderman from web of shadows had attack and abilities that could generate symbiotic mass from their body . That means they have a little control over their actions
I know your here because they released the trailer for Spider-Man 3
Kraven getting it's adaptation to a movie as well its crazy. It's Spider-Man year alright
Imagine still trying do crimes while there are 2 spider mans and one of them being a savage now 💀
I can’t wait to play as symbiote Peter.
the final sentence says it all: miles is gonna fight against pete to free him from venom and mayybe venom will then bond to kraven
5:00 Miles deadass did the Miguel slam from ATSV
All fans: We hope this gonna be the greatest Spider-man game ever  Insomniac be like: 2:30
Jesus is King of Kings Lord of Lords !!
THATS THE GUY FROM FORTNITE
nice
They got the venom part perfectly
did  u guys see when miles threw the guy that almost got hit it looked like peter
Is the spider-man's voice is same as sasuke uchiha ?
guess he's gonna casually throw around the n word alot after getting the symbiote
“TIME TO GO BOOM BOYS!”
Just take my Moneeeeeeyyyy
Imagine if this came and on Xbox I would be so fricking happy
See you in 10 years when someone wants to relive memories of this game.
Will this be out on the ps4 too
"Cant lost Conners. Harry's dying, and hes the only one who can help." BROTHER WHAT
The setpiece when Miles is going after Conners through the pipe area and allat makes me remember the Arkham Asylum killer croc sections
Killer Croc?
Yesterday i finished spider man 🎉
This is very cool, bro, over there I can see that we are changing characters, this is very, very cool
Improve falling animation.
Task Master will return??? :O
I don't want any boring MJ missions this time. We need action.
I love the lizard design so much I never like the lizard having a human like face I wanted a monster like lizard so this is perfect
I’m glad leaven killed that guy with the goofy ahh haircut
ITS GONNA BE FIRE
Will it be free for ps plus premium?
Sad they didn't use the spiderverse miles voice actor
Ok so I know this is a big request, but pls think about doing a silver surfer game at some point.
He did the 2099 choke slam from actsv 5:01
Genuinely don’t think I can wait for this game to release its looks SO amazing. Yuri did an amazing job capturing the anxiety and mood difference with the symbiote. Bravo 👏
Miles feels he is in danger because Peter is different venom us controlling peter
4:30 How is no one talking about how insomniac brought back the web line!!!😮
For new and old times sake
Playing as symbiote suit looks really fun I’m excited for this game and also switching between miles and Peter for story reasons has a lot of potential.
2:32
In 10 years this game will be remembered as a masterpiece
So Spidy now going by the rule  " I'm not okay to kill my enemies  But I'm okay to give them permanent brain damage "
This game is banned in my country
Venom tease!?
Another thing no one is talking about is Kurt Conners! Camt wait to see some of the horror aspects this game will most likely pull
Aye fellas I just realized something I'm sure some of y'all are upset over the graphics looking like the PS4 graphics from the 1st game but if you think about it they finishing so it can look like the actual graphics of how kraven looked in the cutscene at the beginning of the trailer
already pre-ordered
Yuri is in the second game as wraith. Confirmed at 1:28
You wanna know what’s so great about this spider man series it’s like a movie franchise they keep adding on making it even more great.
Man miles really said KAMEHAMEHA in 4:59
Im very hype for this game!
The soundtrack is good. I like the music when Miles is web swinging and gliding.
11:49 bully Maguire feelings🤫
ummm spiderman doesn't kill?
I honestly might get a PS5 just for this game
Insomniac's Miles spent the first weeks of his career dealing with a corrupt company, a super-armed gang, ABSORBED SOME KIND OF NUCLEAR REACTOR AND THEN EXPLODED ON HIS BEST FRIEND, and now he has to babysit and cover for an overgrown emo boy who's supposed to be his mentor (no offense to Pete, I bet he's going thru a lot too). Man gets no rest at all lmao
Que Thanos Snap
I’m so excited for this
I like the yellow venom more then the new blue venom
GIVE IT TO ME
Cool
Man I wish they made this spider man game co op 😢 it would be so dope to play with ur friends and do missions like it’s GTA 5
One day this will become memory
Just bought the first one th e other day on PC. It’s just so good!
Apparently it’s only on ps5,so those of us with a ps4 that were waiting for this to happen won’t be able to play it . Thanks for nothing guys. 👍
They took both the previous games, combined it and made it a thousand times better.
Only 4 months left, Ocotber 20th can't come sooner
2:51 you can Swing the dog around and throw it b4 it explodes on the enemy. Nice gonna love that
Venom? ✅ Lizard?✅ Kraven?✅  Throw in sand man and you have Toby’s spider man 3 video game
Am i the only one that cant hear audio?,
Bro went from bein an uchiha to spiderman what a legend
Honestly, first game looked better. This one looks almost cartoony
The voice actor is sasuke for venom Spider-Man
SASUKE
Press button, watch cutscene happen, and do QTEs like it's 3 generations ago. Except this time with edgelord cringe.
Brilliant on Mute 👍🏻 the cringe dialogue from the first one ruined it but this on Mute is great or I should say Fantastic
I honestly hope that even if you lose the ability to use the black suit once whoever Venom is shows up, you can either get it back either as a reward for 100% completing (like in Ultimate Spider-Man), new game plus or even DLC, cause this looks absolutely amazing!
The put the original face back in right?
Peter sounds like older mysterion from South Park
I pray that it will be on PC eventually. the pc ports were amazing despite the bugs that I was experiencing.
( when  ur reading this keep in mind I mean when peter eventually rejects the symbiote) I hope peter is gonna be slightly faster or do slightly more dmg because he’s more experienced than miles or they factor in that canonically miles spider powers r a tiny bit weaker than peters but also to counteract miles invis and venom power and I wonder if their going to refrain from calling the symbiote venom to avoid confusion
4:23 my lord why dose his theme hit so hard during this scene
Let’s not forget that underneath that suit is a guy with the face of a rejected thirst trapper on tiktok lol. I miss the og face so much
I will be back of we stay alive and and I’ll see if marvel still doing like those masterpieces
I like how even when it shows the motto "Be Greater, together" the symbiote is attempting to swarm the 'Together' section, but Miles' electricity stops it. Nice foreshadowing to his role in helping Pete not to by consumed by the symbiote's influence.
Wby does the lizard look more like Killer Croc than the Lizard ?
I swaped from xbox so i could play these spiderman games best decision ive made
Bro's having no kids now 💀💀 3:09
See u in 10 years-cj
This is the game of the year
Hopefully u get to chose which style of web slinging you get to do like miles version and different versions chilled hyper casual awkward so tasm could be awkward and Tobeys could be casual
Legend has it that Maile Flannagan was also in the recording booth with yuri lowenthal and had to keep screaming 'SASUKEEEEE' to get yuri to do the symbiote voice
It will breaks records ❤
Cant wait for the PC version! The game looks very nice!! :o
Spider May Cry
i am never going to get of this game
Y’all are so gullible all these spider man games they keep dropping are the exact same game just different powers these suck
Imagine spider man 3 next in 2 years
For anyone still saying that Norman Osborn might end up becoming venom all you need to do is go back and replay the first game and go through the mission where you’re playing as Mary Jane in Norman‘s apartment when you find the secret back room where Harry is in the tank there are three purple hand grenades sitting on a desk right in front of the computer and they look very similar to green goblins. So I’m almost 100 percent positive Norman will be green goblin in this game story. A little Easter egg, big implication.
Wish I had a PS5😢
As a venom fan it breaks my heart not to have a ps5... hopefully they do a PC version
idk if it’s cause i’m high but this is so so so cool
Cant wait for people to say I MISS 2023😢😢
Since a little boy I been loving the comics, the cartoons, then the movies, but I never liked a single spider-man game.
*Can't stop laughing watching this video* 🤣🤣
I Swear This is gonna Be The Best Game in 2023
Pete still got jokes tho
I love how we’re seeing miles go from a young kid to a complete badass over these three games. He’s becoming a beast.
man i cant wait for this to come to pc one day i cant imagine how good its gunna look
To think in 15 years these will probably be bad graphics
Ok will the suit be damage for miles and make a neon one? Because thatll be awesome
This look so good holy its as simple as that
9:16 "time to go BOOM BOYZ"
I love Spider-Man
Peter needs to get rid of that suit
i can’t wait for this to come out
Just bought my collectors edition, I’m going to leave it in the package and resell it later on
7:35 OMG AC CHARACTER ☠☠☠☠☠☠ -Ubisoft fanboy
Here after pre ordering my collector's edition
11:33 The way Peter tosses that civilian and miles is like “wtf Peter?”
Iam very interested for this game boy🖤
If anyone is wondering I timed the swinging from 3:44 to 4:03 and it’s only 19 seconds and I tried to recreate it and the fastest I could get to the same spot taking the same exact route was 38.78 seconds in the Miles Morales game. So he was able to get there 10 seconds faster in the new game.
It will be better if this is toms voice or tobey or Andrew
im so hyped hope its gonna be on ps4 also
This gonna be more broken even than infamous
fun fact: Jim Pirri, who voices Kraven the Hunter, played Tori Vega's dad in Victorious.
Am I the only one getting chills?
Eren Yeager does make a good angry spider man
Peter's becoming more and more like Sasuke 😆😆
I’m sorry but when Yuri does his angry Peter voice all I can think is “NARUTOOOOOO”
Both spiders are seemed to be overpowered
So let’s see…we got Venom and the symbiote suit, Kraven doing his great hunt, and apparently the Lizard got mixed in somehow.  This game is gonna be awesome :)
This trailer is only 3 weeks old and even after Pre-Ordering the game and watching this trailer like a million times, The way Miles say "He's never like that." Still gives me chills, you can really hear it in his voice that he knows something is wrong with Peter.
I have a theory that the final boss will be Miles vs Peter, with the symbiote almost completely taking over him
Will Spiderman 2 comes in PS4??
Is this coming on steam?????
Miles: -I have more fans than you have (comment) Peter: -Realy  : ) (like)
This game looks absolutely amazing can’t wait to play it
I'll try this game fir sure, but I don't think that my gpu can afford it😁
So much Prototype in there
8:59 the sun didn't want to be part of this fight I guess.
Kraven the hunter❤❤  I like kraven on ultimate spiderman. They should've made this kraven look more like kraven, not a baby kraven
Finally God thanks
KRAVENS GONNA WISH HE NEVER CAME TO NEW YORK.
I remember being in class having just finished my last final when this trailer came up. I was watching live and I was really hoping for spider man 2, but when I saw the forest I lost all hope and almost clicked off, but when they showed the map of New York and spider man showed up I just lit up with joy, I was not expecting a full blown gameplay showcase, but I’m so glad that’s what we got. I am really looking forward to this game, and I know insomniac won’t disappoint.
So great seeing…hearing ganke again.
The way pete hits now is just brutal. That venom suit is gonna make him kill someone
"W Outro"
i love the murderous intent in peters voice and movements. You can see the way the symbiote is making peter more aggressive
c nul
i think i will watch this trailer many times
Yo imagine if there’s multiple Symbiot suits that would be so cool
omg the Bosses from the old game are going to be in this one because one of the profiles on the tablet has Otto, electro, and I think Scorpion and nobody is talking about it I'm not trying to brag I'm just saying it's Amazing how it got under a lot of peoples noses
Anyone else playing Spider-Man and Spider-Man: Miles Morales in preparation for this game?
Watereffects look terrible
Why does Peter sound like matpat
YOOOOOOO ITS COMING OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY 🥳 🎊 🎉
Spiderman in 2002: With great power comes great responsibility  Spiderman in 2023: I got teeth
I pretty sure Harry is venom as the ending of the last spider man he was in the water thingy with those black stuff but if I’m wrong it was just a theory
is it going to be on ps4 too?
5:01 after watching Across the Spiderverse, seeing miles do this feels different
Hi! Everyone been a spider man for years even though the comics and movie adaptaions have ruined peter character so many time! everyone is so hyped and its good to see that gaming is slowly but surely going back to its roots. Tell me what you guys want anything form the comics to be adapted into this great game. If you ask me i want that burial of spider man to take place which kraven does it would suit with that games dark atmosphere. Anyway tell me about your opnion and have a nice day. Brothers and sisters
You already know i'm gonna recreate every move in the trailer when I play this mission in the game.
Finally Bully Maguire came on the game 😈💀
12:09
Miles >
I know this is unrealistic but I really hope they revert to the old Peter character model, such a better and more expressive character model
I’m sorry were they GLIDING?! I didn’t think Spider-Man traversal could get any cooler and then BAM
PC release though-?
5:00 I can tell miles took notes from Spider-Man 2099
Guess who’s the final boss I’ll give you  a guess it’s PETER
i like how miles uses basketball terminology cause he’s black
What are they going to do with Yuri Watanbae
Only bad thing is baby peters face  Completely forgot they changed it
The swinging in these games is so scripted. I can't believe they can't do what spider man 2 on the ps2 did all those years ago. What a downgrade

I want sandman and green goblin in the game
The fact that we’re gonna have to wait till 2025-2026 to play this on pc. Oh my god I will be graduating high school by that time so stupid.
My only concern is that with the black suit, Kraven, Miles' story and Venom, they're trying to fit too many elements into one game, and it's going to end up being like the Spider-Man 3 movie.
Imagine new game plus letting you use the black suit through out the whole game
Its gonna be awesome to watch the suit evolve and see how powerful peter becomes.
I really hope this isn't the very beginning of the game.  I want to see how Peter even gets the suit before we can play with him in it.  It's clear that the symbiote is twisting his mind.
Any of you noticed the electricity of miles that means miles is going to save peter from the symbiote of venom
Going to have to dust down my PS5 doorstop for this one.
Yuri's letting Sasuke out to play in this one 😈🥶
Poor Miles... both this game and ATSV has the entire Multiverse against him.
5:07 miles does the exact move that Miguel o Hara did in across the spider verse to Peter
Bro I like it that now miles being more experienced he has new moves or moves he already had are better and Peter with venom boi in Peter is sick
I’m so fking sure no one can’t replace memories of this game
Man I can’t help but see John when o hear his voice
Ah in the multiverse we all experience this and we loved it everything we dreamed of the cinematic moments the suit we’ll see and see again and it will never not be good
11:54 watch the eyes…
I like how Miles is more mature in this section. He helps Peter when he goes crazy from the suit.
I still feel like the only one truly excited for Kraven. He looks so good. Do my man justice, Insom, I have faith.
pls be goty
Im surprised no one has mentioned that at the 9:00 part you can see the sun move to the right of the screen. 😂
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NO MARY JANE MISSIONS THOSE WERE SO ANNOYING
This gane❤
The exaggerated swagger of a black teen
did anyone noticed that lizard is an alligator
11:13 Did the homie Ganke have to scream into the mic like that though when his drone got tossed? 😂💀
BRO YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN MILES AND PETE!?
peter is gonna be the best character in this game
Blud is bugging
1
🔥🔥🔥
How much you wanna bet people will come back for nostalgia?
im thinking were about to have two masterpieces called spider-man 2
Can’t wait to see venom, hopefully they add a dlc for symbiotes in the future, or even better it’s in the game just not announced, countless possibilities and for sure excited💪
7:00 i hate this ganke, so, so much i feel validated that black suit spidey probably does too
this game will be on ps4 ?
Idk I have this strong feeling that Kravens going to end up becoming Venom. I know insomniac mentioned they are doing things differently. October can’t come fast enough
I hope they add facial animation when a thug is being taken out
2:49  MGR players: hey, i've seen this one, i've seen this one! Spider-man players: wdym? it's brand new!
When
Thats.crazy I just watched Spider-Man 3
Ngl i really like miles the voice actor and shi im really starting to love spider man again
I love whats almost the "raimi effect" with the lizard, how this feels more like a horror game than the last two.
This is amazing I can’t wait to get it when it comes out
Gonna be fun playing this on steam in 4 years at full price.
Waiting for peter to let out a "NAAAAARUUUUTOOOOOOO"
He sounds like Sasuke
Hi me in 10 years
I love how they had ganke screaming when they threw the bot at the heli🤣
LİKE THİS COMENT İF YOU LİKE SPİDER MAN LİKE ME
Spiderman went from being the best hero to be the best villain 😮
Bro just realised sasuke’s voice
I will come back here in future
perfection
Thebigdutt
Two Spider-Man's that's stupid
Kraven's theme is so dope, can't wait until October to play this game
Brings me back to when this first released, nostalgia
I love that Miles is now a solid staple of the Spiderman lore. 5 years ago NOBODY knew about him. This is so cool!
I think peter gonna be final boss in this game
This Is Gonna Be Epic!
This game looks insane definitely buying
they took some of the moves straight out of web of shadows, which makes me even more excited.
An interesting part I find about the Venom suit, while it does change Peters personality to more reckless and impatient, it also changes his USE of his *"spidey sense."*  Every step of this video, you see the selfless hero in him now taking a second seat to an angry, violent villain fighting on impulse, not tactic and sarcastic as he usually is. His spidey sense is no longer a gift to defend, but a weapon to dominate any in his way.  He strikes first and hard, yet seems slower to react to his spidey sense. Overconfidence? Or does he now welcome the fight knowing his new power.  *Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.*
Given that we can play as both Peter and Miles, insomniac missed a perfect opportunity to make the co-op/split screen.
Guys my friend works for ps5 I’m being for real it’s ok if you don’t beleive it but he actually works for pas5 and he’s working on this game don’t have to believe me it’s ok if you don’t but he does
This game looks beautiful
INSOMNIAC PLEASE, improve web swinging when strightly turning left or right! I feel like that's when the movement truly stops being fluid and I'm sure that real Spidey could change direction smoothly, with style and without losing that much speed, as shown in the movies.  There have been so much great deliveries of SM games but I still haven't felt right the mechanics that I mention, and I think this game has a great oportunity to improve it. THANKS FOR YOUR EFFORT and looking forward to playing this game!
That is some Bully Maguire stuff in the end😏😏
Strange how NYC isn’t burning in this one 🤔
Wish they would let miles hit puberty already so he didn't sound like a 10 year old squeaker anymore. Gives me a headache
You should make it two player so somebody can play with Peter and somebody else can play as miles
Great... web swinging is still not physics based 😩
by the time this game releases, it'll be 5 years since stan lee had died, time passes fast
I need a ps5 now
11:13  this part when Ganke screams annoys me since he’s behind a computer screen and screaming at something as if he’s going to die 😂
Swinging with Spider-Man is my childhood dream come true
The only reason to buy the ps5 dropped
Pretty sure we will see a miles morales vs peter parker at some point in this game
Can't remember his name.who is he
I came out of a coma not long ago and man…I’m so happy to see the first game did so well. I can’t wait to play this.
3:02 why he sound like matpat
I would like to play as bully maguire
My mom really said what movie is that
6:47 why is nobody talking about this hella fine entrance, God i can't wait for this game
fart
We are VENOM!
i think final boss fight would be venom + kraven
is that sasuke voice to peter while raging ,but is so cool and cold like in naruto shipuden sasuke while revenging
Why Miles's BioPower changed color from yellow to blue?
I *knew* they were gonna add the web gliders, it was teased as an item in the 2018 game
Imagine we get a live action spider man movie with miles morales
I’m honestly happy that they held out on giving us the symbiote suit in the first game, it’s my favorite suit of all time so I was kind of bummed but getting it in the second game as a gigantic plot line is going to be awesome.  Well worth the wait
can someone please buy for me a ps5 and d a big screen and this game :(
This is the only reasons why I want to get a PS5
5:02 bro really did the choke slam
Kraven is Yuri Boyka
Tears of the Kingdom fans, let’s start showing our true power now…
This looks the same as the other 3 game. Did they just copy and paste the whole game with just a new story? Wtf
Prototype actions
Love Peter (Spider-Man) OG & Miles (Spider-Man 2) 😎🔥🔥🔥🔥  this game will be awesome, since kraken, lizard and venom are in there 😎🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dude, why does the symbiote suit look like black spaghetti under metal plates? I really hope they change that.
At least bring the miles one to xbox
At least bring the miles one to xbox
'Like this comment if you like spider man
Anyone thinks that carnage will appear in the game?
Army in the beginning is from XCOM :))
That two characters is like two free fire bundle 😮😮😮😮
Ps4 ku entha game release aguma 🤔
I love this game Peter Parker :)
Crazy thing is that spiderman is voiced by the same guy who voices sasuke you can hear it in his voice
I can't wait to play this game on PC in 5 years
Imagine if Santa Monica did a “Planet Hulk” or “World War Hulk” god of war like game.
When you realize this is basically the plot of Spider-Man 3 video game but with miles and actually able to focus on telling its own story
So those who don't have this better get it bc I'm now playing it while watching this
Noticed his eyes got sharper and venom like when he said so do I? That was clean as hell
This just dawned on me.  Did anyone notice that we didn’t the face model for Peter at all…maybe they are going to give us a choice!?!??
SYMBIOTE SPIDEY YESSSSSSSSSSSS YOOHHOOOOOOOO
3:03 Blud channeled his inner Bully Maguire there
So peter got some new powers as well as miles doing extra moves. I wonder what the regular is going to be able to do
Really hoping we can get that Spider-Man venom dance
Well this ain't coming for ps4 right?
this makes me wanna get a ps5
what if the game has a rosalina boss fight?
I didn't wait full Spider-Man 2 just to be on the PS5
Its crazy how this is the first time Miles is seeing the symbiote meaning that peter got it recently in the story and hes already showing major signs of aggression he'll likely become more and more aggressive which will hopefully lead to Miles vs Peter
The cameraman is killing it
What if Spider Man Kills Kraven using the Symbiote suit and then when Peter get it’s removed the Symbiote brings Kraven back to life that would be so amazing and make history
When he said he got away from US I do t think he was talking about him and miles
Love that Genke battle cries as hes being alley ooped
That’s explains everything when he was talking bout it in the midnight suns game about venom to hunter
How did Pete know that alley-oop meant do all of those specific things?? Lol?
Add DLC voice packs from the movie actors
this game coming to ps4?
The true definition of spiderman 2 peter and milez
They need the live movie now that's all it's missing needs a new spider man 🕷 to marvel
Sasuke
Spiderman kungfu panda 😊
Spiderman bully😊
Can I play this on psp vita?????????
Can you play this on psp vita pls answer if you do thank you very much
See you guys in 5 years to relive this moment
Just gonna leave this comment so people know I was here.
We will meet after 520 weeks later
I need this right now
Xboxers crying in corner
I thought they would have new swinging movements but it's the same as the predecessor, which is a let down because with the black suit I thought he would have different swinging manoeuvres smh. But I'll still play the game though since I'm a fan of venom. 😁😁
peter sounds angrier
Do you think Matt Murdock aka Daredevil & Dr. Otto Octavius aka Doctor Octopus are gonna show up in this video-game? Because I had a feeling Matt Murdock aka Daredevil and Dr. Otto Octavius aka Doctor Octopus might make an appearance.
Hyped
How did you manage to play it? Or are you a game developer?
They should totally have the Sandman in this!
I can see that Miles has has gone better better with his bioelectricity 5:06
I hope we get more spidey spin offs. Imagine Spider-Man 2099 down the line
Spider man is gonna be the final boss or the symbiote
I honestly feel as if this games going to flop, it misses its simplicity and instead feels and looks more like the avengers game or gotham batman 2. I hope i can be proven wrong
What if Peter goes bad and miles have to fight him 😮 ,Peter vs miles
Bro Peter told miles move and he listened did you see how fast that web swinging was
Okay spider-man killed at least one of those goons.
Hyyyyppppeeee
can't wait!
Rdv dans quelques années les gars
Miles is the GREATEST SPIDERMAN we've ever SEEEEEEEEEENNNNNN.
It’s a canon event
Ps4 please 🥲🥲🥲
This reminds me of the spiderman web of shadows pure nostalgia
I hope we get an option to keep the symbiote and not to let go of it like we usually do
Is Peter Parker voiced by meat canyon
Look at the roxxon Bulding omg
Bro the sound of Peter is just like sasuka UCHIHA form Naruto it’s the same  voice
honestly one the biggest things i want back  is a feature from web of shadows where if you swing very close to the ground you’ll actually see spider-man running on the ground while still holding onto the web.
He turned into saskue
3:10 they should call this attack 'the jackhammer Kick©'
Can't wait to put all my points into symbiote just to have it taken away.
HEAR ME OUT. Kraven is gunna be vemon, think about It they’re both huge, and they’re both the main villains of the story, as far as we know, and I just thought about the first reveal showed Kravens and venoms voice coming from the dark ally but venom is the only one you saw. BECAUSE ITS KRAVEN
So excited to see where they go with this story. They have such an opportunity to make something incredible 🔥🔥🔥🔥 can’t wait
He got away from “us” he’s not referring to miles
black air-force energy
This feels like a movie
cant wait for this game im just very sad its not coming out on ps4
Only for ps5 :(. I cant afford a ps5. Mayber in 2 years.
Did you see the look miles gave peter when peter tossed the sivilian aside
Yo miles did the kamehameha
love the small spike that form in his eyes/mask at the end
Wraith Blackcat Prowler  Tombstone
I wish the spider man games where more parkour base
Bully Maguire 2.0
Podu maaassss uh 🤩
The chase scene reminded me so much of the uncharted 4 chase scene
Spider-Man doesn’t kill? Wrong Spider-Man does kill
Dont got no ps5 still watching the trailer 😭
Pete got now more Sasuke Vibes hahaha ! Love it
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What I'm most curious about right now. [Craven] to all the heroes/villains in New York Is it [Public Enemy]? If so, the match I'm most curious about is [Task Master vs Craven] Showdown I want to see the [master of imitation vs master of hunting] showdown.
She look like prototype
Just gonna point it out. Kraven and whom I am gonna call Discount the first hunter in the video....Discount seemingly is large and buff as heck he could crush bricks with his thighs probably. And you have Kraven here who is taller, stronger, and yet more stealthier than Discount. Discount wore less clothing probably so he could make less noize and not be weighted and he seems very skilled at hunting. And after falling for the dummy trick Kraven told Discount that he had been in his 'shadow' for hours and yet Discount didn't notice.   Now what we know of Kraven he is by far one of the most if not the most skilled hunter on Earth and could hunt down alien monsters as well. And is wanting an equal to hunt so his crew bring in Discount whom is quite possibly one of the greatest hunters of this generation since Kraven will not settle for less. So the whole shadow thing is either Kraven being as big as he is, is silent and stealthy as heck and Discount couldn't notice or Discount's reputation was a farce or he just isn't that good at noticing when he is being watched. I am going with the first option because Discount clearly is experienced and knows what he is doing.  This would mean Kraven despite his big size could sneak up on even the most keen aware of people. He is gonna be scary to deal with and probably we are gonna have to fight him on stealth.
October 20th 2023
the prototype vibes in symbiote mannnnn i love it
ROMANS 1:16✝️"FOR I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST FOR IT IS THE POWER OF GOD FOR SALVATION TO EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES" ✝️❤️

✝️WAIT STOP✝️it’s not to late to turn to God❤️Jesus died for us but the devil did nothing for us❤️God bless u all
October 10!!!
Why not for ps4
I can already see 3 potential bosses: Kraven the Hunter, Curtis and maybe Peter Parker
Oh its the voice actor that voiced rais in dying light, you already now this game is gonna be lit
God I cannot wait till this releases
Miranha ta mal hem
This game is going to be lit
I feel like this game is BEGGING for a Peter vs Miles boss battle where Miles has to talk sense into Peter re: the symbiote.
Real
this looks awesome! i watched it when it came out but just now commenting. i don’t a ps5 but this CRAZY motivation to buy one. also i love gankes scream on the alley-oop. makes him and miles seem like actual teens.
game looks amazing cant wait to get it!
The Sasuke coming out in Yuri in this one.
What’s with Peter being so angry
It looks great.
See yall in 2 years when this game is 20 bucks
Would’ve loved it if Peter said “So do we”
11:54 - Всё, давай
Lol, I have no idea why it hurts me so much to see Peter like this and still makes me so excited. I assume everyone feels the same way after playing through the first game
Will spider gwen be in this game?
"He'll wish he never came to New York!" Is the coolest most 🔥 line ever
Director: ok give us a evil tone  Yuri: my name is sasuke uchiha  Director: perfect 👍
The way they show us venom spiderman … 😵‍💫
Who else thinks it would be cool to see Ganki, become Agent Venom?
Still think it’s incredibly stupid that it’s only on PS5
Genuinely upset this Is a video i just really want to play this game lol
Lets not even bother with the Game of The Year Awards.
“It’s got big teeth” “So do i”
5:00 Miguel was really a good teacher
Okay but like can he say it now?
miles combat looks like he took inspo from prowler
Miles is my favorite spider man
when will this be released?
I guess I am selling my PS4.
5:00 he did the thing!
This is too good someone buy me a PS5
Aww 😢😢this better be fanmade it's unreal
i thing that the final boss will be peter
Peter got hundreds of reason to become a villain , yet he choose the right path
can it be played on PlayStation 4😢
Spidergame
Will this game come out on PC? I really want to play it, but there is no Playstation 5. If it comes out, in about how many years should we expect it?
I’m telling you…. It’s going to be Kraven the Hunter who becomes venom. I’ll wait for the phone to ring when I’m right because…. I called it.
Can’t wait for October 20th day one and I really love the box art
can venom still shoot webs when not in a spiderman host?
I don't get it. This Spider-man isn't... Superior.
5:53 bro his spider sense is really delayed
GET BACK HERE SHOCKER!!!!
"So do I"
You could see the transformation in perter parkers behaviour...His voice deepens too
This game is going to be great
Man this is why I swiched from x box to playstation
Marvels Spider-Man could be the road to the perfect avengers game, hear me out if they took an Mcu approach with already established great game they can start slowly introducing iron man and others and then give them their own spin off games with focus mainly on their own character development and arcs culminating in a video game where you can play as them all and then you have plenty of options to make great stories connect through the games… literally we need to care about the avengers for a game to be received well. And it also should be first player focused maybe co op as an after thought if it works but the last avengers game was ruined because it focused on co op instead of gameplay and story first
So let me get this straight. We’re playing a Spider-Man gam where Kraven is hunting Curt Connor’s as the Lizard, and we have to try and stop him wearing the black suit?  Now where have I seen that scenario before…
Why am i suddenly getting naruto vibes from this?!😳
Well the Lizard is going to make this game extra traumatic for Perer
I’m addicted to doing the perch takedown whenever I can 😂
This gets me so hyped. Peter is ruthless, leaven is badass, the graphics are fantastic, its got everything
Black spidermen super cool ！
Carnage mod brewing
That suit is weird;-; I would expect to see a little matte in the suit but its pure liquid and the design is weird too. I hope they make it better until the release
ps4 les graphic version please
I sometimes dream of being a potato
The gameplay very reminds me of web of shadows and the lizard reminds me of the big lizard in spiderman 3 game
I love how you can hear bits of Sasuke in Peter's voice when he's aggressive    That's Yuri Lowenthal for you
Same voice actor for sasuke !!!
Looks cool. Would be better if they didn't cram Miles into it. Hope you can not play as him
Wow, I'm stunned
Spider man with venom suit kinda like homelander’s character , he’s conceited and that appears when he threw the man he had just saved
Here's an idea that could make you a lot of money and that could make the fans really happy Marvel: Insomniac's Iron Man You could even take elements from the storyline "Extremis" that could also lead to Marvel Civil War: Insomniac's character driven story about the events of civil war and how it affected the characters individually.
2:26 😤 SO…🔥
The size of these lads mun
Wait I thought miles morales venom power color orange? what happened why is it blue now?
Reforge Gaming claims this is a timed exclusive and will release on Series X later.
Ey 420K likes 😎
Will be PS4?
W GAME
Do you think that they'll release it on PC sooner cause nobody got a PS5 🤔
I like how everyone is describing Peter new look like it poetry😂😂
Without a doubt this synergy looks amazing; especially Peters evil mood.
help me.
Can't wait to play this. Insomniac has never disappointed me.
Great game to be watched :D
im excited but its not on the ps4😭
Yuri Lowenthal is Peter?!
They got New york lookin like how it looks now
This is fcking insane
🕷❤️🕸
I am excited for this! But, at 2:31, I don't really like how the symbiote suit looks. Like, just make it nice and smooth, I don't like how it looks like armor. They will probably have multiple symbiote suits to choose from though so that's good.
when will be the pc version available?
I am positive that somewhere in the mid game we will see a fight between symbiotic peter and Miles. Where Miles is asking Peter to take off the suit.
I love how the Genke is just screaming as his bird Kamekazes into the gunship lol. He didn't have to, but it was a decision
See you
I wonder if Yuri will make an appearance in the game as Wraith like in the comics
These graphics are sick idk what people are complaining about
I will not lose hope for a co-op free roam
I want this🙂
Make spider man 2 on play station 4  🕸🗽😃
Game of the year looking real good. The past two were incredible. My favourite along with Uncharted.
The only thing i don't get why spiderman walks like hunchback crackhead 😅😅
Gameplay is different nice 👍
3 minites into the trailer and i already love it thats legit how spiderman blacksuit should work with the tentacles and everything i with venom speaks to peter like he does with eddie
I'm so freaking excited for the Miles and Peter dynamic with Peter going dark. It's going to be so emotional and I live for it.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS! I CAN’T WAIT!
Oh my god the voice actor for kraven the hunter is the same actor who voiced angelo bronte in red dead redemption 2 thats so cool
20 October everyone
I really had to ask my dad about spider man. Because my dad read most of the comics. I was shocked about what's gonna happen to Peter since he is covered in that venom
The villains of spiderman 2 of ps5 is Kraven  Lizard  Venom Green Goblin
I have a feeling that the symboite suit is going to take Peter over and he can’t harness the power of it anymore, it’d be pretty cool if he ends up turning mutated and as miles you have to fight peter  Edit: saw a comment that the “together” at the ending getting overtaken by the tendrils and miles’ lighting blasts fighting them off, this could actually mean we do end up fighting Peter
Miles has some freaky moves... almost like a horror movie how he can make people disappear. lol
cant wait to see my home town from queens yay
Atleast it was just like the movie when peter has a bad attitude when he got fused with the symbiote
October 20th the great hunt begins
My favorite details I noticed on rewatch was When Miles saves the fisherman not only does he toss him safely on a web bed but also catches and slings him a fish too, and when his friends glider gets thrown into the airship he is screaming like he is in the mech himself 🤣
Official: Spiderman 2 out 20/10/23
See you when the game releases for Puddlegate 2.0
I just hope the Peter parker model is improved. It's a bit stupid imagining the new face under all that rage. The old face would've been perfect.
5:01 my boy miles pulled a Spider-Man 2099💀
IT IS TOTALLY PLAYABLE IN PS4 as well i hope they bring it after the ps5 release
I know i’ll be back to this video in a couple years to relive the hype so i’m just leaving this here
when sasuke uchiha is spiderman
He may not be mean right now but remember Toby Maguire
Hello future people who came here for nostalgia 👋
In high intensity situations like the fish market/river sequence, I wonder how the player (when playing as Peter) will be able to control the Symbiote suit, or if it just instinctively will fling civilians away like it seems. Or maybe there will be a split-second quicktime option to gently put them down but it may not be worth considering gameplaywise, which would fit the vibe of the Symbiote suit!!
imagine being a pc gamer watching this trailer rn (i dont need to imagine)
Every time we watch this we are 12:24 closer to its release.
Insomniac can i ask you a favor? Please make falling look cooler during combat, or even after jumping, the falling animation is always so anticlimactic especially after an aerial combo u just boringly fall. Spend time on improving the falling animation please
idk, i just wanna see Peter in the PS4 original face again, not the remake ones...
I love that miles' bioelectricity is a cyan color in this trailer. Everything about the characters personalities are perfect to me.
3:11  Doctor: yeah... we got good news and bad news the good news is you can walk again in a few months Hanchman: whats the bad news? Doctor: the bad news is your never going to have children... *scene cuts to bigwheel drinking in the bar* Bigwheel: and thats why i want to get rid of spiderman for taking my future away from me The spot: your not the only one my dude
Look if we get a "I'm Done being a Friendly Neighborhood Spider-man." This game will be a masterpiece.
Can't wait to play with the Black Suit. I love how aggressive Peter is acting while Venom is bonded with him. I guess we could say when he got the new suit, Peter woke up and chose violence.
The same dude that play spider is the same dude that played Saskue listen closely
The magnetic field down low is still a thing, I don't dig it
im gonna buy it !
Im guessing that before they were looking for dr conner they may have an accouter with venom already or some how a piece of venom got on Spider-Man somehow
Jit got the choke slam from spider man 2099😂
I bought Spider-Man 1 remastered and redownloaded Spider-Man miles morales for Spider-Man 2
Думаю у Питера снесет крышу и Майлз будет его вытягивать из этого дерьма.
When tf did Peter become venom ?
Only thing I hate in this video is that peter shoots his webs not from his knuckles but from classic thwip thwip  animation why have white spaces like in the comics only to do it that way I don't get it.
Game of the Year winner right there!!
the voice actor of peter is awful.
One unique feature I would like to see in this game is Venom's boss battle having the spider sense mechanic disabled.
90s Spider-Man venom suit is mint
❤️❤️❤️Tobey Maguire ❤️❤️❤️
it's the guy from fortnite!
doesnt kraven kill spidey and eat his eyeball or something in one of the comics?
" i do not wanna be lizard food!"  😅
2:31 chills 🥶🥶🥶🥶
Miles is gonna be great in this game, bc of the two other games. This company did so well with their characters, and I can’t believe they made Miles just as successfully as they did Pete. Miles gon steal the show too, I know it
i’d love a new take on miles. like if his uncle dies specifically because of something to do with venom peter. then it’s not miles’ fault and it’s not a Peter Mentor that we’ve seen before. i don’t want peter to be bad but it’d be a really good dynamic for the future. my perfect game for this would be pete leading to Uncle dying and it being a battle between miles and pete until miles beats him and pete retires with mj and miles taking over. then if there’s other games i the same universe there’s more story but room for pete to have to come out of retirement
Spiderman’s VA is doing too much. The Miles VA is so annoying
Anyone notice at 11:34, when he “throws” the civilian to the ground, Peter’s eyes are a bit sharper and more “venom-like”? This might mean that he is slowly turning into Venom, and that might be when he gets rid of it and Eddie Brock becomes the Venom that we know and love, but I’m not sure. This is also backed up by what he says at the end of the trailer, regarding that he also has a “pair of big teeth”
0:47 my ears feels like probably Scott Adkins's Boyka speaking as Kraven. Maybe not.
a reference to Godzilla I feel like Sony handles it better than Legendary and Warner Bros. I know what happened in 1998, but I think Sony deserves a second chance. 8:25
PC gamers crying in corner🥲🙂
This is gonna be great!
I just now noticed that at 1:33 if you look at the raft it’s scrolling through multiple villains not just Fisk.
am i the only one who felt like the graphics are a bit off? the effects are on point but the world textures, the water scenes and the lighting feels so last gen compared to the remastered
-/:
Face ps4 no ps5 baby face
TAKE MY MONEY
YOO MILES GOT THE WEB ARMS TO WORK
< ! like this comment if you like spider-man ! >
Beck suite costumezation
Ooooooooooo im hyped
I was so confused at the beginning
Got an opportunity for the first Spiderman man coop game pls dont fail us
What daaa... It's amazing!
Yo I can't wait for this game to come out, I've beaten the Spider-Man video game original and the Miles Morales one, this one has got to be the best one out of all of them, YOU GET TO WEAR VENOM, AND I BET YOU'LL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO FIGHT HIM ONCE PETER KNOWS THAT VENOM IS EVIL!  Woohoo I can't wait
bro became more brutal than before and he have venom symbiote too
I dont like any spiderman game exept spiderman 3 ps2 and amazing seris and this game just becuz of venom i will definitly play it😄
GET BACK HERE KRAVEN!!!! KRAVENNNNNNNN!!!!
Chat is this real?
I was eating BEANS and then I saw this
They added A.X.L to the game wow
Bully Maguire is back!
Was 19 when the first game came out going from be greater to be yourself then be greater together is pretty dope
😂😊
I knew it why that voice was so familiar ! It’s Angelo Bronte’s voice from RDR2 ahah cool !
I like how Peter’s symbiote voice is essentially Spider Cop
3:10 symbiote spidey made sure bro aint havin kids again
Sheshhhhh🥶🥶🥶
hud so so
Alright who watches the horror movie cuz its similar and familiar with the same events and its scaring me 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
man trailer looks sick, worth the money fr
This game is going to be remembered as a Marvel Masterpiece
Ready
Venom Spider-Man: I’ma need them lizard cheeks.
.
Can I play this on PS4 slim 1tb
I’m waiting for miles vs peter
Marvel please I beg you upgrade from pa3 graphics
20/11/23
Hi
that was incredible . oh my god
Im really hoping that some of the suits make the symbiote suit look different
I absolutely LOVE the new lighting  Edit: Specifically the sunset lighting
This is so coolllll!!!
The new game about Sasuke Looks good
This game looks promising. I loved the first Spider-Man game and the Miles game, can’t wait for this to come out
2:25  6:44  They really went insane with the tendrils, and *_*we'll*_*  be here for it, every step of the way...  11:51  You sure? He's got big teeth... *_*So do I...*_*
I'm curious who's going to be supporting Peter since Captain Watanabe is going full on killer vigilante after the DLC
I really hope the devs keep the flight ability for miles
As a guy who still hasn’t gotten a ps5 yet, this brings tears to my eyes
The symbiote suit 🤩
seems like Prototype
Spiderman turning into sasuke????
I hope they better the hud
See you in 10 years just please remember Minecraft and roblox in ten years
I like how he throws that guy symbols of venom
Bro took "equal rights, equal fights"  seriously 2:55
Poggers
Steam release 🤞🤞🤞
Man I forgot that this game is only going to be for PS5 only and I only have a ps4 but I’m trying to save up for a ps5
Manhhh i wish this game will let us trow cars and stuffs just like spiderman web of shadows...in that game when spiderman has the symbiot suit he gets the other personality and can increase strength
That is...not what I thought Kraven would ever sound like
Cant wait for this dlc
Am I the only one who thinks this is similar to the prototype?
It's so sad like I have PS4 pro and this is only for a ps 5
oh this looks epic
Let's Goooo
No one gonna point out that kraven was in the gun ship that blew up 😭
Now this is a gameplay trailer actually showing us gameplay and not cinematic gameplay which most developers do to make the game look better. respect Insomniac
BASED on the  mils morales spider vers film  petter have a high chance to be dead hope its not spoiling anything
niche
Honestly at the beginning I thought it was Turok
I hope it has a ray tracing fps mode
the game is absolutely incredible based on this gameplay,but did someone notice that the water just didnt look good?
Hot dmn 🕸️ 🕷️
one of the best reveals
cool   game
I love the graphics and visuals of the game, it's mint perfect. My only down side is the cartoonish/old styled UI display where theres too much going on with it and colour. I would much rather prefer the Marvel Spiderman UI design than this.
Angelo Bronte gained some muscles lmao
goosebumps. this is awesome
I hope they explain why Miles' Venom Blast has a different colour now.
Nah man. MARVEL FIX THE SYMBIOTE TENDRIL SWING. IS IT WEB THAT COMING OUT? OR IS IT A RETRACTABLE SYMBIOTE TENDRIL? GET IT TOGETHER MAN!! HOW DOES THE SYMBIOTE WEB THAT SCATTERED ALL OVER NEW YORK MAKE IT BACK HOME TO PETER'S BODY? Unless that is the intention, and the symbiote webs are intended to find new host other than eddie brock
I don’t have ps5 and I want to play it so much
Black Spider-Man🔥🔥🔥
Graphic of water is so bad
Me: Why am I watching this 1000363782th time? Brain: Jus do it...👍🏼
Why the game not available in ps4 pls
11:31 i think this is suit effect
I would like to see spider man somehow take control of the symbiote at the end
Please let black cat be playable im on my knees
That light pole launch is insane
Wonder if j Jonah Jameson will return or better yet the Danikast
Looks fire        Totk better tho
Kraven the hunter black cat the prowler spider man miles
That symbiote suit looks awesome, hopefully Peter doesn’t turn evil and force Miles to fight him. Also that Alley ooo was so cool❤
God finally symbiote time
"So Do i..."
Is it only releasing for ps5
Y'all need to remember the fact that there is a collectable in the last game and it's a sample of the lizard to cure him but it didn't last
Looked up this video just to say, Gwen will be a playable character calling it now
Its like a movie
Wait when is it coming out again
1:55
PLEASE CHANGE HOW MILES MORALES LOOKS!!!
JESUS
I am straight up buying this
Epic
I love how brutal  symbiote spider man is
Ten million views in under 2 weeks is crazyyy.
This game is going to be one of the best games in history
Is Peter Parker Spider-Man?
Notice how he tries his best to keep cool while around Miles but let’s his rage fully loose agains the enemies
Imagine if we got a Wolverine game like this or Hulk
😮yoooo why this game sound so freaking fun!
PROTOTYPE GAMEPLAY...WHO IS COPY WHO??
The Web Of Shadows return over Peter.
4:09
Watching this really made me FEEL like Spider-Man
With the amount of copies of the first game that we’re sold the fans deserved better than this.
Am I the only who wants to see Spider Man do a Bully Maguire in the game?
I dont like how it's for ps5 only
Imagine getting to be the person that gets to do the gameplay
Who’s here after ATSV
Man I wanted venom back in the spiderman saga for soo long! Finally he's back!
Will it be available on ps4 ?
Everyone is talking about Peter and miles but can we appreciate how tough and cool kraven looks
The soundtrack is amazing
2:02
I LOVE IT
I wonder if Mary Jane will become Spider-Woman
This is so much to take in: Spider-Man bonded the symbiote while trying to save Harry, Dr. Connors becomes the lizard again, Yuri becomes a vigilante known as Wraith, and Spider-Man gone out of control because of the symbiote controlling him
awesome gameplay developers
Do you think this part will be released on PC?
I was hoping for a next gen experience.. 👎i tired of the same old cut and paste and the only thing new is graphics... its been like this in gaming for almost 20 years
I love when Peter throws the drone which ganke is controlling, you can hear ganke scream while he gets absolutely yeeted at the helicopter.
There's a lot of unassisted soaring through the air in this trailer.🫤
I like how it seems Miles and Peter are equal partners and it isn’t a sidekick dynamic. Both share the roll as spider man.   Tho I bet it would be confusing for New Yorkers lol.
This 10 minute clip is way better than whatever Marvel is making with the TV Shows and Movies now a days.
The Symbiote suit is really very bad and people when they say it is great know nothing about the original ! That pisses me off! The suits in this video is not bad when it has the original look from the comics and that's what it's about ! So the original is the original and the new ones are bad ! You can't make the new suits better than the ones from the comics, we real Spidey fans love the original suits we know, it's like eating black apples and saying they taste better than the original red ones... !
Im here
Way more graphics to l like that
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 who is that talking that’s not spider man
Fire🔥🔥🔥
This is going down as one of THOSE games
matpat, is that You?
Aye bruh as long as it’s on pc so I can play it I’m happy
Looks and feels like a linear plays-by-itself game in which the player is only a passanger to the animations happening on screen. It's a shallow scripted game that only targets an easily impressionable teenage audience which noone will remember existed in a few years.
So hype for this game totally my pick for goty
The water and the fire are awful bru
Hey hey
With Spider-man and wolverine Game it's time for Hulk do get his due..
this looks sick well done dev's
nahh that voice sounds like sausuke when peter has the symbiote
Is there gonna be a red ps5 like with the ps4?
I still havent beat 1
I love how peter says, “he got away from us” he’s probably talking to miles but he could’ve been talking to venom
You can see the suit’s eyes morphing into venom’s for a split second when Peter says “So do I”. Maybe it’s not even Peter talking?
9:37 best scene in this ♥️
Love at 11:55 you see Peter's eyes scrunch  when he says "so do I" in response to conners having big teeth
Man is going like a more extreme version of Wolverine or Batman
i love how they asked Matpat to voice peter parker!
Insomniac, you ARE THE GOATS!
It’s times like this I wish I had a PlayStation
Dude the “I have big teeth two” was vary cold 🥶
:)
The symbiote, working with Miles, and dealing with Kraven's great hunt. This game's story has a TON of potential
Absolutely Amazing
This game is so Legendary wow fanstastic feeling nostalgia while playing can’t wait to play it on my beautiful ps5❤
Notice how Peter at 11:38 says  "he got away from US". He is not taking to Miles.... it's venom speaking who always says "we us" etc
this is so amazing 🔥
Game of the year written all over this.
This is the best Marvel game I ever seen.
Who is The Voice actor for the spider man ( peter parker ) he sounds soo much like sasuke vc from shippuden
If this Peter was chasing Miles in ATSV it would’ve been over quickly
The best part of this is that Venom might not even be the final boss of this game. We currently know Kraven, Venom and Green Goblin (Harry) are going to be in the game but I have a strong feeling there's a forth one coming.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
see yall again when I'll be playing it it 2027
10:30 Crash Bandicoot style😂😂😂
I cant wait to see black cat or a villain that knows spiderman is kind hearted and can be fooled because of his caring nature, to try messing with symbiote peter.they will be scared shitless
Just finished watching Across the Spiderverse, please make this game good, the last games were pretty good but im really hoping for more (especially in regards to side content/quests)
Incredible
He sounds like angry matpat
I gotta say, this iteration of the lizard is AMAZING like he looks genuinely terrifying and monstrous, he feels more animalistic and wild too. I think insomniac is doing such an amazing job with these characters and the Spider-Man games. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORKKKK
Delen laki si les gusta spiderman
Spider-Man sounds like dark deku from MHA
Cool
Broooo im so excited for this game 🥹🥹😱❤️❤️🥹🥹
Peter: he’s mine! Miles: you sure? He’s got big teeth. Peter: so do I…  Me: that line just gave me chills!🥶
It would be great if you would make it for ps4,it would be cool
Please make this game even for ps4,ibeg you,please.
I wonder if that “he’s got big teeth” “so do I” line is  foreshadowing that Peter will become totally corrupted by the symbiote and become the venom we know, I mean this trailer shows miles venom powers DOES effect the symbiote, a Pete vs miles fight is being called to happen by loads of fans but I think that’s how it will happen, Pete becomes fulll venom and it’s upto miles to save him
The combat looks amazing   Edit: this might be an unpopular opinion I'm sorry
Only one word can explain this whole game : gas🔥🔥🔥
Probably wont happen, but i really hope we get to play as Venom..
Where is black cat???
Marvels Spider-Man 3 2028
Its going to be epic
I want to see this game in June  summer holidays
Sasuke's voice
the best game, I will definitely buy it for myself !!!
Cant  wait
I can’t wait until this releases
Also Insomniac I hope you see this, although I doubt it, as I have a request regarding suits. Please add a spectacular spider man suit for Pete like the one from the tv show and please add an across the spiderverse Miles. That is all I ask thank you 😁
It’s looking like game of the year 🔥
Ik we will be watching this gameplay reveal trailer after completing the game or after 2,3 years to relive the moment of this game but this game gonna be one of the greatest game of all time and will remembered for generations 🕷️🕸️ 🫶🏻
I used to always feel sad why peter couldn't use symbiote abilities as Eddie could even tho he has more natural power and combat iq . But this game satisfied me .
That ganke peter and miles takedown was sick
He became electro 😂 at 5:06
I do believe that this video will get atleast 1 view every day as Spiderman is the best creation of Marvel
Only thing that seems kind of annoying is the overlay. The bright colors seem kind of distracting and the 2 giant ability squares on the bottom kind of look unnatural. I would prefer if they kept the classic white and teal color instead of the purple and orange and teal
Why can't this game just be out now 😭😭😭  Oh yeah, Cyberpunk 💀         (Don't hate I loved Cyberpunk but the early release was rough lmao)
I loved Marvel's spiderman and miles Morales im buying Marvel's spiderman 2 day one the gameplay and trailer look amazing.
2023
love how its coming to a console that no one has and not ps4
Wasn't Miles venom powers orange instead of blue?
V E N O M
don't tell me that miles have to fight peter
Imagine this has some liberties of kravens last hunt
Love it!! game is fireeeeee
Bully Maguire is back
Call him Peter 🅱️arker cuz he got that DAWG in him
This honestly looks like it’s going to be the best spider man game ever
.......
Where Xbox at
Now This Is How You Showcase A Gameplay Trailer... Ubisoft Watch And Learn
Okay one thing I got to say.   Am I annoyed that Morales from Insomniac isn't in Across the Spiderverse?
12:14 you can hear venoms scream
Yuri Lowenthal's inner "Sasuke" was shown here.
I love this!!!! That's why marvel is better. Not just some God like dudes punching each other. So epic!!!
That fish market isn't in the original games, glad to know they're adding to the map
"he's gonna wish he never came to New York" God, I hope we get to unleash THIS Peter on Kraven and make him regret his entire existence
Kraken the hunter a cool character met in the Ultimate spider-man couple years ago
❤
Bro this is fire 🔥
Mark My words,  the ending of this game will be a setup for Carnage in Spiderman 3
dude will this be on ps4
Hopefully we can switch the faces in this game
Can not wait for those stealth/horror levels in the sewer with lizard.
YES WE CAN GO TO THE OTHER SIDE BRO
Looks mediocre, definitely not impressed in the slightest.
I hate how Bendis gave Miles non spider powers like electric bolts & webs and invisibility (including his clothes🙄). Like, when has a spider even turned invisible or shot electric bolts? May as well give him psychic powers super speed. Throw in some Wolverine claws for good measure too. 🤦‍♂️ I mean I like that they gave his some different abilities, but ffs at least make those powers spider oriented.
Now.. in 30 fps :D
bro why Peter thicc 🤨
i hate spider man
Can  you play symbiote Spider-Man again after game and venom
yessss!!!!!! omg i cant wait to play this and gave me goosebumps just by watching
I hope they didn't forget to add Stan Lee
The fact that Pete throws the citizen at the end then Miles is concerned really shows the attention to detail that they put into this
See you in 5 years.
Bro I swear. If they kill Uncle Arron. If I’m playing as either Miles or Peter. And I see Uncle Arron Die. I promise y’all. I will cry. He’s been my favorite. Just like I watched Into The Spider-verse I will cry
Err... release date. Plz?😂
Are we sure Peter isnt gonna hurt miles?
Sounds like sasuke after smoking a pack of cigarettes for years
Everything looks great and perfect PLEASE don’t delay the game🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾  But, of course if it has bugs, then delay the game if necessary
I wonder what will happen that convinces Peter he needs to ditch the symbiote….
The symbiote kinda reminds me of the web of shadows game
Yeah.
Why does Peter have venom powers
❤❤please come back  Iron Man
We are living in a crucial moment of gaming history…people years from now are gonna look back at this and be like “I wonder what the fanbase was feeling like when this was dropped and how they were anticipating the game…what a time to have been alive”
i shouldnt have to buy a gaystation to play it
I can hear Xbox players crying at the corner.
11:33 There was a lot of dirt flying into the air when he fell into the ground.  Some of that might’ve gone in his eyes.
Venom+ spider combination 💥
If there is a Doc Ock Vs. Green Goblin or a team up between the two (although I highly doubt a team up), that would easily make this one of the best single player games of all time.
Why did miles’ electricity change from yellow in the first game to blue in this game? Does it mean he is getting stronger?
Please release on ps4 to
Who is conner
Great  So excited 😆
3:10 Peter is going insane
Bully Maguire returns
Ouuu i cant wait i love the spider man game
This is such a good game but think about in ten years this will be old graphics
See you also in 10 years when you want to relive memories
Im pretty sure peter just gave them a coma and if he gets more agresive its instant death
Replaying this after Across The Spider-verse 😏👌
Looks wack as hell
I have a bad feeling about this. Gives me Prototype 2 vibes where they replaced the protagonist of the first game with another character.  The game will probably make you play as Miles Morales against a venom Spider-Man. Spider-Man will not be detectable by Miles spider sense because of the venom suit but the player will probably have to win a fight against Spider-Man playing as Miles and that will be a not so subtle way of the developers telling us how much better Miles is than Peter.  If that’s the way they go I am not going to like it.
There is a bit too much focus on Miles Morales. There are other side characters that characters that would be more interesting to play as like goblin junior or don’t have Peter be Venom and leg US play as Eddie Brock.  Miles Morales already had his own game so I think it’s time to explore other characters.
Кьюбайт
Peter Parker in venom suit is channeling his inner Sasuke
Graphics are mid
see u
What is the Spider-Man game called
Wow Remastered web of shad...... Oh wait!
angelo bronte is that you???
So this is what Sasuke was doing after he got released.
This footage is 4K on PlayStation's channel.
*IF YOU LIKE SPIDER MAN LIKE THIS COMMENT
thank you for coming to my channel... something valuable for me... I will always be present in every one of your videos
before watching spider man across the spider verse i wanted to play peter because of his cool symbiote powers. after watching spider man across the spider verse i wanna play miles now too. especially if they add the same suit he had and same movement they have in the movie. can’t wait
Looks like an easy buy to me, practically all of the new Spider-man games are top tier, well done, well polished games.
The fact is i don't have a console or pc still i m watching this🥹😭
Make a game where your can create your own character to be spider man with different suits I’ll definitely spend my money on that for sure .
That's another pre order
are these comments full of bots? there are a lot of additions in this game that have me questioning it... i have played through both games and they were great. Spiderman should not be able to fly. The action seems way too cartoony
is it just me or is the flying kinda dumb.... not spiderman
Bro
not a neck beard so idk why spider man is also static shock now. can someone explain? also why is there two spidermans...
I cant wait for this game to come out ☺☺☺☺
omg peter is so angry!!! IM SO HYPE!!!
sasuke was the right guy to voice peter parker
Lizard kinda looks like killer croc
I was about to make a hate comment on Kraven for having crappy motivation but I think I understand his character. I was thinking that he has terrible motivation for hunting random people who are minding their own business and have more important things to do than to deal with his predator try hard shenanigans. But I think he is a representation of the effects of poaching. Like poachers, he is a thrill seeking lunatic who only want to trophy hunt. He doesn't have any regard of what killing his prey does to the ecosystem, in this case New York. This is show but how he fires missiles at lizard while civilians are in the way. What I personally find crazy is that the criminals in this game have highly advanced weaponry, even sable had state of the art technology. But police have normal pistols. If norman gets re-elected in this game after not investing in law enforcement and allowing foreign security forces to brutalize the city, he has political rizz. I have a lot to say about this game though.
Geez that “he’s gonna wish he never came to ny” gave me crazy chills 😂 😂
I bet there gonna make the game for PS5 instead of ps4
This game is gonna be amazing
This is gonna be the most definite Spider-Man game in history but man that score by John Paesano from 3:31 to 4:04 just takes it to a whole new level! Studios definitely should hire him for more projects besides Daredevil and the Spidey games!
Man I can’t believe it’s been a decade since this game came out. Such a good trailer and nobody knew it’d end up being one of the best games ever made. Feel so nostalgic as I was 26 when I played this, now almost 37. (Yes I’m a time traveller).
I knew they would add gliding Les gooo!
I hope that we see Tom Holland portray this kind of Spider-Man in his fourth film. Symbiote suit Spider-Man will unleash devastating damage on Damage Control and J. Jonah Jameson for what they put him through in No Way Home.
Miles is saving the civilians, trying to take out the villains, watching out for spidey and trying to stay alive all at the same time.This dude is awesome 🔥
Un mal año para ser fanboy de Xbox y perderte de esta joya 💎
Man no idea what you guys are promoting but when is this movie coming out, I mean it looks like a fun thing to watch
wtf angelo bronte?
I can’t wait to play as miles to fight with symbiote peter
Some people are complaining about the black suit now and forgetting that in the last gameplay trailer at E3 they’ve changed some details in the final product compared to the trailer
Behold another one of the greatest of all time
Good game
I’ve played both games….Spider man 2018 And Spider man miles morales…and all I gotta say……I CANT WAIT
I like that they’re gonna introduce the symbiote after Peter loses pretty much everything. He’s at a low point which the symbiote will easily take advantage of.
This is not on 4K, this video should be appreciated on 4K resolution.
I can't wait to see the swinging videos with the Spiderman 3 black suit theme in the background
6:17 You can hear the Lizard feasting. This game is designed for Horror
Rais's voice actor
I was here
Gotta got get a job now
Spider-man 2 = 2 Spider-men
Now that you've added Queens and there is Venom in it, i want to race against Johnny
big L on that suit black spider man
I have 2 question 1. How would you feel if one of the game suits was based/was a Spider-Gwen/Spider-Woman? 2. If they did give us a Spider-Gwen/Spider-Woman would you want them to change the voice to make it sound like a woman or would you be fine with it just being Peter or Miles voice, depending on who they give the suit to?
if i dont see the TASM 2 suit in this i wont be happy
I’ve rewatched this so many times within the past 72 hours
Very excited for the game.  Only nitpick is that the hud for the abilities at the bottom looks out of place compared to the rest of the hud. But it isn't close to release so eh. Feels like Spiderman 2 may come out faster than Silksong, which is hilarious but also sad.
I hope we could get a feature to chose between John Bubniak and Ben Jordan’s face model we most likely won’t tho
We need more leaks
Ah, yes. The real Black Spider-man. 🔥🔥🔥
Just realized now there are two black spider-men.
This looks like it could be rated M tbh.
Okay just from watching the trailer and this I think the symbiote is gonna posses miles as well since in the trailer it stated it is looking for a strong host and miles and Pete are pretty much equal at this point
My reaction to both spider-men Peter: bad spider-man, bad! Miles: good spider-man, good!
Sasuke?
Symbiote suit gameplay makes me itch for a Prototype 3 game.
I wonder what skins they add
HOLY HELL I LOVE IT!!
I want this to be a part of the spider verse and featured in movies, make Marvel a buttload of money
I love when, at 3:47, the game switches to Miles Morales swinging, displaying the average exaggerated swagger of a black teen.
ah finally they made miles venom powers blue, glad.
So hyped for this game!
Who else believes them seeing venom in the teaser if more of a metaphor.   Miles sees the enemy, Peter sees who he's becoming
Game of the year🏆
this is fire
Comics/movie Venom: My weaknesses are sound and fire  Insomniac Venom: "gets hit by missiles and takes no damage"
I love it when Peter Parker turns out moody
And it's only a quarter of an hour..fuuuuuu….me. 😮
Violence in spiderman 2 is going to be more aggressive than in the previous game I MEAN BLOOD IN A SPIDERMAN GAME!! I'm so hyped
At 11:29 I don’t blame Peter for throwing that civilian face first on the ground. That civilian literally stupidly ran into where the gunship was moving to after crashing
my theory is that pete is going to brutallize kraven in front of miles near the climax of the game and the final boss will either be him or harry
Imagine a Spawn game developed this well.
what really irritate me is, in middle of the air, he start sliding even before he shoot the web, that doesnt make sense, good example is around 7:41, i recommend slower 0.25 speed
4:20 stealth 1000
Sasuke voice 🤔?!
Что за дерьмополеты на крылышках как будто это не чедовек паук а супермен какой то  Механика откровенно говоря такого полета реально плохая  В трейлере геймплея к первой игре была идеальная механика полета, не понимаю зачем ее уже второй раз пересмотрели и слелали хуже
Yuri, the bully
Gonna wait another year for pc😅
3:00 This Spiderman sounds like the one that was prepared to chase Shocker to the ends of the Earth. Kraven done goofed.
the Venom suit's hud feels like this game is in a cheap mobile game ads
Yoooo actual moving people in the building windows, talk about detail.
Man that game is beautiful cant wait
Man i cant stop hearing angelo bronte
11:54 hello sasuke
First, the symbiote suit is brutal, also it does a good job at showing it's alive and not just another costume and lastly, Mile's bio-electricity went from orange to the typical blue, I don't know if I'm pleased or saddened by it.
i can't imagine how peter new faces reflect to express the emotion from the symbiote
The title should've been Marvel's Spider-MEN 2. 0/10
This game reminds me of prototype wish they mead a 3rd one.
I kinda hope that Miles and Pete get a fight cause that would be badass
marvel turok !!!!! 🙂🙃
Let to bully MacGuire memes commence!
Prototype 3 let’s go 🔥🔥🔥
this game is going to blow the f*ck up on sales, as soon as he comes out
I want for ps 4 😢
Is it know already how peter got the symbiote on this game?
This looks like its gonna have a horror aspect
Oficialmente el hombre araña se convirtió en el hombre que araña
His voice is like sasuke uchiha ❤
I wish I could play it but I only got the ps4
Cool
Will this be on series x?
Ready for sub 2 h, Miles!
I love it but, i really wish i had a PlayStation 5 😔
5:03 bro got beat so bad he stole a move 💀💀💀💀
This looks sooo real.
:0
"HE'S GONNA WISH HE NEVER CAME TO NEW YORK!" It gets me hyped every single time. So few of the reactors react to it because they are so caught up in the gameplay. Yuri: Thank you.
You can see the way Peter is solving things, he threw that guy he saved onto the ground and just went, aggressively threw ganke’s drone to destroy the plane, and finally in the end acts all tough and sort of mean. The symbiote is getting the best of him
I’m going to punch miles spider man -
Spider man the most brutal I've ever seen
i hope we at least get 4 games in the insomniac spiderman franchise the fourth one can be abt peter passing off the torch to miles but NOT DIE HE will retire from spiderman work as a scientist rearscher or something, marry mj get a kid call her mayday parker and miles will be like an uncle to her, and even could be a mentor relationship wif mayday and miles
lovinn itttt  but plsss insominac give us a much better looking maary jane watson design
No one talks about this really, but it would be awesome if you can web in the air without losing momentum like in web of shadows or the amazing spiderman games. The cartoonish paise in the air kind of gets in the way
I love that little line Peter says towards the end: “I warned you about going after conners, now this is on you!” Almost like he’s justifying to himself that he can be more aggressive with taking them down or potentially harming them more than just a concussion.
Get the Game done we cant wait the hype is gonna kill me!!!
HES GONNA WISH HE NEVER CAME TO NEW YORK !!! 😈
Glad I'm getting a playstation
Symbiote Spider-Man!!! 🕷️
SASUKE!!!!!
Ugh Insomnia has me so hooked. And we still haven't seen the Wolverine Gameplay yet.  That's what I'm excited for
So pumped for this! I hope they fix Ganke’s drone voice though! It’s hard to understand and quite frankly annoying!
At 2:32 you could hear a little bit a growl of venom
Game of the year? Or too soon? The fact they got us switching between peter and miles...free roam gone be lite. It's gotta be.
I like where Insomniac is taking this, and I like where this is going! OH! Giggity
3:10 pretty sure he kicked that poor man in the nuts like 4 times.
Man i can't wait till Cory plays this
When does the game come out ?
Why does he sound like sasuke
I really like how be greater together isn’t one word. Together more than likely is talking about venom lol
I think this trailer is such a masterpiece. It shows off so much yet also leaves so many questions for what could happen. Some things I noticed were how Pete’s eyes shifted to look more like Venom’s eyes at the end. The man on the boat talking about the salt water tidal flat is more than likely going to be Eddie Brock (
I’m honestly speechless
Peter being aggressive gives me a Bully Maguire vibes
where the symbiote come from
Hey man
I think I just peed a little *Kung Fu panda voice*
You’ve heard of Bully Maguire now  get ready for Fury Lowenthal
Stick with the symbiote. Miles is a little bltch.
O MY GOOOODDDDD 😮😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
They should do when wall running we use the 2 webs to aim and zip the whatever we want
Is Peter gonna try and bite off someone's head if he has big teeth lol
Cant wait to put some dirt in a few peoples eyes
This is gonna be great. Can’t wait till we hear more about the Wolverine game too.
Same as top guy cya in 7 years when the algorithm randomly pushes this
I am so excited to drink GFUEL and play this game... if you haven't seen, GFUEL released some really awesome spiderman flavors and they look so sick.. kinda cool I can drink and play the same brand
i think the black suit will eventually evolve into the classic black suit without those "paddings" or idk
This game looks like it should be DLC, not a full sequel. I mean, reusing all the same assets from the first game and calling it a new sequel? Come on. We know better. Just look at Tears of the Kingdom. Overhyped DLC made out to be a full-fledged sequel.
hopefully this venom won't be a pxssy like the last one was
Man, these PlayStation spider-man games never disappoint
This game looks absolutely AMAZING!!!! Love the little details of how Parker saves the guy but then just tosses him to the ground, Miles even does a double take like "wtf was that pete?" I have a feeling half way through the game You will fight Pete as miles.... But... once you beat him and bring him back to the old parker I feel like the symbiote will get away finding another host which will become Venom and the final boss fight. Just a thought, but I think that would be SICK! -Also a super small detailed that can be missed, at 6:58 look at the back of Peters neck, you can see the symbiote moving, almost slithering
1 week ago.
Why isn't anyone talking about **Kraven** ??
Where and when I can pre-order,. Marvel Entertainment?
Bro if the villains from the other games im going crazy we got comfirmed black cat,yuri watanabe,prowler,tombstone,taskmaster,the lizard,kraven the hunter and venom.this game is about to be lit🔥🔥🔥
😂
Lol this isn’t Spider-Man 2
Tuff I own Xbox
This is just a banger

2:30 : **spider man 3 black suit theme plays**
Why'd you change the venom to blue
3:08 Bro ain't never having kids...😭
If I had a nickel for every game I saw which had Black-Suit Spider-Man dealing with Kraven hunting the Lizard, I'd have two nickels! And that's okay.
Kraven looks Hella dope! I'm glad the dev team put respect on his name 👏
Where is Big Venom from trailer?
idk why they do this game so child
Is this Angelo bronte’s voice? 😂
11:50 "Are you sure? He is got big D" - "SO DO I"
Did anyone notice that at the start peter had normal eyes but when he say "so do i " 11:54 his eys turn little like venom
Rip Xbox players
I love spider man
Oh nice
I have a theory. At 12:20 you can clearly see that the symbiote is trying to take over the word together but blue lightning (miles’ power) gets rid of it. I think this is foreshadowing that miles will get rid of peter’s symbiote in the story because of it.
8:25  Is it just me who thinks Kraven looks like Tom Hanks in this scene? 😂
THIS IS GONNA BE FIRE🔥
All you Xbox players are punching the air rn 😂😂
once I saw those take-downs I got super hype
🤩🤩🤩
Terrible graphics .. come on it’s 2023 😂😂😂
Have to wait longer for PC.
Finally the web of shadows spiritual successor
I love how they added the gliders to both Peter and Miles. Shows that they can glide than just swinging  Edit:Thanks for the likes
3:11 bro slammed him💀💀💀💀💀
I wanna see this in the future
GYAT
I NEED THE GAME!!
miles kok mirip monyet
😭👀👀👀
very excited 'bout the game 🤩 Can't wait til the game's released and to get my hands on this 😁
Poor xbox
That gliding mechanic is ridiculous.   He's pretty much flying at that point.
Busssssss
Cant wait to play it in 2025.
THEY GOT SASUKE UCHIHA UP THERE
Quise ver un gameplay de spider man 2 y termine viendo godzila 2023 :v
Pls someone tell me That is on ps4 pls 😭😭
Wenn is the game coming out
Why are the trailer graphics so bad
This is for future us for when we are going to see this and think this game cane out a long time ago credit to felixd3419
Hey do you know dying light rais is the actor of kraven
I wonder will Kraven succeed to some degree and bury spider man alive, just like in Kraven’s Last Hunt?
Marvel send me a ps5 so I can play this😂
se tiver um modozin coop vai sem mais perfeito doque já tá
Onb
That marvel employee was right! The gameplay does look like a cutscene!
Miles vs Symbiote Peter calling it right now.. 🤣
this will be a epic spiderman like ever before good memories will be created
can it also be ps4 and ps5
Wish this was on ps4 too
Ppl mad it in net York y'all missed sum look again while kraven is looking at the map there adding another Island
It looks like Miles’ bio-electricity is getting stronger. It used to be just orange, but now it’s cyan or light blue, too?
Love that Watanabe is a vigilante as well gotta feeling whatever her abilities are will somehow help Miles fight the symbiote. I like how it may be a thing in where she’s a mysterious hero then revealed to be a hero
The only problem i foresee with this game is that they're probably going to use the remastered character model for Peter, the original model was perfect, I hated the remaster.
lizard looks so badass
finally a sling shot mechanic
Peter of before: Really hero and funny  Peter of now: Hero (almost villain-maybe) and angry
Man this so sad i only have a ps 4
Spider man is my favorite game I am going to buy a ps5 just to play this game
I saw dead pool
What game console is this on and what is the game called.
So this is different to the main trailer then? the main trailer implied Kraven was hunting Spider-Man and then Venom turns up. See from game its peter with the Symbiote, rather than Brock and the Symbiote mutual bond which creates the Venom character. disappointed if we don't see Brock bond with it.
I just don't like some HUD elements, the rings in the air and the more clutter on screen but overall very excited.
The great hunt, begins
Love that musical transition from Peter to Miles
Pros : - Gameplay is good if it comes to playing 2 characters at once Cons : - PC (for now), XBOX(Sony bought Insomniac Games) , PS4 PS4 Pro(old-gen will not be supported) so you will not be able to play this - PS5 Exclusive Only (for now)
I hope the Spider-Man 2 game does not consist as much of repetitive combat and dealing with the same generic goons all the time, as this, coupled with boring circuit puzzles and repetitive quick time events like stopping a car full of criminals with the same weird animation are some of the things that made this otherwise spectacular game, a little worse.
siet für mich bisle besser als prototype aus😂
To me 10 years in the future, I hope you’re doing alright :)
The cool part is that Spider-Man is voice by the same actor that did saskue
This is going to be an awesome game!!  can't wait
Yall better explain ( with a hilarious reference ) even though cool the finisher Miles used is SUS similar to a KAMEHAMEHA from DBZ please let this be an in-game thing Miles likes lollllll😂😂😂😂😂❤
Uchia peter
Man why all the good games gotta be on ps5
When Sony is actually good at there own game
Goty already
Hyped for it
So did anybody else peep Hawkeye at 7:34 or??????
I feel it's stupid to not bring out the game near time the movie is coming out from a marketing stand point
10:41 the most oblivious fool in the entire video
Make it for ps4 too
Is it on ps4 also or no?
Miles gotta save Peter from Venom (Venom final boss fight WILL BE SICK!)
I hope the game is atheist on ps4 too that would be very good because I can't afford a ps5
Love to see a Miles Live action film
Bro, how is kraven gonna hunt taskmaster 💀💀
I thought of prototype when i saw spideys powers
Sasuke in spider Man form???? I love this it shows the aggression of pete but your just like wow Sasuke 😂 (and yes ik its Yuri)
oof that black suit... big design ooof.
cant wait to need a 4090 and 500gb of ram to run 30fps
I hope he will make the dance, when peter get´s the black suit!
I can't wait for this game 🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕷🕸🕷🕷🕷😃😃😃😃
im working on fan fiction about these guys and every cartoon and movie but not done yet.
It was weird when peter said this miles_ he got big teeth peter_ so do i 😰😰😰
Sasuke Uchiha Voice Actor. Sasuke in a spidersuit
Bring on Wolverine!!
a series being able to hold up quality three games in is a rare achievement but so far spider man is looking like it’s gonna pull it off
the combat here looks just as fluid and fast paced as the last two which has me very excited
Gives me Prototype vibes
I hear a lot of sasuke whenever he sounds pissed
2:32 sasuke pretending to be spiderman
Why does Pete sound more aggressive now
Nice thumbnail choice
im so hyped for this game lol
😍
Love how the music gets a hip hop beat when it's Miles
Everyone else has sensible hopes for this game, but honestly my biggest wish is that we get to kill Screwball as Symbiote Spider-Man.
Miles turned into Goku
Do you guys remember the mechanic in Spider-Man 3 game where it got progressively harder to change suits? I really hope that’s in this game!
Where are the police/air force/coast guard? Why is a militant faction in weaponized cars, air craft able to run around New York without being blasted to bits by the us military and the national guard? Genuine question, is there a lore reason or is it left unexplained?
Cant wait see this on Xbox oh wait😂😂
11:53 Those venom eyes when he says to do I
Confirmed final boss is peter
Genke needs some kind of code name. Kinda risky to be using his actual name around these guys
dunno but i liked the movement and animations in the 1 one more. im always impressed tha when you see real gameplay it deosnt really look much better than the ps4 game
I hope we can play as Bully Maguire too
See you in 10 years in remembrance to this Legendary Game
Symbiote SpiderMan ❤❤❤
How to play pc game's on your mobile
It would be cool if angel is in the game and u can do  small missions
I love to watch Peter how he fights the soldiers im just like watching Spider-Man and Prototype game combined in this sample gameplay
Sasuke voice 🗿
LEETTTTSSSSSS GOOOOOOO
Джим, где технологии? Почему ты нам лгал? Почему графика в Spider man 2 хуже оригинала? Где обещанные выжатые соки из PS5? Джим где графика?
Today I have gone from being content with just a x box series s to wanting a ps5 as well also I didn’t think Yuri could sound this intimidating with the black suit but I was wrong bc godam he’s a really good VA
Insomniac: "No, there is no third playable character. Only Peter and Miles :)". **Peter Parker proceeds to become Venom**.
I love Marvel, I love the Ps5 and I love this Game
That's a perfect blend of Lizard and Godzilla
MIND BLOWN OMFG. Insomniac be covering all the iconic enemies of Spidey and the fact that we get to switch between Miles and Pete deffo means excess missions, side quests and collectibles god! And Connors giving a blended vibe of Lizard and Godzilla- and that dialogue- 'he has big teeth- so do I' and 'he's never like that' GOSH, INSOMNIAC MAKING VENOM'S ARC HIGHLIGHTED and so excited to see how Pete turns the anti hero and Miles makes him come back to reality or anyhow- Never have been more excited this much for any game since the pandemic gosh!
I love the "What are you guys doing !?" part  Clearly Miles is saving the man who was fishing but the Symbiote affected Peter doesn't care at all !!!
Miles saved him
Anyone notice that they still have not got the rights fo use the chrysler buikding that is a major disappointment as that building is arguably more important to the Manhattan skyline than even the empire state and i would think they would of come to some agreement by now to include it in spiderman 2 like it was in the first game
Топовое видео
&f1
6:44 Miles didn't sense Peter crashing through the ceiling, did he?
HYPE TRAIN
Sasuke
We seriously need to see Kraven on the big screen.
Not to sound mean but I cannot picture emo Peter's dialogue coming out of Scott The Woz Spider-Man's mouth. Please let me at least swap the old face model in the settings. If I can have a Ghost Rider suit in cutscenes then I don't think it's unrealistic to ask for that. The new face looks awful. The old one fit the voice better.
When he said “he’s going to wish he never came to New York” I got straight chills very well done voice acting.
His arms on the suit of have red now before it was black
Miles suit is different
From friendly neighborhood Spider-Man to Peace was Never an option
I wonder how bad the Symbiote situation will be, like if it’ll spread like a virus and infect thousands in New York. or if it’ll bring Carnage into the picture as well.
When I was kid I play Spider man 2001 and when somebody give me this game in 2001 I propobly die 🙉
Why is miles’ venom shock blue and not yellow anymore? Is it intentional or a mistake?
What Symbiote is that ( I think it’s venom)
Anyone notice how aggressive peter talks?
I forgot i was watching a sneak peak and not a 1 hour gameplay
I think the cherry on top would’ve been an approach for the Symbiote to gradually morph Peter’s Advance Suit 2.0 into the variant of the black suit we saw in this gameplay trailer. Taking cues from the Spectacular Spider-Man cartoon. I hope we get a boss fight of Peter battling the darkness within himself.
2:36 He's been beating the same dude up like Miguel did to Miles. Is there a connection I'm not seeing?
This game seems to be almost exactly the same as the ps2 Spiderman 3 game. It's got Kraven, the lizard, black suit spiderman, Harry Osborne, black cat, and all that jazz.
0:20 he looks ugly in this video lol XD
Action is too good, but somehow water feels like the old ones
I feel like if Peter gets out of control miles will be the one to have to bring him down😮
WOW
Mid
I might sound low Iq but in lore.. why does Peter ever even consider the venom suit, knowing that it will corrupt him or make him do darker stuff like this? It seems like canonically, Peter would never even touch something like that.. or maybe he loses faith after his mentor demise
The attack animations look so heavy and brutal, could cause a concussion
That was sick CANT wait to play I’m getting the second it comes out
It looks so good but it only on ps5 and I have a ps4
I love how they see him one bang the robo dog then think they have a shot with him😂
Black Cat, Prowler, Wraith, Tombstone, Sinister Six, Taskmaster and Shocker.
Dude, this is killer! It’s really come a long way
3:02 matpat is that you?
masterpiece 2 bis
What do you get when you have N and O?  Peter: 2:28
Bro is just sasuke
That was absolutely amazing. I am beyond hyped.
Bro where is this voice actor from I can’t remember
👍
spooder man is missing
just played it
L Game
Oh yeah. Best Spider-Man game all time?
8:59 Sun...
Miles is so water down bro like wtf why
A thing that would make the game better is multiple ending and multiple choices for things
Is just me or do the enemies take like 3 hits and they gone
8:36
2:53
2:30
Looks good but miles is as uninteresting as ever. Sony needs to stop trying to make him a thing
Harus main ini game nanti🎉
Y'know what I love about this? The fact that at the end of the game we probably wont be able to use the symbiote powers.
I want it
Whats up gamers. Cant wait to reminisce on this game with yall 5 years from now 🥹
All I gotta say is Goosbumps.
Hope if Insomniac makes a Spider-Man 3, we get Green Gobln.
My wallet's gonna wish this game never came out
Why is Peter using the venom suit?
all i hear from Peter right now is "Naruto!!!"
Pls put this on ps4
11:54 so do we*
Just laughing at the idea of Kraven quietly stalking in the shadows wearing that giant coat
GET BACK HERE SHOCKER!!!!
To the guy who'll re-watch this trailer after like 7-8 years so he can re-live this moment....  I hope you're doing good and I wish you a very happy life :)
Y’all saw Miles’ new Venom moves right?
Y’know, if i had a nickel for every spider man game that had you chasing a lizard while keeping him safe from kraven that also featured a main venom plot, i’d have 2 nickels. Which isn’t a lot but its weird that its happened twice
Can't wait to see Peter get rid of the symbiot suit in church
i can almost HEAR 90's animted spiderman scream SHOCKKEEEEERRRRR in this video
I'm really hoping Peter will say, "I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye"
So sick 🔥🔥🔥
Easily GOTY
If there was any reason to buy a ps5 it would be Spider-Man with Venom symbiot…….. (crying)
holy hiesenburg this looks insane
I love Spider-Man😍
7:59 “This is really really exciting” Couldn’t of said better myself.
But how does Peter get the venom I thought it was harry
"I survived because the fire inside burned brighter than the fire around me" -Joshua Graham
I hope they are gonna realese it on ps4
So now peter turned into sauske
Hearing Yuri Lowenthal’s angrier symbiote Peter makes me wish they would have sticked to the original Peter Parker model, rather than the new younger Tom Holland looking one. Woulda suited the original version better with that voice.
I was gonna say that Peter just turned into Sasuke in this game, but Yuri Lowenthal is so dam good that he's performance as an aggressive Peter is still very distinct in itself
I hope they relase in Xbox series s
I wish that it was also available for pc but it is ps5 exclusive 😢
Im here to set a history so i could get nostalgia from this historical moment
This is the best of game year2023❤
1:32 you'll probably miss it, but taskmaster shows up on kravens' radar, so that means taskmaster challenges are probably coming back
Sony &marvel👑❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I cant wait to play this i bet miles and pete gonna fight  at the of the trailer i think venom took full control  of pets
The Sasuke Uchiha is definitely coming out in symbiote spider-man.. love Yuri
Yuri Lowenthal's voice is impecable. I hope this comes to PS4 or PC after it realeses, if not then I may just have to get a PS5.
The tendril combat reminds me of web of shadows
I've seen this trailer like 5 or 6 times already and I still can't believe they reveal the Symbiote suit. The suit reminds me of Agent Venom with the armor pads and I love how it looks like it's alive. Can't wait for fall!!! I love you Insomniac keep up the good work!!!
A much better Kraven experience vs... The Beenox Kraven..
wild
This games is to good
Ok, take my money!
If this doesn't have the og animated series theme, I am rioting outside insomniac's office
Yuri gyat dayum Lowenthal 👁🫦👁🤌
This reminds me of Prototype games
Arkham was way better
Man Spidey Looks Legit In The Suit,I Wish I Could Play This Game🥲
Uh oh, looks like Miles has to stop Peter and free him from that symbiote? 😨😨😨😨
Spiderman was my favorite came of the last 10 years. It's the only non-sports game that i actually play cause it's way too much fun. Can't wait!
OMG!!!😱
Süper 😊❤❤❤
this is sick
Is this going to be on play station 4?
the graphics are mid tbh. Thought ps5 was powerful, what a lie
This game is already a 7000000/10 in my books, especially if we get a big Venom.
So from the looks of things, it's gonna include parts of brooklyn and queens!!
looks so good fr
I cannot wait for this game to come out 😭🤣🤣🔥
Pete hell he save the guy tthen toss the man 11:33😂
whens it going to steam
Guys was holding an M9 Bayonette at the beginning?
Why don't sony ever learn it's infuriating, too many villains in the lime light, so this is meant to juggle 3 villains in venom, lizard and kraven, 😂 this isn't gonna be that great unfortunately, sure its gonna be fun but not the next gen title we was hoping for, same arkham asylum style bad guy rooms and the same quick time events we all grown to hate in these games 😂
That’s Sauske
I fell the prototype energy
God the gameplay
I was waiting for it
amazinggg cant wait <3
I can’t listen to Peter’s voice actor and not think it’s Sasuke talking
10 million views and 400k hits soon 🙂👍🕷🕷🇮🇳
I wish they did it on Xbox that would be so cool cuz I’ll be playing it all day ever day but I can tell that they will only do it for ps4 and ps5
This game will one day be nostalgic
This is amazing, rewatching this one like 3-4 times
Ps2 graphics while y’all talking about “aww Petie is just so dismissive of Miles”. Dickridas
Looks awesome!
عاااااااااش علي اللعبة الجامدة
wow awosome
i love this
Game of the year
We Are Venom
Everything is great except for the lighting and the textures. Just think the graphics are worse than before for some reason. Like the textures of buildings, clothes, and especially the shadows are all a mess. They should really fix that before the release.  Maybe something like MW2? Scan real textures into the game. Cheaper and easier and it gets better results than the artists ever can produce.
Task master fight would crazy
bro miles hit one of the guys in the warehouse with a KAAAMAAAAHAAAAAAMAAAAAAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Sasuke? Is that you?
Looks amazing! Can’t wait till this gets released
I love that we get to play as both miles and peater
This game looks good great job insomniac ❤🤩
Is this true or editing?
e
I love the little detail at the end when miles tells peter that the lizard's got big teeth, when peter replies with "so do I..", the symbiote's "venom" eyes began to take shape.
Spidermann ist schwarz Ariel auch ? Und ihr redet von kultureller Aneignung ? Alter Erfinder doch einfach einen neuen Helden etc aber nimmt nicht etwas was schon existiert und ändernt einfach alles
This is ain't prototype 3 right? 😳
Imagine we get Gwen Stacy and she’ll be Ghost Spider or MJ is in the game and she becomes Spider-Woman. That would be nice.
Give us Prototype 3 fkin' idiots
OMG wait is that seam line under the mask going to split open into VENOMS TEETH?
letsgooo
When android version coming?
Can it be played on pc?
Theory: the end fight starts with peter fighting kraven but he kills kraven in seconds. And the REAL end fight then is miles fighting peter
Rip to the boys that died while waiting for this game to release. A moment of silence for all ps4 users that can't get a ps5 or play this game.
Please add Arachknight outfit in this game.
Im so sad this game isnt available on ps4
That actually made me jump 😅
spider-man 1: he's not killing people everytime he throws someone off the edge he webs them to the walls  spider-man 2: oh those people in the trailer? oh theyre definitely dead af
This coming out on pc too or no?
Can’t wait
The fact that miles said he has teeth Peter: I have teeth too  GAVE ME CHILLS 🥶🥶
awsome
Bro September I’m not about to wait that long It already revealed a game you still doing something on not game￼
I love that Yuri Lowenthal has tapped back into his Sasuke/adult Simon voice for an aggressive Peter.
holy
Really hearing the Sasuke in Yuri's performance here, and I'm not upset
Miles vs Spider-Man fight incoming
Pleas more content , thus game is the best game ever
welcome back.. we know this is not the first time your watching this.
it's definitely gonna be a scenes that we play as Miles and fight Peter
This was.... incredible....
this game gonna be lit asf
fireeeeee
5:00 Why did it look like Miles did The Kamehameha?
Really want to play this game but can we get a straight venom game
this is exactly what i've been waiting for, when he's with symbiote, become aggressive fierce indifferent not reluctant to go all out on his enemy even his friends. i'm looking forward to seeing him being addicted to it.
Bro. Microsoft should slap themselves 3 times. Missing out on all these 🔥 marvel games.... except for that latest avengers game. 💩 Was whack af!
web of shadows ahh game!‼️‼️💯🔥🗣️🗣️🔥💯‼️‼️
Miles really did a chidori/kamehameha
This game got Spider-Man channeling his inner sasuke
Omg😶
I disappointed with the zip animations. They look like they haven't changed from the previous game. When you can press triangle and zip to an enemy vehicle, it looks like a smooth lazy animation rather than actual effort from Miles to reach the boat/jet ski 8:05 8:14.  The web zip lines are amazing though. Hope they give Yuri Lowenthal a mode handsome face too
I’m buying a PS5
Time flies to fast see you in 10 years
I really hope we got blood effect 😂
nice
This video was really insane can't wait to play this game 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
i cant play it because i dont have ps5 :(
I like how despite having the Venom symbiote Peter isn't mean to Miles.
“I have an idea!”  Gaslighting Spiderman:
Symbiote suit spiderman voiced by sasuke is what I didnt know I needed
comon man just do ps4 too yould get more money
With those PS4 graphics. Why did I even get a PS5.
"New Hunting Grounds"   Black Cat - Glad to see Felicia's still active.  Prowler - More surprised that Aaron's still bein' prower, not complaining.  Wraith - OHHHHH THEY REMEMBERED. I SERIOUSLY HOPE THERE'S A PART WHERE WE SEE HER.  Tombstone - Somebody DID NOT learn. Silly man makes the same mistake.  Spider-Men and Lizard - We know why they're here.  Taskmaster - Oh dear god not again.  Kingpin & Sinister 6 - Still in jail. Nerds!
Venom man
I hope we will get a proper venom game after this game as we play the antihero
He’s fighting the suit as you saw when he save the guy but then again he’s not in complete control that’s why he’s more aggressive and told miles to stay back
Bring on Wolverine
when Peter says he got away from us he means him and the symbiote and when it says be greater together it must mean him and the symbiote
please make this game available  on xbox!!!!!!
11:32 I love how venom Peter just chucks the guy on the ground
This game looks 🔥🔥🔥
Literally the only thing that could make Spidey look cooler is if he parries an “unblockable” attack
My inner child is screaming right now. I am so excited
Insomniac has been on a roll. I cant wait till we get the first glimpse of Wolverine.
Sooo we gone just ignore the fact that sasuke  is playing black spider man ?
Alright... Miles and Peter will fight yah, but I'm starting to feel like Venom is gonna get a hold of Kraven by the end. Like after fighting Peter the symbiote hops off and gets on Kraven. Sounds like a pretty noice final boss to me
I think Peter is going to turn into venom
Hello future people who are commenting about how you miss this game. I hope new gen comic games are even better
Do i need to play Spider-Man 1 or no to understand this game
TAKE MY MONEY
I'm so tired of videogames games these days. Visually, it's the most cinematic thing you've ever seen. And then the gameplay is like press X at the right time when the obvious reticle appears on screen to progress through this interactive movie.
Kraven The Hunter has all the drip
I hope we see symbiote spider man and kraven fight
To the person reading this 5 years from now trying to remind themselves of the first time they saw this, I am here to tell you it was definitely as good as it was playing through it for the first time😊
I love how they did the symbiote suit. It’s alien like on the parts of the original “improved suit” so it still looks like he’s wearing that one, but with the symbiote attached to that one. Instead of a new suit entirely it just creates. I’m glad they stuck with the improved suit even after the hate. Same for the face change after the hate. Great visual imo although I can see why others wouldn’t like it
Really hype (Sorry for a late comment)
2:56 Symbiote Peter sounds like Krauser from resident evil 4 I'm noticing
The slingshot was a great addition! They need the ability to run down buildings and super jump off the wall run in any direction to add variety to the parkour
cool
"I"LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH"
PS4 graphics headahh
Brooooo notice how his eyes change when he says "so do I" he's slowly turning into Venom!
Ima LOVE playing as spider-venom lol. My favorite variation of spider-man 😈
Just another boring playstation movie game
Can someone make the lizard chase with king k rools theme from smbu please
I think the symbiote will destroy peter and he will be evil and fight miles morales and this will be the final game in spider man 😳😳😳😳😳😳
All I can tell in case they cure Connors that’s where he’ll exam the symbiote.
WAIT JUST A SECOND! So when Miles says " he has big teeth " Peter says " So do I ". So does this just mean that PETER IS VENOM?
This is God of War 2018 hype all over again. They overdid themselves with this trailer, is clear it's real gameplay. What I really hope for though is that these are just "trailer" graphics. I would be very disappointed (considering ps4 greatest hits graphics)
Bully Lowenthal
Peter in his black suit has the swagger of an angry young white guy.
Kaven's voice is the same Rais from Dying Light 0.0
Looks like a thrillride with stunning graphics!!! Kraven was brutal at start as if game is for older kids, 2:30 Peter's Sasuke voice is Soo cool 9:10!!! He's badass in Black suit, holsters are a bit extra, funny miles has electro abilities! Crawling through holes after Dr.Connors was Scary!! 29.5.2023
*LIKE Y COMENTA* si eres fan y te *ENCANTA*  spider man 😎
Has anyone noticed at the end when Peter said that “So Do I* you could see the Symbiote visibly getting angrier?
can't wait!!!
will this be for ps4 too?
2:30 🤯 YOOOO
Remember us... when you're ready for nostalgia.
11:12 Ganke didn't have to scream here but he did anyway to add dramatic effect 😂
Miles sucks. Wimpy.
5:03 well that sound will become addicting
How did Pete get the Symbiote in the game?
I just love the design for the Symbiote suit🔥.
Does this mean we’re finally getting a Spider-Man game with a bigger map than just manhattan??
when is pc coming
5:00 Spider-Man has perfected the Hadouken attack I see.
Is it possible some modder make it into new Prototype game?
some scenes are pretty unrealistic but for the rest it's fire!🔥
If im not mistaken , miles' electric ability is called 'venom power' in the game ,so .....Venom symbiote vs a spiderman with 'venom power'?
I want to play this but it’s only ps5 and I have ps4 :,(
Well this looks good
The way you can see miles zapping the symbiote  at the end, bro I just know this game is going to be breaking records
I thimk they're going to make a deadpool game😱
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMGBOMG
Marvel's Spider-Man: "Be Greater."  Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales: "Be Greater. Be Yourself."  Marvel's Spider-Man 2: "Be Greater. Together."
Way too much Miles. Worried about this
Super village on Playstation 5 the game  human spiderman  I see new haunted  demon juggler  wild tv game with my favorite
when is this coming out
Spider man  2 the game it now new action hero Vemon this are what of I power dark black Spider 🕸
This game will be complete if they had Tobey Maguire’s Black Suit from Spider-Man 3 as a skin in the game. Since they added Tobey’s and Andrew’s in the first game.
soundtracks top
I keep on coming back for Peter's voice and aggression with the black suit. It's incredible.
The venom suit is God awful
i cant wait anymore for this game game that going to incredible
awesome trailer hyped to go against connors riding along the water and i would like to see more of kraken and how venom will be brought in the story
At the start
This could be chameleon
i liked the one from 17. a tad bit annoying mini games but nothing to serious. not sure how they can top that. this looks too familiar. wasent really anything new except combat aspects with new suit and how miles made his own web lines.
I can’t wait man!
what’s creepy is that when peter says: ‘So do I’. His eyes changed a bit into venom’s eyes
Russian voices add please )
Yeah I wouldn't get so use to seeing Spidey in that symbiotic suit. It never ends well,the comics and the movies prove this theory💯
Can someone buy me a PS5
2:27 2:30 2:29
Why is Killer Croc in a Spider-Man game? Is he stupid?
Trying to imagine that deep voiced screaming dialogue coming out of redesigned baby face Peter's mouth is making my brain short circuit.
10/10 game rated let's goo, 🔥
The line at the end is definitely venom taking full control even if it’s for a second or two
i had doubts about how they would show venom's influence on peter but no more they fuckin nailed it 💪congrats
The sun @ 9:00🤣🤣
wow... perfect
2:27 gameplay
thank you God for helping me to enter the new generation of consoles quickly.
Why do they keep pushing black kid spiderman on us these days?
Perfection
Aquí nomás para decir que estuve aquí y en un futuro quiero revivir que estuve aquí , antes de la salida de este hermoso juego ❤
Человека паука с анимациями подвезли? Я человек, который не верит в чудо 😆  Кстати, как нибудь расскажите дегенератам своим, этим жертвам голливудских обрыганов, что вулверину как минимум можно вырезать сердце 😆
yall what if the guy in 8:30 is eddy brock
This looks amazing!!
Bruh I hope this is a real mission in the game
If there are any anime fans, you might notice the similarities between the symbiote Pete has, and the Guyver symbiote. Namely, the way it armors itself. The strands of the living creature wrap around the host and then creates hard, chitinous armor around them both. It makes sense to have the symbiote look a little stockier because of this and it looks amazing.
it will be very interesting for me to look at the evil peter who is always kind and jokes a lot
I got destiny vibes from the music around 2:00
From where you now the new controllers?
Cast Noah schnapp as Wiccan billy maximoff or nova Sam Alexander in mcu
Pretty sure green goblin is gonna be the last boss battle
10/10 game of the year
10/10
that alley hoop combo omg the teamwork! that got be hyped when watching!!
Incredible 🔥🔥🔥
Can't wait for a five hour story with boring mediocre combat
Were all my xbox fans at 😂😂😂
I'm so obsessed with this trailer that I made bunch of edits on symbiote suit, Dang Peter being so cold💀 He made me to edit this😅
Corny
I kinda hope they take some inspiration from web of shadows
5:00 Bro did a kamehameha
why not to playstation 4!!!!!!!!!!!
is it ps5??
When I was little I remember seeing kraven in my story book thanks for bringing back memories❤
I personally love that it isn’t just a suit this time around. Like he has different attacks using tendrils and even using it as a way to shield himself from damage. Giving some serious prototype vibes. Has he ever used the symbiote like this before?
waiting for full walkthrough.
Rewatching this for the 100th time
I bet there’s a miles vs Peter fight
🎉
I really hope they suit powers or Any type active skill By the way the combat system looks awesome hopefully it come out really soon
Looks like at least a bit of Queens is confirmed just from what i am seeing in the beginning. Im fixing to visit the city again next month so excited after seeing this
Am I trippin? Or does Peter sound like Sasuke? 😂
I came
Cant wait to play the game
Insomniac really made us enjoy just this teaser, given the fact they made us wait for this news for an year and a half
Not only that Peter is angry, but he’s also mad just like in the comics, good job PlayStation, and Sony executives, you understand Peter‘s great grief
Spider-Man is not playing around, he just threw that pedestrian on the ground
Miles bio electricity in this is blue?
Yellow to blue I see you miles
This looks super rushed, I think this could use another month in development
Anyone know the PC release date of this game?
If green goblin lizard or hobgoblin do not appear as boss fight i will be mad
These games are giving us what the films have tried but never could.
fire 🔥
10 yrs later i’ll comeback to this comment section im sure this game will be a cult classic
I only have a ps4 not a ps5 😥
It's ashame cos I don't play ps4 anymore because of how long since the first game came out does look good tho
Why do I think of the bicycle kick when I see Peter do that and the Final Kamehameha + the Final Flash from Miles in this gameplay 😂😂  Am I the only one here?
what i love about this game is when they're in a serious chase sequence, they still do their sick air tricks 😆
thats not the lizard thats the dinosaur 💀
Lizard, venom,who else ???😍😍😍
his aggressive voice sounds like film theory’s aggressive voice
at 8:59 there is a VERY strange sun shifting to the right...very weird to see this in a first look presentation and so on the nose...you can also see shadows moving on the bridge on the left
Guys yall remember when harry is getting the symbiote But ifk how pter got it or harry abandoned it and peter instead takes the symbiote
Why does it have itsv background music
2:59 you can hear the enemy's bones snap when he gets slammed into the ground.
YOOOOO AT 11:37 Peter says "He got away from *us*" and I don't think he's talking to Miles 💀
The music in this game is 🔥 especially when  Kraven the hunter says "The great hunt begins" at 1:43. Man I can't wait for this game to come out.
Моя 1050 ти сгорела уже с трейлера
Suaaaaaaaaskeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
11:34 the look on miles face tho
Are you telling me I can assassins creed them
2:50 TECHNOVORE!
Hahaha csnt even play in my crap laptop
ITS SASKUE UCHIHAA BRO SPIDER-MAN SOUNDS LIKE HIM
2:55 symbiotic spider man
KRAVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN, I WILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARTH
my only complaint is the graphics in general. Water looks very bad, and the graphics as a whole dont seem to have progressed alot since miles morales in 2020.
làm về chủ đề gì mau có sub youtube các bạn
We liked it
Glad that Peter is back I would rather play as him instead of playing as that black nerd Miles
After so many years game developers are still copying "Prototype"
Theory: this gameplay ends the first act of the game. The first act will be Peter and miles trying to track down Connor’s to help Harry but then Kraven shows up looking to hunt Connors and Pete ends up with the symbiote.   The second act will be Peter and Miles trying to defeat Kraven. The whole time, Peter gets more aggressive and reckless due to the symbiote, leading to a fight between Peter and Miles at which point Oete will remove the black suit. Then the third act will be dealing with Venom
press triangle
PG13 Prototype
dodi pls release this game
Ça doit faire 90 fois que je regarde le Gameplay 😩😩😅❤️
Imagine if there's a Marvel Spider-Man 3 & that 3rd spiderman is Spider-Gwen.. that'll be dope 🤩😆✨
Lol miles faces at Peter are funny
✊👊😁🙂
Mannn I can’t wait
11:48
It looks awesome, won't fuckin lie. I will buy a PS5 just for this game
Why does the symbiote suit not look like his normal red suit just like Tobey maguire from Spider-Man 3? 🤔🤔🤔
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩 ❤ Can't wait to see the gameplay
The new adventures of Spider-man &Robin
Imagine the other villains this game could have.
This game already looks awesome. Me and my friends might be playing this game at some point. The graphics in this are just on point.
We need more of this please
Earlier we used to play games, we play movies now.
No one’s gonna talk about Peters backpack?
I just realised we all know that Spider-Man doesn’t kill, but because of venom, at the very start he was just killing everybody.
If such a movie is to be seen in live action, then Avenger Endgame will fail maybe🤔🤔🤔
I wish I had a PlayStation only for this game 😢
dịch này lam gì sống vậy cả nhà
And the next gene will come out for a walk? It seems that everyone was fed with promises that they would squeeze out all the power - to show on the console - a new spider at its best. As a result, I do not see graphics or improvement in it since 2018. And if you take into account the black spider up close, it becomes a shame in general.
now i need a PS5. update: i have one and now i have enough for the game
Cant wait for it
I like the black suit of spider man it's just the suit just look so gooie and the eyes are not the same as the original suit
Just...wow 😮
Poor Xbox fanboys will never enjoy this masterpiece
I hope peter looks just like in ps4 marvel spiderman and not like the remastered one
if you look closely, 11:47, the white area of the eyes are animated too
This game is going to be industry standart for the future of ps5 !! Transitions from cutscene to gameplay looks seemles
Ok
Lovin how the symbiote's affecting his behaviour and the new fluid moveset.
11:32 I can't bruh, this just destroyed me. Its fricking hilarious the way he saves him and then gently shoves him to the ground like "here you go" lmao!!
i of the  nice game i have played
Awesome
I hate how this is a PS exclusive game and always will be because of Sony. Xbox has no Spider-Man game and tbh it’s the one game I want to play the most. Such a shame!
Batman has Killer Croc, Spider-Man has the Lizard.
Finally Kraven gets the respect he deserves
😉👌👌👌👌
Stop pushing this “black Spider-Man” bullshit. Spider-Man is white. End of story. Stop with this white replacement agenda.
John Paesano doesn’t get enough praise. The score in this gameplay is just outstanding. Full of tension and build up with a darker selection of notes, rhythms and melodies. I always love how he incorporates electronic elements into the orchestra. While his orchestra is smaller, he makes the most out of it. It’s more Daredevil style and how he scored that show.
Wow 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 !
Is it just on PS5 ?
Can't wait for a fight between Peter and Miles and then Venom. But this kinda looks bad too, the graphics or design.
The symbiote abilities are cool, and it's clever how you can get a feel of how its biomechanisms work.  For instance, some areas where muscles flex seem to have a wrinklier texture, as if the suit has room for expanding and contracting there, to increase strength.  However, that texture looks a tad gross to me, and to a much lesser extent, the rest of the suit's texture is a bit off-putting too (I know, it's the Venom symbiote.  It's supposed to be off-putting, but there's a good way of doing it and a ... less good).  Maybe the wrinkly, pseudo-muscle areas could have had a texture more like ... well ... muscles, or the chin of a blue whale, as in horizontal lines that look sleeker, but still organic, so that you get the same idea but in a more aesthetically pleasing way.  The way his mask's eyes indent into the face without any distinct border around the white with slightly rough, cutout-looking edges feels a bit off too.  Again, though, the game looks so cool otherwise and I love how they're leaning into the extremes of what the symbiote could do.
When did Miles become Emperor Palpatine?
Awful game, boring. The graphics are just awful and old. If this game comes out on ps4 it will be a failure
Was miles thicc or...
The fact they stand there as you attack someone. I’m a pass on this. 🤦🏽‍♂️
8:08 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This game looks properly awesome!! 😎👌
The models seems off for some reason
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
5:00  This looks like the chokeslam 2099 did to Miles at the new upcoming movie :0
It will be GOATED after 10 years❤
Yknow i know its never gonna happen but it would be insane if the game got splitscreen coop Would love to play side by side with my brother or something.
Pretty sure Peter is going to be a boss at some point
Anyone else notice how Miles has blue lighting and then when he takes the tracker out of the drone it’s yellow again? It might explain it later but just something I noticed.
I really want to play this game now!
Cannot wait to see the strain on Peter and Miles’ relationship due to the symbiote!
I hate the fact that it is coming for only PS5 first ಥ_ಥ
Absolutely magnificent! The black suit combat looks like the perfect mixture of the black suit combat from web of shadows and the ultimate stages from shattered dimensions plus insomniac’s own ideas. I also personally believe that this has the potential to be the most scariest version of spider-man under the symbiote’s influence because of how much he’s been through in his universe  Editor’s note: This version of symbiote influenced Spidey has the potential to be the second most scariest version. The first version is the one from Spider’s Shadow by Chip Zdarsky and Pasqual Ferry
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉حماس 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Imo there shouldn’t be a sybiote version for every suit coz that don’t make much sense, there’s should be a section for peters various “non symbiote” suits, and then a separate section for various existing symbiote suits throughout Spider-Man history like Spider-Man 3, web of shadows, comics etc. as well as the game original ofc
cant wait for this masterpiece 💥🔥❤
Be like Ironman fan❤🥺
Please launch in PC too I don't have PlayStation
See you 2033 in the future for now we watching on till then
I hope that we will get a shocker chase scene for the - "YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME! I WILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EAAAAAAARTH!!!"
5:00 Goku moment
Bro Peter didn’t even TRY to save the people on the fishing dock😂
Wolverine is gonna be phenomenal! 😳🤯
i need a ps5
Fun fact: Pete's symbiote suit design was highly derived from the xenomorph design
🔥🔥🔥
here goes 'infamous' knockoff
This Is Lil Fire ❤
Wow, just wow
Glad they made his webs actually black as well, the comics and classic cartoon made that a staple in him wearing the symbiote.
YO angelo bronte is kraven lolzzz
This giving me a web of shadows vibe
Okay, my money is ready.
Once I saw that’s wingsuit….
Kraven looks like Bradley cooper juiced up
The wing suit is so speed run worthy
I love Boswell his new abilities the thunder venom awesome I love we just focus energy average of a version of Kamehameha
I love to see me a combat and Miles Morales combat increase new abilities I can't wait does nothing wrong about the about Miles Morales new abilities and it's nothing want Spider-Man new black suit tentacles including the web slinging it looks amazing I left the same including the gliding awesome and craven he looks badass and Alyssa looks amazing to I cannot wait to play this game
Connors is like a mini-Godzilla
I love how when they throw the drone he screams
This is fire 🔥🔥, I can't wait for the premiere
ThIs Spiderman game is horrible. Basically is a movie. Not a game. You will make a thousand pointless combos while just pressing 1 button over and over... the cut scenes with "gameplay" are pointless... nobody has fun pressing 1 button while in a cutscene.  This was a gameplay without ANY gameplay. The only thing left that is good in videogames are the indie titles.
Excited!
Sounding like sasuke when hes angry so wild, ik it’s the vc
This looks crazy
This doesn’t get old after watching it a million times. Insomniac know what they’re doing!
Big Teeth 🦷  More Teeth We need MONSTERS
Was that the  kraven hunter
History is being made people
All aboard the hype train 🚂
why are the graphics so trash😭
Spider-Man has the sauske from Naruto voice actor
I just noticed miles still has his orangesh electricity and now has blue, i wonder if one is positive and one negative 🤔 just a thought.
Hopefully they kill Miles. Can’t stand listening to him talk.
I don't usually feel this level of hype for any game, but I'm salivating after watching this video
If Blizzard planned Spider-man 2, the symbiote suit wouldn’t appear after this trailer.
Leave ut Sony to put a spoiler even in the last messages.
Please make a official Spiderman game for mobile phone please 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
How long til it’s out on PC ?
This game is going to be so much fun when it comes out.  Also ready for any other trailer or game play coming soon.
Omg I guess I'm buying a ps5 after all.
Knowing that we can wear various Spider-Man suits in the last two games (if you add the Miles Morales game), I wouldn’t be a slight bit surprised if the Raimi Symbiote suit ends up in the game
Fire 🔥
At 5:00, Miles' Hadouken + body slam combo 👌🏽🔥🔥
I’d really like a mechanic in this game where when your just stopping random crimes as one spider man in the city you might randomly run into the other one and be able to fight together it would be cool to just randomly run into the other one throughout the city but not all the time so you can still do solo stuff
3:10 he just bycicle kicked this mans nuts
what is the name of the song in 0:41- 0:43??
TOO GOOD
This is amazing but I can't stand the hunched walk-running animation. Please for the love of God devs change ittttt.
Dude....I'm so excited about this game!!! The first one is still in my console constantly and I've beaten everything in it!   I love the subtleties of Symbiote Suit Peter in this. Like he isn't doing anything evil, just out-of character and overly aggressive.  Even down to how he doesn't give Miles Kudos for putting a tracker on Lizard. And no quips from Peter either.
Marvel Legends are gonna be dope
Personally I don't like the game's lighting at all. It should be more colourful like it was in the PS4 version. They should've used that version improving upon its textures and mechanics more rather than this boring lighting of sun's orange rays everywhere it's just a deal breaker man.
Spider-Man 2018 no black suit no game   Spider-Man, 2023. Yes, black suit yes game.
10 years
I love it so much
This looks gayer than aids
would've been better if pete said "so do we" would Miles said "he has big teeth"
Epic.
Kraven finding Pete and Mr.Connors meth lab be like
I like how Spider-man throws the guy down after saving him at the end. We all know the storyline of the black suit, but small details like that not being forgotten is great.
I love spider man 2
will it be on pc?
what gameplay? Glorified quick time events =l
I don't like the flying part...
I have a feeling they're really gonna overhaul mobility when using the black suit. Did you guys see Peter wrap around that pole when he and Miles did the alley opp? You can prob do that and so much more w traversal that they havent shown us yet🤯
I really love the depiction of the symbiote, it’s like its comic appearance with the venom movie appearance
I love how ‘Be greater. Together’ has two meanings for Peter: together with the symbiote, or with Miles First the tendrils show up, but then Miles’ electricity blasts them away. Cool foreshadowing for Miles saving Peter!
Looks so good
Ok so for ps4 we got the Be greater trailer. Miles morales gave us the be yourself trailer. What visual spectacle is the Together trailer gonna be?
3:10 the wall multi kicks look goofy but badass
Looks so good I just want new swinging animations for Spider-Man they looks kinda the same
I'm gonna watch this gameplay over and over until it's out this a masterpiece 😢
You can hear off rip how peter is changed. You see that hes all business, no jokes while the symbiote has him. The closes part he is to his regular self is when he called  that drone the murder bird. Miles recognized that something is up but he just doesnt know yet.... this should be good. This is a day one purchase for me.
I need this now
I could see this potentially being game of the year. Either this or wolverine. Good stuff
This is going to be the greatest spiderman game of all time
i dont know…
i like how they used the symbiote suit from the comics and just made it more detailed
It’s cool how he’s aggressive yet still saves pedestrians because deep down he is still Peter Parker.
the real question is: will the ai attack you when you are in special attack
the mod for the todd mcfarlane venom suit looks way better than this krap wtf
‘He’s gonna wish he never came to New York’ 🤯
I'm literally crying watching this. It is so good :')
Dude this is so much cooler than anything we’ve gotten in the movies in years
I think this has to be a somewhat lengthy game hopefully about 30 hours because this game is dealing with a lot and I can't see it being as short as the last 2
hermoso 😍
THE PAST game  Bye until someone wants to bring back memories of the game 🙂
So will it just be prepared 5 or will it also be for PS4 at some point as well
Did I see moonknight on that hologram?
Mixed feelings. Peters voice acting is a little cringe, and the web swinging is exactly the same except now they can basically fly which defeats the purpose of swinging in the first place. It appears the web swinging has taken a back seat in general which is not good. Like when miles was basically surfing to avoid Lizard, why not just SWING ABOVE THE WATER.   Hopefully its better than it seems to be. Still excited regardless, but as of now just looks like a huge DLC.
Sony: "How many times will you watch this trailer until the game comes out?"  Me: "Yes"
Nice PS2 graphics at 8:39
He’s definitely bringing out his inner Sasuke.
I have a feeling the game will be released around mid September to Early October.
At 10:16 that jetski flew back like something youd see straight out of a cartoon lol
11:34 “now get tf outta here” 😂
On ps4?
Without toby Maguire im not sure there should be a venom spider man without his cool walk
I kinda feel bad that petes character is agreesive and angry, i really liked it when he was funny
Did anyone see taskmaster 👀
THIS IS FIRE IM SO HYPED
*That Black Suit is 🐐*
That's a proper hype trailer. THAT'S how Kraven should be brought to the big screen
1:05 throws a buffed dude away like its a napkin, so much for physics.
I love the new black suit spiderman. I never really liked that Venom was an absolute demon on anyone else but with Spiderman hes just... spiderman. This version is what it should have always been like imo.
Finally the web gliders
THE COMBAT IS SOOOO HARD!!!!!???
i wanna play this game so baddd
Looks incredible my only critique is the eyes. I hope they improve the eye movement for both spidy's. I want them squinting and getting bigger/smaller more often, right now the eyes on the suits look too lifeless. Otherwise it's incredible.
Yuri is going full Sasuke Uchiha on this one.
At 8:49 peter is not only aggressive but the suit is already making him into the aggressive state  Edit:you can see it in his voice
Miles vs peter its happening 🔥💀
OMG OMG OMG OMGGGGGGFFGFFFFFFFFFGGGGGGGG
Very small detail I haven't seen anyone talk about but, when Peter says "He got away from us", I really don't think he's talking about him and Miles if you know what I mean. Could be wrong though.
I’m assuming that we are going to be getting Harry’s version of venom rather than Eddie’s
I feel like he should be Australian 😂
I was surprised when I saw craven
wow venom + spider man
Me moje
BRO HOW DO PEOPLE GET SO MANY LIKED
I am beyond hyped for this game, I think I have watched this video 15-20 times now it just looks perfect
Holy crap I'm hyped
They did the water dirty.
Leaving a comment to anyone 10 years from now coming to relive nice memories 😂
Ps5 players: what r u doing here? X-box players: me! Nothing, just hanging around.😂
insane
2:26 ITS HERO TIME! 🕷️🕸️
Felt like a movie😍😍😍🔥🔥
Oh heck no he totally killed those guys lol!
You know, doing the symbiote story arc makes perfect sense in this game. You do an incredible job with combat in the first game. Then you take combat a step further in Miles Morales. But going back to playing as Peter Spidey would be a major downgrade in terms of combat since Miles has cloaking and electric powers on top of the spidey reflexes and stuff. So how do you make Peter spidey more relevant in combat? give him the symbiote! This also makes sense due to what takes place at the end of the first game (The darker side of Spider-man I mean).
glad they're bringing back the tendril attacks but not sure about the look of the suit...
Jesus loves you
Do you think there’ll be a DLC?
I expect every fractal of a reflection to be included in the final product. If one reflection is not in the final product then false advertising!!!        🤣 I can't im sorry
LETS GOOOOOOOO
I cant be the only one that notices how badly the quality drops during the underwater sequence. Looks like a 2010 game. Other than that, the game looks amazing
Wow! Sasuke's cruse mark looks sick!
Amazing 🤍🤍🤍🖤
Excellent and attractive
It’s crazy for me to notice this, but I believe the character model used for kraven the Hunter is the same as one of the soldiers from love death robots in shape shifters.
peter is definitely the last boss or 2nd to last
Is it going to be available for ps4?
Would this new spider  man game only be for ps5?
Hey to the people who are gonna relieve nostalgia from this game in 10 years
CANT WAİTTT
1 day I will play this game even if it is the last thing I will do
Pure gaming nirvana!!!
wow
Who’s here in 2023???
11:32 The way he throws him on the ground 😂😂😂
This game looks really good but this doesn't look like unrel 5 graphics!!!! The gameplay is insane bit the graphics still look last gen. We really need these games to look next gen if they want us to pay 70$ for it!!!!
What a game ! Everything one can ask for !❤
Cool, into the diversiverse
Unfortunately, the graphical techniques they’ve chosen yield an overall presentation that looks outdated. That neighborhood looks like Hitman 1 from 2016.
This game finna be fire
Might go down as the greatest spider man game of all time
1:45 who's the voice actor for this boss
With how many amazing games are coming out to PlayStation and I just how on affordable PC is if Starfield doesn’t absolutely blow my head off as an Xbox exclusive there’s no way that I’m not gonna buy a PlayStation and shelf my series X
This video game trilogy is better than the actual Marvel Movies (except GotG)
Michael?
So, no one is going to talk about how Peter is Sasuke? Lmao
I hope they updated the parkour to be at least AS GOOD as a game made in 2009.
Gaming should be called something else cause it evolved before our eyes
This is basically a Prototype kinda game with the venom symbiote
Road to 10m views
Shoutout to me in 5 years 👋🏼
I don’t wanna play as morales ever 😂😂😂
Is the game out?
Bro we need a miles vs Peter. Imagine a boss fight against Peter with the symbiote, it would be so sick. I have a feeling we’ll see it happen.
Cya
sounds like attack on titan - TachyonSHDW 19:10 28/05/23 Sunday
Bro they even got gliding and boat takedowns. 100/10
This game looks so well-made. Sadly, I don't have a ps5.
THE ENDING IS PETER VS MYLES ITS VERY EPIC!!!!!
i love spidermannnnnnn
O LAGARTO PARECE A CUCAKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
The "BULLY" is back baby!!!
I’m something of a black spidey fan myself. 🖤
Why isn't it coming out on the PS4.
This better be out for PC at the same time. They'll lose millions by not doing that. Everyone buys this game.
this games gonna be on ps4 right?
Amazing detail, you can actually see Pete is actually not holding back more than he usually does, you can actually See a bit of blood, and changes in fighting style, and bones cracking when you play as him.
Bro I’ll be coming back to this like 10 years later and being nostalgic over it
I am literally wheather it's a gameplay or a movie. Awesome excited hope it supports in my Gcard
Wait a minute you got a different locations and cities!?!
😍😍😍
Omg I am so happy shout out the Spider-Man Sony is not pregnant, but never fails to deliver
venom fighting a freaking godzilla? count me in
Peter: “hey miles I can say it too”
Cant wait!
FEAR THE TERROR THAT IS SYMBIOTE SPIDER-MAN, AND THAT OF THE LIZARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Spiderman with venom and miles morales and the way they showed the switching moral side of peter with that suit it will get even more interesting 🔥🙂. As a poor gamer i can say i will play it someday but time to build my empire 🙂
I like how the enemies are blind, death and dumb
im getting the feeling peters gonna be the last boss fight
It gives me chills 😱😱😱
Yooooooo!!! This is going to be one of the Greatest F*cking Spider-Man games of all time!!! 🕷️🕸️🤯🤩😍🥰❤️💙❤️🖤🖤🤍
3:03  "HE'S GONNA WISH HE NEVER CAME TO NEW YORK!' That's some agression I like.
why does this have to be ps5 exclusive😭😭😭
5:02 Bro my dude took that choke slammer move from Spiderman 2099.
Yuri lowenthal did AMAZING work on spidermans voice dude holyyyyy the voice of sasuke uchiha was perfect for this W mans
His angry yelling sounds exactly like the symbiote Peter from the 90 animated series
Please make it little cheaped it is out of my pocket for now
I have to wait at least 4 years to play.    -PC player-
I need this now
can't wait to get my hands on it look   to be twice the game its predecessor was the only one give out negative vibe about it is angry joe because not co-op.
it's sad it isn't ps4 as well
The flying is silly.
When on PC🥺
0:18 He looks like Abradolf Lincler!
Can't wait until fall 2024 to buy the game on Steam!
He is never like that...
Bro went from hi I’m your spectacular spider man to you blocked me on facebook now you are going to die
Man... this game will be a classic. Now I want to play the Spider-Man game for the 4 busy to get ready for this
Ok, I was cautiously optimistic about it but the second half of a video is a glorified cutscene. Why can't games just be games anymore? I'm not paying $70 to watch a movie. And that's not counting my numerous concerns about the story. I think I'm done with Insomniac and Spider-man games for now.
Can y’all please bring this to Xbox bruh.
I really hope that when you have to use the black suit only for story purposes, that we can have more than 1 black suit option.
waiting for the remastered version. 😅 this looks awesome.
If he’s that aggressive I wonder what he’ll do to Jameson
And this was just added to my Xmas list
Beautiful. can’t wait to play this. Going for a platinum.
The people working on these Spider-Man game’s definitely watched the 1994 - 1997 show. The voices and the villain designs are so awesome and on point… I love it  Edit: I just wish Pete was closer to the show than the actor they have playing him now. He just looks way too young and kid like. The Miles Morales spidey is cool too, but I feel like they should both be more of their own thing with crossovers from time to time.  Maybe they could bring back the old Peter Parker through å multiverse crossover 🤙
The only things im not looking forward to in this game, is seeing Peters stupid Tom Holland remake face -.-
Mfs with no ps5 (that's me)
Where's that port located in real New York?
Y’all change so much of the canon but the one thing you leave the same is that the black suit still makes people angry/edgy/evil? That’s the most boring part of the symbiote
bro we got like 20 seconds of spider man gameplay and 5 min of miles gameplay
Its times like this i wish I had a ps5
hopefully story wont be as disappointing as gow Ragnarok
Loved the first game, can't wait to play this one.
pc plz
Esse jogo vai ser muito top já zerei o Marvel spider e o miles morales esse vai ser massa vou zerar
Will it be ONLY able on PS5?
Beep
YOOO SPIDERMAN IS LOOKING SICK
Effort pays off
His greatest enemy is coming
楽しみすぎる！！！！！
man why is miles here as well... hate that guy
this looks so sick, can't wait!
I hope Insomniac learns from the fans/critics and doesn't force any BS stealth sections like last time. When i play this game i want to be playing as Peter and Miles and that's it. Unless they throw in playable Venom, of course. I sold my copy of Ultimate Spider-Man years ago, so i need my fix.
Can't wait for the dancing dlc and the pre-order emo haircut
Kraven the last Hunt | Vibe
It will be great if there would  be Hindi Language also available.  Like Hindi dubbed Marvel movies,   Though I know English but there is more fun in watching Hindi Dubbed.
Also when it says at the end be greater together the symbiote surround’s the together until lighting from I’m guessing miles saved it maybe it will be miles vs Peter so cool can’t wait to see
when will it come to steam and epic games store?
this game looks sick can’t wait to play it in 356,210,945,211.56275 days
Very Nice
Wish it was on PC. I would rather have a Sony-Store (Like Steam) than having to wait years to play the game since by then many have forgotten the game or already seen all gameplay and wont buy it since it doesn't have replayability.  Old Spider Man games like my favourite games. Like "Ultimate Spider Man (2005, Activision)" where you could play as both Peter Parker (Spider Man) and Eddie Brock (Venom). It was based off a comic book and it feels really like you are in the comic book in the game, highly recommend this game. I would love if they made something similiar to this one.  But here's the thing, you could play Ultimate Spider Man on many platforms and as of right now it includes Game Boy Advance, GameCub, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Ds,  PlayStation 2, Xbox and Mobile.  Why am I telling you this? Because I wish it was like in the past where Spider-Man was for everyone. People love Spider-Man and more people would buy the games if they were on as many platforms. Everyone cannot afford a playstation and not everyone is going to buy a playstation just for one game.    Anyways, it looks like a really well done cinematic game. Like a movie almost, but the grunts looks uninspiring as they usually do to hype up the villain, but the major characters looks great overall.  Combat looks extremely good and it looks like you can do a lot of combos or use different fighting styles, but the stealth definetly could need some more tweaks. For example destroying a robot and making it fall to the ground should at least alert enemies in the area and should be the last thing to destroy if you don't wanna alert anything. The voice acting seems really good as well.  Lastly based on the trailer it seems like we're almost always in an open area and it would be nice for a change if we were in a tight situation where web swinging is not going to work due to the small space, but instead using vents and wall climbing to avoid enemies and listening to what they're saying giving us additional information.   Great trailer, but I can't play it on release due to playstation and have to wait for it to come to PC : (
Spidey.
Prototype vibes! I love it!!!
The movie and the game came out around the same time! 🕸️ 🕷️
Im so excited to try it
Imagine playing this game with VR 🤯
ok yeah i gotta play the other ones. this looks so good . very excited for whenever wolverine rolls around
Bro this game is epic but we need more Peter gameplay and less miles gameplay
POV : You watch the video and you're happy but you remember that you don't have ps5 or ps4 or PC.
Venom has no chill, at 11:30 😀
Insane🤯
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
venom vs gelsin
Yo is this a Prototype remake?
Am I the only one that thinks the graphics look terrible?
3:40 I love Miles Movements in this game,the way he moves is Full of the exaggerated swagger of a Black teen.
Web of shadows but better
This is my 32nd time watching this
Cant wait to play on 8k 120 fps 5 years later it gets releaaed on pc
can it run in rtx3050? 😢🤣
круто, русский персонаж в игре))
All of them haters hating on suit and other stuff they are no fans of spiderman or this game.
Вангую финал, два паука дерутся друг с другом. Скриньте
Can't wait to play the downgraded version🥳
See you in 20 years when someone wants to relive the memories of this game
12:19 I think I could guess that Miles would be hit by the venom symbiote but failed because Miles has an electric power that can destroy the venom symbiote as shown in the words "TOGETHER" has a symbiote and miles' electricity destroys it, or maybe there's a part of miles VS Peter and Miles uses his electric powers to fight Peter who's already aggressive because wearing venom costume for a long time
I hope they have the mechanic from Spiderman 3 PS2 where you have to struggle to take the suit off
Nice!
Bruh Spiderman Sounds like Sasuke from Naruto anime
Spider Man 1 with mods
Miles: He's got big teeth Peter: So do I Maaan, that was venom talking right there. I'm so excited for this.
i am so excited knowing most of the game playthrough will not look like this when the final product gets released.😁😁
I hope there is some sort of trophy that says something like „bully 10 civilians while wearing the symbiote suit“
i love spiderman
Sooo Saints row reboot was heavily criticized (rightfuly so) and one of their main issue was the enemies AI watching you when you beat someone else... Fair enough but here it is the exact same, the enemies AI just stand there waiting their turn to get beat up and no one point that out...? Media bias...
pc?
One thing I've always desperately wanted from an open-world Spider-Man game is the ability to freely go through all the burrows of nyc. Not just Manhattan. But Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, The Bronx, and even New Jersey too. New Jersey and Staten Island, maybe even The Bronx might be too much to ask for. But Brooklyn and Queens alone would be massively satisfying.
I think peter vs miles final fight for sure
this is so gooooooood!
Feels like Movie
He’s a menace fr
W gameplay
THE SWINGING AND FLYING IS CRAZY PLS REALESE FOR PC TOO
when theres a new game and a new GFUEL flavor to go with it >>>>>>>>>
This game is going to have minimal to no loading screens also. Will feel completely seamless
It would be nice if they made a dark side of Spider-Man game, with blood and tragedies just like the comics. But marvel always reject the dark side of hero’s comics and only focus on the happy parts
See everyone when we want to come back here for nostalgia of this game. Hey future me summer just started and i graduated high school 2 days ago hows college and what carrer are you in now busines, political science, or some else ?
Insomniac: Make a really good game with a really good open world, graphics, And story and all, And then release it only for PS 5, And even worse, Release it maybe after years for PC too, Man, Insomniac is always really so stupid, I swear, LOL
will it be possible to play the game with a friend?
the game looks fantastic, shame it will not come to ps4...
Is it gonna be released on ps4?
Is it just me that keeps hearing the Symbiote Spider Man theme from SM3 every time he shows up?
Gonna have to download this game if I want to play all Spider-Man games
KRAVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!!!!!!!
Please Sony PLEASE make it so in the actual game spidey says "SO DO WE" with an actual venom smile with the teeth!! So miles goes like "woah"😮 everyone like this comment lets make it reach the studios! Lets make them motive!
7:35 this shot is just so cool dude wtf
Graphics look last gen af
I like how Ganke also went “aaaaaaah” as he crashed into the helicopter
Если бы мне сказали десять лет назад, что выйдет что-то подобное, то я бы расплакался. Но щас я взрослый мужчина и только лишь прослезился
Yuri lowthal sounded simple and easy going in the Last 2 Spidey games but in this one he sounds like a terrifying menace which is Soo cool
Him And miles def gonna throw down
Can't wait to fight Venom with Miles.
Me who played the first 2 games on PS4 and now I can't play this bc you have to have a PS5:😩😭
I need early access please give me this game early for the ps4 :( please i'll do anything
Thought it was a movie at first
Game looks decent but still not worth buying that toaster from Sony.
4:09 when are they going to work on their building textures and reflections, not impressed
Pp
I've never seen an open world game before that feels like on rails. Looks good though
The symbiote combat looks so much like web of shadows and i love it
EXCELLENT. This was better than the trailer for Uncharted 4 when it came out years ago. I am definitely getting this game!
Thought it was an Ole’d game cuzof graphics
Now Peter only needs to do the evil dance from Spiderman 3
Black suit Spider-Man?  TAKE MY MONEY
As somor who played spiderman miles morals and not spider man PS4 yet i use ps5 this this i like
I swear i have been waiting for years for a good venom game this ain't venom but it made me happy
Wtf..I've watched and played enough spider man ....this is wack
It’s good to see him like that. It’s been a while since we’ve seen symbiote suit spiderman 😍😍😍
xbox players still gonna hate
People who will watch in 2030
Do you think Natasha Romanoff aka The Original Black Widow is gonna show up or make an appearance in this Most Anticipated and Must-play AAA Superhero single-player or coop video-game titled Marvel's Spider-man 2 PS4/PS5 sequel video-game. 🕷️🕷️🕸️🕸️👏👏🤟🤟🤘🤘
*Prototype 3*
We defo gonna be fighting Peter having memories of spiderman 3 we either gonna fight him atop the church or atop the unfinished building site either way we all know venoms weaknesses fire and sound
I like the part they heard growling and Peter says,"Me neither"
I hope we get the Spider-Man 3 dance, it would be criminal to not make a reference.
I have zero interest in playing as Miles Morales. This game seems like a huge letdown.
xbox got nothing on this
Hell YESSSSSS
9M in 3 days is crazy better be multiplayer!!
Whooops. I pooped by pants 🤭
Y’all need to make a marvel legends marvel gamer verse Symbiote spiderman with wall crawling hands this time not one
Why does black Spiderman sound like Sasuke.
I cant wait for this game to release
will the game be on ps4 as well?
Marvel and Spider-man fans dominating this year (2023) again because this comicbook empire brand company called Marvel is unique and worth-different when you are superfan.
Miles "you sure?, he got big teeth Venom in peter mind " so do i"
I was expecting the game to go with the recent Spiderverse theme like the movies but this is honestly better. Now after the movies are gonna do symbiotes.(Not including Spider-Man 3) Also pay attention to the abilities at the bottom.(especially in the bottom left corner)
The small details on Peters eyes at 11:54
I don't see any difference compared to the previous parts. where is the promised no-compromise? Look at Last of Us 2 and previous Naughty Dog games. This is the Difference!!!
he is back Kraven the Hunter
Edgy Pete
BROOOO SICKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK I CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Pete sounding like a menace
cant wait
How much storage it takes, gb and ram???
This game will be something special
Is it just me or does Spider-Man's aggressive voice sound like his spider cop voice
Is this game going to be for ps4 and ps5?
This game is so cool 😎!! It shows even our greatest heroes can have limitations! That what Marvel Comics characters much more compelling!! Sometimes , the villains can be heroes also 😏!! Well I hope folks understand where I coming from!
Foda
I was a fan of the Spider-Man and Spider-Man Miles Morales games so I'm exited for this one
Is it just me but doesn't Kraven look quite a bit like Bradley Cooper?
Cant wait for this
I did not expect kraven to be A BEAST
That moment when you realize why Sony spent 3 billion Dollars on Bungie
This looks absolutely awesome
I hope by the time this game come out i done my college and get a job like 5years
I'm really waiting for this Masterpiece
100% the Marvel’s Spider-Man  Looking forward to do the same with this one let’s go! SPIDER-MAN ❤ PLAYSTATION ❤
Yes.. and that's why i go back to 2000's game , for they color , old graphics that makes a game look as a game.. true fact is that this is realism.. is not a game anymore.. games are dead from long ago
idk about u all, but i read a book in which peter had this exact black suit and to remove it he went near a huge bell and due to its sound the suit came off
1:00 Kraven getting that first victim's scent
This is Prototype.
👨‍🔬👨‍🔬👨‍🔬bros cooked
Please let there be a dance scene.
i lov what u guys done with the symbiote its so fluid and organic it feels natural, great work!
That doesn’t sound anything like Peter!
See you in 10 years when someone wants to relive memories of this game ❤
I'm sorry but...this looks  very last gen to me.   I don't see anything here graphically or gameplay wise that couldn't be done on PS4.
This about to be better than the first one. Symbiote Spider-Man looks sick!!! Perfect timing with across the spider verse too. So hyped
I don’t even have a stomachs sooo. I’m making a meme
im gonna get a PS5 soon hopefully and ill buy all 3 of these games in the spider man trilogy on this console. Combined with the fact that i have a ps3 with the amazing spider man 2. (gonna get 1 later)
Press triangle to win
ugh yamete
If we can main miles I’m being miles sorry Pete but if Peter has a copy of the black suit I’ll main him
I love this, I have a feeling Peter will be the new "Venom" in a sense.
bold of them to show the entire game early
I’m really disappointed in the poor graphics. Why do the buildings look like they belong on PlayStation 2?
l'hud et vraiment moche pour le coup sans parler de la mini map qui et immonde
Seem mainly to be playing as Miles, Spiderman is a side character in his own game in this trailer
11:06 buckle my shoe
Spiderman is weak and lazy, bruce lee is strong and intelligent
Is it just me or do you guys think peters gonna be the main villain.
lol warzone operator VS spiderman
nah bro, that's WOS 2
11:12 Genke screaming is the best part of this amazing attack
Please put A demo for the game
Awsome. I LIKED this.👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Xbox 🤔🤔
Hard!!
What do you guys think? Looks great! I'm hoping the story isn't contrived though... any thoughts fellow gamers?
Peter turned into sasuke real quick
This is leagues better than the New Movies
is green goblin gonna create his own sinister six now
Game looks dope. But I mean dawg can we get some challenging combat. I mean at least make me utilize a couple of my different skills.
This is totally amazing. I love how the attacks causes Spider-man’s suit to stretch and attack enemies.
Fcking sickk awe man
Am i the one getting hot by a game?
I don’t know why but I hope when I get the game near like the middle or end Peter start to bond more with the smybiote and makes him start to kill people and him and miles get in a big fight after defeating venom and he takes all of that smybiote and uses it and that how it makes Peter go crazy and fight miles then miles ends up getting Peter out of it and lock it up somewhere safe and then whatever missions they have planned
I’ll be here in 10 years see you guys
I love seeing the spider men duo! They are like marvel's Batman and Robin.  Wish there are more spider team family like superman's and batman's.
Cant believe no one's talking about Miles  using the jet skis to launch himself. I'm so excited for the web slinging and analyzing the different swinging styles that Peter and Miles do. I bet Pete's gonna be like "Oh you said he swing with the swag of a black teen? WELL WATCH THISS"
I hope the game will let you switch between black and regular suit and make the black suit look different based what you are wearing underneath
One word: Wow.
Sasuke stays slaying
Did my guy really do a tap dance on a guys face horizontally ?!
Yo those symbiote SPECIAL COMBAT MOVES THO 😫🔥🔥🔥🔥
Peter just straight up murdering the hunters
Xbox ain’t beating this.
Welp, between this, insomniacs wolverine and MGS 3 its time for a ps5
So Kraven has a team of hunters? Not a very compelling villain
Bro, the eyes when he says "So do i"....
😭I didn't play the first one yet..
😮u 0:16
If this goes on PC and those new powers it will be so fun
Yes, finally some gameplay!
5:00 uchiha miles hatake morales
Agent venom variation of costume for symbiote Spider-Man
Aye anyone else notice that the kraven music in the beginning is from destiny 2 season of the witch? 😂
mind blowing
Took over 5 years to make its literally just a large dlc of 2018 spider man doesn’t have better graphics better gameplay everything is the same pony boys will defend it but ps5 sucks maybe when it’s out on pc it will look better 😂
But is it coming to PC? Thanks
This game becoming a horror game that music at the end he got big teeth so do I 💀 I’m scared of Peter now
So do I 🐉
"Spider man doesn't kill" Also Spider man: 3:10
so that's gaming nowadays? a movie with a little player input?
Absolutely amazing quality and gameplay, I also love how peter is more aggressive but still continues to do "spider-man" things like he still saves people and tries to protect them but then just throws them 2 seconds later, As well as he keeps the same vibes Spider-Man would but he slowly is getting more aggressive like in his tone. Also thank you so much for keeping Yuri Lowenthal as the VA Some game devs don't typically do this but it makes it better that you guys did, It helps build on the fact that its still almost the same peter. Almost.
And Peter’s story FINALLY continues! Been waiting so long! 😮
The combat is better. But what about swing.? The people in Manhattan are so boring i hope they made it better to that from old versions. Little by little we get better Spider-Man games that's so good😊
Hope it will be a longer game than the miles morales one. 100% the game in like 20 hours
Please keep this comment alive. This comment is going to be updating you guys on how long until it’s ported on PC.
11:02 peter had a clear opportunity to stop the sign but ignored it, leaving miles to barely stop it and save people... what amazing attention to detail, well done insomniac
Tony Todd voicing Venom is about to be insane 🔥
Is that Sasuke I hear
I love the setup on the screen it makes it feel better. But i love how peter is so menacing and miles is just worried.
I love all the spider games which contain venom edition ❤😊
Anybody notice how miles’ venom power is blue now? Prolly cuz he absorbed all the Nuform
Que jogo fantastico, irei comprar .
"Gameplay"
Ahh so *that's* why they picked Sasuke's voice actor to play Peter Parker!
i absolutely love how the symbiotes affect on peter is showing and miles catches it when peter shoves the civilian to safety
I'll see u in the next 20 years in the comment, when u want to reminisce how good this game is
Is that spider fighter evlote version
R u serious sony…OMG can’t wait to play
Peter Uchiha
They could give venom an HR gieger look
I HEAR SASUKEEEEE
2:32  ...Ok, is it me...or is Peter _hissing?_
Puta que pariu, muito foda!!!!
I bet miles Morales is gonna fight Spiderman is a boss
Bro that suit tho amazing like how the eyes are made good job to the creators
Finally a look at ps4 spider-man as an actually violent one
This looks sick can’t wait to play this💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Bully Lowanthal
The attention to detail with petes actions are great, like how dismissive he is with miles, or how he throws the pedestrian after he saves him. Well done everyone that made the game
I have never played the Spider-Man games and I have not watched the Spider-Man movies completely after Spider-man 3, because it was cool and simple and it just seems so different now with all these new abilities. I prefer Batman.
Signs the symbiote is already corrupting Peter’s mind  2:30 When has Peter ever talked in this tone and manner?!  2:34 This whole beat down and everything Pete is saying   3:11 Speaks for itself!  3:20 Normally people would cheer when Spider-Man defeats evil doers but they were so shocked and frightened by his brutality they just watch in silence and awe  3:44 Completely dismissed Miles thoughts on the situation and cuts him off mid sentence   6:45 Crashes into the room while startling Miles in the process and even when he lands and sees him he doesn’t even announce himself  6:53 Miles tries to greet Peter but is somewhat dismissed once again and is only asked of Connors’ whereabouts   7:01 Peter also doesn’t greet Ganke either  8:49 He’s talking in the tone that is the polar opposite of the webhead we know and love yet again!  9:07 Miles says he is almost there to assist but Peter disregards him once more and decides to pursue on his own  9:16 I’m probably reaching but it almost seems as if Peter is EXCITED to destroy that gunship with PEOPLE in it!!!  10:48 Pete angrily asks Miles and Ganke what they’re doing even though not too long ago he wasn’t upset when they were chasing Rhino while causing who knows how much damage in the process  11:01 Pete finally agrees to let Miles help albeit reluctantly, listen to how he says fine  11:03 Speaks for itself, Pete didn’t even try to save those people so Miles had to do it  11:26 Probably reaching again but it seems like Peter was actually considering letting that gunship crash kill those civilians just to catch Lizard  11:32 Speaks for itself, after Pete saved this guy he just tossed him to the side as if he was just in the way even Miles had to do a double take!  11:42 Probably just me reaching but doesn’t it seem like he snatched the tracker out of Miles’ hand?  11:46 Miles is ready to resume the chase but this time Peter outright says no and says HE’S MINE as if he’s HIS prey!  11:54 Speaks for itself!!! If this isn’t a bloodlusted Spider-Man I don’t know what is!!!
lol 3:34. Switch to Miles? NOPE.
I kind of want to now buy a PS5 just to play this game.
THIS IS AWSOME!
I can’t wait
Not being on ps4 is so annoying
Cool. Mb best game ever
Yo
prototype vibes
I can't wait to play this 🔥🔥🔥
6:48 this scene is just badass
Nice 👍👌
this is a 2023 game?
So stoked for this!!..
Sadly it's not on PS4 😢😭😭😭 And 16 on trending!
cool but can we get Daredevil?
Sasuke
Ok I think it’s time to buy a PS5 now
Pitty that it isn't gonna be on PC until two years after the release..
Is Peter going to adopt an "emo" attitude and start a dance routine in a coffee shop in this game?
its all the same. over and over.
I hope the storyline holds up. Always play at hard
GOTY awards just became interesting
the water gameplay is ps2
Crane
i wonder if their going to add kids in the game tho
Ik his suit hasn't changed but I love Mile's suit in this universe, hipe they keep the gold variant and the BLM art.
I am so happy that they are making this game come on now Peter with venom 🔥
From the comments you can really see fans are enjoying the little details the devs put into this slightly evil version of Spider-Man
Looks good tbf
Hear me out...my hype lvl...IS UNMATCHED!!!
Love how ganke battle screamed when being thrown at the airship
Whaaaaaatt, I actually screamed like a little girl when i saw miles open the Wingsuit. I SWEAR INSOMNIAC DOES NOT MISS
Wow hope the guys at prototype know of this?
I hope its more Peter misdions than Miles missions. I really want the Miles missions to be every once and awhile and replace MJ's missions.
This is gonna be the best game ever made
Wow
I am kind of mad because it's almost for PS5 and I have a PS4
I can’t wait to play this game
You can hear the anger in his voice it’s like he’s struggling
I can only hear sasuke not spiderman
This is going to be the best one yet
Really i well destroy my gamepad in this game
This game looks exciting, can’t wait for it to come out! 😃
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is gonan be great
Cant believe it took this long for us to be able to make our own weblinez
I love how the symbiote changes peets personality
This game looks absolutely incredible and, for it to only be for PS5.. the graphics in the gameplay already look impeccable. I cannot tell ya'll how excited I am for this game!
The graphics look awful
Rip xbox
Goodbye r/SpidermanPs4, we’ll miss your insanity
3:58 Did anyone get reminded of just cause 4 vibes when he flew into those rings and visible wind currents showing ?
imagine playing this CO-OP!!!!!!! am i the only one ???
This remindes me of Web Of Shadows... Iam buying this game day 1.
What I wished we could have seen was both Spider-Man’s fighting, like on the ground. It would be so cool to see how that would work, I wonder if it’s going to be like Lego games where you can switch characters mid fight.
I LOVE the Lizard's design. I hated that crappy design from the Andrew Garfield movie.
Sasuke loves going rogue. Makes sense that he would go feral while wearing the venom suit
This game is going to be insane and Legendary. This game is unfUkn real
Never thought this would ever happen. A game with 2 spidermans to play as.
Kraven is perfection.
I'm excited to see Yuri as wraith
i love the symbiote suit so much omlll
I love this evil pete is cool af ngl
Wait, where is Paul? Why Peter is not miserable how I supposed to relate for this storyline?
I just can’t stop seeing this trailer oh god, super gooood!
0:06 marvel spider man 2 ps5 2023  and a new story begins  🌹🌹🌹💐💐💐🫶🫶🫶👍👍👍👌👌👌✌️✌️✌️👏👏👏👑👑👑💙💖💚💚❤️🖤🤍💛💛😍😍😍
I cant wait to look back at this in 2025 when Spider-Man 3 is announced
This game is insane
Lmao all I hear is Sasuke when Peter talks
Spiderman 1 - Doc Ock , Spiderman 2 Kraven/Venom? , Spiderman 3 Green goblin and Carnage with Peter and miles partnering up with Venom this time on Eddie? Love their approach how it feels like a movie. A lot of other big franchises could learn from them on how to incorporate our favorite icons to a great movie like story we get to be a part of.
Is this real
First of all, that’s an amazing set piece level/mission, secondly, I can’t believe they gave that to us for free. Makes me think; What are they holding back?
Miles vs Peter inc
I hope I would ever afford this one day
Too many stupid lines
The gameplay of the new version of Spiderman is wonderful, the map has been expanded and we are dealing with a unique story, but what disappointed the gamers was the graphics of the game, which was no different from the previous version, Miles Morales. Please work more on the graphics of the game, even if you have to delay the release date of the game by several months :(
THE FALL?😭
5:51 bro this actually made me flinch
HOLY FK THIS GAME WILL BE AMAZING
This looks incredible
Hope the story line is awesome ill  just wait and see how its gonna turn out  without reading to much about it before it launches
It's such a blatant Arkham series knock off at this point.
Hopefully @Dantdm makes a playthrough of this!
better than MCU
He can fly? That is so stupid.
Ok leaving this comment here and expecting that someone will reply me after like 10 years
Why did Sasuke become the new spiderman the symbiote voice though lol dope! 🔥🔥🥳
Can't wait to buy this game in 10 years when I finally get cash 😂
I loved that I thought that kraven was being adapted then appeard the original outfit  0:37
amazing  of this game
I recognize that voice, Sasuke Uchiha🔥🔥🔥
Don't make Venom a one-off theme. Please make it part of spider-man permanent feature in the ongoing series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  A spider man who can control the venom. Or start a venom game franchise that can go over pg18
ps3 graphics
Is this the sequel to just Miles Morales? Or would I have to play and finish the first Spiderman in order to follow along?
Waiting for the release on pc
Spider-Man web of shadows vibes ..
That looks so crazy great! Can't wait!
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that the symbiot spiderman suit is lame as hell in this version? Just a normal suit in black.... There are plenty of artists on reddit, pinterest, behance, etc with way better designs. This is just ..... not it. Symbiot spiderman was meant to be jacked with no visible costume lining. Please re-design this costume, not for me, for spidey !
cant wait to play this!
Prototype …
Yal eat this crap up ay? Spiderman fans have minus a personality lol
TAKE MY CARD
5:00 ain't no way Spider-Man just did a Kamehameha 😂
seems like new videos games arent even games you just have to basically watch a movie
Ps4 is gonna be like ps3😢😢
Spider man is the only game of this, which can carry itself only on its story. Even if they dont improve on their graphics or mechanics, i will still play just for the story
he sounds like sasuke
3:10  This combo was so cool!!!!
I really like his aggressive voice. I know some think its cringe, but it sounds exactly like someone who isn't inherently mean-spirited trying to sound angry, which I think works for Peter's character
So I’m really hoping there’s a side mission where you chase Shocker just so I can hear Yuri yell the iconic lines 😂🔥👏🏾
So they got Sasuke voicing Peter now? I know my anime
Now there are 2 black spider men
I want to play the insomniac games so badly but i don't have a ps5 😭😭 great trailer though
This comment will let you remind that this game exists always
Buying a ps5 for this
This game looks so good
"Mind blown by the new Marvel Spider-Man 2 gameplay trailer! Graphics, detail, and battle with Venom are incredible. Can't wait for the dark storyline and epic challenges. Insomniac Games nailed it again! Hyped for Spider-Man 2! 🕷🔥💯"
Looking at Miles' new abilities, I remember the character Cardiac
Peter went from “I’m your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man” to “peace was never an option” real quick
I love the fact that he saves the pedestrian, and proceeds to throw him on the ground afterwards. It shows the suit and his mind are actually fighting for his actions.
Why isn't this game in ps4 not fair
Hmm, a proper gameplay trailer. Now we wait to see if its trash or not. NO HYPE FOR YOU!
Can it be made available for PS4
Prodigy vs mentor 😤
So it's going to be the same combat of the last 2 games that tbh gets old at the half point
Notice how he breathes his last breath 0:57
Instantly got prototype vibes from the symbiote. Can’t wait for this
One omg omg omg omg omg ong
Please let there be the black raimi suit
Best Spider Suits ever seen in my life. Hatts off to creaters
Good game
Don't tell me Miles and Peter fight each other in the boss fight. Worse, choosing a side as a player. It'd make a cool idea though
that was fire!, can't wait to play!!
This is just Prototype 2 but with swinging
Fire 🔥
Dude, half of those henchmen are DEAD
I like how they changed miles's  venom blue
Жду обзор ixbt больше чем саму игру 😂
Game looks amazing
Hangi bilgisayarda oynayacaz bunu , bilgisayar odayı ısıtır heralde :D
Feels alot like prototype and arkham conbined, very cool!
The tour boat scene at 8:42 is a nice nod to the Spider-Man 2 game from back in the day, where there were side missions where you had to save civilians from a sinking tour boat.  This game looks like it will be phenomenal.
Peter didn’t hurt them. He killed them.
I hope we finally get to throw dirt in someone's eye.
The Symbiote Tendril Attacks by the Black Suit Spider-Man reminds me of Spider-Man: Web of Shadows 🕷️🕸️💯
2:56 Hopefully there are settlings to make the motion blur and camera sway chill *TF* out.. it's way too over the top. It's almost laughable. I understand they're going for fast and fluid but wtf even is that?
See ya'll in 10 years
Need it on pc now
is that sasuke uchias voice actor?
This better also come out on the ps4 or else this game gets a 0
New year new game I guess
So so cool
bully maguire
This game looks so freaking cool. I can’t wait for it.
3:03 that spartan kick!
I don't care if Connor is their friend, that guy is a giant lizard threatening the lives of others and the whole city. Kraven is actually doing them a favor.
SHOCKERRRRRRRRRR
Holy, it's just too intense until I peed in my pants.
YO THIS LOOKS AWESOME, the suit making an impact on Peter, the abilities, CONNORS AND KRAVEN? HYPE ITTTT
As long as theres no MJ missions I'll be there. In my opinion the MJ missions killed the game and ruined my immersion
Yeah this is definitely goty
little detail I haven’t seen anyone talking about yet. after the lizard gets away and all the people have been saved, pete says “he got away from US.” this could obviously be referring to him and miles, but he says it before miles is in earshot, which is maybe supposed to be a sliiight hint towards the symbiote taking over
I cant wait 😬
peter’s combat with the symbiote is so underwhelming compared to web of shadows. I was hoping that a combo with the tendrils would exist and not just some one tap special move
Yay
this is beautiful.
I am not impressed with the graphics at all. Could be just my expectation that this would be incredibly photorealistic. It looks fine and better than the first one for sure but definitely not groundbreaking
They really did the lizard justice with his design it looks epic
Ps4 let's go
i hope morales dosent get offended at spider man for wearing blackface...
Preciso comprar um PS5 só para ter esse jogo 🤑
Any Co-op opportunities?
So I see Angelo Bronte survived a lake full of crocodiles, and after a few nights at the gym, he wanted revenge and decided to hunt the biggest lizard in town. A real sigma male move.
Omfg…. That game looks absolutely gorgeous!
This game looks absolutely insane! 💪🏻
I can't wait to play this game I need it now!!!😁😁😁
I'm from the future and I'm still playing this game in 2077🎮
3:10 Bro took the “No more children” to the next level
Cya all in a couple years when people wish to start this game again from the start, relive memories 🤞🏻🧡
This game looks crazyyyy
sasuke?
Getting this game
Bro real life copying games at this point fantastically made good job definitely gonna pre order it how much 🎉🎉🎉
YESSSSSSSS
Miles' reaction to Peter just throwing the poor guy to the ground was hilarious, but it also shows how the their character's parallel currently.
I love this symbiote spiderman
Marvel thankyou❤
Don't let Pete be a bad Spidey, Miles!
I was waiting for venom the whole time. I was sure this gameplay could possibly show us character switch to venom, like actual venom. That would be dope❤️
Jesus Loves you.
Did anybody notice that venom was trying to cover spider logo and together word it was removed by miles venom blast  That means he will save peter from venom
That Sasuke Uchiha voice really comin out this game😂
11:37 Pete didnt mean he got away from him miles and ganke  He meant *Us*
I like this version of peter 😈
This is going to be an insane gam 🤯
the black suits back!    see you guys in 2026 when the pc version launches.
Pure entertainment 💥
It would have been great if Peter finally responded to Miles "We also" referring to himself and the symbiote.
That first fight scene alone is INCREDIBLE.
This game will definitely beat Zelda Tears of the Kingdom
THIS IS MAD!!!!
the bets game
I like how theres just a dude casually sweeping his back porch while a swat vehicle pulls up on his neighbors house 2:15
I love the spidey games.. But the NPC reactions still feel very non intuitive and non human types.. Wish they could amp up the AI.. Or else it just feels like a typical '' beat em up'' type games.
Leaving a comment for me to come back again for the years to come.
Sony doesn't disappoint in Making PS games man 🤌✨️🔥 Spider-man 1 was my favorite PS game along with Fall Guys 😅😂
Spider man is Peter Parker. Why are they forcing us to be miles
When the game is 100x better than the movie
I hope you have a good story of how Peter found the symbiote.
Game of the year!!!
WOW
From where can i download this game?
I hope when Spider-Man gets the black suit, he will be more towards black cat than MJ. It would be so cool, just as it was in web of shadows
So insane
You did something amazing. Something spectacular. Something, what was unthinkable and almost impossible to do. You made Miles Morales interesting. The most boring character in Spider-verse and you made him interesting even in fights. I really have to admit it. Good job. Such a goood job.
When are we getting a release date
Came here to see spiderman fight in open world jungle 😢
Me muero por jugarlo tiene que estar tremendo juegazo felicidades por sacar semejante juego
Bem que a MARVEL STUDIOS poderia fazer um jogo compartilhado, baseado no seu Universo do Cinema, teria tudo para ser incrível
I will probably be here in the future so hello future me
Excellent🎉🎉🎉
That black suit looks nasty 😂😅 y’all seen the back of the head. 😬
I already see it, you’re going to have to fight Peter to get rid of the black suit.
Peter his venom in this game  How else would he have big teeth
Whoa! This looks great! Symbiote suit really boosts up Spiderman
That's sick 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Please be good bc this has so  much potential ❤😢
All I’m sayin’ is that Spiderman is now voiced by Sasuke Uchiha which is the most fitting thing ever now that he’s got the symbiote.
had to check the title again to see if i'm watching spiderman or lotr in the beginning.
For 10 years from now who will see this comment I'm looking forward to playing this game but i can't and u will play it for free .. Remember we couldn't 😢
I don’t have PlayStation 😢
This game looks amazing I hope It will Be released on pc Too
Looks like prototype
His aggressive peter voice is just sasuke
I love how the symbiote suit still looks shiny and slimy unlike other iterations of the suit where it becomes fabric-like when it's not doing the tendrils thingy.  My only nitpick is that they used the classic symbiote spider symbol, which honestly could've been done different. Insomniac didn't seem one to shy away from making new spider symbols, why not do the same for the symbiote?  EDIT: My opinion has been changed by the bright-minded people in the replies. No need to go ahead praise the greatness of the og symbiote symbol again.
is Bubniak back?
Man i didnt really care for miles because to me peter parker is spiderman just period lol but this game looks sick af
lol these water graphics still stuck in the early 2000s
Favorite duo after Rick and Morty, Spider-Man and Spider-Man
One word BADASS !!
Everyone's talking about the symbiote, but honestly one of the best things I see from this is that dodging midair finally doesn't make you lose momentum. Hopefully shooting webs midair doesn't stop your momentum either like in the TASM 2 game.
Wonder if I have to play Miles Morales to play this, I get it's probably a good thing but there's just too much to play man.
I might pre order this mf
future me let me know if this game was good🔥
Same old same old. I dont see any change in gameplay
this is awesome
When is this game arriving?
Bully Lowenthal
Miles is awesome
L for bringing miles into Spider-Man 2
“You sure?? He’s got big teeth” “So do I” dude I am pumped up
My god this game looks so good
Marvel? Marvel didn't invent spiderman, Sony did! Just like how Disney invented star wars!
11:28 I guess you can say spiderman kills
Just wow!! Thought i was watching a movie!!
Peter talks to Miles the way Batman talks to Robin, the disrespect is insane. 3:43
This looks lit as hell man! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Games are still the same as they were 10 years ago
I’m I the only one who’s bothered with Ganke knowing spiderman’s true identity ?
If Peter and Miles fights it would be so cool
The facts this and across the spiderverse is happening at the same time and their miles as I'm the last game and you see PS4 Spidey in the new movie tos will definitely not be a coincidence
Spiderman has awakened his inner Sasuke (both have same voice actor)
When is it coming out?
Really? No 4K?
I LOVE the fact that they added Dr connors but i want Dr octopus back but i HATE the fact spiderman is like a villain
I remember using that combat techniques on my Nintendo... nostalgic
They said "Switch to Miles", and my bank account started crying.
Cool stunts Ant man
wait what sasuke?
I will wait when the game will come out on pc screw Play Station 5!!!!
There should be a movie instead thoe it's animated
This is gonna be superhit game of all time. So excited
oooo this is heat 🔥🔥🔥
He just changed map
man the combat looks awesome !
these scence are for more better than Movie scence its crazy
Better than Aadipurush 😅😅
Sasuke.?
Spiderman ❤❤❤ hai apna
When peter says he escaped US. Does he mean him and miles or him and the symbiote
I'M SO READYYYYY 🔥🔥🔥
The movement looks so fun!!!
11:07 buckle my shoes
I want eddie brock as venom 👿
I thought venom would be a playable character 🤦🏽‍♂️
NBA Young Spider 🕷️
I’ll come back to show my kids how much these graphics sucked in “my day”
I know it's just a videogame but really that's the best they got for story telling???!
Can someone please tell me if this game will be fully on a physical disc copy or if I have to download it from the PlayStation store
ch7al livraison
I just love the new cinematics and combos
Miles and Peter are going to fight
Just leaving my mark here for the future
I’m only half way thought and I’m going nuts this looks amazing I think they have once again brought us a remarkable Spidey game the The beginning was brilliant had me baffled I thought Craven was the guy with the short hair upset me until the real Craven appears amazing omg need this game now ❤
This looks amazing
When did he get venom?
Looks amazing
Release date !?
As the mcu begins its sunset. The MGU begins its sunrise.
Did Miles learn the kamehameha
4:54 MILES ELECTRICITY CHANGED FROM YRLLOW TO BLUE
well the graphics now is outstanding 2023. Let's see the comment section in 10+ years 😉😁
:- He's not normally like that,,right? :- No,,he's never like that
Gameplay looks great, can’t wait to stay in line just to buy this 😂😂😂
Like all Playstation haters (Bring it to Xbox and PC)
I have a theory about the symbiote. i think the symbiote will fully take control of Peter, and look like the venom from the reveal trailer, and then Miles will fight him.
I really want a Venom game.
sybiote combat gives major prototype 2 vibes
That right there is the GOAT, The GOAT !
Hurts me more to see this is only on PS5..!! And not on PS4 😢
Angry Spidey sounds a LOT like Sasuke
In 10 years, insomniac games will keep making the best superhero games…mark these words!
I want to say that there is a little unrealistic time Lage when you are accelerating to the boats  with your web shooters
Now this is awesome! This easily ramped up my hype. This is how u show great gameplay
First thing I'm thinking is even though it's spiderman shouldn't be age restrictions for the way he just snapped dudes neck in the beginning lmao😂
So that villain wants to hunt everyone down in Ney York. But he's not doing the hunting, his henchmen are lol
Getting the " just cause 3" wingsuit vibe mixed with "prototype" attacks.  I am excited but don't want them to put too much in game aswell.  Sometimes too much isn't good 🤞🤞
Jai iron man
The details in this trailer are amazing! (no pun intended) Look at how Peter's eyes changes when he says "So do I", they becamed more aggressive and resembeles more those of Venom
I hope there won't be any RPG+.
Playing on the hardest difficulty when game drops and getting plat on it
9:19   Miles: Spider-Man it's got defenses!  Peter: So do I.
Bradley Cooper plays Kraven? 1:22
I am more 100% sure that this game is not gonna disappoint
No way, I can’t wait for this game to come out
I’mp playing this no matter what
Sa soul c que sur ps5
The Stomp finisher in the beginning took me out 😭😂 - CRAZY!!
hype
Finally
I bet this comment can’t reach more than 10likes
I guess I have to buy PS5 now...
Jesus Christ died for all of our sins. He died the death we all deserved. He was the perfect one who never sinned once, but he loved us so much he decided to die for us so our sins would be paid for and we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven before God the Father blamelessly. He is the living son of God who wants to know us and have a personal relationship with us. No matter  what you have done no matter how far gone you think you are Jesus can and will save you. All you have to do is confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior. Believe that he died on the cross for your sins and had a bodily resurrection 3 days later. We cannot be saved by our works but by faith in Christ alone. Repent and turn to Christ. You will have joy, happiness, love, and peace beyond understanding.
I love how when they released the PS5 in 2020 the only game I was excited for was this just for this one (AND ONLY THIS ONE) to be PS5 exclusive and not on PS4. Now Ragnarok was the best game they had up until now imo but even that was on PS4. Sucks I won't be able to play this but oh well
😮❤
@7:40  peter said "I can't lose Connor's, Harry's dying and he's the only one who can help"  In Spiderman 1 we saw from the end credits scene that Harry is inside the water tank with the symbiote. maybe peter is trying to help Harry then accidentally got the Symbiote on him! Maaan! Im Soooo Hyped! Thank you Insomniac! 🔥
The fact i knew i can't afford ps5 but still watch this and have 1 an idea, just watch full gameplay with 1440p 60fps 😌. I love spiderman, and when Marvel spiderman is out, i buy used ps4 just for this game, just need me 2 days to finish and sell the ps4 again. Same goes to Miles Morales. Really good story, good animation, good physics even not perfect. Both spiderman make me tears when grandma died and the friend of Miles sacrifices. Idk you read it or not, just sharing.
What a time to be a Spider Man fan
INSOMNIAC! That’s all I need to know to purchase a game
The voice acting for black spider man is the same guy who voice act Sasuke from naruto isn’t it? Lol
brooo so hype
I have to say I’m super pumped for the sequel! 2018 Spider-Man is a masterpiece and Miles Morales is also a really good game but it could have been longer and had more content
Rip Xbox 🕊
“Pete, alley oop on 3?” *”FINE”*
Ok that's to much... Spider-Man is now Iron Man???? Flying around like one?  Electrocuting people too. Smh
Tokyo Ghoul lmao
It looks so awesome! I can't wait to play. Definitely smells like GOTY!
I can’t wait for this game! I fell in love with this Spiderman game series. The design, story, marketing,… Be greater. Together 🕸️🕷️⚡️
Wow omg 😆 🔥
Assassin's creed
Bro this looks way too complicated but way too cool.😅
Another black remake? Lmfao
i wont play the game bec i dont have a ps5 or a good pc but im so exited to see people play it
I just wanted to hear him say, "One down, brother."
That is a whole lot of cutscenes in the span of 12 minutes, ‘least the gameplay is looking very fun
Peter Parker is spider man! Miles is miles .
Soooo its officially batman arkham makeover? Still down to play this. Looks sick af.
I wonder if the symbiote is gonna be a alien or a lab creation on this continuity.
Imagine in future if any director make a Spiderman movie which is soo dark with villains like kraven,green Goblin and venom
When can we purchase this game?
Dudes wearing scorpions drip 1:24
Spiel hat echt geile Neuigkeiten… nur die Grafik könnte etwas besser sein wenn man das so sieht
Craven is probably the wackiest Spider-Man villain
ok sony you won take my wallet
Fkng Amazing!
Oh carp Peter is slowly becoming venom in the game
And Instabuy for me, but give this game co-op and I will be even happier.
i’ve played this before. used to call batman: arkham… series
I think we are seeing  goty 2023
You can hear Yuri going from Peter to Sasuke real quick.
this might be the best thing I've ever seen in my life

5:02 sound design team needs a raise
This fragment on 2:39-2:42 looks like Itachi’s Amaterasu
I’m going to leave this comment as a time capsule
Did anyone realise the swinging animations are still the same
The music at  3:26 is so good
Is this Spiderman or Thanos? He has ALL the powers
Taková lepší prototype hra no akorát se spidermanem
Miles part seem stupid and to cartoony keep him out
Black spider talks like kratos
Spiderman 2 is mean there is 2 spiderman, and 3 spiderman does that mean 3 spiderman?Miles peter and gwen may be?
нидеюсь зис гейм не будет таким говном как на данном видео
bro that horizontal-wall-bicycle kick barrage was INSANE.
That's looks so fun😮
No kraven will be venom because in the first trailer kraven say who will give me what I desire and venom say yes we will so I think kraven will be venom
I  love  this  game  ❤❤❤❤
WOW animation
Yuri pulled out that Sasuke card again
Angelo bronte!!
Wow
Is kraven idk how to spell his name  the first boss or is lizard
3:02 Props to MatPat for this amazing voice acting
Symbiote boutta drop the n word on miles😂😅
Miles turned into goku
That game looks amazing
This game takes me back to go old days of Web of shadows. I am sooo excited for this game!!!!!
What in the super amazing freakin work is this! Tore apart gamer's expectations. Unbelievable
I think it might having spiderman (miles morales) vs venomized spiderman (peterparker) in this game ...👀👀👀
idk I am actually glad that some of the bad mercenaries are women in this game.
Who else thought it was turok at the beginning?
Everything except the graphics looks fantastic
You think Symbiote Spidey will leave MJ for Black Cat like in Web of Shadows?
Bit disappointed with the Symbiotic Suit design. The head in particular.
Hello future person.
Games that have these cinematic sequences are just the best. Uncharted is the goat at this but you can see these guys have stepped up taken a leaf out of naughty dogs book and implemented such a key gameplay experience.   Love it
Not next-gen… i prefere Unreal Engine 5…
I'm watching this gameplay footage and I am already asking myself, how many attempts it's going to take someone like me to take em all down. 😂 The videos makes it look so easy while I'm desperately probably sitting there for hours 😂
Why can I not stop watching this 😂
Great ! i will not buy this again
can we talk about the takedowns? 2:56 was absolutely phenomenal
I'll come back in like  5years
Bro ones every  unreleased game
I love how when Peter says "He got away from us." you can subtilty tell that he wasn't referring to Miles
he's about to put some dirt in his eye
20% gameplay 80% movie ¿do you really like this? this is horrible
I’m a huge Star Wars and Harry Potter fan but THIS is the game that’s gonna make me get a ps5
not going to lie i dont really like games as much but for some reason when it comes to marvels spider man im really really invested the first two games were perfect
Miles using that Chidori well , lol
التريلر من اسوء ما شاهدت
Wait a minute , why's Spidey is symbiotic again ?
this will be my favourite game ever!!!!
IM SO EXCITED
This looks amazing , you can really tell they put in the effort to impress
haha
PS4, let's go
W
As an animated movie this looks fantastic, as an actual video game I'm not sure.
great job guys this is going to be fire
Microsoft are arseholes for passing on this game!
Que malo que no vaya  a estar en ps4 estaria cool
pftt looks borring playstatioon dropped the ball this year fr
6:38 you can tell the dialogue between Miles and Genke describing Lizard getting bigger and hungrier is also referring to Peter and the symbiote! Such a dope detail. I wonder if it was on purpose
Here will be complaining section of those who thinks spiderman 5 sucks in 15 years
Boombaaaa
My money, take it! I won’t need it for anything else. 😂
Now I can enjoy experience the swagger of a black teen
Ok well I'll see this comment in 10 years cya
Gonna miss the iconic Chrysler building
Noticed how they animated his eyes at 11:47 thru 11:51,when he says "NO...he's mine". Looks like contained rage. And 11:55 that threatening, more venom-like look. Amazing.
water in 2010 ahahah
When is this game coming out
I hope we can use the symbiote suit at the end so we can free roam with it on
ahha 30fps gameplay💀💀💀
Bro💀
Why does this game look worse than inFAMOUS: Second Son, which came out almost 10 years ago?
See i am not racist i m a simple brown guy and i don't like to play with miles that is why i ve not completed spider man mile Morales and this time i am not gonna buy this ,sorry:(
Why is no one talking about the beat with miles after the slingshot. It’s so fire 🔥
Maybe Miles have to fight with Peter to take out the symbiote
This is just a new Prototype game
Are we forced to play as black spider man miles
I am kinda glad this game isn't coming out too soon, as I still have to save up for the ps5. 😅  Can't wait to dust off the webshooters and fight crime again. Although I do play Miles Morals aftermath quite often, it looks like there are new things in Spiderman 2 that I need to learn. Hopefully there will be build up to this situation and we can learn how to use the new mechanics.
Looks good can't wait to play it in 2024, kraven the hunter is a cool villian, think it's time to call Miles Kid-Spider he has no Identity status because he has the original characters name, two superheroes both calling themselves the same name is pretty stupid.
real I See you in 10 years when someone wants to relive memories of this game
"I have BBC"
The way he throws the guy at 11:32 while Miles seems confused ... It's just details but that gives a lot  to the story and how they progressively build the characters. I'm so confident this game is gonna be awesome !
Im sad that I wont be able to play this game because it will be PS5 exclusive so cant buy it on PC or PS4
The hunter!!
Hey I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart. If anyone tells you that Jesus isn’t the only way, they are lying to you and they don’t care about your future.
Watch Nicholas veniamin Nino Rodriguez funky Prepper
The chill factor on 8 but if he had showed some teeth, it would have been a 10
Placing my mark with this comment of mine
Awesome af
How did peter get the symbiote from venom
Water physics is not that impressive dispite the fact that this is for PS5. Other gameplay elements are amazing.
This when being an Xbox player feels especially sad 😢
This looks incredible
This game is gana be sick
Looks so cool😭 where is the money fir a ps5 😭😭😭😭😭😭
prototype copied
Can't wait to find out how he gets the symbiote
If you listen closely you can hear Xbox fanboys crying.
Wtf the wingsuit is actually flying 😭😂
LOOKS LIKE PS4 GAME!!!!
0:18 Sees black stuff on a plant and immediate reaction is to taste it LMAO WTF.
Waiting for this to release on PS4 since 2020, now they betray ps4 owners
Wait what about Rio is she gonna die at the end because peters Aunt died
Hello
Same physics of the web Same animations Same graphics  f u insomniac
For some people wondering why Miles’ Venom is blue now  I think it has something to do with the ending of the Miles game
♥
If there is no Tobey Maguire dance easter egg im not playing
This game is cringe incarnated
KRAVEN!
I need t this game guess its time to save up for a ps5 lol
TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!
😳😳😳😳🔥🔥🔥🔥
7:35 was that assasins creed
Who knew that if you take spider man and venom you get Sasuke  Uchiha great gameplay hopefully it will come to PC soon too
Wokeness ruined this franchise too. They made original peter parker the villian now just so the "black version" of spiderman can become hero. Shame
This is gonna be he's bully maguire arc 😂
As a spiderman fan with a spidersona I'd say this game is looking ✨PERFECT✨
Gameplay looks fun but man still dont look like a current gen game, how doe’s plague tale reqlium look more visually better than a bigger budget game like this, atleast in this trailer, still looking forward to the game though
Don't know why, but seeing this gameplay reveal trailer for Spiderman makes me long for a new Batman game instead.
There is something attractive about this peter, I mean yeah its because of Venom but still, its like he knows how an evil mind thinks, the way he says he is mine clearly shows he is all about dirty fighting + vengeance!!!! excited for this
i will not buy this one
The symbiotic Pete gives you Prototype vibes!
Wow
Da fook?!
miles gonna kill peter
Lol it’s just boring
11:24 It's that split second hesitation that gets me. The way he looks back to Lizard as if he thought about chasing him into the sewers, as if that was more important that saving people from the blazing crashing aircraft. I'm wondering how far symbiote Spider-Man will go, and how long we'll get to keep the symbiote.
I do like the look of this black suit spidey, but compared to what we got out of the black suit in web of shadows this seemed REALLY light in comparison. It seems a lot more for the story than the actual gameplay/combat, whereas in web of shadows there was a real distinct difference in the feeling of power.  Of course they might just be waiting to show us more in depth black suit combat later on, but you'd think it'd be more of a headliner. I'm sure the black suit will still be great, but i am interested to hear what you guys think about it as well
Bring it for PC tooo
I hope we also get to play as Peter wearing the black suit underneath his clothes. During his daily life, not only being aggressive but also being more hip an funky lol like in Spider-Man 3 movie. It would be awesome to see Peter go to a party with Miles or something an do the famous Parker dance he does in Spider-Man 3 movie, then something happens an perhaps he gets into a fight with someone or people an Miles has to break it up lol that would be awesome.
VENOM IN THIS GAME? I'M SO READY, BRUH
2:30 Does anyone else hear that growl after Peter speaks? That wasn't his voice.
I think I’m in love 😂
I hope when they fight you have the option to choose who you’re as but Peter wins the fight against miles but it’s shown in different ways while also making realize how far gone Peter himself is and runs to fight the suit off
When will they do what we really want and make it co op
The black venom suit looks terrible
The water and explosion physics are bad but the rest of gameplay is majestic and so amazing!
Spider-Man definitely has the best games
take my money right now! 💯💯💯
I want to play this game but I have a ps4
Is that kraven the hunter
القوادة ❤
.
I’m sorry but this looks really boring
if y’all really look at it, some of these characters will be in the next Spider-Man movie😮‍💨😭 i can’t wait🙃
Where are Venom and Carnage?
Dev's nowadays : hey lets make part 2! copy / paste, new title, few new cosmetics - DONE!
The symbiote moves are too sick,it's insane
Костюм веном сделан отвратительно
11:54 Holyy I love the creepy score when Pete starts to go full on evil, really great detail in the cutscenes as well where you can see him actively not help civilians on the boat or right before the alley-oop. I can already tell whatever he does with the symbiote is gonna be 🔥 Even the subtle alterations to his score from the first game; the intense synth in the background at 2:26 really reminds me of the black suit combat music from Web of Shadows.
Yeeesss
Holy smokes
thug shake
Miles is gonna have to whip Pete’s azzz. Haha Pete can’t beat miles. Even with the symbiote suit on.
The web swinging is too plain yall should let us climb up the web and use a certain button to move the web how we want like for example you swinging n you shoot out the sec web let us move on the web how we want
At least change up the web slinging at least let us us two webs yk and be able to like use the sec web to do tricks with it like how he be doing in the movies
Is that Matpat?
A little bit of saskue
Bruh I can’t even explain my hype for this😭 This will be the best Spider-Man game for sure
Insomniac doing what they do best again with those cool gadgets. Awesome!
With Pete wearing the symbiote suit we know that Eddie Brock is not that far behind. Def can’t wait for this one the 1st spider man game on ps4 and Miles Morales on ps5 we’re both good. So this 3rd edition of the spidey games will def be top 3 for game of the year 👍🏿
Finally the venom suit. I can’t wait 🕷️
game of the year.
Leaven sound like Rais from dying light
Peter with venom gameplay feels like prototype all over again man! So doped!
I believe the Japanese have been waiting for this moment. 🇯🇵
Fire
Well, Christmas came early this year!!!!
Yeah this is cool and all, but will it blend? 🤔
Where is the love button??
Xbox still better
As if the first remaster and the miles morales one weren’t good enough
Can this be in ps4 pweasss
tap tap movie movie tap movie movie
Yes sir I noticed something was different and soon as I watched it Spider-Man isn't talkin Peter ain't making no jokes he serious
when is this coming out on xbox?
Why give him a manbun!!! Come on he is kraven not soyven.
SHEESHHHH
I think they didn't reveal the main villain the player they reveal are the pieces of the game but to fully complete the game main villain is missing.  Like in previous spiderman game demo or trailer they didn't reveal doc-oc going to be the main villain they just show the piece of villain or they just trying to give that the mr negative is main villain
Wow, a 3rd person cinematic game from Sony!! How original.
Full send it
Sa SUUU KEEEEEEEE
Please PlayStation make it in the same requirements as the first game please just please
I can't stop rewatching this. 😭
Magnificent 🎉
Pov: thought spiderman 2 would be about norman
🔥
I'm excited to play the game I just wish it was coming to pc as well I feel like there are a lot of pc folks who have gotten into the series because they ported it.
Why don’t they just call it Miles Morales 2? There was was more Miles in the game than Spider-Man. Typical.
Is it me or Kraven the Hunter looks like Virat Kohli 😅
I would love to see Peter not holding back on some fights.. for example not saving shocker, but completely tearing him apart.. Like letting symbiote take over and completely cloud peter view. And then let that regret and anger flow trough him..
The new suit sucks but the story looks different and maybe even amazing? Not sure if I would pre-order
Maybe in the halfway of the story, when Peter finally can have a duel against Kraven, he loses his control and turn to Venom and almost manage to kill Kraven, that why he wants to abandon the black suit (they're kind of have a conflict that black suit likes Peter and want to kill Kraven, but Peter with the moral code, Thou Shalt Not Kill, make the suit feels betrayed). And it would be more interesting if the battle happened in the church, and Eddie (full of hate toward Spider-Man for destroying his career) were there, and become Venom we all know. Maybe seeing the pure heart of Harry made Peter realize how mean he was. . . . . I mean, maybe this time we will have:" Kravennnnnnn,  you can't escape meeeeee"
I almost forgot that i wasn't watching a movie.
I need to play the spiderman games
Xbox k lol
Graphics and story are looking good, but the enemy AI is 2 gens behind. They look cool, but stack up like bowling pins frothing for a 1v1.
The game is good but I don't like the console buttons on the screen
AW NAW SASUKE UCHIHA IS ON A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF "If anyone who criticizes my life were to come forward. I'd turn around and kill every single one of their loved ones, so that they too can grasp what it's like… to experience this hatred of mine."
Black suit Spiderman: He got away from us!  Miles: You mean us right? 😀......right😐
Yess the lizard is actually a lizard in thia game the hype is real!!
اسم اللعبة؟
Insomniac doesn't know how to miss man holy.
If spiderman played prototype
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED WHEN HE WORE THE SYMBIOTE.   no black suit that doesn't do nothing but make him aggressive and edgy.   I wanted to see him using the tendrils on the black suit like venom. I knew seeing it would be amazing because with venom, its more wild and animal like, but on spiderman, he's more brutal and almost in synch with the symbiote.   On top of that the wiggling eyes at the end that shows how deep the symbiote is influencing peter. 11:39 11:39 11:39
We really need Figures with Karven, Shoker, Scorpion, Electro, and other characters from this game
My only worry that probably shouldn’t be a worry is Symbiote Spidey is the “Mary Jane” missions. Not a gut feeling but just an odd thought
Новая часть человека паука это круто!!!
pregunta seria, esto es un DLC tambien?
Is there not one uploaded in 60 fps anywhere?
So.. pc when?!
Now i have to bye ps5. And build a monterous PC to play it. Cause itz inevitable.
Hi Marvel I love this and I hope you have a good day and you are awesome and funny and can't wait to play this game
Symbiote Spiderman is my all time favorite arc. Bring it!
god I hate that venom thing
GAMEPLAY IN QUEENS????!!
People are predicting a fight between Peter and Miles in this game. If that's the case I feel very bad for Miles lol
Leaving my mark here, hello people years to come.
Everything looks great. Still not looking forward to the Tom Holland look alike tho. 😒
I'm very excited for this game. I think it's finally time for the PS5
I. Am Rock Hard. Right Now.
huge prototype vibes
Yuri is channeling that sasuke energy!!!
Reminds me of web of shadows in a way , that game needs a remaster with a longer story it was just amazing
As long as I get to play as Venom Ill be happy
Cant wait looks really good
Ooooh this looks good
Saw the black suit and it was an instant click
👿👿👿
🔥
Black suit yes Miles no
Only ps5?
okay one is talking about it but I hope we get to see wraith and Spidey on a mission or her trying to tlk spidey down
I’m kind of done with super heroes to be honest
Gameplay sure must be fun BUT the game looks like a 2015 PC game
Once this game is out we all gonna know that cory is definitely gonna play this 😊
This does not look next-gen
shits ps5 exclusive, L
oh they changed the venoms color
Pete's suit looks ABSOLUTELY INSAINE!
Sai pra PS4 ainda?
stopped it at the three minute mark. can't wait for the release
Why do I got the feeling that there’s going to be a time where you have to either pick Peter or Miles
When is it coming out?
This whole gameplay is giving me web of shadows vibes
Sasuke in symbiote
Wish i had ps5.
I like how you can see how peter is acting ruder and more agressive, you can even tell Miles doesn't like that, really good symbiote stuff
Spidey sense
I think they should make 2 campaigns. One you play as Peter one you play as miles
Ohh boy this going to be a good joy
Peter is NOT in a good place right now.
Of coarse miles will go agasint Peter, all ghetto ignorant uneducated and emotional people have something agaisnt educated and hard working people.
Insomniac need to make a black panther game I would pay to buy that
WE! NEED! CO-OP!
Miles brought out the kamehameha at 4:59 😭
We in Queensbridge/ LIC / Astoria
Wow! This game looks epic!! I can’t wait to see people playing it and watch their videos
PLOT TWIST, final boss, miles & kraven VS Spiderman venom
When is it out on PC?
That Miles and Peter showdown is gonna be epic
Miles is annoying
So which one if you is spider man : 👁️👃🏾👁️  Spider-Man : I am 🤜🏽🤛🏼
Am I the only one feeling prototype vibes?
Ayee 2nd Spiderman lives in East Village good taste
See you guys when the game gets speedran
The idea of making Spider-Man a tag team is so stupid. Is that what Spider-Man means now? a team?  Lame. Peter Parker deserves his own story! As for Miles Morales, why doesn't he continue to get his own games? I'm sure he is popular enough to stand on his own, right? The truth of the matter is that neither of them are being able to stand out any longer.
Am I the only that just hears Curse Mark Sasuke?😂
WTF did I just witness ayy yo this is fire
amazing.
wow.
My issue with the suit is that it doesn't look like fabric. It just looks like he's covering black goo. Which seems like the direction the filmmakers want to take the suit in the MCU, judging by the concept art. That just defeats the whole purpose of the black suit's presence in Spider-Man lore. It's not supposed to look like anything other than a simple fabric costume, making that more shocking when it's discovered to be a living organism. Having it look like goo on Eddie Brock makes more sense because the symbiote has no reason to hold the ruse that's a basic garment.
better than any movie!!!!
I was here when this game started❤
I never played the first spider man . But this right here I crazy .
What's up with Peter's shoulder pads
cool but whens the pc port
This chase at 10:17 reminds me a bit to Killer Croc's chase at Batman Arkham Asyllum!!!
Just like web of shadows remake
where is the “buy” button?! 😮
peter bouta pull up to the five kage summit  💀
do you have the option to only be real spiderman?
I feel like Spider-Man is never leaving NY. He’s more like a Defender than a Avenger.
OMG THE SYMBIOTE SUIT!!! 2:30
1. I was wondering how they would keep the map interesting. Adding the suburbs was smart. 2. I really hope this is primarily Peter’s story. I appreciate them having both Spider-men as playable characters in the game, but I also really appreciate them having their own games where they are focused on individually. 3. Omg this franchise has the potential to be greater than the Arkham series. Like… Marvel’s version of it I suppose?
This looks bad so far. Nothing but cinematics.
Is that Wraith??? Our dear officer went nuts after all!!
Sergei Kravinov??? They made the infamoys hunter badass!!!
wish this was on Xbox. absolute bs
Kraven eh
Now that's on heck of a gameplay reveal.
it looks terrible
prowler i thought it was dp😂
Why does this one feel like a downgrade from the other two games
I'll follow you to the ends of the earth!!!!
Jason Mamoa would be great for Kraven if he lose that Dad bod
GOD HOPE ITS ON PS4
why is no one talking about the score it sounds killer
Watching from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Yuri is going Full Sasuke here. you love to see it
Camera following spiderman during flight sequence is just too good. It gives a feel about what spiderman would actually see during flight and fight.
BRUH THAT KICK AGAINST THAT WALL THOU 3:08
top 5 DLC ever in in-game transaction history
Duuuuuude i absolutely had a geek stroke the moment i saw the tendrils form from the suit into the classic symbiote suit i gotta point this out, the eyes look alive just like the rest of the suit but admittedly there are moments the eyes look menacing more so than the rest of it, the spider is as iconic as ever, and i love the fact that the white squares are touched up by the V shape its so classic but modernized in a very unique way, interesting homage and respect towards the original design (God I love insomniac for this), armors up even in perfectlyaccented body locations, and most importantly ITS ALIVE (the suits alive after all) and the flow of the goo coursing over peter is a nice and very SPECTACULAR touch, also i love you can tell Peter is DEFINITELY NOT holding back and you can hear AND feel the impact behind his attacks man oh man did insomniac deliver us a show man its only gonna get better 😭 im super stoked dude !!!!!
As a Hardcore Spider-Man Fan 🕷️🕸️❤ I think I’ll speak for everyone and say that the game looks almost perfect! The only thing that will make it perfect is if they get John Bubniak who is the original face model for our brother Peter Parker.   And did you see how slick Miles was with it?!!! 7:51
I am so hyped to play as bad boy Peter😈
The soundtrack when we switch to miles is top tier cannot wait for this game 🔥
take my money
Insomniac has been killing it! Take all of my money!!
Please tell me they changed Peter’s face back to the original one. I just can’t stand Yuri Lowenthal’s voice coming out of Tom Holland’s face
It’s hard Not to hear Sasuke’s voice coming from Peter 😂😂😂
Bro the fact that troboyo got this much right ………..
This is like watching Bully Maguire with Tom Holland as his sidekick
he sounds like matpat
I understand there'll be switching between the characters of Spider-Man and Miles, but I hope most of the gameplay ends up focusing on Spider-Man, especially if he has the symbiote suit.
3:11 goddamn 🤣🤣🤣
Everything IS AMAZING. But guys could we seriously fix the water effect???
This looks incredible.
I feel that the symbiote will be with us till we beat Kraven the Hunter and the suit with Venom out and try and make us kill kraven and then well fight miles as miles wants to stop peter
Can't wait for this! Its been 5 years thats crazy!
Finally, the REAL black Spider-Man 👿
He just sounds like a dramatic matpat lol
This looks amazing!! Finally, my PS5 will be worth while.
Well… looks like I’m finally buying a PS5
I don’t know if anyone noticed, but it looks like for Peter’s symbiote combat will involve parrying. Normally the red spider sense symbol means to dodge but at 3:02 he just blocks the attack. I’m very excited to see the differing combat gameplay😆
Any updates on the matrix game ?
Finally a black suit that actually utilize's its abilities
what is new: new ui, new attacks, character switching, new finishers, new enemies, new calling system, ganke able to help peter and miles, peter and miles gliding, and new stealth takedowns. This about to be fire  Edit: i forgot to say that you can now play in queens
Gracias
Peter sounds like the voice of Bakugo from My Hero Academia, and the symbiote tentacles remind me of the mimics from Edge of Tomorrow. Those are two of my favorite stories!!!
Miles Vs Peter (symbiote)!
Why is miles venom blue now?
Is it worth playing miles first or does it not really matter
but we have sea of thieves
yo is Venom gonna be in this
Green Goblin is in this one right? He’s just the Doc Ock one that doesn’t get mentioned until the game comes out? I’m calling it, they teased Gobby so hard in the first game
Over theatrics while gaming will ruin the game after 2 3 missions .. keep mediocre but without making it like a movie scene but like a game slo mo style like Batman Arkham series .. specially origins and knights .. I mean the gameplay not cinematic
I have to get this and a ps5...its to much money!
Well, web swinging is stil non realistic, and I don't want to see so much Miles Morales stuff in SPIDER MAN game, he is not the original Spider Man. I'd like to see more Peter Parker stuff and also symbiote costume is so unrealistic too...
Would have been 100 on this if there was no Miles and Ganky, and no symbiotic powers beyond the source material for Peter. As it is, I’ll buy it… if the reviews are good.
don't like his new black suit. looks inspired by the venom movie, but i can see why they need to design to suit to look like this to use more venom type powers.
Godzilla XD
They captured the symbiote suit well as It making Peter more aggressive and slightly less rational.
I feel like Peter is going to be a boss fight
Venom sounds like sasuke for some reason 🤷🏻‍♀️
The facts that they’re showing this means the game gets way more epic. This is just the beginning🤯
Wait What hol up was that isaac butterfield?
3:36 the music goes HARD here! the composer for the first 2 games is clearly working their magic for this game!
No nextgen
I love how you are able to switch between the two in the story
Loving the continuity from the previous games!
i hope its a longer story than the last one
game of the year easily
Bout time we get Kraven in something!
Anyone else half expecting Peter/Venom to say "So do WE" in response to the comment about big teeth?
I'm simply not going to get any sleep when this comes out..!!
Yeah I'm going to need 2 copies of this
Peter sounds like his older brother killed his clan and he's on a path of revenge.
It’s like watching a high rated T.V series
3:04 I feel like everyone wishes they never came to New York
Very interesting that Miles’s friends hunter killer drone looks awfully similar to goblins glider 🤔🤔
Can’t wait to not play this game
😈😈😈 i came to see the symbiote in action and that’s what i saw
"Spiderman doesn't kill"
i can already tell i hope they give us a way to keep playing with the venom suit after he loses it, unless i gotta make a seperate save for it ;)
when peter said "he'll regret ever coming to new york" bro sounded like he was ready to kill someone
yo... all i gotta say
It looks good, but it just looks like a big DLC rather than a whole new game.
Why does marvel always insist on using venom as a shape-shifting agent instead of a spider like creature like he is in the comics!?
Im all for more of this game, but this doesnt rly look like much of an improvement over the first one, will have to see the whole product
Miles gave Peter the pass
It didn't resolve itself it's Venom it controls it I'm so looking forward to this game
y
I hope that in the game Miles will understand that the way to release Venom and Peter is through music, loud sounds, a biot that is sensitive to loud sounds
I don’t even know what to say for this
This is sick. Reminds me of prototype 1 and 2.
Love everything but the venom suit
This is going to be crazy we can go to the map Across  New York City to Brooklyn and we get venom Spider-Man also a lot of villans
Peter has woken up and chosen violence, and I couldn’t be more excited.
The first game of the year I’m excited for. Curious to see Kraven in full villain light next to Aaron Taylor’s “middle ground” Kraven.
The bullet trails look so much better and I see the finishers will adjust depending where you are and what your doing 3:05
Blooy ausum trialer
Facial mouvement goes crazy
Yuri is nailing the edgy Spider-man voice
Where do I leave my money?
Im buying a PS5 just for this game
So now there're 2 black Spider-man
11:47  Peter: No... Venom: ...he's mine
I hope they will make "Spider Man 3 dance" reference to evil Peter
Lot of polishing up to do in terms of graphics, but the story looks absolutely killer
That venom suit looks terrible 😢 they could have done a better design. I hope they include movie venom spider-man costumes
water effects are awful
I love the symbiote guyver suit
Im not 8 anymore so looks awful
Miles vs Peter let’s gooo
I love this suit, it's literally a wet dream for me. I love the sound and feel of it, the attitude of Peter, so much darker but still Peter somehow and I'm hoping he did imply that he has teeth, I mean if venom gives Eddie and others teeth, it should give Peter teeth too
Remake Edge of Time and Shattered Dimensions, please Marvel
Cant wait
como sempre , mais do msm so eu percebo q os jogo n evolui em nd faz algum tempo ?
Once again, Yuri Lowenthal proceeds to be one of my favorite VAs
Yo miles and peter fight. Miles saves peter and then eddie brock gets the symbiote. Venom
Yooo
Looks corny 😂 I’m glad I gave up on this
Meanwhile on Xbox….   Nothing*
Just cause? 💀
Ay marvel when is this releasing
Why would it only be on PlayStation when no one has PlayStation anymore.
fire
Woah, Prototype 3 looks snazzy AF!
This is gonna me a momentous game
The Black Suit was always my fave
I love how you can notice peters personality changes due to the symbiote I cannot wait for this game
noice
Calling it now if y'all paid attention to it: The bio-electricity scaring away the symbiote in the end card is a subtle hint to how Miles will eventually save Peter from the suit.
Looks like it's time to buy a PS5
Miles looks bigger woah
Wouldve been dope if instead of peter saying “so do I” he said “so do we”
HYPEEE IVE WATCHED LIKE 20 TIMES 🔥🔥
If you don't get to strut down the street in a black suit then I'm not interested 😂😂
Looks like a PS3 game, very disappointing. Looks like my PS5 is going to continue collecting dust
I don't know man this is starting to look wayyy to predictable
Oh, hey, we finally get Prototype 3!
I hope this game isn’t easy
Fine I’ll buy a ps5
Really hope we fight Peter in this game because that boss fight would be really fun and challenging if they make it fluid that is
Peter in his villian arc fr
Sad time to be a PC guy and not own a console anymore. I can't justify buying a $600 piece of equipment for just one game though.
Bro that kick on the wall was dope
Who is the boss?  Peter Kraven Lizard???
Anyone else hear Peter say Harry’s dying?? Green goblin for sure gonna be in this game and but who’s gonna be in the suit 👀
Sick af.. goty
I miss when we could change the time of day in the first Spider-Man back in 2018
Is it just me or is the detail of makeing peters voice more grumbly suit him perfectly with the symbiote suit
Miles Morales isn't Spider-Man
Im glad that Sasuke's English VA voices Peter
I'm through the first 5 min and it already looks amazing...
web of shadows vibes
instead of so do i peter should've said mine are bigger
I hope in this universe that the suit is an  alien and not made from Peter's spider blood
I am so ready for this game!
Seeing how strong and dangerous Kraven is, imagine if he got ahold of the venom symbiote…. Or god forbid, what if he had been bitten by the spider that bit Peter, dude would be unstoppable
Console players are thrilled to be able to play at 30 to 20fps
Not a big deal but I wish he had the white rectangles on his hand like spiderman tas
In this game, the symbiote is a menace
VFX 💥❣️
6:45 Peters entry here is terrifying
Mid
This is crazy awesome
I love peter when hes black
I seriously hope they add multiplayer in this game
Really hoping those stupid taskmaster challenges do not return in this game
I want to see him hunt Thanos an fail miserably
It’s beautiful
The new web os shadows
Curious if they'll go the TAS-route and have Eddie on the hunt for pics of Connors with Peter putting some dirt in his eye causing him to lose his job, thus marking the start of his hatred for Spider-Man.  If Eddie is even in the game, that is.
I'm so excited, I'm gonna replay Miles Morales because honestly I don't remember the end stuff with Conors and Harry😅
Cant fricken wait this bouta be hype
Please Insomniac I hope you upgraded Peters face change or brought back the original face because it’s the only thing I don’t like about this game
I hope the full release replaces “so do I” with “so do we”
I'm really looking forward to this. too bad I have to wait like 2 extra years to get it because I'm on pc. the only thing I don't really like is the wing suit it kinda feels like the traversal is too fast but I guess you don't have to use it
So pumped for this game only to remember that Peter now looks like a 15 year old under the mask. Still excited I just hope he keeps the mask on for most of the game lol
Yeah this isn’t beating Zelda Tears of the Kingdom💀
The waters look crap
If Venom is playable will symbiote Spider-Man's upgrades carry over to him?
I knew Yuri would be the best pick for Peter going rogue. His performance as Simon the Digger in Gurren Lagann shows his range and I'm happy he finally gets another role just like that.
Hope this game is gonna be awesome like the others Spiderman games:)
Potential spoiler final Boss fight will be against venom (maybe with edie brok because we can see him in trailer 8:28)
Seriously why have you added a flying suit that put me off the game straight away no longer Spider-Man swinging on the website now not feeling it
No ghost of Tsushima 2 ?
Hopefully they dont make it so you can't switch to symbiote after the end of the story. And hopefully, HOPEFULLY, they add this game to ps4, even if it might be the last game they add to ps4. My life wouldn't be complete if I don't play as a symbiote spiderman in an insomniac game
PEAK
This looks incredible
Definitely an Arkham feel in this one... which is goooood
I really wish it was coming to pc
What was miles hanging from at 3:36
This game is going to make billions of dollars 💵 ❤. I love the fact that marvel never disappoints from movies to animation to games 😊🔥🔥.
It looks so great
They should change the name of the game to Marvel's 2 Spider-Men
BEKLEDİĞİN TÜRKÇE YORUM BENİM. BEĞEN ULAN.
I hope Pete at some point becomes a boss and you will have to fight him as Miles. That would be epic.
Seeing this trailer makes me even more sad that I have to pay 500 for a PS5 just to play this.  Also I'm probably the only person that thinks this but the Venom Suit looks kinda stupid ngl
You can really hear Sasuke in Venom Spider-Man's voice
I like to move sets of the black suit. Those are some pretty good news.🎉
11:37 How much you wanna bet he wasn't talking about "Us" as in him and Miles?
This about too be another game of the year masterpiece from Sony 🥱
This is super cool I can’t wait for Spider-Man two to come out. This is about to be lit. We are about to see new suits new things even the black suit ever since he revealed the first part of this it’s actually true Spider-Man two is coming and if you want to know, it’s on PlayStation five. This is about to be fun. I can’t wait to the date comes.
4:41 no shot
Waiting to see venom vs spidey
will it come out for playstation 2? i cant afford 5
"SHOCKKERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME!!!!  I'LL CHASE YOU TO  THE ENDS OF THE EARRRTHHH!!!" vibes
Oh snap we got Spider man 3 black suit back and Mike’s morales cross play 😍😍 game finna be so fire !! What if Miles morales get the dark suit …..
Quick analysis: it seems like they did a super intelligent job of streamlining combat. It looks like you use r1 or l1 with face buttons to trigger different gadgets and possible l2 to shield as pete? Huge improvement over the gadget mess in one.
Man I really wonder if Peter straight up becomes Venom in this game. Remember the original trailer with Venom talking? I wonder if that was actually Peter, not Eddie. Miles having to fight Peter would be CRAZY!
Wow! This looks so dang fun 🤩
Pls put this on ps4 aswell , i would pay
The new Prototype game looks awesome!
I'm doing my 5th 100% playthrough of the first game rn. I plan on doing 1 more run on it and miles morales when this game comes out. THEN I'm gonna play it 😅
What makes me curious is whether he's in the early or mid stages of the suit's impact on his mind.  As we all know, the suit eventually makes him way more aggressive till the shock of his actions causes him to snap out and realise he needs to remove the suit.   Feels like that moment of revelation might be mid game based on what we see here.
Looks good
Might as well make it Mikes Morale’s spider man 2
Yeeeeeessssss!!!!!!
When this coming out and how much will it be
I hope if Peter loses Venom it attaches to someone new who is like a plot twist character that they meet along the way
Miles really did a Kamehameha this game will be GOTY
Im super interested to see if there will be different combat in and out of the symbiote suit and by how much
"SHOCKER!!! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME! ILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!!!"
Somehow reminds me of web of shadows
We knew Kraven and Venom where in it.... Pretty sure there’s gonna be a green goblin  But no idea about Lizard!
Definitely preordering this ‼️
These graphics seem to be on low quality :))
Release on pc
reminds me of the Arkham games
Pleaseeeeee come with co-op! 😊
Now that's more like it! That's the Spider-man I remember woo!
That was pretty Amazing guys. I'm looking forward to seeing more !
trash
Hope the symbiote makes a real change to my face.
4:59 miles really did the haduken 😂
The graphics are 🔥
Yo seeing Peter toss that civilian down at the end and snatch the tracking device from Miles was so disheartening. Insomniacs character work on this game is great, it feels uncomfortable to see Peter this way, it’s not heroic. I’m so looking forward to this
It wouldn't be too much to ask to be able to play as Venom down the road right???  RIGHT!?? Lol.
The detail in the venom suit is amazing. You can see the living creatures gleam of the suit. Also, how Peter is aggressive, anxious, and annoyed is a great touch. It was also a good detail in how he saved the civilian but still threw home with no regard for the well-being of him. This is going to be such a good game.
Oh god we’re gonna have to fight Pete at some point, aren’t we
This is gonna be an epic game!
I think I've watched this quite literally a dozen times since this dropped  I am very much hyped for this game; a bigger open world, the black suit, double takedowns, Miles' new power,  kraven the hunter, the underarm webs for both Peter AND Miles, the lizard, Tombstone & Taskmaster coming back, Yuri becoming Wraith, NO SCREWBALL. This is gonna be GotY; guaranteed   Little annoyed that i have to buy a whole other console just to play it but I'll get over it
GOTY RIGHT HERE. I’M CALLING IT🔥   Imma comeback to this trailer when the game drops or becomes GOTY😂
The animation of water is 👎
does it have co-op player
The slimy look doesn’t fit. Should have made it look like tas
buying a ps5 j for this game
Buying a PS5 and a new TV just for this game!
He actually sounds like Sasuke Uchiha now
FINALLY. a game to surpass web of shadows
👎👎👎👎👎👎
Too lit
We are gonna be fighting dinosaurs and monster and 2 AMAZING villains W game
YESSSS!!!!
Why did they add that first scene in this one? It’s not in the one on the PlayStation Channel
*Said it before I'll say it a second time... I NEED A PS5 😭😭😭😭*
Ooh we got a slight Wraith design
WE ARE SPIDER-MAN.
Games is gonna be lit can’t wait
How did Peter even get the symbiote suit? There was nothing about it in the end of Miles Morales game.
Also, aside from MJ and Miles, Harry Osborne is one of the few close friends, who feels like family, Peter has left, and  SPOILERS           having lost Aunt May in the previous game, it's understandable that his desperation and anxiety to save Harry or prevent another such loss would drive him to darkly embrace the symbiote...
2:31 best scene
1080p?? Is this a joke?
This is what the plot of No Way Home should've been. Except with Daredevil instead of Miles Morales.
Wow 2023 just got a whole lot better
never seen such exciting game in my life
I am so hyped
Why it looks same as Spiderman 1? Time for ps5 Pro immediately.
Future me dis is before the game comes out lmk how it was 💯
So this is just a better version of Web of Shadows
LETS GO
Looks great!
Will launch on Steam?
Yuri bringing out his inner sasuke 💀
Man these camera movements are dizzying.
İron man or superman games plaseee
Yes!! Women criminals!! Once I realized, I couldn't NOT focus on the fact that every single criminal or baddie you fight in the first game was a dude. Like, this is huge @$$ city! How are only men breaking the law? XD
Goty
Ah… This is Something else.
this looks FIRE! insomniac back at it again!
Dude, we need PlayStation to release this on PS4
Brooo I’m so exited for this game
What’s Doomfist doing with Kraven? I can’t believe Yoskue Hanamura has to deal with all this!
I believe that this mission where Peter jumps out of the basement happened when the symbiote had just infected him, this is the first mission in the black suit in the game, because when they met with Miles, Miles was surprised by his new suit and in his phone he had it marked in red mask. In the end, he generally says that "he never was like that." Screen this comment.
I will be in 10 years😢😢
I understand now. Shame I’m a PS4 gamer, so I can’t experience it
Hope we get some bully Maguire references in there 😂
Looks fun but really more of the same
This is so amazing! I’m getting movie quality vibes.
Really love what i see. I just hope the game is completly developed when they release it.....
At 8:20 Miles didn't defeat the two other hunters lol
I guess Xbox is so jealous 😂
Is it just me or does Spiderman when he says "he is gonna wish he never came to New York" sound like Matpat doing an impression of Bully Maguire
remind me of prototype
Every time I see venoms powers SOOO SATISFYING
It looks better than a movie and that symbiote suite is sick
Yuri's Saskue rage go crazy.
22,580 comments 😶😶
11:37 I must have watched this scene about 35 times. The way he said “so do I” was so cold it was bone chilling
3 days after my birthday 🥳 , this is legendary 🔥
Bro miles vs Peter can't wait
What's really coooooool
@CinnamonToastKen at 00:00 hehe
Peter in Spiderman 1: Hey Guys  Peter Tries on Black Air Force 1's  Peter in Spiderman 2: HE'S MYNE
Here we go again!!!
We’ll be back in a couple years
Almost reminds me of Ultimate Spider-Man, where you can play as Ultimate Venom.
Sasuke is really angry in this one
This vs Redfall. Easy win for the Xbox. It's actually sad ngl 😢
i want
My God !!!!! What a cool game it will be
WOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Venom: dont worry im a side character for now
bloodborne is better no matter what they do
Eu gostei desse nome dele do homem-aranha 2 número da Silva vai jogar eu quero ver o Venom e O Lagarto❤
Oh my God I love it!!!!
Pleaseeeee come to ps4 !!!!!!!!!!
Man these guys are back with a banger!
Shut up and take my money
I’m so excited!!!
I can already tell Miles is gonna have to face off against Symbiote Pete in this game. Because this is Insomniac they probably going to incorporate elements from Spiderman 3, Web of Shadows, and the animated shows. Man I can't wait.
Witness miles vs pete action
Release this on PS4 as well 😡
The graphics of the game are not up to the 9th generation, the water quality is terrible, the gameplay mechanisms are not that different, we expected much more than this.
Hands down the best Spider-Man game
Looks Like Spiderman Had A Baby With Prototype 🔥
Game bought to go crazy
😮😮😮😮❤❤❤
why you were to lazy to add 2 players co-ap 😭😭
Is no one going to talk about Spider-Man just ended someone’s entire lineage 3:11?
This is 2023 bruh, make this 4k
I love insomniac. So hyped for this! Where’s the wolverine trailer though? I need that next lol
Theres something about the way Peter responds to Miles and the sudden change in the suit around his eyes at 11:53 that makes me wonder if Peter himself isnt Venom and the suit allows Peter to change between the black suit or Venom
I’m sold, buying a PS5 right now
At this point we dont even need the movies!!! 😆
From the second Peter threw that guy like he was nothing Miles was like whoah wtf dude 😭
I kinda want Venom to be the second villain in this story. Miles fights a last hard battle with him to get Peter back to his normal self. Not new concept I know. But still.
I wanted [PROTOTYPE3]
You barely control Spider-Man lol it’s 90% qte and cut scenes. 😂
Algún día voy a tener la Play5 😢
Now all I need is a scene where peter goes berserk on the villains after having enough of em and doesn’t hold back.
Wow 😂 0:18
Imagine being excited for a mindless button masher with quick time events and early PS4 graphics when there are games like Elden Ring and Zelda Tears of the Kingdom on the market.  Couldn't be me 😅
Man just take my money already 🔥🔥
Y’all wanna take a second and thank PlayStation for making exclusive bangers left and right?   Which is more than I can say for micro$oft 💀
This game is going to be fire 🔥
Why did they made the lizard look like Godzilla? 😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀
Can’t wait
Loving the symbiote suit!! Can’t wait! Hope we get to use it for the majority of the game if we want.
Only legends remember Spider-man shattered dimensions
Cool, this games gonna play like crap on the PC port!
SYMBIOTE LETS GO
Where was the gameplay?
S… su….. spider kiss?…. Maybe a zip to point?….. no? Ok…..
I need an exact release date now bro im to exited
I love the fact that he saves the pedestrian, and proceeds to throw him on the ground afterwards. It shows the suit and his mind are actually fighting for his actions.
Can't wait for the new game, Keep going developers!
Bro, the spidermen got too OP in this game.
Bully Parker i love it ❤️💀❤️
peter vs miles final battle????
Yo oh man
Guys it was peak.
Spider-Man will always be the best, miles is cool as well; it’s cool their introducing the symbiotes into the universe
Just imagine the strength of Kraven hanging a buffed guy and snapping his neck with just one hand
Finally. After nearly 2 decades since I played Ultimate Spider-Man on the gamecube, I finally get to swing around Queens again!
This game looks insane!
lol at 10:44 the fish falling back with him 😂
I can’t wait for this game to come out
This is gonna be fun. They better add the rami version of the symbiote suit
I can hear some sasuke in his voice, this is gonna be gooood🎉
Ради такого стоит и плойку купить
Black suit is op  They did it right
Enter Venom … 😎
prototype vibe
Man we need a live action movie like this.
You can’t tell me some of these npcs weren’t killed💀
This is literally like the arkham games
I wanna play it so bad but i don't have PlayStation
Sony haven’t Peter out here Murking people.
Looks like an cheap app for iOS or android
I think some parts of the music was taken from old NES game 'The return of sinister six' 🤔
Hey me in ten years, “You grow slow in your old age”
Did you notice Spider-man's lenses moving into Venom's shape when he said SO DO I?
bring it fastttttttt !!!!!!!!!!
The transition from Peter to Miles and the music is so clean
1:20 ITS THE GUY FROM THE SABLES I FORGOT HIS NAME
26/may/2023
I hope they add the pizza delivery missions again.
this will be a nostalgia one day
This gives me "Prototype" vibes. I'd love to see a remake of that game, or a new installment
i played both spider-man games a 100 percent  and was absolutely in love with them. but this is just too much imo... the flying the sci-fi to the overkill animations .  hurts to see that the game ive been waiting years for .... isnt what it used to be.
Man it's good to see a game where Peter uses the symbiote again.
i cant afford a ps5......
Can't wait to play it on my PS3 Peter!!
Did they change the voice actors? They don’t seem to be the same as Spiderman 1 and Spiderman Miles Morales. Edit: No, they’re the same voice actors according to a PSLS blog.   Anyways, it seems they greatly improved the moves list. Awesome. And I love Kraven the Hunter and Lizard as villIains. I wonder if we’ll see green goblin.
😊🎉❤ oh my god 🕷️
His personality will get worse as it goes on, and he will begin to do and say some nasty stuff until he gets rid of it through  some sort of sonic sound, church bell most likely
So far so good. I played the previous games and this one conquers them. Gameplay,Graphics,voice acting...Symbiote Spidey surprised me, the same goes for Lizard's evolution...To bad that I won't enjoy it, since i don't have PS5
I’ll come back in 7 years when everyone revisits this game for nostalgia
Why it’s not a co-op game yo 🤦🏾‍♂️
looks like it could run on a PS4 with a downgraded version
Peter sounds so menacing. Love the voice actings!
just take my money already.
I hope we can fight shocker again in this game and Spider-Man says his famous quote "You can't escape me, I'll chase you the end of earth shockerrrr!!!!"
Xbox fans fuming rn 😂
On Kraven's Pad, the map shows Peter and Miles Spiderman, Black Cat, Prowler, Wraith (Yuri Watanabe), Sinister Six, including Kingpin, Taskmaster, Lizard, and one unidentifiable figure at the corner.
remember seeing the villan in Ultimate spiderman where he killed white tiger's family
Guys this video is going to cross so many views and when you saw this I pray you live longer and happy
Peter bout to release his Susano
Chumu game
AMAZING SPIDERMAN  2 JUST WOW
I want this badly.  To bad it's only for the ps5
Anybody else love the fact that ganke got so into the fight he screamed the entire way up to blowing up the helicopter
Looks solid.
Dang he just gon toss dude like a wet rag like that 😂 11:33
Interesting that Peter is actually using the symbiote abilities of the black suit, the powers look badass. Makes me wonder if they’re going to do a play on Kravens Last Hunt
Soundtrack when Miles is swinging in the city, holy crap.  They've done it again, once with Miles' trailer on his own game, and again here mixing trap beats with intense Spiderman cinematic harmony
Reminds me of prototype
rtx 5090 recommended system spec 🤣🤣🤣
Already know Genke’s going to be an annoying character
pls upgrade the graphic
Peter really got that Black Air Force energy in this one.
This lookin hard af
Well im glad the webs are black but I’d like the swinging animations to be different
I will enjoy observing others play this game as man that is high speed nuts. Outstanding to watch!
Why the soundtrack at the beginning sound similar to the sound track
This is gonna be a good game and I KNOW everyone will enjoy it
So what if Kraven “kills” Peter whilst in the black suit, giving Venom a reason to find a new host and ultimately becoming the final boss of the game
0:41 destiny darkness theme
I'm so hyped!!!!!!
Please tell me he starts saying “we” instead of “I” later in the story
I can't wait but are you downloading on ps4?
Seeing Queens in this game makes me remember Ultimate Spiderman ❤
Is this game coming to ps4 just like ps5 versions
Wow so Insane😮😮
there are cooldowns can't wait for the TGBS vid
This looks beautiful, but it sounds like Peter's doing an angry Sasuke impression. I love the nod to superman 64, flying through the rings lol but they managed to make it look fun here.
cant wait for this game to be on pc, dont feel like buying it on ps5 then pc hahahaha
Graphics are really disappointing
this looks sick
Like I’m gonna be able to buy a ps5 for this they’re way too expensive
My only hope is that they  incorporate the space alien origin here and not the made in a lab one. Symbiote is still the Symbiote but I much rather prefer the alien origin than the lab one
9:45 bro his eye lags from small to big the next frame😂
This finna go sooooo crazy
OK I'm just going to say it,  little disappointed we dont get a peter dancing down the street scene, maybe there saving the best for those who pay for the game
I thought the graphics will improve a lot 😢
Essa força toda? Era prós bandidos explodirem com as tripas pra fora
I want to see miles find out what the suit is and see him and Peter fight and nearly killing miles.
I’m excited for this game
can we talk about how Pete disrespected that one guy at 3:11 😂He did him dirty!!!
6:45 Slenderman???
This was better than a movie
Amazing 😮😮🙌Game.... Spider Man 2 is one of the next most anticipated game For waiting 😑😑After Gta 6...😮😮.....1st impression Is Massive ❤️😮
Yoooooo
I think Peter will eventually be evil or sum cuz of venom
5:07 I just love how the enemies in the warehouse die in 1 single hit during combat. We know that won't be in the game at all...
Seems like Angelo Bronte survived that alligator biting down on him and became a badass huh?
I hope peters face is fixed that's all bro
PS1 graphics
Yes! Bully McGuire (pretty much) lol
Peter will end up getting jealous over miles doing better than him
I've always thought that any spiderman game will ever be as good as Web of Shadows, but this, this is hype in another level.
Looks corny
Oh man I knew this was gonna top Web of Shadows!
Love that late dodge he does around 3:12 yet the a.i. doesn't disgustingly track him like in the previous 2...fake gameplay for the win! Let's see what other bullshit they put in the trailer that won't actually be in game to the capacity they showed in trailer, if at all...
Add co-op
To whoever is reading this keep going, you’re doing fine! No matter how slow your progress, each new week is filled with tiny steps forward. Be proud of yourself you got this
PROTOTYPE
Gonna be spending at least a thousand hours just swinging and gliding
Yes 😊
#5 Trending...That shows how brainwashed y'all are. The gaming community has been fully infiltrated and compromised. Abandon ship
Why are you only attacked by one enemy at a time? Do the others wait their turn? I hate these thing😂
out in pc?
This game is a scam. insomniac is a scam. Marvel only makes cash grabs. Remember that
Why add gliding? Best part of a Spidey game is the web-slinging. Now theres gonna be a bunch of glider missions that are just flying through glowing circles. If you cant get there with webs, just dont go!
You still haven't fixed the story in Miles Morales, yet you are doing another game already? You don't even know what a finished game is at this point
Xbox players rn 😢😢😢😢
Gonna be trash
Why did miles’ electricity change from orange to blue?
I wish Miles's super powers were yellow, they couldn't be blue, I hope we can change it in the game
3:11
Gonna get this 😅
Sasuke playing Peter Parker 🤔
Please be it to ps4 please😊
Why is there venom here
WOKE
Dear developers, the game turns out to be too soapy on the graphics and visually looks weak, frankly weak water movement people movement visually looks very weak, that is, it still needs to be finalized a lot and the Peter Parker symbiote costume looks somehow not standard I didn't really like it too much  the wide shape of the head and eyes looks bad not by the standard the suit of Peter Parker the symbiote looked very different in other games and films and it does not look very intense his head is like a helmet too big round and wide the design of the suit looks like a body armor you can see from the texture that he is some kind  uneven, not smooth, it's like armor, it looks strange, but according to the graphics it's like the first part of Ito the graphics in the first part look much better the graphics are very soapy somehow you don't feel the game on x Gena would really like Miles's mission over water with boats to become more complicated because over water  it's very difficult to fly and somehow everything should be easy to be realistic, but with the visualization in the game there's a big problem half of the textures don't load normally the lizard at all like some kind of Godzilla there's also a problem with street lighting a problem with shadows it looks like it's a 3d model it's  does not look like a living city like google maps
Bring it on Xbox.
Lovin' the venom suit and how Peter is more aggressive, authoritarian, and dismissive. Now I am hyped for two games. This and the MGS3 remake.
3:15 this is something else
"Look at little Kraven Jr. Gonna cry?"
Ps5 only?
Basketball Spider-Man
They changed the voice actor to Mat Pat lol
What a beast!  3:02 Peter: HE IS GONNA WISH HE NEVER CAME TO NEW YORK!
Crooked Hillary 🤥
Idk man i see some recycled animation
Eh......black suite looks kinda crappy. I thought it was co-op. Not really impressed.
The Venom costume is very good, but the visual effects in the game in the year 2023 seem to be using the technology 10 years ago. I expected much better quality
Idk when the showcase was live people was complaing about the black suit honestly as a childhood fan I love it because it's classic with a modern touch on his shoulders because it's mimicking his advanced suit shoulders in a way that's why the shoulders are buldged a lil gives it a more muscular look but yeah plus they already said every suit will have its own version of the black suit in game so if y'all can switch if you don't like this one but me personally it's perfect homage to the fans 💯
holy Cringe  Petes VA is horrible  with that suit on
It’s just too bad that it’s going to be the remastered Peter as the face behind Venom and not the ps4 one. The ps4 version with the anger and the conflict that Venom is causing him would be much better to see then the new baby plastic face. Yuri’s excellent voice acting is going to be the only thing that sells it.
That gun ship looks exactly like the one in COD Advanced Warfare 🤔
Coop was the only reason i was interested in this game.  With that off the table, im just going to watch the ending you YT
😈😈😈😈😈😈
I never realized how much the Sasuke (Youth) voice actor sounds like Tobi in his symbiote suit 🔥
Ayo miles with the kamehameha at 5:00, when did Goku teach him that?
Ok hear me out what if the symbiote gets to black cat as well and then things get a little bit more havoc between both of them which leads to miles and someone else to fight them
Man at 11:03 Pete just tossed the sign casually and miles had to web it so it wouldn't land on anybody was a nice little detail on Pete's thought process lol
Looks awesome, cant wait to play it in a few years
So the bullshit fake flies now... great.
Sasuke become Spider-Man lmao
I expected a lot and got more
I love how everyone is just realizing peter's va also voiced sasuke
Bro showed no mercy 😂
We’ve been getting a lot of great games recently, a wonderful time for gaming
I like how the soundtrack changed when they switched from Peter to Miles. It to the difference between them allowing them to be two different characters.
See you in 10 years when someone wants to relive memories of this game
About time they brought the Symbiote in
1:54 reminds me of prowler's theme
We should. Have a game mechanic where you can customize your spider suit and color where you take the chest mask arms legs and being able to change the color of your suit I think I’m my opinion it would be cool to have a mixture of different suits in one suit/ not the thing where you can change the suit in the menu what I was talking about earlier I think people would buy the game more if they could do that
Looks great I’m sure the symbiote plot will be the main focus as story progresses. Gameplay was amazing.
This game will be a certified hood classic if Symbiote Spidey says “See ya chump”
Looks great! Hope there’s more cameos from villains that weren’t in the first one. Dying to see how insomniac would handle mysterio
Coming soon to Xbo...oh hang on a minute..
there's basically an infinite amount of things i love about this but my favorite by far is when peter is being serious, just like iron man. the interaction between miles and peter is like tony and peter in the spider man homecoming movie, he's become the one he adores the most and this was my most favorite detail of this game
I'm sure like many fans here ypu were happy to hear the agressiveness in Spidey's vocie and attacks. Even the way he handled saving that one man at the end.
I’m 41 and am probably more excited than my 6 year old for this game. Lol
This is why we let insomniac cook.
when can we actually play it?
I think this Most Anticipated and Must-play AAA Superhero single-player or coop video-game, Marvel's Spider-man 2 PS4/PS5 sequel video-game is already sure win in the prestigious awarding event called The Game Awards.
Is black suit spider man sasuke from naruto?
Yuri's Nathan Explosion deliveries on symbiote Peter's lines are really over the top. It's almost as bad as the 1994 animated series.   Although, I guess that series did create the idea of the symbiote making him more aggressive, so maybe it's appropriate...
07:34 - Get out of here, stalker.
So I’m a little confused when did Peter get the symbiot
finally kraven the  hunter
There's finally a black spider man, let's gooooooo
Here's my question : what will peter do that will make him get rid of the symbiote?
I love black suit spidey, he's basically vegeta
Guys if this game doesnt have the Tobey Maguire dance I'm not buying it.
That mean Eddie Brock will be in the game in end and mile will be the one fight Peter save him
Iwill play this game🤩 I love spiderman🥰 I have every spiderman from ps4 I dont have a ps5🥺
Really hope they have some awesome suits. I've been seeing a bunch of modded suits in my TikTok lives that are awesome and I wonder why they can't add them to the game. Once you beat the story sometimes all you really want to do is swing around NYC in a really cool suit you like. I saw one today of the 2099 suit but it looked alike the cartoon version from the spider verse movies it was pretty sick
Where i can play?
Nooooooooooooooooosssa!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Esse vai ser o jogo do ano!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Que trabalho perfeito, parabéns a todos os envolvidos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The whole thing looks awesome, but I’m gonna have to get used to Pete’s voice in the Symbote suit. I get that its changing him, but it sounds a bit odd to me that it changes so much.
Angelo Bronte!
All that's left to do is to bring back Peters normal face and not the Tom Holland one
Peter going dark love it
Oh boy I can't wait to play Spider-Man in 2023 when it comes o-  Oh, it's a PS5 exclusive and is coming to PC later? Just insert the Spongebob "mwomp" sound.
I just love that Yuriko will be seemingly Wraith at this point in the story. Really excited to see how that goes.
Well well well, the game looks fantastic. Def gonna play it
Been waiting for this since 2019! I can tell this will be an awesome game to remember for years to come🤙🏻
imagine if this could be a coop game too
Increíble. Si tuviese la consola un pc que lo pudiese sorportar me lo compraba ya
just wanna say that miles swinging has been improved from last time, he looks so fluid now!
Ya and the crash of the helicopter and drones sure doesn't kill anyone else 🌚
the game is not like the past 2 games andd its so aggressive af
bruh just take my money
this video was released 1 day ago.
Im leaving my comment here on a historic video for when i wanna return to relive the memories...thank you all for being here aswell and ill see you all when you return  🫡
Kya game h yr
The graphics and gameplay looks extreme I am excited to play this art ✍🏾💯
Finally bro
This looks amazing! Going to be a long wait until it comes to PC but wow!
Love to see miles to
Amazing gameplay! Looking forward to the Pc port already!
xbox players : 👺
0:48 Scott Adkins would be the perfect cast for Kraven
how miles friend know the identity of spiderman? how did he got the venom? and from when Kraven has a team?
I aint buying the game if they aint reworking on the ui
I like the way they changed the total peter persona total dismissive about miles
Man this looks super fun
If I saw the lizard I would just call my freind Kevin
seeing the queens high school with its football stadium and venom immediately reminded me of ultimate spider man on the ps2
Coming back here when I finally get the game
After a closer look it appears they have reused animations. This wouldn’t bother me but they went back and used the same swinging animations for Peter from the first game and along with that there is the effect where he floats mid air before actually shooting a web. Quite disappointing honestly, especially swinging with the symbiote wouldn’t he be faster and more in tune?
still no ps5💯💀
This man's gonna do the Shocker scream
Making a video on this rn, it's just too perfect
Why are there 2 spider mans (spidermen?) In this game? And why does one have the Venom suit and Venom powers?
"He's got big teeth" "So do I" And the eyes becomes likes venom's eyes...  Perfect.
Im kinda scared for pete man…I am now thinking he is gonna be the final boss like you fight him as miles trying to save him from the symbote
You can tell how the venom suit effect peter
Is that villain Lizard or Stegron!?
this game is fantastic!!
They really want to keep people indoors 😂😂😂😂😂
Maybe a "Marvel's Spider-Man 3" could adapt the Superior Spider-Man storyline in which Peter Parker and Doc Ock switch bodies temporarily.
I’m so excited for this game
“He’s got big teeth!”   “So do I.”
11:51 *”So do I”* hit so hard
The only thing I want out of this game is to run though that cafe from the e3 trailer for the first spider man game
the camera  needs to be closer to the character and the world around you.. that makes it realistic
I hope this title comes to pc too…ps5’s are a pain to get.
3:33 Peter: “I’m not gonna make it in time!😱”  Miles: — Slingshots himself 20 blocks in a manner of seconds… like it’s nothing at all —  😂😂😂WoW what an excuse for co-op mode. But whatever, i guess i’m here for it…
I can't wait for this to drop
This will get out before gta 6
This game LOOKS UNREAL, its AMAZING!!! I have a ps4, this may convince me to upgrade to a ps5
The combos though
This game will be the pinocle of peak
“Metal murder bird” seems to a homage to the Vulture at 8:47
The little details are the best. Kraven symbiote suit harrys dying the lizard
Sony first party titles are the only games I trust to launch in a polished, playable state now.
As the age old tradition goes, we're bringing back black suit spider-man, which means we might get a venom appearance :D
The fact that venom says so do I is so badass
gyhu
Peter and Miles? Oh hell yes
i'd buy a PS5 just to play this
Not on PS4?😭
if only the movies were this good
This ain’t Peter ladies and gentlemen, this is Sasuke.
**Where's me 4K60fps footage! 1080p30? What is this 2010??**
THEY BETTER MAKE THIS FOR PS4 AS WELL
I love kraven
After that video my Dopamin levels gonna suffer lol. Can't wait and Btw how fast miles traveled trough the city made me almost come
This is Freaking Awesome Can't Lie im So Excited 😸😸😸😸!!
Can’t wait for this comment to be seen 10 years from now
Great way they handled the personality change here
Any news about Daredevil?
That was the fastest 12 minutes of my life.
I have a wild theory, so hear me out. Harry is dying right? So what if the Connor made the cure for Harry, but it turns out to be Goblin Serum. Please tell me i'm not the only one whose thinking this right now.
they changed the interface AND miles electricity colour! at first it was comic accurate but then they changed it. maybe for the spider verse movie? idkk id love to know the reason
"So do I😈" BRO I'M SO SO SO SO EXITED
I wanted the yellow/orange lighting for Miles
11:54 man y'all didn't  noticed his eyes changed his eyes changed fr the symbiote is taking over
Will it be on ps4? But I like the new graphics and the new stacks like the way you can web 2 at once and you can make web polls! and you can go 10x the speed as normal and the new story hope its on ps4
Thats a good joke
Marvel if you see this comment have venom go into the lizard! It would be so cool!
In 5 years on this date 26.5.2023. I will be seeing this video finishing college and feel hella nostalgic.
Miles kamehameha 4:59 😮 so awesome
Davy jones treme quando ve tudo isso de informação
The amount of times im gonna play this game is unimaginable
Angry Sasuke??
Looks alright
Hola!
Web of shadows 👀
Right so game 2 Peter Parker is an idiot and Miles Morales is the smart one..... yeh not interested.
Web of shadows vibes!
The abilities of spider-man (including Miles) is just too much in my opinion! This should be a game about THE spider-man, not about their overpowered abilities!  This is like comparing CSGO to Valorant!
I wonder why Miles' venom is blue now. The hunters say to watch out for his new powers, I'm curious to see what that's all about.
THIS WILL BE SOOOOOOOO DOOOPE!
The lighting is very good, but a lot of things looks like ps3 graphics.
THAT EMO GUY AT START IS NOT NATTY
Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oh nah he built like a vondillybonker
Wow
Ye bro I'm not buying a ps5 for this game😠
Awesome, Cant wait
It’s so cool to see, the lizard, Kraven, and venom now as new villains however I am wondering on two things, will Norman or harry Osborn become the Goblin to hunt down spider man, and didn’t the first spider man had someone dressed at the lizard so wouldn’t that mean that dr Connors was the lizard once and Spider-Man defeated him, and it would make sense on why doc didn’t recruited him cause he was on Normans side
omg❤❤❤❤
Here I go watching this daily until the game drops lol.
Oh my GOD…this looks BEAST!
I hope this doesn't get a downgrade
WOW. That felt like watching a movie!! And we get to play it?? SO excited
be ready to play this in 2029 on pc
Just wanna say ive been here since the first game of spider-man
Now i am so excited for kraven the hunter 🔥🔥🔥
I need a ps5 bro
LOVE it but HATE the PP voice over work. Misses the mark. Badly. Dude is like 39 going on 13.
i hope they'll use peter's old face model for this.
Are you taking note here , rocksteady , ( should'nt need to after the great Arkham series ) But this is what fan's want, not what you've done with Suicide Squad kills Justice League.
COME OUT SOONER 😭😭😅
Sony needs to take their gaming department and merge with their animation department, THIS is what a Spider-Man Movie should look like.
Am i the only one who find spiderman games to be boring ?
So exited to see how Peter gets the symbiote in this game! As massive fan of Venom I hope he’s in the game a lot though
Gaming God: how many marvel games you want? Marvel: Yes
can't wait
This game look like so much fun
I’m excited for this. Spider man fan since kid nothing makes me more excited about this 🔥🔥
Well I've put off buying a PS5 long enough since it seems
1080p30?
bro thid game is gonna be FIRE 💥❤️‍🔥
Short version worth the goddamn wait
Bro that slingshot at 3:41 sent Miles several blocks in a few seconds. Man glad to see the PS5 can handle them traversing at faster speeds now
Sony is becoming Ubisoft. Releasing "more of the same" games with few tweaks and strictly made by their template and i am bored with it already. I will pass this one. I was not even able to finish Miles. This game looks good at the parts you don't play and it doesn't worth my time.
Is it Christmas, cause this is a wishlist: Kraven, Venom Suit Arc, New Finishers, Both Spider-Man and Miles, Spider-Wings and cooler air travel through the city…Sony knows how to improve on greatness!!!!
I will be getting PS 5 this year for 3 games,  Spiderman 2, Tekken 8 and Street Fighter 6. Yes sir!
No PS4 ? Thumbnail of the video was with PS4, i thought it will be for PS4 as well.
I've been waiting for this game for so long! And now I'm devastated. I won't be able to play it.. The fact that it's only on ps5 makes me wanna die. 😩
Bro sounds like Matt Pat Hello everyone! And welcome to Brooklyn!!
This is sick!!!!
Disappointing. Not as good as I expected
Keep it up playstation u made the Master piece ✌🏻 I am realy excited for the game plz launch it's fast!!!
Guess I’m buying a ps5 now
I’m gonna be back in about idk 5 years?
Omg
This is for PS 3?
And the wait begins!
7:38 and 8:42 sounds so good but the entire soundtrack is amazing I can’t wait to play this every day
pls ps4
Why the lizard is so huge?!
The alien life’s form know as “venom” IN THE GAME now that means 😳
Disappointed in this being a next gen title and the water still looks like a gta3 game. But regardless, everything else is amazing and love all the details. Except the stupid water.
peak
That suits really bringing out that inner Sasuke.
Definitely buying this one!
Me before watching the trailer: Finally some info about this game.  Me after watching the trailer: A couple of minutes ago wouldn't have been so bad either.
Sheesh
Am i watching a movie?Cuz this is firee
Bro I’m telling you before it happens 100%Spider-Man vs Spider-Man
This game is 100% gonna be game of the year
Esto sera epico
The piano keys tho
İs it coming ps4
what a terrible graphics
Im definitely getting that dam game
6:46 pure villain vibes from Spiderman & 11:32 the way he dropped that guy... So gentle 💀
Noticed that despite the symbiote making Peter more aggressive, he's still helping people despite being rough. Normally the symbiote would be like "forget them focus on your enemies" but that's not the case here. A *Lethal Protector*
some mfer hopefully gonna see my comment in like 20 years
the background score is sooo goood!!
So we gonna pretend that miles didn’t hit dude with an electric kamehameha and chidori
The symbiote takes over the lizard to become venom at full size perhaps??
Guys dont get me wrong but the first game teaser like 5 years ago and after all that waiting we get the same graphic same animations thats little sad. In my opinion this not a spider man 2 its just a spiderman Venom DLC
Bro can't wait for that new game🎉
i like his angry, passionate voice
Game just plays itself, lame
For pc as wel pleaseeeeee
Marvel's Infamous Prototype. Coming fall 2023.
i wish web lines would stretch when weight is added
Meh, just looks like the first one with a different story. No different gameplay elements, graphical fidelity etc.
I can’t believe it’s already been 10 years since this game has been published :D!  *sorry to who ever is going to send this message 10 years later , coz I beat you to it …10 years ago …😂
Did anyone notice the music between miles and peter, the Swinging theme of peter is different and dark because of Venom And Whenever we Switch To Miles His Beats From The Previous game starts.
Kinda wish people would stop making the symbiote turn Peter emo. That’s not what it did in the first appearance
Wow! This looks incredible!! Like watching a movie!
The voice actor of peter is the same as sasuke from naruto
12:03   FINAL BOSS??? 😮😮😮
I hope we get a side mission where we chase shocker just to throw in an Easter egg from Spiderman TAS
GET BACK HERE, KRAVEN! KRAVEEEEEEEEN! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME! I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE END OF THE EAAAAAAAARTH!
crazy how they're flying in our airspace. with no trouble at all.
Anybody notice they referenced the Web of Shadow NDS game with the combo at 3:10? It's crazy!
Whens it coming out
3:25 - 4:05 Love how the music has the classic Heroic feeling of Peter before transitioning into the funky Hip-Hop of Miles. Shows how well John Paesano's gotten over the years with perfecting the vibe of both Spider-Men.
So epic!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Im not even looking at the everything on this game. I'm buying the collectors edition
Bro its soooo good!
take my money
9:16 " TIME TO GO BOOM BOOM"😂😂 Hilarious 👍
amazing 💯❤‍🔥
I love when Peter is throwing citizens, Miles is giving him some weird looks and he thinks somthing is wrong
Bro the web gliding looks insane
3:53  You can fly in the new game!??
amazing
it's Amazing 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤😮
wow just mind blowing!I love this game already.
the soundtrack is GOING HARD!!!
This is venom + prototype mixing
Harry had the black suit then Peter went to see him and it attached onto him now he’s tryna save Harry
No graphical improvements, it's been years since the first release.
0:18 WHO WOULD TASTE IT?
id they kill peter parker im never giving sony any money again, miles sucks so hard (character wise)
OH I HOPE THES A BELL TOWER SCENE THATS A QTE
Wow just wow the love that had to be put into this🔥🔥
why does miles "shoots electricity" ?  Also, this looks fun af!
😂😂😂  trash
3:43 this gonna be so satisfying
Love how Miles still refers to him as Spider-Man despite knowing it’s Peter
Peter talks like an 11 year old emo boy
Honestly hope theres a choice to keep the symbiote suit. Or at the very least, fight Pete venom. Would make an amazing homage to Spiders shadow
Supeeeeeeeerb
Love the details;)
;)
This game fr finna be fire
i mean that's a whole section of the game that won't feel new now. guess this is how this stuff is marketed these days
SASUKE 😫😫
i sure hope this game will make you feel like spiderman
I feel for Xbox. Imagine watching this and then going "We have halo though?"
So, we getting that hammy shocker bit?
Oh god the sasuke voice 😈
Years after this game if you come here to remember how great the game was just drop by to say hi.
See you in 6 years when you wanna relive nostalgia
Peter went from “I’m your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man” to “peace was never an option” real quick
They have stole this spiderman character from the Aliens powers.. movie of Tom Cruise Edge of Tomorrow
I wanna see the original face here, not that babyface tom holland look alike. The previous guy looks like he could tear anyone apart when hes angry, the new one looks like hes going to prank somebody.
ps4もあるよなあ！
I think symbiot spidey wants the lizard for food
I like the horizon influence
if a pre order is available... Im buying now literally. This is a great Ad. Convinced me. And as a buyer and player of both games Spiderman and spiderman 2... You deserve our Money. Take it.  It looks fun and new and different.
sheesh bully maguire
Shattered dimensions stealth voice lines?! 4:45
well now they both have "venom"
Seamless web swinging is soo satisfying to watch,nice graphics also😮😮😮
ruthless kraven vs black suit spider-man, then probably black suit spider-man vs miles spider-man, then peter and miles vs venom. GOATED already.
Im so fuckin hyped man
Is Peter going to be the endboss..? :(
I LOVE THIS GAME
The sequel to Web of Shadows we've been waiting for.
Spider-Man sounding like he gone whip out a Chidori
Just from this, i can tell this about to be the most thrilling game of the year
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS GAME :DDDD i was a really big fan of the other two games
I think the final boss is going to be Peter but with venom
ill be back here in a few years to feed of nostalgia !! This is insaneeeeeee !!
I'm  gonna wish I never CAME to New York!!!
ALNASSR 💛💙💛💙💛
coming to pc also?
He even help get the fish for the fisherman 😂
Remember me😗
Is that sasuke’s va?
Don't recommend channel
soooo..... no co-op mode?
Remember the old spiderman where you couldn't even touch the city grounds and it was all fog and instant death look how far we've come :)
It’s becoming more like GTA 5
It really saddens me that a developer comes out with a great game like Spider-Man. Then it comes time to make a sequel and their best idea is “make it prettier.” It is still prettier than 99.9 percent of games, this looks like dlc
Can't wait to play this on PC!
This is how you do it. REAL. GAMEPLAY.
See you at 60
So press triangle & circle and then watch a cutscene? Rinse and repeat? 🤨 It’s now May 2023 and I’ve still not seen a game worth getting a PS5 for
notice how at 11:31 miles was confused as to why peter was so rough with the guy he saved. I cant wait for this game lol
Wow,another game that i probably won't play.
EPICCCC
I love the UI but they aint  keeping it the same. Because they did not do that with their other projects.
I expect the Toby Maguire Emo Dance in this Spider-man game. Otherwise, I'll be very disappointed 😝
I've been waiting on a Venom game for years, but I'm confident this will scratch the itch.
Yıl 2023 ve LoL sinematiklerinin nasıl daha iyi animasyonu oluyor
MILES DO THE KAMEHAMEHA POSE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Insomniac really needs to do Superman next.
This is going to be game of the year
So let me see if I got this right: they made the first spiderman game on PS4/PS5 etc, an absolute testament to Insomniacs level and then they come back with a nice standalone DLC that is reminicent of First Light (Infamous) and push the bar EVEN higher with an shokingly good locking 2nd Game??   GOOD LORD!!!
This is giving me serious prototype vibes and I am all for it!
سثث غخع هى 10 غثشقس
Can be Miles vs Peter Venom? 👀
3:03 I can feel how Venom is angry. This voice acting is perfect
be greater together would be really nice if it means with  symbiote and also coop
I am leaving his comment to come back to it after a few years
1:31 as you can see from here, we as spiderman game players finally can do the one thing we've always dreamed about doing, passing the bridge to another city
Hi Young one welcome to history join
will it be on pc?
🔥 🔥 🔥
This is just standard black suit fan game combat I want something fluid and brutal this is as violent as Let there be Carnage
what the flip i didn’t even think this was spiderman at first this looks so good
Can you explain how Kraven turn New York in to a war hunt mixed with Far Cry together with metal gear war zone
RENEKTON
I'm gona suprised if this game will not come to ps4, no next gen in this game, sorry but i dont see it 💔
LETS GOOO BRO WHEN IS IT DROPPING ON PC!?!?
@coryxkenshin The Samarui NEED THIS
This is going to be memorable
Leaving this comment for legacy
This guys sounds exactly like Sasuke! Wonder if they’re the same person.
Yes
Just Take my freaking money
9:47 Godzilla what the why lizard look like a Godzilla
And we've been waiting for this bullshit for 5 years?  Why does the graphics look so terrible?  worse than the first game!  Why is it different from what we saw in 2021?  The symbiont costume looks like a hideous CGI, Spider-Man looks like he's bathed in 💩!  Not a single new web flight animation!  Water and fire looks like in a PS3 game!  This game could easily go to PS4, the next generation is not here at all!  They did this for 5 years and ended up making this garbage?  What have they been doing for 5 years?  Thanks Sony for the new generation, I'm very "excited"
Spider-Man just sounds like older Ben 10
Fall!? But summer just started😢
Looks awesome, I am uessing the real enemy will be venom? I am sure the origin of that suit will be in the game!
Muy bueno
NO WAAAAYYYYY
This game looks so beautiful
They put so much new stuff in this game. What are they going to do for Spider-Man 3? This looks Amazing!
Мне по-настоящему нравится эта часть, особенно если в ней будет мультиплеер, а что, у каждого будут свои способности и это принесёт ещё большей популярности
The amount of detail they put in this game is insane. This will be the most played game of 2023! Can't wait to play it myself!!
I think the game will be split in two parts first will be kraven the hunter and second will be venom Peter will lose his mind due to symbiotic suit and the first part will end with Peter vs miles final fight and miles will have more role in first part trying to cure Peter and in the second part venom will show itself in which Peter will play major role
Kereen, nnton aja merinding
One step closer to that Spiderman MMO/Multiplayer where I can swing around NYC with some friends.
Man, at the firt look at trailer suit look weird but after every time i watch this trailer it becomes bettter and better, i dont think i like it, i love it!!!!!!
WHOOOAAAAAA 😱😱😱😱😱
I feel de javu when I see two spiderman at the same time, like something bad will happen between them. I hope that won't happen in the storyline of the game
I know everyone is excited for this game so am I but I'm even more Excited for Imsoniac's Wolverine!!! Spider-Man was  games Sony Paid for them to Make Wolverine will be a Game Imsoniac Wanted To Make so I pumped for the Potential and Scope of Wolverine PS5 Game
As a hater of the original game, even I have to admit this looks lit. Hope it's great. I should give Miles Morales a shot.
2035 hello future myself this the day I saw this gameplay 26/05/2023
Prototype feels back in 2011
Oh yeah
Xboxers crying😂😂
So, they are both black
12:24 Hadooooouken
2004 : One spider-man 2023 : everyone is spider-man
Graphics not that gud
3:03 He did the Tobey push kick
Where is gameplay? I just see cinemetic in game 😅
I never knew Sasuke was spider man
For the people from 2027 just know that the hype we have now we will never feel something like it
I really hope they switch back to the old Peter Parker of the ps4 version or let YOU choose the Peter Parker you want 😁 like if u agree
3:03 that reminded of the shield block from Web of Shadows. And overall tone of the hunter chasing the lizzard narrative looks like the one from criminally underrated game of the past -  Spider Man 3. It's really nice that the devs are not forgetting the experience of the previous games and can get  inspiration from.
So is black suit spider man sasuke? Or has sasuke just always been black suit spider man?
Is this really the true power of the PS5? It looks like the PS4 version only better a bit
Why is this footage 1080p? And 30fps?
the graphics were not as good as i was expecting but it looks fun
BRO I NEED THIS
I don’t see enough people talking about how on the pad showed to kraven you can see wraith near the centre. Yuri will make a return this game.
You gotta love how evil the symbiote makes Peter sound, man.
We need a skin for black costume from cartoon 90s
I'll be back in 10 years to watch it again in tears.
Who's watching this in 3023?
Spider-Man 3 I actually
Please let me pre order this game now
take my money, just take em 🔥
Cooooooóol
See you in a few years
Its one of the games where the story is just amazing
its all over the screen 😅😅😅😅
i already know bro gonna be on demon time i predict you gonna choose dark path w peter or good w miles and they gonna fight im buying ps5 and pre ordering rn
Awesome Game ...Cant wait to Stream that game.😍
Am I crazy or did I like here a little bit of Sasuke in Peter’s voice when he fought in the beginning? Is it the same voice actor? Can some confirm it!
We are...
11:32 lmao
If Venom joins with Miles, they can say the N Word²
Bro the wings hit on miles…. Bro I’m buying a PS5
Xbox deff took the L
There better be a callback to Spider-Man 3 with this Venom arch. Can't wait!
it looks like prototype
Инсомниак молодцы делают ноыую игру а не пол сотни длс на старые
miles vs peter?
Can’t wait to watch somebody play this on YouTube because I’m too broke for a ps5
Imagine having ict study after this
If im not mistaken, it looks like the symbiote webs come out on top of his hands just like in the 90s spiderman! if so that's some craaaazy detail!
"Time to go boom, boys" omg
W
Hype❤
Me waiting for remastered on pc
Confirmed goty. No game can beat this masterpiece. Still waiting for wolverine
*XBOX USERS:* STILL WAITING FOR EXCLUSIVE GAMES 🌝
Looks like more the same, couldn't get through the first one. Too repetitive
Di Korea ada resto/kedai yg g boleh kek gini, pesenanny diitung per kepala, mau g mau kudu pesen, klo g pesen g boleh duduk
The first game was fantastic, and this looks even better. Can't wait. Probably one of my most anticipated games in a long time.
Best 12 minutes of watching a video in my life
i hope this is comming to PC soon as well i rather not be waiting 10 to 20 year before it ported over.
Ok can the Miles Morales game now be cheaper on the playstation store?
Love Black Suit, hate Miles. It's not his story. He was annoying on the first one, I wouldn't want him to be annoying on the second either.
God I hope we have the option to take a darker path and embrace the symbiote as Peter.
Кинцо за 70$
Eta ki bart 2
11:33 Miles is like what
Bro spiderman can fly now? WTFFFF
This might be the best spider man game ever
gah damnit now I gotta finish both games im just lollygagging in Spiderman looolll
Ohh yea , I need this my life
Miles gonna have to press Peter, bro already trippin in the trailer
Cinematic action packed game. Thumbs up.
"He's got big teeth" "So do I" Foreshadowing is a narrative device...
Can already tell there'll be a moment in the game where Miles will go against Peter. Storytelling looks absolutely epic.
they gonna coyp paste the map for the 3rd time TwT
Rockstar is on a whole another level my god
Hold up I'm getting a call My childhood? I've been expecting you!
Insomniac really out here creating the games of our dreams.  And this is just Spider-Man! 🕷️🕸️ I can't wait to see what they do with Wolverine.  Absolutely hyped for this game Insomniac! Thank you for giving us these masterpieces!
Yo🔥🔥🔥🔥
Too bad it’s only on ps5
Is that Venom powers or skills from Prototype 😆
Where’s big ned?
This game looks mind blowing but the UI for the Miles segment looks awful in my opinion, very glad it seemed to fade out after combat
Things we learned: - Kraven does not have the internet (but his minions do) - enemies will always attack you one at a time, patiently waiting for their turn - tightrope walking 4 meters above your enemies' heads will not alert them, nor will metal drones crashing to the ground, or their mates disappearing from their line of sight - quicktime events sequences are still a thing in 2023
The back suit spiderman is quite aggressive as shown in movie
GG New Spider Parker Game🎮 💪💪💪💪
This is not the friendly neighbourhood spiderman i know😢...he is super cool!😎
This is more venom than spiderman
This game looks crazy, it seems like they listened to the fans as well. I can’t wait to play. The symbiote suit and powers looks sick as well
OMG. Finally a worthy piece of art/game!
The amount if edits I've seen I've crazy😂
I literally creamed watching this
fastest 12 minutes of this year
We are definitely gonna have to play as miles and fight Peter being corrupted by venom. My prediction.
I just know they’re water boarding themselves with those wet masks 🤡😂
Looks amazing
Eu tô feliz e com raiva ao mesmo tempo, pois não tenho dinheiro para comprar um PS ou o jogo.
How he get venom power?
Miles morales was fun but let’s be honest we all want to play as Peter
im coming on venom
Let us play the actual Venom instead of this
Those crazy bastards are about to drop another masterpiece
Who decided spider man could fly? 😂
do you have idea who you talking to, he's mine  twd reference 🗿
Interesting how they are going to combat the issue of how weak Peter is going to feel to us after getting used to the symbiote suit powers! And miles looks OPAF 😳
Your friendly neighborhood Spiderman
Dude the way he tosses that civilian 😂 and then miles is like uhhhh👀🤨
can't wait for this gameee
Yuri got that practice doing Sasukes voice,black suit Spiderman sounds properly angry.
This gameplay is sick.
See you all in 10 years, till Marvel's Spider-Man 3 releases XD!!
With the new darker tone of spiderman, Yuri Lowenthaal sounds like he's channelling Sasuke Uchiha 😂
3:58 superman? 0o
Cant wait for the greatest super hero game ever!
exciting
Please available in ps4😢
NPC stupid
Como en los comics QUE EPICO!
I hate NY. But in this game I love it. Great job devs <3.
just expansion pack?  What is different ? I expect Meta score about 78
If they make it so you turn into the huge simbiote as an ultimate for when your gauge fills up I’m gonna loose my mind playing as the hulking venom as spider man is dope af
Everything's good, i want just one more thing from this game, that's gore thing, when peter throws mere humans, i want them to show visible injuries
This Would be a Great Game for Ps5 👍🏽💯
I need them to remember a few things about the symbiote and i hope these powers made it in.  1. It can shapeshift and thankfully we saw it in action 2. It can also turn invisible so peter should be able given stealth sections where he can use those powers 3. It can regenerate itself and the body of whoever it is bonded to so peter not only should be so much more tankier in that but his health should regenerate without the players pressing the heal buttoms 4. Enhanced EVERYTHING so if before it took 5 hits to knock out a mob peter should be able to just 1 shot them 5. And last but not least is the webbing is bio-organic so its unlimited unlike in the first game where you had to reload  Also really hope that even after the game ends you can still activate the symbiote.
It will be very cool if claws are added to the symbiotic suit
Looks super shitty for a PS5 game. 😂
uncharted: spiderman edition
This is insane
LIZARD is my second favorite Spider-Man Villain, so I’m FKing SOLD! 🎉
11:54 He sounds like Sasuke..... Or is it just me.
I'm hard
Omg this is so dope I watched this going crazy ❤️❤️
That "Be Stronger TOGETHER" kinda highlights that Miles will repel/remove the symbiote using his bio-electricity.
Feels like the gaming industry is making a comeback.
OMG I cant wait
It reminds me of the Batman games
lizard vs black suited spiderman vs kraven. brings back memories of spiderman 3 the game
See y’all in 5 years
dude they did the symbiote so good
Can't wait to chase Shocker to the ends of the earth.
I reckon it'll end up being Miles Vs Black suit down the line as a boss fight...Venom's appearance will be brief here but heavy in the 3rd game  It seem's very Kraven/associates heavy this game from the immediate outlook  Just an opinion 🤷🏼‍♂️
My man sasuke uchiha is now spider man!
Best Spider-Man game
so is bully maguire in this game?
*loving this
Не игра а пушка🎉
Why does it look like a mobile game, is the ps4 holding the graphics down?
Watch out for his new powers! LOL
need this bro
3:07 - that moved looked so trash lmao   3:10 - I could feel the vibration of those attacks through the screen. That attack reminded me of Arkham games. This is what I want the most, forget those basic little kicks.
I liked that....alot👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
I'm not playing triple A games anymore until they have this standard of quality and implication in integrating the original story
I gotta say Yuri Lowenthal did a great job as the Symbiote Spider-Man. The voice actor of Kraven did great too
I don't think I've ever seen better combat in a game.
THIS is a proper description of a symbiote. I can't wait to see Venom.
Did I just witness a block mechanic? Jesus Christ it only took several years. All the game needs now is a lock on function and better enemy design and the combat may not feel so boring and annoying. To be fair, I always had criticisms of their game. I'm really annoyed how people think Insomniac's Spider-Man is flawless. But I appreciate them actually evolving their game design as I'm seeing many improvements that I wanted from their first 2 games.
02:30 I like how the enemy's respect the 1v1😅😂😂
i love where peter just throws the civilian to the ground without checking if he is ok.  not every hero does that💯
It will be cool to see if miles has to fight Peter
11:37 I wonder if Peter means Him & Miles or Him & The Symbiote by the word "Us"
How dod Peter go in to vemom
Why not showcase it in 4k? 1080 is 2014 stuff
I just wished you could play this with up to one friend together. One as Peter the other as Miles
Interactive movie lol
Is this even comming for Ps4, I dont have a PS5 yet :(
Whoa I gotta buy a p5 was just waiting for this game
Spider Man versus Glue Man in the town of Chillingbourne - who would win the ultimate sticky contest. ❓❓
Its an interactive movie?
LETS GOOOOOO
we can FINALLY play outside Manhattan !... 🥲 I'm so happy guys !
LOVE THE BLACK SUIT SPIDERMAN. AND HE SHOOTS WEBS OUT OF THE TOP OF HIS HANDS LIKE IS SUPPOSED TO BE. TAKE NOTES SPIDERMAN 3.
I can’t wait for this game to come out and with Peter with the dark suit just makes this game more unique.
I want Dantdm  to play this
Everyone is talking about legit everything else except my boy Lizard being monstrous.
I knew Miles was gonna be more powerfull than Peter but goddamn I was not expecting his powers to have grown this much
I love this because it reminds me a lot of the Sam Raimi Spiderman 3 game. Between the black suit, a fully navigable New York, Kraven, the Lizard --- it's practically an HD remake. And that game was incredible.
wtf someone has been inspired a little bit by the game Prototype 😂😂😂
the black suit spiderman way of using symbiote as multiple arms  to fight reminds me of the game "prototype 2"
Is that Peter Parker or Alex Mercer?😂
Cool a new prototype game 😂
Insomniac fixing to drop another masterpiece.
bro i love sony the know what is gaming
4:20 did he just casually kick vultures wings that were hanging from that beam without context or explanation?
I need this game now
Spiderman using thundercrash 4:54 💀
I love Spiderman i buy me that ❤
Kraven The Hunter ...so Happy I Have The Amazing Spider Man 2 For The Xbox360 ....just Recently Bought Spiderman For Ps4 .....Still Don't Have A PS4 Yet ....Thats HilArious.
Omg wow I like how they are slowly making Pete into the dark side it’s so good
I love the fact the suit is actually alive this time instead of just being a different wardrobe
miles look so hard bro
W Miles op
The two Spider-Men working together: "Ally.." "OOP!" Ganke: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-"
Is Miles some sort of Gary Stu character? I haven't played Spider-Man Miles Morales, so I am not all that familiar with his powers. But it really seems like he can do just about anything: fly, become invisible + intangible,  shoot out beams of electricity and use kamehamehas; all on top of his spider powers. I can get behind the idea of a spider bite giving you the ability to wall crawl, combined with strength and speed, but a spider biting you and making you basically Zeus? How the hell does that happen?
wow sasuke in spider-man
This game gives Game Of The Year vibes🔥🔥
I have a theory on when Peter says: "he's the only one that can help" and I'm pretty sure that means his symbiote harry is the only one that can cure it
How did Peter get Black Suit?
26.05.2023 for memory *
Why wouldn't he just use one of the jet ski's? I guess that would take away from the whole swinging thing
Does it have Venom?
why does every single swole "im the main character" side character taste blood to see if its blood
A game reveal that lives up to the hype? Finally.
so still nothing new since the Arkham series
I love beyond anything that this peter even  with the black suit still dropped the chase on curt to save those couple civilians, even if he threw them dissmissively thats true to character
Bro, someone needs to check up on Shocker. That guy's life expectancy is almost non-existent now.
This the single greatest thing ive ever seen.
3:13 move is nice 👌
Looks like prototypes!!
So good
Actually i didn't like the graphics even though that i know it's not the final result and the black suit is so boring it's to classic the didn't bring something new the gameplay it's the same amm the just change some movement and the add new combat and new skills the ability of venom i didn't like it to be honest and i like the idea that one part of the game is in the ocean but the graphics was not good tho .
Yuri Lowenthal finally getting to show off his acting chops with a broody and evil voice. Getting major Sasuke vibes!
Same ahit as previouse, boring and 100 percent child game
Will there be ps4 version
Spider-Man man 2 🖤🖤🖤🖤
4:59 Anyone gonna talk about how insane that finisher is? The VFX, sound design and animations were perfect
Mmm stinky
Thanks a lot for Raven AND Lizard! Excellent villain choices ad awesome design so far.
wait… is that Bradley Cooper as Kraven？
THEY CAN GLIND
Absolutely buying this game
I Hope there is Bully Maguire reference
Pete turning into Bruce 😂
FML, why do I own an Xbox?! This game looks sooooooooo good.
Idk spider man was eh looks cool but looks like the same game and repetitive as for final fantasy that game is the fast and furious in gaming world and they need to stop lol but looks like those 2 might finally be some good exclusives on ps5 unless they’re releasing on ps4 as well cuz the 5 had nun good exclusive wise being all the games are on the 4
I smiled from ear to ear when I saw the web wings. I’m really digging their iteration of the symbiote. The texture looks and feels alien
Now we a bully maguarie scene
Particles dont look like they fit the rest of the visuals but it does look cool
Spider man 2 PS3 edition?
I can't wait for this game to come out. At first I thought it was a concept trailer,  but it was actually the real deal . Seeing Peter in his symbiote suit made me freak out. I'm so pumped for this game .Love the cinematic and villains/characters.🤯🤯🦸‍♂️🕷🕸
Wow this is getting almost as many views as a technoblade video
I only played the first Spider-man game. What do I need to do to understand why Peter is now in a symbiote suit?
I sense final battle - Peter vs MIles
Every time I hear his angry voice all I can think of is Sasuke getting angry 😂
THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME WHOS WITH ME ⬇️
This makes me wonder if we'll see both green and hobgoblin in this or in another game. Ooh, the anticipation!
5:02 that power surge sound effect was so good-, im loving this gameplay!
I am so buying this game
Can't wait!!!
Oh. Oh nah he brutal
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I know Xbox players heated
I thought they said Spider-Man doesn't kill
Really hope they improve the whole "stealth inside of a well lit warehouse where anyone could simply just look up and see spiderman" thing
this is not how peter and the suit work, hes peter parker not venom, the suit was never angry before not until peter rejected it. i see lots of people liking this but its cringe and shows marvel insomniac and sony have no knowledge reverence of respect for the character or its history. its like dan slott made this game, the suit design is also terrible, its not supposed to look like a monster its supposed to look like a cool sleek bodysuit.
This gameplay from a ps4? Why does no other game look like the matrix demo yet?
2:05-2:21 whats the name of the soundtrack?
they should put shocker in the game again. and have the symbiote spidey chase him recreate that masterpiece
This game isn't even out yet and it's already given us one of the best set pieces of all time. Incredible.
Despite how jaw droppingly amazing this trailer is, I love how in 3:42 you can see animated civilians inside the windows of the buildings on the right side and on the farther left side. Just comes to show that this game is gonna be jam packed with detail. Cannot wait for this game to release, it’s gonna be a banger 💥
I can already tell this game will be crap
TAKE MY EFFING MONEY
Please 🙏 in Xbox and PlayStation
yes
I just wanna leave a comment here when I return in a few years
Hi me from the future
I like Spiderman, but this looks like allot of recycled content from the past two. I like the new animations and moves but just watching it, I don't really feel impressed. Crossing fingers.
I hope thay added something like bully Maguire dance
7:55 I think this one move singlehandedly sold the game for me. Everything looks incredible- and the past games did great on diverse mobility- but nothing says good spiderman game like the character using his quick thinking to fling himself forward off a flying jetski.
I love how they remembered to make pete like angry his voice is a lot deeper he says there’s no time even though there is and he went by himself and left miles just like the toby’s spider-man.
These games never cease to amaze the cinematography always gets me
Yeaaa this is gonna be insane😭🔥🔥🔥
venom
😮
Ugh another cash grab
So miles is the 1st electric spiderman?
Funny how everyone loves to crap on Spider-Man 3 yet everyone uses some variation of his symbiote design from that film.
That voice! Did they understand how bad the new face and voice of Peter was and they brought the first one back?
So I guess every Spider-Man game needs the main villain to have some inexplicable militia force from now on. That sucks.
Litterally looks like fortnite lmao
Ah man I can’t fckn wait for this man
I’m praying this on pc
Can't wait for this to be ported to pc so people can mod in Sasuke and Naruto
spiderman with an emo voice aint hitting 💀
Please Put This game ON PC PLEASE!!!!!!
Notice that it was Logan at the end of that map. Could the Wolverine game be set after this one?
I’m just loving the new mechanics  And miles Kamehameha move 😂
Did I watch a movie or game trailer! But it looks too good game.
Would be great if they were less awful and made it available on ps4.
The only problem I have is the shoulder thing going on, it looks like it’s a backpack on him, other than that I’m happy to see he’s using the black webs instead of it being like venom and use the goo web
How hard is it to put a labcoat on a lizard?
When Miles Morales was released, I had a potato PC and couldn't play he game and I thought maybe by the time spiderman 2 was going to be released I'd have had a better PC.  I'm just going to play this one on YouTube again.
Have you ever heard the tragedy of  Miles, the spider sith lord?
I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This looks so awesome!
Omg spiderman just killed that woman!!
Getting
Ah so wraith is now a character?
3:08 anyone else notice the combos are like how they were in Web of Shadows?
He better have some slick dance moves when he's walking downt he street.
How much more you wanna copy from the Arkham games?  Insomniac: yes
My only concern are splashes in the water during some cutsceens, they look very flat and not realistic, oh and the water looks like a jelly
Yes
No waaaaay! This is awesome!
Please Marvel Tony stark and Steve Rogers ko vapas li au
SHOCKER!
Bro tossed a civilian and Miles was flabbergasted 😮
Can't wait to play this game.
This is sick man ❤
this looks incredible... I hope it ports to pc soon after release...
When Miles comes out of the water at 9:55, it just looks a little, off you’d say. The waves as he’s sliding after too don’t look great. Maybe I’m just picky. Still stoked for the game though!
Sasuke voice actor is a w
I ain’t gonna lie, I thought the game was already out for a year
When can we see the new Iron man game? 🎮 ❤️🥹
Looks like Peter is about to experience what’s right and wrong, oh man can’t wait for this. Not sure how he will take it off will it be like how it was in spider man 3? Anyways can’t wait to play it!!
Peter Uchiha 🤌🏻
Hey hey hey, guys, is it just me, or does Peter sound a little bit like Cory Taylor, huh? :D I mean tense singing Cory
Holy crap this looks awesome! Can't wait to play this, love the new Spiderman games.
Miles doing hadouken😂
this kinda remind me of prototype 2
i just hope they turn his electricity back to gold... it should be gold... not blue
I think it's safe to say that Yuri Lowenthal's symbiote voice is PERFECT. The reason I like it not just because his Sasuke voice fits, but also because he basically mixed Christopher Daniel Barnes and Josh Keaton's take, and made it his own. What do I mean? Well...  - When speaking angrily, it's aggressive like CDB's take, and it's not overreacting, no, Peter sounds legitimately angry here. - When not being aggressive, Yuri's tone sounds much colder like Josh Keaton's take in SSM.
Love the subtle old villain teases maybe we can fight some of them again
Hope we get to see Black Cat in this one!
When you can hear the symbiote in Yuri's voice. Getting the edgy Sasuke vibe, love it!
No PC no consoles can't play this Epic s
This sucks, its toooooo fancy
kraven you'll never believe this.....theres a city called NEw York
So freaking awesome
It's looks amazing. Can't wait for pc version 😂😂
"He got away from US." Miles...Bro. Hes not talking about you.
Giving Spiderman his edgy 90s symbiote voice is just pure genius
You know guys, my favorite song from Twenty One Pilots is.....          The Hype
SHOCKER GET OVER HERE
wow great game... even just watch is entertaining...
Download
Is this game out yeti?
a bunch of people started joking something like this: watch this is a remake of the game based on the 3rd film from Sam Raimi, there is a lizard, and a craven, and a venom
It’s nice to finally see Venom back in a spider man game with Peter back with the suit symboite
The last Spider-Man game I played was “Spider-Man Friend or Foe” | Wii Version. Now seeing how far Spider-Man games have come is crazy.
The things we will tell our kids about this game 🔥🔥🔥
Please don't be delayed please please please 🤞
the graphics didn't get upgraded much 😔😔
This looks badass ngl
When graphics in games will start to really photorealistic. Games tooday, no matter which one looks like cartoons. If you say i'm wrong, look out through the window and say they are the same. If you still say i'm wrong, you are a gamer living in a gamer world.
I love how when it says "Press Square to switch to Miles" you instantly feel the exaggerated swagger of a black teen pulsing through your screen.
All I hear is Sasuke and I love it…!
Miles can hadoken now
This is racism. Please don't break my heart of Spider-Man. Spider-Man only has one color and that is red. Please don't change color of Spiderman.Children will cry.
I have a question. Since Peter still has the Spider-Man mantle in the game, what does Miles call himself? Spider-Boy or something?
As I thought Play Station only 😭
If he loses control bz of the venom, we would see a great 1v1 fight with miles
Did they chamge his face back to how it used to be or is it still the new tom holland face
My gtx 1080 bouta be sweating 😭
Why no anvacded suit
Looks awesome, the flying looks way better. Each swing is further and gliding with the wing suit is much faster.
is it just me or does Kraven look kinda like Bradley Cooper
Can’t wait for pc release
Wow I’m so wanting this ❤❤❤
Last boss fight will be against Spider-Man as Miles.
I need a release date now
3:45 SPIDERMAN 3 OG VIBES + THE BLACK SUIT?????? NOSTALGIC!!!
token black spider-man. still a dumb idea.
This looks absolutely amazing!! Insomniac really knows how to makes things fresh ! That gliding looks awesome
3:45 "We don't have much time.. Move!!"
this sidekick character is such a cliche
This game looks so good! I’m loving how they are handling the symbiote in this game, can’t wait for it to release!
Reason why Peter's angry voice in the symbiote suit seems so familiar... He's Sasuke Uchiha's english voice actor, and Sasuke always has that angry voice.
Am i alone feeling it like prototype 3!
I like how miles couldn't sense peter since in the comics spider-sense is ineffective against symbiotes
why he tasting blood like that , what if it was HIV 💀💀
11:53 His eyes
Would love a prototype  game with these great graphics
This looks amazing, I can't wait to get my hands on this 🔥
does it come out on ps4?
Me watching this without a ps5:
Remember web of shadows!
He destroyed that chick 😂🙏🏽
I miss the black suit Spiderman arc so goddamn much. It was my favourite when I was a child and was so sad that it never showed up recently. Shows and games would skip straight to venom or give the black suit so little screen time it wouldn't matter.  I'm hyped for this game
I hope this is an early build
Now we have a second chance to see Parker tearing off Symbiotic.
this look raw as hell
For a moment, I thought I was listening to Christopher. Huge wave of nostalgia listening to Yuri's Peter influenced by the symbiote. And it can never be overstated how much the '90s cartoons (and then live-action Blade) influenced Marvel Comics in media across all mediums.
Hoping they adapt parts of the "Kravens last hunt" comic storyline, tying in the black suit and adding a deeper reason for his hunt.
The bad guy still didnt look up ...
Definitely not winning out on game of the year over Zelda tears of the kingdom.
I've never seen a Spiderman tightrope walk before
Loving Miles's new UI. So expressive!
Arkham Spidermen
Gona bet that Pete is the 2nd to last boos if the game the last boss mite be venom
Someone said this in 2007, so I'll say it now,   "This is somethin' else."
10/10
I am so freakin excited for this one. Dark Peter with sweet miles is going to be awesome
How in a AAA game in 2023 do the bodies of those character models look that bloated and rubbery? And since when is Kraven capable of lifting a man larger than himself with one hand? And Spidey knows the symbiote is what it is?
It took him 5 years but Peter finally obtained some exaggerated swagger of his own with that suit.
Even his voice become much more aggresive like venom
I can't wait to play as Bully Maguire 🤗
We're not gonna fight a Lizard We're gonna fight a Kaiju
Its no difference than ps4 version
11:50 "Let The Hunt, Begin." -Megatron Transformers Prime Beast Hunters.
I thought prowler was Deadpool and almost had a stroke
Will this ever make it to pc?
At 3:40 the super slingshot is briliant.❤
I want a new venom game but this comes close
Hey please make a game like this for mobile
The SPEED of the new platforming mechanics is insane. Also the jet ski takedowns are aick
If it's gonna be Peter vs Miles, that big guy, lizard, and other villains.... then I'm in
NO SPIDERMAN
another game I'm excited for in 2023, nice
I really love how the gameplay seems like a natural progression from the original game. Letting you make your own pathways for stealth segments and taking out multiple opponents at once, the gliding for increased movement, being able to react to certain enemies tackling you....  Yeah, this is gonna be good.  EDIT: Also they absolutely were faking us out at the start with what could have been a new take on Kraven, before having the real deal with a faithful design step up to center stage.
the gameplay is influenced by the batman arkham series
YESS CANT WAIT TO PLAY THIS
wow thats something new
I’m definitely gonna need a bigger tv
black spiderman fights legit giving me Web of shadows vibes
this sh makes me wanna buy a ps5
It looks amazing I hope we get spider Gwen teased in the game though
1:28 Deadpool?
Just beautiful 😅this release when
Hope it is an unoptimized live service bullshit with subscription and paid dlc, that's what we like!
No major changes to the gameplay but still a nice improvement
Did I see Deadpool?
You hear Peter Parker , I hear Sasuke Uchiha lol
Why do i hear sasuke eng dub voice
SASUKE
Looks like latest version of *PROTOTYPE 2*
ayyy women npc to beat up that feels like its new, right ?
Disney: Hey. So we have  suggestions and ideas. So what if there was a strong woman who can-   Insomniac: *Keep 'em. We Got **_This._** You had your chance last game.* 😑
I LOVE ITTTT I KANT WAIT 😭
I'm surprised nobody is talking about the web slingshot being introduced. It's such an iconic move thats always missing from spiderman games.
Man Kraven's appearance was impressive, not since Last Hunt have I been  hyped for this villain, looks like they are going to do him justice.
8:27-8:35 🤣
hitman 2+spiderman morales
Finally, I think we are going to get Web of Shadows Remake
I need this expeditiously
Yooo venom
Its interesting how the symbiote seems to enjoy the hunt just like Kraven.... Also love the dominating, aggresive peter we see here. This is gonna be awesome.
considering how much they were willing to show for the trailer theres gonna be SO much in the game.
Notice how Peter doesn’t really give miles any guidance in this battle the suit is taking over. He didn’t even wanna alley oop miles 😭🤦🏽‍♂️man said “fine”
7:41 cool little dialogue here, we know that now Peter knows abt harry and that he was never on vacation as he claimed he was in the first game so excited for this
W  channel
Borrrrring
So this looks to finally sell me on a next gen console. Been Xbox forever...sony take my money
spiderman is my dad
This... Is... AMAZING!! Love the full on detail, action sequence and real-time movement! Very excited to see where this story chapter is leaning towards! 👊😎✨
wtf this game will be amazing 😍😍😍
in game mile's power is called venom so what will they call this now lmao
I think the lighting blowing away venom at the end is foreshadowing a fight between miles and Peter
it's not game man its real people
Is it out?
Pathetic. You are nothing. You Do nothing. You mean nothing. You stand for nothing. Me?I run a city… and when the law catch up to you…you will die like nothing. Angelo Bronte is Kraven the Hunter as a red dead and marvel fan I can’t wait to see his so work!
If this game doesn’t get game of the year, there’s going to be some problems. The first Spider-Man game got robbed because of God of War.
Over all this is really exciting and amazing to see some gameplay reveals and the details music, design, setting acting, it’s all amazing. Especially how they did The Venom symbiote for this one. The way Peters personality changes and you can even hear his voice change into this dark raspy tone, and how even the symbiote at one point says “he’s mine” while closing in on peters eyes. The way Peter saves the civilians from safety but rather than check on them and make sure they are truly safe and sound, he just casually throws them aside, it’s a chilling but amazing detail that fits the symbiote haven taken over, completely changing his personality. And then the score on this definitely sounds similar to the 2018 one, but way more darker, while the 2018’s score with SpiderMan was more heroic and hopeful. Major Web Of Shadows vibes and that’s definitely a good thing
Bro so many new additions and the smooth gameplay ❤❤
11:55 it would of been better if he said so do we (but I’m not complaining) and I think the game will come out October 17
This is crazy gameplay my mind is blown away I'm hoping that there are other characters as well like a spider-verse that would be so cool
i fw it so far it’s just a lil nitpick of mine to think that whenever venom or symbiote suit spidey swings, they leave bits of themselves all over the city😭 i wish peters tendrils retracted when he let go instead of releasing from his hand
Its coming at Late 2023
لَا إلَه إلّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءِ قَدِيرِ
Only complaint i personally have n just something i forsee happening is miles doesn't have enough unique power to match up with the black suit as far as it looks. Things like the wingsuit should be miles exclusive to add more depth, etc to him so we as players aren't bored and one way wanting to just play as Peter.
For 90's kids that grew up on Spider-Man TAS and Spectacular Spider-Man, I think I can speak for everyone when i say this is what we always wanted. So glad Insomniac is keeping Kraven a hunter. His whole deal is he's running out of challenging animals to go after, so Spider-Man is the perfect prey to test his mettle.
The venom suit might end up peter fighting miles at the end ..
I am so happy to hear that Lizard will be in the game, now I know this is not happening, but imagine if Venom decides to bond with Lizard simply to reak havok💀
this vs totk
Insomniac, once again -- fantastic work... I can't believe how you were able to deliver the exact right experience of a black spiderman (not too evil, not too good)... Your whole team deserves a raise, considering how quickly you release new games..
CTMMMM
Peter coming out from a house in Queens with the symbiote and the orange leafs, omg, those colors, that animation. I see the visual direction is muuuch much better.
all graphics and "cool stuff" fully scripted, like most soulless aaa games, too a perfect game for plebs
Why I have the feeling miles and Parker gonna have a fight cause of spider-venom
At first I thought I might be watching in lower resolution but it’s 2002 graphics! Why?? Spider-Man 1 had much better graphics.
“hes gonna wish he never came to new york”
I hope it’s a really long story mode
Cool but why is he in a niggle suit that should be auctioned off
I love how symbiotic spidey is just spider man showing his true emotions. It’s like the symbiote just makes it so that Peter resists his true power less.
I hate how ganke is probs gonna be evil 😞
Imo its only right if when peter and miles fight you can switch between both characters through out the fight to feel both points of view. The ending could ultimately be the same or even better theres an alternate ending/path in the game depending on who wins
i dont think the flying spider-man makes any sense but atleast it looks cool. as does the rest of the video. I have never seen the symbiote fighting that way before, its awesome. peter's behavior combined with the costume design gave me chills..
c'mon ps4 can still handle this
What’s the blue lighting on miles mean? I mean I dig it, just confused as it was yellow right?
Kinda makes me want a Prototype remake.
if we get a bully maguire reference in the game then it will be a blast
Bye see u guys in next 10 years
11:31 the way he throws the civilian is a detail my man of aggressiveness the symbiote is giving
Game of the year
Sasuke is that you??
Game looks insane wow. If I’m not wrong, from the trailer it kinda seems like miles is the lead character of this game, or the story is kinda more focused on him and his relation ship with Peter and trying to help him overcome the black suit, rather than Peter dealing with the black suit and Myles morales as a mentee at the same time and him overcoming that with the help of Myles. I’m ok with that I just hope the both of them are equally loved with suits and solo missions as well as combo missions
I wanted a modern Spider-Man game with the venom suit for so long I can’t wait to play
PS3?
This looks like the opening scene. Can't wait to play this game.
Why marvel is advertising even though it doesn't own the rights
Man they have outdone themselves 😮 cant wait for this
the ps5 released almost 3 years ago
Cant wait to see discount Louis Lane again.
I know I had some sort of issue with Spider-Man miles morales but the little details in this game definetly make up for it I don’t even remember what my issues were  DID MILES DO A DUCKING KAMEHAMEHA!?
Lets see them turn Parker into the villan in this one and replace him with miles, im sure that will be a good move. Im also sure he will get his but kicked by women who have no right to beat him again, like silver sable. Also cant wait to see discount Louis Lane again.
WOW
This looks sick. Definitly some Web of Shadows memories but with some Spiderman PS4 flaire. The action is exciting and dynamic in this piece. I hope the next time we see more content, there will be a set release date following it.
Graphic looks like it's from stone age😂
This will be game of the year I’m calling it now
kraven, black suit, tentacles, web slingshot, gliding, web zip line, extended map they did everything we asked for
I think peter parkers voice artist is the voice artist of sasuke in naruto
Looks Amazing!
This is insanely well done
11:37 I wonder if thats the symbiote talking about "He got away from us" or if Peter is referring to himself and Miles
I like the first game this new one looks a lot better. Looks darker and edgy. Kinda reminds me of Prototype with the black things striking people.
best gameplay trailer imo
This was cool gameplay and everything but my God I hate Miles’ voice. They should’ve just had the guy from the movies do it.
Lizzard in this game to yes if green goblin is to yes
The new abilities are gonna make this game so much more enjoyable, this is peak Spider-Man video games😂
Iike how Kraven the Hunter,going after all of them every villain and hero in  New York
E
Hi me in too years
Spiderman 2 venom dlc Boss its carnage
Sauske and miles are a great combo
I thought venom would be a villain.  I really hope you have to defeat him to get the abilities of venom.
miles my goat
Is it a pc game or android or ios please tell me ??❤❤❤
Kraven...GET READY FOR A WORLD OF PAIN
Hurry take my money
im so flippen hyped
I sense some Miles vs Peter boss fight energy
Traversal almost killed me it’s too beautiful
i just saw task master omfg
"Gameplay"   > 1 action set piece.  > 1 stealth tutorial  Actual trash.
imma say it for the 2132843043th time imagine not having a ps5
Nice
Man, would’ve been nice to see Symbiote Peter with Aunt may, RIP. In another game timeline🫡
just 1 little theory that i have, i think the symbiote will fully take control of Peter at some point and Miles will have to fight Peter and try to get the symbiote off of him, at 12:11 the symbiote goes onto Spiderman's symbol but then it is zapped off by electricity, same goes for the part at Be Greater Together
Aaaah one more master piece... It looks so amazing... 😊
Omg!!!!!!!! Is all I have to say 😂
The symbiote suit looks just like Spawn a little bit
Black suit Spiderman, Peter this is incredible, I'm waiting for the evil dance
YO SYMBIOTE!?
GET BACK HERE SHOCKER.
Final "villain" might be pete
I love that they didn't only show cinematics but gameplay for both Peter and Miles. Was hoping it was local co op, but pretty hyped to see it's symbiote Peter and Miles.
The REAL QUESTION is which Peter Parker face model are we getting?!!!!!!!!!
the black suit is cool, like slenderman
Seeing Peter Ganke interactions would be fun.
I'm not waiting this long I need it now!!!!!!!
Come back here, Shocker! SHOCKERRRRRRRR!
SASUKE VOICE ACTOR?????
They've ruined spider man. I don't even know what the fck is going on?
YESS FINALLY VENOM
Hope there are gonna be dlc’s to this game
We wanted the black suit, and they certainly delivered.
Deadpool❤❤
This game is boutta hit harder than the marathon Peter runs on that man’s face
So marvel going to make peter vilian in future? 😑I like him .
Yuri’s performance as Peter in this game really giving me heavy Sasuke vibes. Still got it even after all these years. Looking forward to hearing more of him!
I like how Miles use Ganke’s drone to swing but see how insensitive the black suit Peter just casually destroying it.
Lizard looks so cool!
What about the boat people are they in this game
Calm down sasuuke uchiwa
This shhhhhh go hard I’m in love already
This looks so sick omgggg
Huele a cine 🚬
I feel like Miles morales's lightning should be orange not blue
Wonder how the blacksuit's gonna effect his relationship with the Black Cat
Spoiler Alert~!                                                              Venom Kills Mile's Mom in the Comics X_X
Imagine doing the speed glitch and getting launched across the map at mach 1 then pulling out the glider, you'd fly so fast. Also love that the map is twice as big now
That was forking AWESOMENESS                🤘😝🤘
Peter Uchiha
Wow it's crazy how amazing this franchise can be when not milked by activision 😅
Does Kraven usually have an army? I thought he enjoyed hunting. How’s it hunting when you got troops scouring the city for you?
Petey got that "I'll follow you to the end of the earth shocker!!!" vibes (Sider-man the animated series for any wondering)
Black cat needs a comeback ! Spider cat Stans rise up !!
Lol Pete saved that civilian then just tosses him aside like "get the hell of me"
Miles is so much more fun to play than Peter...but with the symbiote suit now, let's see...
See you in 10 years when someone waants to relieve menory of this game
11:53 sounds exactly like teen Sasuke English dub
I can't wait
but why did they change the color of Miles electricity?
You know you’re running out of ideas when you keep returning to the “venom” phase 😂
11:32 I love how Miles react to how aggressive the symbiote makes Peter he just kinds goes with it rn but you can tell he knows somethings off
HYPPPPE :D ♥️♥️♥️
Fastest 12 min of my life
the little detail of Pete saving the guy and then just throwing him down is exactly how he would be in the black suit, insomniac never fails
are we boutta have to do quick time events to resist the symbiote
"He's got big teeth"  "So do I"  aaaand we all know what that means :]
get it sasuke
I'm gonna have so much fun with the symbiote
Just take my money now Sony
I have a feeling there will be a bull Maguire reference
This is a pretty wild sequence.
I legit cannot wait to play as my favorite eminem song
They got Spider man Sounding Like Sasuke
they should make it so that when the symbiote suit is on, your animations in general become slightly more violent. like the dodge be a bit faster and savage looking
Just so everyone is aware. This gameplay is from new game plus. A lot of the cool abilities they showed off will be upgrades you unlock throughout the game.
They are nailing the web of shadows vibe with the symbiote combos 🔥
Big venom vs lizard? I’ll take it
what if they do the spectacular Spiderman thing where the more he gets possessed the more the physical look of the suit changes that would be cool
The man started flying at the end. This game is going to be legend.
Woo this looks awesome
the resemblence this game has to the past spider man games is unreal.... trailer is INSANE!!!
3:03 does anyone else think he kinda sounds like MatPat here? Lol
Im sorry but why does venom symbiote gets onto peter?
Seems venom is working around the clock
The end card 12:20 makes me hopeful for a choice endings, perhaps one to keep the suit or to get rid of it, if not thatd still be fine but that'd be something I'd wanna see.
Kraven The Hunter looks badass and this game seems to have a significantly darker tone than the first one. Also, loving the symbiote suit, can't wait!
YOOOO THIS LOOKS SO INSANE ALREADY, this game has me hyped up men
I wish I had a PS4 and PS5 so bad. I played like 10% of the first one on my cousins and it was instantly my favorite game ever
Niqqa spiderman is strong
As always, this was amazing! 😍 But it could be even better since we have roughly 3-4 months before release and this is just a demo. Here's my constructive feedback to Insomniac (whether they hear me or not lol 😅):  - The Symbiote suit's anaimations is of course outstanding. As others have said, it does need a bit of work to satisfy everyone.  - Not having the Symbiote suit's webs uniquely shoot out of the front of his hand instead of the wrist (from the 90s cartoon and comics) is a shame.  - Switching to Miles looks like just a simple cut to Miles and not a fluid and amazing transition like GTA V has or even the fake character switching concepts all over YouTube.  - Lizard's new look is a bit odd and weird to me and others, but as long as we get to see the OG look early on with the labcoat from the 1st game, it's fine. At least we know he's growing and shedding skin.
I love that we’re getting a grittier version of Spider-Cop this time
Peter's voice is super badass
I just know j Jonna James is gonna have a heart attack in this game 😂
if pete doesnt dance, im demanding a refund
Best game ever seen
Anyone notice Deadpool in the beginning when Kraven is seeing the map of New York?
If this isn’t game of the year Imma need that symbiote.
Bro this is going to be the best spider man game ever bro like no joke
Im hype. It takes a lot for me to get hype. Lets hope the game doesn't disappoint
3:25 The music here sounds like the main theme from Agents of SHIELD. I miss that show.
I still find it odd how this version of Peter is deep into his Spider-Man career and hasn't fought Green Goblin yet.
Hello
VENOM!!!
This game will be soooo dopeeee
GOD DAM IT SONY!! Twisting my arm on getting a PlayStation.
Looks stupid
This better not be a miles focus game, cause ALL I am seeing is M?iles gameplay and little of Peter gameplay, I swear to god if it is then I am sorry but whats the point of there being two spider-men if you only going play 1 of them. I hope you guys show more gameplay that isn't just focusing on Miles =_- either way the game looks gorgeous and the gameplay looks great.
"He's got big teeth!" "So do I" 🥶
I am really hyped about this game gonna come back in 2 years with a review ❤❤
Well now I have to buy it I’m angry now
Black suit tentacles remind me of [Prototype], that edgy Xbox 360 game.
Why they change the lighting to blue 😔
Kraven is such a badass already
In latin spanish, Spider-Man is voiced by Sasuke's voice actor... Fitting choice!
Dude in the jungle casually takes out an ipad
I like hownthey changed miles lightnight from orange to blue, it looks better that way imo
It’s cool that even as Peter is slowly turning into the villain ur still able to play as him
11:01 "FINE!"
Also on xbox this time
Man I remember how dope Spider Man was on PS1!! Now look...amazing.
Why is there two spider man in the table and Peter and Miles have new suits?
3:09
The Symbiote suit looks awesome. Feels like there is a bit of Agent Venom from the ultimate series based on the shoulder pads and hard pads, but I also love that its gooey it is. Miles's powers are so badass.
I bet everyone is very excited after they see black cat is in the game😂
CANNOT WAIT!
Peter went from ben 10 to sasuke uchiha
anyone selling an 8th in down town queens better say their prayers
NGL If there's the choice to play Miles I'm sticking with Peter as long as I can
Goty
EEP.
I hope they make a harder difficulty
I wish I had a ps5 but I hope it releases to pc after like a month of it being on ps5
Yessssss
I was like symbionte spider mans voice sounded very similar to someone and couldn’t put my finger on it. Looked up who was voice acting Spiderman in this and it was Yuri Lowenthal, the man who voice acted Sasuke Uchiha in the dub. No wonder there’s so much emotion in Spiderman's voice
Pete got the black af 1's on
WOAAAAAAAAAAAAAA CANT WAITTTTTTTTTTTTTT
11:30 Peter and the Symbiote just throws the civilian as if to say you're in my way. Miles is amazed at what he says.  He then speaks to the symbiote and says he got away from us.
I know people talking about the black suit but me kraven is cool and doc Connors is jaw dropping awesome looking
spiderman who dont make jokes is scary
OH YEAH IMA BUY THIS
Slingshot
this miles, & peter fight is gonna make history.
😭😭 its been since what like spider man 3 game since the dark suit eee
Spider man vs miles morales let’s gooo!
looks we getting different boroughs!!!
A breakdown from someone who knows almost nothing about Spider-Man.  A guy finds a tablet. Spider-Man is Venom. Spin is in the game and shoots lightning. Spider Venom and Spin fight a dinosaur.  Got it.
We know Eddie's coming 2nd to 3rd act right?
YEEEES finally more spider man 2
Prototype 2 game skills and combat styles used superb that's why prototype 3 not came
3:03 That was not Pete, the Symbiote spoke clearly.
Is there no wolverine reveal?
Waddup me in 5 years
Does it play in PS4?
im on xbox and i want to get a ps5 to play all the spider man games🙊
This is gonna be game of the year, callin in no question
Okay nobody is talking about this (understandably) but i feel like i'm going crazy, it just might be cause of the heavy symbiote focus of this game, but doesn't the noise miles makes at 10:44 sounds like it's ripped right out of web of shadows?
Symbiote miles morales suit????
I kinda wish peters swinging was more flowy and fluid with the new symbiote like more aggressive swinging or something? Or just new swinging animations for both Miles and Peter in general.
I dont know why but I got a feeling that Miles and Peter are gonna have a 1v1 with each other.
2nd chain of see you all in 10 years cuz the first one hit its reply limit! So to my future self i just gotta ask. Have you stopped playing the Spider-Gwen game? Is there a Spider-Gwen game? Is it amamzing? Only time will tell, see you all in 10 years!
This looks like the infamous/prototype crossover game we never got.
White SpiderMan: Doesn't kill. Black Spiderm-
Reminds me of infamous
The part at 11:32 when he kind of shoved the citizen just hose to show how much venom  made Pete have not as much regard for the people
Even though Peter is aggressive  he still had some humor in him for the ally-oop😂😂😂 11:06
At least insomniac games know how to do Craven right
The fact that who’s eyes changed at the end when he showed aggression was fire. Watch the black suit gonna change from a suit to venom slowly the more he wears it.
Finally some new major spiderman media that has the black suit, it has been too long
bro remastered just came out bruh
My whole life has been leading up to this moment 🤗
So, it WAS the Venom Symbiote. Awesome!
Here at 6,259,699 views.
あはやたはやな
its beautiful 😢
No one gonna mention miles doing kamehameha?
Yeeeeeees!!!
See you in 10 years when someone wants to relive memories of this game
muito foda
Hello PS6 users 7 years from now  👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼😝😝
This game is gonna be so worth the wait
Kraven the hunter huh? Interesting choices Marvel
"You sure? He's got big teeth!" .... "so do I" so f**cking cool
Rais from dying light finally meets match
The amount of cringe writing in this trailer alone is unbearable. Can't image how bad it is in the game itself. No thanks.
KRAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SpiderMan out here looking like John Wick
PREORDERING BABY !!!!!
WOOO !!!!
Wish I had this
Im calling that miles takes the symbiote out if pete because of how there doing there titles at the end, when the symbiote corrupts og spider man it Always gets electrocuted. It is obvious that the symbiote is the main conflict between the two and I can't wait to see how they twist the classic story with miles.
Im so hyped for this
The only issue I have is the power icons at the bottom it’s off putting
Wow!! Top notch ❤
I wonder if peter and miles are paid to do the police job, because if they aren't, they are a fools in my opinion
Hope everyone has their ps5s now also Peter has to be dub sasuke
This is going to be a hood classic
I am so happy the dialogues during gameplay continue even after cutscene starts.
Everything has improved but the graphics of water is average I'm a spiderman fan please marvel improve them
my sibling pulling out that forbidden move when we're fighting 3:10
Batman + prototype 2
How to increase PS5 sale 101.
Ok? Something suspicious and weird is going on? How could krane ever want to hunt down spider man and  the other villains and super villains here in the first place?
I've watched this seven times 😂
We getting Bully Maguire again
Peter and mikes gonna box fs
Hopefully they improved the swinging
YESSIR
Looks absolutely insane
Villa lowkey sounds like Angelo Bronte from rdr2
Can’t wait!
9:15 "time to go boom boi!! 😂😂😂
Spiderman should say something like: GET BACK HERE!! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME, I'LL CHASE YOU TILL THE END OF THE EARTH!!!!
I don't understand why Sam Witwer dies in the start of this? He has to come back right he's a pretty big name person.
Omg it's beautiful ^o^
Wow look at kravin he's even more vicious, plus spidey has the suit, everyone knows that thing is pure evil
Man
No progress.. only different storyline. what needs to be fixed is:  1. the size of the spider's web rope is too large and the shape is odd not like a spider's web (this part should be more refined because this is the main weapon) 2. The swinging mode is less natural, such as having an anti-fall effect  3. The slowmo effect when fighting makes it unnatural  4. and hopefully the sliding effect when running on the wall has been fixed  5. and others.
The reveal trailer had Miles and Peter fighting Venom. I wonder if he somehow attaches himself to the suit after that.
Looks like a ps4 game
What a start and then enter token miles.... And then on top of being forced to play it (they said you wouldn't be) is annoying loser friend tags along and knows peter parker is SPIDER-MAN!?!
All I want to know is do we get to play as eddy/venom in the game???
Common marvel and playstation W
3:03 bro that voiceline is so COOL
just realized pete is sasuke
This should technically be called Marvel’s Spider-Man since Miles is more or less second game
the game looks good and the series just wish it was on both ps4 and ps5 because i own a ps4 and not planning on getting a ps5
this is garbage, spiderman is becoming power rangers with all these new spiderman, cringe insomniac, they write garbage stories
Combat and story both look great! I hope graphics are continued to be developed the city looks almost identical to the ps4 version. I want manhattan to come to life
DEFINITELY A FIGHT BETWEEN VENOM PETER AND MILES (VENOM ELECTRO) HAPPENING! THE ELECTRO SHOCKS TO THE SYMBIOTE 😮😮😮😮
After watching this…. I definitely can not wait until Spider-Man 2 (2023) comes out later this year 😎🙌🏼!
“He’s got big teeth” “So do I” Straight chills, this is going to be amazing
I love how the voice of Peter here is angrier and more raspy.
You just gotta love the more menacing version of Peter’s theme while he’s under control of the symbiote suit. 👌🏻
Ultimate Spider-Man was my favorite spidey game I hope this game is as hype as it looks
The gameplay is amazing, I cannot express how hard this game looks. I am honestly ready for this game. I don't have a PS5 but I will buy the game and use my friends!
Spider-man's voice sounds really really familiar.
Hello Future self, back for a dose of nostalgia?
BROOO THIS MAN KILLIN PEOPLE!!!! YOU CAN HEAR THEIR NECKS SNAP
Everything about this game is looking amazing.  I love the "alley-oop" combo they did on the plane.Ganke screaming made it so much funnier
looks unimpressive
I'm wondering how do you speedrun the game
OMG! i can't wait to download this game
The flying segments make me hope one day Insomniac makes an Iron Man game!
Hm, a game.
Yuris acting for symbiote spider-man is incredible you can tell Peter is slowly losing himself Miles can tell aswell and the combat gives web of shadows vibes i know its a bit early to say this but this has the potential to be the greatest spider-man game ever
IM SCEAMING LIKE A LITTLE GIRL RN WHEN SPIDER-MAN BURST THROUGH LIKE THAT WITH THE BLACK SUIT!!!  5:00 AND THAT KAMEHAMEHA!!
MCU let us down, but Insomniac gonna hold our hand
Getting a ps5 now
I wish I could get a ps5, but I already have a series x and pc.
Can't wait and finally they give us the black suit
Guys!!! If zoom in at the buttom right you can see taskmaster at 1:34
2:58 This voice is.... amazing !!!😮
See ya chump
This game is something else man, wish i could play it
Omg I can't wait!!!!
good god 6.1 million views already, i mean i knew people waned a look at the game but not this much.
I cant wait to play this game just 5 more years 😢  Justice for pc gamers
What if when he said “I can’t believe he got away from us he meant the symbionts and him
Yoooo this game is amazing 😮
As long as they don’t put any woke crap in the game I’ll buy it
Ecstatic that we’ve got it expanded to Queens and Brooklyn now. Hopefully the Bronx, kinda doubt Staten Island.
Fingers crossed people who have PS4s don’t get spoiled by those with PS5s 😭
Release date?
Honestly this game has me so much more hyped after this gameplay man i cant wait
I like how they added the web wings to their equipment. I missed those gliders!
Sasuke got a new job
Idk what pissed Peter off but oh boy who ever or what ever it was better start praying
Is this coop???
Bro I’m buying the ps5 just for this
Please come to Xbox that was so good I want a movie
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:53 That lady got obliterated
Symbiote spiderman is definitely killing people bro
Haven't been this hyped for new release in a while
I love that you can just feel the anger and rage in peters voice
Can’t wait to 100% this game it looks so good
Its not a surprise Miles is concerned for an out of control spiderman, let alone the original one. Give him the venom suit too and you might just kill yourself before he wants to fight you
Im not gonna lie the way miles just kinda butts into the gameplay annoys me. Dont tease me with playing symbiote spidey but have me switching to miles every five secons like the game is about him. Insomniac already made a mikes morales game so idk why theyre trynna shove so much gameplay for him into this.
Someday we'll get really good water simulations.
A bit sad this game probably isn’t co op. Would’ve loved playing Spider-Man with friends.
My little sister is 5 and loves Spiderman, she recently finished the 1st one (With my help obviously lol.) And She’s now on to the game of Miles.  The ONLY thing that caught off her guard like every one of us was Peter’s face change😭😭😂😂. I know I know we’ve moved on, but her reaction was priceless💀. It’s okay though, she still loves him🙌🏽😂💯.
This game is 🔥🔥🔥I can't wait to play it
Why is no one mentioning how badass lizard looks!!!!
And I won't even be able to play it...
hey if ur watching this when the ps6 comes out lemme know if theres a spiderman 3 coming or just say hi!
Btw SYMBIOTE SPIDERMAN LOOKS AWESOME
These games are really a dream come true for me.  Can't wait to play.
I really really hope, they add the fantastic four into this movie, and insomniac runs that series as well. Would be perfect. A well done Doom? Somethjng R rated?
Is this up for pre order yet? I can't wait.
It’s funny how’s he was still holding back
5:52 jump scared 😂
its like Peter has anger issues
Hope the symbiote goes to miles as well
PLEASE PUT BULLY MCGUIRE DANCE IN-GAME!
I love that spidermans voice kinda sounds like the 1990s spiderman cartoon when he had the symbiote suit
Absolutely incredible
I hope this game will be longer cuz I’m tired of the Spider-Man game being short to me
We have a downgrade, now from realistic graphics we have clay graphics, let's go sonyyyyyyyyyy
No “ exaggerated swagger of a black teen” comments?  Disappointing
Omg
THAT was exhilarating!
I'm a bit disappointed they didn't make it coop, but stoked af regardless.
I really hope they sneak the "SHOOOOOCKEEEER ILL CHASE YOUUU TO THE EEEEEND OF THE EAAAARTH"
SHOCKEEEEEEEER! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE MEEEEEEE! I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE END OF THE EEEEEEEARTHHHH
I’m gettin nis shi
why do I feel like there's gonna be a part where you fight peter.
I'm wondering when he's going to yell "Chidori" now
- سُبحان الله.  - الحَمد لله.  - لا إله إلا الله.  - الله أكبر.
Bro this looks like Prototype 3 by Activision but it's spiderman...
GOTY, no questions!
I'm not gonna lie I felt so comfortable watching this it felt like a move
is Peter Parker still white?
Another ps exclusive or do us sad xbox folks get a chance??
🔥🔥🫡
the fact that everyone in the game refers to peter as spider man and miles as miles just supports the claim even more of peter being THE spider man.
Might be Game Of The Year
Is this only gonna be on PlayStation five?
Yeah I’m definitely buying this hoe
so we’re getting a rated r kraven the hunter movie and fall and spider man 2 dang im going to be busy this fall.
I couldnt get through spider man miles morales bc his voice was too annoying
This game is gonna be sick
Anyone else notice the eyes?
Kraven should've been in a live action movie 10 yrs ago!...🤦🏾
Take. My. Money!
Please let this game come to PC sooner rather than later
Still got nothing on zelda
ctrl-C + ctrl-V another spider man game without any changes in gameplay. They sold this games like a FIFA 1993-2023 btw zero changes after 30 years.
He big teeth So do i 🥶
This was fuking awesome!!!
the Venom symbiote being added is such a dub
Cant wait to watch cory play this
muy bueno che
I just hope this game doesn't end with the death of parker.
Can’t wait to play this in 5 years when it’s released on PC😭
great, now i have to buy a ps5
I've had Uncharted and prototype vibe throughout the entire trailer
Miles vs. Venom.. thts all🧙🏾
Wow!
Spider-Man got that DOG in him
I love how Yuri Lowenthal basically brought the Sasuke voice in Spider-Man's venom voice
So uhhh... multi-player when?
jeeze we waited so long for a sequel but in a year watching this is going to be nostalgic
We need an Insomniac Marvel Ultimate Alliance
Maybe im the only one that hears it. But if you listen very closely, the transition sound edit from red to black suit from WOS is here.
So hyped for the appearance of Kraven the Hunter.
This is gonna be awesome
The colour grading of this gameplay is awesome 👌
I’m going to make a bold prediction and say we’re gonna get a spider man vs spider man boss fight in this game
I 100% completed all the games. This will be added to that collection
I swear if we don't get a level with Spiderman finally having enough of jameson and neally kills him till Miles intervines and stops him, it will be a wasted opportunity
Every single frame is wallpaper worthy, this is just mind-blowing.
I js jizzed my pants
Still needs work doesn’t feel like next gen yet for me idk
And the other hidden surprise is probably the green goblin. It can’t be just about venom and lizard and Kraven !
I'm sorry but... it's the same game.
I will be there in ten years
Sasuke is pissed
No way you can go to queens
This game looks amazing
That was just pure cinema! The hole time I was shocked, mouth dropping to the ground! Great work insomniac, keep it up!
Se ve de play 4
well looks like ill start saving for a ps5
😳 *NIPPLE CHILLS* 🥶
Took them six months to get to NYC. Much faster than the downtown cabbies, at least.
boycotting if there's no jazz dance sequence in the streets
WHERE IS THE ARMY IN THIS WHY CIVILIAN IS SO EASY TO SHOOT
Was that Deadpool
MY LORDDDD
man I honestly thought the tattoo guy was Kraven for a bit... then Kraven proves me wrong! hah! also oooh! this will be interesting! Hope you have a great day & Safe Travels!
Sauske !!!!!!!
Can we play it on mobile
sigh....they did too much with the suit...it's undesirable for everyone to try and put their own spin on it when the original concept hasn't even been done right on this generation...web of shadows was perceptibly flawless when it was released....with this gen of tech we need to see their execution of the suit with a better engine behind it. my two cents......all i'm saying is, he looks more like agent venom than black suit spider-man.
Wheres mosquito man
BRROOOO this game looks FIRE. Its like the Prototype (Xbox 360) Sequel we shouldve gotten, but for spiderman. Definitely checking this game out bro.
SPIDERMAN 2 SERA UN GRAN JUEGASO   👌  💥  👏  🕷🕷                     25/05/2023 un jueves por la noche son las 22:24
I like how the symbiote suit doesn’t look like spandex like in the other iterations of the black suit but like a different substance that looks organic which is a very cool design choice
11:47 If you focus on his eyes when he says, " *He's mine.* ", you can tell the Symbiote writhing as if it's excited or anxious. LOVE the detail they're putting in this game!
Lizard is now Killer Croc?!??
This looks awesome
This looks dope as hell although it looks like a better movie than it does a game.
Cringe
Why does Kraven have an army? Is he super rich?
Looks pretty decent. One thing I have to nitpick though is that enemies just stand around waiting to get hit. They look robotic rather than having life to them. I understand it’s a hard to thing to get right though, hardly any games get it right.
Can you make a port for PS4? I loved the first game, and Miles Morales. Would love to not have to wait for a second hand console to be able to play this one.
This is gonna put Starfield to shame
Big w
is that deadpool?
We are definitely fighting peter as miles some point in the game
5:00 Miles just hadoukend that dude
Can someone tell me if this release for Steam as well?
This game looks like everything I was hoping for except co op. I'm gonna have a blast I can already tell
Bro just make prototype 3 already and stop teasing me ;-;
Finally a great reason to get the PS5, well this and FFXVI.
I'm jealouse on all you young people getting the real graphics and good games at a young age, it's crazy that games have evolved this much in a positive way the graphics are just pure eye candy now. I come from a time that camera angles were your biggest enemy and you had stupid discs or worse catridges that you had to blow on. This game is incredible and I might just buy a PS5 for it my god finally the graphics I've always dreamed of
Shut up and take my money
The orange lighting miles had looked better orange
I hope someday the combat style be like the same as in shattered dimensions.
Maybe they will finally realize the console wars are dumb and let this franchise go to PC and Xbox lol
Blue bio electricity? ☹️
I never thought we would get something this cool after playing the game for 6 years🥹
Who’s ready to see what LGBT flags are in this game? Oh and the BLM murals
Bully maguire is BACK
Woke asf
Okay I’m buying a PS5
You can really hear the difference between Peter without the symbiote and with the symbiote. He used to be funny and use "quips" while fighting, but even when Miles asked he got new thread he just ignored it.
oh god the wait for this to come out on pc will hurt ;-;
So Miles has the force and can do the  kamehameha?!! NICE! 5:00
Is that Sasuke Uchiha?????
Man I gotta get a ps5
Yuri rechanning Sasuke for this symbiote performance
SASUKE FROM QUEENS, NEW YORK  🗣🗣🗣🗣
They need to work on the tentacles  for the black suite, they're too bulky.
This game looks like it plays itself.
Why does he sound like Sasuke?
Can’t wait this game comes out 👍
Best game ever
Is that Josh Keaton at 8:27 ?
be cool to have a GTA style game but instead of cars youb have to burgle houses without being detected and the citys NPCs all have weekly routines
1080p in 2023
I stopped watching when Miles did the slingshot jump! Don't want anymore spoilers. Just take my money now!
Fortnite?
This came out the day the flash ended
The alley oop was definitely a reference to no way home when they used the 2 spideys swung off the others web, ridiculous
YES YES YES🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
idk why but when I saw the start of this trailer I really thought it was gooing to be a new turok game with more dinos, but then again I thought the trailer for MG3 was going to be turok as well haha
OMG!!
Looks great 👍🏽
Amazing trailer just 🤌🏾
I love how in the end, you can see the Symbiote combining together with the Spider-Man logo but at the end we see Miles eletricity power which makes the Symbiote go away, probably meaning we will see Miles saving Peter Parker from Venom with his powers.  Edit: Nvm the Symbiote is fire-proof lol.
Bro I swear Spiderman sounds like sasuke uchiha from naruto LOL
We’re def gonna have to use miles’ electricity power to remove venom from Peter
This looks so good
I can’t wait to play this
The game looks great, but could they have possibly picked a less confusing title?
this looks amazing
Bro, it sucks that it's only on PS5
Gonna wait for reviews. Looks exactly the same as the first two games. Not acceptable.
Web of Shadows vibes.
Bruh I can't wait for the gliding and the super jump and switching that would be cool
The fact that they made peters voice more deep and serious to fit venom is perfect, insomniac deserves every award for their hard work
OH MY GOD
Looks cool but omfg the stealth in these games is so boring and fake. Already in the trailer I'm bored AF....
Will it actually be good this time?
Editors on titkok >>🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️
Imagine split screen on this that would be crazy
Looks great, but not buy-a-Playstaton great.
I have Xbox but is should say a congratulations to ps fans for this incredible spider man s game ❤
1:30  Anyone else notice villains we haven’t seen in the past two spider man games
Yep that's a buy for sure.
Finally lizard is a genetic lizard instead of a mech suit
I hope this game is Insomniac's take on kraven's last hunt. That's my all-time favorite storyline with spiderman and kraven!
Did Ganke say Miles name loud enough?
This looks amazing!
Judging by the surprise when Miles seen symbiote Peter, this is his first encounter with the black suit in the game. Also the fact that he wants used to the grim behavior from Peter at the end saying Peter is never like this, that's the first time Miles probably crosses Peter in this fashion in the game. I think as story unfolds Miles is gonna kick symbiote Pete's @$$ and reel original Pete back into character
The dark theme at 11:55 corresponding to the more hopeful version from 2018 is so chilling. It’s fantastic
WHY JUST IN PS5 IM POOR
Wow
See you in 10 years when someone wants to relive memories of this game
нигер
IM ABOUT TO BLOW
Cant wait!! My only gripe rn is the water effects dont look good at all lmao
Visually impressive but this kind of looks like an on the rails quick-time-event fest.
This game is a console seller. Hopefully it’s as good as it looks
Now im just excited to see Agent Venom someday
Water cgi doesn’t look that good 10:25
This was terrible ngl. Sony boys are going through it right now. Stay strong, frens.
Mannnnn I can’t no mo im goin back to playstation
I NEED THIS NOW!
“I’m gonna put some dirt in your eye”
I need it
Wow... just    wow
Man these games are so good!
I hope there is more villain like Mysterio, Hydro-Man, Beetle, Sandman, Vermin, Spider Slayer, Green Goblin, Molten Man, Cyclone, Morbius, and Carnage
yea
Coryxkenshin needs to play this
Playing as Venom Spidey is basically just a really pretty and less graphic version of Prototype
DC take notes, with all that Suicide Squad BS ur pumping out
Wooohooo
release on pc as well on launch day
I thought Kraven wasn’t supposed to have this big militia working for him. Wtf is going on?
Dudee were getting a videogame where we can use the symbiote again!!
spiderman across the spider verse...........
Love the Miles and Peter dynamic duo, we usually see Spider-Man fighting dolo most of the time but it's refreshing to see him with a partner
Looks phenomenal
incredible game ..... imagine what these creators could do if they put the time and effort into creating an open world Flash game. ( W all the newfound technology they have at their disposal, I'm sorry there's no excuse)
OH YES BUT BIG SAD I GOTTA WAIT FOR IT TO COME TO PC :(
SYMBIOTE PETER SOUNDS LIKE MATPAT
Why does happiness taste like tar?
Xbox users 👀👀👀
Goddamn this looks so fun. The symbiote, miles and peter together, super slingshot, just all of it. Guess I'm gonna get me a ps5.
thats its tooooooo fireeeeeeeeeeeee
It's hard to tell which villain will be the boss battle. In the first, it was pretty obvious that Doc Ock was going to be at the finish. In this game, Kraven, the Lizard, or Venom all have astonishing potential of being the final boss. Got me intrigued more than ever!
i hope when peter and miles fight at the end they dont kill peter off
I’ll be the first to say this game will be Amazing 🕷
🤮🤮🤮
Ok this looks amazing please don’t disappoint me
🤮🤮🤮
🤮🤮🤮
🤮🤮🤮
low-key hoping there’s a two player mode. where player 1 is peter, player 2 is miles or something.
So they confirmed that we'll get to play as Symbiote Spiderman, but they still haven't revealed who the Venom is and hopefully they let us find that out on our own. It can be Norman, Harry, Eddie or even Kraven.
Next level of Spider-Man games!
The fact that Xbox is missing out on this IS WILD😭
Spiderman has a Robin now?
Holy 💩 this game looks so good I’m ready!!!
Ayyyyy let's go
Omg 2:20 in and it seems insanely good Dang 🕸🕷
web of shadows vibes 🐐
Game play reminds me of Prototype. Wish they would come out with e new updated one instead of copy and pasting it to Spider-Man. And since when did Kraven have a crew? He always worked alone
Really glad they brought back the symbiont suit but hell didn’t expect it to be like this can’t remember if some other games had samething
Why is the UI jittery? Are they looking for a VR vibe?
nobodies talking about it but i'm so glad they brought back web catapulting!!! one of my favourite web mechanics in tasm and I'm so so glad they're bringing it back, not only that but making use of the wing suit as well the movement and flow of this game is gonna be unmatched
Freaking Amazing! Looks like a blockbuster movie!
Umm...can I just watch an entire cinematic trailer/movie of this game? I don't even need to play it! lol
10/10 but I have to say, Kraven looks like Bradley Cooper
I love this dark side Peter Definitely nice contrast Can’t have two goody two shoe Spider-Man characters  Poor Miles probably is going to see his hero fall smh
Co-op..... why can't I ever get what I want
Naaaah not Pete with the cheesey villainous lines😂 9:15 This game looks hot tho
Take my money
2:26 When my friend gives me the N Pass
A subtle detail i think nobody mentioned yet, at the end when we see the words "Be Greater. together" the symbiote is slowly contaminating the word "Together" but then electricity cleanses the word, clearly implying how Peter is going to become more selfish but ultimately be redeemed by Miles.  I just wonder if in this game there will be the classic (Symbiote corrupts Peter, Peter rejects the symbiote, the symbiote goes to someone else, usually Eddie Brock to become Vemon) OR will it take the "Web of Shadows" approach were potentially Peter GETS TO CONTROL THE SYMBIOTE but using it sparingly instead of constantly.
Yuri Lowenthall delivers the PERFECT amount of hilariously edgy with a TWINGE of intimidation
Miles doing the kamahamaha let’s gooooooo
Like how because of his anger, Peter is more reckless; he's making mistakes he shouldn't and Miles seems more alert.
Miles vs. Peter is going to be the final boss fight lol
Tell me why when Peter said “he got away from us” my first thought was that he was referring to him and the symbiote
I didn’t like that they changed miles bio charge to blue instead of orange I mean it still has some time to be changed
Can't believe it took me this long to realize Peter Parker and Sasuke Uchiha are voiced by the same guy
Here from 2033 !!!
the ui coloring wasn't my favorite, and the venom suit was a lil bit too blocky for me, the symbiote strands for like when he was swinging or attacking were a bit too thick, but this looks amazing dude, it'd be even cooler if they add like different seasons, cause at the beginning of the new york segment it said 6 months later, so if it takes place across a long time, it'd be cool to see like the snowy models from mm, and the regular ones from ps4. the action was great, i hope they add some more water stuff into this game, i mean i know it's not really spider-man's main expertise, but like having kraven patrols on the water and lizard hideouts underneath in old sewer systems, that would be dope, but all the qtes, duo moments, man im excited for this. the one thing i worry, and this isn't native to insomniac or sony, is that the story won't be as good, come the 3rd game, a lot of devs, management, and other ppl start to get burnt out and/or cocky over their work, i know this game has amazing potential, i just hope it isn't like how cod played out for that futuristic era or the bugs and absolute garbage of ubisoft's last few games. im excited to see what they got.
spider-man will be final boss calling it now
Anyone noticed how Peter Parker Spiderman saved that guy but threw him when he landed?  Hilarious he's definitely got the venom symbiote and he's turning him bad.
Peter in miles are looking OP
I have a feeling peter and miles are going to have a fight in this game.
I'm ready I'm ready!!!
Kraven? Venom? Lizard? Likely Harry Osborn too?  Spider-Man 2? More like Spider-Man 3 😂
Sasuke voice for Peter Parker as symbiote Spider-Man is dope
Kreavin❤❤
I kinda don’t like how the symbiote suit looks more like a suit, than a symbiote, if that makes sense? It just looks like a black spider-man suit, rather than the symbiote suit.
Nuts
Pretty soon Peter is gonna start trying to kill his best friend and head to orochimaru
This game looks so fire I can’t wait to play man
Idk know is it just me or are the graphics sorta average? Its not bad but its not great it kinda looks like a downgrade form the remastered and miles morals game.
Really thought it was gunna be co-op but still glad with this tbh
This game's gonna be amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3:10 that side kick on the wall was very much black suit spider-man like
Why peter gotta do jimmy neutron’s dog like that tho
Is it weird that I love kravens theme music
Spiderman 1, the one with Doc Ock, not Green Goblin  Spiderman 2, the one with venom... not Doc Ock.
It looks like the real villian of this game might just be Peter this time..Also his suit is giving me memories of Web of Shadows. I love this.
With great fame, comes greater games
The voice, the intent, the way peter just throws that civilian at the end instead of checking if he's ok. This is how you do a black suit spiderman. Getting web of shadow vibes!
HOPE TO PLAY WITH MY SON ONE DAY AM 18 yers old now 😂
Reminds me spider man 3 the game, because there's the same villians. Ps 2 version was better than ps3/xbox 360 imho.
I can’t wait for this😅😅😅
This has some Prototype vibes! Miss that game.
I love the way the suit’s eyes react to him saying “So do I” at 11:54.
The way Miles swings, some sort of exaggerated swagger, but of what I don't know
Like how peter still has a good heart but he's angrier and a little twisted, excited to see how the symbiote plays out in the story. Maybe he and MJ will break up again just like the first spiderman trilogy
Is it just me, or is any one else getting major prototype inspiration vibes from this game just like how prototype took inspiration from the incredible hulk video game for ps2 and spider man 2 for ps2 😅😂 I know it isn't just me
i cant frickin wait for this game
*Please add a violence option for more realism*
11:32 Notice how Spider-man(Symbiote) throws the guy without that "much care"? Nice detail!
was that the witness theme-destiny 2
The gameplay looks amazing, but the graphics seems a bit off? Is it just me?
O-O Omg....
This game gonna be great!!!
Hope we get a fight with the shocker because reasons
i'm hoping in the terms of voice delivery that they have a smoother transition between exerted fighting lines to normal dialogue post fighting lines like we saw with miles before he went through the garage door it didn't smoothly cut from fighting dialogue to normal hoping they add at least a second where he would catch his breath then talk normally but other than that it looks awesome
Honestly, as long as Peter doesn't die I'll be happy XD  Also being able to continue playing the symbiote suit after finishing the story would be nice XD
Can’t wait to see what Eddie brock looks like praying it’s a Tom hardy
That's a game
3:11 😳
Really want venom to be playable character in this game
Hopefully we get more boss fights in this game
Peter better be the character played most of the game, again...
Definitely gonna be 2023 game of the year
Love how Yuri putthe evil sasuke voice for this game, sounds amazinb
We have GOTY ladys and gentlemans
Graphics looks like a early PS4 game I am disappointed.
Prototype vibes i like it.
Please don’t let Peter have his remastered face!
Please tell me that Shocker is in this game. I want to see Yuri Lowenthal going full on Sasuke-mode and re-create the iconic Shocker scene from the 94 animated series.
This game is going to be amazing.. and it looks like they added queens/brooklyn to the map as well.. i cant wait
This is gonna be one of the greatest in the gaming industry
Symbiote Spider-Man here sounds exactly like Sasuke in Shippuden.  ( P.S i know its the same voice actor but thos definitely hits the evil sasuke voice )
hey 2 years me looking back at this game
Hey 2040
The symbiote suit combat attacks are badass 🔥🔥🔥
Looks 2 good
This is a LOT going on at once. Three different villains and two heroes? I hope it holds together better than Spider-Man 3...
Wow a sequel that they actually add new features and change up gameplay instead of cookie cut and reskin just for money.  Looks really fun and I enjoy how the camera works.
Literally buying a PS5 just for this game
11:51  “He’s got big teeth.” *“So do I.”*  I GOT CHILLS🥶
I NEED THIS GAME
Wow
(Sigh) what a wonderful year to be a Spider-man fan, first Spider-Man across the spiderverse and now this.
Another baby sitter for the masses game. Go here. Do that. Leave no time for you to solve a problem.   A real horizon/God of War.
Prototype meets spiderman
i loved this
Sasuke?
I'm starting to not like spider man from this and that's a good thing 😅 great writing and details
I know it’s not out yet, and you guys are obviously still working on it, but you should make the water graphics better at 10:25
🙌🏾✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨🙌🏾
wow, dude , this game will make me buy a playstation
I  just love how miles has evolved since he got his powers he evolved from a guy who almost died from the rhino   to a guy who can easily neutralize his opponents with pro techniques
This is lookin tight ballz baby boyz!!!
Dios necesito jugarlo y ni tengo play 5 ni 4
Anyone immediately think “…is that Saskue???”
Can’t wait to watch jacksepticeye play this. The first one gave me migraines when I tried to play unfortunately so I won’t bother trying with this one
Miles vs symbiotic spider incoming fight
11:43 Anyone peep how Peter just snatched the tracker from Miles without thanking him😂
What a fantastic decade to be a nerd.
Even peters webs are the symbiote i cant wait for this game to release
Spiderman X Horizon
11:30 peter just tossing a dude on his face lol
THE NEW ERA BEGINS 🥹
Oh my God, im boutta blust.
The glide suits are such a stupid idea.
Game of the year ❤
GOTY right here they might as well plan releases on alternate years 😂
is it just me or is the graphics not that good? i think spider-man ps5 has better graphics
i think peter will be the villain
Look ridiculously good, even me a Nintendo gamer wants to play this!
At long last: the return of Bully Maguire
Turning Dr. Kurt Connors into SCP 682 was an amazing design choice, actually gave me chills
These graphics are amazing
The DETAILS: Peter’s aggressive Dialogue in the symbiote suit and the black goo, the jet-ski animations, and the wakeboarding scene with Miles are all overwhelmingly dope!
Why wouldn’t miles just swing on the bridge at 10:09?
Only thing I see that could’ve had better improvement(or they may show better gameplay of it)is Peter web slinging it’s literally the same animations from 2018 ..but maybe I just didn’t get to see enough of it because we did see the animation of him double flipping ..maybe idk but this game is going to be golden perfect 👌🏾🏆
They made venom attack like Eddie Brock. Love it
Is the Voice actor in this for spiderman the same as the one in the PS4 version of the first game or is it the one for the PS5
lo mas hermoso que e visto
2:18 notice how that guys just sweeping when someone drive threw his fence
The original game had the best ui
Ready for Xbox version
Only time I’ve been hyped for a dual main character game
He sounds like how the 90’s Spider-Man did when he got the black suit
The new splatoon looks great
I'm really stoked that they seemed to take inspiration from 'Spectacular' for their take on the lizard. I've always preferred the primal and animalistic version from that show as opposed to  the cartoony, turn everyone into lizards version that is capable of human speech and thought.
As long as this game isn’t bugged or poorly optimized on release. It’s looking to be a massive W!
Please be on ps4
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
Yoooooo
Oh my god, that was crispy
Id still love it if they bring back the peter they gave us with the first version of the first part.
Why does spidermans suit look like crap! Could have come up with a better looking one!
DID MILES DO A HADOKEN!? AWESOME.
Am I the only one that thinks this looks a bit lackluster? 😳  Map looks virtually the same, hope they found a way to make it feel fresh.  The forced miles inclusion is kinda crappy though. Make it a choice, 2 spidermans maining a game just feels wrong
Let me guess the game is in Manhattan? Lol yall buy the same games every year and get hype no wonder why they keep remaking trash yall keep buying it... sheep
Where can we play games like this one ? I want to become a gamer. Pls help me
Imagine how good it'll look on PC 😍
4:21, Hmm, the goons should really respond to that. That's something the Arkham games did well is that goons would react to and investigate almost any disturbance.
Is this gonna be on ps4?
Omg finally I can’t wait 😮 amazing game the best game 2023
Cant wait for this game its gonna be 🔥
I didn't know there were two Spider-Mans when did this happen?
anyone else notice how similar kraven's kill was to that scene where thanos killed loki
I hope there is suits for venom spider like a anti venom suit would be pretty cool
Peter saying "HE'S GONNA WISH HE NEVER CAME TO NEW YORK" is giving me "SHOCKER, I'LL CHASE YOU TILL THE END OF THE EARTH" vibes 😮.
Oh man... Bully Maguire is back...
sony does it again
Sasuke is that you ??
I love the detail they’ve put when he wears venom perfect example is when he saves a pedestrian from the helicopter crash towards the end of gameplay and just casually toss him on the floor , mind you Peter always gently puts a civilian back to safe ground safely that’s fire 🔥
Kraven is one of my fav spidey villains of all time. I hope the movie does this character Justice like this game will
Looks like the second best spiderman movie thats actually a videogame!
En el minuto 6:09 pense que era Hobglobin porque aparecio una nave
Wow😍I'm just praying they'll make it available on PC soon after release and not make us wait 2+ years again🥲
Me encanto este juego me encanto mas cuando spiderman se convierte en simbionte ,también pense que en  el minuto 6:09  era el amigo de peter ned que seria el nuevo Hobgoblin
3:11 👀 at least this dude won’t have to worry about child support…       ever
Mehh...looks like more of tha same.  Glad I saw this so I know not to waste my money.
jit turned to gta
Bro I’ve been wanting Kraven for the longest time in a more modern setting. So glad to finally be seeing him get some love 😊😊😊
GAME OF THE YEAR. GAME OF THE YEAR. GAME OF THE YEAR. GAME OF THE YEAR. GAME OF THE YEAR. GAME OF THE YEAR. GAME OF THE YEAR. GAME OF THE YEAR. GAME OF THE YEAR.
I can't wait for the new MJ levels.
This is what QuickTime Events were made for. God this looks so good.
When Peter pulled up on miles that was pure nightmare fuel...I love it
This looks like such a perfect third game in the series I love how you can switch from the two too bad I don’t have ps5 those powers all look so fun rip
The whole river segment gave me massive maneater vibes with the aesthetic and design of the dirty water can't wait for this game
Damm
Gliding and slingshot big W
Taskmaster and any villain EXCEPT Black Cat would be fine if this guy hunts
actually insane
Why do I remember seeing the lizard chase scene in a dream 1 year ago???!?!!!
looks good but the graphics mmmmmm   I hope gets better on the launch
I wish Stan could see this @insomniac
What a terrible interface. Hope it's only in BETA
SHII FINNA BE PEAAK!!!🕷
This is going to be one of the greatest games ever this hits me right in the childhood
If Spidey's wearing a black suit, RUN.  When will supervillains learn?
I hope we get to choose who to be if the spider men decide to fight each other and there's 2 different outcomes that would be fire!
Prototype Spider-Man edition
5:00 cannot begin to descirbe how good the camera angles/sound design of this bit is
I want the game I want listen to the soundtracks I want everything of this
So stupid villains do the most TO ONE CITY it’s time for a multi city superhero game been swinging around nyc since 2002
NaruuuTOOOOOOOOOO
But the lizard looks kinda different from the movies
Game is gonna go insane played the first only right we play the second 🔥
“He got away from us.” Which “us” are you referring to, Peter?
Release this masterpiece already I can’t wait till September 🤯🤯🤯🤯
I DONT BELIVE IT! THEY HAVE THE LIZARD!!!!!!
It only sucks they probably decided to take the ultimate origin of venom being a byproduct of Spider-Man's DNA experiment rather than originally being an alien organism.
This trailer reminded me of that awesome chase scene from Uncharted 4 😍😍
Are just ignoring the part at 3:11 where Peter was just destroying that man’s crotch? 😂
The only true hope to be found in life is through knowing Jesus as our saviour.  We can know the peace of having our sins forgiven and hope for the future by becoming a Christian. St. John 6:37 Jesus said “....whoever comes to me I will never drive away.”
Siick
We can really see insomniac did a good job hell a phenomenonal job of handling the symbiote spiderman being cocky and aggressive while still quipping jokes even ignoring the civilians safety thats the symbiote spiderman we all know and love cant wait for J. Jonah Jameson reaction on this
Hope we not only get a Symbiote Web chart but also different Symbiote Suits that would add so much to customization.
Woooooooooh
Easily goty already
So Craven is just the dude from most dangerous game with steroids?
man... WHy you gotta show this part..  UGH
literally so hype. tough to top sinister 6 but lizard, kraven, venom, and green goblin might just do it
Bro this video really just made my day !!!! I'm cheesing hard asf right now
100% bet this is an early game mission and I'm all for it.
Sweet❤
Number one on trending fellas, we did it!
Only on ps5 that’s bs
Peter parker não é mais o principal e coadjuvante
what is this? Spider-Man meets Prototype? lmao
i can hear Sasuke when he says "so do i" 11:54
My reaction: .......................am I hallucinating?...  Ok ok, the one thing that surprised me with two spider man povs and there attacks was CHANGING THE WHOLE CONTROL SET,SEEING PETER AS VENOM AND IT'S COMBO, SKILL LIST BUT BASED ON PS 2× CONTROL BUTTONS, MILES WITH THE FAST SWING AND FLIGHT, ALL THE GAMING SETS, AND FOOTSLIDE???  AIN'T NO WAY I CAN HANDLE THIS yall see it very exclusive, BUT FOR ME, IT'S LIKE PLAYING A SPIDER MAN 3 REMAKE BUT MADE DIFFERENTLY   OMG....I need breathe....hoooo....
This exactly what I'm looking for in this sequel. A lot like Horizon: Forbidden West, it doesn't drastically change mechanics to the game that were already awesome, its just an enhancement. Pete with the symbiote powers, Miles with the new web launch (which I can't wait to take advantage of) and the glider suit....oh this is exactly what I'm looking for.   Looks like the map is expanding which was one of my greater concerns (oh just the same game with a fresh coat of paint like Miles Morales was).
Ok speculation/observation time: (I haven't had time to read newsletters dedicated to the topic so I'm only going off of this video)  This might be taking place at a quarter through the game, considering that the "Web-Pun" wheels have only one side truly complete with character specific attacks and that _(what appears to be)_ a shared Web-pun wheel of gadgets exists between the two of them, which is a great compromise to the other gadget systems we saw in the previous installments. Also there is the fact of gliding, which seems to be decently leveled up as we see Miles and Peter use it during chase scenes.   There was also a question of the symbiote's origins that I hadn't seen much info on, but it looks like it might be made by Doc Connors considering the fact that Kraven's team was surrounding a house, probably Doc Connor's, and this is also (apparently) the first time Peter puts on the suit, considering Miles' reaction to the costume. Also, this version might take from the Ultimate comics in that there are two samples of the symbiote, one being a blank slate that Peter gains, with the other being on Harry. Alternatively, the suit might have failed on Harry and in trying to fix the suit, it bonds itself to Peter while he looks for Doc Connors.  As for switching between Symbiote combat and Regular Spidey combat, I believe that it might be an upgrade later in the game that allows you to switch between the suits, using the animation at 2:26 considering the _brush/Dreams style_ transition stage between the two costumes. Also, there seems to be a sizeable increase in the map considering this pic at 1:33 (Wonder if Fisk might play a part in this???).  Thank you for reading my thoughts on this game trailer, as I AM STOKED to see how the game expands on this universe and what differences can be seen between the two characters' intertwined campaign! Have a good day y'all!
Anyone else hoping there’s a way to keep playing as symbiote spider man even after Venom shows up?  Who knows, maybe Peter can become this universe’s version of Anti-Venom.
Is it on ps4?
Miles suit looks different I think it's the arms
I’m getting Prototype 2 vibes from this.
I bet in the end we will have to fight Peter as Miles.
Why do the comments have to be soo cheesy with a bunch o nerds and their "I love how...." Comments 😂 I love how Spiderman has a suit  and and and Peter is wearing it and Miles is toooo
we need a co-op story mode
GAS ⛽️
I hope it’s gonna be online to😢
This is gonna be good
why do i feel like miles and pete's gonna fight eventually cuz of the symbiote
Wow, the story seems to be borrowing elements of "The Black Suit Saga", "Kraven's Last Hunt", and even "The Lizard" arc. Story looks amazing, and so does the gameplay. Need to start saving money for a PS5 and probably get "Marvel's Spider-Man" and "Spider-Man: Miles Morales" for it as well, so I can get the whole story.
Wow flying through the air. What a fun game.
It still looks like a game that plays itself a bit without much visceral impact in the animations.
8:45 prince of Persia jumping sound
He’s gonna put some dirt in ur eye
Its gonna be the game of the year
Man spiderman is much more violant and aggresive
Sweet
I am praying that the add the PS2/XBOX/GAMECUBE black ultimate spiderman suit.  a childhood favorite game of mine, would be amazing to see it again 18 years later!
Is it just me or does Spider Man sound like Sasuke? 🤔
wow this is a game i have to play to hear Yuri Lowenthal be peter parker, yuri have voice acted sasuke uchiha dub amazing voice actor
TOTK has some competition now.
I can't wait to see how Pete being a jackass affects how the story goes lol
Finally we get 2 black spideys
Any word on when we'll get a PC release?
I’m definitely buying this game
Напомнило анекдот: Заходит теща в бар, а там ей говорят: "Извините грит у нас змей не обслуживают"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My only problem is they chnged the color of Mile's lightning.   It's a petty thing but it's my petty thing
This probably my most anticipated game this year besides Zelda tears of the kingdom which is already out
let me guess only for ps5
ПОЧЕМУ ЭТО ВЫГЛЯДИТ ТАК ПЛОХО??????
right when we switch to miles you can spot two NPCs inside of the building in front of miles
Welp…. Gonna buy by a ps5 just for this 🌚 and the suicide squad game
yee big resolutin .. less graphics  detail .. but ... the spider-venom is amazing :))   on pc it will be amazing ;) soo after few year PC gamers will be happy :)))
I’ve waited for the chance to play as the Venom symbiote this is a day one but for me I need this
I see the Web of Shadows and Shattered Dimensions inspirations in Peters Symbiote Combat. And I love it. Combat wise this game might be able to fully rival WoS.
Imagine the boss fights in the side missions aswell!
Yooo am too exited bro this too much literally too much this game have so many details from the Peter being more angry because of the symbiote to the wingsuit to the swings and take down and new gadgets bro this a game I will pre order don't care how much
HOL-LEEE SHEEIITTT!!!
Awesoooome! I can't wait for it to come to PC 5 years from now 😂
definitely the game that's gonna make  me break down and get a ps5
Que inclusivo 2:56
I hope most of the game will be with Peter Parker as the main character. I hated that mumble rapper token spider.
11:45 i think thats a Red flag 😅
Looks good but hope combat is not repetitive again
Miles went and train under master roshi and learned the turtle hermit way 5:00
Funny thing is that in México the actor voice actor for Peter has also been Sasuke just as Yuri
Is... Is that... Sasuke's voice???
Why does kraven the hunter look like Bradley Cooper?
looking like prototype 3
THE SPIDER-MAN GAMES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BETTER THN THE MOVIES 🗣️🗣️
Yuri Lowenthal is backk at it again u can feel the rage in his voice with symbiote spidey.I hear the inner sasuke in him with this one lmao😂😂
maaan this game has a high vibe of Prototype game, the fight and style...
One of my fave little details you see in SM and SM:MM is their differing swinging styles. PP is more straight and controlled, where MM is more scrappy and seemingly uncontrolled, but he seems to instinctively use each swing to its fullest effect.
I really like this version of Peter Parker and I hoped that he won't die in this game, but at this point it seems unlikely. Anyway, the trailer is absolutely bonkers and I'm more hyped for a game than I ever was in the last decade. Can't wait!
The wing suit thing is cool but I just hope it’s not overdone it would throw me off a little if that makes sense
Insomnia is on another level and I love it!
This looks f****ing amazing!!! Geez! So stoked!
I hope after the story, we are able to use the symbiote suit for fun in the game. That would feel so much better than regular spider-man.
Iv literally only completed spiderman on ps4 last week lol I know it's been out years but iv been busy and have kids etc so only got a chance recently to start gaming again... Anyway to go from spiderman ps4 to THIS!!! this was like watching a movie!! The gameplay looks absolutely amazing! Iv told my wife on multiple occasions im in no rush to get a ps5 because 1 there hard to get lol and two there's no games out on ps5 atm that would make me wana get one!.... Until now that is 😭😂👏🏻 I can't wait now! This game looks next level! And from the looks of it the map is alot bigger too 🔥 🔥 🔥
Drinking a glass of Xbox fan boys tears after this reveal
1:28 Is that Yuuri Watanabe???
Kraven really gonna be kratosing all the heros and villains
I'm glad to see Kraven as a villain.
HYPEHYPEHYPE
It is absolutely marvelous😍 I‘ll spend hours with this game. Just amazing work ❤
Can’t wait for this game to come out we about to see a savage black suit Spider-Man
Who else thought the guy at the beginning was Kraven? I'm glad it wasnxt because Kraven looks greay here, comic accurate and looks fitting for the iteration and badass.  Also i like how they are handling how the Black suit is affecting peter and the suit looks badass. Coolest looking black suit gameplay I've seen since Web of Shadows.   Also gotta note the cinematographer of the quick time events and the clear growth miles has had. Can't wait to play this.
ヤバ過ぎる……
Crap. Another quick time garbage Sony game
Peter Uchiha
I wonder how the symbiote suit is going to change based on which costume you're wearing currently. Peter has the default costume in this trailer, but will there be a symbiote version of all suits?
Sony:You wanted faster web swinging? We got that. Black suit? We got that. Switch between Peter and Miles? Yup, that too. Oh yeah, and web wings just to spice it up a little. Spider-Man fans: Sony:😎 Spider-Man fans:😎
Looks fun to play ngl I use to love playing Spider-Man this looks like they do a lot more than previously games
This game looks very awesome ❤ graphics are amazing we can see black spiderman becoming more aggressive and ruthless and lizard looks like aquatic dinosaur😂
That was awesome
When Sasuke reincarnates into Peter Parker.
Steam on release or gatekeeping on that shitty white box shaped dust collector?
Hopefully we get knullif not in the next one
Spider-Man 2: prototype
2023 and we’re still doing exclusives? Wack
Looks incredible as expected
acho que lançavam o jogo do miranha para ps4           mas isso sou eu a dizer claro
I can't stand that Miles and Peter are slowly being integrated into the same universe full time. It completely takes away from their character arcs.
You guys keep complaining about how bad the graphics are. You guys know this isn’t the final version, right? This is just the first gameplay trailer.
MM>>PP
I wished they had changed their mind for this game to be on ps4. If they do I would be very happy cause I don't wanna get a ps5
Me barely 3 minutes into the trailer…   “WHAT??!!”
I love the foreshadowing effect of Miles saving Peter from the symbiote @12:15. This game is going to be amazing
❤❤❤❤ i loved
I have a feeling peter will be a boss battle
Wow🎉
Ps4 pro with SSD vibes
the black suit could have been done way better. doesn’t look high quality and i don‘t really see big differences to the last game when it comes to the look or design of this one. gotta be honest i expected more. Hope they‘ll make improvements
I hope they release this in a PS5 bundle. I haven’t got one yet, but this would be the perfect opportunity to get one 😲
Bro this game looks insane
Co op...please...i need it to have a co op mode
Wow wow wow
Is it just me or anybody else thinks that the graphics are average??
Idk. I think The Green Goblin would have been a better antagonist for this game. Looks very underwhelming.
Now imagine a carnage mod for the game
The hud could use some work but everything else looks great
I’m so excited
This is the best game in 2023
When peter said ” So do i” in the end , he sounded like sasuke😭😭
Another Ubisoft game 😵‍💫
I love how the Black suit turns Peter into an absolute brute. It makes him almost indestructible
Reboot sinister six
😢😢😢i really wish it was 2 player split screen
The set pieces are amazing even better then both the other games truly crazy i cannot state enough how excited I am
I like how the symbiote suit is slick/shiny but it also has its deformities
i wasnt even gonna get this game, literally no hype for it but now after seeing this IM GETTING IT NOW. Also now im finally gonna get spider man miles morales and play it after all this time, prepare for this game so i know the full story before this and yes i did beat spider man 1 on ps4 back in the day with its dlc. Got that one after seeing Silver Sable number one waifu in spider man 1 imo, hoping i see her again in spider man 2
brooo you can see the electricity coarsing through miles skeleton @4:52
wasn't miles morales spiderman 2? I guess that doesn't count lol
It's not fair it's only for Ps5 😢😢😢
I cant wait ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
too excited
Omg! The fact we can shot webs to walk across, geeking out. Im so ready 😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This looks spectacular
This looks incredible
@Marvel Entertainment me da o jogo por favor e lança pra pc agora
Bro gliding omggggggggggggggg plus the web launch omg omg omg genuinely so cool I’m so excited
I really hope that the graphics and design of the black suit will be improved
Bro Peters voice under the blanket influence is so cool he sounds angry true air force energy
Oh how the mighty have fallen 😴😴😴
Symbiote Spiderman or Prototype 3? Lets go, 3rd game with the same map and i aint even mad
I need to get a PS5
Bro this real lmaoooooo I’m so hype lmaoooo
OMG 😍😍😍
"Where am I now?" One floor down to your left 👍🏾
THIS GAME LOOKS SO FIREEEE
Spiderman getting scary… not really what I expected from the venom suit, at least not from the beginning
PS4 too?
Man!! That was the best Spider-Man short I've ever seen!! So excited for this game! 😅 Between Across the Spider-Verse and this game, its looking to be a GREAT year for the Web Warriors! Peter sounds so angry with the symbiote. 😊 I hope in the end Miles will have to take him down. That would be a cool fight. Can hardly wait for this! 🕷 ❤
HUD looks trash 🚮 hope they fix it
bro I've been left stunned with this gameplay can't wait for the remastered version
That´s the closest we´ll get to Web of Shadows remaster
PLEAAE ADD ON PS4
😴😴😴
PLEASE ADD ON PS4
PLEASE ADD ON PS4
PLEASE ADD ON PS4
I know it's the same voice actor but can definitely hear Sasuke
PLEASE ADD ON PS4
PLEASE ADD ON PS4
Venom suit looks super op but really cool
PLEASE ADD ON PS4
XBox you can have Halo, ill take this!
Wow pressing square button. Such riveting gameplay. I also love cut scenes ever 45 seconds. Really dumbing down immersive storytelling for people who don’t read past a seventh grade level. Thanks insomniac games
I'M ONLY GETTING A PS5 BECAUSE OF THIS GAME... NO OTHER REASON TILL NOW TO HAVE ONE!
Boat exploding graphics looks like ps2 graphics
For anyone wondering, here's a list of everyone on Kraven's screen at 1:26 : - Black Cat - Prowler - Wraith (!!!!) - Tombstone - Spider-Man (both of them) - Lizard - Taskmaster - Shocker - The Raft- shows several villains including Doc Ock and Kingpiin, I couldn't identify them all
Looks interesting
5:02  BROOOOOOO HE DID THE MOVE BROOOOOOO
DISGRAMA EU QUERO QUERO
they are literally selling you the exact same game for a 3rd time
Spiderman will never be without quick time events.
Fall 2023! What the Hell?!  Why can't we buy this TOMORROW?!
"So do i"    BWABUMBUMBUMBABAAAAAA
Peter with the symbiote is devious
hell yyyyeaaahhhhh
I’m getting this game, I’m gonna pre order it so I can get the collectors edition, just like I did for the first game
CAN YOU PLEASE ADD THIS TO THE PS4 ALSO
Kinda hoping that after the main story you can still play with the symbiote suit.
This is already a 10\10 game
BRO JUST LET THE PS4 PEOPLE PLAY IT PLEASE I CANT AFFORD A PS5
He's a spiderman in the X-Box Series S?
Game of the year easily 🙆🏽‍♂️
the voice is not it
Якась дуже жахлива графіка…
cant wait for coryxkenshin to play this
xbox gamers crying rn
Yuri Lowenthal literally turned to Sasuke mode for Spidey in symbiote suit
i wonder how narratively were going to keep the powers of the symbiote suit. i don’t believe they’re going to give the player a whole new set of powers and then just take them away, but i also don’t believe peters gonna keep the suit for the whole game.
This kinda reminds me of Web Of Shadows
Small detail, but see how at 2:34 the black goo completely covers that guy's upper body when he gets stuck to the car. He has no way to breathe, he might suffocate under there. Really shows off the brutality of the symbiote suit
he’s not normally like that no, he’s never like that Peter is going to be great in this one
I just hope this comes to pc soon as well... I don't want to wait too long!
This reminds me of prototype
Spider-Man's new suit is a symbiote from the plant. Called klyntar empowered 😊 by this bring  out the dark side. Out of our favorite web-slinger, the birth of venom is coming !!! 🔥
جميل 😢💐
Love it
Let's Go!!!!
I never noticed at 7:40, Peter is swinging and flying along side with Miles!  Such a great detail!
the physics looks so bad. Why even swing. He is litearlly floating
Welp I gotta get a ps5 now
Already a lot of interesting details that look to be making an awesome story  - Kraven is obviously looking for the greatest challenge possible in coming to NY. Maybe a possibility he teams up with the Spidey team to fight Venom?  - Black Cat, Wraith, Taskmaster and Prowler all confirmed operators in NY. Black Cat and Taskmaster I expected, but Wraith is a welcome surprise. My real concern is Prowler, has he backslid and returned to a life of crime again?  - They’re tracking down Lizard to help find a cure for Harry, which implies Peter has learnt about the true state of his condition. Only way that could have happened is for Peter to have found the lab, Harry to have escaped or Norman to have shown Peter.   - Wonder if we’ll get any lingering villains from Spider-Man 1, maybe Dr Octopus can help?   In any case I think the real question is,   Black Suit Peter vs Miles fight where you play as Miles   Or   Black suit peter vs Miles fight where you play as Peter
Why nobody talks about same swinging animations and outdated visuals, its literally 2018 spider man game
When in fall 2023?  A. September  B. October  C. November  D. None of the above
I wonder if you can switch Peter's combat style. Like between normal and symbiot.
When does it realease
What i love about this universe peter didn't die ,and he's work together as a team with  miles ,such a unique universe i lov it
Reminds me the uncharted 4 action set piece
im being nitpicky but i kinda wished they had the black suit shoot the webs out of the top of his wrists like in the animated series instead of regular "web-shooter" positions. but goddamn does this game look so good, even better the first (which i didn't think was possible).
Just when I thought it couldn’t get better, it got better. Man they done did it again!
The graphics are awfull BUT am sure they will be fine when tha game it comes
Ummmmm so we’re just gonna act as if that wasn’t one of the greatest gameplays??? This game already looks like it could be one of the greatest games we’ve played!! I mean the fights and mechanics are like I’ve never seen
This is that black Air Force energy type activity going on
The villains we gonna face them in the game are Wraith, Tombstone, Taskmaster, Lizard, Kraven and Venom. I hope Yuri watanabe (Wraith) would be voice by Asian American Actress instead of Yuri's wife. Tara Platt is more white although mongolian descent.
Dam…I’m a Xbox owner and…yea it sucks knowing this out there for ps5
nice
I hope you can keep the Symbiote suit when you finish the game
Sheeeeesh
Yea this is gonna b epic!!
If yall look close enough you can see the symbiote move on Peter (No attacks or nothing that involves movement"
can't wait to hear full balck suit theme
So if I buy this I'm forced to play as Miles? No thanks.
Hey I love ❤ the spider man game series and I would love if you you sent me this game early I also have a YouTube channel called ThatReidKid again I love the spider man series and I've waited so long for this game ever since the spider man Miles Morales game again I would love if sent me this game early best of wishes ThatReidKid
It's amazing 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sick! Cant wait!
if you  have it for ps4 you" be cool
Favorite game series is back baby. 😂❤️
Dont like the Armor look in the symbiote suit, but id amazing anyways
Peter being protective of Connors is just so cool! I love seeing all of Peter’s emotional spectrum!
I get bored of those spider mans 😩😩😩
just a reminder that under the symbiote suit there’s the new face model
Is that SASUKE I hear?
Web of shadows prototype fighting, cool
this is prototype!
My body is ready.
11/10 👏👍😃
Crazy 😧
Loving the fact that the suit acts a lot like the one from Web Of Shadows. The eyes, the tendrils, the swinging changes, even the aggressiveness.
I freaking loved this trailer and I really can’t wait until the game is released 😁😁
Too sad this wont be available for ps4 users 😢
6:45 menacing
why two spiderman....
Really looking forward to purchasing this on Steam in about five years.
This game is only for Ps5?
"Time to go boom boys"
would be cool if mile’s spider sense tingles when peter’s around in his symbiote suit
kya game hai bhai
you can not seriously expect me to get excited about kraven the hunter
Me lo regalan?
This game is the reason I’m gonna switch consoles
I like the visuals and detail but I do want to know how Peter has the symbiote
This game looks incredible
Sony can we play spider man too - love xbox
Thats so amazing
is there a game for us that dont want to play as miles khamehamaeing electricity at people and actually play as spiderman?
I think at some point in the game, Miles will fight Peter to get the symbiote away and out of Peter.
Game of the year all ready
This sit seems to be more like an armor
Would have liked them to improve the swinging, looks exactly the same as before.
How are they gonna handle the ability loss when Pete inevitably forcibly removes the symbiote and we have to fight Venom. Im assuming that’s the big bad for the end of the game after this boring story with Connor wraps up. It’ll have to be a new super suit sort of situation, else it’ll feel like we get nerfed in the middle of the game.
They just nail it every time
YO THIS IS FIRE AS HELL IM HYPED
This looks phenomenal, I love Spider-Man games
Yuri rage sounds like Tobey from the three movies though.
When he grabbed all the enemies with those venom hands I creamed
Plz subscribe😊😊😊😊
Final battle, miles vs peter, choose your side
This game would be perfect if there was a Shocker boss fight with Peter
Hyped
SMH . . . . just like the last one this should have been a DLC . This looks like a minor upgrade and def not worthy of an entirly new title and a $70 price tag, The State of gaming is a joke.
I hope the game takes a Kraven's Last Hunt rout and Kraven kills Peter
The Symbiote is gonna be absolutely off the rails, the combat system utilizing it looks phenomenal, and for his own sake I hope Shocker is excluded from the game…
Is it me or does Peter kinda sound like Sasuke from Naruto?
Prototype vibes
The gameplay looks like prototype 2 fr
Love the regular pete's and mile dynamic too goofballs but the symbiotesuit makes more like Batman and Robin which is good too
Love the Black Suit, Love the Anger and Disregard.... But.... IDK I feel like the voice is a little try hard sometimes or alot. I feel like it could be dark without being forced gruff.... Less Batman, more Punisher. Ya Feel... maybe I have those backwards, but you get what I'm sayin right?
they bouta go 2/2 😮‍💨
So, at some point, Miles is going to fight against Peter?
Best game trailer I’ve seen in a while 💫 and it’s all gameplay 🙀
If this was two player the game would dominate I jus don’t see why they couldn’t have that feature as a option.
<3
Is this a remaster of a previous game? Or a whole new thing, cause the name spider man 2 seem like something recycled, Plz answer my question Sony
Last time played it on the ps4pro then you guys released it on the pc. Wanted to play at max gfx and proper 4k and high refresh rate but alas didn’t feel like grinding again. This time will wait patiently for a pc release.
This game game looks very similar to Batman Arkham Knight, especially in combat, even has fast animations in some series of punches.
This is awesome. I’m gonna buy this game when it comes out.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Spiderman 3 bad peter dance animation as an extra?
This game is probably gonna take heavy inspiration from the Kravens last hunt comics and I am beyond hyped
11:30 He just chucks the guy on the ground after saving him lmao.
If it's as long if not longer than the first they're onto a winner
"so do i" 🤓
This looks so good I might have to buy a ps5 for this game
I hope this is on ps4
Getting strong "Prototype" vibes from this...
I hate that they redid his face ffs
Peter is rude but he knows what he has to do I like that detail because cybiote could make someone toxic
I legit forgot I was watching a trailer for a game and not a movie for a moment there
9/10
7:33... Fast & The Furious with boats... I love it.
Miles' lightning powers will never not be f'ing stupid
This is the most impactful downgrade in my lifetime. So sad.
Spider-Man...Venomized!
Should Spiderman fly that far?
it’s not looking good for DC
oh boy... im gonna cheese myself
games looks so good, sadly it exclusive to ps5. would really like this game to be released on pc later down the line.
Been a bit since I played the first game.  They change the voice actor on Miles?
The teaser trailer was a misguide! Harry Osborne isn’t Venom! Neither is Eddie Brock! Peter Parker will be the final boss as Venom! Remember in the teaser that it shows both Peter & Miles looking into a dark alley and then it fades to black. Then shows Venom’s face BUT editing is a thing. In this gameplay reveal, Miles says “He has big teeth!” Peter replies “So do I….” with Miles & Genki discussing his behavior being odd. Let’s remember that in the Ultimate comics that Peter became carnage at one point SO becoming Venom wouldn’t be far fetched. Venom (Peter Parker)VS Miles (Spider-Man) for the final boss fight!
Pro Tip: Now watch it again with headphones and just listen, truly listen to the sounds. It's, for the lack of a better word, Amazing.
I hope we get a good number of fights between Peter and Miles.
this is beautiful, in insomniac we trust
biggest game of 2023 .period
🔥 🔥 🔥
Anyone else see when kraven has that map it says wraith as one of the characters. Wraith as in yuri.
Cant wait to buy the game
whoa! looks like the last two games! super innovative!
KRAVEN
I don’t see a lot of people talking about how we might’ve just gotten a confirmation for a bigger map since I saw a target where you could not go in the last too games.  Now, I just wonder if we are getting Gwen. I am pre-ordering this game the moment it’s available! So hyped!
The way Peter threw that civilian after he saving him. And the way Miles looked at him surprised.
Cool symbiote strength. Awesome new Miles' suit.
Nice new mobile game
I can’t tell you how many times I smiled through this video. Def copping when it comes out!
Amazing, just amazing.
Cool intro for Spidey!   Henchman: ‘Cover the door! The beast could be anywhere!’   Spidey transforms   Symbiote Spider-Man: ‘You have no idea…’   Literally… shivers 😅
Who is the shadow at 5:52’ish? The silhouette looks like a man crawling on the ceiling aka Peter/Spider-man and not the lizard? Makes me think that’s Peter and the Venom Symbiote has control of Peter so much that he attacks Miles there.
Kraven the Hunter?  No, Kraven the Giga Chad
Amazing🔥
BEST VIDEO GAME!
I just hope they fixed Peter's face in the sequel, because in the 1st games remaster and Miles Morale's game it just looks awful.
This is my PlayStation comeback 😂
So do i
WOW!
Now just imagine if they actually made it co-op with you and miles wingsuiting across the city
this mf better not be like that mr freeze battle from arkham city
Looks like a PS4 game
The way he just threw the guy he saved to the floor instead of normally checking if they are okay.  These subtle details oh man
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
looks insane! love it
this game COULD NOT LOOK ANY COOLER!!!
Was that sabretooth?
10:59 0n 3 alley oop got me wanting to play this game and the music too in that moment.🔥🔥🔥🔥
u want forgiveness? get religion
U guys need to drop this now plss!!
“I’m gonna put some dirt in your eye.” -Bully Maguire
I wonder what Jameson will say about Peter now that he has the black suit
I have a feeling there’ll be end credits which tease carnage
As a great man once said: “This is something else”
Markeplier the hunter
ayooo miles but gyat daym peter nice water still be water tho 50% there is way better than a picture of waves
I'ma need this
game of the year already
This looks freaking awesome but....i really miss Lizard in doctors white suit.
I wonder how long for pc to get this game. I can waif
Will it be on ps4
This game is gonna be a lot darker than the first! I’m kinda pumped to see it.
Looks like our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man is no longer our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
Hitman 3 is better
The comments are now infested with bots. Make sure you look at the profile picture before replying.
The game looks beautiful but there are knew news about wolverine game ??
Uhhhh time to buy a Playstation
this mf is palpatine bro wtf
I love how much effort Yuri is putting in here. Peter sounds so pathologically angry
This year is an amazing year to be a part of several fandoms...theres so much happening it's insane
This looks AMAZING!!! Fall can't get here fast enough!
Insomniacs been COOKING
I wonder if we’ll have to fight Peter as Miles at some point to remove the Symbiote from him
No thanks buddy I already spent 2000 hours on the original
Is this real or fake
WOWWWWW
5:01 “hadouken”
This is giving me Web Of Shadows vibes! I love this, it’s exactly what I wanted I’m so excited
I saw this yesterday, and I just absolutely can't believe it. I literally was convinced that I dreamed this entire thing. It's literally better than I could've ever imagined. I'm so disappointed that I don't have a ps5
if they're making spiderman 2 then at least make the first spiderman available for xbox bro😭
what if he said "us" referring to himself and venom, and not miles
Just knowing sasuke is sider-man. This is too awesome i really hope PlayStation brings out a Spiderman ps5 like the ps4????
If this is PlayStation exclusive that might be the reason I get the ps5
Yeah it's cool and all but can you skate on enemies?
do we need another spider man? no, we need Wolverine
fckin awesome!!!
8:10 the way he flipped that jet ski hooooaalllyy
KRAVENNNN!!!
Man I can’t 😩 Metal Gear Solid 3 remake , Spider-Man 2 being so freakin fire(finally some respekt on my boi Kraven’s name) , Wolverine game coming out then Tenkaichi 4 ? I’m so glad I got a ps5 ❤
Yuri bringing out his Sasuke Uchiha voice, love it!
“No, he’s never like that”- the foreshadowing is crazzzyyyy!! LOVING IT!!!!’
so its the exact same map ? 😑
this spidey is what we wanted in amazing spiderman 3
this game is PERFECT from now
God I hate Miles. They need to cut him out. Idgaf about him.
I know how it makes Peter more aggressive, but can we just talk about how freaking sick the symbiote combat looks?! The tendrils forming over him, the sheer power behind each hit, and the fact that it has SEVERAL one-shot attacks!!  JUST TAKE MY MONEY NOW!!!
Hope we can play Venom as well...just saying............
I haven’t seen anyone mention this yet but the SPEED looks unreal. That drove me crazy having your speed being capped but in this especially with the wing suit it looks like we can go waaaay faster
Now Spiderman looks like Batman, with so much technological device. The old Spiderman was better, only with spider powers.
The water effect is so bad it's not even funny
now this is a game
Game looks mid
YES! YES! YES! YES!
Is it just me or does this look….. same old?
The game looks great, but it's a shame that miles is on it, that character is just trash
I’m calling it rn green goblin will be the final boss and he’s getting the doc ock treatment tell me why there wasn’t a word ab Norman and there’s all the villains from the last game in the raft when Kraven looks at the screen the one last mystery person I can’t make out
Symbiote spider man is gonna be a menace fr
Everything in my heart was telling me insomniac was going to implement the black suit into combat like web of shadows, and I'm so GLAD I was right!!  Edit: AND THE SLINGSHOT IS BACK!! That was sm fun to do in spider-man 3
ghost me t: i died and  and......ooooommmgggggg
Anyone notice that miles electric powers have changed to the same color as that roxxon generator?
Graphics disappointed me
Love this. I feel Peter has a sort of 1994 Spiderman aggression in his voice like when he bonded with the symbiote.
I know saskue when I hear em 😂
No one talking about Craven looking amazing
Super excited for this game ❤
surely this won't be full price when it looks like DLC for the first one
One thing I loved about miles was the additional shock powers. It made gameplay feel smother than the original. They symbiote powers are on a whole new dimension of combat and it was very much needed for another installment.
This is the Spider-Man that wear’s Timberlands and got blunt
Is this what happened to Liver King
Peters Sasuke era
I love it!
I really hope they're going the let's build a team route and let's kill Peter yet again route.
I remember playing this on the xbox360
I guess I am buying a PS5 now, great!
nice, prototype 3
Yep. I'll be purchasing this.
i love miles morales game on pc, can't wait for this and wolverine
How can you get it on ps4?
Venom spidy is so cool and angry i love it
This looks incredible!
Looks GREAT, imo i understand why they made the suit look slimy in a way but i wish they didnt do that and just stuck to a classic "black" spiderman suit symbiotes mimic it word for word they dont give off the appearance of slimy unless in movement.
1:28 Yuri became Wraith
YEEES VENOM HAS TAKEN SPIDERMANS MIND. LESGOOO. I mean, thats bad but good for the plot
salve
*THIS LOOKS INSANE GOD SAMN*
Graphic from 2012 😢
I'm hearing sasuke voice
I’m loving toxic peter
I really hope venom is playable or gets his own game :D i can only hope
*hits nut button*
Sorry but Peter Parker is Spiderman miles should have his own name gimmick I'm not interested
3:10 something straight outta the Arkham games…this game is 🔥
lighting in darker scenes is kinda bad.
Peter will be the villain?🤔🤔
I was gonna as why the prowler there but forgot bros still alive
I realy love this spider-man sound and this lizard is the best lizard I see it in my life and that's like a croc... in opinion that be cooler so much . black suit was cool but it could better than this we see now . and i think that can be realy cool if we seen taskmaster (cause it's a sub villain then in marvel's spider man), lizard (it's also the Main villain), venom, kraven, green goblin, fancy-dan & ox with the spectacular sm tv series suits & the big boss (lincoln) . the game was so perfect ... and if the green goblin be a main hero i want to see him like the ultimate spider-man coomic book version .
The fact that the voice actor played sasuke that also went though a change of heart and personality and had a vengeance like personality then goes back good again makes this such a perfect voice actor to also play Peter going through a very similar experience! I can’t wait for this game! (You definitely hear sasuke voice when Peter says “so do I” to responds to miles “he has big teeth”)
Definitely going to be the best spider man game.
*spoiler alert*  Spider man 3: everyone is spider man except Peter
All the Xbox kids crying rn💀
Love the “just cause” gliding/web action they added it was fun then so i know itll be way more fun now
YOOOOOO
Is Harry Osborn going to be Venom in this version?
This is gonna be game of the year.
Winged suit is dope
I'm not buying a PS5. I'm not buying a PS5. I'm not buying a PS5. I'm not buying a PS5. I'm not buying a PS5. I'm not buying a PS5.
I saw that map at the beginning, we’re getting more!!!
The combat looks pretty good its gonna be awesome its just a shame that i dont have a PS.
11:31 He isn't real spider man hes venom. He never make people fall while landing but this time oof
This movie is cool. I wanna see more of it.
I got excited but remembered I can’t play it because I have an Xbox😒
Game looks unreal ❤️
He’s changed.
This is sick ong!
1:28 that’s Yuri, so she’s already in action as her full alter ego Very cool
YESSIRRRR W GAMEPLAY
This writing is awful
THIS IS SICK
Finalmente è fighissimo però lo vorrei anche in ita il video
This looks awesome giving me some Ultimate Spider Man vibes hope this game lets you play as venom to
this is amazing beyond comprehension
Even in voice acting with Peter in venom suit you can tell already it’s changed him. He’s super aggressive, short with miles, and only cares about catching conners and kraven he doesn’t even care about  genuinely saving any civilians
They should rename this game to Marvelˇs Venom
dude this looks nuts
It looks so gorgeous. I can’t freaking wait
i hope they just don't put too much stuff in one game
for me what looks good is the graphics which is basically every other game.. regardless, and the cinematic. and the play by the river looks like the typical, mostly self playing "epic" scene like you se all around. i am curious how many would actually think it looks amazing if the graphics was not that good but the rest basically the same?
Im not a fan of the suit. They tried to make it organic armour. On some places it looks like a symbiote suit, on others it looks like thick armour padding dipped in black plasti-dip. I mean, it's alright but I hope that we get variations.
Shippuden Sasuke with amaterasu webs
Definitely gonna be a spider 1v1
Man, I really hope this comes to PC on day, but I know it gonna remain a PS5 exclusive for some time. Hope,the exclusivity isn't very long. Man, I really really wanna play it but not in favorable situation to buy a PS5.
Looks fantastic the water physics are way Off and the splashes are weird but other than that IT Looks Great
"he's got big teeth" "so do i" new spider lookin good
If Spider-Man 2 is Peter going through his worst years but with Miles there going "dude, get your crud together, I'm going through the same stuff, you can do better," I am so in.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DIS FINNA B LIT
Will it release on pc?
Do we know how he got the symbiote
Can already tell this is going to be best game of the year!!!
3:12 He erased the chance of kids ☠️
spiderman Ft sasuke
.
Will I be able to play on PC?
Bonjour il a l’air incroyable il sort quand svp ??
in 2018 i bought a ps4 to play the first spider man game, and know i cant play this amazing game because im a broke high school student because its only on ps5 and i cant afoord one🥲🥲
its peter parker or miles ?  no more peter parker ? wtf
Bros starting to sound like sauske
This Symbiote can be Very Agressive and Brutal and this game shows it!  Yuri is letting his inner Sasuke out when it comes to Angry Peter
Pretty, but to much action and no logic in it.
Weird to see liver king as a villian 🤷‍♂️
Theory: Harry will become venom in the final battle
I’m only mad about one thing  it’s that this isn’t coming out today
Kraven's theme sounds amazing! Reminds me of something else...
Miles Morales is not Spider-Man and I refuse to ever touch a game with him in it. Peter Parker is the only Spider-Man there will ever be
I hope we can have Peter Parker and miles morales as a character to walk around till there’s trouble we can hide and change clothes. We have one time thing from Spiderman DlC silver sable
This is going to be the greatest superhero game ever, it's gonna dethrone Batman Arkham City, mark my words.
Whelp that's how you sell a new console...
Gonna be the best Spider-Man game on earth.
The game has combined many elements from a selection of previous Spider-Man games!  Shattered Dimensions, Edge of Time, Web of Shadows, and Spider-Man 3 (Tobey McGuire).  Thank you, Insomniac!!🎉🎉
FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
I'm calling it from now. The final boss is gonna be peter
I love the gliding. Call back to the OG suit
A lot of people will be selling their xbox this year forsure
im gonna put some dirt in your eye
“YOU CAN’T ESCAPE ME! I’LL CHASE YOU TILL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!”
dayum this looks rushed
The game looks kind of awesome but i hope they improved the wall climbing a bit, in the first one it felt pretty tacked on  But i cant stand how blatantly Yuri is trying to make Peter sound evil, its just kind of corny and too obvious. I know hes supposed to have a slight change in voice when using the symbiote but so far its too much 😂
PS5 only I hope?
YOOOO ITS FINALLY HERE.
Clearly we will build to a Peter v Miles fight
Looks awesome, cant wait to see some youtubers play it.
Will the Chrysler Building be back?
Hope Miles isnt Canon
So, Ganke knows that Peter is Spider-Man now. He didn't know in Miles Morales.
Harry is dying, Conners is the lizard and he’s the only one that can cure harry and leaven’s trying to capture him can’t wait to see the symbiote side of Peter in this
spider-man gets filthy backshots in 4k
Ah yes, my favorite character Peter Uchiha
The amount of detail they put in this game is insane. This will be the most played game of 2023! Can't wait to play it myself!!
Boring.... Nothing special... Blehhhh
I noticed that Miles’ lightning is blue now. Was it because of the nuform he absorbed in the previous game?
Rais from dying light 2
Hearing Peter this angry really makes me miss John Bubniak in the role.
The environment love the more trees and life to a city
This is going to be lit
in think there will be also the buff mode of venom, if so the game is sick
Well I thought of saving up for a new guitar ig now I have save up for a ps5 instead
Not keen on the wingsuit but looks good apart from that
Thank you Insomniac!!!!!!!
im not tryna be a hater but it looked so good until you have to change to miles, i just wanna play as peter the whole game
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks like zoomer's s**t
No. F****** way this is real. There's goes my September October November. EVERYTHING looks improved. Anyone seen a time machine on Craigslist???
я хочу это
I thought the villain was gonna b green goblin bc the end of spiderman 2018
Went from looking like a far cry gsme to an amazing Spiderman sequel 🎉
At first, I was like did I click on the right video
The anger in his voice! Its giving me black suit tas vibes
I can’t wait for this game
Who else thought gankes glider was green goblins glider when it first appeared?
Now spiderman can fly, ok, sure...
its time to wait 2-3 business years for it to be on pc
Spiderman vs spiderman is how it will end!
Wow. 😂😂 not a gamer though but wow. It's just like a movie it's so thrilling
I can’t wait to play this on my Xbox 🙃
This looks AMAZING!!!!
Lol, it looks like James Heller using Tendril
I don't like the symbiote suit design
Never been so hyped bout a spider man game lol 🔥
That symbiote combat sequence felt a lot like prototype haha
Sasuke!😩
Every time I hear symbiote Peter I hear sasuke from naruto. I love it 💙
My only question is when are we getting this on PC?
Watched it 2wice CANT WAIT BOIIII
Its like playing Alex Mercer again
I love grand set pieces like this. Definitely reminds me of the car chase in uncharted 4.
Ganke gotta shut up
Please let us keep the suit after end game 🫡
Keep in mind if spider man willingly let's the symbiote bond to him it will leave Eddy in a heartbeat. The symbiote has always considered Spider man as it's ideal host.
Why Peter Parker sound like Saskue Uchiha?
THEY COOKED
Hypedddd
Superb 👌🏻 can’t wait to play this!!
We don't deserve such a good game
MILES HAS A WING SUIT LETS GOOOOOO
Just putting him in the symbiote suit is going to make this the best Spider-Man game ever made.
Nitpicking here 😬. The water physics still suck. The rest looks great.
Please have a ps4 release
venom texture looks ugly
Looks incredible 😍
yes
As a person who has never touched a PlayStation in their life and has only played on Xbox consoles, *this video is an example of why PlayStation is the goat.*
Imagine how J.J jameson is gonna React to spiderman’s new aggression
Bro this is sick. Can't wait to have it on pc 😍
Is this game also coming on ps4?
Gankee??? i thought it was pronounced Gankey!
What did the Green 👺 did to The 🦎?! He so big and has unique ability! And he looks almost exactly like  "Lizzie from Rampage!!"🐊
Miles is cringe
This is my ONE reason why I bought my ps5,just now😅😮
FINALLYYYYY THE BLACK SUIT😍😍  My Fav
Hope it will be possible not to switch to Miles. That will be such a relief cuz the dlc with him was so boring x_____x
Yo this gameplay is truly next level 🔥🔥🔥
WHATS UP WITH THE  W A T E R  ?
It’s almost unnatural to hear Yuri’s spidey use his angry voice
I am still waiting on a modern Spidey game that will showcase the Symbiote boost in everything you do. Swing speed, jumping, punching, everything stronger. The last one that showed some difference was SM3.
Yuri really took inspiration from Christopher Daniel Barnes’ Symbiote Spider Man in terms of the voice
Why does the suit look like a mod😅
I’m calling it near end gane we get miles vs Peter👀👀👀🔥🔥🔥🔥
God this genuinely made me happy and smile.
I just hope that they at least make sure the main focus is playing as Peter. I mean I love Miles but I really dont want him to be the main focus of Spider-Man 2. It’s only really a worry because thats really the only characters gameplay they show off in this trailer
DAAAAAYYUUUUUMMMMMMMMM
You do not need to watch the entire video. Just pause at 1:27
Another slam dunk by Sony!
*Omg, it's POTATYPE 3???*
Take my money
Are these the finalized graphics? Can’t be.
😱
the aggression in pete's voice 🔥 this one's gonna be more dope than spiderman remastered and miles morales
Swinging animations look crispy🔥
Sasuke’s voice actor 😵‍💫
im actually so mad and sad that i got the xbox series x when this is coming out 😭😭😭 I wish it was just released on ps4 too
Woahhhh
When you are excited for the new game but too poor to buy a PS5
Love how cinematic these games are. Just immediate immersion, and different from other companies.
this is going to be epic and gonna break all records
Sembra Horizon Zero Dawn.
I can't wait for spider man 2 to realise I really like the action and symbiotic and agrassive spider man
Oh man I can't wait to play this in 2026 on pc
I’ve been asking myself how Insomniac was going to top the first game. I’m already sold
Not a fan of Miles, I hope he's just a cameo and not the main character. Everything else looks good.
About time the show
He's mine he got big teeth the croc
brooooooooo peter knows harry is dying im getting more and more excited!!!!!!
If I didn't notice it before but I see some elements of the Batman Arkham game
7:24 I really hope Ganke won't be shoving this kind of humour down our throat's the whole game
It's the same thing nothing new
I really like Miles and Peter working together. I know usually in Miles stories Peter ends up dead with Miles taking over the mantle, but I actually like them in a partner/mentor setup like Batman & Robin or Green Arrow & Speedy. I really hope they don't kill Peter in this game, their dynamic is already awesome.
😊This is one of my favourite games now😮
when did peter parker made that venom suit...i mean when did he started to use that symbiotic suit..??
now i'm getting a ps5
SHOCKERRR ILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!
All i hear is sasuke 😂😂
spiderman devs when they have to program a single drop of blood
I love it
Peter sounds like sasuke 🔥😂
3:03 the way he say “He’s gonna wish he never came to Nee York was chilling. I love how they’re portraying the symbiote
Now I so much want the PS5
Well Dark Spider-man actually sounds Dark
Very nice that the city seems much bigger. It seems it’s not only Manhattan now
I hate how in modern games you get to actually play for like 3 minute intervals and then you put down the controller for 5 minutes for cutscenes
Am I the only one seeing the HUGE WEB OF SHADOW TRIBUTE IN THE SYMBIOTE
Ask much I liked those new flying/diving mid air mechanics, I hope it doesn't ruin the spidey swing experiences. They looked too fast and might as well use them all the time and not swinging. Just my honest thoughts tho, no hate. I know they want to make big differences between the first game so yeah. Change are needed but not too "much". Can't wait to play them!
This might turn out to be one of the greatest games ever made
Everything in this gameplay trailer either really shocked me or made me really happy to see it. Especially Kraven and black suit Spidey
And that’s only 12 minutes 🤯
Better than most of their movies
5 million under  24 hours we  did it.
I love how Pete acts and sounds in this trailer, i just can't imagine that childish face underneath the mask doing it
love miles' new venom from the spider verse
Bully Maguire is back!!!
I’m really not supportive of y’all canceling it for the ps4
OMG Miles arm at 3:37. Ouchies that has got to hurt. hahahaha. Someone wasn't paying attention to the rig when animating.
If you can eat people I will buy day one but only if you can eat people….
Finally a good game that won’t disappoint, unlike OW.5
What's the white rings miles glides through  ?
As much as i love Yuri and his Peter - All i hear is Sauske
I know this is gonna be the best game so ima list my one critique. Make the swinging look a little more realistic that was my issue with the last game which was pretty perfect. I heard someone say there will be an option where you choose where to shoot your webs to swing off I hope it wasn’t bs. Venom looks OD
Spidey fighting like he in the matrix path of neo fr
I love this game
Notice how the eye lids change into a more sharper shape when Peter said "So do I."?
Why a 1080p video like it's 2009? You have a beautiful game to showcase and the bitrate on 1080p is horrible.
I love spider man my favourite
That was a great movie they should make it into a video game it would be ok.
11:54 anyone else notice the eyes changed slightly to look more like venom's?
Sincerely repent and come to Jesus before it is too late Everyone is a sinner he died cruelly for all sinners because he loves you, sincerely believe and you are saved
Yuri is channeling the Sasuke edginess here... Love to see it
I don't like Miles very much so I'm disappointed
this game is so hot
Literally too cool
Man, now Sasuke is in the spiderverse ?
This looks awesome.
Well... looks like i need to buy a ps5 now
I hope the edgelord spider-man arc won't be the majority of this game.
Well looks like i have to get a PS5 now
I like spider sense and the suit of peter😮😮
this game will be a 10/10 if they make the boss fights more than "press x here" "press y here"
I’m so excited for this game!
I really like the design, very organic looking
Symbiote hasn’t looked this fun since web of shadows!!!
I just know This game is gonna make me feel
If Pete had said "So do we" at the end right there, i would had lost my marvels
Anyone else think during the PlayStation livestream that the jungle part was gonna be a different game?
You a fool: spending $70 on spiderman 2 Me a genius: already has it on GameCube
It's next-gen graphics and a game that gets all the juice out of the ps5? Are you serious Insomniac?! I don't like the symbiote costume either, otherwise it's good, except for the graphics and the Peter costume... Hopefully this will be fixed by release, for now it's a disappointment to me.
Jesus “the lizard lose at the fish market” sounds like such an innuendo…
graphics got worse but i dont care i just want an awesome story and a bit more darker
Hell yeah i never been so exicted for a game i was yesterday playing spiderman 2 for ps1
I cant believe i bought the first one looks like this sucks. First time fighting kraven, symbiote? i thought these game take place after establishment lore.
This looks insane was not expecting any of this🤯
❤❤❤❤ can't wait
pete's gonna die in this one
“He got away from us.”  I don’t think he was talking about him and Miles
OMG THIS IS GONNA BE THE BEST GAME EVER CANT WAIT TO PLAY!!!
So much QTEs it's almost like a telltale game. This honestly looks like a step down from the previous games.
Mais do mesmo
So let me get this straight... It's the same map, the same AI, the same combat and the same traversal, just with a few little things added in to call it a new game? WTF is happening to the game industry man?
Peter's feeling too much like the main character right now 🧍‍♀
Are we still getting excited for these cashgrabs?
Dark knight?
Looks the same!
@11:54 when Pete’s eyes slightly form Venom’s eyes when he says “So do I” 😱these tiny details are insane!!! Good job insomniac 🔥
The details they put into miles and Peter are sooo Superb!!!! They literally went deeper into the personality of both.... miles learning how to be his own true version of Spiderman, Peter loosing his humanity to the Symbiote and the malice in his voice is sooo raw!! Can we just play the game now already 🙄 😒 😩
looking like a ps3 game
Sasuke sounds really pissed.
😂 bruh  @11:30 - 11:35
Oh I’m loving this!!!! Peter sounds like he’s out for blood!
I feel like no spider man compares to miles game!
Is that’s Saskues voice?
Pls tell me this is coming out on PlayStation 4
Marvel has never really got its video game adaptations right - except for Spiderman. Stan Lee was a genius, but even he never realized he created the perfect video game hero.
Why do I get the feeling that one of the boss fights is going to be Miles Vs Peter? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Peter Parker sound like a NY drill rapper spitting heat
Love it only a couple of things in witch i hope they add 1 day or game launch give us consequences for wearing the symbiote suit to often like a cutscene or a small game mechanic say you loose a little bit of something like your sanity or something just like what happends if peter wears the simbite suit for to long like in the comics that would be nice and carnage either as a dlc or playable character would love that so much
The one thing I truly hope for is to be able to keep the symbiote after the campaign just to free roam around in it 🙏🏽  Edit: Not sure how that’d play out for the story especially with Venom.  I’m thinking a Web of Shadows concept where Spider-Man and Venom have their own symbiotes but I’m excited to see what they’ll come up with
hopefully they're not biting more off than they can chew. they look like they are promising a lot.
It’s look like DLC to first spiderman.
KRAVENNNNNN!!!!! YOU CANT ESCAPE ME I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!!!
3:10-  How many kicks to the nuts does it take to put one goon down?!
I reckon the Symbiote will take over Miles at some point in the story.
👁👄👁 duh gurllz R' still gagging ❤
Isn't that Peter's home in queens
it looked like the blue lightning can hurt the symbiote I wonder how they're going to implement that in the game.
I think we all know we will get miles vs Parker in this game at somepoint
Eh. I'll wait to buy after it has released for a year when it's on sale
3:10 love the more aggressive moves they gave to the black suit. Reminds me of SM3 the game and Web of Shadows completely changing the way Peter fought. More destructive moves that more brute forced his way to victory rather than swift acrobatics
This game looks freaking awesome! I just hope Goblin is in it, they really teased up his character in the last one
ISSO TA BOM DEMAAAAAISSS
wait on pc
The way Peter at the end says "He got away from us" I think most people think he meant him and Miles but I believe thats a bit of the symbiote poking through
I’m trying to see everyone but it looks Like, Black Cat, Prowler, Wraith, Tombstone, Amazing Spiderman, Ultimate Spiderman, Lizard, Taskmaster, Shocker, Kingpyn
i really enjoyed miles morales spider man, so im so excited for this one!
"Shocker!!": Says Spider Man calmly.
This shi should def be co op
What about plastation 4 you dumm facks???
will this be on pc or is this a ps5 only
The fact that Venom is involved is crazy. I would love to see a storyline for that.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love the way the combat looks but I hope it has more depth then what we were shown also I hope that the web slinging is as fast as it looks when swinging around normally. And also has a failure system to some extent because swinging around like spider man is more fun when there is a threat of failure and not just stopping momentum.
The worst black suit ever...
Do we need live action movies wgen games look so realistic now?? Just make a movie out of it
Will you be able to play this on the ps4? I cant afford the ps5!
5 million  under 24 hours we can do this
I can’t take this spider man serious knowing he looks like a butter faced twelve year old onset that mask. Hearing him try to be scary is so silly.
Not sure if they would do this but what if towards the ending miles vs symbiote peter and choose which one  to play as and that will decide the ending so if u choose miles u beat peter then remove venom from him and they face the next boss together or u choose peter beat miles then face the next boss as peter alone then peter realizes what he has done then goes back to normal… I’m just saying
Yeah okay, nothing special
Was really hoping there was gonna be a co-op feature for this one :(
Can’t wait to play as Peter Parker hood edition 😂
He sounds almost like the Spiderman animated series from the 90's version of when he got the black suit. Overtop voice acting and I love it
This is the quality of the character models in a first party PS5 Exclusive title? When the video first started I thought it was a new Turok game made by some random indie studio.
This looks so crisp I’m excited
Graphics are a massive downgrade, in some places looks like a PS3 game especially water lol
You can literally hear the fear in miles breathing as he gets closer to Connors- I know he’s Spider-Man and all but sometimes We forget he’s literally just a teenager.
Ngl i was expecting more , looks mid imo like the first game. First game ive platted and put about 300 hours into just cos the swinging is a lot of fun but every thing else in that game was disappointing and mid too imo. Hope you can do different swing styles and hopefully they add a realism difficulty to swinging gameplay so if you fall you die and you have to slow down your swing to land
I’m fan boyin at work rn
fun fact: The actor playing Kraven the hunter, Jim Pirri, also played Angelo Bronte in Red Dead Redemption 2. The more you know... :)
I hope Peter is racist towards Miles in this game.
man, this remind me to the web of shadows game :,D
how many of us sitting here watching this even tho we don’t even own or can afford a ps5 raise ur hands🤣 ✋
I feel like Hunter may have hurt or "killed" Felicia Black Cat, and who knows what else to make Peter so rageful.  Of course the symbiote is the main influence but there must be a mental reason as well.
THANK YOU INSOMNIAC YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING INSTANTLY BUYING THIS GAME
Why did they have to stop?
IT'S BEAUTIFUL. WEB WINGS, NEW VENOM ABILITIES AND AWESOME GRAPHICS! AND ALSO...WRAITH! THIS IS GONNA BE SO HYPE! ❤️‍🔥
Amazing spider man vibes, this is great, can't wait!!!
First minute Look like ps3 game
FLYING ?!
Incredible
As soon as miles started gliding I said “that’s what I’m talking about!!!”
I just wanna know what face we’re gonna have for Peter.
ok  ps5 for next chrismass it is!
This looks very cool
5:00 HADOUKEN! ⚡️
This has already won GotY to me. This is going to be a MAAAAAAAAAAAAD amazing game.
My very first SPider-man game was Web of Shadows. This is stoking some old flames, not gonna lie.
Will this game be on pc?
Bro tasted that blood and got a free virus.
I can already tell im gonna buy this game the graphics,animations,swinging accessibility,combat they nailed it bro this was definitely worth waiting for
The voice of suske uchia
The symbiote suit just makes peter flatout brutal
Wow...  now THIS is what sells me on a game.  Not cinematic fluff....  but actual GAMEPLAY.  This looks incredible!
I’m praying old Pete and new pete
anyone wanna donate a ps5 to me?!
I don’t know if it is just me but I think symbiote does not strengthen Spidey here? Yes he got angrier and more arms but he could have taken that jet easily with venom symbiote. But then again, i dunno. Need to play this thru to know more.
Wait, did i just saw Wraith at the beginning? Oh man, Peter's nightmare really come true. He has to fight Yuri who went to the other side.
Does anyone else think toward the end when SpiderMan was by himself and he said “he got away from us” that he’s referring to Venom and himself. I’m calling it, at some point in this game Spiderman is going to say “we are Venom” seeing our lifelong hero as being a possible villain is gonna be emotional for any true Spiderman fan.
If Prototype had a remake
Will be buying 1 copy for me and 1 for my nephew! Thanks for continuing this amazing video game series. The past 2 were incredible 👏
god
looks horrible in 30 fps
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
I have watched this trailer 7 times now and this game is getting delayed i will be surprised if it releasing this year the lighting and texture and not running very well there alot of pop-up the watter is not render well the building in qeeun looks like paper the grass is flat yea this game is either launching next year or in December
Ahhhhhhhh❤❤❤❤❤
I wonder if the symbiot is gonna have different costumes of it like the Spider-Man 3 one Lmaoo
Peter sounds scary. Not angry, not crazy. Scary. And that is something I never thougt I'd hear from him. This is a man who is getting closer and closer to just ignoring his own moral boundaries, and I dread what that will mean for Miles and MJ...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Coming soon Spider-Man 2024  & 2025
Which naive and young minds are excited for this "game"
I swear to god we better get the agent venom suit
Miles Morales is like a robin
0:36 is that the voice actor of Angelo Bronte from red dead redemption 2?
am i tripping or the graphics ain't that great
With that suit on on Peter has the exaggerate swagger of a young black teen
i would love a Pete vs miles fight to remove the symbiote from his body. That would be sick
quick time events 2
*coming out in 2033*
Sergei Kravinoff & the Symbiote suit both look STELLAR  Fantastic character development as always from INSOMNIAC
This looks like SO MUCH FUN❤❤❤
I can't wait until the game releases and I somehow manage to miss hearing about it completely for at least a month like I did with Miles Morales
why is always miles the one who rides the animals 😂
Absolutely love the black suit design. I wonder if we’ll get black suit costumes or at least the option to switch to the black suit post story.
Not a fan of the swinging it’s to easy!!! Spider-Man 2 2004 required skill!!!!
BRO THIS GAME IS ABOUT TO PEAKK!!!
This Peter is way darker than the old one
Definitely the game of the year. Wow!
Worst black suit ever
Finally A Swamp Thing in game
I am angry that Spider-Man 2 is not on ps4 😠😠😠😠😠🔥
They sure that wasn't Godzilla
My hot take:  a lot of people think Norman Osborne will be the green goblin (I hope he is) but Norman has red hair and when’s there’s venom… there’s carnage!    So I think Norman Osborne will actually be carnage and not the green goblin.
I remember playing the original game on PS4, it was amazing, this is even better with the seamless transitions!
OK I FOUND MY NEXT GAME TO PLAY
I bet you Peter and Miles are gonna fight in this game
11:50 the ripples in his eyes are pretty cool
One hand I’m sad they showed all this because it would’ve been an INSANE OMFG moment if they kept it secret but holyshit what is this a hype moment
*Bro's flying like it's Moribin' time* 💀
I don't have a playstation :(
Please release it for PS4 too
Sasuke Parker🔥🔥
I saved it to my list - called Dragon King Gaming
Enffffînnn
I hope this would be available on the ps4 this is so cool
BRILLIANT! 🙂
So far so good, I have minor nitpicks but nothing that can ruin the experience, overall I see mostly improved stuff that was already good/great.  My big concern is if there's wall and aerial combat, the first one was lacky in those areas and I feel like they could take some pages from the Web of Shadows book.  Can't wait to play it!  P.s. the gliding looks super fun!
Sasuke?!?
2:26 What an entrance
Take my money 💰  day one
0 visual improvements... nice \s The story better be really good
If there's no cut scene of spiderman dancing, I'm out
Need the Raimi Venom suit skin Asap
Show the fk Venom
When he said so do I you could hear sauske in his voice
For a PS5 title, those water and splashe effects were terrible. Everything else was amazing. But please insomniac, don't skip out on the minor details.
looked boring
Absolutely love dark spidey. He’s very overlooked on how dangerous he is. Besides characters like Thor, Spiderman can throw down with most with ease. His strength feats are actually nutty, and the idea that he holds back constantly is crazy to think about.
Everyone else just stand totally still until he is done with his most recent air juggle, then they pretend they are in a video game again.  Another pretty movie to sometimes press buttons with though.
Kraven is so hot WTF
The music on this is amazing!!!!!
when peter says ''he got away from us'' at 9:59 i think the symbiot is talking to pete not pete to miles and i love it
Web of shadows vibes
But I like that ❤❤❤
Wow
So we’re beating up women now in the new Spider-Man😂😂😂
Not sure if it's been noticed, but Peter's eye shape is slightly different on the final close up when he says he also has big teeth. Near the center it's more venom like in eye shape with points instead of the smooth version when he first appears.
Bigger better thanks insomniac looks great can't wait to play
Oh what graphics and physics what engine 2023
you can switch omg best game ever
They gotta step up the storytelling to feel more intricate as opposed to feel like such a straight line, it should intertwine more of the world this time around. How the Arkham games were able to have so much exploration and lore throughout the main story is what truly made the world feel immense.
Holy cow this looks amazing!!! I’m looking forward to when the team’s done with the game because it’s going to be a masterpiece!
I don’t like the glide suit thing he’s not Batman he’s Spider-Man and Spider-Man swings
Reaaallyy exited for this one!!!🔥
This is going to be epic but I've been playing spider man games since ps1 and I want to fight different villians
3:03 The way Peter said that was bone-chilling. That’s how dark he’s gonna be in this game.
So my analysis of the game so far: It looks stunning no surprise there, next Kraven looks amazing as does Lizard. Lizards in the game so its got a W from me, Symbiote Spider Man looks good but doesnt look too overpowered which is nice. Peter i dont think will have the Symbiote immediately thatd be too much but we ease into him getting it. I like how the Symbiote changes peter over time they did a nice job of that.  Overall im excited for the game, theyre obviously gonna keep tinkering with it but I love the direction its headed and im excited for the fall, now if only i had a PS5 lol
The last detail on the "Be Greater. Be Together" is a masterpiece. the last clip tells the whole story...Venom likes to erase the 'Together' then Miles(Electric) get rid of the venom and keeps the "Together"
Okay I wanted 2 new things from the new spiderman. The ability to play as venom and a bigger map that includes all of the boroughs of NYC.   Check and check, I'm hyped. This looks so good.
Yuri lowenthal does an amazing symbiote Spider-Man best voice actor they could have chose.
Can’t wait for the PC release!!
i like how violent peter has become
I hope the game warns me before a cutscene just takes away the symbiote suit
Look how Peter threw that man with anger in 11:31. Insomniac even took care of such details 😯😯👌
This what a New Haircut & Black air forces does to a man ! 🤣🖤
Wow...
Hope they release this time simultaneously on both PC and PlayStation 🙏🏻
It's goin down when this comes out! 🔥
Im so excited lol
-Peter with the Symbiote suit   The Fans- *It’s what we wanted all along!*
The little detail of Peter looking at Lizard and back at the helicopter blades, almost as if he was genuinely considering letting those people die to catch Connors. Game looks incredible
Kinda disappointed to see that for Peter they still use the same fighting animation from  the First Game
Ok, this looks fun
I like the design of the symboite, it looks more like a bio-organic thing as opposed to a black costume.
In the screen noraml pete and black pete appeared as a separate person so I assume people will be thinking there is a third spider
Another game to binge watch at yt since I dont own a console 🥳
I was never a miles fan, but give me some Miguel O’Hara to come in and help. Maybe they will introduce wolverine to help and then bam, insomniac releases wolverine
They’re gonna have Peter murder Kraven guaranteed
Had us fooled at the start, I thought that rando was Kraven 😂
Man why can’t they make this for all systems 🫤
I can’t stop hearing MatPat whenever Yuri speaks angry
Game looks great but I can’t stand that HUD🥲
Super Hyping and all of that BUT WHERE DOES THE VENOM COMES FROM SERIOUSLY !? It hasnt been announced it just comes from NOWHERE !!
game truly looks stunning, that hud is awful tho
That right there is bully Maguire
Like this new Prototype game
1:15  I know he called him sir but I’d like to think that’s his right hand man and he called him Ser like “Sergei”😌

nobody is talking enough about 0:48 man the facial expressions are so human and realistic. usually, and by usually i mean in literally every game to ever exist, lipsync and facial expressions are always slightly off, being clearly animated facial contorts and not realistic ones that come from slight deviations in the face. even outside of video games, i dont think ive EVER seen such real human emotion on a 3D animated face. its so subtle, but thats what makes it so good
Oooo that guy at the beginning is a daddy
Nobody should even own an xbox after this came out 😂
Wow, It Looks Amazing. Thanks For The Team Who Worked To Make This Game You Are Cool
Wow, energetic!
SASUKE????
Peter Parker will be the last boss
Game play or cinematic with options? At this point, better make a movie.
There always on point  with the desings for the villians
Waw what is this pleas🫰🦶🙏🙏🙏
Andrew Garfield voicing on this one ? Super excited !
Oh man this look incredible
miles and petter had defferint hud colers nice
I just hope sandmans in this game
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS GAME! 🤩
The only thing I want to see different on this which I was hoping for was different styles of swinging. I see they kept what they had on the previous games and probably just new moves, but I'd have loved to see different styles in how they swing not just the move sets themselves.
Yeah, I came, so what?
Is that sasuke voicing Spider-Man
Why the grapics looks like a ps4 game 🙄
This looks insaneeee❤️❤️
this is looks like its worth 80$
The last time I had fun with the symbiote tentacles, was in the game Shattered Dimensions. The attacks looks amazing!  Looking out for this gem already!
I know it's a long shot but I would like to see yu onomae in the video game as well
E
wow, the game looks impressive.
Why is not on pc too?
BROOO THE PARALLELISM IS CRAZY! IN THE MILES MORALES GAME MILES TRIED TO FIX A HELICOPTER PROPELLER BUT PETER HAD TO SAVE HIM. NOW, IT'S MILES WHO HAD TO SAVE PETER FROM THE NET GUNS :OOOOO
Super ready for this game. I hope it'll hit PC soon after console.
From these 12 minutes of gameplay I can tell yuri is gonna go OFF as symbiote spidey, love the aggressive tone he uses and how his fury shows. This Pete is gonna go all out this time, no more holding back 💯🔥🖤💪🏽
I'm guessing we're getting more of New York in this game. Awesome to see Peter in the black suit and that its going to change how he fights. Also this hands down saved the showcase last night
WHEN IS IT COMING
I need the bully maguire dance.
❤❤❤
I don't know if anyone else noticed this but in the final part where it says "Be Greater. Together" (12:19) It shows the venom symbiote trying to take over but miles' new BLUE bioshock/venom blast (venom blast used to be yellow) sends the symbiote away, like a deterant. They're definitely going to fight or instead of Peter vs Venom, it will be Miles vs venom. Who knows peter might die and miles will be the main protagonist for spiderman 3. Nevertheless, miles will be the one to counteract the venom symbiote and it's hold on peter.
Web of Shadows basecily
They better make Peter do the dance
I miss playing spiderman 3 on ps2 so much after seeing this aggressive Peter with the black suit. The moves he does captures a brutality the old game did not. Amazing.
I am sold
I think it's quite obvious Peter killed those guys
Ik I’m not trippin tht boy Spider-Man is sasuke 💀
I noticed wirh the symbiote he using more of his fist when fighting
Cries in pc 😭
Is this just for ps5 🥺
Looks like the same game. Wish they could give us something new.
Bro I can’t wait for this game comes out
Can't wait to play as Bully maguire, the dance qtes gonna be insane
looks the same old same old in terms of gameplay
And so what do we have? Peter in a black suit fights with Craven, simultaneously trying to save the Lizard. At the end, the final boss of the game is Venom. Is this a remake of the Spider-Man 3 game from Raimi?)
Positive the hunters are dead
Working in ps4?
crafter said this is nasty
I love the return of Vemon symbi , it reminds me of web showdown on PS3.
I really like this sequel, especially with how peters voice, choice of words (like saying "he got away from *us* " instead of me while miles wasnt there) and his behaviour, just before miles said hes got big teeth, look at how pete saved the last citizen. He just threw him on the ground, which isnt normal aswell. The only thing i dont like here is the UI, way to mechanical. Make miles' look more costomised like how he would want it, and pete's UI could be normal at first, but then gets changed the longer ge has the suit on him, like make his healt bar red and white, but later black and white. It would be a small detail to show that the symbiote is more in control.
This looks perfect! We really see how powerful the black suit will make us feel - and how it slowly corrupts us…
This game is gonna be fire 🔥
Of course they gotta promote Kraven with the movie coming soon
First scene  Looks so cartoony nd goofy
Don't want to be negative but the swinging has stayed mostly the same?
Really nice to watch Marvel go like this
this has got to be the biggest and most monstrous Lizard has ever been, he's very similar to the Arkham series Killer Croc.
Reflection on the black suit should be bluish
Poor MJ...
I just.... can't imagine the new face being this angry. Gonna miss the bold face.
It looks like interactive movie rather than a game
Anyone else noticed how more  aggressive Pete's fighting style got after he put on the Venom Suit? IDK, maybe that was just me.
I predict that every suit in this game will have its own symbiote version. (Like this comment for when game releases)
Ok I gotta play the first one
They added the spider man wingsuit  honestly insomniac have smashed this game the upgrades over the previous games are insane
gud one
Lástima que no cambiaron lo de que se suspenda en el aire cuando se balancea estando cerca del suelo.
He better not F with Felicia!
Coop mode would go crazy
Lizard???
On Kraven's New York scan, we saw Black Cat, Prowler, Wraith, Tombstone, Peter, Miles, Lizard, TaskMaster, and one other person.  Wraith looked male, but could still be Captain Yuri Watanabe.
This looks friggin' SIIIIIIICK!!!!! 🕷🕸
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!!
BUT CAN YOU SKIP THE CUTSCENES THO ?
Angry Spider-Man sounds like Albedo and Suzaku Kururugi
Very Nice
yuri lowenthal is killing it. you can hear the sasuke oozing out of peter
Can we play on ps4 ?
Cant wait too play this game
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Bully Lowenthal?!
“watch out for his new powers!”😭 4:56
Beautiful work! I love this tho I’m curious cause I remember how Spider-man 2018 ended & where we first saw the Black Suit in this universe. I still hope it’s the alien symbiote & not the  “created in a Lab Ultimate Spider-Man thing” Earth 1610 did before.  But still very hyped!
Wonder how peter got the symbiote in this story
I’d rather just play Fortnite
Duuuuude!!!!!
WOW ! Lizard and Kraven / Peter Parker black suit symbiote Venom + Miles Morales !
Bro noce video😊
Let’s gooo
me hice caca
It's time for a PS5
Game is a masterpiece 🔥
I hope they try to do what web of shadows did with the whole symbiote switching and good and bad ends.
Imagine Miles with the symbiote
So do I at the end kinda cringe but love this❤
The visual effects look so good
In Miles Morales we're introduced to his "Venom" powers, Now Peter is back with actual Venom Powers which is a dope concept
its like prototype, i love it
thats it this is the greatest game of all time
Spiderman
This might be the game that will make me buy a ps5. Also I really hope we'll get to see more of Insomniac's Wolverine game.
The graphics😮😮😮
So Kraven's Last Hunt tho?
This game is giving me chills
Guess it's time to buy me a PS5
Looks GREAT, imo i understand why they made the suit look slimy in a way but i wish they didnt do that and just stuck to a classic "black" spiderman suit symbiotes mimic it word for word they dont give off the appearance of slimy unless in movement.
Sony removed my previous comment after watching this on the live stream. It’s only positive comments in here. While this looks like the same exact game as 1 and miles morales. It’s so safe. Tears of the Kingdom comes out and Sony answers with this? But people are hyped by this I guess.
Peter FREAKEN scares me now
This game looks perfect but the new games are too expensive for someone 😢 And me😑
Oh no that means miles going to fight Peter
Looks like some DLC
lmao this looks so bad, dude has a giant animal skull strapped to his shoulder, RE5 ps3 muscle graphics. hard pass.
Omg fortnite?
Meh... i can already predict the game ending (uh spidey venom suit vs. Miles and miles has to kill peter in the fight) The story of miles morales was already so predictable i got realy bored 🤷‍♂️  + i dont like the suit 🤷‍♂️
I won't be happy until Peter shoves away Miles and says, "later chump".
The gracie is sooo great 😍  I've to say i'ts MARVEL ❤❤😎
i love that  peters black suit looks so diffrent and the graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaphics are so good
I HAVE PLAYED MARVEL'S SPIDERMAN  CAN I PLAY IT DIRECTLY OR I HAVE TO COMPLETE PARTE LIKE  TURF WAR SILVER LINING CITY NEVER SLEEPS PARTS OF GAME ?
Now I wanna see what wolverine will be like since it’s also from insomniac so far they have not failed 🔥🔥🔥
there will 100% be a boss battle with Miles VS Peter: Dawn of Justice. hopefully you’ll be able to switch between them mid fight making for a wild boss.
This is going to be awesome!!!
I beg you tell me this won't be a PS5 exclusivity.i NEED IT
I love the fact insomniac is not hiding symbiote at all
This game looks soooo good!
peter is about to put dirt in everybody's eyes
Let me go ahead and buy a ps5
Yuri is really going full Sasuke with this one
I like how Ganke screamed even though he's a robot
Why dont for Pc ?? 😑😑
Kraven theme goes hard
I'm genuinely curious if they're going to put in some player choice with how much you use the symbiote suit which will affect the ending. Probably unlikely but it could've been cool.
am i tripping or does pete sound like MatPat
Bugspiderman!
Spiderman reminds me of slenderman with his tentacles, cool ngl💀
Everything about Spider-Man 2 is wat Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the justice league wishes to be😢. A masterpiece
SHOCKER, YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME. I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. SHOCCCCKKKEEERR
After watching the Gollum review from Skillup it’s refreshing to see truly well made $60-$70 games like this are still being made
The water looks awful. This needs longer to bake on the oven. Do not release this this year if the game isn't finished.   This is not Insomniacs normal level of visuals. This should not release this year.
Waiting for Xbox release it was confirmed that first Spider-Man game was coming to xbox
I’m just wondering who’s getting the Venom symbiote after Peter gets rid of it. Harry, or Eddie?
This looks really awesome. But there's a slight blurriness to the footage. I hope the actual game looks better
What in the futuristic spider dump is this 🫠
safe to say the enemy ai is still crap.
I hope the lizard part gives me the same vibes of killer croc from Arkham Asylum
This game, good
So no co op?
*i hope turning on the symbiote is optional like in web of shadows* *Having the black suit is cool but i still wanna rock the red white and blue!!*
WOAH! ♥
1) Fighting animation or the overall animation blending have improved quite significantly. 2) The lighting especially the GI seems to have also improved  3) They seems to have also bump the overall texture resolution or texture filtering. But I'm not confidence to judge on a compressed Youtube video.
@beastboyshub uhm ummm?
I cant wait to watch this story play out! Spiderman ps4 ending had me in tears 😢. Plus i love how they just made the lizard a dinosaur lol
No need to play, Miles and Ganke duo already ruined it.
Bro went from Ben to sasuke
Ohhhhhhhhhhh venom spiderman looks too op 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 i cant wait  MILES HAS A WINGSUIT!!??!?!?!?!?!!?!,!?!
How much i wish this could be on the ps4, half of the people that see this prob don't even have enough money to but a ps5 plus the game😢
Does anyone else also get black suit reminds of spiderman web of shadows?
Takes me back to my prototype days
Miles morales? Sigh......
Love how both the mirage trailer and spiderman trailer came the same time lol
They did really good job, black spider man and symbiote are really scary
The lizard, Kraven and hopefully Venom’s the Final Boss this gonna be good
THAT WAS STRAIGHT FIREEEE
LETTTSSS GOOOOO IT LOOKS SOOOOO GOOOOD
Will the Green Goblin be a part of this sequel?
Yuri doing an edgy Spiderman voice is incredibly hilarious to hear
Now if they just let us free roam as Peter Parker this would be great
An angry superhuman capable of lifting trains, still can't 1 tap regular humans, no matter how buff they get they shouldn't tank like this.
IS UNCLE AARON BACK TO BEING THE PROWLER????
А когда выходит игра?
*one thing i noticed is there's no more gadget wheel*
Lol hopefully I wasn’t the only one, but literally at the beginning of this I thought this was gonna be a stupid new IP and I walked away only to come back in the room to see spidy. Looks amazing!
Kraven is absolutely terrifying and I love it
First i hoped for a superior spiderman Story
Even tho Sony own the rights to Spider-Man. It still belongs to Marvel
Looks like DLC 😐
Gotta love the work they did with the title cinematic 12:22  The word together was stolen by Venom, but Miles's shocks broke the Venom tendrils.
Take my money 💰
Meu irmão isso ta lindo demais !!!
Yeaaa I’m switching to ps5 😭
Niiccee! Where should I send my money? And remember folks, it's better to delay a bit than relasing an unfinished game.
Hope they have Shocker and have Peter yell, "Shocker!!!! You can't escape me. I'll chase you to the ends of the Earth" 90s Spidey was awesome
In the scene where there is a map of nyc at the very end in the top above taskmaster there is another character and I’m not sure what it is
Wing suit ❤️
Love how they brought back crigon the hunter thank you marvel
I wonder if before this they will show how Peter got the symbiote, or maybe instead Miles will do some detective work and slowly piece the story together and we will find out along with him
Please don't take forever to bring to pc
I was expecting some new improvement in swinging, combat and swooping like in previous Spiderman games
Me: "There's no such thing as a perfect video game."  PlayStation: Here is the Spider Man 2 Gameplay Reveal Trailer  Me: "...So how much do you want?"
Spider-Man: Prototype. I love it.
Yuri Lowenthal and the black suit. Perfect. Just perfect.
Notice how Miles spider senses didn’t go off when Peter came through the ceiling. Just shows that Peter hasn’t became a threat yet even with the suit on
👏🔥🔥👏🔥🔥🔥 Amazing
i love the new HUD and the reskin of the lizard. He looks much mroe intimidating here than in The Amazing SpiderMan
wont we be shown how venom got to Peter?
God I hope there’s a trippy af sequence Peter’s mind when he starts rejecting Venom like in the comic
Oh my God I haven't been this excited for a video game since... Well since Marvels Spider man 😂
Man I wish this game’s on ps4
This one is going to be a killer game of the yr for sure💯💯 ... so can't wait for it to release
WRAITH! Yuri@
I love how you can see the texture of the symbiote on the suit. Unlike in Spider-Man 3 where the black suit is just threads. Can't wait to see the rest!
I’m not super sure how I feel about the angry venom Voice Yuri is doing.   Like when Josh Keaton was doing Black Suit Spider-Man it was clear there was a different tone but he didn’t have to do a different voice.  (Well except when he was voicing the symbiote in his head)  This too me sounds more like the “SHOCKER!!! YOU CANT ESCAPE MEEEE! ILL CHASE YOU TO THE END OF THE EARTH!” Approach.  I mean I really shouldn’t be nitpicking what is probably going to be game of the… century but still thought it was odd.
Just Insane
No wonder why it took this long BECAUSE ITS JUST TOO COOL IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL TO MAKE IT THIS GOOD
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
I love how Ganke is probably just in his screaming at a computer screen as the drone is hurling towards the gunship 😂
Spiderman prototype
I love how symbiote Spider-Man has a much more aggressive fighting style and they way he is, Is just perfect
Venom is definitely Sasuke's eng voice actor. Pretty dope 💯
Sasuke??
This looks so sick! I also like how you switch between Pete and Miles. Can't wait to play this!😍👏
I also love how with Pete we’ll have a lot of Symbiote based attacks and with miles it’ll have a nice variety with a lot more of his tech side It would be nuts if Spidery uses his tech with the Symbiotes
If he doesnt say the iconic "I'll chase you to the ends if the eaaaarrrtthh!!!!" line, I'm not buying.
THE GREAT HUNT BEGINS
bro i’m getting this game
😱
is it me or spider man is not so friendly now?
Same graphics of ps4
0:19 E se o cara que deixou rastro de sangue tivesse aids???
This is crazy🥲🔥
One thing I feel like people are missing is that playing in Queens is available. That is a massive addition, as Queens is a bigger borough than Manhattan. And Insomniac has said that the whole area will be openly available, along with other 4 boroughs. That is enormous! This game will truly be a showcase of what the PS5 is capable of.
They’re low key hinting at a 3rd game as well 🤣
I know that at the end everything is subjective but man I truly feel like insomniac just, they just get Spider Man This looks like it’s going to be an absolute blast between the story writing  The combat/exploration  Just like with Jedi Survivor this game to me truly seems like it will shape up to be a true AAA polished sequel  Im really excited to 100% this bad boi  And I hope everyone else enjoys this game all the same ✊🏻
I really wish we get the Kingpin beat down from the comics
This looks excellent!
But when is the exaggerated swagger of the black teenager
We want games, not movies.
I just love the gameplay. It’s fluid and fun all round 😊
The hype is unreal 🔥
Hearing Yuri play Sasuke for years I know his performance as an angry peter is going to be LEGENDAY!
11:32 "F*** outta the way"
There was a Spiderman game on Xbox 360 I think n u could actually make choices like to be good or evil and it would impact the outcome of new York forget what it was called but man it was lit
This is what we should have gotten for a avengers game  This is the type of movement & gameplay we needed for every avenger in they own way being flexible & fluent making them adapt & feel really there the scale of the map to was also a thing people didn’t fight hard enough for open world marvel online marvel game so we never got it’s full potential but just imagine if Lego can make open world marvel game with its characters & fighting these big companies can too
too bad its not for ps4 :(
Yesas I can't wait
Anyone else notice when Kraven was shown the map how in the top left it originally showed Doc Ock, but swapped to Kingpin right after?
I hate how he stays in that stance after the fights over with. They should change that and have him standing straight  once the fights over with
When is it releasing
Really convenient that the enemies wait 5 seconds before shooting and fight in the modern day with bushwhacking machetes.
why did they change the color of miles Venom blasts?
WE ARE COOKING🗣️🗣️🗣️
Rip x box players 💀
Just like TOBY 😂
Looking forward to the Bully Maguire moments xD
They just threw so much at us all of a sudden 😭😭
RELEASE IT ON PC AND DONT MAKE US WAIT ANOTHER 2 YEARS
So I was looking at the map for kravens great hunt and I can recognize tombstone Felicia, Peter miles and I think electro, can anyone make out the others
Ok ig I’ll buy a PS
WEB OF SHADOWS TWO BABY LET'S GOOOOOOOOO
Miles basically throwing himself into the water with lizard to save Peter was so amazing. Can’t wait for miles and Peter I’m this game!!! And ganke helping them!!
Am I trippin or Peter with the symbiote sounds like sasuke
Yoooohooooo here you goooo
After I saw this I almost sharted myself
Miles definitely gonna have to give Peter dem hands before the end of the game
Miles slingshot was cool af
I love the vocal gruff peters voice actor added, it’s kind of reminiscent of the Peter Parker from the animated show when he had the symbiote but much more grounded and realistic not cartoonish just badass, this games about to be incredible can’t wait!
Doesn’t the suit remind anyone of ultimate shattered dimensions. Wonder if they will include a rage mode.
amazing
yay another game full of quick time events that I can platinum in 10hrs. Awesome!
bro legit saved that civilian then let the inertia drag him on the ground
Extremely common Insomniac W
Ngl, Im getting feels that Miles's BioElectricity will be a major factor helping Peter get rid of the symbiote.
bully maguire time
Did miles just do a kamehameha🤯🤯🤯
GET BACK HERE KRAVEN KRAAAAAAAAAAAVEN YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
Marvel can y’all please put this on Xbox
ps5 only? not available on pc or ps4?
Wow!!
wow🔥
Goty potential
Are they using the remastered peter Parker or are they going back to the original peter
Kraven being in the game is fantastic.
NO IMPROEMENT IN GRAPHICS THOUGH
Haven’t seen the word love stated so much in a comment section😂
This looks awesome but with the new abilities it looks even easier. Like you can stomp through armies no problem
did this mf miles just kamehameha with lightning
So lizard is co villain ?
amazing, i love it
This deserves goty
11:32 what a d-bag symbiotes really changed Pete 😂😂😂😂
Can't wait for Cory Kenshin to play this!!
Xbox players willing to pay for this game: 😒
So we gotta see Kraven in every Spider-Man game to ever exist?
Rip Xbox
This game is gonna be fire and will break many records and  I am Totally hyped man
let me guess, one of the last missions is Miles vs Symbiote suit Peter, then you save peter and have an emotional reunion and team-up to fight the final boss
Seeing Spider-Man in the Symbiote Suit fight more aggressive and sound so terrifying had me kicking and screaming in excitement
As cool as this looks, I would have loved to see an original take on the symbiote: not inherently evil, but wanting to permanently bond with its host. Something Peter does not want, thus causing the symbiote to hate him and bonding with Eddie Brock who also hates Peter and together the symbiote and Brock share a common goal. The hateful symbiote is cool - but a little overdone at this point. This trailer looks mad though!!
Make me wanna buy a PS5 😅
Sasuke is out here tryna be spider man
Not a big fan of the web shooting sound effects but everything else is just fire ❤‍🔥
2018: We had the best Spider-Man movie of all time and the best Spider-Man videogame of all time 2022: We’re about to get their sequels with high potential of being even better
will this be on ps4
How did mile's venom change colour?
I am venom
sheesh
IT LOOKS SO COOL!! 😍😍😍
the music when miles starts swinging ❤‍🔥
Using same graphics engine as the last games 😂😂  not much of a true sequel. Def will be buying it though.
Only ps5?
marvel we ned remake spider man the movie game
GOTY
I'm You tuber❤❤❤
I'm a PC gamer but this and GoWR are DEFINITELY tempting me to get a PS5
Oh my god. Deadpool in the game i gotta go buy one now
I think Peter would be scarier if he had his normal voice and just sounded that angry
Mile morales: *jokes 😂😂😂 Peter Parker: 😑😑😑
The Venom suit looks HORRIBLE! Like a giant ballsac!
Bro Peter's voice 🥶🥶🥶🥶
I'm super hype but the interface doesn't look really good and take too much space on the screen, hope they fix it. still hype tho
If anything, please give us an option to still use the Black Suit after the ending. From the look of things, quite likely that they will team up to fight Kraven, and Peter will attempt to kill Kraven for good, and Miles will try to stop him. Bam final boss - defeat your mentor, and get rid of the Symbiote.
2:58 tilts head.. "Sasuke?!!?"
omg they got godzilla
Only ps5? Booo
Has anyone noticed the SFX for the web shooters has been completely overhauled? It sounds so satisfying.
That looks like Gotham knights, who agree
I am so hyped this game Looks WICKED
OMG This looks amazing!!! I touch my ps5 2-3 times a year but I bet this and GTA6 is going to make me a gamer for some time! Not really something you really want doing at 28 but the kid in me is  taking over haha!
“So do I”
NAH THIS THIS GAME IS HARD I NEED TO GET THIS
Bro his persona change with the black suit giving me Web of Shadows vibes fr! 🕸
PC!!
The Venom suit looks HORRIBLE!
If  miles morales was born 2003 that makes him 20 in this game, and Petrer is about 28 years old
I like that Miles realises something is wrong. Like, fundamentally wrong.
Is this going to be available for the ps4 as well?
So excited for this game!
I really hope that in this game, someone says the most well-known line in the Spiderman franchise.
9:47 that ain't the lizard, it's a frickin Godzilla
First
Can’t wait for the PETER VS MILES BOSS FIGHT !!!!!!
Spiderman is not black.  Miles failed on his own  now they have to shove him down our throats by pairing him up with Peter
ps only or xbox this time to?
At this point, evolve miles by calling him firefly/fire spider or something. I mean his own powers aren't even reminiscent of a spider at this point. On top of that his gilding practically looked like flying and he looked more skilled at it then peter in this vid. He barely needed his webs after the initial launch. Keep his main mode of travel a mix of building leaping, wallrunning/wallcrawling and gliding but couple it with his electric powers and explain that it boosts his jumps and pushes by concentrating it to his feet and hands. Maybe make his wing suit work in tandem with his powers. Either get rid of his webs for combat because in the vid he barely looked like he needed them, or keep them for grappling through which ,as he already does, can send electricity to shock enemies.
dope. venom feels like playing as Alex Mercer in prototype
Is other boroughs playable other than manhattan?
Cool game, but i hope they have performance mode High fidelity mode and something in between at launch
Waiting for Spider-Man Web of Shadows 2
I cant belive sausukes voice actor is the same for spiderman
shizzzz!!!! peter is starting to get aggressive and dismissive cuz of the suit!!!!! luv this
Peter is gonna be final boss😳nah i doubt it but hes definitely gonna fight miles
no way spiderman can fly now
just give peter chickens
You can definitely tell that the symbiote has a hold on Peter and it’s slowly consuming him.. just the sudden shift in tone, attitude and personality as well cutting the side talk quip banter he has with Miles regularly.. This game is gonna be one hell of a ride.
Insomniac just can't miss with these Spiderman games man
not a fan of the movement should be more fluid during fights. spiderman shouldnt stay still after every attack
So no 2p
Game of the year🛐
I saw how big the lizard was and it made me think of the lizard fight in spiderman 3
Venom better be a playable character. That’s all I’m saying 🥱
yuh
I need a release date!
We just had no idea, how much rage Peter had pent up inside of him after being through so much and losing a lot. The  symbiote is bringing it out that anger bit by bit.
İt must come to PC🥲
The graphic never improved since 2018 or sth
like like how the up the retopedhead its the moment all moment come oncould carry my all productivis of the offert a great film Kaligraficozarted
Wait!!! Did he me “us” as him and Miles, or “us” as him and the suit…..I’m going with #2. That suit is taking control…..fast! I can’t wait to play this game 😄❤️‍🔥👍
If there's one thing I learned from this trailer, it's thay the East River is not a river, but a salt water tidal flat...
This new prototype game is dope!
this reminded me of Web of Shadows black suit combat i had so much fun playing it
The BGM is incredible during "perhaps a new hunting ground" WOW
These games are like movies keep it up insomniac we love it 💯💯💯💯🍿
I could already see it, peter being consumed by symbiote and Miles will have to save him.
Webs of shadow vibes
Yes, i think im gonna enjoy this one more than the first,looking sick, i played the first a few months ago and it was the first game i 100%
I feel adding the flight/gliding suit to that extreme feels very OP.
Peter acting just like Peter in SM3 movie when after venom suit
1:27 many people including tombstone, prowler and taskmaster appear. I hope they're in the game
symbiote spider man looks good, the voice, the combat moves are more violent than normal. Also kraven looks cool as hell!! 😎😎😎. I only hope that we get to play has venom or perhaps kraven itself after we complete the game or something like that, more than a change of suit
The pace of the game makes it feel more like a CGI movie than a game. 2 minutes of gameplay for every 3-4 minutes of cinematic doesn't seem fair, even more so when that gameplay is on rails or guided sections.  And the voice of Spiderman in the black suit is so overacted that it gave me indigestion.
this looks insane
ui is meh but hopefully the symbiote is like web of shadows
Miles Morales is the only one who help and save Peter Parker from getting him out of the symbiote suit, not just fighting him but talking him out of it to help him realize and understand what he is doing.
Venom's ability looks crazy and satisfying
I just hope this wont be a 200 gb game that also might have many later patches which may or may no be each 50 gb. Just optimise the game properly sony
It look like that symbiote will cause big trouble perder parker vs moles Morales
Reminds me of the spiderman 3 tie in game. They had a mecha lizard black suit spider man and Kraven.
pc release date???
sa
How come miles doesn't waterboard himself?
Definitely gonna win game of the year.
Prototype 3? Finally!
This feels.... Goood *rock music starts playing*  But seriously I'm going to have to catch up with these games because this looks awesome.
please put it on steam
😍🥰
Hyped! Sadly PlayStation exclusive. But Hyped.
I just hope theres a setting to take away all the ability list and all the hints. I want immersive gameplay. Hope the graphics of the water improve too
we need the movie
Looks ...AMAZING!
If that's a ps5 exclusive i swear
YOOOOOOOO
This looks amazing  Will this be on multiple platforms or just PlayStation like the other Spiderman games
I feel like they went overboard with Miles’ electric powers… he was already to op with hi original ones and now he’s practically static shock
Time for nitpicking! Anyone else not a big fan of the black suit design? Those shoulder pads look weird!
Wow
i feel like the symbiote suit needs reworking, and maybe give it a bit of spider man web of shadows movements with also new moves, the symbiotes' attacks also feels differente than any of the movies and games, would love it getting updated and reworked and given skins like purple suit
Insomniac went nuts with this one. Can't wait to play it
Why does the black spiderman sounds like he's going to take a revenge on his brother for killing their clan🤣
5:00 HADOOOOKEENNNNN
I love TOTK but man this will be a GOTY contender for sure
don't know if the graphics got an upgrade Game looks cool as **** tho!
The gameplay os so realistic og
I’m ready for this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where the story where the emotional like moives where the drama where the cinamitc 🖕 it's like RPG games with 3d shits
I NEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDD this Game 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 we fcking got the black suit ‼️‼️‼️
The voice acting of Peter is not good. Also the bits where the Symbiote suit makes him get tentacles and random mega sized rope things are really lame. I think the Symbiote should be more closer to how Spiderman 2 was like in PS2. The focus should be on the punches and complex martial art moves.  That's my 2 cents.
se pasaron de verg
My only hope is that we get to explore Peter and Miles house like with The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and have missions that can be done stealthily by option instead of going in loud and proud like we did in the first game how we did in the warehouse beatdowns as much as I love beating enemies at every turn I love going quiet and having the ability to have 6 rounds of enemies I can defeat quietly that get increasingly harder to take down in stealth mode as Spider-Man or as Miles
If i dont get a emo peter parker dancing im not buying
Loxist subversion
this looks like a confusing mess if im honest , i dont see any imporvement on the actual swinging mechanic and i despise the fact they can outright fly , disappointing
Miles morales can glide through the air that is cool
3:10 perfect display of how brutally swift and aggressive the symbiote makes Peter. He's really amped up.
wtf thats the best use of miles ive seen, like rivaling spiderverse
Gameplay looks great, Graphics do seem weird like not as good as the remastered version of the original game, but this is a gameplay demo so that fair, character models have always looked amazing and here they look better.
Yuri is channeling his Sasuke in this one lol
gives me feel like a watching a real movie!!!!! goosebumps!
Will pc can handle this graphics??
I like this new Pete he’s bully Maguire
The way peters voice changes in the symbiote suit kinda gives me nostalgia to WoS
now i have to buy a PS5
Oh man... that looks amazing. Time to purchase ps5 ig
But I want it NOW
Makes me wonder if they're going to try and squeeze Green Goblin into there as well, or if they're saving that for a third game.  They already VERY heavily hinted at the Green Goblin being in the pipeline, so the question is most 'when' not 'if'.
Venom + spider man op
It looks cool and boring and new and old at the same time
Brooooooo this is gonna be huge
11:13 Spider man doesn't Kill
Pete now is the very definition of " violence was always the answer ". Maybe i will watch people play it on youtube . Too poor to own ps5.
So the classic church tower scene is totally gomna include a boss fight with Miles fighting Venom Peter right?  Also the Miles game revealed Oscorp had a space program YEARS before the games took place so Venom could still be an alien
Looks fantastic.  Especially love the create your own web lines in stealth mode.  The first one remains one of the best console games ever.
😀🤤😃🤤This is gonna be sooooooooo good!
kinda hoping they go all out with this and its the last game. with kraven, venom, goblin, perhaps sandman, spot and such they really dont have many left for future. if they make a 3rd game set in some negative zone or whatever new environment and use tertiary characters or recycle old fine but these 2 start to seem like the 2 psx games that featured pretty much everyone who is anyone
2:58 Sasuke, is that you??  Edit: It is Sasuke lmao. No one can get a role in Voice Acting now lmao.
I noticed how much is color coronated
peter sounds like english dub sasuke exactly the same am i the only one to notice
The visuals look weak for next gen.
Simply amazing... it's unbelievable how Insomniac keeps topping itself
I knew this would happen they're pushing peter aside making miles the main character Guarantee peter will be the final boss, who knows if he'll even survive the game
😍
AYY YO WE GOT SYBIOTE SPIDER!
This game looks incredible, graphics are on point. Love that you can use Spider-Man and Miles. Pumped for this release.
All I gotta say is, the final battle better be Miles vs Peter. Electrifying showdown of the century.
I hope they add a ability to freely change the black suit like in web of shadows. But it already looks like a masterpiece. The tone is completely different, more eerie. Peter entering to talk to miles the silhouette of him is intimidating and badass. The fact that is thinking less with his head and acting on anger, for miles to have to correct him and save him shows Peter is completely changing and I’m here for it. When he said so do i, I believe that was symbiote talking, the eyes the tone the foreshadowing. Just incredible insomniac.
Finally a sequel to Prototype after all these years!
🕷️
Can't wait to listen to the official soundtrack of this game. The main theme is amazing!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I don’t know the extent of the Symbiote in this game, but seeing Venom always makes me want a game and to play as Venom. :)
So this is the game of the decade not a year! FOR SURE! MASTER PIECE!
I love how peter is not dancing Jazz to make Mary Jane feel bad
Best video i saw today
I love how gankie is just yelling while getting thrown into the plane even though he's not really there
It's prototype remastered...
I think if the rest of the game is anything like this, it will quickly surpass the original in my top 10 games ever
Can I get it for free im a youtuber
BRO THAT'S AMAZIIIING OMG
Did i just see miles do a kamehameha
Yesss, love that we can play as both characters, cool to see some gliders on Miles' suit as well and a few other new tricks like the web line and multiple perch takedowns at once
Imagine if Insomniac faked us out with the original teaser and Peter is the venom at the end of it and we have to fight him just like how Pete fought Doc ock 😢
Man web of shadows peter vibes
i can make this game from scratch and it'll be 100x better
If theres a game thats gonna make me get a PS5, this might be it
This game looks like trash lol
That was insane!!
Wow, just wow!
This game looks absolutely insane, can't wait to see the release!
Ganke causally screaming “MILES” through the loudspeaker of a drone 😂  Swear, I’m never telling my friends my secret identity
this actually looks so cool
Game of the year.
my man sasukes coming out to play.
Will this be on pc
voz do sasuke
im excited to play this game
Having Sasuke’s English voice actor for Peter in symbiote suit is perfect it’s *chefs kiss*
The animations and combat looks so amazing. I just hope there's a bigger difficulty where more than one ai fights you at a time
I like how the tone of the game is more serious , and there is blood , FINALLY
Scn❤
Spider Cop gone rouge
This is so cool
Facilmente um jogo que poderia rodar no ps4. Nunca vi uma nova geração com tão pouca inovação em questão de melhoria, já estamos a 3 anos no ps5 é ainda assim não tivemos nada tão impressionante de exclusivo que diferencia de um jogo de ps4. Olha essa água, que cena horrível. Por enquanto tanto no Xbox quanto no ps5 estou decepcionado com essa nova geração
Imagine a fight between miles vs peter..
Ayo the way Peter came in was absolutely menacing!, he’s super sketchy.
The gliding!!!
We had bully maguire now we have bully Lowenthal 💀
I think it would be cooler if he said so do we
The mods have to add the Spiderman - 3 black spiderman theme around sometime.
I WANT THIS GAME IN MY POSSESSION
Лан
This right here is peak gameplay. I’m very impressed 🔥😭
1:54 1:55
BRO MILES GOT THA WINGS LIKE MIGUEL 🥺🥺🥺
😮😮😮
Is it just me or does this version look a little cartoonish? Also I wish they would make a split screen coop version.
I always appreciated miles as an apprentice of spider-man. Creates a cool dynamic between the two. Just stop making miles fart out new powers and let him develop.
Why are these games creating a better continuous Spiderman storyline than any other media property has ever managed to do?
This gene is worth every cent. I lm getting it when it arrives!
It looks really good but I just want want new animations for everything. All of these recent sequels have been feeling like a super DLC.
I see Miles learned the Kamehameha
I still want all blue screen control not rainbow colors on it
I don’t really like how the black suit looks here but everything else looks awesome.
‘Metal murder bird’ I like how he still quips even as a deadly rage monster that kill anything and everything
Oh yea, we can already see the big showdown between peter and miles.
I’m gonna put some dirt in your eye
Peter got some sasuke in his voice
It’s been so long since I’ve seen the symbiote suit change Peter.  Hopefully weird stuff can happen in the gameplay that would only happen when wearing the suit.  Like some eternal darkness stuff where venom starts talking to him, or some moments where he gets overly violent in some rare finishers.
Это выглядело неплохо !
Is there a backstory of how Peter got the Symbiote Suit?
OMG 🤩🤗 now this is a sequel! I love the symbiote animations
No one is complaining about puddles anymore?
first time seeing game this realistic . game are becoming relistic and movies are becoming fake like
I'm disappointed that they didn't improve the swinging and make it more like the old Spiderman 2 game.  Also disappointed how cartoon-like Peter and Miles sound.  Peter is much older but he sounds like a kid still.
Why when I saw prowler I thought it was deadpool
Bbs gonna love this
Kraven looks like he plays Among Us 2: The Game
Insomniac. You’re about to make this fanboy cry cause of how good this looks. My god this is looking Phenomenal!
11:38 He’s not talking about him and miles…
Why do the guys have perfect fades in wild?
They better have this on ps4 also when it comes out cause I'm not buying a ps5 so I can play this game
damian sandow is Kraven? lol
هذه اني الاسود 🕸
I think it may actually be green goblin norman osborn
peter just shoved the civilian after saving and miles is aware of the bit change
Ngl i think spiderman is overrated af
I'm so excited about this game🤩. I love how Pete is not being mean to Miles but more serious and dismissive and how there are new combos and techniques we can use. I just have a question that has been stuck in my mind since I heard about the game🤔. I heard that the game is only gonna be available on PS5 and I am not sure if this is true or not🤔
I love this, but I really wish they did more animations with the web swinging, or at least kept miles old swinging animations.
Goty year definitely going to platinum this game
Sony has a GOTY in his hands here, no cap.
Why no coop
I really love this game but I don't think Kraven or Venom is the main villain
I hope the dev will make pete as aggressive as possible in the game. I typically love superhero media when they've darker and more serious tone. The insomniac interpretation of spiderman characters are better and more matured than whatever MCU is doing these days.
Had me at the edge of my seat looking like 😲
11:55 - Bro acting like hes vengeance
Great😮
I really hope this will be for ps4,but they said its for ps5.But like miles morales,it was said that it was for only ps5 but then it became for ps4 too,i hope it will be for ps4.
So we can officially have Bully Maguire in a modern video game now.  Half these kids aren’t even old enough to legally get dirt in their eye.
Look epic!
I only have two minor issues that I’ve seen with what they showed but I’m hoping they are just cause it’s the first trailer. First of all the web swinging they’ve shown from Peter looks exactly the same as the PS4 version. Same animations and everything. He’s swinging the same way even with the black suit on which should be a little different. And the second one is just how the symbiote suit looks like he has shoulder pads on. The symbiote should look like it’s consuming his body not just venom over the suit if that makes sense
😮
Omds this is going to be so good
We all look forward to games like this more than the marvel movies lately
I'm so hyped! Can't wait
Wow this looks awesome! The symbiote suit was crazy.
4:29 amazing spiderman type play
like prototype
Are we getting the original Parker design or the terrible remaster one?
spiderman 1 with goat simulator 3 graphics
If there’s an option where Spider-Man can dismiss Miles or cut him off in mid-sentence…I will pay extra for that.
Man I love how the symbiote really changes peter. He isn't himself, he still rescues civilians but he has to think about whether he should or shouldn't. To think innocent pure Peter would change so much. His whole personality as well as his fighting has changed. Big hype ❤
2:26  Yesssss, I was hoping they'd do the usual Symbiote storyline where it makes Peter more aggressive. I can't wait to hear Yuri Lowenthal get to play a truly pissed off Peter Parker.  My ideal is that the storyline culminates in a boss fight where you have to control Miles to take Peter down.
Why is Miles bio electricity blue? 5:08
just please god they have to add a realistic swing option
Pete stopped pulling his punches. 👊🏾🕸️
Man they straight up threw Kojima's story out for this remake
Wraith was on kravens hunting list, Wraith is Yuri
Will be on PS4?
GOTY
Take my money
This Gameplay looks ridiculous and super action and fun
YOOOO MILES GOT THAT POWER
It’s voice of Sasuke in English?)
This looks AMAZING!! I can't wait!
Now, will everyone please shut the hell up about the lack of trailers and fear of game mechanics?😂
Miles is going to have to beat the black off of Pete
Ugh, another one? I mean, it's an okay game; though the concept is just getting old. Just like the Avengers game.
Game of the year 100%
TAKE MY MONEY INSOMNIAC
i've always loved peter more than miles
Wow thats so cool! I need to wait for pc launch :(
Bruh miles is turning into Batman 😂
The fact I can’t play this really bugs me, Xbox really starting to dissapoint
This game needs new counter animations. The gadgets should be more fluid In The combat.
reminds me of web of shadows it was soo good and this is just a masterpiece
YES the symbiote without any mods
Amazing!!!
🤯🤯🤯
"spiderman doesnt kill" Spider-man:...
So most of the footage was for Miles, but this is supposed to be the sequel to the first SM game, so are they gonna bait and switch? Why not be upfront about what it is?
Here’s my theory how peter got the symbiote. He probably went to connors house to investigate where he is.   Connors was a part of that cure that harry had and maybe had a sample of the symbiote  Peter was curious or knocked it over and the symbiote imprinted on him
5 years later and the water effects look worse somehow, C'MON, ARKHAM KNIGHT WAS THE BLUEPRINT
All I hear is Sasuke😭
Spider-Man is done with quipping guys, this is bad.
it's the best game ever just because insominac's efforts a huge round of applause for them 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
OH MY GOSH ITS ALMOST HERE
Spider-Man on his Sasuke timing and I’m loving it.
i cant breath omg
Astonishing fragment of gameplay, but Insomniac stole story arc from spiderman 3 video game (2007) have same situation symbiote  spiderman should save lizard from  kraven the hunter.
Yo might be GOTY
Now I really wanna play this game
Pete & Morales Super Duper Ultra Combo Power Move?!
Good to know that Miles’ bio electricity eradicates the symbiote, they really made it “subtle”…
The soundtrack and the sounds are amazing, I didn't notice how the clip came to an end - so addictive. Insomniac did their job at the highest level, I'm sure.
Always loved the Venom-Man. The aggressive brutality is the closest we ever get to Spider-Man no longer holding back. Like a super strength  Batman
The legacy Web of Shadows is alive...
12:05 my theory is because of the venom and they both fight at the end
I can see the 1v1 coming between the two
4:28 why the web lines can just be a natural web and not using tech, its more better imo.
1080p?
A wingsuit utility? Really? I hope that doesn't defeat the insensitive to web swing as much as it appeared to in that segment. Once deployed he cleared like 6 blocks rapidly without firing a single web :/
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 bravo I say again Bravo
All we what dreamed for came in just one video 🤩
This is so cool
i love the flying looks so cool
Love the Spider Man 3 movie game reference when Miles is riding on Lizard's back. It's as if the next gen of Spidey is riding the wave lol. Very excited
Now this, this is good! 🔥
1:30 The map doesn't seem to be limited to Manhattan 🎉
Dude i cannot undersand how peter gained the symbiote suit
Peak
I want old face in this game ❤
1 The symbiotic suit looks like... let's say the Guyver armor. And it's a little weird. 2 He does not stand on ceremony with women. 3 At 3:10 he makes a great scrambled egg. 4 We know that the symbiote can create endless webs. So why is he shooting pieces of... himself?
I suspect they did not fix Pete's face in this game and he still looks like the kid from the remaster.  this game really does not need this token called Miles Morales, nor his fat asian friend. no one cares for this character, yet they keep pushing him down our throats. and given any spider-man product makes money, disney and marvel keep deluding themselves into thinking people want to see Miles or any other spider-man wanna be who is not Peter.
I think Miles will play a very big role in getting rid of the symbiot . One of his powers are lightning ⚡️
Bully miguire is making a comeback 😂
Can't wait for the emo dance
I LOVE THE DARK WEB WHEN PETER SWINGS
this looks insane
Those venom animations are clean af
love this, the only downside in my opinion is the re-used animations for peter’s web swinging, but other than that this looks fantastic
I love the Anger in Peters voice, reminds me of the 90s cartoon when he got the symbiote.
This is the spider man ever
BRO THIS IS LITERALLY PEAK
11:57 he black man now
Best game ever.
I just love Ganke's little "ahhhh!" as his drone slams into the helicopter 😂 11:13
Miles morales is my favorite spider man  peter is trash. miles morales vs peter miles would win.
online co-op?👀👀
I’m shocked nobody else is talking about how the graphics look severely underwhelming. Get rid of the good looking lighting, and this looks like a game from 10 years ago.
This is literally my favorite game ever and this second one just furthers it😭😭😭
I don't think Pete's pulling his punches anymore.
What if we fight spiderman as miles 😱
OMG I cannot wait! This is for sure going to be GAME OF THE YEAR, I’m calling it.
There's no way it will look this good on release. Inb4 graphics downgrade
Y’all nerds
I didn’t think it was real🥹🥹🥹
I get now why it took so long for the gameplay reveal because of the villians, NYC, Venom Look Sick Btw! Can’t Wait For it
Kraven the Hunter ❤️
the best spiderman game ever cant wate
Yoooooooo
Amazing
Betcha this game will be one hell of a system memory hog. Not that I'll mind too much, this will be all I will be playing for a while.
among us is us btw this is FIYA
omg what the hell i want this in my pc... pls marver as soon this releases in consoles then try to release in pc as soon as you can.
big what?
Not sure how much I like the gliding thing. Sorta defeats the purpose of swinging, but I’m soooooooo excited for this!!!
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS GAME🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥     We’re getting out of NYC with this one 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥💯🤑💯
That ending part is setting up a Miles vs Peter fight and I love it
So cool to hear Spidey unleash his inner Sasuke
*Sees John Wick on the list.*  Kraven: Oh heck nah. I ain't going to hunt that prey.
Black suit looks awesome, hope they take some inspiration from Web of Shadows, since that game's black suit was perfect.
I think this is going to be better then Red dead redemption 2 story, whit better graphic and all i think this is one of the best games ever made by now
Se golpean mujeres en el jueg Que raro de Sony siendo tan progre 😅
goty candidate right here
I REALLY THINK THIS GAME WILL WIN GAME OF THE YEAR! I LOVE HOW THEY EXPANDED NEW YORK AND ALL VENOM IS GONNA BE BADASS! I DIDNT THINK LIZARD WOULD BE IN BUT MAN THIS GAME! I WANT TO PLAY NOW LOL
Can Not Wait
Man, Yuri Lowenthal was a fantastic choice for Peter. Especially his angry voice, it fits so well. (and reminds me a lot of his Simon role in Gurren Lagann too)
30fps😆😆😆😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
This is definitely going to be game of the year
This looks phenomenal
All I hear is Sasuke lmao
Lets go!
This game looks revolutionary. Spectacular Spider Man! 🕸️
This is going to be amazing
it seems that lizard will be in this game, sounds interesting
baawaal bajao gaane
NOT ME THINKING THE PROWLER WAS DEADPOOL 😭
4.2M views & it hasn't even been 24 hours yet. this is definitely what EVERYBODY been waiting on.
This game looks AMAZING!
Am I tripping or does the symbiot suit look not well rendered and the water is kinda iffy too
Wow!!! This brought a tear to my eye. This will be the best superhero game ever made. Mark my words.
This looks amazing... Can't wait to play it on my PlayStation 0
Finally a game where you can shoot a webline to walk on, and Spidey glides.
I love Spider-Man, but that sequence looked so boring. I hope the whole game isn’t on rails like that. Let me play the game, not just watch it.
Will this game be multiplayer?
I cannot wait for this game
Ngl, I kinda hope we keep the symbiote suit somehow
Is it a game or movie? Wtf
The web of shadows is back
opium
i swear to god, this is like the fourth time im watching this
I wouldn't be suprised if Peter got a sharingan eye
Let's be honest, that one guy who got bicycle kicked, his nuts are dead, he ain't having kids no more
gameplay/animations looks identical. swinging is gonna remain boring and simplistic
Venom is clearly Pete 😂😂
Absolutely can't wait
It's web of shadows all over again!
Surprised they revealed the black suit! Also shocked that they didn’t  make their own unique design as they did with the first game. But you can’t go wrong with the classic look especially when it’s fire 🔥. Anyway great gameplay I’m excited for the release.
With kraven being in this game and with his older age alongside Spiderman having the symbiote suite, this game could indeed tell the "Last Hunt" storyline 😮
The voice overacting reminds me of TASM Spidey vs Shocker
That should be "so have I!".  Please stop destroying the English language!!!
Im on a tight schedule right now. I only watched up until I saw the Venom suit gameplay and i was like “yup that’s enough I’ve already decided I’m gonna buy it”
At 1:28 Wraith is revealed!! Which confirms yuri will make a return in the new game
looks ok
Venom is a path to the darkside
Didnt realise Marvel bought Godzuki
Shut up and take my money! That's awesome
Symbiote Spider-Man vs Kraven the Hunter in defense of Lizard, who gets bigger. As someone who loves Spider-Man 3 the game I'm really happy with this idea being used again.  And tendrils combat is quite reminiscent of Web fo Shadows, with the kicks that are there in the DS WoS game. I'm actually pleased with that.
I am not a big fan of Miles Morales, but it is definitely an upgrade from MJ's "sTeAlTh" sections
Prototype X spiderman
When on PC? :)
Give us something on wolverine please
I can't wait for the new spider man game haven't had a symbiote of spider man since spider man shattered dimensions.
Is that sasukes voice actor?? From when he was a kid??
5:02 My boy miles learned that one from miguel o' hara
The fact that rather than taking care with civilians after saving them now peter just throws them to the ground
Anyone else curious on how the different suits will work in this game?
Hope Shocker’s in this do we can hear, “GET BACK HERE SHOCKEEERRR!!!”
Shut up and take my money!
Are water graphics real? I am sorry but the lag of the game while lizard jumps from the water was really bad. Also the graphics are not better than the first game. By using exactly same map and graphics your company released 3 games.  And I can not say that I liked flying that much. In my opinion spiderman shouldnt fly that much long and fast.
“he gotta away from us” do you think he was talking to miles or was he actually talking to the symbiote
meh
As much as I am thrilled by this gameplay, if Marvel Spider-Man 2 is a PS5 exclusive, I won't be playing it for many years. I have reached the point where my enthousiasm can simply not follow the economy.
Empty warehouse with a huge echo. And no one noticed miles kick and destroy a huge metal raptor?!?
This Kraven is amazing
The swing speed after switching to Miles looked great
Are we forgetting the addition of the most important character? QUEENS! Its finally a playable area in the game!
pc port please
I ain’t ever buying a ps5 again until they make a slim model
I love everything except the UI. It looks old and cluttered to me. Hopefully they clean it up a bit. Everything else looks incredible
Bro game has some crazy new features
Pete hasn't started saying "we" yet...looks like he's still somewhat in control. I'm betting he loses control and becomes Kravens dream hunt
lol another Spiderman game. towers of creativity these folks.  edit. lol just watched the trailer, Spiderman flies now I guess.
Whyyyy miles??? Urghhhh
another revamped trailer that won't be found 1 to 1 in the game
intense battles
The wait is so painful… especially painful since I have to wait for it to come out on PC
This game is going to be frickin’ awesome!!! 😊
Calling it now. They’re gonna make Kraven be Venom.
I don't think I'll be a huge fan of the gliding part since it will take away from the web slinging. But we'll see
need MORE venom, i hope we get to actually enjoy the darker side and delve into the Symbiote
Looks great, but I like the old Gui, and kinda dont want to play with raytacing
Atleast peter did the allie hoop in there and even tho he is in his venom suit he might be angry and violent and cutting miles but he still said somthin funny am i right😂😂😂😂😂
God please give me money to purchase a PS5 before this game drops
Reminds me a little of Prototype the way the black suit was fighting the hunters
So the suit they showed in the reveal trailer last year, I feel will be the new suit Peter makes after the symbiote leaves him
good game
Is this for real???
i will pay twice for this right now. Cannot wait any longer
I see Miles uncle 😀
My Favorite Part is when he says... "Kraven is going to wish he never came to New York!"
I think venom is gonna be a playable character, when he said to karvin yes we will in the trailer
I love that the tag line "Be Greater. Together" refers to both Miles and Peter but also Spider-Man and Venom. It's so clever
Hopefully we get to jump around as big venom!!!
The gameplay for this looks amazing and i love the design of the black suit it looks amazing 😎😎🖤🖤.
Edgy ultra agressive spiderman. I dig it.  Can't wait!
Gotta say Kraven looks almost like Bradley Cooper
Omg waited ages for this game and this made me more excited hats off to the devs making Peters personality change with the symbiote the graphics are amazing and from what it looks like great storyline thank you for such good games over the years keep it up
Cara esse jogo parece incrível pena que bo meu país o ps5 custa mais um rim
I'll make a prediction We will definitely see Miles fighting Peter, just hope that no one dies
Sick
There are fewer and fewer games, as time passes, that successfully capture our minds and hearts. It sometimes feels like the marvels are all part of the past, those moments when you were actually excited about a new game coming out. A new experience, in some way. But I actually feel that excitement when it comes to this one!
Giving some serious Web of Shadows vibes which I think was definitely the best PS2 era Spider-Man game. I don’t expect there to be branching paths like in that game but am excited to see just how much Peter gets changed by the suit.
Yeeeeeaaaahhh I’m getting a ps5 this year.
“Man this game so fire”  Lmao it’s the same game should’ve been dlc
The black suit is giving me Web of shadows and Shattered Dimensions vibes 🔥🔥🔥
Now we get Curse seal and Venom Sasuke
Looks sick
How can the gameplay be better than the movies?
Europe changed peter
Game of the year 🙆🏽‍♂️
Thats funny somone in the comments tell me shouldent peter have regeneration and Infinite webbing with the Black suit!?🤔
Kraven and lizard will get some dirt in their eye once they going to fight symbiote spiderman😂
This is the best playable Venom in any game since Web of Shadows.
Man the gameplay is so intense. Can't wait to play the game!
Love dynamic switching between two
I still love that Symbiote Peter is voiced by Sasuke :D
There s definitely going to be miles vs peter in this one im pretty sure
That villain was definitely supposed to be black! First minute in, dope
I hope you don't switch the whole game. Just go through each person's story, then do an end-game story.
This game looks so fire and you can see how peters changing I can’t wait for this to come out🔥
The psyche change in Peter's voice is being done so great by Yuri. I just don't like the venom suit design 🤷‍♂️
The way Pete simple threw to the floor that one civilian speaks a lot. I love how they are showing Pete's mood while using the black suit. Huge respect for the developers. The tone in his voice, his impatient behaviour... it's all perfect.
Love the detail about Harry. Hope we get to see some version of the Goblin in the game
Omg! Peter giving that Obito vibes with those arm extensions
Why does Peter have Venom?
Incredible
This looks so boring and repetitive.
I can't wait to see the different symbiot suits
Wish they start adding punisher, daredevil and blade in the game as well
Here’s hoping they changed Pete’s face back to what he originally looked like in the first game!
Never have I wanted to speed through summer so much in all my life 😂😄😩
The Kraven reveal at the beginning was epic.  I won't say how, or else it'll ruin it.
they're reallly about to get 3 for 3 rn im hoping this wont be like how the rest of the games are
Yo Lizard is in the game? Also this is absolutely awesome!!
Look very good! Like all the spider man games! It’s a must buy!🔥🔥🔥
Venom: I got big teeth too.
Take. My. Money.
Looks amazing, but those bad guys are the lamest antagonists i've seen in ages.. hope they're not the only ones...
Web of Shadows new age 👀👀
Shut up and take my money!!
Miles legit pulled a Hadouken, best game 2023
my spidy sens is telling me our peat is the bad guy here
Can’t wait for symbiote spiderman
I am so excited for this game
Miles is now superman 3:51
It's great and all but what's in it that can't be run on PS4? I read they said they're not going to release a PS4 version BECAUSE THEY WANT TO UTILISE THE POTENTIAL OF PS5
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
I like the game play but the story could be better.
Cool i feel Spider Man Web of Shadows Vibe😀😎👍🤟❤🕷🕸
look how far spider-man games have come, this is Incredible!!!
It would be cool if we had two customization options: one for the red suits and one for the black ones.
Man this was like a modern warfare action set piece 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now I want the PS5😂😂😂
Looks trash tbh
Похоже на Prototype
Miles morales can just fly huh? 😂 so stupid. God I hate they added him to this game just for "diversity"
he walks like he needs to use the restroom
Superb gameplay 🔥
THIS… THIS.. THIS!! Rocksteady, is how you do a gameplay reveal trailer..  After being so let down by suicide squad reveal, I’m so happy to actually be hyped about a game, and the best part, it actually looks fun to play… BRAVO Insomniac, I will be buying on day one 👏👏👏👏
Gonna love to see Cory play this for 4 episodes and then leave the game unfinished like he did with the first one 😊
idk about anyone else but the symbiote suit is giving me Prototype Alex Mercer vibes and I love it
Everything from 7:30 onwards - the music, the cinematic camera works, the action - is a masterpiece. This whole thing feels so intense it is arguably better than what we've seen in the movies.
amazing!
After 3 years, finally a reason to get a PS5  lol
11:55 I love the subtle detail of Peter's eye
I guess I'm the only one who thinks it's weird playing a male character that runs around and constantly beats the living crap out of women.  I feel bad for spidey's future wives in this case.
bro shocker is behind taskmaster
Can't wait to for the level where you play as emo Peter
It's really so good ❤
Can't wait to see their combos
Not gonna lie, I was expecting more. When Spider-Man was released on the PS4 in 2018 it was a huge step up for triple A super hero games. 5 years later it should have been another step up for gaming. This just seems underwhelming.
NAH MILES JUST UNLOCKED CHIDORI
It's 80% cutscenes and 20% actual Gameplay... Lots of animation work. It looks beautiful (if it was a movie)
I’ve already watched this 5 times
Excitement is the only word zo describe this. Awesome.
This looks amazing. Honestly, I can't freaking wait, and if hot toys make figures, I hope they kill it!!!
All i can do is watch
Is this...real? Please tell me it is  Also the way Peter threw that guy on the ground afyer saving him just shows how big an effect the symbiote has had on him
It’d be amazing to actually use the sym suit when this game comes out , so much to look forward to
Love this it looks perfect everyone did amazing with the designs and voice acting just waiting for the game release but what I am hoping for is when we change their suits that both spider men have symbiote suits and that their personality changes when they have the symbiote on and please don't let there be bugs when released
This Looks Amazing, The Creator Of This Part Has A Good Vision For This Game :) We are waiting...
I can't comprehend the exaggerated swagger of the black teen
God I love the suite. I love everything about this.
So, wheres the main theme that we shall dedicate our precious time to being consumed by?
Yeah Its Definitely Sasuke under that suit. And Im not just talking about the voice.
Hope this game gonna be on ps4 too,im really excited for this game!GamePlay Trailer Looking Awesome
As if Kraven the Hunter could take on Task Master 😂😂😂
So instead of improving the web-swinging, they just add in a new flight feature so Spider-Man doesn’t have to swing at all. Now that’s what I call lazy writing ✍️
We’re just getting one step closer to seeing Bully Maguire 😏
Cant wait
Wonder if Peter will be the actual Venom in this game. I’ve only seen him kill the Symbiote off only for It to survive and take a new host in other media. I’ve never seen him be fully corrupted in to the villain.
<<< Peter Uchiha
Is it for ps4 too?
I really hope they also add the black suit from Maguire!
Meow
It's cool that they made miles swing animation look like he's more experienced while keeping that exaggerated swagger of a black teen 😂
Stop just take my money already just take it😭😭😭💰💰💰
I JUST BEAT THE FIRST ONE FINALLY TOO OMG
Not Spider-Man gliding 🤦‍♂️
No way you’re all taking the symbiote spidey voice seriously that sounds so goofy
Symbiote suit texture needs a rework imo, everything else looks great
OMG👁️👄👁️
Oh my God the wingsuit man.
Am I the only one who got Batman Arkham vibes with the walking on webs and then the lizard chase similar to Arkham asylum, really just me
How did peter get venom
Hope it’s longer than like 4 hours story wise..
If this already looks Amazing, than wolverine must be god like aswell
YURI IS BACKKKKKK AS WRAITHHHH
Symbiote suit is stupid...
Major Prototype vibes in the Symbiote gameplay, just like I've always dreamed seeing the Symbiote playing
CHAN!
Perfect wat to celebrate my new Spider-Man tattoo 😁
Not for xbox 😢
Am I the only one that doesn't seem to be liking this gameplay?
I want to see some  bully Maguire moments of this Peter Parker 😂
hold it hold it the lizard is too big
Am I the only one who thinks Peter's symbiont costumo textures looks low resolution? Especially close to the eyes.
No way spidy beats kraven
Not for ps4?
as far as I understand, the ps5 is not capable of reproducing ps4-level graphics. And the "small" Insomniac studio cannot make a costume at the level of mods
I really don't hope Miles and Peter having a fight. It will break my heart
This gonna be a Masterpiece Game Of This yaer 2023🤩🤩🤩🤩
The ai kinda looks like garbage..   they just stand around without even flinching as everyone else gets attacked one by one… 🤦‍♂️ these games never change… for once I wish they’d stop focusing on the dam graphics because they think that’s going to draw people in.. when in reality it’s the actual gameplay/ game design/ ai fluidity/ storyline which keeps players invested years after it’s release
Ah yes, Spider-Man 2, the third in the trilogy
Yuri Lowenthal is killing it as Peter/Venom
great short film!
When does it come out
When Pete says he got big  teeth  🪥😁😁😁
Bro it's 2023, what's up with the video game quality? The quality looks worse than spider man 1? How are you downgrading in terms of quality when you're a multi-million dollar company?
It’s just like Spider-Man 3. At first, Peter picks up the symbiote, enhances his strength and aggression, then later it will turns into Venom.
The camera angles during in-game / gameplay fighting. WOW.
Bet Peter and Miles gonna have a face off
i hope it's not the same plot again where peter gets manipulated by the symbiote and him or his partners start crying about it and he get rid of it and then somehow eddie gets his hand on it because it seems like that is what gonna happen. it will be cool if peter manages to control the symbiote instead of it controlling him or something like that.
When’s preorder?
Is it me or Peter Parker, Sounds like Sasuke
I can’t wait for this game , the last part where miles goes he’s got teeth and Peter goes so do I … ace
12:04 i can already see the edits coming lol
dose peter have the same face of the first game?  hope they dont change him to tom holland or something 😃
This looks amazing but the UI could be better also this would also be an amazing multiplayer game
Bro I'm expecting a crazy showdown between miles and symbiote peter❤
Wow
So the world’s greatest hunter’s weapon of choice is… a team of mercenaries?
So fckng fantastik adorable
Guess I'm getting myself a PS5 this fall. Still need to play the first game!
I like how most comments here are from robots. I love how different they can seem.
Anyone else get a web of shadows vibe.
Of course miles is the REAL hero of the Spider-Man game. I mean why would anyone think Peter Parker would be….. fuxking stupid
Possible 4 - 5 months are you serious?? game looks ready to me. please please please release in June or something please.....
i really hope they update the grafics a bit, but the story and abilities seem amazing!
I'm honestly sad ppl don't realize that Wraith is going to be in this game. I was hyping hard once i noticed it cuz Yuri Watanabe turned into a killing vigilante in the last game's dlc. Imagine a showdown with Yuri vs Symbiote Spidey. He would be so angry and furious at her for betraying his trust like that in the last game's dlc. It would be AMAZING <3
Did you see Pete's eyes when he said "So do I". He looked like a mini venom
PS5 exclusive 😑
why is kraven hot
4.1M views, 16 hrs ago, 258K likes and 17K comments.
Nice to see Boozer again.
So he went from Ben 10 to Sasuke for real.
those are some serious prototype 2 vibes
Will the characters look even worse in this game than what they looked like in Miles Morales?
aburrido siempre lo mismo
The graphics
Can’t wait for this 💪🏾
looks pretty awesome tbh
Peter is exactly how I imagined Andrew Garfield's Spiderman would have become after losing Gwen. "I stopped pulling my punches. I got rageful. I got bitter. I don't want you to end up like...me." He would have given into a symbiote.
Pete is very creepy now
This looks like a great movie. Hope it comes in at a reasonable runtime.
I got miles morales nd never played the game at all
They just made the game 100x times cooler🔥🔥🔥
Man, the Kraven scene was just awesome, and the sym spidey animations are just stellar!
I have a feeling peter will start to get aggressive as the game progresses
O Helll yeahhhhh
God this game looking perfect
👏👏👏👏👏👏
nice to see that the slingshot got added and the glider
That symbiote suit is sick as hell!
My favorite version of Spider-Man man o man do I gota play this game I’ve never played a spider man game before so I hope to enjoy this like I did the Spider-Man movie series
The symbiote is starting to take effect.
Will this be on ps4
please release on ps4 game
WOOOOOO I love kraven, can't wait for him to be a central part of a game for once
Its really cool to see a Venom arc with Miles as well, since IIRC, Venom is normally in Peter's standalone storylines. It'll be really cool to see how Miles's perception of Peter as a mentor changes, and I imagine there's probably going to be some paralells to Peter's relationship with Doc Ock
Now if only I didn't have to wait two years to play it on PC.....
Can’t believe Xbox bricked
All I hear is sasuke
Considering my lack of skill these actions sequences make me cringe
Awesome ❤
Miles morales had a lot of cool new bells and whistles, but lacked length. I hope this game can accomplish both. It seems promising and legit will be the reason I upgrade to ps5.
Bully Maguire vibe...check!
Can we play this game in android phone or not
Mega Prototype vibes 🥹
Okay im hipped up
Everyone who was bitching it’s taking too long to release something well they heard you
Another Sony movie game where you watch the game play itself. Bravo!
Evil Peter sounds like MatPat
nnot sure how i feel about the ui
This is supposed to be a ps5 exclusive ? Doesn't look it. Skin texture, hair and fur rendering doesn't look any better. NPC's look about the same level of rendering and the water in Uncharted 3 on a ps3 game looks better. The walking animations still have that weird sliding effect. I am really disappointed. I can't see prominent visual or technical improvements. Except for miles swinging sequence where the SSD helps pace through the city faster and smoother. The initial reveal of the first game looked better in my opinion
Peak
Do we know when this is coming out for ps4 ?
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A VENOM SPIDERMAN BOSS FIGHT LESS GOOO
Mira lo que se ve ese juegazo papaaaa
@ 3:40. LOL!...thats supposed to be a slingshot??
i like how in every spider man game it starts of with you running/chasing someone or something have you noticed that for example miles and peter chasing rhino venom(spider man) chasing lizard
I can’t wait to play this game
If Peter doesn’t say “Now Dig on this” while wearing the black suit then I’m not buying it
I had forgotten Kraven was even in this. It really sucks that they didn't just focus on the Symbiote/Venom storyline. Doing both at the same time seems like it will be a disservice
This looks insane!
Peters voice has gone deeper to. He even cut Miles off in the middle of his sentence! Shows how Peter is going down the dark path already. If you look closely you see Yuri Watanabe as Wraith on the datapad in the beginning. 3:48 And Miles had Web-Wings!  Edit: I also love how you can go to Queens instead of only swing in NYC.
One of the best I have ever seen❤
i hope it has an online multiplayer
Can't wait for Yuri Lowenthal to go full Sasuke for symbiot Spider-Man
4:59  Villain: “Watch out for his new powers” Miles: *Procedes to hadouken bad guy*
This is amazing!
Can’t believe this is #1 on trending 😮
"That ally oop on 3" part got me.
YEaaaaaAAAAAAA
This sequel is ambitious, bigger and they’re attentive to every detail. Even how the symbiote is slowly changing Peter and his demeanor, personality and Miles being able to pick up on Peter’s differences and the overall design of the suit, this whole game is going to be insane and amazingly made and I’m here for it.
I don’t even own a ps5 🥲
looks pretty good over all ,
Deadpool 🤔
does this mean that tom hardy eddie brock is the only one not going mad cause of venom? the original eddie brock went mad too.
He's never like that!😮😮
and now miles is some how a better spider man than spider man SMH .
Finally queens
WOW !
Sasuke + Symbiote Pete = Same Person
Will it be on pc on release?
I'm getting "Spiderman 3 2007" game vibes.
The graphics looks like 20 years old, where nextgen?!
bro am speachless
😍😍😍
i love the symbiote , it looks alien , i love how the eyes look alot like the greys , more oval and big .
Oh yeah~~~~~~that's VENOM !!!!!!!!!!!🖤🖤🖤
Can't wait.
i need this on ps4
We all know who the antagonist of this game is right? They are trying so hard to make kraven seem scary but he's b tier at best. Venom is clearly the baddie.   Can't wait to see Miles face off against Peter.
I hope Peters face doesn’t look like a twink this time
Spiderman in the jungle would be cool.
I think this will be the darkest Spider-Man game ever. Peter sounds so menacing he’s not playing around this time. That “ I got big teeth too “ could be hinting that Venom is gonna be playable. We’re in for some surprises!
hiiiiiiiii cant wait to play this with my dad
we need a Bully Maguire dance scene
They turned Miles Morales into Raiden idk how to feel about that
The fact that we have venom , kraven , the lizard and maybe green goblin?  The line up is gonna be amazing
2:26 2:44 3:10 3:41 3:51 9:00 .
I love how you can hear the distortion in Peters voice while in the symbiote suit.
HOW TO ORDER PLEASE
*bully maguire theme intensifies*
why does miles have like elctro powers now lmao , its supposed to be just a shock on contact right ? i get it different realities lol
Venom, Kraven and Lizard this is gonna be sick!
Oh…my….god….
Yuri soundin a loooooot like Sasuke right now lol
I played both of the other ones so far this looks good hopefully the story is long like the first one and they have a lot of dlcs
Isn't it the same game but with number two in name? Looks same, why should it be something special?
I hope Peter isnt wearing the symbiote suit for the hole game it looks fire tho 🔥
Ngl they should add a 2 player mode for this game
11.33 throwing it on the ground after saving it well I guess it made venom
What a freaking cool gameplay 🔥 Im totally speechless by this 12 minutes. So just imagine how epic this game will be. I already found it masterpiece in 12 minutes. Forget mcu, sony. Isomaniac is totally killing in spiderman 🔥🔥💖
THEE FLIGHT SUITS.
"You've grown slow in your old age, Sergei" "A fate you will not share" Cold af
Wow not even half way the though and impressed 👍🏾 good job ,👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Its gonna be a lot of fun watching people play this because buying a PC that will run this even on minimum settings will set you back at least $3000
Guys, they gave this game the Destiny 2 shadowkeep horns.
Spiderman is Sasuke confirmed
Reminds me of Web of Shadows but better 😍😍😍
I havent played the first one, so im a bit jarred. Did you get the symbiote suit in that game? Or is that a new plot point?
That symbiote suit looks...not great. Like a Kai's Power Tools effect circa '99. Grimdark Pete is humorous at least.
Amazing
I’m tryna buy this today
Not a fan of the symbiote suit design. Looks like sportswear.
WTF?! What's with the graphics?! Why is it worse than the first part?! Why is the interface at the level of mobile games?! What's with Peter's Costume?! Why does everything look so bad?! Why should it be shown at the presentation also from a large angle?! I hope that this will be fixed by the exit!
ive always hated how miles is just called spider man , lmao why not come up with a cooler spider themed name lol
Looks pretty awesome!
Is it normal the enemies are only watching their friends being beaten by Spider venom? LOL
"THIS IS CINEMA!"
You must know when a video hits 4 million in less then a day it’s gonna be good
Looks amazing!
Amazing
Kravan ❤️❤️❤️
the symbiote suit on spiderman looks awesome
🔥🔥mai ek You Tuber hu 🔥🔥 Apka Video ka bahjar se mera kus paida hoga🔥🔥 nice Video
I like everything but the musculature of the symbiote suit. I hope you can get alternate black suits as well so I can look like secret wars black spidey or something.
🔥🔥mai ek You Tuber hu 🔥🔥 Apka Video ka bahjar se mera kus paida hoga🔥🔥 nice Video
🔥🔥mai ek You Tuber hu 🔥🔥 Apka Video ka bahjar se mera kus paida hoga🔥🔥 nice Video

The Lizard Setpiece feels like a taste of the grand scale encounters we'll have with other villains.  Cannot wait to see what they do with Mysterio and Sandman
The way spider man looks with venom Fire
🔥🔥mai ek You Tuber hu 🔥🔥 Apka Video ka bahjar se mera kus paida hoga🔥🔥 nice Video
🔥🔥mai ek You Tuber hu 🔥🔥 Apka Video ka bahjar se mera kus paida hoga🔥🔥 nice Video
🔥🔥mai ek You Tuber hu 🔥🔥 Apka Video ka bahjar se mera kus paida hoga🔥🔥 nice Video
Love the aggression Yuri Lowenthal brought to Peter this time around. Serious credit to his performance. You can really hear how the symbiote has begun to cause his personality to change.
4:00 😮😮
🔥🔥mai ek You Tuber hu 🔥🔥 Apka Video ka bahjar se mera kus paida hoga🔥🔥 nice Video
Metal gear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Will this game be available on PS4😭😭
🔥🔥mai ek You Tuber hu 🔥🔥 Apka Video ka bahjar se mera kus paida hoga🔥🔥 nice Video

Sasuke your hate is still too weak.
🔥🔥mai ek You Tuber hu 🔥🔥 Apka Video ka bahjar se mera kus paida hoga🔥🔥 nice Video
I think a new trailer was released 😅
Broooo I love the how smooth these new mechanics look and work! I’ve watched the gameplay of that black symbiote suit on REPEAT
His voice sounds like sasuke's from english naruto dub :D
11:31 no chill with the landing xD
Марвел это не ваша игра а Сони, ваш Человек-паук Тома Холанда мусор полный, у вас никогда не будет смелости создать серьёзную, трогательную, эмоциональную и увлекательную историю с крутым экшеном. Кевин Файги не профессионал своего дела а просто снимает шлак и все хвалят потому что не у кого нету прав снять кино лучше кроме Диснея десткого мышенка лгбт.
I am loving this so far!
1:33 Is the villain in the way back Otto but then it flashes into Fisk??
That was pretty cool.
Does that mean in the end symbiote merge with kraven and peter and miles fight him
Just a lil bit of wii sports resort wake boarding at 10:00
1:55 I felt like I was getting serious “predator” vibes with the hunting and trying to fight the toughest thing - game looks great though
arkham knight 8 years later
Don’t like them using the new movie-style super-liquidy symbiot. He’s not fkin Carnage. Dunno why they can’t just stick to the original comics—guess they figured if they didn’t read em nobody did. Also I’m not a fan of Spider-Man having  a concrete sidekick. I get why they did it, they already established miles and they want someone to witness his change, but they coulda just used MJ or Human Torch to stay more inline with the story’s origin.
Uff
Why do I get the feeling that Peter is chasing Connors to save Harry??
this looks so cheap
It will be Spiderman vs Spiderman at the end, i can feel it hahah
Dood the facial movements are very smooth!
Egozr mobe atopr kms pill
Looks like an 2014 gameplay .. no graphics .. NPC have do reaction 👎👎👎👎
Can’t wait to get this spider man on my ps5
niceee
will it be coming to steam ?
Change everything ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Don’t you get tired of always the same game mechanics?
Literally praying that we get a playable venom like in ultimate spider man
Catch me up, why is miles in this?
Really wishing I didn’t give my PS4 to my little sister
Kinda funny & sad at the same time that this game has a better script than half the Marvel movies coming out. And for me it's better cause you get to be a part of it, in the thick of it, vs just watching it for 3 hours.   To the team responsible for this game, pat yourselves on the back. You definitely deserve the credit. Yall earned it.
Shoutout Astoria finally my hometown is in a Spiderman game!!!!
Oh I am SOOOO ready for this!
This is my favorite villain
they always do the same. They show you the most spectacular mission but 99% of the game is repetitive.
Symbiote suit looks dope af. It looks organic and alive as it should be.
Peters voice is so nice. Like of course the venom suit doesn't immediately change his behavior but its slowly doing it. Every breath he took was shrouded in the slightest bit of annoyance and anger. This game looks SO good ho my lord.
i can sense bully maguire in this version of peter
F U Sony for only bring it to PS5
Can we just appreciate how well the swinging is done? Each game is such an improvement on the swinging and the development of the character. Miles is so gracious and afloat with every swing he makes! Love it!  I can tell this is going to be a  huge Playstation Hit!
WOAH
This is what the PS5 is capable of. Amazing gameplay, super amazing graphics, and so many other things were clearly expressed through these eleven minutes. This honestly looks super great. If only I had a PS5...  I just hope they optimize this game well. Most mediocre triple A games take up way too much storage. I hope they are able to have enough time to optimize this game well, just like Nintendo does with their games.
I just love bro I hope that I could be as big as an artist one day 💜
Miles morales say “it’s good” like he from the bay lol
oh my god Kraven looks so GOOOOOOOOOOOD
It looks Dope❤❤ Ayoo The person who is playing KRAVEN here Is the same who played ANGELO BRONTE in Red dead redemption 2❤❤❤
Love it what a strong start to the gameplay.   I would've loved a little detail on the personality take over when Miles said "But he's got big teeth" and Peter replied with "So do we." Miles would be confused if he meant him as well.
That symbiot suit looks amazing
It’s giving curse seal sasuke
You can’t be having the same 3 swinging animations . Modders added a bunch in a week, ain’t no way they used the same stuff 0 tweaks
3:10 it’s like the beat down combo from the Arkham games but kicking
We all really need Gta 6
I hope this game will be insane amazing suit and great gameplay ❤
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL AND I LOVE HOW THEY MADE THE BLACK SUIT 😍❤️
Insomniac are geniuses, they know exactly what they’re doing 💯
I'm totally, completely, out of the loop, how are Mile and Peter both spiderman at the same time here?
It's like I don't like the texture of the suit but it looks exactly how I would imagine an alien suit would look
THIS LOOKS SO GOOOOOD
i can't wait for peter screaming SHOCKEEEEEER while chasing him
Ps4 please 😢
They made peter a whole demon
At first sight, the graphics actually don't look much better than they did on the ps4.
Looks incredible and to have both Miles and Peter as playable characters is going to be amazing. I’m no longer a massive gamer but games like this make me start playing. Loved the past two Spiderman games.
"Peter! Allyoop?" "Fine!"
I love how the enemy never considers looking up in a massive warehouse for SPIDERman😂
I assume kraven will have those side bases we need to take out throughout the story similar to sable and roxxon
This game was gonna be a must play anyway but now I'm *so* excited
I hope you can turn off the wingsuit.
I’m loving this shii finally Peter using the symbiote  full power and his attitude it’s all beautiful I gotta get this game hope it comes too pc
Looks like a short film.
excited
Miles gonna have to fight Peter I’m calling it but don’t rlly know if that would go well while he has the venom Symbiot on
The quick time events are backkk.... Time to switch off my brain again.
This looks insane 🔥
i love him🕷
They did not disappoint!!!  👊👊👊  By the looks of things, I’m more than happy to wait. 🤣🤣👍👍👍🤞🤞🤞
he thought to be connor when he tasted the blood
Is the symbiote VA the same VA as Sasuke?
Looks good but if it's coming fall 2023 when is it coming to PC? Fall the year after or further on? I wish they would start telling us.  With Miles Morales game I just watched it played through on youtube, I never played it even when it came out because I had already seen the story through. So they lost a potential sale from me. If they told me WHEN it was coming out I could decide if I want to wait or not.
How does Spiderman swim without waterboarding himself?
muy bonito se ven juego❤ esperal
I can hear sasuke uchiha's voice in symbiote
Ohohohoho YES PLEASE!
Symbiote - check Giant Lizard - check Anger issues - check  Why do I get the vibes of Spider-Man 3 Video Game but better?
3 minutes in to this video and it already looks like the greatest spider man game of all time
90% sure at some point we'll fight symbiote Peter as Miles. If they haven't done that, I'm gonna be real upset.
I like how the symbiote looks but everything feels way too on the nose
It is giving the vibe or prototype ❤
Is it a prototype 3?
Man if they’ll gonna do a Bully Macquire’s reference, it will be so awesome!
Yuri lowenthal (I think that’s his name) is absolutely nailing the angrier symbiote Peter, adding another layer of depth to his already fantastic previous performance. He is quickly becoming the Kevin Conroy of Spider man in my mind, hope he gets used for other animated projects.
Guess i have to get a PS5 now…
4:30 did they just make a mod for spiderman 1 a feature?!
Looks like a great game!
The guy from fortnite
Very promising. Now let’s hope they put effort in the optimation
you are probably gonna have to fight Symbiote Peter as Miles. i would absolutely love that
WAIT WHAAAAAAT:D
Im excited to see how this plays out full game
got an Prototyp (game) vibe from the first minute into the gameplay.
3 words " WHAT ABOUT PC"
I feel like spider man is just like batman buy evil 😈
You can tell how aggressive Peter is because of the symboite
When Pete is angry all I hear is "Sasuke" lol (same voice actor)
The movement on some of the animations look a little stiff. I understand they have their suits on but their body motions should still look natural to some degree. Other than that though, I’m really looking forward to this.
It looks amazing 👏 😍
Prototype 3
SASUKE!
Yoo I didn't know we were getting prototype 3
If it’s in queens they better have an action Bronson cameo
They really added Spider-Cop's voice to the game
crying so hard rn
Nah bro, now that's truly the best Spider-Man game in history
mehhhhh, looks just like the first one just with symbiote spider-man. The symbiote looks nothing as fun as Ultimate Spider-man or Web of Shadows
3:10 siblings pulling out this illegal move in play fighting.
They fr turned Peter into Alex mercer
the symbiote tenticles look too fat imo, really makes it look badly designed.
Why does Ganke look like a fat lesbian?
Woahhhhh😍😍
So they're doing their own take of the symbiote story line somewhat in tone with the Ultimate version of the suit, Kraven's Last Hunt plus their own original with Miles, Connors and the Harry Osborn disease from the 1st game ending, not to mention a possible free roam in Queens since OG Ultimate Spider-Man? Nice
Bammm bamm boooom
Lizard looks amazing
I like the character toggle (originally from GTA)
FINALLY WE GOT KRAVEN!11!1!1!
So kraven the hunter hunts for fun ? No motive? Lol
Why this video is not in 4k?
This Looks so amazing Can't wait I love Peters suit and his Presonality change cuz of the suit
Man I need more info, and where on earth did the Symbiote come from
Peter is scary when he's angry. Miles is in for the fight of his life
KRAVEN AAAAAAAAAAAA
Game literally looks the same as the last with new action sequences. It’s no wonder why it came out so quick. Nothing really “game changing.”
👏 👏 👏
New areas look Amazing and the set pieces Spectacular, I think my only 2 issues with this are the combat looks a little less fist fighting and even more gadgety (altho that might be because its a showcase) and the new IU looks a bit messy and cluttered compared to the clean one from 2018. Other than that this looks to be the Ultimate Spider man game thus far
until 2:35  i thought new movie and didn't even read the title lol
Sasuke Uchiha inside Peter Parker 😂
I thought I click on the wrong video when I watching the beginning, I thought it's MGS3 remake trailer
I love how Pete is not only bantering less with Miles but he’s also less “quippy” and genuinely threatening when he fights enemies. It shows the effects of the Venom suit on his psyche.
7:57 Ironic
I really want to play this game but my pc wont let me
Game of the year
Es hermoso
thank you
2:19 just sweeping while a 4x4 drive by and destroys the fence 😂
LOVE IT
Prototype is such a good game
Guess I'm breaking and buying a PS5...
In combat, Miles’ venom is blue but in the cutscene its yellow/orange. Anyone got an explanation?
This kinda looks the same from last time around, can't wait for the same 5 activities to do around the dead city
LOVE IT! Take my money NOW!!
Yes
Finally mazaa ayega ❤❤ 1:20
When in fact this is the spiritual successor to Arkham City
Its beautiful. I looked at this for 10 hours now
Ima buy soon it comes
I love how this game is called Spider-Man 2 and we get to play as 2 Spider-Mans
I love how pissed off Peter sounds in this.
The greatest reveal trailer that I’ve ever personally seen since the first Spider-Man game. 🔥🔥🔥
Crazy theory: But what if the final boss is infected Peter vs Miles? We see how Peter has changed his attitude about things whilst Miles is still the same and is confused on why Peter is so edgy. And for the end card we see Spidey's chest and then a symbiote trying to take over, but then it gets shocked, presumably by Miles' venom. Maybe this signifies how Miles will try to prevent the symbiote from taking over Peter through out the game and will eventually have to fight him to get him back to his senses. The final-final boss could still be just Venom, but there will probably be 3-4 phases: (1st) Symbiote edgelord Spiderman, (2nd) Symbiote Spiderman but this time Peter is trying his best to get out of the suit and Miles realizes Peter is getting controlled and doing it against his will, (3rd) Peter finally gets out and him and Miles fight Venom, and if that isn't the last phase Venom will probably turn into some Kaiju-type thing and start destroying things.
They had to bring back the symbiot because without it Miles outclasses Peter by so much in powers now, Using him in the game would be counter intuitive.
Miles: Pete, you need to take that thing off, you’re not acting like yourself   Peters Honest reaction:
fighissimo anche se potevano tenere la texture della skin del simbionte un po piu compatta e non come se fosse un armatura
as an old school petey fan im all for miles and double excited to see the symbiote. Good times with this one. Excelsior!
Insomnia games is giving Peter 1000 times more love than the comics has EVER done. Marvel Comics… takes some notes🔥🙏🔥
I was here before release
I'm just glad the slingshot has made a comeback !
The knife at 0:44 looks like leon s knife from resident evil 4 remake coud this be a reeferencs?
Didnt think Id see Peter actually FIGHT with the symbiotes Tentacles
This is gonna be a Fantastic game
Please have a scene where peter chases shocker up a bell tower and screams at him maniacally
Not a fan of how tha black suit looks
Peter sounds like sasuke
WEB WIIIIIIIIINGS why is that the thing I’m most excited by
Pretty sure this game came out when the PS5 was launched. Sony’s one big exclusive to try and get sales when all the loyalist fans tried moved to next gen rather than get an Xbox, as they feared losing their precious trophies and game library  Literally the only reason people do not switch consoles. Hence why the console ‘war’ was won generations ago and will always be the case. Microsoft improve and Sony cry and get legal involved to block their right to buy things. Pathetic. They know they are inferior and terrified. Things just need to know then their time is up. Time to exit the gaming market, Sony.  God of War was bad. Hack and slash repetition. Last of US was shocking and overrated too. PS fanboys defend it though as they HAVE to. PS can spit anything out and they’ll rate it 9/10 minimum due to biases. I know people that don’t have the games and still say “yeah derp 10/10 miles better than Xbox derp”. Dumbasses
...btw for those that haven't noticed...when peter fights with venom... did y'all notice that he is breaking bones every single time he slams someone, also theory, Mile's Bioelectricity is now blue and not orange because he sucked in all that new form in the last fight in his own game, changing the way his biology works and making his electricity 🔵
I dont like the new venom colors for miles. It shoupd go back to yellow
hey look, prototype
Broo stop saying I love this that 😭😭😭
First two minutes has my skin crawling, this might be an awsome game!
So cool
Peter Parker Spiderman for final villain
Welp… safe to say no co op lol
Did anyone else feel that the symbiote movement was like the aliens from Edge of Tomorrow?
I just love the design of the symbiote suit.
Spiderman practicing gender equality 02:55
Thank you Insomniac
1:28 YESSS, I KNEW IT
Why does spider sound like Sasuke 😂
This looks so good unfortunately I do not have a ps5 lol
Honestly the worst thing about spiderman Is that I cant play on xbox
I cant say nothing then absolute big W. Symbiote spiderman skins in games, yea but have here you got literally symbiotes abilities. Also voice actors did very good job!
This game is looking dope af
I wonder if the symbiotes weakness will either be fire and sound like in the main 616 universe, or high voltage electrciity like in the ultimate universe. Because in the end at the "Be Greater, Together" line the symbiote was disintegrated by I'm assuming Miles bio-electricity.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ can’t wait
i gonna cry, OH MY GOOOOOO
IS IT REALLY THAT HARD to do Marvel Avengers like this!!???? This is a Masterpiece already!! 👏
This game is gonna be awesome
This is forcing me to buy a PS5
Peter's black suit voice really makes him sound like he's gonna chase Shocker to the ends of the Earth! 😂
Tayca var Türkçe yok amk
So.. is this based on Krave's last hunt?
Time to replay the first oneee
atleast we get more than one good game in 2023
The lizard is giving leatherhead from tmnt 💯
This reminds me an old game called Prototype
They finna make me buy a ps5 only to play this game, same way I did with spider man for the PS4
Absolute Masterpiece
I want to play right now freaking game 😆
Game of the year easy
sasuke voice actor for peter venom crazyyyyyy
Set pieces are cool but I hope the overworld has nore to do in it
I really like the upping of tension on all aspects. The amount of new big things and addition really make that "2" in the title worth it.
Use chidori!
Wait... I have a feeling that with Peter or Kraven will become Venom in this, not Harry or Eddie. And I wonder if Green Goblin will be in this? 🤔
Looks just as mediocre as the last one 😂
Love it when miles morales said HADOKEEEEN
😂😂😢😢😮😮
5:00 miles does the into the spiderverse racially motived slam
Wow! it’s Prototype 3?))
Jogo parece estar divertido.
Same here kid, same here. 07:57
Can’t stand miles voice and why isnt he just calling him Peter
The fact that they showed lizard, kraven and symbiot suit in a gameplay trailer tells you that this game has so much more to offer.
Something really cool during the title card. When it says "Be Greater. Together" the together is covered up by the symbiote for a moment before Miles' electricity blasts it away. Probably a subtle way of showing that there will be a Miles Morales vs Symbiote Spider-man boss fight.  I am reading too much into this?  Maybe...
Saying I’m hyped for this game is an understatement. To have the ability to switch back and forth between Peter and Miles adds a whole new element to the game that makes it that much more fun and interesting. I can’t wait to play this!
5:00 Kamehame ... HAAA!!!
I seriously dont like the graphics of the game whatsoever, I mean its childish, make it look more realistic
Seems like it’ll lead to a Miles vs Peter fight to get the black suit off Miles electric powers may come into play here very curious how they bring in Venom and more importantly who will be Venom I’m betting Harry unless they introduce Eddie  Also Lizard 🦎 hell yeah
Amazing
I don’t want to wait years for a remastered
Sasuke as Spider-Man? I’m down
This is definitely going to be an interesting take on Peter's Venom arc. Miles being there for it adds a whole new layer of potentials. And I absolutely love how seemless the transitions between the Spiders is during the gameplay showcase.
Is this just PS5 because I’m on PC.
Goosebumps 6:43
Change the symbiote suit, PLSSSS!!!!!
Idk why bit the graphics look worse than the last one to me?
I wonder if you can open doors in this game without ripping them off
Bro that is not a reveal that is a leak
Insomniac delivered, again!!!
I hope peter get more swing tricks. The game looks absolutely amazing
Very cool, now make Miles' venom strike yellow again
Absolute must buy game for me.  Loved the first game and Miles Morales was a really solid spinoff too.  Just seeing the trailer is making me want to jump back into the game and swing around for a while.  Love the symbiote suit with it's cool abilities and it's effects on Peter.  Can't wait to play it this year and I really can't wait to see the Wolverine game next.
Please just bring it to ps4 you will definitely have more buyers
I'm really excited for Spider-Man 2 because of the combination of combat and story overall
All these “I love “ bots
Petition for Kraven in Spider-man 4? He needs to be in a movie.
Pc release when?
I hope he doesnt go back to red and blue so soon but instead turns into this universe version of venom, before the symbiote moved to eddie brock or whoever at the end where Peter and miles have to fight him as the final boss
HOLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I love how these Spider-Man games are just as highly anticipated as the movies. Like events, all to follow the overarching narrative happening. Good work Insomniac.
The checks in the mail baby
I cant wait to play this on PC ❤😊
Spiderman practicing gender equality 02:55
That's what I'm waiting for....
im hyped even tho I havent played the first 2 games
5:00 Miles really just fires Kamehamehas now
The water doesnt look good tbh, but its gonna come up at the fall of the year, so i hope they gon fix the graphics. But the swinging look litt asf
I'm calling it now. Black-suit Peter is gonna be one heck of a boss to beat ♥♥♥.
Spiderman killing people 😮
I love Yuri Lowenthal but I have to point this out. Pete in Symbiote mode, sounds like Sasuke Uchiha. Though to be fair if there was ever a time for that
Graphics looks amazing!!!
Wow
Most likely a fight between Peter and Mike’s at some point that’s gonna be awesome
Pls Lunch on ps4
i think the animation quality could improve especially the normal people
If you look to Peter's Symbiote Lenses you can see some kind of small wave on them... referencing to the fact that it's alive.....and also did miles freaking teleported??!
00:52 Angelo Bronte when dutch kidnapped him be like:  (pathetic)
I love ow at the end when he says he has bigger teeth u can see his lens shape change to look a little more like venom the attention to detail in this game is so magnificent
i hope it’s on ps4 to y
I really hope they go back to the original Peter design in this game, and not the Tom Holland look. No hate on Tom, but it's supposed to be a seasoned Peter who has been spiderman for like a decade. Don't have him look like a teenager!
This looks AMAZING. The character reflections here with Peter acting edgy with the symbiote is perfectly executed. Hats off to the dev team
Prototype 2 remake looks sick 🔥🔥
3:16 prototype vibes
Wait how come miles is not affected by the symbiote?
2:55 to 3:20 cooler than any combat I've seen in the other games combined. I love how he interacts with the houses with his attacks. This game looks like it will be a lot of fun.
For the longest time Spiderman was the only white male superhero allowed to exist in his own media by himself without having his superior diversity doppelganger share the spot light evenly. Now I guess even Sony let their property fall to social Marxism.   Name any white male marvel character who has a show or even a modern game where he doesn't have a superior diversity clone? This only happens with white male characters. Ms Marvel didn't have a male character with her identical powers set to replace her. Hawkeye, Thor, Dardevil, Black panther, Captain America, Ironman, Dr strange has his replacement ready scarlet witch but his diversity character that had to get equal screentime and was the actual hero of his show was America Chavez.  Only female characters in modern marvel are allowed to exist on their own in their own show without having a male character who's equal or superior to them share the exact same amount of screentime. Some seriously sexist racist crap
Oh God This Symbiote Suit Looks So Clean. And The New Combat And GLIDING?! They Have Already Surpassed The Last 2 Games!!
love the new symbiote suit
omg
So nothing changed?
So much advancement in Visual fidelity and water simulations still looks hand painted. Kills the immersive effect!
Why are the graphics so shitty. Oh wait it’s designed for next gen ps.
Great game sucks I’m on Xbox but also it’s funny how miles said they got there fast I’m thinking they are there fighting already and he’s about to bust through the window but he got there before they did 😂idk I just found that funny
" So do I "
Still wish it would release on ps4
COME BACK HERE, KRAVEN! KRAVEEEEEEEEEN! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME, I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE END OF THE WOOOORLD!  love everything about this gameplay reveal, hyped for the game and every asspect of it.
The Reptile slinks… The Hunter stalks…… The Symbiote awakens……… 🕸️
ZzzZzz
Honestly, I kind of hope the game gets delayed, to give time for the developers to make the game better and to give me time to get a PS5, because I only got to play the PC ports of both the previous masterpieces, since I just have a Nintendo Switch. So, yeah, I want a PS5 just to play this game, and if the game comes out before then, I fear I’ll get too impatient and spoil too much from looking at playthroughs...
Well, Sony never learn
yessssssssss
One question tho, why did Miles have Blue Electricity in his first fight and Yellow Electricity in that last bit? Are they two different powers?
Haven’t seen anyone else comment this, is venoms voice the same as trunks in the English dub lol
The sound design in this game is top tier!!!!
Gameplay trailers should always be little to no commentary. This is a marvelous trailer.
Peter could kill Kraven with the chidori
Pete's personality change with the symbiote is interesting.
I feel like it’s too basic for them to have it be Peter v Miles, I think the suit will get to Miles somehow, and Peter will have to snap him out of it, THEN it’s Venom V Peter and Miles.  I’m not sure if Miles new abilities would give the suit even more enhancements? Imagine an invisible Venom lmao
did Miles just do the Kamehameha at 05:00 ?? Awesome!
Prototype is that you!?!!?
❤❤❤❤❤
spider man vs spider man boss fight maybe?
2:27 bet my soul this is gonna be the "most replayed" part
0:14 bro is a absolute unit
I really hope we get a fight between Peter and Miles that ends with Miles separating Peter from the Symbiote
So all the people commenting here have a PlayStation 5,i guess i will miss this because i have ps4😢
I really hope we get a PS4 Release
Wait is this the opening mission? Like with how they showed of Marvels Spiderman and Miles Morales? Wtf if this is setting the tone, I am ALL for it
11:35 Cool little detail but when Peter said “he got away from us” he def was not saying “us” as in him and miles.
The burning question everyone isn't asking: Which character model of Peter will we get?  PS4 or PS5?
xbox players kicking themselves right now
the gliding alone sold me
In the final quote “be greater. Together” the symbiote tries to cover the word together but then an electric shock repels it. I think this is clearly gonna be miles trying to fight Peter to get back to his normal self
First impressions (I’m not fully through the trailer) I like how Connor, venom and Kraven are all coherently added to the same story without just being “everyone hates Spider-Man”
I’m predicting miles vs Peter: Peter goes crazy he’s bout to kill kraven miles swoops I’m saved him Peter gets mad goes after miles then you fight and maybe you can pick who to fight as idk like multiple ending kinda thing you feel me but I don’t see that tbh so you might just play as miles fighting Peter to get the venom suit off him
11:33 That detail where Miles notices Peter's aggressiveness dropping the civilian like that.
Im guessing the final boss will be red goblin (green goblin with carnage symbiote)
This is the first Spider-Man game where black suit spidey looks perfect for gameplay. Sheesh
This is definitely finna be a masterpiece
Pete bout to put some dirt in many eyes👀
what about xbox gamers? 😭😭😭😭😭
Obviously we knew there would be a black symbiote suit, but that woulf of been a great moment to experience in the game for the first time.
Something is off about the venom suit, dont like the design. The combat looks off to   Just my opinion.  Some scenes are great, some feels like a downgrade overall from the older games but its early to say.  Right now its giving me Prototype 2 vibes
At first I thought I misclicked on a Horizon gameplay trailer but soon found out that it was a Batman gameplay trailer. Good stuff.
I need Ps5 now
This game is channeling some   serious Web of Shadows vibes.  The gameplay (not a huge fan of too much cinematic cutscenes) seriously made me gasp and say "that's awesome!" more than a few times.  I'm so pumped!
Sasuke?
why does he have the symbyote suit?
This is gonna be straight fire🔥🔥🔥
if have to play as the jogger its a pass
Kann es kaum erwarten das Spiel endlich in meinen Händen zu halten 🎮❤
Can't wait PC port in 5 years, that would melt our brand new RTX over9090Ti with fabulous 30fps(with drops to 7fps).
I hope we end up fighting venom in this game
Can't wait till it comes to PC
Ok so Gankys drone is def a goblin prototype glider
If he doesn’t say a line relating to throwing dirt in someone’s eye at least one time in this game, I will be broken 😭🖤😭
I just started playing the last one and why this ain’t three
I bet everyone here who is judging the game before it's release, i challenge you the gameplay graphics will look 100 percent better during its release
Kraven’s chest hair though…. 😫
Apparently, There’s always something special when something has the title “spiderman 2”
What did I miss to not understand why Peter has the symbiote?
giving me wen of shadows vibes one of my favorite Spider-Mand fr
I love the new movement systems especially miles'
We gonna wind up fighting peter
Wow that's so amazing 😍❤
looks to much like the first games imo..
Ubisoft take notes this how you release a game play trailer. Not cut through ever 5 seconds to hide your mediocrity. Bravo insomniac you always sit the bar high…..
God I hope they went with PS4 Peter face
Sasuke Uchiha's voice
Why did they change the color of the venom electric
Finally, Prototype 3 has come out. I have been waiting for this for years
Looks so amazing! Miles still bothers me, though. He can teleport now? 🙄
The web swinging looks the same except the wing suit… Combat looks amazing but disappointed with traversal
4:54 Thor what are you doing here ?
By far this is the most accurate symbiote look and animation to date. By FAR.
Most overhyped game of all time
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👏👏👏👏💯💯💯💯💯
Black Spooder-Mayne x2 😎
Всё равно не поиграем, нафига нам эти трейлеры.
Bully Lowenthal😂
This is fire 🔥🔥🔥🤯
With all these great PS5 games for 2023, they better not give game of the year to Zelda.
Ps3 graphics
OHHH MAN!!!!! do i love this game. The only and only reason to buy a PS5 for this vary game is so JUSTIFIABLE… It’s just brings up my childhood memories❤❤❤❤
Is it me or does symbiote Spider-Man sound like English dub sasuke lol
I like how Peter’s voice is just Sasukes
so they're a time skip in this game
I never thought the voice actor of Peter Parker was the same person that dubbed Sasuke from Naruto
Black suit spidey is basically Sasuke now.  Yuri Gave the same vibes of when Sasuke broke the sound ninjas arms. Always knew his black suit performance was going to be epic
It is definitely Going to be great 💯💯
They chose the right voice actor for Spidey. He doesn't sound like the lame, unwitty Tom Holland spiderman.
that ending
Looks miles beyond anything I expected, can't wait to see firsthand just how much this sequel lives up to its name!!!
Combat is impressive. Spider man feels very powerfull. Just like superhero should. I love that the enemies are not spongey.
Venom ⚫
Insane
I can not wait for this to come out, I’m not leaving the house for a minute🫣
also garena freefire x spider man coming!!! ❤
am I the only one who noticed how the swinging made you slower ?? After miles launched himself ??
?
Now that's how a Spiderman movie should be 😂I mean game 😁
👟🦸‍♂️
Why is venom always making everything better in spider-man games/movies?
Okay the next bully Maguire incoming.
It looks like they nailed kraven and I'm fuckin hyped
This will be a awesome year for Spider-Man!
I hope we can switch character in free roam not only in mission
This game play looks so clean I can't wait to play this it looks so 🔥🔥
Peter's voice when on the symbiote suit is perfect.  It's like the aggressive behavior is slowly and surely creeping in his psyche and that sooner or later he will just go evil when left unchecked.  I also love that small detail that Miles didn't even detect Peter crashing down from above, like in the comics
Out of all the 100 "how's Pete's suit affects his personality" comment here's a different take Kraven is one of the most boring villains in Spiderman idk why they chose him and graphically the game looks washed out for some reason and it's supposed to be next gen and even the gameplay looks the same. Sorry but my hopes ain't that high.
I hope Eddie Brock is going to be the host of the Venom symbiote
*This game is looking absolutely 🔥🔥🔥 and I can not WAIT for this game to be officially released as well! The graphics, the combat, Miles' & Peter's new powers/abilities and hell, even The Lizard himself were/was all looking 🔥 too! I can certainly see this game being hailed as "game of the year" despite some intense competition coming from other games this year ofc i.e. Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, Mortal Kombat 1 etc, but still tho.*
Fix the graphic , please 🙏🏾
pretty sick
Lot of things are revealed!   Many villains in this too.  Connors, Harry, Hunter and others too.   Harry was surviving because of venom. But the venom needs a new host and Peter was there.   So once peter has the venom, that has left Harry weak and vulnerable. To cure his disease, Dr. Connors' help is needed. But he was doing experiments of his own and turned to lizard. Peter needs a cure to save both Lizard and Harry.   Meanwhile, Hunter has a new playground to hunt all of them and both Miles/Peter have to save them.
8:14 Miles just went from San Francisco to Sydney in like 2 seconds
Ideas for more games: Iron spider  Spider verse  Scarlet spider  Superior spider  Please use these ideas if they’re good You don’t have to pay me
My theroy is miles going to figure out what the symbiote is doing to peter and he trys to stopped peter and they get into a fight than miles is bleeding masked ripped apart miles goes into a coma and that makes peter realize what he done and he goes take off the suit
4:59 Bro really did a kamehameha
I can't stand Miles but the symbiote stuff almost makes up for it
Stop. Im hype now.
Please say that you can play as both miles and Peter at the same time for most missions so you can do split screen. It would would be so cool to be doing multiplayer stealth ops
r/spidermanPS4 can rest now
I’m not a fan of no co op but the game will be amazing nonetheless
crazy
Ghost spider was seen in the map
This looks like better than the rest better then miles morales and thats my favorite in the series
My most hyped game coming out looks even better than id hoped
nice venom
Everything about this just hits right. I do hope we get a cameo scene of Bully Maguire though.
Not gonna lie , the vemon suit is a bit letdown
This Game is the best ! I wanna play it NOW !!
nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
looks like a dlc
Fine i will buy a ps5
1st day commenting 😌
What a shame my computer ain't good enough
Wtf with this water graphics? And also animations? Looks not so good tbh
I hope john bubniak (peter face model from spiderman ps4 original) returns as peter parker in this game.
PC gamers waiting 5 years more for the port 😢
So nobody's gonna mention how in the first game it's mentioned that the web wings never worked and now they do? He got them working!
🕷️ 🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️
This game is going to be unlike anything we have experienced in a super hero game before.  The action looks insane and the story so far is amazing.  Cannot wait to play this game and see Venom!!!
Symbiote Spider man combat reminds me of Prototype
They're really taking a page from Uncharted series with all these scripted action sequences. They're gorgeous!
I Cant wait to play it looks amazing Love the fact we will get to play Peter and Miles Spiderman in this game constantly hopefully we get to change who we are playing in the open world to do change and save the city. Love that there going to be even more villains Kaven looks epic. Finally, you play Symoite spider man with Symbiote power that looks stunning.
Peter channelling his inner Sasuke. Nice.
Nothing who is "amazing".
Prototype 3??
This going be it ❤❤❤
Hello old me
And i am so excited i hope it realise on pc soon after realising on ps5 cuz it's just awesome and the mods man so awesome it's going to be and i am waiting for this game to come over a year for pc console come on insomniac u want money i am ready to give u just realised it once u realisee it on ps5❤❤❤❤❤
<3 omg love this game
dude why can’t this be on ps4 too?
Beautiful. GOTY worthy already
Alex Mercer has entered the chat...
For the second I was really scared. Then it turned out NOT to be Kraven.  Bravo
Это очень круто выглядит
ITS FCKING AWESOMEEEE!!! I got scared at first lizard scene. Like everything is PERFECTTT!! Also i LOVE HOW PETER IS MORE HARSH. I guess he is gonna lose his mind. Im so excited for it to come out!!
I love the detail that peters eyes start to resemble venoms when he says he has big teeth at the end, so cool
Honestly this is all they had to show and people would buy it. Insomniac shouldn't show anything else and just release the game lol
Game look sick but i am not going to wait for 2 years to buy it on pc guess i just miss out on another Spider-man game
Gaymplay revil
I can sense GOTY vibes already
5:02 Man was so mad that 2099 choke slammed him that he straight up did it himself 💀
Xenoblade 😂
Miles is super broken for no reason
"he has big teeth" "so do i" that was cold and sent chills down my spine
aint no way miles kicks a robo hawk from the ceiling and it crashes on the floor and he keeps stealthing
This is memorable. I hope it’s worth the hype! Coming back after release.
i bet y'all we are gonna see miles vs pete in which pete gets overwhelmed by venom
Love the smack talk
For some reason I was waiting for a dinosaur
Take my money! This is why i bought a ps5!
Let me come back here in some time.
is Pete as Venom going to be the final boss? 🤔
So anyone notice symbiote Spider-man acts exactly like Arkahm Batman
Did they forget that the PS3 was discontinued years and years ago? If this game doesn't come out for Ps4 as well, then I can't explain how they managed to create a worse technical department than Arkham Knight, a game from 8 years ago.
If they add some kind of choice like in Web of Shadows it's a must buy.
Arghh looks amazing
Spider-Venom Reminds me of the game Prototype (2009), if you haven't played it , you should to get a taste of what it will be like playing as Full Venom
I'd admit. I hope the find a way to bring in Spider-Gwen into the game. ❤
They have to introduce so many storylines, Kraven, The Symbiote/Venom/Carnage, Harry Osborne potentially being "cured" with Doctor Connors, plus all the time we will spend as Miles, this game is gonna be long and I LOVE IT!
Next best venom suit to web of shadows
Reminds me of prototype 🥹
Feels like prototype kinda vibes
Spider-Man Web of Shadows. But with new characters
Is it gonna have the "Kravens Last Hunt" Storyline from the comics? Look it up if you dont know it everyone.
The Venom thing is the best part of this game. Would like to see some backstory
Cya
I need a ps5
I'm hyped, not just for the gameplay,  but for the story implications as well. At this point in Peter's life, losing aunt May, Doc Ock, and now gaining the Symbiote suit? This looks to be a pretty dark story for Peter. Not to mention having to deal with some of his most primal opponents in Lizard, kraven, and Venom.  Fall 2023 can't come soon enough
Miles:He’s got big teeth Venom:So do i
miles sabe hacer el kame hame ha
looks awesome!
When is sony going to make Spiderman movies just like he makes Spiderman games?
11:32 Bully Macquire behaviour
They really doubled down on momentum which looks sick
Evil Sasuke is that you :O
Fv vs DDS CV rf
This looks like a ps4 game
Insomniac delivers awesome Spider Man gameplay once again
11:54 Sasuke Vibes
This is alot for a trailer, but i still want more lol
Spidermans symbiote voice is trying too hard
Please launch it on PC, I know you guys developed the game in PC, respect pc
I’m getting ps5 just for this
When peter says:”so do i” thats not peter thats venom
Looks like spider man meets assassin's creed and splinter cell 🤣
This looks sick!!!! Can’t wait to play it
I can't wait for this one
This is unbelievable 🤯🤯
I’m so hyped
Literally fell asleep yesterday I missed this this masterpiece.
we’re gonna have to pick between them i can just tell
Who doesn't like angry spider-man? This game gonna sold!
30 fps?
In Spider Man 1, inside of a backpack there’s gliders in it, so I guess he worked it into something
Insomniac just forgot to add the artificial arms of Peter shown in the first trailer😂  But  this is way better
yuris sasuke tone is really coming out in this game lol
Web swinging looks the same 😢
lets go
Peter sounds like Sasuke
Why is Miles electricity Blue now?
Would be cool if they make a game in the jungle with spiderman...or a kraven origin story
I have not played marvel Spiderman 1 yet but looks like I have to skip it coz this one looks fire 🔥 💯
I’m actually disappointed to see Kraven and the Lizard as the main villains.  I always found them so unbelievably boring in the animated series.
GOTY incoming
I hope they actually let Peter keep the black suit for longer than one game instead of getting rid of it in some cheesy character development moment.
*sigh* no Venom till Spiderman 3, huh? :<
Can’t wait for pc release!
cant wait!!!!!!
Welp. I was waiting for Spider-Man 2 before I got a PS5 and I am not disappointed with what I see so far!
I have no doubts from the cinematography, the script and the action of the game that it will be very good. But to be frank, there are some cons as well as action scenes and copious fight scenes that keep our excitement high. For example, I think the graphics are below the first game, also the symbiot costume is very poorly designed, the character designs are almost the same as the first game, but the Lizard looks like a dinosaur rather than a lizard. As for the voiceovers, it's not bad at all, it's pretty good, but it doesn't look nice if your voice is unnecessarily thick while wearing the Peter Symbiot costume.
see you soon
This game looks kinda difficult
What a time to be alive!
Finally after a year
they fulfilled my dream of making the web wings work like just cause woohoo,and the swinging and combat lookks soo smooth now
Re-color spiderman again... pass.
Waiting for the downgrades
Yes
SHOCKERRRR!!!!
I've seen all I need to see here. Take my money!!!
They gotta add a dancing scene from the 3rd movie
The eay Peter threw the civilian after saving him ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
The graphic looks very underwhelming
this looks like a last gen game..   Nothing “Next Gen” about this
Peep miles saving the fisherman & THE FISH, finally another gem to play 💪🏽
Miles is going to end up fighting Peter at some point isn't he.
Fricking AWESOME!
I laugh very time when I see a hunter who comes up and tastes the blood. This is such nonsense
Now drop Marvel vs Capcom 5 and all things video games are forgiven.
BRUH I AM SO HYPED DEFINITELY PRE ORDERING IT
Pediu a musica emprestado pro destiny foi?
Anybody else get Spider-Man Web of Shadows vibes from this?
All I heard was the inner sasuke 😭
reminds me of a lego game
Hey this will come in ps4 too right?.Bcuz I'm rlly scared that it won't,Pls somebody ans me in the replies
This all looks great but the design of the symbiote suit is really weird... why does it look like half armour and half alive? It's just not working.
i don't know why but i like this new aggressive spiderman
This is Everything I want it to be already!  They are defs gunning for GOTY and I won’t speak to soon b4 it comes out. But I’m already so impressed!
Kraven has always been my favourite villain I’m so happy he’s included in such a big role in this game
Very weak graphics. It doesn't feel like Next Gen
They gonna fight
That looks boring as hell. Another interactive movie on PS5. Can devs have inspiration for once?
Spiderman will last boss
Symbiote suit tentacles looks like the zombies in dying light
I don’t pre order anything anymore ….but this. Oooohhhhhhh THIS.
Афигеть
I love the dynamic of switching between the two characters. I fully expect the final boss to be Peter v Miles and then Venom v Peter and Miles. Looks sick.
Insimniac ❤
It will definitely be the Spider-Man Year ! Between the new movie "Across The Spider-verse" and this game, i'm definitely thankful for all these excellent adaptations ! The videogame seems will and i can't wait to play it !  And i'm wondering which costume we will be able to unlock and to wear during this adventure !
5:03 "Hey."
it looks like an addition to the first part
Marvel  can  you  guys   add    first  person  ??
Omg really were doing this again WITG VENOM AGAIN OMG
looks actually bad. NY feels painted with felt pen, unnatural look. Textures on human enemies look off as well, lisard even worth. Miles files through NY like a bird, this feels off. You'd better improved the swining gameplay, making it more physics like, e.g. when you swing in the first games you can change direction mid air wherever you want - it was ok back there but I still tried to never use it and simulate realistic momentum. Anyways, this feels worth. It is like the new engline has improved ligthing which now shows all the textures and engine flaws which were not seen before. I prefere graphics and engine of the previous games.
THAT'S   AMZING
tahts amaizing
OMG THIS SO FIRE
Do you know what you've done?! No one should be allowed this much power over people, all of us are beyond hyped.
So calling it now, Peter is gonna be a(h) boss battle, I can just tell
is no one else noticing the fact that the venom spiderman suit looks like trash???? its so shiny and weird
holy crap, this looks just so insanely cool, i think i just wet myself... so hyped
3:11 this move is what sells his anger for me.
Looks fine? Basically an updated Arkham with SpiderMan. Launch this on PC so we can unleash the FPS guys
Prototype 2 is still a better game than this
Designs are incredible, and the spideys' movement couldn't be more amazing. I'm just not sure about this really angry voice Peter is doing. Sounds like he's trying to imitate the Hulk in the bathroom.
Game of the year!! Definitely the best Spider-Man game to ever come out.
So hyped for this.
We need this game
He lookin like Batman
The tag team action and switching back and forth looks exciting! I want this game right now :)
Off course the symbiote changes him, but definitely kraven or lizard did something to left him so angry
wow😲😲😲😲😲
This looks unreal
Whoever sees this after the game comes out read this                   You didn’t experience it😑
Symbiote suit could look way better tf is this 💀
Кайф!
Am I the only one who hated the "Angry Peter" voice
new moves of miles are sick af
This is giving prototype vibes
I hope the Real Spider-Man (PP) will not be second-rate characters because of the despised skin color and unnecessary Morales with the chosen color will be in the first roles. I really hope this unnecessary tolerance is enough and already everyone is going crazy with this
miles can glide, wow
Peter is becoming racist
This game looks like it would come out today so I can play it.
sick  moves for venom spiderman suit
Hope there's a wolverine cameo
Ok, wow
I don’t like the black suit. Very unappealing
Promising. To think that we'll have to wait at least two years to get it on PC... hoping they don't forget the Symbiot Raimi Suit.
I love that his suit looks like a living shell with the tentacles.
How am I supposed to book the release date off work if I don't know when it comes out insomniac
waiting for it
Im hyped af !!
Spider-Man and Miles Morals both are master piece ❤❤ and Spider-Man 2 would be a great hit. Eagerly waiting for it. @Marvel  @insomniac @sony @ps5 A big thanks for delivering such great games.❤❤
The explosions and water physics look like something from ps2 era
Kraven the Hunter is a fuckboi emo? Lmfao Oh.... Oh nvm....
I’m so confused, if Spider-Man’s in the venom looking costumes  who’s the other guy. ? Lol
Since the first teaser of Spider-man 2 we all knew the voice would be of kraven. Ruthless hunter who hunts his prey
Game of the year, calling it now
Symbiote Spider Man is really cool!
"He's got big teeth." "So do I." Chills, man! Chills!
5:00 kamehamehaaaaa
Why is he in the suit again?
I'm liking the dynamic so far. Feels like Peter giving into his demons after the pain and loss of the first game and only the people closest to him (Miles, most likely MJ) can pull him out. Symbiote storyline is always best when it's an addiction story. Be greater, together can be taken as Pete thinking the symbiote makes him better when really it's Miles.
Its looks so cool . Hope that comes for ps4 too Its one of those games that will be remembered for decades .
Bhai spider man 2 game kab release hogi Marvel waalo
I need a ps5 now
Just looks like a DLC
does miles have two diffrent lightning attack blue and  yellow ?
See you in 10 years when i finally bought an ps5 and downloaded this game😅
💘
Hey thats deacon st johns brother Boozer
This game reminds me of the ultimate Spider-Man game. I loved it so much.
11:33 Peter really giving off Black Air Force energy
NEW GHOST RIDER I NEED IT I love ghost rider pls new ghost rider movie pls you didn’t make enough marvel.
I didn’t play the first game, I’m so confused on what’s going on lol
Looks like Spider-Man 1 story DLC. This one has nothing new other than story. Graphics are the same, game world is the same, action scenes are same on the rails ones, animations are mostly the same. Effects are still last gen (Animated transparent pictures) not real time simulations
amazing!
graphics straight out of 2010 🤣🤣
Kraken should become Venom for the final fight ❤
this about to be generational
How the hell can you call this stuff "Gameplay" ??? Cutscene after cutscene....
HE'S GONNA WISH HE NEVER CAME TO NEW YORK!!!
I am here for attendance when i will look back to this masterpiece in 10 years.😂❤
The Symbiote looks really good here, nicely done Insomniac
Why is everyone getting so hyped about this. Nothing was that revolutionary, "WOAH DUDE, did you see how he just dumped that civilian on the ground, WOAH". yeah everyone noticed it mate, not that subtle. Also too much Miles Morales for me, not enough Spider Man.
The sasuke voice actor is crazy on point on this occasion doing Pete with venom
what with all this flying crap ? the whole point of a spiderman game is to swing not fly around like batman
I wonder if we can get a daredevil and Spider-Man team up in this game
Yo ima not lie the gameplay seems the same as spiderman ps4 and miles they should have changed a bit
"the great hunt begins" chills
WoW
LOL they stole music from Destiny
Looks amazing so far, cannot wait! I hope we'll get a showdown between Miles and Peter where we play as Miles confronting him about the symbiote and having to wrestle it off of him quite literally to cure him.
Maybe this time I can swing around my house in Queens in the game..
Oh
Sasuke sounds even more aggressive than usual
See you in 10 years when the pc version arrives
Are suit powers gonna be in this game like the first game.
Interested in the variety of Symbiote suits.
I play Xbox Series X and Only Xbox. I've watch The Last Of Us whole campaign via TheRadBrad... But ngl, This makes me want to actually buy a PS5 and play it myself.
Cant wait for this to come out on PC
Better than Adipurush VFX
Miles really had to pull out the Kamehameha💀
can’t wait 🥶
This is gonna be legendary
Looks good but I'm not a fan of the web swinging, the animations are all the same from the previous two games, I hope in the finally release they are different animations
This one's gonna be another banger I can feel it
Gase Tom Holland give his voice to him in game
Excelsior,Stan Lee.
I hope you play as peter more then miles since miles is basicaly a side kick and i never finished the first miles game bc his character isnt that intresting to me
5:00 Miles legit did hadouken into the MIguel Chokeslam !!!
Symbiote looks good
It's bullin time
It’s about that time I was bored in PlayStation with fifa and 2k
Peak
Spider-Man: Web of Shadows 2, looking good!
❤
There better be a scene where symbiote Peter chases Shocker... please I need that scene in 4k resolution
HELL YEAH
What if the villain is also a player 🧐🧐 then it will be an awesome experience 🎉🎉🎉❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ plz Sony plz implement it in game plz 🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
Please stop using Kraven. Im 24 years old and so f bored to see him in everygame. Spider-Man has billions story.
Web of shadows handled black suit very well ! I'm certain this is going to do it very well too
cant wait to pirate this on pc like the last game
Kraven the hunter nice
I should've known Prototype 3 would come at our most dire hour of need.
The lizard look like mini godzilla The chase in the sea look like the one with rihno but it’s under the water and more terrifying
Time for bully Lowenthal
Today just keeps getting better and better
still better than the cgi of the movie
That’s hebi sasuke coming out
Amazing🎉
12 minutes and 24 seconds full of mind blown stuff
"Gameplay" lol.  Do you like scripted FMVs with lots of QTEs?  Than this is the game for you!
thank you insomniac you guys make my day!
Unchanded + spiderman + yakuza
Peter woke up on demon time
I'm calling it right now. Game Of The Year 2023.
It would be more accurate and cool if in the swinging mechanism of vemon spiderman the black web actually attach back with the suit with each and every swing, because those are not actually web, those are actual part of venom, so it doesn't make sense to leave each and every part of that behind in the walls of buildings and every location he swing past.
2:33 the symbiote tendril combat gives me strong PROTOTYPE 2 vibes.
It looks so dope
Dare I say?….This looks amazing!!!!
This game will definitely be the game of the year.
I think the suit looks a little too tactical, they should’ve made it look fully gruesome and made the Symbiot move around though his body, sort of like a slime that’s alive
This looks amazing
Miles and Peter definitely gonna fight
Spiderman wearing the symbiote is giving me Prototype2 vibes.
The powers of venom, give me that Prototype vibe!! Really cool
the UI looks ugly tho, when fighitng, unclean ionno, in miles morales and spiderman it was so sublte and nice
Apart of history right here gentlemen let’s really soak it in here 😎
I don't like Lizard's design.
🥹
Everyone’s talking about how much more aggressive Peter is with the Venom suit, meanwhile I’m just wondering how tf Miles “Pressure Valve” Morales isn’t killing everyone he punches in the vitals with electricity
I love this game so far but it will be cooler if the body reacts to the explosive at  9:22 to make the symbiote more alien like and not a suit. And for the symbiote to react to fire sound and electricity when it gets closer to it later in the game but other than that this game look fire.🔥🔥
Miles Morales and Peter Parker are going to fight by the end of the game. I'm calling it.
"GET BACK HERE SHOCKER!!!! SHOOCKERRRR!!!!!!!!!! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME! I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EAAARRRRTTHH!!!!!!!!!!   Black Suit Spidey VA really channeling this energy
13:50
4:59 Miles just did an electric hadouken... Take my money!
OH MY GOD!! The legendary spider man game is back with 2 spideys i gotta play spider man again and miles morales
Mannn!! I still haven't gotten over Spider-Man 2018 and Spider-Man miles morales... and then comes this 😍🤩😍🤩🔥🔥🔥 "Insomniac" is killing it out there AMAZING! I can't w8 for the Wolverine gameplay trailer...... I am soooo Hyped!!
Can’t believe this is gaming now ❤
Love the call back when peter saves miles from making a mistake  now its the other way round
Is that sydney harbour bridge 8:49
Pena q vai ser só pra ps5, se fosse para o ps4 as vendas seria bem melhor e também seria capaz de batar receber de vendas em um jogo de super heróis de novo, pena q é só pra ps5
ai pula
i love how angry he sounds in the symbiote suit, it’s reminds me of when he chased ahocker to the ends of the earth
Seeing the symbiot was amazing but also sad reminder of how sick a prototype game would be if it was released today. Alex Mercer would merc parker
Im excited for the venom stuff but i really hope we get normal quippy yuri spidey as well
Spiderman casually destroying an helicopter in New York and not killing anybody😂
I wish Sony would get their Spiderman movies even half as good as their games
Hope I still get to wear tobey’s suit in the game when this scene plays out
Smr la hype
Why the movie is not even half as good as this trailer?
sickkkkkkkk but wait i don't have a ps5
RIP for us who wanted the game to have coop  But it looks amazing🔥
This game gon be so good I actually can’t wait
The gameplay was mind-blowing but the graphics look kinda old
I like how Miles gameplay feel like stealth game such as splinter cell, while Peter with the symbiote is straight up berzerking trought hordes brutaly.
The feelings I got while watching this are hard to describe. I teared up a few times, i was in pure awe at one point, This will be the first Spider-Man game that I buy in so long. One of my favorite superheroes.
Will there be a day/night cycle this time?
Graphics and gameplay impressive as always. Definitely a contender for GOTY!!
finally prototype 3 gameplay reveal is out
here
Peter be like: 'Kraveeeeen!!! I'll chase you to the ends of the Earth!!!!!'
just add co-op story
Final Boss Peter Parker
This looks cool but I do still wish they didn’t change Peters design
Looked like a PS4 game, kinda mid. Need a new Batman game.
tiene buena pinta, pero le faltan muchas cosas aún
4:03 wait this can be a sign 🪧 form god they can make a Superman game
Bro this gameplay looks sick im hyped
One step closer to a fully fledged Bully Maguire game lol
Spiderman doesn't kill. Just break your spine and leaves you paralysed to live a life of agony 😊
Фраза человек паук людей не убивает здесь не уместна
I felt robbed buying morales, so Ill play when it’s free.
“..This is something else😏”
Graphics are poor and symbiote suit design is terrible with its leather pads and weird texture. Symbiote gameplay is practically Prototype rehashed. Enemy AI is poor, they wait to be taken out one by one.  Forced to play as Miles is not good. Body part movements are weird. But at least it looks fun to play and I love Pete's voice acting.
We better get a *SHOCKEEEEEEEEEEERRRR* reference
3:25 sounded like agents of shield
Yesssss
Can’t wait
cant wait for this game to rape my pc wait its coming out on pc right?
Press X to win
Narutoooooo
Can't wait for this to come out of beta
Who is the black spider man? Is that Peter?
Xbox plz😊
So, they have the address of every superhero and villain in Manhattan?
But Where is Venom ? Playable Venom , not just Peter symbiote
Peter parker has the voice of sasuke uchiha in this game😂😂lol
Bold Prediction: Spider-Man will die in this game 😮 Miles avenges him
7/10
This is awesome. And it's already a enjoyable game.
Why does the 2023 game look worse than the 2018 game?
Someone is going to see this comment in maybe 5 to 10 years later
6:45 this looks terrifying, imagine seeing that in your basement or in your old room in 3am.
That Venom moves and look are inspired by Spiderman Web Of Shadows game ❤️
this enemies just a pug, they just stay and did nothing T_T
oh man, we are facing the possibly number 1 of the avengers in 2023, very complete game, you are crazy Sony  🌟🦾
Time to put some dirt in their eyes!
Sasuke
I like the symbiote suit in this scenario. Seeing how it affects the teamwork.
So the impact with which those guys were getting slammed, Spideys definitely getting a body count in this game.
Man this game looks amazing but sadly I don’t have a ps5 ❤😢
WOW I get really hyped up for this game sheeesh, its looking fantastic
Man, seeing those gameplay and how both Spider-man is playable make me wish Venom is playable too.  Like, only the Ultimate Spider-man I've experienced free roam as Venom, instead Spidey.
Lizard looks like frickin godzilla
3:44 is when the gas kicked in for me
🤩
I LOVE THIS GAMEPLAY! I SIMPLY CANT WAIT TO PLAY THIS GAME!
According to Venom’s voice actor for this game it will be released in September 2023
13 years later
This is not spiderman, this is venomerman !
I see inspiration  from prototype  games , I love it 🤭
I need that venom wall beat down….NEOOOW
11:55 what if peter grew a mouth with the symbiote and give miles a evil grin to scare him 😂
LET ME PLAY IT ALREADY!!!
Spider man will die in Spider man 2.
I’m so looking forward! Epic trailer!
This is gonna be a rocking game ❤
i cant wait
This is far more exciting than the first one ;)
Yup.
This is gonna be awsome!!!
When u can already tell that peter is the last boss
I’m going to talk to myself in the future so, hello it is me you probably just remembered me and that we wrote this comment, I just want to see how the game is. After you read this I want to know how the gameplay is / what the story is like I.e, the game is glitchy and laggy, it has the best graphics you’ve seen, etc. I also want to take the liberty to check in on myself every once in a while. I’ll see you soon. (P.S reply for each time you check in on us and eventually I will change into you via username).
He got big teeth  So do I
Dis shiiii gone be good 😊
Wish they would release the PC version alongside the main game considering how well the release on steam of the 1st game did. Don't wanna wait until they port it lol
Does peter sound like sasuke uchiha or is it just me?
I have a PS4, I'll come back when I have a PS5 and played the game
So it's a movie with Quick Time Events.
Can't wait to play this on my PS4! Oh wait nevermind..
Let’s all just remember that this is coming out after across the spider verse so miles should consider himself lucky that he didn’t have to fight black suit insomniac Peter parker
Ngl i gotta know how peter got the symbiote
0:42 the soundtrack from TLOU2 The WLF 1:43 from soundtrack video
I thought the swinging was overhauled? It’s a carbon copy of the first game. Same shitty physics when you’re about to hit the ground (or water in this case) and you magically float while the web attaches.
Чето Прототайп 3 захотелось… забавно, учитывая конкуренцию с инфеймоуз
BRO WHAAAAAAAAT NEED IT ❗️❗️❗️ 🕷️🕸️
At 11:52, you notice the eyes of venom are moving and when Peter said “He’s mine” the eye turned a bit more edgy
Will it be on ps4 at all?
А у нас будет озвучка!!! Бебебебе политиканам!
This is gonna be great
Sasuke's voice actor is doing a goddamn good job
This is next level
The suit looks kinda weird. Just stick with the old spandex suit look
GIVE THAT GAME NOW
I really love the gameplay and I hope they won't make the game too much child or family friendly and actually making it more mature and more brutal, I know that Spider Man and Venom can have a lot of dark moments, and they won't be wasted.
11:33 i love that this scene really portrays the side effects of Peter having The Venom Symbiote in his body, Miles was shocked that Peter threw the Civilian away and everything.
Ughhhh wat about ps4 wtf?
Will the game also be available on PS4? Because i don't have a PS5.
On xbox to? pls
Playing this with haptic feedback. Lord have mercy
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I've been in your shadow for hours - kraven the hunter
As long as it's not Spider-Man 2 Miles Morales guest starring Peter Parker. Really would rather have had Eddie Brock as the other playable character. At least we get the symbiote finally.
Favorite part is definitely the super slingshot and the glider wings. It looks super cool and the fact that its super fast makes free roaming way funner
So........Is this the opening of the game?
11:32 i like how miles was like wtf when peter throws that civilian to the ground.
bro where is the co-op?
why does spider man sounds like hes about to activate the mangekyou sharingan? 😆😆
I was expecting trailer than full gameplay but whatever it is I am happy and excited to play
Looks the same
This is gonna be an all-timer for sure. Cannot wait
looks good
New suit looks awful...
One of the best Spider-Man suits for sure.
I think Yuri might've had to unleash his inner Sasuke for this game lmaooo
Omg! i can't wait when it release on Pc Amazing😍
Bruh its ps5 only :( wish i had one like all of u but i have to be happy with what god gave me.
Helllllll yeaaaaahh baby bully Maguire
Yeah, where's Wolverine?
Fantastic
BULLY MEGUIRE IS BACK!!
Now I want to see Kraven the Hunter vs the Predator. The beginning of the trailer gave me strong if it bleeds, we can kill it vibes.
See this comment in the future!!!
Hello to me in the future, your probably playing this right now and think wow this is cool, because that’s what I’m thinking right now
so....is this a game that you PLAY or a quick time event movie?
I hope they make it so u have to plug a controller into a usb slot to play as miles.
It's always super tense with Peter and the symbiote together. Never know what he's gonna say, and now that we have Miles here with him, it makes Peter look so intimidating. Like you feel that he's lash out at Miles over something small.
Omfg I can’t wait bro when can I pre order
11:37 "He got away from us"... He was not referring Miles 😮
Correct me if I'm wrong but I love that in this game Peter actually uses the symbiote suit to its fullest effect. In most iterations, we usually just see him fighting IN the symbiote suit, whereas in this one we get to see him fight WITH the symbiote suit, gooey tentacles and all.
The gameplay itself does look very easy (trivial) with the number of OP gadgets/abilities at your disposal
Game looks awesome don’t get me wrong but is it me or I don’t see any difference in web swinging
The devs said this would be the Empire Strikes Back of sequels.
SWITCH TO MILES??
Like this if it blows up
OHHH i can feel it Miles and peter will fight each other!?
This is gonna be a goody
If you ever have a girlfriend that says “chose me or Spider-Man 2” I hope she understands the consequences. I just had a nerd orgasm. Double take downs? Dark Peter Parker? Switchable combo action? Oh hells yeah
Y'all peep Miles's "What the hell was that, bro?" moment when Pete threw the civilian off onto the ground roughly at 11:32? Lmaooo
Peter's aggression is balanced by his anxiety, which makes him a more complex and interesting character. I'm also glad that he's not being mean to Miles, even if he is being dismissive.
Et edy avec Venom il est où
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS SO COOL
Symbiote Spider-Man is a force to be reckoned with, and I can't wait to see what he can do in the game.He's going to be a blast to play as !
Funny how every time an Insomniac spider man comes out, another Spider verse movie comes out the same year
GET BACK HERE SHOCKER!!  SHOCKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!
Anyone else think Peter sounds cringey when he tries to sound angry
Doesnt pete sound like Sasuke?? N the "Hes mine"😈 definitely gives a vibe
Rockstar X Marvel
Шикарная графика , интересный сюжет относительно , отличная игра наверняка получилась !
Andrew Garfield spiderman can be just like this in next movie
This is awesome, this is fantastic!
I just realized! In 11:38 he says "He got away from us." At first I didn't give it a second thought but now that I've listened to it again, I think the "us" isn't him and Miles!
Seems Yuri’s channeling a bit of Sasuke for his Symbiote voice
angy spidman
But the graphics dose not match the next gen
If I don’t get to play as actual venom, I will be upset 😂
Kinda sad that Peter didn’t really get any new swinging animations but still excited!
Everything looks good but idk why. The lighting lighting just doesn’t look very nice to me.
That's the best gameplay trailer I've saw in so long, the game looks great I really like the way they're going with it.
It can also came for PS4
The symbiote is awesome, but nobody’s talking about “Harry’s dying, and he [Connors] is the only one who can help” part.  HELLO?? What happened between now and the last game??
He's never like that 🥶
Kind of turning Miles into Robin but I am okay with that, not seen this take before so looking forward to it. And the Lizard looking like he did in Spider-man 3 video game. Not my favorite but hey this level looked awesome.
Am I the only person who doesn’t like the design of the black suit? Cause I haven’t seen anyone else talk about it
Gonna be one of the best games of all time
Will this ever come to ps4
Remember, Spiderman has a no kill rule 🤡
I love the little things like Peter cutting miles off, not really congratulating him or being too encouraging around him when he’s done well, also just kind of demanding miles to do certain things, as well as tossing civilians aside aggressively fighting. Even the subtle things really show how much he’s being effected by the symbiote and who knows how bad it can become.
Bully Maguire returns
oh my GOD
This is gonna be peak 😈
So gassed for this man
Hi me in two years reliving memories
Real
this looks awesome
I'd be happy if they did a co-op out of this. Two spidermen in a open world and do some missions together.
This is gonna be so good
Bully Maguire is back!!!
Imagine: you can spend skill point on symbiote  Abilities and last boss is Venom but  more skill points you spend on his Abilities  stronger the boss will be
finally venomm
Black-Suit gameplay awesome...
Yuri Lowenthal finn go crazy on this beat
Me:Oh i can't wait to play this game. My BRAIN: U ARE POOR U MF. 😢😢
Another Epic Game  IS ON THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
_Marvel's Spider Man Venom's Warpath_ its a more fitting title!
Spidermans fighting system is so repetitive and boring it’s basically swinging and pushing buttons. I don’t get the hype about the game.
I hope they mixed some web of shadows combat mechanics
How many Spiderman 2 do we want to get?
Game of the year confirmed
is it just me or the textures for the blackmask do not look good
Can we have a trailer?
Really hope they give the option to keep the symbiote suit,idk maybe we will get choices or something.I just really wanna have a Bully Maguire run tbh
Can’t wait to platinum this ❤
Release it for ps4 also
This is insane, Marvel should stop making movies and focus on games
Whoaaaaaah
We don’t have much time,move  I lovvveeeee itttt
Bruh I was watching expecting gameplay but for me it felt like a movie.
The only grip for me is the swinging animations, they all looked the same
🤯🤯🤯👏
Is it me or they put Boozer as Kraven
“He’s gonna wish he never came to New York!!” Yuri really killed that line. I get chills every time I hear it.
Symbiote Peter almost exploded a Helicopter without even caring on saving whoever is there, no matter if it is hero or enemy... 😮
I might actually buy a Ps5 to play this game
Wingsuit WHAT?!
Ohh my poor poor computer
Kraven, interesting
i love how you can just tell how the symbiote is affecting peter both mentally and in his fighting style like hes more aggressive in both fronts, it can be seen in how he treats civilians like when he saved the man and just tossed him on the ground and in his fighting combos etc im gonna love this game
how do i like a video twice
So who’s playing Kraven the Hunter in this new game.
they used the voice actor for dyinglight 1's villain dope!
YOOOO THEY RELEASED THIS TRAILER ON MY BIRTHDAY
Anyone noticed dead pool in the map
The action dose is just for us 👌 Loved it And this is one of the best Venom costumes. It looks so realistic.
Oh boy !
I need this in my life
Looks pretty cool but the handoff and helper gameplay remind me of sonic and tails.
I can’t wait the last 2 spider man games are legendary and make you feel like Spider-Man the web slinging and movement  is so fluid and  satisfying
If it wasn't posted on  Marvel Entertainment or Playstation I would think it's fake
Dont tell me theres gonna be a Choice at the end😢
I really hope that's not the final HUD 😅
Very pog
2018 vibes is coming again😍
Nice little QTE simulator
So cool
wow
Well i guess marvel should quit movie industry and stick to making games. Or maybe they use some brain sell and learn how to make good movies again instead of garbage
This game's vfx is faar Better than she hulk 😅
when release this game?
The symbiote attacks feels like Spiderman Web of Shadows. Great game!
7:41-7:47 Very intressting dialogue…
Insomniac is doing better job at giving spiderman justice than Marvel
11:33 The bully Maguire moment
bPAAxEotAm
Calling it now. Venom is symbiote on lizard and not on eddy or harry osborne.
I love Spider-Man!
Pls make this on ps4 to PLS
Voila !! ils ont tout compris c'est ça qu'on veut voir quand on attend un jeu, pas une cinématique à la con sans gameplay. Maintenant on sait à quoi s'attendre avec ce jeu et perso j’achète direct !
wooooh breathtaking scences
Inb4 Peter Parker dies at the end of this game and is replaced by Miles in all future games
Peter be talking to miles like if he batman No chatting or none just straight to the point
this is crazy but why games are still graphically not exceptional yet. why rendered demos are so photo realistic but games still lag behind ?
Insomniac carrying Playstation right now.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
he sounds like Eren😭💀
Just watching the video in preparation for 3 years later when I can afford to buy it
VEJO VOCÊS EM 10 ANOS QUANDO QUISEREM REVIVER AS MEMORIAS DESSE JOGO
Well I'm going to have to get a ps5 now.
I like how the "Be Greater, Together" at the end can work both ways for Peter and Miles, and Peter and the symbiote.
Close to land "Help the tour boat" XD
OMG the Symbiote, the glider and as well the combat my man im in 2033 right now😂🎉
KRAVEN looks amazing. Gameplay makes me want to try it, and I don't play these games.😂
I freaking love it❤❤❤❤
This does not look like a PS5 exclusive, graphics is questionable
I love the fact that the listen to community and implement fking slingshot mechanic to the game. And wingsuit seems flawless.  I knew it will be good but , oh man... this trailer makes me smile from ear to ear
Cool, spiderblan 2, the greatest virtue signal of them all... until spiderwoman
Lizard is gonna be godzilla
The moment in the first scene kinda died when Peter rather weakly tugged that guy's gun about with normal webs between two big symbiote moves tbh, but the new animations look good and impactful at least. I feel like Mile's bio-electricity was a different colour previously too right? It just feels a bit too normal electric now too imo, so I'm hoping a customisation option lets us change the electricity colour.   This game's mechanics are like the strangest lovechild of inFamous and Prototype but with PS1 and PS2 peak spider-man
🔥🔥🔥
Well, Miles seems less annoying this time. I will hope he will stay that way
This has some real ... Shooookeerrrrr ... Youuu can't escape meeeee.... I'll chase you down to the ends of the earthhhh 🤣🤣🤣 ... Vibes for sure ! Definitely got that edgy darkness right ! Loooveee it !
That's not Peter. That's Sasuke Uchiha.
Spider man miles morales is better
2:43 Bro went face first into the pavement and bounced 6 feet into the air just to get slammed again. Ain’t no way he’s alive 😂
Loved the way Peter tossed that civilian at 11:33. Just shows how far the symbiote is corrupting him. Seems to me like Miles will be more of a hero than Peter in this and will carry this game even if Peter is the main protagonist.
I love Miles's little head movement after Peter snatches the tracker from his hand. It perfectly encapasulated "wtf man" with no words or facial expressions
It promises to be very nice. It will probably beat the first part from 2018.
Highly downgraded
How am I just now seeing this after 12 hours
Im so happy that they added a wingsuit for Peter and Miles. It looks so cool
All I’m saying, can you IMAGINE the DLC to come for this game after launch 🤩, we’ve got VENOM, Kraven, Lizard, there was a reference also to character like wraith, cat woman, think hammerhead was also referenced and a few others, hoping we get some continuity from the dlc events and see what happened, also noticed the time jump, wondering if that means we’ll get to play prior to the venom suit, allowing us to experience Pete’s first interactions with it etc. I suppose we shall see in time!
This is amazing!
show the faces you cowards, how does Pete's face look now, huh??
Game of the year
Wow wow wow,Can't wait to play this game 😍😃
BC Spiderman kaam aur Venom jyada lagra wo.....
Omg they can fly now?! The graphics are amazing abd game play too havent played miles morales yet  so dont know if the flying is from there but wow amazing wr finally know more about harry and the kraven story line is good i cant wait its gonna be epic
O……..m………G    Whe are in for a treat
Man, J. Jonah Jameson is gonna have a field day with this.
i wonder if in the mid-game miles will have to stop peter's symbionte madness. probably
Ambatkunnnnn
I love Miles
Gonna be a classic 🕷️ 💕
Am i watching a movie😅
Lets see who comes back here in 2030
ngl fighting for who plays who is gonna be crazy
literally the same game
Ooooooooooooo my God
Wow. Another home run from insomniac. Great job guys We’re all seriously excited to get our hands on this it looks fantastic. Everything I hoped for in the second game and the Pete venom acting is amazing. Guess I’ll go play spider-man remastered and miles morales again for the 10th time.
there is surely going to be a part when miles convinces peter to remove the suit and then peter is goings to rip it out like in spiderman 3
Is it gonna be an open world (New York) game like Miles Morales?
I am so glad and relieved that we got another spiderman game, I was so anxious that they would stop making more.
Looks like Pete is going down a dark path due to Venom. Also saw Wraith on the map. This means...
I like how the symbiote textures look. It’s not just a recolour but like a thick layer on him. It looks very shiny and less like a fabric
This looks badass.
The game looks beautiful but it seems that it's too easy. Where is the challenge?!
The music changed to Hip-hop when Miles was on-screen; nice touch.
I mightve soiled myself watching this
Where is Venom ?
I think this game is made on unreal engine 4 which makes it amazing
Bro at this point, The Lizard can go toe to toe with The Rhino, i mean look how big that creature is!
Bring to Steam
" Are you sure? He got big teeths, SO DO I " scared the hell out of me man.
I'll buy if you fix his face
They have to put Spider-Boy in everything, don't they?
I'm already in love with the symbiote suit
The combat of the black suit, as well as the aura that emanates from it, look really impressive, but the design of the suit itself is quite controversial. I hope there will be other variations of costumes.
Just as I expected, it’s freaking majestic 👌🏼
I think the symbiote might become attached to henry by the end of the game ormid game after miles defeats it removing it from peter
Bro is out for blood
When you remember that under the black suit it's the new face of Peter Parker, not the face which was used in the first release (2018) 🙃
Rest in peace to people who were waiting for this game since 2018 😢😢😢
I NEED A PS5
Marvel's Spider-Man 🕷🕸 2 | Gameplay Reveal in Marvel.
Judging from the fact that Peter already has the Symbiote, Im thinking this is the second act of the game or a flash forward of sorts. So either this stuff is gonna happen in the second half of the game, or we're gonna start with it, and then find out what actually happened later on.  Either way, IM HERE FOR IT!!!!!! The Venom suit already looks breath taking and it'll be even better if it comes off at some point and fuses with IDK Eddie maybe?, then Miles and Peter have to fight them together!!!!!! with the amount of characters in this, i don't even know who to expect as the final boss!!!! Insomniac never misses man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anyone else half expecting Spidey to start busting out Chidori and Susanoo 😂
このクオリティを遊んでいいんですか…？
Lol they got Lizard looking like Godzilla 1998. Still gonna be a great game.
Who remembers Web of Shadows?
This is INSANE 😳😳 guess I’ll need to get a PS5
2025 gang 👇🏻
PEAK INCOMING GUYS !!!!!!
Lmao the way peter jus lightly shoved that man at 11:33 and you could see how puzzled miles was since this was never how peter would treat anyone who hes trying to save. Really love that small detail with the arrogant behaviour coming out influenced by the symbiote. Looking forward to this game mighty.
I love how many love how comment for this gameplay.
I just noticed when miles fights those people one of them says - watch out for his “new” powers- does that mean miles got an upgrade? His powers do seem slightly more advanced than when we saw him in his spin off game
Remind me of prototype series
bully maguire?
10/10
As a spiderman  lover, this will be one of the most exciting  gameplay for me
Spidey’s sasuke is showing
peter went full unstant kill mode
Ich glaub ich bekomm nen Ständer
This game visuals is too good to handle. Will be returning after years when this game will become nostalgia to many.
I have a prediction on somethings for Spider-Man 2, but first I hope we have a truly amazing scene for when he gets the symbiote but my prediction is he grows more and more darker that eventually miles and Peter fight each other miles tries to tear the symbiote off of Peter but Peter gets the upper hand and beats miles/nearly kills him realizing what he has done Peter tries to get it off himself ( hopefully a Spider-Man 3 movie kinda situation, just no wimpy Eddie Brock) and that's how we will have Spider-Man vs venom  But yeah that's my prediction on the outcome, still all in all In looking forward to this masterpiece and hopefully G.O.T.Y
Hope there’s a rage meter for the black suit😮‍💨
I wonder if you can change the suit like in WoS
graphics watch dogs 1 lol
Oh oh somebody just took over the game ladder
Best game
God I can’t wait, this will be one of the games I will NEVER delete off my PS5, this game will be LEGENDARY
MJ missions in this game would essentially be hold L1+Triangle to scream for Pete or hold R1+Triangle to scream for miles and Start button to skip the whole thing and play as Peter or Miles😂
I can't wait for this game to come out!!🎉
Oh my God, I recognize the voice of Yuri Lowenthal from a thousand!
Insomniac just hit the spot with the marvel universe games, i hope someday they make an avengers game
xbox fanboys be crying rn hahaha
Krevin the hunter ❤
Professor "Peter you didn't keep any of it did you?"  Peter *munches on a cookie* "no of course not...pfff...hey, you got any more nuts?"
ps5 exclusive launch fml
PROTOTYPE 3
Sublime
Wtf with enemies ?? 😂 Only waiting not moveing 😂
6:15 опа неочікувано побачити такий величезний прапор 😮
Marvel Spiderman Game was my favourite game when I was kid, now I'm so happy because I see the second part of this game. It's incredible!
This was probably the worst game presentation of ps
Looks so good love the black suit 🔥🔥🔥you just can’t go wrong with Spider-Man games and I’ve heard people saying the voice is a character from a anime !
Let me know when it comes out on PC...
WTF... YOOOO 🔥🔥🔥😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯
🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥⁉️⁉️
3:05 that combo was so clean 😮
Lol a Kamehameha followed by a chokeslam
"it's got big teeth" "So do 8"probably the best line ever spoken by THIS spider man
This is phenomenal indeed
that looks more like "Marvel’s Spider-Man 3" robot dog, dinosaurs, lizard ...i perfer playing spiderman 2 from 2004 tbh.
The only thing that bugs me is that the dodge animations and swinging animations are the exact same, was hoping for some new ones
Once again Yuri kills it 🔥
Strange that he uses the symbiote to fight, not very spider-man of him, hope there’s an option to turn that off
The "So do I" part is still giving me chills 😨 And I LOVE IT 🤩 Shame I probably won't be able to play it since I only have a PS4 and probably won't ever get a PS5 🥲
Looking foward to the miles vs peter
LOVE ITTTT!!! (Wish I had a ps5 to play this tho *sad face*)
why isn't it playable at ps4
I need a Prototype Gane like the Venom suit 😊 Looking at Venom suit, Insomniac would make such a good Prototype Game.   Aahhh.
the real main villain is venom sp?
They got the spider glider in game now
12! minutes! the swinging and the motion give me chills. the cinematic scenes are so dope. and spider man’s symbiote powers are incredible. have a feeling miles and peter are gonna fight each other.    feels like a movie
11:31 i like how peter throws him instead leave them safely
Playstation 💙 💪 🥇
Can't wait
its so coollllllll
feel like way too much was shown here & it seems like the swinging got worse idk. by worse i mean you're just going straight while the webs are sticking to walls. they should have added advanced swinging & assisted for people that dont want to think about it because even web of shadows &  Ultimate had better swinging. really didnt like it in both Miles &  the first
The graphics should be much better , please working on it
I honestly like the change in Peter, I feel like it would be pretty tiring to have two quippy comic relief characters and it's nice to see Peter be more "no nonsense" especially after everything that happened in the first game
Tom holland
Шикарно!
Nice game. Can't wait
Watching use the symbiote as his combat reminds me of Shattered dimensions and web of shadows combat
JAJSHEBRBFJDJE THE SUIT LOOKS SO GOOOOOOODDDDD
I expect Pete and miles have a fight  My theory when the fight ends: peter goes back to normal and not agressive as he was in the symbiote suit and he doesnt remember anything while he was on the symbiote suit (most likely hes getting Controlled) just a theory if they had a fight🤷
Love the word play. "Be greater. Together". I think it's just up to player to decide with who - Miles or Venom?
Man the music at kraven is lit
Yuri Lowenthal channeling he's Sasuke performance for symbiote Spider-Man.
impressive
Android version please
waiting for this
Cant wait to play it in future ig
The black suit storyline is without a doubt my FAVOURITE storyline of anything ever. This looks incredible 😍
Web of shadows vibe😢
I love miles. But I’m never playing him when I got symbiote Peter as an option
🤔😁😁💩💩💩🤫
No he's never like that
I think it looks great but they should make some adjustments on the black suit and the moves could be even better.
Insomniac games is absolutely crushing it!! I remember when spider-man was pushed back from its original release date and being so furious!! Then playing it for the first time swinging to fisk tower, the joy i felt.. in that single moment I became so grateful  to this phenomenal  company and what they created for us I'm looking forward to this Game. I
I'll miss the Miles' orange electricity, but I'm so excited about this game
I hoped for Venom as an eneymy not that route...
That was probably the opening mission to the game right there.
Forget all that you see how he talked to miles racist
I hopes there's co op
Peter’s personality seems different. He’s more angry and aggressive not only towards the enemies but also the innocent humans. The symbiote infected him
*in j.j.jameson's voice*  I WANT MY SPIDER-MAN!!!!
I love the design but the lighting and texture on the venom suit is pretty off (its incomplete or poorly done; my humble opinion.) The water in all the cutscenes is trash, especially when Miles is behind the jet-ski while Connors is diving in and out of the water. Loved everything else.
My god I'm so excited for the PC port in 2026😭😭
VENOMMMMMMMMMM
hope you can choose between which peter parker face you want coz i liked the original one.
This is SO sick, what an improvement from the last one !
I like how miles is more like old Peter and Peter… is more like doctor Octavius… yeah this is definitely going to end badly
It's literally the same game with the same map with just new gameplay that's it,  *no hate*
I love when the Peter Parker Spider-Man bonded with the symbiote instead of the Miles Morales Spider-Man and they had a great team up since the beginning of their time. I hope we'll see Peter Parker and Miles Morales team up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in similar team up.
I hope that they let you re-use the symbiote suit after they more than likely get rid of it.
We need a deep and advanced difficulty mode and smart AI enemies and real boss fights and not just web ’em up beat ‘em up
Kravens design is insane
Do we get a bully macguire or just Spiderman being a mean guy in a black suit ?  Only time will tell.
amazing!!
peter aka sasuke?
Double takedowns?
Actually, I expect more graphics than this 😢
Spiderman 3 vibes
I would be lying if I said this gameplay footage didn't my d' hard!
OHH MY GODDD!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
графика не очень, если честно 😒
Peter parker sounds like Batman 🦇
As a PS4 owner with no PS5 and a very low chance of getting one I'm gonna be depressed when this drops😢
Man I can't believe I have to get ps5 to play this game
The wingsuit😍
Spiderman with the Black Suit is scarier than Venom Jesus Christ Peter, Batman would shiver if he had to fight against Peter with the Black Suit.
HE CAN FLY NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Must be hot wearing the suit and symbiote ../I’m not asking for spider testicals but maybe just short sleeves
amazing
Muito louco
Que Gameplay fodaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I really like this new Symbiote Spider-Man to the game ,, very excited and Looking forward to play as him .. and Miles powers here on this game is beyond incredible .. WoW
Raising the stakes with exponentially improved powers
This is what the Suicide Squad game should have been like and also Gotham Knights. Everyone needed to follow the Arkham formula expanded upon it and yet even the company that created it strayed from the path. This is the recipe for the best superhero games. So many story concepts ruined from the Avengers to Midnight Suns.
So Much EXITED To PLAY 😁😁😁
The starting bgm sounds like why so serious theme
11:50 the Symbiote suite looks $4.99 discount bin from Walmart. The Amazing Spider-man 2012/2014 had better version. Looks like the devs have gone back to ps(4-1) instead of forward to ps(4+1)😅when it comes to graphics. Extremely disappointing demo gameplay full of QTEs; is it a RE4 mod😂?
it feel like a Prototype game
web of shadow nostalgia
Let's go Insomniac Games!!!
Bros in his Sasuke phase 😂😂😂
Man why not ps4 it’s awesome though
Looks good
I love how feral Peter sounds in the black suit omg
will have to wait for the pc version... like always... lol
Well, that's how you make a sequel!
11:53 when he says so do I, the eyes change from normal spidey eyes to having slight tips foreshadowing venom eyes, gotta love the small details
I wish i had a ps5
How much?
who’s watching at 2033? i cant believe this game was 10years ago
It makes think that main boss fight will be against Peter. He became ruthless and uses brute force most of the time
I can’t even believe how much better this looks. They improved on a pretty much almost perfect game. The swinging and combat is perfect in every single way. I love how the symbiote is changing Peter’s attitude and voice in a way that it did to Spectacular Spider-Man. The little details matter and Insomniac just keeps putting out amazing product.
We'll get our second bully spider in this game
That's a cute outfit... 😊
I'll be here until this game ages and becomes a remnant in my memory
Thanks for the trailer
Can't wait  to see Bully Maguire in action
Ive never seen so many cranes on the water in my entire life maybe just one a small one
hi person from 2027, i'm graduated now but you're probably 12-13 or maybe even 30-40, i have nothing to say but it's nice you might've read this
i love seeing how the sybiote is affecting peter at the end
The little details in Peter's aggressiveness, with a very good voice behind it! I absolutely can't wait for this game
Gives me big web of shadows vibes, loved that games as a kid so very excited to see a web of shadows done right
Insomniac Games have outdone themselves again with this.
This is 1 of those games where you just buy it because you know it's going to be amazing . I really don't need to see more other than the release date.
the game just turned from 16+ to 18+
Fingers crossed for Symbiote-Lizard
Yet another wasted opportunity with not Split Screen (it was obvious, but that doesn't change the fact it sucks).  Graphics haven't been changed much.  The QTE segments are way too in your face with the slow motion added-- why not add a huge red circle and arrows pointing at the button inputs too??  Even though this version of SM is a veteran, he still has no knowledge of the most known villains... what?  In the previous game he mentions he's stopped train 2nd time (which is a nod to Sam Raimi's SM2), but somehow didn't meet Octopus yet??
The fight scenes in spider-man are just next level.
I already see the diversity bs they're gonna pull on this game. Peter gets controlled by thr symbiote. Miles has to kill him or watch him die. Then he is the new and only spiderman for all other games. These clowns never get tired of losing money until they have to close up shop. Nice ps1 fires btw
I love that you can glide now but that whirlwind tornado thing isnt exiting me it looks like fortnite
Hey future people yall probably weirder than us😂
Y’all hear how focused and aggressive Spider-Man is??? Bro miles and Pete are definitely going to have a fight
Now that is Black Suit Spider-Man, I’ve been waiting since the Spider-Man 3 game to see it again and it looks immaculate
Playstation hijacked Spider-Man's games.
Insomniac should always be the one making Spider-Man games
3:36 where did he hang from
This is amazing
Not for me. Dont like the concept for Spiderman 2. Too much bullshit
gjh
I might be too excited, but this is spider-man like I have never seen/read/played before, every detail seems to be done based on being true to the characters and their stories, I think there will be some messing around with the symbiote character and I believe it will add another layer to a great built world, I believe this will be a new height for Spidey/Sony and an absolute win for us the fans..
Omg this looks sooooo amazing and badass ! If Insomniac can do this with Spiderman imagine what they can do with a Mature Rated Wolverine and how badass that is going to be !
Prototype 3 that we never got
i hate the fact that I can't afford it....
No way Peter is sasuke
10:58 This is so Goosebumps!!! Epic Scene with 2 Spider Combinations
yeah the symbiote is affecting him, venom should show up and peter and miles will fight
hello rias from dying light
In 5 years I’ll be here, in 10 I’ll be pregnant. Remember me.
At 10:45 Miles saves the guy and his fish. True superhero right there..
I'm glad Queens is back, it's only been in one Spider-Man game before this one.
Game play looks like the last 3 Spider man games, and the voice actors are trash... so annoying
How much will the game cost?
Web of shadows remmastered anyone?
BULLY MAGUIRE IS BACK BABY!!
So many new features!!
I love Mile’s new powers but it seems to be a little much….l felt like it was watching Dragon Ball Z for a minute there lol
New York literally looks like New Orleans…. Giving infamous 2 vibes
Son yılların en iyi oyunu ❤️
its the suit thats changing his personality huh
I love how Ganke screams as his drone gets thrown at the gunship 🤣
Vfx better than Adipurush🤣🤣
Funnily enough i JUST redownloaded Marvels Spider man to replay it yesterday
The black suit looks likes it's gonna be some fun
I searched YouTube for “overhyped mid QTE game” and this came up.
So final boss fight would be miles vs symbiote peter
congratulations on spiderman 2 at sony showcase so hype for this game of the year contender & got a feeling could drop on day 1 performance rt mode
All aboard the hype train!!! 🙂. Man this looks good
This is already a movie!
this is gonna be the sickest game ever
The bait and switch playing miles morales i am not as exciting for....
Finally a worthy opponent to web of shadows after 15 years🤗
Gonna check back on this comment and see how life in general has changed.
Everything great, the only thing I don’t appreciate is the stealth part when Miles walks on the web lines. He is so visible and makes lot of noise but he don’t get caught. I hope enemies won’t be too stupid
spiderman has been and always will be my favourite hero ever since I first discovered heroes were as a kid and then from reading the comics in high school to now finally seeing a flawless sequel to a flawless game with characters that have not gotten enough attention until now that is, thank you marvel
2013 graphics
What spider-man has become… pathetic …
My jaw dropped like 7 times or something so this gets my jawdrop-stamp of approval.
I’m glad Kraven looks like classic Kraven and no gender/race swap “updated for a modern audience” nonsense. My biggest concern is the story being unfocused with two Spider-Men. My hope is it’s still mainly Peter’s story and game and Miles just pops up a few times. I don’t want a 50/50 constant swapping between characters. Spider-Man doesn’t have, nor should have, a sidekick.
I really hope there's a way to add the purple tint to the black suit. This look great tho
graficamente non mi ha fatto impazzire il primo era meglio
12:15 who’s laughing or screaming here ?
2014 graphics honestly. Looks like AC Unity visually.
I have a feeling harry osborn green goblin is going to be the main antagonist for the 3rd game
this bit 10:50 reminds me of The Host (2006) movie.
Insomniac just know what we want
This is boring
This was better than watching a movie... im going to enjoy watching people play this.
THE TRAILER IS INSANE.  - I love how the Symbiote suit looks slimy and Undone until it perfects its self to the Black suit AND i love how the suit looks still slimy plus in some places the suit has like Vains  - Black Webs and Slime tentacle Attacks. BONUS POINTS  - I like the brutality of Peter: his voice is full of hatred, he doesnt make jokes anymore, pacience is like none and he threw a civilian like he is garbage😂😂.  - YOU CAN F GLIDE THROUGH THE AIR BABY THE MOBILITY IN THIS GAME WAS ALWAYS GOOD BUT NOW ITS AWESOME.  - Kraven and the lizard look so crisp the designs are awsome.  Moles new suit is so cool i can see that peter is like a mentor to him he even copied  the gauntlet. Plus he looks like had some growing up since the last game  - The action scenes, grafics and stuff crispier than my Potatochips😂
remember me 10 years from now
i can't believe it's THAT bad
Edgelord Peter is back, baby! I can't wait for the pelvic thrust dance to make its grand return
TAKE MY MONEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
❤❤
Oh my god
Very excited!
12:20 Love the ending tagline: *_BE GREATER. TOGETHER._* With the symbiote tentacles beginning to swarm and cover up the word "TOGETHER" - than Miles bio-electicity clearing them away.
Can we not a have a game with miles? Im sick of him, i just want to play as peter parker, the original black spiderman
Kraven looking dope af
Kraven seems like the hero hahaha want to play as him
Finally, The Prototype 3!!!
Miles' new moves set looks really cool. Can't wait!
Dr.Conners became mini Godzilla
its fire
ITS ALL I EVER WANTED
this is sick man this is mine blow ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
IM CRYINGGGGGGGG
OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD I LOVE THIS WITH ALL MY HEART😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
2023 is insane. 3 fnaf trailer and now this? oh my lord
I hope they reference   “GET BACK HERE SHOCKER! SHOCKER!!! YOU CANT ESCAPE ME! ILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!!!!!!!!”
Web of shadows vibes! This looks amazing!
As if this isnt available on PC too....
Claim your before famous ticket here
WOW MY DREAMS GAME to bad i cant get it😢
Excellent 😍😍
Looks like a 2018 game
Why. Feels like at first they are hunting Wolverine?
Nice basketball reference
Peter got improved combat and miles got improved traversal and wingsuit and better at his power  This is epic And also make paths for urself in combat I like how venom peter have tentacles coming out and the amount of symbiote on his body is also changing depends on how much symbiote he use  Cool details  And peter looks creepy when he just crash through the roof of the fish market
If the story is good, I can see this being game of the year. Amazing game detail and crazy combat
POV: You are here after 3 years and amidst all the games released since then, this is still a masterpiece. 😮
I love the extra touch of miles not even sensing Peter when he comes crashing down thought the roof. Hope that's convenient in the game like in the comics♥️♥️
Really hope we get a Symbiote Peter Boss fight in the game in seems like it’s heading towards that direction insomniac is never failing to amaze us🔥
5:30 cake😮😮😊
Gonna be alot of dirt in some eyes
This is going to be a big big step up from the first 2 games. The water looks awful though, hope they fix that up, also during the stealth gameplay it looked like Miles was taking those guys out pretty loudly and visibly and yet the other enemies didn't hear or react at all.
This gave me immense nostalgia! I can't wait to play as dark-suit spider-man again.
Just take my 💰 now
This game loooks absolutely fire 🔥, these new Spider-Man games / DLC’s do not fail to go hard each & every time they come out for real
Оооооо да... Игра будет шикарная. Жду на ПК :)
Its a good day to be a PlayStation player
Yo, it so cool
Nice)
I did not expect that . This looks phenomenal .
Can’t wait to relieve this game again in the future🫡
Have to wait many years to play since I'm pc user
Very excited not to be able to play this on PC!
Hell yea so keen for this
Possible game of the year?
cant wait to play this in like 5 years when it comes out on pc. Besides that, Miles Morales gameplay ♥♥♥ I was worried it would be a Peter only game!
If you like marvel please like
I love how at the end the symbiote is trying to cover the word together but Miles' ability destroys it
That's a very great game but also want to play it on PC asap
Ahhh, I guess they will release kraven the hunter around the same time then. Looks really cool 🙂
this got Marvel Avengers Hud type of sh-
Wow so mutch buyed rewies here 😂, even the top 100 right now can be googled and you will see how the bud the commentary to manipulate you.  The first game was 6/10 but this one will suck and you all will see it. 4/10 will this game when it cames out.
Will this game be available on pc along with the official release?
web of shadows 2?)
I could totally imagine this edgy Peter screaming “SHOCKER ILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!”
Hope that I can save money for ps5
The gameplay and story are shaping up to be just as good if not better than the first but all be ready, my glorious main man Taskmaster is back!
Oooh this is gonna be fun
The plot will definately involve miles vs angry peter, given symbiote rage and all.
I wish this game is available cross-platform so everyone can experience being Spiderman in whats going to be an amazing story. Marvel please let this game be on pc and xbox
I dont really like the look of the symbiote suit it looks like they put leather padding on his shoulders i think i see what they were trying to do but it came out a little off and also the tendrils when they manifest out of the suit look really lazily animated and too simple the finisher mocap looks cool though for sure
10:00 why doesnt he just zip up to the bridge. lol
as it is still a prototype I hope they show some improvement in the animation style
11:53 why does suit looks like a ps3 game model
Is that the voice of Sasuke for Peter??
See you in 10 year when someone wants to relive memories of this game
Bisa di ps 4?
Every time I hear Yuri as Peter I can't help but think Sasuke Uchiha is under the mask  😂
Im not big on the lizards design but other than that looking solid 9/10
Can't wait 😂😂 I gonna sell my home and buy this fantastic game😂😂😂😂
Yuri lowenthal channeling the rage of the uchiha with this one
Hello random human from 2025
Hopefully there's a bully Maguire scene
I noticed when Peter threw that one civilian down Miles turned his head and looked at him like "Really man? Not cool"
Symbiote suit has a Prototype feel to it.
stuffiness
This game better include the S tier line "You can't escape me, I'll chase you to the ends of the EAAAARTH!!!!!"
5:00 did he just kameHame'd that guy?
I didnt play the last game only thr first can someone explain when he got thr Symbiote or does it happen in this game im confused
This showcase was one of the best birthday presents ever for me yesterday 🥹🫡❤️
I was at work during the Showcase, and the second I saw Kraven I knew. We were all huddled around my phone watching this 😂
The music at 3:40 went hard with that scene just sayin
I was here not sure where but here
Now I wonder;  1. So Venom (Harry) would be our first boss? I honestly want him to come back later too, that design looked sick af.  2. Will we be able to change Pete's suits with the symbiote?  3. Miles and Peter are definitely fighting later in the game.
Yay Peter’s symbiote arc this’ll be fun and probably heartbreaking to see unfold
I really want Martin lee to return here
Please where can I get the game, and what system is good for the game thanks.
Is that sasuke
Can't wait to play'em 💛
The low quality and lack of denseness of water is disappointing.....
🔥🔥
I'm sorry....but this is a little disappointing to me. Not much graphical development is visible, I would have expected much more
Hopefully we get a Spider Gwen in this one. And next we have Spider-Man: Gwen Stacey, then we play as three Spider-Men/women in 3.
beauty 😍
Truly disgusted with myself at how many times I’ve watched this video today. Just today
When Marvel's spider man 2 releases on pc?
HYPE ASF
The background music is from spiderman 1 and other sequel is good...well made title .hope full game will turn out to be BEST.
Naww miles gave that soldier the 2099 choke slam 💀💀💀
Why to force 2 Spider-Men, I mean, it’s good to make different story about a character but why to force it and combine it?!? 2nd this not a Batman game come on 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
I love the little detail of Peter just dumping that civilian on the ground and dismissing them instantly, usually even during the most intense fights he’ll be careful with civilians and check on them after setting them down, or lighten the mood with a quip.
for me its a nitpick but i hope we can turn off the rpg l1 r1 attack squares hud at the bottom, i just think id rather know the button to press for an attack and leave more space on my screen for the actual game not just hud
Meet me after 10 years
I’m ready 👀
oh my f**k god this is awesome krawen hunter the game is more brutal i'm not surprised that in some country a map will be opened for 18 years and this dry climate will fit into other games with spidey and venom that makes peter not himself from the first part totally different atmosphere can't wait
Eeeeeh hola? Aquí tenéis todos mis billetes! Jajajaja! Pero q obra maestra!
Graphics looks much worse than previous spider man game .😅
Rip ps4 guys (me)
Finally! They're on the same level with symbiote as Web of shadows
the gamma looks like tasm 1,2 game and graphics looks worse then miles morales and marvel spider man
Miles Morales looks a lot better than this game.
why some people are saying its graphics looks like ps4 game ??? all i can see is ray tracing is on !!!
Prolly the symbiote takes over Pete and we(as miles) get to fight Pete in his symbiote
Lest be honest, this video it’s way more better that full Morbius movie 😂😎
Lizard will be there 2?
THAT’S A MASTERPIECE
Is this free
We’re not eating, we’re FEASTING 😮‍💨
This is fire, but I hope they fix the npc’s in nyc tbh. That was one thing I hated about the other two games, hope they make them not so npc yk.
Omggg I can't wait 🤤😩
Why can’t the movie adaptations of Spider-Man get this good.. at least make a live action show.. multiple seasons, multiple villains
The use of the same animations is a bit disappointing
Is that Boozer from Days Gone?
I sense a boss fight between miles and peter. Because peter is definitely going to spiral out of control with the symbiote. This game is going to be amazing also love how the symbiote is already taking a toll on peter.
People hoping this game has a moral/morality system with the Black Suit like Web of Shadows did, that would be so sick if it did
I hope this has an option to remove those white web zip icons and L1+R1 trashcans ...  Otherwise impressive!
cant wait to play on pc
The gameplay and traveling definitely improved just like Arkham City did for Asylum
Imagine if the symbiote corrupts Peter to much and people get a Miles vs Peter boss fight it could go down as one of the best fights in gaming history
This… is… the… best… thing… I’ve… ever… seen…. My jaw is on the floor. Finally something more exciting than any movie out recently any game or anything.
Bro the web wings, the comic black suit, everything is looking so clean!
Is this a spiderman game or a miles game?
This looks soooooo cool man I'm ready for this!!!!
, wow ❤ amazing work, looks freaking awesome, it’s gonna be an amazing experience gameplay experience in fall 2023 and other games like it, like watching a movie scene from the beginning, the Lizard , Kraven the Hunter and many other villains being revealed closer to release that , not including dlc content , continue working on great games in the future
miles really did a kamahamaha into a ground slame
This spider man's voice gives me Sasuke's vibes. Angry and dark . Just like him . Yuri loventhal is just great to accomplish this
Hopefully it’s not a PlayStation exclusive…
Can’t believe how good this game looks
Hopefully this version of the symbiote won't make Peter go emo.
We waited so long, for this crap
I wish this was the new mcu
What can I say…. I’m inlove 😍
for nearly 2 decades i have wondered how sonys first party titles always outclass everything else. even pc.
Totally impressed.. hope😢 now it comes for the PC too ..
Looks sick, but im expecting some fighting changes as well as swinging, so far i didn't see much difference in Peter's swinging , specially with the simbiote. Hopefully its different.
Oh my god It's amazing
I know it’s a Spider-Man game but having black cat as a playable character would be sick
I WISH A NEW PROTOTYPE 3
Let’s goooo
Black spiderman's way of fighting "power"  reminds me of that game prototype
Can't wait for miles vs peter .
God, I'm in love
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
I really like the designs of Kraven and The Lizard in this game so far. Looking forward to seeing what Venom will look like as well.
My god this looks good
IS THAT RAIS??!??!!!!??!!!
is something wrong with the graphics of the enviroment and the symbiote suit ? or its just me ? 🤔
WHY THEY DO MILES LIGHNING BLUE :(
Kraven and The Lizard? The boss battles in this game are going to be next level!
What kind of engine that the developer is using? Looks really good.
anche per ps4 pls
So were not gonna talk about how peter tossed the guy after saving him 11:32 😭😭😭
The way yuri delivers the line at 3:00 is sooooo good
I love the design of the lizard, he's huge and scary, much similair to arkham series croc and i already know hes gonna be a cool boss
I can’t wait
MILES AND PETER HAVE RICO RODRIGUEZ WINGSUITS HELL YES
Nice
This looks fantastic, nothing more nothing less than what the folks are working with at Insomniac.
Wow, what a reveal trailer, felt like I was watching a movie!
I wish after you beat miles morales you would unlock a couple missions where you play as Peter and Miles as a little teaser for this game
I used to play Spider-Man when I was 88 years old. Now I'm 19, still a classic
Insomniac got some solid artists there
Shocking terrible showcase but this looked all right.
Just predicting what if miles has to fight Peter at the end due to the venom symbiote mind jacking him
That ending of "Be greater. Together" is a great foreshadowing. The word "Together" gets enveloped by the symbiote only to get zap by a lightning. Pretty much saying to us that Miles will definitely help Peter take off the symbiote from him.
OMG 😲
This looks horrible. Did they devolve the graphics?!
no pc lol what a joke
Very Impressive 👏
When can I throw my wallet at Insomniac? This game looks amazing!!!
I love the little look Miles gives Peter at 11:33 after he just tosses the civilian to the ground and doesn’t even ask if he’s okay before getting back to the task at hand. Miles can tell something isn’t right and that Peter isn’t himself.
Amazing looking game .
At 11:36 I believe that when Peter says "He got away from us", by "us" he means himself and the symbiote. Peter pretty much doesn't acknowledge Miles' existence except when he has to and also when he says that, Miles is not in the same shot with him. So Peter just sits there alone and says that to himself. And the symbiote.
Come on please release early
This looks amazing 😍
This is INSANE
why are graphics not improving
Doooope
Sadly i cant play this masterpiece
The new gui looks good but for me the old gui is better :)
The black suit abilities are so fvcking cool. i cant wait!
game of the year secured
If they pull off venom right, this’ll be one of my top games of the year for sure.
So when is this coming out ima buy like 10 of them, this is so good😭😭
web of shadows flashbacks ;)
Insomniac, you better recreate Kraven's last hunt CB cover!!
Imagine if the symbiote corrupts Peter to much and we get a Miles vs Peter boss fight it could go down as one of the best fights in gaming history
Am I the only one who thinks Miles should have his own name, like with the Scarlet Spider, having two Spider-men is just confusing, it would be like if Nightwing called himself Batman AND still worked out of Gotham, although in Batman's caser it would make sense, since he works on fear, and appearing like he can be in two places at once would help with that. But Spider-man doesn't need that, so it just goes back to being confusing, there's a reason we call Miles by his real name, because it's how we discern between the two, but how do those who don't know Miles is Spider-man?
I play Xbox but getting a ps5 just to play Spiderman❤
This is awesome. I am going to pre-order this game once possible. I love both previous games too but this one will be a new level.
11:54 so do i
Fly like a superman
A bit disappointing, same animations except for symbiote...some new animations for point of launch,   flying trough the city...the story will be 10/10
I cannot wait to play this!
روعه وربي متى تنزل بسسسسس
I like how the symbiote mask looks, it looks like padding that resembles a mouth
I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate but I have to say I'm not impressed with what I'm seeing here. It looks like a PS4 game. Horizon forbidden West looks way better and is a cross gen game.
hype, HYPE
Cant wait to mash the same two buttons with zero skill and let the game play itself again. I also cant wait to hear, "it makes you feel like spiderman," because you cant think of anything good to say about the game
This looks amazing so far! Can't wait for the full release and I LOVE that Kraven is becoming the main antagonist for this game!
Can't wait for this to hit PC
Completed it mate
the black suit looks like flash thompson they should change that
It will come to PC when RTX 6090ti is released
Hi
Xbox players need to be able to play this. I have a PlayStation but this game should NOT be an exclusive :l
this looks dope the blaring spidersense around Peter’s head the color turned also red
All I hear is Sasuke when Peter gets angry
Game of the year for sure
Venom and two other villains? Could this be Spider-Man 3 done better?  Actually, Kraven and Lizard were in the Spider-Man 3 video game too!
I’m calling it now. Spider-Man is going to get corrupted by the symbiote and is going to have a boss fight with miles.
We can play this game for PS4 ?
Why can’t they release this on ps4 now I’m gonna have to buy a ps5 ffs
Insomniac Please don't usr FSR
Feels like 2018 again. The year of great Spiderman content
Peter with venom looking too cold
11:34 Just look at small detail when peter throws the guy and how miles reacts
HOLY
This gameplay is way too much for my small brain to process. Just gonna say I'm beyond exited to play this when it comes out
I have a feeling like in this game eventually peter will become a villian to miles the more he gets attached and obsessed with the symbiote
Need him to shout "get back here Kraven!!!!! I'll follow you to the ends of the Eeeeaaaaarth!!!
3:02 ''he is gonna wish he never came to newyork'' do you all hear the pure rage and anger or am i insane ?
And they are trying to sell me on LOTR: Gollum hahahah! This looks 10x much better than Gollum, its not even comparable.
OMG this demo play make me sickkkkk , Like watching black suit so hard coreeee , can't wait this game comeout
Daamm this is fire🔥
They finally added the rope walking
lmfao look at the enemies, theyre just standing there looking forward and nothing else
That last dialogue by Peter reminds of Tobey Maguire Spiderman 3 venom .Marvel playing with nostalgia again
3:10 i did not expect the symbiote to make Peter THAT aggressive 💀
I wanna hear him say "IM AN AVENGER" with that aggression tone
Hello 2028 kid
Spiderman 2, AC Mirage, and Payday 3 are coming out this year no way I'm having a GOTY
This game will be legendery
So I'm guessing they're following the first game's design, with Craven being the first main villain and then after he's defeated we get Venom. It was a good way of building up the story and not forcing the main main villain into it from the start.
Yuri sounds PISSED 👺
This looks amazing!
Love it
That was awesome
All people use steroid in this game
i wonder how many in the comment section are 30+  or is it all kids now a days?
game of the year 2023
Hopefully the graphics aren’t finished yet
6:47 Duuuude, I just love this new Peter 💯
Man that UI is just not appealing
Lizard looks like Godzilla.
You already know what Peter meant when he said "He got away from us."
Pete really feels like you're playing Prototype. Man, can't wait  Also, 4:30 finally we have those web lines you could walk on
3:10 MUDA MUDA MUDA !
When Miles says, "Sure ? he's got big teeth" & Pete replies with, "So do I" you can notice his lense shape changing into shape of Venom's eyes shape 🥺 Idk how can I wait till fall 2023 to play this masterpiece !!!
I remeber playing spiderman web of shadows when i was little. And that... Does put a smile on my face
That escalated quickly…
Spider-Man feels like sasuke but more angry 😅😂
npc has some ps3 graphs
Ah man.. I really wanted to see sandman in the sequel.. I don't think he's in the game tho
Hello everyone in 10 years time..
I hope they will use ps4 version Peter's face
I'm quite excited for this game, but I don't really like the black suite, i hope there will be other versions
I need Dr. Michael Morbius aka Morbius and Frank Castle aka The Punisher in this Most Anticipated and Must-play AAA Superhero single-player or coop video-game, Marvel's Spider-man PS4/PS5 sequel video-game.
Here Leaving my mark
ohhh you outdid yourselves!
Kraven the Hunter is a new villain in upcoming Spider-man game the same year we get a Kraven the Hunter movie...
Kraven looks like Damien Sandow from WWE lmao
I'm gonna be very disappointed if the wall is not in this game.
VENOMMMMMMMMMMMM
Just imagine the haptic feedback on the Dualsense controller while playing as Symbiote Spider-Man
IA on this kind of games is pretty stupid 😂
Love that I see this Peter/Spider-Man’s growth and changes, but also hear a certain pissed off young Uchiha when he fights. 😂 Lol. Can’t wait. 🔥🔥🔥
I'm so excited for this game.
The game would even more better if petes swinging style were different than the previous game.
I can watch this all day.
I love how even though these charscters and villains are decades old, Insomniac uses them in a fresh an unique way that creates an originak story that still feels original!
I hope they add "GET BACK HERE SHOCKER!! SHOOOOOOCKEEEERRRR! ILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EAAAAAAAAARTH!"
Dammm I’m hyped
Cant wait!!
Did miles just Kamehameha?
Miles is gonna have to fight Peter and that’s gonna be a sick boss fight icl
Love it it’s like web of shadows
Did he teleport??? 4:54
Here’s a prediction miles will get the symbiote in the game and Peter is going to fight him spider man 3 all over again I can see that happening for sure.
This game is giving me serious nostalgia of Web of Shadows. I've always praised that games action sequences and combat style for being incredibly fun and this game looks like its gonna blow that out of the water. I can't wait!
Miles vs Peter in Spider-Man 2 I called it
Bully Maguire. We meet again.
YESSSSS!!!!!!! Just as I hope, we get to play as both Miles n Peter Certain parts will have u play as Peter or Miles This game is looking good
Something you may miss. When Peter tells Miles "So do I!" The symbiote changes in the eyes to show similarities to Venoms eye patterns.  The details in this game. They made this with love....cant wait. This will interest me into getting a PS5 lol  Another one is when Peter saves the person, he just tosses him to safety and Miles looks like it crooked like dude come on...
11:32 look how peter just tosses the person on the ground after saving him. He's definitely more aggressive under the symbiote, not just to his villains.
So no coop huh?
This might be the first game I preorder in years, it looks so good!
this looks like a ps3 game but i hope the graphics get better during launch
When u have a Xbox and won’t be able to experience this 😢😢😢
11:30 😅
bruh that is not lizard that's trex
im hoping that wolverine would be in this game (web of shadows vibes) frrr
just fvckin take my money!
They went hard with this gameplay reveal
A VERY BID DETAIL! If u guys can see in 1:28 that is wrath. If u guys played the first spiderman ps4 game you guys wouldve known it ia yuri watanabe who is behind the villian. Maybe we will fight or see her in the new game?
BRO’S A MENACE! I LOVE THIS IM BUYING A PS5 JUST FOR THIS GAME
Dayum... I just bought PS4 last week.
Gliding without loosing altitude is pretty shitty though. There is a reason I wanna play a Spiderman game and not a superman game.
This is amazing! Peter sounds much more aggressive, fights much more aggressive, isn't chatting much with Miles, is still saving civilians but not with the same amount of care as before. The look of the suit is awesome, the powers look awesome, Miles new fighting style is great too!
I love the venom suit is not all detailed which keeps the symbiote's nature in check because it is all mess.
See you in 10 years when it finally releases on PC
Sometimes I regret being an Xbox player
Man i wish this was in ps4 as well...
this looks amazing
The moves and powers in this one are INSANE! So freaking awesome.
11:33 man I love that kind of subtle touches to this game and to Peter’s character. See how Peter put that guy down? He didn’t care if the guy fell or not, he wasn’t careful with him at all. Sure he saved him and put him down “safely”, but it seems like he wasn’t thinking about his well-being in any way beyond that. I look forward to what his character arc has in store :)
why is the voice acting so bad bruh
This is sick
WE CAN BREAK SPINES IN THE SEQUEL 💀
Man the level designing is best 😁😀😀
This looks like the best Spiderman movie we never had! It looks amazing!
Looks so good lmao
they are gonna remake kraven’s last hunt in video game this is gonna be insane be ready to watch spiderman’s worst humiliation
All I hear is Sasuke being emo again
i could watch another hour of this.
Paid comments 💀
Looks amazing. Hopefully they got rid of peters twink face from the remaster and miles morales tho.
This looks like it is going to have a sub plot where Miles realises what Peter is becoming and tries to save him. It looks incredible so far!
Bro I'm so light headed right now. This game gonna give me a heart attack when it cone out.
The symbiote suit looks freaking awesome. The new abilities look amazing. The mission design looks spectacular.  As always... it's going to come down to story. Are they going to respect the legacy characters? Or dump all over them to prop up the tokenized ones? Spectacle only holds for a short time. Substance is everything.  Here's hoping Insomniac can pull it off.
This was literally jaw dropping to me. Lookes insainly amazing 😁
اللعبه فخمه
Shoutout to guy who puts anything in his mouth..
Bro turned into Alex mercer 💀
Spiderman looks like hes the villain necause of hes attacks
11:32 really? :D
@11:32, just the subtle details about Parker's new aggression
Praying you get to play as Venom in this🙏
Man.. I wanna see Sergei in an MCU movie
Frickin…AWESOME!!!
oynuyamıcaz ki anca izleriz
Game of the Year loading..........
Какая то смесь Человека-Паука и Прототипа) в это мы играем…
Insomniac Games is the best thing to happen to Marvel, let alone Spider-Man.
I really enjoyed the first game, but I've never been a fan of Miles Morales - or indeed any young sidekick character in comics.
The first scene is reminiscent of Thanos killing Loki! The second shot of the tree hints to Venom, you can see his eyes! amazing!
Gotta love the strong Prototype influence in the symbiote gameplay.
Definitely getting some [Prototype] vibes from the combat system in this game.
When’s this out
Venom better be the scariest mf ever
Also, i liked miles with the electro orange, i don't think that the blue match him
Whoa! Love this. Can't wait for the game. The Uncharted-like action bits are awesome!
The story feels way darker than the previous ones : when Miles is looking for Lizard In the dark building with dead fishes all around, it is creepy in a fantastic way!
Just don’t take this game to dark and horror or evil, keep it simple and enjoyable no one needs more devilish games
But we HAVE to play as Miles....? I really hope there's a point, preferably narrative-wise 'cos I didn't pick up the Miles DLC specifically because I don't care for Miles Morales. But black suit moves? The temptation is strong.
10years i hope i would be alive at that time to play this game
Pure excitement
Prototype 2 vibes
Good to see enemy ai is still blind and deaf in the miles part 😂
Please, Please, Please bring back the older more weathered Peter from the first one. We don't need another Tom Holland look for this Spiderman and it really clashes poorly with his story and relationship with Miles. Just an option to switch the character model would be enough, it really grates otherwise.
The exaggerated swagger of a black teen and a symbiote are a duo not to be messed with
Wonder what the Cops were doing while all of this was going down
Amazing...really impressive 😍😍
Potentially Game of the Year
3:37
can't wait for this, i'm so hyped
Can't wait for the PC release of this game so I can put the 1994 TAS Symbiote suit.
They should’ve saved this script and cast for Tom holland.
Worth waiting for a trailer and not watch any 'leaks' but can't wait for the game now
6:34 when she goes down on you and sucks the tip before you're even ready
The graphics are like Fortnite lol. And the gameplay doesn't look appealing, at all actually. What a sad era. I guess I'll keep waiting for the next game of From Software.
Hello guys I am from 2023🙃🙃🙃
Seek God. Its not about religion its no about rituals its not about hipocrisy or about a cheap philosophy of life. Its about communion with God Himself, Creator of all existing things, from the smallest atom to the biggest star. Everything has the Hand of God. I know that few will read this message and even fewer will be impacted by it but if you've read this far i heartly advise you to seek the Lord, who died for you took the guilt of your sins, and is willing to forgive you and accept you regardless of who you are, or what you have done. It's your decision. You have the free will to do whatever you want! God bless you bro ❤️if u havent consider repenting bro its soooo worth it luv u all❤️❤️Jesus 🔛🔝
I'm hoping the game allows me to be the anti-hero Venom wants me to be. It won't. But allow me my wishlist.
Sick !
I liked everything in this video except that miles venom power colour was blue like I miss the orange
this's gonna be brutall!!!
Meh
Love it. Amazing. Wonder if this ‘symbiote’ is an Ultimate-style Venom suit. Maybe a Devil’s Breath derivative of sorts as the first game suggested? I have a soft spot for Ultimate Venom, and this game seems to be taking him in that more monstrous, man-made and man-eating direction. Harry’s cool, but I do hope we at least meet Brock for future installments. Also, I hope we get Venom gameplay a la OG Ultimate Spidey. Thwipping around and devouring enemies and pedestrians alike. A nerd can dream.
11:51 coldest response peter gave 🥶
How did Peter get infected by the symbiote?
The graphics sheesh I love the team work and the suits
Me watching this while owning an xbox 👁️👄👁️
Please bring og Peter back tho, the more heart felt parts of the game will not be the same with the boyish Peter we have now, like he's supposed to be an experienced spider man
That Spiderman vs spideyvenom gonna be sickk
So most marvel projects have let me down the past few years… here’s hoping this is the long awaited start of the redemption arc for marvel!
I wish the ending would have the suit take over Peter and then he wipes out all. Craven lizard. purposefully. Any other antagonists. Then miles at the very end, perhaps not intending but once he sees how far he's gone and how much damage done to morales, he shrugs, finally ceding himself to the parasite. Even before his head is ripped from his body, miles eyes, one almost shut, are an entirety of disbelief and, staggeringly, hope.   "Cmon man" he croaks thru his broken cheeks.  His top lip is gone, revealing jagged, ruined teeth bathed in crimson foam. A tremendous effort,  he expels another pink mist the words congeal"this isnt y-" Peters deadened eyes relflect nothing. His expression doesn't change as he wrenches miles bleeding skull from his narrow shoulders.   He tosses it away, just garbage to him. Again no reflection of who he once was. Not a single sorrowful thought graces what's become.of his mind. He has no thought for the future or past, even of itself, other than the one.  In the now, he realizes he is ravenous.  In this, finally a spark of interest, lights the moving dark that is now him, coils and coils.    So many possibilities..........
THIS WAS INSANE 7:53
i'd love to watch this as a movie or series
Miles: “You sure, He’s got big teeth” Venom: “So do I”
THE GRAPHICS- MAN ITS AWESOME
my god never wanted to buy the ps5 so much in my life rn
Insomniac please for the love of God... Have an option in accessibility to remove the finisher camera and slow motion effects... It keeps the pace of the fight and always keeps finishers fresh when making your own angles with the camera, and it also makes it faster to strategize your next move and target while the finisher is going on... Thank you... Like please to get this to the top!
RIP Xbox
Insomniac should be the only studio to make Marvel video games. PERIOD.
Finally a game thats gonna light our moods
BEANS
W
web of shadows babyy
Couple dlc N i will purchase 😊
Seems like the Bully arc of PS5's Spider-Man has begun....😈
woke a$$ game disgusting
SPIDER MAN DOESNT THINK I KINDA HATE THT
ok but is no one going to talk about how Pete absolutely stepped on that guy against the wall?? That goes hard
will Peter do the dance?
ついに来たか👍
Amazing!!!!
I sincerely hope they improve the web swinging on parts where you're about to touch the ground, instead of hovering spiderman, he should run on the ground for a few seconds similar to the old games
Potentially Fan Theory Spoiler-Altert. Something tells me Miles is going to face Peter as the Main Boss at the End by trying to get the Symbiont of Peter.
So they have to handle leaven hunting the lizard and a bunch of other villains and heroes, aswell as the fact they’ll have to fight venom by the end of the game
@3:41 I keep rewinding, his intoxicating black swagger is immense
I dont like the flying. Swung once on a web then travelled half the city using the wingsuit
what's the optimisation like?
They made the free roam seem even more like free roam
if only every superhero game was like this wow
Well, over the symbiote, they certainly did a good job of interesting to see Harry Osborn.
Take my money.
See you later hen people rewatch this and compare to final release
I didn't like that much the symbiote suit design
I know we have not seen much but i am a little dissapointed with the swinging, it's so similar to what we got in the past games.
Symbionte spidey is so brutal I love it
mann i wish this was on ps4,sure it would have worse graphics but ps5s are so rare i check everyday and theyre out of stock always
Definition of perfect
I’d love to see this on PC at the same time as PlayStation, but if it’s not I likely won’t be picking it up
11:54 "so do I" while the eyes change to Venom's 🖤😩
2,8 milioni views  in 10 hours what you want more what you want more shhh im eating my guts more than God Of War im on Xbox x 😔😔😔.
So In the marvel spider man 2 we got Conners,kraven the hunter, and venom
Bye bye salary
When is this game coming out again?
The combat animation and effects worth getting this game
Too good to be true
This is beyond perfect
all super good changes so far great job with the symbiote look and feel and loving the new changes to traversal so far looks like it'll be the best one yet
Rip PS4 PLAYER 💀
Can't wait to play this in 4-5 years on my PC!
This game is gonna be DOPE. Can’t wait to play it 25/8
What TF is that water graphics, I was expecting better…other than that looks alright
I love how we all are loving this
Looks like Prototype
Peter still has the old web swinging
So it is no coop?
This game looks sick af man. They are making me regret buying a mid spec laptop intead of ps5. My lapt could hardly run Spiderman remastered I can't hope to play this at all
I’m really happy how this symbiote is coming along. It seems like it influences him instead of being an annoying separate character that literally tells him to kill ppl and stuff.
bro stopped pulling his punches 😯
Webbing not changed at all
With 750K people watching live. This brought a smile to my face
Berençe uyın — şäp ide. Däwamı uş kitmäle bulırĝa oşap tora. Kötep qalam!
It is like sequel to ps4 Spider-man and remaster of Web of Shadows, I am hyped
Idk venom suit is not best looking
I swear that’s Brian Quinn gettin killed at the start
BIGGER MAP OMG
everyone talking about symbiote but not the hobgoblin?
Bro 1st graphics batter
11:52 the subtle eye change on 'so do i'
The first one on kraven's list is black cat....that makes sense why peter is soo pissed at kraven.
Hi future me,do you remember how excited you were for this to come out?
There gonna have a conflict between each other
this felt like tlou E3
The more I look at it, the more it reminds me of prototype 2... Man I want more of it ...
this looks incredible... the new powers and gameplay, the GRAPHICS, and symbiote??? oh my god, this game is going to go dark. I can feel it. I'm so excited.
When would i be so rich that i could buy a pc and play this game 🥹
This looks amazing! Peter's venom suit reminds me of Web of Shadows
Woah is the map gonna be bigger?
Looks ok but not very realistic... not enough cranes! 😂
Got me real hyped 😭🤞🏻
The switch thing... should have been coop. and should have been Scarlet Spider. Ben Reilly is so much cooler than ..          oh 'miles Morales.
We might being seeing game of the year right here
Looks like I must buy ps5 to play this
I really hope Shocker has time until fall 2023 to run like Usain Bolt BECAUSE IT'S COMING FOR HIM!
The queens part reminds me a lot of spiderman web of shadows, soundtracks and combat, I wouldn't be surprised if they took a bit of that formula to add something completely updated 😍
this is PS5? Doesn't look that great for a ps5 game
Really don't like this interpretation of Miles, but it is what it is... Rest of the game looks great tho
The Lizard and Kraven look sick as hell!
omg...hugeeee
i am eagerly waiting for Venom Spider-Man
Another boring af game about spider man with the same plot
It makes sense that Venom is aggressive and evil, because he is Black. You only need to see BLM or black communities
Looks like regular ps4 graphics to me 💯💯💯💯
This is literally nxt lvl ,can't wait to play it and the action and graphics is incomparable ❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Game of the year contender right here
Leaving my comment here to the future.
Sasuke in a venom suit
Anyone else notices Peter’s eyes slightly changes to a venom looking style when he says “so do I”?
Spiderman Venom is something mega cool! Hopefully for, Venom will have separate costumes.
I'm buying a ps5 just to play this game it looks absolutely amazing
Please don’t force me to play as Miles.
So cool
W game
The side kick on the house move yes !!!
Finally a game that looks and plays like a next gen game
This looks cool but you shouldn’t show up Emo-Parker in the suburbs at noon! I need night, I need rain and I need cathedrals!!!
This is gonna be fun🤌🏻
Oh no kravens hot!
I hope we can play more with Spider-Man than with Negro Spider-Man aka Fake Spider-Man aka Miles Morales.
Think in the booth they just told Yuri to go full Sasuke with his lines.
This is insane
I love how Piter crawls on walls and swings on web. It shows that he's spiderman
Y'all ain't got to convince me, I'm going to buy this game. 10/10 on the symbiote combat and design.
Lizard is here🦎
Now this looks good, can't wait!
holy pepperoni!!
There is a little bit of inspiration from web of shadow black suit combat I see
Finally! A game where Spider Man uses the symbiote powers like how he did in web of shadows
Finally a game to look forward to. Spider-Man games always are good
The drone friend is new
Insomniac Games Cooked
I hope microsoft buys activision and kills playstation soon. Its ridiculous Sony can keep this off PC for 2 years and Xbox forever. Done with that anticonsumer nonsense.
Narutooooo!!!!😂
See y’all in 10 years
This was the highlight of the show, it had all the action beats of the films.
i seriously hope this gets a pc port
The year is 2023. Here’s a prediction….no matter what year you see this comment, this game will still hold up!!
this is amazing!
I wonder if it will be possible to take off a black suit on a red one as in web of shadows
You know I’m gonna make some giant spider webs with the Web Line.
I am a simple man,i see black Spiderman,i click
Why does the game graphics look so bad?
Is true miles is afro-latino?
I thought this was fry cry at the beginning lmao
AAAAAAAAAA🕷️🖤🖤
Ayee Activision, someone's making prototype, they're stealing your property 😂😂
Now.. . All i need is to have a PS5 😭
After 3-5 years, they back as the duo Miles and Peter
Miles really got that chidori
Okay,next time,no comment on spoilers
This is getting me more hyped than across the spider-verse. will miles also get the symbiote suit?
Nice
Spider-Man let his inner sasuke out fr
This is amazing 100% buying
QUEENSBRIDGE IS IN SPIDER-MAN !!!!!
3:44 Peter cuts off Miles mid sentence. You can tell the symbiote is really ramping up is impatience. This games gonna be amazing.
Finaly, a somewhat interesting villiain.
Why is miles in peters game bro 💀
Yuri Lowenthal’s really channeling some BIG “I’LL FOLLOW YOU TO THE END OF THE EARTH!!!!!!!!” energy there.
This is getting exciting❤
I love this man, Miles new powers look sick dude so excited 🙌🏾
Memories of spider man
Remember,that symbiote got negative thoughts. Better take off. I know,sorf kinda spoiler i think?
Yoooo symbiote Spider-Man is dope
Yo
Around 1:33 if you pause at the right time you can see Taskmaster is also on the map, saw the picture yesterday during the showcase but couldn't tell yet.
I NEED THIS GAME RIGHT NOWWWW!!! I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS HYPED FOR ANY GAME IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
The fact that you could play with the symbiont and normal suit, reminds of Spider-man Web of shadow's
I can't express my joy this game looks like it's from another world once it's out there Im gonna do nothing else then playing it this looks sooo stunning can't wait to play in the symbiote suit!
Ah.....the memories. It's coming back. "The web of the shadows" game was such a great introduction to so many characters, symbiote suit and the best of all "symbiote wolverine"
They way Pete threw the guy down after saving him from the helicopter from towards towards him was just proof that there might be a fight between Venom/Pete and Miles.
Basically we will be fighting peter
So new things in the gameplay that I see are the skill wheel and a wingsuit for web-swinging. That's about as much as should be expected, but I still hoped for more innovation
Lost for words I need Fall 2023 to start already 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
БЛИН ТАК ХОЧУ УЖЕ ИГРАТТ 😢
KRAVEN LOOKS SO GOOD
This presentation was pretty awesome, but those water textures are , just woof, and Ganke offered literally nothing to this section.
Waiting for bbs to play this game ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wish the symbiote was that dark purplish color like in Web of shadows
Web of shadows vibes incoming!
Cries in xbox
hope it releases to pc soon
See after 4 years when PlayStation folks port it to PC
Add more hate to his voice or smth n add most of the fights at night
Shut... Up... And... Take... My... Money!!!
Hume Indian superhero chahiye? 😫😫😫
This is giving off major Arkham City vibes
The trailer is amazing I'm soooo getting a ps5 soon
personally how do we feel about the ui?
I'm just 1:02 mins in the video and all i can say is PRE-ORDER
I playing spider man wen i was 3 years
Yeeeesssss black suit! Hopefuly, we'll play as Venom, too
Best superhero game is loading ❤️🔥
Excited
This just became the number one reason why I'm getting a Ps5, I'm super hyped for this game.
Sad he doesn’t shoot the symbiote webs from the front of his hands :,)
It is Ras from Dying Light isn't it?
This MIGHT be Bully Maguire 🗣️🔥💯
I been waiting for 3 years for this amazing game
Now it feels like Prototype 3
Everthing is so clean
11:32 this scene... Defines peters symbiote side effects. I liked the way peter throws the guy instead of normal spiderman does... Even miles got confused😂. Man these in game details are better than movies🔥...
🥶
Reminds me of the game prototype 😮
bro is bringing out his sasuke
yanky is so cringe man
yes no lil kid miles back to peter parker🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Spiderman is Pissed So much . his voice says it all.
We knew the real one is different 😂😂😂
Peter's symbiote voice sounds like Green Goblin from TASM2
This does bring a smile in my face 😈
I hope Carnage shows up in this game series as well. With Cletus Cassidy as the host after Eddie becomes Venom.
YO OMG
Maddddd ting!!
God, old school '94 Spider-Man vibes when he's Venomized.
È veramente uno scandalo che un cartone animato è un film pubblico vengano pubblicati solo su un tipo di console e non su xbox è tutte le altre console
Yeeeeees 🎉
Even at 11:31 where Peter saves the citizen, instead of letting them down gently like he would have done, he just drops him on the floor, cause of the venom suits influence. They really worked it into the little details as well.
Graficamente dov'è tutto questo splendore e differenza rispetto al vecchio episodio cross gen? Per essere PS5 ONLY è abbastanza deludente.
Peter's voice reminds me of Light Yagami for some reason.
Looks amazing can’t wait to see what else the ps5 can do (im writing this cuz I’ll know the answer in like 5 years)
they weren't lying when they said they were cooking...
OMG awesome this game
Over all great looking game. God, I just hope that ui gets changed. It’s really bothering me and I’m not even sure why.
Hope Venom voice the hole duality us symbiot and peter or eddy and Carnage
The real ps5 journey begins now w this game and mgs 3 remake 👍🏻
reminds me of spiderman 3 on the ps2 with kraven and the lizard
the return if emo peter parker
Man this should be good
Absolute genius 🎉
the graphics look kinda worst than spirder man 1
Legends waiting for GTA VI
I'm shocked the symbiote assimilated with Peter. But in a good way since he remind me of Spectacular Spider-Man.
Eai, eu do futuro
These venom moves are giving me prototype 1/2 vibes- I am very, very excited for this
This is going to be another bully maguire incident
Definitely gonna pre order this when there's an actual date installed of fall 2023, so far this is game of the year for me.
No words man❤❤
Venomm(vozdesimbionte)
Все круто! Но эта стелс система просто отстой
I'm calling it. the climax gonna be Peter's went too far cause of Symbiote's influence, Miles vs Peter! Im ready!
I hope Peter is not the one who dies in this game, or Harry. It is probably going to be one of them.
They gotta add (Ice-man & Firestar) as playable characters for Spider-Man 3.
*Spider-Man: Web of Shadows* + *Kraven's Last Hunt* with the addition of Miles Morales? You have my 90$
Wow better then before
Symbiote Spiderman looks absolute Menace and Cool❤
This is half baked. Really? They couldn't see their squad being lifted off the ground right in front of then 20 feet away? Super immersion breaking. Goldeneye had better Ai than this crap.
Wow.... Insomniac is doing it again!
I was here 🎉
Yooo
What if, hear me out, there is a section of the game that has Peter going rouge cause "we are venom". Culminating in Peter v Miles v Kraven. Peter going for the kill. Miles trying to bring in Kraven and stop Peter. Kraven being Kraven. Peter is desperate so hurting miles isn't totally off the table. You get to pick who you fight as either Peter or Miles. Maybe at the end of it add consequences that strain their relationship. Me thinks tis a decent second act
this gameplay looks great cant wait for it
Why there is 2 spiderman which is real
WEB WINGS !!!! HELL YEAH
Cant wait for the Peter vs miles fight
11:32 .. Bro💀
Amazing, not the biggest fan of lizard design though. Always thought that lizard is a guy with a lab coat and ect:D
The first one was the reason I bought a PS4 and this is the biggest reason I'm gonna buy a PS5. I´m gonna call Game of the Year.
When he started gliding I thought gross, then when he went through the rings and picked up speed I became very disappointed. Soo lame 0/10. Why not just give him rocket boosters and a parachute. They must have been out of ideas.
Is that kraven the hunter 😀🐅🦁🐆
kraven killed gigachad
YYYYEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
Omg, if anyone has ever played Web of Shadows, I am getting huge nostalgia from that!!!
Take my bank card right now
Now THAT'S gameplay!
The new blue lightning powers that miles gets clearly indicative of keeping venom away in the text I appreciate the subtleties insomniac 🖤
Really worried about how to play this game, I don’t want a ps5 but I know I’ll have to get one to play this… and I ain’t ready to drop nearly $600 to play 1 game
good game good game. but I don't deserve it. Let's watch on someone streamlive later
мегапенис
I Just know that this game will slaps. See you in the future where this game would be an absolute peak and classic
1:29 Yuri's back
The game play is so good!
Мне одному не нравится костюм и анимация симбиота? Что это за сарделины из рук? И когда паук в этом костюме сражался как карнаж? И когда это ящер стал Годзиллой на минималках?  Видимо я слишком старый! Чую еще та игра выйдет!
I love how the "together" can mean two things. Peter and the symbiote  but also it could mean Peter and Miles working together
Wow
blah blah blah couldn’t even show us wolverines trailer lame.
One of the best superhero GAME!!
They nailed the symbiote spiderman and this is gonna be so interesting to see Miles dealing with this situation.
8:38 poor graphics of explosion
GOTY GOTY GOTY GOTYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I cannot wait for this game for pc release date , so excited
Если ЧП так и останется Веномом, будет прикольно.
Reminds me of prototype game series
The hype is up! I repeat the hype is up!
This game has prototype vibe as well, loving it.
This is how you level up your game. Adding elements from other games while adding your own ideas and execute them perfectly. This looks like a blockbuster sequel to an already good game
Bully lowenthal time😏
“This is something else”
Osm wish that I could have a ps5😢
Thank you GOD, for giving me the Spider-Man: Web Of Shadows remastered I was praying for for all these years...
I appreciate all the goodies coming with this iteration. But somehow I am unhappy with water physics and its associated combat visuals. Does anyone else feel the same ?
Sensational
“I’ve been in your shadow for hours, but you sense nothing. Pathetic” -Kraven  0:50  Bro that’s him alright. I cannot wait to see these characters play their roles as the were meant to be.
bro spidey really become menace😂
Papi
Two things. 1: I wonder if the symbiote suit will have skins based on other versions of it(Comic, Ultimate, Red Alert, Spider-Man 3, etc) and 2: I really hope they add both versions of the Superior Spider-Man suit and the Spider-Man:Unlimited suit.
يارب ارجع بعد ٥ سنوات
See you in 2028 when it releases on PC😊
LETSS GOOO
Where's the Wolverine from game?? No glance of him after that trailer. 🤣😂
I really like how darker the sequel will be! Can't wait considering it's one of the only anticipated games in the past few years that most likely won't actually disappoint me
You can really tell that when Peter has the black suit there's a lot of anger in his voice Yuri Lowenthal you've done it again
Looks plain awefull for a 2023 game.
I love the suit! Getting xenomorph vibes from it
They added the Fortnite wind travel mechanic 😂
RIP to my GTX1650
The combat lowkey has too many cutscenes, kinda ruins the flow imo
This scream: "Let's go discrimination and racism in videogames!"
hope the end boss is like a evil peter
After years this is gonna be most people memory
Yoo this is lit !!!!  I love that they have web like wings so that they can glide. Do you agree ?
but they need to explain how peter got the symbiote
There allowing you to go to both newyorks!!!!
I really like how the suit looks like it's made of glossy goo instead of being just the black material like in the movies or other games. Also that scary eyes, you can see the whites of the eyes are moving and also they're not 100% white. OMG Can't wait to buy PS5 just for this game!
I don’t know why but the game doesn’t look that much better than the 2018 version , we should have better graphics by now
I'd say the only thing that bothers me is that for someone who hunts primitively they sure have alot of technology like it would be cooler if they used actual birds to seek you out and hyenas for the robot dogs, obviously it might be to much in terms of restrictions but just webbing them would be cool
Oh my god I can’t wait for this
Dang that looks incredible, the new move set is going to be so cool, and the gliding mechanic looks amazing!
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 | Cutscene Reveal
I just want a John Wick game.
Finally 🔥🤤
Insomniac Games have given us a perfect Peter Parker, Doctor Octopus, Black Cat, Miles Morales and basically every other character who appeared in the first game. Yet until 2:27 I wasn't sure they will give us perfect Venom 10:30 and Lizard. Silly me.
okay i think Pete is gonna be the final boss and we definitely gonna have to fight him.
Its currently 2023 if someone’s seeing this in 2033 say hi and hope your having an amazing day.
This game...is gonna be awesome! Peter's voice being a bit dark and not being mean to miles is a good thing. we need to get a glimpse of Venom.
Bully Magurie
Miles is definitely going to end up having to kill Pete
No way that’s sasuke
is just me or does the lizard kind of look like killer croc. amazing design though
Finally.
Miles' new powers looks great he has a lightning Kamehameha. Peter symbiote moves also look sick. Love how you switch between Peter and Miles 💙 🙌🏾
The successor to the beloved prototype series
I like the symbiote spider man powers
Mam this needs a rated M version with mortal kombat blood and gore
Best wishes to PlayStation for making Billions out of this project they worked extremely hard for years.
I wish the symbiote suit punches hit a little harder and had a little more impact instead being the usual
Giving me good ol' Web of Shadows vibe and i love it!
Just like in the spider man 3 movie, peter parker becomes more evil the more he stays with the black suit
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
This game going make so much money
If you still love this game in 2030, like this comment
Destiny 2 music?
9:17 Паучье чутьё вышло из чата
Please make the game long and to where we can keep the same Symbiot 🙏
Why does he have black tentacles? Is he venom infected?
I'm sure the game will be great, but I have one question. Will there be Russian voiceover or subtitles?
So many amazing things in this trailer, Kraven, the setpiece, spider-wingsuits  But especially, Black Suit Peter. Words cannot express how happy i am that this is the main way he will be differentiated from Miles in gameplay  I was worried with how fun Miles was in his game that Pete would feel less exciting to go back to but no, this is perfect for a game where you can play both
If John Bubniak is not gonna return as Spider-man im about to go crazy
Plz no rhino in this
I think I know what comic storyline they’re adapting but ion kno 🤔
When miles is getting pulled by the drone his webs are also black same as peters when hes using symbiote, might be a texture bug idk could just be the lighting but it also look like is tingles like the symbiotes, love you insomniac!
I'm loving this! The symbiote and how it changes Peter, changing characters between Peter and Miles, Queens suburbs being part of the map, Kraven and Lizard. In Insomniac I trust!
Looks like i might get a ps5 after all
why is it blue make the yellow back pls
It's an interesting "time period" to put the Symbiote. In the movies and some of the comics, it's Aunt May who saves Peter from the Symbiote. But of course, Aunt May is gone. Instead we have Miles. So there's the pressure put on Miles to see if he's able to step up and face Peter.
WEB OF SHADOWSS !!!!! Getting major nostalgic goosebumps. If the moves are as sick an cool or even better than WOS, this game is gonna go down in history as one of the best superhero games ever. I hope thye improve the swinging with a cinematic mod or give some really cool moves to peter as well.
11:28 You telling me that helicopter was un-manned?
That’s sauske
funny miles is around while spiderman has the black suit
He realizes that he is saved by spider man the inhabitant:thanks spide... spider man: 11:30
Better than the movies!
Peter beating women now 😂
This is more movie than a game I’m 100% getting this
This looks so good. Can’t wait to see what they do with Wolverine
Miles straight up did a kamahamaha at 4:59 😂😂😂
I want Peter to Dance ,like Bully Maguire in spider man 3
Hopefully whenever Spider Man gets a black suit in the MCU he will fight like this.
I think that Peter is going to go for more darker techniques and tactics than Miles. Causing them to have a fight in the end. Spider-Man vs Spider-Man
Like my comment if ur gonna attempt platinum trophy on this masterpiece
I hope pete will fight the shocker in his black suit. You will pay shockerrrr!
I see alot of Xboxes being sold in the coming months.
3:09 RIP to this guy's children.
His triceps are insane!
Dun dun dunnnnnnn
Yuri's at it again. Imagine this voice with Ben Tennyson back in the days...
Black suit spiderman is Yuri going full sasuke lol
this becoming moree like prototype everyday
This game will go down in history
11:36 ... he... he was talking about himself and *Miles* ...  ...right...?
Miles may wind up have to fight Peter
no matter how much it is, i’m buying it
Miles will fight Peter like he fought uncle Aaron as prowler
Curious to see if this is a lead-in towards Insomniac’s multiplayer game. They showed Wraith in the trailer too—and I wonder if the game might also have her playable at some point. They might even have Venom at some point as well. Combined with Miles and Peter, as well as the new systems their studio is building around Wolverine? We might be looking at a Defenders game of some sort.  Either way, though, Spider-Man 2 looks like something special and I’m very excited to play a game that has us fighting Lizard, Kraven, and Venom (actually, very reminiscent of the Spider-Man 3 movie game just done…well?).
i really hope they fixed most of the issues with the story from the first game for, me it was mainly the repetitive side quests etc, made it really hard to want to keep playing the game out side the story
we are VENOM
The game looks amazing with all of the new features. It is definitely worth the wait!
MY BELOVED BLACK SUIT!!
So I would say Peter finds out Harry has the Symbiote and realises it's effecting Harry so he takes it so Harry doesn't have to suffer it. Or something along those lines
It's a long shot... but... coop?
This gonna be Game of the year even though i wouldn't be able to play it
Ah see I'm worried. With PS sequels being utter trash in terms of writing, from the downright Boring - Horrizon Forbiden west - to the mindfuck of stupid that is Gow:Ragnarok..... And how BAD miles morales was....  Seeing this entire trailer.. i'm really worried.
What happens to the sun at 9:00 ???
The chase remember ucharted 4 a thief's end chase in madagascar
At first I was like, “That’s not meant to be Kraven, is it?” then I was like “Nah… THAT is Kraven.”
Sorry, but symbiot suit 🥴 Waiting for WOS mod symbiot suit
I can already tell this is going to be awesome
for those who have seen spectacular spiderman, you have seen that in the series as the symbiote took control of spiderman the suit changed more and more design from that of spiderman with cobweb motifs to that of the symbiote with only the symbol of the white spider, well if there was such a thing in the game too it would be a killer detail
Its lizard man not crocodileman how can he swim so good like that, and he also has a crocodile mouth
OMG I CANT WAIT
looks so cool
All I hear is Sasuke
1 John 2:15-17 King James Version 15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.  17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved  It doesn't matter what you've, done Jesus loves you and you can be saved. Repent, ask for forgiveness and have faith in him🥰
Romans 6:23 NLT   “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.
The aggression on Peter in the black suite is on point…. I wonder if miles going to have a taste of it as well , but can we talk about the mobility they took it bck to the old days adding web gliding 😱 last but  not least we can’t forget  about  the combos
Some clowns say that it looks like 4/10 and the graphics hardly changed.
Micah 4:5 5 All the nations may walk in the name of their gods, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.
Can’t wait for this to come out, hopefully since they’ve been taking their time on this game it should be good and have little to no bugs from start
So this is not Miles Morales ?
I'm so glad that Insomniac is taking cues from Web of Shadows and I love the design of the black suit
Hot take, Miles is a trash character
that's my guy george
Peter sounds like he's about to unlock the Mangekyo Sharingan.
Finally a game that completely fullfills the dream of perfectly blending cut-scenes with real gameplay!  Can't wait for it to drop!
J'étais là au moins je dirais a mes futurs enfants
1:56 kravens theme goes hard
I almost had a heart attack when I saw this
Why why why AI is so blind & stupid. Game looks awesome but so what if there's is no challenge & no sense of intimidation from your adversaries...
Symbiote moves for Spider-Man?! Aw hell yea!
Those who get this greatness recommended in their feed in the future, welcome 🫡
Spidey got a curse mark
Omg omg can’t freaking wait
Wow just wow . Games are definitely changing to something more crazier then it use to . 🫡👍🏻
Spider-Man 3 Raimi game & Web of Shadows callbacks here. Oh Focus Bar from 1st game return, meaning Miles' Bio Electric gauge reworked for L1-based Power Gauge system now.
Thats what I m waiting for
I like the trailer but man these enemies look strange af. Miles morales was suffering from a similar issue but this futuristic tech simply does not work in the Spider-Man world would much prefer it if they looked more like mercs than Xcom soldiers
I love how the venom suit looks alive at all times. Insomniac's Spider-Man universe is becoming my favourite version.
Sweeeeeeeet 👌
This is going to be a masterpiece again. Eagerly waiting to get hands on
I remember the last time I played with venom suit in spiderman 3 on PSP
Well… that was amazing.
Prototype 3?
Peter is going to be the final boss
💯💯🤌🤌🖤🖤
Sheesh
. . . !
They even got the detail of Peter’s web being black right!! I love how Insomniac gets all the small details correct, especially with how breathtakingly gorgeous the scenery is!!!
I CANT WAIT FOR THE PC PORT IM SO HYPED
Xbox crying in exclusive😂😂😂😂😂
I'm so excited for this game. I'm going to buy a PS5 just for this game
Oh how I hate miles...
I hope there's a red venom suit cuz that would be neat as a skin.
Is this moves from Marvel vs Capcom?
Miles is definitely going to be experiencing the symbiote from knowing Peter’s behavior. He’ll figure out what it is, what’s causing him to be like this, then Miles will try to tell Peter but he’ll get even more pissed & would be thinking that Miles is just jealous that he wants it. Then Pete is gonna be pushy, selfish, & a bully. Miles would have no choice to fight him
Najs, totok mi presne nadnes chýbalo. Úplne som dojatý. Xd
Is this ps5 only?
That was the greatest 12 mins of my life. 🔥
This looks sick. I'm just not gonna pay 80 pounds for it
Looks great. My only complain is that the symbiote tentacles look slightly unfinished, like the polygons are still rough and need to be smoothened out. I trust Insomniac to polish all the little details before release.
Take all of my money right now
Yeah. This is gonna be really freaking good
This looks amazingggggg
Prototype 3?
2:07 You are not in Kansas anymore!! You are on Pandora!!
If they actually put Queens in the game that's an instant plus from me. That establishing shot by the Queensboro Bridge is picture perfect!
Oh hell ya spidermam spiderman can do anything a spider can
Yes, i liked my own comment...
The transitions between Peter and Miles seems really slick! I can't wait for this!
That’s not Peter Parker that’s Peter uchiha
The voice acting is just amazing for pete! Way to make him sound tonally aggressive for the black suit!
Symbiotic voice reminds me of spider cop ngl
I like how at 11:55 we can see the iconic Venon eyes form slightly as Spidey says "So do i"
Will the game come out for PC as well, or will I have to wait 2 years to play?
peters darker voice sounds exactly like sasuke from naruto
Welp...IM SOLD, FALL 2023 HERE WE COME!!!
why this feels like prototype 3 with pegi 13?
Really give you gameplay of what it's like to have all the exaggerated swagger of a black teenager
@3:40 couldn't leave the woke crap out could they? Sorry not interested in a race swapped black Spiderman with a hispanic name. Not into the "box checking" but I'm sure tons of kids will buy this mess.
Can't wait to hear: *YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME!!! I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARRRRRTH!!!!!*
Idk why the kraven song reminded me of the witch queen theme from destiny 2
this is boutta be mad
Oh this game is fantastic
This game looks like from a movie or something and i like Peter aggressiveness it has much detail the symboite suit will be 3rd most used suit in the game
Love it. Quite Concerned about Peters swinging animations. looks the same as last game. but overall, its great!
I never imagine a symbiote costume to be like that, but, again, When Insomniac designed a spider-man suits, i can only take my hat off, bravo !!
Sasuke would be proud
VAMOSSSSS
Looks like a great upgrade!
I'm sad miles has blue electricity
Spider-Man is definitely killing those people.
nothing new
Just remember it probably won’t look quite this good. Still excited non the less. It’s nice that we get new parts of the city to see too.
fur is something that even unreal engine 5 can't fix. nor any other engines
Se zarparon mal wacho
It looks really good, but it also looks like a whole series of QTEs...
this wins game of the year
Looks like a fight between Miles and Peter is inevitable. I hope Peter beats the crap out of Miles and not make it seem like he's an equal I want full on one sided domination on that fight, Miles should win by convincing Peter that the black suit is making him more evil.
I get the feeling that symbiote Spider-Man is gonna be a pain in the you-know-what as a boss fight.
Omg the gameplay is 🔥
Okay... So Tombstone is still alive. Taskmaster makes his return, there is a Wraith also, maaaaan. My man, Prowler... This will be FIREEEEEE
Would love for it to be co-op
I think we are about to get a spiderman vs spiderman boss battle in this game
insomniac peter really said "YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME LIZAAAAAAARRRDD! I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EAAAAARRRRRRRTH!!!"
Spidey just said these hands are E for Everybody and good on Kraven for having men and women warriors.
VENOM 🗣️💯💯💯💯
anybody else felt the Miles Morales gameplay feels like The Batman Origins? Using the web lines to go from one place to other and then getting them wrapped in the webs, kind of reminds me how Batman used to do...
THIS IS SO FKING SICK
The gameplay looks epic ❤ Spiderman at this peak ❤️  If you find this video after 10 years, remember i was already here waiting.❤
Is the black suite venom  what symbiote is that
I so hope there's a dedicated climb button and that the automation is an option in the menu
Graphics looks like PS4
We can't see these kind of charecters collab in a live action movie bcz Disney and Sony always have copyright issues for movie making but not in games. Why is it??
Time for peak garbage 2 to release
Also for Xbox?
Kraven would never have a man bun.
I love miles swagger of a young black teen
I just want to put my comments at here and after that I can see my comment 10 year later.
The delivery on "He's gonna wish he never came to New York!" Sounded absolutely amazing. 3:03
Imagine if Miles could use Ganke's tech to hack the Kraven's robots.
Amazinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng
It's so cool it's like watching an immersive movie. I love it 🤍
I still have the slight feeling that they may try to kill off peter in this game.
Web Of Shadows nostalgia vibes with this one ♥️🔥
Batman And Spiderman got the best games than other heroes 😂❤
Everything is great but i want to see the human interaction after removing that mask because that will show us how much they changed. The interaction and altercation between Miles and Pete and Pete and MJ is going to be so awesome. I can't wait for it to release
Watching Miles and Peter interact feels rather tense considering the timebomb that is the symbiote
this is actually unreal
I, on the other hand, hope that at least in the side missions we will deal with the case of Yuri Watanabe
Man, the way Peter's acting in this makes me wonder if the Venom we saw in the reveal trailer was actually him instead of Harry or someone else. Like obviously he's acting more aggressive and anxious with the Symbiote suit on, but that growl when he first starts fighting, that subtle change with his eyes at the end, the "I have big teeth too" comment... It would be amazing to watch him slowly transform into Venom over the course of the game. And if we do, I hope we get a Venom moveset to play around with alongside the Symbiote moveset, even if only as some sort of temporary rage ability.
god
great now another 1000$ for a ps5
Please let us decide whether or not we keep the symbiot
Can you pls do spider man on Xbox
The new powers and story are worth the wait can’t wait to play this legend of a game
Spoderman turned into Venoom... shit's gonna be crazy
9:41 Killer Croc 12 o'clock
this is insane!!!! i can't wait to buy!!!!!!!
is nobody going to mention how MASSIVE the lizard is??? INSANELY HYPED
If they don't name this Game of the year I will sue
Jacksepticeye is gonna love the web wings...he asked for it during his Marvels Spider-man 1 playthrough...DUDEE IM HYPEE FOR IT. I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE GAME BUT IM DEFINITELY WATCHING JACK PLAY IT.
Is that Sasuke I hear?
I didnt think they could have done better than the other Spiderman games but wow....they did it.
Web swing still sucks😢
This is so Good!
Venom, Lizard, Kraven and Catwoman in one game Life could be a dream
This is unreal
Easy down Yuri...your Sasuke is showing...
is it just me, or nah? symbiote peter sounds like maruki from persona 5
This is looking good.
I cant wait for this game
Wow, such exaggerated swagger bro
Yeyooooo
Visuals and combat are nothing special but the glider looks very fun
PC release?
Sasuke?
Too bad Peter will not have 2018 face anymore
この動画だけで神ゲーの予感がする クオリティが高すぎるしアクションの進化だったりがすごすぎる
this will be awesome
I can see the future 10 years from now coming back to this remembering the BEST Spiderman video games.
This looks like it will be one of the greatest superhero video games ever made. I've been "kraving " a good portrayal of Venom for a long time. It needs to be absolutely menacing and terrifying. I was really getting those vibes with Kraven and the Lizard too. This is spectacular.
I can’t wait to play it 🕸🔥🔥
"Spiderman hang on" say Miles Morales...
So Peter Parker is final boss or mid game boss?
After Spider-man PS4 I tought "they can't do better than this."... Happy to say I was TOTALLY WROMG! THIS LOOKS AWESOME!!!
Wouldn't this be the second time Peter bonds with the symbiote suit? Like wasn't there a reference to it in the first Spider-Man game?
The beginning felt cinematic as hell. 😂 did you see how Peter just through the guy he just saved from that engine on fire and let him down on the floor😂. That gave me Bully Maguire vibes. Classic Venom personality.
I skipped thru it bc of spoilers but I love how black suit Spider-Man fights
So there isn't a costume change(symbiote to red and blue etc) thing huh? Because the scene where we saw peter with the black suit gave me that idea.
The only thing I don’t like is the lines on the black suit. There’s like an obvious segmented design that makes it look too human. I wish it was just all like the smooth part. Would make it look more eerie. Now it looks a bit too techy.
@DavyJones o jogo ta insanooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cara melhor parte   e a parte que aparece  2 wekers aparece numa moto correndo atras peter
When does this come out in theaters?
Slashes look terrible
Insomniac games never failed
drop it fast sony its a mass petition
No gore 🥲
I love everything about this I just hate that still no release date. Lemme preorder already!!!!
I like It how The Web Is Coming out his fists Like In The Comics/ Cartoons
Cue the James Brown music. Also, that bait and switch with Kraven at the start was just...👌
I’m a the only getting the prototype games vibe :) ?
omg
Really loving the darker tone, I actually can’t wait to get my hands on this 💯
Игра 2016го?
Peter can now say the N word to Miles!
Graphics looks downgraded
GOTY already
3:04 oh yeah when i first visited NY i also wished i never did.
This feels like a movie.....show me moreeee
THIS IS INSANEEE
Wait can you go all over new York not just Manhattan
love how the symbiote also makes him act more reckless. they're nailing the portrayal, not a big fan of the suit visually though
let’s goo
I was so anxious that miles might trigger peter a bit in this video which would make him lash out on him
Interesting, it's giving me the Spider-Man 3 vibes 😭👍🏼
I was here
Litarly Who Also Feel The Spider Man Web Of Shadows Vibe Bcz Of Symbiotic Crazy Tentacles power
Might just get a PS5 just for this
It's a good adaptation of the Symbiote! The symbiote does not make people mean contrary to what many believe. It brings out the dark side in people, Spider-Man with the symbiote does not become evil, he stay good but brutal, aggressive and neglectful.
Is that kraven in the beginning?!
DUDEEEEE!!!!!!! 🤯🤯🤯🤯😳😳😳😳😳😳😳 this game is going to be AMAZING!!!!
Jesus, the combat skills with the Symbiote look awesome. Plus the web gliding with Miles looks like its gonna save time on the web slinging.   Peter becoming more and more aggressive as the clip goes on looks like him and Miles might go head to head at some point.  I bet we will see Wraith in this game since her photo showed up on Kravens list.  Man, I can't wait for this game. Ill have to start putting money aside for a PS5
So no one's going to talk about Wraith (Yuri Watanabe)'s suit being revealed at 1:28 ?
I bet nobody noticed peters lends change when he says he had fangs too
Already like this vilin more than any ps character ever
キタァァアアァァァア！！
did i just see deadpool
Talk to you guys in about 5 years when it's on PC
Another 70 dallors off the check
Yea next year is goin to be insane for gaming . Covid ruined everything . I was sad no silent hill or factions info . Still no release date for spider man .  Huess we’ll have to wait for next PlayStation showcase for release dates n into . I’m guessing spider man 2 early to mid 2024 or very late 2023
Looks epic !!!!
I can already see the final battle Venom Pete VS Miles, that would be epic
Sauske sauske sauske
I hope that will be a Miles vs Venom Pete, or Spidermans vs Venom Lizzard or Kraven
yo pienso que le faltan demasiado detalles a los gráficos en algunas escenas para ser un juego de ultima generación. Entiendo que sea un tipo "preview" pero si alfinal termina siendo así o esos detalles creo yo que marcan la diferencia :( pero lo demas me encanto muchisimos sus nuevas dinámicas de combate
bro lowenthal’s embracing his inner uchiha whilst voicing symbiote peter.
DId Peter get Symbiote in 1st game? Or is it just 2nd part feature?
Let's goooo, can't wait for this fall 😊, now I wonder, if we will ever use Venom in this universe 🤔. I mean what if instead of having Miles Morales 2, we will have a Venom spin-off after this 🤔
Take my money!
Im hoping the black suit has more moves so far the tendrils were only showing when using finishers I hope it’s like webs of shadows where it’s basic attacks that can have some ranged cool moves too it’s probably overpowered so maybe they can add it as a fury mode but the moves displayed actually made me jump off my seat really loving the black suit reminding me of Spider-Man webs of shadows im glad the black suit isn’t just a suit but part of the story
my wish became true to switch to miles or peter this trailer is really good.
See you in 50 years when half of the people here are dead
Wth did i just watch. This is awesome
I don't wanna be a downer, but Harry's gonna die anyway.
“So do I”
Hopefully these graphics are unfinished
Sasuke in a Spider-Man suit. Love it. ❤🎉
🔥
Ganke yelling as the drone gets thrown is gold!!!
Love trylogy spiderman game
Symbiotic Spiderman is just Sasuke now 😂😂
Wow😮
Water physics and graphics could be better ngl
this is awesome bro
Don’t know how games are gonna look like after 20 yrs
Am I the only one who thinks the game is looking like an ps3 game?
Is it just me or Peter sounds like saske?
ps4 🙃
I'm buying a Ps5 for this game 100%
This game is going to earn big!
Water puddles not looking great😢
I’m so excited for this holy crap I can’t wait
I like how the venom covered up the "togather" at the end until miles electric powers destroyed it. The storyline foreshadowed perfectly
The black suit looks hideous and the “angry” voice acting is pure cringe. Disappointing.
BROOO WHEN I SAW MILES FLYING! WTF GREAT STUFF!
I might just have to buy a PS5 to get this game. Wish it was on PC😂
the "he"s got big teeth." line would have been so much better if he responded, "And I have fangs." Cause you know....Spider
Graphical improvements definitely blows my mind
WHAT A FCKING PEAK
Why myles in here man…
Another reason to get PS5. First was Horizon Forbidden West... Now this is a whole new level
Did any of you guys notice, when peter says he has big teeth too, the shape of his lens change to resemble venom's eyes. It becomes rougher with sharp edges from peter's smooth and round lens. 11:51
OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GODDDDDD
Why does liver king got beef with Spider-Man ???
See u in 10 years when Sony decides to release this on PC😂😂
Be honest, this isn't your first time watching this.
too good😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
We fought Otto 3 years ago, remember?😭😭😭
WE'RE GONNA SEE BULLY MAGUIRE EVERYONE!
Kraven having cyberdogs and everything about the symbiote suit is amazing
LEGEND..................wait for it........DARY
Didn’t even watch 5 minutes. I saw you can play as both Peter and miles and I’m sold. Idgaf
Can’t wait until we see Harry become Venom - it’s the logical conclusion to the symbiote being revealed this early plus they already mentioned his health
I Hope its for Ps4 because im so exicted
Peter Parker's dark tone of him voice was incredible as black suit symbiote Spiderman  He was also rude to miles Morales, saying 'We Don't have much time, Move!!'
This looks great but I really hope we are not stuck in NYC for the entire ride. Would love to play as Spidey in a forest or somewhere like that.
Hope my 3050 can deal with “high” graphics 😂
How is it the Marvel can put together something like and it's action/story oriented but when you go to the movie side they create woke garbage? Clearly we need the writers from the games on the movies too and fire the entire team currently putting nonsense out.
Looks incredible but I when will it launch on PC?
Goddamn. I really wish i had a PS5
I’m forecasting the post credit scene being both Spidey’s getting sucked into the multiverse and appearing in Beyond the Spider-Verse
Peter was looking so angry in end but I want to ask that in this we will use only Peter or miles pls because I like Peter not miles
Can't wait, never really played the previous 2 games.  But this one really looks interesting.
Did I see Deadpool ?!?!
man what a game I love how insomniac has always known how to separate the character of peter and spiderman from the first game I think they are doing that same great job now with peter and venom ❤
Finally!
Оххх ну это будет пушка,ждёмм
Serious Prototype vibes.
Maybe I'm just being stupid but I've  beaten both spider man and Miles morales games, and I don't remember seeing Peter have the venom suit how did he get that?
Aw yeah. Black-suited Spider-Man is back
Bro this is so fire
Wait, when did Peter get the Symbiote?
graphics looks downgraded
Love the voice acting on symbiote Spiderman
*cries in xbox*
please bring spiderman to xbox🙏🏼🙏🏼
im so excited i feel like im 12 again spiderman games are just the best
The gameplay was great I have good hopes for the game and I like the new mechanics game and the storytelling I like the new wingsuit and web rope and how we switch to characters and I want to know how Peter got venom and what happened to Harry and what Kraven wants  and how will miles save peter from before it gets out of control for peter this gameplay was excellent and I have high expectations from the game
I maybe in the minority here. But I didnt wanted Miles playable here. It should b Peters game. Miles should only be a side character.
This looks great
there are so many small details like in 9:54 when spider man thew the civilian on the ground and miles looked at him
Flabbergasted
New game cant wait
Ithe only bad thing about this from what we can see is no new swinging animations for peter and miles
If only I had a ps5
Whenever I hear or see anything about this, I get hungry..
Am I the only one that has a feeling that peter will be a main villain and well have to fight him ?
Waiting for this to be released in pc
Spiderman(venom skin) could have been better.. it looks need more polishing in the design department!?  games looking good!
Amazing
You got my attention.
Dang that black suit is bringing me back to Web of Shadows. I need a “I CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH” from this spidey
I better get my GCSE grades good, because I want that PS5, and I definitely want this game 🤩
Miles morales again... I'll pass
yuri brought out the sasuke for this and i love it!!!
Bruh. 2017 graphic 😂😂😂
Man! Can't wait to hear angry Peter's voice coming out of that awful 16 year old looking remaster face
whats the name of the "junge vallain"?
Im just skipping through and I’m wondering how did those two gunmen not hear him destroy that turret? Lol
As cool as this looks I’m sick of the gameplay from the hours I put into ghe ps4 version
Is it going to be on PC at launch?
It's perfect affect on his personality, hes on pure efficiency, when he saves the guy yes he's a hero he will save people but he just tosses him and dips even miles looks confused at it. But he doesn’t outright ignore plans he works together with miles and ganki with the bomb falcon yeet. Also the combat seems awesome and dynamic, just hope it's not too dynamic to the point where you can bug it easily
I wish the webswinging was fluid. When Peter/miles pulls his webs when he’s low to the ground, he shouldn’t levitate and then find momentum for a “perfect” fast swing. There needs to be a badly timed swing chance. Something to make it so that good swinging will be more satisfying.
Waiting for the game❤
So we can activate and deactivate the symbiote suit?
I will forever be a Spiderman fan and I can't wait to play this game,looks so fire
Miles: Lets go man before he gets too far!  Peter: No, he's mine.  Miles: You sure? He's got big teeth!  Peter: So do I.  *"Parararararaaaaaan Pararararaaaan!!!!"* *Spider-man 3 Venom suit theme plays* lol
All I care about and all I want is playable Venom. Please make it happen
How did they make Ganke's dialogue even cringier
🕷️♂️
2:29 imagine this in live action version with tom Holland in mcu
i’m loving the attention kraven’s been getting recently. him and sandman are hands down my favorite spiderman villains
It’s for ps4 ???? Wtf
I'm so hyped
Crazy to see all the things we'll be able to do with the black suit.  Terrifying to see all the things we'll be dealing with when fighting Venom.
It would be epic, if we see this ps5 venom version Spider-Man at the Spider-Man across the Spider-Verse movie in the theater.
Now I see why they got SAUSKES voice actor. This is bout to be dope
A Spider-Man themed PS5 would be nice.
Omg
love it but i how they make changes so there tech guy stop shouting out the spider man's identity's
Is it at all possible harry is the lizard? I know in every Spider-Man Dr connors is the lizard but I’d there any chance it’s harry? Or is harry going to become venom? Harry will play a role at some point is my guess.
would love to see carnage in this too
The fighting mechanics still the same. Just improved graphics doesn't mean a new game.
I am SO happy.
This Looks soo good. So much better than anticipated and even miles better than the first two one's. Easily the second most anticipated game for me (this year)
Kravens Last Hunt anyone?
So it won't be available in pc??
I hope I can choose when I want to play as Peter or Miles. I mean, I want to play as Spider-man man, not an electric copycat
Massive W
At 11:55 the eyes pattern change a bit.
Day 1 purchase. Call me a sucker but idgaf, MILES CAN GLIDE NOW!!
this looks amazing, maybe even spectacular
It's funny how enemies npcs still stand around waiting while their friend is being beaten alive. Like they will wait and barely attack or move. Next is when that huge metal thing fell off and hit the floor and makes loud noise, the npcs will just stay there unalerted like nothing just happened. It's like oblivion npcs 🤣🤣
Swinging looks like the exact same as before, that’s a shame would’ve liked something a bit more pendulum like
Combat system is  inspired with Web of Shadow
Game of the year
This is what happens when you give a franchise to developers that actually care about making games.
a spiderman with electric powers? that's fuck1ng retard3d; just like captain america with heat vision or a flrying dare devil
holy jezz what an amazing,but still my vavourite in marvel is venom
The one game I will probably pre order. Holy moly did that look great.
im better off playing web of shadows and spider man 3 for a symbiote experience no annoying miles
The slingshot, the gliding, the symbiot, I just love it all
I hope we can play through the entire game as peter. I don;t really care for morales as a character.
If only i could get it on ps4 :(
He’s going sasuke
Is it just me or does spider man sound a bit like matpat at around 3:04 ?
I love how more aggressive peter sounds with the symbiote suit, it shows that the symbiote is corrupting his mind and personality, i also love the feature when he’s in mid combat with the symbiote suit, he’s using his combat skills like how venom does from the movies
This is what we need! Hyped for this one
That Miles glide yo 🔥🔥🔥. I'ma have fun wit this
What a great day to be alive for the this game 😍
These types of gaming is definitely going to change the world 😜
The way he threw the civilian tho, Jameson would’ve loved that! 😂
I know that everyone's really excited about the symbiote gameplay aspects of Spider-Man 2 (and i was too), but personally I was freaking out when I saw that in this new game we could glide with the web wings on 3:51 and 9:03. I can't wait to try a new traversal method in Marvel's Spider-Man's New York. Plus although I know this probably won't happen, but it would be cool to think about, I'd love it as a new upgrade with the symbiote powers, the symbiote shape shifts wings to give Spider-Man the power of flight.
I love that black suit a lot 🥶
Lizard also looks so great
Kraven wearing fur while in a tropical biome-- ick that's gonna be sticky
I will never stop playing this game 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hello everyone in 8 years
Everything looks great except for the water which could use improvement.
Godddd
ITS SO FULL OF EXAGGERATED SWAGGER OF A BLACK TEEN I CANT!
La fin du jeu me semble prévisible
Venom be like hold my 🍺😂
Gonna be game of the year
I'm guessing this game will have miles fight with Pete for him to realize something is wrong with him and that suit
Loved the 11:36 part , attention to detail, Peter threw the guy and didn’t care about him just now he saved him  and miles looked at him a bit worriedly.
Miles really does move and fight with the exaggerated swagger of a Black teen.
Goat
Hey @MarvelEntertainment I love the spider-man games and all but uh.... There was a rumored Wolverine Game like 2 years ago with Insomniac working on the project... that ever gonna be a thing or..???
lol even miles knew a trap was coming, peter cant let his cockyness get in the way. he has to be ready for everything and take caution instead of running in. at lease thats what i would do.
Wow so cool Hope to see next Spiderman movie like this
7:45 I love how how it looks like when you have to press triangle with Miles, it has the 80s colours like in the animated movies! Great detail. I know I love everything about this game right now
IT LOOKS SO GOOD AAAAA
I need a PS5 now
Its sasuke's voice actor
I wonder if micheal salvatori did the score, sounds like destiny 2
Faking helllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
Guarantee game of the year
This is insanely cool ong so worth it for the wait
Wow! Please don't make PC players wait years for this.
11:35 "He got away from us" gives out venom vibes. Insane details
Bro they really didn't change any of peters basic combos
I want Spider-Man to say chidori now 🤣
Nah they just completely made peter go demon time 😂
Hearing Yuri angry again made me remember Sasuke. Now I can’t stop picturing Sasuke underneath the mask lol. 2:40
LETS GO!!!!
Miles morales is in two marvels projects, this game and spiderverse
im never expected thats symbiote is going to be awesome better than eddie brock using  full potential
I love how you see the symbiote moving when Peter is standing still.
This honestly gets me HYPE for both this game AND the future Wolverine game too!
“Uhh guess we’ll chat later” 😂😂😂
This looks sick as
Such high quality, insomniac devs are incredibly talented. The first game was amazing and so was miles. I can’t wait for this
Spider-Man 2 and Final Fantasy 16. Xbox is Dead.
this is prototype 3 dumb dumbs
Symbiote Spiderman looks good! Hype!
Spiderman can practically fly now and the bad guys just stand there waiting to get beat. Dont look like a fun game to play and it felt more like a good spiderman movie or something.
The symbionts is corrupting him
Seems a bit unfinished, hopefully this is an early build and will look better on release
Oh i can already see it spiderman vs spiderman boss battle
I see no difference in graphics between the 1 and 2 this is suppose to be an "upgrade" not just a sequel to the story
Man feels just like the Web of Shadows/Ultimate Spider-Man days.
Looks at how the symbiote is shocked by electricity in the end. Could that hint to how we save Peter?
Kraven  💯💯
This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!
Why can’t the movies be this choreographed and action packed?
los npc ni atacan se quedan parados re xd
Как же похорошел Прототайп с последних времен )))
my excitement is immeasurable and my day has gotten extremely better
We better get the bully mcguire dance
Looks mid
Peter better watch who he's talking to. I will erase my save data multiple times until he regrets his actions.
Man, I want to play so fricking bad!
everything is great ! except for peters voice. but i mean the dialogue is great. the final shots of them side by side was spectacular. love it. amazing for sure. love the suits.
Un po' too much eh
will this be on ps4 too?
why are the kill buttons now square and triangle?
Gameplay is ultimate 💥💥
I'm so excited to play this on my favorite youtuber channels
Looks cool for the most part but why was he sking along with the drone instead of swinging? Sucks it's only going to be exclusive to the ps5
They add slingshot and web wings 😲😲😲
NOOOOOO just let me play as peter cant stand miles bad enough i had to tolerate forced stealth missions as him and mj last game now your gonna force me to play him throughout this one f that
It looks alright
the takedown on 3:10 feels like it came straight out of the Batman Arkham games, im absolutely all for it.
"He got away from us"...   Hints of Venom. I don't think he meant him and Miles
That waterskiing part with the Ganke-drone gives off Uncharted vibes. Actually can't wait for this!
Miles and Peter are gonna end up fighting or   Peter somehow gets the suit of and it goes to someone else like Eddie or something
this alone was worth the wait. sick!
At 6:50, Miles says to Peter, “Woah! Hey man. New threads?”   But Peter immediately changes the subject. This implies Miles has little to no knowledge about what the Symbiote is, and that this is very early on in Peter’s usage of the sentient goo.
❤❤❤😊
Cant wait for this game, love the symbiotic suit and the ablity to switch :), see everyone when they wanna come back in a few years feeling nostalgic
GREAT JOB!. the effort is greatly appreciated.
I feel like the video games are the only thing about Spider Man that Sony really takes their time with.
ALL I CAN HEAR IS SASUKE
Nice👍
Cant wait for this game.
Broooo this was a sick gameplay reveal
Literally freaking out about every aspect of the gameplay and story potential. I’m so excited for this game!!!!
I hope this game don't flop
YEAAAAA
3:09 THEY MADE THE MOVE!!! WEB OF SHADOWS MOMENT RIGHT HERE
Spiderman does not kill
oh they just keep getting better
I like how the symbiote makes Peter's fighting styles much more aggressive, I'd imagine the player is going to have a greater feel in combat. You're really going to be putting the hurt on the enemies from what if looks like.
Did they just leave those guys on the boat to drown
This game is gonna be fire 🔥🔥🔥
if Peter doesn't act like Bully Maguire in this game, then I'm not buying it
This what I like to seee Sony this is a masterpiece hopefully I get to stream this all day
..Only in PS5?
11:06 they did that flying thing dirty 💀
Man the gameplay looks sick I cannot wait for the release
Why didn't Peter get new flight animations? 😭
Ooo it looks the same
all i hope is that they don't make the missions with miles like the ones with atreus in God of war
I can not wait to get my hands on this game im so hype but i have a feeling it might get pushed back
I feel like this game is gonna be the successor to  Ultimate Spider-Man (the 2005 game)
This better be at least nominated for goty
This is the first time ive heard ANGY YURI LOWENTHAL
11:32 the way he just tossed the dude 😂 He was already on his feet when they landed so all peter had to do was let go of him, but the symbiote was like "nah, toss that mofo!"
Hi, it's me from 8 years ago
Enough with the Lizard, and Kraven! They've been done to death, Dr. Michael Morbious, or Hydro-Man would be so much better!
You two have been upgrading a lot
Beautiful. This one's also gonna be good.
Man.. this is great💯
I still need a ps4 hahaha noooo
just did was sold as soon as i saw the symbiote on spiderman, knew the game was gonna be better then number 1 hyped
11:32  *throws dude on the ground*  “See ya, chump.”
i would literally watch a whole movie like this
This looks awesome so far! Keeping what’s great about the first two games and expanding on it with new cool things.  What I want to see in this game: 1. Replayable story missions 2. Lots of new side activities and crimes in the free roam map 3. Replayable side activities 4. Really immersive boss fights that expand on the basics of the boss fights in the first 2 games.  5. Villain encounters in the open world. Imagine Lizard on the loose as a major crime in the free roam map, for example. 6. This one may be a stretch or may be a DLC idea, but playable Venom. This teaser shows the Symbiote gameplay mechanics are already there. Couple that with a larger, monstrous character that can cause destruction…. Yeah, that’d be pretty awesome as a side mode in the open world map
Bro this is gonna be amazing
Holy crap dude ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THS FOR 3 YEARS AND IT LOOKS TOO GOOOD ❤❤❤
Hopefully it will be on Xbox series x unlike the first game which was a huge disappointment because Xbox users couldn’t play the first game and couldn’t afford PlayStations
I love how the comment section always has the thoughts and analysis I’m doing in my head written already. This game is going to be EPIC
miles new lightning looks amazing, i love love love how it shows the bones and the fact that it’s blue to show that he has more control over it
Take all my money
YOU GOT GLIDERS
Game of the year right there
Oh man , Peter dark side is building up . I wonder how MJ or black cat going to handle that bad boy .
This spiderman is for ps4 and ps5?
Drone?? Miles Morales’ drone?? You seriously?? Miles Morales has a drone??
No doubt that this will be an incredible game
13,365 comment here lol prob gonna be my fav spiderman game since it has both i favor miles ngl
that's so goty man 200%
jeez the vemonized spiderman finisher are aggressive
Ok see you in 10 years
The ending of this trailer makes me think we're going to get miles versus Peter can't wait
This game looks dope!
Kraven hunted lizard and two spider man 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Yeah can’t wait to see bully maguire in this and his iconic black suit. 👈🏻👉🏻
I cant wait
Pooe miles😂
1:28 is that WRAITH??
Deadpool,Tombstone, guy with a mask,Spider man, Miles, and mysterious figure outide of the city
Gameverse peter is in the upcoming spiderverse animated movie right. Is this after or before the spidervese??
Web of Shadows done right!
Se ve increíble
a wingsuit, AND a bigger map, i cant wait to be swinging and gliding around
looks awesome but should be available on ps4 and don’t love the new display of controls
Mysterio better be in this game
Really like that Yuri's voice makes Peter sound like he is losing a part of him due to the symbiote, and the new animations look good
The greatest 12 minutes of all time 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm hyped for this game
WING SUIT OMG
Sorry fanboys, but this looks like it was made in 2008. Yiiikes.
Conners? Rage filled Symbiote Spiderman? Kraven? I'm pretty sure I watched a youtuber make a video about what he would do if he ran the Tom Holland Spiderman movies and it was similar.
Why would dude say anything until after he stabbed Kraven, he would've given himself away, and also, anyone else reminded of Prototype?
“Beware an old person, in a profession where many die young” is what comes to mind regarding this version of Kraven.
5:00 Miles - HADOKEN!
Somehow Peter is going to suffer greatly , but with great power comes great responsibility
Peter's aggressive behaviour due to Symbiote suit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best PS5 exklusiv game but I don't have a PS5.
Black cat is alive
Bro did a kamehameha and nobody noticed o.O 5:00
That was AWESOME
As soon as I saw the symbiote my jaw dropped
It's astonishing that throughout this demo I quickly forgot I wasn't watching a full fledged movie. How close can a video game get to making the player feel like he's in a Hollywood block buster?.. For me, this us the closest.  Spiderman slowly being corrupted by the venom suit, kravens menacing look, the advanced tech the hunting team uses, it's one big sensory overload . Nuff said, looks perfect.  See you on release day.
This is a Thousand times better than previous game and exactly what I was expected
To all the people coming back, this game is goat already🐐
Can't wait for the game!
w
Literally the best gameplay they could have given without spoiling things we didn't already know. The only nitpick i have is miles not having different animations swinging. I get that he is more experienced now but he should have some different flair. Other than that its a 1000000/10
Miles gonna need Jesus on his side. Because going up against a symbiote infected Yuri lowenthal spidey is like going up against an evil brainwashed Arkham Batman.
So only on PS5 right?
Insomniac should develop all marvel games!!!!
It's just... perfection
It’s funny how everything that Disney/marvel hasn’t struck their hand into has actually been good. (Spiderman except modern comics) (Any of James Gunn films)
I love at 11:30 when peter saves the civilian from the helicopter he just kinda trows in on the ground right after wards, just a great small detail of his symbiote suite
The world went from pixel to this in just 2 decades , really amazing
Most of it was great but they really gotta fix the whole water part, looked unfinished compared to the rest of it.
Sick af
Wtf is 1080p premium. Yt need to be stopped.
This. Looks. AWESOME. Period.
Please be on steam too lmao
Symbiote spidey so aggressive I can feel his rage coming inside of me
When Peter and Miles work together, I'm reminded of Batman and Robin working together as well.
I'm not sure how I feel about the flying/gliding.
“Get back here, Shocker!" SHOCKERRRRRRRRR……if you know…..you know.
miles and peter are quite dumb y don't they just copy what the dudes did in no way home web off each other in mid air
I really hope this eventually comes to PC.
No kne talking about the expanded map
I'm hoping they at least make a reference to Spider-Man 3 in this. Maybe with a Saturday Night Fever stride.
3:10 is crazy 🥶
Sasuke decided to be Spider-Man
Can’t say that I like that costume version 😮 I liked to be more alien than armored
I want in the future to see my coment this masterpiece.
I hope we don't have to get rid of the symbiote the combat looks way too fun
WING SUIT!!! When was the last time we got a good wing suit in a 3rd person game? Just Cause?
I don’t know it’s kind of generic staff to my eyes. This is just a movie that makes you press buttons at the right moment. We have seen those mechanics too many times before what’s the difference with the old Spider-Man?  I don’t see something new here too be honest. Ok it may has some nice story to tell but the gameplay is what matters in the end of the day.
I’m making a comment to myself when I get the game. Hello myself
Love the new ability’s and the symbiote suit
I love the facial expression when he says "So do I..." 11:54
y couldn't mile also wear the symbiyote
I see Peter is Final boss
I really love how to symbiote first attaches and then configurates according to the body structure of the host. It also looks like armor underneath which make it even better
Thank you, Insomniac Games! GOTY please!
I’ll be back in 8 years
So do I
Wow, I wonder if they will do a pc release the same time as PS release, I wonder🤔
11:55 did anyone peep how his eyes got more venom-like when he said that and then went back to normal form? It was so subtle, but it’s definitely foreshadowing the finale.
Will it be on PS4?
Bro the game looks so good 😭💯💯💯
Nowadays, The action sequences portrayed in  video game surpass the fight scenes found in Bollywood films.
Please bring it on ps4 too!
What a fresh way to use the black suit in the game story. Im getting Batman and Tim drake vibes. The black suit is just perfect. I wonder if theyll let us switch between normal suits and the black suit.
Poor me I don't have pc🥲 so I can't play this game🚶🏻but gameplay is top notch 🔥
The amount of flashback i have for Spider-Man 3 looking black spiderman costune and that voice acting is insane
Now I'm willing to play this game. I didn't want to play the last one, nor the Miles Morales edition. This makes me want to play all of them.
take my money!
Lizard… Venom… Kraven… I actually may cry this is amazing
Game of the year incoming 🤧
11:32 it's a nice touch to add that he just lets him fall on the ground
I’ll cry if they make one of Peters emote “one-liners” say “I’m gonna put some dirt in your eye” 😳🙏
Can’t wait
I really love how reminiscent it is of Web of Shadows' combat
Very glad I still get to experience the exaggerated swagger of a black teen.
This looks like a series of QTEs and flying through rings like Superman 64
I need miles Jordans 😭😭😭
BRO UVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONGG
so...... protoype 2 ?
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 looks stunning! So excited to play it, excellent job as always Insomniac Games 👏👏👏👏👏🕷️
SO COOL!!!!!
Its good 😍❤️
Reasons to buy PS6:
Miles will eventually stand up to Peter, because Peter takes it a “step to far”. Miles will lose, but it will be his belief if Spider-Man that really fails. Peter sees he has become a monster after the fight with miles. He tries to take off the suit, he does, Miles and Peter defeat Venom (as the final boss) and their friendship comes back together. This is how I’m predicting it. I hope I’m wrong. It’s the plot of Spider-Man 3 with elements of Web of Shadows and Ultimate Spider-Man games.
КАЛ
Snapcube better do a real time fandub for this one!
Deez nuts
I love how Peter is subtlety a douche cuz of the symbiote
Im excited for eddie
Horizon vs spidermann 😂
THIS IS SO TUFF!! And reminds me of Lego games
hey thats spiderman web of shadows cant wait to play it on my PC (well actually i can because im sure youre gonna f it up like last of us and im not gonna play it on console)
Bro how you record the videos?
Wow
WEB GLIDING!!!!!
When Kravens assistant shows him the scan of New York with it's various Heroes/Villians; one of them is Wraith aka Yuri Watanabe. 😮
This has to be a Bully Maguire dance scene
I love the gameplay! I haven’t been hyped for a game in a long time
11:55 got me chills.
I’m so hyped for this game
Why does it Look worse than the first game?
Canned Beans
The stealthy part during miles gameplay that he took the 2 guards there and the other in the corner just watching like nothing happened what’s the point then if it is that easy to stealth without anyone watching looks like bad ai hope that is not the case in the final game
Mini Godzilla
Bruh why they got the witness motif playing what the hell
I really want Miles to tell Pete to chill
Fking insane
I’m excited to see people’s reactions and gameplay of this and I’m wondering if theradbrad is gonna get early access to it
Hello me in few years
My 8 year old brother lost his mind
🔥🔥🔥
Holy cow bro,that was insane!!!
I haven’t played any Spider-Man game since Spider-Man 2 on GameCube can’t wait to play this looks dope
Great new features 🔥... Can't wait to play! Symbiote suit🥵🔥
10:10 - Remember Crocodile chase from «Kung Fu Panda» game?
kraven will die come back to this comment when he does
Nice interactive movie, it's not really a game though is it?
Bully Lowenthal, anyone? No?
Is the map bigger?
Spider-Men.
This game is gonna have to REALLY make Miles appealing to play as.  For me.  Cause Peter looks way better.  It just frustrates me to no end though how there's no Venom game yet though.  That would be sick.  Still though.  This looks amazing.
Insomniac's Spiderman. Get it right
oh i am SO excited for this
this is so fire i cant wait for this to come out
Bruce Wayne trembled when Parker danced in battle 😁
Cry this trash was so mid😂. Guys please they are working so hard to spam this reply in every comment here atleast give them attention they need it, reply them they are really poor and needs help😊
yoo
Cold
Love it
I love symbiotes I’m the marvel series
Finally a trailer
awesome
Now we just need to be able to buy a PlayStation 5. 😅
Crazy tbh
It's just Spider-Man again, only with a different default skin... I'll take it!! 🔥😻🎮
Everyone else: This looks AMAZING 🤩  That 'one' guy: You can't even drive the jet ski!? You can do that in GTA!  So lame 🙄
awesome gameplay I love this
something that made me sad is there's no multiplayer in the gameplay reveal
Why does Peter sound like Sasuke?
Sequel? AWESOME!
Anyone else see Deadpool on that map in the beginning?
Can this be a movie instead 😅
New era starts now
I gotta stream this full game when this drop
I don’t about you, but this is lookin like game of the year to me
I'm glad they've returned the symbiotic features from Shattered Dimensions. 😍😍
Love all the differences In Peter’s behaviour 1: Obviously the way he talks 2: Contemplating whether he should go after The Lizard or save civilians, Peter would never hesitate to save Civilians 3: Throwing the civilian to the ground directly after saving him 4: Snatching the tracker from Miles 5: Him just saying a flat “Fine” after Miles comes up with the Alley-Hoop
deadpool!
This too fire 🫨
HOOLEEE FOOOK
I can watch this for hours 🥶 When is this coming to pc?
Why does Peter in the symbiote suit sound like MatPat
Wow just wow….just wow amazing
"So do I"
I'm a big fan of venom and he's back and more merciless than ever
V🔥🤟🏽
Looks good.
Feel like I’m going to be the only one who’s not yet fully convinced. So far I see the same game. Just a different story, some added powers, and extended map. I hope We get to see some actual innovative gameplay elements in the future.. I don’t know I just hope it’s more than bells and wistles. This feels like the helicopter chase all over again. Also Yuri lowenthall really didn’t sell me this badguy peter parker at all. If anything it felt overacted. But that’s just my opinion. Hope they innovate in some way and release the game in a polished state.
The wather looks horrible😂😂
Meh Looks generic as hell
Wow, I've never seen a venom Spider-Man that actually has the same hours as venom and Spider-Man, I absolutely love how they executed this version of the black suit, absolutely iconic, immediately.
These graphics don’t looks so good in my opinion, that water when the civilians ship gets hit 🤢
Bruh this so amazing🤯🤯🤯🤯
Why'd they change Venoma color
see you on PC in 2 - 3 years later 😅
just absurd
Clip starting with Rocky Bhai 😂
This might be the only game tht  could comepete with totk
Cant wait for this game I hope Miles gets to use venom
Looks like gaming back at its peak boys
Yuri channeling his inner Christopher Daniel Barnes right about now.
Got the venommmmmm in him
please confirm if the enemies live after these attacks
Bro Peter is a menace
YES, Slingshots are an ability now
This is how I think its gonna be, those 4 mechanical limbs in the reveal trailer are going to be the symbiote powers replacement in some way, they are less a reference to the Stark suit and more towards a nod towards Dr Otto who tried to have similar mechanical extensions, but this time without the side effect (and perhaps because of Peter's superhuman quality, he's more suited to having 4 extra limbs neurologically linked to his brain). I believe those 4 limbs are going to be more than just extra 4 legs, there might be gadgets or techs installed on them to compensate the loss of Venom.
10:23 Well your name is spiderman and that's an lizard man so basically you are lizard food
Woooow!
It's f*cking incredible
I like how symbiote Pete does nice things aggressively
You can already tell how great this game is gonna be just by this short clip.
Just take my money already !
HYPED TO THE BONE!!!
uff estaria tremendo ver a spiderman con las habilidades del simbionte en las peliculas live action
It will be a record creator
The way he deepens his voice is EXTREMELY reminiscent to that infamous 90's series moment    SHOOOOOOCKEEEEEER ILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH !!!!
I just felt like I was watching a movie! Truly amazing and worth the wait! And they were right about the game making our jaws drop! 🛐🔥
I am so hyped for this game
If anyone noticed the logo details at the end, I think Insomniac may be hinting at Mile’s new electric power having an effect on the symbiote..? Showdown between Miles and Venom?
Love Kraven, Venom and Lizard, _hate_ the idea of having to play as Miles.
This kinda looks like the Game Prototype :D
Man I can’t wait to see the miles vs. symbiote Peter boss fight! It’s gonna be insane! P.S I wonder if someone is gonna reply to this that the game is “mid” and their opinion is based!
This is…AMAZING!!!🔥🔥🔥
This is epic.
better start working on a PC port asap because i'm NOT BUYING a PlayStation. not sure why "exclusives" are still a thing these days. you just hurt your own sales.
Final boss about to be symbiot spudetman
This was really mid
Уныло. Такое чувство, что этот некст на изи в пс4 запустится. Ситуация, как с Рагнарёком повторяется. Когда показали геймплейный трейлер первой части - там был отвал башки, абсолютно новый взгляд на игру по пауку. Здесь же минимум новых идей, а старые фишки вообще не поменяли никак (полеты на паутине). Боевка за черного паука смахивает на прототип, тентакли огромные и неуклюжие, даже в ВОШ и том было изящнее. Единственный момент порадовал, где паук затоптал моба ногами в стену дома, это креативно, это улыбнуло. В остальном - некстгеном даже не пахнет. Никакой физики, никакой разрушаемости, скучнейшие QTE без везкого основания и снова эта унылая секция с гаванью, которая еще в Майлзе заебала. Будто это самое четкое место чтобы показать паучий экшн XD Еще этот ебанутый худ, залепивший низ экрана и вся игра из-за этого будто в рамке... А рамки надо ломать. Insomniac не сломали, а только пукнули. Но все счастливы и ссут кипятком. Мда уж.
give me this game right now plsss
This is looking like it might be the best iteration of the change in Peter’s personality upon getting the symbiote outside of the comics. Peter was menacing from the second he came on screen. The extreme violence in the way he took down Kraven’s men, the way he talked to Miles, the fact that Miles didn’t sense him coming before he showed up, him visibly hesitant to go save those civilians because he’d rather go after the Lizard & being visibly irritated because he chose to save them(when he dropped the guy on his face). And finally the “he got away from US” & we all know he wasn’t talking to Miles. He was legitimately scary.
3:07 my god this poor man lmao
💳💳💳💳💳
Mean while on Xbox: Durr redfall and urr starfield
Crispy af
I’m basically watching a movie at this point, insomniac W
OH MY FREAKINGGG GAWWD!!!😍😍😍 I am speechless
This is going down in the books and in like 10 years nostalgia finna hit lmao.
OK sold me get a ps5
I tought it is going to be bad but now wow
AWWWW SHII VENOM
KRAVEEEEEEEEEEEN!!! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME! I'LLCHASEYOUTOTHEENDSOFTHEEEEEEEEAAAAAARRRRRRRTHH!!!!
Parker sounds like Sasuke Uchiha
wow somehow just realized yuri plays peter. his aggressive - symbiote voice is very sasuke
Why does angry Spider-Man lowkey sound like angry MatPat
Pls release it for ps4 too
Honestly it's not bad.
I didn't expect Spider-Man 2 to be so tense and awesome! Seems so much ahead of first game in every aspect.
Gas... It's literally, all Gas! 🔥😎
I want this game NOW but I have a high-end PC. Another 5 year wait?
30fps in 2023...
can't wait for this one!!! starting with that amazing kraven intro and his awesome background music and seeing spidey with his venom powers is just so cool!!! insomaniac is the best studio making spiderman games.
I kinda hope we get a miles vs peter where you get to choose who to fight as.
So all it takes is the Venom symbiote for Spider-Man to *really* sound like Sasuke
I don’t even have a PS5 and I’m excited! Can’t wait to watch this game whenever it comes out! Love the first 2 games and everything from this one looks fantastic!
Peter/Venom vs miles
I don’t know, but it looks like his punches don't have weights, they don’t feel the real. And why spider man is flying ?
This comment section reeks of incels.
We re deffiniyely getting a green goblin version of Harry on this one as a surprise villain,just as we got doc ock in the first game.According to the first trailer,Peter may be the first one that s getting the symbiote,so Harry taking the symbiote somehow is how he can save his own life just as he did with goblin in Tasm 2.That would be the second option considering that in this gameplay,Peter mentioned that Harry s dying.😁
нормально так
ONLY 600 GB LETS GO!!!
Gameplay feels... weird. But still looking amazing!
Trailer: *shows Spiderman using venom suit powers* Me: What in the Alex Mercer!?
Xbox nothing wtf
Loving that combat with the symbiote.
fight mechanics remind me of gk imo, and also its a w that sasuke voices spidey! Looking forward to playing this game!
🤩😍WOW. THIS AMAZING. KRAVEN, LIZARD, BLACK SUIT. THAT'S... BEAUTIFUL. MARVEL I LOVE YOU
Mmmyeah...Web Of Shadows will remain my favourite game . Yyyep .
This game is going to be amazing! Let’s just hope it’s not as short of a game like the Miles Morales one…
This video is not even uploaded in 4K 😂😂😂😂😂lmao
I'm just blown away..... MCU should take notes.
web of shadows
I hope there would be a multiverse dimension in this game
Peet’s never like that miles cuz the symbiont is controlling him. And in his head.
Yo, yes i was here before they relased it. But i know that you are here to relive old memories :)
Love the lizard design, this gonna be good
👍ok
Fxxk yeah
Where's the Venom?
3rd Spiderman installment and still no ps5 in market
sider
That “So do I” 🥶 11:55
HUGE CURVEBALL
Lol venom content will  be behind a pay wall
Is it Prototype 3? 😂😂
Bully Maguire is back
SHOKEEEEEER
Dejo este comentario aquí, quizás algún día vuelva feliz de haber comprado la PS5 y haber podido jugar los tres juegos
Shockerrrrrrr
무쳤다 😂
PG prototype
I wanted Spider-Man 2... not Spider-Man and Miles Morales.
Ok. I've seen enough.  Shut up and take ALL my money!!!
The Miles Vs. Peter fight is gonna be something
I have all ready watched this 18 times
Yuri's bringing some Sasuke vibes to Peter.
😭😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yea the inevitable "Miles vs Peter" fight is gonna slap so hard
I hope peter turns into a villain for a while when he has the symbiote. A spider-man that doesn't care who he hurts, how much he hurts and is filled with rage would be the scariest thing. The gameplay would be epic from Mile's perspective.
Game 💯 Recent marvel movies trash🚮
So... Kraven just has no redeeming or honorable qualities this time around now? The dude just goes hunting with his own personal PMC?
I love how sneakily Insomniac Games has stolen the spotlight from Rocksteady Steady. This is how you make a high-quality single-player game Rocksteady so better cancel that Suicide Squad garbage.
Spoder man
Make game on captain America Or iron man
Nice gameplay
god i hope shocker isn't in this game for his sake, SHOCKERRR!!!
Looks great fun but not current gen graphics. Might mean it's on PS4 and PS4 Pro as well.
A PS4 game makes anoter 2.1M views. Great job, Marvel!
Love the detail that Miles didn't detect Peter coming because the symbiote is immune to Spider-sense after bonding and replicating Peter's abilities
Wow looking forward to this even more now
Kraven nice
I like how the symbiote acts like a bio weapon peter can use
PS3
i  ight be the only one but i dont think the sybiote suit is 10 id rate it a solid 7. i feel ive seen better symbiote skin mods
Kinda curious to see how Peter gets the suit this time around, especially given the implications of the last game. Obviously, he knows what's up with Harry here. Very curious.
this game seem absolutely incredible but my one issue with it is how the water animation doesnt flow right and at some points is a bit jank and ik its a bit nitpicky but its a big part of this trailer so why stuff it up we have seen companies make water animations as smooth as butter like batman arkham knight which is 8 YEARS OLD or even red dead 2 we have seen it happen and work so why not put in the extra effort to make everything look fantiastic rather than cut corners idk random take
please do switch karakter spiderman and miles like GTA 5😭🤩
Just wanna tell my kid i was here
am I the only one who dislikes Genke. He's really annoying with his puns/jokes. I know he's suppose to be cheesy but it feels so forced.
The amazing spider-man 3 please
I hope we still have the Raimi Suit and then we get both red and black suit from the movies
Symbiote suit has never looked so good in motion
Gonna buy a ps5 just for this one fr
bully Peter has entered the game
I can't wait to beat the symbiote off Peter as Miles! I'm calling it right now, Peter boss fight!
Prototype meets batman meets spiderman all in one,this is incredible
Awesome! Lizard, venom, kraven and spider-men with wingsuits? Hell yeah. This will be one hell of a swing!  Btw: Was there deadpool on kravens tablet? 😂
Remind me Web of Shadow how he fight❤
IS THAT KRAVEN?
Wtf graphics on Spiderman 2 its like ps4 omg 😂😂
please tell me we can play as venom at one point
HOLY AAHJAHWJAHAHA IM SO HYPED BRO
GOTY right here
I lost it when I saw that you could switch between Peter and Miles, I hope you can do that with other characters like Black Cat but even if it's just the Spider-Men that is a cool feature. So happy I got a PS5 for Hogwarts Legacy, this is my next reason to take vacation days.
Miles fight is just❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
🙌🏿🙌🏿can't wait
My spider-sense is telling me this game is going to be EPIC
3:10 I never thought i'd see spider-man proceed to kick a guys nuts up his body like that but here we are
Bruh this gameplay is gold
Wow
I would like the symbiote to transfer from suit to suit...I want Bully Maguire
Spooderman 2 Many Cranes.
Too epic
The tendrils, the edgy lines, the aggressive tone. This reminds me of Web of Shadows and words cannot express how much I love that.
Oh god symbiote Peter is more violence than before
i must be awful it to find about Spiderman 30 years after everyone
11:35 when Peter said "He got away from us" was he talking to Miles or..?
This makes me wonder if Miles is going to have to fight Peter when he gets too crazy...
I lost my words how good this looks. 😍
these guys really did a twelve minute trailer
I was so immersed into the gameplay to the point where I was looking for buttons to press lmao
Now im completely excited
so excited!!!
We better get to keep those Symbiote powers or Peter gets something that replaces them after the main story is over/venom becomes a thing
It looks like a PS4 Game!
Boy what the hell boy
I hope we get to see boss fight between miles and symbiot peter :)
This version of symbiote spidey better be a top 3 menace
amazing .
oh boy, this looks so sick
We need a movie
11:53 “He’s got big teeth” “So do I”. I LOVE the subtle change in his eyes to venoms eyes. This gameplay clip was a work of art in SO MANY ways
Sasuke Parker 🤨🤔😅😅
Why graphic is so bad??
I can't wait to see gamers game plays! I'm hoping this will be on PS4 as well
Looks amazing… sucks that it’ll be stuck behind a playstation pay wall, i’ll just wait for the PC port like last time 👌
Yay
2023 attendence 🎉
Im bricked up
The water is surprisingly mid.
I’m very interested to see a battle between Kraven and Taskmaster.
So if they calling Pete Spider-Man what’s miles moniker
From that first little bit of the new hunt I can already tell the map is going to be bigger
Black spider-man AND black spider-man in one game?!? 😮
Serious Peter is scary af ngl
I’ll be ready
Yeah im thinking 5 stars
UI is not ready yet
Does he have the n-word pass now
Where's the trans representation? KRAVEN SHOULD BE A TRANSMAN!
Another waste of money
miles looks cool i like it.
Dang Yuri going all out! He's always been one of my favorite voice acters ever since hearing him voice Sasuke. Can't wait to see more of this game.
This reminds me of prototype lmao
There's clearly a lot going on lol. I hope Peter's story is the central focus while sharing time with Miles, Kraven, the Lizard and Venom. I know it's gonna be at least really good, but a part of me can't help but get Spider-Man 3 vibes. That said, I hope we get the Tobey Maguire Venom styled suit! And the original Raimi "Webbed" suit too again🤞🏽
Hello there Nostalgia 20 years from now 😘😀
Black suit spider man🤤 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
11:54 The spirit of bully maguire has entered his body
Watching this GAVE ME THE CHILLS! l NEED THIS GAME SO BAD!
I’m ALIVEEEEERR IIIIIIIIIIII
All i wanted to see is the first Spiderman character instead of tom holland inspired remastered for ps5, that agressive voice doesn't suit the tom model
they're def setting up a fight between miles and peter. and I'm all up for it.
I'm having Spider-Man 3 vibes. (The video game tie in that is.)
I hope that the ending is going to be a setup for web of shadows it will cool if it happens
This is MARVELous!!!!      I LIKE IT!!!!  This might/will be another masterpice....
I came.
Really excited for this one but in a lot of outdoor scenes the textures don't look that good and it's more apparent in that jetski sequence. The water fx especially.. I look at miles' suit and there's so much detail and then I look everywhere else. Then again it might just be me.
good job marvel
It’s spider man 3?
Can't wait for coryxkenshin's reaction to 3:11
ll the classic spidey storylines together. symbiote spiderman/venom, harry sick (possibly green goblin), craven the hunter plus lizard in one timeline with miles morales all within a single game. absolutely peak.
Finaly good sumbiote costume and skills like spiderman web of shadows 2. Maybe here u will be able to be evil or good too with different ending
It's going to be one of the best superhero games mark my word I'll be back here after one year
My graphics card cried after watching this video!
TASK MASTER AND LIZARD????
I want this game yo focus more on Peter Spiderman  It would only make sense
this game is gonna be so good bru
Banger otw
Miles: Wait, he's got big teeth. Venom: So do I!!!
For everyone thinking abt it after watching this the answer is yes miles and Peter will fight ....let me explain why
Prototype 3
At this point I fully accept Yuri as the voice of Peter Parker
Wow
This is what Microsoft needs. A superhero game because let’s be fr  It was really final fantasy, metal gear, and Spider-Man. At this rate Microsoft is going under and star field isn’t gonna save it. When it happens I hope we still get elder scrolls 6
this is amazing, wow
Miles and Pete are gonna fight, dudes already tripping in the symbiote
dammit Spider-Man, don't make me buy something I can't afford.
Brings back memories from Spiderman 3 PSP days with the venom suit
great gameplay but why does corners as a lizard look like Godzilla just not what I was expecting and were is venom?
Looks aight
Every time Peter talks aggressively, all I can hear is Sasuke 😂
Lizard looks amazing!!
I loved the first one. Probably the best Spiderman game I've ever played. This looks so awesome.
I'm sold! Well I was sold at the beginning but now i'm even more sold! Miles with more bio electric abilities and Peter with symbiote power. And these are just some of the possibly new upgrades.
absolute peak.
Ill say it since nobody is saying it I hate the black suite design in the close ups it seems bulky and not sleek
7:34 assassins creed nod or what?
This is amazing! I can’t wait!
Why kraven? He’s so lame. He’s the lamest Spider-Man villian followed by mysterio.
Why does Peter talk like Batman sometimes
Why does me why did Sergei look like a lesbian
The amount of nostalgia feels insane. Being able to go across to queens like we did in the old PS2 Ultimate Spider-Man game. Besides that, the symbiote combat reminds me of Spider-Man web of shadows, and to top it off. We get bully Parker.
I thought harry was going to be the venom
Love how the bad guys can also mostly unexplainably get all these henchmen and equipment. Is there a number to call like 1800badguys or something?
W game
Anyone after 10 years, this game is gonna blow everyone's mind!
Holy shi- Yuri actually now has become Wraith If you pause at 1:29  you will "Wraith" which is Yuri We even see that all Villains from the past games are still in New York     i didnt expect this much detail from the game for just a tiny scene
Mind = 🤯
If this is Spiderman, The Wolverine game is gonna be 🤯
My only hope is that they don't use some contrived plot device to kill off Peter so that Miles can be the main character from this point on. I don't think Peter needs to die for Miles to be a solid character on his own. I also love the dynamic of Peter teaching Miles to be a good hero.
My man's channeling Sasuke energy. Love to see it
Why does kraven need henchman..
Not even spider man anymore dude just flying in the wind like a bird
😂@11:32
OH GOD YESSSSSS!!! RIGHT FROM THE VOICE TO THE STORY TO THE GAMEPLAY, EVERYTHING IS PERFECT!!!!
Venom suit is giving me Prototype vibes. Looks awesome.
Meus Deus pqp isso ta incrivel cara vctn mlk olha essa porra isso é arte pura.
This looks incredible. But unfortunately going to be another 2-3 more years before I ever see this on PC
Is it play station 5 ?
I love how the symbiote suits tribute to spectacular spider man.
11:33  like peter really? Gotta give him a little push?
I love the fact that they have put the efforts to Innovate the gameplay mechanics. We all know the story was going to be cool but what I didn't expect was innovative gameplay. They literally gave them a flying cape and catapult jump. That's how you know they have conviction in making games not cash grabs.
I am so confused on the story right now
Pete lowkey sounds like MatPat
OMG IT’S SO COOL
Adipurush se accha VFX hai
So the choice is black suit peter or miles...  Is it really even a choice?
Take my card!
Bruuuuh symbiote suit spidey looks so clean 😤🔥👌
Idk why but im not really digging the symbiote suit. It just looks and feels kinda weird
11:37 I love how Peter says "he got away from us" miles probably thinks he's talking about meaning both him and peter..but we know peter is referring to himself and the symbiote ;)
This is just simply as you would say marvelous
Exciting
Ganke has a glider 👀
Perter now sounds like sasuke
Lizard looks boss
Who in the world is sasuke almost every comment is about sasuke
Oh my god OH MY GOD. Kraven and Conners in the same game??? I FEEL SPOILED. DUDE, Imagine Rhino returns and we have a threeway battle between Spidey, Kraven, and Rhino? Especially with those mecha-beasts. BROO SPIDEY SUPREMACY AHHHH THEY KEEP MAKING HITS BABY
Even without the black suit players would absolutely rock a single npc for no reason
Man can’t wait to see the ultimate move in symbiote suit, it probably be similar to prototype 2
I hope sony and mcu tom holland spider-man 4 in inspired the game insomniac will be biggest action and Blockbuster
J'annonce ce jeu va être le jeu de l'année 2023
MAN the Lizard looks like a crocodile more than a lizard and I like it 🤩
"He's mine.." that is all I needed to hear from that black suit. Also I'm curious if I will have to confront Wraith..
They really gave him Spiderman TAS symbiote voice, I wonder if we'll chase shocker in this game 😂😂😂
HAMKARA
I’m surprised no one acknowledged the fact this mission is a reboot of the kraven vs lizard mission in the Spider-Man 3 game. Which includes the final boss of that mission being a giant version of the lizard. All the elements are there and they found a way to make it relevant to the story this time
This making me thirsty 4 the insomniac Wolverine game. I hope its rated M and have alots of blood n gore but something like this.
I realllllly hope this game is gonna be longer than the last especially with Miles and Peter being playable
My wallet after I buy this📉
FK sony exclusives 👎🖕👎
0:46 Before you kill a camper
Wow, amazing
Peter has that "SHOCKER! ILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!" vibe in his voice.
Thank god I wore my rubber undies before watching this.
Some kids watching this will be the men who will visit us again after 10 years..
GTA V-swapping of characters between Peter & Miles.
Peter sounds more funny than menacing XD “It’s time to go boom boys”
but where is spiderman?
I'll be leaving this comment for the next 5 years when someone wants to feel the nostalgia again and say "2028, anyone?"
GET BACK HERE KRAVENN  KRAVVEEEENNNNNNNNNNNN  YOU CANT ESCAPE MEEEE  ILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTHHHHHHHHHHH
This looks so good
Bro let the intrusive thoughts win
Peter got that edgy kinda voice 💀
Is that task master ?!?
I hope miles has to fight peter in order to get the symbiote off just for miles to get stuck with it
sheeeeeesh
11:53 SO DO I * BA BA BA BAAAA BAAAAAAAA*
What an intro this is. Excited for the whole story now!
I’m sad how I don’t have a ps5
I really love the gameplay the symboites moves, dodges, reflexes.  I feel like miles is going to fight peer because of the symboite, This game is definitely making it.
Really wish this was also in xbox..
Что же получается, Русы против ящера?
WTF? The venom moves are INSAAAAAANEEEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ill get ps5 for this
spiderman actually fully using the symbiote powers is awesome
The game will be lost if Peter with symbiot suit doesn't start dancing.
1:28 you can see Yuri as Wraith, her character design is not bad
Did I just see deadpool
Meh just don't be cheap. I still feel none of the testers ever player bo1 smh
Lizard slowly becoming Godzilla 98'. They got so close to saying, "wow, that's a lot of fish."
black suit from 1994 spider man cartoon!!! whaaat
Venom suit feels like Prototype lite 😂😂
All these cinematic camera angles during combat are VERY jarring, like wtf? the webslinging looks cool tho
If for spider sense they use those long indicators, I am not playing this game. Second, no need to use so many colors for options and menu, that is just unnatural in spider man game. These are the only 2 issues I have, and surprisingly they are not there in either spider man 1 and spider man miles morales. 3rd no green indicators for enemies in stealth missions please, it looks very bad and no white spider sense circle
Incredible. Insomniac putting out another banger. Hoping eventually we get Wolverine news too.
Would love to see Miles vs Peter showdown
so u guys got an exact date of when this be released
Just gave away the entire game before release
Honestly, not impressed at all .
Release it on PS4 plz
I'm loving Peter's darker and more troubled voice. Yuri Lowenthal is once again doing an amazing job voicing Spider-Man. This is gonna end up being the greatest superhero game ever made.
11:30 Love the small details already showing. Like even with the symbiotic suit Peter still ultimately makes the right decision and saves people, but just tosses the guy after because he’s more interested in getting back to what he wanted to do
Like how it's affecting him and his moves are definitely cool but I don't know if they're lore/comic book accurate
I absolutely love it when Peter says "So do I" near the end.
Web of Shadows 2?
Anyone else hoping we get at least  level with a full on symbiote rampage?
Kraven’s triceps have more definition than a gigachad jawline.
So cool. Reminds me of 'Prototype 2'
Sick of exclusive.. I wanna be able to run this at max on pc
This looks awesome.
Black cat must’ve taken the muck. OK so there’s no proof in any of my pictures but I know I didn’t take it, and what’s with Doctor C ? Spidey saved him from a permanent case of lizard breath!—I mean how could he betray the ol’ web-head that way, and how am I ever gonna clear my friendly neighborhood name…- Spider man as the Symbiote takes over.
Имба
Venom be coming
I honestly love that we'll be able to go into the more residential districts and suburbs of new york
cant wait for it to release on pc in 2027!!
Game is looking good especially the symbiote, man I hope we get to play as venom which to be honest might very well happen since Im sure at some point your going to have to give up the suit. I cant see the studio just throwing away all those animations and skill points you invested so I bet Venom will be a playable character probably. the main baddy seems to be Kraven. I will say that some of the graphics look a little rough and there is some frame rate dropping in this trailer especially around the water chase parts...hopefully it will get polished out. I kind of wish the Lizard didnt look so much like Killer Croc and had the more classic look but its still cool other then those minor grievances I am very excited to play it
Is it just me or does the motif for Kraven sound like the Darkness motif from Destiny 2?
Aahhh now this is how sauske suppose to act must awaken his mangekeyo underneath his new suit 😂 game finna be lit!
I like how the web swinging has upgraded a bit the webs look really strong like a steel cable or something, man I have to get a ps5 for this
Kinda sounds like Sasuke in the black suit lol
Not an improvement on swinging and combat. Shame.
Imagine if miles is the final boss with the venom who was taken control of him and Peter has to fight him. That would be so epic
Did you guys notice how "quip"-less spiderman (pete) was? I love symbiote spidey😂
Makes me excited for what they'll bring to the Wolverine game
This game is just love ❤
What a HUGE gameplay! 🩵 GJ Sony
That symbiote combat is slick and so smooth!
Interface is just awful
Love how when he says “So do I” at the end you can see his eye lenses slightly change a bit into Venom
THE BEST GAMEPLAY REVEAL I'VE SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME! ABSOLUTELY CAN'T WAIT!
SPIDER-MAN!
I might be in the minority on this, but I’m not a fan of the black suit design. I wish it looked more slick, not armor plated. Other than that the game play looks absolutely amazing!
We need to see miles vs Peter to save him from the symbiote suit
This was awesome!!  Only thing I don’t like is swinging in venom suit, feel like there should be more power to his swinging when Peter is in the venom suit
I was here
Peter literally became a ninja
12:22 FALL
I can’t wait to terrorize Shocker in the black suit.
can't wait till he yells at shocker 🤣
Now this is the actual Spider-Man 3 game I remember playing as a kid even though it’s 1000x better.
$70 for a DLC 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
These spiderman are killers
yeahhggg
Oh man, Venom vs The Lizard is going to happen!
Sasuke really showing himself in this one lol
Check the puddles
REALLY LOVE THE NEW ADDITION GEARS THEY HAVE ITS SO COOL
Why do Venom Symbiote always makes Peter like he was on period,  While if it was on Eddy Brock , Cletus Cassidy, Flash, and etc. They are mostly in control.
Nice detail at 11:36 when Peter says "He got away from us" you can tell he's not speaking to Miles but to the symbiote also at 11:53 when he says "So do I" in response to Miles you can see the suit's eyes become jagged just like Venom's
What the🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
We’re all wet
No PC release :( gaaahhh I dont wanna get a ps5
Питера, белого гетеросексуального мужчину сделали тупым и безответсивенным. Зато чёрный Майлз на его фоне смотриться круто.
Astonishing 😭😭 take my money rnnn😭😭😭😭 even tho i m broke I'll be more than happy to but it on day one even if i lose money 😭😭
Stoked beyond compare!
Wow
Will they be releasing on pc ?
I really don't like Miles as a character, but the symbiote stuff looks sick. They really didn't hold back.
Cannot wait for this! Loved the first one!
Peter's kinda 👀👀
The ui looks clean
I was thinking this is the middle of the game but I’m now thinking it’s a little earlier than that. It’s definitely not the beginning. Probably 2nd act, right after Peter gets the symbiote. Peter having to deal with Yuri(Wraith), Connors becoming the Lizard & them finding out the truth about Harry being sick likely all happened before this point in the game.
1 word. BRAVO!
Ima I crazy but I didn’t see the eyes show facial expressions like squint or anything like that for Spider-Man 🙃
YO.
That guy who was kicked rapidly against the wall, That was personal.
I feel like this could be a metaphor for substance abuse.
See y’all here! I’m definitely gonna play this game fosho 🚀
Gonna play this on pc so I can get a mod that puts in the old Peter Parker face
Bruh... Stealth is so boring, especially in spider man games. Why would you add it?
Those who remember web of shadows this is our comeback baby
SPIDER-MAN 2 😊  Peter Parker and Miles Morales the Spider Team 🕸 🕷   Kraven the Hunter going to be tough + venom is no joke   PS5 Exclusive
SPIDER-MAN 2 😊  Peter Parker and Miles Morales the Spider Team 🕸 🕷   Kraven the Hunter going to be tough + venom is no joke   PS5 Exclusive
lol the comments people dont understand its the suit thats making peter parker aggressive
This game looks magnitudes better than the last 2 and every other Spiderman game as well...speechless
can't wait to play!
Gonna cry?
the only nitpick i have is that they revealed the black suit with so much footage and gameplay, its almost like a big spoiler for the section of the game, sure it could be predicted that he'll get the suit but it still wasnt known, this felt like a spoiler and like they showed a little too much
But how did peter get venom because we saw Harry having it in the first game
Nah Peter is fighting like a demon. 😢😢
I can’t wait to mod TF out of this game and play as Shrek again
Looks absolutely amazing. I’m loving the new symboite powers and miles straight firing electrical blasts at people.  Looks fun as hell.
I love the difference in UI between Pete and Miles.
deadpool?
Oh My Days This Is just Brilliant
At 4:58 Did miles do a Kamehameha lmao
Peter sounds like Sasuke
PLEASE PUT IT ON PC!!!!!
Waiting for harry💚
I love how fast the movement is... So fluid! I'm so hyped for this game.
You ever get so excited over a trailer that you don’t know if you even want to watch it or just marinate in the excitement for a bit?  Yeah, that’s me at the moment.
what if miles have to fight peter
i will pay my soul to play this game
dont really care how much this will cost, im buying
I’m buying Sony again 👍🏽💯
Those who bought an xb onex needs to get a refund.  What a waste of money and no AAA 1st party games to show for 😂🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡
shut up!! and take my money
I love that they’re doing the black suit arc but with Miles adding a whole new dynamic to it
Miles morales look amazing. Can't wait to play
The water animations were the only ugly part
see ya guys in like 20 years when some kid relives their memories of this game like i did for spider man 2
Does this mean the Spider-Man 3 black suit is in the game?
They did their thing on this one wow!
Yikers white male gameplay. 🤢🤮
I really hope the stealth is actually good in this game
This looks incredible.
11:00 Peter goes straight for the ally oop while Miles saves the civilians! the attention to details 💯
Bro, I've only watched 3 min and I already see this game winning an GOTY
The firt glims of the gameplay was so good and Peter is being aggressive like bully maguire and miles looks more experienced now with his special powers iam glad they show peter's new powers i hope even after ending the game we have venom suit or chance to become venom sony should alos release a game of venom with his side of story and perspective btw gameplay was fire🔥🔥🔥
Cool now add it to ps4
Miles and genke as insufferable as ever 🙄
Cs M9 Bayo?
Prototype + Infamous = Spider Man 2
Cant wait to wait for 4 years to play this game on PC. Sheesh.
I love how the roles are switched now, normally it’s Peter keeping Miles in check but now it’s Miles keeping Peter in check. Love that story telling. Looks like they took some inspiration from web of shadows with that symbiote combat. Also the web wings look phenomenal. This looks absolutely incredible.
Take my money.
This looks like it could run on a PS4 as well. The graphics don't look that different
Somebody tell me if I’m being too critical but it looks like besides the the wings, they did nothing to the swing mechanics? They look just as shallow, hopefully I’m wrong. Great looking story though
Prototype 2 with an extra step
The first game was mainly technology with all the villains and Spider-Man relying on spider tech. Now, it’s biology. And I. Am. Loving it!!!
Now we got 2 black Spidermen
It looks amazing. I hate the drones though. It just seems like a cheap waste when they add some robot dog or whatever to complicate things.
I HECKING LOOOOOVE MARVEL!!!!! 🤓🤓🤓
Okkkk okkk.. Dopeeee
PS4?
Past 3 years never felt the need to upgrade to the 5 but this got my full attention!!, looks great
Angelo Bronte? 0:57
the only thing that I don't like is that it's gonna be the new tom holland face
I was unsure with how insomniac would approach gameplay after miles morales, but the idea to give it web of shadows level powers for Peter is just absolutely spectacular.
God, that chase feels like a mashup between uncharted and Spider-Man, looks incredible, can’t wait
OUTSTANDING 💙🕷️🕸️♥️
3:14 absolutely sick
This gives me Spidey screaming "shoockkkaaa" vibes from the animated series
Why does Peter's voice actor sounds like the dub voice of Sasuke Uchiha?
I dont like Miles, because he is too op compared to Peter. Just imagine if Miles gets symbiot, how broken he could be? Venom with stealth.
Yoooo miles suit is fire
Marvel just thank you
If we have to fight venom-Peter at the end as a boss battle, that would be epic
Graphics totally downgraded
This brings me so much Joy lol 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
This looks incredible 😮
Kraven looks scary
Symbiote suit really bringing the Sasuke out of him 😂
watch, in about 10 to 20 yrs from now someone is gonna be like back in my day we played spider man 2 on ps5, (the ps7 just been made)
Love how Peter bursts in at 6:43 looking like the obvious villain; it works as a huge foreshadowing without exposition.
I love the fact they added features that modders put into the older games into this one
Finally a reason to get a ps5
Dang this looks great really hyped loved the dynamic between Peter and miles Peter being ragefull cause of suit excited
The intro cinematic was so cringe but game looks good
MILES JUST USED A KAMEHAMEHA!!!!
playstation exclusive, smh.
Peter sounding more like Sasuke with the symbiote suit lol
TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!!
I wonder how suit selections will work for Peter. It would be cool if the symbiote suit design changes depending on which suit is worn underneath.  If Insomniac Suit + Symbiote = Symbiote Insomniac Suit, then surely wearing any other suit with the symbiote would give us the symbiote version of that suit ( e.g: Mk 3 Armor Suit + Symbiote = Symbiote Mk 3 Armor Suit ).
Other insomniac spiderman was insane but that + the venom suit is gonna go crazy
cry this trash was so mid - my based opinion take it or leave it
So they basically gave miles static shock powers
this is insane I love it ♥
Bold move killing Ganke in the first trailer RIP   F's in the replies, gents 🙏🏾
Shut up and take my money 😂 let’s see wolverine next!
"are you sure he has big teeth" peter: "so do I" hmmm sounds like venom, and if you remember in the spider man movie he had this suit the old movie i wonder whats going to happen
How is it that the Spider-Man games are leaps and bounds better than the comics?
11:11 i love the voice crack bro
“He’s got big teeth!”  “So do I….”  ABSOLUTE CHILLS BABY I LOVE VENOM
They really approved on the combat alot in this, to bad alot of people can't play it due to how rare and expensive PS5s are
Spider-man 2, We Stock Share = 23.5 Pounds, USD = 30.9 EGP
Oh my goodness!!!!!!!!! insomniac showing tf out!!!!! They need to do the next Spiderman movie!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Yuri voice is on point!!!
Shocker you can’t escape me I’ll CHASE YOu To the ends of the EARTH😂
Holy cow this looks fantastic. Wish I could upgrade from my day 1 PS4!
That rage, wao. M so hyped for venom <3
Why tf people acting like this is some game changing gameplay 😂😂 shits just timed one button presses here and there and dodging that it’s 😂. Kinda cringe trying to make Peter talk like that to when he has the black suit. Dialogue looks trash as hell still
YOU CANT ESCAPE ME ILL CHASE YOU TO THE END OF THE EARTH!!
miles: shoryuken!
I thought nothing can top the 1st one cause that was 10/10 perfect and just by watching 12 minutes of this I can already tell that this one is gonna put the 1st Spider-Man game to bed 👌🏻!   The fact that we get to play bully maquire in a spider man game I never thought I would see the day😩.
This is exactly what I wantedt the game would be, always great stuff coming from insomniac
MILES IS HIM!!!!
Good action, good visuals, good combat not a bunch of woke crap shoved down our throats...looks promising.
Well... guess I'm gonna have to get a PS5 now 😂
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Sony's Spiderman*
I only hope the wing suits aren’t TOO glidey. It almost looks like straight up flying
Might as well call it Spider God at this point
He's gonna put some dirt they're eyes
11:50 Dude even in the last seconds of the video look at Peter’s eyes they look normal until he says “So do I” u can see the venom eyes start to pop out
This is something else.
All I hear is Sasuke when he talks like that😂
Vemon
Yuri lowenthal channeling his Sasuke for black suit spiderman
no hay palabra para describir lo q siento por esto
Miles: you sure? He's got big teeth  Peter: Gonna cry?
I wouldn’t believe this game play trailer to be true if it was not Insomniac. They were doing so good with the first game.
I love how they started to call Peter a “beast” 2:22
It’s safe to say that Yuri sounds more like Sasuke than he does as bully Maguire.
That ain't lizard, it's a frickin Godzilla
Game of the year for sure
Prototype 3
Looks amazing
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS GAME BRO
You know what in every spider man game so far in this series there’s always been a “New suit scene” like we saw Miles create a new suit and then for Peter it was when he added the white spider so i think for this game the “new suit scene” will be him gaining this new symbiote
Me corro
I know I won't be able to play these games for another 3 years, I guess, but I swear I am going to buy a PS5 with my savings to play God of War 4, Ragnarok, and Insomniac's Spider-Man trilogy
YOOOOOO bully maguire's back, he better do the dance in game brooooo
Bruh, the new Lizard design is amazing!
I'm saying goodbye to sunlight now, 😆  Peter and  Miles are playable and the infamous symbiote!
to say i am excited would be an understatement
Looks amazing !!! Cant wait to play this !!! Did anyone else notice the cameo from Oliver "Arrow" Queen at 7:33 :D
This was definitely worth the wait
Only on ps5 😭😭
It’s giving ps2 graphics
But. Can I keep the symbiote? It's gonna be lame if Peter throws Venom away no matter what.
For the first time in my life I'm tempted to get a PS5
bingus
I like the subtlety of 11:31 when he doesn’t help the civilian land.
Just take my money
this looks absolutely amazing. I can't wait to play it
BEST SPIDER-MAN EVER. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This game play is on another level 😳😳😳😳
symbiote gave too much of a web of shadows vibe
Is awesome the gameplay ❤❤
I think like in movie when symbiote attached to spiderman he starts to behave rudely with everyone that what the seen in game spiderman is going to lose its control over symbiote and miles is gonna rescue Peter from symbiote that what I think the last boss fight will happen between Peter and miles and when miles defeat Peter the symbiote leave Peter body and transform into venom from that part real fight between symbiote and spiderman will start
I need More of this
*standing ovation*
he got big teeth  peter : so do i !!!!!!!!  man o man u can bite me man :v
See you guys after 10 years
Bros really embracing the Sasuke edge there
*Sad pc gamer noises*
Goty❤
We've been teased that Harry will be the one who becomes Venom in this game... How crazy would it be if PETER becomes Venom and Miles has to fight him eventually. Peter encounters Harry in the lab and tries to save him, and the symbiote immediately bonds to him and then throughout the game it slowly starts transforming him... that'd be a CRAZY twist
See you all in 2035 when we are all reminiscing about this one 🎉🎉🎉🎉
What happened to my man Pete? im excited to find out when the game comes out
Wait it comes out this year??? I thought it will come in 2024?  Nvm I just checked the reveal trailer… it also said 2023
No water Physx⁉️
Spider-man Web of Shadow 2 ?
Prototype 2 feeling from venom
yeah PETER IS TERRIFYING WHEN HE'S PISSED
Here’s the thing: The devs didn’t need to give us already the beads for the story, or who is going to be in it… But they did… They needn’t improve that much on almost perfection from the previous games… But they did… They didn’t hat to make us glimpse at this year’s heavy weight GOTY contender… But they did… And that makes me very happy ❤!
o dear goodnesssssssss
Please tell me if it’s 60 or 70 dollars. Really want to put the money aside
Can't Wait For The Game!!!
Cool
Symbiote spiderman final boss
Legendary
i hope they release for PC too
Is this Prototype 3
I honestly hate this, here I was trying to tame my patience before the game's launch but this vid makes me want it NOWWW!!
So Parker is slowly turning into Venom that is so cool.
You mofo did your job, this reeks a 10 outta 10 I legit had tears
This. Is. Crazy. Symbiote Spidey is savage, and Lowenthals voice acting is great as always. I'm pretty sure we will have to fight Peter at one point as Miles, to save Peter from the symbiote. By the way, this is game of the year, right here!
Dude this looks so sick. When miles has to inevitably fight Peter it’s gonna be so dope
Who the hell is Ganke? I want to play as Spider-Man Not Miles Whatever.
I like how u can hear that Peter is losing himself in that suit.
nah jit trippin i still don't get to play a new spidrman game im a xbox user
Sasukes VA for peter  W
Oh we definitely are getting MILES vs PETER showdown
if anybody misses the prototype game, this will definitely please that itch and then some.
Let's goooooo
now that's an introduction!
Yooooo
amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Might gotta get a PS5 cause this might be one of the greatest games oat
I feel like that particular venom skin looks sorta plastic. Idk 🤷🏽‍♂️ other than that game looks amazing
Water physics is not look satisfying
I have legitimately never been so excited for a video game and I am 19 year old
PlayStation exclusive again. :(
Miles single handedly makes sure that they can track Connors and Peter doesn't praise him at all, Ps4/MM Peter would have told him good job and probably would have said something along the lines of "you're a better Spider-man than I am"  The Symbiote is already changing him.
This reveal was so awesome, it felt like Venom was coming inside of me
Every second comment is basically identical. "Peters so dismissive of miles" yeah we get ir stfu
Everything looks incredible! The symbiote suit is so cool. Lizard and kraven look amazing. I am loving the interaction between the characters! I love seeing lizards carnage as we followed him, really scary stuff. Truly this game will be spectacular!
So glad it's not a only get both Spider-Men characters for Multiplayer, it reminds me a bit of AC Syndicate where some missions you can do either character some are mission specific and as we saw in this trailer sometimes you switch between the two. This is gonna be great, unfortunately though it's probably gonna have the new Model for Peter which I hate.
Symbiote skin should look more like the comics in my opinion. Shaded with like a hint of blue and not moving at all. just a flat black with no moving stuff on it. and couldn’t tell but he should have white squares on his hands
HOLYSHITHOLYSHITHOLYSHIT!!!!! This made a shitty day at highschool so much better! I can't wait for this game!
So, Peter knows about Harry, and he’s getting desperate to save his best friend. Trying to the right the wrongs of his mistakes in the first game when he lost May. And he’s given into the symbiote because he believes it can help him save his best friend, even though he doesn’t know it’s blinding him.
That will pull to the right then to the left is a dream come true. Thank you so much to everyone involved in the making of this game. I can't wait to read the credits ❤💙🖤🖤❤🖤
i thought he would be mean to miles it would be a better game
This really looks like an old game like the HUD and everthing and am all for it
BETTER BE COOKING UP A LIZARD ACTION FIGURE
The suits look to wet:shiny
But if venom was keeping Harry alive and now Peter has the symbiote again and is being corrupted by it ...... oofff
Venom vs 2 Spider-Man ❤❤❤
I'll be the one who'll play this game after 10 years
awsme
Spider-Man on demon time🔥🔥 game looks incredible
Black Cat, Prowler, Wraith, Tombstone, The Sinister Six from the first game, the Spider-men, Taskmaster, and one final target.
5:00 did he just gave em a Kamehameha?? 😳🔥
Can't wait to see Andrew "stop pulling his punches."
Theres the double web slingshot, the underarm webbing glider, aggressive and gorgeous looking black suit spiderman, meaty combo finishers and grab attacks, double stealth take downs on webbing perches you make. This is going to be the best Spider-Man, nay, the best superhero game, of all time
YES!
Miles voice is so annoying. Sounds like hes 11 years old lol. So whiny
Yes can't wait to experience this game😭🔥🔥
Why do i feel like there will be a Lizard Symbiote hybrid Boss Fight in this game??
will miles fight peter ?
they really used their sweet time, and it paid off.
Why do i feel like this game is hyping  for the new kraven movie.
Ooooh man im getting Web of Shadows vibes from all those Black Suit combos. Pleeaasse tell me we can switch suit mid fight and combo Red suit Attacks with Black Suit Attacks!
I warned you about going after connors. Now this is on you....
Ну и гавно конечно(
Does anyone else hear sasuke when Peter talks
PLEASE LET US KEEP THE SYMBIOTE AT LEAST JUST ONCE!!!
The way Peter just throws the civilian after saving him at 11:33
I love the fact that they can't simply state a release date.... :(
Wooowowowowow now I have to wait 2-3yrs after release for the PC port. But why we have to play with ugly miles :/
It's interesting how Peter is beginning to sound like Kraven by the end. "Hes mine" as if this is no longer a friend hes trying to save but a beastly prize to be won. Spiderman has joined the hunt. Honestly super hyped for this game now.
OH MY GOD 😳🔥🔥🔥 THIS GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS THANKYOU SONY AND INSOMNIAC 🔥🔥👍🏻
Nah Ts Looks Insane I Can’t Wait To Get My Hands On This
Why spoil so much of the story and game ???
Tell me why someone leaked the information out and people thought it was fake kraven spiderman in a black suit so many games coming out we eating good
dude the black suit is animated so goddamn well, im blown away how good it looks
I can't wait to play it on PC...
Heyo Boozer! I see he got his hand back.
Looks awesome!
Launch it for pc soon after release please
3:01  11:50  I just love these lines.
Im replaying both spider man games rn before Spider-Man 2 🔥
Ain’t gonna lie. During the showcase, I thought the opening was gonna be for Wolverine 😅
You can tell that this game will go hard on Peter. Harry dying and can be cure just by something related to Connors, Connors himself being the lizard and go rampage, Kraven going after Connors and if he kills him Harry would die too, also Kraven looks to know that Peter is Spiderman... Probably the game will start a bit slow and suddenly going more and more hard with Peter's life. Combine all that with the simbyote changing the already anxious Peter more agressive and a probably Venom final boss... The gameplay seems will be even more fun than the first game. This gonna be awesome.
Abhi toh mene Purani Waali Spider Man Ni Kheli Tum Nayi Utha Ke Le Aye 😭
Hope it comes out in PC too😭
Fine, I'll buy a PS5
BRO…. Why did I choose XBOX!? 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
We’re venom on second thought 💭 boom 🤯
lol looks exactly like how we faught in the prototype games.
The fact that this is Sasukes dub voice actor that's all I can here
It’s a shame that I’m NEVER Gonna be able to play this game…….😔😞
Este juego luce increíble
The suit is si ugly man
Xbox players rn: 😭
That venom suit looks pretty bad tbh I see that they weren’t trying to have just a basic solid black suit and add some texture but I don’t think it works here, hopefully they’ll have some other venom suits in the game
Spider-Man 2: 2 Spider-Mans
This bouta go crazyyyy
Game Of The Year will be hard to decide if they release this the same year as Wolverine
Oh this is definitely ending with Peter vs Miles Peter suit says it all
Yea this is isane
They kept this til the end to make everyone think we wont get it lol
bro this new spiderman isnt now your friendly neighborhood spiderman god he’s aggressive towards to his enemies
Insimniac once again doesn't dissapoint.
Calling it now! Peter is gonna become Venom and Miles will have to fight him!
Can’t wait to buy this game
i mean.. is alright...
Pc release 😂😢
Looking like another GOTY, game looks great!
Bro. Wtf. Imnsoniac has used Bradley Cooper or what?: 01:24 AWESOME!
I bet miles is going to fight Peter just to defend lizard from him
This game looks as phenomenal as I thought it would especially for an incomplete product  I've missed spiderman games can't wait for this one it's cool to see how much more experienced miles is now and the dark suit make an appearance
Peter looks like a menace with that symbiote suit i know miles and peter boutta throw down
that opening with peter coming out with the black suit on was killer man! and the graphics looks insane. this whole game be looking like a movie!
0:58 Thanos Loki vibes 💔
11:46 such brilliant voice work from Peter Parkers' VO actor. ... And what a badass touch with the black teeth showing from the previously rounded eyes 🤌🏾
11:32  Saves the guy then throws him to the ground.. LMAO
Is this the PS4 Pro version? Doesn't look like a PS5 game at all 😂
Im ngl these on rail parts are fun and a great spectacle. I hope they add more of these. Dont get me wrong the combat is fun but i dont mind high octane chase scenes in my spiderman game. Looks like the angst and aggression brings out that Sasuke in Yuri lol   Interested in seeing more.
Anyone else so busy admiring the Symbiote suit that you lose track of the dialogue?
year of the spider. across the spider verse and marvel spider man?.  this so cool
This game makes you really feel like Spiderman.
my mans starting to sound like Sasuke
11:30 we can see pete throw the civilian and act nothing. Venom taking control of pete is looking awesome 👀 . Welcome to face off 🔥
shi crazy
Leaving my comment for the future generations
Non playstation users be like, we'll wait and what we can do with mods is so sad
masterpiece <3 hands down
I didn't really wanna play as miles but i first they need someone to contrast against symbiote Peter
I hope we get to fight Peter as Miles! 😈
Eep I’m hyped already
Bring it to ps4. Then we're talking
Can’t wait to play it in 2027 when it comes out on PC!
IM SO FREAKING HYPED!!!!
Peter sounding a little too much like Sasuke rn
This is like a movie
Disappointed there wasn’t any Mary Jane gameplay, when you think Spider-Man game you usually think of playing as Mary Jane :/
Can't wait to come back to this reveal after I finish the gane.
I can’t believe there are people complaining about graphics and animation. THIS IS AMAZING
Perhaps Peter and miles will fight?😮😮
Spider Man Games are INSANE
Spider-Man fans eating good this year
Kravinnnn
I so want to play this game the wait is killing me
So ready for this game🔥
This shouldn’t be surprising as he gave an incredible performance in the last games as well, but Yuri Lowenthal is killing it as Peter. I love how you can tell just by the voice that something is off with Peter.
Can’t wait
On 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The game of the year
Anyone caught sasuke slipping through the cracks of Yuri there?😂😂yup thats definitely not Peter, he an uchiha now
how is this a video game? can someone explain? so nobody saw something fall from a warehouse? why is only one npc shooting at a time? or attacking at one time? violence is chaos. this is just pressing buttons and seeing pretty pictures. it is so bizarre to me how this is considered a video game. where is the "danger"? The immersion. This is beyond boring.
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
I love how sasuke's voice is so evil in this one
Spider-man fans stay winning in every medium except comics rn
Can't wait hopefully they changed the vaulting crap
yo this spidey trailer looks SICK
GAME OF THE YEARRR
Woah you can see just how much Peter is deteriorating with the symbiote on him. He isn’t really himself anymore. This is gonna make for some great interactions and storytelling. And this gameplay looks awesome. I can’t wait.
Spidey gettin BUSY!!😮
finally, bully Maguire is back in town
THIS IS SOOO HYPEEEEEEEEE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥
When they bring out the black suit, you know that S#@$ is about go down
Why do I feel Pete's gonna be the final boss and we gotta off him🗿
Any other Destiny fan hear the darkness ships sound effect when Peter swings away at the very end after saying he has big teeth too?
I love how Peter’s eyes change to look more like Venom’s when he says that he has big teeth, too. 11:53
Can anyone explain me what is diff between this and Spiderman milesmorales graphics ?? 😅😂
I actually can’t wait till this game comes out
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘😘🥰🥰😍😍😍🥰😘😘😘😘
Im so glad they didn't turn spiderman into to gadget man, I was so concerned about that. Looks like gadgets will be taking more of a back seat and thats a good thing, we really need to see new swiging animations maybe they aren't ready to show them yet.
Spider-Man 2 looks phenomenal, it’s just proves that Insomniac know what they’re doing with superhero games and its characters and environment   The Lizard and Kraven both look amazing and menacing   I also love the look and feel of the Symbiote Suit. The aggressiveness of it, like the little things as well, Peter’s voice and attitude change, how instead of helping citizens down he just throws them down. He throws responsibility out the window.
I'm just gonna say this is some comic acurate Spider-Man and Miles Morales!
Take my money 🤧💰I need to get my hands on this !
Gawd dayum the graphic gorgeous af, can’t wait to play this  ps5 💯😍🔥
Cant wait for this i loved it when the first marvels spiderman came out and with Miles and peter with freaking venom powers and how he can control this is going to be lit
I swear to god I better see every detail and most importantly every single PUDDLE in the full game.
DP might be a potential side character, Kraven radar showed him as a character.
I wish stan lee were here to see this😭
Peter has Batman voice in this game
dang they making spiderman 2 already
Yeah i loved web of shadows too
See Ya Chump🗿
10/10 you gotta fight Peter as Miles as a near final boss because of Venom.
Bro, Lizard got the killer croc batman arkham Knight treatment
I will be preordering this as soon as I can 🔥🔥🔥
I've been waiting for another game where they'd use the symbiote again, adds a whole layer to the story and gameplay
Peter's going to be the main villain, I can see it already
Love that Miles added some new moves with his powers in his arsenal
Game of the year right here
I played this and its really nice and satisfying.
Soo.. no one is gonna mention miles web wing gliding? I've been. Waiting for that feature
Bruh spider man is Turing into bully Maguire..
Awesome
3:49 nah that’s tuff.
Peter letting his inner Sasuke Rage out 💀
Mais um jogo que vai durar uns 2 anos e vai sumir, se colocassem um Co-op tenho certeza que eles iriam lucrar muito mais e a longevidade do jogo iria triplicar....
Я уже вижу как она будет стоить 10к через турцию
Beyond excited
Welp, hope i get a PS5 in the future.
Can’t wait!!!!
Maybe there's an actual fight between Peter and Miles !?
So cool that you can be in the suburbs in this one.
❤
When someone wants to nostalgia this game I will be gone so happy that I could see this in the show case
The Lizard looks terrifying, as he should.
Same map? This is a dlc!!!
THERE'S NO WAY THEY ADDED THE WEB SLINGSHOT ÄñÐ THE WINGSUIT
I cannot wait for this f*kn game.
J
Lots of QuickTime events looks boring and sanitised not a difficult game yawn zz
sling shot and glide dang they are listening to their fans
The simplied abilities from this new spider man game are way cooler than the ones from Spider-Man Web Shadows.
That VA has that symbiote voice down
This is the power of ps5?
The wait for this moment was ABSOLUTELY worth it! Thank you Insomniac, can’t wait to play it!
I can feel the Prototype vibe in this one
SHOOOOOCKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
note to self: start saving for a PS5 ASAP along with Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet & Clank....
Man imagine Insomniac take on Wolverine next!!! I can’t wait!!!!
Thank god they remembered wraith
Ya'know. I'm sure he would take whatever gives him the advantage in a hunt, but Kraven the Hunter never struck me as a thousands of henchmen rushing through a city and Iron Man level high tech gadgets type villain.
So. At the end. Why doesn’t miles just swing up, especially when on the bridge 💀
This those not Look like the Spider man game
If this game doesn't have bully Parker dancing in the streets, I am not playing it.
Is it me or the graphic are not as good as the first one? Or is it not the final version? Looks a bit bad. 1st one is my all time fav game.
This looks so good! They can make a movie out of it and I mean that as a compliment. I love how the music changes when it switched to Miles. Venom Spidey sounds angry! We’ll have to fight him as Miles at some point in the game for sure!
I like how they gave Peter a Web of Shadows kinda gameplay where he's going to have a moveset for his original and symbiote suit
this is gonna be the sequel to end all sequels
Can only imagine what typa unlockable suits they gone have 🔥
That water doesn't look good at all, looks unfinished. But this gameplay is great overall, another masterpiece.
Alright, the man behind the mask is officially Sasuke Uchiha now 🤣
Im just waiting for the real Spiderman when Blade and Morbius come thru, Blade helps Spiderman find out vampires are in the city they work together after they throw hands, team up whoop assets Morbius shows up slaps Blade up a little then bites Spiderman, they escape barely the vamps regroup in the shadows, meanwhile Peter Parker gets beside himself the next night he runs off in a frantic mind state confused and scared. He climbs the highest building when there it happens Spiderman turns into a Vampire Spider, man!... I'll let you guys pull up the old Spiderman shows back in the 90's this is the timeline and universe they are trying to get back to with phase 4 and 5 but im just waiting for new Blade so I can see the new Character look to the Vampire Spiderman one of the best of Spiderman traits and true nature, the venom version has nothing on this one..   Spoiler Alert: Predator vs Batman another like it's kind be ready for that to hit the screens or animation, that one is going to be more on the brightburn side of the spectrum can't wait for either.. Instant classics if done right with care and adaptation to it's core..
Edgey spidey is best spidey.
Was worried about that First guy beinf a new take on Kraven happy the real one stood up
I like how they put the vibe of spiderman web of shadows game in the venom 🔥🔥
Chugga chugga choo choo baby here comes the hype train!
Now this looks amazing 👏
I don't know what this game is Spider-Man 2 "OR" Spider-Man Web Of Shadows?!... which one is it???... 😏😎
Finally, Prototype 3
I have a feeling miles and peter will fight somewhere in the middle of the game, forcing peter out of the symbiote suit and then reuniting for the finale
In 10 years this would be a remake in PS6
all i can hear is sasuke 😭
All those games that came close... Ehhhh This probably gonna get Game of the Year!!!
I’m probably in the minority but I feel like because Mike’s suit is black as well it kinda diminishes the effect of the symbiote being pure black
He better dance
Coming from Batman Arkham fans, this gonna be dethroned Batman Arkham series 🤯
This is Ultimate Spiderman, Web of shadows, Spiderman 3 and miles morales combined
I will get every insomniac super hero game Ong
I can’t even believe that’s just 10 mins of the game. What a masterpiece. Can wait to play it!
Gameplay wise no big difference imo....
That Bully Maguire in him  Is slowly coming out
I FEEL BAD FOR XBOX GAMERS MAN (I’m a Xbox gamer that’s switching to PlayStation)
Haven’t been this excited for a game since the first one or RDR 2
I almost forgot that this was just a trailer
11:24 I love how Peter contemplates whether he should go after The Lizard or save the civilians. Peter without the symbiote wouldn’t have even thought twice. It’s details like this that make me so excited for this game!
This game looks so freaking good. Just release now! 😂😢
Cannot wait
I can’t wait to play as Sasuke using his Sasuke voice.
Hope this game cures depression
Pero si se ve que en las peleas Peter con el simbionte es más agresivo, deja de medir sus golpes y si los deja heridos de gravedad, a diferencia de su estado normal, mínimo los noquea y unos pocos moretones
In the sense of graphics it is masterpiece
I could be reading into things, but I feel like the very last bit with the slogan "be greater, together" has some symbolism behind it. Initially, it starts out with the symbiote spreading around, but then miles' blue venom power eradicates it. I feel like this might be foreshadowing to some sort of fight that'll happen between miles and peak symbiote Peter
I never preorder games... But this.
12:05 HOW IS HE SWINGING THAT AAAAAAAAAAAAA
Sasuke not using any ninja arts    and only the spidey suit
Expecting one more "Congratulations Sony & Spider-man Team" for the release of Spider-Man 2 game from Phil Spencer😀😀😀
Got a feeling there's going to be a Peter vs Miles fight before they team up and fight Kraven and Venom
Ben 10 add a new symbiote to his collection 🔥🔥
I will say, I don't know if they will keep this up- But the way Peter looks and acts with this black suit is probably the only version of him with the symbiote I've seen, where he has the potential to be actually terrifying.  Every scene he's in, he's shot less like a hero, and more like a monster that's slowly growing more dangerous. He's so intimidating I almost didn't have time to process all the amazing new additions, like the expanded map and entire new mechanics.
Honestly, the sound design isn't talked about enough.  Just the sheer force behind those take downs is so satisfying to hear, almost like Spidey's giving them the Batman treatment.  Breaking every possible bone in their body
I’m so excited for this game
Be GREATER. Be YOURSELF. Be GREATER. TOGETHER. 🔥🔥🔥
This is going to be wild if we have to fight venom suit Pete
Great, now i gotta get a ps5.
Miles new blue electricity reminds me of infamous gameplay
Bully maguire has returned
How is this game looking so good?!? Sony's been hitting it out of the park with Spiderman lately
не узнаю эту игру
I hope there’s a mini game or cutscene where we see Peter Parker dancing to James Brown in the streets of New York
Yoh❤
the only problem i have is with symbiote suit , i mean it should effect on peter phyical apperance like in animated version
The best Venom !!
Get back here Shocker!
8:41 What a throwback!! Spider-Man 2 on PS2 used to have missions where you have to save people and one of them was saving civilians from a sinking boat. I got so excited when I saw that, hope they actually implement that into the game. Full on nostalgia.
Hwo
I'll never understand how the villains get the money to buy all of that armament.
I AM HEATED! I love this so much, Peter with venom is JUST what I NEEDED
lets hope there are different Venom suit designs as well
Effects of venom on Peter are awesome
This comment will be seen countless number of times over the years
This looks insane
Insomniac made the wait oh so worth it. I knew already this game was gonna be great, now I know for sure it will be greater. Lizard looks monstrous and awesome, Kraven is acting like the badass he is, Miles is experienced now and putting his all into being a hero, and Peter, oh boy Peter, is slowly loosing himself to the venom symbiote. I cannot wait for this game to come! I know it’ll just be incredible!
Nice really tacky
Miles with the Kamehameha 😂
Do I wait for a pc port or just buy a PS5.
No one is really talking much about this but I am super excited that we get a bigger map
I WAS HERE 5/24/23
I freaking love the venom suit
Am I the only one that’s glad we get to explore Queens too?
OmG my Boi lizard man in it got to play this game
Like the 616 lizard Vibe......hes big
Kraven......finally
Meh. Another one. More fortnite chatter while doing boring combat. Pass.
No better changes. Stupid NPC, same environment
HOLY SHI YES
i played enough batman series im do e with these kinda games. im ready for elden ring update
More miles booo
I'm hyped
Guys this looks incredible.   I’m a life long Spider-Man fan and this made me feel like I was a kid who just fell in love with the character for the first time. Bravo.
Dammit, r U sure its a game, I thought its a movie.
to everyone, pls keep pushing in life and never give up. can't wait to see you successful one day and May God Bless You! 🥰🙏🏻🙏🏻
I'm really hyped for this. Water mechanics looks mediocre tho..they will do it better I guess.
I'm just effing speechless 😮
"gameplay"
wake up it’s not 2023
No words.... except i love it and i want it :)
This game gave me TASM movies vibe
wake up it’s not 2023
3:10 Iconic Web Of Shadows Moveset
I'm really hyped for this. Water mechanics looks mediocre tho..they will do it better I guess.
😮😊😁 me like spider man 2
I’m scared of seeing only the other vilains in dlc
Was always wondering why Kraven was obsessed Spider man when New York has so much more interesting stuff. Glad to see him hunting Lizard
Does this seem like a fever dream to anyone else? Lol
They brought back kravens boy band from shattered dimensions
Make multiplayer so you can play miles and spider man with friends
Bro ain’t never just Thanos dude like that with the neck snap lol
aw man. now r/spidermanps4 is sane once more. see you later batman arkham.
Honestly I have no words to describe how excited I am for this games launch day
That's bully maguire at 11:33...🤣
I’m HYPED
3:03 Absolutely love the menacing delivery of "he's gonna wish he never came to New York" Yuri Lowenthal is doing amazing work as always. It really shows how aggressive he's becoming, I love it.
Peter got that "SHOCKERRRR...."
I dont even have a ps5 but i would love to be able to play this game man
Looks I need to put PTO in for the rest of this year. 😮
Jhon Paesano it's coming!
This has HEAVY Web of Shadows vibes. Wow. I’m in. 🔥
Hopefully, r/SpidermanPS4 is fine now.
Insomniac is a fan of sonic unleashed
Taking into account the Symbiote already showing signs of corrupting Peter, The Lizard being downright monstrous, and the inclusion of Yuri Watanabe in her Wraith persona, I just know this game is gonna be darker and edgier than the first one.
You should have your video game writers and directors take over your movies... this clip was 10x better than any movie or tv show you put out since endgame... this is what fans want - not she hulk or ms marvel
I bet theres gonna be a part where miles gotta fight pete to take off the symbiyote plus the hud looks like stuff from the old spider-man games
Possibly a Miles vs Peter fight ?
tight tight tight
Bro this game looks amazing
I haven't been this hyped since No Way Home. Insomniac looks like they really gonna deliver
I think there was no improvement to enemy AI in the past 2 decades.  How do they not hear the screams of someone getting pulled up & knocked out by smashing into their friend 10 meters away in peripheral vision? :x  Surely there is better algorythms available that don't destroy immersion whenever you're trying to sneak?
this reminds me the good old times in Web Of Shadows
That aggressive and deep voice of pete...... just love it
Gameplay looks great, graphics horrible.
The cutscenes are so good i forgot this was a video game and not a movie
Wow! This did not disappoint at all. It was worth the wait! Omg! 😮🤤🤤👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🔥🔥🔥
I honestly can't wait for this game
5:03 Bro wanted pay back from that into the spider verse ground pound
So many questions
I love the details and effort insomniac put on this amazing,spectacular,friendly videogame
🔥
What a gameplay 👌👌👌 Thank you INSOMNIAC 🙏
4/10 whoever made this shouldve reconsidered some type of gore knowing that venom was gonna be in it
Bro this looks SOOOO F COOOOOOOL CANT WAIT UNTILL IT COMES OUT
I like how they made stealth with Miles more fun to play.
That darn suit is messing with his head again changing him
Didn't they already come out with 🕸 spider-man 2 already.... with all The different type  suits?
love everything, the voice acting is top notch, yuri lowenthal is kicking it outta tha park with the voice tone  of black spidey..... but the black suit ...doesnt look good, reminds me of sam raimies 3rd film which was horrible
Почему мы в 2007, выходит игра где есть веном ящер и крейвен. Spider man 3 the video game part 2?
Suddenly i miss web of shadows
One thing I will say is the ui was better in the last game, and I liked miles with yellow venom
cant get any better best time to be a spidey fan🖤
*Game of the year guaranteed.*
That Kraven intro gave me goosebumps, can’t wait to experience the story myself 🤩
Most important question can you play the game only Peter or only Myles?
Symbiote Pete gives off mad Sasuke energy
Peak gaming has returned, looks like this game is really taking it to the next level! I love Pete's symbiote powers and Miles' new powers and everything else. Definitely getting a ps5 for this!
Bravo can't wait to play
All I have to say is, debit or credit?
bully peter incoming
Spider
I only had one issue with this: the swinging didn't feel right. Almost as if they took a step backwards towards the first games simplistic swinging, rather than miles's smooth transitions and animations. Hopefully this is not the case.
Man i did not expect this, but they are good at making you feel like more and more of a baddass each game, dunno how to beat this tho
I like the bomb and then the drone to make it look like green goblin, hype Is unreal
this looks so AMAZING
Truly a different game from the ones before. Who knows wht they ll make in the future❤
THIS WILL BE THE BEST SUPERHERO GAME EVER.
So venom suit is hurting Peter and Dr. Connor only hope
Love it.but the ui kinda seems like a downgrade.
I’ve already watched this trailer about 50 times.
That sasuke really coming out in this trailer lmao
ALLEYYYYY OOOOPPPP
Why do all the enemies just stand their looking at you doing nothing while you beat up their allies? Breaks any immersion and looks terribly scripted. Animations look amazing though,
The game definitely will be fun, but it's just disappointing that we have to get the most mid-tier villain
I like how Miles is kinda scared of Peter when he comes through underground this game is gonna be good just gotta wait till I can play it on PC sadly
game of the year?
This is amazing better than expected
I'm glad sasuke is back.
underwhelming
This can't come soon enough! This gave me the same excitement I got back in the day when the gameplay reveal of the first one came out
Bro … he’s going to fight taskmaster …. That’s wild
I dont know that u guys noticed or not but in that tablet after lizard task master was their ooh my freaking goddddddddddddddd  imagine task master vs kraven sheeeeeeeeeeeshh
Hype
why is this called Spider-Man 2? Isnt it technically the 3rd one after the miles morales game.
I absolutely love it!! Omg the suit looks amazing the way it came together like web of shadows!! This is peak gameplay right here
Did peter just yeet that civilian? So much details with the symbiote suits
Bro learn to beat down like batman 🥶
Wow 😍between this and Wolverine I might have to buy a ps5
Everything that’s been revealed about this game is another reason for the Green Goblin to appear
This looks like the best superhero game/ Spider-Man game ever made!!!!
It’s a spider man game n they’ve literally made it so you can just fly through the city, also didn’t need miles in this game
Ok, would love to play but unfortunately I will play this maybe in 2025 or whenever they release it for P.C.
I like how they designed the lizard, man is a full on beast 😂
I'll bet this game makes you FEEL like spider man
Waiting to play ❤
Aweee man this looks good! Better be on Pc on release day
That was AWESOME.  So immersive, such great storytelling between the two characters in just this clip. Great interactive mechanics, cutscenes are cool, the Symbiote looks awesome.  I’m so excited for this game. Can’t wait
I hope this games long and I hope this is the second half
Miles Morales unlocked the chidori
The symbiote combat looks amazing 🤩
Brooo This looks so Amazing Gave me Goosebumps 🥺 Games nowadays are so much better than the movies
Gonna need to buy a ps5 just for this
if this go on pc, mine will explose for sure
You know it’s bad when Peter wouldn’t let Miles finish his joke 😂
That's it. I'm a dedicated PC only player (my hands can't recognize what a controller is and how to use/hold it) but this will make me buy a PS5
I really hope the swinging is as such as 2004 Spider-Man 2’s swinging ! looks great overall !
Best symbiote gameplay since ultimate spider-man in 2005.
I’m crying and I’m dying
I like how more aggressive the suit made Peter, but he still kind of quips despite that. Like calling the flying vehicle a metal murder bird, really excited to watch videos of this game when it comes out
THAT SYMBIOTIC SUIT GOES CRAZZZY! AND THAT NEW SPIDER BOOST, GADGETS  AND MANEUVERABILITY WOW 👌 THIS IS WHAT THE LAST GAME SHOULD HAVE HAD! USE THAT UNREAL ENGINE TO THE MAXX!
11.30 Black spider Man just threw that guy on the ground like "You don't deserve to be saved"🤣🤣🤣
I was in my car in the driveway when I saw the notification. I kid you NOT I SCREAMED so loud ❤
The pyramids are coming
This is going to be a bold game
This ain’t Spider-Man
Is this a Spiderman game or a Miles Morales? I'm not a fan of derivative characters. But glad if you guys like it. Not for me though
They're telegraphing the fight between Peter and Miles from a mile away... Miles will have to defeat Peter in order to detach the symbiote from him and only then will it find Eddie.
Is the soundtrack starting around 3:45 new or is it from one of the previous games?? Sounds awesome 🔥
Sounds like Sasuke for a bit, haha
Somewhere in the story, im hoping that the symbiote is trying to take over, and peter fights it
Why did I just think that Scott Adkins would make a great Kraven after seeing this?
I think once Peter gets the symbiote off its gonna be transmitted to harry as the cure and he'll become anti venom wild theory but still so far this is who the villians are gonna be (Lizard or Doctor Conors, Kraven the Hunter, and Venom ( Eddie Brock) Antivenom (Harry Osborn) )
Destiny 2: The Final Shape and Spider-Man 2 in the same day i LOVE my life
I better be able to do the dance. You know the one.
The GOTY is here! They seem to have upgraded everything!!
Now that's a trailer
You already know Pete’s gonna be a boss
Jesus! This is a Video Game?!? I haven’t played video games in years & to say that the industry has stepped it up over time is an understatement!
Wow just like Tobey Maguire Black Venom Spidey. Can't wait to see this in the MCU.
This is what we call a good game ..😌
Welp, Tears of The Kingdom officially has competition for Game of The Year now. Can't wait to pre-order it!
Cool trailer
I wanna say i know its gonna happen but man i really hope by the end peter gets a idk perfected symbiote or something cause getting rid of the symbiote suit by the end of the game will be honestly sad. Although im sure after you can non canonically run around with the symbiote. But comon on some shattered demension stuff let my man control it. Plus not cool if only Miles gets the bonus powers am i right.
Miles is going to have to save Pete from himself in this one.
Moral compass probably is coming to play
SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD😍😍😍😍
Amazing game... shame ill never get to play it because i cant get a ps5 and probably will never get one
Awesome trailer!! The only thing i dont like, and thats in many games are the water physics and looks. I dont understand how we are in 2023 with crazy gaming engines out there, and the water still looks like 2010... Am I the only one who thinks that?
If this is like this can’t wait for Wolverine
Oh my god I love it
Its 2025 and youre here 😅
Disappointed by the graphics
Just ready for the Wolverine game……
Masterpiece indeed
THIS IS GONNA BE SICK!!!!
Letsss gooooooo
I'll enjoy playing this in 3 years when sony finally releases it on pc 🫠😭
PLEASE add this game to pc I want to play it SO BAD
Get back here, Shocker!
Woooooow
Ngl looks like the same game as the first one
"WATCH OUT FOR HIS NEW POWERS" lol
Bully maguire vibes the symbiote has made him way more angry
w gaming bro
bro isnt this the 4th spiderman game like this year???
Kraven gives me the Yuri boyka vibes 😊
this will be goty, i count on it. it’s so refreshing and amazing to see peter parker in rage with the symbiote on him, something so many people asked for too!
6:44 Getting Villain vibes from that Silhouette of Symbiote Spiderman 🕷
Bruh I thought the first dude was Kraven then I was like oh no that’s Kraven😭😭😭
is venom tallking to peter
Well dayum
Felt like a full on movie halfway through. This is amazing 👏👏👏👏
Omg i love everything what ive seen. Symbiote, new moves, fast switching between spiders, crazy action, Lizard looks really monstrous, larger map. You sold me that awesome game.
They added Queens!! And the Venom Spider-Man fight gameplay is INSANE!! On top of that, THIS HAS TO BE THE BEST PISSED OFF SPIDER-MAN VOICE EVER FREAKING CREATED!!! YURI IS KILLING IT!! HYPE IS OFF THE CHARTS RN MANNNNNNN
Looks awesome
Pineapple 🍍
I was really skeptical at first but seeing this trailer and how different they play this game is going to be a 10/10
I’m confused why are there 3 spider man’s???? One is Pete, the other Miles but who’s the 3rd one on mic?????
Imagine when wolverine comes….
Marvel will you please upload the HDR version and get this game back on Xbox? Gamers on all platforms should get to enjoy Spider-Man,  Wolverine, etc.
the graphics remind me of old games but in such a charming way, this game is gonna be A BLAST! ITS AMAZING!!!!!! and the suits look incredible
Was that Deadpool in the opening
The Peter Parker fights and symbiote mechanism is very similar to the prototype franchise...
yes ive watched this a million times
Kraven the Hunter gets the Symbiote to become Venom
I feel like for some reason they might make peter with the symbiote a boss fight
As much as I love spider man, I hope TOTK wins game of the year
never though i see a good venom suit in 3d like that
Uffff loving it ❤
This looks absolutely incredible.
incredible
This is fantastic
Reminds me of spider man web of shadows.
I am SO hype for this thing it's not even funny. Definitely anticipating a Peter vs Miles boss battle.
I LOVE IT.
The growl in peters voice
Playing with Peter finna be wild
I think we could all definitely see the personality change of Pete because of the symbiote suit. I'm excited for this game!
Switching between two playable characters like Grand Theft Auto V, I’m all for it.
Amazing. Spectacular. The Ultimate spider man game.
Amazing.
I almost forgot that this is a video game. The quality of the writing, dialogue, cinematography, and voice acting makes it feel like I'm watching a film. And the fact that it's playable makes me even more excited. I can't wait to immerse myself in the game when it's released.
I think à miles v symbiote spiderman fight would be really dope in this game
Lmao the writers really just watched Spider-Man 3 and was like “yeah that’s how he should be written”
looks like ps4 can run it, we have to wait
03:41 Peter Parker's Spider-man did that originally. Why is his side kick doing it in the game first. I know I'm in the minority here but this seems more like "Spider-MEN 1.5" rather than "Spider-man 2" . Its hard to get excited for this game for people that want to play as the real Spider-man and not a knock off. I hope we aren't forced to play as Miles for half of the game. At least give us a choice.
The ending of this game is going to be incredible i feel like its gonna end some what like the 2007 sm3 movie but x1000000000😂❤❤❤
I’m just now finishing the first game-
I love the difference between how aggressive his blows are, really shows how the symbiote affects him
WE BETTER SEE PETER DANCING
OMG!!! FKING AMAZING
Gamers hyped the first game so much, but it was eh i mean it got reptitive with the combat style and what you do in that game, hope this one worth it
9:55 look how the spiderman just tossed that civilian on the ground due to effect of symbiote.. man loving this kind of insane details in the game.. good job insomniac games...
"He got big teeth,so do I" cold asf😭
This is literally jus like Batman Arkham
5 years from now I want to see this comment get 1,000 likes :)
HOLYYYYYY OMLLLLL
Yo that first 2 minutes could literally be a post credits scene to introduce kraven into the MCU spiderman movies or the Sony ones!!
I’m not surprised if we see him slapping miles around with the symbiote when the full game comes out 😂
Cool, but where's the part where Spider-Man get's rifted to the Fortnite Island?
Game looks amazing. Combat is 10/10, symbiote suit looks fantastic. Incredible graphics. But the movement isss.. alot.  Instead of a gliding mechanism that could be used in unison with web swinging, you can just straight up fly?? Instead of pushing the speed limits and finding new ways to go faster than you could before, you spam square a few times and fly across half the map??   I know the trailer just came out and this is incredibly nitpicky but its almost ridiculous how fast they went with the smallest amount of effort 😭
Ура
it should be come to PC too, console war is dumb
that looks awsome, i cant wait to play this, any idea when it will come to pc?
This game is similar to batman Arkham love it
cant wait to watch the playthrough lmao
Can’t wait to play this 🔥💯❗️ Looks incredible!
Bro was Peter feeding on someone , that’s crazy
See y’all in 10 Years when someone wants to go back to this
.... Venom is main antagonist kraven and lizard are background villains
My god, Is this Game or Movie😮😮 9:47 btw that voice was like Tobey Maguire spoke🥹
Omg Omg Omg Omg  There is so much to unpack here is glorious! Cannot wait to get my hands on this!!!
Que epico.
YES!!! lizard was absolutely the villain I wanted most to show up in the game and he looks absolutely awesome! So huge and fast the build up is amazing! Kraven is looking to be Really cool too putting all the super powered folk in new york on the hunting list! Aaaagh this is gonna be awesome!
Graphic definitely looks unfinished, that aside I'm excited!
See you in 10 years when someone wants to relive memories of this game
Oooh... Carnage as a secret boss maybe?
Bully maguire: gona put some dirt in his eyes 🕷️
Bold prediction miles is whoopin Peter
yo when is this gonna be available for pre order Sony/Insomniac cause i’m getting that IMMEDIATELY
Broo that is awesome 💀💀, wish I had ps5 to play it 😢😢, ig I'm gonna have to wait for pc port
Hopefully they bring back Shocker for this one.
Will this be on PC at launch?
I’m so hype for this game
SHOCKER!!!!!! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME!!!!!! SHOCKER!!!!
Bro sounding more like sasuke 😂
I hope we finally get the innovation we always wanted since the original — puddles.
YESSSS
Marvel misunderstanding the properties of the symbiote yet again I see. Thanks, Raimi.
I’ll be checking back in 8 years
THIS IS SO FIRE 🔥
Oh i just know Pete's going to be a tough boss fight and I'm not ready for the feels
Game of the year calling it now
The entire trailer, I'm wondering what is going on with Peter Parker's voice until the end when it was made clear that the symbiote suite is doing a thing.   My advice, set that up in the beginning that way people won't wonder the same thing.
Thanks jerk. Now I have to buy a PlayStation.
I really hope that that this game actually gives a challenge this time. The original was WAY TOO easy on hard mode. Also no dumb linear stealth segments please 🙏
I really hope they will stick with the OG Peter Parker face.
Game of the YEAR!!! Calling it now 🔥
Spidey with batman's voice??? Can't wait to play this!!!!
This is crazy i think we will get a venom vs the lizard because see how peter eyes went to venomish like and he said he got big teeth too hes probably going to turn into venom and we get to play as him and fight the lizard but this is a possibility it will happen
I waiting for Pete to get out of a clothing store then do the "dance thingy"
finally get to FEEL like Bully Maguire
The details and hair on kraven the hunter body is super impressive. The developers took a very good time to follow the exact character resemblance and voice with deep personal connection in their relationship as well. I'm pre ordering gonna pre order this.
xbox exclusives: redfall,forza,halo infinite playstation exclusives:
Kravem hunting the Lizard while Black Suit Spider-Man tries to save him?? This brings back memories from my old Spider-Man 3 video game on ps3
Am i Trippin or angry spiderman sound just like Sasuke?
LOVE THIS!!! btw why does lizard look like godzilla
Terrific . Love it.
Toppen!
Prepare for the Hunt! 🔥 🕸   I can't wait for Symbiote Spidey to yell "SHOCKER!"
I really am hoping they have Rami’s symbiote suit!
Question is will Peter Parker dance at any point while dressed as an edgy emo?????
Web of shadows flashback
Yup! The aggression is there 4sho!!! This game will def have me and my 11yr old son battling over the ps5 lol can’t wait!!!
This gonna go CRAZY! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😫😫😫😫😫😫
Small note lol anyone else notice Miles do the Kamehameha? 😅
11:34 Miles was like Why did u just toss that guy to the ground peter?😂😂😂
When you realize the voice of Symbiote Spiderman is Sasuke Uchiha
When does it come out?
Is this real!?
I waiting for a legendary dance on the street
Bro went from “I’m your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman” to “Peace was never an option”
Am i wrong or is black suit spidey not supposed to have Venom powers? Hes just supposed to be stronger and more brutal.
One detail I like is that symbiote peter just threw that one person at 11:32 with little to no care because of how the symbiote affects him.
7:20 hahahahahha
The suits look better in the thesa trailer now it loooks like the sams as in the last part
ngl why am i getting fortnight vibes😭
Yesss
Different suits=different symbiote suit styles?
Bro sounds like he’s going to chase Kraven to the ends of the Earth
Man, this was amazing. Miles is a cool dude. Loving this take on Peter with the symbiote.
Incredible serious...and great potential as the mcu gets to soft. Hopefully this and secret wars will be some truly great  marvel stuff.
I Totally Love It!!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This is an exaggerated swagger check.  Your swagger, hand it over.
Wraith. So Yuri did become a villain.
11:33 Look at Miles’ face when Peter throws him. He’s like man what the hell lmao😂😂
This looks AMAZING…
Bro this game finna be heatttttt. Like bro the details that got into all of Peter's new interactions with the black suit are soooo well done and the gameplay fire but we already knew that was gonna happen
Gomaaleee andhaa polaaa irrukungaaa 🔥
If I’m not mistaken we haven’t had a Spider-Man symbiotic suit combat system since shattered dimensions and that combat was so amazing! I can’t wait to use the symbiote suit! I hope it’s a permanent suit with the abilities and not lost when venom comes to be with harry
This voice actor sounds very familiar
I bet we will have a boss fight with pete
This must be the greatest gameplay reveal of all time right?
This game will blow records! So excited!!
They really did the fortnite air tunnel 😭
Props to Ditko for visualizing this world 60 years ago.   Shane that Marvel didn’t treat him right.
Just the sound of the webs are so crispy rn, cannot wait after all the disappointment recently with game devs. Lookin at u OW2 and Activisiom with COD.
Just from what I saw there, I think they are really going to do the Symbiote storyline justice. MCU and Sony should both take note.
Be Greater Together ... COOP ?
Best kraven ever just like in the comics ... I love that I dont quite like it , the wing suít in miles I think the cool thing about these spider man games are the swing
1:27 Deadpool?
super hype!
Fire 🔥
Классно
Omg! I kept getting out of my seat after watching this. I'm definitely taking 3 days off so I can play this master piece of marvel. Can't wait for the 3rd
I like how Peter's and Miles' UIs are different, and reflect personality. Nice touch!
Meh forced to play as diversity Spider-man. No thanks.
I REALLY LIKE REALLY HOPE THIS COMES TO PC BECAUSE I DONT HAVE A PS5 AND THIS GAME LOOKS AMAZING 🤩🤩🤩
The " see you in 10 years " comment, let's do something.  Let's all saved this and come back to it in 10 years 😅 See you lot in 10 years from today 💯
That was GOOD
Oohhh yeahhhhh
this goes so raw dude, I'm so excited
11:33 bully maguire moment
Oh yeah! We’ve got symbiote spidy! I SO HOPE that’s a suit and powers we can equip whenever…like in Web of Shadows
There’s so much to love in the first two minutes of gameplay, just let me play this game right now!
Can we stoooppp making the symbiote webbing black? It was cooler when they just replicated the normal webbing 😢
BRO is HIM !!!!!!
If they did the suits like in the first game, imagine there’s symbiote variants
Man, I can't wait to play this... Also I will miss John Bubniak as Peter Parker 😢
I got a feeling we will be having a showdown mission between Symbiote Peter and Miles. This is going to be so good.
Crying in ps4
Yoooo and I thought nothing could top the first Spider-Man game. If this is on pc at release I will gladly buy it even if I don't use a co troller this looks iiiiincredible
Anybody else ready for Dashie to place this?
Don't you think that the black suit it's a little... Ugly? 😅  I mean, it's really closed to the cómics versión but something feels wrong to me.
finally i been waiting for this lets go
the snappiness and cartoony feel in animation it feels different it feels way too fresh now
okay this is … 🫨
Web of shadow 🤟🏻
they didn’t hold back with this game at all 🔥🤯
Game of the year incoming
Is there a co-op mode ?
The wraith is visible is the tablet kraven is tracking from this means we will most probably fight yuri
GONNA PUT SOME DIRT IN YOUR EYE
I hope Peter dances awkwardly in the streets
Web of Shadows vibes...
The fact that peter still wearing his red suit when he first appears means that he just get the symbiot on him
This will definitely be goty
Aye if miles had the symbiote suit would it literally just be the same 💀  (its a L joke but i tried)
Peter is ruthless in this game omg. I am so excited. Kraven has the best storyline here.
i love the little things like Miles calling Pete "Spider-Man" in public rather than just yelling his real first name out there. Idk why but its so nice to me that the developers took that into account.
Insane!!!! 😮😮😮
This looks awesome! Take my money already!
I'm calling it now miles vs peter ending fight
I'm hard.
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes I LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!!
Peter went full Shane
That is pretty impressive 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍. My favourite superhero in action. Right now I dont have any pc or anything to play these games 😢. But as soon as I get a pc I am definitely downloading spiderman, spiderman miles morales and spiderman 2 games. Ohhhhh mannnn I am getting very excited to play this game. ❤❤❤❤. And they revealed a very strong clue that in another spiderman movie we would see venom and spiderman will be on one side and kraven the hunter is also releasing. So we may see kraven in upcoming spiderman movie and venom will be on spiderman's side. I am very excited to see my very favourite characters in one movie. GREAT JOB MARVEL.
Welp. To those coming here in 2033, 10 years after the game came out, I say to you, hello. How are you? Was the game what you wanted? Did it disappoint you?
Web of Shadows 2
I'm totally here for Pete's inner Sasuke Uchiha.
This looks crazy 😱🔥🔥
Watching a super hero fly through rings is giving me ptsd
Epic
See ya chump
It really seems like they've one up'd the first two games in every conceivable way. And the story... Kraven, Symbiotes, Lizard being the only hope for keeping Harry alive. And let's not forget there are a TON of possible other villains they confirmed the existence of in the first game who could still be roaming, as well as Dr Morgan Michaels aka Morbius. Ive been so hyped for this for years now and it looks like Insomniac is going to exceed every expectation once again.
Seeing this makes me wanna throw away my xbox bro😭😭
I feel like they both are going to fight at like the end of the game, and Peter is going to win, but somehow, he then retracts from his symbiote suit and stops himself from seriously hurting or killing Miles
I bet that there's not only going to be a Miles vs Peter fight because of symbiote, but also that we'll be able to choose who to control.
It’s timeee!!!!
Black spidey and Kraven huh...gives me 'Kraven the last hunt' vibes
Looks the same as old game
It feels weird seeing the suburbs in the this game.
I dont think you understand me parker i said i wanted pictures of spiderman not pp in spidermans
HYPE!
I’m almost at a loss for words. This looks absolutely amazing, everything we’ve been waiting for while being tortured by a single screenshot.
11:33 i love how he throws the poor guy and Miles just look at him like “bro wth” 😂😂😂
😘👌
This is like the spiritual successor to Spider-Man 3 the video game or maybe even Ultimate Spider-Man!
I can't believe this Ganke jackass is just dropping Peter and Mile's names like that.
Please do it for ps4
I would pay ACTUAL money to see both games played and edited like this
Ok yeah I think something happened to mj
Gives me that web of shadow vibes from 360
i want to play this game right now take my money
the question is, will this be game of the year or will it be tears of the kingdom?
Хочу скореееее 🎉🎉🎉 куплю Соньку ради спайди
Hello future gamer, this game looks amazing during the trailer but after 10 years how come you haven’t played it yet?! xD
no Graphcial Upgrades , Not so much Uniqueness Just another Boring game .
I hope the symbiote won't make Peter say the n word to Miles
Release the full gameplay. I'm too broke to by a playstation or pc
symbiote spider has the same right trigger attack from Ultimate Spiderman nice
Goty
Peter’s gonna put some dirt in your eye…
chill bro 3:05
It would’ve been cooler if Venom said “so do I”
i hope he does the dance
I know this is most likely all pre-rendered but the greater control in the air Peter is showing off really excites me and I hope it translates well in actual gameplay.
Fire spider and suit but make it full symbiote not lolk like armorrrr 😢.. but still fire
Cant wait to play it on the ps5
OMG SO HYPE TAKE MY MONEY
Boss battles been way to easy in hardest difficulty in spiderman games....I hope it will be fixed in spiderman 2!!!!!
In 13 years this game is gonna be legendary nostalgia
Now Yuri will be playing a Spider-Man more in line with his most famous character.
All the spiderman games are actually great af one of my favorite series
The beginning caught be off guard ngl
These games are better than the movies
The flight suit is beautiful!!!!
Oh man the simbiote and his side effects
Eagerly waiting for miles and spiderman face off 🔥🔥🔥
Can’t wait for this to come out
Buenísimo mano ojala salga pronto
Masterpiece, easily destroy Batman dark knight and all DC
Yeah the final boss is definitely gonna be a Peter vs Miles kind of thing
Bro it would of actually been crazy if instead of saying “so do I” he said “so do WE” when miles said the lizard has big teeth
I would love to see Agent Venom in Spider Man 3
All i need is a release date now, and then I’ll be fully confident in this game. Thank you Insomniac for taking your time to deliver what could be the best Spider-Man game ever.
Yo, what if Miles gets the Symbiote exclusively in hard mode?
This game is fixing to be so good
Better buy a PS5 can't wait to be Spiderman
I was hoping the symbiotes  eyes were a bit more aggressive and alien like until I seen them shift at 11:54 !!! Insomniac always delivers.
excited for the 3fps PC port
well time to save up for a ps5
Spiderman vs spiderman?
co-op?
Miles is not Spider-Man
I can get behind pre-ordering this.
11:33 spider-man aggressive throwing a civilian on the ground since he possessed the symbiote
Venom spidey has always been badass
Looks so gas let’s go can’t wait!
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Noe for the pressure valve
So many new mechanics. This is more than we asked. I love it!
Looks great but imo Peter should have had 2-3 games of his own before Miles was introduced. I’m all about organic progression and feel like a concentrated story is better than expediting the universe.
Just perfection. I'm so HYPED!!!
Venom is awesome but what’s even cooler is fighting in the suburbs
Prototype?
Dr. Curt Connors 8s my favorite villian to spiderman.
See in 10 years Avi, hope u would have played this game by then
Sucks that the game is exclusive to the PS5.   I was so looking forward to playing it on my PS4.
Ambatubust 😢
When will it get released for pc?
The most badass thing I've seen all week 3:05
Another SpiderMan DLC
Game of the year guy’s?
What a game mind blowing
So the game randomly is just gonna strip all control away from the player and forces them to play a completely different character in a totally different area? oh you wanted to watch that guy you beat up rag-dolling around for a couple of seconds? How about no!
Too bad I have to wait four years for it to have a mediocre pc port
So Peter is the final boss
Yeah this is going to be good
The symbiotes eyes shift a bit more aggressive at 11:54 great detail
bully peter is coming :))
The black suit looks kind of gross to me
I think this is where you get to play as both Peter AND Miles. This is sick 💜💜💜
Can you release for the PC platform too??
Bully Maguire skin confirmed?
I'm just waiting  for him to wipe out a chidori....or scream Narutooooooo
they could do 10 of these and ill buy em
Wow just wow
Feel bad for the girlfriends this fall , we going single this fall cuz they ain’t getting no attention
Vemon just reminds me of Slenderman 😢
I can't wait to play this on PC in 5ish years lol..
I'm wondering since Miles is included in the venom saga now somewhat.. does that mean we'll have a Miles Vs. Peter fight or... Peter will eventually find himself and get rid of the symbiote. Either way im down for it.. game looks amazing. Can't wait to see Green Goblin because I dont believe Kraven is final boss considering the way part 1 ended.
I hope we don’t have to constantly switch between Peter and Miles. Just give me Peter Parker and leave Miles alone 😂
It's Sasuke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bet peter snd miles will fight like near the end
i wish this comes on pc in a few years
I just hope they show how much the man has been holding back all these years
Prototype 3 looking really good
GOTY INCOMING TOTK AIN'T GONNA HAVE NOTHING ON THIS
i hope they make the ai better and combat more tuff the first ones nail every single detail but the combat is a bit lacking please try ur best guys to make it less repetitive if possible
WOW!!! I'M FREAKING PART OF THE HISTORY NOW!!!
Im really glad they decided to showcase the Symbiote right off the bat. The animations look clean, and the abilites each Spiderman has is unique, but not one sided. Clearly, Peter has gotten an upgrade, to balance out Miles' new abilites. Wish there was Co-Op, but whos to say there wont be an online Co-Op or something.
I didn't realise I ate a whole 12min video until the end 💀    You're pretty good
Yeah this is Uncharted level time of QTE cinematic
OMG !!! I love it
Spider-raiden
The symbiote gameplay looks amazing
The change in Peter is so drastic, the aggression, the rage all of it. You can definitely tell the suit what’s causing it Can’t wait for this game. 🤩
Things I really liked about Shattered Dimensions was the style that was less like Arkham and of course the symbiote powers. I’m super stoked to see it return with seemingly more freedom. Love the multikick against the wall, I remember the DS version of Shattered Dimensions had something similar.
Gonna trip on shrooms and play this
Bully maguire strikes again!
If you noticed when he says “so do i” the eyes change a little into a venom look
FINALLY-I mean, nice.
Kraven looks perfect
I absolutely love it, can't wait until i actually get a PS5 in some distant future to play this.
8:45 Bro is way more aggressive and mad and dismissive this is so comic accurate, i cant wait for the game to come out!
RIP XBOX. Redfall vs Spiderman 😂
Oh no... Web web... Swing swing... Pew pew and another game from spider man
Game name
I'm not going to enjoy being Peter so much this time I guess. Symbiote is cool and all but I prefer snark :P
Game Ganke: I'll boot up the drone and meet you there. Movie Ganke: I'm not your guy in the chair!
This is what the old Spiderman games felt like, when we were kids.
Did anyone peep miles doing the kame hame ha 😂
Its so good!
I wonder if you’ll have the ability to turn the symbiote off and on like in web of shadows.
This is PERFECT! 😮‍💨👌🏻
probably this game gonna be this year game of the year
this looks so promising, can't wait to see Peter go nuts! see you in 5 years when people rewatch this trailer
We’ve been waiting since 2021 💀
I love Miles Morales I want to see a seperate movie on Miles Morales
ITS ABOUT TO GET RACIST IN HERE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This clip is better than any DC movie😂
So, it's looking like it's gonna shape up that Miles will HAVE to fight Peter at some point to get the symbiote suit off of him, and Venom will face them both
All I hear is sasuke uchiha… and I love it!
one more spidey to join would be nice and perfect
When it’s already clear game of the year 4 months before it drops
Insomniac games forever holding it down since childhood, this is perfection
people who want this but can’t get it | | 👇
THE CAMERA ANGLES ARE CRAZY, THE FIGHTING IN CRAZY, THE SYMBIOTE IS CRAZY THE CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR IS CRAZY KRAVEN IS CRAZY EVERYTHING IS CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE LIZARD IS CRAZY
Its time to be bully parker again like in spiderman 3
The rage in Peter's voice !
This looks so much like prototype.. and i love it
Cya guys in 10 years 😢🎉
makes me feel like playing Web of Shadows again
Spider-Man feels like he's gonna say: Lizaaaaaaard!  You can't escape ME! I'll chase you to the ends of the EAAARRTH!
Вау.
See you in 11 years when someone wants to relive the memories of this game
This reminds me of Spider-Man web of shadows
2:56 so BADASSS🔥  peter vai ser uma luta contra chefe certeza.
Finalllyyyyyy
No sasuke…wait wrong show😅
Imagine we get a venom spiderman vs Miles 🔥
that was AWESOME
dang, Joseph Seed had a glow up
This gonna be fire🔥
Catch u in 10 years guys
Yeah, as of right now, this is a very early candidate for potential game of the year
Better than movie
Bully maguire vibes
SHOCKEEEEEERRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!
Looks like there’s gonna be some horror elements to this game
1:28 Oh my God, It’s Yuri!!!!
My jaw just dropped
Looks like its going to be a banger!!! No one is going to talk about the copy paste swinging animations and dodge.. come on.. was hoping for a swinging revamp on the next gen.. rest looks insane
SO HYPED
i like everything, but.... i do NOT like graphics. It is look like game from 2013 :(
idk how to feel about the amount of energy beam type attacks, it's spiderman he fights with his limbs and webs not huge blasts of black goo/bio electricity
That was 12 minutes? Gameplay was so good made time fly by 🔥🔥🔥
всё то же самое!!!
Seeing Deadpool on the pad kinda hyped me up
looks so awesome  i wish i had a ps5
Dude this looks so cool this is y I want a PlayStation so badly
Peter sounds more pissed off
W
wtf? it looks like a ps4 game
This is exactly what I was looking for W Insomniac 🙏🏽🙏🏽
"YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME, I'll CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!"
It looks good, though I kind of expected more graphics-wise. It could just be the fact that it's a console game though, so all in all seems fun.
One thing I miss from the original is Peter's jokes one of my favorites that made me laugh was digboys and he Peter said "oh that's so going to catch on" lol
To future me when I’m re-watching old game trailers on the toilet. Remember the grocery list.
Miles: cmon, let's get after him. Peter: no, he's mine, stay here. Miles: are you sure? I mean, he's got BIG teeth! Peter: Mine are bigger. That got me hooked! The Black Suit looks really good, and the detail! Pete's looking like a more awesome Web of Shadows Spider-Man.
So basically it's Prototype but with Spider-Man
So awesome!!
I can’t wait for them to reveal the online side
Kraven the Hunter?  Oh yeah!!!
Not only does the gameplay look phenomonal but they really nailed it with Peter's symbiote voice. Grizzly, violent and badass. Just like every good iteration has been. This game is gonna knock it out of the park, just like the first 2.
The water looks seriously bad 😢
I love how this reminds me of how Web of Shadow’s black Suit worked.
I can wait  that play game
Excited but some of the dialogue is cringe and that Miles Morales voice actor just isn’t it. I wish it was Josh Keaton voicing Peter….
Plz be on steam  🤞
Their heads look so goofy and oversized
boy that looks like killer croc
Deadpool?!?!?!?!
Melhor que os filmes atuais.
Watching this again to cheer me up after learning that Tina Turner died 😢
Love how aggressive they portray Peter, Jesus I can’t wait for this game. A Spider-Man that doesn’t hold back is your worst nightmare.
I love hearing Sasuke in Spiderman.
It a footage from VENOM: official movie open world game on ps5 and other console.
Cool stuff
A representative offender.
I think. This is my favorite thing. This game.  I already know.
I’m ready to buy this game I’m pumped!!!
“so do i”
This game requires A RTX 7090 with 100 gb ram, 2 terabytes hard drive space and a Intel core i25 with a monitor that can refresh at 512 hrtz. Good fun for everyone!
Now dig on this
I’ll never forget this video.
Soon, Where 🕷️ man begins his greatest challenge: the battle within himself.
R.I.P My recommendation box🙃
Miles and Pete fighting yesssss
YEssGO!!! nEW GAME FOR PLAYSTATION WHICH ISs RELATED TO
Not enough puddles
LOVE
The only game that hasn't dissapointed me since Corona 😍😍
Man this game about to be a masterpiece!
God dam this looks dope AF, they killed the symbiote powers 10/10  I’m 12 again, taking me back to neversoft PS1 spiderman feels 😂 I’m turning 30 this year, thanks insomniac
4:45 giving me Spider-Man noir vibes
Sasuke
It's like a What If Miles was around during the black suit saga....
This might be the most anticipated super hero game ever
12:23 See you this fall!!!! 🤩🫵
Can't wait to play this fall 2024.
That subtle little change to the symbiote suit's eye when Pete says "So do I" to appear more Venom like is *chef's kiss*
Insomniac really gets Spidey. Kraven and the Lizard had never look so formidable and dangerous since "Torment". Also de symbiote suit really looks alien this time. This game is going to be a must have!
"He dresses like a spider and looks like a bug... we should all just give him one big hug... look out whooo! Here comes Spider-Man!"
Oh my god!! This game looks amazing!!!
GAME OF THE YEAAARRRRRR
3:10 that was personal
Okay now this is epic 😎
wow superb
I hope this means we get emo peter alongside the classic emo peter dance haha
Except NPC having some good AI everything else was good.
idk why but i wish only peter had the web glide cause miles already has his venom boosts and stuff but it’s cool both have it
I’m going to be broke
I can’t wait
lol whats with the roided out guys, nobody that big! and the obsession with licking blood in movies and games lol
I feel theyre gonna downplay Kraven as not the MAIN boss fight. Theyre totally gonna have venom be THE main boss fight.
That sasuke voice coming back
One thing I haven't seen anyone mention is that at 12:18 you can see the symbiote trying to engulf the word "Together" only to be stopped by Miles' venom blast. I think this is foreshadowing a potential climax where Miles is forced to fight Peter as the symbiote tries to rip the two apart.
Just remembered they are also making Wolverine. That game is going to be amazing from looking at the darkness and anger in this game. Insomniac please keep it going, never seem to disappoint. Almost enough to bring a tear to a man's eye.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Will it be for PS5 only?
YOOOOOO I can't wait!!! They said its gonna be darker and im loving Peter's aggressiveness!
Yooo ive been waiting for a functional black suit for so long they did so amazing on the design of the black suit i just love everything about this game so far it looks so good
2:36 Peter's aggressive black suit voice reminds me of the cartoon black suit where he was chasing Shocker and I love it! Lmao  "I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!!"
I like the fact that they both have the underarm webs.
I’m definitely going to get this
omg this is insane
Spiderman is a complete menace 🔥
Nice man bun ❤
Wow such a week,we've had 3 FNAF trailers relating to the movie,DLC and now main game and now Spider Man 2?! Man this looks amazing the gameplay and seeing Black Suited Spider man definitely gives me Spider Man 3 Sam Rami vibes so I look forward to be getting this! 😃
Nice gameplay 5/24/23 I wanna get this game
Yo, that chidori choke slam was amazing!😆
Well I’m hype
This is so amazing, looking forward to this game
Anybody else notice Peter just dropping the civilian at 11:31? Even his need to help others is clouded by the symbiote
It feels like "Shadow of the Web". Wow
The little details like how miles sensory and Peter's symbiote faze are awesome
Hopefully Peter will try and me his relationship with venom work this time
Another couple years of painful waiting for PC gamers.
Easily GAME OF THE YEAR
The dialog from Peter is SPOT TF ON!!!!
Ughhh do I have to buy a PS5 now???? 😢 😭
3:15 This scene gave me prototype 2 vibe .
❤
I hope this game will be release in pc
Bro why does the lizard almost look like Arkham Knights killer croc
HUD be lookin kinda tacky, otherwise this looks fkn amazing tbh
0:57 Dude just broke someone's neck with his THUMB.
I feel like the end plot would be them fighting each other then they find a way to remove the symbiote off of peter and they fight it(possesing a different person most likely eddie because he exists in that game) together
Peter is going to put some dirt in mile's eye
I wonder if it's my sight or not. But at 11:54 I thought I saw Peter's Eye Frame tried to change shape a bit. Almost looks like Venom's Eyes.
I like hes voice it feel like god of war
So it's a QTE fest??
The black spider man gameplay looks and feels just like spider man web of shadows?!
miles is gonna win for sure if peter fights him
love the symbiote suit
Bro threw a civilian. Gotta love the small details when he got the symbiote.
Why?? Why the video ended? I need moreeee!!
I dont like, i love it
PS4 game
It's definitely giving spider man web of shadows type of vibes
This looks epic - but the missions were already fun in the last spider man. Gonna wait and see how they did on the open world and side missions.
Still pissed this ain’t gonna be on PS4
Add Deadpool DLC to this game in the future, and my life would be complete :P
Wait where have I been? Is Peter wearing his venom suit?
The gameplay like those fake game trailer made by china😂
I want a ps5 now
it looks like a ps4 game
It looks amazing but also is just a cinematic quick time event simulator?
Seems like more spider man.  Yippee.
I was here
I love the Web of Shadows vibes this is giving me
Well venom symbiote looks sick af. But i already know the plot miles is gonna have to fight Peter at the end lol
Why I feel there will be a Miles Vs SpiderVenom fight somewhere!!
God i love it already
Did miles just hit a kamehameha??!!
Bro Idk if kraven is gonna fight venom but if he does he’s getting folded
Reminds me of prototype
I liked Miles's reaction at 11:33 , he was like "Hey, you are not supposed to throw civilians like that".  Nice details😅
I CANT WAITTT
They was getting busy 🔥
Everyone's saying we're gonna fight Peter as Miles, but what if the game forces us to fight Miles as Peter?
Sasuke vibes
THATS SO FREAKING AWESOME! I'M REALLY EXCITED FOR THIS
The design of the black suit disappointed me
Only crap 😳
Op
Something tells me peter spiderman will be a boss  battle and we are using miles
It's INDIE?  😮
Bully Maguire time?😂
I can already tell that the symbiote is making Peter more aggressive 😂
I LOVE IT TAKE MY MONEYYYYYYYYY
8:58 the sun just going away
Going to be a great PC experience
The fight that is going to happen between Miles and Peter will be insane
Foreshadowing at the end. Be Greater. Together. The word together starts to be overtaken by the symbiote, and the blue lightning the miles uses vaporizes it. Miles Vs Pete boss fight on the way.
I’m probably alone, but hear me out. Spider-Man 1 looked amazing and exciting, it was an awesome game that I greatly enjoyed getting 100%… Spider-Man 2 just looks like more of the same 🥱.
I see they still have miles sounding like he hasn't hit puberty yet. It's so distracting him sound like his voice is on the verge of cracking still
this game looks phenomenal
Wtf!?!? PROTOTYPE 3!?!?!
3:40 There are people inside the buildings now!
Funnily enough Pete's voice actor is actually the same one that does the English dub of both Sasuke in Naruto, And! The English voice of our main walking leather shope boy himself, Hasao in dot.HACK GU...  Was really surprised when I found out that the guy who voiced the biggest edge lords in my tweenage years...also voiced one of the dorkist, most socially awkward heros in pop culture-- and pulled off a really convincing Peter Parker so well in the first game...  But Simbiote Spiderman is really showing the Edgelord...can't wait for more of the mental and physical changes it does to him throughout the game!!
spider-man starting to act like batman
holy moly
Guess I'm buying a PS5 lol
wow
This game looks fantastic!! Although I think the speed could get toned down. Don’t get me wrong it looks great but it feels like 1 web gets you across the city 😂 maybe it’s just the video, it probably feels a lot better irl
Insomniac are such an amazing developer of games it's unreal. I had goose bumps the way through and the new mechanics like flinging of the lampposts and gliding look so good it's unreal. Well done guys another epic game and it's not even out yet. So excited can't wait now need to get a ps5 haha
GYATTT THE WINGSUIT AND THE      LITTLE SLINGSHOT ACTION IM SO READY
Miles morales, ragnarok,horizon forbidden West, spiderman 2,and soon ff 16...meanwhile xbox struggling to get one good game out
My God this looks phenomenal!!
Game looks great so far. So glad we get to see an official look of how the game will look and how Pete will behave with the symbiote suit.
“SaMe MecHaNicS aS tHe OtHer GaMeS” it’s literally a story based video game, people will find anything to complain about
Man, waiting for this game...
In the bottom right of the map at 1:34 is that the spiderverse kingpin?
The symbiote is a really cool design but holy cow, kraven probably has the most boring looking character ever. Just wow
Bro this is peak at its finest
Please be available for PS4
Oh god, Ganke is going to be horrible.
If there isn’t a single reference to Bully Maguire anywhere in the game, I will consider it a failure
INSOMNIAC DON'T MISS.
Saske?
Kraven character design, Pete's symbiote suit (his voice tho), the Lizard looking wild, and the gliding looks so smooth 🔥🕸️
Man, Yuri Lowenthal is bringing out his inner Sasuke for Symbiote Spider-Man
“Uh why are there bodies in my yard?”
I love how Peter got reckless with the drone while Miles played it safe. Perfect parallel to Miles being reckless during the convoy mission.
Bro that infinite leg kick combo is different 🔥🔥
Hehe
"So do i" 😈
12:02 The suit.....
I’ll come back to tell y’all how the game was after I beat it
I love how miles did a hadouken
Yea everytime I go to the jungle and I find blood and I'm gonna taste it. Cuz why not?
in my opinion it’s not going to be the same it looks kinda bad im sorry it’s just my opinion
2:36 Literally Web of Shadows with better graphics, not saying that i don't like it, it already is a solid 8/10 base Good job Insomniac!!
Why do they still have that stupid side dodge while swinging for Peter? Lmao
I am getting  shatter dimensions vibes and web of shadows Which Ioveeee
Take my money now 😭😭
🤩🤩🤩WAAAAAAAAANNT!!!🤩🤩🤩
😮
Can we just get a release date?
Prototype 3 is here and it is awesome
If the opening of this game is not spider man chasing big wheel in New York I’m gonna be upset
Is Spider-Man straight up killing people?!
Go Playstation for keeping Spiderman wolverine exclusives 🎉 kuddo 2 ya and that's coming from a xbox fan boi lol the game looks amazing
Peter and Miles will for sure have a fight
I really hope they put this on PS4 one day
The black suit represents peter becoming more vicious and less friendly. Even when the symobite isn’t attach to his suit.
Venom and Spiderman the coldest combination🔥😈 The new powers the graphics this game will be amazing
Cartoon 😂😂
so now miles just flys like superman and has thor electricity? wat the bark?
I can feel the years of Web of Shadows gameplay being burned back into my brain
I love that shot where peter’s eyes change into venom slightly   great attention to detail 👍
Yeah, finally some symbiote action. Time to go full on Bully Maguire!!!
11:29 Peter rescued the civilian but on the landing just threw him instead of being cautious. Loved that detail and the reaction of Miles as well! The relationship between the two while Peter gets more agressive is going to be awesome.
its funny they always pretend like manhattan is super huge.. the longest length is 11 miles
This game is going to be amazing
That super slingshot is gonna be fun af, and just being that fast in general
This gameplay makes me wanna buy a PS5
Kraven The Hunter The Lizard
This game looks dope af🔥🔥 excited for it 💯
can these writers write for the MCU?
3 minutes in and I'm already sold. Just take my money Sony.
Man I can’t wait for this game it already looks amazing 😮‍💨
es hora de ser dark
How he didn't care about how he threw that guy that he rescued... awesome touch 👌🏻
We can glide that is so cool
It's giving Uncharted 4 style chases mixed with Arkham Knight style team up fighting
This game is the only reason I'd consider getting a PS5, and it is very convincing
En efecto es cine
😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
Am I the only one that doesn’t really like the look of the symbiote suit everything else was amazing can’t wait
When can we preorder
Venom
I smell GOTY
Spiderman 2 gameplay looks AMAZING! Can't wait to swing into action and experience the thrill firsthand! 🕷️🕸️
NUT
3:11 that flurry of kicks is just fuckin brutal
If there's more of that stuff later on in the game, then I could already see the rivalry between loz totk.
omg they did it again
I have a feeling they are a fighting eachother in the end
I already know this'll be good. TAKE MY MONEY
I cannot wait for this game fantastically made🎉🎉
people who disliked this video are blind🤣
I hope this come to PC asap
I wonder if spider verse and insomniac talked together for miles powers. That would be so ill
Kraven is wearing the orc heritage armor.
Omfg
es el peor spider con symbiote que he visto en toda mi vida
see what happens when you show raw gameplay of an upcoming game:   rightful Praise from the gaming community   how it should always be
Me hizo recordad a k9999999
Será que preñe el cazador . 😮‍💨🥵🥵🥵
The Symbiote reminds me of the thing you get from The Prototype
I think im in love
Thanks sony.
See you after 15 years then when the algorithm puts this back
That's not a lizard, it's a freaking Godzilla, but thinner
W game
Looks breathtaking, it's like watching a movie and playing a game
I’ve bought every dlc and both miles and Spider-Man’s game, I got a ps5 and I’ve never been more excited! See y’all in 10 to 15 years when it becomes a nostalgia hit
Now if only we still had Peter’s original face instead of the wannabe Tom Holland one from the Remastered version…
Bro turned to Bully Lowenthal
I wish i had a PS5 to play this...
So how did venom get in Spider-Man already??
Spidey is so angry. I like that.
"He got away from us" It's subtle, but I think it's a hint that the bonding to the black costume is further along than we think. You can tell because when Miles pops in with the tracker, Peter looks at him like he already forgot he was there
I’m leaving a memory comment here so when time flys I’ll remember that I was here
Looks incredible can never get tired of Spider-Man movies or games 👍🏾👍🏾
It's crazy how we play video games to escape reality and games are becoming more like reality
THEY DONT MISS
Got me giggling out of my chair and allat. WHAT!!!
Kraven is SOOO overrated, I'm so tired of seeing him in stuff
I’m here for this angry Spider-Man
Looks great! Hope the pc port runs better than the last one cuz I’d love to play it.
I seriously hope we get conversations between Peter and the symbiote.
Oh Peter's dark in this
My body is so ready 😩
Let's Go man!
I love yall bro
Looks like spider-man its going Full Sasuke uchiha
Lets call fake/wannabe Spiderman what he is,, legend leeching.
This is crazy! 😮 I’m loving the aggressive everything about Peter! He’s off his rocker and it’s very new, and interesting dynamic to see. They have my money. I truly appreciate games that strive to up the ante each time and they’ve delivered everytime.
How come parker and miles are in the same timeline
Sasuke Uchiha and Darwin Waterson???
The swinging looks so good ＿|￣|○
This thing is better than the whole She Hulk Series.
Imagine a boss fight against Spiderman with the symbiote
WEBLINE??? my god 🤩
sadly, I do not have a PS5 so I'm really excited to watch playthroughs of this!
Yuri Lowenthal bringing out the Sasuke a bit
Classic
I loved the Gameplay Trailer but we had way too much miles morales already, barely had any Pete besides seems like he still has the same swing animations i hope they evolved it a lil bit more.
So uh nobody gonna mention Kraven? I kinda always liked his existance as a Spiderman villain.   Lizard too, just maybe his design here isnt super inspired its just spikey.
LETS GOOO!!!!!!
His angry voice sounds like spider-cop
Yuri is in his "SHOCKER! GET BACK HERE, SHOCKERR!" Spider-Man phase
Please no MJ segments!
haha blade wolf
SHOCKERR?!?!? SHOCKERRRR!!!!!
Im only upset that we don't have a release date yet. Spiderman 1 was near perfect and so much fun, with an excellent story and gameplay that was fun, needed tweaking. Spiderman: MM was also nearly perfect with better gameplay, but a forgettable story. I hope this is really the perfect synthesis of both and this can be MY Game of the year. (I know it was get slaughtered by Tears of the Kingdom, but I dont have a switch just PS5 so this will be mine)
I really hope they changed his face back to the original mode cus maann
Will we get the SHOOOCKEEEEER! moment in this game? Please make sure that happens.
let's gooooo baby
1:03 after your dad give you that whoopin
exceeded my expectations!!!
I really hope you can somehow play as venom like in the ultimate Spider-Man that’s my childhood
I need a ps5!! Uggghh😢😢
Gonna be so good
tuff
Will thisgame be on PS4 too???
That's Godzilla!
Insomniac took it’s time, and is paying off waaay too well.
Ah man, I van'y wait to play this one, love Lizard's new look. Almost looks crocodilian.
i never even got to play the first one and now i'll never get to play the 2nd.. its okay tho cuz i got pc web of shadows and thats way more fun than any gameplay of sm2018 ive ever seen :)
GOKIL
we need Spooder man in this game !!
This looks epic
Since when could you shoot lightning as Spider-Man
I love this already
I love the fact that Kravans gonna be huge! Part of the game is worth the wait I guess also the multiple can be possible but you never know it seems that Harry's gonna play a huge role as a black cat! Cause of his radar and the fact that Peter is in the basement that seems to be Dr. Connor's. I look forward to this! He also seems to care for the lizard a lot more! It also seems that bigger villains at the eyes to come and it seems that the symbiote has a giant hatred for Kravans and that's they can fly is super cool!
Spidermen don't kill) miles proceeds to pump 10,000 volts into someone
CANTTTTT WAITTTTT
esse jogo vai ser perfeito espero que até la eu ja tenha um ps5
THE GLIDING 😩
VENOM, WHY DO YOU NOT WANT TO ATTACH URSELF TO MILES?????????
My god I want a Spider-Man vs Spider-Man fight.
Iam seeing this trailer because you know if the miles got hair in this game
SHOCKERRRRRRRRRRR YOU CANT ESCAPE MEEEEEEEEEEEE I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
Are we still limited to only NYC or can we go to like brooklyn, Bronx, union city, etc
It's just bad
The gliding❤️ Symbiote❤️ They are gonna give it all and end it with the biggest bang
OMG! IT LOOKS SOO DOPE!
Back in black.
If you come back in 10 years time please like this so I can be reminded of this masterpiece
The only reason people are so excited about this game - bar has dropped so low and decent games are so rare, even this Miles Morales DLC can generate some hype. This is basically same old ps 4 spider man with some added cool stuff.
W game w Peter w miles
This is sick
The fight with Venom later in the game is gonna be Crazy
Just please tell me I can control when to let go of the webline this time… I HATED that we couldn’t do loops in the first game lol
We had the sinister 6 in the first game. Now we have Kraven The Hunter, and Dr Conors. I’m so excited to see what other villain will be in this sequel
GAME OF THE FUCKIN YEAR YO
New York again?!?! Can’t they do a different area in the world?
Game of the century easily
Definitely reminds me if the animated Spiderman series episode the alien suit. Classic, so Eddie Brock should be turning into venom in this one. Finger crossed.
I really really want to play this game right now it looks amazing
Banger for sure
Its like watching a movie...amazing coming from SNES days to this!
They took a note out of web of shadows for the symbiote combos
parah sih keren banget
I'm still convinced miles needs his own code name.. he's too popular of a character just to leave him sharing another hero's name
Was getting some real Prototype vibes from the black suit abilities. That's definitely a cool way to give him his own special abilities so that Miles isn't just a better version of him gameplay-wise. I thought they would just lean more into the tech, but this is much more interesting.
one small but really cool detail is how when peter saves that one guy at the end he just throws him down to the ground not caring for him and instantly taking off while miles just kinda looks at him odd and double backs to see if the dudes okay
Why does Spiderman sound like matpat
I can’t wait to web in you
This looks sick
Haven't had a first look reaction like this since I saw Gta 4 ...i am utterly blown away.
Oh dope dope, gameplay, aesthetics and Peter's new attitude while wearing the Symbiote are all on point like crazy, this game is gon' get bought!!!
movesets reminds me of shuma gorath in mvc lol
can we get a bully maguire outfit?
A wing suit ! Why isn’t anyone talking about their wing suit mechanics! Amazing trailer ! 🤯🤯
Goddamn it, it looks too good, now I have to spend money
Dude the voice 👌👌👌👌
1:27 BLACK CAT IS IN THE GAME!!
Love the detail when Peter just throws the civilian to the ground instead of checking if he’s ok 11:32
This actually looks so clean, and the combat... I'm so excited for this to hopefully, eventually come to pc.
QUE CARAJO WTF HERMOSO
YOOOOOO
The hype is real
These graphics dont look great
I’d love for Kraven to survive until then end so that he can be a villain in Wolverine
I can't wait to be the symbiote suit spiderman again now i just need to get my hands on one of the ps5s lol
I forgot this was a game trailer I thought I was watching a movie 😂
Me when the first images showed: "A "Turok Something"? That's your last game? ..... is that...? Oh. nice."
god ive never seen something so beautiful
Batman doesnt kill.  But Spiderman does.
They just knew the fans would be colossally disappointed if they introduced the symbiote without incorporating the black suit into the story and gameplay. I'm only a couple minutes in and I'm confident that this will be as definitive a portrayal as the 1994 series.
Wow! This looks amazing 🔥
*based off this presentation I’m assuming Peter will get out of control and miles would have to fight him*
Man, I hate tendrilly venom. I wish they cut that out and contained it just to carnage
Dude the symbiote powers look amazing. I was worried I was going to have more fun with Miles than with Peter since Miles has venom powers but the symbiote powers balances everything out.
Almost mistaken Prowler for Deadpool.
that ending 🔥
THIS GAME IS GAME OF THE YEAR HANDS DOWN
Is it 2 players
11:32 Notice how Peter tosses the person he saved and Miles is kinda surprised
Trash
2:57  you can tell the black suit pushes spiderman to the edge of his "no killing" rule lol.
Imagine if in the final game, peters gets a weird reverd voice when he says that line 11:54
This game is going to cement Yuri Lowenthal as my favorite spiderman actor.
Me getting ready to preorder: “THE CHECKS IN THE MAIL BABY!!!”
The only PS5 exclusive that was relevant at the Sony showcase lol
It looks incredible, I had very high expectations and they are being fulfilled, simply wow
My guess that miles probably gonna fight peter in this one
1:27 in this map you can see wraith,wraith is Yuri's vigilante persona after the end of "the city that never sleeps"
AMBATTAKAAAAAM
2:43 that dude´s back is beyond broken now
Anyone else get uncharted 4 vibes during the jetski chase?? This was such a thrill
A bit disappointed the black suit is just the classic black suit, was hoping for a unique design
Calling it. Game of the year
Now this is the superhero team up game we have all been waiting for!!
Did they do the same stupid face swap retcon of Tom Holland's face for Peter like they did in Miles Morales?
I’m fucken weeezing I’m so fucken excited
since spider man when became thor?
0:30 that’s also pretty cool
I just came
Miles: Its got big teeth  Peter: So do I😈
Shut up and just take my money
0:09 that’s cool
If this has the dance from Spider-Man 3 I'll web my pants.
But what about co-op 😞
Miles knows something’s up
cringy one liners, definitely a marvel game
I was gonna say that given how amazing ToTK is, SP2 is gonna need to up the ante . . But 4:00 in and my jaw is already on the floor!! The symbiote attacks are way more vicious and you can tell Pete is definitely feeling the effects of being bonded to it.
This is gonna be good
please tell me this wont take too long to come to pc
Looking forward to playing this 2 years from now on the PC if they deign to release it on a non-exclusive platform.
He's not normally like that
Wonder how him as Peter will look
I cant believe they really brought back the slingshot
Time to buy a ps5 finally
Now that's how to get me excited for a game
Lizard in this gives me Arkham killer croc vibes
No way 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I’m gonna cry !!! I miss that web of shadows vibe 🥹🥹❤️
jedi survivor, tears of the kingdom, and spiderman 2? 2023 is just the year of perfect sequels
This better have replayable story missions like Miles Morales does!
games gonna be amazing already know it!! IM SO HYPED
Mmm like this comment if youre hopping back over here after watching the spider man 3 trailer
Haven’t seen anybody talking about it, so I will. I love how at 11:31 after saving that civilian Peter is so impatient that he just toss him aside so aggressively and doesn’t even say a word to him, something that he would never normally do. And I like how Miles noticed that and looked weird at him. I also appreciate that they show how Peter isn’t messing around with the symbiont, he doesn’t make any joke and has always an impatient and agressivo tone to his voice…
I love that this time you can beat up females too 😊
Connor turned into a combination of Anguirus, Baragon and that giant lizard from that Dwayne Johnson movie with the giant white ape
GOTY
I am so excited
You can real hear saskue uchiha when peter is mad
It looks so cool 😍😍😍
Not me watching this while having an Xbox S Series and not a PS5 😫😫😫😭😭😭
"Its got big teeth" Peter:"So do I..."🔥
Andrés Navy No Me Digas Que También Aquí JAJAJ
2:42 YEAH!!!!! SYMBIOTE SUIT!!!!!!!!!
Bruh that wing suit and wind tunnels had me so hyped 😮
Oh, I am pumped about this one. They went all out for it. I love how fleshy the symbiote suit looks in this one. And Peter’s mannerisms are spot on. I was wondering how they were going to even out Peter and Miles’s powers. The good cop bad cop dynamic is going to be sick.
They are definitely gonna do Peter vs miles boss fight
I need the next spider-man game to include Silk. I'm tired of her being ignores. 😢😢 but I love this game already. ❤
I was worried about a gameplay trailer coming out after a two year wait This was just an even better trailer- this has to win Game of the Year
LET ME IN. LET ME IN.
Miles gamplay seems cool.
Hi future me😃
Can you make it on pc too?
Bro this aint spidey.  This is Sasuke, tf.
Sooo is it still co-op?
Yuri as Peter is great, he's channeling what he did for Sasuke in Naruto and it's perfect
Kraven!!!! Can’t wait
Wow, just wow.
THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY INSANE. CRAZIEST VIDEO GAME FOOTAGE IVE EVER SEEN
i have such high hopes for this game. the first one with peter and second one with miles was amazing but to see them combine elements of both and add aspects that people have craved since the first game, leads me to believe that this game will exceed everybody's expectations
I’m still poor so if the PS6 and PS5 is out by the time I get rich Im buying both I don’t care.  Edit: If everyone calls Pete the Spider-Man still… then what do they call Miles then?
I wonder if this is a new setting
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 Jay White was definitely here😁
Something tells me this game is gonna be darker than the previous 2
Man I really wish this was on Xbox and the first game but ik why it isn't
I just busted in 10 different positions wtf. I wish this would come out for pc at the same time too
See you in a couple years when the twist/foreshadow in the 3rd game is revealed
He stopped pulling his punches 💀
Finally.  Someone that understands what the symbiotes are supposed to be like and how they affect their hosts.  Not some godamn buddy cop trope like the Venom movie.
Take my money 🖕🏻
Ok I’m getting this game
Threw the destiny pyramid ship sound all thru this
I like that you can tell that the symbiotes changing peter with how he talks to miles and is being sorta rude and dismissive if it’s people he’s friends with. But you can see the effect the symbiote has when he’s taking on the hunters. I prefer it being more subtle changes instead of what they did in spiderman 3 with how he was just unbearable to be around.
Pete on ashwagandha
ok cool
Man I wish they was on Xbox Series X. I don’t feel like spending $800 on a PS5 just for spiderman lol
Why is Bricky Hunting Spiderman?
I loved the trailer and gameplay but the only thing I can certesise is the symbiot suit the transition is not clean and it can look cooler
Kraven's last hunt maybe? It's a shame I won't be able to play this game, it looks awesome
actually gonna be one of the greatest games of all time
Peter surely is NOT holding his punches anymore.
sickkk
I wish this released on PC day one. The wait for this will be wild.
I KNEW IT!   Peter wears the black suit, and Miles will have to fight his mentor some point in the story!
I just need Putin to hold those missiles a little bit longer… We need this release.
Peakkkk
Tbh I’m kinda disappointed and getting the “The Amazing Spider-Man 2” vibes from this. Hope this game is fkn good.
Reminds me of web of shadows with the symbiote gameplay. More symbiote tendrils and stuff compared to the raimi film.
oh my god
It's brilliant!!!! I already love this game!!!!
This game is sick can’t wait to play it
I hope the symbiote suit breaks away from Peter to leave venom as another enemy.
Well this Peter is a little more brutal and Unforgiving, not your typical friendly neighborhood spider is He? Also who's gonna be play this on steam deck?
I only dislike one thing change miles electricity back to the original color
Spider man 2.... we need the p i z z a t h e m e
First game I will buy!
reminds me of web of shadows
using the jetski to give himself more swing speed is epic af 7:50
Insomniac does not waste a single resource or day of development time. nobody does it like them. this is nuts.
Jeepers
Take my money now
Lost for words on the power of it's greatness
I love the black suit the fact the black suit have tentacle attacks, it gives me black of Shadow vibes
Looks like the most on rails game to date. QTE and definitely killing every single one of those normal thugs
🤩
I just came
Let us mark our calendars now for the 10 year anniversary of this trailer
Yessssssssssssssss🥹🥹
No 4K?
i cannot wait for this game. it brings me pure joy to finally see more on this game and the fact that its even better than i want it to  be
INSANAMENTE PIKA
Bully maguire reborn
Is gonna be like prototype 2 is like Alex Mercer and James Heller working together eventually when you beat all the bad guys you have to play the biggest part of the game as miles fighting symbiote controlled Peter Parker (Still the new face) who is gonna try to spread the symbiote infestation to the City. In small words it's gonna suck big time
amazing! I wanted to see more and more!
A real spiderman would of never developed such a relationship with the symbiote to the point where he has venom tendrils for nearly everything he does. Unless this is a darker peter parker character who gives into the suit, like from web of shadows or those shattered dimensions games, otherwise this is a not a faithful interpretation.
Aint getting a PS5 but will wait for pc version release cuz love the game
Пишу сообщение будущим челам которые пришли понастольгировать Сейчас в моде искусственный интеллект
Can't freaking wait
Woah, this looks gorgeous.
The devs have been COOKING
Finally something exciting
Thank's for that, insominiac
Makes me want to watch Spider man 3
Can you avoid playing as Miles and just play the real spider-man?
AWESOME
Speechless!
Game of the year baby hear we go
This is gearing up for a Miles vs Peter fight. I can’t wait for this.
Bully jorden confirmed
"I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye"
IMSONIAC ARE GENIUSS 🔥🔥🔥🔥
2023 is a banger year for games. Hogwarts, RE4 RM, Spiderman. Im having a great time!
There’s barley a difference between the cutscenes and gameplay, it’s gonna be crazy to see how this game feels to play. Will we truly feel what it’s like to be Spider-man?
I hope this gets released in August
if only i had a ps5
I’m lost for words, these next couple of years are gonna be legendary.
Wow can’t wait to play in like 3 years on pc cos no way I’m buying an entire overpriced console halfway through its life for 1 game. Nice try though!
Sasuke!
IM BUYING EVERYTHING THE DELUX THE ADD ONS  EVERYTHING
This rocks.
"You have no idea."  Okay when did Spider-Man turn into a horror game?
Please release this on PS4 please ❤
I just heard Peter say Connor is needed to save Harry. Possible Goblin dlc?
I think Pete’s finna become evil man..
🙁
"He's got big teeth"..."so do I"....is Peter gonna become Venom? And that's when he realizes it's turning him into a monster so he gets rid of it and then the symbiote transfers to Eddie?
Spider-man (God of thunder)
I came within 4 minutes
Dayum.... EXCITED TO PLAY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We’re not ready for how good this is gonna be…
The web of shadows like gameplay are strong here and I CANT WAIT to play this
PARRIES???? YOOOO
With all the choas that unfolded the averagers and shield may appear.
I wonder if this will get the "its basically DLC" treatment that zelda and God of war got
I wonder if we're going to see Harry, Wraith, and more of Black Cat.
Webs of shadows vibes 🕸️❤️❤️
homem ariranha n  voa
Well now I have to go buy a PS5
worst graphics.....not looking realistic at all
Kraven looks just like the WWE wrestler Elias lmfao
4 hours, 1 million views. Amazing
i think we're gonna be having a miles vs peter fight
Hope this game gets released soon cause my ps5 is collecting dust
Meh
Poetry in motion.
Why the graphics throws me back to Crysis 3 era.
Looks awesome ain’t nothing but hyped (as long as Peter doesn’t get killed of in this)  Yuri is definitely channeling is inner Sasuke for Venom Spider Man
love that Ganke has a more active role in this game, one of my favorite characters <3
Giving me prototype vibes
Why does it have to be ps5 ;n;
The new gameplay looks incredible
Game looks amazing pun intended. Saw some comments saying this looks like dlc or it didn't look any different then the first Spiderman game but it definitely looks better and improved from the first one.
I just really hope it'll be mainly peter story
I need this now!
IM EXCITED:D  LETS GOOOOOO!!!!
Also, the symbiote suit looks fantastic. And I don’t mean the effects when it is in use. I just mean what they did with what the material looks like. Looks better than any movie adaptation of the suit I’ve seen.
To anyone who’s reading this in the future, the wait was worth it!
im watching spiderman but im hearing sasuke
Jogo novo com cara de DLC welcome tô 2023
It’s been awhile Sasuke
OMFFGGGGGG
I like how they always managed to tie in several villains together in one story. Good stuff. Made the world feel alive rather than just villain of the week type trope.
The idea is just the same, I can't see anything new. I really don't find this game unique in any way. And what is wrong with the graphics and with the voice actors? 😔
The music sounds like something that would be played in D2
Ok….. I’m hyped🔥🔥🔥
Looking good. Just, way too many QTE's. This is gonna be a frustrating ride for poor old me. 😅
THE HYPE TRAIN IS HERE! GET ON BOARD!!
I am so excited to confirm that I am Kraven the Hunter
I'm really hoping that Eddie Brock will make an appearance
Hopefully, they will have a better combat system with more moves to learn
Peter Parker got that Sasuke in him
I NEED IT
Please have the black suit raimi skin
why does this remind me of the most dangerous game
i hope the graphics arent as bad as they are looking
11:32
A very linear gameplay, but I'm hoping this is an example of new linear missions in an open environment.
Now waiting for Wolverine Insomnia game
2:18   I haven't seen many people mention this, but it's very likely the house the henchmen are attacking is Peter's house.   Really adds to the intensity that they're attacking so close to home.
Slingshot webswinging and the wing suit, man traversing New York is going to be a lot better. I'm a bit worried not seeing the option to choose what you can swing off of, but maybe that's going to be there on release. I'll be warming up to play this, can't wait.
So far with him in the black suit he fights like alex mercer from prototype. It's hard to explain but if u know you should def be able to see what im saying
i wish .. this was a new Prototype game!
Reliving Spider-Man 3 on the PS2 with this version of Lizard 🥺💙
3:13 prototype vibes
I already know this will be game of the year 😮
Dude Miles is like seriously OP in this trailer!
When’s the game gonna get delayed?
Wow this looks amazing
is that little detail at the end with the Be Greater Together foreshadowing peter vs miles?
I’m hopefully waiting for PC release but this looks great!
perfect
I can't wait until this drops!
I saw the lizard
this is amazing
the way he saves the civilian at the end but just drops him on the floor and miles double checked if he was okay  you can tell the symbiote suit is really changing him
FINALLY! KRAVEN!
Это великолепно. Уже по такому маленькому геймплею видно то, как симбиот влияет на Питера, голос стал грубее, людей часто добивает, делая это намеренно(будто с некоторым удовольствием), момент, где он спас человека и просто швырнул его на землю, хотя раньше он такого не допускал.  Надеюсь, у  него будет поединок с Майлзом. Круто, что расширили карту, не только новые локации, но и те частные домики, это по идее целый отдельный район. Ящер будто бы слишком большой, но если честно - это афигенно. Ну и полеты с помощью так называемых крыльев - это имба, теперь можно будет не только с полетов на паутине кайфовать. Метро в 2х стало ненужным. В общем, безумно жду и надеюсь, на русскую локализацию.
Two black men
i really hope this makes its way to PC like the other 2 games did. as somebody without a Playstation
frr got me all O_O at those venom powers
0:00 hello and welcome to timed beta have a great viewing
This sequence is incredible and the people who created it should be proud of their work. What a fantastic representation of these classic characters!
i whipped it out
I can see peter vs miles in this game
Please let this be playable on ps4. I mean, without overheating and destroying the nearly 10 year old ps4. 😅
1:11 Kraven's expression of utter disgust is next level!  Insomniac showing they were made for this!!
I’m also super excited to announce that I’ve got to play this game already it’s amazing the first 10 mins about 🙏🏻
You can tell they are taking inspiration from old Spiderman games (Web of Shadows and Shattered Dimensions) edit - *AND I LOVE IT*
Omg this reminds me of wed of shadows and web wings yes yes yes yes
Any one else heard the intro like TLOR?
THE LIZARD!!!!!!! YESSS!!!!!!!!
This is crazy good
alright lets get some things clear this is venom and not spider-man I know spider-man had a black venom suit but it was never that well controlled unless some comics were different
yo peter parkers moves for venom is beyond crazy
Finally the best hero of Marvel is back
I was here aha!
Beautiful, absolutely Beautiful
Venom, Kraven, & Lizard...I need a PS5 soon so I can get this soon-to-be amazing sequel immediately!
The bully parker returns
Marvels Spider-Man 2 kravens nyc hunt
Someone’s gonna have dirt thrown in their eyes in this game
This game will be remembered for generations who agrees
I don’t own a ps5 and I’m not even really a spider man fan, but this looks incredible lmao
Peters aggression towards the whole trailer just reminds me of "COME BACK HERE SHOCKER, SHHOOOCCCKKKKEEEEEEEEERRRRRRR YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EEEEAAAARRRRRTTTHHHHH"
Omg
The black suit Kraven the Hunter I am so hyped for this game venom is going to be beating me up, but I don’t care. I’m gonna love the game anyways I wonder what alpha-2 gonna get I hope they give us back at one that black cat gave us. When will it be able to change into different suits and the venom symbiont will change also
Exaggerated swagger intensifies
Let’s gooooooo
great game-play, we're back boys and girls lol. The best thing coming from marvel now is this spider game series in my opinion.
I won't say why, but I'm in love with the lizard's design. Kraven also looks great, and I'm excited to see how he'll impact the game. And I cannoooooooooooooot wait to see how the symbiote story plays out. This game is gonna blow people away.
this is firrre 🔥
Oh boy, it’s gonna be *Web of Shadows* all over again.
Ambreesh Puri back to life as a villain
Miles vs venom Peter?
He got big teeth so do I…. Mf barrrrrr😂😂😂😂 aye whats like 3 more months and we finally get to play this badazz new spidey game
Why movies aren't like this? 😢
they are really trying to kill spiderman off to replace with with black spiderman.......you cant race swap spider man learn for the mistakes of race swaping.
Meanwhile, Xbox has great upcoming games such as. . . .
Now I just have to wait 4 years for it to come to PC.
Spider-Man Will Forever Be The GOAT 🐐
If they do the cliche where Spiderman becomes evil just because he uses the venom suit and he has to remove it, I am not buying the game.
I know everyone has probably already noticed it, but I'm still excited to see how Wraith is handled in the game.
It’s literally the same map as the last one?!?! This game gonna flop
Wonder if the Dev team got inspiration from web of shadows and spiderman 3 for the black suit combat
Bro sounds Sasuke 😂
When your big bro gets a new gf who's super toxic.
i expected better, absolute trash
The fighting in the beginning is super cool 😎👍
Who let marvel x playstation cook
This looks great
lol people will actually play this 😂
Look how Peter just tossed the civilian on the floor lmaooo
Yeah I’ll never speak on the internet again after this
👏🧐
the blue lightning is cool, bit i kinda likedthe yellow
When Miles said to Peter: "He's got big teeth." Peter replies: "So do I." Man, that part give me chills. This game is gonna be so awesome like the first game! Well done Insomniac!
Can't wait to play it on Steam Deck in 2028 ❤
Mark my comment I will return after 10 years to relieve some memories 😂 Marvel spider man 2 Be Greater Together I like the squirrel flying mechanics btw 😂
I like the gameplay but I feel like there’s a bit to much on screen. Maybe that’s just me
My only gripe is that they don’t seem to have improved the web slinging
beatiful
After a being disappointed constantly with the main comic series, this and Spider-verse are bringing me joy
Bully Pete and Morals Miles   The good cop and bad cop of superheroes
The way Peter tosses aside the pedestrian he saves like he doesn’t care about him, is a cool subtle nod to how venom is changing him
I just got a ps5 last Christmas...i still need Spiderman ps4 and miles edition 😂😂
Yes
You have a choice between Overpowered Miles Morales or Symbiote fueled Peter Parker.  This is going to be lit!
Yooooooo
This is what every game company should aspire to be by listening to there fans and taking there time to make an amazing game. Insomniac did an incredible job here and I can’t wait to experience this game.
Ill be waiting in pc
this game will be amazing wooow :)
If the game really plays like this on launch, then this is easily the best gameplay reveal trailer ever
I’m hard
It's absolute bs that this isn't on PS4. I'm not buying a new overpriced system just for one game.
My boys, they look so beautiful.
Black cat yes and love wraiths new suit.
Really looking forward to it, but they have to do something about the graphics and peter's venom suit...
Epic!
I predict we will have a fight agains Petter and Miles.
peter using venom's tendrils as a weapon gives me so much web of shadows vibes
This. Was. Peak.
We just ignoring the biggest spoiler in the game huh? I mean… we saw venom yes but… geez leave the rest of the intrigue for the game
I wish Venom showed his teeth when he said "so do I"
I dislike the new face, I just hope they aged him. Hopefully it’s not mid 20s Peter looking like a 15yr old
This is possibly the game im looking forward the most after jedi survivor
This is literally so sixk, can’t wait to play through it!!
as cool as it looks, im notreally excited to use miles, i want a spiderman peter parker only game please. i dont need miles swapping in and out..
😍
Are you kidding me?! Every part of this looks incredible. I was expecting good things after the first game and Miles Morales but this didn't miss in any aspect.
Oh poo
Why is symbiote Spiderman literally sasuke
Good things come to those who wait, we waited and this gameplay blew all expectations we had for it out the charts!
In a DECADE IT IS
LOVE that the developers aren't holding back and decided to showcase the symbiote right outta the gate. Matter of fact—their confidence shows that there is most certainly more to come. Love it.
We're gonna see miles vs peter in game i guess
it’s, it’s GLORIOUS🥹
goty?
Insomniac does it again!!! Great effin job!
It just seems so predictable, spider-man will go bad and then we will have to fight Venom as Miles. Please do not let this be a game you play as Miles 60% of the time
Here before the time flies and the game become nostalgia
Bro Pete's voice frightened me. If you will fight him using that symbiote he's really scary.~
I don't even have a PS5 and I will probably have to wait like 8-10 years to play it on pc but it looks like its going to be masterpiece. Congrats to all PS5 owners.
The black cat interaction gonna be toughy 😏
wow this does just proves me wrong and my friend right, miles morales spiderman was a cash grab DLC presented as a unique standalone
Black suit spider man and miles? Hell yeah
This is gonna be like living a dream while playing this!
Brought the sasuke out yuri
It's like 7 years the release of marvel's spider-man1  Karen is a nice villian  And peters ne symbeot suit is very nice I would love to see the legendery villian of spider-man of all time GREEN GOBLIN
“HES GOING TO WISH HE NEVER CAME TO NEWYORK!!!”
So cool!
1:34 🥶🔥 Kraven's going to hunt Tasky tooooo?
so they made a Spiderman skinned PROTOTYPE x GTAV x infamous second son 😂
Prototype feelings
This is the vibe we want from Kraven....🔥🔥🔥
PS4 port?
Let's hope its not a repeat of the water from last time lol i hope we get the game we see here off the bat
Literally everything in this trailer seems like an improvement on the first two. From movement to combat to story. This game is absolutely gonna slap when it releases, even if the story does turn out meh which that doesn't seem to be the case so far.
this game series will go down as a classic
I am so stoked!!!!
Peter Parker went from "I'm friendly neighborhood Spider-Man" to Peace was never an option real quick 😈
This game has a very big chance to win Game of the year, the first one was already awesome and this.... *This is something else*
Finally, Prototype 3! 😂
I want it now
Not gonna lie, seeing Peter Parker swing around with the exaggerated swagger of his black suit gave me goosebumps!
Yoo Kraven so OP that he be sending NPCs to Ragdoll animations in Cutscenes ☠️
The story and character depth in this 12 minute trailer is already way more polished and better than anything MCU has put out since endgame.
the spiderman games are dissapointing, once youve played one youve played them all. instead of focusing on story so much how about focus on innovation.
It’s nice to see miles , but I hope we have more chance to play like Peter and his new suit (venom) . It’s more cool play like a Spider-Man than miles.
4:59 An electric kamehameha into a mid air choke slam?! Dope af. Lol
Cannot wait till September, but also want to enjoy my last summer break after graduating
wow this is unreal
BULLY LOWENTHAL LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Hard opinion I kinda don’t like the way the suit operates with like tentacles just all over the place but omg this looks awesome I think I peed a little
Miles:- are you sure?! He's got big teeth Peter :- SO DO I !!! man the dialogues are just awesome
Honestly just looks like more of the same.
Not looking forward to flying but everything else- amazing. So excited
You guys really should've made the marvel avengers game
man that 11:54 detail make this game more awesome, his eye narrow with some of that venom expression.
3,11 ENVIORNMENTAL COMBAT OKAY I SEE YOU MARVEL
Water physics looks a little dodgy, but the wingsuit the launch mechanics and multi-opponent-sneak-takedowns... *chefs kiss*  And I know a lot of people expected it to be multiplayer, but having it be single-player co-op like in GTA looks fun, and maybe gives the user the option to solve missions how they'd like?  Now... I don't have a PS5, and Sony is hardly making any money from sales of thay anyway ...so... Yeah I'm looking forward for this to end up on PC's! Might have to wait a few years, but yeah... I will.
Well done, the character switch is all I wanted, but you delivered in so many other aspects and this is only our first official reveal of what's to come.  IM SCREAMING WITH EXCITEMENT YES YES YES YES YES
If Marvel Spider-Man 2 is this good I can only imagine what Marvel wolverine will be
wow…..this looks phenomenal
This game is looking awesome. Even the Lizard's design looks so good. All the action is here like how I expect it to be. Can't wait to get this game.
Doesn’t this bond between miles and Peter feel so natural
Better than a movie😮
This is the moment we all been waiting for!
angry peter just sound likes sasuke. i'm aware that it's the same voice actor but can't un hear it
I can see this building into a moment around the end of the second act where Peters about to kill Kraven and Miles stops him, then you play as Miles fighting Peter or maybe switch between them both during the fight. Miles will probably turn his back on Peter after that until they gotta team up again to take down Venom
At least this Peter cares about Harry dying from a horrible disease…
Peter definitely gonna be one of the final bosses
Did I see Deadpool in the tablet Kravens henchman was showing him?
Peter is gonna be a boss fight for sure
Eh not a big fan of the black suit tbh. Looks plain but aside from that everything else was incredible
Dude, I think they’re gearing up for Peter to be the final boss fight.
omg i'm so excited for Kraven. dude is a beast
That's not Peter Parker, that's Sasuke Uchiha
I'm excited for this game! Although I find it weird the black suit's eye doesn't move?
I did NOT want that to end. 12 minutes went by like that. What can I say. This was absolutely unreal. Kraven’s design looks sick! The black suit looks very primal and raw and alive. Yuri Lowenthal’s phenomenal voice acting gave me ‘Shocker, I’ll chase you to the ends of the Earth’ vibes. The gameplay, especially the chase sequence had me on edge. The Lizard looks huge and a proper threat. Resident Evil croc vibes. I mean there’s a lot more but I won’t be able to finish. I’m beyond excited for this.
holy shiiiiii I’m so excited for this game. The details for Symbiote suit, the gameplay quality, literally everything. Absolutely stunning and so hyped to be able to play
I think at some point in the story, Miles will have to fight Peter to get the symbiote out of Peter's body.
Amazing
Why. Can’t a character like Kraven ever be the protagonist.
I'm not sure if I like this new stylized look. The first game and even the Miles spinoff went for more realism, but this has a cartoon-ish look to it. I'll have to wait to see more of this, but right now, I'm feeling disappointed with it.
Kraven is hot bear
Man I can sense the painful parts. Im really hype for this though. They did symbiote peter well so far.
Just call it Spider-Men
Omg yuri as wraith look awesome, even though not sure if the slingshot mile did will be in the game, the game looks terrific nevertheless.
I really hope it have multiplayer features
6:40 I love the scene when Peter comes crashing in. The ominous tone of the music when the tendrils are display out and retract are perfect!
Aggressive, aggressive, agressive!!!               Feature me!
Yeah, this looks like what a sequel should be
.
I do hope that once the game is beaten you can switch between the black suit and the normal suit
Listen how Spider-Man have no jokes no quirky remarks no quips unlike miles Spider-Man game you heard him making jokes while fighting rhino bro this game gone be good
I just hope we are given the option of picking which spider-man we wanna play as at least outside of specific missions. I love MM but I give me symbiote suit spidey all day long please!
Web of shadow nostalgic
Bro, this look fire
this is beautiful
I can see that Viktor Reznov became a hunter after Vorkuta
ok, im going to buy a ps5 now
Yep selling my Xbox tomorrow , PS5 and Spiderman here I come 🎉
This looks absolutely amazing!!
Insanely cool
watching this knowing i won’t be able to play the game anytime before 2029
Bully Pete: *Throws civilian* 11:32  Miles “Morals”: WTF BRO 😂
This trailer is AMAZING! Pun intended, I'm so glad that we don't have to see no more clickbait fan-made stuff and instead the real deal. I'm going to have so much fun playing with symbiote Peter
Kraven the hunter😮😮
As great as this game looks, I really miss the time when each new installment of the series used to feel like a generational leap.   I guess they made it more ray-traced, and the speed of traverse is increased, but it is still very much Marvel's Spider Man 1 for me.  I still remember how each new GTA looked and felt astonishing after the previous one.   Though, the current graphics level really takes much more time to get to the true next-gen then it used to in 2000-s. And the risk of rebuilding and remaking all assets for the new part, completely rethinking and revision the series each time far outweighs any benefits in modern game dev.  Understandable but sad.
I get the feeling we'll all be back here.
This is lookin GOOOOOOD
Good lord, spider man just ENDED that man's bloodline 3:09
Can't wait for this game. Playing Miles and Peter in the same game. Come on. That's pretty cool. And Peter has the venom symbiote attached to him!
I love how slimy the symbiote looks
*Spoiler Alert*       Spiderman and Venom will live happily together forever
LETS GOOO
A living suit on Peter Parker look at his eyes 🫠 Venom is eating him up
NO WAYYYYY
CAN'T WAIT!!!  To watch youtuber play this game Bcs i dont have any money to buy it or console or pc that not blow up when i play this
Are we going to ignore the fact that the lizard looks insane?
They should make a Easter egg for bully mcguire
THIS IS GOAT
I player both games I can't wait for this one I love playing Spiderman games!!
They keep using their real names tho.
Looks amazing as expected, but I'm not a fan of the wing suits...
OMGGGG THIS IS THE GAME OF YEAR
INSOMNIAC DO A STARWARS GAME!
I don’t even have a PS5 yet but I’m ready to make the investment, like if you can relate🤔
Oh man ! Even though I don't own a playstation or pc , but still excited for this masterpiece to release 🤩
oh i am so buying this game
the main thing i hated about the first game was the MJ segments, if those are non existent in this game this game could be perfect
bruh its already out?? time flies😭
i hope they give a story on how peter got that venom suit
The deep voice, the mood and the brutality in the fight. LITERALLY PERFECT
Who did Kraven kill?
Im commenting this so I can find it again in 10 years
Who is watching this in 2025?  P.S. I am from the future
This looks so good I’m so excited to play this
Looked like Assassin's Creed at first 😂
Xbox we are waiting for your response
I love how they made miles seem like the more smarter n responsible spiderman in this game
Really looking forward to this - especially now that I've finally managed to visit NYC. Nice that we get to visit other parts of the city as well. I'm just dreading fighting endless hordes of goons again - hopefully that part won't get too old too quickly, it got a bit jaring for me in the previous games.
🔥
Kraven acts alone. He dont have bandits
Web of shadows 2 ?!?!?!
This symboite suit looks classic look just like comic accurate
I’m glad they are taking an uncharted 4 cinematic approach. I know a lot of people hate interactive cinematic parts, but I like them.
Bully Maguire is on!!!!!
Well this just looks bloody fantastic, symbiote spiderman.
take my money. take it
These takedowns are fire 🔥
I love you all ISNT THIS AMAZING
GOTY
I’m getting HUGE Web of Shadow Black Suit vibes from this🔥🔥🔥
You guys think this is an adaption of Kraven’s last hunt?
You hear the rage behind pete
They really should give Miles another identity besides Spider-Man. It's kind of ridiculous since with Pete around in the same universe and still going by Spider-Man, it makes zero sense that Miles wouldn't take on another name besides that so that he can have his own unique identity a la Nightwing in the Batman comics. It's basically asking for Miles to be in Peter's shadow forever by having him go by Spider-Man as well.
The huds on the bottom look way to close to the center of the screen, they should be closer to the corners
my vote for the most beautiful game with the ugliest UI
Q buena adaptacion de personaje
in some lines aggressive peter sounds like matpat lolllllllllllll
Amazing can’t wait to play!
If I even see or hear screwball in this game. Imma turn into bully McGuire
Prototype 3 gameplay reveal
Alright I’m ready to go broke.
New York looks so much more alive, I love it
There were people in the buildings…
web of shadows 2
It sounds like Peter actually snapped
I feel like they could’ve gone for something bigger than dr conors…. Hes the lamest villain out there. Also tasm 2 was about fighting conors…
MCU can only dream of being like this
AT THE END 12:15 THE SYMBIOTE COVERS THE TITLE IN SPIDEY RED AND MILES ELECTRIC POWER SHOCKS IT OFF!! MILES SAVES SPIDERMAN. srry caps lock was stuc
Ngl this looking game of the year worthy just from gameplay
atleast the people on the boat got a face change, they truly listened to fans.
If I’m being honest. I didn’t think they could surprise me with new swinging mechanics but they somehow impressed me by innovating in ways I wasn’t even expecting. This game looks like it’s gonna be loads of fun to maneuver the open world and especially in combat!
yuri lowenthal has gone through over a decade of voicing sasuke to prepare for symbiote peter and it's perfect. im so excited for this game
what kind of name is ganke? sounds like a bad smell
Fukin lit!!
Yeah I’m not so sure Kraven and his team would be able to get their aircraft into the middle of Queens much less land it in a neighborhood, especially not after post-9/11 security measures in New York
is that sasuke??
Incredible stuff, it’s like prototype….but it’s Spider-Man
Do we have a release date?
Tbh am i the only one who doesnt  like the venom version i would rather have miles as the main character, i know he already had his own game but hes the more entertaining and exciting person the normal spider man wouldn’t have thrown that civillian to the ground and at the end miles talks about how hes never like that i wish he would have been the normal spider man with his Robin miles morales
This the going to be harder than gta 6 😈
I hope they include the corrupted Spider Man spontaneously dancing in the streets!
kraven!
El hombre… que araña
insomniac just casually creating a marvel gaming universe in front of our eyes
Can't wait to see bully McGuire y PS5!
now this.... DOES put a smile on my face
See you all in 10 years where we will all talk about the memories this game gave us
Spiderman has the worst villains
Miles was essentially flying. That's dope
Great work
why do i have a feeling we're gonna fight pete as one of the boss fights. awesome.
Insomniac and Marvel: GOATS.
Leaving this comment for future 😃
Una obra de Arte Spiderman, me gusto muchísimo el primero, la verdad hasta ahorita lo contínuo jugando 😅😅, espero el segundo con ansias ❤
*Cue the Christopher Young Black suit theme*
GAMING IS BACK!!!!! 🤲🤲🤲🤲
There is no point in movies now. This is better than anything you would see in theaters. Well done insomniac.
Is the lizard in this game?
did he wingsuit away at the end
it literally makes 0 sense to not put it out with pc on release too if it's gonna come to pc after like the others. You get more sales, and more reach. Calling it a ps exclusive is fine if it's actually never gonna come to pc but when the others ones did, you might as well just launch it with pc too so you get better launch day sales
Im so glad they are adding Harry Osborn in some way. He mentioned how only Connors can save Harry
All I hear is Sasuke
Peter’s and Miles relationship is gonna be like Batman & Robin’s relationship in the game. We all know how rude and dismissive Batman was towards Robin.
I like how the symbiote makes him more dismissive and aggressive, but it also shows how it clouds his judgment, and miles is the one saving him and making more "heroic" acts... they're definitely going to fight
It looks so amazing!
OMG Prototype!
I think I coomed
Do we know if it’s multiplayer yet ?
FALL 2023?! THIS MEAN TOK HAS COMPETITION!
Good stuff *clap* *clap* *clap*
ABSOLUTELY CRISPY , ATE AND LEFT NO CRUMBS
What horrible graphics, is that all?
Are we going to see Bully Maguire?
So many games, so little money. 😢
It’s finally happening
This shows that Spider man Web of Shadows was better than people thought back then
L
The ememies really know how to advertise this game "Watch out for his new powers!" LOL
QUE LOCURAAAaa
ITS SOO GOOD. ITS ALL I WANTED UGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGH. the tendrils being that prototype esque is remarkable. I love how alive the suit design is.
Its better have the purple Ultimate Costume
Take my money.
THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING OMG
I am 100% buying a PS5 just to play this game! 🔥🔥 looks so much better than I even wanted it to 🤩
The new gameplay mechanics, especially the traversal, had my jaw on the floor
Pete being sasuke
They need to release this on PC for the love of god. I can't wait 4 years
THE DECISION TO GIVING INSOMNIAC THE RIGHTS TO MAKE A SPIDERMAN GAME WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER!!!!! CANT WAIT!
Black suit spiderman is so awesome 😮😮😮😮
Finally the sequel to my favorite Spider-Man movie and based on this clip I know it won’t disappoint! Can’t wait!
Three words: HYPE TRAIN BABY!!!!!  So glad we got to see some gameplay, so stoked for this! And symbiote suit!!! Bring on the hype!! Looks like it's a tough GOTY for me between this, FF16 and Assassin's Creed Mirage so far!
Not gonna lie I am not looking forward to losing the Symbiote, Spider-Man + Venom is a certified Avengers Level Threat and I bloody live for that, also happy to see Ganke playing a bigger role.
COME BACK HERE KRAVEN, KRAVEEENNN-
I havent been this hyped about a game in years! Now i have this and Assassins Creed Mirage to look foward to!!
I want all of the future action figures...
Could I play this on ps4?
I hope we have to fight against Pete with the symbiote suit on. I have a feeling we will!
This gives me so many web of shadows vibes and I love it
Wow here i was thinking "oh nice a new map!" 😐
Like
CANT WAIT!!!
Absolutely incredible. Insomniac the goats
I wanna be the cool black spider man, not the black miles Morales
Peter sounds like sasuke
Imagine if Stan Lee could see this😩
Kraven’s Last Hunt vibes!😮
The symbiote gameplay feels like an honest to god homage to Ultimate Spider Man’s Venom. I’m *loving it*
would be better if the cut scenes played out in the game
Looks a little lame tbh. More of the same with better graphics. Doesn't feel fresh enough to be worth the wait... just my opinion though.
this is soo goood! could watch this all day!!
Spider man kinda tweakin out bro buggin
🦇
This reminds me of prototype
I wonder why Miles' electricity is blue here, not the usual orange/
Sick
Noticed English Sasuke Uchiha voice as Peter Parker immediately. Good stufffff
Amazing😊
I hope Eddie Brock in this game
THE HYPE!!!!!
I wonder is miles is next
AYO THE WAY SPIDEY CAME UP OUT OF THAT SHED WAS CRAZZYYYYYY!!!! I RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AND CAME BACK TO THE VIDEO LIKE “y’all just gone deliver it to me like that???” This is CLASS A MATERIAL RIGHT HERE!!!  The wait is over my comrades👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
imma bata bussss
COME ON! This is BLOODY AMAZING!!! Looks absolutely promising af!!!
This is so sick, Spider-Man 3 is the game that got me into video games and this is that on steroids
Peter need to break free from the Symbiotic
If this game has a pizza delivery minigame its literally 11/10 game of the decade
The symbiote suit gameplay is definitely reminiscent of Web of Shadows 🫡
PECHO!?
Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always loved you Insomniac… thank you for everything you’ve done and will continue to do
Insomniac knows how to make a sequel. Maybe I'm a bit biased, since Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage was my first-ever video game, but still.
Genuinely love how chaotic and spiteful Peter is with the symbiote without it being too much, also love Lizard's design a lot!.
Only complaints. I am kinda over the whole army of minions wearing X color with 4 model times,  kraven alone would have been nice. Also Peter isnt always aggressive in the black suit that's more of a cartoon/ game thing. That being said can't wait!
IM GOING TO LOVE HOW PETER AND THE SYMBIOT RELATIONSHIP GROWS IN THIS GAME ❤
This may just be what I need to buss
Looks really good.  Too bad I don’t play games anymore
Please tell me Peter doesn't still look like Tom Holland
the details are dope Peter didn’t even try to save those civilians at 11:02
I love how Peter sounds super aggressive due to the symbiote; the VA did a great job
KRAVEN looks badass and so does the lizard!!! Main reason why Spider-Man is one of the all time greats - because so many of his villain's are just as badass as him!!!
Is it me, or does Kraven look like Edgar Ramirez?
A bully Peter Parker again
Wheres the og venom suit Tobey wore ?
Please Don't change anything INSOMANIAC in MARVEL'S SPIDERMAN 2. You changed everything in MARVEL'S SPIDERMAN 2016 E3 gameplay. E3 gameplay was good earlier.😁😁😁
So exciting, and that was only 12 minutes of the action just imagine what more there is to do!
The symbiotes combat is absolutely absurd. Hopefully theirs more suits option for it,  this suits design is a little too much.
If you are here 7 years later just know this game is taking a long while to come out and it’s probably so worth it
'He has BIG teeth..so do I'
MUITO FODAAAAAA!!!!!!
Spider-Man dlc
Spider man 3 game vibes
How did we get this before a hint of Wolverines gameplay!?
Miles: He’s never like that   Peter: Gonna cry ?
game of the year incoming
This is incredible!
"Some point, I just stopped pulling my punches. I got rageful. I got bitter." - The turning point for every spider man.
The final fight is gonna be miles vs Peter/Venom
I legit might buy a PS5 just for this game
I LOVE the way the symbiote suit seems to perfectly compliment Peter's fighting style. His basic moves are all the same but the symbiote expands on it and really makes it feel more like a power up, adding its own stylistic flairs that are clearly more aggressive than Peter's standard repertoire
Web of shadow vibes,  i cant wai t
Guys we might see Yuri back. When the Kraven henchman is showing him New York, he is showing a bunch of villains and heroes including “Wraith” who is Yuri Watanbe
4:21 the enemies didn’t hear that drone drop 30ft from them?
This looks even better than I was imagining. On my god I can’t wait
Peter really let his inner Sasuke out on this one
This is one of the best gameplay reveals I've ever seen! The black suit and the move set are so badass!
Slingshot is back?   Let's goooo
Aight I'm hoping we get a slam. I don't need another bayonetta 3.
I do hope they're keeping Harry as Venom and don't cop out to the Eddie fans. I like that this is a different take. Stick to it.
The most exciting part of this was seeing Spider-Man swim 🤯
I'm really looking forward to this game, I'm already hyped with what we've seen, venom, kraven, lizard, and harry
Can’t wait
Am I the only one who’s not a fan of robots as bad guys we need to fight. I prefer just normal people and not crazy over the top robots or those blue power having men from Spiderman 1. Just normal people with guns and that’s it. And yes the main villains should be whatever they are. But I don’t like it when there’s weird unrealistic robots or demons in the streets of New York.
He's got big teeth... So do I..
Let’s fuxking gooooooo
Looks amazing 🤩
BROOOOOOOO
It's confirmed, JJ Olatunji will be the next Spiderman.
*Meh.*
Spider man 2 v Jedi: Survivor game of the year it’s gonna be tough
Man I’m hyped idk what to say
First bully maguire now bully lowenthal
oh my god.. thank you.
R.I.P Microsoft
Game looks fantastic but the UI looks awful 😩
you bastards did it again huh :,)
Can’t believe after it was uploaded, it got millions of views instantly, it’s because the new movie coming out, Spider-Man being in Fortnite, and the original and Miles Morales ( including No Way Home ) puts a smile to all of us.  🕷️  Thanks Disney and Sony.
That launch gave me Spider-Man 3 vibes. Y’all remember on top of the daily bugle you could launch yourselves off the building???
I always love it when Peter is just utterly pissed off
Why am I seeing so many people on TikTok say Peter is gonna be the big bad when its so obvious he’ll loose the symbiote at some point to Eddie most likely 😭
Symbiote Peter's voice reminds me of some ninja... Hidden Leaf I think...
Sasuke was great
Enough said, love this trailer, 🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️, can’t wait for this game to come out 👀🤘🏽🕸️
One thing I hate about the symbiote lately in the movies and this game. He didn’t have “tentacles” and all that stuff in the comics!!!! He shot white webs and was stronger. Venom didn’t use tentacles either. Carnage did!!
Everything is great except graphics it's the same
the game looks amazing. but, same mechanics as the first game which shows me no reason for it to be just ps5 only when it can be for both ps4 and ps5.
W
The dialogue is so corny at times
I love this arrogant version of Peter he's amazing 🔥
This gameplay gives me so much of Uncharted 4 vibes
This looks insane! Game of the year
🏆🏆🏆game of this year
T-T
I’m here to gladly say that I was here to witness this before it’s time to be presented to world happens
Looks great
Everyone: giving a detailed description on the look and characterization  Me: “BRO THEY GOT WEB WINGS LETS GOOO!”
Black Suit looks like a fan mod
In some way I feel proud that there is gonna be a game serious to remind us of the Arkham series, and with one of marvels most popular hero spiderman, insomniac does not fail to disappoint
Wow blow my mind🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤮🤮🤯🤯
This is so awesome ❤ can’t wait to get on it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤟
If we don't get a Miles vs Peter fight, that will be a MASSIVE let down.
This game could be huge with all ifs offering. Looks real good
Can't wait for Tony Todd as Venom
See you all in 10+ years when I’m showing my kids this game was one of the biggest games of our time
Looks like I’m Pre-Ordering two games this fall. This, and Mortal Kombat 1.
god i hope we can keep the symbiote suit post game
Looking good so far
3:33 When spiderman becomes gta 😂 and becomes super hero game instead of crimes
I really hope we get a "I'm going to put some dirt in your eye" line from Peter 😂
I hope this comes out on ps4. Please insomniac
omg slingshot!!!!
Kraven I know this is your story but Venom is the bigger threat here....and the lizard Wich is really cool to see 😁
A moment of silence for people that don’t have the ps5😔
This looks amazing
We... are excited
Need it
Just imagine carnage in this game lol
Prototype/Prototype 2 vibes anyone? From the tendrils
Dayum
Looks like it's going to be so much fun, I can't wait to plat this just like the first two games.
Paused right at 11:54 you can see the small glimpse at the venom eyes. I live how the suit is making him more aggressive.
I smell Spider-Man 3
they better relecs this on pc
he went full sasuke voice bro, crazy
If they also release this on PC, then instant 10/10. If not, then we raise the Black Flag once more YOHOHO
Game of the year
So exited like THIS is the game iv been waiting for PETER and MILES look amazing the gameplay looks fire
They totally understood the reference material even more so than Sony and dare I say Marvel Movies did. I'm totally hyped for this game even if it's just to see how the story unfolds.
All that muscle just for a lunatic man hunter to choke you with his bare hands.
Can't believe it's official.
he may find his equal in the beyonder. ☠️☠️☠️☠️
THIS IS AMAZING, all the designs for the characters, the graphics, the symbiote, the web slingshot move from the raimi games and films, my god insomniac! Y'all cooked this just right
Just excellent!
Melhor presente por passar na OAB, foi hoje kendão do futuro
The perfect trailer doesn't exist  Meanwhile in 2023:
I am SO happy I saw this during the event AND happy I finished BOTH spider man games~ Cannot WAIT for this one!
Insomniac has the opportunity to do one of the funniest things ever
1:27 WE ARE GETTING WRAITH!! YURI IS COMING BACK!!
Oh muyyyy let’s gooo
See y’all in a decade I’m hyped
Meu Deus
This sounds cheesy but I hope they reference Spiderman 3 by making Symbiote Spidey say "I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye" before he faces a boss enemy.
my theory will be that at the end miles has to beat the venom out of parker so they can together beat kraven because kraven will also have superpowers
Miles was sickkkk!!! Basically Raiden with those venom powers!!!!
See you in 9 years when someone wants to relive memories of this game
See you in 5 years when Spider-Man 3 comes out
Best game of the year, I don't care
I’m already so worried for Miles
I have never been more hyped for a game to come out. The sybiote gameplay is insane AND THEY ACTUALLY ADDED THE WINGS??
Am i the only one thats excited to see the lizard?
Lets goo
It’s insane how many candidates there are for game of the year now, hogwarts legacy, Jedi survivor now this
This boutta be game of the year
It looks amazing omg
Glad they brought miles back
I’m so fu**ing excited for this game
GOTY already
I was here
Bro this looks so crazy i'm so glad what they did with it cant wait for it to come out!!
bully Lowenthal
now i´m just waiting for the anime folks make some tokyo ghoul op with peter in the symbiote.
Is it me or is voice actor of Sasuke Uchiha from Naruto voicing as peter park 😶
Awesome I can’t wait
Ughhhh not one hundred percent into the symbiotic texture but the gameplay is awesome none the less
Is it just me or is it that black suit Spider-Man and Miles Morales are like a version of Batman and Robin the Dynamic Duo
Let’s go!!!
can it be played on ps4?
Even though he'll more than most likely lose, I really hope we get a boss fight with miles fighting peter to to bring him back to the good side.
calling it, peter vs miles fight at the end after kraven
Awesome  gameply
Looks Spectacular, Amazing. Clearly superior to the first. I’m astonished.
Sasuke?
Yo this looks like they went back to the spider man 3 game for ideas, symbiote spider man, kraven, lizard, lizard growing in size, venom... all that to say I'm still excited lol
To those in 2027 who want to revisit this game. Take my word, this game was the bomb back in my era.
Oh mane I’m hyped for it
So do I? I was expecting "So do We..." 😄 looks dope
Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😱
YESSSSIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIII
calling it now, you definitely gonna fight peter as miles cause of the venom powers 😮‍💨
That ain’t Spider-Man that’s Venom!!!!
Peter looked and sounded pissed at everyone. It's so amazing. I wish I had a ps5 cause this is everything I want in a game
Just like spider man 3
Kraven the hunter 😮
Beautiful can’t wait to play
Yup
See u soon insomniac just make another awsome spidey game ❤😮😮😮😊
This is incredible
Black Spider-Man suit and Miles is so OP in this game 😭😭😭
Bruh we got this🎉 see you guys in 10 years
Nice spiderman  game except for the ps3 level graphics and no ragdoll physics
Wow can’t wait
If there isn't a "SHOCKER!" Easter egg while we're in Symbiote Suit I'll cry.
Peter is more of a Sasuke right now... AND I'M ALL FOR IT!!!
I hope Pete retains his full arsenal back in the first game. Once the symbiote is off him just having 4 active gadgets wouldn't have the same gameplay as when he had double the resources and his suit power
1:27 was that 2nd picture Deadpool?
Im glad they made the combat with the symbiote similar to web of shadows.
11:56 “See ya, chump!”
Is that Dane DeHaan voicing symbiote spidey?
not as good as morbius
Woah 🤯
Amazing :)
Kraven is a pretty great character. This is a pretty cool concept and the footage shown is great. Lets hope the game itself is just as good if not better
Now I want a PlayStation 😢
0:33  Dam bros jacked
Just started to go back to the first game. Can’t wait for this man.
More proof why Yuri Lowenthal is the best voice of Spider-Man
naaaaah dem kicks at 3:10 were definitely personal😮
Dude the graphics looks worse than marvels spiderman 😢
I just wanted to see Venom 🙁
Comments full of bots lol
They definitely took inspiration from web of shadows  for the symbiote combat
Miles and Peter are definitely going to have a fight
I’ll buy a ps5 just to play this. It looks unreal sheesh
Holy crap.
They have improved EVERYTHING, set pieces look awesome, Kraven looks and sounds dope! Can’t wait!
Okay, if green goblin does not appear in this one, then Marvel Spider-man 3 is cooking some SECRET stuff
That was a 🔥 trailer. At some point in the game we're definitely going to have to play as Miles for a fight against Peter because of the symbiote. He wasn't mean to Miles here but later in the game Peter's aggression is going to eventually grow to the breaking point. I am definitely looking forward to the fight...
Spiderman is an absolute menace
If this isn’t on ps4 I’m gonna get mad
Only see the water hahaha
Here as a GAME OF THE YEAR checkmark ✅ 🎉
Hope to see connors with white coat on him with spikes popping out of it❤
That no he’s never like that, hit being a kid and seeing spider man 3 I know how’ this is going down.
Wow dude this looks insane incredible amazing spectacular the black symbiote was awesome the tendrils looked great amazing job Insomniac.
My sister did the lighting for this game! I'm super proud of her.
slowdown in a few of the cutscenes but looks fun.
This is where the fun begins
GOTY contender from the gameplay reveal already! Great job Insomniac!
fun fact to anyone who doesn't know how the symbiote works:   It amplifies aggression and negative traits like Anxiety, but its not doing it cause it's evil, its doing it cause it believes these traits will protect its host, the symbiote cares deeply for peter in most media and in some actively is trying to make him more money to look after his aunt/family
Everything’s good except they don’t explain how he got the venom symbiote suit
O Bhai
The way the souless eyes of the black suit ripple is Amazing (no pun intended at first)
I’m definitely getting this
Love how ruthless he is with the suit and can’t wait to see how he gets out of it and how it goes to Eddie eventually.
.
One thing that so sick is that they have gliders. I’m gonna have so much fun web slinging even more🤩🤩
I didn't get to play first one unfortunately.
new hud looks clean  and the sybiote suit looks just as clean. the takedowns for stealth also reminds me of spider man shattered dimensions ones. lizard also looks badass
i wonder if we'll get an introduction how peter obtained the symbiote. or will this just be a thing of like "oh he has it now, cool"
When symbiote Spiderman started brawling I thought he was gonna say “Chidori” for some reason…
BRO THIS IS MAJESTIC, Peter’s character development with symbiote is amazing, lenses are a bit off but I think they gon fix that, also miles is a far better spiderman than before, I can’t sleep rn Im so excited
Miles with the zappy kame-hame-ha :) 5:00
My mouth has dropped with excitement can't wait
graphics are not as good as expected
Can someone tell me what kraven can even do?
"So do I." Love Yuri's voice acting
Insomiac is the king of PS games. Especially spider man.
why so low resolution ? (1080p) ??
new gen, finally, welcome
It’s perfect. Everything I’ve wanted from a Spiderman game.  The expanded powers looks phenomenal. The black suit Spiderman looks appropriately alien. Peter’s behavior and demeanor are perfect.  Even when he saves the civilian at the end of the trailer, he just throws him onto the rooftop carelessly.  Game of the year for me.
Game of the year already.
Details like the one in the end where Peter just tosses the guy he saved, those details are what makes characters feel real.
Oh my god, miles with the Zappy Pops is so dope. And Pete with the venom symbiote. Gawddddd.
Lol looks sick
🐴
“I’m gonna put some dirt in your eye.”
Reminds me of the Uncharted 4 Madagascar chase, just so much going on and it doesnt let up
bro he sounds like the web of shadows Spider-Man.
Amazing 👏
Did anyone else get Destiny vibes from the music?
Mano, esse traje tá muito feio , sem textura, SLA ,ficou estranho Esse bagui de voar tbm ta meio estranho
I love the way they made Symbiote Spider-Man drop that guy at 11:30 Normal Spiderman would make sure he lands on his feet and well
The gameplay looks awesome! The combat is amazing! The dynamic between Peter and Miles is perfect and the villains look sooo badass! This is the Spider-Man game we've been waiting for! But man I'm worried what's gonna happen to Peter at the end
Can't wait for the horribly optimized PC release that the community will fix
i hope this also comes to PC like spiderman and miles morales did
The symbiot fighting style is so unhinged. It looks like Peter was trying to kill them and I love it so much cause it works so well
Yeah... this is going to be unbelievably amazing
Spidey never wore the symbiont as Venom!
I have a feeling that Peter is gonna become a boss fight cuz of Venom
Please remind me of this comment every year
Ok who else wants to see a Miles vs Venom Spiderman fight and then a Peter Miles vs Venom fight
Wow
“he has big teeth” “so do I”  I can’t wait to see venom 😏
YES!! The black suit BABY!
as stoked as i am for this game, Sony needs to give us a limited edition console to coincide with Spider-Man 2 because i've yet to be convinced that i need to make the jump to the current gen
Toby migure spider man is back baby
I really don’t like the gliding cus imo web swinging is perfect and the new ui just looks too messy otherwise I love it
Actually want now. Like... Now. Please.
OH GOD
If there’s a black guy as the main character I’m not buying it,
They really need to make the combat flow seamlessly between both suits like in Web Of Shadows.
Miles will indeed be the one to stop Pete.
They added everything we wanted in this game. Web wings, fast swins, new combos, just everything bro and theres more to it
I am so psyched!! We got Kraven, the Lizard, and Venom!! Venom Spider-Man seems aggressive like any version of him. I wonder if he'll get to turn into Venom, and did Dr. Conners have both arms when we saw him in Mile Morales? I can't remember!
Please tell me i can play it un ps4
Is Peter stuck as a symbiote ?
LETS GOOOOO
marvel is the best
THIS IS INSANE BOYSSSSS❤
Prototype 3
i hadnt even played the 1st one but this one seems cool
Is that DP!! No way
THIS IS SO PERFECT!
Marvel and Insomniac need to be looking at the success of Spiderman 1, Miles Morales and soon-to-be Spiderman 2 and thinking... and thinking about doing a game for another couple of heroes in the next few years. Hopefully, that is the case with Wolverine etc. Cause if they keep the games with Insomniac it will be a smash hit. Daredevil, Deadpool you name it. This can work, big time!
Kraven hunting lizard? Is this a Spiderman 3 the video game reference?
So miles is coming to spiderman movies
this is the best game of 23
Peak
Miles vs Peter boss fight , im calling it now .
PS Players you guys are really lucky after few years we pc players also can enjoy this masterpice
I hope they add symbiote quips
this game will be sad for sure
What a soundtrack reference
That lizard almost looks prehistoric
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
Xbox take notes. This how you make an exclusive
Bruh...👀
Ngas can’t tell me spider man is the best but yet evenly balanced hero to make games and movies from
YAS!
I wish if insomaniac made all the Marvel games
That was so cool can't wait for this to drop.
12:19 Love the little detail where the symbiote tries to cover the Together part to imply they don’t need Miles, but his electricity shocks it away.
Loving the symbiote gameplay!
Bruh the fact that we're getting this AND spiderverse 2 in the same year is just wild, its too good to be true. You almost think that the two teams planned it 😆. What a great time to be a spiderman fan
lame
SOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOODDDDD
The symbiote combat really reminded me that we need another prototype game
Mabey you’ll have to play has miles morales and defeat peter
BULLY MAGUIRE RETURNS,LETS GOOOO.😎
This is all I’ve ever wanted from this series. Venom suit 🤠🤠🤠
The Symbiote combat gives me STRONG web of shadow's vibes and that...  puts a smile on my face.
I'm sensing a Batman Arkham deal here where each new game is gonna play cooler and cooler then one day you go back to the first one and think "wow this game is still really cool but I hate that I can't use *insert 3 separate revolutionary game mechanics that made the franchise the powerhouse it is*?"
YouTube comments is so different than Instagram lol Instagram community is so toxic
Kraven, Venom, Lizard. Game looks amazing
the minimap looks so bad. pls change it
5:01 Miles ain't slick 😭 Using the same move Spider man 2099 used to viciously chock-slam him with. 😩🙏🏾
sad that this wont be a coop game lol. two spidermams seems perfect
out of all the shitty titles that we have to endure over the years. I couldn't believe my eyes that we're getting this level of quality.
Peter: "Let's go Miles"  Miles: "Yes sir, master Parker"  💀💀💀
I like how the HUD is different between Miles and Peter.
Aaahh yes, the lubed spiderman
I see the overdramatic acting choices for symbiotic spiderman is still in fashion lol
This got a 1 million views in 3 hrs! Greatness
Miles shouldn’t be here.. gimme a full Peter Parker game please
HYPE
Finally Peter Parker won't needed web-shooter at all😂
2:57 :👀
I’m excited already can’t wait for this game to come out. And also hello people of the future. This game was good wasn’t it?
Venomized Peter moves is visibly more brutal than before and than miles
I can’t breathe this is true art 🔥
VENOM AND LIZARD TWO OF MY FAVORITE MARVEL CHARACTERS!!!!
This is amazing u can see the symbiote  progressively change the more the story goes his eyes change and the symbiote is moving as well this is going to be amazing
That camera action is insane! This will be the game of the year. Easily.
FIRE
If we don't get Peter Parker dancing, I'm docking a point off 😂 🕺
It’s not quite what I wanted the symbiote to be originally in this universe but it looks really cool
Game of the mf Year
А че так плохо выглядит? И почему интерфейс в начале обрезан, вы на мобилку что ли снимали, для презентации???
Make it available on ps4 🙏🏻!!!
WOOOOOAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Sir:How many times how you watched this  Me: yes
Amazing...
"LIZARD U CANT ESCAPE ME ILL CHASE U TO THE ENDS OF THE EAAAAAARRTH"
All i can think about when seeing "Gameplay" trailers are the contrivances, I wish I was a kid again so I wouldn't roll my eyes to half the situations and dialogue that exist simply because "Hey look at how cool my game is, even though most these situations can be avoided with just a little intelligence, but if there was intelligence then the good guys couldn't get to do this cool gameplay feature, or scripted sequence." I think I just need better weed.
Why is miles electricity blue
Looks sick! Not a huge fan of how Peter shoots out giant goo tentacles. Kinda reminds me of web of shadows in that way.
THIS IS GONNA BE TREND🔥
Here the people who have the PS5 🙌🏻
I can’t wait for this to drop
Ngl. They nailed it with the black suit. Peter scares me with the Symbiote and I like it.
They’re setting up an epic fight between Peter and Miles. I would also love to see them introduce or at least tease Gwen Stacy by the end of the game.
I can't wait to see VENOM in this awesome sequel
Juste une masterclass
We want turkish language
Looks awesome....i really hope it lands
Bro they listening to the fans
The black suit redesign looks awful. And so much automation that it feel more like an interactive movie.
It’s gonna suck when you get to the point of the game were Peter loses his symbiote and downgrades
Give me the reason to buy PS5, I'm still on my ps4 slim rn
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 when I seen the symbiote suit. OMG
5:00 Hadouken time for Miles!!! 10/10
now can bully Magriure be a skin by the way the actor for Spidey does a perfect way of peter being aggressive but it feels like Petes still fighting the symbiote and its aggressive but not to aggressive
Fantastic 😍
Why this looks like prototype ?
Use me as a G.O.T.Y button
Definitly getting "SHOCKER!!!!!! I WILL HUNT YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!!!!!" vibes from this and I love it. Every single addition we saw I love! Cannot wait for this game.
im glad there not holding back on how cold hearted symbiote spidy can be
Please don't be ps5 only 🫠🫥
Why does Peter sound like a dark matpat
Can’t wait to watch a streamer play this because I still can’t get a PS5
An amazing details is that, at 11:55, you can see the symbiote giving Peter scarier eyes. Like its taking more control of Peter's body, turning him slowly in Venom
Leaving this comment to return to when it’s released. Hype is real for the game, it could be good.
ARE WE GONNA FIGHT SANDMAN??!???
if they don't release  this on pc i'm gonna be so mad
6:48 i love how peter looked like a villain in this entreace. chills bro.
The voice in the black suit is certainly channeling that time in the 90's cartoon where the Shocker is running away, terrified of Peter.
gamers be like : "cant wait to ask mom credit card to buy this"
I'm sad to know that I won't be able to play this wonder on PlayStation 4, and I won't have a Playstation 5 anytime soon, since I'm Brazilian and a Playstation 5 costs 4000 reais
AAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIII MEU DEUSSSSSSSSSSS
Reminds me of the Ultimate Spiderman game, this is beautiful ❤
Of course… no pc release
Zahmmmmmmm
Jeezus crisis this game is absolutely amazing
Why cant the movies be as good as this? Lets just hire these guy to make the movies too.
They didn’t state PlayStation only so might see a 6 month to a year later release on PC
Miles is going to have to fight Peter because of his growing aggression causing him to make careless choices. Hell most likely almost kill someone. Ganke either dies or eventually becomes evil.
Well i think they did a good job with the symbiote with only sligltly little changin compared to the comics vwrsion and they nailed. And please call him symbiote, not Venom, Venom is the symbiote bonded with brock, not with spidey.also i am the only one who can't stand anymore evryone who complain about the graphics?for real... The graphic the graphic the graphic....the graphicis great, i don t care to have an hyper realistic graphic if  the game suck. The palyin is the most important thing in vedeogames, not the graphic. For me, this gameplay is very good.hope they also added speed increasing in the swinging. If they add that for me this game is ready to satisfy many of spidey fans. Can t wait to play
Miles V Peter bossfight is gonna be goated
Now peter has a venom too😂 not only miles
Must get!!! 🤧
I just saw Wraith on the GPS scanner Kraven's henchman was holding; Yuri Watanabe is there too!!
I can already hear the fan of my PS4 pro.
“You sure? He’s got big teeth!” “So do I.” Oh man!!! I absolutely cannot wait to see how Peter’s increasing aggression with the symbiote suit will impact the gameplay and story! 💫
OMG this looks INCREDIBLE!!!
I hope they release it on Steam. I’m not buying a PS5 regardless.
Cool
the way he uses that wing glider is full of the exaggerated swagger of a black teen
3:10 Ayeeooooo🔥 hopefully we have more of this type of combat in the game. It’s giving me that “Batman spam square” type beat
2023 will be the best year for games, but I dont have a gaming system, yet still enjoy the excitement :)
am in love
Imagine if fighting an altered Peter fully taken over by the Venom symbiote was the final boss of the game (judging by his personality changes)...gameplay is sick btw. The fall can’t come fast enough!
This looks  🔥
They've won. That's all I gotta say.
Ok there is potential for this character 😊 ultimately Sony will butcher this awesome character in the live action movie
Already this is giving me massive web of shadows vibes that suit looks awesome and the force and power behind his attacks along with the tendrils, September cant come soon enough
I hope Ghost-Spider appears.
So glad that the first guy wasn't Kraven, can't wait to come to PC, this will be the first game since RDR2 that I'll buy at launch. I bought the first one on PS4 pro and was my favorite game of the gen.
M-My jaw has been dropped for a whole 12 minutes.
I had just now noticed that the Wraith is on the pad that the guy showed to Kraven! This game is gonna be amazing ong.
WOAH.
11:31 Though this isn't true, I kind of wish that this had happened.   After when Peter drops the civilian off, the way he is acting is very focused on "himself" and the task. Ignoring Miles that he's there with him too.  When he states "He got away from us," as he looks intently into the sewers where Connors escaped, the way he sits there thinking is "only himself". This is kind of shown too when Miles came to sit next to him saying, "It's good Pete," Peter's focused attention now has been cut because Miles talked.  In this part, I wish he had continued saying like, "No, he's ours." and "So do we." like how he usually is with the symbiote but I guess in terms of writing/where this is placed, and the fact that Miles says, "New threads" states that it's pretty early/just got the symbiote. So Peter wouldn't be saying "we" or "ours" early on.  Hoping to get that later down the line add some spice 😅
Goddammit now i defently need to get a ps5
This game looks absolutely insanely crispy
Symbiote spiderman? Kraven? Giant dinosaur lizard? Switching between different spider men? Tentacle weapons?! This is like the ultimate combo of all the early 2000 spiderman games I played and I LOVE IT!!!   Also does anyone else think that Peter's last line hints that HE will be the one to turn into venom and that's how we will get to play as the lethal protector? Bro does that mean we'll get venom vs lizard?! 😱
Bruh why does Miles still sound like a kid?  He was SEVENTEEN in the last game.
Man seeing all the additions to the stealth mechanics and the entire sewer bit with lizard and fighting all the drones throws me back to the Amazing Spider-Man game, love that they're bringing in the good parts of other iterations into this one, on top of what's already there. Also Queens looks dope asf
Peter got him a shiesty mask and think he different now
W💯
I'm getting Arkham Knight vibes from this!
Holy
bro i wasn't expecting that it would come out this soon for gameplay but eh i aint complaining so venom aint gonna no what hit em
the new parts of the map look sick and there’s finally something actually going on in the water with all the boats and stuff
Miles is going to have to put Peter down....already see it coming😮
Godddd this is excitinggggg
Looking Fire
PC Players see you in 2 years when they decide to let us play this too after ps players get fun
PC Please
woooooooooow
LETSSSSSS GOOOOOOOO
Why can’t this be on ps4 man
The symbiote is controlling Peter's anger
WHAT IF I CRY
The Anger In Yuri’s Voice!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Callind it now. Miles vs Peter/Vemon boss battle
Sony is out doing Microsoft by a long range with this May's state of play!  Its not even fair! Its like pistol whipping a blind person!
Bruh the Lizard reminds me of Killer Croc from Batman Arkham Knight!!
I'm so excited for this! Everything looks perfect! The dynamic between Pete and Miles, THE BLACK SUIT, and I'm loving Miles's new blue bioelectricity! I can't wait to experience that team up myself, and also to see the big Pete vs Miles showdown because that's so gonna happen. Buying this first day! <3
Plenty of people have already talked about how great this looks, so I’ll just say this: you can tell these guys get it. They understand the characters & what the fans want and they are working hard to deliver on the promise.
Peter:  I'm not gonna make it in time.  Miles:  I missed the part where that's my problem.
IS WRATH WHO WENT ROUGE?
Can't wait. This is so sick.
I need Wolverine gameplay next!!!!!
Does anyone get prototype vibes from this?
This looks INSANE!!! The jet ski sequence along with Peter’s symbiote suit is more than I could’ve ever have asked for. ❤️ 🌟
Wow! Not going to lie, i did not expect the symbiote suit combat to be so aggressive and venomy. Definitely loving it!
I hope they have the Sam Raimi black suit 3:33 Also THEY GLIDE NOW!
this looks great, graphics could be a bit better and i don’t like the hud but overall looks good
The voice acting on Angry symbiote peter is priceless
Weak. It's more of the same games.
LET’S GOOOOO🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥‼️
When this is a w game of the generation I was first
OMGOSH THIS LOOKS AWESOME!!!      only problem is I didn't see Peter with those awesome web gliders. Other than that they added everything I wanted to this game like the web line and simbiote
I love that we can explore other than Manhattan about time
If we get a venom vs lizard fight I'm going to flip out
Dude, it just occurred to me that because the game is just called “Spider-Man”, it doesn’t have to focus on just Miles or Peter. It’s legit like a dual Spider-Man experience where the player can experience both perspectives of two very different Spider-Men. Just like Edge of Time. I’m sooo excited bro, the interactions are gonna be so compelling
Take my money now!!!
this looks like a reskin the dodge animation is the exact same they still go back to the same pose between swings, they barely updated anything, this is like large DLC
You can tell the developers paid a lot of attention to the small details this time
God bless Yuri’s incredible voice acting
cant wait for someone to mod peter's symbiote suit with tobey maguire's one
I love those new powers, the power dynamic using both Spidermen (Spidermans?) I'm sold. Gimme!
Miles vs Peter final boss fight
Épico
SASUKE !!!!!!!
I hope they'll have a similar scene as in Raimi's Spider-Man 3, where Peter gets rid of the Venom suit
Look, amazing!! Cant wait❤
Holyyy, I can feel the Symbiote on Pete's Voice
Emo Spider-man yaaaay 😩👎
This looks GOATED
I look forward to playing it on PC once it's ported over!
A masterpiece and i am thankful to being alive while this is going big
Peter seems… angrier than usual
Can never get enough of Yuri Lowenthal !!
The original sucked, I have no hope for this one.
This game is going to be special. Can’t wait until it releases!
sounds like sasuke is ready to destroy the leaf village again
Griffin come back to this in 5 years
Finally Kraven getting his rightful place in the verse
"Harry is dying." FINALLY we're exploring that storyline!
Not a fan of the yellow tint
The suit looks straight up menacing and unique, loving this so far!
I love this! The design of Kraven hits the perfect balance of being comic accurate without being too goofy. Peters attitude and aggression and the way he treats miles. It’s not like he just suddenly doesn’t care, it’s that all his repressed anger and anxiety is being drawn to the surface. I also adore the symbiote design. The fact that it’s more insectoid, making Peter look like he has an exoskeleton. It FEELS alien, and not just like black goo. And the combat and movement! Just so fluid and with impact that you can feel. I can’t wait to play this
I hope venom takes over Eddie not the hunter dude they were changing
It looks fine as hell what can I say
amazing
Im switching to ps5 in 2 weeks🙏🙏🔥🔥
Better swinging?
Man i already love it. Miles seems so chill and innocent, while peter is just like a rogue character. Its quite cool how they are showing how it hasnt completely made him lose his control but slowly they are noticing his change. so cool!
Banger
the detail at 12:19 of the symbiote taking over the together and then the blast of bio electricity subduing it makes me think that we will have to fight Peter/Venom as Miles and that will be an interesting fight.
Peak game
Bro I’ll never be henchman. First day I’m retired 😂😂😂
looking good but the graphics are kinda disappointing, i was expecting something like unreal engine 5 based on the previous promotional material.
Hunt lol
Peter is desperate to save Harry. 😢
LOVE IT!🕷🕸
RIP Xbox fans lmao 💀
I knew it indrew ps4 spiderman symbiote suit before the second gma e was announced
I will see u guys again in the future my friends and sure do enjoy every last breath of this game ❤😏🤌
This looks Insane 👀👀
This looking up to be a great sequel
Venom, Kraven, Prowler, and even Taskmaster. Definitely buying this.
4:59 bro really did kamehamehaaaaaaa
*Black suit out the gate, Kraven, switch to Miles, Lizard, wing suits, “watch out for his new powers, seamless transitions, potential team combo attacks and mid switch in gameplay, and to too it off you know Venom will be there……I’ve been ready for this fall needs to be here tomorrow lol*
It’s so much action So much happening
Speechless ❤
Wow I cannot wait to play this game.
Prototype 3 looks real fine
It always made sense that kraven would try to hunt lizard. I never seen it happened
sensing a miles vs peter fight
YES LETS GOOOOOOOO AGGHHHH
Mr lowenthal your sasuke is showing
Game finna be 🔥
they better have taken notes from web of shadows
Prototype
This looks like a genuinely good time
W
Thank you insomniac for not leaving us bad I'm very excited for Marvel Spiderman 2 ❤️🖤🙏
GOTY!
Just gonna say I love how they adapted the black suit for this game. It looks less likely cloth and a lot more goopy. The eyes not moving is also a nice touch. I hope Peter's personality slowly changes over time like they did with Otto in the last game but idk how they'd pull that off and still have time for Venom
I wished Kraven was just by himself instead of having a group of people helping him out like the last 2 spiderman games but that's just my personal opinion
Shockerrrrrrr!!!!!!!!
Aaaaàaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I don’t know how insomniac is gonna do it but I need this game like tomorrow
I love the fact the suit is reforcing that hes angry on the eyes detail on 11:53
It’ll be funny if they make Harry into Vemon and they make Kraven into Fodder. I think they’ll lose money on that.
Is Nadji still voicing Miles??
Ngl it’s most likely gon be a Pete vs Miles fight scene
If remember correctly, the symbiote didn't behave like that when Peter was the host. It only made those extensions when Eddie took over. I guess this is a different take
Yesss black suit spiderman!!¡ reminds me of the earlier game Yeats ago when u could swap back and forth
Omg yessssss finally let's goooo! Im calling it I think in my opinion it's going to be game of the year what do you guys think?
smash
I can see Peter using his Susanoo as a weapon.
this is too much to not try...everyone's gonna love this🤩🤩
The thought that this is leading up to Peter wanting the suit off and it trying to stay stuck on him to change his heart gonna be crazy,leading up to Eddie turning into Venom is gonna be insane,and eventually,Doctor C
If only I had a ps5
I can wait for that new game to come out.
does we get the emo phase too like in spider man 3 XD
Kraven lookin' like WWE's Elias....cool.
Im hoping for better web swinging
Its not good enough.  Do Better !!!
Can someone explain how miles and Peter are in the same universe together??? And who the hell is in the black suit?? Did I miss something?
11:54 look at peters eyes when he says "so do i"
This looks so clean I need it
so... alright, a giang bird machine falls from that height, almost in their face, and no reaction? deaf and blind it is
2023 is insane for gaming. It’s honestly making up for the last few years for me, haven’t been this excited and consistently happy with games released. What a time to be alive :)
Just take my Money already
The shape of the suit is bad, and it should be smooth in the Venom suit. The second thing is the sound is not the best thing. The third thing is that there should be blood in the Venom suit, with a realistic look, and you should make another copy for the children. The fourth thing is here 4:03 The air is forced into the wing of the suit, so the body stands, making it look more realistic
This game looks Amazing
Can’t believe hitler is in the mew spider man
Peter Parker is Spiderman Miles Morales is Miles Morales
This is going to be awesome!!!
Amazing as expected. My guess is Miles probably ends up fighting Black Suit Peter eventually
Whoa, Kraven hunting Lizard sounds insane...
I love that between pursuing Conners and saving civilians, Symbiote Peter still chose the civilians. Attention to all of the small details are bound to lead to one hell of a story.
The graphics look so meh
Crap.  Now I have to buy a PS5.
The hud of the game is kinda yikes but overall this look really good
11:52 Venom Foreshadowing
The slingshot and gliding, OMGGGGG
Very impressed!
IM SO EXCITEDDD
I thought the first guy was kraven until kraven actually popped up? 😂
Too bad this is only for Playstation
Everything is perfect
INSOMNIAC YOU LOT ARE UNREAL.   The suit looks amazing, the suit like aspects on top with the oraganics on the side and underneath is so brilliant  The web slingshot, and gliding look unreal, you actually take into consideration what the fans ask for.   The switching between miles and peter, it’s legitimately flawless especially that cutscene where it miles saves peter, not to mention the different scenes like the water skiing i thought that was just a cutscene   - side note, that part of the end when peter says he has teeth and the suits eye change more like into venom is such a hype teaser.   Truly one of the few game developers out there that actually don’t miss
I can’t wait
Did anyone notice whenever Kraven broke that guys neck he did basically the same thing that Thanos did in IW? Threw him down the same way and everything😂
Playstation > xbox
80% of this was Miles. How about a full on Peter Parker game?
"Shocker!!! You cant escape me!!! ill chase you to the ends of the earth!!!!" Yuri better say that line!!
Pumped for this game.  I felt the characters in the trailer go through so many emotions just as I did!
This seems like a great game
Marcando presença dessa maravilha
muito homem-aranhastico 😅
Using the full power of the PS5's integrated fast SSD and graphics card caching/streaming, with no PS4 version (ancient spinning hard drive disk) to mess up the overall design. This game should feel considerably more powerful and stream-in some HUGE set-piece battles.
11:53 "See ya, chump".
welp, guess I'll play it when it's on pc
We are going to get a Peter Venom vs Miles Morales fight for sure !
Im calling it now there’s definitely gonna be a Peter V Miles fight or boss battle if you will.
Kraven is back 🥰
2:26 2:34 2:43 2:57 3:09 3:14   6:44 8:47   9:04 11:45 SYMBIOTE SPIDER-MAN LFGGGG MAN 🔥🔥🔥
it’s coming out in fall around my birthday im getting a ps5 then😁😁
Different va for Spider-Man?
Imagine if this game had coop...
I foresee miles fighting Peter. If not miles might obtain the symbiote and Peter realizes how it’s warping him. This is hella interesting. Can’t wait to play.
fire🔥
Nice
I’d wait 5-7 between every A1 title video game if we just gave Insomniac and Rockstar the monopoly.
11:30 I LOVE THE SCORE HERE!! It's slow and menacing, like a predator, but also gives a strong sense of concern about Peter's declining morality!! It's like the opposite of his main fast theme, and it's different from Raimi's bombastic Symbiote theme!! I LOVE IT!!!
Man I wish I had a PS5. This looks phenomenal.
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I love that a lot of comments have “I love” at the start of them
Hype let’s go I’m ready
Peter: No... _he's mine._ Miles: You sure? He's got big teeth. Peter: *So Do I.* Well, he's not wrong
Can someone explain how miles and Peter are in the same universe together??? Did I miss something?
I said wow and harry is being saved???
This looks like so much fun!!! I can’t wait to switch between characters and glider through the city on web wings
Water graphics look straight from a ps3 game
Can't wait for this to show up on PC 5 years later!
Raise of hands how many of you are expecting the black suit to mess with Pete's head so bad that Miles is going to have to fight him in order to get it off?
I guess it's a trend now to have Kraven, Venom, and Lizard in the same game. And this is also technically the third game in this series
I will be there
this looks the same
I LOVE ITTTTT
PLEASE ADD QUICK TIME EVENTS TO TAKE OF THE SUIT AND IT GRADUALLY GETS HARDER AS THE STORY PROGRESSES!
This will be a legendary game
Where is venom?
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This looks so good
When does this  come out
Guess Im buying ps5 now.
I absolutely love what we got so far, i cannot wait to see how the full story goes. Seeing Spidey in the black suit and hearing Peter as a more aggressive person gives me chills
So miles has peter skills from the first spiderman game And peter has new fighting skills bc of symbiote
Miles look baddass
wow this is really Kraven's year - video game, movie and even a comic event coming up
Commenting on trailer release date. 2029… do we have Spider-Man 3 yet?
I just finished Spiderman remaster and Miles Morales on PC a few months ago. Sucks because having just finished them, I'm super hyped for Spiderman 2, but god only knows when it'll drop for PC, lol.
Man I can’t believe I have to wait for this, hope it’s as fun as it looks
Why is miles electricity blue
Yuri Lowenthal, killing it as always.
I NEED IT NOW!!! AAHHHHH!!! Can't wait
Oh man, i cant wait. I thought the wolverine game was gonna be someing😅. Symbiote peter and miles is looking like a star in this game. 😮 I hope you can explore the other borrows of nyc in this game 😊
te amo
I never expected Dr. Connors to make an appearance but makes me more excited about this game even more. This has to be bigger than the other games for sure
I can't wait 😭
Playing as a Spider-Man who doesn’t pull his punches is going to be amazing
Graphics looked unpolished/low like it was running on low settings specially the water and outdoor areas.
Hoping there's an option to fully transform into venom through a skill tree. Spiderman doesn't usually turn into venom but if we wanted to it should be an unlockable skill.
at the end they removed the together bit i think miles has to beat peter
Omg I love it
Why is Miles in a Spider-Man game.
I’m not gonna lie seeing how more hard Peter is on miles with Symbiote is incredible especially the end when miles says he’s never like that I got chills
Am I tripping or does the voice actor sound like Sasuke (dubbed voice) from Naruto???
Venom Peter sounds like an alcoholic, Smart move on the devs.
If only it was two player 😭😭😭😭
seeing the black suit and the lizard makes me more excited about the game I can't wait
I don't about what the rest of the people in the internet think about this but one thing is cor sure...black suit Spiderman as better than the red and blue Spiderman
His I hope we get a McFarlane pack
5:00 had me bricked up ngfl
Congrats to all people behind this. 👏👏👏
Good thing I own a ps5 now because I’m sure pc ain’t getting this anytime soon lol
My goty already!
Can’t wait to be apart of what you guys have going 🔥❗️
💥
Cannot...flipping....wait
This really seems like a newer Spider Man: Web of Shadows. I hope it wont be some the same cookie cutter stuff at least for the Peter Parker side of the story. I love the new take on swapping characters mid-story.
Nice detail at 7:23 you can see Miles’ spider-sense is slightly quicker than Pete’s if you slow it down
Alright time for a ps5 😂🎉🎉
This looks AMAZING! every pun intended
They really nailed that aggression that comes with symbiote Spider-Man. Just watching that clip put me in fight mode. Need this game now!
Getting some serious Alex Mercer from Prototype vibes with Peters tendril attacks thanks to his black suit!!
I love the Spider-Man series
Peter será el jefe final
Hello future
Awsome
God...... This is going to be the. THE BEST SPIDER-MAN GAME OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!
Oh my goddd this game looks so good!!!
Que juegaaasooo!!!!!❤😍😍😍
Guys when Spiderman 1 take timeline?
Hope they will have it ready for pc nexst year 🤩🤞🤞
Okay People, any massage to gamers who will be watching or play this this game 2030+ 🤷🏾‍♂️
This isn't new generation graphic, textures was so bad, I can't see any graphic improvement 😐
Would be a great twist if Miles got the black suit next. I don’t think we’ve ever seen that even in comics
Will not be buying
i hate this new UI tho
THE BEST SPIDER-MAN GAME THAT WILL COME OUT AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE R RATED STUFF, FOR THE BLOOD, PETER BEING DARK, SYMBIOTE AND STUFF!!! NAAAH THAT'S JUST AMAZING
So glad we got the black suit! 🗣💯💯
I can't wait to see Venom. It's very interesting seeing Peter so cold, but is noticeable Miles is feeling something wrong.
BRO I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THIS GAME THIS IS SOO COOL THE WAY THEY'RE HANDLING THIS GAME AND THE BLACK SUIT....BRO THIS IS GONNNA BE FUN
The symbiote move-set alongside the new travel mechanics (glide) look cool. Also, Miles looks good as well in the gameplay.
I will come back when I retire after 30 years and replay all spiderman games.
This gives old predator vibes
Bro sounding alot like sasuke
it's in 1080p.....
A BIG NO TO FLYING SPIDERMAN....
This game is going to be soo good. Im getting a vibe that Peter will come close to crossing a line that he usually wouldnt and miles stopping him = causing them to fight almost till death until peter realizes it and over comes the symbiote
the exaggerated swagger of a black teen is back!
I wonder if we're gonna get a fight between miles and Peter where miles has to stop peter from doing something horrible
Yuri Lowenthal amazingly showed by voice alone how the symbiote is affecting Peter, and the game shows the same thing through his actions/how he fights. I also love how the sweet and wholesome relationship between Peter and Miles is being compromised due to the symbiote as well! This game is gonna be amazing 100%, it was so well worth the wait
MatPat called it, cant wait to see the venom symbiote in action
GOTY incoming
What if it’s a choice on who gets the symbiote?
I bet the final boss would be a Vemon version of Kraven unless they introduced Eddie but I don’t see how he would be hating Peter since he quit the Daily Bugle but besides that I can’t wait to do new game+ ultimate and 100% it like the original
Epico
I am so Hyped for this!! Can't wait to see more of Symbiote Spiderman!!
Shut up and take my money
You know we are going have to fight peter!!
GOD I LOVE HOW ORGANIC THE BLACKSUIT IS BRUH IM SO HYPED
I absolutely love this. More please!
When the new Spider-Man 2 game comes out, I really hope that Walter Hardy the original Black Cat will return & hope that his lovely daughter Felicia Hardy the new Black Cat might eventually finds out that he’s been alive after all these years. & I just hope that Peter Parker & Miles Morales will do everything in their powers to help Felicia & Walter Hardy reunited safely from the Maggia Crime Syndicate
Now way they came up with zip lines!!!! That was just the thing a few days ago that I thought that spider man games are missing, well it’s about dang time they added them! This is so lit!!
The details that are new in this game is the new skills and the map that includes Queens and maybe Brooklyn so far.
Looks mid as hell
I really hope that Felicia Hardy the Black Cat will return on the new Spider-Man 2 game. Which she is, the fact that we all saw her face on the map. I just hope that she has changed into something & somewhat better. & I really hope that she & Spidey will cross each other’s path again in a little romantic way
Thats new mechanic where spiderman can slide in the Air, Cant wait to try those
Just by this, I can tell they’ve nailed the Black Suit and how it changes Peter. How it changes the host. Seems like this is also around the time you first get it or at least when it first starts taking hold based off of the dialog. This game is going to be one for the ages
Looks epic, can’t wait for this!
Is it coming to new gen Xbox please
Why’d he have to kill Q from Impractical Jokers 😢
Все супер, но вода😢 это пипец!
Getting those Bully Maguire vibes!
Gameplay is nice but the graphics don't look look current gen. Could be the poor video compression.
Seeing black suit having its own spotlight instead of being visual only makes me miss WOS. Hope someone will make remake in future.
Those robotic animals remind me of Horizon Zero Dawn (2:44 for example). Also, it kinda sounds like I heard “Doctor’s” sound effects from Dead by Daylight lol, maybe from Ganke’s drone. Just a little bit tho.
Can't wait to see Venom vs Peter. Ik Miles is in this too but this Peter against Venom would be insane
i love Spider-Man: Web of Shadows I think this would be good too really
love all the new game mechanics
They can't do him worse than they did in the comics. Right???
Cant wait to comeback and watch this vid 5 years from now
Talk about Amazing team work 10:54
Man I love that they added the other burrows of NY
This is the first spoiler I’ve gotten to miles morales or the second Spider-Man game but I do have to ask why don’t you guys give Miles the Venom suit? I mean for real imagine fighter, venom with electricity and venom being immune to fire in a game
7:57 ganke about sums it up
I'm there for launch day❤️
The suit is like how I'd imagine it if it were from the Venom movies. Looks great.
Epic, this studio is amazing
This is the Batman Arkham Knight for spiderman cool and new mechanics amazing story and dark and gritty and emotional SPIDERMAN 2 AND BATMAN ARKHAM KNIGHT ARE THE GOATS OF SUPERHERO GAMES
Best game reveal in last 5 years
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!🤯🤯🤯🤯🥳🥳🥳🥳✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾💯💯💯💯
*******YES!!!!*******  That's all I got.
Why they always gotta make the suit make him aggressive, why can't they make it the way it used to be. But this looks amazing either way and I'm very excited to play it when it drops
SHUP UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!
I’m so glad I was right last year when they dropped the first trailer I was like they def bout to have kraven and venom !!!
Man, this gameplays crazy! 😊
Oh my god
Sb ruin  Help wanted 2 Marvel spider-man 2
FANTASTICO
Hearing yuri lowenthal mad as spiderman made me realize he also plays lagoon boy on young justice
Oh, if it’s going to be like in GTA 5 switching character system for miles and Peter that’s gonna be so sick 🔥👏😌
I see where the budget is going and i like it
The fact that insomniac STILL partnered will Marvel says a lot that insomniac is showing love and dedication to us long-time fans. Can't wait to see what the future holds for miles and the gang!  Stan Lee would be proud.❤
Hey marvel when will this new Spider-Man game come out
suit looks so good.
Peter is channeling his inner Sasuke and I’m totally here for it
See you in 5-10 years when I get a ps5
I will literally kill someone just to get a ps5 and get this game😭💀
looks like garbage
Amazing ❤
They glide now... THEY GLIDE!!!!! OH MY GOD!!!!!
Miles has become Spider-Man's robin
Yuri ia hoing full nlown Sasuke
Peak
Who’s here after the new Spider-Man 3 trailer dropped 😭😭✋🏽
This game finna be crazzyyyy
Game of the year??????
SOOOOOOOOO LETS GOOO
Imagine the tricks you could pull with the web wings
HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE!
Got a ps4 for spider-man now i guess im getting a ps5 😂
Everyone here 3 years later watchin back older games when the ps6 is announced 👋👋🙋‍♂️
You know things are getting serious when Peter cuts off Miles’ quips.
I really like Peter's aggressiveness in his voice while wearing the symbiote. Definitely feels like a callback to how he was in the 90s animated show. Can't wait for this game to come out.
SOLID
And people wanted this co-op
Poor miles doesn't deserve this treatment from petet
I'm beating this game on the hardest difficulty. I'm buying every dlc lol. This game is perfection
THEY NOT ONLY ADDED VENOM BUT FUCKIN MADE MILES RAIDEN game of the year.
So dope
Now everyone will buy the PS5 lol
Queens!
Anyone notice the bit where Peter says Harry is dying??
Over 100k likes in the first few hours. I wonder if this has achieved a record for the most amount of likes in the shortest period of time!!
not on ps4 bruh
Prediction that may be obvious: We will DEFINITELY fight Peter as Miles. Maybe even as a final boss? That would be heartbreaking
I love the natural looking eyes on Peter’s Black Suit, The Web-Gliding is a cool addition to the already diverse swing mechanics on both spideys and it makes me wonder if we’re getting any MCU suits in the game. Kraven being the seemingly major villain in this game is a plus, and Peter’s behavior and body language and Miles catching on is great.
Yeah this looks cool. Honestly it’s just impressive to see a trailer with actual gameplay and not just cutscenes. Shows they are confident in their game. Can’t wait.
* Edit* 14 confirmed villains from this trailer alone:  Kraven Venom Shocker Vulture Fisk Dr. Ock Wraith Tombstone Black Cat Prowler Taskmaker Lizard Rhino Green Goblin
Nah nah nah this looks nuts  Edit: water looks very old gen
Why Peter sound like Sasuke or is it just me lol ?
This is so sick
We got bully maguire, ya boy kraven, the lizard, venom and hopefully they could add the Spider-Man 3 suit removal sequence where your able to take off the black suit but struggle to do so. Also they made the lizard pretty big and I’m guessing we might get a lizard kajiu fight just like in Spider-Man 3.
So is the Lizard a villain in this too? Kraven, Venom and the Lizard?!
Hopefully they give us an option to decide which of Peter's face models that we want.
This game is the perfect opportunity to have a Venom without needing Eddie Brock to be on the scene, Pete can become Venom and sure once it's off of him Eddie can be teased post credit, but my god a full Venom Pete sounds terrifying and terrific.
How is it this game is months away and we've still barely seen any of it? I mean I hope it still comes out on time and what we have seen looks great. It's just unusual
I can't wait! 🔥
Tell me Peter says Miles swings with the exaggerated swagger of a Black teen.
You can already get a good look at peters black Air Force mode now. So awesome
Do the swing still have that 'safe zone' feel?
I like when spider man spidered everywhere
This looks insane!! I can’t wait to play it!!😍🥰
The moment we've been waiting for
Spider-Man: Web of Shadows 2.0
I hope you get the option to kill the hunter; he is such an annoying character in every adaptation that he is in. This one seems to be no exception.
Can we talk about how crazy my boy Miles done got in only a YEAR at being Spider-Man.
😅 can anyone else see you having to fight Peter as miles?
This looks amazing! I have a feeling there is going to be a Miles vs Peter fight with Miles trying to get the symbiote off of Peter.
I think I came when I saw the sling shot ngl
Does anyone else get the sense that Goblin will be born because Harry/Venom dies?
The way how peter looks in the symbiote suit is so realistic
Carnage dlc pls
Woah
can wait to see spiderman say "I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye"
I really wasn't expecting Kraven's Last Hunt, but I'm all here for it. I'd be so hyped to see Peter dig himself out of his own grave.
I’m so hyped for this I knew kraven was gonna be here, the lizard was a suprise!!! But I love the difference in regular Peter and symbiote Peter
So bummed the Spider-Man games are only on PS.
Prototype 2 tentacles
I am so exited to watch people playing this game
in 10 years people are gonna look back at this and say "the good old times", glad Spiderman still has dedicated community decades later
ALLLYYYYYOOOOOPPPPPP
It occurred to me that at 11:37 Peter is talking about himself and the symbiote when he says "us" and not him and Miles, which I think was a cool touch.
My question is when can we expect a pre-order date?
Omg - Web of Shadows 2 looks awesome!
there will be in PS4 ??
I couldn't help but compare the Peter we see here with Andrew's character in No Way Home. The way he "stopped pulling his punches" and "got bitter".   Obviously in this game it's because of the symbiote that's corrupting Peter's mind but I'm glad this more aggressive side of Peter is being explored nevertheless.  The dynamic between him and Miles is just the icing on the cake.  Can't wait for this masterpiece.
Can’t wait to see how Pete got the symbiote
The end of the trailer is like Spiderman 3 trailer. COOL
Kraven looks badass and menacing af!
Lets go baby
Sandmans lucky he didnt have to fight this spiderman
Game of the year award contender and it’s not even out yet!
Pleeeeeeease have the movomg eyelids on the black suit lols
Dude the black suit looks amazing. It kind of looks like light armor. Plus Yuri is knocking it out of the park with the rage voice. It’s actually scaring me lol 😂. We all know that Harry is going to be venom later on but I wonder if they’re going to introduce the green goblin in the finale.
Looks 30fps. Hopefully it has a performance mode.
Bruh I thought the first guy was kraven the hunter lol
Game of the decade incoming
nice
This game is original MW2 status
So spider man 3 villains kraven venom and lizard wait wait if spider man already in symbiote then where harry
Those emotive eyes on the symbiote suit at the end looked amazing. It's subtle but I love how organic it appears.
YO! Anyone else SUPER HYPED about THROWING TIGHTROPES and WEBBING UP MORE THAN ONE ENEMY from a height at a time?  *SKRT-SKRT, WIRBL-WIRB!*😂
Goty already
LETSGO VENOMMM
11:31 The way he just dropped him and Miles is like “tf” 💀
Time for some Bully Parker moves. 😏
The black suit looks glossy
This looks like the next best game! I love the water fight!!!!!!!!
The Black Suit Spidey in this game sounds a lot like Black Suit Spidey from the 90’s cartoon.
Truly astonishing can't believe the improvements to travel. This is going to be something special
This looks so good except for the wingsuit. Miles was literally flying and barely used web swinging. If it was just for gliding, I would've loved it but like this it looks ridiculous. :/ Web swinging itself only looks marginally better, definitely faster but still very "hand-holdy". And if the wing suit is supposed to make us rely on web swinging even less, well that's just stupid. Spider-Man isn't supposed to fly.
bro. I’m amazed. just. amazed. can’t wait
“We're in the kitchen. It smells good” Facts!
Why aren't other dev studios like Isomniac? Like they could have dropped a cgi trailer. But here we are with a 12m gameplay trailer. Props to Sony for this!
See y’all in 2099 🫡
As you all know: INSOMNIAC doesn't miss the little details. Of all the big AAA game studios, they always nail the extra details of environment and story/character.
Symbiote Spider-Man, he makes you see God
LET'S GO LADS!!!
We’ve been waiting for this way to long
OH MY GOD THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!
This is a masterpiece
This is amazing I need a new PS5 😅
I was so pissed at first bc  I thought this wasn’t Spider-Man 2 at first and he said this is the final game of the showcase lol
this is absolutely beautiful, masterpiece of a game, just from the little "sneak peaks" of lizard we get, he already looks amazing, cant wait for it
3:49 THE EXAGGERATED SWAG OF A BLACK TEEN
I am getting spider-man 3 ps3 flashbacks but this looks so much better
The [PROTOTYPE] x inFAMOUS game we always dreamed of
that 'so do i' at the end sounded like keanu reeves
Kreaven showed up at the perfect time
Makes me want to play Spiderman.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Can’t wait for this bad boy
Too clean and ad free to be new york
Why is he in the Symbiote Suit?
That’s it I’m upgrading from my ps4 just so I can play this game. It’s not even out yet and it’s game of the year for me.
Thank you
Looks like Dr. Connors used some Godzilla DNA!
I know it’s a weird comparison; but do y’all think we would be able to swap between them like in gta v with the characters or how would that work
11:47 Spider-Man: No he’s mine Miles Morales: Are you sure it’s got big teeth  Spider-Man: So do I 😡
Can’t wait
BULLY MAGUIRE LETS GO
These guys could really make a good just cause game
Wait, is that moon knight  ???
Lowenthal letting out the Sasuke with the Symbiote I love it here
The Cinematics are better than the MCU films…Fact !!!
was anyone else waiting for the chidori?
He got that sasuke I him 😂😂
Just make another Wolverine Origins game or remaster the original, the spiderman games run out of steam quick.
THE GLIDER SUIT. Literally everything I ever wanted.
GOTY. I'm already calling it!!!
This looks awesome!!!!!! The black suit combat is way more aggressive and creative, miles new powers connect him more to comics and spider-verse, and the map that Kraven shows all the characters who are gonna be in the game.....SUPER EXCITED FOR VENOM!!!!
…okay now is a good time to save up for that ps5 now
Narutooooooooooooooo!!!! - Yuri
This looks beyond phenomenal. I’m so excited
Croc
love this, was just hoping for a more expanded set of animations for Peter's webswinging, they're still all the same from the OG game + the symbiote ones. also the water looks kinda meh, so I hope they'll manage to improve it before launch.  besides this, the game looks absolutely amazing, i love the new gameplay features they added, best way to build upon what was already good, and im sure there's still a lot we have to see.  words can't describe how excited i am for this game <3
ohhhh i hope we get the bully maguire dance
This game is going to be so good, they’ve been working on this for so long and I’m without a doubt playing it
I have a question when does Spider-Man get the venom suit because it wasn’t in the first game nor miles morales idk if I missed something
This is so dope
Saskue!!
This Game Boutta Be HYPE!!!! can’t wait to try it out yo.
It's literally the exact same game Just new graphics and a new story, the web swinging still has the same problem as the last ones, so many people didn't want it to be the same game but here we are. Disappointed...smh
Fuckkkin hype bro this going b the game of the year
I love that it seems u can catapult off of objects now! Epic!
let them cook
i can hear a little hint of sasuke (same voice actor) whenever peter talks
this is gonna is gonna go so crazy with the dualsense edge
Now THIS is a gameplay trailer. God i cant wait for this game!
And no ads to watch an ad! You guys are a class act!
wow this looks amazing👏 they really went to town on all the upgrades 🖤🕸
So I’m guessing since venom is the main antagonist we’ll either get to play as Venon spidey for at least half the story OR we’ll have to fight Peter as miles at some point, then fight venom after.
Guys......the music!  I still have miles morales installed just to listen to the music lol
I love the small detail that when peter responds with "so do i" you can see the edges of peters lenses get sharper and more venom like
Un be lieveable  This is insane!!!!!!
In the ending Miles said that the lizard have a big teeth and spiderman respond that he have teeth too it's like a Easter egg because venom the sympiot that he wear have teeth ......🖤🕸️🖤🕷️🖤🕸️🖤
Can't wait to combine symbiote powers and moves
Spiderman web of shadows vibe
I love the Killer Croc take on the Lizard. He's big, scary and strong. Considering that Venom is in the game, I'm expecting a Venom vs Lizard fight.
OK. I am buying it.
Will be buying
I feel bad for the poor bastards that have to animate and program all this goodness.
Man this is such a great year for Gaming. Between 2023 and 2024 we are getting the best games of all time. I'm hyped for this one.
Thanks for this game but PC is my platform
Can I say it now, Miles?
WHERE IS MY MULTIPLAYER😭😭😭😭
Omg this looks amazing. Those animations and the black suit Peters wearing is epic. I loved watching that chase scene and the fact Lizards on the run, Kravens chasing Lizard all while Peter and Miles are chasing Lizard. The way these two transition and also have bonded together is great. I can't wait for this game now and am so glad they didn't reveal too much as many games do which often ruins the plot in many highly anticipated games. I wish we could just skip the summer now lol.
Omg are we gonna see bully maguire !!!😳🫢🫣😱
5:02  Miles choke slamming someone "We know a thing or two because we've seen a thing or two
Can't wait to revisit this video in 10 years to remember the good all days. "I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them"
Got some Spider-Man 3 vide game vibes with the lizard and black suit it’s pretty awesome man
This is all perfect. The best gameplay trailer I've seen for any game. I love how Peter hasn't lost himself to the Symbiote, but is definitely being influenced by it. Including the subtle nuances of him tossing someone who saved to the ground, and Miles having a moment of concern played strictly through animation.  Also, I could've sword I've seen people making mods for the web line. Seeing them take something community made and making that a core mechanic is just incredible. It's such an easy thing that games never do for some reason.
Xbox won.
11:30 i like how peter just throws the civilian he saved to the ground, also his spidey senses not working on the droid since he was acting out of anger, peak gaming
This is actually insane! 🔥🤯
Hope the web swinging can hold a candle to PS2 (2004) with a skill celing
It better not just be the exact same game with a different story
Aw man just watching this I could die in peace but my will power keeps me alive long enough to play this game when it drops
IM UNBELIEVABLY EXCITED THE WINGSUIT IS SO DOPE
Insomniac sure knows how to make jaws drop🔥definitely a GOTY contender already😍
game of the year
I was here btw this game will be big
Hope we can play as Venom like in Ultimate Spider-Man
This was AMAZING! Love the soundtrack change at 3:37-3:43!
What I like about the gameplay of the symbiote is that it looks EXACTLY the feeling of having that power. Spiderman, regardless of that power, still has to dodge in order to use it, but when he does he's using strategy which makes the moves he does look real. It's almost like he's powerful, but at the end of the day, he's still a single man in a suit. But he's a one man army in that suit.
So .. Coop??
Love how brutal spidey is with the suit. You can see in the way he slams down those enemies or even how he just tosses the innocent aside like he's nothing.   I still wonder if the symbiote is lab grown or the classic alien.
I need this game NOWWW
cant unhear Sasuke😭
Bro is in his Sasuke Arc(You know because him and Sasuke have the same voice actor😅)
este juego va a ser una locuraaaa
Take my money
I don’t know how I could love this game even more than I already did.
I bet Peter is going to be one of the main bosses in this game and that players will be fighting him as Miles in order to remove the symbiote suit from him.
I definitely saw deadpool in there
Ok I'm getting a PS5
This game is about to be fire 🔥 when it drops
Just can't wait to utilize those venom tentacles in action! Looks very promising! Also, with regard to the dynamics of Miles and Peter, why the f*** nobody ever thought of that type of spider-man story so far??? It's so unique and entertaining!
There will be a Miles vs Peter in the Venom suit fight
Game of the decade. Even the subtle tossing the civilian on the floor to show his Pete’s changes. Love it
yessir
Why does Spider-Man sound like MattPatt 😂
8:47 So Pete has the symbiote suit and we see the same stiff web swinging animations from the last game? What a letdown
Lol Tours must be fun in NYC, on one hand it's like "oh hey, it's spiderman! 😊" and in the same moment it's like "OH GOD ITS SPIDERMAN, WERE GONNA DIE!"
I hope you can switch back to regular like the other spider man
Oooh I like the effects of the goo on Peter and Miles! Wth was that? Bro didnt even swing. Just flew across the map 😭  Edit: did I really just call the symbiote “goo”? 💀
Insomniac, you guys are becoming great game developers...outstanding what you've accomplished here, and this only a taste of what's coming this fall for your fans of Spider-Man. Truly amazing. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Omg. Looks more like a movie to me. ❤❤. Awesome
MEU PAIIII EU QUERO AGORA MUIIIITO UM PS5KKKKKKK
The gameplay with Miles looks like it will be tight as usual. The Parker with the Symbiote seems meh! But it might turn out better later
4:58 SINCE WHEN DID MILES LEARN KAMEHAMEHA
we gonna have to fight peter at the end of the game 100%
I'm about to bust
Wow looks like they decided to borrow the sm3 game plot with black suit spidey fighting Kraven to save the lizard 😮
Amazing!!! Can. Not. WAIT!!😁😁 Stupid question, but I know it's still New York.....but it's bigger right?
lighting and water quality is dog shite!!!!!!!!!!
this is really disappointing peter is so cringe and miles being so op makes it less cool and his lightning is supposed to be orange not blue.
Cheese
It’s so hard to NOT hear the Sasuke and Ben 10 in Yuri’s voice lol
This looks amazing
Ok welp this is a day one buy for me
Sexo audiovisual
I would love to see the peoples reaction if this was presented on e3
Can’t wait for people to start calling this glorified dlc
Story seems pretty cool, but the graphics are meh
bro i cant wait for this game sm details with spiderman omggggg i csnt wait what this game brings 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm 4 minutes in and I've already went through 3 pairs of pants
I wouldve liked the orange venom but the blue is ok
Anybody got 500 dollars ? Want a ps5
Insomniac has been HARD AT WORK!!
Oh my god my brain exploded
Can’t wait to see his alternate costumes in Symbiote form
🔥🔥
I wanna cry from happiness 😭
i wish it was on xbox
Oh my god oh my god oh my god yes yes yes!!! 💙💙💙💙 WHOOOO!!!!! IM SO DANG EXCITED LETS GOOOOOO
GET BACK HERE KRAVEN, KRAAAAVVEEEEEN. YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME, I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE END OF THE EEEAAAAAARTH.  If we don't get a scene like that, I ain't playing this game 😂 😂
POV it’s 2023 and you don’t have a ps5
If this game follows the same tipe of storytelling as the last one then I'll guess the Lizard will work as Mr.negative, being a big threat that eventually becomes a secondary character by the end, Kraven will work as Norman Osborne by being more of an antagonistic force through out the game without being the main bad guy and finally Eddie Brock will work as Dr. Otto Octavius by being a part of Peters life that eventually due to tragic circumstances will become the villain of the story.
The only way this could be any more hype is if we got to play as Venom like in Ultimate Spider-Man. But even if that doesn’t happen I’m still hyped.
If this game doesn’t have any pizza run deliveries I’m not going to be very pizza
So Kraven was just hunting "sone dude" that looks like a randon thug
This looks terrible. Is something I would say on opposite day! Can't wait!
Let's go bro
Game of the year off the bat
so Peter Parker with Symbiote will be the final villain?
Why does Peter sound like sasuke?
i don’t think a lot of people noticed the subtle foreshadowing at 12:15 the way the symbiote tries to take the spider logo then miles’s electric stops it
LETS GO! CANT WAIT TO GET THIS GAME.
Oh PLEASE just don't bring the Milestones feature back!! Everything shown in this trailer looks amazing!
How do they make already realistic graphics look even more realistic
HOLY CRAP
It looks fun
That’s how u announce a game unlike gta 6
UNDERARM WEBBING! FINALLY
Wanna be part of this masterpiece 🔥
okay ima say it spider man might become venom and he might be a boss miles will have to face which i think would be dope
that was amazing! take my money!
Awesome 🖤🕷⚡
No Venom? They are saving him for something big for sure
11:32 El no es spider-man
lol I just hope we play as Miles Morales and we have to fight Peter and we beat him somehow and the symbiote deem us more worthy and attach to us cause Miles’ Symbiote suit looks so much more better than Peter’s or Eddie Brock’s but I’m almost certain it’s going straight to Eddie Brock SMH🙄they will miss a golden opportunity we might not ever see Miles’ symbiote suit on console lol😂😳🔥
Ok this is AMAZING! NOW PORT IT TO PC SOOON AFTER RELEASE PLEAAASE! ❤️
Todo esta excelente y me encantan las nuevas mecánicas y la agresividad de Peter con el simbionte, me recuerda a Web of Shadows. Lo único que no me gusto a mi opinión personal es que el traje del simbionte se vea como un traje de plástico una textura que da esa impresión. Talvez en la versión final del juego lo arreglen pero de ahí todo ok
I am so happy spiderman now kill
perfect. literally perfect.
I so excited for this shii man
To bad it’s not co op but still sick a hell
Game looks beautiful and interesting:p
predicting now a final boss fight where you fight Venomized Peter as Miles… would be so cool!
Miles morales : I've never seen him like this before.  Peter Parker: See ya chump!
I hope they readded the Chrysler building in Manhattan, ain't a symbiote spider-man game without that famous perch spot
I love how Peter eyes change into venom at 11:53. This game is gonna be crazy
Bro this looks like the spider man game from ps4, emo pete is so sick😊
Está hermoso las cinemáticas
HYYYYYYYYYYYYYPE!!!!!!!!!!
Peters suit is ugly Walmart venom
Hated the Shocker chase sequence and I can tell I'm going to hate playing this one. That said, storytelling is on point.
3:10 that mans nuts are disintegrated.
How cool is that. I'm looking forward to the release on the Qewbite channel, because the PS5 is too expensive xd
LETSSS GO
With all the swagger of a black youth
That little detail where Peter threw the guy he saved without making any quips really shows how much the symbiote has fed him up
This looks so f'ing awesome!
f yeah! Spiderman Vs Mile Morales fiyahhhhh
SHOCKEEEEEEERRRR!!!!
I was just curious about how the spider man 2 game is going and now this shows up today 🥹
I hope peter looks normal and not the cursed version we got in miles' game.
Ok so I love how Black suit Peter sounds more…..Sasuke,gotta really put that darkness in there
lizard looks like killer croc
We were here
Oh it’s beautiful
This looks absolutely incredible. They found a way to make Spider-Man terrifying, Yuri sounds menacing as hell, and the graphics are just ( chef’s kiss ).   I can’t wait to see more!
can we move past Spiderman and get something new for a change
wow the new prototype game looks nice
holy smoly THIS looks insane !! i loved the other 2 games of spider-man, but the details in this one ! JESUS LORD !
Yuri's bringing back his Sasuke unhinged era for Peter
Man, this is satisfying to watch. I especially love the sinuous and fleshy appearance of the black suit, truly makes the living symbiote that much creepier!
Is this on PS5 aka PS4 Pro Pro?  3 years in and Sony and Microsoft have still barely offered anything truly next generation. This generation has been a huge letdown.
The only question I have is why do people even live there with all that danger 😂
100% spiderman will be the final boss, and you'll fight him as Miles when the symbiote has fully taken over.
end fight scene gonna be miles vs peter I'm telling yall
This gives me joy
When Peter talks aggressively all I hear is Sasuke Uchina. Same voice actor haha
Might have a game that may finally have better combat that Arkham knight
hope it gets delayed or canceled
3:53 “They fly now?!”
Loving venoms redesign theirs almost sinew like structure in the joints and on thighs sort of hr geiger type organic horror the tentacle tubercles are very alien also noticed how they play with eye movement at the end looks great.
Could we get an official Story Trailer next month?
Not sure why people where hating on this at the showcase.. definetly pre ordering looks awesome
This game will undoubtedly win GOTY. Between the absolutely insane graphics and the stunning graphics, the incredible Spider-duo won't even have a competition. Can't wait to play this for a week straight!
this is gonna be the best super hero game ever
I can't wait for this Game this is Gonna be awesome the Black suit looks Perfect
Perfection so good
It’s so stupid they don’t make Spider-Man games available for Xbox
Kraven is a beast
This game is gonna be game of the year fasho
I've been thinking, and initially I thought it was kind of strange having Peter be so aggressive so early on in the symbiote, but then I thought that maybe this is just the first point in the game he uses the suit in front of Miles. Something tells me we'll get the suit relatively early on and Peter will begin to use it for solo night missions, leading to the bond between him and the symbiote we're seeing in this reveal.
Pete looks extremely terrifying with the symbiote suit. And i love the small details where you can see how symbiote is affecting petes behaviour. Anyways, i really do hope they improve the dodging mechanics and the web swinging mechanics. The rest looks 🔥
Spiderman vs. Spuderman before we get Venom???  Also PLEASE let ther be a fight where Peter chases down Shocker and quotes the 90's show. "GET BACK HERE SHOCKER! SHOOOCKEEEEEERRR!!!!!"
PLEASE MAKE THIS COME TO SWITCH THIS TIME!!
Don't want.
2:03 HOW MANY MONTHS???
ga sabar wkwkk
he slammed that guy from 10 feet in the air and he bounced. there’s no way he’s not dead
Bro everything was true insomniac's level of detail is just outstanding there's so many thing I noticed , this game is going to be epic it's definitely gonna surpass the first one ❤️‍🔥
İt’s gonna be better than the first one i feel it
Only me waiting for venom as playable char ? I wanted to eat people and be just venom :D
Can’t wait for lizard also
Can’t wait to watch the gameplay when this game fully comes out.
this was amazing and makes me really excited for the game. i'm worried though that the game might play from miles' perspective a touch too much. hopefully we play as peter for the majority of the game and aren't forced to play as miles for very long lasting missions. i don't dislike him or anything like that but i am expecting to play as the original spiderman and not his protégé.
Yes
i wish that the part of the history when peter is with the simbiote isnt short, i wanna play the entire game like that! Also im hoping that they announce this for pc
My guess is Peter goes emo and evil and miles has to take him down
Wonder if we’ll get another one in 2028
The graphics look they from 2017.
10:45 He catch de feesh
Holy sheeeeeershhh!
I love how the symbiote suit mimics a real suit, but has an unnatural texture to it
the gameplay looks phenomenal
Hoping this is a long game 🔥🔥🔥 it is very beautiful!!! I will be expecting dlc storys, good loads boss fights, loads side missions!!!! Hurry with pre order date!!!
i hope they put a scene when peter dancing on the streets
cool+++
I love that they’ve included Queens hopefully Brooklyn, Bronx, or parts of Jersey like Hoboken, or Union City
Only problem i see is how will changing suits work with the symbiote
I'm so hyped for this game, can't wait to play on my ps5
@11:31 that small detail where he just drops the civilian instead of placing him calmly. You can tell the developers be putting hard work with small details like that🤌.
I truly thought that they forgot about spider man 2 until I saw this on my home page. Cant wait
I like Miles is also part of the game and doesn’t get sidelined
The swinging looks so much faster in this game
top tier lizard iteration, top tier venomized spiderman and even topper tier evil peter
kraven reminds me so much of Rais from Dying Light not only the design of the character but also his voice
why do the cutscenes look kind of scuffed though?
....I may actually want a PS5 now
What were the Spider-Man games where the mechanics changed when we were in the black suit?  Spider-Man 3 Friend of Foe Web of Shadows  Did I forget any?
Bully Maguire is coming
So excited for this. Cannot wait.
Going to have to wait 5 years for the PC release
This guy basically what Predator would be if he were human
Stupid game for Mass market people. Facial animation are 10 years old. UE5 Is on another level.....
Miles vs Peter I called it!
IM BUYING A PS5 PURLY FOR THIS GAME
This looks like it’s gonna be exciting
Always a great thing to see some flaws in our superheroes' personality
My theory: Peter as the final boss.
nice
I wonder if Kraven will become Venom (*loosely* inspired by Life Story) Seems like the goo has already left Harry’s body and at the moment I don’t believe he’s got any reason to hate Peter, who is currently bonded with the symbiote Also I don’t think Eddie is fundamental in this particular context, despite him being the OG  Maybe at some point Kraven will be “umiliated” by Spidey, ultimately leading the Hunter to form a bond with the Symbiote (yes, perhaps this is out of character for him but they can find a reasonable reason to justify this) Btw I love the fact that web-shooters and web wings are “biologically” part of the Symbiote suit but hope he won’t turn into Venom
Venom in this game is gonna be fire
i've been waiting nearly 5 years to see yuri lowenthal as symbiote spider-man and now i'm hearing him for the first time
only complaint is blue venom blast
Kraven probably smells so bad.
Где русские комментарии ?
Not sure if Kraven or Angelo Bronte
Así que esa era la tercera jugabilidad que se mencionaba... No está mal pero... Pensaba que después de tanto tiempo (ultimate Spiderman) por fin podríamos volver a jugar con Venom ero mejorado y más genial... Pero no, jou :'T
One thing that really got me intrigued is the expansion that the map has, allowing us probably to explore Queens and Brooklyn, that is an important area expansion to explore in my opinion, even the rivers, bridge and docks areas that connect both island in New York is amazing!
Miles is worried about Peter’s personality change because of the venom symbiote
This game looks ridiculousky good. I hipe this isnt the best mission in the game they're showing us.
First School gets out then FNAF HW2 teaser now this could this day get any better!
Esta bien potente
Ended a whole bloodline right there 3:08
Is anyone else getting a similar vibe from Black Suit Spider-Man to season 6 Deku from My Hero?
Yup Yuri’s goin full sasuke voice in the Symbiote like I thought !!
Is it just me? Or are the graphics not as good as the last 2 games?
This is what we asked for bro let’s go this about to be perfect THIS COMPANY DOES GAME PERFECT
need a ps5
🔥🔥🔥
I've always loved the symbiote suit.  This is gonna be *great*.
I was gonna say that I hope there's not much miles gameplay in this game since its supposed to revolve around spiderman, but after seeing his movement I take it back
I get it, Symbiote bad *At least for now...only good thing out of Marvel Comics recently is Venom, LBH* but can you deny that for a little bit, it'd be heat having a Symbiote? ...A Symbiote that's not Carnage and not crazy thanks to past hosts?
Deadpool really?
wooo.. i guess this is the closest we got for prototype 3.. I'll take it.
pete’s sounding like sasuke these days
SHOCKEEEERRRRRR!!!!
I feel like it's probably wishful thinking but imagine if there were different endings/storypaths based on how often peter uses the symbiote. Like there are options to not use it which makes peters combat encounters harder but reduces how much his personality is corrupted, would make for amazing repeat playthroughs
This is so much what will we have to discover about the game?
This will be a game to remember
I screamed to the heavens when I saw the Symbiote suit on here I can't wait to play this game and use the Symbiote suit :)
Man, this game would be so much better if they kept the focus on Peter, just don’t care about Miles whatsoever and not looking forward to being forced to play as him through half the game.
the new U.I looks so clean
i'll wait pc
meh
Literally keep coming back to watch 😭😢 like my 10th time watching I can’t get enough this is gonna be a masterpiece literally 🤧🔥
This is about to be amazing
nah that kick combo at 3:12 was deadly
I’m aroused
I wish I had a ps5😢
This looks insane insomniac studios never fails
I really can't spot any red flags
I have this feeling Peter is gonna die and Miles will be the remaining Spider-Man
"peter dont do this I'm Spiderman, 2!"
Miles is going to end up having to fight Peter
This game is definitely gonna be a mix of Web of Shadows and Edge of time and I can’t wait 😄
When I heard him say connors my brain got excited
So excited to swing around queens !!
So I assume there's gonna be a part where miles need to fight spiderman then
That 30 fps is looking really fresh  Wake me up when it's on pc a year and a half from now
I have alot of questions. 1) how did Peter get the symbiote from Harry 2)what will Peter do to dr connors  3) how will black cat react to all this  4) will Peter kill kraven and is there a choice system in the game  5)who else will return in this game
RIP.. My poor 12GB VRAM when this gets ported to PC..
Wiiicked!!!
A year from now someone will tell us how nostalgic this is…
Am getting spider man web of shadows vibe when peter uses venom
SO EXCITED TO SEE THE LIZARD AGAIN
YOOOO THE SYMBIOTE SUIT LOOKS FIRE ON Spider-Man!!!!!!
Yeah, no, this looks terrible.
I think end of the game, Miles and Peter gonna fight
Epic
They could have made it better by showing Peter not caring or saving any civilians.    And if they wanted him to save civilians... They should have made HiM curse at the Civilians for wasting his time.   Also, scream at Miles for being useless... It would have sell better with the Casual Fans that Peter is different from HiD usual Self. Something is Off.   Make it more accurate to the source... Show him being a Jerk. Especially, when Peter seems to have this Suit for a while. With his Style of Use.
Bro idk how the game looks I will pay every person who helped make the game 20 bucks if their os a ps4 port
This is hype
Beautiful
I love everything about this.
The symbiote is definitely symbioting
Say hello to bully Maguire 10 years later
"He's got big teeth!" "So do I." I love the foreshadowing.
Bully Maquire
02:31
Am I the only one who doesn't like the look of the black suit?
This looks fantastic!
My favorite childhood hero ♥️♥️
I’m calling it rn, the trailer starts right when peter acquires the symbiote, which is why he’s so cocky using his new powers
GET BACK HERE SHOCKEERRRRR!
i wonder which would be the hardest / most heartbreaking: having to fight Peter as Miles or having to fight Miles as Peter.. 🤔
Just amazing ❤,legendary
The most important question, is there a bully parker in this universe?
co op?
When did spider msn grt thr symbiote?? Why is Miles cool with it?
I'm going to take a summer job just to save up for this and ps5 🔥🔥🔥
I am so happy for this ❤
incredible i cant wait to play it
Love the black suit design for this game, didn’t expect it to be so shiny and slimey. Really hope we also get to see Miles wear the suit as well!
WHEN IS THE PRE ODERRR
The depiction of Peter with the symbiote is perfect. Miles having his friend fly a drone makes perfect sense, the Lizard looks like a badass, and Kraven is the perfect fit for a venom story.
Yuri Lowenthal did another great voice acting. He’s bringing out that mad Sasuke voice line with Spider-Man
Please let this be on PC as well.
A new era of edgy Parker is coming friends!
Spider-Man PS4 is the best superhero game I’ve ever played. But this looks like it’s going to blow it out the water ON EVERY LEVEL😮‍💨
1:28 so that's the Wraith. She has become the Wraith 😮
まじで待ってた
OK take my money right now. This game is amazing. I’m already pre-ordering this. At least I will when it becomes available.
LET US IN
Umm am I dreaming?
Disgraceful that this isn’t on ps4 can’t just discontinue the series now when we finally got venom
Wow, the AI is probably the worst I've ever seen.
This probably the earliest I have ever been to a video like this. I thought it was a clickbait thumbnail at first until I saw that it was uploaded by the actual official Marvel Entertainment YouTube channel. Also, I can just see how this game is going to reignite the whole "GET BACK HERE, SHOCKER! SHOCKEEEER! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME! I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!" meme and the Bully Maguire memes lol. Also, I'm pretty sure all of those finishers at 2:43 and 2:58 and 3:14 definitely didn't just knock out those enemies lol... And man..., Yuri Lowenthal is killing it in the VA department and the gameplay is giving me "Spider-Man: Web of Shadows" of vibes which is a really great thing, 3:06 and 3:10 and 3:14 and 3:41 and 3:51 and 4:51 and 9:04 completely blew my mind and blew me away. Also..., that robot bird drone thing at 4:16 and 6:08 that Ganke hacked into and is using really looks like something Adrian Toomes would use rather than Kraven the Hunter lol. Also, the giant version of The Lizard is really reminding me of the giant version of The Lizard from the movie tie-in video game for Spider-Man 3 by Activision. Storywise, I'm curious to see how the Venom symbiote got bonded to Peter when it has apparently been keeping Harry Osborn alive in this universe.
LET'S GO!!!!!!!!! 🕸🕷🔥
This is history
This was like cocaine for my eyes for 12 straight minutes
The Exaggerated Chronicles of a Black Teen: Part Two
Glad to see Miles still has that exaggerated swagger
11:53 *Funky soul starts playing*
That was the fastest 12 minutes of my life.  I’m so excited for this fuckin game
this looks so good I can't wait till it comes out for PC ><
See you in 20 years when someone wants to replay this beautiful game
The Suit and Combat🤤... Reminds me of  Spider-Man: Web of Shadows
Can we agree that this game will have us all captivated for ages
During the stream, everyone was so mad at the begging because they thought it was far cry 592 or something, but then when they saw kraven, people went ballistic.
Duuuude!!! Literally the game every Spider-fan has been waiting for!!!
Terrible!
Can’t wait for the pc port in 2 years
New DLC 😮😅
commenting this so i can come back in a couple years 17 rn and life is shitty let’s see how i am when im back
At the beggining you can see Wraith, who is Yuri Watanabe in the comics. Nice to see she's still getting story since the DLC kinda delved into her more
Dude, Yuri lowenthal cannot sound threatening lol
I so hyped for this game! (I don’t have a ps5🍷🗿)
OMG just stfu and take all of my money
Oh my goodness! The gameplay, the graphics, the voice acting from Pete and miles, it’s all amazing! Insomniac, you did it AGAIN
ugh Miles is so annoying.  Guess I'll pass on this one.
This game looks like it's gonna be really good and im sure there will be a time that we will get a Spider-Man vs Spider-Man
This looks so good man.
No one’s mentioning you can probably enter every other boroughs of New York not just Manhattan
This is going to be game of the year
Gonna wait till they launch this game on PC 😅
Game of PS3?
If they could do a secret wars game I'll have hope
Where are the new swinging animations?!?!?
I can’t believe symbiote Spider-Man!!!!!!!!!!
I don't dig using the symbiote like venom. That's not the vibe when he first got that suit.
Is kind of funny how Ganke yelled when Peter and Miles through the drone even though he wasn’t the one being thrown.
The theme that keeps playing throughout this video reminds me so much of Dracarys!
I feel like Peter will be a boss fight in this game
Bro really pulled out that Sasuke Voice for the freak out.
This can't run on PS4? Common 😅
this black suit is bruh...
black spiderman lmao
Kraven kinda...
And the final boss is venom
Black suit spiderman is a menace
This is so insaaaaane 🥳🥳🥳
See everybody when you came back to this epic reveal
YOOOOOOO
Can't wait for this game to come out on xbox 360
The addition of the suburbs to new York, the revamp to the already stellar combat system and the ability to switch between miles and Peter ( long muted) were great touches. BUT this story I feel is going to give us everything we could hope for in a sequel. Please take my money already ! 💰
Muisc kind of sounds like Destiny 2’s pyramid jingle.
Cannot wait
the alley oop was crazy
I love watching this knowing im never gonna play it 🙃 (I don't have a ps5)
Am more excited about this game. New combat mechanics, great design, new characters, fresh and organic environments. Playstation5 owners we eating good!!!!!!!
Ganke IS controlling that drone from a remote distance, right? 'Cause I'm worried that his human body is dead and his consciousness is in that drone.
THIS LOOKS INSANE 😲🤩🤩🤩
He's got big teeth... So do I  Brooooo Chills
I’m proud to say that I was alive when this trailer released 😊😂
Looks terrible
0:42 I’m sorry but is that the destiny darkness theme?
I hope Mysterio and green Goblin are in the game
Why couldn't you have released in 2024 so totk and you could win
I like that it’s not a “suit made him angry” type of deal. Peter aggression was built up from the previous games.   Aunt may dying with Peter failing to save her. Martin Li, Osborn, Octavius, and Yuri all friends of his, turning to the dark side. With the span of a few months. He likely had a lot of aggression and anger from what happened that he bottled in
I need a ps5 wtf😑
Angelo Bronte survived the gator and killed it and became Kraven
Game of the year already🔥🔥
Peak, the story the writers of these games have made have been some of the best Spider-Man content in the last 2 decades
Fr this looks beautiful love the way the characters switch and I fuckin absolutely love the Symbiot suit look’s scary and spider man actually seems darker I love it
Looks amazing!
is this dlc  ?
I’m just happy I get to hear more angry sasuke
Insominac is cooking 🥵🥵🥵🥵
Where next-gen? looks like a ps4 game.
Yeah I’mma need Yuri Lowenthal to yell “SHOCKEEEEERRRRRR!!!” at some point in the game😂
Love it. Gameplay looks great and you can really notice the aggression in Peter, not just from his voice but his actions... like saving the guy and then throwing him to the ground, as if he's just getting in the way. Insomniac Games doing a great job.
Great now im incredibly depressed that im too poor to get a PS5
I’m so pumped for this game to release
Just go ahead and take my money bro
BROOOOOOOOOOO
I can't wait to play this on my PS2
Bro.. imagine Peter starts to eat people like in the movie that would be terrifying lol
Here before release
YEAGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
When Peter says "He got away from US" he's not referring to Miles, it's the symbiote peeking its way through his subconscious
GAME OF THE YEAR LFG
THIS IS GOING TO BE A MASTERPIECE.
Spidah-man
Bro now I’m even MIRE HYPED and not only that the new movie is coming in a few days 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hi
6:36 Yeah this game is going to be amazing
I want the Raimi's Spider Man 3 version of the black suit so bad in this game
I wonder if they'll make the black suit like they did in the old Spider Man 3 video game. Where the longer you wear it the longer/harder it is to take off. And maybe there will be enemies that are much easier to take down in the black suit so that the player is more likely to use it.
Crossover with MGS3 Remake?
I'm hoping that kraven doesn't kill the prowler
This is the only reason I I stayed loyal to Sony. Spiderman ps4 was a masterpiece and the closest thing to Arkham City🥹 i hope Sony brings back spiderman ps1
This game looks insane! I have a theory that I just thought about. I think they will change it up and make  Kraven become Venom and then he will hunt Peter and Miles that way.
Insomniac formatted shattered dimensions incoming
Cool idea for a game would be if you had all 3 of the spider characters if you want ti switch spiderman you go to one of the 3 cities 1 city gives you miles one gives you peter and 1 gives you gwen
bro i hope this comes to pc soon after the release this looks so good
Won’t be playable for a year or so probably. On PC atleast are my experiences. Looks phenomenal
I also love how it changes his voice as well, you can tell that this game is going to be so great!!!! The little mechanics, the gliding! Omg THANK YOU SONY AND INSOMNIAC!!
This game will be the best game on PlayStation
More like a game of the century 🦍🔥🔥🔥
I hope venom and the symbiote are already established in this universe. I hate how in so much new Spider-Man media, they have to do an origin story for everything. It would be more interesting if Peter already had experience with the symbiote in this universe, so he knows it’s dangerous. But he either feels like he needs its power, or he was forced to wear it.
its a good angle to spend time with symbiote pete. They kinda blow past that part in an effort to get to venom, but it will be really interesting!
This game of the year already
COOOPE
The way miles lightning zaps the symbiote off of the spiderman logo at the end is giving me major boss fight vibes 😂
I love how when saving that civillian Peter don't even ask if ge's okay or tell him to get to safety like he normally do as he,waa too absorb in his rage. He no longer friendly neighborhood spidernan but jus Spiderman
I love that Peters anger is OVERT, its little things. Not reaponding to miles like he always does, not being super nice to the civilians and just his general attitude. Love it. Edit: I meant isn't OVERT.
Looks amazing. The first game is one of the best comic book games of all time and this is looking to live up to the hype. Love the graphics, Black Suit Gameplay, Switching to both Peter and Miles And The way they're showing Peter darker side growing with The Dark Suit. Looks epic and can't wait. With This and Across The Spider-Verse next week this is the best time to be a Spidey fan.
holy
I hoped for Wolvering gameplay. Atleast this looked nice
Peter: you motherf***er!
Miles Morales, Craven the Hunter, and The Symbiote so possibly venom/carnage/ and symbiote combinations we dont usually see. We could have Craven and Miles symbiotes, hell even a mary jane or a JJJ symbiote would be cool.  This is going to be an amazing sequel.
Kraven, Lizard, and the black suit!! On top of that the bigger world makes so much more crazier!
This trailer isn’t historically correct because miles isn’t supposed to be swimming 😒
can't wait for H2ODelirious series hehehe ❤️❤️❤️
Oooo gloriaaa ❤😂😂😂
I bet that the actual Venom will be the final boss.
Top mais n gostei da parada de planar e ficar voando, tira a essencia do jogo.
WE GOT A CLASSIC
How, how, how did they literally perfect every detail of characters, gameplay and story  ?  I cannot wait for this too release
This is. bloody Mad sick!  Who else had their jaws opened all through.  ?
Bro somehow the swinging is even better
The wingsuit for Miles is going to be my favorite feature.
The art style/atmosphere of the part where miles is getting chased by the lizard REALLY reminds me of Maneater (shark game) for some reason, and the guy talking about the river also reminds me of the narrator for the game. Coincidence?…yea probably       OH, and Hunter being well a hunter chasing after the lizard reminds me of uh…something Pete from the game too!
AHHHHHHHHHH!!!
Consider me impressed. Never thought I’d see Spider-Man in the black suit going all out and to also see my favorite Spider-Man villain the Lizard. Anyways, I love this
I'm only gonna play this game if Miles gets to fight black suit spider man at any point. He only wants to help Peter, but Peter refuses to give up the suit and they have a huge fight. The whole point of the symbiote suit is for Peter to think he's doing better. When really, he's getting closer to the dark side.
DZAMN
hypeeeeee
Oh yes, he is gonna put some dirt in ur eyes
Kraven's Last Hunt???
Bro brought out his inner Sasuke
Let’s fuckin go
I love how the first 10 comments have the word love in them
What are these graphics
this game looks crazy
Imagine how crazy it's gonna be on pc with mods
The UI is so cool
But a good game by the way
I Love How They Show You How Peter Is Getting More Angered From Having The Venom Symbiote On Him In Only 12 Minutes of Gameplay We See Him Getting More Controlled Over And I Also Love How Miles Is Getting More Used To Of Being Spider-Man Can’t Wait For This Game and How Interactions and Villains will go This Game Is Going Be Insane.
Yes.
Peter is more aggressive and man-like, his voice is deep, (that's probably the symbiote actually) but this just seems so good. I think Tate will like Spider-Man after this
Love everything I'm seeing so far! I'm leaving a comment so i can go back to this when spiderman 3 comes out!
Can’t wait!!
All of this was ONE MISSION! My god this is better looking than most of the Marvel movies! Hyped!
I’m more hyped for this game!
I hope the other guy waiting for the 10 years, reply to this comment one day.
Notice how mile’s electricity is now blue meaning that his ability has gotten more powerful rather than when he first used it and it was yellow/orange
so good
Alex parker from prototyman
Oh man, Kraven's Last Hunt has been my favorite Spider-Man storyline since it came out years ago, (decades lol) so getting both a game & movie together with Kraven is like... *chef's kiss*   (also, plz don't screw up the movie SONY!)
wow…literally so excited
Give me online co op plzzzzz
"He's got big teeth" "So do I..."🔥 Pete's on demon time
Miles being chased by Connors had me on the edge of my seat lol
I’ve never heard Yuri sound so mean as Spider-Man. He’s good!
I hope we get a spin off for gwen stacey
Already a masterpiece
Is this now Spidersuperman? 🤣 But it looks good. Will definitively grab that 👍
I would say that this looked like a great episode from a spiderman TV series more than a videogame, much less a gameplay video... BUT they literally did the same thing with the first "gameplay" of the first game and it ended up being great so I hope it turns out just as good
this is looking godly. radio silence for almost year to bring us this heat. I almost lost my sh!! when miles pull out the wing suit
Spidey carrying this year harrdd
I love how peter sounds and acts aggressive in this.
This video means the Marvel needs to take my money.
Enjoyed watching it live, cant wait to play it!
The fact that you can ruthlessly physically assault multiple women has me sold 🤷🏻‍♂️
Yoooo this looks crazy dope I am going to finally buy a PS just for this
As much as I want to play this game, 1 game doesn’t justify buying a new console. Shame it’s not on PS4.
Графон вышел погулять.
The gameplay looks amazing I honestly can’t wait to play it man I don’t really care how long I have to wait
This game is already looking like game of the year material to me. Super hyped for this game.
More swinging animations for Peter please
im creaming
I have no idea how Insomniac is doing this.
Graphics looks downgraded.
this bout to be lit 🎉
This is amazing ! I love how the UI changes down to the quick time button’s depending on who you’re playing as! Symbiote suit looks amazing! And you can tell they really listened to fans when we asked to play as both characters and be able to switch back and forth 👏🏿 INSOMNIAC NEVER MISSES !!!!
well well venom comes into play. cant wait for this to be out
I least expected for a offline co op but that would have really add more to a masterpiece
Wow! That's gorgeous! I was thrilled with the first game, but I couldn't even expect this quality from the second game. Looking forward to the release.
Same swing animations 😒
"gameplay"
Insomniac allergic to dropping bad game they on a streak lol
Why is no one talking about mile being able to glide now!!!!! Lol
Only gta 6 can overshado its hype
Crazy!😈
Did I just hear the theme to the tremor tusk in there?
That’s cool but what about a daredevil game?
The graphics look so clean my god.
tooo sicckkk
bro this gameplay is fire and it isnt even finished this will be worth the wait
Goes crazy
Hiii from 2080
dang
Did you make it or is this real
We may have to fight peter in this game with miles. That looks like the direction they are heading in or the other way around.
LET'S BE HONEST & SAY THIS IS JUST PS4 GRAPHICS
Hope this gets released on pc. Like maybe 5 years later
Wow. I’m speechless honestly. Well done insomniac.
I was here. This game will be part of history.
This destiny ahh sounding music
its giving…preorder energy
As soon as I start miles morales they come out with this great
Me thinks a playable Eddie by the end.
I just saw Kaneki spirit in Peter, (im excited for this awesome game)
looks… alright.   web of shadows did it better.
When I saw Wraith’s picture, I got really excited (and also kind of scared).
this is INSANE!!
It's what Prototype wanted to be.
Between this, Dead Space Remake, RE4 Remake, and TOTK, I genuinely don’t know what Game Of The Year is going to be.
SHOCKER??? I WILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
I would love a series of peter keeping the symbiot and becoming the black king like Eddie did.
Uh oh. I’m gonna need to buy a ps5 🫤
The new gameplay mechanics and the dynamic ways you can approach during combat is well polished and designed, the cinematics went to a whole new level.
The effects with the black suit blew me away. I grew up off Spider-Man 3 on ps2, ultimate Spider-Man and Web of shadows ps3. The first game was already great but this looks like it’s gonna blow the first one out of the park. Gotta get a ps5 someday lol
The super slingshot, gliding, and making your own tightrope tho 🥰
JESUS FRICKIN CHRIST, I'M SO EXCITED FOR THIS GAME
THE SYMBIOTE SUIT LOOKS INCREDIBLE
Looks nice. Maybe they'll have a Spider-Man 2 bundle with PS5 for Black Friday this year.
I love the symbiote suit, it looks so sick and reminds me of the solo movies, but can we talk about Miles’ new powers? This guy is teleporting, sending his venom blast through people, and making them levitate. He got way more OP than Peter
I have no words. This is probably the most hyped I have ever been for a video game in my entire life.
Anyone noticed his eyes changed when he said "So do I"
Perfection
CHILL
I BIG likey
I was wondering why Peter was being so annoying then remembered he had the venom suit on lol
Venom is gonna be insane!
Soundtrack going to be pog
I have replayed the first game so many times, so excited to play this game
This looks sooooo good!
Most games on the PS5 that have me tempted are also on the PS4… This on the other is THE REASON I will get a PS5!!!! 🤟🕸
This Kraven already looks better than the movie version and we haven’t seen anything from that officially lol
GOTY
Miles gadget reminds me of Batman Arkham games.
woooow😳😳😳😳😳
Looks amazing, though miles electricity being blue then orange is strange.
Let’s go!
Prototype 3 looking great!
I hope they have Peter appear exhausted and reveal the “suit” has been taking his body on patrols when he sleeps. Or even go a step further and have that be a playable mission where Peter doesn’t say a word while out on patrol (maybe fight a villain that we’ve fought before and have them fear the change in his behavior) and at the end after defeating them we just return to bed with Peter not remembering a thing the next morning.  The whole sleep thing is one of my favorite things the symbiote has done while bonded with Peter in the comics and Spectacular Spider-Man.
very happy about the wing suit  very sad no improvements on web swinging physics
So is Spider-Man good or bad. I’m confused 😂
Has the vibe of old classic games but with the powerful new gen technology this is literally perfect
I like that it seems that this black suit spiderman seems to be feeding into the symbiotes anger because of his fear of losing people. He had to deal for years having had lost his uncle and recently his aunt and now his best friend is dying, he just doesn't want to lose more people.
It's really terrific and massive 👏 👌 lots of new features and techniques they are designed newly upgraded to spider man's new fighting and action combat styles are really amazing and terrific worth to play ▶️ lots of different way of making and storytelling I really loved it and very excited to buy it and play full game its really interesting as a 100% sure it'll be spider man fan visual treat experience and fulfilled and satisfied game for gamers love from India 🇮🇳 😊🙏👌 🎉
This looks amazing. Devs clearly took fan input to heart while still being creative and coming with new options. Can’t wait
Take my money
I love the little detail at 11:34 when Peter threw the civilian to the ground instead of putting him down gently. Peter's also more dismissive with Miles and more aggressive during combat. Words can't describe how I excited I am for this game to come out!
I hope they add Queens and Brooklyn to expand the map.
AY Cabron !!!!!!
Does Kraven frequent a barbershop for that cut?
miles? pass
Are they gonna account ban you if you put mods in to take out pride flags in game?
I would love to see spot in this game
Looks great! One issue I have tho is miles’ webswinging, While yeah miles would have more experience as Spider-Man by this point and not be as clumsy I don’t like how it seems to just be a copy pasted version of Peter’s, the webswinging difference in miles’ game brought a lot of flare and complexity to it, maybe a few changes in that department?
I don't want to get over my head... But maybe they got inspired from Prototype if Prototype 3 was ever going to be a thing someday I think they would go to the same approach with the symbiote fight style.
Wow, that's just all I can say.
I need to see Peter do the bully maguire dance at least once
I can tell that this is gonna be a great game.
Let’s goooo!
I'm interested in Symbiote Spider-Man's personality change
Why the graphics look like they are not sharp at all.. Don't get me wrong the game still looks great but I feel like graphically we are not even close to what we saw in the trailer that Insomniac gave us 2 years ago ...
Wonder if the symbiote will add onto Peter's webswinging in any way
This game seemed to fix pretty much everything that was wrong with the already great first game. Im ready to have this game in my hands.
This is gonna make me buy a PS5, God dayumm 🤤🤤
I love seeing Peter really take advantage of the black suits tentacles
Bruh
Same game
Im an Xbox guy but I would definitely buy a PlayStation just for this game
I am excited to see what part Kingpin will play. I think he threatened Miles in the MM game. Kingpin has tons of boss fight potential. The beginning of the first Spiderman game was great with Kingpin and made for a hell of a tone setter.  I also wonder what other sets of henchmen this game will have. Like obviously Kraven has a bunch of hunting looking dudes. I wonder what other kinds of regular bad guys there will be.
I just want Peter Parker not the knock-off.
i don't like the the ganke drone
Hopefully the main focus is on Peter and the symbiote
Hope the iron man game is like this
Yes.....this fall is looking amazing w/games.
2 hours agoooooooo ahhhh hyoeeooeoepepepeppe טאהאהאהאאה שני ספדיירמנןםםםםם מתחבר לסרט של מיילס מורלס אקיצר מגנבייביבייב coococlclclcl
oh to have a ps5
11:32 why he push him like tht LOL
I can see how Peter not holding back no more, he wants those guys dead
Bruh if Tom gets the symbiote soon I hope he fights exactly like this 🔥🔥
Marvel's Spider-man 2 = Spider-man webb of shadows 🤙
Please don’t let Harry be Venom.
The switch is so clean 😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥 I'm so hyped
Now this is my Spider-man
Wow
how tf he get symbiote?
Oh yeah, this series never disappoints. I love Peter's black Suit fighting and the gliding on both of them  The only nit pick I would say is that in some scenes it looks like they are just floating in the air, not gliding, not swinging, just floating, like at 8:15 after he passes under the bridge, he swings to go under the bridge, then sorta floats for one or two seconds going after the boat
During the fist game I was wondering when The Wraith was gonna appear but never did. BUT SHE'S HERE at 1:28 So good to see that Insomniac continued with Yuri's story too. This game is gonna be AMAZING! GOTY for sure
This game is reaching the perfection!
I can hear his Sasuke in his aggressiveness
let's hope they include the axe swing symbiote animation from WOS game
My God this is really good!
Am I the only one not crazy about the suit? I much prefer the OG basic design
"KARVEN! I'LL HUNT YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH KRAVEN!"
Bravo!! 👏🏻
I’m getting a ps5 just for this game
They fully utilized venom ability. This is beautiful to watch
Yeah we’re definitely gonna have a Peter boss fight as Miles. Could be interesting if you also have the option to play it from Peter’s side, with a darker ending if you win.
I love this new Peter! I’m anxious for this video game !! Can’t wait till it’s out !
How did Pete get the symbiote in the first place? Did they show it? What am I missing??
I don't see anything interesting in it, this game is boring and the modders made a better animation
I love how pissed off Peter sounds. This game will be so good. I just hope I don’t have to wait forever to play it on PC.
Guess I need to get a ps5. I haven’t been completely into the ps brand since ps2
I need to know if they made him look like tom holland again or Og spiderman ps4 face before i buy this game
Can't wait for a PC release in a few years. (I can but I'll be hyped while waiting for it.)
...WHEN....WHEN IS IT COMINV OUT....WHEEEEEEN!?-
KRAVEEENN
Holy shitake mushrooms, that action set piece is phenomenal, how it switches between the 2 spider-men & the use of their special moves, the tension & anger you hear from the voice actor for peter is outstanding. Im sooo hyped for this game
Kraven omg
Geezing 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
for a second, i thought the trailer was actually ending when they tilt up to the tree
Holy duck
More Symbiote, less Peter Darker, please.
I'm so glad they didn't pull any punches with the way Symbiote Spider-Man is characterized. I guess Spidey didn't pull any punches either.
It looks awesome but, Venom suit and games ui design is a little bad. I hope it will be fixed when the full game is out.
“No he’s mine” what a cold line, I can’t wait for this game to come out already😭
The voice acting for the venom in him goes crazyyy
This looks AMAZING!
Looks so good. But then as if Insomniac were going to let us down
Symbiotes combat reminded me prototype games for some reason. It looks amazing.
Marvel dropping this and instantly winning game of the year
Bully maguire return
Seamless switching and unique quests for each character is amazing. Game of the year coming up.
Its gonna be weird knowing one day this is going to be video game history
looks good
The way Miles says “He’s never like that” about Peter when he instantly notices how strange Peter is acting gave me chills. I love how well established the bond between both Spider-Men are in this universe and having Miles actively notice something was wrong with Peter automatically cemented this as one of the greatest new Spider-Man dynamics ever. Too bad the comics never explored anything like this when Miles got moved to 616, but I doubt modern Marvel Comics could do it as good as Insomniac anyway.
Too bad I'm out of money for ps5
Man oh man!, Web of Shadows eat your heart out.  This game's coming for the crown for best symbiote suit gameplay.
he's about to put some dirt in your eyes
better let you actually play as venom or else its trash
I might just cry
Insomniac is literally one of the very few game studios I can feel confident pre ordering something from nowadays…………and I think that says a lot about the current industry.
Güzel oyun
THIS IS AWESOME!
Sold get me a PS
I'm going to play this game a lot...... on youtube😭
I absolutely love the city and how bigger it looks
I know it's unlikely but i would really like The Symbiote/Venom to become a friend in this, I can't look at him as a villain after the agent venom storyline.
Who let bro cook😭
NO CO OP PLZ TY
If you like this, play Spider-Man Web of Shadows!
Venom got straight into the system 💀💀
Omg it's happening
Woooow Just wow
His suit is so CLEAN
This is beautiful!!!
Daqui alguns anos a gente volta pra relembrar esse jogo incrível.
The lizard looks exactly like killer croc from Arkham series
This is some prototype 2 level thing
Lord have mercy. I’m not ready for this
Peter Parker sounds like Eren Yeager now💀
Also ps5 power is insane insomniac is smart for not bringing it to ps4
THIS!!! The Symbiote Suit is GREAT not only does he look good but he acts the part too, He's Aggressive, Over Confident and you can see the Power fantasy/creep getting the better of him i hope we get him as a Boss as Miles. Kraven looks good the characterisation is there but the fact he didn't say "His AMAZING Hunt" Annoyed me lol. The Tendril Combat looks good some moves looked whack and choppy don't know if frame rate or graphics took a dip happened in the miles part when he was lifting up the garage door/shutter.  I PRAY they implement some sort of Co-op Would be INSANE And play into the "BE GREATER...TOGETHER."
Just saving a spot for me
Oh sweet, a new Prototype game is coming out!
Such an amazing reveal! I can already tell Miles is gonna have to face Peter as Venom. Im super excited
Where do I pre order
Weird lookin fortnite map 🤔🤔
Well done Insomniac.
PS3 game
When this comes out its most definitely gonna be game of the year
Que rico la aprietas Miles, im so HYPEEEEEED
Miles vs Peter boss fight is going to be legendary. I hope the final boss fight is Miles vs. Symbiote Goblin
Be so sick if the venom suit makes Peter kill kraven and that’s when petter knows this suit has to go and we get the venom battle
😍😍😍😍
So excited
Just take my money take it
This game is looking so good I can’t wait to see all the villains they have to offer with this
imma get you the battle pass miles
About to be the greatest game of all time 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
pre ordering as soon as I can
Suit looks ugly when it’s black wtf but overall great everything but venom
3:41 IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOVE FOR YEARSSSSS
W
Soooooooo is Spider-man a side character in his own sequel game?
...im sold!
Man this game is so detailed
Peter is really on demon time He is not holding back anymore
Imagine my reaction when i Saw the video and i realised it wasnt fake
Miles will definitely have to fight Peter
Xbox Séries please
Goty already
I am screaming currently
Wowsers
This is so clean 🥵🥶😮‍💨
All I seen is people talk about the symbiote but not enough people are talking about kraven
I will be there no matter what 😊
I have chills. Literal chills.
2023 is just too stacked man
That's already my favorite version of the Black Suit
I love the way peter actually uses the symbiotes special abilities, and it isn’t just a recolored suit, I’ve never seen it depicted in this way personally
Yoooo I can’t wait for this to drop🔥🔥
I’m sooooo excited
AMBATAKUM W  GAME
I can't believe that this is real is this real?
I love angry Peter, he's just: GET BACK HERE, SHOCKER!! SHOCKEEEEEEER!!!! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME! I'll CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EEEEEEEEARTH!!!!!
Wow just wow
Ok well I guess I'm buying a PS5.
W game bro, cant wait for this to release
.
Is his face the og one or the Tom holland one
I really didn't expect Kraven, I bet sony pushed hard for it because of the movie.
ill be scared if i was peter enemy
Dude I made a GTA related joke way back when about “Seamless Character Switching” I didn’t expect it to come true
Spider mans going to be a boss fight for Miles to release Venom isn’t he
It seems like the boss fights in this game have become more advanced
YES SO EXCITED the suits, the gadgets, the gameplay, everything.
Do you guys think we will have Peter with the symbiote for the majority of the game? Or maybe like 50% and then Venom shows up? This scene on the trailer seems early on but no so much, maybe like halfway of the game.
Dude this is incredible. The attention to detail is incredible.
Gliding!!!!!!
I pray that this will be on pc when it releases!
Insomniac Games keeps hurling lightning 🍻❤  Based on how much is going on, and the obvious mention that Peter knows something about Harry dying, I'd say that this is somewhere in mid game. That is to say that it's not the big dynamic opening scene that each game has. I am excited to see what the opening big bang is this time. The mall chase to the fight with Rhino in Miles Morales was really dynamic and fun.  I think those my favorite parts of the games: The big dynamic bossfights that weave between button mashing fighting, and quick time events where you're somehow leaping through and around the impossible. Also, the big giant "save the day" events like when Miles saves that whole bridge. Also loves the Shocker bank fight and the Electro chase in the first game.
THIS LOOKS BEYOND AMAZING, CAN'T WAIT!!!
Wow! CGI fights bore the hell out of me in movies, bu the work in games! Very exciting!
If miles beats venom pete this game is racist.
Matpat is the voice actor for angry Spider-Man???
I LOVE IT
No chance at beating Tears of the Kingdom for game of the year, doesn’t matter how good this game is
cant explain the hype i have for this game !!!
The Lizard looks like a baby Godzilla
This is gonna look insane
So when the Symbiote bonds with Eddie later does that mean venom Will know who Miles is to later and his loved ones getting very interested
This is so good
Oh symbiotic he’s coming
I tell you what I know for certain. Shocker better watch out. This guy will follow him to the ends of the earth.
the venom Peter gameplay 🔥🔥bout to be game of the year easily
SPOT RESERVE!!
OMG the lizard, Kraven, reference to the wraith, web gliding and doing the birth of venom story as well as Kravens last hunt! Just when I think insomniac can’t impress me or have tricks up their sleeves, they go and present this!
11:49  The music is so menacing. Peter, what have you become?
Moment of silence for Spider-Man fans who died over the years not seeing this masterpiece 😢
When Peter launched the drone at the other drone. Was Ganke yelling like he was getting Kamakazed?😂
YES M9!!
This whole trailer will be a waste if they don't add those puddles everyone bitched, on god
Nah bro this game is gonna be crazy 😮😮😊😊😊
Peter’s personality in this clip is very reminiscent of his portrayal in the animated series when wearing the symbiote suit: cold, angry, aggressive. I can’t wait to see more of him when the game releases.
Calling it now, we’ll play as Miles in a boss fight against Peter
As a Xbox gamer I am punching the air!!!!
Honestly, I don't like this so much... Dude, I feel like this is the same thing, just Spiderman black and he has some news move, but I was waiting for a something different, I dont know but I really like this 2:49 something to add more dificult in the gameplay but really sorry
Welp, here comes Bully Maguire 🕷️
Olha esse venom 😱
Wonder if MJ & Peter will broke up again due to Peter's behavior especially with the symbiote taking hold upon Peter
Insomaic is the future📈
I like the symbiote spider-man's gameplay with giving him tendrils. Gives me shattered dimensions vibes
I’d honestly be shocked if somehow miles bonds with the symbiote. I’d really like to see the tasm 2 suit and the black rami suit and there was a feature I really liked that the pc Spider-Man did which was web climbing would love to see that in this game.
The suit looks weird
The anger and aggression in Yuri’s voice while Peter is in the black suit is terrifying. I love how Miles catches on to Peter’s strange behavior and that the symbiote is altering him.
my reaction : 🥺
ngl as cool as it is to see peter with symbiote powers, I felt like they could've let that out of the trailer. Would've been a way bigger (pleasant) surprise to see it happen in game
just a movie game. nothing new
I cant wait to play this man
This is epic
suddenly, i desperately want a PS5^^
So when are y’all Xbox lovers gonna admit it…
Someone please make an Alex Mercer from Prototype mod When this release
Halo bang yang dari masa depan wkwkwkwk - 25 Mei 2023
He finna screw miles up i know
MY HEALTHBAR! All my progress getting my health up to 250 gone
This is everything I wanted and more… everything about the symbiote is absolutely breathtaking
Why can't we just play as spider man? Spider man 3 will we have to play as a one legged lesbian transgender as well? I just wanna play as one hero (spider man) not his multitude of wannabe side kicks. I didn't buy Gotham knights for the same reason
yoo at 12:20 you see the logo taken by venom and then venom destroyed by electricity, i bet spiderman gonna be a boss for miles
Is this supposed to be Spider-Man 2 or Miles Morales 2? 🤨
“Spider-Man, it’s got defenses.” So, I guess rage makes Peter not have common sense and makes his spider-sense null and void. Or we shoe-horned in Miles being smarter.
Some were saying how bad the graphics were.  silly
finally there's gameplay
- All I hear from Peters voice is Sasuke and I love it
This may go down as the greatest Spider-Man game ever
def buying a PS5 just to play this game.
11:33 Miles is like "ey bruh watchu doin???" 😭😭😭😭
I love how when peter saved that guy he just threw him to the ground right after 😂
TAKE MY MONEY
im 29 in 10 years💀🧓
Peter dark ark coming in hot!
I am thinking either venom or Spiderman in venom might be the big boss at the end...
Why this Peter sounds like emo Sasuke? 😂
I hope this comes to PC sooner rather than later
Wow this is insaneeeee!
This game is going to be amazing.
The biggest shock they could’ve done at the end was have Peter takeoff his mask and show they return to using the old model for Peter’s face
Bro I swear to my aunts grave, I will buy an Ps5 just for this game, even if this means selling my sister (somebody interested?)
I’m buying a ps5 just for this literally… I didn’t think the game I wanted was gonna be made but seeing this, I think it’s coming…
great now i have to get a ps5
Finally, I have a reason to buy the PS5
Oh yeah. Feelings are getting hurt in this one
when peter claims to say he has "big teeth" i hope they show the original version of venom where he is more bulky with claws for peter when he doesnt have full control
Duuuuuude! The voice tone change of Peter with the symbiote is chilling! Like this is gunna be an amazing game. I can’t wait!
This looks good.
80% QTE
Im been a Spider-Man fan for years,   one of the best villains ; kraven the Hunter Always showed him wanting an equal,  A challenge  The greatest hunt of all time  That man was Spider-Man  Kraven has always been one of my favorite Spider-Man villains,   and they got him down to the teeth
I mean it ok
This looks decent. Why can't xbox make anything AAA like playstation.😂
This game is gonna be sooooo awesome
On the map I saw Prowler, Wraith, Tombstone, Lizard, Taskmaster, Kingpin, and I think Shocker
Hell Yeah ❤
Will return after an Era
We have all just witnessed greatness
Thanks for visiting after 10 years..this game is still going strong
Alright based of this the venom concept so cool how Peter more aggressive toward people even after we beat venom i how we can still pay as venom
It is really great to see such an amazing job done by this team!
Guys, if after 10 years this will be an obsolete game, reply this comment
Does this mean we get to go to queens?
Oh, im definitely gettin this 😏
I cannot wait to play symbiote suit Peter so badass
This game looks amazing my god
Set playback speed to 0.25 at 11:32 to see Bully Maguire.
So far the game is looking great! Can't wait to play it.
Prototype vibes!!
IF THIS AINT GAME OF THE YEAR IDK WHAT IS BRUH
is Pete gonna turn evil/ bad cause of Venom this game? I hope we get to fight him
The web wings that allow you to glide is cool but it further exacerbates the problem from the first game: You never really did need to care if there are buildings nearby to swing from. You press down on R2 and move forward and you'll perpetually swing. Now the gliding mechanics make it EVEN easier
The graphics are just amazing we just want a good story and this is going to be the game of the year easily
Playing as Spider-Man with the symbiote suit is gonna be insane 😱
I’m literally soo excited!!!! I’m gonna get it soo fast!!!💗✨ 🧚
AAAAAAHHHHHHH
Black Spiderman will always have a special place in my heart 💫
Will return after The era
Niceeee
Exclusive to PS5
This looks hype!
Spiderman never dissapoint
Really hoping for no forced mj stealth missions
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
I’m so amazed by the brilliance of this
got peter parker soundin like christopher daniel barnes wit this symbiote shii 😂😂
Can't wait to bbs play this and watch him
Daddy Peter
This looks freaking awesome!
Peter would never throw a civilian to the floor like that, thats the symbiote
At 3:04  "Hes gonna wish he never came to New York" Spidey sounds like MattPat here 🤣
Spider-Man is starting to sound like sasuke
wow peter seems more violent than ever
I love how this is much more violent and dark. It gives me prototype vibes
Точно выбью платину ✨🔮✨
ah it reminds  me of the time I played the amazing spider man 2 on my ps 3 I just feel so nostalgic
1:34 shocker is alive??
Well i got to say, since no one is talking about it. 1: Alot of the web swinging animations seems to be reused. 2: The first 2 square hits seem to be reused aswell. If isnomniac really wants to  hit this out the park, they got to stop re-using things. I am Disappointed of the combat and swinging. To the swimging there seems to be no physics again like the old 2018 Spider-Man. 5 years they had timr minus maybe 1/2 on Miles Morales, and still this seems to be laking. All i can hope for is that they may have holden back some of the animations, but not more.
Насилие, злость, убийство... вот что пропагандируют детям разработчики видеоигр.
1:55 anyone else stuck at this tree looking for someone spying on them ?? cant see anything lol
"Be greater TOGETHER" so is Co-op confirmed or not??
Hope the PC port doesn't take a whole year.
They NEED this Kraven in the MCU PRONTO!!
Lizard vs Kraven Peter slowly deciding into Madness from the black suit getting Spider-Man 3 vibes with a hint of miles from this gameplay can't wait to play this game
Wtf is miles flying?? Hes to overpowered as it is with the stealth and bio electric abilities. I feel like peter is being side lined.
Oh, its so great seeing a trailer that you KNOW is gonna live up to the hype, and not disappoint, like 90% of games do these days. Please.....take my money!!!
Hey Banjing, one day you will see this comment while you watch everything related to this game after completing it. I love you my son! How’d you like the game?
"Are you sure? He's got big teeth"  "So do I..."   Heheheh Bully Maguire is back
I wish we had a remake of web if shadows.
This game looks so different. Thank you for changing so much of the game unlike the last one
I’m so hyped for this game 🔥
Cost of living crisis in the UK and im ready to spend money on this game with no regrets 💯🥳
I was hoping for a playable venom. But black suit spidey to that degree is a very close second
The eyelids at 11:54 gave an instant Web of Shadows flashback, this game will deliver everything I needed.
this is amazing, attention to detail? perfect. listening to the fanbase and giving them what they want? perfect! giving a good overview of the characters and where they stand? absolutely perfect.
This looks so awesome. I can't wait. Loving the look of the venom suit, the aggression and how Miles notices the change to Peter's attitude. Hope that Miles actually fights Venom suit while Peter fights from within. Can make a very sick cutscene
Wow, suuper impressed with how alien feeling the symbiote suit is. The grotesque looking tentacles are so nasty, i love it
Sales for this game will be even better if it also drops on PC right away.
this is the game that will make me finally buy the ps5
Insomniac is the last bastion of superhero games
This had me hyped then I remember Peter still got a baby face. Still excited for this new story tho
when will they realize that these games would be 100000% better IF a friend could play as miles doing his part at the exact same time as you across town THEN meeting up for a final banger. also letting the two of you free roam. Doesnt need to be live action service with loot. Doesn't need to be massively multiplayer. Just straight old school two player co op.
Holy crap this looks amazing. Spectacular even. And a whole bunch of other choice adjectives jameson uses.
I do hope we get the lab coat look, since it's implied Lizard has multiple stages in the game. I could see him starting with the lab coat and then shredding it as he gets bigger.  This also seems to suggest Queens and Brooklyn will be explorable!!! I've been wanting that for so long, hope it's legit and not just select story sections. That "Astoria Piers" sign excited me waaaaay too much as an Astorian.
I am scared/worried for Pete
Only problem is I’ll never wanna play as miles again 💀
اريد تجربة اللعبة لو يظيفونها على ps4
Worth the wait !!!
its just like web of shadows when u change red to black😲
Mantap
Hola :v
I really did not expect much from the symbiote suit - kinda just thought it was gonna be a black retexture of the original but that thing looks amazing!!! I like how they kept the swing style the two had from their first games while still making it better. Can’t wait!
I’m assuming it’s because this is sort of a demo but it looks like a major graphics downgrade
I'm all in for Spider Man 2. Hope we can get DLCs too. Hope Morbius is in a DLC
Love how Peter sounds so angry and annoyed in every line. Symbiote be working it's magic
Le spiderman versions venom putains j'attendais sa de fou il l'ont fait bordel et cette image cest effet de lumières 😮 comme vous dite cher vous i love ny ❤ respect au développeur et tres hate de le tester mon dieux 🥲😵‍💫🤤
I am still digesting the fact that sony decided to abandon the ps4, saying they want to take advantage of the new gen, but in reality they are just forcing people to upgrade.
Going to love it.
You know there's gonna be a Bully Maguire reference somewhere in there lol.
Spider turned into Sasuke Uchiha I’m down with it
I doubted this game at first but it looks good , sequels are never as good
YOOOO THIS LOOKS SO SICK!!!!! ITS PIZZA TIME!
Instant pre order as soon as it’s available
While I appreciate the combat mechanics in the game, I have some reservations about the appearance of the black suit. Compared to other media, it lacks seamlessness, and its design has room for improvement.
3:10 bro bot only beat him but his entire future family lineage
is this a game .. i thought its just a movie  played with 2 buttons
Everything is AMAZING. I just hope the graphics get better.
Cant wait for this game to release then have to wait 3 years for it to get on pc
oh my God the combat is so exquisite and looks so smooth
i can't wait for this game and i love how they handled the symbiote and can't wait to see the whole story!!
miles and peter are for sure fighting eachother
Web of Shadows 2 looks good
This game looks sick! Can’t wait to get my hands on it lol
I can't be the only one who noticed they teased Deadpool in this game??
Real
I like how warm this game looks compared to the first two games
I hope they both get their own final bosses
Love the spider man black symbiote suit gameplay looks incredible
11:32 "Thanks, Spider-Ma... OW!!"
insane time
This is the best game I have ever seen😍😍😍
Oh man these graphics are beautiful. I want this game so bad
3:50 ah roxxon plaza....cant believe its been almost 3 years since the miles morlaes reveal trailer
cries in ps4
CAN'T WAIT.
Alright, hello future gamers wanting to relive this soon to be goty ! Don’t be shy, say hi back and let me know what year you guys are enjoying this game on !
Insomniac is the best!! This trailer was SO GOOD. Cannot wait to get my hands on this game.
Am I the only one who noticed that Aunt Mays house aswell as Queens looks almost identical to how it looks in the Ultimate Spiderman game
Miles' Venom power is now blue and yellow. Blue is used for combat since blue lightning is stronger than yellow. And yellow was used to over charge the hunter drone, basically sabatoging. Yellow electricity is the color of electricity going through a conduit.
They made miles too op.....gliding, electric power, and invisibility.
i love how they create their own way of doing things instead of movie based story and characters
0:17 achei muito humilde darem uma oportunidade pro Bolinha do Pânico na TV aparecer no jogo
I love the fact that like the Arkham series, they haven't changed the games at the core but have added to and refined the mechanics. Feel like a lot of game sequels flop because they try to be completely different games when fans need that familiarity between installments.
I'm crying RN. It's perfect in every way! 😭 The way the symbiote is almost like an alternate fighting style JUST like in web of shadows as well as seeing Miles's electricity power evolving so much. Insomniac, please take all the time you need
Agent Mobius is going to lose it when he sees those jet skis
Looking at the combat with the black suit, just imagine how insane the boss fight against Venom will be.
Yo boy's bout to explode
Woooooooow
I like the first game we play as both peter and miles its when peter has the symbiote. I hate to sound cliche but shut up and take my money
This genuinely looks so good
this looks unreal
@2:22 I feel like they were referring to Venom rather than Spiderman and didn’t expect a newly amped Spiderman to come out
Ni en Mario e visto tantos personajes reciclados, ajajjaja XD
Im the real villian here because im going to make sure none of you MFers can play this game bwahaha😈
Wow
Might have to buy a PS5
Am I the only one still picturing the original face when hearing spideys voice, just can't imagine these lines coming out of the new models face
I hope that we use miles morales to fight against Peter at a some point of the game
The best thing i’ve ever seen
That was so worth the wait. This game looks amazing! Well, time to have the same goal I had before, but this time succeed. That being get a job so I can buy a PS5 and play this game.
They're finally using the symbiote to its fullest potential unlike Spider-Man 3
Mid
I love when companies actually listen to their fanbase.
My body is ready for this game
Holy moly!
This looks so sick
That Alley Oop dialogue was Unreal 5.2 level of cringe.
Dang...the first one I played; already felt like one. Now there's VENOM!! Freaking awesome
bro is gonna become a final boss im sure of it
I hear backugo from my hero academia just a little bit
Yo people from the future sup
Ganke: _”He's not...normally like that, is he?”_  Miles: _”No, he’s _*_never_*_ like that.”_  That gave me *chills.* Top-notch writing and voice-acting there (👏)!
I can’t wait
I hope see in futur same Spider-Man black suit attack with Tom Holland !
12 minutes of PURE Ecstasy!!
Pa cuando algo de él de wolverine
That is not a final gameplay graphics I am right
"He's got big teeth" "So do I"  coldest spider man line ever.
at least we got something on the new spider man game and not a basic trailer, plus the gameplay looks insane, especially the new venom suit one can't wait to play it
Oh how my boy miles has grown
Angry Peter is a dif bread 😈
Still hoping they make daredevil a game or let him be in the spider-man games
At least Marvel hasn’t ruined the games......yet🤞
I love the spider man symbiote, and from what I've seen, his personality with the alien and the sinister details of the outfit is impeccable.
I was looking forward to seeing more of the chain-linking fighting combos from Web of Shadows but they’re really leaning in to the brutality of the symbiote suit. Which I think will be interesting to see how deep and fleshed out they go with and Peter’s new abilities
How did Miles know about the defense system on the gunship  at  9:19 ?!!
I love that they're adding the web wings to glide around
When did Peter gain his symbiote suit?
This is giving me flashbacks to web of shadows, and I FREAKING love it.
Kraven looks like Elias.
Miles must stop Peter from using black suit because it’s racist.
Lizard hunt giving off killer croc in Arkham knight vibes
That “he’s gonna wish he never came to New York.” @ 3:04 was pure Evil!!! Yuri is going all out!!!!
YES!!! Stealth 🥷 TAKEDOWN are hope there as good as the Amazing Spider-Man Game
So I'm confused do u Play as Pete or Miles?
Me in 5 years hello 👋
wow
Uuuuuuu. Spider-Man sound a lil spicy wit da dark suit 💅🏽
I'm sensing a big Bully Maguire energy in this one..
“Be greater together” they say with their exclusives
No, no no no no no no no no the black suit 2:35
cant wait to see the tiktok montages tbh amazing game 10/10  this might even out do the 1st one
Not sure what explanation they’re going with in universe but in the comics Peter only wore it cuz he thought it was a futuristic suit, not a living organism. So when he wore it, it wasn’t slimey or anything like that. That being said, there’s no way he doesn’t know that suit is living lmao.
11:32 peter just throws the guy lmao
Ok, I'm really bad on English, but hey.  Well, gameplay epic, but old animation on web swings, it's strange.
I been waiting 2 years bro 😩
Amazing
11:54 His eyes get pointy, that's a nice detail
I love that we can switch between characters in this game. That’s gonna make it feel like Grandtheft auto five.
MY JAW HAS BEEN DROPPED THE WHOLE VIDEO MAN...
Oh my god this game looks so good
GAME OF THE YEAR ALREADY.
I hope there will be Agressive symbiote Spiderman boss fight
The game looks very well done! But it needs more fluidity and i think the symbiote suit shouldnt look that robotic. Hope they make these changes!
Just give every marvel character to Insomniac please!! This is beyond upgrading to the PS5 for 🙌🏾🔥
trailer pica
im so happy they take their time to make these games
I also have the feeling that somewhere down the story of the game, Peter and Miles will have to fight each other because of the symbiot and the behavior changes on Pete
Yoo prototype 2 flashback with that gameplay symbiote omg
These games feel like a love letter to Spider-Man fans ❤ thank you insomniac
Repent before it's too late!!!!!📛🤗  Revelation chapter 22
@3:46 BRUH.... i need this GAAAAAAAAAAAME  *brain melts
Horrible Venom costume design IMO. Other than that, looks great
Friend told me to watch. This looks sick (I don’t have a ps4 I have a switch lite that’s slightly broken)
No more fast travel maybe? Just certain points on the map where you can engage in a form of superfast travel?
You can really tell why the game was delayed they needed to add so much new stuff that the first game didn’t game HYPED
This game looks great however I feel like there is too much going on with the HUD and stuff like flashing, make sure to keep it simple like Spider-Man 1
I hope 10 years from now people will look at this video and remember the hype they felt. And read this comment and think to themselves, “It felt like I read this comment yesterday”
I can imagine craven   going on a murder spree like he could kill the prowler and miles boss fight could be craven or something
The IA looks stupid as hell like the first game.. I hope I’m wrong, honestly it lowered so much the game quality to me
I do not like Petes venom suit but it won’t matter cause I’m sure they’ll put multiple versions of it like the one from 90s tas and the spectacular Spider-Man symbiont suit
u telling me that i cant play this game on PC for awhile? this is a crime
que obra de arte madre mia
Imagine if Punisher shows up? 😩✊️
Norman… what have you brought to our city?
But am I the only one who thought Queens looked kinda.. ugly? And those water physics?
9:01 sigh.. Spidey still goes into his swinging motion before he shoots out a webline. Guess it's not something they bothered to improve on from the first game
hello me in however many years when this trailer came out, truly nostalgic
Omg this is so sick
In my opinion, the gameplay looked a bit underwhelming but hopefully it’s good, the game has a weird color to it, the combat looks kinda clunky but the game isn’t out yet so 🤷
Is it viking first ?
Graphics look kinda dated, especially the water sequence, but no doubt it will be a banging story
one of the greatest gameplay trailers of all time.
Oh yeah, this will be a day one purchase
Now that a demonstration of symbiote right there, they have to add Sam Raimi Black Spider-Man suit please. I already love this game👌🏼👍🏻❤
🔥🔥🔥
Is Eddie Brock going to appear later in the story ?
GAME OF THE YEAR
I feel this game is gonna make that Arkham Asylum to Arkham City leap in quality. Im very excited for this
:D
Bro😳😳😳😳😳
All I hear is Sasuke Uchiha. I’m all for it
"he's got big teeth" "So do I"
Lobe
This looks amazing, except the water, that just looks like san andreas.
Final fight of the game is going to be Miles VS Parker to get the black suit off. Calling it now.
I like how he lets his anger get to him and almost got caught by kraven because of it
Now let's juat hope they bring Peter's old face model back.
Yuri pulled out the sasuke voice for this
I hope it comes out on pc
Wow that frame rate is pretty rough. Hopefully they tighten it up for the release.
I LOVE SPIDERMAN WOOHOOO
I’d be disappointed if the swinging mechanics are the exact same. Let’s hope they take a physics based approach.
This. Looks. AWESOME!!!
This has to be game of the year
I think this ends in MILES VS PETER 😭
Bruh the symbiote powers look so freaking good
wow...just wow.
you're basically watching a movie and pressing a button here and there
I'm buying a ps5 for this game😁
Why is Peter still like friendly to Miles & civilians when he has the symbiote on?
....GAMERS ARE EATING GOOD THIS YEARR. TEKKEN 1, STREET FIGHTER 6 AND NOW THIS
SPOILERS: the leaks shows that in the beginning of the game Peter and Miles will fight Yuri since she is killing normal criminals. The main side villains for the game will be Lizard, shocker and Mysterio. Kraven will be hunting you throughout most of the game and will die by Peter. You’ll be able to switch between miles and Peter throughout the game. You will also be able to play as Eddie Brock in sections that was similar to MJ in the first game. Harry actually won’t be venom in this game but more as a plot device for majority of the characters. Peter attends the Symbiote mid game and gains new powers. Later on you play as Miles and fight Peter. Then Eddie Brock will attain the Symbiote and become Venom. The final boss is Green Goblin and Venom as the penultimate boss. They’ll be some major deaths and a BIG teaser for the next game. Based off the gameplay trailer some of the leaks seem to be correct. Keep in mind this is leaks, but I’m pretty sure most of this is true.
Love it love it love every bit of it just wish I had the system to play it on but I’m good with watching videos for now
*So far, I'm whelmed.*
Finnaly🎉🎉🎉
This is hypeeee!!! Can't wait for Wolverine also!!!
FINALLY! BULLY MAGUIRE! GONNA CRY?
This is a great opportunity for them to have a Symbiote Infected City, just like Web of Shadows.
The gliding and the slingshot mechanics are amazing
TAKE MY MONEY!!!!
What a game this looks like its gonna be. So much we saw in so little time. I can't wait to see more. Insomniac are gods at this.
So definitely we gonna see green goblin here soon
Bruh imagine the ps5 sales after this  if you dont have one  rn i hope you guys can get one later
Mile’s venom changed color?
The animation, the new moves, pete kicking that dude on the wall just for fun. As Miles would say "Amazing!"
God this just makes me want a new Prototype game so f**** bad…
Game of the century im calling it
I WAS NOT expecting the symbiote suit reveal so early. . .
🔼⏺️⏹️✖️ goat console!!!!!
Spider-Man 3 black suit or I riot
😃 Awesome
This symbiote Peter seems like the kind of person who'd be willing to kill to protect the people he cares about
SLINGSHOT!!!
Yuri Lowenthal sounds a lot more like Sasuke as Symbiote Spidey.
Habra mas mundo espacio de nueva york este nuevo juego 1:33
Loved the part where the Lizard said it’s Lizing time and Lized all over the place
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Okey take my credit card 💳 🫰
This looks AMAZING 💯🤯🔥
wowowowowowoowow
OMG
i wonder if kravin will become in a lion just like in spectacular spider man
Okey take my credit card 💳 🫰
I just got platinum for the first game. Today lol
Ok, so I have a question.  Well not just one, I have *all* the questions.
Evil Peter is in home 😈🔥
Marvel just give Sony all the rights to execute the Marvel Video Game Universe! Holy smokes this is insane!
Anyone else think Symbiote Spider-Man sounds a lot like Sasuke Uchiha? (I know they have the same VA)
It will come out next year
PETER SOUNDS AWESOME
3:44 The way he leaps off of rooftops and flips backwards to face the camera before falling into a head first dive is just full of the exaggerated swagger of a Black teen. It gives me goosebumps every time he does it.
Hold up!!!!this game gonna be sick …. Let’s gooooo!!!!
This is a candidate for Game of the year so excited!
To be honest, I never expected to see the bully maguire storyline in a video game
So PUMPEF
The way he to tossed the civilian to the ground after he saved him 😂 Goes to show that the symbiote is definitely effecting his behavior
What did I just watch, good lord this game is going to be amazing!
Oh jesus christ on a pogo stick! spiderman black suit in modern day graphics! oh yeah! miles morales ruined it for me, not a fan of two spideys.
Seeing Spider-Man use the venom symbiote in ways that aren’t just what Spider-Man does normally is cool
*BULLY MAGUIRE IS BACK* !!!!!!!!😂
That was incredible, insomniac, u have outdone yourself
yuri’s voice is giving off strong spider-man the animated series viibes. especially when he says connors’ name
Game of the year 🔥🔥
So, Sony can't get over Venom, can they?  I used to love Venom comics back when he/Eddie was an anti-hero but back then he wasn't so much in Spidey's comics and it was fine, it can take it, Spidey has enough cool villains and stories for that.  This Venom obsession is overhyped.
11:54 Love that little detail there, "So do I.." and the eyes on his "mask" turning into Venom's design. "Chief's kiss"
He blocked a moved that was suppose to be unblockable and then slammed 4 guys with the symbiote tendrils
That lizard design is goated, actually scary. Shoutout to amazing Spider-Man for making him look like a dork
Dude I'm all for this game, Fighting Venom, Kraven, Green Goblin, Lizard. It's gonna be insane
Aw jeeeeez. This Peter is VICIOUS with the symbiote lmaoooo
I love how when wearing the Symbiote his whole personality changes and it’s very evident oh man this story is gonna be wicked but alas (Cries in Xbox)
First
This is the game that’s gonna push me to buy a PS5
I don’t like the black suit at all
I liked this new Prototype 3 game.
The only thing i thought was kinda dumb was miles using the drone to water ski
You had me til you switched to Miles…trash bland character
What we can gather: -Yuri is Wraith now -They need the Lizard to help with Harry -Peter already has the black suit -Hopefully we don't get a Goblin tease and actually see him
I cant get over the fact we have character switching, symbiote gameplay, and web-wings all finally confirmed. This is the only game I’m ever going to be confident pre-ordering.
ngl venom suit look kinda mid
Not paying for Kang Spider-Man
i love miles new lighting actions
Fighting Peter as Miles is gonna be sickkkkkkkk
THIS IS NEXT LEVEL MAGNIFICENT !!
Looks good!
I didn't like how the term black is like in the venom movies, for me it was better for the black suit to just be a suit without those tentacles, but I'll wait to see that in the final game
web of shadows energy
Hola weones del futuro :v, saluden a este comentario del pasado, que buen trailer lpm ❤🥵
YES
I love it ❤
Yuri Lowenthal gets to go full Sasuke on this one, I see...
is spider-man voiced by sasuke
If we are seeing Venom in this game, will there also be Carnage? It would be great to see him in a game other than the Amazing Spiderman 2
Is this going to be a retelling of Kraven's Last Hunt?
Nos vemos en 10 años chavales
Will be game of the year! Mark this
AMAZING
Notice how Pete threw that guy. The suit is taking control
Spider cop😠
This game looks amazing but I am also mad because I know for a fact that this is not gonna launch on PC for at least a year after the PS5 release even know they totally could just because   they know more people will buy the pc version if they wait and worst part is that I'm still gonna pay $60 for the PC version when it comes and I'm gonna know the story because I am gonna watch a playthrough
I'll leave comment and edit it after 5 years
You know I’ve been debating whether I should get a ps5 or a new graphics card but this and the new mortal Kombat sealed the deal
The details,gameplay, soundtrack man its already peak worth the wait🔥🔥🔥
Let's hope it's more than just Peter being selfish the whole time and I really don't want them to have the entire venom segment be over quickly....
this might be the game that does the symbiote justice 🔥🔥
This trailer alone proves that insomniac knows what they are doing lore wise. Peter is clearly changing with the symbiote use.
This is history right here dawg. So happy we finally got gameplay!!!!🎉🎉🎉
Look how the symbiote tries to take over the "TOGETHER" but then the electricity from Miles stops it.
The Venom Combat is Something we all were excited for a unique more logical way of how a venom possesed spiderman would fight Looking forward for this !!!
i wonder if tom's spidey symbiote suit will look like this
"We are venom " Where's eddie Brock?
1:27 deadpool
Wow. Can’t wait to play as Spider-Man with the Venom symbiote!
Wow! Best gameplay I’ve seen in a while
This game is going 2 change Spider-Man 4-ever.
sick
Watch this on playstation's channel. They have it in 4k.
this is art
Deadpool
It’s not even out yet and this game is already game of the year imo
Love how Peter is more aggressive in his fighting. It's not just that he's concerned for Dr. Connors, but that the symbiotic is influencing him and making him more aggressive. Even his attitude towards Miles (cutting him off and being dismissive) is out of character from his usual, witty and cheerful self.
This is incredibly sick ❤
Spider-Man sounds like kid sasuke or am I….
I forget, is there going to be outfits if so would the symbiote suit overwrite it?
14 years ago Rocksteady taught the world how to create a stealth settings where the enemy reacts to the disappearance of other enemies...and here we are, 2023, 4:48, "Something happen 5 feet from me on my line of sight and ear shot? Must´ve been the wind...oh well"
11:28 exactly what a symbiote spiderman should be like
I knew insomniac was going to do it right. I’m so hyped for this and wolverine too
This looks absolutely epic! I just hope they don't have us kill Peter by the end of this story. I've always wanted a series with both Miles and Peter working together and I'd hate to see it end with just one game.
The action at 11:01 is just 'FIRE'
how did peter get the Symbiote?
I was hoping for a different city. Web swinging in the same city over and over is getting old.
Sasuke returns to the dark side 😢
Game of the year
Peter is about to be a sub-boss lol
“He’s gonna wish he didn’t come to, New York!” Is just so badass
When he said: "so do I" I guess that means that we are going to see Venom in it's full version
I just want to say i was here for this great moment.
Miles surfing through the water the whole time while being chased by Lizard was pointless 😂 he could have swung away
that was beautiful
FINALLY
I'm showing this to my dad. If this doesn't make him get a ps5, I don't know what will!
this game looks so good!
When he says “he got away from us” is Peter referring to him and miles or him and the symbiote
Kraven the Hunter is in this?? Im on board!
THE LIZARD LOOKS LIKE GODZILLA LESS GOOO ABAHAFA
Sounds just like sasuke now 💀
Whoever is playing peter is doing a horrible job with the mean aggressive voice acting
Day one purchase.
HYPEEEEEE
finally more news
Did anyone else see lizard on the map
why is it ps5 only. put it on pc
Insomniac really listened to the fans with the Web super launch and the gliding feature.
This looks flat out awesome. Would love to see a Peter/MIles team up in a future Spiderman movie. Theyre great together.
Hopefully they have a free roam mode after the story is finished and we can free play as the black suit
Plz tell me Shocker is in the game....for reasons
anyone else notice how they added the web line mod? : )
if this game is ps5 only I am screwed and going to have to just watch videos on it and hope I will get the ps5 before you guys release another spider man game
I hope there's some kind of punishment for bad swinging, that you can take damage and ragdoll if you make mistakes
I’ve waited so long and now i finally get to see gameplay. It doesn’t disappoint
I think peter parker will die in this game
I hate that this is a Playstation exclusive.... Hopefully it at least doesn't take years to come to PC because it looks fantastic.
Peter's gonna 100% become evil due to the venom 😂
I love how brutal peter is, also like that how miles' bio electricity is blue when hes in stealth mode. Hopefully they keep peter alive, tired of miles flourishing at the expense of peter's death. Theres enough space on manhattan for two spidermen
THE GLIDING AND WEB SLINGSHOT. Traversal is gonna be even quicker and more fun. Plus it said Queens, meaning there’s a possibility of that being in the open world. Also love the new huds.
KRAVENNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Yeah i guess i am gonna buy a PS5...
So many original games revealed today!  Alan Wake 2  Talos Principle 2 FNAF Help Wanted 2 Ghostrunner 2 Dragons Dogma 2 Destiny 2 Helldivers 2 Arizona Sunshine 2 Spiderman 2
Phenomenal!
Kinda bummed, this looks more like a sequel to Miles as opposed to Spider-Man. Really hope the majority of the game is from Peter's perspective.
Разьеб
Wow this looks amazing.  Hire these writers for an MCU movie already.
The black suit looks like trash
Glad to see Peter is gonna be a savage
The way Peter responded to Mile’s at the end gave me chills.
SLINGSHOT MECHANISM
The gliding looks so much fun
OMG that kick he does on the dude against the wall is literally from the Web of shadows DS game 😲
*OMG incredible Wow Can’t Wait Awsome Just Loved It i hope this is Real not Fake*
Currently on my 5th rewatch
Ahhhh AND I DONT HAVE PLAYSTATION ANYMORE FMLLLL
sickkk
I have a feeling Miles would get to fight Peter
Yuri's years of playing sasuke has  lead him to this moment....
Black Symbiote Spider-Man in full action.  He'll yeah ❤
Can't wait for this game! Looks awesome!
well I'll wait like 5 years to play this on a pc i guess
It looks like the symbiote is a texture over a suit. I wonder if it can be applied to his different skins through the game. The design is fantastic
FINALLYYY TLETS GOOO
Bless you Insomniac. This looks absolutely stunning. ❤️
New game coming September?!?! Compared to all the Spider-man games , game automatically beats them because of new moves, possibly new suits, can be miles and peter, only real spider-man fans will know, the game is just fire in general🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just webbed my pants
Only GTA 6 can challenge this game
I might be reaching, but the Lizard looks a lot like Godzilla and the part where Miles is water-skiing in the EAST RIVER away from the Lizard there is an old man fishing which looked a lot like the old man fishing that got his pole snagged by Godzilla in the 1998 film produced by Columbia/Tri-Star.  🤔......
Same game 3, but looking worse.
"He has big teeth"  "So do I.."  Bro thinks he opium
They did it!!! They brought back the sling shot mechanic from amazing Spider-Man
Looks like Imma have to go get a PlayStation since Xbox act like they cant release some good games.
Definitely gonna get a ps5 this year for Christmas
This just looks like a worse version of Prototype. Not interested in the adventures of Peter & Peter Darker. Kraven doesn't feel like Kraven. They gave him an army of mercenaries. Kraven is a solo hunter. Its become a trope at this point to give everyone an advanced tech army of minions.
Hype
Fire. Just no pandered woke garbage and I’m Gucci. Plus I wanna play most of the game as the homie miles.
I love how dark the tone is they actually show deaths and blood I did not expect this. Im loving it already
no release date?
Gonna have to borrow my brothers ps5 for a couple weeks because I’m not gonna wait a year for a pc release
game looks great
Symbiote Spiderman sounds just like Christopher Barnes when he had the black suit on in the original animated series
This is gonna be game of the year!! 😮
At last! A reason to buy a PS5! I cannot wait.
Secret wars black suit come books Spider-Man suit update😇🖤🤍🖤🤍💭💭🗯🗯🤯🤯♾️📖✝️🌟⭐️
a lot of dumb gliding
I just recently got a PlayStation that could play the Spider-Man games, so I knew the story of the first two before hand because I wanted to see the story when they released, but I cannot wait to experience this game myself! Totk, horizon dlc, Star Wars 2, and now this game, man 2023 sure is a great year for games!!!
I’m gonna put some dirt in your eye
"So do I..." I got chills! This game looks to be literally everything I wanted and more!!
WE WON!!!!!!
Is gonna be for PS4? It looks very cool
Im just sitting here watching this mad asf I don’t have a Ps5
This movie is gonna be so good
What if and hear me out, Pete is the final boss?
I hope the me 2 years from now has a ps5
I am disappointed because I did not see the next-generation graphics as promised, I expected that the graphics will be more beautiful and realistic...
This game can be easily run in a ps4
This game is going to be amazing
As soon as I saw the black suit in all its glory, I lost it, cannot come soon enough
Seeing symbiote spider-man is like reliving web of shadows... love it.
is this only for ps5 :(
BRUH THIS LOOKS SO AMAZINGGG IM SO EXCITED
The time has come
I’ll come back to this comment when the game releases so that we can all review it.
I like how the suit looks like a liquid metallic armor, it lends more credence to the idea that Peter isn’t aware it’s a living organism
Anyone know who the last icon id at 1:34
Omg😮
I'm impressed they got MatPat to play Peter Edit: but that's just a theory
Where are the next gen graphics ?
Okay, the difference between regular Peter and Black Suit Peter is perfectly portrayed by Yuri Lowenthal. Top marks.  And I'm really hoping we get Venom as a Playable character.
OH THIS IS GAMEPLAY GAMEPLAY
Can't wait! Gonna be epic for sure. Insomniac games never disappoints!!
I need a ps5 like right now
This game looks so beautiful I can’t wait to buy it
BRO THIS IS FIRE, NEVER BEEN THIS HYPED FOR FALL TO COME AROUND
Ok hol' up, lemme just pick my jaw up off the ground! WOW! Feel more excited than I did when seeing the original Spider-Man game trailer all those years ago! Yuri Lowenthal doing bits with his performance, so gravelly and hot-tempered! And I love that they never gave us a clear look at Lizard. Black suit Spidey looks mad cool, and I'm so happy Kraven is here too, he looks wild, love that fake-out at the start. So hyped!
The detail in only 12 mins is crazy, I love the symbiote suit, ngl I’m sitting here in disbelief cuz this is just perfect!
But we will get the option to get the old face back?
i hope its also in ps4
THIS LOOKS AMAZING AND THE DUO IS CRAZY
miles morales is miles morales
There’s dead pool in this game
Cant wait till this has a PC port so I can actually play it 😑
NUT NUT NUT
Sasuke is Peters body
THIS SHI IS FUUUCKIN FIIIREEEEEEEEEEEE YUHHHHHH
Ok so take my money right now so I can start please
Instant pre order.
I gotta say for the lizards design it kind of reminds me of abomination in the avengers game
Honestly I’m hoping that as the symbiote suit gets “upgraded” in whatever form that takes, such as new moves or skill trees, that Peter becomes more aggressive as the suit influences him more and more. This kind of parallel between gameplay mechanics and story beats are always a joy to see so I hope it app,it’s here
That was awesome
Just like waiting for the 2018 Spider-Man game. This is gonna be hype
Well done
From what i can see there will be 3 main villains in the story venom,connor and kraven (i am not really sure about connor since his story can be ended with kraven one) and about venom i assume in this game there will be the same machines of GTA 5 that there is quests included Peter alone or miles and from what i see venom can be put in two places in the stroy in the start in the story (even though i am highly doubt it but i put it because Miles didn't have any special interact with Peter and his new suit) and in the end game (i highly think that what might happen since i think they might do the same thing happened with spider man 3 and in the first trailer we see Peter and Miles working together against venom) anyway i wish we fight venom after we done with kraven story since venom is iconic more than kraven and finally i will give a wild guess that if we get spider man 3 its might be about green goblin since its seems we are not done with Norman Osborn and his son(tbh i think harry might be venom but controlled by it)     (sorry for my bad English)
peter parker spider man yes.  i have to play through fake spider man segments? nope.
I love the concept of the black suit affecting Peter This game gonna be a roller coaster 🔥
Yes yes yes! More right into my veins!
11:32 i love how he yeet the person instead of get him landing safely in symbiote suit😂
I love everything I'm seeing and hearing in this vid. Story, voice acting, gameplay, all of it's just game of the year material.
Couldn’t imagine having an Xbox and not being able to play this
I really like how almost every Spider-Man villain is getting their own time to shine rather than just being a boss. It’s really cool how even the lesser known villains like KingPin, Mr. Negative, and even Tombstone are getting such great attention instead of just being forgotten or overshadowed. I really hope they give more love to other villains as well.
disappointment
I can’t wait to put dirt in people’s eye’s in this game
Raimi black suit, please.
Perfection
Who's the guy that kraven killed?
Well time to get a Ps5.
Did miles just do a kamehameha?? 4:59😂
Is this the first game where the Spider-Man symbiote uses its symbiote powers? The other game are usually just as cosmetic skin
This looks soooooo good , I’m so tight I can’t play any of the 3 games , I neeeeeed a ps5 ong ‼️
Web of shadows vibes
the graphics stunning cant wait for it to come to pc
Looks terrible! No new mechanics!!!
Miles gliding through the city looks dope asf
Why Miles had to me in Harlem
I am so glad he uses the tendrils, this looks just like how ultimate worked in shattered dimensions I really hope he has a rage mode and he can switch between the suit like spider-man 3, either way I CANNOT WAIT
goty
Dude, DUde, DUDe, DUDE!!!
Yuri lowenthal already killing it
Wow. This looks incredible.
Looks terrible
Guess peter's going through his emo phrase again.. Istg if they give Totk GOTY instead of SM2.. They are gonna commit a crime.. This game is so broken!! Its soo cool asf!! Never expected them to show this many features at once.. The fact there's more.. I just love Peter's voice.. I wonder what's miles gonna do.. Im pretty sure that we are gonna fight peter as miles.. Like thats one thing I really hope to see.. Definitely in my cart!
Legends know that the voice of peter parker is same as sasuke
I love seeing the gamers and marvel fans gather here. It's beautiful.
Dude this game looks amazing already, imagine what wolverine would look like
64 hour game
Am I the only one that hears Sasuke in Peter?
Siiiiick!
This looks fantastic
Another game i cannot play
Soon this will be nostalgic in years to come by
I want to see Peter throw an F-bomb when he has the symbiot
I’m pissed that’s it only for ps5 but this game looks amazing
I need this rn
The symbiote attacks reminds me of Prototype  Edit: It’s good to see that Miles still has “The Exaggerated Swagger of a Black Teen”
Yuri Lowenthal is killing it! I love the darker voice acting
Spiderman web of shadow 2.....😅😅😅
Shortest 12 mins of my life
Now this is better than WOS
a esperar 6 años para que salga en pc.... ajsjas
I NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW OMG
Another game that my PC can't support
more more MORE PLS UPLOAD MORE NEW SPIDER MAN PLS
For once, I'm actually not excited for a spiderman game.
Well. I wasnt gonna get a ps5
Cons of this trailer:  -Lizard design is kinda mid  -Not rlly a fan of kraven who is a jungle man that’s naturally trained,and spends most of his time killing wild beasts,and for some reason has a corporation that has high tech (would make more sense if they were fellow poachers or smth)  -That’s it  Pros- *LITERALLY EVERYTHING BESIDES THOSE 2*
Looks decent
If this game isn't on PS4 it will not sell as well. This game could work on PS4
So spoderman now can fly like Superman? And dogs are robots from Horizon?
Game of the year
Who else is beyond hyped? This game looks unreal! It’s everything we wanted to see in a spider man game. This looks like a movie.
God, I can't wait to (hopefully) use bad guys as skateboards again as black suit Peter
I'm hoping Peter will dance like Bully Maguire once in this
and another ps2-graphic game, thanks noobs, learn how to make games
Oh this is so cool!!!!
SLINGSHOT AND WEB WING MECHANICS??? AHHHHH
How did he get that simbiot or whatever suit someone please answer
I need the old Peter Parker design BEFORE the remastered version
Peter is just slightly annoyed fellas, nothing to see here
WE BOUT TO HAVE A TIME GUYS!!!
this finna be a fie game🔥🔥🔥🔥
I see! Thats why this game took forever to make! This looks incredible
IT’S EVERYWHERE 😩😩
This hype af
Hallo and welcome future people. This trailer has been out an hour now and I declare it to be the bomb ❤
i wanna hear him saying he will chase shocker to the ends of the earth
I hope I see best girl
Peter getting evil😈 LET ME IN 😭
ok i love this
Bro I can’t believe how amazing this looks, bro sounds like Sasuke I can’t wait to play in the symbiotie suit this is fs game of the year already
♥
IM BUSSINGGGGGG
This might just be Game of the Year. The level of excitement I have right now is ridiculous 😆
just wow
Anyone else hear Yuri slip back into Sasuke?
Cyu guys in 10 years to look back on, people will love to relive the moment after playing the game🤟
Shut up and take my money Marvel!!!💵💵💵
Yuri letting the Sasuke voice out more with the venom suit
Dang, still no Chrysler Building
Oh yea I’m getting this for sure
Troyo Boyos pissing himself in excitement right now
11:53 the lens changed
SLIIIINNNGGGGG SHOOOOTTTTTT
This game is going to be a 10/10 I already know
Man I was worried the first guy was Kraven. The real Kraven looks super good! Insomniac is on a roll with this series, and I for one am hyped for this game!
This game looks amazing i hope they add the loop swing
Wow! Can’t wait to play this game 🤩 it looks incredible!
Can’t wait till Cory plays this
Please insomniac fix this NY skyline. Please please please. Bring back Chrysler building and esspacially fix downtown. It looks horrible.
Spider-Man 2 has the potential to be the best superhero game of all time
Sony scripted bullshit
will there be multiplayer like gotham nights ?
Who else is getting memories of Spiderman 3 the game, black suit spiderman chasing the Lizard and Kraven. Besides the form that this lizard has now its pretty similar to the final fase of him aswell in the spiderman 3 game. Feels nostalgic indeed, of course am sure insomaniac are probably gonna make things different this time, cant wait to see
Wow Wow Woo Waa
Also super subtle but the way the symbiote takes over the spider symbol and miles venom zaps it away could be symbolic ;)
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 epic
This is gonna be fun 😁😁😁
Таво рот бл, это великолепно!
I wish I got the PS5 instead.
SHOCKERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR, I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!!!!!!!
the amount of love i have for this game is insane! i know that this game is gonna be my fave game of 2023! i can't wait to finally play this game
Hearing Spider-Man more aggressive and enraged all the time kind of reminds me of Yuri Lowenthal’s interpretation of Sasuke Uchiha from Naruto
The kitchen smelling good
Game of the Year i just know it
7:10 future revolution sound
This looks so good I wonder if Miles will have to save Peter or Peter will save himself
Finally we get to use the Black Suit only suit worth usin
Hola I’m deverre
I wonder how far in the game this is in
Kraven the hunter is so fuckin boring... where is venom ???
Miles about to have to handle Pete
this happed before with Toby maguire spiderman
This has made up my mind about getting a ps5.
11:51 “so do i”😳that was cold af
What’s the difference between miles’ blue and red lightning?
Kraven looks like he Walks With Elias
11:32 he just dropped him 😭😭😭😭
Terrible. modern gaming is dead
My jaw was on the floor during that first fight scene. Haven’t been this excited for a game in a long time
11:32  The way Peter just threw that civilian to the ground after saving him shows how much his personality has changed. He was like, "Off you go, peasant."
Heheheheheheh 🤭
5:02 wow that is incredibly cool.  The sound and everything and those dudes getting zapped😂😂.   I’m sure insomniac will provide another excellent game, no doubt.  Still a triple A studio that I have faith in. Really it’s only reserved for them and Santa Monica studios these days. Ohh, and fromsoft can’t forget them, although I wouldn’t really consider them triple A. It’s the souls niche so probably not.  It’s sad that I can only have trust in 3 studios to produce good games.
Kraven's Last hunt I assume?
THIS WILL BE PEAK
I didn’t freaking know we would be playing spider-man with the symbiote suit. Hell yea! That’s awesome
Ahhh I'm getting Sam Raimi nostalgia here guys. Can't wait for this
Bully Maguire
My wallet is in danger
I’m excited for this game 🥹🥹
Insomniac need to just make avengers game lol but this game looks amazing
This makes me wet just to think about the wolverine game they also making 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Yes finally 👏🏼and Queens get the money 💰 ☠️🃏🔥
Dude peter is sooo agresiv man 🔥
Too many spoilers in a trailer
This is beautiful
That series X investment ages worse by the minute    Redfall flopping, Nintendo dropping Zelda, now THIS 😭😭
I am absolutely stocked but mad that I can’t play this because I don’t have ps5 😭😭 but I will watch walkthroughs
this trailer was so good it gave me energy for my run
hope the symbiote suit attaches to miles even for like a second. would be fresh and new
Marshin the man hunter 😳
Is the lizard in this too!? Kraven the hunter and the symbiote? Holy crap!!!
I got admit this almost give me the vibe of epic Mickey 2 the power of two with the two Spider-Man’s we have
Dude, the mechanics, the moves, the subtle details now 😮 This isn't just going to be the game of the year. It's the game of a lifetime. I've never been more excited about a game!!
They brought back the slingshot from SM3.
Simplesmente insano de bom
This Spider-Man game is going to be more exciting than the last 2.  I especially loved the chase scene.  7:37
I guess I have to buy a ps5 now
Why is peter, venom?  🤷🏻‍♂️
I gotta feeling kraven gonna kill our boy Pete😅
this game gonna be so peak 😮‍💨🔥🔥
SASUKKKEEEE!!!!
“Good riddance….”
holy peak 😢😢😭
love you guys
Miles v Black Comstume Spidy callin it now. Midgame then enter Venom. Looks like Kraven will be side quests. GOTY for sure.
This looks insane
GOTY 2023
it's crazy how after peter got the symbiote he sounds sm more angrier
This looks amazing 😍😍
Did Sony made a Prototype 3 game With a hint of Maneater!?
I love it
bro ts looks flawless
They fly so fast now!!! And my god Miles got some moves!!!!!
Lesss gooo
Love the new addition to the game. I hate the UI tho
KRAVEN LIZARD THE SWITCH BETWEEN SPIDERS the design on the suit it’s gonna great
Letsgooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is everything i couldve hoped for for this game the adjustment of combat to the symbiotes abilitys is beautiful and the web wings and web slingshot are appreciated additions the black suit design is perfect, yuri lownethals performance is incredible nailing a hardy rough angry peter, web swinging is more fast and fluid however i did hope for some different animations to the last game and maybe some more dynamic web swinging, however this is clearly an early mission in the game and im sure there will be more stuff for web swinging they unlock in the story and the skill trees, just like in the first game where you got different web gadgets as you went along, i have been waiting patiently for months watching video after video of spiderman 2 news hoping one day we’d get gameplay and now its finally here i want to say it did not disappoint, its has never been more painful for me to be stuck on last gen
Yooooooooo I can already sense Peter and Mike fighting each other in this game. And the new fighting techniques are TERRIFYING ❤❤❤❤❤
HELL yeah we got Prototype in our Spiderman games
How are there 2 spidermanz in the same city and universe?
Generational
Had a smile plastered on my face the entire video
VENOM ?! 3:21
Imagine if he actually used martial arts to take that knife away? Lol
I don’t like how the black suit seem to have some form a vest suit of armor and eyes looked bit blurry it need to be slim and streamlined like looking suit like web of shadow game
Je voit pas de différence graphique avec lancien , je le trouve même moche surtout pour un jeux seulement ps5 ,cest ca la next gen ?
the symbiote voice sound alot like the 90’s cartoon
looks epic
Spiderman goes Prototype Prototype goes Spiderman Maaaaaan, I hope!!! >:D
No way, so in this game play we see the character Kraven the Hunter and we see Spidey in the black suit and mention of Dr. Connors man we’re getting a lot
aw man that looks so good hope we don't gotta wait long on the port.   PS5 homies don't be too loud with the spoilers please 😂
Yuri chanelling some Sasuke this time around for Spider Man! I'm here for it!
Insomniac is looking like they're trying out for the first Superman game with those glide physics.
Ok okay!!! This game is dope I can’t wait to play this game oh my world in PS5, I definitely need to get a PS5 and start from The Beginning of Spider-Man 1 Spider-Man: Miles Morales than this one plus this game is going to epic and phenomenal lit
Small touch, but I absolutely love the UI art style change between Peter and Miles.
Chills!
So we're gonna have The Lizard, Kraven, and Venom. Nice.
Game itself aside i find henchmen for this villain so out of place... im no comics/marvel fan, i dont even recall the name of this villain, but i know him and understand he is all about the thrill of the hunt, himself a predator... shitloads of henchmen, robot dog and armored car trying to kill spiderman instead of himself? Its like, if hulk were a villain sending henchman in his place. Spider-man have more gangster/mastermind villains even i know of, and im sure his villains roster is way bigger then the most famous ones... give the paramilitary grunts to someone else and make this hunter a repeating boss that ambushes spiderman when the player least expects...
Bro became a darkskin meme 💀
Guys I just finished Spider-Man PS4 a couple of days ago and I’m on Spider man miles morales, I’m so hyped for thus
Dont worry we will get rid of that symbiote then beat it
DID I JUST HEAR SASUKE???
🕷🕸
Almost forgot how good it felt to wear that suit. I reveled in it.
Amazing
I'm so glad I bought a ps5
This a straight up movie I done forgot it was a game 😂😂😅
Loving this! I’m getting big Web of Shadows vibes from Peter’s black-suit gameplay, but this whole project looks like it’ll have so much more to offer than all previous Spider-Man games. So hyped
Might be my first time pre ordering a game…
All I hear is sasuke...call me crazy
This is the first time I'm seeing black suit Spider-man using the symbiote's tendrils since shattered dimension! Imagine how crazy Venom is going to be
NOW THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A GAMEPLAY TRAILER
Yep, this is going to be the game of the year.
Not adding co-op will be theyre biggest mistake. Other than that this game is amazing but multiplayer or at least 2 player would’ve made it groundbreaking.
it's subtle, but you can see the symbiote still pulsating when it's on Peter, most noticable on his eyes at the end. Makes it really feel like an alien bonded to him, along with the tendrils he uses in combat. I should buy a PS5 to play this.
Game of the year worthy
Told yall Harry won’t be venom. It’s Eddie mark my words
when pc port
That’s so cool I’ve been waiting for another game
Bully Yuri
Really hope that venom and lizard have a horrific twist. Like a horror movie villian
Woow. Action on water... Symbiote suit and hunter. Take my money!!
Pls for the love of god add the parker dance to this game it will make my day
Careful, Peter. Your Sasuke's showing.
Venom turn peter into Sasuke
HES GOT BIG TEETH SO DO I!
If we don’t get an evil Peter suit dance scene then I’m not buying.
Can’t wait to play this masterpiece.
I love how everyone starts their comments with i love😂😂😂😂
I like that the venom suit kinda looks slimy and gross.
Holyshit
Dang the venom ozz is messing Peter up
its crazy how much more alive the game looks compared to the other two. same ny but somehow more alive and more detailed, this game is gonna be fantastic
I like news powers and news gameplays and the venom is so good, so wonderful 😢, so perfect✨️, and play two spiderman 😱 in one game ! is very great ! When can i play and enjoying this game ! Finally 🎉😮
Peter has gone full Bully Maguire.  No one is safe, run everyone!
Finally brothers😎
I can’t wait for Kaiju Connors.
We were there when it was written Mike Dizzle
Itachi: You just dont have enough hate…          Marvels Spider-Man 2 enters the chat
Will we have co op ?
Kraven?! I didn’t know he was gonna be in this game! Awesome 🤩 also are we going to loose the symbiote at the end of the game?
that was insane! i can't wait to play this game! i'm so excited to play both Peter and Miles again!
So, Sony wants to make a movie on Kraven the Hunter and blows its load making a game that will be wildly better than the bs movie... lol😅
They arr FINALLY about to top Arkham Knight franchise! FIRST game I will have bought in 10 years.
That wingsuit gameplay looks soooo good😮
Too much Tech on Miles.
MASTERPIECE
so good
Spider-Man 2: QTE fest.
This was a nostalgia fest
Present 1 Hours
ugh... so I'm gonna have to shell out around 500 dollars for a PS5 to play this game..... dammit...
Hey I just noticed they made the speed cap higher, Or at least it looks like it.
OKAY ILL GET A PS5 I SUBMIT
Peter simbointy its angry? WHYYY
This game will be very popular I would skip miles morales to play this once it’s released
Just waow ! 🔥
At least they got Kraven right on the video game, Idk why they cant do the same for his solo film?
2:22 left me speechless, and I continued to be speechless throughout the entire video. Absolutely amazing.
Oh thats kraven…? Ohhhh THATS Kraven!
SWEET MOTHER OF GOD!!! Spider man has gone insane!
Now im glad they waited so long for gameplay release. This looks insane, giving me web of shadows vibes.
Looks really great but i think that insomniac gave up on the idea of bringing up venom since the only time we see him is in the trailer soo im kinda scared that peter is gonna be the "venom" of the game and not eddie anyways its just a theory but i really hope venom gon be there
SICK
I know that trumpet. You can’t fool us Sony we know as soon as you bought Bungie you put them mfers on other games IMMEDIATELY
Not only are we getting a great Dr Connors plot line that’s infused with Harry Osborn storyline but we also get Kraven the Hunter trying to hunt down everyone plus a story that involves venom that will probably be the end of Spider-Man!
This version of symbiote Spider-Man can be so intense, especially his anger is more menacing. The action sequences will be so sick.
Beyond game of the year material
Yuri, your Sasuske is showing
Hope they add tobey suit in the updated model with all black and andrew garfield from tasm 2 with big lens🥺
The boat chase gave me major uncharted 4 vibes. So excited for this game
YOOO
Peter sound like Bakugo from MHA
Spider-Man 3 the movie update costume🤯🤯🖤🖤🖤🤍🤍🤍💭💭😇😀
I love it, Peters eyes at the end remind me of the spiderman spiders shadow comic where he never gave up the symbiote
Looks like the plot from spectacular spiderman
OMG!! The switches between Miles & symbiote Pete is Amazing! A true ‘Amazing Spiderman’‼️
Can you please put the game on the PS 4
Literally the exact same combat and dodges besides the super moves. Same general animations including swinging. Also the game doesnt look any better than spiderman ps4 in terms of graphics. They should have taken some inspiration from web of shadows.
Ohh the voice actors are killing this im so excited
YOOOOO!! LETS GO SPIDEY🔥
Xbox wishes they could produce this much PEAK
give them GOTY already
Probably an unpopular opinion and I know this is just a small clip but I noticed we spent more time playing as miles than the actual guy whose game it is, I love miles and his new powers are amazing but I kinda hope there isn’t too much switching between characters required like gta5 , like I just wanna play as symbiote Peter 😂 miles has his own game and story so I hope this stays as peters game and not a dual protagonist game
This peter is very aggressive... I love it I also like the fact that peter face is very expressive with "so do i"
I love how they have clearly listened to the fanbase. We asked to be able to stationary launch with two webs like Spider-Man 1, we got it! We wanted gadgets for miles, we got it! We wanted to be able to switch between characters, we got it! So far they’ve aced everything and delivered so much more. A wing suit!? Hell yeah! Look at the speed too! So many new mechanics coming I can’t wait! I’m so excited!
Can’t wait until the game finally comes to pc!
I like they took aspects of The Black suit of Spider-Man web of shadows  making the fighting style of Spiderman feel different.
the lizard looks like godzilla😂😂😂
if only the game was on ps4
Imma be back after 1 year to relive this moment
Seeing the symbiote suit again in a Spider-Man game is giving me Web of Shadows vibes and I’m all for it
WOW cant wait.
When preorders
DUDE!!! I LOVE that the voice acting when Peter’s in the black suit reminds me so much of Christopher Daniel Barnes’ “SHOCKER!! ILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!”
This is setting the bar extremely high for MCU and it’s such a fresh take with Miles there, more relationship depth.
I love that they listened to our feedback and what we wanted
OGs who played spiderman three are rolling on the ground rn
I guess Ganke is vulture huh
the first gam released when i was a teenager and im an adult now, this bring a tear to my face :,) masterpiece of a game is cooking
Ehh looks just IGHT! I was more blown away by the reveal of Spider-Man ps4 so much more! 😅seen a lot of the same animations as well.
I wonder is peter is going be a boss since he has the black spider-man suit on. If so i hope is really awesome and a bit sad.
This is giving me the same feeling that the first game gave me years back. Just having a small glimpse of the game. Not knowing what insane segments are waiting for us. Before you know it, we'll be platinuming this game.
This game looks insane!!! Kraven looks amazing!! I’m really hoping to see green goblin in this game!! This is for sure to be goty!
So weird to see Peter being so aggressive, but that's how the symbiote works. The story, once again, looks amazing... i'm just worried that something bad might happen to him.  All I have left is the PS5. Definitely going to get one before Spiderman 2 comes out.
Peter is not being a total d*ck to Miles, (just yet) but I bet as time progresses “Bully McGuire” is going to manifest. Lol
Do we at least get to play as vemon?
I hope they add tobey McGuires venom suit
😍
letssssss gooooooo!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm so confused. So Spiderman is venom like in the original movie? What about Eddie Brock. Wtf is going on. And when has miles morales ever been in the films. Very disappointed in this
I hope we get the Spider-Man 2 game on the ps4!
If this doesn't win Game of the Year(titles and awards don't mean much if you love the game but still), I don't even  know what's the point of the award.
THIS GAME ALREADY LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! AHHHH IM SO EXCITED!
I can’t wait when we have to fight venom🎉🎉
BRO ON THE TABLET WHERE IT SHOWS WHOS 😊IN NEW YORK ONE OF THEM SAID WRAITH, IS YURI GONNA COME BACk!!! 😱😱
When he said "he gots big teeth. So do I." That was definitely venom talking this looks so GOOOOOOD like omg I can't wait for it. This seems better than Spider-Man and miles morales I hope they will continue the sequel after this game 🙏🏾 this lizard also looks and seems way stronger than amazing spider mans lizard. I love it ❤
This looks amazing!!!
Here we finally get to see a change to the symbiote suit, this one has an armour feat to it and the symbiote arms come out. Looks and feels like an alien. LOVE the aggression with Peter btw
Okay it's just me or does venom Spider-Man sound more fierce?
Nut
It’s getting devious😮
Pete is just slightly very very slightly sngry
I didnt get the dlc last time. Fs getting it this time. I hope they make a spiderman ps5 like they did with the ps4 slim and pro
Cool.😎
Love the new Spider-Man2 game all of to Stanley ♾️📖😇♾️💭💭🤍🤍🤍💙❤💙
YO they added web wings that you can use to glide! That's something I was hoping for!
The game looks great but the UI looks horrible. The constant dialog from Peter is a bit annoying too. Wish they toned it down from the first game
Theres gotta be a miles vs peter boss fight this game already looks 10/10😮‍💨 only thing is I thought harry had venom on him in that chamber at the end of the first one
Woah 🤩
I hope MCU is watching at what they should have done instead of a shitty trilogy
It just doesn't do it for me. I probably pick it up, but I don't find enjoyment in these types of games. Plus, I felt no excitement for the game
🔥
This is insane instant cop
Personally I wish Miles and Peter stayed in the own games or maybe choose a character and stick to one side of the story
Looks so good
WOW. Insomniac is the greatest game developer of all time
Yuri Lowenthal is about to be the greatest voice actor of 2023 with the way he does Peter under the influence of the Symbiote, which is a part of Venom, I wonder how much they’ll elaborate on it considering they seem to be chasing Dr. Connors for answers after they cure him.
3:14
They revealed this much so y’all could stop complaining. Now be quiet before they reveal the whole game and just wait. 🤣
Welp spiderman 2 is definately getting game of the year.
Mark my words, game of the year
I love how Peter looks like he's covered in the symbiote. His eyes are just rippling as the venom flesh shifts around.
I am beyond hyped for this game. the new gameplay features are deliciously amazing. the aggressive switch up with Peter's personality due to the venom symbiote suit is fascinating. the traversal looks more diverse and exciting. can't wait for this 😊
Ooooooooooooooh    I neeeeeed it
I didn't know Sasuke was in the mcu 😂😂😂
Bro going back to the spider man web shadow days
I’m going to have fun with this game
Oh man, I love how creepy the symbiote looks in action. It's rare to see Peter use it like Venom does
Wait what? Naaaaah!!!
11:51 when miles tells Pete that he’s got big teeth his eyes on his mask shape and form little arrows in his eyes to show his anger which is super small but I love the detail on his whole suit and eyes
Sasuke is back
Black suit Spider-Man in BACK 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 2:30
Wraith 😢 Game looks phenomenal
Bro, from the combat alone, im getting MASSIVE Web of Shadows vibes. Thos is the BEST Symbiote gameplay aswell as arc ive seen for peter with the suit.  So excited for this masterpiece.
Will this be on PS4?
its been so long since that we see it black suit in peter
Oh man, I love how creepy the symbiote looks in action. It's rare to see Peter use it like Venom does
oh my god
Was that...Kraven?!
Yoooooo i cant wait!!!! This is so 🔥
Sad day to be an Xbox owner 😅
I simply cannot contain my excitement
I always love it when Lizard is depicted this way. Not as a supervillain but as a mindless monster who doesn’t know any better. And even with the Symbiote, Peter is still fiercely protective of him. Maybe even more so.
New areas too I think
They really upped their game on the finisher animations. This looks sick!
Can’t wait to play this game
finally, schizo meds are not needed for that sub anymore
All I can do now is pray for a ps4 release or get a ps5
im crying 😭😭😭 my wallet is going to die becuz im definitely getting this game
Cheese 🧀
¡¡¡BRUTAL!!! ❤🕷🕸
To future me and future you reading this. This game is going to be Goty
i like how miles looks strangely at peter after he like throws the civilian instead of puts them down gently
This looks insane.
Hype!!!
I am going to buy ps5 only for this game.
Idk seems like Miles traversal is still going to outshine Peters and his combat system looks a lot more fun to play as imo
3:42 this is crazy holy😭
Did anyone notice peter threw the guy away like a trash after saving him at 11:30 . shows the dual infused nature of peter and symbiote. This is going to be one hell of an emotional journey!
Is it only for PS5
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Look at the graphics! With each game the graphics get better
Good gameplay but Kraven is not a good enemy. Oh look, he's a hunter against literal superhumans. He'd be dead or in jail inside of 2 minutes in reality.
Game Of The Year! Calling It NOW😭🔥
I thought this play event was going to be pointless but when I saw kraven I was so excited
Im from the future, Spiderman 3 got delayed again so i came here to remember what the hype was like when this game released
Wow wow wow!
Be Greater. Together. I love it 🔥🔥🔥
God dammit. That was so good now i gotta buy a ps5.
3:03 the way he said that line gave me shivers
Bully Lowenthal
This looks great, but should be on ps4
Buying at launch.
After 2 years, we get to see the GREATEST SUPER HERO GAME OF ALL TIME!!!
Omfg they may have done it. They may have topped the first one, a perfect game…
Another terrible game, Marvel stop. Just stop.
This sequence seems to be in the midgame, showing that the Symbiote has already begun to change Peter’s attitude. The more aggressive tone in his voice as he fights, his bull-rushing to Kraven’s main ship, his lack of interest in banter with Miles, lack of care for those he saves. It's clear Peter’s not thinking entirely about his responsibilities as Spidey. Can't wait to see how this plays out in the game.
Man I hyped and hectic for this game.
Can’t wait for this game.
The gameplay of Spidey in the Black Suit looks amazing!
Just an idea but what if miles has to fight peter to get the suit off of him
Hype level: PLUS ULTRA
This looks amazing!
*A moment of silence for bro’s Gonads* 3:10 …
WE ARE VENOM
BETTER BE ON PC TOO
Gonna copy @FelixD34 and say hello to all future viewers looking back on this! Has the economy collapsed yet?
Bro at this point just take me Bank Account…
goty
Holygod
My brain just exploded watching this and I’m halfway through W insomniac
Connors became Arkham Knight Killer Croc
YEAH!
Mostly positive thoughts about this game...a little concerned about the apparent lack of change to the web-swinging. The animations are the EXACT same as the previous games. The gliding ability and slingshot ability are nice, but I know a lot of people (myself included) were wanting a bit more depth to it. Maybe they are hiding the changes made to the web-swinging as a surprise.
Take my money
Coems🤑
babe wake up, peak is gonna drop
Looks mid
For tomorrow....we hunt!
Is nobody going to talk about Miles doing a Kamehameha 5:00
This game is going to be an event.
we better fight Peter as miles
Did they get they same voice actor to play Ganke and Peter?? That would be confusing
🙌👏
WTF! Holy webbing!...
the mechanics look insane, so much different than the previous 2 games. I have nothing but positive words for it. Truly amazing game obv #1 trending game of the year
good thing there's construction going on along the whole river.
at first i didn't like the new ui layout, but after watching the whole video it looks amazing
oh boy i couldn't imagine a shittier game. they missed the chance to create a realistic swinging mechanic like spider-man 2 did. On top of that spider-man can fly now. who needs swinging anyway in a spider-man game right? Stop developing standalone dlcs.
This looks incredible
First motherf*cking day
NAW U CAN SWITCH   Edit 5:01 BRO PULLED OUT THE KAMEHAMEHA  Edit: 9:14 NAW THEY BE GLIDING TOOO  Edit: Nah I love peters personality with the venom suit
Sasuke is that you!!
Why do i have a feeling that you’re gonna end up fighting peter as miles at some point in the game
Anyone else get the feeling Peter is gonna die or get seriously injured in this game?
REALLY EXCITED NOW!!!!! LOVE how they expanded the map beyond Manhattan to include Queens and other areas. Don’t know why the release date wasn’t given based on how much they showed off though
Peter is gonna kill somebody I know it
The game now is 90% "press these buttons during never-ending cutscenes", 10% fly around
Game changer
i'm just sitting here in shock of the brilliance. well done to the entire team
For all of you who are checking this gameplay reveal years in the future, hey. Also is Spiderman 4 good? That's a question for future people
Is it me or can I hear a bit of Sasuke in Pete’s new tone, amazing job by Yuri Lowenthal!
Everything here was just straight heat from the designs,graphics, voice acting, transitions I can’t wait for this game
OMG OMG OMG PERFECT
So when is this DLC coming out
0:37 for everyone seeing this in the future , Hi
Hell yea I can't wait to play it on Xbox 😁😁😁😁
Hey person who reads this in the future
11:11 I like how eventhough peters extremely aggressive with the symbiote, he still said yoop 😂 nothing can stop pete from having fun in some way
Yuri’s menacing voice gave me chills, but still no Bully Maguire
When can we expect the theatrical release?
My ps5, mind, and, body are ready for this game
The wait is nearly over! Just a few more months and we'll see the absolute masterpiece that will be this game. Heck, might even get game of the year.
He's gonna put some dirt in their eyes
I love everything about this. The symbiote spider suit could use a little touch up in detail but other than that this is everything I asked for. WEB GLIDERS BABY!
I'm assuming this mission is pretty recent after Peter gains the symbiote suit but you as the player and Miles are already seeing early signs of it changing Spiderman.  At 6:47 when Peter comes crashing through the roof, instead of immediate relief that your partner has arrived, you're more defensive at first thinking it's another monster.  At 9:06 Miles says WE will take him down together but Peter shrugs it off and is fueled by his aggressive rage to ignore Miles and do it himself.  Then at 9:18 the student is now the teacher showcasing how Peter's new aggressiveness is clouding his judgement in combat.  10:45 despite the chaos happening, Miles gives the civilian a web to absorb contact. Compared to Spiderman at 11:30 just throwing the guy to the ground, making Miles do a double take.  Then at the end, again Peter ignores Miles for a team effort on getting Connor to push forward on his own. I'm so excited for this game! The cherry on top will be when they announce the special edition PS5 for it🙏
Boy you can tell Pete is affected by the symbiont by his voice,kraven looks good,can’t wait for this
9:46 is that the Lizard, one of Spider-Man’s greatest foes?
Gonna buy a PS5 Just for this
I'm sorry but is that Lizard or Killer Croc?
If this doesn't take goty i don't know what will
THE GAMPLAY LOOKS AMAZING BUT I FIND THAT AT SOMEPOINTS THE GRAGHICS ARE GREAT BUT AT OTHER TIMES ALMOST PS3 LIKE ITS WEIRD
Now I wish I had a PS5!
The eyes make became more venom when spider man said "so do i"
This is what we have waited for.
No frickin way!
I think pete will out of control
I just still can't get over how good it looks
Bring back the old Peter's appearance is the only extra thing this needs
Me starting the vid: "ok.. thats an interesting take on Kraven, but i can get behind it.." Actual Kraven shows up: 😮😍🙌
we are in that time where we haven’t experienced this game just yet. a few years from now, we will be coming back to this just to relive the excitement of this masterpiece  :’)
Ah yes Prototype 3
There are parts of this I'm really looking forward to, and other things that are already irritating me. I'm not seeing how this will top the first one, but it'll at least be a fun game.
gawd dayum
This is a movie
The hype is UNREAL
In ten years ill relive this moment
With this xbox is doomed if they don't make a come back
OMG
I noticed how Peter is demonstrating anxiety, like he’s impatient, similar to how some people obsess or are unhealthily addicted to something.  I might even think he believes the symbiote can give him the power to save more people, he believes he could have saved Aunt May with it.
Looks amazing! I'm assuming once the symbiote attaches to Peter we won't be able to take it off or change suits for a time. That would be a cool mechanic
There is no way we start like this there’s to many holes to fill in this gameplay.
I love how ugly the white is, it brings out how creepy the symbiots are. And its super creepy how violent spider-man is
ولك أحلى لعبة والله !!! 😢😢😢
Sounds like a Bungie soundtrack
Chills when he said said that Kraven should've never went to NYC
Finally the webs r black
We want venom!
Xbox players punching the air rn
I love Black suit Spider-Man.
Spiderman web of shadows ran so spiderman 2 could walk
The PS5 graphics is going to be peak
Peter just tossing that guy to the ground at 11:32 is just *chef kiss*
looks the same as the last 2 spider man games with minor changes, this could easily be a DLC
Game of The Year!!!!
To jest zajebiste
Fighting looks so good 😊 excited about this game
who needs movies when you have great cinamatics in games like these.
I honestly not interested in the game now seeing how Peter Parker having rhe symbiotic suit and miles bioelectrcty color being changed( time to time in different scenes)  honestly makes me upset confused and completely lore breaking
Bully Maguire in the making
Another boring interactive movie with less content than Spider-Man 2 for the Gamecube? :D no thanks Sony 💩
I love how they trick you into thinking Kraven had a mediocre redesign in the beginning before actually revealing him
Graphics are a bit underwhelming, somehow it looks worse than Miles Morales but gameplay looks neat, really looking forward to play thisssss
Epic
I feel like Symbiote Peter will be a major boss fight for Miles in this game
I'm so hyped
See you guys in the future when the games become nostalgic!
Crazy how this is already game of the year wow definitely worth the wait
Cool
6:26 am 25 May
Miles did a kamehameha
I didn't think we'd actually be venom spiderman. It's also cool that we change between Peter and miles
When he said I have teeth too did you notice his eyes turned into venoms eyes for a moment.  I really really hope that in NG+ we can use the black suit even after we get rid of it
Spiderman fans eating good this year, W Game 🔥
Man I want this to come to PC so bad
I’m calling it, Peter/venom will be the final boss fight and it’s up to miles to beat him (which is kind of obvious) but it’s not completely sure if this will lead to Peter’s death. Maybe, maybe not. But all ik is that I’m hyped asf
Instant preorder!
i really wanna play this game on pc but it's gonna take while because of piracy but still great news for console players
come back to this in 5-10 years and remember how good the game was and regret the fact u didnt comment aswell
I love how aggressive Peter sounds
I love this, I need it
Game of the year already 🙌🏾
The lizard runs like a deathclaw from fallout 3💀
Symbiote Spider-Man sounds like sasuke dub lmao
Gonna definitely go back to this trailer in about a year so this is to myself and this is awesome!
Kraven the hunter!!
Uh oh, Yuri Lonthenal has gone full Sasuke
11:49 I love the detail of Peter's eyes becoming more menacing after the "So do I"
God of War 5 and Spider-man 2 are the only games I was excited for in like 5 years 🖤
Please please have the ILL GET YOU SHOCKER ILL CHASE YOU DOWN TILL THE ENDS OF THE EAAARRRTTHHHH That would be amazing His voice does sound like the old cartoon and i think shocker is still alive
here for the nostalgia
Please take my money this game looks amazing
cant wait for it to get a remaster on pc in 7 years
LOOKS AMAZIIIIIING!! LETS GOOOOOOOOO!!
Is that boozer from days gone?
Lots of fake comments and bots lmao
Everything looks great, but I hope the A.I. for stealth is a lot more alert and not just braindead.
I want to play this so badly like so F€£^¥[]§ing badly
aah yeah, instand web of shadows vibes😌
See u in fall mr Spiderman
Hope we get a Shocker rematch in the symbiote suit lol
Does nobody gonna say anything about the PS3 graphics?
Hold up we can glide now oh ya I love it
I always found  kraven hunting spiderman was dope
I would love to have it but I do not have ps5, although it would be smarter on ps4 too, because they would make more sales
Lizard, Kraven and Venom. Welp, time to buy a PS5.
WAITT WAITTTTT THISSSS IS TOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOODDDDD
Anyone else notice that when he goes to listen into the comms in the jeep, the lighting around the mouth area of the mask looks like Venom's mouth?
Wow man im glad we're finally getting Spiderman 2!!!🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️💯💯💯
God I wish this game was on Pc too
How many times have you watched this trailer? Me: Yes
Is there any Buy Large Mansion propaganda in this one?
Oh my god this looks INSANE!!! I love how they pulled from Uncharted 4 for the chase sequence. Just *chef's kiss* beautifully done!
this is genuinely going to be the greatest game ever made
The attention to detail in just 12 minutes is amazing. Can’t wait to see what the game holds!
Can't wait to see Bully Lowenthal in action. My hype is immeasurable, and my next few months are excruciating.
4:17 love the softer, stealthier version of Miles theme during this part
The only game that I'm hyped AF for, can't wait to be gliding around the city 😍
Anyone else not like how armoury the symbiote suit looks I’m really not a fan
Wow it looks amazing and I can't wait to play it! It's really interesting seeing Peter getting affected by the symbiote and how the people around him like Miles reakt to it. Can't wait to see more! But unfortunately I'll not be able to, because I don't have a PS5😞 I hope it'll come out for pc someday too, but till then I can only wait and hope to be able to play it someday...  Till then I hope I'll not get spoiled. I wish all of you fun playing this great game!
Yooooooo
Amazing!!!
w
This is amazing!
My comment will be old when someone wants to relive memories of this in the future
They showed way too much in this trailer
I like how they have unique fighting styles. Not only that the gameplay is insane man wtf is this. They also keep the lizard in complete darkness until he’s finally shown. Scary stuff.
Someone needs to die that will shoot this sequel over the too
Why are the graphics so bad though??
Yeah…Parker will obviously be the game’s final boss.
Sad day for us Xbox boys, the lizard looks sick he’s always been my favorite villain and I think there’s gonna be a venomized version or peter vs miles boss fight
I hope the spiderman 3 dance appears or its atleast mentioned like dude with that simbyote i was thinking about doing a dance on the street
NYC is bigger, and you can glide too?!? WORTH ALL ALL THE WAIT
3:10 oh boy the combos are gonna be so cool
I NEED PS5 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
There better be a bully McGuire sequence I swear to god
The executions in this game are kind of lame with the venom, he just shoots the venom out as his attack, but grabbing multiple people and slamming them are pretty cool as well as the wall combos
THE WING SUIT THOOOO!!!
Hopefully how aggressive Pete is with the suit, us old heads get a call back to the “Shocker, ends of the earth” meme and delivery
Was here before this game becomed a classic. ❤️
Absolutely a DAY 1. This is all we could've asked for. In Insomniac We Trust!
I SCREAMED WHEN KRAVEN WALKED ON TO THE SCREEN!!!!!
Am I the only one that Hears A little bit of Sasuke in his voice when he get angry. Yuri lowenthal, hands down 1 of voices are recognized
00:21 I got mad because I thought this was last of us factions and not Spiderman but then I heard kravens name Sergei
Bruhh im gonna buy a ps5 now
miles is going to fight the venom suit out of peter
im so hyped
AWESOMEEEEE
7/10 I hope enemies aren't gonna be another sponges for damage.
major prototype vibes with the tentacle combat, love the way this game is coming out
Not impressed
Yuri is killing it as Venom Spider-Man, this is gonna be so epic.
Hate to say it but these graphics barely improved seeing that this game came out a decade ago
see u in 10 years to see again the trailer of this beautiful game
Now were talking!
Best game of all time incoming
I wished I would’ve waited I thought this was fake I want no spoilers
Better come out in fall 2023. I'm tired of the wait.
im crying
LETS GOOO
Bully ps4 is going to be insane, especially cuz of how op he is, hes like arkham batman
Omg omg omg!! Gonna replay the first 2 spider-man games in preparation!
In. Sane
Really love how miles can fly now temporarily
Is It Eddie Brock Venom or Harry Osborn Venom For Marvel Spider-Man 2 in Video Game!?
Thanks insomniac
Taskmaster @ 1:34 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
really like the gameplay, the only thing that disturbs me is the water graphic, it is look like from 2012-13
Hopefully this game has a coop mode
This game is gonna be 100% 10 out of 10 material  , lizard looks spectacular, a better killer, croc, fight, and killer, croc, and Kraven ….. it’s glorious
Sheeeeesh!! Hopefully the movies is as good as this
question that is perhaps useless, will this game be for PS4 or only for ps5?
I love how Peter just seems so fed up and less comical with the suit
So glad miles' venom is now blue. Wayyy better than the yellow version from the past game
Thanks insomniac 🔥🔥
Made my jaw drop seeing the Slingshot mechanic and the web wingsuit, I’m so excited for thissss
So i guess we can say bye to the days where the satisfaction of playing a game blindly and being captivated by a new game is gone now huh smh
I love how Peter sounds way more menacing in his venom suit
I’ve seen so many fan edits thought this was fake for a second
i already know this is gonna be a masterpiece
Is this game gonna be on ps4!? please tell me please!
The gameplay itself is giving a lot web of shadow  2:27 and Spider-Man 3 vibes
See you 2 decades later! When we’re able to play this on our phones.
Ok I really loved, but I feel this HUD a bit weird, hope we got a option to turn it off
I hope we can switch between black and red like web of shadows
11:49 so menacing yo
Just finished watching and this is about to be game of the year
Gattdamn….
3:41 Web slingshot, YES!  I wanted Insomniac to do that since I loved doing that on Spider-Man 2 (2004)!
PC when?
Ahh the nostalgia…
This looks amazing
🔥
Exaggerated swagger is back.
Another 100% Platinum for all us fans
The shot at 7:08 is perfect. Perfectly symbolizes who is in the light and right path and who is not. LITERALLY and Figurately.
In before IGN says it makes you feel like Spider-Man.
They better have the church scene
Yo wait is Pete also gonna be a villian for a little!?
IM CRYING I WANT THIS GAME NOW!! 😢😂❤
Yes yes ! Very good ❤
esta hermoso  te amo marvel ademas peter ya se resta volviendo malo que chevere va estar ya quiero verlo por que jugarlo no me vana  comprar :,v
Well, Miles will save the day from the big bad guy, Peter Parker
Miles versus Spider-Man sense is going to be crazy
This game looks absolutely beautiful
So no more big games coming to ps4 now
im so hyped bro
Insomniac been cooking!! 🤯🔥
This looks mad goofy bruh
Ganó el gaming
Kraven! I don't mean to alarm you, but there could be a Spider-Man or Spider-_Men_ inside the house!
Venom lizard kraven OMG
The amount of kids in this comment section 😂😂😂
Wow
Love the rage of parker,it is gonna be interesting.
3:38 he didn’t have to say that to him😭
Holy crap!! Spider games are always better than movies I'm sorry Marvel my God I'm hyped now 😱😱🤩🤩🤩
About to watch this gameplay 10x a day for the next week
Man miles has such a perfect amount of that exaggerated swagger of a black teen
Looks pretty cool but I wish we  could play the M rated version.
Web wings!!!!!!
🔥Spider-man🔥
Well, I see the gameplay of spiderman 2 and the black suit, but i think to me that in spider man web of shadows is better gameplay black suit;)
I’m sold…
This looks incredible! I'll be there day one!
miles w the symbiote mf overpowered
Pls make it xbox aswell
They better have Web of Shadows mechanics,  or I will be upset, like in 2018
noo its only on ps5 😭😭😭
This is going to be epic and I hope there a peter vs miles boss fight that be sick
Well, I guess I’ll quit drugs and get back at gaming ❤
I used to pray for times like this
See you in ten years
when peter threw the civilian after saving him😂
This game can win the GOTY 🥶
How about a 4k trailer?
Ps4 Yes?pls
OMG 😱 yesssssssss
6:48 bro , I thought that was Carnage.
So good
5/24/23 5:21pm
I was hoping for a revamped swinging system and mechanics…tasm 2 style swinging…but this looks good nonetheless…and let’s not forget this is technically the first thing we’ve go for this game  So there’s probably a ton more mechanics for traversal and combat that they didn’t show in this…hopes are high
Now this is epic 🗿
If this Peter doesn't dance awkwardly, I'm going to riot. THEY HAVE TO INCLUDE IT!
no ps4? 🥺
I adore the fact that the switches between Miles and Peter´s gameplay is shown in the music, the background sounds take the soundtracks of both of their videogames, but because of the symbiote, Peter´s is allways on a rush. I know the wait will be worth it!!
PLEASE LET THERE BE A PLAYABLE VENOM PLEAAAAAAASE
Can’t wait 2 play dis
now to wait 10 years  so i can play it on pc
Finaly! Prototype returns!
My mouth was literally open the whole time with amazement during the gameplay look at how beautiful the actions are
Peter with the exaggerated swagger of an alien symbiote
They need to do some real work on the HUD cause man, too much stuff. Map too small etc.
“HE’S GONNA WISH HE NEVER CAME TO NEW YORK!” Oh that voice range is gonna be so good this game.
This got me so hyped man. We are in for a real good time Fr I can’t wait.
Yep buying
I kinda dislike starting the game off as black spiderman rather than kinda building up to it but this may be like half way through the game so
Ебаааааать ахуенннооо 😍😍😍😍
EPIC
Every tim I think I’m threw playing games smh
Okay come on how tf is miles flying😐 3:55
I really feel the Sasuke come out when Spider man is angry
symbiote is control peter's mind make spider-man turns to darkside.
Symbiote Spider-Man talks like Michale de santa on gta 5 when he gets mad
As a person without a ps5 i cant wait to play this in 29379473 years on pc
Han cambiado muchas cosas pero es la ostia
I am going to say it right now.  Just from what I am seeing, this might end up being one of the greatest games ever made!  Omg I'm stoked!!!
I wonder how miles lightning is blue
So uhh Xbox players how’s high on life going or whatever you guys have rn?
Quando eu Platinar vou voltar aqui para comentar se valeu a pena... minha única preocupação nesse trailer foi a queda de FPS , temos um exemplo recente do Jedi Survivor.... NÃO FAÇAM IGUAL, PELO AMOR DE DEUS , nova geração.
I want to play this game sooo bad please make it for the PS4 PLEASE!!!! I love the 1st and Miles Morales game.
Yes,the true black suit is in the game,man i need a ps5!
The voice is so forced lol
I was her3
WAOOOOO I LOVE SPIDER MAN
Wow wow wow wow wow!!!!!
I hope that peter is going to get new animation , because the most of animation was from the old spiderman game . I hope they gonna change it ♥️
I am sorry Peter is killing people
12 minutes of pure awesome! This might be the first time I get the collector's edition of a game.
Remember wolverine game?
You here in peters voice the rage and anger in him that venoms bringing out around 3:00
2:27 Best Spider-Man entrance.
WOW!!! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! Game of the Year!! 🙌
This games gonna be dark
I just hope that when venom shows up in the game, it’s eddy brock as venom and not Harry Osborn.
lmao QTE fest. How disgusting. This is what happens when Playstation studios started caring more about a cinematic experience rather than a gaming experience.
Is this game going to include the other bronx' of new York in the map?
It feels like they tried less than on the first part! The visual is worse, the gameplay, at least in this passage, has not changed much, and the vibe is not as cool from the villains as in the first part! Personally, I'm waiting for a serious plot with the Goblin, because the conditional Venom is already fed up.  Yeah...and symbiote costume... it's SOOOO BAD....
There prepping for a spidey and miles fight and I’m all for it
Pov: you have an xbox
SO here's a question: if this game hinges on Venom abilities for Peter, do we lose suit customization options?
Miles morales is way too op
Looks great, if only my wallet wasnt suffering
This is going to be the greatest game of all time.
This is FIRE
I love how the Symbiote suit looks fleshy and organic. It looks like hes actually covered in the symbiote and not just wearing a black suit. I also love that hes embracing the power of the symbiote by using the tendrils and stuff more. It looks awesome.
QUE EMOCIOOOOOON LPTMREEEEEEEEE
This looks great. Hopefully the developers get all the time they need to polish it
I play X box 😭
Can’t wait to play as Bully Lowenthal
Ps4 😭
11:36 "He got way from US" he's not talking about him and Miles though
Wow this game looks absolutely fantastic. That venom stuff man…
I CANT WAIT FOR THISSSSSSSSSSSS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA but i dont have a ps5 :,)
I had no idea the voice actor who played Pete was the dude who dubs sussy uchia
Took so long for them to make a trailer i forgot about this game.
This is not spider man 2 this is prototype 3.
Finally, this dinamyc is way better than Web of Shadows.
Lizard looks demonic
Absolutely amazing!!
Joss 😊❤
"I always believed, that with great power comes great responsibility, but I never knew what power was" - Spider-man web of shadows
We eating good
This will go down in history as one of PlayStation's greatest Spiderman game.
they went all put w dis game omg
I feel like I have been waiting years for this 🤷🏻‍♂️
Sasuke mad as hell.
alright it's official I'm a yuri lowenthal fan
😍😍😍
Love the killer crock Godzilla style lizard
The combat with the black suit is just like from spiderman web of shadows!
Yoooo Peter getting scary this is insane!!! Miles v Peter would make this GOTY. We up 1000
The subtle takeover of the symbiote on Peter’s character is amazing. Overall its obvious, but the little actions - like Spiderman dropping the civilian at 11:32 - are a great touch
I wonder how many trial and errors they went through to get all the timing right with the combos and mechanics
Straight prototype vibes
oh man... another Spider-Man game to make me cry at the end after someone dies... I can't wait ❤
Kraven looks sick
in the first spiderman fight scene spiderman says leave connors alone, sooooo we know who the lizard is now
11:32 He's not like that and I love it!!!! You can see Miles reaction, like: Bro, you just dropped a civilian...
It better not take 4 years to get this properly onto PC this time..
kinda disappointed that the web swinging didn't really get overhauled/changed to make it harder and more engaging... but at least it looks cool
Shouts out to Miles for having a kamekamha
We have Venom, Lizard and Kraven. Who other 3 villains?
Ah peter or miles is going be boss fight ain't they? Not looking forward to that
Can’t wait to see the number of comments flooding GodzillaMendoza( not a Spider-Man channel) telling him to talk about this.
I am so happy to have a ps5
I really hope we get a spiderman on spiderman boss fight. Also DAYUM THAT AINT NO LIZARD THATS A DINOSAUR
Insomniac is the best thing that ever happened to the Spider-man franchise.
it’s so insane!!!
Looks super fun! UI looks horrible though 😬
Peter just throwing that guy to the ground is icing in the cake. I hope the symbiote alters his personality as slow as possible before the inevitable confrontation
F in chat for the Hunters.
Why do I feel a miles vs Peter thing happening
I love the trailer! But I really hope that you guys add more realistic hair physics. I mean look at the Witcher 3, a game almost 10 years old and it’s able to pull that off. So there’s no excuse!
if the symbiote suit gets its own alternate suits i need a web of shadows suit
I'll keep it quick. GAME OF THE YEAR.
This is AWESOME, I simply cannot wait for this to come out so I can play it!
THIS GAME WILL BE SO GOOD
So whose game is this? This feels more like miles with Peter as a helpful antagonist
4:47 dude didn't see that? Come on 🤦🏽‍♂️  And 12:04 how was he doing that in the air 😂
Getting some real 'SHOCKERRRRRRRRRRRRR' vibes here.
It’s been almost two years finally
Black Suit animations are exceptional, can’t wait for this!
Finna be some peak right here!!
love the subtle change to peters eyes to look like venoms when he says "So do I"
Wow this was really good. Expectations are very high for me 🤞
juri doesnt do menacing or intimidating very well but im still about to platnium that game 😂😂
🔥🔥🔥GET EM SONY!!! TOOK YA LONG ENOUGH
It looks kinda meh, expected more
a bigger map 👀
Oh my god we actually have gameplay  5:18pm May 24 2023, Wednesday
What taking so long?
Love the VA, graphics, and gameplay. This 5 years of waiting was so worth it! This game is gonna be awesome!
Wowthat gliding is awesome
Reminds me of Spider-Man: Web of Shadows.
It’s Spider-Man 3 and Web of Shadows mixed into ONE 🕷
3:40 attention to detail new plastic pole objects to swing off they bend providing massive launch. Awesome gliding parts on suit as well
Just cause wingsuit? Never heard of it 😅
I just 💩 myself
I expected more graphics quality
Kraven?
This is insane
Take my money
What if Kraven gets the symbiote 😮😮😮
Edgy peter time
HES GONNA WISH HE NEVER CAME TO NEW YORK that sounds terrifying hes clearly fighting back the symbiote within his own mind and doesnt even realize it, its trying to kill people, but hes fighting it back
Oooh, this'll be the game that gets me to buy a PS5. I'll probably beat it, then sell the PS5.
Охуеть и не встать…
Man, i was already so hyped for this game. This trailer... holy cow dude, the hype went to the sideral space and beyond, i'll definitely have to buy a ps5 after seeing this, and this is only the beginning of a great era of games I hope. And the symbiote on Peter, the classic symbiote suit, peter's anger and violence during combat, OMG! words can't describe my feelings right now, truly can't
3:11 had to be personal
THIS IS GOING TO BE FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!
This is going to be terrifying. I mean Peter is already scary aggressive with the symbiote. But that was him as a teenager. Now we are dealing with a Millennial Peter who has been through a whole lot more.
The hype is reallll!
Amazing video and l'm so hyped for this game :]
oh my god
Absolutely phenomenal, everything from Miles’s battle mechanics to the the malevolence of the Peters Symbiote suit, hell they manage to make it look more alien, game of the year calling it now.
Looks cool I’m disappointed they still have the same only one dodge animation where you have to press circle to dodge and if you don’t the bullets just follow you n it looks the same every time
Now, this does put a smile on my face
Am I the only one who thinks this looked like trash, even the graphics look like PS3 graphics especially the water
came back from school to see this!? today's gonna be a great day
HES SO EDGY!!!
WOOOOOOW THIS COULD BE THE BEST SPIDER-MAN GAME EVER!!!!!
Sasuke took over I see
3:11 whhhoooooooopppp 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
*slams credit card on desk* shuddup and take my money
A human RENGAR from lol
YES!  YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!
Leaving this here to tell myself that I was right and this was indeed one of the best sequels of all time
LETTSS GOOOO!
Alley oop!!! game of the year has to be
Man this looks really amazing
This game looks so good! I can't wait to see what they do with the symbiote and Dr. Connors...
Peter finna start saying the N word cos of the black suit
Can't wait to see how the symbiote affects how Miles and Peter interact, conflict between the two of them seems inevitable.
Anyone else noticed peter eyes changed when he said so do i 11:55
you can hear Sasuke Uchiha from symbiote spiderman
MILES HAS WEB WINGS WOOOOOOOO
It looks like the map will go further than the main island
Oh my god
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I love the lizard's design in this it actually looks menacing compared to any film/tv show adaptation
Having slingshot back in is so good
I already know that I will hate it when they take control of Peter away and give me Miles instead.
I don’t have ps5 I only have ps4😢
Epic!
Yo! A gliding mechanic!?!
wow, the dark side is strong with him
Having "Bully Maguire" as a playable character is what I've waited for!
WE GOT THE SYMBIOTE SUIT BOYS!!! TIME FOR THE VENOM SAGA TO BEGIN!!!
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen I am extremely excited thank you very much insomniac for making this this will probably become my new favorite game.
Why does Peter sound like matpat💀
They better not pull a god of war and not let us use the symbiote in the end game even if we loose the suit in the story because venom and stuff. I'd really want to use it in combat after the story and new game plus.
OMG YESSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!! FINALLY!!!!!!!!! The First Game is My Favorite Game of all time and Miles Morales was also So Amazing!!! I've Been Waiting SO Long for This Game and It's Finally Coming soon!!! IT LOOKS SO GOOD!!!!! I'M SOOOOOO EXCITED!!!!!!!!
Take my money !!!
This is the game I've always wanted as a kid, this is how I saw Web of shadows!  Looking forward to some more spidey action 🕷 ❤
See you in 10 years👶🏿
It feels kinda weird to me because Peter got the black suit when he was younger kinda wish the first game started when he was younger but ay this looks absolutely fire I’m buying it as soon as it comes out
Not into Peter having symbiote tentacle stuff. Always associated that more as an Eddie Brock thing and Peter's time with the symbiote just increasing his strength, stamina and aggression. Then again I've never really been a fan of symbiotes and think they've become way overused.
The way Peter dropped the civilian @ 11:32 😂 and Miles looks confused
This game looks sick hope it’s a long story
Oooooooooh, this is gonna be good
I know it’s going to be a long time but I can’t wait to play this on PC ! I don’t own a PlayStation but still hyped!
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HYPE!!!!!
I’ll always remember where I was when this gameplay dropped
Best representation of the black suit to-date
Lol me
symbiote suit looking mad clean ❤️‍🔥
THEY ADDED THE SLINGSHOT FROM SPIDERMAN 3 LETS GOOO!!  Peters swinging still feels kinda slow but we will have to see what city swinging looks like
Let’s see if anyone show up after 10 years to rewatch thissss🥰🥰🥰
graphics look awesome.
I’ll be honest, I’m slightly upset they showed this much. I would’ve preferred if I was playing the game and all I knew about it was the first trailer. Needless to say, this looks sick as hell, I’m surprised they went with such a simple symbiote design but it works
Omggg this is sickkk
It’s so obvious that Green Goblin will be the main villain of the new Spider-Man if you think about it for a second. Did we see Dr Octopus in a single trailer before the first game? Nope. They intentionally made us think Li would be the main villain. The second game also happens to revolve a lot around Harry’s sickness. Sounds a hell of a lot like a villain origin story for Norman. We even saw pumpkin bombs in his lab in the first game. I’m calling it right now! It might seem like a long shot right now, but trust me. Just wait and see.
I can’t stop watching this mannn
I wish that this was coming to ps4 as well like how the last one was on both.
GET BACK HERE SHOCKER!
And I just got platinum on miles morales, crazy
11:32 the way he just kinda tosses the guy and Miles showing concern 😬 Pete def gonna need someone to pull him back
this game looks amazing its like having an interactive movie
I really really hope Ghost spider appears then we get the full Trio!   Peter, Miles and Gwen.
This looks decent obviously can't say the game will be amazing yet till it releases since a lot of games release buggy at launch but this is looking interesting.
Peter's lost everything, his aunt and his uncle. It only makes sense if the symbiote if feeding off his anger from potentially losing Harry.
Oh yeah my body is ready for this
Sold
I love how miles & Peter both have different huds! (Look at there health bars)
venoms fx reminds me so much of that childhood game that was supposed to be a venom game(prototype) finally get to really have an actual venom gameplay this time around.
Движения Питера в чёрном костюме на помнили мне о Web of Shadows
So basically this is spider-man Miles Morales 2 I feel like this game will be more about Miles then Peter I garuntee you Peter dies at the end of the game and Miles becomes Spider man
LETS GO
Guarantee Miles shocks the suit off of Petter nearly killing him.
Hate how it uses the same animations and camera angles, HUD layout is also the same but the new mechanics look fire tho
STRAIGHT FROM A COMIC BOOK I LOVE IT
There’s a 100% chance that their friendship is gonna lead into a big battle
*Peter now: IM GONNA PUT SOME DIRT IN YOUR EYE!* 😂   Amazing trailer so hyped!
So no co op? 😢
Of all the spider man games that uses a symbiote this is the best one
why not give venom a proper intro? came out of nowhere on this reveal. I know there's the reveal video but it was short and a long time ago
Ayee
The graphics are a bit dull but overall game looks fire
i may have to buy a ps5 now lol
Better dust of Spider-Man and finish it.
Eh looks kinda mid
bro this is going to be so good😭🙏 and the details on showing peter’s emotions and actions changing are sooo good can’t wait
Should really look into making that black suit look better tbh...
this game looks amazing
This game looks like a lot of fun, can't wait
The way Spidey’s lens shifted at the end too when he said “so do I” @11:55
Is there an explanation for change in Miles venom lighting color? Yellow to Blue?
Seeing the ability of switching to Miles is such a letdown. Miles had his own game, now if it didn’t do good in sales doesn’t mean you get to add him to the main Spider-man’s game!
Dear insomniac games : "This is a premiere today 25th may 2023 and the game has quite the amazing gameplay and Graphics and story. It worth the wait. I am next for wolverine game and the rumoured daredevil one. Now leave a like and a heart for a happy spiderman day. EXCELSIOR !"...
Looks like PS4 Spider-Man's gonna put some dirt in some criminals' eyes
“He got away from us” I don’t believe us include miles…
This is GOTY for me!
Leaving my mark right here knowing I was here when it originally released
CHILLS LITERAL CHILLS!! Yuri loenalls performance has Peter is uncanny he has the right roughness of voice and still sounds like Peter but the line delivery was on POINT! And miles voice actor was amazing as well he sounds concerned for Peter as well as the fact that ganki IS A ROBO BIRD !!! Well done insomniac games CANT WAIT TO PLAY IT!!!!
Well this is already looking like a masterpiece
Take my money pls
I don't like the fact that you have to wait until the different attacks recharge after using them.
this is a masterpiece!!
No no i can't take this hype anymore
These game get better and Better. Unlike the Avengers game. But anyway, This Spider-Man games are so incredible for sure.
Take my money
Tombstone!!
Nice
I can already tell this game is gonna be insane!
This is Kraven  not aome anti hero environmentalist.. hes literal the opposite xD
game of the year fs
Yes, the map size is bigger and cannot wait to explore Queens and Brooklyn even Venom. This game is for sure massive!   I’ll probably play Marvel Spider-Man & Miles Morales again before Spider-Man 2 comes out in September, and More Gameplay should come soon and you should be excited for this game because I am too!
They included Queens my god
Poor Peter… he sounds so tired
Yuri Lowenthal’s Sasuke is showing in that Symbiot Spidey. I ABSOLUTELY FREAKING LOVE IT. *GAME OF THE YEAR FOR SURE*
These improvements are great I hope they continue to improve stealth like the Arkham knight with counters to spiderman's tactics and medics and stuff in the next game. They added gliding and improved swing speed which everyone asked for they really care about the fans and that's wonderful.
THIS WAS AMAZING!
This game looks good
Spider-man looks like a black jellybean. Already a 10/10 game
The tone of Peter's voice really captures the emotion of him being in Symbiote suit.
Lets gooooooooo thank thank thankk
LET’S GOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
If there isn't a "GET BACK HERE SHOCKEEEEEER! I'LL TO THE ENDS OF THE EAAAAARTH!" I'm not buying it.
Let's... fking... go!!!! 💯💯💯 I played the first one back when it came out and it stuck with me. I became a super Saiyan at the game and got into miles morales, I've been waiting to beat some villains skulls in with the black suit.
spiderman
this makes me want carnage in game so bad
ITS CRAZY!!!! I LOVE SPIDER MAN
Looks great. I was concerned with how they'd balance a story with two Spider-Men, but it looks like the symbiote and its influence on Peter will be used to be complicate their relationship. I wouldn't be surprised if at some point, Miles will be forced to stop Peter from crossing the line and will need to save him from the symbiote.
This is insane
Ok
This is my reason for buying a PS5.
3:43 fiiiinaaaaallyyyy!!! Web-sling shot !!!
Rais is that you?
Why I'm feeling we're getting a miles vs peter boss fight hahaha can't wait
Why do i have a feeling that the Symbiote is going to take full control of Peter and miles will have to stop him?
let's gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
THIS IS THE BEST TRAILER I HAVE EVER SEEN ❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
So no one gonna mention THE WING SUIT!!!!! Looks like it controls a little like just cause 3 and that was insanely good
Finally Web of Shadow 2
Where are the avengers?!?
This is going to be top 10 games oat
Jesus, Lizard is huge and more terrifying than ever! 🦎 🦖
So mad it’s only on ps5
PETER REALLY IN HIS FIVE KAGE SUMMIT ARC
this was so engaging bro just watching made me hype up I have really high hopes for this sequel. definitely a step up in combat and cinematic but the subtle changes  in peter's body language is so good, a game made with passion and perfection in mind.
I wonder when will GTA 6 come out
Oh sh😮t
peak
All i hear is Rick the door technician
HOLY
I'm excited for this game
I hope it come on the ps4 to I dont wznt to buy a console so I can just play this
Is spiderman's voice actor yosuke from persona 4? He sure sounds familiar
Jungs das Spiel wird auf jeden Fall krass sein, bin richtig gespannt darauf🫠
OMG I LOVE THIS NEW SPIDER-MAN GAME AND I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY IT🕷🤟🕸😃❤️
I’m here an hour after they posted yay
I didn’t want to buy a ps5 but this game makes me want to buy it
Yuri bringing out that inner sasuke for this game and I love it 😂
This looks bad what happend to the lighting in the water fight  it looks like a optimised mobile game like we all expected more marvel and the people say thats its great just so they can be happy and ignore the truth
HUD looks kinda messy, but so stoked for this game!
I just need the raimi’s black suit :’)
I like how miles swinging is so clean and his attacks, it’s showed how much more skilled he’s gotten
Like prototype
I bet you're gonna have to fight Peter in the game.
Kraven the hunter, Venom , Lizard, spiderman and Miles togheter This is Legendary
This made 10 minutes feel like 2
Everythings looking great..Really hope theres a option to turn off those colorful button prompts,breaks the immersion for me it was better in previous game...
PUT IT ON XBOX
I'm kinda willing to kill somebody just to try it right now ngl.
Sony making it look easy to release a good Quality game without waiting a decade in between releases.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro, this game is gonna insane! I can't wait for venom's look in this
Watch Insomniac do a better Kraven the Hunter than Columbia Pictures/Sony.
Gotta leave a comment here 20 years from now we'll look back on how much games have improved so much visually and gameplay wise
Please make another good game. No politics, no unnecessary changes for the sake of representation
Es descabellado pensar que Venom es el mismo peter cuando el simbionte lo posea completamente?
Immediate changes look incredible. Will be a few more years before it hits steam but very excited
Spider man games never disappoint👌
Oh no I bet we’re going to see Peter be mean to or even attack Miles because of the symbiote! They’re going to Spider-Man 3 this sucka!!
Looks incredible we will be buying
For a moment there I thought I was back in a movie theater
What about the Wolverine game? Is it sleeping?
Looks like this game will soon overtake the batman Arkham games for sure.
5:00 Looks like Goku taught Miles the Kamehameha.
Okay....alright! I'm excited again....my heart's pumping!  I loved the diversity of it but not sure if I saw that many new web swinging animations. I know that their style won't change drastically but web swinging is the best part of it and I think I would rather swing than use the wings. But, loved the story elements and other parts of it
All i hope is they change that hud design i miss the old simple but nice looking one if they could re implement that with a few tweaks for each character and variation thatd be great, still im loving this game and cannot wait
Oh my God they really made it like web of shadows which is my all time favourite
3:43 THE TOBEY CANNONBALL
Well it's gonna be a depressing wait to get a PS5 you guys enjoy it in the mean time.
If you think Sony and Insomniac are about to get rich, you're wrong. Jonah Jameson is going to sleep in money soon.
MOON NIGHT??
What happened is this a joke or something it looks and feels nothing like the other two did none of the people that worked one the others work on this it is like a weird bad ratchet and clank
Flights on the web have not been completed. Why does inertia come from nowhere?
Наконец-то!!!
Sadly it will take years to come to PC at best. Screw exclusives, you'll get no money from me because of it.
Finally !!!!
I wish it was multiplayer or co-op but if u can switch anytime I'm good with that
Nah this too fire y’all outdid y’all selfs 😭
Wut giganuts!
q jogo daqui a 5 anos eu volto pra relembrar 😁🔥🔥
And that's how you get someone to buy a PS5.
peter really going sasuke this game
Game of The Year and it’s not even out yet
spidey a straight murderer BAHAHAHA
Хуета. Полёты на паутине так и не доделали. Почему инерция берётся из ниоткуда?
LETS GOOOOOO
Go Woke Go Broke, I'm not going to buy it.
I really don't like the idea that the symbiote makes Peter Parker more aggressive; that idea comes from the 1990s cartoon and isn't in the comics. Other than that minor quibble, this looks amazing (pun intended)
It seems that Miles still has the exaggerated swagger of a black teen.
I really like how the symbiote is affecting Peter's mind... His voice is changing like he wants to kill them, but still in the "No Kill, Hero Rule"
Wow!! Time to upgrade my PRO to a 5. 😁😁
Sick dude poggers
IDC HOW MUCH IT COST JUST TAKE MY WALLET 💰💰💰🗣🗣🗣
This is a bad moment to do not have a PS5
daddy
Desing of black suit in Web Of Shadows was more cool, but this one is awesome also.
Hey zion from 2023
i wish insomniac good luck for all the hard works they've done for this game. surely its gonna be the game of the year. if not, u guys can bash me in the comments, i wont mind😂😅
This game is going to be crazy🔥🔥🔥
Great now where’s Logan
Third time watching
Eu vi o lancamento de Marvel's Spider-Man, se tornou me jogo favorito após jogar  Vi o lançamento de Miles Morales, se tornou meu jogo favorito após jogar  Vi o trailer de Marvel's Spider-Man 2, acho que me apaixonei por um jogo antes mesmo de lançar.
THAT IS SO DESTROY LONELY
11:31 You can even see Peter just yeeting the civilian out of the way lol
No comments about we finally get to see Queens.
Reminds me of web of shadows
This game will be what forces me to buy a PS5. I'm not waiting for the PC release.
Can’t wait
Wb Montreal should take notes from Marvel on how to make a fun Super hero game
Insomniac has outdone itself. If this presents with minimal bugs at launch.... Game of the Goddamn Year🔥🔥🔥
Holy mother of god
A++
5 minutes in…I’m sold.
That ain’t the lizard, that’s a whole kaiju  Also really like how Pete’s “mask” looks like it has a closed mouth. Like venom is trying really hard not to give itself away
Marking my spot for ten years time
والله اللعبه جميل جدا عن الأجزاء الفتات ❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Spiderman is doing well on media right now, i tell ya. Last live action was pure fan service and the sony spiderverse movies are good. But videogames are killin it! This is gold! 🤯😍
The dark side of Peter Parker
GAME OF THE YEAR INCOMING
Eurgh. New York again
They're gonna really shove Miles Morales down our throats in this one. I'll wait for it to go on discount. Deep discount.
Nobody talking about Kraven.He’s badass and I think he’ll make for a great villain.
Love how they are handling Pete's personality change with the suit. He's still helping civilians but throwing them aside instead of gently bringing them down, and cutting off Miles instead of bantering. The new abilities for both of them look so fun too! Definitely excited for this
I been waiting 5 years
Now you're just showing off :)
Is it me or does it look a bit weird or “dead”. The first game looked so alive and beautiful but this gives off TASM 2 vibes?
So excited for this!
What's up with the no release date? I guess they're keeping the release window until they're certain there will be no delays? You know, I'm down with that.   But if a delay is needed, what are the chances it stays in the window? Insomniac games are usually really polished...
WE HERE BOYS!!
Мощно Плойки нет, жду на ПК релиза через пару лет, выглядит очень круто. Я как раз задавался вопросами, почему на воде замесов не было, тут завезут теперь Каеф, и вопросов много по сюжету, интересно будет!  P. S. Вижу недовольных по поводу полёта, оставив их такими же. Лол, а зачем это менять? Полёты отличные, разные приёмы в воздухе и прочее, это то, что не стоит менять и оно смотрится хорошо также и сейчас Полёты одно из лучших что в этой игре есть, вы чего ________________ Powerfully There is no curling iron, I'm waiting for a PC release in a couple of years, it looks very cool. I was just wondering why there were no batches on the water, they will bring it here now Kaef, and there are a lot of questions about the plot, it will be interesting!  P.S. I see those who are dissatisfied with the flight, leaving them the same. Lol why change that? Flights are great, different tricks in the air and stuff, this is something that should not be changed and it looks good even now Flying is one of the best things in this game, what are you
This looks amazing
I can’t wait for this game!
I would have never expected game play to be this good. Now I'm going to forget about this comment and rewatch this video 10 years from now. Then see this comment of me predicting that 💀
This game gone be dumb
I left for an hour, what the hell is this?!?!?
DC could never.
Amazing
Amazing!
I've always wanted to play as Bully Maguire, finally
Yes its here🎉🎉🎉
YESSSSSSSS!!!!! OMFGGGG 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love the black suit actually looking Organic and alive
Finalmente slc
This video game will Make me wanna come back to playing and even getting the ps5😍
I LOVE THE BRUTALITY AND THE SYMBIOTE SUIT IS BEAUTIFUL
Yoo Kraven letss goo
Ahh the game looks incredible! However I have two concerns. I was a bit disappointed by peter’s lack of new swinging animations. There are some subtle changes to them but one can clearly tell they’ve been reused from the previous game. Also, at some parts during the gameplay, the graphics were kinda not up to standard that I imagined. They lacked detail. There’s still a few months left so hopefully this will be improved for the final result.
Miles Morales is Miles Morales, Peter is Spiderman
I love all the subtlety that peter is REALLY different by the end when he saved the bystander at 11:30 He usually lets the people down gently and even reassures them, instead he kinda just threw him down like dead weight. It was even noticed by Miles.
Hope we can see people in windows
Love how faithful they were with kraven’s look .  Cant wait to see this play out.
Now this is Game of the Year material.
I'm so freaking hyped for this game man! It looks so good. Pff this will be insane.
PS3?
I can’t wait 💯💯
They brought back the slingshot
I hope the fantastic four are in this game and reed helps peter get rid of the symbiote. I also hope the game gets delayed and graphically upgraded more and they make it feel more realistic and play to look realer , I hope that they take their time with wolverine. So disappointed in this.
Ohhhh the wait was SO worth it
Do you have contactless payement ?
Game looks amazing! Honestly, insomniac should be really proud of themselves, the gameplay they showed was a sight to behold
Just give it goty already
I noticed that the suit looks exactly the same as Tom Holland’s black suit maybe for his new trilogy with Sony and Marvel
Es una joya visual valio la espera cada maldito segundo
It’s a pass or wait for sale for me.
Mükkkkk
4:49 Did Miles just teleport or was he just really really really fast?
I want this game NOW 😍
Who came up with the design of the venom spider ??? Bro, you screwed up ((( The mods in the first spider looked much cooler
If they don't release this on steam same day it's just a confirmation they hate money.
I wonder how he'll explain to his Miles that he and other Spider-Man hunted down another Miles in another dimension
Just wish it was on Xbox
Black suit Spiderman got black Air Force activity
Miles Morales:Shock Kamehameha
See y’all in 10 years when it has become a legend
Vamos q vamos   são tempos de caça 😮!!
Yes
Let's be honest who else got chills watching this
3:10 that move was personal
Bro Is sasuke
That symbiote suit looks kinda ugly idk
Should have made it co op 😢
Wait, no one’s talking about Yuri Lowenthal as symbiote Peter??? Guy nailed it..!!
This game looks awesome. Fans were heard and the delivery was excellent on the Symbiote suit. Can’t wait to play!
Immediately hitting us with Peter with the Venom Symbiote, the difference in Miles and Peter's HUDs with their respective swinging styles, switching from him to Miles with a couple new moves in mobility plus the Web Glider, Mile's Venom Lightning got a revamp, you can now create tight-ropes for yourself during stealth sections, and the sheer anger and agression in Peter's voice which is a first instead of the usual quips and one liners.
fireeee🔥
I'm buying a ps5 rn
YOU SAY TOGETHER. PLEASE BE CO OP!!!!!
Yuri is amazing.
miles is gonna use his bioelectricity to remove the symbiote from peter. You can literally tell from the "together" sign at 12:17 . Can't wait to see these 2 spider-men fight each other in the game instead of through the comics!
I’m bout to blow
Take my money
Yuri bringing out the Sasuke Uchiha for Edgelord Peter Parker. Loving it haha
Black suit Spidey for the win, But 1 of these days, that Alien's symbiote has gotta go, And by that I mean, Spidey needs to get rid of it.
ILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
1:28 it said “Wraith”! That must mean Yuri Watanabe from the first game is making a comeback!
Wow Spider-Man 2 looks Fantastic!!! Need to get a PS5 <3
Any word on a special PS 5 with the game like they did on PS 4?
The strain in Peters voice makes it sound like he’s actively fighting against the symbiote trying not to lose himself
can't wait!!! 🙌
crying tears of joy
Cool
This is gonna be amazing pun intended
Since insomniac spider man is going to be in across the spider verse, will he talk about it in this game, if so, 10/10 automatically.
Wooooooooo!! Can’t wait
Did Miles just hit them with that Kamehameha?
Look how peter is affected by the symbiote and his voice with venom is just perfect. Furthermore we got Lizard, Kraven, Venom, Taskmaster, Prowler, Black Cat and more. It's gonna be the best superhero game ever.
Yoooooooii
Amazing
Wonder if Sony will f*** up the Kraven the Hunter movie and when the first trailer gets released online?!
alr so no need to lie, its looks amazing without wather effects bro
Peter is gonna go BALLISTIC with the new symbiote suit.
Gonna take GOTY! Claiming it now!
Miles looks absolutely broken. I wanna see Pete gameplay without the symbiote since that’s how we will be playing most of the game.
raganarök >
Miles is definitely gonna fight symbiote Peter at some point
I noticed Taskmaster also on the tablet that Kraven looks at (it's a single frame 1:34) I'm hoping we see more of him, especially with Symbiote Peter.  (Edit: In the same frame, it's hard to see but I'm pretty sure that's Shocker as well)
Oh baby this looks good
Yep definitely buying dis game 👌🏾😮‍💨
3:11 jeez 😧Peter calm down
nah this looks insanely cool
Lizard makes sense he was teased in the ending of miles morales (he was the scientist helping Norman)
I hope they make a venom game where it’s as dark and gloomy as Batman Arkham knight
Symbiote Spider-Man sounds like matpat
hope the map is bigger like you can visit statue of liberty would be cool if you fight miles vs peter both have the symbiote
MAN I wish this would come on PC 😭
based gameplay reveal
The explosion texture at 8:38 and overall texture quality (splashes for example) say a lot. Because this is bad, honestly. PS4 level graphics. But lightning is great so everything looks fancy. Don’t get fooled, rewatch and pay close attention to textures  Also characters models and some facial animations are really questionable in terms of quality.   Also what is this UI? Straight from a mobile game.   Obviously I am excited, but cautiously, because there is a lot of warning signs
Spiderman 2 looks amazing and Black suit Spiderman looks awesome I love how he gonna slowly get darker and violent from Venom and so looking forward to the game coming out
Miles: he's got big teeth  Peter: so do I Bro, you can't tell me that that line wasn't cold as 🤬🤬🤬
Man this is gona be so good!
So we are getting an R-Rated Kraven the Hunter movie now we have Kraven in a new Spider-Man game
Yuri uses his Sasuke voice for Black Suit Spidey
Goddamn, Yuri absolutely killed this! Seriously, I've always been impressed by his ability ever since Legion of superheroes and he's only improved with time; fantastic performance
Can't wait for this
The water physics look a bit wack, but other than that I'm really excited
12:06 probably because he couldn’t save May’s life or maybe MJ dies in this game. Who knows what will happen in this upcoming game, but I am so excited. 😃
Hyped as hell for this lesss goooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love that Peter is not only aggressive, he’s anxious. I’m also glad he isn’t being mean to miles, just dismissive.
YOOOOOOOOO THIS IS HARDDDD😭😭😭😭
Welp. Guess I HAVE to get a ps5 now
Game of the year
Calling it, this Kraven will be WAY better than the movie version 😂.
Can't wait to play this on xbox
Peter was never the same after Mj left him :(
So what showed Yuri the '90s animated Spider-Man and was like Yeah just act like that Spider man. I hope they do a reference with shocker
Peter got the black air force energy
The tagline "Be Greater Together" has a double meaning. The two Spider-Mans are teamed up in this one, and they are striving to be greater (better people) while working together. However, Peter is also being influenced by the symbiote, which makes him more powerful when he wears it. Greater (more powerful) the more the suit and him fuse together.
We need Shokeeeeeer in this game 😁
We got kraven, the lizard, venom this game has is all
THEY COOKED THEY SEASONED THEY DELIVERED AND WE FINISHED IN SECONDS.
11:01 peter do nothing miles safes the people
When is it coming out exactly 🤦‍♀️
Prototype 3 looks... OK...
I like the Lizard’s design here! Very Arkham-esque! That’s how he should’ve looked in the movies! On a side note, I wonder if Mysterio and Sandman will be bosses too?
I knew it! If Kraven is coming to New York, there's NO WAY he's going to pass up on the chance to hunt the Lizard.
HELL YEAH
😮😮 my face when it said switch to Miles! This game is gonna be unbelievable can’t wait
2 spider men vs kraven
HOLY F... DUDE! This is not just the best Spider-Man game ever, I'm telling you guys this is huge, this will be one of the best so far. 90's and 2000's kids are getting the goosebumps!
Prototype vibes
Bro is angry. Can’t wait
Broooo this is amazing
Glad to see they've put in a fast gadget use mechanic into the game just like in the arkham series. Really missed that in the first game
NOBODY GONNA TALK ABOUT THEM ADDING THE WEB LAUNCH BACK!!!
The graphics are insane🔥🔥
Please tell tme this is coming for PC as well...sooner rather than later
Todo lo novedoso, diseño del simbionte, combate con el mismo y esa interaccion de los cambios de Miles y peter estan increibles. los diseños 10/10 ese lagarto impone muchisimo. El juego pinta para ser mejor o igual de genial que el primero. Mucho hype
Never thought I’d see the day sasuke and Spider-Man mix 😭😭
HYPEEEW
Bully Maguire confirmed canon
It would be cool if in one point we have 3 playable characters just like GTA V. Peter, Miles and Eddie. And when you change characters you can see what the other is doing in the city just like GTA V
Release in pc ASAP🥲
Kraven😊
Looks like my boy Miles' gonna have to kick Peter's rear end.
This is what the Spider-Man MCU should look like. Outstanding trailer.
That...Was...AWESOME!!! The Chorography, The Effects, The Scene Ecstatic. All of it was a massive Wet Kiss. Even Black Suit Spidy here is Just an aggressive  hardcore badass His move set and skills love Godly And I also love how miles handles in this game. Even that scene where miles is just looking for lizard Feels like your in a horror movie Around the same level uneasy as a Tim burton movie and i love, i can't wait to play! This Gameplay reveal alone Has More passion The Entire MCU Phase 4. Change My Mind!!
Where's PASTE POT PETE!!!!
The gliding mechanics are a great add on & the black spider-man suit & miles mechanics look amazing. Cant wait to see more
2 black Spider-Man’s, 2 exaggerated swaggers
IM MORE EXCITED TO SEE HOW THE STORY PLAYS OUT THAN I AM FOR THE ACTUAL GAMEPLAY EVEN THOUGH WE FINALLY GET THE ALL BLACK SYMBIOTE SUIT! GREAT JOB GUYS
We need more games with mouse and keyboard support. Most games don't even have deadzone or threshold settings for controller, it's like aiming with the directional buttons. At the very least mouse and keyboard support for single player/co-op games.  I just want the best experience from these games. I can't even go back and play older games because the controllers are so bad, same thing will happen with today's games.
Peters “symbiote” voice is a little cringey, but this looks to be an amazing game!
amazing, watch the entire video, so entertaining
The brutality and anger shown in the symbiote is brilliant! Peter also fights aggressively as well! 10/10 combat looks amazing! Wonder if we will get a symbiote boss fight..
Ufffff tingles going up
Kraven looks sick!
i would have liked a bigger venom like tom hardy movie version
Slingshot and Wingsuit! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2023 A GOOD SPIDER MAN YEAR
I need to get a PS5…..
I dont have a ps5 but im buying this anyway
Hello future me cause I will be looking at this game
Only on ps5 is sad 😢
On top of kraven and venom i hope Black Cats fine self has a bigger part or is at least in this game.
This qas the only good thing during the showcase
I just hope Kraven doesn't get cucked out of being the main villain by Venom or Green Goblin at the end of the game dude deserves the spotlight for once.
This looks absolutely phenomenal. From the city, the gameplay, the character models. Insomniac, you guys are the GOATS. 🙌
This is so realistic.
Take my money
Straight W
jesus da graphics insane
I love you, I love every Spider-Man fan here. Please keep loving Spider-Man.❤
PETER PARKER BOSS FIGHT PETER PARKER BOSS FIGHT. WE GONNA FIGHT THE BIG MAN PETE AND THE BIGGER MAN V
IN INSOMNIAC WE TRUST!!!!!!!!!!
What are these chapter names? 😂
Oh boy it's Web of Shadows 2 😩
KRAVEN IS CLEAN 10/10
Did anyone see when miles used his lightning powers, his ribs literally lit up? Such sick effects! Amazing! 😍
venom = Prototype 3
I can’t wait to become the goopy boi himself venom!!!!
Meh Huge fan of Spiderman games since childhood. Hope would not be such a disappointment like first one.
🤯🤯🤯
Бля ) Во вселенной игры человек паук существует уже больше 8 лет, и крейвен типа о нем никогда до этого даже не слышал ? )
W and a L since it’s not on Xbox
Increible, estamos ante el siguiente nivel! Esta 2da parte nos llevará aún más lejos, me consume la emoción ver tal calidad de juego, como todo ha evolucionado  y LO TENDREMOS PARA ÉSTE OTOÑO, Marvel´s Spider-man 2! Uff!
y’all caught wraith on the screen right? 1:28
EEEEEEEE
Peter is going to release his inner Bully Maguire in this one.
The Next Gen Has Arrived LFG
I really wish theyd change VA for Miles
Yes, Yes. YEEEEEEESSSSS
Insomniac did it again!  The gameplay is so beautiful.  Peter in the black suit reminds me of Kraven’s Last Hunt saga in the comics.  I have Marvel’s Spider-Man and Miles Morales.  I can’t wait to play Marvel’s Spider-Man 2!  🤓🕸️🕷️
I don’t like yuri lowenthals voice
I hope that the suit in the fights can be torn or damaged
GOTY 🚬🗿
This game has some best graphics ever....can't wait for this one 😮😮😮
As an Xbox gamer, I really wish I could play this game and the first one. (They) look(s) amazing!
NICAGANDO
Please tell me y’all also saw TaskMaster on Kravens pad!!
This is the best thing that happend to PS after The Last of Us series
I defo wanna see yuri vs black spiderman what is he finna do 💀💀💀
Haha I'm in love all over again
11:32 that detail of peter pushing the person to ground after saving him. Shows the effect of wearing venom. That's really cool. (Edit: also the way miles looks at peter when he threw the person. )
I really hope that we’ll be able to have our suits and moves from the other games be accessible to our saves on Spider-Man 2, as I really don’t wanna have to grind for more suits and moves again, kinda like how Tears of The Kingdom let you have your horse from Breath of The Wild.
This game looks amazing, can't wait the gameplay was smooth and clean, love the new HUD too. And I love the Symbiote suit slowly growing on Peter, mid-end game is going to go crazy, possibly with the development of Pete and the suit. 11/10 reveal btw
Oh that's gonna be good.
Now the real question: When's it coming to PC? 😂
so either this is the beginnning and later we got the venom flashback, or this is in the middle of the story progress i cant wait for the story on how both take down venom
this is amazing fantastic to invested in this plot ah
How long until this gets a PC release?
IVE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS GAME & ITS WAYYYY BETTER THAN I IMAGINED. THANK YOU FOR THIS EXTENDED PLAY!!
I hope that we get to fight Peter when the the symbiote starts acting up
Yup that’s me sold
This game looks soooo good
Sooooo when are pre orders 😅
Cringe Star Wars is better
I just had the biggest orgasim ever
Tapped into his Sasuke Uchiha fr.....   This gameplay was so sick! And the detail on the symbiote is spot on it looks alive and goo like instead of a lean material suit...
Hol up so kraken was ginnabtry and hunt taskmaster 😂
Yuri inner Sasuke came out
kinda hate the ui of the game
Justo cuando pense que no saldria un juego bueno este año, me traen esto, haorros fijos en un objetivo, se no que conserva siertas mecanicas de los juegos previos, y haora con el simbionte y el traje negro ya tienen mi dinero asegurado 🤩🤩🤩
Spooder man
Bro so hyped for this game for anyone seeing this comment in the future I hope it was worth it
"Eddie, i am in a video game now!!"
I wonder how many years it'll take before this becomes available on PC.
that looks amazing, story is super promising!
I never thought I’d see Spider-Man take out a JetSki
i hate the twitch users the entire time this was on they were like L game I was about to smack a hoe
Amazing!
DLC
We Spider-Man fans eating good bro😂😂😂
He sounds really angry
Wish they hadn't shown the symbiote on Peter, it's gonna be a HUGE plot element on how it get off Harry, onto Peter, and then back onto Harry to create Venom.
Spiderman jumping out from the water surface that makes sense
While I do miss the orange venom shock, the blue lightning looks so much cooler. And it connects Miles more to his spider verse self.
Se siente un Spiderman 3, pero más flipante!!! (Y con más cosas) 😮
I just hope what the story and venom arc will be long enough and masterpiece as it was in Spectacular spider-man. I have some paranoia, because of how great story was in 1 part and how... It wasn't good in DLC and Miles.
I feel like it's safe to assume that this is going to be one of if not the best year for gaming with spider man 2 mortal Kombat 1 and Jedi survivor all hard hitting games coming out all in this year ya we are in for a ride and I'm ready
I hate that they put Venom as the villain when he is the victim.
Looks like a ps4 game
I can’t wait brooo😭😭😭😭
Come back in 10 years and this will be remembered as the greatest spiderman game of all time
Bully Maguire activity…
This game looks insane. The fighting style and design are so incredible.
Peter: im gonna put some dirt in your eye
hopefully they waste no time porting this game to pc
I hope this is a reminder why wait for year or years for a new game is worth it
Bro Kraven is fire As hell
I’m so hype …. Also finally kraven the hunter is back 😊
Kraven the hunter i used to defeat him in old spiderman games i will be happy to defeat him now and make him hanging like spiderman 2 pc game
If venom is playable I’m buyin.
Looks fun too bad its half a thousand dollars for next gen consoles🥲
Wow! The game seems amazing! I can't wait for it to be released! And I'm so happy Symbiote Spider-Man appears.
11:49 That one scene. OMG VENOM YOU ALREADY HAD YOUR SPOTLIGHT. STAY OUT OF THIS!  STOOOOOOOP!
Can't believe this won GotY
Spider-Man 2  Be a better you!
7:43 maybe Harry MIGHT be Venom
Well it’s almost time to platinum this
i love the HUD changes between the two
GOTY
Tom Holland will definitely be required to play this game before the venom lore starts in the MCU.
I feel scared for Ganke, he said I don't have a stomach... Have you done something to my boy!?
This will be the greatest Spider-Man game of all time.
Looks like his gonna put some dirt in your eye
1:52 Who else thought Spider-man would be up in those trees?
👏 impressive! Insomniac,Marvel has done it again!! Even bigger and better than last time!
switching between spider-men mid fight is going to be so GOOD
sonunda amcik mukemmel spider oyunu
Spider-man 2   Does whatever 2 spiders can
love it 😭😭
I already love this game
If you're from the future, now tell me: ¿Is the game as good as it looks now? Because OH MY GOD, IT LOOKS GREAT
Guys we all know theres gonna be a Bully Maguire scene in this game and i can't wait
holy f*ck! this is hype!
WHEN IS IT COMING OUT
Cant wait to play this in my Pc in 2027
Yeah we're gonna have to fight Peter at some pont aren't we?
Eyes nearly started watering watching this, this looks INSANE 😭❤️ This game is really going to set the bar for games to come
Will this come on pc sooner than the other two
This is going to be the best game ever
i wish i had a ps5 this looks great
See me at 5 yer
Nice
This year is a epic year in gaming
Symbiotie spooder man is the best cuz he black
Can symbiote spiderman say the n-word…?
We getting feed this year Fr
I love that Miles is finally coming into his own, but yeah, I'm super scared for Peter.
Man, I am looking forward to playing this on pc. Eventually.
Game of the Year. I can already predict it
With all this rage I'm starting to hear sasuke instead of Spiderman 😂
Gives me web of shadows energy, the first game established he’s already encountered the black suit before so it’ll be interesting how he handles it in this one
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSS. FINALLY!!🤩❤️💙🕸🕷
HELL YEAH
Fall 2023 hurry tf up!
I’ve waited for five years. I can’t believe this is finally happening.
I’m thinking somewhere in the game Miles has to fight Peter because the symbiote got to his head like in the Sam Raimi movies
1:28 You can see Wraith, she really is in game
Now THAT is a lizard chase sequence. Talk about your first times for this sequel.
I can hear sasuke now fr 💀💀💀
Only few word needs to be said… TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!
I'm calling it right now: Peter is gonna be a boss battle.
Theres a sequel coming out??? Id literally just finished the first game!
Why are the graphics so bad? Will they be improved before the game's release?
I Expect yuri to know how to do dark Spider-Man since he is sasuke voice actor
BULLY MAGUIRE IS BACK!!!
10/10
God this looks amazing
symbiote suit is ugly, why isnt like the classic suit but black?
VOICE ACTING= CRINGE
So how was the game future me ?
Bro miles is gonna have to free Peter from the symbiotic. He’s gonna figure out that the suit isn’t good for Peter and Peter will start acting differently. Watch what I tell you. It’s gonna be how doc oc started acting when he got the extra arms. And Miles is gonna free Peter from the symbiote and it’s gonna attach to Eddie brock
Black suit is very bad
Interface looks like some mobil game ad in YouTube
😰Pete is definitely not himself… more… aggressive. Then again, Symbiote lol.
It’s…So BEAUTIFUL 😭😭😭😭
Notice how at 11:49 the eyes go from wrinkly to more sharp and jagged.
This... Is... Beautiful 🥲🖤
“They fly now?”-Finn
Never wanted that to end 🥹
there is a lot about this trailer the worries me the ui seems a bit to overbearing and the gliding, oof, i hope there some kind of limit to it or else ir completely trivializes swinging and for a spider man game that’s very not good, but in insomniac we trust lol.
I got literal chills seeing Kraven’s henchmen show him the data of New York City and the faces of Black Cat, Spider-Man, Miles, Taskmaster and etc, this game looks great and the gameplay looks amazing, I cannot wait.
It’s a shame that ps4 users won’t get to play this!😢
Can't wait for eddie brock
This looks fire 😭
Ganke being The Nerd in the Chair!
_KAH-BOOM!_ *PlayStation* does it again!
Kraven the hunter
Insomniac never disappoints
They added the slingshot swing ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh this whole video it better than she hulk whole series
This reminds me Spiderman 3 PC game and it makes me smile.  No it was not a good game, it has many glitches and many bad things but i have memories with that game.  And the black suit, Kraken and hunting Lizard part definitely came from that game imo.  I fuckin loved the atmosphere of 3rd game and will like this one as it seems.
This games graphics look insane!!🔥🔥🔥
The venom suit looks so good.
The gameplay looks amazing, peter being taken over by the symbiont is represented so well in the voice acting, gameplay and body language, I love how he just throws the citizen after saving him and just snatches the tracler away from miles.
Can’t wait to play as Miles to defeat Peter then defeat Kraven once the symbiote attaches to him.  👀
This games graphics look insane!!🔥🔥🔥
Spider-Man is one of my favorite games of all time and I can't wait for this. With that said, I'm worried about a few things. Really hoping Mysterio and Sandman don't get left out yet again; they are two of my favorite Spidey villains. And I'm really hoping the Pete/Miles gameplay isn't 50/50. I like Miles but I love Pete and would much rather play the majority of the game as him. Super glad this is only single player though!
This was so awesome to see. I couldn't control myself.
this is the first time in my life a video game trailer made me squeal like a fan girl and I absolutely love it, so glad nobody is home right now.
first one was one of my favorite games, can’t wait for this one!!
SHOCKERRRRR!! I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
Ждём на пк
The only thing that I don't like is the way the symbiote looks. It looks like armor mixed with the symbiote rather than the symbiote itself.
See you guys in 5 years when this comes to PC
He got away from "us"
It’s going to be crazy seeing miles vs Peter. Miles trying to save Peter from the black suit
1:28: wraith!!!!!!!!!
I don’t like an Evil Peter Parker. Didn’t like it in Spider-Man 3. Miles is growing on me. Just don’t put one down to life one up.
i cant stop thinking of matpat whenever spiderman talks in the bully maguire esque tone
The Symbiote looks so sick! I'm definitely souled on buying the game now. Again the wait was so worth it. 💯🔥 Lowkey gave me Web Of Shadows vibes.
I’m amazed I can’t wait to get my hands on this game 😮
This looks Amazing! Im looking forward to it!
This is actually a step up. Its not just a reskin of the same game for 80 bucks like every other series game release?
As a former Xbox One player, please hop on the PS bandwagon my brothers
Yes
We can see that isominac listened to the fans like what perks they wanna see for both of spider-men for example we finally got back the slingshot from amazing spiderman 2 I cannot wait for people to play this game bc its just a masterpiece.
that is so epic bruuuh
Omg this looks awesome!
heeelelelelelelellll nahhhh
The graphics, the new mechanics, and Venom...  This is looking like a rare Sony w.
90% Cutscenes, dialogues, scripted events and 10% actual realtime gameplay.  I can't wait to not play this game because it will not let me.
beautiful beyond compare
Goty for sure
Yuri Lowenthal killed it you can feel the anger in his voice
Given the comic run of Peter’s Spider-Man, an angry Spider is what I need right now.
I’m getting mixed with nostalgia from this game :)
“So do I” 🥵 11:45
parece de gelatina
10/10
Please make it available for ps4
When is it coming to pc?
Seems at this point that the symbiotes influence doesnt show as heavily when hes not in combat. Dont get me wrong Its noticeable but considering that someones life is at stake it could be easily dismissed by friends and family. This is likely gonna let the thing's influence increase over time.
Venom effect on pete
2:42 Bro what did he do to you Peter? Also I feel bad for all the X-Box players(including myself) for not being able to play this……glorious game in fall.
YEESSSSSS WHAT WE BEEN WAITING FOR
looks amazing
This…. Is….. AWESOME!!
Only on PlayStation 5 '-'
I saw Deadpool, I saw Deadpool, I saw Deadpool🥵🥵
YOOOOO
I can't wait to pete become bullyMaguire 🤣
It’s the little things w Peter’s behavior that sells it. The way he grabs that tracker from Miles (11:43) is something he would never do
4:39 now that’s cold. Creating a line of web to walk on
I bought a PS5 specifically for this game
Se viene, se viene el gran Juego de Spiderman! Estoy terminando el Miles Morales y esto me da un hype que muero!
FUCKIN FINALLY THIS LOOKS SO DOPE
This game is so beautiful. It's enough to make a grown man cry.
Is this only a ps5 exclusive? No ps4??
*AMAZING*
Looks phenomenal  My only worry is the HUD, feels like way to much stuff to keep track on
If this is PS5 exclusive I’m gonna be pissed
the sheer excitement i have is great.
"Are you sure? He's got big teeth." "So do I."  Oh god, I can't wait! Edgy Peter is just so cool!
I like how at the end the "together" in the "be greater together" at the end is taken over by the symbiote, then shocked away by Mile's Venom Blast. Shows how Venom will drive a wedge between Miles and Peter and it's gonna be Miles trying to keep that from happening
I love the way lizard looks even though we only got snip it’s of him. Looks more croc looking which is awesome. Like how spider-man sounds to the aggressiveness cause the Symbiot is bonded with him. When he finally realizes he needs to get rid of it then it should make venom’s appearance more meaningful. Hope there’s more killing from venom and kraven. Will really show spiderman and miles are hero’s that don’t kill. Very impressed right now.
hell yea
Does anyone think we’ll be able to switch over to venom down the storyline ?
Symbiote Spiderman boutta scream NARUTOOOO if he gets more angry
… guess I’ll have to get a PS5 now
Venom powers 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
my bet is that theres gonna be a miles vs symbiote suit spiderman boss fight that takes place at a bell tower, you weaken him with sounds from the bells then you attack him with the fight ending with peter ripping the symbiote suit spiderman 3 style  two meaning to "be greater together" together fighting with miles together with the venom symbiote
The same game, with other outfit, other combos, other HUD, the same graphics, the same map(?) with some new places, a DLC story a little bit bigger with TWO spiders. WOW. the only thing that surprises me is the symbionte now playable with peter.
Insane Insane Insane Insane Insane Insane… A’ight, A’ight calm down you are 30 now
The hunter himself
So freaking good!!! Insomniac is CRAZY
Miles has wings 😢
Ahhhhh good ole symbiote doing what it does best to Peter turning him to be more aggressive and stubborn, think it might put Miles and Peters friendship on the rocks can’t wait!
The only gripe, only absolute gripe I have that has absolutely ZERO effect on the game is the HUD. If anyone actually and deliberately thinks that the UI being what it is is in any way going to affect the quality of the game, their opinion is invalid. Even I don't like it. It's not going to ruin the game at all. This game still looks amazing.
Is the guy at the start kraven or craven IDK how to spell it
Cannot wait for this game to release remember buying the first one as soon as it released and the amazing me memories I had with it and this should top it even better entire trailer was pure hype
Guys, we won. This looks absolutely amazing, and I cannot wait to play this game later this year
Can’t wait for the 10 fps pc port
They made Lizard look like a freaking Godzilla 😂 I love it ❤ can't wait for Emo parker aka Bully Maguire
Edit: when Pete says "so do i" look closesly at his eye shape it literally changes a bit towards venom eyes   Just for 12 mins I'm hyped and scared and the foreshadowing of what's to come is amazing the Choreography and Soundtrack is already ULTIMATELY AMAZING
lesss gooooo
"We don't have much time. Move." venom Spidey not joking
This is where I leave my mark
miles is so much cooler than peter woah
See y’all after I beat the game
Seen it 3 times now, haven't webbed myself this much since 2018, the combat looks phenomenal with the added symbiote abilities, Peter's aggression makes for interesting storytelling and the added traversal and stealth options are handy, hype train baby🎉🎉
Dude this is so hype
🗣️Finally…..PICTURES OF SPIDER-MAN!!
People are impressed by anything nowadays honestly. Thats why we'll never get anything truly remarkable. Imagine being a villain in some big notorious group terrorizing NYC Home of Spiderman, but still failing to look up. Dumb.
It’s so beautiful 😭
Spiderman is such a great franchise! Hope they will not fok it up by trying to innovate the future games, to the point of it being unrecognizable! Just keep the core gameplay, tell good stories and add in tons of details!😊
11:37 “He got away from us” PETER WAS TALKING TO THE SYMBIOTE NOT MILES THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE 🔥!
💯💯💯🍿🍿🍿
Yeahhhh,they are going to adapt the Alien suit saga,Awesome
this is beautiful
Miles and Peter are def gonna throw hands
how am i more hyped for the sequel
Too much Miles….🫠 I hope that we won’t be forced to play as Miles for 80% of the game… if I’m playing as Peter less that 60% then I’m buying this on a huge sale 🤷🏼‍♂️
Peter and Miles are 100% gonna fight at some point and it’s gonna be INSANE
Leaving this comment here for when Spider-Man 3 gets announced
only ps5? y not ps4 plaz release it on ps4 or els ima smeer crap on my walls
The whole Kraven and Lizard thing is like taken from the spiderman 3 game from the ps2 era.
Amazingly similar to the remaster Web of Shadows.
YESSS YESSSS YES YES YES YES YES 😭
Well… anyone remember about wolverine’s game ?
This will easily be one of the best PS5 games ever!! Well done Insomniac for getting Spider-Man right and creating great stories!
This might be extreme speculation, but seeing how at the end title the symbiote seems to be pushed back by Miles' lighting, and how his spider was at the research lab where Harry was, I'm beginning to think that Miles might be able to free pete from the symbiote, or even Harry from Venom.
That’s amazing never before in any show, movie or animated series has Peter morphed like that in the Symboite suit. It just goes to show you guys at Insomniac do your diehard research in the comics instead of relying on outside medias that do a half assed job. Now I wanna see if Spider Gwen will show up in this game or a later game.
Okay ima get a ps5 now this game looks sick I love spider man
Black suit AND Kraven the Hunter??? This is gonna be amazing
Peter's got the Symbiote in him now. Not good because one step foward for Venom to appear
I don't think "5 more minutes, Mom." is gonna be enough.
2 spideys with venom powers and at the end one "beats" the other???
OMG, Yuri has finally become Wraith!
Fingers crossed for a quick pc release
3:52 Spiderman : Arkham city
I see symbiote and all I want to play is a game with king of void Knull. But I guess when it will come I'll be too old lol.
Kraven is looking devious 😈
Graphics (especially the character models) look a bit last gen hopefully it looks more polished on release
When Peter said its spider time, I felt that
I love the attention to detail on 11:32 where Miles noticed the subtle change in Peter's personality after he dropped the civilian on the ground after saving him
10/10
MAN I LOVE BEING A GAMER 🔥🤦🏾‍♂️🙌🏿
Lmfao Peter being edgy man. Can’t wait for this game though!
Spiderman games are literally the best down superhero games
They had no right to go this hard on the gameplay reveal. Buying this game day one.
Day one automatically
imagine a boss fight where u play as miles and have to take down a symbiote ridden peter
Kraven and taskmaster 1v1 will go crazy
GLIDING GLIDING GLIDING GLIDING WEOOEOWOE
Now THIS is how you promoted a spider-man game, this looks absolutely DOPE! Can't wait!!! So exciting!!! 🔥
WEGOING ON SUM GANG SHII FR FR FR FR FR FR FR FR FR FR FR
A Spider-Suit with functional under arm wings is a surprise, especially since Peter never got the arm webs to work originally in-universe. Guess he just needed better tech.
oml this shii is FIRE BRUH
Ok I hope Peter keeps the suit kinda like in web of shadows or it’d be a waste but that be greater together with miles’ venom power removing the symbiote from it may be suggesting otherwise
I don’t think I’m gonna like this one
I'm almost certain they gonna try and make miles look stronger than Peter by making him defeat Peter with the symbiote on him as a boss fight
Peter just throws that civilian down after saving him on the pier, and miles kinda give him a look like “dude wtf?” Attention to detail is nuts.
I'm so glad the first guy wasn't Kraven.
Web of Shadows but better.
We deserve a aunt may prequel open world game
4:20 is hilarious cause why tf would they not notice that lmao
11:30 I like this scene right here. Look at Miles' expression, he was like genuinely surprised Peter threw the innocent bystander so aggressively 😲
They nailed the combat
WOOOOOOOO
Really love the mish mash of characters that were selected. On his own Kraven is the goofiest dood, but with a Symbiote and big Lizard in the mix, he becomes an interesting third medling faction. Smart. Really appreciate the new animations. But i'm sad to say it's nothing mind boggling so far. I can say the stage is set for pretty good potential scenarios and the spirit of the comics and the movies is represented flawlessly, so I can't ask anything more.
Its looks like a good game but im pissed that its not coming to PS4
Let’s go!🔥🔥🔥🕷
"He's got big teeth" "So do I"  Its not often a video game gives me chills
Why does the Symbiote make him sound like he needs the potty?  Is that why the suit looks like poopy?
Game looks so much better
This is cinema.  -Martin Scorsese
CRAZY THEORY BUT WHAT IF WE GET TO FIGHT SYMBIOTE PETER 😮😮
Looks like a PS4 game. Disappointed.
Give me pre order button NOW
This is just beautiful 😭😭😭
I love everything but... The angry Yuri voice i so edgy... The rest is all perfect
This is a game people will buy a Ps5 just to play.
Finally after all these years…
Has it been confirmed how much older miles is in this game compared to the last one
I am FREAKING THE FRICK OUT RIGHT NOW!!!!
can't wait to buy yet another console for one game.
2023 Game of the Year 🔥
11:32 sheeesh Pete, should've thrown a web at him too as an extra..
Nice
I really need a ps5…
I love how Symbiote Pete just tosses a guy after rescuing instead of making him land on web 😂
Looks awesome, my only complain, is seeing all the time the L1-R1 moves at the bottom of the screen while playing.
With both Kraven and Venom in this, looks like we'll be playing "Kraven's Last Hunt" comic lol, absolutely awesome
Jameson will have a field day with Black Suit Spidey.
4:59 I love that chidori
Oh man I can’t wait for this game now I’m loving everything from it. Kraven looks like a beast
i played the first spider man love it  i played spider man miles morales love it  i just watched marvel spider man 2 gameplay ABSOLUTELY LOVING IT I CAN  WAIT TO PLAY THE GAME 😀  🥰😍💖👍👍👏
I love it all
I’m calling it now there is going to be a miles Vs Peter boss fight.
GET BACK HERE KRAVEN! KRAAAAAVEEEEN
looks worth the 4 years
Ps3 graphics
Too bad sony is not allowed to touch other marvel characters outside of Spiderman's circle. Its wierd you don't see other well known heroes in New York other than spider men and co
shut up and take my money
Ill remember the puddles
It look SOOOO GOOOOOD!!!!!!!! 🕸🤩
THEY GOT GLIDING?! 😤😤😤😤😤
Alright alright, I’ll play it, geez!
Game looks too scripted not much freedom in gameplay is why I think this game won’t be game of the year, just a 10-15 hour experience that’s going to be $70. People are tired of being ripped off by movie games.
Rip ps4 😭
I was here!
This feels like the Arkham City of this series.  Bigger map, more movement and traversal options, and all around more varied combat. I hope this game makes the first game feel like baby’s first Spider-Man game.
I’ll say it and you can judge me:  I’m hard as a rock right now. 🤣🤣🤣🤣☠️😂☠️
Peter: IT'S MINE   Miles: You Sure Man IT GOT BIG TEETH 😨   Peter: SO DO I 😈     LET'S GO VENOM VS LIZARD 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love everything. Besides the black suit. It looks weird.
I really really want this game when it comes out but it’s only coming on ps5 and I have a ps4 it’s not coming on ps4s 😢😢
please, please, PLEASE TELL ME ITS GONNA ALSO BE ON PC ON RELEASE
SLINGSHOT SLINGSHOT SLINGSHOT SLINGHOT WEOWOWOOEOWWO
Here before 1 million views
This game is gonna be gold.
Release date tho 😢
It took over a year for a trailer but It was 100% worth it for this.
I don't know why no one says it, but the fact that you can actually go to Queens is 🔥🔥🔥
I see the lizard and wraith in here now
This is crazy
Oh boy, Bully Maquire is gonna make a swift return in this game
I met Yuri Lowenthal at a convention recently, and we got into a whole conversation about the game.  He said it looked good, and boy was he right.  Just sucks that I don’t have a PS5 to play it on since those things are impossible to get.
LOOKS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Holy crap this looks so sick 😭😭
Que coisa maravilhosa
Funny how Pete throws the civilian at the end after he had just rescued them…
Incredible game!!
Let's goooooo
Leave Peter and Mary Jane’s romance alone and keep them together we had enough of their fallout with the recent comics pray to god that they don’t introduce “Paul”!🤦🏾
OMG it looks amazing I so hype for Spider-Man 2
Perfect 🥰 💞
I hate that asian guy, he always questioning about the original spiderman, he always doubt about him. he just annoying as the fat Asian guy in mcu, i hope they die
at last
hopefully this is ps5 not pc
LETS GO!!
This is way better than web of shadows
Black cat and prowler die, come back to this comment in like a year when they actually release the game
So, Henry Cavil is Kraven? Haha
Moon knight
be greater be yourself be VENOM
That symbiote combat is insane!
Really! (Very awesome)
this gameplay was insanely awesome I’m so hyped I can’t wait for Spider-Man 2 to come out it’s going to be incredible let’s gooooo
il be honest i was a little worried that the guy at the beginning was kraven and was so glad when we saw the real him
Peter is a menace bro
Yuri has to get his 90s Symbiote Spidey moment. "SHOCKEEEERRRRR!"
Bully McGuire!!!!
i was here
Hear Peter becoming more aggressive due to the symbiote is terrifying. Can't wait for this to come out!!!
as long as there is no woke characters, ill play it.
I like how it’s more nature in this game I’m so hyped
Ngl frustrated spiderman sounds like angry MatPat
Those repeated wall kicks from pete were straight brutal
I'm so FUCKIN READDDYYYY!!! I'M GETTING THIS AS SOON AS ITS DROPS
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man this looks so incredible! I absolutely adore the symbiote gameplay. I know insomniac will kill it
THIS LOOKS FANTASTIC
So Harry is sick according to gameplay and he was the previous host of symbiote. So does that mean Pete is going to get sick as well? I have a bad feeling about this.
This gonna slap 🥶
Miles is definitely going to have to fight Peter and I can’t wait for that boss fight
CRAZYYYY
The lizard isnt wearing a labcoat 0/10
The characters in the map, returning characters? Then this mean that probably the story is trying to cure Harry while keeping Peter's friends and enemies safe from Kraven.   It's hunting season and Peter with Miles will have to be the hunter hunts the hunted
Is this multiplayer I want to play with my cousin
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO🔥
BAKUGO?!
I can already tell that they will add a boss fight with peter as miles is trying to get the symbiote off of peter and I am ready for it!
Looks pretty meh to be honest
Looks like Sasuke is coming out of Peter this time around!
Couple things,  First off, I nearly thought that dude at the beginning was Kraven until he actually showed up. (KRAVEN LOOKS BADASS BTW!)  The symbiote! HOLY CRAP! IT'S PERFECT! The combat for it is just amazing!  Switching to Miles and finding out we can now glide in this game!  Stealth gets even better! The web line is back! We can do double perch takedowns! And Miles new abilities allow him far great range!  THE LIZARD! MY GOD HE IS HUGE!  Web Swinging feels improved! Looks way faster than it did before.  I can't wait for this game!
3:05 that pull looks so weak, maybe they can polish that
I’m sensing a Hobgoblin story with Ganke in this game
is the map twice the size?
Stranger Things Spider-Man is very cool
3:10 that attack shows how much Peter normally does hold back
about time (i’ve waited so long; ive seen the same teasers for months)
Sasuke is going crazy
I am actually scared of Peter and I love it! This is probably going to be one of the best Symbiote arcs ever created between the comics, cartoons, movies, and games! Just this dynamic alone I am almost certain we are going to get a Miles vs. Peter boss fight!!!
Peter be tossing civilians around like crazy in this preview
Spider-Man 2 is going to be amazing
I can't wait to live out my Bully Maguire fantasy.
Peters gonna be a boss fight lmao
Sasuke as spiderman brought the Webs Of Shadows all back to me.
دييييييييييييم
Bro that ending got me thinking, is there gonna be a fight between miles and Peter? 2:22 - 2:32 Pete accepted to being called a beast 3:11 broke this man’s rib cage like Daymn 😬😆 6:45 crashed through the ceiling looking menacing 10:48 got mad at miles and genki  10:59 - 11:02  the way he said “FINE 😡” with an attitude  11:33 threw a civilian  11:54 and venom/ the mask reacted when he said “so do I 😈” Bruh I can’t wait for this game I was geeking out when they showed miles gameplay.
Peter Parker sounds like Bakugo
who else is sensing a Miles vs Peter story happening here? and at the end when it says together it has the symbols and electricity possibly hinting at Miles bio venom to combat the symbiote?
From start to finish this looked really good!!
Shut up and take my money!😂
I want it but no PS5.
Cool gameplay and some interesting hints about the overall plot, but I'm definitely worried about one detail; if Peter can do all that with the black suit, what's going to happen if/when he has to face Venom?
🥱🥱🥱🥱😴😴😴😴
This was way better than any MCU Spider-Man movie
LETS GOOOOOOOO AS A PERSON WHOS BEEN WAITING AFTER PLAYING AND GETTING 100% ON MILES MORALES AND THE 1ST ONE THIS IS SICK AS HELL IM SO HYPEDDDDDDDDD MILES BLUE VENOM LOOKS SO FIRE AND THE SYMBIOTE OH MY GOD ITS SO FRICKING COOL
Like you can see the Symbiote alive moving as he talks…
This looks like a hot mess, i'm sticking to the ps2 game
This looks insane can’t wait 🥹🔥
Not gonna lie, they f***ing nailed this one!!
Hype
Sony using destiny 2 music for all their new games
when has tasting random blood on a leaf in the middle of a jungle been the norm for films?
Instant classic
Sound effects go crazy
We will remember this game as well as the web of shadows❤
Did Miles just haduken his venom strike???
I had higher expectations for the graphics. I was expecting rift apart level graphics. A bigger world and character switching is cool but i expected better and would honestly have picked up a ps5 just for this game if the graphics were on par with rift apart
I had  to stop at only watching 3 minutes of this video it was SO AWESOME I don't want to be spoiled anymore than I already am. I was sold on this game even before knowing pretty much nothing but after what I saw, now my excitement is threw the room!
Yes!!!
GAME OF THE YEAR INCOMING🔥🔥🔥
Wow
Kraven finally getting the spotlight he fuckin deserve....
Straight banger, trailer once again
Peter is freaking PISSED, I’m so excited for this game 😭
I Was Here! 324,489 views
Every thing is changed like naver before now I understand why people being mad to see showcase
GREAT
11:54 If you take a close look, the eyes emote an aggressive stare that with foreshadow the coming of Venom further into the games story. I love little details like this.
OMG! Can't wait for this now! Hope it's a longer story! I believe the textures can be improved a bit
prototype feels
Holy crap.  I need a ps5.
NO FUCKINH WAY
Capolavoro 😍❤️🔝
Wait, so the game is gonna *make* us play as the other Spider-Man? Ew. I'd rather it be an option, so I can spend as little time playing as Miles as possible.
I hope Eddie Brok is venom and not Harry. But the game is looking sick 🔥💪🏽
Unleash the Spider Menace - J.J.J.
I'm in...
Oh my GOD It's much perfect i thought 😂😂
Dude, this looks ugly.
Did they put taskmaster in the game i see a skull mask and the hoodie there no way thry put taskmaster in this
This looks sickkkkkk lol
I hope the gameplay is at least longer than Miles Morales..sigh
There better be a Peter boss...
So when is this getting released for PS2? I’m tired of missing out on great games😔
😆😆😆😆
The black suit is very beautiful
Why doesn’t the graphics look any better?
I Need a ps5 like... Really Bad
NO FKCKING WAY
Graphics looks same like The first game...
YESS BLACK SUIT SPIDEY🕷️🕷️
essa skin do venom tá mt feia
There are 2 things I would very much love from this game.  1: Emo Peter dance.  2: Another chase with Shocker and Peter yells at him to get back here.
To future generations watching this for nostalgia, i was here.
Bruh…
Anyone else a tad.. disappointed? Looks good, not gonna lie but still looks like a ps4 game. More of a derivative sequel than I was expecting. Hopefully they have multiple maps. I don't wanna do new york for a 3rd time
10 years later people will come back to this trailer because this was peak spiderman games !!
This looks so AMAZING
They must have been working on this for years it looks perfect
Peter Uchiha confirmed!!!! Whew I was looking forward to that Sasuke voice for Symbiote Spider-Man!
5:00 buddy did a kamehameha 💀
The new Prey  looks amazing
please tell me this will launch on pc too
This looks amazing
Love the gameplay just wish we got more Peter in the symbiote suit than Miles, game still looks amazing cant wait to play it!!!!
I seriously can't believe that they opened up the rest of New York. Looking forward to exploring Brooklyn, Queens, and it looks like the Bronx you might be able to explore a little bit too 👍
The tag line would be harder if it was “beware”
Symbiote combat is pretty cool, wish it were a little more like web of shadows but I ain't going be picky, it looks awesome
No one talking a warith aka yuri when kravin looks at the map of ny
In all the spiderman games, movies or shows where the symbiote is present, none showed Peter using it like in this game. Absolutely phenomenal. The suit is also spot on. The new mechanics are amazing. I absolutely cannot wait for this game. The first game was amazing, Miles Morales made me cry how good it was, but this is different... Game of the year vibes 💪
Spiderman turning into sasuke
I'm calling it now Peter is gonna go too far in the story and him and Miles are gonna throw fisticuffs 🗣️
Cool cutscene, but where was the gameplay reveal?
I feel like they shouldn't have showed the symbiote suit and should've been kept a secret but aside from that. Perfect trailer.
Seems like miles will eventually fight Peter. Can’t wait for this.
Looks absolutely peak
I had higher hopes for the animation
can someone explain, theres spider man 1, then miles game, are they separate games or is the miles part an expansion? I want to play catch up so i can play this game.
OMG I HAVE TO PLAY THIS
Oh man, please be available to ps4
I didn't like how the symbiote suit looks like. I think it could have been better. There is still time to change it though. But the rest looks amazing.
ANT MAN
Se está volviendo salvaje...
Lets go!!
“He’s never like that.” Son, let me teach you a little something about Bully Lowenthal
Played both games on PC and really want to buy a PS5 just for this game. Clearly the game still needs the finishing touches but my god the story definitely leveled up beautifully. I was concerned about the sequel when we had sinister six in the very first game but insomniac did it.
QUEENS
G0VN0
Slk o venom aki no Brasil nois ama esse cara
I sense web of shadows vibes.
Take my money!  This game is going to be 🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!!
Felicia Hardy AKA Black Cat was teased in the beginning so she better appear in this game. Side Note: Hopefully they give a choice to be with Felicia like in Web of Shadows because let’s be honest everyone wants that. I hope they didn’t do any major changes to her physical appearance if you know what I mean.😏
Careful Peter, your inner Sasuke is showing
Some of the attacks remind me of the amazing Spider-Man 2 like the perch takedown and ultimate Spider-Man with being able to explore two patty’s of new york
The subtle details about Peter are just unnerving. The more aggressive attitude, the more violent attacks, and at the end where he just tossed the civilian on the ground were all very nice touches.
The wing suit, count me in
This game already had me excited! But I don't think any of us were expecting something this great wow!
This game looks great🥹👍
This looks incredibly already. Can’t wait.
Bro this looks better than IRL
WEB OF SHADOWS 2
Anyone else noticed Wraith was listed as one of the "enhanced" in Kraven's list?
Cant wait to see some Bully Maguire in the game
Still hoping for 2 player multiplayer compatibility
Mf sounds like MatPat
So excited
This was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen, Yuri sounds just like sasuke😭
Honestly, everything except the black suit looks fire 🔥
🤯🔥🔥🔥 finally the game looks way better than the first i'm fully hyped
Bro Miles Dunked that man after getting Dunked by 2099
peak
Finally a Spider-Man game with queens in it.
i wonder if youtube will be around in 20 years.
no me termina de convencer el traje negro
I almost fell off of my treadmill while watching this. Incredible. Can’t wait for this to come out.
69/10
How come the graphics looks worse than the first Spiderman? Even the water graphics in the lake chase scene was so bad.....
1:28 oh….dear….god! She really did it. Few things shock me in my life but Yuri’s descent into bloody justice made my blood run cold. I thought she was an original character created specifically for the games. Am I really that out of touch? I am one of the few millennials to remember what marvel was like in the old days. Sometimes I find myself pining for the old days. It pains me when one of the hero’s dearest comrades descends into madness. It’s like Obi-Wan Kenobi fighting Anakin Skywalker all over again.
So many comments from bots. Sony what are you?!
peter being so much angrier and not quipping is actually so cool, every time he talks it sounds like he's trying to not burst a blood vessel lmao
OMG!!!! Kraven, the Lizard, Spider-Man Symbiote, and of course Venom!!! And lets not forget to talk about the smooth duality gameplay with Miles and Peter, also the new techniques and abilities, Mind blowing!! Oh... and wait... last but not least, the cherry's cake, the Green Globin for sure is going to be the main villain, I'll bet my house
Will the game feature a set of pizza delivery side missions in the newly playable Queens? This may or may not affect my desire to purchase it
Bro this was scary to watch dude I can’t wait to play this game
😊
Yo hello from everyone that watched this in 2027
Oh my..... I'm so excited. The first game was great, I can't wait to see what they do this time around.
Perfect.
I love how many mods and community suggestions it implemented from the first game and then some. Jaw on the floor at the glide reveal.
Is it just me or does this feel like a phone game
Hi😊
i came when i saw this
Leaving my comment here for after I play the game hope future me enjoys it
I was honestly hoping for more traversal and movement abilities so I'm really happy that they finally added the web-wings
Holy crap
Goty
Really cool and they made kraven look really good. Venom looks amazing to! =)
Mid villain
That lizard is almost a baby Godzilla. Taking rounds and everything.
I love how advanced Miles Morales is in this game.
I’m so excited bro. It’s gonna be amazing. The updates to combat, traversal, flow, and gameplay look so good. I love both Spider-Man ps4 and miles morales so much and can’t wait to play what insomniac is cookin up next.
Early
Why should I get a Playstation 5 when I already have a Playstation 4 Sony: we got Spider-Man 2 TAKE ALL MY MONEY! 💰
Hell yes… Kraven the Hunter😎
Totk is most likely better but it's gonna be a nice 2nd or 3rd place. I wouldn't even be surprised if they pushed it to early next year. It might have a chance for next year's GOTY award.
Been waiting for another Spider-Man 2 video game update since the 1st one & they didn't disappoint
Venom's attacks are so vicious and we're all here for it!!!!!
Is it me or I'm hearing Sasuke!!! 🤣🤣🤣
I love Yuri's take on the Symbiote Peter voice quips. It gets "GET BACK HERE, SHOCKER!" on another new level 🤣
Why does the Lizard look like Godzilla?😂
Awesome, I cannot wait. Insomniac is also now my dream company to make a Spider-Man-like video game for TMNT. I can already see a perfect Leatherhead.
But is it coming to pc?
Yuri Lowenthal really putting his Sasuke voice to use lmao
Man, the switch feature is completely a new territory for me to get used to. Otherwise, OMG Pre-order immediately .
I want to go to there.
Assassins creed mirage
Usually I don't watch game trailers and stopped gaming, only HALO theae days, but my ohh my...FIRST ASSASSIN'S CREED MIRAGE, then THIS. Its just a bomb. A freaking time bomb. Absolutely flawless and gorgeous. Reminds me of Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2 pc days. ❤
How is a sequel worse graphics than the first game? Best graphics in the video was probably when the chase scene happened which was also clearly the worst gameplay part of the video. Some QTE, some cinematic action scenes and a bunch of web slinging. Riveting stuff.
This is amazing 🤩
Insomniac’s SpiderVerse is going down in the history books as one of the greatest iterations of not only Spidey, but a super hero In general.
See you on pc in 4 years
I have already watch it 4 times its a MASTERPIECE
this game looks awesome, although I am a little worried about the story, probably I'm wrong, but the lizard, the black suit saga, venom, and kraven, are all stories that could fill a single game, so hopefully they're not putting more than they can handle
Black suit spider= mean peter.
'Be Greater, Together' is a PERFECT tagline! Peter and Miles are greater heroes together, but Peter and the symbiote together is just as alluring.
Classic New York in Marvel where private army could do whatever they want while authorities are completely useless
I can already tell this will be a game of the year contender
same game
Guys let's be honest that symbiote suit is not what we've been waiting for... 💀💔
I'm so jealous of everyone with a PS5, this game looks brilliant!!
I love the change of voice when the symbiote is in control. Only thing i wished was to see a little bit of Venom.
i’m in awe
Cant wait to be black
Пересматриваю ролик уже 3 раз, инсомниак просто лучшие, игра в этот раз реально заслуживает занять первое место геймэвордс
Cool
« Kraven wants an hunt…I’ll give him one he’ll never forget. »   Bro this man is going to kill someone for sure
love this spider-man 3 the game remake!
can’t wait for the pc port in like 2 or 5 years
Everyones talking about wos but I see a little spiderman 3 influence in there too, especially with how it moves in some cases, it's like a blend of the raimi and venomverse symbiote, also notice how peter COMES OUT of mays celler (I'm assuming it looks just like Mays house in usm) he's in his red suit then puts on the black. Suit switching basically confirmed?
Cool but where's wolverine
So you just replace the White Web with black goo and present it as a “new dynamic symbiote combat system”.  You think the fans are that dumb? 😂😂😂
This Spidey universe might be on par with Spectacular, depends on if Mary Jane gets hotter
Bro he’s killing people
WHAT DA HALLL OH MA GAWDDD NO WAAAY
My god this game is gonna be so good I mean just look how Peter kinda throws that guy he saves and mules notices SOO HYPED
Marvel really droppin one of the best gameplay trailers EVER
AMAZING <3
Ima buy ps5
Have been waiting for this duo forever! The game is bigger than I imagined. Underestimated how intense the hype was. The boss fights will be legendary. Can’t wait to play it 💯😈 5-24-23
This is my Everyrhing
I really like the new abilities, and the fact that you can change through Miles and Peter, it's amazing
hypee
I bought an Xbox series X just to play this masterpiece... Cant wait 🔥❤️
Fixing to experience the best PlayStation Exclusive game of all time
It's looking like it. Miles will be the one to tear the Venom symbiote off from Peter and kill it.
a bit dissapointing, probably worth getting when it goes on sale though
Hopefully it ends up having good preorder bonuses because its one of the very few games i’d be willing to preorder.
I hear La'gaan
WE’RE SO BACK
Websites are gonna break when the pre-orders are up!
Sling shot from tasm!!!! Games look so good
FINALLYYYYY
just taking everything great about the first two and adding and improving! This looks great. So excited for the new mechanics, dynamic between Peter turning dark while Miles watches, getting to see Kraven, and lizard looks dope. And they didnt even show Venom gameplay yet! Only complaint is that lizard looks a little too much like Arkham Killer Croc, but that design is so cool and Lizard looks different enough that I dont mind. Really like the idea of him shedding his skin and actually getting bigger. This looks so dope.
I was here
I really wish this were coming out on pc at launch. I don't want to have to buy a ps5 for one game.
lizard, kraven, kingpin, electro, doctor ocatvius, taskmaster, kingpin, venom, rhino, black cat, prowler and the other one is anonym you cant figure out who it is  edit:green goblin i think
The Hype Is Real 💯
Yoooo fall 😫😭😭😭😭😭
I think big map
The symbiote suit is crazy
has New York always looked so... alive?
Good Spider-Man 2 gameplay trailer
the story line is gonna be absolutely insane 😮‍💨😮‍💨 insomniac does not disappoint 🔥🔥🔥
I'M HYPED FOR THIS!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
At 1:28 you can see Wraith, who will be Yuri.
11:46 Why are these heros in video games dropping the coldest lines 🥶🥶🥶
The spider flaps! They added the spider flaps!!
Same As 2 Games Bfore But With More Content, Features & Improvements! Amazing Job!
This is what the game awards needed
YES
Lizard being a clear reference to Godzilla 98 is pretty sick.
This is going to be epic
Im having a vision . Miles decides to call oug peter on his behavoir and it lesds to a fight , but you are not playing as peter , you are playing as miles .
Spider-Man wearing the black suit is giving me Web of Shadows vibes!!!! This is awesome!!!
The same game 3 times in a row
The hud layout sucks it should always be in the corner of the screen not halfway. Looks terrible just sitting randomly in the middle of the screen
Milles will fight with Peter in final battle, when Peter turns into Venom, and becomes normal after battle because power of friendship/Peter and Miles will fight with Osborn who becomes Venom.
Gotta admit Kraven’s design looks so badass.  Edit: 1:28 WRAITH!!!! Yes! Thank god they didn’t forget about what happened to Yuri in the dlc, her boss fight is going to be sad and heartbreaking for Pete.
I really hope they've made improvements to the swinging they aren't showing
So awsome
Could it be that the suit changes as the game progresses? The more angry Peter is, the suit turns more like Venom
😲😳
It’ll be even more awesome once this hits PC
I just don have words to write what i fell after seeing this so this is my comment for now. Wow, just wow. for now
Does anybody think this game will be co op?
Estou aqui para lembrar da primeira vez que vi a gameplay desse jogo maravilhoso ⚡🕷️
Micheal and franklin
Excellent game play dropped right before the hype train for the spiderverse starts hitting its peak . Smart marketing.
Anyone else's getting a Bad Parker vibes?
I don’t have a PlayStation so can’t wait for it to launch on pc
I really hope the Chameleon will show up, especially since him and Kraven are half-brothers. It could be fun having to track him down after he runs off from a crime scene and camouflages himself as a random citizen.
What's so spider man use venom power??
Love the look of the Symbiote suit and how angry it made peters voice! And the switch to Miles and him with a wing suit is awesome! This is gonna be a great game
Oh my god, they're giving us so much of what we asked for, this is crazy
Sasukegoing crazy
This makes me feel like why i have pc and no ps5.. How many eternals we will have to wait to play this on pc.. I'm So hyped and so sad at a time😑
every single on of these new mechanics are on spiderman pc right now lol there is nothing new swing speed gliding switching characters new fight styles all in spiderman on pc right now hahaha
Thank you so much for adding the lizard to the game! I really hope Mysterio is in the game also!
First ttankiechi 4 now spider man 2 bro this is gonna be legendary
I’m getting a PS5 for the same reason I got a PS4…SPIDER-MAN!
A legendary game awaits us.
Yuri’s really bringing back his inner Sasuke this time around.
angelo bronte?
What a time to be alive !!! New Spider-man movie coming soon and then this...I'm hyped 🔥
The queens opening shot made me reminisce on the ultimate spider man game so hard
THE WINGSUIT AND A SLINGSHOT
Great, now all we need is to see symbiote Peter dance!  (Kidding!  Kidding!)
The PS6 is here and you are going to have a remaster of spiderman 2 for 4k 120fps
Mate can’t wait
What heroes and villains did you see on screen? I could make out miles Moralez Spider-Man,Peter Parker Spider-Man,prowler that’s all I noticed right back in replies what you saw
love how the venom suit made peter meaner
Amaziiiiiiiiinnnggg
KRAVEN THE HUNTER AND LIZARD AND HARRY AND MILES FLYING AND PETER AS VENOM???   This game is gonna be LIT.
It’s like web of shadows, but so much better
1:26 oh you better not touch her Insomniac I swear to god
I hope you can change to the black suit in gameplay like in web of shadows
It’s basically perfect. Ok now to note some things: I can see some web of shadows influence here- take the symbiote tendrils and that kick combo Peter does. Hopefully we can change suits mid combat. Combat looks incredible, and that web line move is brilliant. The swinging seems smoother, but I’m more excited about the web wings and slingshot. The Lizard looks awesome, and I love Yuri’s voice acting- it’s more aggressive. Also did I see a party at the start? This whole trailer is just brilliant, can’t wait for the game.
11:33 that's a great detail that Peter is so careless about people, while he's under symbiote influence
Finally, the flying mechanics!
Put physical to the water pls
Bro let’s be honest the black suit doesn’t look as good as I expected
🆗🆗🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dinguerie 🕸️❤️
“Spider-man.. is a Menace” - J Jonah Jameson
Hopefully this game will change people’s minds of about the Venom movies and Spider-man 3. This would do a Justice for the symbiote arc.
0:41 wow I was surprised to learn Kraven was a Disciple of The Witness!
No way!
Yeah cool but I was a bit disappointed for the web swinging.. they reused the same animations of the previous two, besides that black suit looked a bit weird to me, hope that it will became more slimy and fit than this.
bhai ab tk 5 baar kr chuka hu complete iss game ko  bss pc ke liye jaldi nikal jaaye
Year 2030 and now we are waiting to see Spiderman 3 on the PlayStation showcase 😅❤
Super Hype for this🔥❤🔥😎🕷🕸🕷
mwah mwah marvel i love you
Cedo ☕
How long do you guys think he’s had the suit at this point in the game cuz when miles sees him it’s clear Peter got the suit recently but the confusing part to me is why he’s so angry already then? I thought the longer he has the suit the more it starts to control him and make him more aggressive but it seems he’s already starting off angry and aggressive.
From what I've heard it's supposedly rated M
putting this here so that when ive beat the game i can come back to it🦭
Please let us hear him say” get back here Kraven! You can’t escape meeee!! I’ll chase you to the ends of the earrrrrtthhh!
looks like a fan made thumbnail lol
Yes I always wanted symbolize Spider-Man
My hype for this game quickly went from 100 to 1000!
LETS GOOOOOO!!!!!
Miles- He's got big teeth  Peter- I got a fist full of dirt   *pops the bully maguire dance*
Looks  more like another DLC. I saw a lot old animations, the same rudimentary stealth, the same kombat, only with few new animations.  Why is it have "2" in the name?
My goodness this looks clean
No ones talking about how peter isnt making any jokes, doesnt care to check on the people he saves or bothers thanking miles for the tracker
Can’t wait ‼️ hopefully it’s much much longer than miles morales
Yoo GOTY no doubt
Take my money!! Let's go!! And what a unique look for the Black Suit Spider-Man!!
Bro I  swear i went nuts watching this wholeeee gameplay!!!
love the expansion of the map cant wait to explore it
(4:34) That minor tone with the classic Insomniac Spider-Man PS4 theme just sounds so incredible/beautiful.
Shattered dimensions  sneak  take down at 4:44
YO
Love how Ganke wants to be part of the team so badly 😂
Yeaa def pre ordering this and the dlc too !! This and Mk1 is all i need for a long time 😂
Pete just threw him at 11:33 😂
Xbox 💚 ?
Why does Spider-Man's symbiotic web not return back to the suit? He will leave the whole suit when flying on the web. And how did Dr. Conors not see Miles in the invis, if the reptiles see the temperature of the victim?! I'm sorry that I'm looking for flaws, but with the web for me a big mistake, venom had it coming back because the web is part of the symbiote…   Почему у человека-паука симбиотическая паутина не возвращается обратно в костюм? Он так при полёте на паутине весь костюм оставит. И как Доктор Конорс не увидел Майлза в инвизе, если рептилии видят температуру жертвы?! Сорян что душню, но с паутиной для меня сильный косяк, у венома она возвращалась т.к. паутина часть симбиота…
Is this ps4?
why is miles lightning blue?
Peak fiction.
Yo that simbyote suit is niiiiice
Is “be greater. Together” implying co-op 🤔
It’s time to kill n
don’t mind me just making my mark on one of the best games of all time
5 years from now we're all going to look back at this write a message for your future self in the replies 👇👇👇
this game was meant to be released on ps4 but they changed that last second because the graphics are not ps5 level
I can’t wait for this game looks insane and incredible 🔥🔥
All that’s missing is Morbius and this game is a complete remake of Spider-Man 3 on PS2… Oh god…
I love how you can see the brutality in Peter's attacks with the Symbiote. The new fighting style has captured it really well!
My speculations is kraven the hunter is gonna be our primary villain like Martin lee was in the first game .then probably green goblin or Harry Osborn as vemon later on. I hope we get some mystero and sandman aswell ☺️
this looks and feels weird, kinda like web of shadows, doesn't feel very spider man-y to me
reciclaram os mesmos movimentos do web swing dos games anteriores.  deviam mudar a movimentação pelo menos quando o Peter ta com o simbionte sei lá
Not very many xbox fanbots in the comments.
Worth the silence
Spider man 2👍👍
I'm  calling it now this game is going to be 85% about miles morales
Great detail to have Pete's webs be extensions of the suit like in the comics and cartoons.
We eating good!! Insomniac alway delivers the goods 😎😎
I wonder if it'll get to a point where Miles will have to fight Parker after fulling succumbing to the symbiote?
Just me or peter has some "GET BACK HERE SHOCKER" in his voice?
Does the black suit look weird to anyone else?
WE GOT THE BLACK SUIT BACK
I will un-install EVERY GAME I HAVE for this- i love it, i can't express how happy i am, and how frustrated people were being, like "whens the gameplay" "whens the trailer" 2 minutes after beating the first one-
Hyped asf
GAME OF THE CENTURY INCOMING
🥶
The goats make a return
This is next gen game? Is look so bad
This is going to be the best game of 2023
The UI is getting on my nerve
I bought a ps5 just for this game
NEED. Not want. NEED.
This is awesome, I’m sad though because he’s gonna be mean to Miles and MJ. 😢
Let's now wait until part 3 comes out I bet that it'll center around Spider-verse
I hope we can see miles fight symbiote peter in a boss fight
F L O P
Bro i cant wait till fall, let alone whenever pc drop comes out cuz i dont have a ps5 😭
I’m so excited
peter chill😭
Awesome awesome awesome!
Omg ❤,  @yurilowenthal dark Peter voice is just excellent. Gliding, new gadgets and finally returning to the suburbs of New York. Haven't been back since the Ultimate Spider-Man game
For people who don’t like the suit most likely they were chasing venom Peter got there first hince why the suit looks like that it’s his first altercation of having the suit on him most likely will get more sleeker progressing throughout the game
I liked miles yellow venom blast better but still a great game
THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD IM HYPED AS HELL
Bruh, I swear yo… imma have MORE fun playing as Peter than Miles in this game, yo. LOL
Black suit spider-man fights like shattered dimensions
I was hoping the symbiote spiderman threw around goo like how heller did in prototype 2. The tendrils are a cool touch but the way they did it in prototype 2 really felt like a spider leaving webs everywhere after a fight.
Can't wait to watch "Spider-Man 2 full gameplay walkthrough 4K" on youtube because I don't have a PS5
See you in 4 years when it's available on PC ✌️
I don't have a ps5, but I'll get one now.
Just need 500 bucks to get a ps5
Is anyone else excited to see Yuri as Wraith or is it just me?
Is that boozer?
Now show us Wolverine !!! 😢
Dude the traveling mechanics look amazing
I really hope they add the option to free roam with the symbiote suit someone in the future pleas tell me if they do
Just dont ruin this game too by putting in a pro terrorism group (cough blm cough) 😊
Oh boy I can't wait for Kraven to "They said my mother was Insane" himself at the end of the game.
This looks so bad….
2030 y sigo emocionándome por este trailer 🚬❤️
So like is Spider-Man holding his punches back ??? Cause it doesn’t look like it 😍😂
its gonna be crazy good, i just hope they don't mess it up.
Amazing
LETS GOOOOO
Hello future us, who just finished the game. Tell us about it ❤
this is the best trailer of games after the god of war ragnarock
why they gotta change the sound of the webbing to this🤦‍♂
Yuri really sounding less like Peter Parker and more like his other characters
Hoped for a tendrils-free symbiote, I like the OG black suit from the comics. Incredible strength, speed and agility boost and that's it.
“This is something else”
WOW. one art please.
This game looks amazing I hope it gets nominated for GOTY this year
The way the swinging actually goes with the fall momentum.....ahhhh....im nuttin rn
i'm speechless... this for fk SURE gonna be EPIC!
Will this be onlyon the ps5, or will you be able to play from ps4?
I used to wonder why none of the movies ever had a Lizard vs Kraven subplot. Now I know. God was saving it for this game.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amaaaazingggg !!!!!!!!
Can I get a dollar from each person and I’ll have enough to get a ps5 and buy this game help a brother out ?
Marcando presença
I'M FLIPPING OUT!!!!!!!!!!
Peter will be a savage this game & we all here for it. Yesssir!
He sounds a little too much like Sasuke
Another spider-man game that looks the same but gets hyped up anyways by bad taste having idiots who have no standards.   Nice.
It looks like they did it well but I just really hope the balance between playing as Pete and Miles is equal I don’t want one to be more fun than the other they both gotta have their own abilities
I love the subtleness of Miles' theme is when you play as him
This looks kinda trash ngl
Ladies and Gentleman. We are feasting fall 2023.
is it just me or do the graphics look lil low quality honestly if this is what the final product will look like that should also have it for PS4
GOTY! Calling it now
I really hope we get a “A way out” type fight between Peter and Miles, maybe we keep switching between them throughout because the symbiote has taken full control
I bet this will set up a battle later on in the story where you have to fight Peter as miles I swear if it gets to that I will freak out, it’ll be the best boss battle in the game 🤞
ANOTHER MASTERPIECE FOR INSOMNIAC!!
I hear a lil hint of sasuke in pete rn🥳
So I have until Fall to play Tears of the Kingdom until I exclusively play this? 😂
5:00 I live long enough to see Spider-Man using Hadouken!
Imagine the symbiote makes Peter get racist towards Miles
Yuri Lowenthal voice acting never sceses to amaze, even after all these years. From Suzaku to Sasuke, he always had that *iconic* voice. And he's pulling of the Symbiote Peter, pretty well!
This is eventually going to be nostalgic
The U.I looks so weird 😂
Nice to look forward to a game that’s actually gonna be good
Man I worried how the symbiot will turn Peter, if you remember what happen beetween him and MJ in Spider-man 3 then you know what I mean.
Well, that's right, Spider-Man: Web of Shadows 2! 🤠🥃🖤🤍🕸️🕷️🎮🎞️🗯️📦
This looks awesome
Por que veneno de miles ahora es azul?
If Morbius isn’t in this game then I’m not buying it😤
I got mad at first because the first 20 seconds looked so crisp, I didn't even think it was Spider-Man
8:18 4 henchmen. Miles takes out 2  The other 2 driving the boat: 👁️👄👁️
Loving the new traversal
Don’t get me wrong, I think the game is gonna be fun but from what they’re showing us the graphics and ui are a step-down from the original.
Miles: He got big teeth.  Peter: So do I...  This gave me CHILLS!!!
I AM SPEECHLESS
PC?
THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD
Is this a joke?
Kraven looks menacing
Symbiote Sasuke is incredible GOTY soon
Day 1 reservation
Venom will the hardest boss because well he can’t be detected by spider sense
i hope it comes on pc
Incredibly well done! Can't wait to play it
How many times can this adventure get delayed?  *Glitches: Yes!*
Peter gonna show mj what it means to be the black Spider-Man  😈
Hope they make Venom and Kraven playable.
This is like the last hunt comic book
I hope its not baby face peter. I can't take the remaster face seriously.
wraith!!!!!
This looks incredible.  And we might be getting a real Assassins Creed this year too I am beyond hyped
Sick!!!
Story looks phenomenal. My only worry is gameplay. The screen looks very busy and different to the first two games. Could be a good thing though
Can't wait for this fall, this looks amazing!
Looks great. Not a big fan of the UI though, hope they change it to blend in better with the gameplay.
Cool, getting a more grounded Web of Shadows gameplay from this.
Take my money…
TAKE…. MY…. MONEY😤😤😤
Yooooooooo
I cried to be honest
Still no co-op?? 😅
spiderman is venom now?  sick!
GAME OF THE YEAR HAS JUST BEEN REVEALED OH MY GODDDDDDD
they fumbled the black suit icl plus why are all of petes swinging animations the same
Bruh black suit looks so amazing u can hear the aggression in Peter voice
This. Is. So. AWESOME!!! I feel like I'm gonna die! Dude, I hope that after we beat the game, we get to freely play as Symbiote Spider-Man because he is freaking OP as Hell! And how much do you guys bet that Venom's the final boss in the game?
I love the dynamic between switching the hero you play as, you get different methods of attack as well as a different personality
Boss fights, please ! Complex, interesting and various boss fights with  good quality and quantity... That was the only negative aspect of previous Spider Man amd Miles Morales.
Kraven, lizard AND the black suit effect?  TAKE MY MONEY INSOMNIAC!!!!!!
I liking the darker vibe this one has. It's a shame I can't play it since it's PS5 exclusive. Still looks great so far.
1 minute I’m and I’m already having to re-live Loki’s death. Pre ordering now. 🔥
This looks amazing but I still wish the game was co-op
The transformation of the black suit looks soooo sick !!!! I love it
Yeah this looks totally amazing. Cannot wait!
BROO ALL I CAN HEAR IS SASUKE 😂
THIS GAME IS ILL BE LEGENDARY
Bruh I hope we can somehow keep venom after, like the way Eddie and venom have a bond in the latest movies. Or like the futuristic suit that's bonded with the venom symbiote
Fantastic performance from Yuri here—you can really hear the anger in his voice. Perfect for the black suit.
Someone looks like old man Jake Gyllenhaal lol
ngl was hoping there would’ve been more swinging mechanics revealed, i know it’s been said that the swinging would be like way different but it didn’t really look any different. the combat looks fun though and peter’s symbiote suit is alright though i thought it would kind of look like maguire’s suit where he’s “one” with the suit in a sense, not just the symbiote laying on top of the suit he has already
Best game everrrrrrr
ngl i've rewatched this too many times already bro...
Lets gooooo. Who else gonna watch this years down the line 😂😂
Insomniac brought the heat holy cannoli, we are in a golden age
Its looking like a great year for video games
Can’t wait for this game the switch to Peter to miles is hella dope also 💯
THEY GOT THE WEB WINGS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
Bro this story better be 20+ hours😫
Everything look so perfect I can't wait to play! Only complain I have is the gliding. I hate how the MCU normalized Spider-man gliding.
Web of Shadows is my all time favorite Spider-Man game, so I hope we get some similar black suit abilities. Like those awesome tendril combos and picking up/throwing cars. Also, bring back the ability to chain web strikes and swing into people like a wrecking ball.
Holy guacamole
The graphics look soooo goood! A huge jump from Spider-Man ps4 . So lifelike !! Haven’t seen anything like this before . Pushing ps5 to it’s limit
I hope that similar to Ultimate Spider-Man, they make Venom playable after completing the story, or even as a 100% completion reward. That would be such a great way to implement him and keep the players playing for even longer! I also got a lot of Spectacular Spidey vibes from the trailer, with Miles’ dope gliding webs, and the water surfing, very cool. Overall though, whatever they do I’m happy regardless, because Insomniac *NEVER* Misses!
The web swinging looks so much faster in this!! I hope it allows you to do 360 swings around a pole like older games did!
so cool
11:32 lo bota como cochinada
Beautiful gameplay
7:16  The Lizard: [growls]  Miles:  That wasn’t me.  Peter: Me either.  Ganke: I don’t even have a stomache   I love Peter has some sense of humor as well as the dark side
HYPE
6:43 that moment feels like came out from horror.  I Love it!!!
Thinking that venom in this game is Peter and is the final boss
THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD.
....
Web of Shadows vibes
3:45 THE SOUNDTRACK CHANGE
Love that Miles basically does a kamehameha, in the comics he loves DBZ so it makes sense
Spidey Voice reminds of sasuke and that’s enough to make this game perfect
I remember I was Spider-man and used my tendrils to penetrate my enemies.
Take my money now 😂
I like how aggressive spidey sounds He doesn’t only sound aggressive  But also he fight aggressively as well Just to show the effect that the symbiote has on Peter
vs capcom when
Leaving this as a reminder that I was here in the first 30 minutes of the trailers release
I have an Xbox. I'm so depressed.
I COMING
That was awesome
Insomniac is absolutely CRUSHING IT! When I saw Peter bust out the black suit I lost it! And the Symbiote combat looks insane! Like Web of shadows insane. Yeah, remember that game? And can we talk about Yuri Lowenthal's acting performance? Perfectly reflects the rage the suit gives off. And everything else about this trailer is just perfection! Kraven's reveal, the gameplay, visuals and spectacle and just EVERYTHING!  Feels like only last year we saw the first gameplay reveal for Spider-man PS4. (sigh) How time flies.
Web of Shadows vibes
GOTY
Oh this game is already greater than ever😎
Y'all ain't got to convince me, I'm going to buy this game. 10/10 on the symbiote combat and design.
YOU CAN’T ESCAPE ME, I’LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EAAARTH
Hello future me(if I'm still alive) or future viewers 👋
perfect
lemme guess, peter's the final boss and you have to beat him as miles
The graphics disapoint me. I was waiting for something more outstanding comparing with the first game
MULTI TAKEDOWNS??
10/10 this is already gonna be a amazing spectacular and ultimate Spider-Man video game ever made! 😃
THIS WILL BE GAME OF THE YEAR
I hope they will expand graphic to the next level, cause Peter looks disgusting imo
So yuri became wraith??
We love to see it
Some cringe lines, but I guess that just comes with the territory.
Now i really have high hopes for the Wolverine game!
When!?
so no coop? 😥
Spider-Man: Be greater Spider-Man Miles Morales: Be greater. Be yourself. Spider-Man 2: Be greater. Together
PLEASE put the Baxter Building somewhere in the city this time!
This looks awesome!
Yuri sounds like Sasuke now lol with all that rage, reminds me of his role during the Five Kage Summit arc dub
PREPARE THE GOTY TROPHY!
This looks absolutely amazing can’t wait for it
so are we going to get venom at like a final boss or will he be dlc or something cause the first trailer showed  him
The wingsuit alone is enough to get me to play
The new web sounds 😩
Jesus Christ the game looks incredible
Game of the year hands down
Jesus Christ, when Peter was kicking that guy against the wall in Queens! I can’t wait to see the new choreography in this game…   Scratch that, I can’t wait for everything!
Very Web Of Shadows like with the suit! Just what I was hoping for!!!
doesn't gliding kinda defeat the point of web swinging?
With Wraith confirmed it would be interesting to see if Symbiote Peter teams up with her now that he has all that aggression and Miles has to stop them.
Gta 6 next I hope
My god.
I just wanna see Wolverine 😢
At first I thought it was just another stupid anime game…but then I heard his voice…and I knew we were in for something special :)
I love the look of the new symbiote suit. I looks more like bio armor, something akin to the Guyver.
Well we know where this story is going
I WANT IT ALL!!!!
They changed the UI and hud and it looks phenomenal. This game actually looks surreal overall.
Absolute perfection! 👌👏👏
this. was. peak.
Bradley Cooper?
This is amazing!
I thought we were getting a gameplay trailer. Insomniac, you spoil us.
THIS IS SO GAS!!!
Alr saw this on the showcase teehee
Watch the MCU get inspired off this symbiote suit
2:19 The house definitely reminds me of Sam Raimi OG setting for Tobey McGuire in the first film  (Edit) UPDATE YALL: It was speculated/confirmed to actually be Dr. Connors' house, that's why they were surprised to see Spider-Man instead they were initially looking for the Lizard from the jump
DE LOKOS
Miles and Peter is gonna fight for sureeee
I was here. This is beyond amazing, spectacular, incredible to me
I really wanna play this game!!!
11:28 Peter just shoves the dude to the ground. That symbiote rage though >:)
this looks like a glorified expansion pack lol
OMMMMGGGGGG
Spider Man’s deeper voice kinda sounds like Vegeta
This team has proved time and again how waiting to show only like 1 or 2 things right before release is actually a great idea, and instead oh idk maybe ignore all the whining in service of working on perfecting a near perfect game. They are doing incredibly well with all the pressure, and hopefully now people will realize they will never miss. These are good people doing good things, don’t make them an enemy like you could for shitty corporate money hoarders who don’t care about their games/movies. Oh n I’m not talking to you specifically lol only the fans I’ve described.  I wasn’t a fan of Insomniac at first too and wanted Sucker Punch oddly enough, but that was before they released anything. I love having my mind changed
criminal that this isnt on pc.. looks so good!
Imagine if black suit Peter faces shocker in this game 🤣🤣🤣 iykyk
Amen
I CAN"T WAIT!!!  I LOVE THIS GAME ANYONE KNOW WHEN IT IS COMING IN AUSTRALIA?......
Feels like 2018 again. The year of great Spiderman content
I was here
I hope Pete has to dig his way out of his own grave again.
KVEN КВЕН КВЕН ПРИВЕТ!!!!!!!!!!!!
Goty right here
It’s looking so awesome
Miles: You sure? he’s got big teeth  Peter: *So do I.*  Miles: 😳  I love how dark Peter got here
Dude!!!
Wow, Assassin's Creed and Spiderman both coming out in Fall. This is going to be fun!
DUDE THIS LOOKS SO GOOOOOOODDDD  2023 is a great year for spider-man fans! (Except the comics)
I'm so hype for this game
ehhh not too impressed yet.
The graphics are clean as he'll, it looks like an Infamous GAME by SuckerPunch
Looks so good it’s a shame I don’t have a ps5 😭
All I’m hearing is Sasuke in a Spider-Man suit
They put their whole Sonussy into this one…
Is there someone else who thinks that Peter's black suit is looking cheap and desperately need a redesign, or it's just me?
Один вопрос, что мать вашу с графикой,если она таковой и останется не вижу смысла не выпускать её и на пс 4
Knowing Yuri’s work on Sasuke this’ll be a treat hearing him as the aggressive Black Suit Spidey
Spidey is back in New York.  More angry. More Brutal. More Spectacular.
my boy miles throwing out kamehamehas thats crazy
We got Two Spider - Mans,  Kraven the Hunter, The Lizard, Venom, and possibly Green Goblin?!   Not to mention if they might bring the original sinister six back from the first game, _Complete Chaos_
Hype meter just went through the roof, can’t wait for this game 💯
Hope they added suit tearing as u battle more
This looks awesome!
9:19 where was Pete's spider sense in this moment tho, no way he'd get hit by that
well its seems a master piece
🍿
when spooder-man said it was 'spooder time' I lost it
SPIDER MAN SPIDER MAN CAN DO WHATEVER A SPIDER CAN
HOLY SHYT!
Bro I just finished replaying the first game and was wondering when the new one will be coming out. And then I go onto YouTube and lo and behold, a gameplay reveal. Feels like God sent this video to me trough my recommended.
what game is this
Well, that could NOT look any better than it does. Can't wait. Great showcase of what we know, upgraded even better! Controlling the symbiote, freakin' awesome.
Who knew Angelo Bronte getting eaten by an Alligator would turn him into Kraven The Hunter 😂
When insomniac listen to the community 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
🤯🤯🤯
Release for PS4 platform please 😢
I just wrote this comment
My wallet crying after Spider-Man 2 and Mortal Kombat😢
That miles vs Peter fight is going to be peak
I cant wait
fine I guess I'll throw away my xbox
ДА ПОЯВИТЬСЯ ЗДЕСЬ ВЕЛИКОЛЕПНЫЙ KVEN  KVEN KVEN KVEN KVEN KVEN KVEN KVEN....
This game is making me h*rny right now bro. Feels like 2018 again😂
Real
this will be the greatest game to ever be relesed into the earth
You can tucking fly
miles didnt sense pete casue its been bonded to him before so its invisible to their spider sense great attention to detail
man i thought i heard sasuke like crazy in the first game but now that he was the black suit i hear nothing but sasuke now xD cant wait
Dude at 3:10 bro pulled a Arkham Batman holy
Miles' slingshot was unbelievable!!!
Omg just omfg I’m soooo excited Jesus happy day SYMBIOTE GAMEPLAY AND THE AUIT LOOKS SO AMAZING JUST AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
IM TELLING YOU GUYS WE’RE NOT READY !!!!!!!
I love the aggression in petes voice. I just don't think I'll be able to take the new face model seriously when I'm looking at Tom Holland being all dark and aggressive. It works with the symbiote suit but they should of kept the original face.
Is Kraven’s actor, Boozer from Days Gone??
Pete taking his Spider-cop voice to the next level
I really hope we get to keep the symbiote, but I have a feeling we might not. But I also can’t wait for Venom and hope we get to play as him. But that’s just me hoping
"YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME! I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE END OF THE EARTH!!!"
outros 300 conto que não vão para as roupas da Shein da muié....
1:27 First look at Wraith man!!!!! so awesome.
In Insomniac we TRUST.
Peter killing people with those slams
Wow, they are really diving into the alien powers of the black suit. Usually you only see symbiote action like that from venom himself, never symbiote spidey
I CANT WAIT
Mid just like the first game
cant wait in 3-4 years to play this game!
This game looks so dope
I FCKIN LOVE IT <<<<3
The symbiote suit looks sick
Also love lizard getting kaijufied.
So kraven and the lizard are gonna be in the game I’m so excited
To all the Xbots calling this a kids game… or another over the shoulder walking simulator… all I have to say is GG.
That’s the inner Sasuke in Peter😂!
See ya on pc version with mods in 4 years from now
Couldn't have uploaded in 4k?!
This game will turn into assasins creed. Copy and paste. Gets old
I wonder if Green Goblin makes an appearance in this game too. But that’s prolly too many villains by that point
AAAAAAAAA
Nahhhhh they going crazy bro. Take my wallet.
I love how more violent and brutal spider man is with the symbiote
Why is this game not on xboxxx😭😭
I wonder if the change in colour of Miles' Venom Blast is Spider-Verse related?🤔
At this point Disney Sony and Marvel should give Insomniac access to everything Marvel and a big fat budget. These developers are wizards.
I better get spidey crawling out of the grave!!
lmfao at the Bro Kraven fakeout I appreciate all the reference they seem to be taking from the original comic book symbiote run and DeMatteis' work on the title
drop multiplayer i bet loads of people would play that
Peter's stress and anger in his voice, stubbornness and dismissiveness towards Miles is very worrying and scary. Mainly because of just how thoughtful, understanding and gentle he has been depicted in the previous games.  Edit: Yes ik that the black suit does that Lmao.
This is the moment all we have been waiting for 🔥
you can literally hear how peter sounds in the symbiote, menacing and everything 😭😭
I dont think West End and West 85th is in queens lol 3:32
3:09 I recognize that kick move from the ds version of web of shadows 😭let’s fuckin goooo
Love the symbiote but I kinda don’t like how it looks hardened on some parts of him like it looks like he has armor and then the symbiote on top of that but everything else bout this looks perfect man
Game looks EPIC! Love how Kraven looks and the switching between two Spidey’s will only enhance the playing experience
1:33 ARE THEY GOING TO DO THE THING?!?!
Guys, don't trick yourselves. This game looks messy. Graphics look bad, venom suit looks like it's came out from a slime challange. Webs are not as detailed as they were before. They really rushed it. Such a dissappointment.
THE GREATNESS CONTINUES!
Am I the only one who is not satisfied by this look of venom symbiot spidy it can be way more better than this and the first transition of his suit when he rushed of of that shak is  needed to be improved i think 💬
The way that Yuri Lowenthal voices Black Suit Spidey gives me chills
esse começo igual o roteiro vazado do filme do Kraven
from rick the door technician to angry spider man. Truly got his promotion
Someone gift me a PS5 Pls :(
this is gonna be game of the year
Cant wait to see how amazing venom looks if Spider-Man looks that badass in his symbiote suit!
This trailer sent me!! It looks spectacular!
😳😳
Call back to WEB OF SHADOWS
5:00 🌝🌝🌝🌝
Insomniac… I love you🥲💯😭👊🏾🔥
It’s times like these I wish I didn’t have an Xbox
We See us in 2026 🎉❤😮😊
I been waiting for this ever since it was first announce and now that I was a ps5 I will be waiting for it
double web perched take down, web line to walk  across, the new colorful menus? BRUH!
Yuri Lowenthal is the BEST voice actor for Spider-Man for sure, especially with his emotional range, you’ll actually be able to hear the symbiote have an effect on Peter.
Oh I’m so hyped, not just for new areas of the map, but for the gliding mechanics as well, not to mention catapulting!?!? OH I’M IN!!!
DUUUUUUUDDDDEEE I NEED IT YESSS
Скоро поиграем))
peters voice and attacks being more aggressive with the symbiote is a nice addition
Omg finally Bully Maguire
the fact that you switch between the two spiderman mid fight is freakin awesome, i can already tell the combat is gonna be fire🔥🔥🔥
Why does it look like a mobile game
W game bout to spend 80 dollars
downgrade you can't make a normal spider man? what's in the Disney movies what's in your can't it be any harder? it's a symbiote and you just have a spider-man in black no different from a simple Parker
THE SYMBIOT SUIT LOOKS GREAT OMGGGGGGGGGGG!!!
Meh its been done
Привет всем русским здесь 😅😅😅😅😅
This looks amazing!
Dejo este comentario para recordar la nostalgia que vivi al verlo por primera vez (comentario , te veo en 5 o 10 años)
GOTY material. Looks 10/10
Kinda reminds me of prototype the symbiote gameplay
POG
Aaaaand I'm sold. Whats even better is that it comes out this year!!!
Yeesssssssss!!
Id love to see it cut to ganke as he is just screaming into a headset in the safety of wherever he is, as the drone is launched into the ship.
I honestly like the idea of two active Spider-Men. Peter doesn’t have to die and still gets his shine this game with the Symbiote suit. I love being able to switch between both. Peter fan boys just hate anything different but this looks like they’re implementing the idea of two spider-men well. I mean makes sense. I love that they use the same name. Because it doesn’t matter who’s under the suit. Just the symbol the name and the sigil represents.
I like how they teased the symbiote can be repelled or be detached by Miles' powers at the end motto. Kind of simplifying maybe a Peter boss fight in the end and Miles being the key to remove the symbiote from Peter's body and killing Venom.
Oh my god the map is going to be even bigger. Such a relief
Wraith is going to make an appearance! Yuri Watanabe is coming back to Marvel's Spider-Man 2!
YES FINALLY ACTUAL GAMEPLAY!!! So hyped for this great to be a Spider-Man was hoping Lizard was show up after that ending for Miles Game Yuri Lowenthal voice for an aggressive Spider-Man is on point those black suit moves are like from Web Of Shadows wonder if you can switch between the two suits like on there. Was hoping Miles would get a Black Suit too maybe later. Peter might know the suit is changing him and needs to get rid of it great Miles had his own theme music when you switch to him I like how his Venom power is blue now. And Harry got mentioned so Peter must have gotten affected by him and I really like this Peter having a Spider partner always wondered what it would be like if Peter had a sidekick
What a time to be alive 😩😩😩
AMAZING !
Da GOAT🕷🔥
One thing I haven't seen anyone talk about is his underarm webs. I'm glad they finally brought them in, and they look so smooth too. Traversal in this game is gonna be fun as hell.
This game is gonna be AMAZING. BLACK SUIT TIME !!!
They made the map bigger too? This games gonna be amazing.
GOOD
Sony gimme the option to pre-order this for the love of god.
Game of the Year.
Will this be on ps4
KRAVEN?!
Amazing Game.
They killed it with Kraven… dude looks sick asf
All I hear is sasuke when Peter yells 😭
Yay, kraven isn’t wearing armor
I love the Spiderman 3 reference
1:33 lizard!
please tell me are there other villains besides Kraven, Lizard and Venom?
Hope Peter gets a rematch with Rhino with the Symbiote suit og fans remember how Symbiote spider man destroyed Rhino in the TAS Spider man show
I'm so hyped!
At first I was like what did they do to solid snake lmao.
Amazing
Kraven hunting Lizard while black suited Spider-Man fights them in a game? I’m getting Spider-Man 3 game flashbacks! Looks fantastic though
Lmao that’s Peter Uchiha in there. Yuri sounds as good as ever
TAKE MY MONEY!!!
Who else was confused at the showcase and thought "ain't nk way this is Kraven"?
is that Lizard or Killer Croc lmao
So many characters in here
I just came
Loving the aesthetic of the black costume. Venom's going to look awesome in the endgame.
web wings, catapult, dual takedowns, web ropes and the symbiote + more... THIS IS GONNA BE FIRE
Def coming back to this comment in a couple years
ShockerRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Who do you think will be the game of the year say peter's sense
Sony rlly showed us the whole game lol
I love this game reveal!
The fighting style, design, story Looking like an A+ right now
Ok, WHO LET THEM COOK??!!?!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man I hope they add the tasm2 suit can’t wait to get
So is it co op or not
One of the best gameplay reveal trailers ive seen in my life
Looks amazing can’t wait to watch someone play it on YouTube cuz I can never get a console or a pc hehehe 🙂😀😀😀
I love this so excited for the game
Omg two N
That triple kick into the house 🔥😮‍💨
I don’t have a ps5 😭
see you in 10 years when someone wants to relive the memories of this game.
Looks great. Needs to come out soon! ❤
This game is gonna be insane. I hope it’s a long story mode
this is so hard
Black Cat, Prowler, Wraith, Tombstone, Peter's spiderman, miles spiderman, lizard, taskmaster,  rhino,  doctor octopus,  electro, Kingpin,  and im trying to pinpoint the one above Taskmaster.... 1:29-1:34. i had to pause each time as some changed
Hi future gamers
I was so excited for this... right now it looks like an early PS4 game and somehow it looks worse than the Spiderman 2018 game 😔
where it says “together” the symbiote takes over then electricity comes after… Miles Morales VS Black Spider-man foreshadowing..?? calling it now
Spider-Man 2 is EASILY my most anticipated game ever it looks perfect that gameplay trailer was Amazing  The symbiote suit looks incredible love , all the new combat that comes with it, new ways to travel AND seeing Kraven & Lizard was great they look badass. can't wait for this game
IM calling it game of the year
Game of the year for sure!
JOGAO VIU
I hate having am xbox
Spider-Man gets the Venom suit in this game?! I thought it was stuck with Harry.
Xbox is better 3:09
They got us in the first half but came back in the second lol
hello if your watching this in 2030 trying to get a piece of nostalgia
The predict of Spider vs Spider is almost there
When will this game be released?
Best heart attack ever
I thought his electric powers were yellow
Kraven and Venom in one game!!!!!
They are going to get some good feedback from this playtest, that's for sure!
It's disappointing....
peak
Oh my god yesssssss
I know i'll be back in the future to this trailer after this game has been released by 2 years lmao
I WOULD LOVE TO PLAY THIS GAME, BUT YOU CLOWNS MADE IT ONLY FOR STUPID PLAYSTATION. YOU'RE OVERRATED AND SORRY. Nobody plays PLAYSTATION.
Just for recordance, i was here, jumping and screaming when this trailer showed up
12:19 Guess this one is all about teamwork huh?
Just don’t release with performance issues please 🙏
Peter's Controlled by Venom!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥LET’S GOOOO
Symbiote Spiderman in all of his glory!
oh my W
Wow!
impresionante,me asombre tanto con los pocos minutos que vi que decidi dejar de verlo para no spoilearme mecanicas e historia.
And this ladies and gents, is the beauty of insomniac games.  Magnificent.
Nah this game looks 🔥 Game of the year 100%
I LOVE THIS HOWEVER.. Why you got Lizard looking like a croc instead of a lizard
Bru the gliding
I needed it
It looks perfect already
@marvel You all know, as well as us now, that you DID IT AGAIN! This looks amazingly awesome and I can't wait to give you my money.
How do i still not have a ps5 bruh
Omg Kraven, giant lizard, black costume. Is this a remake of Spider-man 3 (2007) the game? Can't wait!
VEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
10:52
The first 5 seconds got me thinking this wasnt spiderman 😂😂
the hud is ugly, the symbiote suit design is even uglier, everything else looks great
This looks way too good
Need a batman game
it looks amazing omg
So many incredible little touches like at 11:32. You can see how aggressive its making Pete. Love it!!!
yo
I just really hope this game is hard to play, I hate when these games are too easy, I need a challenge!!
Spiderman really out here murdering people again
Hadouken! 4:59
Am I dreaming I must been dreaming
Spiderman meets Just Cause
:O
"Spider-Man doesn't kill anyone"
Ther is only one spiederman - Peter Parker. I hate insomniac...
This is game looks amazing
Can we get a game like hulk ultimate destruction. It’s been so long
The graphics the gameplay….. omg as if we didn’t know already but after this show it’s confirmed PlayStation buried shitbox good luck trying to compete with this 😂😂😂😂
3:10 Bro ended his next generation 💀
whoooaaa what a reveal!!!
Watch them downgrade this
Early
THE UNDERARM WEBS, BRO MY WALLET IS GONNA KILL ME
Va estar con madre.
Miles and Peter fight 100%
So… No multiplayer 🥺
the symbiote 'suit' upgrade is what i need for pete to match the 'venom powers' miles have
Pre ordering soon as possible
YOOOOOOOO THIS WAS CRAZY
Why does he sound like Nolan's Batman?? 😂😂😂
Haven’t been this hyped for anything since no way home
Love how menacing and merciless peter sounds when fighting
Wow im pumped
Hol
I don't like new interface, I don't like how black suit looks, I don't like how water looks, but everything else is AMAZING!
Honestly im supper disapointed I was really looking forward to this game but I dont see anything to be hyped about. The graphics look really bad I do not like the direction they went with the suit, the half organic half armor looks out of place. Too much Miles focus same swinging same combat asside for venom powers. Ul looks horrible and the wind tunnel mechanic looks like something from ps3 era. Really killed my hype
Let's go! I knew Kraven will make an appearance. He's underrated, but a really great villain of spider man.  Edit: I have a feeling that Peter's going to abandon that symbiote momentarily.
Everything about this looks amazing. I liked the gliding mechanic and venom’s abilities. So cool to see the contrast between Peter in the first game to this one, he’s become a menace.
disappointed with the web swinging, Looks pretty much the same, I mean hey if it ain't broke don't fix it. Was just kind of hoping for an overhaul cause the swinging in insomniacs previous titles gets old really fast and feels kinda predetermined and slightly on rails unlike Spider-Man 2 for the PS2, Overall it Looks amazing though I'm pretty excited either way
dude i just can’t with how much this is sasuke uchiha
“Harrys dying” oh man 😮
Yuri Lowenthal’s really pulling out Sasuke for Peter this time around.
This is how you do trailers. You make it *very long*
PS4 graphics
Praying for a solid 60fps performance mode!
Too much Miles in my Spider-man game. Never wanted to play as him.
My idea is that every suit will have a symbiote version, like is not a new suit but a new mechanic
Welp I'm buying a ps5
This finna be the game of the year
This game looks insane
THIS GAME LOOKS INSANEEEE! 🔥🔥🔥
Awesome
I'm gonna be disappointed if I don't hear "I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye" in this game.     Jk, this looks so awesome.
OH MY GOD
It would be cool if u could switch between normal and symbiote!!
LETS GOOOOOO
Don’t even bother making any more games. It’s OVER.
The Black suit looks dope as ever
Animation of the swinging are the same  Sybmiote suit is looking like aliexpress copy  And graphics is better in first spiderman ps4 😢 You should hire moders for the first game
Best dlc yet! Come on Wolverine be different.
it looks Like The Brooklynn Bridge is Really fix
Bro I love edgelord Peter 😂
“We’re gonna have some fun”
ok its seems great..day one for me .but..come on...the exact same walking animation , the exact same swinging animations ! (The web swinging  its one of the most important thing in a spiderman game and they do the same as marvel spiderman 1 😭 )the close to same exact fighting animation...its lazy 😢....its like marvels spider man  V1.7
W
wow Prototype still look insane 🔥
When “BE GREATER. TOGETHER” showed up on the screen I got teary eyed. This game is gonna be insane!
Man this looks incredible, looks like Spider-Man season is back, new Spider Verse coming out, and this. Too bad I don't have a PS5 yet😅
The sequel looks practically the same.
I feel like there will be a boss fight against peter where you play as miles trying get the Symbiote off of him
I guess i need an oled tv
I love how there's pieces on the black suit that move around slightly
Finally one of the best games of all yime is back Fans : HE'S BACK
So the leaks about venoms fightset was true 2 years ago
have no words just stunning and I literally can not stress how much I just want to play this game bro. Insomniac will forever have my respect for making the best superhero games ever
This is amazing!!!
One of the only good things from this showcase. I love PlayStation but fact that this was the highlight yet we have known about its existence for over a year is sad.
my dopamine levels are through the roof rn
Oh my God. WTF guys?! Blow my mind.
WOWSERS!!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Currently shittin myself I’m so excited
This looks really promising and if the game lives up to what this trailer shows it's gonna be so great
God i love peters anger
this is going to be one of the best games of all time
That black suit looks disgusting in the best way. Real excited!
Sasuke lmaooooo
Day one
Game of the year?
Not that great
3:10, I absolutely love the fact that the developers included that kick move as a nod to the move in the Spider-Man: Web of Shadows DS game.
outdated graphics
Peter looks so menacing in that black suit.
Es tan cinematográfico que es difícil de creer que sea un vídeojuego, adoro que sea así porque lo hace insuperable visualmente y en la jugabilidad también es muy destacable.  Sin duda será un juego para la posteridad.
See y'all when the game comes out
See you in fall 2023 on the release date
Probably the hardest gameplay trailer theyve ever released. 10/10
FINALLY
After the Miles Morales game I was worried Miles was gonna be infinitely more fun than Peter, but with the Symbiote they both look fun as hell
I can't get over how wonderful it looks 😍
peak
And if you thought Yuri was putting on that Sasuke flair before… This isn’t a complaint either I love the voice period. Fits super well.
Hello future me
Here's everything I got, kraven is hunting all the old villains and a new one wraith aka yuri and now venom and peter are teaming up to find Connors and stop him while also getting hunted down. IMA cry😭. Also harry is dying from a disease and needs Connors help, that's all I know for now.
i cannot wait for this to come out
brooooo
Wonder why Miles has blue electricity and yellow electricity
I LOVE how you can tell the symbiote is induicing more and more rage onto Peter just by the sound of his voice.
Looks like we're getting another Bully Maguire
Congrats on actually motivating me to pick up a PS5
Masterpiece already.
4:58 How Raiden 😲
no release date. rumored to be September? Hope it's true.
I'm crying, this is literally a dream
Take. My. Money.
IT LOOKS AMAZING
They didn’t disappoint
Yuri Lowenthal is so freakin' good man, he's already killing the symbiote-tainted Peter Parker role so hard
bro GILDING THIS GAME BE TOP SELLER
Me wishing a had a ps5 so bad rn
We not gonna talk about how they made the lizard Killer Croc from Arkham Knight?
this game looks so good, definitely gonna be my favorite game this year. it’s really unfortunate it’s gonna lose to Zelda for game of the year
Peter seems to be very agressive. I hope we will have a fight between him and Miles
This game finna go hard
The suit is a master piece
3:03 broooo the voice is too good🔥
game of the year everyone
Could be a possible top tier game of the year?
Looks like a PS4 game... Especially the intro and water effects. Hope there's more of a balance between Peter and Miles rather than mostly Miles
gud
All I hear is sasuke 😂😂😂😂
KRAVEN!!!
omg
garbage
5:00 is peak sound design
my dumbass thinking this was the last of us: factions in the beginning 😂
I like how impatient and aggressive Peter’s become.
omg
He's really tuning into Sasuke now
This game will be masterpiece
WOW
I reeeeeally hope the Subreddit can get sane again now
Yuri’s deep symbiote voice had me expecting him to say to Kraven: I’LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EAAAARRRRRRTH.
11:54 peter turned into Sasuke lol
I want it already 😭
I love the extra touch of Miles not even sensing Peter when he comes crashing down through the roof. Hope that's consistent in the game like in the comics
The game looks frickin sick
this looks freaking amazing!!!!!!! oh man those spidey/symbiote moves got me droolin
My tip is sticky
I wanna see Arkham Batman and Symbiote PS5 Spidey fight, tbh it would be so fire 🔥🔥🔥
🔥
I feel like Peters going to be a boss fight at some point and thats where he gets rid of the symbiote and passes it on to somebody else who becomes venom or what if Peter becomes Venom man i cant wait to see what happens
the symbiote suit is kinda ugly  but the rest is just amazing
THIS LOOKS SICK AS HELLL 🔥🔥🔥
It gives me that in terms of plot, the symbiote will be a reason for rupture between Peter and Miles
Ending game me chills
Can't wait to never play this because it's exclusive 🤕
They showed so much but the great thing is I have so many questions: How do Harry and Norman fit into Peter getting the symbiote, how does Yuri fit in, and how did Ganke get that tech 😂. I need this game immediately
No new swings ):
Crispopp
this looks good!!! instant buy
I think Peter and miles are going to fight. The way “ Be greater together” is covered by the symbiote then shocked by miles power 🤔
:O
11:31 you can really tell the black suit is taking over pete
Such a shame this is not coming to PS4, imagine the revenue and happy players.
Ol' Web Pits is back baby!
THE TRAILERS OUT LETS GOOO
I’m so excited
I actually thought this was fake first time watching
As a legend once said “I NEEEEDDDD ITTTTT!!!”~SpongeBob SquarePants
Zelda...and now this? 2023 is a festival for gamers
Already know what GOTY is for me!
Yuri’s voice acting in the starting combat sequence is just amazing, you can feel the anger in his voice, you can tell the symbiote is in control now.
omfg those animations
BE GREATER, TOGETHER(?) I have myself , anime and God
Yuri Lowenthal already killing it I see
im loving how the tension between peter and miles is slowly building up and so is of how he seems to be desprate to try and save harry from dying and its awesome seeing his combos are very different and also so badass that the dude has wingsuits attached to him and hes more aggressive and just not paitent (sorry for ranting lol)
You guys better give this Venom a comic accurate story. im sick of almost every adaptation making Venom evil when he's not. We're past the King in Black arc, so you guys have no excuse now
I want to play as Spider-Man, not Miles Morales. What is he exactly? Turnin invisible? Shooting electricity?? That's not Spider-Man like.   And I wished for R2 L2 web swing system where you control right and left hands. Same game as Spiderman 1 or Miles Morales only different animations. ( Dodge animations are exactly the same ) I wanted a better more complex swining system not gliding like Arkham series. That's Batman's thing.
En momentos como este, quiero una play 5.
Peter and Miles can glide?
ALV! JUEGAZOOOOOO
This is AMAZING!!!!!!
Lo que me voy a fumar este juego no va tener sentido. Unas ganas increíbles. Trabajazo.
Possibly THE game???🤔🤔
I’m loving Yuri’s take on Symbiote Spider-Man!
I can't wait to play this game
Yuri Lowenthal's symbiote voice is terrifying, it's perfect
AMAZING!!!!
If I had a nickel for everytime a spiderman game had a stealth section, I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.
this looks amazing, the web sling sounds so nice and i hope the symbiote is like web of shadows.
LIZARD
But what if it sucks?
This……. This was just perfection
Kraven could be a playable character.Just saying.
🔥
Even got the accurate black webs wow Im already sold
When black suit Spidey is just Yuri doing his curse mark Sasuke voice 😂🤣
This game looks like it has a good future... it will be and it is a masterpiece
wtf happened to the graphics of this game
I just hope a pc version comes out close to the ps5 release date
The texture on the symbiote  suit looks more ooze like than A suit. Pretty cool detail.
We're starting to see the Spiderman series grow like what happened with Batman Arkham, Nice
I thought this was a movie lol
Symbiote suit looks amazing
Sooo now we have slingshot and web wings this is going to be awsome!!!! And let’s not forget double takedowns
I hope it’s actually dark like Peter isn’t the same at all
finally
After spiderman web of shadows I thought we'd never get to play as symbiote spiderman, my inner childhood is very happy
YES
Probably the best kraven design so far, the graphics are insane, the water part looks alittle worrying but I'm glad they didn't give a release date so it gives me hope they fix stuff
Insomniac finally gave us all a reason to buy a Ps5
Reminds me of Prototype
Instant game of the year!
More than I expected
Spoderman
I was here when this happenend
WE Will BE THERE!!!!
The lizard is huge! The black suit is so dope
What a shame! Only on ps5 😢
LEEEETSSSGOOOOOO
I can’t wait for this game, I’m so hyped! I’m loving the symbiote gameplay
Es Cine carajjjjo
Already goty I don’t care give me it now
After a year and a half
No co-op?😢
Finally 😍
This game finna be lit asl 💯🔥🗣️
ESTO ES BLOODBORNE VERDAD?
Game of the year. Absolutely without a doubt
I can't express what i'm feelling after seeing this
OMG!!!!❤❤❤❤
W trailer
Beautiful 😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤ Can’t Wait To Play. ( Not A Big Fan Of The Black Suit 🤞🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽Hopefully It Gets Better Looking Before The Game Comes Out Or As The Game Progresses But I’m Still Loving The Game Either Way).
Why more sneaking missions?
I’m boutta but
Yk you are screwed when Spider-Man stops talking
NO WAYYYYYYY
WE CAN LEAVE MANHATTAN
This ain’t a trailer, it’s a movie💀
As soon as i get a ps5 im gettibg this
IM SO HYPED FOR THIS GAME! LETS GOOOOOOOO!!! THE ANIMATIONS AND CENEMATICS AND STORY LOOKS SO EPIC RIGHT NOW!!! LETS GOOOOOO!!! 😄
My theory is that pete will lose the symbiote at the end and we play as venom with the same abilities
OMG KRAVEN THE HUNTER ACTUALLY HUNTING AND NOT BEING AN ANIMAL LOVER LIKE IN THE MOVIE (allegedly)
They know how to build hype
W
I NEED ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Peter acting like a menace is something I never knew I needed
NEED THIS GAME NOW
The funny thing is, is that yuri plays sasuke, so all I hear is sasuke when he’s in the suit
Amazing
Can’t wait 🕷️
This looks so good
Ded
This is going to be the game of the year
Did I see deadpool on the NY map
GRAPHICS ARE TOP TIER BUT BRO DID I JUST SEE SYMBIOTE SPIEDEYYY YESSIR
Are they going to inject more political garbage into the game like they did with the mile morales DLC sold as a full game?
Holy crap.    Just…. Holy crap.
This is truly mind blowing
Что с комментами? В каком месте графика, костюм и анимации крутые? Графика выглядит хуже чем в игре 18 года, что с водой вообще; костюм выглядит, не как симбиот, а как броня из финала игры 18 года, так и еще как мыло; большинство анимаций - с первой части, полеты не импрувнули. О чем речь? Где некст ген?
As long as we don't have to play as Mary Jane, I'm good! Almost gave myself a headache from how excited I was watching this 🔥
I just nutted
The voice actor, graphics, combat, and plot finna go crazy 😩
SENAO TIVER EMO PARKER É INJOGAVEL
Other boroughs confirmed lets go
Amazing🔥
It's about time
I'm all in
That sequence with the alley oop at the end was *Chef's kiss*
YYYEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!
Sequel to Web of Shadows looks great
Incredible game already, cant wait
You can easily tell by this video that the game is gonna be amazing
isso ai que e jogo de ps5 mds
This is fool sheet
PERFECTION
This looks amazing ahh
This is gonna be the BEST SUPER-HERO GAME OF ALL TIME💯
OH HELL NAAWWWW
So we’re getting a bigger map. I’m so hyped
This isn’t even a game, it’s an interactive movie.
When the black suit was revealed I think I yelled so loud my neighbors could hear me! Lol. The HYPE IS REAL!!! Can’t wait til we get a solid release date! Other Than that, take my money! I can’t wait til fall now.
this is the best game i ever seen
This just keep getting better and better every game 🙌
Man listen! I’m ready ‼️‼️🙌🏾
omg
This Is so awesome the symbiote, ganke and the lizard this Gameplay  Is so exciting 😆
Meu deus, confirmem o Eddie por favor <3  Ai não tem como ficar mais perfeito!!
I have so many questions about this story
It’s not Peter
Going to come back to see this message in 10 years the game ain’t out and I predict it’ll be a 10/10
To Future me looking back at this in 8 years…. I’m HYPEDDDD
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I am not ready to see a bad guy Peter with the simbiote, I just cant
Bro this map is soo big. I can’t wait to explore this game. Definitely a pre - order worthy
The only thing I hate is that this won’t come to pc for at least a year or two and I can’t play this on my ps4 pro
Yuri: Since I’m voicing Symbiote Spider-Man, got any advice? Devs: Channel your inner Sasuke Yuri: Say no more 😊
Kraveeen! I will chase you to  the ends of the Earth!
I cant wait for this game to be released👍👍👍
BROOOO the voice of symbiote peter is amazing. i love his edgy voice
THIS WILL BE GOTY HEAT
I don't know how to describe what I think about it, so unexpected, huge scale.  I loved the first 2 and that one gonna be insane as well for sure, and yes it does look 100% next gen!
Prawler type beat
1:40 BLOODBORNE 2 CONFIRMED!!! 😂😂😂
As someone who has over 150+ hours on the original, this is enough to make a grown man cry 😭
Game of the Year ✅
Un gameplay façon naugthy dog 2016
Am I only one who noticed Miles is the one who saves everybody more than Peter? This is actually a good detail and i love it!
Well it looks like I'm not going to be working out for a while
Yes.. let the symbiote flow through you Peter.. use your HATE
MY GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!! Let’s go!!!!!!!
0 из 10 графика говна
12:19 I love how the symbiote tries to cross out "Together" but Miles' electricity makes it back off.
Finally, everyone was waiting for thisss
He has the web wings he perfected them
Omg!!!! Is Too beautiful!!!! Amazing I can't wait to launch soon for the love of God!!
i dont play video games, but this is just AMAZING wanna play this now
Insomniac be cooking
Man first Help wanted 2 and now spider-man 2?!  Today is a great day for gamers everywhere!
Bro best game ever
I hope Peter will survive. I don't want to watch him die.
And here ill have to wait +4 years until its released on pc :'(
omg
The trailer was good but wtf is this flying thing with miles and peter???? Its okay to glide a little, but it felt like a superman game
Where is the 4K version? Mind blown though, I was worried if they were going to deliver a truly worthy sequel. No more worries.
This is lit
Hello me in 5 years when this gets recommended for no reason at all
my freind says that zelda tears of the kingdom will win game of the year but he won't admit he's wrong when i tell him that spider man 2 will be better. what should i do with him?
Bro who tf  made the HUD ???
Can’t wait for this 🤩
So we fighting Peter as the final boss?!?!
For People saying it is the best reveal for a gameplay . How is that ?? There isn't any improvements in graphics they only added few animations,  so disappointing  . It looks like spiderman 1 remastered twice
BEFORE A MILLION
This is going to be game of the year without any doubt..... I cannot wait anymore to play as the symbiote Spider-Man..... The aggression and vengeance in his voice, that sent some real shivering down my spine 💯💯💯
We also got a bigger map reveal as well!! Too hyped!!
I guess Insomniac was busy cooking up an entire buffet. What a reveal 😮‍💨
Würde direkt vorbestellt!!! ❤️❤️
PoPPed out the BASEMENT with this release!!
11:54 I just love how he said it
Tremendous W
A Venom Spiderman vs miles Morales would be sick
After 2 years I think all of us can officially say this game is amazing
SYMBOITEEEE
LOL, the trailer tricked me there with hipster "Kraven"
I am severely disappointed with the web swinging and the combat. It’s almost the same as the previous games but with better graphics. If there is no web strike mechanic from web of shadows, then web of shadows will remain the king of combat in Spider-Man games.  Severely disappointed in Insomniac.
Great lets go
VERLIEBT!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Honestly venom is one of my favorite villains besides bill cipher and team rocket (lol) so honestly this is a win win for me
THEY HAVE THE WEB WINGS!!!!!
This Game-bullshit, im fanat spider man, but this...
Video was uploaded 20 min ago ima look back into this comment 10 years from now (may 14) 2023 5:33 pm
Traversal as Miles looked a lot faster than in the older games, zipping around the city should be fun.
This is AWESOME!!!!
Peter out here stealing Miles black teenage swagger
I need a PS5 now. I love that Lizard design
Hell yeah man this is looking amazing I can’t wait
Time for Bully Lowenthal
"They got here fast" says you miles you were traveling faster then peter ever could
i need to get a PS5 ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I never creamed so hard in my mf life 😭😭
What if I don't want to switch to Miles?? Nevermind. I'm not buying this. I want to play as just Peter Parker Spiderman. Not Miles Morales. Not Mary Jane. Peter Parker!!!
stunning visuals, great quick time events, interesting mechanics and nice horror atmosphere in some parts ,this is shaping up to be an easy GOTY
3:37 Ok, now I know which track I’m gonna look for in the future score of this game
Hi people in the future in 10-12 years of coming back to memory lane
Это фиаско
MILES CAN FLY!!!????!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMFG🔥🔥🔥🔥
I was not at all expecting gameplay, let alone getting as much as we got. Symbiote, gliding, Lizard, Kraven. EVERYTHING. This was an honest to God treat for us!
2010 graphics.. anyone who why?
Yes.
Hopefully they show us the customisation suits
Awesome
Awesome
This game+ps5+ 4k screen= unforgotten experience
suit looks awful
*IT'S SPIDEYIN TIME*
Ten years? more like 4 bruh, we’re already nostalgic about rdr2
Love that Peter has the classic Venom Spider Emblem. Black Suit/Venom stans dream come true
Good suit simbiote for peter ✔ Good story ✔ Good game ✔ Beautiful story✔ Good graphics ✔ very good new and spectacular areas✔
Nice dlc
1:28  Isnt Yuri Watanabe the Wraith!?
Real venom is back
The only saving grace to another shitty presentation
lets go mane
People will look back on this as one of the best Spider-Man games ever
I’m not feeling the suit for symbiote Spider-Man that’s an LLLLLLLLLLLL to me it looks like he’s got on shoulder pads but otherwise I’m liking Spider-Man 2 so far 💯🤙🏽
Con ganas de jugarlo, pero yo solo quiero a Peter
Why not PC too 😢
its not better than 1st
I love how cringe Peter is with the simbiote, just like raimi's Spiderman 3
This is game of the year  Hands down.
It truly is still black history month
LORD HAVE MERCY IM BOUT TO BUSS
IVE BEEN WAITING A HOLE YEAR FOR A MASTERPIECE THIS IS THE BEST SPIDER-MAN GAME THAT I WILL EVER HAVE TO PLAY
Evil Tobey Maguire is Coming...
absurdooooooooooooo
Sounds like Sasuke Uchiha!!
The gliding is sick everything’s sick including the anger in Pete’s voice
I don't care about Miles, I just can't wait to play as Peter again!
Epic
My money is on a Peter vs Miles fight
let's go this looks aesome
I hope they balance out the gameplay between Peter and miles
عظمااااااااه مبسوط بالاعلان فشخ مع اني مش هعرف العبها على طول 😅❤
That game ... OMG
He’s got the Venom suit
is it only for ps5? not for ps4
I NEED THIS ON PC PLEASEEEEE
Bro this game looks sooo good 😭😭
LET THEM COOK
I'm disappointed in the graphics.
Yuri's voice acting MY GODDDDDDD
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Finally after 2 years we get a reveal of Marvel Spider-Man 2 👏
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
RIP xbox
This is what you get when you let developers create a game for a next gen console only and not have to make it compatible with 10 year old hardware as well.
I will be back in 10 years 😊
This is deffo worth de wait Ahlie
El traje negro de spiderman se ve increíble 😆😆😆
Omg OMG OOMGGGGGG
THIS IS GOING TO BE GAME OF THE DECADE
My only issue is that miles and Peter web swing the same. That was one of the best things that makes miles better than Peter to play as
rocksteady got a competition this game look so good!!!!!!
OH MY GOD
My faith is restored
11:50 "i wanna put some dirt in your eye"
"He has big teeth." "So do I."   Jesus Christ, Peter
This looks more dark i love it
LOL. Fat Symbiote? I'm laughing my tail off. Marvel is going down the pooper.
See u in 10 years to come back to when u first seen this game
BRING BACK THE OLD SPIDER- oh, are we done with that controversy now?
😍
I hope that after you beat the game you can use the Symbiote suit in the post game open world
So when we finish the story will we still be able to use the venom spider man still?
The symbiote suit combat looks like a glorious blend of Spider-man PS4 mixed with Prototype (which was basically a Venom game is it was :P) SO HYPED!!!
I get that there is a new Spiderverse movie coming... but could we please stop pushing Miles Morales so hard. I grew up with Peter Parker and would actually prefer if i did not have to play Miles at all... Game looks awesome tho.
"Only i'm bigger...and BETTER"
Excelsior!!!
This carried man i'm telling you.
Guess I'm buying a ps5
😱😱😱😱
Kravens scanner of new york shows these people   Peter Parker  Miles  Black Cat  Wraith, Aka Yuri Watanabe   Taskmaster  Lizard  Prowler   Tombstone   Kingpin  And shocker
Omg this looks better than any xbox exclusive coming out for a while i mean project redfall looks great😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
okay
Symbiotic suit is goated
So not on ps4? Because I only have ps4
Look like Fortnite 💀
Btw, did y’all notice that Peter’s in Brooklyn, cause when you look in the beginning, it seems like Manhattan in the background!!!!! Also, Peter is extremely aggressive, it’s even shown when he throws a civilian on the ground instead of helping him .
The biggest thing in marvel gaming
This game is going to be so epic can't wait.
Despite peter got the symbiote,  he still got his humor on the alley whoop part lol ❤
SHOOOOOOCKEEEEEEEER
I love how they’re sticking with the comics by making the symbiote make Pete more aggressive and irritable. Love this reveal!!!
🔥🔥🔥
I’m so in Hype!!!!!
i hope they dont make miles the main character . seems like it at the end
lol never thought this day would come
This game is gonna be awesome. Playing as both Peter and Miles.
Shut Up And Take My Money
I’m buying a ps5
My mind is blown. Back when Miles Morales came out, me and my friend were speculating about what Spider-Man 2 would look like, and wow. I did not the gameplay could get any better, but somehow they've managed to incorporate new techniques, and integrate them smoothly. The web glider and slingshot mechanics look absolutely amazing. I can't wait to see how they explore Peter's dynamic with the symbiote alongside Miles. I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS GAME.
its looks good ngl
the only good thing about this trailer was the beginning with Symbiote-Man beating people up. Then it devolves into an overly long cinematic scripted QTE-fest. Yawn, ill go back to playing elden ring or zelda or something
Ooooh snap finally!!! Been waiting over a since they drop the traile.
This looks so freaking awesome
Looks so good
If they are revealing 12 mins then it should be a pretty long game right? I’m praying it is
Porra, esse jogo vai ser épico ❤️
Bully Maguire is back!
i predict there's gonna be a peter vs miles fight
Definitly GOTY Award Potential not sure it will Win (Tears Of the Kingdom probrably will and) but it will probrably get into the list of winners
I love how toxic Peter is
Love how the interface changes it’s style and colors when they switch up between Miles and Pete
Let’s go
GAME OF THE YEAR INCOMING
Yes Yes Is Here
Alright I Idon’t like it .suit looks unnatural ,like from 2007 movie. interface looks weird  ,to colourful  but it’s not a big deal. moving  looks great but some features like gliding looks  not finished in there not  as brilliant as the flying on the web .black suit and just venom looks really weird but I hope it will be better in the game. Angry Parker is it something beyond the limits. but gunky oh my God why? I don’t need sydekick ,I already have one with powers. bigger map is really cool
Gyat
If Peter ends up being venom I will actually scream with joy
Kraven is amazing
The combat looks waaay better
Definitely saving up for PS5 oh my god
Please have a performance mode
dude, this was so boring
If this game looks THIS BEAUTIFUL, imagine how gorgeous Wolverine is gonna look🤌🏼🤌🏼
So just to be clear lizard, kraven venom and wraith are in the game who knows who else will show up I’m hoping for Mysterio and Sandman
Shoulda known he’d get the black suit. Can’t introduce Venom without Spider-Man getting the symbiote first.
LETS GO, IVE NEVER CLICKED ON A GAMEPLAY TRAILER SO FAST   i now see why they were so quiet and minimal with everything.  this will go down as one of the greatest spiderman games ever.
HOLLY FREAKİNG SHOOT!  PERFECT<3
I didn’t think they’d Deadass show the venom suit😭😭
I was wanting wraith but this is better
KRAVEN IS BOOZER FROM DAYS GONE?!
Mid game
11:31 I just realized peter just tosses that dude he saved to the ground lol
That black suit looks so clean 😭🔥
Words can no express how hype I am for this game
An Uncharted x Just Cause Spider-Man game… perfection.
Scott Adkins to play kraven in live action
Aaaannnddd they never disappoints us 🎉
Time to rewatch this trailer over and over till the next one 🤣🤣
Let's go marvel's spider man 2 still hits 2023 in FALL Hell YES
When 2030 comes, i tell you what i think of the game
LETSSSS GOOOOOOO
ZzzzZzzzzz
Yessss
Beutiful ✨🕷️🕸️
It looks great, and Peter with the symbiote is also magnificent, how it can be seen that it fades into the eyes of the mask, it's spectacular
I’ll come back to this video in like 5 year see this comment and just be happy
….POV: Web Of Shadows Remake…
Love the voice acting for Peter, he sounds so out of character he did a great job
They Added Long island! thats dope
I want to see more web swinging!!
We lost our MINDS in the discord call. What an amazing trailer. From start to finish. Game of the year for me, easily.
Bravo
Nice!
There are parts I dont like of the suit (shoulders are kinda weird) but everything else looks amazing. I'm going to take a guess and say Kraven gets the symbiote for a final fight. Also love how they show Peter's anger growing like how he threw that citizen to the ground and man the combat definitely will live up to web of shadows.
OH MY GOD!!!!!
I cannot believe they showed the symbiote in this, it was awesome!
I feel bad to the people dont who dont got a ps5
BRO,!!!?
Gee I wonder if Peter is gonna realize that the suit is making him evil and ditch it?  For the 9th time.
Spider-Man we got Game of the year in the bag!
Suit looks great, game looks great, only thing is that the swinging looks the exact same.
The symbiote makes Spider-man be so much angrier. His voice is filled with RAGE. I LOVE it!
Как же это ахуенно
Simply blissful just breathe taking fresh new mechanics omg insomniac I’m not mad we dont have a specific date this was absolutely SPECTACULAR
Here before this game becomes an absolute classic in a few years🗿🗿
We won.
the only good thing they showed at the showcase
Graphics sucks.
Wow! 🤯
Шикарное видео! Шикарная игра! Так держать! 😊
I WAS HERE AT THIS MOMENT
Spider-Man 2 MK1 STREET FIGHTER 6 TEKKEN 8 ETC.   2023 YOU HAVE MY ATTENTION
why does rick the door technician have a symbiote suit?
MEU DEEEEEEEUSSS QUE JOGO PERFEITOOOO ❤🕷
Vai ter pra ps4 né? NÉ?
😮
Im so excited I cannot express it properly.
Rip Xbox 💀
Geisteskrank
Please tell me we don't have to play as Mary Jane again 🙏
symbiote suit looks dope
terrible lighting!
This game is peak.
So freaking awesome man  Gives me spiderman web of shadows vibes And you can still play as miles  This game is gonna be the winner of the year
💀💀BEST GAME EVER AND I HAVENT EVEN PLAYED IT YET.
I can’t wait for this 🔥it looks phenomenal what a time to be a Spidey fan
were all gunna love this game calling it
OH FAK YEAAA FINALLY
looks like web of shadows type of combat but still has the old type combat
This looks so good which makes me even more excited for thier wolverine game
The symbiote suit gives me movie vibes 🤩
Im super excited for this but the graphics look kinda worse than miles morales. I hope I'm wrong  when it releases.
Im loving the vibrant city and the gliders, looks fun
Ever consistent things I've seen is only Video games, no movies, no shows, no comics. They leveled up everytime and bring back over the top emotions and thrill ❤
“Watch out for his NEW POWERS” Subtle 😂 can’t wait
Spider-man fans eating good this year
Venom is going to be nightmare.
Did anyone see how Pete threw the civilian on the ground after he saved him 11:32 😂
Love how amazing they show peters change in personality with the Symbiote suit
Game of the year, for me at least
this gameplay reminds me of the hunted storyline in the comics.
I had a feeling they would go with "Web of Shadows"-type combat with the black suit. This looks amazing.
This is EXCEEDED my expectations. Man! Just WOW. Beautiful!!!
I wonder is it before he met venom or after. If its the same as the movies. Then i assume he first got this symbiote and afterwards removed it and then venom was created
Hope it gets nominated for game of the year
This is definitely gonna be game of the year without a doubt
Bully maguire has return.
The Legend himself is finally back guys: BULLY MAGUIRE
Kraven looking BADASS!!!
The hype is strong with this one
Pete’s getting revenge on venom.
This gameplay hits so hard I can't wait until it releases
When the PS5 pro drop???
Spider Man 2 about to be my GOTY!
Peter Parker is Spider-Man.  Miles Morales is Miles Morales.  Any time spent away from playing as Peter is time not spent playing a Spider-Man game.
Use me as your excitement button
We... Are... VENOM!!!
Dont really like the design of the symbiote suit, but I'm still hyped!
I bet Prowler gonna die
I AM SCREAMING
As a spiderman fan we defo won the ps showcase
Hes gonna put some dirt in their eyes
Shame at points it looks like PS3 graphics
It kinda looks like they added pendulum swinging, I can't fully tell but if they did that's so hype
I hope there is a button to do the bully Mcguire dance And his suit
The suit is clean
We see that Yuri has become Wraith, as for gameplay it’s gonna be so fun playing as Symbiote Spider-Man and Miles with his extra abilities as well, and the gliding looks so clean as well as all the new takedowns, Sony you might as well just take my entire Wallet atp😮‍💨💯
Because Peter is using the symbiotie suit will we still be able to unlock new suits with different effects for him or no? Biggest question I got
Bout to be a War Between Zelda and Spiderman.
❤ I love you, Insomniac!!! ❤
I hope that we get a boss fight against black suit peter playing as miles that would be insane
not to be that guy but the venom attacks look weird?
This gameplay looks fire! Can't wait to get my hands on this!
Can’t wait to play this game , grade 12 by then hahaha
Os jogos anteriores esta mais bonito na moral esse gráfico gameplay não justifica sair so pa ps5 não da pra sair no ps4 tranquilamente
I never thought id hear the name "Connors" again
This will go down as one of the greatest comic book games of all time.
I NEED IT NOW 😮
OMGGGG
Peak 😂
So many things I wanted were revealed in this trailer! Just take my money already, take it!
I love how different it feels, a lot darker than the first game. The game of course looks phenominal too!
hype as hell
Absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! This looks better than the movies! I can’t wait to play :) ❤
The amount of hours I'm about to put into this game is about to be so crazy 😂
No mames, lo necesito ya.
If they drop a bundle for the ps5 with this game they taking all my money. This is incredible 😱
Pete vs Miles Final Boss fight
So disappointed 😓
This is gonna be amazingly
it looks like ps4 game I dont know didnt really impressed
REAL GAMING WILL ALWAYS WIN EVERYTIME
Happy they didn’t tone down symbiotic Pete and made him proper serious
Spider-Man Web Of Shadows 2:   THIS IS AMAZING!!!
Suit n gameplay look amazing n the scope of the game definitely looks higher than before
Man the nostalgia
HOLY CRAP this is so worth the wait! GAME OF THE YEARRR
Game looks great. What I think could be improved however, is the HUD. I'm not sure why the game is so yellow. Can't wait though
Thanks Insomniac! Looks amazing so far
game of the year already
I’m gonna have a F****NG BALL PLAYING AS THE SYMBIOTE!!!!!! I’m Playing this DAY 1!!!!…..better go buy a PS5 lol
Not feel next gen
Yea I’m hard
Finally finally finally after a lot spider man 2 is spectacular
This game is gonna get Game of The Year. I can already tell.🔥
Oh man that game play is so greater then I expected and the black suit so good I’m buying it right now
Kraven's Last Hunt hopefully being adapted to the movies and game
If Gerard butler can do a Russian accent he’d be my pick for kraven
This game bouta be so good
Peter boss fight incomin
hey did anyone else notice the spiderman web of shadows combo on Nintendo Ds he did at 3:11
I knew something was off with that David Obedami dude!!!
Giving me Naruto and Sasuke vibes after the curse mark
Everyone bitched about nothing being released about this game. Well here ya go.
The black suit Spider-Man he's back
Weee need that on ps4 plssss😢 plssssss😭😓I am begging you
This gameplay is beyond expectations. I was like what the heck how is this even possible. Sony truly pushes the boundaries as well as the developers. Insomniac went above and beyond on this. I can only imagine wolverine
Spider-man fans winning this year and we got into the spiderverse
WHAT A GAMEPLAY REVEAL! THAT SLAPPED!!! 🔥🔥🔥
I feel like it’s missing that cartoony good vibe but it’s still 🔥
Ok... i NEED a PS5 !
Miles watches dragon ball 😱
Peter with Bully Maguire mode
Can't resist the new symbiote suit. It's amazing 😊
🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷
Bro this game is gonna be so hard ⛽️🔥
i think spiderman is batman now
I can already tell this game is gonna have a Miles vs Peter fight with how the symbiote suit is
Mind is blown
The king has returned
Huge cope you can switch between red and black like in Web of Shadows.
CHRIST ALMIGHTY 😭😭😭
Yes babyyyyy
Slingshot? Less swinging Wing suit? Less swinging! Air tunnels??? Less swinging!!  I hoped that the game would be set in Manhattan... Instead, it's gonna be the river?  UI looks horrible tbh. The old one was great no complaints so why the change?
We as Spider-Man fans are simply eating like kings this year 👑
I think I need a minute to take in what I just watched
Im dying
Yuri giving an Award winning performance as always.
@Dantdm omg
THAT SYMBIOTE SUIT MY GOD IS AMAZING
Whole gameplay showcase was insane. Can't wait. Day one buy!
@2:40 & @3:12 , great look at some new moves taking out multiple enemies at once using the versatility of the symbiote, the gliding looks AWESOME !!!
SASUKEEEEE
I will call it right now the final boss of the game will be peter (it's so obvious) either that or in the final battle he stays on the bench and miles will fight
Peak incoming
Esta de la peeerra esta wea, totalmente decepcionante
Kraven the Hunter looks menacing😱😱
Spiderman is acting like that because he has the Orochimaru Curse mark. He will soon leave the village hidden in the Leaf!
Ok, this looks awesome, I’ve gotta buy this
PS3 Game graphics look at the water and buildings
Literally the only gripe I have with the reveal is that we didn’t see more webswinging animations. Everything else is amazing. I like how they’re incorporating Queens which means most likely brooklyn as well meaning we get to explore all of New York which is awesome, kinda reminds me of Ultimate Spider-Man where you start off in the suburbs of Queens. Another little detail that might be possible is how when Peter shifts into the symbiote, the model thickens then peels away to reveal the suit which makes me think that’s how the game will switch to different variants of the suit with the other bonus suits. Also anyone notice the bounce off the ground in air combat? Yeah, please someone make a nicholas cage godslap meme out of it.
this game is going to be so peak
No 4k  ????
Wow this looks oddly, average
FINALLY
Game of the year incoming
That is not the Lizard. That is the fricking Godzilla.
WOW BEST EVER
🕷️
Game mechanics is not satisfying. I prefer the same one from the previous games.
Love how the symbiote is changing him
Deadpol
Glider is goood
BIGGER PLAYGROUND?! NEW TOYS?! HEHEHEHEH.......
This game already looks unreal! I cannot wait to see what Insomniac has to offer this time!
not even gonna cap the symbiote suit sound goofy but like the swinging
AMBATUKAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMM
I’m ngl I’m not vibing with this suit design hopefully there’s better costumes but I LOVE the gameplay
Its a Day 1 for me!!!
Es cine
Get ready for another banger everyone.
YEAHHHHH
Yes the lizard is finally in the game I was hoping it was going to happen and I am glad I saw him
Meh, looks fine i guess. Just more of the same it seems.
I absolutely love this
Dude they already showed this much , i can’t even imagine what else they got going on
Man, He's serious. Symbiote already taking over or somebody's life on the line
Yo this looks amazing
2:27 Whoa!! The black suit is incredible
This is without a doubt one of the best gameplay reveals I’ve seen I cannot wait for this game to come out
The combat is crazy you can tell by peters voice as changed to evil and he says he does not want help from miles I say kraven gives me vibes from spiderman 3 when you look for Connors.
Why the game city look like Transformers on Wii?
It reminds me a bit like the Spider-Man 3 movie when Tobey Maguires Peter slowly starts to care less and less and in this you can see the anger and how he stops giving a f screaming at Kravens people and speaking to miles the way he was and the fact he just tossed that civilian across the floor idk how he gets the suit but i cant wait to find out but you can tell how much the symbiote changes him and how Miles starts to notice it when he says "hes never like that" and Peters all like "hes mine" you can tell this symbiote has really changed Peter and made him crazy and brainwashed exactly like Spider-Man 3 were he slowly starts to like and get attached to the suit and gets more angry and less caring everytime i love it its exactly how i imagined it
The voice acting and the gameplay. Both are top notch
Insomniac showed:  - new cutscenes - the symbiote suit - lizard, kraven, wraith - the ability to switch between miles and peter  - new mechanics (gliding) and new takedown animations   Definitely the best reveal from the showcase !
Web of shadows vibeeeesssss!!!
I didn't expect the wing suits from them. I hope they make the symbiote suit where you can switch back and fourth like Spiderman Web of Shadows
QUEEEEEEE
Jaws dropped 😮
MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
About time we got another look!
3:10 i think i orgasmed everywhere.......I'm so happy you have no idea
This is wild ❤
Chills
The Symbiote suit looks SOO GOOOD, I can’t wait till Fall!!!!!!
I totally nerdgazmed everywhere
SHEEEEEESH! FİNALLY!
I love how the made Peter aggressive and mean as he'll with that Black suit, you can hear the base in his voice.
This is awesome!!!!!!!!
THE FIRST YOU SHOW IS BLACK SPIDERMAN AND HIS POWERS ARE LIKE WOS OMGGGGG
I love the last game nd ion love a lot
Fun fact, this could easily be on PS4
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Too much Miles for my taste but still looks very good 👍🏻
AAAAHHH
Can’t wait to preorder this game 😊🕸️🕷️🤟🏻🙏🏻
Looks fire 🔥
where the 2160p at
Finally
Dawg I'm literally going to go bankrupt because I'm buying this as soon as pre-orders launch

That's an W for spiderman fans
Llllllzzz graphics
This game is gonna be amazing!
When will the game come out and when will it come to PC?
What amazing gameplay
Oh my....
Marvel really releasing Peak Spider-Man this Year
I love how Peter's pissed TF OFF! They be teasing us here... I see no HUD whenever Miles and Peter fight together. BUT SICK GAMEPLAY THIS GAME'S GONNA BE CRAZIER THAN THE OTHERS! 🥶🥶🥶
Miles really hit him with the kamehameha
This does not look next gen to me. I’m sorry but it doesn’t. Spider man ps4 showcase looked so much better than this.
Game of the Year!!!
Man Peter giving me bully maguire vibes lol
LITERALLY SCREAMING FROM EXCITEMENT
I absolutely love how the symbiote looks rough when it first bonds and then perfects itself
Im so hyped
I am speechless i can’t believe what I have jusr witnessed. This game looks like perfection
Niiiice
PSN showcase mehhhh  Metal gear Capcom game  spiderman 2 all good
is it just me or does the graphics look absolutely dogshit? the first one looked a lot better imo
The Trailer, The Transitions, The Gameplay> Absolute Masterpiece.
This is beautiful but I’m wondering if you can switch mid game
cills
Epic 🕷
Sasuke Spiderman
Wraith must show up at some point she was shown on the tablet let’s go
The symbiote really makes spidey scary, amazing 😄
Now dig in this
I wonder if the symbiot suit has other costume versions.
The graphics are kinda mid in comparison to the reveal trailer
Peak!!!!!
First view
Yuri Lowenthal is putting in the work! The man's gonna kill it once again!
Yay venom!
Game looks amazing
AAHHH!!! Sorry... I'm uh, overstimulating. I'm bout ta POP!
THIS LOOKS FANTASTIC. Crazy because this is actually one of the more low scale missions as well 😂🔥
Can't wait for this game playing as symbiote spider-man and miles will the best the gameplay is top tier it's Awesome  🤩🕷🕷👍🏾
Ultimate spiderman vibes
Y’all think Peter will be venom?? In the vid he says “so do I” after miles talks about lizards teeth
Finally🔥🔥
If this game wasn’t such an Arkham Clone then I think it would be better than Web of Shadows
The symbiote is back my favorite outfit series 🤍🖤
release for PC ok
Sasuke Symbiote Spiderman
Either this or TOTK is gonna win GOTY
Letsgo
Switching function from GTA 1
Everything i wanted 😭😭 can’t wait
Venom Voice sounds dope. It’s not forced and sounds like Peters Soul has been corrupted.
Need that 4k version
THAT WAS AWESOME 😩
Es real?????
This will be game of the year. 0 doubts.
GAME OF THE YEAR ALREADY
Nah fr finally a decent spiderman 👏 🙌  also this needs to have co op like me and my friemd can play together not on the same counsel or pc
W
One of if not the best MARVEL games ever!!, Just wish that there will be cameos of the avengers or any street level avengers like DareDevil, Wolverine, Luke Cage, etc. But I'm pretty sure that either Iron Man or Captain America might appear in this game, then maybe we'll get a tease for the upcoming Iron Man and  Captain America/Black Panther games, of which are the next most anticipated MARVEL games alongside with the new Wolverine game.
A mesma formula de sempre as vezes enjoa, muitos monstros, destruição, enfim Spider man tem muita história incrivel em hqs acho que poderiam adaptar de uma melhor maneira, enfim concerteza vai bombar e vai vender muito, mas me faz parecer ser só mais um jogo comum, nada demais, sem muito hype infelizmente ..  poderiam adaptar algumas engines semelhantes ao The Last of Us II que seria incrivel para qualquer jogo em primeira pessoa. Espero que a história continue sendo boa ..
I guess everyone likes the suit except me lol
Have to wait for pc launch 1 year again 😔
TAKE MY MONEY PLEASE‼️💰💵💸💴💳
The ultimate superhero game, one of the things which I've been looking forward to the most this year. Peter is looking absolutely VICIOUS.
Love the classic symbiote suit I'm so happy💗 I thought they would adapt it to the Advanced Suit
When you wanna reminisce on the good times in the next 5 years or so the comment section will be here with you..
Looks amazing
Obra maestraaa👌
Awesome gameplay.
This game is about to be revolutionary to the gaming industry
The lizards in the game
Jameson was right, Spider-Man's a menace rn, lock him up
Wraith design looks sick (it was showed in kraven’s tablet at 1:28
Yuri in the Symbiote suit sounds like angry Sasuke and I'm for it. His anger is incredible
The Symbiote, Kraven and the Lizard designs all look amazing! This game looks "spectacular"
I just made a huge load
AYOOOO THAT WAS SICK
This looks pretty bloody amazing in all honesty!!
IM BUSSIN
Así quedé cuando creí que no sacarían el trailer de Spiderman 2 🤡
POGGERS
This will 100% be worth the wait!!
Can't wait to play as both Peter AND Miles!!
Here before it really blows up

So excited
This game looks incredible.
Looks amazing wish it was compatible with ps4 so now I’ll have to upgrade
Dude imagine what wolverine ps5 gonna look like
Giving me "SHOCKERRR!!!!!!" vibes
Immediately goosebumps when that black suit appeared! 🫨
Miles is getting stronger with his bioelectricity, it turned blue than orange. I'm hoping this will last longer than Miles Morales game.
Awesome 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Finally i won't lose my mind when i open up r/SpidermanPS4

Will Spidey have his face from the PS4 version? :(

The Symbiote abilities are giving me so much web of shadow’s vibes it’s amazing
I really enjoy hearing yuri trying to sound like batman
Is this supposed to be an intro stage??? If so, that's a crazy way to start off!
GOAT
Peak
THE WAY I GASPED WHEN I SAW THE BLACK SUIT FOR THE FIRST TIME  I CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW HYPED I AM
Ничего не понял, но очень интересно
THIS WAS CRAZY!!!! 🕷🕷🕸⚡️⚫️
it’s gonna be crazy in 10+ years people are coming back to this
This symbiote suits looks really similar to the official concept art of Tom Holland's symbiote suit
3:15  i nut
Why the hell it looks like 2013 game?XD
Looks pretty average ngl
BROOOO THIS WAS HYYYYPEEEE
And Bully Maguire is back guys😂
Going to be game of the year easily.
The venom suit looks so good
Honestly i was expecting a lot more on the animation fedility department considering its a ps5 exclusive game.. The swing animations looks exactly same as the last two games. It will have good story ,set pieces and all that stuff but web swinging looked average.. I was fool to even think that the web swing will look almost like the movies.. mayb thats another 10 years away..  LOL
I hope they change his face
Dude, I almost clicked off when they started with the woods scene. Then I said sarcastically “Who is this, Kraven?!” Then he showed up and I lost it. 😂😂
Let’s goooooooo
game of the year
I like how spiderman talks while in the black suit he sounds angry and aggressive, like he should.
Man the goosebumps are just unreal I can’t even feel myself fam GAME OF THE YEAR WW GAMEEEE!!!!! 🔥🕷️🕸️
that was insane
Peter got symbiotic
The entire of point of the video was to say my pc is gonna explode
Ngl i was watching the showcase, saw the first scene and nearly closed it because I didn't realize it was Kraven
Im actually gonna bust
Te amo Sony
A common insomniac W
watched the whole PlayStation Showcase and waited till the end. it was worth it when they show Kraven, that's when i screamed  super excited for Marvel's Spider-Man 2!!!
This just moved to the top of my "Must Buy ASAP" list!
Thank you
They totally should do the bully Maguire dance
Peak game
Wait a second!
бляяяяяяяя😍😍😍😍
This is gonna be a great year for Spider-Man. First Across the Spider-Verse, and then Spider-Man 2? Oh this is gonna be amazing.
Te amo spiderman
They really had us in the beginning. Insomniac is the king of trolling, and also one of the best game developers. So excited for this!
You guys think Wolverine will make a cameo in the game?
i think the swinging needs to be a little faster
Just platinumed miles morales game cant wait gor this one 12:24
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ong!!!! Black suit!!! Gameplay!!
Bradley Cooper is Kraken?
Game gonna be so fye
Beautiful, absolutely stunning I can’t wait
Man Yuri really channelled his inner Sasuke here, love to see it 🔥🔥🔥
They can just take my money right now
Kraven hunting Conors just like spider-man 3 game
I am really disappointed, I waited five years for this game and it's basically a DLC, the gameplay looks the same, and even graphics don't seems to have improved, this game could easily be lauched on PS4 as well
This was SPYDER-FANTASTIC 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Masterpiece
1:33 looks like Black Cat and Yuri as Wraith are going to be in the game as well. This should be interesting.
here before it blows up
The game is fantastic. Best reveal. But only problem is the graphics look a little rough. Especially the water graphics.
Spider-Man was not playing around
So cool as hell from 2023
‼️‼️‼️
I can't wait to hear what Jonah has to say.
W
I want to act Spider-Man: Miles Morales in live action (a movie)
Whomever read this I pray that everyone is having abundant health in the Lord Jesus Christ name amen!
I was worried Peter wouldn't be as fun to play as Miles but clearly my worries were in vain. Can't wait for this
😻😻
This is the only spiderman game I wanted to buy, and It won't be on PS4
HYPE AND PEAK. I’m gonna need about ten versions of the black suit for this game. 😂
Impressive🔝🔝🔝😮😮😮
The way they've had Lizard shed skin and become more monster like, yuri's voice acting as a darker Pete...chills
I want to play Spider-Man: Miles Morales in live action (a movie)
I pray that everyone is having a blessed day and night so far in the Lord Jesus Christ name amen!
I'm already in love with this game I always wanted to play as both peter  & miles it's a dream come true.
IM ONLY BUYING A PS5 JUST FOR THIS
Bully Maguire is back baby! 😅
I need to act Miles Morales
PLEASE RELEASE THIS FOR PC QUICKLYY 🙏🙏🙏
I remember being amazed by the graphic of mario 64, look how far we've come, unbelievable....
Magnificent!
I really want to know the true indintity of spiderman
Day 1
Literally the combat gave me web of shadows vibes
ILL CHASE YOUU TO THE ENDS OF THE EEEARTH 😅
I need this game. Now
This looks amazing 😮‍💨🤙
What a time to be alive
Peak
FINALLYYYY
The BEST game of the year? Yes....is Spiderman 2.
The second I saw the Symbiote suit I clicked on the notif faster than ever before in my life
It’s been so long and my path has been so dark
im crying out of joy lol, so freaking amazing, cant wait for it to come out ^^
Looks so incredibly sick!! I’m so excited!!
Oh my god. FINALLY some gameplay!!! This looks so sick!!!
His voice and attitude being changed by the symbiote is incredible!
I swear if they don’t do the dance I’m not buying the game
genial
😂😂😂
LETS GOOOO
oh my gooooooooodddd can’t believe this is real!
I absolutely cannot wait
OMG I so hyped spider man 2 PS5. spider man with the black suit is so cool and awesome dr. Conners is so crazy but awesome I happy see miles morales this game is so cool I will get that game when it come out.
Dijeron gameplay y vengo a ver una película xd
Kraven stands no chance again Spiderman
Hope we can switch between the normal and symbiote suit at anytime
SO DO I!!!!
This looks like a completely new game thank you insomniac 🙏 Black suit looks amazing
Release date?
GAME OF THE YEAR 🔥🔥🔥
It seems as if the game is not over. There seems to be a drop in graphics. Does it feel like that to you too? 🙂
I need ps5
This is amazing but I AM PC PLAYERRR !!!
There just giving Peter the black suit off rip this is great
It's not that
Yuri Lowenthal sounds so RAW as Peter with the Symbiote suit
Marvel and insomniac games should take a note and see how Treyarch makes the green goblin boss fight.  1. Spidey confronts the green goblin with his glider. spider man swings using his web and swings very fast. as well as the green goblin with the goblin glider flying at full speed. spidey is swinging around shooting some web shooters, and spidey is trying to get close to the green goblin. The green goblin throws several pumpkin bombs which overwhelm Spider Man, the bomb explosion will deal a fatal wound to Spidey. and gobby doesn't just throw bombs, he still has other weapons to destroy spider man.  2.  second mode, the green goblin gets down from his goblin glider, he challenges spider man to hand-to-hand combat. Green Goblin physical strength is on par with Spider Man physique. and the second phase of the boss fight should be very difficult. green goblin uses martial arts techniques, while spider man uses parkour abilities.  if spider man is far from green goblin distance, gobby will throw pumpkin bomb to spider man. so did spider man shoot web shooter to green goblin. sometimes,  gobby will call his glider to attack spidey, and the green goblin can control his goblin glider during hand-to-hand combat.
Solved how you can swing through queens problem by giving them web wings.
I hope you get to fight venom Spider-man as Miles like Venom gets him angry and Miles tries to save/free him
I absolutely alien the black suit looks, ITS SOOOOO COOL AHHHH SO HYPED MAN
2:29 Wait....HANG ON THAT'S THE SOUND EFFECT THEY USED FOR THE BLACK SUIT IN WEB OF SHADOWS
Pfv mudem esse traje
This trailer was EPIC
Prototype 3 is looking pretty good
This is Amazing, no wait…. This  *SPECTACULAR*
It's awesomeee
Looking good so far
Just.. AMAZING
Insomniac: This should shut y'all up for a few months...
Amazing
I like how they added peters house and old school. Reminds me of the ultimate Spider-Man game with the venom fight at the school.
Developers fix the black spider costume, it looks terrible, what kind of nonsense? Are you having an artists' strike?
Bro is pissed
I haven’t been this hyped since god of war Ragnarok😭🙌🏾
Take my money now
that was amazing
Can't wait anymore, when is coming ouuuttt?
This is insane!!!
This game is gonna be amazingggg!!
Me trae muchos recuerdos de Web of Shadow, a quien mas le trae esos recuerdos????
BE GREATER. TOGETHER. 🕷
This video alone was better than Tears of the Kingdom! You can already tell that this is going to be Game of the Year just like the first game 🙌
The symbiote suit reminds me of the web of shadows Spiderman suit.This game looks absolutely beautiful. I can't wait to pre order.
Miles: he's got big teeth  Peter: so do I.  A darker and angrier peter will be fun Can't wait for venom tho
😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤🥳🥳🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Beautiful. I don't blame them for taking their time, it came out amazing!
No 1440p or 4K Quality? Darn.
Kraven, Lizard and Venom as villains in the same game. This is so hype, and probably means they're saving Goblin for the final game of the trilogy. Super excited. A classic battle between Peter and Green Goblin to finish the first trilogy of games feels like a perfect ending.
Game looks absolutely fantastic, but given all the new tools that the player seems to get, here's hoping it isn't a walk in the park like the previous games were even on the hardest difficulty
u can see on that iPad that kraven was looking at that prowler black cat and taskmaster are maybe coming back
It's time for the era of BULLY LOWENTHAL!
Gliding finally !!
👍 gracias por este video de este avance de Marvel spider-man 2
Solo espero que en el juego no metan influencers a hacer las voces
will it be 60fps?
Omg Peter has the symbiote
*"GET BACK HERE KRAVEN!! I'LL CHASE YOU TILL THE ENDS OF THE HEEEEART!!!!"*
Is it just me or do the graphics in the Spider-Man park look a bit underwhelming but also they look amazing in the kraken part. Seems a bit strange
I can’t wait to hear the origin story for this and I hoped for these new Mechanics: is it too early to call it love?
Just saw it on the full showcase and I loved it so much
What did this man Kraven do to Peter bruh 😭
I'm so ridiculously excited for this game I can't wait
game of the year
Epic!!!
People had overhyped Hogwarts Legacy when its showcase was revealed. Let's not do the same with Spider-Man 2.
The gameplay graphics look like a ps3 game
I can't be the only one that thought they were gonna end the reveal after the kraven part😂😂😂
Am I the only one who heard Bungie's composer work in the beginning?
25/05/2033 ?
Oh MAN! This looks amazing! Cant wait to come back to this video in like 12 years to get nostalgic lol
Let's goooo!
black suit spidey a meance
There is no way the bully Maguire dance is not in this.
5:00 now Miles is a super Saiyan
The web-swinging hasn’t even been improved or redone it’s still the same wtf
OMG this game looks so fkn good
Yes yes yes !!❤❤
WEB WINGS!!!!
It's looking yummy
This so dope had to watch it again. I can’t wait to preorder
is that dead pool on the map
Can’t wait to play it on YouTube
I’m so keen for this!
The graphics, voice acting, score, everything looks amazing!!
WE EATING GOOD
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
The gameplay looks sick
I have Xbox :(
My guess is miles and Peter fight at some point in the game
This game looks crazy. Im super excited for this to come out.
That's all I needed tbh. I'm not watching anything else until the game is out and I can play!
WORTH THE WAIT
Actually everything i asked for 🥲
Finally 😁
THIS WAS AMAZING, SPECTACULAR,SENTSATIONAL, ULTIMATE EVEN.🕷🕷🕷🕷🕸🕸🕸🕸
I’m gonnna squirt
Me: this is going to be awesome  Bully parker: u have no idea 😈 2:31
OMG, I'm speechless. The world looks absolutely amazing and so large. It's just beautiful and the new swinging and gliding mechanics are just omg. The black suit mhmm. Kraven Ooooh... This game is one big fat wet nerdgasm and I can't wait to get my hands on it!
Ok so Kraven Lizard and the Symbiote Suit revealed. This just gets me more excited
YESSIR GOTY
Ps5 exclusive?
Soundtrack, excellent. Models, excellent. This game gonna be a W!
Yeeeeeeesss
Peter on demon time
This combo was nasty 3:10
Does anyone else see that the animations seem somewhat slower or is it just me? They've kept a lot of the same swinging and combat animations but they seem like 20% slower now. It's most noticeable at the Peter combat section in the start. Also something is off graphically and I can't quite point out what, i think mostly the lighting seems quite unfinished. Everything else is amazing and I'm sure they'll polish these things till release 💙
Let’s gooooooo
Please God, let Venom be Eddie Brock and not Harry
Marvel keeps making great game to play
I NEED IT IN 4K
GOTY
12 minutes of Peak ! So excited for this game to drop 🎉
Going insane, this game is going to make me UNBEARABLE FOR YEARS TO COME
Hi me after 5 years, how are you?
Petey's angry and I am here for it
Kraven is a boring villain to me I want the green goblin but not some green goblin in a power ranger outfit I want him to be the green goblin from the 70s but with a goblin mask that attracts  to his face  like jim in the movie the mask
Honestly, I don't think this game is gonna live up to the hype. Literally expected more out of this. The way information leaked about fabulous cutscenes like animation and all that stuff, i don't see any of that here.
❤❤❤❤
THE WEB LINE OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!
The way Peter just tossed the person he rescued shows just how strange he’s acting cause of the symbiote…
This is where the fun begins
Awesome….. MCU should learn ❤❤❤❤
THIS WILL BE G.O.T.Y
Gonna love using the venom suit a lot!
Zelda just lost every chance it had of getting game of the year, this just looks beyond incredible wtf
this moves me, This DEFINITELY MOVES ME. Can't wait
🔥🔥🔥
hyped aint the word!
This is gonna get game of the year
I was here random time traveller from 2028
Wow very so beautiful 🥺❤️
Man peters personality change is one thing I want to see and it brings me back to the days of web of shadows also Miles being able to shoot lightning from his fingers and the ability to switch characters I love this game already
without silver sable in part 2 i guess?
Bruh we havent seen Queens since Ultimate and havent played as Symbiote Spider-Man since Web of Shadows, i'm SO EXCITED!!!
What a great time to be alive My only regret  us I could rewatch this again for the first time man that was lit
THIS WAS INSANE 🤯 cant wait for this game to release. To future me”hope you are enjoying this game 😭”
Hopefully as the game progresses the symbiote changes the suit from just a black suit to the symbiote we know and love
What a W
Legendary gameplay from Sony to start it out with the Venom Outfit. ❤️‍🔥
merece todo este juego un premio
This is dope
Did I watch a complete different video than others? This game looks awful. It looks like a version for ps3 at the end of its life. I was so hyped but unfortunately the only what I got, was an enormous disappointment 😖
I love the Black suit. This is going to be so much fun.
Oh my goodness this looks so Badass !! can't wait to play this 😅
I just have one wish from this game. Let us switch between the normal and black suit like Web of Shadows let us. From the combat, I can see they were greatly inspired by WoS and that is a huge plus. I hope there is more to it. This looks insanely good, I cannot wait to experience it!
?the new spider man wiil be avaible to ps4
Once you really got the moves down, Spiderman was such an incredibly fun game. Easily one of the top games I'm looking forward to
Dijeron a fin de año pero no dijeoron si sera para ps4 o ps5 me dejo con la curiosidad
Bully Maguire
Couldn’t be happier with this. Only thing I’m a little iffy on is the UI, mainly during combat
W
This looks amazing ❤❤
Spider-man como siempre cargando el peso de ser la mejor franquicia de Playstation
Goty
I just had a nerdgasm
The gameplay looks sick! Looks more revolutionized compared to the first game.
Bruh black suit spider-man sounds exactly like Sasuke. Good old yuri lowenthal avenger mode.
Symbiote Peter Vs Miles 👀
Also the design of the Symbiote Suit...SO SIMPLE but so COOL It reminds the Ultimate Symbiote Suit design mixed with the Classic Symbiote design!!! THAT'S AWESOME!!!!
ENFIN DU GAMEPLAY !
That was beautiful
Spider man 2 looks freaking sick as hell
definitely didn't like the black suit appearance really not the face or anything about it. it looks like spiderman is in a robot suit. a lot of the gameplay shown in spiderman 2 is the same as it was already years ago I didn't like the combat I thought they would do a little more but they didn't seem like they did I kinda expected better. The combat in original ultimate spiderman PS2 game feels better. It's even worse now that I remember they changed the original actor. I'm a Little disappointed
GAME OF THE YEAR calling it now
The fact that it won't be Bubniak's face this time makes me so mad💔
I'M SQUEALING LIKE A LITTLE GIRL!
Ps4?
Everyone towards Insomniac rn: THATS WHY HES THE GOAT
Let's gooooo 😁😁🔥💯
Ohhhhhhhhhh
The final person in kravens  list is shocker
W RAAAAAAA
You Nailed That showcase Insomniac games. Well done. loved It. LOOKING forward to Spiderman 2
Finally here!!!
goty broo this trailer hard asf
Amazing
This legitimately made me bust!
FINALLY!!!
already goty
Dude u can tell the symbiosis is making Peter evil
It just gets better and better. I can’t wait to play this game!
Should've had a release date but looks amazing so far.
would have wanted to see less venom and more peter stuff with his normal suit
Nothing too crazy it seems cool
Insomniac Games doing God's work. ❤ 🕸  playing this games soon as it releases Day 1 😊
Only critique i have is to fix water physics
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS
Looks really awesome, but also some spoilers... or this is like first few minutesnof the game?
They should change the interface ASAP, cmon it looks really bad especially this pixel glowing heart on Miles's interface
Omg
No Words can describe my hype, I cannot believe this... I'm in love..
Definitely excited for this game
And I’m assuming venom in this one?
🔥🔥🔥
I have no doubt that this game will become GOTY
I see a lot of problems with the game , frame rate is messy, lot of draw distance issues, no cap is everywhere, textures rendering is a mess ....I also hate that we are now forced to use miles morales I'm going to have to pass....look every body 2 spidermen and u to could be spiderman it makes peter less special
😍😍😍😍😍
Really need a ps5 right about now
Thanks, this made your showcase a instant 11/10, still waiting on these Wolverine thou lol
The Suit is so shitty, why it seems agent venom?
This trailer just convinced me to buy a PlayStation tbh
Man, the suit and gameplay with the symbiote look INSANE! Cant wait! Also excited for them to explore Peter's dark side with them adapting the symbiote saga. Also really excited to see Kraven and what his involvement in the story will be. It looks like he'll be hunting down everyone in New York with superpowers, Spidermen and their villains, which will be extremely interesting.
wraith reveal, kraven and peter unhinged, big lizard eating through the city, harry STILL dying, and miles in the middle…  this is a historic game frfr
RIP Xbox
I knew this game would be pretty but wow!! Its actually stuning!!
*checks watch* Yep time to splooge *OOOOOHHHH!!!!*
I'm buying PS5 just to play this game
My only complaint is that we didn’t get to see Peter swing and fight that much.
Took too long no interested
idc, just take my money
GOTY INCOMING
Just wow
Already buying this over 2k  Edit: I hope Screwball don’t make a comeback
It’s everything I wanted from a sequel
Shut up and take my money
GAME OF THE YEAR I CAN JUST TELL!!!!!!!
We're doing Kraven's Last Hunt. LETS GO!!!!!!
GOTY no debate
I wish they put that on Xbox one
LOVE the reversal at the start🔥🔥
THE. SYMBIOTE. SUIT. 🎉🎉🎉
ben!
No 60 FPS?
I love you insomniac
Is it real or fan made....bcoz how could anyone reveal gameplay so much early...can anyone plz tell me
Dang kraven is huge 👀🔥 Also i really like how spider-man uses the symbiote in this too 💯
Did they ever have the car surf in the other games?
INSOMNIAC, TAKE MY MONEY FOR THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION!
LEEETTTSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This looks like everything I could have imagined, man. Both characters playable, new skill sets for both, exciting story, MAN. This is a pre order for sure I never preorder games these days.
This made that whole PlayStation showcase worth it!!!
Oh my God
They glide?!?!?!!!
I love yuri's aggressive tone when he has the symbiote on
How could they have topped the first Spider-Man on ps4 I thought?  This gameplay reveal completely SHATTERED all of our expectations for what a sequel could be. Can’t wait to dive right in.
Supes where you at buddy
I'm so excited spiderman ps4 is one of my favorite games I'm so excited for this to come out
The amount of times i watched this gameplay is unhealthy…🥵
Wonder if We will get the Green Goblin,Mysterio,Sandman and The Jackal!
FINALLY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
I was waiting for Bloodborne like ANYTHING from it.  But I have to say that I'm satisfied with this cause it's look amazing!
Finally they use the web differently
Web of shadows 2 vibes!
Game of the year I won't take a no for answer
This looks so good,insomniac has done an amazing job.definitely buying this day one
Not veryuch different from the first game. I expected more
YEEEEES! YES! YES! YES! ALL OF THE BIGGEST YESSES! SPIDER-MAN 2! LET'S GO!
I NEED IT NOWWWWWW
This looks like is gonna be better than the one on gamecube
Esto es real ?
Emiliano huerta templos
I’m so speechless
Omg Spider-Man black
LETS GOOO
Hell yes.
Those Tentacles 🐙
I'M DEFO GONNA PRE ORDER THIS
who else’s jaw dropped seeing that black suit on Peter
Cant wait for this!!! Looks spectaculary good!
Da pra sentir a raiva na voz do peter
I almost cried when I saw the web wings
Omg this is gonna be so great
Looks great but really not a fan of the new UI during combat. Black suit is cool though,although cant help but feel his mask is a bit empty-looking?
Game of the year and it hasn’t even came out yet 🤯
Where is the graphic gap ? This gameplay is great bu the graphism aren't that exiting... Nothing new compared to Mile Morales... I hope it gets better at lauch.
im gonna be honest this was very underwhelming. i expected more when they didnt tell us anything for almost 3 years. graphics look worse than the reveal trailer, yuri is over doing it tbh. idk what i expected. but this aint it
The next GOTY
Now that's a dlc
Yuri really channeling his inner Sasuke for this black suit arc
Game looks amazing🔥
Cannot wait for when the Green Goblin shows up in this universe! Insomniac can do no wrong!
Game of the MF YEAR RN IM CALLING IT
The map is a lot bigger from what it looks like which is awesome
Game looks like a movie dawg 😭🔥🔥🕷️
SO GOOD
Yuri Lowenthal really nailed in Peter's change and personality under the symbiote's influence.  Should we be concerned for Peter?
I thought it was Turok at first tbh
More than I could have ever imagined, I am preordering this as soon as it’s available
Game of the year already 😂
Dawg Peters combos are ruthless here—
Hope we get to play as actual venom and not just the symbiote on spiderman, “ultimate Spider-Man” did it perfect we could play as venom even eat people lol. Even if it’s just as a mission would be alright, better than not at all…
I really hope Black Cat plays an important or some role in this game because as we know everytime Peter gets his hands on the symbiote suit stuff start to happen between them  The gameplay is also incredible and I am extremely excited to see Venom Lizard and Kraven
Man the black suit... I love it looks AMAIZING! can't wait to see Venom!
As soon as I heard the name Sergei knew what it was
Its definitely amazing just gotta work the tendril mechanic it feels a little bit flimsy
the spidey grind
Game of the year
THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!!!!!!! NICE! SO EXCITED
Looks like a mobile game 😂
BOTH PETE AND MILES GOT WEB WINGS… OR GLIDER WINGZ EITHER OR ITS 🔥🔥🔥
WE'RE EATING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDD
This is the only game worth playing... I can't wait 😊
Nah the fake out during the showcase was crazy I was getting ready to be disappointed but then I realised it was Kraven🤩
this si the return of Bully Maguire
Now Peter can finally have the exaggerated swagger of a black teen.
HELL YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
MASSIVE W
Honestly this was the only thing who kept me in this showcase
Yes🎉
BANGER
Fireeeeee
Игра года сто процентов
Can’t wait
Most likely game of the year
LET'S GO
Who else got mad because thought that it isnt spiderman?  Also really great trailer 🔥
Pre order ?
i thought this was far cry
Be greater. Together🔥
Straight up 🔥
Am......😉😉😉😉
fire bro insom release nun but bangers
We as Spider-Man fans won with this
OOOOOOOOOOO
Esto está a otro nivel !!
Naaah this is GOTY
The black suit look like a mod
I really hate than Ganke and miles say their names out in the open like that despite knowing that there are several of Kraven’s men around and they don’t know if they are listening or not.
Game of the year already 😮‍💨
THIS IS CRAZY
INSANE!
"He is going to wish , he never came to New York." 🔥🔥🥶
That wingsuit tho
No wolverine?
They gave us everything
W SPIDERMAN CONTENT
One of the best reveals I've ever seen.   If they're revealing the Symbiote suit this early, guess what more they have to show in the game...   Can't wait
I hope there is a more classical version of the black suit, not a big fan of this weird "plated" look. Everything else though looks amazing.
2:04 the skip button
Dios,que increíble ❤
Don’t look graphically much better than the first one which is kinda dissapointing considering it’s meant to be like ps5, same thing happened with Jedi survivor
WE ARE BACK
Finally 🙌🏼😭
I’m preordering this. Because I have 100 percent trust that thi will blow my mind
Wow, this looks amazing! I can’t wait to play it!! Spider Man is one of my top PS4 games.
Omgg bully maguire
Cant wait to fight peter as miles!!!
GAME OF THE YEAR. WAY BETTER THAN TEARS OF THE MIDDOM
Bro game looks amazing can’t wait to play it

There's no way this game isn't an absolute banger
Take my money NOW!!
Game of the year🎉
HELL YESSSS🙌🙌🙌🙌
Finally
10/10 love seeong spidermans venom suit that was an amazing comic run
Reminds me of Web of Shadows. It also looks like Peter has a new set of skills and combat when using the symbiote
LETS GOO!!!! COVERING A BREAKDOWN!
I COULDN'T BREATHE THROUGH THIS ENTIRE THING IT'S AWESOME
Including queens and brooklyn and instant switch between the two heroes is beyond awesome!
Spider Man 2(D Water)
WTF HARRY FINNA DO
I can’t wait playing games this!!!
The game had me creaming in so many ways and voice acting too
I’m having Bully Maguire flashbacks
Got me at the first half during the showcase not gonna lie.  I thought it was a whole different game.  Also, there was a lot to unpack there!!! We got the Venom suit!!! Peter and Miles can glide now!  We get to see a glimpse of the lizard!!!! And it comes out this year!!!!
Literally everything i wanted and hoped would be in it
Game of the year
Best game this year, 100% ❤❤
The abilities of this Symbiote Suit reminds a LOT of the ones from the Spider-Man Web of Shadows' Symbiote Suit!!!!
This gameplay looks great
Now... PS5 NOW
I can't wait!!! Fall 2023 can't come fast enough
The game had me creaming in so many ways and voice acting too
FINALLY!!!!!!!
Letsss gooooo
I can’t wait
Lessssssh Gooooo!!!!❤️🔥
Looks like web of shadows 2.0 with the miles morales gameplay upgraded!
Просто супер люблю человека паука
We won Mr. Stark 😢
Nah black suit is fire🔥🔥
Hype levels through the roof
Yuri Lowenthal is doing such a great job showing Spider-Man’s aggression because of the Black Suit…
Tbh, the animations like the swinging and others look very much still in development… hope they improve on it soon.. let it cook
YES! YES! FINALLY IM CRYING OH MY GOD!
Hell yea!!!
😍😍😍😍 ITS PERFECT
This look better then miles morales
When there’s no matt murdock😔
YEEES ! OH YEAH BABY
Peter's pre-Venom suit voice is way off...
2:24 I yelled so loud at this reveal. I dr was like, "OFF RIP THERE SHOWING THE BLACK SUIT?!"
In my opinion, the only sad part is that they never got the chance to show us the actual "evil" part of Venom or Green Goblin. Also, if you were paying close attention to the map of New York in the beginning, they showed a bunch of people like Black Cat, Prowler, WRAITH, Tombstone, the two main spider man, Lizard, Taskmaster, the Sinister Six, and the Shocker.
I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG OH MY GOD
Symbiote suit🔥🔥🔥 combos and everything
This looks absolutely amazing. I can't wait for this game.
I hope we play as venom
Yes 💙❤❤❤
Nevermind this looks great as hell!
where coop?
I’m gonna preorder this game
Bully Lowenthal is here…🕷
I literally got chills when Miles said no he's never like that...
Game of the century
This bout to be one of the best games of all time🙌🏾
I’m buying the collectors edition
Bro this gameplay footage was phenomenal, Insomniac out did themselves once again. Can’t wait🔥🔥🔥
This is only the Gameplay Reveal, and my mind is absolutely blown. Love how Peter is being corrupted by the symbiote. It perfectly matches with Kraven.
It's for pc?
Showing the symbiotic straight up pretty Ballz w
Finally 🙏
This is going to be game of the year without a doubt, looks BEYOND AMAZING
Yuri Lowenthal killing this role wirh the black symbiote
Man they built upon the last games so well along with I can already tell they took some things from web of shadows
Dude the black suit looks awesome
So Yuri does become Wraith
LIZARDS SKIN FLAKES OMG🥴😫
Выглядит потрясно!
IM SO HYPED
The Symbiote is changing Peter!
I need this Now in this moment😍😍😍 I love it can't wait for this masterpiece
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤌🏿
Amazing speed man
Absolutely stunning. Truly Hyped for this.
What a gameplay sequence but I’m not sure I like this version of the symbiote suit but it makes sense for the version of the suit they got in the game
Absolutely lovely 💯
Was anyone else worried when they saw bro in the forest? I sighed a breath of relief when Kraven showed up lool.
I'm going to cry bro this looks awesome
The graphics and mechanics look so cool , I can’t wait for this game
DAYUM
Graphics look like shattered dimensions from ps3 lol. Hope this is not the final product?
WE ARE VENOM
🕸10/10 🕸
Omggggg
Peter is on his Sasuke arc.
Black suited Spider-Man let's go
Okay this is incredible
Wow, dropping us right in the hot seat with the black suit.
It will be good
THEY DONE DID IT AGAIN!!!!!!
Game of the year confirmed ❤❤❤
batman arkham is way better
🔥🔥🔥
Another PlayStation W
NOO WAAAYY AMAZINNGG
BRO THE “SO DO I😲”
That symbiote suit gameplay was fuckin wild
Just looks the same. Bit disappointed
This looks so good omg
Best birthday present ever 🥺
I was hoping the symbiote combat would be more visceral and heavy. Still looks really cool
Thats alot of swagger
I am so hyped for this game I loved the first one and miles morales so I cannot wait for Spider man 2 🤩🤩🤩🤩
This game look absolutely amazing, that was epic 🎉
Peak incoming
Miles gameplay was insane !!! Black suit  was cool but miles is broken !!!
Looks awesome.
This is amazing.
THEY COOKED
when  it going to come out
The combat is as I predicted amazing but the character movements how they move Peter still moves like someone who has had year's to perfect his skills and Miles like someone who is improving overtime. Also the storyline. The minute Peter cut Miles off was the minute I knew something was off about him. The only question is this Peter just upset over the situation in general (we know that Harry is sick) and the symbiote just fueling that? Or is this symbiote just making Peter this aggressive
New goal of my life
Thank you Sony for finally blessing us with more than TWO PICTURES of this game!
I don't like the symbiote suit
Bro Peter is extracting his Bully Maguire energy. And this will no doubt be Game of the year
Oh miss brant, give me a ps5.
Symbiote Spider-Man is finna go crazy
Really hoping this game is on the ps4 otherwise i guess i have to buy a ps5
RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH LESGOOOOOOOOO
BRUUHHHH OMMMGGGG IM IN LOVEEEEE
Is it just me or the graphics look off!??
And now u hungry rats can see why this took so long to reveal
Can't wait for Fall 2023
This looks sick i am blown away by the venom gameplay the way you can take down multiple enemies at once is wow
That's great. Marvel games are always good when it comes to graphics, and I respect the enthusiasm, always!!👏✨
😮😮😮
Now THIS is how it's done.
This gameplay just made me want to buy the game already ❤🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🫡🫡🫡🫡🥰🥰 i can wait!! Story
OK! IM GOING TO BUY PS5 RIGHT NOW!
LOOK AT THE NEW SILENT TAKE DOWNS
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Amazing 🎉🎉🎉🎉 I love thisss
2:30 Wow. Just Wow 😮
The map looks huge af it must be all of nyc and new jersey and statan  island
Perfection.
I seriously hope insomniac can build a universe with this and the Wolverine game, the whole first bit in the forest gave me HUGE wolverine vibes
FINALLY
I really hope they do the symbiote a little better ‘cause it looks as solid as a tree branch and the eyes too, I’d rather he have them tiny-wide squinted eyes with no pixel edges.
Already outscaling Arkham batman
I was hoping for a preorder date and the release date
This is insane 🔥🔥
Loving how angry Yuri sounds in this. The suit also looks incredible!
I love it
bruhj
Looks like the last Spider-Man game but with new mechanics. Looks like PlayStation ain’t getting another goty anytime soon
cannot wait for this to come out
HYPEEEEE !!
Lots of candidates for GOTY. This is one of them
I really wished this was on Xbox it'll only be ok pc and playstation
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOO!!!!
Dawg
Oh hells yes I can’t wait to play this
OMG!!
Graphics look really bad compared to the first game and Spiderman Miles Morales
are you guys on some drugs or these are bots? This does not look good especially for Next Gen Graphics. 3/10 unimpressed
This game is going to be 🔥
man, animal lover looks good😂😂😂😂
LETS GOOO
Omfg
WE HAVE QUEENS NOW
No siento mis piernas don cangrejo🥳
Be Together.
Holy freaking crap. Insomniac has done it again.
September can't come fast enough
When does the actual trailer come out?
uh, why do the visuals look worse than the first game? o.o  also that entire sequence was way too scripted, full of QTEs and cuts to cinematics... that's not good. Would've rather seen more open-world stuff/actual gameplay mechanics and how they are aiming to improve things there, cause it needs to expand on what the first game did and not just be more of the same.
It is the same game from 2018 XD
This looks amazing so far. We get to switch between Peter and Miles, we get to see the Lizard, Kraven, and we got the Symbiote suit! I can't wait to pre-order this!
BE GREATER TOGETHER!
bro turned into sasuke💀💀
This is the best game of the Year, confirmed!  🤤🤤🤤
Nyc💥
Gliding looks amazing
FIRE
GAME OF THE YEAR. HERE. I SAID IT

This game better be game of the year!
Best graduation gift ever
I need a PS5! RIGHT!! NEOW!!!
I'm still waiting poppy play time 3 and security Breach. Ruin
The wait was well worth it after seeing this
you can tell the venom is really getting to him by his voice
Fighting with the Black Suit reminds me of Web of Shadows.
improve the black suit
IM SO HYPED 🕷🕸
*gameplay looks amazing but i dunno why it looks less realistic than the last two games*
SYMBIOTIC INVASION INBOUND  IT IS UP TO MILES TO NOT ONLY SAVE THE CITY, BUT PETER AS WELL
I love this game already!
im a bit disappointed in the swinging there is no new tricks but the rest looks sick
GAME OF THE YEAR
THIS LOOKS SO GOOOD AAAAAAAH CANT WAAIT
This is going to be the best Spider-Man game ever ❤️❤️❤️
Get my moneyyyyyy!
Already Day 1 🤟🔥🔥🔥
My god this was peak and on my graduation day that’s one hell of a reveal
Thank you Spider-Man for saving the PlayStation showcase
Spider-Man 2 looks  awesome  to play  can't wait to play  it when it comes out
Peter becoming more mad is so cool and might fight miles
Game of the year
make a light Version of the game for PS4 😢
Goty
Miles will have to fight Peter, Venom will come off, go onto Harry and Harry will join forces as Venom with Kraven.  You heard it here first!
THIS LOOKED SO GOOD
That Black Suit, its AMAZING
From Bully Maguire to Bully Parker, we've come long way
Incrível
The Symbiote suit looks sick!! Giving me Web of Shadows vibes!!!🕷️🕷️🕷️
Oh my god this is amazing the combat is even better the new powers for miles are insane also Kraven the Hunter the black suit lizard this is going to be absolutely Mayham and we haven’t even seen venom yet
Okay Yeah ps5 come to daddy!!!
Gameplay looks amazing! Definitely gonna be lots of sick day call outs at work when it comes out
SPIDERMAN FANS ON TOP.
Be Greater. Be Yourself. Together.
LOOKS AMAZING (pun intended)
pretty good for some dlc on psplus
Game of the year incoming.
I want to pre-order already
Amazing
What a time to be a Spider Man fan
This looks so good! Too bad they didn’t share an exact release date tho. I already knew it’s coming out in fall 2023, and if it’s coming so soon, why don’t they know when it’s coming?
THIS IS AMAZING I AM SAVING UP FOR A PS5 RN!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
goty, easily
Game of the year
Simply awesome !!
BRO I'M HYPED
he’s just like me bro
hopefully the pc wait isn't too long
The year and a half wait was worth it 😭😭😭😭😭
Looks SO good. Pumped for this Fall!
Water effects should be worked on.
- You sure ? He's got big teeth ! - So do I !  Can't wait !
Now all we need is for Peter to dance walking down the street
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bro that was FCKING INSANE!!!!!!!!!
Idk how I feel about this. It’s not what I was expecting at all. I am a bit disappointed by the amount of reused animations. Also the hud and the the voice lines are almost child like. I can’t take anything seriously😕
too much gameplay, its like they showed whole mission.
Lets gooooo. Waiting for this to come out as soon as possible
🤠🔥🔥
I just want new swinging animations and the ability to swing lower to the ground without that weird floaty thing😭
This game looks just fantastic. Really a large step up from the last
This will be one of the best games.
La maxima expresion de como mejorar algo, que parecia insuperable.
FINALLY🥰🥰🥰🥰
Oh my god
BLACK SUIT LOOKS SO DOPE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
That so do i  Hit different 🤣
This looks amazing, for everyone complaining about water graphics they have until fall 2023 to fix them
Peter vs Miles ?
This is something else
This looks like everything everyone who’s ever played a Spider-Man game has ever wanted.
So we just watched game of the year
Venom symbiote is quite crazy in this
Just let me pre order already take my money
VAMO CARALHO SUDUDIDJDJ
Imagine the End Credit scenes of this game show us the Multiverse that the Spiderman Miles Morales into the Spiderverse  take place 👏🏽👏🏽
They're totally doing their own mix of Alien Costume Saga, Kraven's Last Hunt and the 2020 Hunted story from the previous ASM run. Love Yuri Lowenthal's Black Suit voiceover as well. It's perfect.
The gameplay looks good but it's so ugly
Now THAT’s what I’m talking about. Especially Peter going full Sasuke with his Venomized personality.
LEEEEEESSS GOOOOOO
Incredible Spider-Man 2 can't wait  black Suit. Is cazry
I was hoping for a spider gwen reveal but ill take symbiote peter too
FREAKING AWESOME!!
Man looks epic plz com on ps4
I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY AS SYMBIOTE SPIDER-MAN! 🕸️
God that symbionts suit looks so good, I’m hyped on how venom is gonna look
I love the fact that they can glide now in this game
Tenth
YESSSIR SPIDERMAN 2 LETS GET IT
Looks amazing
When DOES IT COME OUT
If they made a spider-verse type of game for a 3rd game, that would be I.N.S.A.N.E.
LETS GOOOOO
Spiderman is going to be a boss
🔥🔥🔥
The only thing good we got
Okay... now i NEED a ps5!!!
GAME OF THE YEAR
