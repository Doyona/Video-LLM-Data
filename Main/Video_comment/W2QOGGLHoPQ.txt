9-6 ldn
9-7 win
6-5 LDN is my guess
I want Dillon back pls
Great performance in the second half. Totally agree with Ashkan, you guys need to okay 2 touch football more because you destroy teams when you do that and remain patient. Such a good team apart from that clown of yours who came onto the court following the yellow for the keeper. Should honestly boot thay guy from the team, hes a mug.
I think the score will be 9-6     I got it correct
LDN
7-5 but the other team

5 - 9 TO LDN
21:54 did anyone see that
Good game 👏👏👏
The football quality is great but I feel like the video production needs to improve since you're getting 1M+ views.  If you watch Manny and his UTR sunday league videos, the production is quite good. Having your commentary lined up before the video so you don't miss or talk over goals and replaying key moments and questionable decisions. Also, not drinking/talking about other topics as the game is going on would help bring up the quality. Maybe cutting cutting and editing the video when you need to take a drinks break etc. would make the video flow better.  That's my opinion anyway.  Keep up the great content!
9:7 win!!!
P😊
3-2 to LDN
Nez is trying to flex his Apple Watch so bad 😂😂

Yo guys ik this isnt unrelated to the video but i need a bit of help irl tho on my football, like irl im a good visioner and i can make very clean passes when i find them and i am like the tallest player in my squad (6'0 at 15) but i really struggle dribbling wise cause im very clumsy and unbalanced, can anyone give me tips on how to improve at all?
i think it finishes 6-5 LDN!
i say its gonna be 9 6 for you guys
i hope you guys beat southampton and their best player is their number 13 so if you like target him he wont be able to do anything

As some one who always have played 1 division lower than the Eredivision ( pro competition ) Its amazing to see these videos.. but let make one thing clear  i can see that its a high level futsal but this isnt like premier league stuff right? ..  its like similiar to my league noh? and close to an like rrally close a professional league.. or is futsal just not that big in Engeland..?
let go nez

9 7
Tk is the best
LDN I  love the play everyone deserves it
Ngl, I didn't realize it was 2 yellows either
Did anyone see Jamie doing rock, paper, scissor shoo with TK?😂😂
The coach is bad.  Doesn't understand basic psychology.  He tells his players to wake up.  Cmon.  Does he really believe they aren't trying?  At one point, he says that the players are holding onto the ball too much.  Generally, one-touch is better but not always.  For example, 14:30.  Also, if you can successfully dribble past your guy, you can draw two players to you and create an open player.  The one thing that this team should do is take better shots.  Whenever they have time, they automatically wind up and take the shot.  The shots unsurprisingly are blocked.  They should look for the one-touch shots (as in 14:30).
Great game! Lots of action!
Score prediction was 10-7 loss
good game Jay
8 or 9 to 6 or 7 LDN. That's my score prediction.
Lovely passing good captainship by tk and good goal overall good match but j how are u missing the ankle breaker that phillipe did to one of the other team'splayers

ldn 9-por 7 9-7
10 to8
Imagine giving that team talk then costing the goal 😂
I think it will be 7 6 to the othere team because they only lost by one goal against southampton
5 hours late 0-0 mb mb Edit: tbh i think the score will be 5-6 to LDN (late comeback) i do this for the fun of it LOL
I hate to be that guy but every caption says ‘I Played In A PRO FUTSAL Match’… but they aren’t professional matches?
3-5 losing. good match so far
Tk is the ultimate last man 👑 defense is top tier👌 his long shots brings the team back into fight 👌 his skills is astonishing especially in crowded spaces 👌 & his leadership is inspiring 👌
Somehow these futsal videos help a lot with my anxiety, man. Keep up the good work. This time TK didn't leave them a chance. What a baller!
Looking forward to the semis 😂❤
9-6 Ldn wins
Jamie I would say the score prediction will be 8:4 for the other team because they scored 2 early goals
9-6
21:53 Philipe is class
9-5
TK is high standard man! Well done LDN.
Hand to God I didn’t cheat I was sooo close
6 LDN to 5 por my prediction
6-5 to ldn score prediction
5-4 Ldn of course
i think 9 to 5
Nez is improving a lot since his first game he deserves more love and he is so underrated
3-5 ldn my guess
9-7
4-3 LDN all the way
TK is a proper captain. Love him❤
Karim is so good at holding up play
I think the score was 9-7 to LDN
Ldn
You don't even need to look at us when we're speaking cause I mean we're not looking at you. We're watching the match
where is zaidddd
Win for LDN 9-7
I think score will be 7-4 LDN
9 to us 6 to them
Ammar might be the most underrated player
Today was an intense game! I happy we won! We are onto the Semi-Finals! Also you teach me many moves for my competitive futbol league! Keep up the good work in the nationals! I hope we win against Southampton!🔥
6-4

4-3
6-5 LDN
Phillipe just sent one of the blues at his home , and nobody talked about it🥶
Come on J 21:53 is something 🤣🤣
I can clearly understand why TK is the captain
5-7 portsmouth
It’s far away from a PRO futsal level. I have been playing at the top tier in my country for years, so I know what is PRO futsal. Some players in this team are really good, but Futsal what they are playing and referees are just ridiculous. It’s max a semi pro level🫡
i think its gonna be like 4-3 thats just what i think i hope  that thats what it is
score:5-7
TK best play for every time defensively and attacking specially rising shot
5:4
Score prediction is 7-4 to you LDN❤
Omg so Excited for today because I love your videos and you finally came up with one futsal game❤
That guy on portsmouth that rabona was cold
6 mins 50 in and ldn to win 7-5
Ldn
I play for the Portsmouth and Southsea Futsal club but I’m in the Under 7’s , gutted I missed the game as I watch all your videos, shame I couldn’t come. 😢 ❤ Great game though. 🎉
7-4 love these vids every week I can never wait I rate ur vids and ur football tekk so much love Jamie big up LDN
LDN❤
That backflip goal was definitely crazy but I rlly think the best goal was the one where u flicked on a pass from TK for Nez’s first goal that was just the definition of how u play as a team in futsal
Jamie you need to bring the mouse trap. I miss them so much
Your goal was a solid 9/10
Ldn 7- por 5 5:58
Whats the point of writing down who got a yellow card if you dont check to see if its a 2nd yellow for the GK? Keepets rarely get a yellow so it would be easy to remember by default. Imagine if it was 6-6 and the GK scored the winner for them. So unprefessional. Still well played guys comfortable win
Tk is an actual goat like Jamie aswell keep up this footsal you got this
TK is the 🐐
Tk could play prem you know
Definitely 9-6🤔
If everyone would have written comment every time you asked for it during the video, there would literally spam of essays and random numbers
3 to 2
Score prediction 9-5 LDN
10-9 😂
LDN
7-5
I think 9 7
❤LDNNNNNNNNNNNN❤
I think it will be 9-6 to LDN come on you red’s❤❤❤❤ the nutmeg from TK was 10/10 man of the match was Karim ❤❤❤❤
That nutmeg from tk was 10/10 🔥🔥
I started watching you a few months ago and let me tell you, your videos are amazing. I can really relax while watching it and it's just a joy to watch!!
You should do a video every 1 or 2 months looking at our skills and goals
Imagine Jamie commenting on you're commenting that could never be me
👋🏼👋🏼 from Croatia
I love these
I think this will be a close game ( even though the other team got early goals) and the score will be 6-5 for LDN Edit:god damn y'all  played sooo good definitely exceeded expectations
My score line: 9-6    Ldn winning
9-5 LDN win       Edit:HOW TF DID I GUESS IT
I like how Osama never gives up.

Ldn
Pompey are good though
8-6 ldn win
That’s what I guessed

Ammar is way too overrated! You cannot compare him with TK, Jamie or Phelippe. He has long legs and hes been the luckiest scorer. But TK and Jay are just way too classy and always fun to watch!

I'm sorry but I feel like you guys don't talk enough when ur on the pitch. Like when I played professional 11 a side and even for my country all I did was shout and talk. Like I don't hear use saying pick up that man or I've got him or 1-2 ball or threw ball or back post or anything really... don't be scared to shout at ur team mates, it just makes u a better player and team for it... trust me ❤
6-4

Love these vids
Ldn movements
Play like this and Southampton have no chance. We got to remember that we only had 1 sub the last time we played them and we held our own for most of it. Fatigue, tiredness caught up with us but with the strong side that we had today, I have no doubts. Cmon LDN!!!!
You guys are lacking kick-in tactics. Especially when the you have a kick-in in the opponents half, they can be deadly, just like set pieces. E.g. you could TK run up and just tap the ball to him similar like an indirect freekick, so he can have a free shot. (or more elaborate versions). Its so close to the goal, you should treat it more like a set piece and develop tactics for it.
I love Jamie’s video’s they always get me excited and I hop Jamie sees this comment and . Keep up the good  work and always go LDN❤️
beautiful football by ldn
