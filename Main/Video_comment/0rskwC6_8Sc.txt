Schönes Spiel von beiden Mannschaften
Incredible to have lost two points in a game like this ...
I’ll be VERY surprised if Everton don’t recall Simms. Looks insanely confident in front of goal! The lad defiantly has the attributes to be a top striker.
Esse empate foi horrível 😔
Sunderland needs à réal goal keeper Awful
I’m surprised to see this on trending.
What a game...better than PL
Surely we can recall Simms?
That would’ve been such a good goal that last attempt off the bar
What do you Sunderland fans think of Simms up to now and how do u think he will do am a Everton fan and I think we should never of let him out on loan I think he's ready for prem now
good
Falling to deep once in the lead more often than not punishes you. If we'd continued to play and gone for the third I don't think we would've conceded two, but if we had we might very well have grabbed a third and won anyway. I know it was a warm day and all but ha'way, don't lose games because of just defending for way too long.
maybe play for the full 90 min next time,  instead of just 45 min like normal.  and get a right back!
Tem coisas q só acontecem com o Sunderland msm: gol de goleiro no fim do jogo e ainda bola na trave 🤦🏻‍♂️
Is anyone else trying to find themselves in the crowd? 😂
That goalkeeper/goal scorer.
so many mackems dressed as pink seats 🙈
great comeback qpr, sunlun will do ok...
What a game really.... I feel for Gooch and the whole team QPR deserved the draw in the end but how did Elliot miss that last chance.... I mean go on get in but no the fuking gods kept it out, imagine the stadium had that gone in.
Sunderland afc aka amir kahn offensively great but defensively shit! Need more depth at the back
Sunderland unlucky. Should've won this one 2:1.
We are scoring goals and look dangerous a comfy season ahead I hope
Welcome back Sunderland… it’s such a hard league
FORTUNATE. The GK had the two mins of his entire career
Looking forward to visiting Sunderland as a Burnley fan. Look a decent side!
Always love a keepers contribution even if it’s against us in fairness. The elation in a keepers face after scoring is infectious and you can’t help but be happy for the lad even if it’s at our expense.   Draw was still a decent result for us, just gutting to consider we were cruising at 2-0 so close to the end of the match.
If only Patto caught it and kicked it out instead of punching it back to them 😏 but we go again Wednesday 👏🏼
Gutted but still proud of this group of lads 👏🏼
So disappointed not to win but very encouraging that we don't look out of our depth, which was the worry at the start of the season.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why take Simms off with 30 minutes left? Should have waited till they were three nil up at least. Like England taking Bobby Charlton off v West Germany in 1970!

Good going forward but just weren’t capable of seeing out the game, fair result but have to be disappointed after the first half display.
I checked 5 mins from time and we were top of the league... I know that doesn't mean much yet...but still.
Well done Rangers. Great comeback.
4 games played x2 goals conceded in each. Not good
When the f*n GK score the draw is a terrible lack of focus
Terrible defending for equaliser.Two safc players on their wide player and he still got cross in.
We've never been good at seeing games out, but they don't seem to be learning anything from it. That's 4 points in the last 15 mins we've chucked away already this season.
So unlucky at the end
Honestly Sunderland are the Spurs of the football league, only team to let me down on my acca this weekend, useless.
Decent first half typical Sunderland thought the game was won at 2-0 up let QPR come out second half and put the pressure on bad game management from the referee would of took a point pre match but to concede twice after 86 minutes is a bitter pill to swallow but that’s the championship. On to the next one🔴⚪️🔴⚪️
Great game, unfortunate draw but we are getting there lads
Sunderland looking good going forward... they'll be ok this season but holding onto a lead is something that needs to be worked on.. having said that QPR are a good side too
LOL Losers!
Best Game i have Seen Since five years
Remember!!!! Sunderland 'Til I Die!!!!!!! Come on!!!!!!
pain
Not good result but we can do it Lets go Sunderland❤🇮🇶
Unfortunate but we’ll take the point
no no no! 2-0 up subs??? 2-2 WTF.... we lost 2 pts today can't see games out blame the players? no blame the management for todays game 1 word .....WHY?  sit back again we get fkd again
Le gardien Sénégalais Seny Dieng qui marque et fait un arrêt décisif
I think you will be fine this season and with a couple of more signings a possible top half finish, I hope so as you're too big a club to be playing in league 1 and have the ground and support to be in the prem.  I wish you well and hope you finish one place below us.
You Rs
Disappointing not to win but this team is exciting and can definitely hold their own in this league
peak Sunderland
Like a fifa match.
1win 2draw not  bad
How did embleton not score at the end there
wow he showed more than the whole qpr team did
In Control of the game almost till injury time, then 4 mins of typical Sunderland off the past 6 years by throwing points away, feels like a defeat. It is a big learning curve today for the players of how ruthless the championship can be if you don't concentrate for 90+ mins, we need 4-5 signings in before the window shuts for a comfortable mid-table+ finish, at the moment we have a team that may just survive which is our goal this season anyway.
Simms needs to sort that celebration out like😂
What a game
Hopeless
Why Sunderland
I’ll take a draw, it’s just the way it happened
patterson should save that free kick
End me now.
So exited to get the highlights out
Sunderland doing a sunderland, love it.
WAIT STOP✝️ITS NOT TO LATE TO TURN TO GOD BUT SOON IT WILL BE✝️YOU’RE NOT PROMISED TOMORROW REPENT AND SPREAD THE GOSPEL AND PRAY 🙏
