When I wanna live my life peacefully? It's like I've been feeling real evil recently, not recently, but forever Ayo, my bredrin, pass me the leather You know that we love applying the pressure It's crazy You don't know me, you don't know yourself Put the machine on the shelf Only time can tell when we'll fill him with bells And his bredrin?

Crazy... So crazy Inlove being an African. The Youths are indeed representing the most fertile continent on Earth no doubts.  Al whats left is for our political leaders to place Mama AFRICA on the world map.  Black Kunta, the Hunter. The Blazer, The Mentor the Five Star AFRICANIST J-HUS
01:06 u don’t know -> 01:21 Jupiter -> 01:46 perish -> 02:05 murder -> 02:11 country -> 02:21 father
Concept could of been Hus dreaming with same visuals then wakes up at the end of the song. Like the album promo vid with Elba. All Hus songs is art

I fw J Hus but I rebuke this song by the blood of Jesus Christ
people not realising that 'devil in me demon in me' is a metaphor. he's referring to the fact he's done shit he's not proud of any one with an iq can tell that lmao, surprised people need it spelling out for them. I guess people are so used to lyrics being so literal and to the point these days
💥💥💥💯
Waited 3 years for him to rhyme bell with bell with bell

It's like I've been feeling real evil recently Not recently, but forever Ayo' my bredrin, pass me the leather You know that we love applying the pressure It's crazy  You don't know me, you don't know yourself Put the machine on the shelf Only time can tell when we'll fill him with bells And his bredrin? We'll drill him aswell Bring him to hell, I've seen him drop, that's when he fell I'm on your arse, I'm on your tail I wanna' send him to Jupiter, it wasn't me, it was Lucifer I don't care if I'm a superstar, all them man I'm gonna crucify I believe that you can fly when I put this bonsam in your eye Crept up on him on the sly Fuck the law, I don't abide  The devil in me, demon in me I had six but I let go of three Told my bredrin, "Let go of me" He's said, "Calm down, there's no need" Me, I take everything personally When I hopped out it was 30-degrees, it's crazy 'Cah we gotta' bun a donny in front of Louise But secretly  I wanna make him perish, vampire feeling peckish I ain't even cold, I'm naked, hellfire's where he's headed It's crazy I wanna' send a message, let them know that I'm not playing I wanna' beef the world, I wanna feed them bells, your name don't ring a bell Come like Stringer Bell Nah, more like Omar Put a tooth in his molar, tell him it's over Murder gives me a boner I'm so fire, solar The pagans stink they carry a odour Blam the young G and blam the older Go to that country and take it over The world keeps spinning like a revolver Blackjack, I'm the joker Man don't need no poker, need a borer You feel my aura, I'm in the corner causing a sauna For all the pain and trauma I'm the farda giving order Man will splash them, turn them water, do it for the culture Let me do it, I'm a vulture, bring me closer He's a stunter and a poser I'm a hunter, I'm an ogre I'm eager, bare anger If I don't see you now, then after, later Man go there with a baker, blazer, take his face off Why this man wanna' play tough? Play hard, it's just me and my main darg If you splash him get A star, five star That time got rolled on by a biker Had me feeling bare hyper, tryna find me a lighter And find somebody to light up  The devil in me, demon in me I had six but I let go of three Told my bredrin, "Let go off me" He's said, "Calm down, there's no need" Me, I take everything personally When I hopped out it was 30-degrees, it's crazy 'Cah we gotta' bun a donny in front of Louise But secretly, I should've bun him immediately, seriously Find out where this eediat be Them man don't want meet with me, it's crazy Gotta' spread them bells out evenly, furiously, deviously, we had a mad altercation previously But The devil in me, demon in me The devil in me, demon in me

The goat is back
Go Jamaican man I support you
Jesus loves you!
💀💀💀
Sound engineer forgot to do vocals lmao
ALL OF YOU NEED TO WAKE UP! It’s so clear and blatant. ASK GOD TO CHANGE YOUR HEARTS. GET RIGHT WITH HIM. It’s not “hard” or “good music” or “Gods engineering”. This is sin. The complete absence of God. Read your Bibles, become disciples and make disciples of all nations. The path to heaven is narrow. Not a lot of people are going to make it. Your spiritual life matters.
Only 1m in 5days. Not looking great hus
whats the coat with the blue butterfly called ?
This is garbage!
Hustler Baby🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can’t stop playing this 😩🔥🔥 Lord forgive me 🙏
I totally lost respect for jhus  I never thought he would get influenced by the American demonic music culture  next up his masters 👴🏻🕴🕴will make him promote this🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️  if this album is finna sound  this demonic,it's definitely finna flop like budlight

Yess the legend is back. Im so hyped for this. My favourite rapper has returned to the scene to outdo the rest
[Intro] (Fumes on the beat)  [Chorus] The devil in me, demon in me I had six, but I let go of three Told my brethren, "Let go of me" He said, "Calm down, there's no need" Me, I take everything personally When I hopped out, it was thirty degrees It's crazy 'cah we gotta burn a donny in front of Louise But secretly, I should've burned him immediately, seriously Find out where this idiot be Them man don't wan' meet with me It's crazy, gotta spread them bells out evеnly Furiously, deviously We had a mad altercation prеviously But why you wanna see the evil me when I wanna live my life peacefully? It's like I've been feeling real evil recently Not recently, but forever Ayo, my brethren, pass me the leather You know that we love applying the pressure It's crazy  [Verse 1] You don't know me, you don't know yourself Put the machine on the shelf Only time can tell when we'll fill him with bells And his brethren, we'll drill 'em as well, bring 'em to hell I've seen him drop, that's when he fell I'm on your ass, I'm on your tail I wanna send him to Jupiter It wasn't me, it was Lucifer I don't care if I'm a superstar, all them man, I'm gonna crucify I believe that you can fly when I put this bonsam in your eye Crept up on him on the sly Fuck the law, I don't abide  [Chorus] The devil in me, demon in me I had six, but I let go of three Told my brethren, "Let go of me" He said, "Calm down, there's no need" Me, I take everything personally When I hopped out, it was thirty degrees It's crazy 'cah we gotta burn a donny in front of Louise But secretly  [Verse 2] I wanna make him perish, vampire feeling peckish I ain't even poled, I'm naked, hellfire's where he's headed It's crazy, I wanna send a message, let them know that I'm not playing I wanna beef the world, I wanna feed him bells Your name don't ring a bell Come like Stringer Bell, nah, more like Omar Put a tooth in his molar, tell him it's over Murder gives me a boner I'm so fire, solar The pagans stink, they carry an odour Blam the young G and blam the older Go to that country and take it over The world keeps spinning like a revolver Blackjack, I'm the joker Man don't need no poker, need a borer You feel my aura I'm in the corner causing a sauna For all the pain and trauma I'm the father giving order Man just splash them, turn them water, do it for the culture Let me do it, I'm a vulture, bring me closer He's a stunter and a poser I'm a hunter, I'm an ogre I'm eager, bare anger If I don't see you now, then after, later Man go there with a baker, blazer, take his face off (Crazy) Why this man wan' play tough, play hard? It's just me and my main dog If you splash him, get A-star, five star That time got rolled on by a biker Had me feeling bare hyper Tryna find me a lighter Then find somebody to light up  [Chorus] The devil in me, demon in me I had six, but I let go of three Told my brethren, "Let go of me" He said, "Calm down, there's no need" Me, I take everything personally When I hopped out, it was thirty degrees It's crazy 'cah we gotta burn a donny in front of Louise But secretly, I should've burned him immediately, seriously Find out where this idiot be Them man don't wan' meet with me It's crazy, gotta spread them bells out evenly Furiously, deviously We had a mad altercation previously But—  [Outro] The devil in me, demon in me The devil in me, demon in me

We really are a lost people. What is this?   Therapy immediately
Glad he’s back! He’s the Goat 🐐 no one can doit like J
This guy took 5 years to release this ????
what does "yatakara" mean pretty sure i didnt spell it right
You can tell J Hus misses being on road and doing 10 toes on opps but being famous doesn’t allow him to do road anymore. He misses it badly lol.
This is utter crap 🤣
Demonic bars that hit sooo hard 💀
We need a j hus potter link up
We need the old j hus back 😢
So nice song this beautiful song
