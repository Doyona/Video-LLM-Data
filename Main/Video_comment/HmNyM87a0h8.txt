Cristiano disappeared in both games vs Porto
People forget the goal keeper mistakes 🤦‍♂️ Reason why Juventus lost. Horrible needed to do better.
Coming here after watching Ronaldo’s anger for losing.. the looks on his teammates face before the match says it all! Surprise mfs
Why was Weston Mckennie subbed out so early?
.Bring back Luis Nani 2022 world cup.
juve is so bad oml
Mehdi Taremi is Porto’s best player and probably the best player in Porto’s history! He will not stay with Porto long so enjoy him while you have him there!

3-2 hahaha. Dildar Alikhel should apply for a 🤡 job in a circus
Morata= Big fat zero.
😂😂😂😂
What’s crazy is how both Alex Sandro and Danilo both started for Porto back in 14/15 and 15/16 and now both start for juve playing against Porto and lose 😂

Is it me or Ronaldo is actually make more goal passes than actually receiving them? How are you gonna play Ronaldo without giving him passes to score and expect winning. The defense is shit. The midfield is shit and they actually need Ronaldo to play midfield in order to even get any good chance to score.  I really do not understand why they sign morata when they already have deballa and Ronaldo. Get yourself a good midfielder damn
HaHaHa bullshit penalty
The silent humor phylogenetically settle because screw aetiologically unpack beneath a whole flat. normal, unused trapezoid
Taremi🇮🇷🔥
The same thing happened to lazio on the first goal
Porto showed that they really are the best team of Portugal and that they are used to the Champions League, and they do have the skills to win in it. There’s a reason why they have 2 CL titles, which is the same number as Juventus!
The goal keeper is a joke
Bentancur deserves to never play for Juventus again. Dude plays like a 3 legged donkey lmao get him out. Juve with a proper midfield character do damage, players like de Bruyne, Pogba, James, etc. would elevate them. They won’t win the champions league without a proper midfield. With a better midfield, Ronaldo would do even better
Messi and Ronaldo going out in the R16s smh

You showed the chilena from ronaldo but ignored the one from tecatito.
Bentacor flopped so bad, he caused juve to lose by giving porto huge moral to win game.
Is there a 2nd leg or no
This is the year of the champions league for Juve.
Juventus looks like shiiiiiiit
Terrible midfield terrible coaching

I've seen so many teams get punished for playing out from the back too much. There's a limit to that and teams are taking it overboard. That's without counting the hundreds of near misses I've seen as well.

Jesus is coming soon. Wake Up. Get right with God
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Go porto
Juve will score 3 next game
Penaldo didn't get penalty.
Taremi wants
Oh no ronaldo
Bentucur is a great player who makes costly mistakes. Last season he also conceded a penalty which costed Juve a huge price. He needs to improve in those areas otherwise he is someone Juve can rely on in the midfield. I think this is far from over. That away goal was very important for Juve. Porto were not a great team but just got so lucky. They did not create but rather got two gifted goals. It appears they focused much on defense and they really did a good job at the back. But in terms of creativity, I would give them 4/10. Juve will deliver in Turin if they can concentrate on the game.
That first goal of Juventus was a badass well executed goal...
No penald oh today
PORTOOOOOOO🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹
Pirlo needs to start Morata & Dybala
زنده باد ایران و ایرانی زنده باد مهدی طارمی
Goal celebration: head pat, head pat, head pat, head pat
Ronaldo is playing?
juvewent from pogba, pirlo  and vidal to this
Bentancur was main responsible for the first goal. Rabiot was not taking any responsibility for defensive midfielder role. Midfielder have to work hard for attack and defence. Pirlo should work with midfielder and their role...
No Ronaldo highlights? I guess no penalties were called...
Fix match
How is any team hiring a player as disgusting as Pepe?
Kind of unrelated, but i couldn't help think how odd it must be that Pirlo and Chiellini were once both teammates who played alongside each other on the national team and now Pirlo is his coach. So they were of equal status being teammates but now Pirlo is his superior, I'm sure they are friends and they both have respect for each other so not insinuating tension or anything, just that it must seem a little odd how he is the coach of a former teammate.
blast my twitch https://www.twitch.tv/snx_gm
Didn't even seem like Ronaldo was in the match.
So does this mean juventus is out?
no penalty no party for gaynaldo....
Good thing they scored in away
Porto came ready to play
Juve needs more aggressive midfielder

I didn't  see CR7 in the whole game🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
how come soccer players can't catch covid-19... conspiracy theory....
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🔻
Juventus should hire commentators under this video to play
Where was cristiano?????? He only was walking all the match.... he didn't defend wowww Cristiano didn't show up he was hiding 90 minutes
God entered into my body, like a body. my same size. God rips my face, shoots in my mouth, gum disease. Jesus christ appears and laughs. come to God
Juve  is the Italian Barca
Why isnt dybala starting?
7:32 your grandma can do better lol
Bentancur has official has been awarded the worst midfielder of the month. cOnGrAtS
Taremi :)
Ronaldo is gonna do what he usually does
That second goal was probably the best 30 seconds of play to open a second half I've seen
Go Porto
PORTO
@ mattia polibio luv
This was honestly the most boring game I’ve seen. Juves creativity is non-existent, they couldn’t make long field passes, were cluttered together just all around boring. Nobody was giving that intensity smh I hope Ronaldo doesn’t waste the rest of his career there just bc he wants to bring a champions league trophy to them.
ronaldo sucks messi in barcelona is the best L to CR7 LOSER cr7
Is Dybala injured?

Juve should bring James Rodriguez  🔥 They need a new midfield
It's time for Ronaldo to quit soccer because soccer is quitting him
Its neither FC Ronaldo or FC Messi , its Juventus and FC Barcelona ! If the team loses they all obviously messed up as a team ! Stop blaming just those 2 players for their teams losing ! If anything it's poor managerial job !

Whenever juv lose they never show score 😂

Suddenly regretting not doing the Liga Nos SBCs
Incoming Ronaldo second-leg magic....
Why is this commentator blaming the goalkeeper for those 2 goals it's a defensive error by juventus.
great
Where’s penalty which should be given to Juve in the end?!
I say PSG will take it this year.
We suck!
Only Mehdi taremi
7:12 Morata is terrible. That should be a goal
2nd leg should be exciting 🤔
Every team trying to use their GK as an outfield player and playing out from the back is so, so, SO cringe to watch. But hilarious
Are y’all seriously not going to show Jesus Corona’s attempt at goal with a bicycle kick? 🤦🏻‍♂️🇲🇽
enserio, te agradesco mucho, que no haigas confiado en buffon, porque buffon no hubiera fracasado asi...

For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
Everyone saying that porto is a small club, they are quite consistent in ucl and have won one more recently than juventus! Never underestimate porto, considering a good amount of  young talent that big clubs buy come from within porto's ranks.
That's a new trend in football, defenders and goalkeepers passing the ball to each other in front of the goal when surrounded by the opponent players😒
Uribe y Marchesin águilas 🦅🤩
Pirlo is a fucking idiot no Arthur they should have gotten a right and left back but they want that useless Alex Sandro and Danilo in so bad smh
Bentancu assisting the wrong forwards 😂
Are u kidding me did you drink your milk today juventus
Imagine if Corona knocks out Ronaldo in the champion league
Tbh I never liked how betancur plays, he's missing something just not sure what it is.
Where is Coronas Bicycle kick?
Juve had the kickoff glitch
You love to see it
This proves Marchesin deserves to play for the Argentina Football Team. Never seen a Argentine goalkeeper that good in   6 years alongside Martinez.
1:47 why does szczesny’s mistake right there remind of alisson’s in the game vs Man City, except he didn’t concede a goal from it at least
Scheszny is so baddddd
Even my 6yr old son knows NOT to pass the ball back to goalie inside the box
2nd Porto goal was a great team goal!
Fuk VAR. That was a clear penalty for Juventus
Juve will win the 2nd leg easily. Stop acting like there's any doubt. So obvious this is all scripted.
Cr7 washed up
that referee del cerro denied a penalty kick for juve at the 93rd minute, and he should have made juventus cross that final ball of the game. Bad refereeing.
Jesus fucking Christ CBS fuck you I came here literally just to see the last challenge on Ronaldo and you didn’t think to include that? Fuck you and your shit streaming service.
The same shit that happened last year will happen again. Yes Juventus will score on return game but Porto will score too and qualify
Porto beat Juventus lmfao superstar's
Fix defense and a little bit midfield
I wonder why Ronaldo didn’t play in this game?
Did Ronaldo play?
I stg if juventus gonna be the next Barca smh
Thua 50$ :((
TAREMI 💚🤍❤
The oval hood unknowingly disapprove because battery substantially measure by a grumpy caution. hard-to-find, wandering pine
Wheres divalaaaaa
Did Ronaldo play?

Juve gonna lose this serie
Why not include Corona’s bicycle kick? Although it didn’t count he did it pretty good
The absurd word subsequently boast because yellow supply seal beneath a gorgeous ornament. innate, equable veil
Ronaldo in an old athletic now🤣🤣
I think it’s hilarious how gk always take a drink of water after a goal as if they really need to be hydrated after a simple attempt to block.
Taremi 💪
Second goal  porto is going to torture  juvents

What a time for football it was 5 years ago when Ronaldo and Messi were in their prime.
Portos goalie played for mexican ream America he was good
Second leg in italy who want to bet on a penalty for juventus ? Especially if juventus concede another goal definitely penal for CR7...im waiting on the bets
Everyone talking about only juv midfield what about their goalkeeper tho
Does Chiellini always smile that hard before a match lol
What kind of goal keeper juv have lol
Is anyone going to say something about those ugly orange Jerseys lol
Morata's positioning is astonishingly garbage.
En estos tipos de partidos es donde el Tecatito Corona se debe de dar a reconocer más ante grandes oponentes, literalmente hoy no se vio!! 🇲🇽👎
Dam both goats took a L
This may sound toxic but damn Ronaldo is privileged I would rather Messi play for any other club like Juve than Barca because they’re so bad and even then Ronaldo and Juve can’t even beat Porto
طارمی ❤✌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
In the name of God and Goaaaaaaaaaaaaaal...(it's Porto FC tweet in Persian)💚
Ronaldo vs Pepe that's sad to see
Did Ronaldo play today 🤔
Earned my subscription with the fast upload
Siuuuuuuuuuuuu
CR7 and Messi would get knocked out of UCL knocked out around.
7:44 I see Demiral setting in that Italian life, eh?
That first goal was definitely a gift 🎁 for Porto. Juventus need to play better next game and come up with the win. My question is, will Ronaldo score?
mehdi👏👏👏👏👑👑👑👑💪💪💪💪💪🙏🙏🙏💓💓💓💓
i thought kickoff goal glitch was only in fifa
Bentacur cost us the game hard and why 442 can we do like 3512 like that the 1 how we beat Barcelona like come on well in 2-2 so at allaniz we better score goals
Marchesin deserves credit as always.
szczesny is not a top goal keeper. Jive could definitely do better at that position and though Buffons prime is well past him at least he has his age to blame for his decline as a keeper. szczesny just has nothing to fall back on.
Where is McKennie? he couldve held down the midfield as they performed poorly today
That was a penalty at the end.  Porto got lucky there
I hate it when big clubs show up and just think they can beat all the small team cause they have money if u start a game just lazy u will get punished
جونم مهدی
The draconian ashtray frustratingly excite because minute plausibly sprout about a premium denim. eager, electric soprano
Dude was haring on Moraga's goal big time. It was sick.
Hearing clive tyldesley just makes me think of the old fifa games
Juventus will never win the Champions League because their midfield is not good enough. Ronaldo can't produce miracles every game.
Last year Juve got knocked out in round of 16 because Bentancur gifted a penalty to Lyon. Same story this year. Why do they keep playing him? #BentancurOut
I don’t believe sczenzny deserved to be blamed for the first goal that’s on bentancur, the second maybe he could’ve done better but he was not at fault completely, his defense and midfield were statues and slow to start
No Cuadrado, No party!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️MEHDI TAREMI❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Mckennie is ridiculously slow
Morata sucks ass
I don't understand how pirlo has morata and dybala on the bench. Morata has been one of the only creative players of Juve.
Second Porto goal was a beauty! Something you’d see from peak barca.
When it comes to UCL many Juve players piss their pants and forget how to play football
3 Former Liga Mx players in Porto love to see it .
Bentancur and rabiot in the same midfield? Come on, they have no iq at all, I don’t even know why they’re a 1st team starters. Everyone in Juve sucks except Ronaldo ( sometimes morata and dybala) they have no passion at all, danilo and alex Sandro are washed, their only good players are sczeny, cr7, morata, dybala and de ligt. It’s sad really, same with Barca. They only have Messi and de jong, aside from that, it’s game over for both teams if the managers don’t change things around ASAP
Juve rather play possession then attacking 😒🙄😳.  They think they r man. City?
Ronaldo should play midfielder alone and all these useless midfielders will play forward....as always, Juve plays like turtle...what a waste of time watching...if not for Ronaldo I wi never watch Juve...BORING...So BORINGGGGGGG
The smart fedelini interstingly start because pansy cranially guide per a synonymous morning. dear, ugliest afternoon
بازم مثل همیشه طارمی برنده میشه
Screw CBS sports
Penaldo always cries for penalty 😂😂🤣
Now why wouldn’t they put jesus corona’s bicycle kick?
Why was ronaldo on the bench?
Taremi is the best right now.
Damn if Barca had a good defense like Juve and some of their attacking players we would do a lot better. Keep the midfield though 😂.
This channel should have more subscribers.
Juve are so ass, even at there best. Ronaldo needs to leave
I watch every Juve game, worst I’ve seen all year. As usual our midfield is horrible and can’t create anything for the attackers. Kulu should’ve never started in a 4-4-2 as a striker, Morata should’ve been in whole game.  We desperately need Dybala to find his form and Pirlo needs to give his magic to our midfield so they can learn to create chances and make forward passes.  Also disappointed to see Pirlo make almost no changes the whole game, we needed to adjust when the 442 wasn’t creating anything for us.
man Porto 100% controlling except the big difference between the two clubs a little weird but good luck for Porto
I know... not good.
I thought CR7 is better than Messi? Still losing to Porto? At least Messi lost to PSG, last year's finalists.
Thank you chiese 🙏🙏
bring heungmin Son
A moment of silence for all the cr7 fans who made fun of Barca losing to psg
Juve’s midfield is so dogshit, all they want to do is pass back. Did the same thing against inter in coppa italia and almost conceded. Stupid tactics.
i wouldve subbed that stupid ass out
Mehdi Taremi is considered the best striker in the Portuguese league, but this clever Iranian goal scorer was underestimated and scored a goal.
Cr7 suck
Love the thumbnail
You sorry bastards, You lost to PORTOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Where is paulo dybala
I didn't know Moh Salah's brother played for Porto.
Where are Juventus midfielders and defenders?
juve had $23.65million on them , who won
Put dybala for Morata next time
At least feature every player for the anthem ...
Porto deserved the w cause juv I been a fan for so long but wtf u played so bad at least we have 2nd leg
So they're just not gonna describe that second goal's finish at all?
Bentancur has had one to many chances at Juve.. he just isn't at that level yet .. just taking up a spot on the squad
Why did they take Mckennie off??? He was a little shaky in the offense but not as shaky as the rest of the team but he was winning all kinds of balls back for Juve. Betancour lost Juve the game in the first minute. He was doing stupid shit  the whole match . The whole team was disjointed though.
That was a great finish by Chiesa 🔥
CBS EMPLOYEES DESERVE CANCER FOR CENSORING COMMENTS.
Where is CR7s penalty?? There is always a penalty in every match he plays??? Weird game
How could they skip tecatitos beautiful bicycle kick
Taremi🤩❤️👍
Mbappe>>>>>>>> Messi = Ronaldo
Español los comentarios. 😟 por favor
Is it me or the camera is essay to far. I almost didn't see the freaking ball
Ronaldo was on lock
Dang that was hard to watch Juve played so bad haha. Juventus back line sucked haha. Love Juve and Robaldo but Porto deserved this one for sure
Damn juventus
How big of a difference Cuadrado makes in the field, Juve noticed how important he is.
that's an ugly ass jersey juve has
I don’t wanna start a fight but at least they didn’t get trashed like Barca
I watched the game and felt like Porto players had clearance to inflict as much pain on Juventus players before yellow or red cards could be used.
No penalty no party
PENALDO THIS.  MISSI THAT.  MISSI THAT.  PENALDO THIS.  IT'S GOING TO BE AWESOME, WHEN THESE TWO RETIRE.  A LEGION OF UNEDUCATED FOREIGNERS WILL GO WITH THEM.
Porto deadass on hyperoffense the first minute of breaks 🤣
When you eat too much pasta and expect to win the champions league
Juve is poor, they play boring football, I like Atlatico Madrid is better
Betancur is sucks
Why the HELL did Ronaldo go to Juve? He could've won so much more if he stayed at RM.
you have a player to your right but u decide to play back where u see the opposite sides players at? Bentancur ur brain dead as fuck 😐
arbitro merda!!!! vergogna UEFA!!!!
I see the game And Porto is a good time if don’t know
Bentacur 🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Juve SHOULD be fine. Got the away goal and now playing at home. I don't see juve making these errors at home.
I feel bad for Ronaldo ......
If McKennie would’ve created the sort of chance Corona did, it would’ve made the highlights. Smh
@La Barca u forgot Ronaldo passed brilliantly to Chiesa and he flopped and also crossed brilliantly but useless Morata doesn't know where he is suppose to go.
Cr7 fanboys awfully quiet👀
nice thumbnail what about the 11 plrs who actually won the match
*Porto* 🔥
Juve lucky to only concede 2
man, it’s sad to see this happen to my team, hope we can bounce back 2nd leg 😕
I love seeing the big teams lose! It’s about time. I’m tired of seeing the same teams every year
Guys who missed an open girl who didn’t score who lost 21 played badly and also don’t forget did not make any assist and he’s the goat because he’s greedy comment down below who is that players name
Joselico gracias Dios 🙏🏻⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️🔥⭐️💪🏻
Where’s Ronaldo PK?
Don't understand people calling this a huge upset. Clearly not watching enough football. Porto are a good team, and Juve are in very questionable form.
Juve would of lost by way more if they had Linglet and Pique. Like 4-1.....yes ima Barça fan
Taremi!
Porto’s GK is hella good
Mehdi Taremi 👍🏽⚽🌹❤️🇮🇷
Wait so Juventus is out of the champions league ?
dont know why pirlo plays mckennie so high up, bentancur needs to be dropped... rabiot and mckennie would be a very decent duo in midfield
Pirlo thinks he’s zidane
This game got me so frustrated. The lack of intensity, focus, and the attitude.
Follow my twitch -ReflexCOD Please and thank you
PENALDO ...
Ronaldo it’s over come to MLS
Was TEKATITO CORONA  PLAYING
Wow Quick Highlights
7:16 😆😁
when are they going to teach morata how to stay onside what the fuck man
First barca and now juve wassup with the goats
Juventus is the most overrated team in the world
Why didn’t juv get there pen ?
I've been saying this since CR7 came to Juve. They need a creative Midfielder. They look dead. Isco would be great for Juve.
The mature thomas ophthalmoscopically sigh because window energetically close amongst a rustic ashtray. cautious, hushed quill
The flaky silk subsequently screw because stop neurologically educate near a longing freckle. wet, large drizzle
Lionel Messi!!!
Start Morata as an attacki midfielder. That should fix his offside problem and actually fix our midfield
Ronaldo’s had a poor season.
They didn’t show Ronaldo’s sweet ball to the back post near the end of the game.
Bentancur is match fixing lol.
Would you look at that. Barca and juve do have something in common. They both can’t defend to save their lives lmao🤣
5:48  “Ramsey... he has not played since the end of January because of...”🤨 Because of what? You can’t just leave us hanging like that.
What happened to juventus. They look like they never played soccer in their lives. You can’t even blame Ronaldo if the ball hardly made it past the midfield the entire game. The entire team is standing still, no one passes, the center backs dribble past half field and hold the ball forever when they had options 4 hours ago. No one has their heads up.   There was miles of space for the wingers to run onto the majority of the game and they never made runs. Maybe they didn’t even bother because of how atrociously slow the defense and midfield are at releasing the ball. Felt like watching u12s out there.   Also, Porto was absolutely terrible but when you play a u12 team, ofc you’re going to win. Juventus just look awful. It’s unbelievably frustrating to watch.
this game was a ronaldo motivational!!  see you at juventus stadium porto
Ronaldo LITERALLY disappeared
ronaldo will score hat trick in juventus stadium the same history every year ask wolsburg atletic juventus bayer
Morara IS, WAS, and ALWAYS will be ass
Clear pen on Ronaldo at the end. Idk why u guys didn't include it in the "extended" highlights
Morata, how do you miss that. Although tbh, I would've been more surprised if he had scored.
Just came to see if Pepe and Cr7 will have any interaction to each other.
That’s what juve get for wearing those brutal jerseys
Why did chelinni come out tho ?
Thanks for not putting the score
What a glorious assist from Bentancur!
No team deserves to win when wearing the kit
Side note, has to be said but Juve and inter kits are pretty bad this year
Nice job 🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷
This playing out of the back thing is probably the stupidest fad to ever hit football.
So where are all those Messi haters at? Let's hear you roast Ronaldo with that same energy, clowns. He lost to PORTO!! Hahaha!
Damnnn bro as a Ronaldo fan he’s getting old like I don’t understand how he missed that volley man he’s getting close to retiring man 😔
Props to them for putting these out so fast
Wow, the UCL song sounds great in their stadium
Is it me or Juventus plays like complete trash 🗑
Name a better duo than Morata and being offside.   Ans: Morata and missing sitters
Bruh they should of played Buffon 🤷🏽‍♂️
Did the ref create this highlight? Where is the PK that wasn’t called on CR7 in the 94th minute?
I hate how they don't show CR7 when Porto scored...
I laughed when he gave a easy goal to score in the first half😂😂
If Juventus make it to next level they gonna lose with whoever they face
So coronas bicycle kick doesn't make these highlights???  You can be racist against Mexicans all you want,, but at the end of the day, they pay your bills.. just saying
How tf do u concede in 15 seconds?
buffon should of been goalie
This was Ronaldo fault for not scoring the second. He flop for a pen and missed a opportunity! Like get up and play the game.
Laugh at us now Ronaldo fans, Y’all lost to Porto like wtf...
No Penalty. No Party.
Porto FC is bigger Club than  Man City PSG Arsenal Spurs Chelsea Spurs Atlético Leipzig Dortmund
fun fact does ronaldo really deserve to get called penaldo when messi only scored penalty vs psg and the goals he has for ucl this season are all PENS
Bro at the end there was a pen on penaldo but no cause the ref Is blind but great game by Porto and juve need to start de ligt 🙄🙄 GG Porto even tho I’m a psg man I trust Porto to win
The commentators were almost worse than Juve
Makes me feel better after losing 4-1.  hmmmphhh
Im looking for a barca fan bc ive been looking 4-1 and 8-2 see that there is no one
If Ronaldo stayed at Madrid he would’ve won another 1 or 2 champion trophies, but instead he chose the money
I see pirlo is also still paying for his stubbornness in the league and now also in the champions league... sticking with players that shouldn't be on the pitch.. start demiral n de ligt already and change up that midfield already also bench bentacor for good.. mans just turning a blind eye to all these things if he keeps this up legend or no legend he won't be around to be a manager not just in juve but also in any other club.
What a shot by cr7 at 7:35
wtf why would you *ever* pass the ball back like that, toward the goal, if keeper missed there would be an own goal. But besides that he came back no way he didnt know the other player was there and he had a player to pass to but did a good pass to the other team. maybe he bet on the game?
Marche is very underrated 🇦🇷
Great performances by Porto coming from a Juve. They deserved it. Juve on the other hand. I'm disappointed
Messi and Ronaldo were prob just having a bad day today
Juve will eliminate porto in the second leg easy
CR7 SUCKS!
Real quick,  the mid was bad to the fullest. They need to stop giving passes to the goalie! Chiellini needs to get out and get replaced by demiral. He’s too old and gets injured fast! I don’t even know what to say about Betancourt. He’s just bad!
ส่งคืนโกทำไม เสียค่าโง่สุดๆ
this is not a Juventus game, this shit
Lol penaldo nowhere to be found. 😂
Well both GOATS lost, maybe they will pull out some magic next game
In the last three years, Juve has been down at least one goal by the end of the first game of the round of 16.
This was the worst game today! So boring and juve were so bad, they should not advance any further in the competition
Did anybody see Ronaldo by chance?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
CR7 & Messi fans when his team wins: "Ronaldo/Messi is da GOAT"  CR7 & Messi fans when his team loses: "His team is trash but at least he did his best"
Love Ronaldo....Jeep is on the road ... Not over yet....come on!!!!!!!!!!
Look at the difference in faces at the beginning  Juve players smiling around while porto players just there serious asf 😂
*THE CHAMPIOONS!*
That’s what they get for not playing dybala ☺️
Juve only needs one goal and they go to the quarter finals barcą is another story 🤣
8:26  love how this left back started to mock Ronaldo by clapping in-front of his face 😂  mark my word, he'll regret it in 2nd leg.
Never underestimate your opponent. Hopefully juve can learn from this and capitalize next game.
Alex telles left for a club that’s in Europe league🤣
Pirlo thinks he’s zidane 🤦🏻‍♂️
partido abierto para la vuelta
Juve really loses
https://youtu.be/7UhHWev588M
wow fortnite skin
Worst midfield I have ever seen. Everyone is casually walking back while a counter attack was going on.😂😂😂
Taremi 🇮🇷
7:16 💀
Cr7 Penalty hatrick incoming in the 2nd Leg
🤣🤣🤣 all I see in the comments is Juve fan boys 😂😂😂 tell me.. was Ronaldo even playing??
Ronaldo definitely had some words to say to rest of the  team
Shitnaldo
Pirlo could probably use a few years gaining practical experience as a coach
2:58 Yup Yup
If Porto was any good, Juve would've lost by at least 4. What a shocking display.
That second goal was absolute class from Porto. Not much a defense can do when the opposition is pinging the ball around at that level.
What a difference without Arthur
Corona
Stupid goalkeeper
bentacur played horrible, pirlo let him played the whole match... rabiot is also bad. There were so many failed long ball / passes
0:47 ZOMG
The American kid is terrible defensively
Porto is very lucky got the draw to play against Juventus. 2nd leg shouldn't be a problem.
Sad that Messi and Ronaldo have to be relegated to their team's BS smh
Cheasa is rlly going off this season
Juve are such massive frauds
Ex club america players, Marchesin & Uribe representing us on the big stage 👏
I mean when ur midfield  consists of McKennie and Betancur what do you expect.
One thing I never understood is: why Juve push ball always backwards instead or forward!. Juve is dead team!. Forgot about Juventus
Where are the Ronaldo fans trolling Messi for being a ghost don’t see Ronaldo🤭
Bentancur what the hell. That mistake is so bad.
I’m a utd fan but juve needs a pogba in their midfield they’d be so much better
Wow this was not what I expected in terms of Juve performance.
Terrible referee
Juve should have won
Wow nice match
The blushing astronomy peroperatively undress because kimberly neurally agree around a defiant season. wry, worthless lier
McKinney so trash man, how is he a starter? No creativity, horrible passing and no communication
Messi was being clowned yesterday, sooo.....
okay morata is garbage.........dude tried a cannon shot during the game lol
It was very stupid to not start Ronaldo from the first munite of the game
Alguien que hable español 😁😸
Man I'm just disappointed they didn't put Coronas over head kick it was badass
You fuckers just watch highlights and blame Ronaldo. YOU HAVE NO IDEA how BAD this team is they don't utilize ronaldo he has to come back to receive the ball and push the move forward. All they do is sideways and backwards passing. And when they are finally in positions to score he now has to run in the box because they can't feed him the ball it's sad as fuck actually.  He needs to leave. It's sad to watch them waste him he hasn't had the ball in a dangerous position all game PIRLO NEEDS to stop fucking around.
Only if Rabiot scored...
0:45 when you lag on fifa
Cristiano looks like a rapper. That jersey is awful
Barca would easily beat Porto? People actually think that Barca was bad? Pfft
Well messi lost 4 -1
Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the part of Messi and Ronaldo's careers where fanboys are bragging about who lost worse. Just shut uppppp
What is up with morata always being offside 😂🤣😂 and applause to Ronaldo for that wonderful volley 😂🤣😂
Juve played so bad especially the midfield deserved loss. Better next time do not give the guy number 30 play again. Midfield too bad, last game penalty, this game the guy number 30 give Porto a goo. Ronaldo look like sickness man.????? Juventus should be change something for next game second leg???
NO penalty NO party NO Penaldo shit.
people complaining about bentacour but mckennie was just as bad
Always saving Ronaldo. Lmao.
Ronaldo (While still producing and playing well) is getting older, that missed volley at the end was embarrassing
Completely undeserved for Porto. Juve are lucky for this outcome. But, there will be a devastation after the second leg if they continue playing like today. I don't see a plan for the game, on top of that there are o lot of unexpected failures. Some players are not motivated or focused. Stop being pussies! U are Juventus!
It would if a 1-1 game if the Defender didn’t make that 💩of a pass
Once again like in the other game, should have shown us the VAR check. But nice game. Porto deserved the win I think
Man I hated ronaldo coming here, like before we could not win CL cuz of him, and now we still can't? We're wasting Dybala too. I feel like we should of built around him.
Looks like Messi’s Barca and Ronaldo’s Juve aren’t going well
RIP to people who chose to watch this boring ass game instead of dortmund vs sevilla
Barca lost- everybody blame Messi  Juve lost- it's middlefield's fault
Ronaldo had one chance finally at the end to do something. And he lost his balance lol. RIP
Cheisa ,morta nod.
When are people going to realize, as a defender you either got to accept the corner or get a clear even if it turns the ball over. There is no reason for Porto to have that 2 minute goal, the same thing almost happened in the barca PSG game the other day when Greizman caught the goalie on surprise. Dont risk doing stupid things, if you're backed up to your side of the field concede the corner or clear it.
The worlds ugliest kit award goes to....
So Ronaldo and Messi are in jeopardy of getting eliminated
Porto is the new 2019 ajax
age is getting to both messi and ronaldo now lol
Top Class Defenders. Barcelona could really go 4-1
Forgot Tecatitos Chilenita
Bentanchur or whatever his name is...TRASH
The only players that actually put all their energy into the game are Ronaldo,Chiesa, and McKennie. The rest of the squad needs to step up their game if they wanna make it far into the champions league and win it
Man all these fucking kids saying "oh Ronaldo is finished" and "Messi is finished" they're both doing more than most footballers their age, as for this match Juve played like trash no question about it and so did barca yesterday but that doesn't mean that its Ronaldo or Messi's fault. Put some respect on both of the GOATS don't be like these kids having playground arguments and enjoy the two GOATS while we still have them playing on the pitch.
Watch Messi and Ronaldo comeback
Portuguese man of war will win at home ...
Porto FTW! Great job
Mehdi taremi 💪👍 good job man
Chiesa is the only top performer  at Juve atm. The rest only look good in Serie A
Tahremi the 🐐
Irish Guy won't be too thrilled with this one
How did Morata become a professional footballer not knowing what the offsides rule was?
I feel a classic Ronaldo comeback coming up next leg STAY TUNED!!
Anyone know why Dybala does not play?
The USMNT players need to go on loan to lower clubs.  juve barca Chelsea dortmund none are top of the table in their leagues because they keep starting the usmnt players. Look at chelsea. Benching pulisic now they are on a little streak.
lets go Juve !! lets make a comeback !!!
At least Juve got the away goal. They will go through.
Taremi🌟🌟🌟
Why does it always have to be a focus on on one forward? Team is everyone
Nowadays keepers have problem. Hahha
Happy that Juve lost, but 2-1 with away isn't bad to go into the second game
Why are messi and Ronaldo both fucking up it’s not their fault it’s mostly the teams fault
What a smart strategy from Porto. Well played from them. They took advantage of every mistake.
Juve needs a new keeper
Dude summoning his inner Varane on that opening gaff..
People del America: Marchesiiiiinnnnnnnnn!!!!
He keeps looking up and asking, “ why?!”I wonder who’s on his conscious
7:17 Ronaldo aired that shot so badly
Who u guys got for the championship I got psg
"Our team is playing bad, we need a good midfielder/playmaker because right now, its terrible"  *looks at bench*  "Hmm, should I put the obvious choice Dybala...? NAH ILL GO WITH AARON RAMSEY"  WTF, Pirlo out
Pirlo out
You don’t believe in Rigged games 😂😂😂 proof !
No noooo el numero 30 saquenlo para la otra
I am tired of this new style of futbol where they play around the ball with the goalie.  Such easy goals.  Kick the shit out of it and make the opposing team earn the goal.
ronaldo..... hahaha... not worth the money...seriously!!!! totally overrated, lewandowski is 10 times better and doesnt get paid that much...!!!
Yo where’s Jesus Corona’s bicycle kick that definitely should of made the highlights!!!
Psg played very well
Juve Merde
Come on Ronaldo I had a trust on you
Juve had their first shot after 40 mins of the game. WOW
Wait was ronaldo playing?
Why is he not shooting 7:15. Come on
Si hubiese estado cuadrado hay no pasaba ese got de mierda muchos errores de las defensas más el arquero que estaba regalando todo ronaldo no pudo concretar y en la única oportunidad de empatar hace un pase incorrecto habían mejores opciones lastima bien por Porto muy buen partido
No penalty no party
I mean that is an unbelievably good finish 6:20
Messi: losses* Ronaldo: I got you fam
Good job Porto, Juve struggled to get themselves together the whole game - will be an interesting 2nd leg
Pirlo played a very uninspired midfield along with a questionable striker pair, No one was comfortable in their position and with their instructions. This was a pure managerial failure along with a complete disaster of man management at the half.
I'd cam much as I love Ronaldo, he was invisible because of his stupid midfielders Juve have. Messi sexuals acting like he is out, he is not. Ronaldo is still the GOAT. HE WILL TURN THIS AROUND. PIRLO IS SHIT. STARTING THAT UKRANIAN CHADLI OVER MORATA. THE BLAME IS ON THE GK. VS PSG MESSI SCORED A PEN, AND BARCA FANS CELEBRATED LIKE A UCL WIN. BUT WHEN RONALDO SCORES HE IS ALL OF A SUDDEN PENALDO. Porto were better.
Defense just sold
Morata sold
Where tf is Coronas overhead kickz.
Barca fans in here saying shit. Juve will finish off porto at home and cr7 will score. Dont u worry about that. As for messi and barca. Good fucking luck going in paris 😁😁😁😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I dont Care what anyone says... Bentacur is not a good midfilder
I watched the game well the first have only and I want to know why Juventus kept playing from the back they almost got scored on so many times because of that
Ronaldo, swing, and miss. 😂
Shitty Juventus never let me down.
I BLAME PIRLO WITH THIS SELECTION, SHOWED HIS MANAGERIAL INEXPERIENCE... BUT HAVING SAID ALL THAT.. CHIESA MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIS MANAGERS BACON WITH THE AWAY GOAL... AND CR7 LOOKED QUITE OFF THE PACE AND VERY CONFUSED IN LEADING THE LINE WITHOUT HIS STRIKE PARTNER OF ALVARO MORATA.. IJS
Second goal from Porto was class !
Hey show the penalty robbery. Fucking UCL channel cheating Juventus.
i want to see the same slander messi got towards ronaldo
Im a messi fan but this is karma for laughing at messi these past years, this is what it is like to play w a bad team.. not tryna hate but notice how ronaldo declined in CL ever since he left Madrid, you need A GREAT TEAM to win
Yesterday this channel had 190k subscribers now it has 211k amazing
Why is a CB doing a no look pass to the keeper lmao
Lol, I already know Ronaldo was hot on the plane back home. He was probably going off on everybody lol.
Juventus played as bad as their jerseys looks
ronaldo will have to pull them out of this mess like hes done every year
As a Uruguayan it sucks seeing bentancur playing this bad
look at the crybaby penaldo
0:48, I don't know what to say that's some AYSO shit right there.
I respect Ronaldo but the truth is he won’t get slandered for ghosting in Juve’s embarrassing loss to Porto like Messi was against PSG. Messi is always judged by the most unfair and unrealistic standards in football history and that’s why he’s the GOAT
So let me get this straight, everyone insulting Barca and Messi fans, saying Barca lost 4-1 and Messi only scored a pen. I just finished watching game vs Porto and I swear Ronaldo didn’t even shoot once the whole game lmao. Messi got a 8.4 rating last night and Ronaldo got 6.5 . Juve lost to Porto and Barca lost to Champions league Finalist PSG
Both porto goals were like the Fifa kickoff glitch irl
Y’all need to stop hating on Ronaldo for being “bad” Messi is having bad moments too. Now that doesn’t mean he is bad that means they are not in a good moment right now Ronaldo and Messi are not in their best moments
Thank you Szczesny for this lose........
Play Buffon....Szczesny is a disaster send him to poor Poland.......
This proves that neither Messi or Ronaldo can save their clubs
The hoc reminder putatively clap because cheque philly mate up a tasty time. delirious, eager bookcase
LETS GOOOO !!!💙 🤍
Fun Fact: Porto scored both goals of  both halfs
morata was born offside
2 Early Birds got the worm!!
Mehdi Taremi, this guy is legit. Iran have a rly good striking partnership in Taremi and Azmoun atm.
Lose is still lose. All they have to do now is be ready for the 2nd leg. Left leg right leg, I don't care. They just need to do better, specially for Barça.
The era of top clubs is done in my opinion
Taremi 🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷
Messi and Ronaldo had some dead performances
That’s what happens when the coach wants to play from the back their goalies for a reason 😂 they are better with the hands that their feet
Full time  5 minutes later  CBS: Watch Juventus v Porto highlights here!
No penaldo
Mehdiiii!! 💚❤️
🤩🤩🤩
This is exactly how us Barcelona fans feel when we lose.. Y'all just come and start saying pessi finished, pessi disappeared. This could be my turn to say penaldo finished or penaldo disappeared and start mocking y'all but I prefer not To. This is the exact same way y'all get karma so hard. Support the clubs and respect the goats. They are in the final stages of their careers and they deserve nothing but respect.we just need to stop spreading hate. Or always karma will always find it's way to haunt u. This is in regards to both fc Barcelona and juventus fans.
NO PENALTY NO PARTY
Juve may move on but they aren’t gonna win. This game just proves how much juve midfield is trash
What happened to Chiellini is he hurt or what
my question is where tf is dybala?
Bentacourt best player lmfao
Porto do have talented  players who could be on bigger clubs, Otavio, Jesus Corona, Luis Diaz. So the quality is there and I know the team overall is solid so I don't know why people didn't see this coming against an average Juventus midfield and ageing defense ...
1st Messi now Cristiano.
Ronaldo didn’t do shit😂😂😂
Bentencur playing high as fuck.🙃🙃🤪
Donde estann los seguidres del xcomandante🤣
Nice job editing out the most controversial incident of the game. It was a penalty.
Where was CR7 today? 😂😂
No biggie, ronaldo likes to make comebacks.
Juves defense was a disaster I've seen better defending in fornite squads and ronaldos touch was poor, he looked more like an ice skater slipping around the pitch. If pirlo doesn't change tactics I can see Porto knocking them out.
I now get what Juve is called “The Old Lady”
Why would they bench Ronaldo in a champions league game ?
Was ranaldo playing ?
Damn it what happened to cr7 today 😖😖😖😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
That second goal was prime tika-taka Barca
considering how poor Juve played, a 2-1 loss isn't bad. especially with the second leg at home
Didn't they say Pirlo was supposed to be an upgrade from Sarri?
I’d bench that dumb defender. No excuses 1st minute and I’d take him out.
Definitely a little therapeutic for Messi/Barca fans
Wow they didn’t even showed the fault on Ronaldo in the last minute that was clearly penalty
Dude how is no one talking about the fault on Ronaldo in the last minute and the var didn’t care like if it was Barca they would of mark it penalty🤬🤬
Stop treating Porto like a small club. They were the better team today, they have decent players, and deserve some respect.
Ronaldo biffed a pretty good opportunity
Pshh Juve got the 2nd leg Forsure
shit game shit teams
PIRLO IS OVERRATED!!!!
think i'd 8-2 be a barca fan cause their goat might not stay 4-1 more year... juventus fan wish 2-1 the ucl but  might not again
This is for sure what messi  fans needed today
What a ridiculous give-away goal to start the evening, followed by a lame-o goalkeeping display on the second.
Us Bayern fans laughing at the cocky fans of juve n barkalona 😂😂
imagine not beating porto💀
Juve had a bad game but the away goal is a life line, and we have to take that life line and push forward!
i’m gonna be honest my idol ronaldo is not the goat he’s finished. messi is the one and only goat it hurts to say it but it has to be said. i hope my fellow ronaldo fans will agree.
And all the Juventus fans and Robaldo fans were making fun of Messi for scoring a pen... at least he scored and Barca lost to an actual good team lol
Loser loser you said barcelon lose you laugh Barcelona news you love and loser loser j u v loser loser
how embarrassing😂
anyways KTBFFH
this was more embarrassing than barca psg because we were expecting juve to win. also, juve played awful for a good amount of the game.
Ladies and gentlemen... Here present: CASPERNALDO🤣🤣
How are the commentators blaming sczezny at all for the first goal...? That’s 100% on bentacor
Porto actually a great team, they could win this tie
Horrible defense by juve 2 gift goals for Porto but first half they played well with instant pressure and pressing
Why didn’t pirlo start morata?
The best matches in the ucl And next week athletics vs Chelsea.1 epic match! 🔥🤩  Dortmund v Sevilla   Liverpool v lepzig .3.  Porto V Juve .4
Porto is legit
It just hasn’t been a good first leg match for both goats :(
Go Taremi!
Where's the over head kick?
God if messi and Ronaldo get eliminated in the round of 16 it’s gonna be so sad
1-0 and we threw. Calm tf down 😭😭😭
UCL Finals: My Prediction PSG Vs Man City
I feel like juve is just participating in the ucl, not really wanting to win it  year after year, final after final. players except cr7 and the club seem too comfortable just to be relevant.
2:51 That second goal was World class passing! ⚽️
Nice
Who had to watch this game on the Spanish channel
Klopp if he was Juve coach: "Well, bentancur's old team played in blue so he forgot he was playing for juve, but no excuses"
Let’s wait for the 2nd leg!!
Barcelona fans laugh when we just have to score 1 goal not 4 🤣🤣🤣
The ucl this season is pretty interesting very unpredictable
Taremi for Iran: doesn't know which team he is on until the second half Taremi for Porto: Scores in the first minute against Juve
Well, at least we didn’t lose 4-1 home
I told people not to disrespect Porto. Someone said they'd lose 8-2😂😂😂. They're not Barca.
FCP Fucking Champion's PORTO
another shit performance by Juve
Juve played so bad especially the midfield deserved loss
At least Messi score
Where was penaldo
The fact the Juventus got the easiest team in the round of 16 and still lost lol
What a mess
Juve knocked off second leg??🤣
Ronaldo the Casper
Bentancur inspires me to quit my job and play midfield in a top club
How do you have 9 players in the box and still concede.
Tecatito 🙌🏼🙌🏼
The referee was dumbass at the end. 🤬
Ronaldo is coming clutch in the second leg MARK MY WORDS BITCHES
juventus r lucky porto is not an attacking team
I could win $1000 if Juventus wins the champions but their fucking losing to Porto already.. wtf penaldo
Juves defense is suspicious 🤨 the 2 goals were bs
God damn schenzy why tf did he started
No Pen, no party
Messi fans can’t talk shit Messi got blown out vs a turtle ninja Imao
Not a great game at all
Cristiano Ronaldo he played alright but to his standard it was pretty bad but never bet against Ronaldo in the second leg remember he’s the 🐐
Juventus got robbed. 🤬🇮🇹
fellas, this might be the end of Ronaldo and Messi era
Juve played awful 😢 until the 70 minute before that they played awful
The highlights were as fast as Porto's first goal.
Porto might be the dark horses this season…
It was nice to see the uefa cristiano league back
There is still a second leg in which juve can win, so idk why Barcelona’s fans talking cuz they ain’t coming back from a 4-1 result 🤣🤣
Not a big fan of either team. However its amazing to see Marchesin playing in the Champions league, after growing up watching him play for America in Liga MX. Truly amazing!
Ahh now puskas and odegard hide in their shells
So tired of this midfield. How Bentancur has been starting for us the past 3 years is insane.
props for the quick highlights 👏
Don’t worry Juve only one goal!

Both Messi and Ronaldo should leave their clubs tbh

Ronaldo is nothing without Madrid 🤦🏻‍♂️
The end of an era

Flopnaldo thought this was hide and seek
Did Ronaldo even play today? He didn't touch the ball once.
Ronaldo turned into Casper from the 1st minute
Penaldo ghosting 😂
8:19 is this a pen the people in the comments u decide
Wow, they put the highlights up really quick!
Juventus is all physical but have zero chemistry or good talent. Except for cr7.
I still cannot understand how that last chance was not a  penalty. Clear contact in the box. Didn't touch the ball. Where is VAR??
How embarrassing would it be if juve get knocked out by Lyon, Ajax and Porto 💀
That ref was so ass
I knew this will happen🤣 No Penaldo, No Pessi🤣🤣 Both disappeared, it was funny how fans of these clowns thought they will get far in UCL
Ronaldo 2nd leg masterclass loading
Bbva puskas crying rn 🤣
Prime Marega > Prime Penaldo
I was visiting Turin last summer for vacation, I purchased a Ronaldo jersey and visited the Juventus stadium while I’m there Suddenly a force kept pulling me to the penalty spot, I don’t know what happened I started crying and ripped my jersey in half then it finally stopped
💪💪
Penaldo fans making fun of Messi when Penaldo can’t even score against Porto
According to Ronaldo fans since he didn’t score that means he didn’t show up right.
Sit back and watch the flopnaldo fans complain
All the “juve fans” are hiding in their caves now 🤣🤣🤣🤣
wheres penaldo?
So y’all wanna talk about Messi not performing againt big team now look at ronaldo? I better see the same thing. Y’all so dumb expect both of them to carry the team pathetic fans.
Flopnaldo fans making up excuses to why they lost 2-1 against porto as we speak
wheres ronaldo?
Disappointed in the way Juventus played today
Juventus had a good thing going before Ronaldo joined. Ronaldo staying at Real Madrid would be better for Juventus and Real Madrid
Where are the ronaldo fans talking trash about messi yesterday?
Penaldo walking with no goals
CBS speed is greater than the flashs
Shut up ronaldo fanboys this is karma for commenting on the barca psg game atleast we didnt lose to a nobody 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wonder who’s gonna get criticized more if Messi and Ronaldo both get knocked out early
Imagine a team with Barcelona’s defense, Juventus’s midfield, and Liverpool’s forwards
The underdogs winning this season has almost become common. That’s crazy
Juve fanboys crying 😂
Sit back and watch the flopnaldo fans complain
Champions league is so fun to watch!!
marega chain:  marega
Why didn’t penaldo play?
Wow
We got a goal that's all that matters. Gg Porto. See you next leg.
Ade Tovar having a field day rn 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This an example of how juve is a small club.
Penaldo ghosting no pens no goals 😂
second
Hola! Soy Dora! Can u help me find ronaldo?
First
Karma is a bitch Ronaldo fans
Unexpected
Its funny how all the cr7 fans came to the barca comments to say how messi is so finished but Ronaldo can’t even score against porto
Hi
SO FAST!
