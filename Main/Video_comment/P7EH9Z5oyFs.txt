The way he found the music discs and goes like 'NO! ItS Not HAPpenINg AGaiNE!'
0:18 IS THAT A JOJO'S REFERENCE!!!!
‘if you like snow, die.’  techno:
10:00 I CANNOT ESCAPE, THE FRICKING DNF COLOURS
0:32 “D I E”
3:13 AHHH NOT THE DISC,  "it was never meant to be" "Tubbox"  "the discs were meant more that you'll ever be!" "Am I a villian in this story?"  "I want white flags! White flags! By tommorow, at dawn! Or else you are dead!" "I am in a crayon suit, what else do you want from me"  "SYLABLLES"
2:28  PEOPLE STILL SAY POG??

Tommy: gets music disk. Dream has joined the game
"If you like snow, heh, DIE." -Tommyinnit

Tommy: "...MASTER BUILD IDEA!!!" Me: *oh god here we go again*
Don't worry tommy, this is a single player world-dream can't steal your disks
u dont feel like you have life in the thumbnail
Rip Philza's sanity after that🤣🤣🤣
1:05 HENRY MY BOI
Probably because of the Sans sound u used or Those Pixelized talking, or those zombie sounds that might've been copyrighted by someone that made the sound
Abandoning the discs……Tommy has changed
This world is the server with tubo
7:05 fishing is easier tbh
1:06 he was thinking about henry
*coughs IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
Duffle reminds me of henry
big guy is jus an iron man
0:29 die 😂
“You like snow? Die.” -Tommyinnit
He died just like Elsa 😂
Tommy l was just watching pransten playz and one of the camera man tipped in goggle a British turkey and you come up idk why and preasten said preasten”that’s definitely a British turkey “ and l was like that’s disrespectful to you ok
Do you guys know how many tommyinit videos will be taken down If Nintendo found out he’s using their music

TOMMY DADDY I LOVE UOU SO MUCH
1:52 MODERN BASEBALL???
grain mention was not expected
9:55 ah yes, I was there for that
Why is Tommyinnit music such a bop

Peaceful mobs do not despawn wherever
This idiot didn't build up the second the warden spawned
Friendly mobs dont despawn, you don't have to put them in boats
whats the seed
0:31 he he if you like snow, DIE
The thumbnail tho is just spot on
Grass is a type of plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. Their appearance as a common plant was in the mid-Cretaceous period. There are 12,000 species now.  A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the color green. That is because they are wind-pollinated rather than insect-pollinated, so they do not have to attract insects. Green is the best color for photosynthesis.  Grasslands such as savannah and prairie are where grasses are dominant. They cover 40.5% of the land area of the Earth, but not Greenland and Antarctica.  Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants. They include the "grass" of the family Poaceae, which are called grass by ordinary people. This family is also called the Gramineae and includes some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae). These three families are not very closely related, though all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a similar life-style.  With about 780 genera and about 12,000 species, the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family. Only the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae have more species.  The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, basket weaving and many others.  Many grasses are short, but some grasses can grow tall, such as bamboo. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands, including areas which are very dry or cold. There are several other plants that look similar to grass and are referred to as such but are not members of the grass family. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales.  Grasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass, they usually do not destroy the part that grows. This is part of the reason why the plants are so successful.  Without grass, more soil might wash away into rivers (erosion). go touch grass
Chapter:103. A new hope.

This was a year ago??? Omgg
u know u can craft a nametag
2:26 why did i hear something else the first time watching…
Why did Tommy not post more vids on the world
btw passive mobs never despawn, as they spawn from natural generation, duffle does not need the boat
"I HATE TREES"  -A man who hasn't slept in days and seems like he was gonna cry saying those 3 words
Duffle is so cute omg
He should have named the cow Henry 2.0
Heroin is a close second😂😂
cant believe that its been a year since this was published
Just a little fact you didn't have to go to the nether or all of that To find a name tag, you can fish for them...😅😅
I think my cat got stuck inside your flor
2 golems
when you see a warden: AAAAAAAAAHHHHH  I HAVE TO RUN.  me when I see a warden: /me left the game
Pokemon
Pog
SMP live was the phantom menace SMP earth was attack of the clones Dream SMP was revenge of the sith and THIS IS A NEW HOPE
Tommy: If you like snow hEuGH die
I don’t want to die😢
0:03 what is the song name plz
14:12 I recommend that next time you destroy a screecher put wool around it, it is fast and easy.
I love how tommy alway's has pet cow's lol
Duffle pog
Tommy getting PTSD from the disc—
i know this was posted 10 months ago and no ones gonna see this and im so sorry but it wouldve been so much easier to just fish up a nametag
Wow!
"the portal and the table and the huhhhhh"
11:49 Yeah that was my experience with a friend. A whole lot of screaming on his part, and a whole lot of laughing on mine.
This  15:30 min video felt like a 1:50hour movie
Why does he look like that in the thumbnail 💀

Roses are red violets are blue I liked my own comment because no one else wanted to
the fact he could have just gone fishing and gotten a name tag in no time is so hilarious
This is my favourite series of yours
The only person who releases my stress and anger is Tommy.
6:44 SOCUTE

Can tommy not ignore Plilza because it cost him another month to kill that thing
9:58
6:26 average hypixel skyblock player after 7.3 seconds of foarging (they will spend there life savings on cardboard boxes)
That moo in the new pen was so wholesome
When Tommy said, "If you like snow, Die" He just offended probably 10M people
Everyone forgot about technoblade

Tommy. 💀
15:22 love his face when he died lol
I love Tommy bc of his editing style and humour
Hey Tommy start a hardcore series

That’s clickbait 7 days are not 50 hours I think so

Dont be depressed go elsa style💀
I come back to this video every now and then because damn bit T you did a great job with the Opening sequence

Tommy I love watching your videos. You’re really funny. I hope one day I can be a YouTuber like you. I’m on my brother’s account I’m a girl From Popsie
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
If you are terribly afraid of trees thou have dendrophobia
gooba-doobaba-doo
"You like snow" "D I E"  Me: *dies*
sorry
winter is one of my favorite seasons because you can ski and oh boy do i love skiing but now it's not as fun anymore bacause we've moved and that makes me ssaaadsaddda and also my brothers don't, i don't know,  i don't like Summer, to be honest summer is one of the worse seasons because it gets hot and you get all sweaty and YO fingies get all durpy and wet and gooey and gross so you can't use your phone so it's really bad, and the sun gets right into your eyes and it's just bad, but one thing i like about the summer is the rain Even though there are sometimes floods i like it it's kind of cozy and you light some candles and maybe your house burns up. but i kinda get sasaasddasads (but at thje same time happy when ypou asay i shourld die because i like snow in a wierd way, but i do think Jschlatt won when you two talked about hot and cold, NEVERMIND SCHLATT DID WIN AND N OW CANT I TYTYPER >:D
Wait have you watched frozen Tommyinnit😨
Next time bring wool
:(
Okay so 1 hour he was tommy. In 50 he was a warden?? Damn...
The only really wholesome thing about this video is tommy trying to give duffle the best life he ever had
my respect for tommy just went 1 up because he is a builder now
5:22 what's the song here?
That was a foul move from Phil about suggesting the ancient city- 💀
I didn't know tommy did drugs...
Have you never made a snowman before?
no way its Tommy let's play survival
anyone know the song in the back at 5:22?
Tommy building a house that hasn’t been destroyed by anything?
i like how he went to the top of the snow mountain just to dig straight down
Alternative title: Man turns into a ‘Just Stop Trees’ protester
cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolllll
m8 you could have just made a fishing rod to get the name tag
Nice book I have it
Bro tommy really needs fullbright
So he dose not like life
Spanish or vanish
its kind of cute to see tommy say “NO” when he saw cat the disc that will lay in minecrafts history with its fellow mellohi
Tommy never fails to entertain us and put a smile on our faces, admit it you laughed watching this masterpiece.
Dream face reveled 😂
Only huge dsmp fans know what he mean by disc
Me not knowing how to turn brightness on 😅
My name is winter 😂 and winter is not my favorite
10:00 commence DJ-ing
Use the mason
what is the music in the intro? i hear it everywhere but i still dont know the name of it
This editing is ❤❤❤-
NO HATE to ur normal content but this feels like a breath of fresh air getti my to see you be urself, and js talking to the veiwers like we are ur friends :D
Da best
does anyone know the seed
*relaxing noises playing* "All jokes aside though what is a fetis-"
im invested in this video 😮
Is nobody going to talk about the fact that animals dont despawn?😂
U guys ever think that he kindaa looks like thomas brodie (newt) from maze runner...
makeup a part 2
best tommyinnit video
“If you like snow… die”
Wait till Tommy find out that passive mobs don’t despawn
Rip techno
Here are some tips for the ancient city if you dont understand already  The warden has a whopping 250 hearts  The things you said were warden spawners are called sculk shreikers, and if you set it off 3 times, a warden will spawn So you should really get your hands on some swift sneak to sneak faster
The editing makes me feel like I am watching iTMG
_WADAN_
Can I join please please please please please
Ya know how you said "FUCK YOU AND YOUR OXYCONTIN!"  Well I have a question for you buddy, .......        How THE FUCK are you supposed to breathe my guy?! 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
In the words of a great man the horse is my retirement plan but cow you see the joke is tell me you’ll stop uploading the series about duffle if he dies
What is that music at the beginning? I need that
🍎
My name is saeed
Bro can u give me a shout-out
AWESOME
And spawner to get a name tag
3:38 @Grian did you but???
there is no way my man tommy put jojos bizzare adventure part 5 theme song in the video
How do you build tommy's house?
Technoblade liked the snow
ok but like the house is actually cute? kinda love the leafy vibes tbh
Duffle!!!
Hey cool video lol
you did not have to do that sound effect after you said your build would make grian bust LMAO
The cow wouldn't despawn tho
8:02
9:57  this part got me dying 😂
0:31 i completely agree, who likes snow
oh my god, he continues
until then duffle sittting there for eternity
6:48 The way your eyes lit up when he mooed is so fricking wholesome 🥺
Tommy thanks for the idea because my sniffer Boing said that he liked my house and I said 'Twitch for yes and dig for no' and he twitched!
Thats not possible unless he fell asleep at some point he would be dead if he played 7 Days straight- Nvm he said straight I thought no sleep?! im so sorry
New updates suck. 1.16 was where they should’ve stopped it and just improved gameplay, not adding a bunch of new useless crap that makes the game unbalanced and not fun.
Tommy was turning into mr. O’hare from the lorax 😂
11:26  idk why but its so funny
0:30 why is this so funny ahahaha
Duffel is like Henry son
*Tell me, have you ever fell for a joke in your life?* *Wanna know my answer?* ... Read More
man i wish boffy was there with the cow..
lmao so shit
Tommyinnit: *finds music discs*  Also Tommyinnit: *Vietnam war flashbacks*
Bro I am a magnet to caves every time I start a new game I find a cave
this video goes hard
0:16
Tommy said let it die let it die
Seeing Tommy build for real for once makes me (a builder) feel so good
I came from Spotify 😂
If anybody joins the game and you already found two discs there’s gonna be a disc war
ITS SO FUNNNYYY HE AKWARDLY LAUGHED AND THEN SAID DIE
My man fears music disks
Coming back I think this should be a duo world with just tommy and tubbo
Tommy plz macdoesit needs your help don't believe me well you might but don't believe me watch his video
“ if you like snow DIE” my sister “ DO NOT TAKE THAT LITERAL” me *stands there and laughs*
When you forget mods exist for this specific purpose
I think that Tommy should start a hardcore series 😮😊
Im a child and i Survived there 100 days without getting killed. So its just funny watching you a man is more afraid than me…
This is it, Tommy spent some time becoming Wilbur Soot, and now he's entered his Philza arc.
U should  make a duffle plush
so sad
Passive mobs like cows don't despawn
So much of the action in this video is caused by Tommy not knowing that passive mobs don't despawn
He can't even moo-ve around it (:sniffs:)
warden on shoted tommy😂😂😂😂
In under a minute tommy has already told all of canada to die
Tommy: nothing can go wrong Creeper: are u sure about that??? Tommy: ah f*ucking H3ll
I feel sad tommy playing alone.
Tommy: If you like snow, die Me: Ok, I will, but I will die the way I choose (proceeds to freeze in powdered snow)
LITERLY 30SEC INTO THE VIDEO AND I AM OFFENED (not fr he just said die if you like snow and i live in a place where its snows more then its summer and i adore snow but you luaghter)
this video gives me 2019 tommy vibes :)
Turn on brightness ! Me a bedrock player:😐
3:11 when i saw the disc the memorys of dreamsmp come back and im going to be sad and having nightmares for a MONTH
i love thissssss
5:48 dream smp 2
Love the jojo music
"if you like snow *chuckles* d i e" *Technoblade flashbacks*
Tommy i hope the thought that you can get a name tag from fishing crossed over your mind whilst getting one for duffle... i noticed this when i first watched the vid a month ago.
Onegiantonion
Lol I have all those books
Imagine if, after he said no matter how many irl hours or days it would take him, it would’ve cut to “Threee years latel”
Im going to animate this. Love ya Tom ❤😊hope that’s ok
BRING DUFFLE BACK
It’s a terrible house because it is birch simple argument
I really like the more chilled out videos from tommy. hes always been so loud and energetic. i feel like the more chilled out and relaxed tom is way better. idk it feels nice to have a rest from the chaos for a little bit.
Its so easy to find diamonds with the caves and cliffs update
Tommy is the onceler comfirmed?!1?1!
make a no swearing challenge
Duffly the barn?
What music did you listen to
Your epic music is legend of zelda nice

RULE BRITANNIA 🇬🇧
hope this becomes a full series
I just imagine tommy in this video is a politician trying to convince us that he can relate to the regular citizens problems
MAKE A TSMP
The horror disk 3:10
I remember I would build houses with a lot of space and are really big. I even build a 3 story house for myself on one server and for my and my sisters on another. And Tommy is right when he said cutting down trees get boring. But for some reason, it gets somewhat addicting. Edit: I also remember I actually spent hour mining cobblestone to find iron, and it mine I made was so big, it became my new house XD
Pov duffle in 2023 april 22 just walking around saying "i miss you tommy ;("
does anyone know what the song at the beginning is?
Yo Tommy there is a new music disc lmao
"Im team climat change" 1 second later "I want all the trees to die"
Tommy playing hack client lol fabric loader
you should have named duffle's hut the duffle bag lol
why does tommy's face on the thumbnail look like my normal face: as in the eyes look dead and not focused.
If you like snow heh die
You should play undertale and deltarune
How'd a bot get verified
u could put on youtube's music like (GAMING MUSIC) or somth
I just got really worried when Tommy said “If you like snow, *very confident laugh* D I E”     Joke: I like snow
Golden Windddd
". . Of a house so grea it would ake Grian bust."  Grian, on the Hermitcraft server: *"Excuse me?"*
1:04 a legend is born
Redstone isn’t that hard when you started it’s quite easy
"if you like snow, DIE!" says tommy
Wait is this why Tommy commented on that Flowstate video?
Tommy- at 6:00 you cant just walk up to duffle then pull out your DIAMOND sword..
I got Jojo vibes
An infinate amount of Tommy is a very scary idea...
Your are funny YouTubers
This was amazing
This is tommys villian ark.
The duffle house has found its new host
Tommy-Phil is this the mountain they spawn under Phil-NO Tommy-FUUUCK

0:31 Why tf does Tommy want my friend to die
Surprised how this guy still dosent have glasses after staring in front of a computer screen  a week straight
Tommy I've Gotta Tell ya you make some of the best vids on yt
i know its only been a month but it feels so long sense Tommy posted this and we need the net episode of Duffelcraft.
was wondering why tommy wasn't posting as much.. then I saw the end of this video. bros tryna kill the warden
“I even bought this book!”   Me, who’s had that exact same book for, like, 4 years: “I have that book!”   4:44 nice house, Tom. Grian is proud. /hj?   As soon as The Other Side start playing, I instinctively thought of “Sausage - TheOrionSound” in Empires-
is this the start of something great...
imagine when tommy realises passive mobs don't despawn
tbh ur accent make the cuss words betta🤭💅So ThAtS FiNe BOING
Emo
i too recently came across the warden and, us moment, died terribly
where is the next ep!?!?!
Tommy, if you ever create your own SMP I would love to be on it!
“Dont you love losing all your stuff” Me whos a speedrunner- dont you mean getting robbed of world records when you are literally SOO CLOSE TO DO SO. I dont want to talk about it
0:30 If you like snow, heh, DIE.
Play some mods or something, vanilla is boring af now
The Tsmp
Bro tommy has the best profile picture 😂😂
@Dream would love those disks. BTW tommy got the disks the exact same way he did on the dream smp

Butterfly Bush: Not to be confused with butterfly weed, this flowering shrub can grow 8 feet high, producing long spikes of colorful blooms. The plant is drought tolerant and prefers full sun. In warm locations, it can become invasive.
And only ever watch me 😜
If you like snow ha,DiEeeEeE -tommyinnit
Well it's official, YouTube does not let me sub to any youtuber. And I ain't kidding
Tommy still has the urge to get obsessed over discs and the cow like Henry

Rip that threadripper pc you had.
I mean when I zoned out I wrote a school test in dutch and I can't speak dutch

Hey, Tommy. If you see this comment, I'd like to ask you something.  Are you going to be present at the Vidcon in Baltimore? The one taking place late September- early October?

John pork is calling
My friend chose a HUGE snow biome for an SMP. IT WAS SO MUCH TORTURE. So I broke a ton of rules.
This video imo was one of the more boring ones ive watched but I literally COULD NOT click off there is something about Tommys vids that just makes u want to keep watching no matter how non eventful it is...
Hello Tommy, I am from the future and I'd like to wish you an early happy birthday I would put this message on your latest video but it seems that video was very sad so I put it here. Happy 19th birthday how do I know? You and my sister were both born on 2004, and I just realized that you were born April 9 just like me the only difference is the year your birthday is on April 9 2004 while my birthday is on April 9 2012. I don't know I just wanna say we have the same birthday. Hopefully you will be able to see this message also I'm from the Philippines. Again, Happy Early Birthday Tommy! Hoping for you to notice this and to notice my name is Rose and I'm a big fan.
I like snow tho
And he has one friend duffle
He plays the late versions that's why he noticed the changes
Duffle the cow and the spider in that other video should be friends
I remember when this was 9 days ago! Time flies by so fast!
Jk
Tommy play another server like kingscraft server
Tommy
you kinda look like One Giant Onion
My dad said you’re rude😂
Duffle isn't a Mob, he is an animal so he doesn't despawn when you leave the chunks
Really need an update to this
Turn This Into A Series
Tommy! I would sell an organ to see you watch more vids of bbh swearing
Next video idea, War thunder is just... funny!
Are you gordon ramsy's son
Instead of jump in the catalac its you are you are
bro became ishowspeed because mc is now a horror game
I love that he started building, and when he showed what he made you could tell how proud he was. I really liked his building as well, and it makes me want to not delete my world straight after I die the first time lol. The game does look fun!

That’s basically fucking Henry from the smp

Fun fact:7 irl days is 1008 mc days
Tommy talking about the disc war "no I'm NOT DOING THIS AGAIN!!"  also Henry from the afterlife: "damn you got a new cow?"

This video was surprisingly calming, as if you're sat in the room with Tommy himself just watching him play. It was nice to see him play mc with no mods, he still finds ways to make it entertaining <3
You look like heckyl from power ranger dino shatge
how did i ever watch this guy daily
did tommy log on with hax on fabric
for some reason this was really entertaining and nerve-racking. It's definitely the editing that helps

TOMMY GET TOTEMS, FULL NETHERITE PROT 4 AND POTS OF STRENGHT AND REGEN
You are so much funny
dont let him know that cows dont despawn when you feed them
Tommy's relationship with Duffle is rather wholesome, but couldn't he just fished for a name tag instead of spending days grinding a villager?
The warden has 500 HP/250 hearts, which is more than both the wither and the Ender Dragon.  :)

TomathyInsideOfIt was brutally eliminated by the Ancient Warden
Hey, Tommy! You're never going to see this and it's really random, but I really appreciate the time you (or your editor) take to make the captions, as well as make them colour coded. I have hearing issues and sometimes have to blast volume to be able to hear things well, but with your videos I can just comfortably watch at a normal volume while I read the subtitles. Thank you so much!
Why hate trees? The Earth needs them and you need the Earth and without the earth you wouldn't exist
hey tommy! i think ur cute ngl ur also funny
“I HATE trees”  Me and my friend: I agree cus we always bump into them- “ TREEEESS ARS EVIL”
Duffle is a good boy :3
I was so tense while watching it
I loved it when tommy found discs and went in NO mode
I feel like by far the funniest part about this was him not liking the fucking tree for me
😂😂😂😂😂
What is with phils voice acting lol
Sorry Timmy
Do you really think that this pixel set is happy?! IT'S LOCKED UP! JUST LET IT GO AND LET IT LIVE A NORMAL LIFE LIKE A NORMAL PIXELATED ANIMAL!!!!

Finish this in replies:  JUMP IN THE CADILAC, GIRL LETS PUT SOME MILES ON IT
Farming is a lot easier than building since building can contain red stone contraptions and farming is dirt+wheat+water=master

Actually using the villager trade system with a huge farm gets you a shit ton of emeralds and taking the time to build housing and workplaces for an entire village, watching it grow and eventually get 4 golems is such a good feeling.
yeah experiencing caves and cliffs after not playing for like 8 years was a hell of an experience. They actually made spelunking FUN
Hey Congratulations for hitting 13 Million Subscribers Tom!🎉

You look so different 😅😮

So who’s going to be the one to tell Tommy that passive mobs don’t despawn
Duffle gang
I saw you when I was on holiday in England with your mam in a carpark you had a Morrisons shopping bag In your hand
Wait until he finds out passive mobs don't despawn...
I would just like to point out that you don't have to keep animals (cows, chickens, lamas, etc.) in boats. This is because these animals are part of the actual code of the game. They cannot despawn. When you hit "create world" it generates animals the same way it generates land. when you kill these animals, you remove them from the code, remove them from that game, they wont respawn in that world. You have to place endermen or zombies in boats because they are not part of the code, they spawn when conditions allow, and they can despawn just as easily. This is why when you kill an animal you have to travel to find more, and why you don't have to put a ton of boats in cow farms. (don't do this by the way, boats are an entity and if there are too many entities loaded it will lag the game. Same with minecarts)  Thank you for listening to my ted talk.
Play better mc
ITS ADDVENTURE TIME COME ON GRAB DUFFLE  man i miss that show
3:35
This was so friggin entertaining
Grass is a plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the colour ‘green’. Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants.    The grasses include the "grass" of the family Poaceae. This family is also called Gramineae. The family also include some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[1] These three families are not closely related but all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a common life-style.    The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, sprouted grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatching thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.    Many grasses are short, but some grasses can grow very tall. Bamboo is a grass that grows very tall. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands. They can also be found in areas that are very cold or very dry. There are several other plants that look similar but are not members of the grass family. They may also be called grass. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales.    Grasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows.[2] This is a part of why the plants are successful. Without grass, soil may wash away into rivers (erosion).    Evolution of grass  Graminoids include some of the most versatile plant life-forms. They became widespread toward the end of the Cretaceous. Fossilized dinosaur dung (coprolites) have been found containing grass phytoliths (silica stones inside grass leaves).[3] Grasses have adapted to conditions in lush rain forests, dry deserts, cold mountains and even intertidal habitats, and are now the most widespread plant type. Grass is a valuable source of food and energy for many animals.[4]    Grass and people  Lawn grass is often planted on sports fields and in the area around a building. Sometimes chemicals and water is used to help lawns to grow.    People have used grasses for a long time. People eat parts of grasses. Corn, wheat, barley, oats, rice and millet are cereals, common grains whose seeds are used for food and to make alcohol such as beer.

Yes
I love this video, it’s genuine
This video came out awhile ago and tommy, I would like to say this video was GREAT… and like this YouTuber named Tom said there is different values of viewers, and that stands true with this one. This video is genuinely funny

Let's just take a minute to appreciate Tommy doing this for us your so entertaining luv ur vids watched this twice lmfao❤️❤️❤️
Albertsstuff almost got banned for edgy content and saying too many dirty words and racist jokes like Albert calling people fat
Did you know that YouTube came up with strict rules against profanity if you use bad language in your videos they will be removed or demonetized
I love how Tommy stopped himself from saying “fuck” when he saw the spider by saying shit instead
Hi Tommy, I was surprised because when I see a youtube video called dream smp member age you were born 9 april and i was born 9 april but im at year 2014 thank you for reading and i love your videos

I love this video so much, the references, the good nostalgia, the jokes. It's very chill but still very funny and I just smiled the whole way through <3 I'd love to see more videos like this :D
The way he could just fish but instead took hours to get a name tag…😂  But I love the vid ofc 😃
Are we even going to talk about what happened at 4:45
I don’t think a cow despawns when its inside a fence, or just a space they can’t leave. not sure why but they never despawn for me thats why farms work
Fun fact cows dont despawn
Realizing you can just fish for name tags. They’re super easy to get by fishing…
10:00 - Very wholesome, and he's Just Enjoying the little things with Duffle.
he missed out on naming the cow Henry 😭
when you said kurfuffle, something that i hear is kartoffel and it's like you're calling duffle a potato
I would love to see this become a series!!!😅

Tommys in his Pinterest era😅
"I'm going straight into the unknown *elsa style*" got me dying
Little did tommy know, you could stop duffle from despawning with *one* piece of wheat
JOJO!!!!! (continue it)
Why’d you play Giorno’s theme 😰
I like snow 😢
i am genuinely concerned for his life
Tommy the warden is the new strongest boss.
send discord or sheep gonna eat your toes
animals do not despawn if in a captivated area wher they can't walk that mutch. so acording to what i know animals don't despawn if they cant't walk more than 20 x 20 blocks around them so you can make a 12 x12 enclosed space to make it even harder for them to move remember fences and 2 blocks high wall works to butt as long as they are unable to move that mutch is key to prevent despawning , and remeber it MUST be a PERFECT rectangular shaped space i think, if not then I think they will despawn. I have tested this 12 x 12 secure enclosed space and no one have despawned.
when you tomy said you where bored the first day, it realised it wasen't only me who are like this
This was the video tommmy turned Brazilian
I miss Henry
Otherside is the best music disc
Tommy I dare you to visit dream in America.(not joking)
idk why but seeing Tommy act like a child just comforts me
i swear to god tommyinnit, if you dont do a whole lets play on this world again i will personally stab your favorite pillow
he just offended me>:(

JOJO THEME AAAAAAAAAAAA
This One man Said:Mom I'm adopted.

Hi Tommy I don’t know if you remember but you met my auntie Rebecca Taylor and you filmed a video for her daughter Chloe I just wanted to say I’m a big fan
Next week Tommy my dad is working at your house
9:33 Tommy seemed genuinely sad :{
…dont passive mobs not despawn?
The Lore references   Reminded me that the DSMP lore is over 🥲  I started crying  BUT I LOVE THIS 🥰
Dude I just went up against a warden a couple days ago. Let me tell you: he killed me THREE TIMES but I outsmarted him and got all my stuff back. I hate the Deep Dark.
I really thought he was going to give duffle the name Henry,  If you know you know.
Tony stop swering Pls i love your content ❤
duffle wouldnt actually have despawned
part 2 in 2024
Its so special to me when Tommy listens to his music discs and you can see his face light up and especially because of his past with it. 🤭
Favorite freaking video Tom. You do it every damn time.
HELLO TOM ENTERTAINING VIDEO GREAT JOB
14:49 this scared the living hell outta me
I stare at your face the entire time and if it disappears I watch my unattended community guidelines that will not allow me to say the name of a man’s lower half
15:13 how's the score in 4 digits even after trading so much
Ha tommy that’s so funny 😂 climateChange Real you’re hilarious😂
OLD TOMMY VIBESSS
6:57 uhh you know that passive mob cannot despawn right i have a bunch of cows and sheeps and they never despawn only scatter around inside the barn
I just notice he looks like the guy who played Newt in Maze runner
Jojo reference at beginning
Oh Tommy... You can get nametags in so much less time by fishing...
whats risk? DON'T KNOW DON'T CARE LETS GO
despite the chaos this was such a chill video, deffo do more :)
I love adventure time

ls that a jojo ref!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jumped in the Cadillac girl let's put some miles on it.
1:36 Tommy evolved into his final form. A hobbit.
OoOOOooo very scary
14:42 Ok, Imagine this as a Sad-ist animation. Right? Right?!
7 days = 50 hours new math
No Tommy, I don't find you annoying. My only issue is that your br*tish.
my friend is only 2 miles from you lol
"THE RETURN 🔥"
The commitment to giving duffle a better life and the completely ignoring Phil's warning is the most Tommy thing.
Lol I love your YouTube and I’m sub and like for you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
4:52 4:54  hahaha
Stop cussing you teen
11:43 I thought you said you weren't scared of anything but waking up in the morning😂😂
Play GTA katit rosie
If tommt videos continue like this he would be the most nostalgic youtuber in some time, even do he is
get netherite armor
LOL^(319)
P
Good luck tommy and a little help do not make any noise after because it does respawn if you make noise :)
Warden more like send tommy to the hospital ward
Duffle is the most wholesome thing ever
I liked the solo and my chill video, you should do more

Hi😂
tommy this is unhealthy
not the warden 😂
Please read this: I'm sure you've heard of the Willow Project (If not please inform yourself) Anyway it's pretty bad if this is done and would really hurt the earth. That's why it would be so important if you could sign at websites collecting signatures against this project. Thank you for reading. (Would be cool if you could repost this text so more people would know about it :)) (Sorry if there are any mistakes, that was translated with google translator haha
Get your stuff then bomb the place
since when do animals despawn
the jojo theme made my day, and a tip, if u want to dry the world of oxygen you could acctualy rip the entire ocean of their seaweed who  indeed give O2 for the entire world, around 60% if im not mistaken
I am sure he will not win the warden by a 1v1 instead a trap to kill it
COWS DON'T DESPAWN
If u use a bow and go from a hight u can kill one pretty easily
He didn’t need to put him in a boat
Only 7 days straight? HA! Amateur.
Tommy: "I'm gonna kill the Warden!" Me: "Y- you do realize that the Warden has 250 hearts (that's 500 health- more than the Wither boss and the Ender Dragon combined) is immune to fire, lava and knockback, and can kill you in two hits with fully enchanted netherite armor as well as it has a sonic attack that does similar amounts of damage that also deals knockback?" Few tips for ya Tommy (that is if you see this comment and don't already know this info.) When it comes to the Warden, it has no sight, and relies on smell and sound. If one spawns, stay crouching and move to high ground that it cannot follow. This keeps it from touching you and killing you almost instantly. Then, use wool, not deepslate or cobblestone. Wool is the only block that does not produce a sound that objects and mobs of the deep dark can hear. It's a mechanic called "wool occlusion." Your best bet if you spawn a Warden is to, like I said earlier, get to high ground fast, but silently (i.e. nothing but crouching and do not place blocks other than wool) after you get up, place wool around you so you have it around you on three sides and a wall on the fourth side. Wait for the Warden to walk up to you (it can smell you) and dig carefully into the wall. The wool should stop the sound and allow you to dig without the wardens sonic attack going through it and killing you. Just get about 20 blocks away (or mine until the darkness effect clears and mine about four or five blocks further) and wait silently. The Warden will lose track of you and eventually despawn in a minute or so. As for the blocks that spawn the Warden; they are called Sculk Shriekers and only trigger if a sculk sensor (the blocks you found first that made noise when you placed a torch in this video) activates within a certain range (I do not specifically remember the exact range) or if you interact in any way with the inside of the top of the block. If you stand on it, it will trigger, if an arrow from a bow hits it, it triggers, if an item hits it, it will trigger. Your best option is to either cover these blocks in wool, or break them and make sure the sound wont trigger other shriekers via the sensors. As for where I have found this info; most of it I have googled, but all of it I have tested. I made a little testing area in my survival save as I want to build a base in an ancient city, and knowing everything I can learn about the foes that spawn there is important for that to happen. Also, the Deep Dark and Ancient Cities are coded so that no other mob (aside from the Warden) can spawn under any circumstance. This means that if you remove every Sculk Shrieker, the Deep Dark becomes the safest biome in the game aside from the mushroom island biome. Thank you to anyone that read this, sorry for the wall of text.
pls do irl vids!!!
blox fruit
blox fruit
Oi tommy i recommend you playing devil may 5, it's real fun.
Yo guys a Zombie video is being made by Tommy and I am not lying (also my dad is helping with the footage
The Warden is a special mob that can only spawn in the Deep Dark. It is incredibly tanky, having 500 health points (250 hearts) — equivalent to the Ender Dragon and Wither combined! It is also remarkably strong, as its melee attack can deal as much as 22.5 hearts of damage if you're playing on hard mode
w intro
That house is sick, Tommy
I can't wait to see the next episode! Love it.
11:05 ADVWNTURE TIMW COME ON GRAB YOUR FIRENDS WE GO TO VERY DIATANR LANDS
JOJO
The vibes of this video, the editis, the music.i cried. Subscribe to this man imedeanlty!
Im pretty sure farm animals don’t despawn evening they’re not in a boat or without a nametag
have a 30 minute or 1 hour countdown like the one at the natural disasters one but have nothing else different like at the end nothing happens
Can someone please tell me the starting background music name
when he entered the ancient city I was ''ON MY TOES'' kind of scared
Tommy never fails to give us fun content to watch
its good to see tommy just play the game with nothing
You need to set tubbo on fire, you said at the video:"i marrid tubbo"
Tommy is returning to the old ways of miecraft vids
Damn tommy is such a guy, he built a hole mansion for his pet. Cant wait for the next epi❤
I cant believe he is going to be 19 in less than a month.
Tommy I Just Realised Ur Birthday Is The Same As Mine
I CAN BE A TOMMY INNIT FAN BECAUSE MY COUNTRY DOESNT EVEN HAS SNOW! YIPEE!
So when I notice Tommy was got slain by Warden, My feelings *Would He consider to be friends with Warden ?*  The Answer is   no
ur birthday is coming happy birthday tommy
Hi
Disk: *pops into inventory* Tommy: Oh dear god no- NOT AGAIN YOU FOUL OBJECT!
am i the only one who get the jojo reference LMAO
Yk that 7×24=168  So the thumbnail is wrong
I can’t believe you managed to go in blind so long after the update came out. Definitely the best way to experience the Ancient City, me and my friends were shitting ourselves the first time we went down there too. Loved the video!
I miss Technoblade 😢❤
Wow, what a great video
So who’s going to tell him that passive mobs don’t respawn.
Technoblade dies
I love the new quality of the vids. Keep it up big man.
Has Tommy forgotten that mineshafts have many diamonds💀?
Tommy is a good narrator
You Bi ??
Bro I miss the dream smp
4:19 Only watching you *is* using contraception
elsa style
Adventure Time! Come on, grab your friends! We're going to very distant lands to fight The Warden in the mines! I am going to die- In Minecraft~♪
How much is Tommy paying his editor to make a 15 minute video using 168 hours worth of footage
Just listened to Comforting Memories, got teary-eyed man. Thanks for helping me reminisce on my childhood/adulthood Tommy. Keep doing what you're doing.
more pls
3:39  made me bust
when he played that disk i was like NOSTALGIA
he took so many hours to get a nametag from a villager when you can just fish for them and it kills me
Tommy, you know you can hat name tags from fishing right?
Am I the only one who lost my mind when Tommy said the heroin was a close second HOW DOES HE NOW WHAT HEROIN IS LIKE
Doesn't the warden have like 500 hearts?
but why
what the fuck why is the font like this
IT WOULD MAKE GRIAN WHAT?!!?!?!
tommy do you know what happens when u put a parrot next to a jukebox playing music ? its funny but also quite cute at the same time.
cow :3
Tommy: Where are you supposed to find nametags? Me and 1.3M other viewers: Fishing or shipwrecks Tommy: Fortress chest 👁👄👁  ➖👄➖ 👁👄👁
eLsA sTLyE
you can make duffles base 20x20 at max and you wont have to keep him in a boat, he wont despawn :)
Hypixel Skyblock players: if only he knew
Tommy did the disc's really mean something to you back then..? Like when dream took them.? Or were you just acting...?
Tommy can i please have a invite to the discord server
Tommy and duffle have me heart
first vid i’ve watched of this kid and i’m hooked, your sense of humor is unmatched
The Jojo music was peak
POV you're still waiting for the next part
I love you tommy can you please pin this 😊❤
that mining bit is exactly what it feels like to mine in caves on bedrock on an ipad with a bluetooth xbox controller
6:48 this was so cute the fact Tommys face lit up immediately
Tommy: F*ck you and your oxigen!!!(Meanwhile trees are the reason he's still alive)
And can you plz stop cussing
Hey tommy are you 19?
This is awesome! Just the right amount of chaos and chill
Into the unknown,✨Elsa style ✨
MORE MORE MORE
The Jojo music tho
Tommy dont try to kill the warden my friend and youtuber nameded beppo lost there hardcore world the warden is the strongest and qnd it always will be
Btw, the Warden respawns even if you kill it…
What is the seed
Legend said he’s still playing
love the more chilled out vibe
You can get a name tag pretty easily from fishing. It can be boring though if you don’t enjoy standing still and looking at bubbles but I personally enjoy it.
The intro was a Jojo Reference..
who still remember technoblade
Your the best
LONG LIVE DUFFLE!!
*sigh* don’t worry Tommy I always give my farm animals roofs in the middle of the night too…how may times was I killed…a lot…did I care, a little bit…but was it worth it? Yes..yes it was
I'm 6 minutes 58 seconds in.  Someone tell me, when does the cow die
When Tommy will realise that Duffle wont actually despawn if he is not in a boat...
Why are you not John_Fortnite’s friend?
destroy that music disk right now
I’m saw the queen of England by Tommy because he say “if you like snow die”
But, the house is made out of birch   Why?   Btw farm animals don't despawn if you feed them
Jojo reference????? Yoo bro is blond like Giorno and has Giorno’s theme
"so good it would even make grian bust" "  "splewsh"
0:39 congrats tommy you just prob lost the gay and environmentalist crowd (not me) I thought it was funny
my favorite part was when he put on the name tag for Duffle, so wholesome. PART 2 PLS IM BEGGING
I will be the one to mention the discs and laughing in class makes me look somewhat crazy but worth it every single time 😂 😎
The only way to kill the Warden is to cheese it. You can’t fight him legitimately, you have to do something like trap him in a trench and then shoot him while outside the range of his sonic blast, or use a fishing rod to pull him up over an never until he dies of fall damage.
Rip to Tommy that he didn't know he could just feed a cow some wheat and it won't despawn. 😂😂
HE LOST THE NAMEEEEE TAG!!!!!!!!!!!!
this gives me pewdiepie vibes with the whole duffle thing and its gunna be a banging series
Bruh u just need to feed him a wheat and duffle would stay forever loool
This was amazing
The music made me distracted
And my Video idea is gone
That's crazy :D
i missed mc tommy
12:13 This part literally feels like a movie! He's about at his end, given up his whits. But the realization...what he had been looking for was from the start.
honestly i widely prefer this style of content and editng, keep it up!
If tommy did more vids like this and didnt swear he would prob make really reslly good content.
sing jump in the cadilac
tommy always makes my day better. His videos are extremely funny
9:08
dude we are never going to see him again LMAO
ok but why is this just such an amazing video! it makes me want to watch it again and again. Hopefully we get another one!
Oi mate , are wii gonna have a problem?
you are crazy. this is why I like you
I want tommy to get grian to swear
Fishing for a name tag is easier than getting it from the fortress or villagers though right
Couldve just fished for a nametag, ngl
Why he so rude? and swearing? i hate it man. but i still liked your video. it funny and STOP SWEARING
the intro gave me so much nostalgia
13:59 the what now?
It’s strange seeing him just play the game. I like it
First 40 seconds of the video. Let’s get a fuck tree chain
I would have loved to join you 😅 WHY FUCK DOES THAT SOUND WIERD THE HELL?
this my first time pickin mc shit back up in over a year of gettin kinda butt fucked by this whole community and i wan say i think Tom has kinda jus chilled out some. this a more mature video than most of the things ive seen the dude in and i hope he goes further with this as his jokes have actually gotten funny in the year of not watchin him. keep this shit up please
Jojos reference.
IMAGINE TOMMY LIKED THIS COMMENT BRO 😭😭(please if you don’t like this my self esteem will not prosper
This is depressing 7 days is just sad bro
Tommyyyyy I just learned that your birthday is the day after mine!!!
Duffle gave me flashbacks to Henry
Jojo references everywhere
moo-ve around it.
He’s gonna get hacked by sap so and have duffle killed
Cows.. Cows don't despawn..
Me who already has nightmares
am I the only one wondering abt him saying he did drugs
Hey Tommy I just watched a yt short saying that it was Dream that was sad because he never could be outside with his friends because of his masked identity. Since he now is having his face revealed, you should hang out with him :)
"If you like snow... die" 😂
Tommy you might not ever see this and its really random but this is the first time I started watching you again ever since technoblade died
9:54 honestly this Makes me really sad
Could’ve went fishing for the name tag it’s so easy 😂
This video was so wholesome and fun to watch <3
this made me genuinely so so happy i missed this so much
Duffle is God
What's the song that plays at the start?
It’s weird to think that tommy has only ever built dirt houses
I really enjoyed this!!
genuinely enjoyed this video a lot. I'm excited to see where this series goes!!!
Duffle is life, Duffle is love
You dont need a name tag for animals like cows
What music you using in the beginning
ok but can we talk about how Tommy is actually a pretty good builder???
i just know he had butt sores after this week
this video was so wholesome, looking forward to more vids like these. Second vid to thissss???
Wow
tommy: sees the fricking warden slowly approach it clearly giving him time to run away but stands in a spot scared and confused then eventually dies also tommy:HOw Did i diE?!
I like how he says he will kill warden yet he cannot be killed
This is why my husband and I bring night vision potions down their
<3 duffle
1:13 Tommy's love of animals really reminds me of this kind man I met in Enumclaw Washington once in 2005. Good times
“This gives children nightmares.” Yeah, no s#’/. You have no idea how many times I woke up in a cold sweat because of this thing.
Is it just me or does this dude look like the lady from the take on me music bideo
...wh- mr.beast?-...
Woah you do look as crazy as meatcanyon does show in his video.
Tommyinnit x jojo confirmed
he should really try medieval mc fabric
Tommy go shower
Cows, Pigs, Sheep, Chickens etc don't despawn if they're in an enclosed space / pen
Yooo I love the new style of video! :)
I could never do this broooo
Can u say a dad joke in the beginning of ur next vid
Best video you've made on this channel for a while imo, really good job :)
I'm embarrassed of how much I laughed at that elsa joke
i love this style of video man ! it just feels so effortlessly entertaining :))
Hi
THIS might gonna BE a cool series i think
bro this man has a huge mouth
Tommy: im gonna name you duffle  *Tommy minutes later*  Tommy: ive farmed for HOURS, and i finally got to name you duffle so you dont unspawn, i also built you a home cuz i farmed lots of trees, i love you my friend duffle :D
Please tell me the name of the music at the beggining
He sacrificed the     GIRLFRIEND!!!!!
As a Canadian I take offense to 0:30 (all jokes dont hate on me ;-;)
YESSS HE'S BACK BABY
I now want a fanfic of this and it be one where he goes to defeat the warden because all of those creepy sounds are perfect for a horror fic
Good luck tommy
Thought he was gonna name him Henry...
What is the song called playing at 2:30
Tommy looks so happy about LITTRALY sitting and doing nothing for a week straight 🏧
You can't hide from them the disc will always follow tommy
not a good idea me and my 2 friends tried it and we all faild and it was worrable
Tommy and his cows is so cute and wholesome like omg 🥺
ugh now I want to play
The fact that cows don't despawn even without a name is crazy
whos going to tell him that peaceful mobs dont despawn
Tommy why…
Just remember that otherside is just as rare as a notch apple
duffle.
Snow bad? I live in Alaska!!!!
YOOO THAT WAS AWESOME
U still suck at PvP😂😂😂
i dont watch youtube but when I do i always look for tommyinnit <3
Giorno’s Theme in the beginning:
Such a good video
7:34 el dreamer
Ayo cuuuh
Big Q is making a Qsmp
bro could’ve just gone fishing😂
soon to be prezident of the united states.
1:52 Serbs getting flashbacks 😂😂
That editing was gold tbh
UR A CHILD AND U SWEAR EVERY 10 MINS
I havent seen the ancient city, and that terrifies me XD I am never going there
Not to sound rude or anything, but either this was inspired by SB737, or copied. I guess it was inspired, but just so everyone knows
GG u found diamonds
Duffel is in Belgium
Naw man I live in Minnesota snow is my life
Why doesn't he just fish for the name tag tho???
Why is this video soo GOOD its GOD TEIR invite him to hermitcraft or do a dream smp hermitcraft cross over
This is your best video ❤
Not to be mean to my but, i think you got your math wrong.. I mean I honestly don’t thing 7 days = to 50 hours but okie
I love videos like this, tommy should upload more of this series :D
This video screams  ✨ Wholesome ✨ 😭🤚🏻
should we tell him cows dont despawn
That's a pro mine craft player
His grown up
whats the seed
Tommy, you should use shaders in your videos
Tommyinnitt birthday is Easter
This man has the voice of an angel
What do you call a female dog
You should have made him a home that looks like a bag and called it the duffle bag
i laughed when he got killed by the warden 😭😭
This is such a great video 👍 like genuinely one of the best videos of your channel for me
With patience and commitment that's how you'll win in long run games
Ok then, 👦🔫
ok
That was too cool
STOP SAYING BAD WORDS 😡😡😡OR I WILL UNSUBSCRIBE FROM YOU
Day 70: of asking tommy to remake his pfp
no one talks abaout leggings
Tom sorry to break it to you, but you suck at building - like how this shit took ypu so long  Ps:Ur still my fav streamer ily❤
you know that if you just feed Duffle some weat he wont despawn right?
Tommy jojo fan confirmed!
Jump in the cadilac
British fuck jk I’m Russia
this is cool to see👍🏻
He's going straight after Mr.Beast
I can’t be the only one who thinks Tommy still looks like he did when he was 13 😂
i will cry if duffle dies
Henry and Duffle would get along well
i miss dream SMP when will DSMP season 2 come out
you seem very healthy happy your okay
Tommy: I'm gonna kill the Warden 3 seconds later: Tommyinnit died of the Warden
tommy looks so lost its like hes playing the game for the first time LMAO..
JESUS CHRIST LOVE'S YOU ALL BTW.
Bro he js actually pretty good at building
Alternative title: Tommy grows sadder and sadder
Place the logs and then strip them instead of stripping and then chopping them down.
I like to think that this is canonically how tommy spent his days after the events of what we saw in the dream smp
"If you like snow, D I E"
i think a small beard would make u more handsome
RIP Technoblade he never dies love form India
Sigmas In Ohio: 😬🍷🍷🗿
😮👍🏻
tommy the buggy
him using a JoJo song in the beginning took me out at the knees
You spent more days, months, yet even years playing this. What is the point of making a video yourself doing what you do all the time except less?
I just unsubscribed to your YouTube channel reasons you lost a dime 🙀🙀🙀
Wow bros a extremely high level of 😢
When he played the memories came back and I started to tear up 😅
Every time I go onto anew world and go mining I always find an end city and I don’t know why
please make this a series
besides the fact this was posted on my birthday, this is the perfect tommyinnit video
LIVE THE BEST BIG MAN! ❤
Pffft I can do better
Tommy: *gets a pet cow* Me: Oh no, I'm getting deja vu  Also Tommy: *finds music disks* "NOT AGAIN!" Me: *long, deep sigh*  Tommy again: *decides to seek out the ancient city with ZERO knowledge* Me: I'll give 10 minutes, MAX before he's dead *later* yeah
Finally some good content on youtube. 10/10 would watch again.
Y'know Tommy,  you really do deserve every bit of fame that you have. Not only are you funny, smart and creative but you seem like a really good guy
go touch some grass lol
Tommy is the kinda guy to look at a tree and says "Anyone's gonna mine that?" and not wait for an answer.
ligit the best video in a while, relatival to
TURN THIS INTO A SERIES NOW :)))))))))
Me: *Likes Snow* Also Me: *Dies*
The smile at the thumbnail is the face of a man who is too old for this
I REALLY like the editing style of this. There’s a sort of storyline and build up to everything, like we are exploring the world with him. The sound isn’t loud and the vid is short but detailed! Please continue this series it seems awesome       BUILDERINNIT???
hi tommy im subbed have a good day cheers
The first person to reply is gae
This is actually pretty fun Im excited for the next ep
didnt know this man could build things not made soley of cobble and oak...  also whos gonna tell him he coulda just fished a nametag
Very inspiring
Now do this exact same thing with friends
yk seeing Tommy build things like this is shocking cus he normally builds simple things
LETS GO TOM
Fun fact cows dont despawn LMFAO they dont need a boat or nametag
The absolutely amount of effort dedicated to a mob that doesn't despawn was very funny to watch
Passive mobs dont despawn lol
My fav vid in a while, good job my dude
the disc arc references are everything
this was a very nice relaxing video to watch and it was very entertaining, would love for this to be a series
Tbh i watched the entire thing cuz if the jojo reference
Keel ur self
And heroin is a close second best line of the video
I play genshin impact and I touch grass more than you
was not 7 days straight
1:12 oh i tough you weakness is jump in cadilla-
This video is actually so sweet😭😭
tommy you can just go fishing for a name tag-
if duffle dies im gonna cry
I'm so glad to see this type of content can still be successful :)
This is like if LukeTheNotable was Tommy and I love it
You could've fish for a name tag
Tommy has grown as a person and as a YouTuber. It's amazing.
im really hoping that was a deliberate adventure time reference
Bruh, there are no kids in your channel because you say bad words!!!!!!!!!
this was really just all for Duffle <3
I love snow.
Tommy you should play the TrixyBlox's Ultimate Survival World
Redo jump in the Cadillac
I find it hilarious that Tommy, in all his years of playing, doesn't know that passive mobs can't despawn if their wander space is less than 20 blocks.
this is my favorite video from you so far😍
"Fuck you and your oxygen"  fishes couldn't agree more
i like snow+rasio+skiing
Tommy's building style is really pretty, it's cool to see this since i spent hours frustrated that he would never build a real home on the dsmp lol
No one except this guy when the homies say touch grass:
How did he have such a hard time finding an ancient city when everytime I decide to build my house somewhere it's always right under it.
F you tommy I'm from Canada
Whos gonna tell him the cow wouldnt have despawned
Lol you grinned for how many hours and you can get a name tag by fishing 🎣
I hate snow
addons? you mean updates?
Hypixel skyblock when?
fishing gets nametags im pretty sure lol
Loving the new style man!
whatch mr stokes tv
You know that thing you to pick a year ago and when you do it again with bad
Okay, this is cool, I can assure that
Is no one going to tell him cows don't despawn?
Hola Soy Mau 😃😀😁🙂😐🤨
so are we just gonna ignore the fact that he said he has done DRUGS??? Like, he mentioned HEROIN- THE POOR CHILD😭😭😭😭😭😭
Tommy was so shocked about the caves because it was always Phil mining
You should watch Phil’s vid he did where he did experiments with the warden, it shows how strong he really is
Finally, a classic play-through/adventure series is back!
Tommy just looking into nothingness is way too funny😭
I love snow <3
15:24 just use *end crystals*. They are one of the only easy ways to kill the warden. (The others being like *respawn anchors* or other lethal weapons or traps.) If you want more of a challenge hen try to name and *trap* a Warden.
Excited for next episode!
You should’ve took a fishing rod to get the name tag
What’s the seed
9:54 when you're just chilling with that one out of pocket friend
We need a vod of the whole thing
The ancient city with brightness all the way up looks so sick in this video
Moo've😭
tommy gets vietnam flashbacks after seeing a disk
11:06 we'll go to very distant lands
the music disc part at 9:48 made me tear up a little 🥺💜 all the memories came flooding back
I never felt this empathetic to a video. I felt it every bit 😭
Tommy when seeing discs:   NoT HaPPeNInG aGaIn!
this is the best Tommy video in a while
It's a friendly mob, it doesnt despawn
I love watching wholesome tommy actually having fun in the game
Oh no dark caves with no brightness mods man it would really suck to not have that
“If you like snow, *D I E* “  That joke was not thought out well….
Good job Boss man
i'm hearing a lot more jojo's themes in tommy's videos, is he just now getting into it?
Respect for using the Spirit Tracks music at the end
I enjoy how you spend hours looking for a ancient city and in one of my worlds at spawn I had 2 next to each other in the same mountain
*DUFFLE IS LOVE DUFFLE IS CARING DUFFLE IS LIFE*
A new BEEF Duffle x Henry
Get a job lazy Bs 🤢
I Love that your The old Tommy again and came Back to your roots
Tommy use splash of slowness potion to slowdown warden.Its give you a chance to Get lots off hits on it.
the first time i went there i just put down a bed on the top of the portal looking thing and only brought my axe, then I just kept bum rushing my way threw and continuously attacking the warden after it killed me lmfao
but literal eye ligma
Yes
Mr bean if he was british
9:50 yea
Surround the chests in wool before opening them and make wool paths everywhere so you don't make noise
Dude this is so good!!
6:50 nice
5:40 the disk
4:24 lol
Tommy just added a anime theme
gay
I really hope this becomes a full series or that you start streaming it. I'm obsessed
Crazy idea: spawn the wither to fight the warden and a bunch of Iron Golems. Also you might wanna bring the warden back to the surface and then fight there away from the ancient city
Tommy...... Techno liked snow biomes....
This was your best video of the past year, comforting af.
BITS DON'T NEED OXYGEN. BREATHE VAPE
On trending!
I ❤ duffle
Should we tell him about powdered snow, cause THAT is a real nightmare
great video tommy
17:14
Name your cow Henry
Try amplified soon
U realise the boat technic is only for hostile mobs right . ... right 😦
love your videos, keep it up tommy
INTO THE UNKNOOOOWNNNN INTO THE UKNOWWWWWWN
2:10 (literally two minutes into the video) "i woke up and realised im getting bored!!"
W video ngl
duffle, beloved <3
PLEASEEEEEEE do more of this
WOOHOOOO
love this type of video :)
not the disc 💀
I refuse to believe this man still says poggers in 2023
It's the giorno theme song for me
5:47 history repeats himself
you should try the seed called 8003843 it has a village, a mountain with iron  and coal, a ruin portal , a spawner  and some other things near it. you could make it your own server , where only your friends and you can play , i really suggest it. you dont have to but it would be fun if you did.
Pro tips go mine for iron and emerald in the fricking mountain
I wanna watch the full version
Just saw Tommy by the i360 (Brighton town centre)
Just saw Tommy by the i360
*gets discs*  ...  NO DUDE ITS NOT HAPPENING AGAIN
Dude, your house looks awesome!
Carpet
ay sorry to break the news but passive mobs like cows dont despawn
If you feed duffle some wheat he wont despawn
6:55 song plzzz
Wow epic
Bro the way he could’ve fished for a name tag 🧍
WE NEED PART 2 NOW
Hermitcraft:   . "Pathetic"
🤓
:O
3:25 what about farming redstone
Duffle.
Goodluck with killing the Warden seriously... It's still extremely difficult with full netherite armor with enchantments on it. I think it can kill you in three or four hits. So Goodluck o7
Mr Beast crying cuz of Tommy cutting down tree's. @Mr Beast
Tommy: if you like snow, die Me: *dies*
Oh god the discs
lmao tommy thinks hes a no lifer on mc, other mc ytubers "I spent 7,000hr to get this stick"

Hi
Tommy just woke up and decided to bring back letsplays like from 2016, but much better edited. Nice
Believe Jesus is the Son of God. Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord. Read the Bible! ❤
What is the intro song
he fell off
steak yummy
the cow didnt need a nametag just a fun fact that may make all those hours seem like they were wasted
We know Tommy's history with Cows. Do not let Sapnap join.
YESSS I LOVED THIS VIDEO!! cannot wait for the next episode, this style of content really suits you
I am so excited for this series to start
Bro tommy turns off the brightness and dies even though I always have the brightness down
Play with shaders
Is That Theme A JoJo Reference?
OmG is tHaT JojO nO wAY 0:20
MORE … I WANT MORE
if you like snow *chuckle* die. - Tommyinnit, 2023
The sentence of ‘fuck u tree,I don’t like u ‘is amazing!!
kid lmao
Tommy get a dog and name it duggle so it rhymes with duffle
Its fun seeing tommy not paying attention to phil saying that there is a risk
passive mobs like cows and Duffle dont despawn, you went through all that trouble for nothing
well passive mobs like cows chicken pigs and sheep don't despawn i guess unless its an hostile jockey
That's a bad idea
the "ELSA STLYE" caught me off guard
6:59 "moo-ve" TOMMY MADE THE MOST SHITTY PUN 🤣😂
cant wait for the next one, this one convincingly wholesome and funny 🎉
Now he gota do the i spent 5 days straight sleeping chalange
Hello Tommy 👋 idk why I'm saying that even though tommyinnit won't reply saying hi back.
If duffle ever dances we should call it the duffle shuffle
our air is mostly nitrogen
im so happy to see this solo type gameplays, it really lets shine his own personal type of humor
WHEN WILL YOU POST THE NEXT EPISODE??
I MISS THIS TOMMY ERA
I love how tommy just get duffle a name tag how adorablee
Never had a cow despawn on me ever...
U should try hypixel again
5:46 lol
I found out through trial and error the best way for you to kill the warden. If you have a God apple you are probably going to need it, but use potions such as turtle master, strength, regeneration, then weakness on the warden so it doesn't hit as hard
i believe in you tommy!!!!
Bro. YouTube literally straight up unsubscribed me from this chennel. And a lot of others too. I thought that's just a joke
Do you watch jojo?
I got scared when it started getting louder because i thought tommy was turning up my phone volume its 2:40am and everyones sleeping so started to panic now my phone volume is next to off
The fact that tommy found not one but TWO Disks on accident lmao😭😭
чувствуется стиль перпла немного
It's amazing watching tommy being wholesome.We need more chill videos like this one for sure
I cant wait for the next video honestly
this is shit how do u not know the warden is one hit???
Yo when u continue this world, u should prob get at least diamond enchanted, a few gapples and totems to defeat the warden, maybe a bow too idk :)
That... Is definitely NOT healthy sir-
Achievement made: serious dedication
<3
Tommy just a little tip farmer villager gives more emerald with melon farm <3
CAN ANYONE ANSWER??? IS TOMMY'S GF THE LACTOSE N TOLERANT CAFE GIRL???
We need a hardcore series
RIP tree 0:00 - 0:42
Tommy: Not real ones tho, only pixle ones  Me: that sounds like my love life
pains me to see you using villagers to get aname tag when you could've just gone fishing and found them lolll woulda been quicker and esasier
Tommy in the 2 week grind 💪
the phrase "if you like snow, d     i     e" hits different when you remember techno lived in a snow biome
5:06 - 5 :17 Door!!!
1:05 Henry.... :( 3:10 damn, they really said "for the rest of your life I'll be there"
Yessss!Tommy SMP is coming! (maybe)
Yessssss
bet that duffle has a bag too called dufflebag
Tommy: When did the world get so big I meant to be a big man WHY AM I SO SMALL!!  Also Tommy: I know I didn't want to really stay in the snow biome because they are absolutely terrible if you like snow  *chuckles* (D I E 😂)
THE CREEPEE KILLING HIM IS SO EHDHWOABQOA
This is awesome cocnnetent sir
God I love English people.
jumpscare at 7:36
do pt2 please
You know its a good day if Tommy posts 😁
this the least chaotic most wholesome video of Tommy I've ever seen :D
this is a good slight change of pace tommy, twas a good idea :)
Love Ur vids
Wow, that’s pretty fucking amazing there. Your parents must be awfully proud of you.😃
I think it’s really gotta be playing with people that makes literally any game ever fun
YES A NEW EPISODEEEEEEEEEE
I can’t wait to see the set tubbo on fire video because he hit 12m
The name “duffel” makes me feel odd saying “duffel bag”
Tommy trying to build is so cute. But I can't help but feel its going to make the Grian and Tommy comparisons skyrocket.
technoblade would be proud of you lad
If you didn’t have diamonds yet for an enchanting table then how did you get tree leaves in your house
9:55 lol
I swear in the part where Tommy gets Vietnam flashbacks due to the music disc made me laugh so hard my family was looking at me like i was some mentally unstable child
For example notnico quited his channel he created a new one. Named Nico
Hi. Hi. Tommy I love❤ your videos🎥  keep up the great work I appreciate it pls don't quit hypixel like the other youtubers❤❤❤❤
Emm you can fish for a name tag
Good luck killing the warden… you’ll need it
duffle is the new henry
aw, this was actually so cool!! please do more if u feel up to it mate! :D
Make more
I wanna see more!!
Tommy entering his laid back era is all I need lol
I'm so proud of Tommy, those builds are fucking sick
The thumbnail 💀💀💀
i think this is my favorite upload in a while. the documentary style worked really well and i really would love to see more
I LOVE HOW TOMMY WAS  JUST SO HAPPY WHEN HE FOUND THE NAME TAG FOR DUFFLE LIKE OMLLL AWWWWHH
Episode 2: Tommy fights the Warden Episode 3: Tommy's qualities as a builder get realized and he gets to join Hermitcraft
Yo tell me we're all about to jump in the Cadillac
Duffle is Truly The Best
wait till he realises he can just put wardens in trapdoor pens
tommy showed up rlly amazing, he doesn’t create chaos,no challenges either! 🎉
Ngl, you get to a certain point in a world where you just kinda start murdering wardens for fun.
I’m a cow and I find this video a complete win.
What about dreams sister ?
Am I the only one who watched this video baked as fuck
did you know the waden can 2 hit you with netheriht amour?!
0:18 is its just me or someone else also heard Jojo ......... To-mmmy....
My favourite thing about a TommyInnit video is how well he wears his inspirations on his sleeve. The Slimecicle energy is great
And Haroin is a close second. This is funny.
The little callbacks to previous videos while still nurturing something new makes the change less scary can't wait for ep. 2 :)
Henry, Tommy"s pet from the dream smp that sapnap killed!!!!
ITS TOMMY'S PET COW FROM THE DREAM SMP THAT SAPNAP KILLED! HE'S BACK!
7:36 I believe the grooming allegations now
lmao just fish
Tommy: Use contraception and watch me Me: Bold of you to assume anyone who watches Tommy actually needs to use those in the first place lmaooo
...cant you fish for name tags?
as a content creator myself, I know this must have been an absolute nightmare to edit. Hats off to you, Tommy o7
YIPEEEE
THE JONOS THEME I LOVE U TOMMY
Exiting stuff!
Haven’t watched Tommy since the end of Fall of Dream SMP content, wasn’t a fan of him but I can say that his edits and his gameplay + storytelling really intrigued me and makes me want to watch more. Great job bro
For your next video here’s a tip Tommy, the Warden CAN and WILL sniff you out so be careful of how close you get. Also you can’t just pillar up and kill it like a iron golem they have a thing called “sonic boom” which will deal lots of damage. Finally the blocks you are breaking are shriekes they get signals from the sculk sensors (the blue things that glow up every time you make a noise) and if they receive 3 signals generally close to each other it will spawn a Warden. So next time be sure to bring some wool.
love these kind of videos keep it up king❤
#28 in Trending  This is something.
It genuinely felt like watching the first episode of a new Hermitcraft season while adding the Tommyinnit chaotic touch. Calming in a happy chill chaotic way
Just a tip, it takes about ten iron golems to kill a single warden. Good luck👍
listen to 2:25 with eyes closed and 1.5x speed
good luck beating the warden tommy cause its too op and 100x more hearts than the ender dragon
Cows don’t despawn I think
Who’s gonna tell him that multiple wardens can spawn at once?
Bro is so loud😭
Someone at school did a project about PC's and there was a pic of you Tommy😂😂😂😂😂half or more of the school knows you 😂😂😂❤
Why did you go digging from the summit rather than the side lol.
poor tommy if only he knew you could get name tags from fishing fairly easily
Just a little tip for you Tommy use wool or carpet so you won't wake up the warden 3:12 5:47
This comment is before the ancient city. I think he might die   Update: i was correct in my assumption
Please keep doing this. Make a series
Hi Tommy I'm new to the channel ALSO I have a frend called Tommy shaw also now ya now with that brightness how hard it is to mine on ps4 without mods
"Come on, grab your friends! I don't have any. Uh, aside from a cow" lol XD
yo that was lik a movie
Did u notice im from Maldives so imagin im this far from your place and still whach u soooooooooo much also LOL 😂 im 19.   y ear's old bruh edit Im not good at English language
we thought Tommy getting a girlfriend was surprising.. HES FINALLY LEARNING TO BUILD!
cobblestone power of tower?
I need a video of Tommyinnit and Duffle vibing to Otherside in the barn
DUFFLE BARN
This video was a great change of pace Tommy! Sometimes video can get a bit crazy but this video was so comforting just to see you play the game!
Ok but why is this him- like ofc he did.
The fact that tommy spawned ON TOP OF AN ANCIENT CITY means this dude must have the dream luck
Love this video😂
Do you miss Henry?? :)
<3 love the video and the wholesome, yet still slightly chaotic, vibes going on.
that was AWESOME man hope you do more videos like these i loved it!!!!
Tommy, you can fish for name tags
Nice video!!
Revenge on The Warden.
Tommy do you watch jjba/Jojo?
The fact the I know more about ancient cities the Tommyinnit makes me feel good about myself
This is just proper amazing, tommy is always so entertaining and Duffle, god I love Duffle
so exited for next episode of this
wow
This kids been abusing Adderall for years, you can see it in his eyes in most his videos..Xqc really put here inspiring others to be addy enjoyers kek
Late 👨‍🦲☕
You know what... voice over tommy is pretty good
Whos going to tell tommy that mobs dont despawn if they are trapped
After 3 years of playing mincraft I just now heard of "turning up your brightness will make caves less scary you don't always have to get night vision potions" WHEN WAS THIS!?WHEN WAS THIS!?
the girlfriend wont be happy
The Tommy dace😂😂😂
PART 2 BABYYY
No! Lobsters can be gay!  Oops sorry wrong video…
you are very loud, please quiet down
YOOOO LOVED THE VIDEO !!!
who's gonna tell him that passive mobs don't despawn
Why is that house actually really good
Change your Tom Simmons name to Tommyvlogit
bro, the nametag was completely unnecessary lol just use wheat
I got a name tag by fishing for a few minutes but sure, that works too...
the pace of this video gave my brain the happy chemical. I don't think I've enjoyed a video this much in a while I'm smiling a lot rn  Duffle deserves the world <3
Immaculate content
Thanks Tommy, if it wasn’t for you I wouldn’t be here today. Thank you for just being you <3
I wish you luck on killing  the warden that is if you do-
I am SO ready for you to beast that Warden and unlock the mysteries of the ancient city!! Get it Tommy! You and Duffle have got this!!!
The calmer videos have always been my favorites absolutely love this one
For reference the youtuber SB737 spent i think over 15 enchanted golden apples just to try and kill a warder
to be honest, all i can see if duffle being the henry 2.0
Where are you one of my favourite content creators can we do a Collab some one day
Duffle. The only best and true friend for Tommy. They are the most perfect pair. Also, love this pls part 2 soon! ITS SO AMAZING
this was honestly amusing to watch you should really do more exploring lol you have the humor and curiosity. You deserve my subscribe on this one 😂😂
Love you from India
how do i download mods
Duffle is best cow
The editing 🤌😩
"..And where is the place you're most likely to find them?" Me: "It's fishing right?" "..." Me: "Its fishing right!?"
damn tommy u fell off
I love snow (irl).....
heroin is a close second got me 😂
Holy shit this was actually so awesome!! :D Different from what you normally do, very relaxing!! Can’t wait for next episode :3
I am gonna cry, I spawned on a summit too😭 I didnt know till you said something, but I left mine a good bit ago
Bro this is so enjoyable to watch icl.
Lmao Tommy started going live while I’m watching this😭 “Meet Duffle LIVE! (fighting warden)
Tommy: if you like snow, die.    Technoblade building his DSMP base in the snow:
MORE!!!!!
“ffffucking hell guys- DOOR!”  that bit killed me 😭
tommy needs to start an smp on this server because of all the music discs
Wow tommy

tommy blink twice if you need help
Did this remind anyone else of watching Dantdm’s hardcore series? This was actually really fun to watch :D
Tommy now is better then mr beast because also here and the sorry Chanel are way more intertaning
"It was adventure time, come on! Grab your friends!" All jokes aside, that was a massive throwback to the 2010's
The discs🥺
Great video!!
the mother3 ost, loved it
Yo tom what about people who like snow because they cancel school?
i love this style of content. i’m excited for the next episode! :)
8:22 could have fished and took 20 mins max…
duffle deserves nothing but the best
Tommy sees cat: NOT AGAIN
Missed opportunity. Should have named the barn 'duffle bag'
tommy just get 10 end crystals to beat warden
YEAHHH LETS GOOOO USING JOJOSSSSSS
9 hours? 😂
For someone who plays with no lighting (saves battery) it’s so much easier with light I can finally see
but tommy just telling u when yo kill on and make more noise it spawns back
I am going to Brighton for holiday in August
I like this video more than alot of your other ones. Good stuff!
Who’s gonna tell him that breedable mobs don’t despawn (except trader llamas). So Duffle never would of despawned
Slimecicle-ass intro, I love it
Thiago video Wars so good
Man, why am I the only one the gets stuck in powdered snow and FREEZES to death!🥶😵
hey, it’s my first time coming across your channel and i love all of your videos and potentially the only gaming creator i enjoy watching more than anyone else, and please keep doing you every time. Shoutout broo 🫵🏾
Mc animals cant despawn...
The otherside is the rarest disc in the game
I love the zelda music!
sapnap was wrong😂you got henry back💀💀
If i had duffle than he would become my duffle bag
when tommy said those who like snow, die at 00:30, technoblade took it too seriously
Duffle  Me: *EXTREME HENRY FLASHBACKS FROM DSMP*
Tommy being absolutely clueless about the fact that passive mobs don't despawn naturally the whole vid
1000 years, and he dead after that😭😂
But I don’t wanna die tommy
Wait A Second I thought Minecrap was a drug
duffle w
Does he not know passive mobs like cows cant despawn?
I love this video so much, it was never boring and always entertaining, please stream this on twitch it would be so much fun❤
i loved this it’s so nice to see tommy do more than a dirt hut i can’t wait for the next one
Tommy just has a way of being the most comforting person no matter how chaotic the video is. Makes me so happy that i got to be here to see him
duffle is loved by all.
"If you like snow," *_chuckles_* "D I E"
amazing
Just letting you know, passive mobs don't despawn
Duffle: yoooo guys look at me, I’m Tommy’s favorite! Henry:
Lol😊
This feels.... like i was back in time.. it feels good..
Tommy looks like the most typical British person ever. Like literally, he looks like Rowan Atkinson and Ed  Sheeran combined
live laugh duffle
Three months later finally, I’ve done it AGHHHHHHHHH
Once I watched this I realised this is why Tommy was off for so long and it was definitely worth it!
tommy do not give up on yt , ur vids are awesome and idk why ppl find u annoying when ur rly fun to watch we lov u and support u so much u will always be very funny  .
im suprised that i reeaally liked that video :D♥
does anyone know what the song at 6:58 is?
tommys the type of person to see the warden and ask is anybody gonna eat that
'Heroin is a close second' Me: WHAT THE FU-
I have a pet pig called Jared 😂 Our friendship is like Tommy’s and Duffle’s
Am I the only one thinking: "How come he doesn't have glasses yet???"
NOT A CLIFFHANGER
2.5M more subs till 15M!        Can i get Pinned?
Tommy finally upped his building skills. I love it. keep going with it toms!
The barn should be called *duffledorf*
Tommy built a po'al
Tommy quick tip to kill the warden:  1)make hole for trap  2)trap warden in hole  3)use bow and a shit ton of arrow and shoot it at a distance  4)kill warden
Duffleblade
Such a great vid
Bro said * incert jojos themesong *
y es i want more
11:15 ELSA STYLE LETS GO
"Next episode, I'm gonna go kill the warden"  ... should we tell him?
Great house Tommy great fucking house
I love that in the end he just dies and when he did, just look at his face. He was just there. I wonder what he thought.
Tommy you’re not funny anymore. Try something new
Tommy this is probably my favourite video you’ve ever made and I’ve been watching since the 2b2t experience 😭
Hypo do sky lock foraging throwbacks
I thought this was normal for tom
I thought this was normal for tom
Have fun with the warden buddy maybe this will teach you to research first bring snowballs next time
The discs always find themselves back with Tommy smh
Duffle for the win!
5:14
he missed the chance to name the cow Henry :(
Doesnt he already do this normally 😂😂😂😂
Phil will be so proud of you tommy❤
Tommy. Do you mind sharing your heroin problem to the class
cows don't despawn though
Of course we need to ask PHIL.
henry 😞
It’s so wholesome to see Tommy just playing the game withought any mods. It’s also super cute see him get so attached to duffle haha.
the way hes just stone faced, but actually has his moments of genuine enjoyment. so true.
I like this style of content a lot more than just trying to get out modded ender dragon killing videos. Keep it up :)
Just a bit of a tactic for the ancient city. Sorry Phil to offend you but this is not hardcore. Die as many times as you want until you win.
Best video
You really do my head in mate
Henry is jealous of Duffle.
Meatcanyon did a more accurate representation of you than I thought.
YES!!! FINALLY A NORMAL LETS PLAY
funny at how tommy said it was good when he opens the chest which contains only a single gapple
The disc it all about them
very fun to watch so make more innit
bro one-uped SB737
12:20 how do you do the recordings?
The discs are a bad habbit of Tommy really
amazing vid, hilarious, i love this sort of content.😂😂
I like these more chill videos:]
I killed the warden after being 53 min in the world
Tommy, don't you have a girlfriend to hang out with
This was a really nice video, I don’t know why it just feels nicer to watch then usual. Pog
who is gonna tell him that animels like cows and sheep and stuff don't despawn at all-
Btw only hostile mobs can despawn
Chommyinnit 😈
i’ve been watching you for four years and this is probably in my top 3 fav vids of yours!! loved this style of video
As someone who was forced to go down into the deep dark with pretty much zero information about how to avoid the warden by my brother because he wanted to "test" how dangerous the warden was I was having flashbacks XD
your much better than building than i am m8

POV: mr beast at  8:46 (‘◉⌓◉’)
Tbh it’s amazing seeing Tommy growing up towards as of right now. I really miss the old days 😭
I can tell youre trying a bit diferent type of content, more . . .shlat-like or slime-like or 100 DAYS IN  MINCRAFT MR BEAST APOCALYPSE. wonder how people are going to take it
This video was so amazing! The vibe was chill but really interesting all the time. Would not mind if Tommy were to upload more of these types of videos:D
part 1 of just tommy starring at a screen im excited to see part 2 of HIM JUST STARRING AT AAAAAH
tommy is an old man now
"but heroin is a close sec-"
this feels like a more refined version of 2021 tommy, its refreshing
Isn't that what you do everyday?
Leaving the cow in a boat even if its one of the mobs thst don't desoawn is so funny 😂
I've been a veiwer for a while now ur videos are so funny and hilarious keep up the good work
7 days in real life or 7 days in game?

Tommylnnit: if you like snow *chuckles* DIE the next day: *the news* there was a girl who was found dead while she was sitting watching the YouTuber Tommylnnit

duffle is a literal grade A koby beef
passive mobs don't despawn you've just been stripping duffle of freedom for no reason
The music disc from the dream SMP

Early gang ⬇️😎
If you like snow...heh...DIE I'm already cracking up😂😂😂😂😂

The 16 years old Tommy is finally back🎉
jojo refrence
DONT STOP THIS SERIES PLEASE
use iron golem to distract the warden
i love watching you do survival please do more and maybe make a series
The boat was for nothing, the cow wouldn't despawn since it was in a < 20x20 space.
dont stop being wholesome pls tommyinnit
11:08
4:46 well you might call those two things the same at some point
I actually really enjoyed this
TommyInnit: If you like snow..... D I  E  Technoblade with his house in the snow:  Okay!
Animals don’t despawn in Java edition
Only 19hrs early and hello tommy  I hope I get a shoutout one day lol
3:38 WHAT 😂😂😂
MOROEROEOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I just unintentionally watched this whole video in preview mode
these singleplayer videos are really fun to watch
Anyone else catch the adventure time reference
MOREEEE
Here’s a tip for killing a warden trap the warden in a hole get a maxed out bow then shoot away. Lava doesn’t work or fall damage or drowning .
oH mY g0d T0mMy h&$ thE saMe b0oK @s mE
You said u can’t see shit without brightness,DAS MOBILE FOR YA NO BRIGHTNESS WELL THERE IS BUT ITS SHIT
I love how as tommy gets older, he progressively looks like wilbur.
Im lovin the solo tommy content. Feels way more authentic tommy and less like hes putting on a show for the likes
do it again but in VR
As a mic builder ur house is ok
9:50 *flashbacks*
tommy actually trying to build is so unfamiliar for him
When's part 2???
This is amazing I love mc keep doing this series, u could become a hardcore player too or a sick builder that house was honestly impressive for ur standards
I can't wait for the next episode
A minute in and you've already insulted literally every canadian lmao
Please fucking tell tommy that you can lower the prices from villager by turning them into zombies and them healing them ( he just wasted soo much goddamn time without using that tactic that fucking moron-)
I’m gonna see this a comment next year and say the good old times like I said this year for 2022 then for 2021 then 2020 see yall on the 17th march 2024
that moment when you dont need a nametag for passive mobs:
he used fabric loader🤣🤣
if you like snow D I E
this video was so good the editing was incredible and the gameplay was amazing and then your humour just makes it even better
I love this so much and I love tommyinnit so much /p
Warden spawner HAHAHAHAHAH TOMMY YOU ARE THE BEST
7:36 I saw this picture of clay with the caption like thing saying send toe pics
"I immediately ran back home" he said that he was recording a nature documentary, freaking priceless.
hadn't watched you in ages, looking good
this really felt like a return to the tommyinnit content I first fell in love with - loved the play-through with commentary, super great man, can't wait for more
"Enough to make grian bust" Wet Splode Sound.
This is the most wholesome i could get from tommyinnit, a slight change for his content is actually needed :)
the way I was blushing seeing him being so happy abt duffle
I don't get it wheres his old cutely annoying intro???  Tommy 2018-2022 be like only a small presentage of my viwers are acutally subcribed BECAUSE only a small precentage of ma viwers are acutally subcribed so SUBCRIBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The fact that Tommy grinded all of those wood and logs, days and countless hours to give Duffle his freedom his dedication for his friend is overwhelmingly wholesome
Would LOVE to see the long version of this 😂
Bro used giornos theme too often that i started watching the anime again
more like this please!!
Why didn't i sub to Tommy sooner?
Hey tommy, dont make the same mistake as me, if you dont get rid of all the spawners, ummmm how do i say this....... Fuck it i may as well tell you my story. You end up with a shit ton of wardens, and trust me, its not nice, i would know, cuz i ran there 32 times IN A ROW trying to get my stuff back, now theys to many of them, and i cant wait for them to disappear because mobs keeps spawning and they wont stop makeing me go blind, so i left my stuff and never went back............ Till now, just joking im never going back to that shit hole. The loots not worth the pain.
Good video tommy! Hadnt watched anything of yours for a minute now and really enjoyed  this one
Ask ivory on how to kill the warden
I died
Someone clip Tommys message about his house and send it to grain somehow.
Hiiiii
Heres a tip for the next episode.. You need 10 iron golems to kill 1 Warden.
bro doesnt know passive mobs d9nt despawn
tommyinnit likes jojo? pog
WISH ME LUCK INNITERS I HAVE AN INTERVIEW TOMORROW 😬😬
This is shaping up to be a great series! Definitely gonna start a new world of my own after this one.
This video is awesome
Amazing vid!
Great video. Also peaceful mobs won’t despawn if they are in a pen. The game is coded so if they are inside of an enclosed space they won’t despawn
Tommy Your #12 TRENDING!!!
ok bro ty very cool
Sick house
How was prison with slimecirlce
7:00 „moo ve“
BRO!
Your mom
MORE FUCKING MORE I WANT IT NOWWWWW
Red eye ball
7 days in 15 minutes
15:06 you should’ve put up your shield
Damn the intro is so epic
I have missed these types of videos
Bro someone needs to tag mr beast
Watching a British gamer who has a mom that hates him is the best thing in my life
I learned from i think second life idk that you can kill the warden by catching it with fishing rods and throwing it at the ground
meanwhile the hardcore players 10000 days
pin the comment
Tommys video quality is getting better which each vid I am very happy :D
Tommy that house is actually amazing!!! No way that's your first time building it looks fantastic!!
honestly thought the video was gonna be bad but it was actually pretty good
cool video
11:04 flashbacks to the times of my cartoon network days
*tommy while mining * "i cant see AnYtHiNg" Me: welcome to bedrock
this is ym fav video of yours!!!
2019 Tommy was the best. Then the weird people started creeping in.
That was actually really enjoyable! I used to love watching Tommy but all the mods and craziness I found tedious. Tommy doesn’t need them to be fun to watch, I’m looking forward to more!
lol i still play 1.8.9 survival 😂❤❤
omg tommy building!!! aweosme video!!!!!
Who expect that tommy will be this wholesome 😅not irritating rather peaceful
I actually spawned in a world that I made for me and my friend, I spawned in a jungle then walked for a bit found a village and a warden place underneath with. A mineshaft above it I died soooo many times so I just gave up
Fucking loved it! Already looking forward to the kill the warden vid
Watching Tommy actually enjoy playing the game itself and not just creating chaos in it was surprising and quite enjoyable
* Dream hacks into the server and steal the discs AGAIN *
Please continue this series.This was so entertaining.Suggestion:Name this series Duffle
Томми, я тебя люблю ,выходи за меня
Love the new video style 🎉 excited for the next one!
The new henry is duffle...
this is so great. amazing. cant wait for the next episode!!! i need to see duffle thrive!!!!!
I love this video....honestly 😍🥰  Good editing, Brilliant commentary, Amazing humour. 🤩  The thing is the story line is very important these days on YouTube🧐
That thumbnail photo be staring into my soul 💀
This is one of my favorite tommy vids I’ve seen in a while
part 2 rn
Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  Nice song😂😂😂
“if you like snow.. haha.. DIE” -TommyInnit 2023
YO JOJO IL VENTO DORO INTRO LETS GOOOOO
Waiting
12:59 I love the parallels this draws to Techno breaking dream out of the prism
I am team climate change
really enjoyed this :) i feel like the base game can really be magical if you keep your mind open to it. Can’t wait for more <3
WHY DOES TOMMY ALWAYS NOT RUN BUT STARE AT THE MONSTER?!
I just love giorno's theme
the editing was insane, who cares if your gf hates you now
Well I thought that sb737 played for a long time lol
I think rekral beaten the warden if you want watch his video it may really help
his thumbnail says it all
i feel like through this experience you skipped time several times like the butterfly effect
I will get nightmared
Partition for tommy to start a new smp
man, this is what I need
The dedication to duffle is wild
if you like snow just die<3
Mc is kinda boring after playing it over couple thousands times taking with friends while I play helps the bordem
Trees : *exist*    Tommy : AND I TAKE THAT PERSONALLY.
The dream smp feels like something that happened yesterday, and his problem with discs now is hilarious
i want more thank you
lol yes
Ok, but why is tommy actually good at building
funny little man
15:18 Good luck He is nearly unkillabil 😂
tommy, peace and love, theres no way youre killing the warden. just get your sneaky pants and call it a day
Tommyinnit: If you like snow bioms, die. Technoblade: ... (IM SO SORRY)
I ALSO BURST INTO SONG WHEN I SONE OUT LMAO I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME
0:31 technoblade: ehh and i took that seriously  (its just a joke.. dont cancel me)
I agree with the other comments it's really nice to see you enjoy the game and see how it is now and yes the deep dark city is terrifying
Tommy is now a real mc YouTuber🎉
😂😂😂😂😂
Tommy...     HOW THE #### ARE YOU GONNA KILL THE ####### FAT WARDEN WHEN ITS FAT SELF HAS 500HP???? PLEASE TELL ME (hashtags are swear words to let you really know how i feel)
You always said that you wont make solo videos because of fear that they will not blow up.  Glad You Conquered it King!
PLEASE CONTINUE THIS CONTENT
tommy being jojo reference
You should get tubbo or wilber to join next episode
Amazing Video,but we need a next episode Tommy (:
When you hear Giorno theme 😀😀😀
THIS IS AMAZINg tommy. looking forward to your next episode bro WOOO
Duffle is best cow :)
Do some research before you anything.
yeah pls more
Does he know where his intro is from?
3:11 tommys trouma kicks in
You need the turtle master potion to kill the warden
My man managed to shove 7 days, who-knows-how-many jokes, and what seems like 20 other video/lore references/references to things into 15 minutes, amazing effort, Give this man a round of applause 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Finally tommyinnit is enjoying the game
"Bye bye tree YOU SUCK! F*CK YOU and your oxygen. I DON'T LIKE YOU" -TommyInnit
that one nerd when he said "i hate your oxygen!" well actually 90% of oxygen come from water 🤓
Such a refreshing lil nice lil video :D
Duffle is a god
plz do the episode of killing the warden you can't do it alone it takes a group of 4 or more to kill 1 warden and the wardens health is just rediculos so you need better gear then just diamonds you need neatherite if you want to have the best chance. (Post this on your next episode if you're killing the warden.
Pov
People who know we need a part 2🔥 👇
I admire the dedication. The humour is also amazing
....ok so who's gonna tell him that cows dont despawn
I believe in duffle supremacy
For some reason Duffle reminds me of Henry
Blub
Should have named the farm the duffel bag
I would actually love a single payer let's play  modded or not but new generation palying like the old days I want to see that
all of his motivation is because of a cow of pixels  yes
I don't think peaceful mobs despawn if you're logged into a world, even if they're not in a boat
man ain't annoying anymore😂 edit:I TAKE THAT BACK, MAN'S AMAZING NOW. AND THE EDITING IS TOP NOTCH
10:06 best disc in my opinion
i kinda like this slightly more chill tommy tbh
The poor girlfriend smh }:(
7:23 bridging over the void is scarier in my opinion
Bruh just go fishing for a nametag 😂😂
please do more, but more letsplay style and less "summerised" style. like something more chill rather than *hype every second. must entertain short attention spans, must skip boring parts, must give action*
Tommy: I hate trees now. Also him: I won't destroy a tree again.
i get that Tommy's dedication to Duffle is great but. Why is nobody talking about the sound effect the editor made when he said "it would even make grian bust."💀💀💀💀
This made my day 1000x better, i stayed home from school because I'm ill and this made my day
0:30 Snowtic fell from a high place
you know you could have tried fishing for a name tag right?  either way love the vids keep going
Hi Tommy
I just love Duffle.
You didn't need a name tag... passive mobs can't despawn
alternate title: just a tommyinnit  video
Tommy is an amazing builder
duffle = g.o.a.t
IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE#
you need full diamond arrmor with full prot 2 to survive one hit from the warden so good luck with that
"i spent hours shaving trees" huh, i guess you learned from schlatt, you circumcised trees for hours, THE CIRCUMCISION GOES ON!
Bro i am INVESTED
6:50 it was sooo sweet aww✨️🫠
no cos  this whole video I spent stressed about if dufffle was die or not im traumatized. by Henry
So that's Why tommy tweeted the Tubbo thing lmao xD
DUFFLE!!!
I haven't watched anyone kill the warden yet cuz I wanted to do it myself first but imma have to see Tommy attempt this 👀
tommy making this video like he doesnt do this every week
can't wait to see tommy try to kill the warden, who has more health (500 health, to be specific) than the wither and ender dragon 😁👍
Henry reincarnated
Is it just me or did Tommy seem way older in this video-?
Ancient city’s are the main feature of 1.19 BOZO🤡
Do it
this made me so happy, its feels old and new at the same time 😭
0:30 if you like snow D I E
Tommy being so nice to duffle really reminds me of Henry
WE NEED MORE !!😊
Just in the front of my school with my airpods watching tommyinnit :1
YOOOOO THAT WAS EPIC!! Great way to reimagine the whole vanila game, cant wait for the next episode!! :D
0:28 - 0:34, techno certainly did
6:48 THAT WAS SO CUTE AWW
Tommy has gone from a  man child to man teen and watching this I think he is truly a man now
This was a really nice watch. I’m all in if Tommy keeps making this series :))
10:07 the duffle shuffle. thank me later.
tommy rejets oxygen and breathes helium
WE LOVE A LETS PLAY
I’m so proud his homes are not anymore dirt iron and Cobblestone
This is a series (hopefully) we never knew we needed
0:40 bro not even a minute in and he’s roasting things being aggressive, like lol what did the tree do to u 😂😂
Bro started the vid with the jojo song xD
MORE CONTENT
YAY HE POSTEDDD
i like seeing british people swearing , aspecially tommy
Tommy passive mobs don’t despawn 😂
Tommy this was incredible?!! Please do more??? I’d happily watch a survival series :D   …..Also as a builder genuinely those were not bad at all for first house !!! /gen /pos
Love seeing how he is actually good at building now  Seeing the growth is amazing
I love the “💿->😮. NOT THIS AGAIN”
9:14 Tommy's "how" sounds like villager..
dose he knows if he kills one another one can spawn back ,
0:31 terrible reminder that techno’s old house was located in a snow biome
"I'm going into the unknown ESLA STYLE" - Tommyinit 2023
One of the best vids every good job
cant wait for the next episode
Hey Tommy, I like snow
you lie 7 days straight means seven days in a row especially beginning with Sunday and ending with Saturday and you slept so you are a lie tommy.
breh
GOOOO TOMMMMMMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Did you guys see how the Warden silenced tommy after killing him  No has ever accomplished to silence tommy before even when he was murdered he screamed a lot
👁👄👁
Hahahahaha
Duffle the cow
duffle reminds me of henry
Tommy now: I hate trees and animals. Let's kill mother nature  Tommy when the earth is dying: *Panics intensifies
Watching Tommy Move from the Chad Pad to the Giga-Chad Estate was really something!
goofy ahh thumbnail
I thought this was a Ryan Trahan video.
Getting attached to a cow, this can’t end badly
Tommy being so close to a cow was honestly really wholesome
i really liked this style of video and would love to see more like it in the future!
Wow, what a cliffhanger!! Will the diamond leggings stay or go...
Balls
Bro is gonna realize that the warden isn't even a boss lmaoooo GOODLUCK TOMMY I BELIEVE IN U
Tommy you doing a good job, i like your comment every scene 😂😊
TommyInnit is The best youtubers
cows DON'T DESPAWN!!!!
Play terraria again!
Hi
Actually the golden apple is used to open a door when u eat it go and goggle it
1:04 Henry! My beloved
Nice
i just love how he spawns right on a snowy mountain, which prob has an ancient city under it, and took such a long time to find another one
i shared this fucking video to 20 people and I don't know why
I'm glad to see such old Tommy, I'm looking forward to see next episode REALLY
Tommy are you ok?…
This sb737 fuckery is not fun
the warden has 500 health its gonna take a month....
Play hypixel skyblock again <3
I spend hours trying to find otherside and he finds it just like that??
the intro music is realllllllllyyy goodd
Tommy's quest to let duffle not despawn, but... you can just feed him once...
let gooooooo that intro ahhhhhhhhh! noice work tommy innit
KILL THAT WARDEN
Tommy, i think fishing for an nametag would be easier than trading. just saying :)
Heads up, passive mobs like cows, chickens, sheep, etc. don't despawn on their own. Neither do dogs and cats.
I thought he already did this
Tommy how are you going to do this?! The wardens has 2500 hearts!!! How?!
im courious to know how long this took to make
tommy has now lost the ability to eat beef
He doesn't do that already?
Stream a hardcore series like philza could be fun
this was sick... even though it was cookie cutter stuff... he had his own spin to it so it was nice... 👍
Tommy just feed the cow he won't despawn!!!
I like wholesome tommy
Did you know passive mobs dont despawn
passive mobs don’t despawn tom…
Love Ur Vids Tommy! They Are Really Well Edited!And You Inspire Me A LOT!  (love duffle! :D)
Lets gooo!! Another awesome video from big man tommy

3:13 Bro's about to start a nation 💀💀💀
Noice 😂
Hit the like button to give duffle some love ❤👇👇👇

Reply to this comment if u are looking for a java smp. (please, me and my friends are really struggling to find players).
:Team trees trying to make the world better POV tommy NO TREES
Takes a whole new meaning to the word “duffel bag”
WE NEED MORE VIDEOS ON YOUR OTHER CHANEL
Camman is gonna be so pissed.
is duffle henry's son
I don’t know if I should connect this to my tv or watch it in my IPad cuz my man curses 😂 Nd I don’t want my mom to hear 😂
you know i really appreciated this video !!!! i think a back to basics sorta thing is really necessary and refreshing these days. i really enjoyed this one, looking forwards to episode two!
Tommy’s gonna be pissed when he finds out that the warden drops nothing 💀
I cannot express the amount of nostalgia I felt when Tommy referranced adventure time
I honestly really enjoyed this video. Cant wait for the next episode!
Elsa style??? 😂😂
Hi
Hello, I´m a mother of a child, who died behind his PC and was watching your video. He put the video into a loop, and when I came, I heard you say: You like snow, die. I wanna press charges for forcing children to death. Reach to me as fast as possible. You won´t get out of this.
Okay but i legitimately would love a full series of this, the chaotic editing and commentary is funny, entertaining and genuinely good
Is that Jojo Reference
i too went into the acient city absolutely blind and i died from its sonic blast in the safe room :) i cried
Just fish for a name tag? 😂
What a banger!
Tommy, you are never killing that warden. I was in creative mode with an enchanted netherite sword and it took me forever to kill it.
Where can I watch the full length vid
i love the house its way better than what you used to make
4:49 yep, that's goin in the quote book
I love the "woah" at the start
This is really good
Good luck killing the warden 💀
this is a video
I can't for the next episode
I love this video so much
Please pin my comment Tommy 😢
Duffle living life like a king, Also that house looks really good
They grow up so fast… no more dirt houses 😔👌
Lessss goooooooo
Always good to see Tommy being an idiot.  And Simons? Welcome to the deep dark.
I was about to ask if you were stupid But then I remembered
Tommy WHY DID U JUST STAND THERE AND DIDN'T RUN
THIS MAN/BOY/CHILD IS AWESOME
4:50 And meth is third-
7:08 SUS
0:31 technoblade's house in the dream smp was in snow and he die-
Ok but cows or any other passive mob don’t despawn, that’s why you’re able to have a cow or chicken farm
why  did I remember henry?
When get custom rank play more skyblock. It would be hiralous
*this auto plays as i’m sat at piano*   *various G EE CC G GGGG D CC*                            (it’s jump in the cadillac “
“I’ll name him duffle,bag”
Who thinks duffle is a descendant of henry the horse?
Now you see how epic it is to own a cow. Though I prefer having pet chickens or parrots 😋😋  until they die by a creeper.
11:27 lmao
nice video just some nice survival
when tommy gets a pet cow: *vietnam flashbacks*
when u said u dont like the tree take it back :(
You caused the end of my relationship and I would like to thank you for that
this has such peak 2019 tommy energy and im so glad to see it. this was such a fun video!!!! keep it up tom <3
Bro, if you want to do that, you should have your friends with you
isnt fabric loader a hack?
no life?
Damn i miss dream smp
Tommy and his golden wind(giornos theme)
bro use wool to cover up your sounds and make sure to have a safety tunnel about 40+ blocks into the wall  and cover up chests will wool and open them to hide sounds
tbh he only needs a bow and arrows to kill the warden. and a long tunnel the warden can't go into

Just found my new comfort video! Great format Tom, keep it up!
Did you see that? Duffle nudged you. He loves you.
GOOD JOB TOMMY!! YOUVE GOT IT ON 4TH FOR GAMING CONGRATS😁
Holy shit best mc vid iv seen in a while
His father/son relationship with duffle is just amazing but am i the only one that thought he was kinda stupid bc cows dont despawn like that
DUDE BRO REALLY USED THE CURSE OF BINDING
As much as this is interesting Tom.. I do not want your content to be you sacrificing your sleep!Good sleep improves your brain performance, mood, and health.i don't want this to happen to you
this is true minecrafting give a applause to this man
you can go fishing for about 15 minutes and have a decent chance at getting a name tag so you dont have to take days trading or searching chests
make grain what
you should stream these things
this is such a wholesome video i love it
omg this was so cool  and epic tommy,well done
I just realized techno died without seeing dream his biggest rival's face 😢 blood 4 the blood god
Omds duffle is so similar to my mc username (bedrock) and my dogs name! 😂 dogs name: Duffy username: Dufaloo
Bruh I love this can’t wait!
Hiiiiiiiii
FINALLY U MADE TH  E JOJO MEME/SONG YAYYYY
Meatcanyon was right 😂
Get a cat or a bad for him to talk to Daniel again that’s why I sing cats and birds in the game at your dads to music can’t beat about beat yes there is can I buy dish made photo is Mahomes is that is not my question it is that’s it but I tell you and I still don’t know why they have those dates for the specific animal 10:16 😊
Bro thinks he’s polarsaurusrex
hey tom wanna like idk JUST GET ENCHANTED ARMOR FIRST BEFORE YOU GO TO THE BIG FIGHT?!
WE NEED BATTLE ROYALE BACK!!!
Nice to see Tommy *finally* building an *actual* house after 3 Years of living in a hill
he has DREAM LUCK
tip for killing the warden trap it and bow it down cuz warden have long range attacks
I left a like because I want to see more!
Make a survival series
Bros face been elongated in the thumbnail 💀💀
✨if you like snow die✨
U know if u feed a cow it can’t despawn right
Since when tommy started using Jojo references.
Man good luck getting the notch apples
TOMMYS REACTION WHEN HE GOT THE DISC 😭
i don't know why, but i feel like i should never do drugs and only watch Tommyinnit
Ok now Tommy why cant you give credits to using Giorno's Theme, its one of the best Main Character theme's ever!
how dare you tell me to die :sob: Ily though
Love these vibes man, keep at it
As a pro builder your house is pretty good
Bruh you're the same age as me.
0:21 star wars rip off :0
9:11 golem : I'm the night I'm justice I'm batgolem
Cows don't despawn, that's only hostile mobs
Passive mobs don't despawn... Duffle didn't have to stay in that boat
I LOVE DUFFLE!!! GREAT VIDEO TOMMY, I BELIEVE IN YOU!!! TAKE DOWN THAT WARDEN!
Nvm
All hail duffle innit
I’m sorry but him yelling DOOR was really freaking funny and wholesome to me
this video seemed like a old tommy
The disc are taunting tommy
No you die tommyinnit
Wow me and my cousin destroyed the warden with a piece of bread 😂
That.  Now that. Was just a legitimately awesome video!
yeaaah this is why i use treecapitator mod
Lmfao so Tommy didn't know you can get a nametag by just fishing in an ocean for a few minutes
I didn't notice your such a good builder but your building is horrifical
It’s 2 AM… this got on my recommended. Sleep or Tommyinnit? I’ll choose the healthier option.         Watching this obviously
NANI GIORNO THEME
We want Tommy series 😊
“Even grian would bust”
Wow this can be a good serie
8:37 TEAM CLIMATE CHANGE is hilarious
Mobs won't despawn surrounded by fence jsyk
Duffle is so cute :D 10/10 very good cow
Just finished making a huge Lmanburg flag above my base in survival a bit ago
This is my new obsession
Try Ark survival evolved :))
i love this content
The Warden has hundreds of hearts of health so either take an enchanted bow or axe and get crits.
wow i didnt know tommy knew how to build
Duffle= Henry 2nd
I love this layout, love a cliffhanger
Tommy: if you like snow DIE  Techno who lives in snowchester: burh
This is so good! Cant wait for the next episode!! 🎉
For a name tag just fish
tommyinnit that is an anime song u played
The Warden is impossible to kill Tommy
Techno liked snow .......
Also mobs like cows, pigs, chickens. Those type, the non dangerous ones don't despawn. Just at all they stay forever if you keep them safe.
Mans found "The Otherside" on day 2 or 3, while it took Dadza years XD
the really funny thing is that passive mobs dont despawn..
You do know you can play external music to make it more fun, plus just youtube playing is fun.
this was really cool i enjoyed the chill(ish) vibes and i felt kinda nostalgic for some reason anyways love ur vids dude :)
Bruh I always play in darkness while mining
tommy you gotta use the From the Void mod! it totally adds nothing scary that makes the game infinitely better
Jojo reference?
“If you like snow…. D I E”  Me : “I guess I will kill myself now.”
I love your  videos ❤
.............                  Never gonna give u up, never gonna let u down!
This guys loves duffle more than his girlfriend
That is so wholesome that he take care of his Boy Duffle
Don't try this at home.
"If you like snow, heh, DIE" - Tommy 2023
okay so... tommy is to duffle as Jesse is Reuben at this point
yesss mooorreeee
Tommy this is the way you  can make the video enjoying
rookie numbees
Why did you have to do Grian like that? 😭
Alternative title- Tommy has lost all his friends and has retired to live with his only remaining companion- a cow
Yessss finally a new vudeo love you Tom tom ❤
Ok but why does this make me sad Like everything’s changing- I just miss lockdown and 2020 - 2021 dsmp :’/  but I respect that people obviously have to grow and stuff :’)
Tommy did you got an F at Your math class cause 7 days is 168 hour 🗿💅
gave me a weird kinda nostalgia.. ig bc i used to watch tommy more back in 2020 and just missed these kinds of videos. excited for more :)
“If you like snow…d i e”
YOU CANT ESCAPE THE DISKS TOMMY YOU CANT ESCAPE!!!!     lol
I'm looking for the music track that Tommy ended the video on. Anyone have any idea? 15:20
Tommy: *Is terrified of the Warden*  People on Double Life: Time to bring the Warden to the surface!
I just woke up
WAIT YOUTUBE ACTUALLY UNSUBSCRIBED ME WTH
Suddenly I have a new comfort video
Dam Tommy is changing...
JOJOOOOOO GOLDEN WINDDDDD
Hello
new life
Duffle deserves the world. And Tommy supplies him with it.
i can't believe it😢 he's turned into dantdm
passive mobs.... dont despawn
I love how tommy is still obsessed with the discs it reminds me of the old days
LOL i acc kill a 100 warden at once it wad ezzzzzzzz it on my channel
Okay I definitely want more,this was absolutely amazing❤❤❤
I LOVE DUFFLE <3 FINALLY SOMEONE LOVES COWS AS MUCH AS ME
Its kind of nice to just have tommy without the screaming and just some nice gameplay and editing.
If Tommy was finding this fun he should play the forest with some of the others, just a recommendation.
bro said he’s an animal lover while holding raw mutton
Huge respect for tommy for putting so effort into his videos
I think you just met my cousin she a fam of your YouTube channel and we all warden in my family so I was very excited when you saw the warden
Huge respect for tommy for putting so effort into his videos
Next episode tommy asked help for his friends to help him kill the warden....
Killing the warden in bedrock is easy. I have killed it 30 times....man I need to be quite
This is very good video
My dumb ass accidentally ran into the warden on EASY MODE and legit still lost so I quit too kekw
dude got otherside OTHERSIDE IS SUPER RARE
you should start a mincraft hardcor world
1:58  Your cow can’t despawn because you built a pen around it. If the mob can walk 20 blocks in a straight line it will despawn when your chunks are unloaded
Honestly I've never been interested in tommyinnit series (basically dsmp) but, I'm GENUINELY EXCITED FOR pt2 :)  Also lots of love to duffle I love him
if I'm being honest this is one of my favorite tommy videos!
THis was so cute. Best of luck on the next one~
bro you should do same exercise breaks
YES I LIVE MODDED AND UNMODDED
we 100% want this series to continue !! :D
You should make a ep of this
get into podcasts or somthing so ur not just bored while grinding away
More
Finally More Tommyinnit
How did he find otherside in a skeleton spawner???
Building skill is getting better
Tommy, I started watching you just about when Wilbur hit that button. I know I was late watching the smp, but after I got caught up, I was hooked. No, I did not watch every single stream of yours or Wilburs, I was really just watching the highlights and arcs of the smp. You were one of the few youtubers that I watched as soon as I have been notified.  Thank you for pulling me out of hell whenever I watched your videos. I'm at peace when I watch them, I forget everything around me.  Thank you for the role you played in the smp, you were the most energetic character out of all of the others, with your silly moments, your afairs with the others, and your absolute obsession with those disks, you were somehow a Menace that got along with everyone at the end. The smp would have not been the same without you.  And thank you again, for the smile and slight tears I devolved watching this video. I will be around waiting to watch your next video. :)  I love you. (no homo) <3
I think it would be better if u just had like the actual voice recording instead of the voice over. the voice over kind of takes away from the emotion u have while ur playing and it feels emotionless if that makes sense  or at least mostly origional voice recording and only a bit of voice over
How many kills do you need to become hitler?
huh
You should of called the barn Duffle bag
Love the new format
i dunno if you figured this out cuz im not finished with the video.. but cows don't despawn.    thank you for coming to my tedtalk.
This is the best content from Tommy I’ve ever seen. I love this so much.
Do a series pls
Its Nice to see tommy back in MC
Duffle my beloved
Oh he's back The Goatttttt
its cool to see tommy using replaymod in his videos, possibly my favourite mod
you got what you wanted. trees are gonna die. willow projects confirmed
I actually enjoyed this video sm :) tommy commentary??? I wanna see more LOL
"So I can see him from my bedroom"
something about this felt so nostalgic i loved it so much
What a goat tommy is so funny and annoying lol
Tommy is getting more and more addictited
Tommy: you like snow DIE! Technoblade: WHY TOMMY  We love you tommy RIP technoblade
Duffle bag
I laughed so hard when tommy picked up the disk and said "I've done this, now! Not again!"
#9 on trending for gaming!! WOOO !! 🎉🎉
Like for duffle!!♡♡
Hi
i honestly wouldn't mind if Tommy would upload more chill videos like this, it feels refreshing
we definitely want this series to continue for a long time❤
Hypixel owner made him active in yt for his custom rank lol
Lets kill the warden!
PLEASE MAKE THESE A SERIES I WILL WATCH IT 🔥
7:03 wait till he finds out about fishing
This is wonDUFFLE🥰
TOMMY CAME BACK YIPPPEEEE❤
Oh my goodness this video gave me so much unexpected nostalgia—the pure excitement, building, journeys, wholesome friendships, and especially the epic first discovery thru the ancient city—I enjoyed this video so much!!☺️
Peaceful mobs don’t respawn so he kinda just chained duffle’s feet together for days for no reason
The dream luck is cheating tommy
Woooow the build is good❤😂
Less go next episode plsss
I like how Tommy has made a full recovery and put down his disc addiction 😂
I do love how you decided to get on the same page as most of the target audience. Most of us don't think the game is fun anymore after the dream craze, and stopped playing after the new updates.
anyone else remember when this wasnt a challenge
The fact that this isn’t hardcore is really refreshing.
9:50 was unexpected as hell lmao
Watch Now You See Me 2 and guess who you slightly sound like
Compared to most of Tommy’s other builds (no offence to those builds ofc) I think he’s making progress with building, I think he could genuinely get somewhere when it comes to building, especially with what creativity he has.
it took me like 2 years to notice that tommy has blueish eyes
we want more of this
7:40 that hit me on a spiritual level    For context, i have lost 4 netherite sets, 3 elytras, my 1 year diary and 3 months worth of mining
NEXT EPISODE 🔥🔥
duffle is my #5 best DSMP pet now
At this rate, Tommy might as well join hermitcraft
can't wait till he plays with modpacks such as those that use the CREATE mod and other things.  I hope he does atleast.  oh, and maybe in a server with friends, because if they have the CREATE Cannons mod where you can customize and create your own cannons, I feel like that'd be such a Tommy mod, once he figures it out(because he CAN be smart when he wants to).
I didnt freaking know that Tommyinnit is that good at building shit XD. HIdden Talent Unlocked!!! I ALSO HAVE TO SAY THAT HIS SENSE OF HUMOR IS SO MUCH MORE FUNNY NOW!!! XD
Tommy the Warden has 250 health is kind of hard to fight the Warden
Grian busttt
god i actually love this kind of video, keep it up!!!
4:17 THIS IS SUCH A TOMMY MOMENT! feels like 2021 again!! 🫶 “but knowing the end goal would be a house that would inspire the youth to never do drugs and use contraception and only ever watch me. i had a purpose, and i persevered!”
Does he just not realize you can get name tags from fishing? Lmao
The way Tommy just watched the warden my soul
When the cow mooed to say yes lol
you dont even need a name tag to stop passive mobs from despawning oh well, duffle deserves a name plate of their own
best video in a while great job tommy
It's so nice seeing a survival video with Tommy's humor. also duffle
If you thought the warden's damage was absurd, wait until you see its health.
need bring phil to tag on
Absolutely loved this style of vid! Please keep it up!
This video: Literally all of the Hermitcraft members every single day 🤣 they grind a lot to build their visions
you could have just fed the cow 1 wheat and he wouldnt despawn lmao
Tommy really said "SOMEBODY TELL ME HOW I GOT SO SMALL!!!!"
From his face,we know he lost sanity on day 1
Kill that warden
tommy innit buiding actual builds except for dirt houses? wait that's new
Passive farm mobs like cows don't despawn
Genuinely enjoyed this video
THE DUFFLE BARN
Kill it  kill the warden
So like he hasn't seen the caves and cliffs update?? And how many updates has it been?
Henry and Duffle wouldve been good friends 😢
i think caves are bigger so diamonds can be found easier and i think that is for new players? idk not sure
nice
Tommyinnit is pro deforestation
this is the real friendship of DUFFLE the cow and TOMMYINNIT ✅
cow don't despawn lol
Good work
Sb737 watching this: 🫠
I genuinly didn't know tommy was capable of building something that isn't a cobblestone-wood hut
What the fuck say
You’ve done this challenge for 3 years don’t lie
i think tommy got henry 2.0 and a another music disc saga
"Next episode... I'm gonna kill the Warden"  *laughs in more health than wither*
he needs to touch grass
good facial expressions 👍
We are Sorry.
this video is funky and goofy
Love this!
THE DISC HAS ME SOBBING
Do the morph mod but one of your friends is the warden
Next episode you should check under the big Warden head, I won't spoil it but there's a room underneath you might learn some stuff from.
Missed the opportunity to give duffle a chest of money called the duffle bag
This is my new favorite Tommy innit video. It's just the story of a guy falling back in love with his favorite video game. And that's special.
Yo he’s so good he made striped wood not demonic
This is amazing
Tommy and duffle;s friendship is almost like wilbur and friend;s
My favorite streamer told me to die within the first minute of the video. Yay😅
love it
im kinda early
Wow, I fucked loved this style! I was captivated the entire time, I’m sure excited for the next episode! ❤
T
So that’s where you’ve been all these years
Little tip, tame 30 dogs and they will kill the warden in about 5 minutes.
Yo I am actually kinda hyped for this series ngl all YouTubers have just started hardcore or modded survival but I just wanna see a plain old survival like this HYPE 🎉🎉
Tommyinnit: I'm gonna kill you tree Greta Thunberg: 💀💀
Dayum 7 days to get a nametag for a cow that can't despawn. He is gonna be so mad when he realises passive mobs don't despawn
We love duffle 💐
I LOVE THIS VIDEO SO MUCH!!!! I LOVE THIS VIBE
Great house!  I thought that you watched hermit craft.  They do the ancient city there and first life episodes.  Scary!  I cannot believe you went!  Even Phil hadn’t in hardcore yet! Nice video!
lol scary
This is literally Camgames in a nutshell
Duffle is so won-duffle
love ur content tommy!!
Love the chill voice. Very good video
Hey Tommy! I’m a huge fan. I was just wondering if I have your permission to make an animation for you. Have a good day:D
get duffle another friend
This was really enjoyable to watch and glad you had fun!
Not hardcore world, not interestend
I’m less than 40 seconds in the video and  I’ve already been told to die 😢
okay he has gone completely insane now
Woah
bro you playing in hard it is veryyyy hard to kill it
please be a series
Grian bouta become god and destroy Tommy after what he said XD
It'd be really funny when tommy played the disc dream joins and steal it like the old times
Tommy's face when he gets one-shot, omg.
Does Tommy realize that passive mobs don’t despawn (like cows…)
Here’s a tip for Tommy: when your in the “ancient city” YOU STAY QUIET AS A MOTHERFUCKER because one the warden is blind and has great hearing two he is stronk That is my tip  -from Devilscake
You becoming calming day by day  Just scream for more views you know that
The cow, or should I say "Duffle" think Tommy jit crazy
Tommy spending hours to get a name tag not realizing that passive mobs do not despawn is comical.
Tommy: "sees disk" getting flashback and trauma NO IT'S NOT HAPPENING AGAIN😂😂
THATS WHY HE'S THE GOATT!!!!!!  HE KILLED A WOMEN AND HAS A VLOG GUN
More animated Tommy 😅
Only 7 Days?
Otherside is the rarest disc and he got it luckly.
4:50 💀💀
I think its so adorable how Tommy's absolute obsession with Duffle.
Technoblade Never Dies! ⬇
Cant wait for part 2!
The Worden can 5 shot you with prop 4 netherite armour.....
Tip to stop boredom play with your friends
first 20 sec theres a jojo reference
I like snow…
I didn't know this was a new thing. 7 Days? PATHETIC
this took me back to dsmp days
love this vid, never heard of a 20 hour second video but cant wait for it
its so good that tommy has made chatic but also at some points calming? maybe idk its a good video
ok so who is going to be the one telling tommy that he didnt need the name tag because duffle wouldnt have de-spawned...
never gets old love you tommy you changed my life when i found your channel so much
good lord, as a person who hasn't really played minecraft's singleplayer since like 2015-16, because of being an avid 1.8.9 enjoyer, this really brought me back memories to my first world in the game.  its like OH MY GOD WHY AM I SWEATING ON PVP SERVERS when i could just... play the game they made and have a different kind of fun that way! great video tommy, and cheers to duffle from me
if you like snow die tommyinnit classic
This is an awesome video
5:03 LMAO
❤
Good shit
I am really proud of Tommys first house. I cannot wait for the next episode!
I thought he was gonna name his cow Henry
funniest man alive
this was such an amazing video <3 can't wait to see more
Its refreshing to see some good old play through with just building and pets. Hyped for the next episode!!
Bro coulda just fished for 5 seconds to get a tag
Finally same good content ☺️
The reaction to the discs is amazing
i really liked this video :D
No way! Today I bought the same exact book because I suck at building 😂 . Today meaning the day tommy uploaded this video
"Kill the warden" MY SWEET ASS good luck lil dude, haha! I hope you have fun, and try bringing some snowballs along! ;D
he just seems to be having fun, not artifically like he has seemed to be since 2021. very happy to watch
I like this tommy too :)
Why..you copying other to make a series
The Tommy and Duffle duo is like the iconic DanTDM and Dr Trayuarus duo 😆
Wait this is just dsmp but more lonely and boring  Ok it's entertaining enough
😄
....DOOR
tommyinnit destroying trees and he's donate back to mrbeast for team trees
Duffle is such an amazing name
Those were nice builds though
Dude your content is the same as it was in all the best ways and constantly improving in all the best ways. I genuinely enjoyed this video so much.
Who’s gonna tell him that stripminning is no longer good
Please you need to continue with the Warden. I still remember when my friend and I encountered it for the first time and it’s always so funny because of how genuinely terrifying it is
6:37 I thought you would say no😂
The thumbnail
You could just fishing rod the name tsg
that intro goes crazy
the fuck you have against snow?
NAW I CANT EVEN SURVIVE A DAY IN SURVIVAL😭I just die from regular mobs💀 BUT tomorrow ima try to survive as long as I can😵‍💫
"This is satanic shit" quote by Tommyinnit
00:18 jojo
Duffle my beloved<3
The ignoring the cat disc bit was pretty funny
Jojo
Thank you for telling me not to do dr*gs.
I really love this kind of videos, the person enjoying a game and narrating over the gameplay. And the fact that Tommyinnit did it made this 100% funnier
If you like snow—  *die.*
"F*CK YOUR OXYGEN" *tommy's last words*
hey Tommy! Could you tell us the seed for this world?
*Dream watching*
wait till he learns multiple wardens can spawn
I love this video. I really like that he’s just being himself and playing the game with no mods or amped up personality or anything :) I love both obviously but I really like this style of video, can’t wait to see you attempt to kill the warden king
3:10 lmaooo tommy and the disks 😂😂😂
1:13 BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR WORDS...........
WIAT TOMMY DID DR*GS? I honestly love how tommy put Duffle before himself and gave Duffle a better place. So wholesome.
Why why did you use birch
mr beast has a charity for trees yk
KILL THE WARDEN FOR DUFFLE
4:26 out of any songs you did, you didn't do "jump in the Cadillac"-
3570th
When did tommy get…. Humorous
Aww Duffel’s such a great friend
Passive mobs don't despawn, in boats or not
idk why but this video made me genuinely so happy, i couldn’t stop smiling the whole time :)
Can I join the smp?
I'm happy u played my favorite song with ur pet cow
Tommy is the Demonic wholesome British man
duffle gang
Come on Tommy you can do it just go back to dream SMP!❤😂

When i saw the warden I just screamed TOMMY FUCKING RUN!!!!!😂
“ I’m going into the unknown, Elsa style”
POG!!!!!🎉😂
aint no way tommy got an ancient city spawn by clicking random seed
The jojo music
6:31 what is the music? It sounds so familiar
Tommy: If you like the snow biom, die.  Techno: Ok
I love the jojos Bazare adventure at the begining
The fekn ptsd that disk holds-
Less go
Your videos and joke’s always brighten my day. You have gotten me through some really tough times and for that, i thank you. (Also- THE DISKS ARE BACK?!!)
Bros become adult
11:07 i love when he just saying exept a cow ( I love the cow 🥹)
pretty sure passive mobs dont despawn  the zelda music was great tho
:000 YES, PLEASE HAVE ANOTHER EPISODE!!!
flashbacks of henry
You said you will put tubbo on fire at 12 million Bitch you are at 12 million
Not him resisting for Music Disc, yeah it I'll never happened again
NEW EPISODE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE... I BEG TOMMY
Bro why is tommy so good a building
How did he not get a Notch out of the deep dark chests lol
i just realized that if you're a $0.99 member, minus yt's 25% cut, he only gets .61 pounds per member.
ELSA STYLEEEEE
I love the vibe of this video.  It's quite relaxing and reminds me of watching phil or techno. All with tommy's humor of course lol.  I really like this new side of him, it's refreshing.
i love how cute and happy tommy was when he got a moo from diffle when he asked him if he liked the barn <333
Yeah the warden is scary as fuck
I WILL ALWAYS FOLLOW THE YOUTH
Is anyone gonna tell him that passive mobs don’t despawn
Okay bro, but can you do it for 7 weeks
Alright guys, who's gonna tell him passive mobs don't despawn even without nametags?
I'm so excited for this
Plss more of thissss plzzz
Uh Tommy, Y’know passive mobs don’t need name tags in order to not despawn? Right?Right?
Wholesome af 10:18
Jotaro…
Cant wait to see more
You need wool and lots of it!!
This is dope
Aww duffle!
this is why tommy didn’t post for 7 days
aw
Finally somethin goooooooooood
(:
Low key though, his builds were actually sooo fucking nice! And that moo for yes from Duffle was cute!
Duffle, *OUR* beloved
THIS JUST IN: name tags are the new music discs
I miss tommy with technoblade playing Dream SMP.
I hope Tommy does more original content once more
Canada People Die's*
Welp i guess i gotta die now
Tommy: *is in need of a name tag* Me: ah he will go fishing because you easily get name tags from fishing for a couple minutes. Tommy: *trades with villagers for a long time* Me: that works too
Team Duffel let’s go!
Bro I finally got something to watch for 15 something minutes!
Thank you Tommy for making a video about wasting time. Some guy on the internet was messing with me for three and a half hours. At least I'm not alone!
But on 5:48 the Dnf disk 😂
Wait until he finds out: Passive mobs like cows don't despawn.
Day 7 : Tommy has lost his mind and turned into a chicken
Amazing job buddy. Great to see another video٫ not saying I dont watch VODS and streams. But keep it up big man!
his first home was so smol :I i just started a new world recently and my home is gonna have a copper block roof and has deepslate floors -w-
i love how Tommy makes us smile even when we had a bad day
I have a record for killing over 550 wardens with my Therapy build :) I can solo a warden now with no death
Tommy you really should try building more often, I really like your style!
1:41  "I hate it here."  Where is that, Tommy? Your mind? Cause me too man. Me fucking too.
Tbh that house looks really good
best mincraft video ever i miss the mincraft playthroughts keep it up tommy
Is the ender dragon strikes back next? And then the return of the tommathy?
i thought this was Your normal life
6:46 Let's Go!- Wait..  OH SHIT THE AI BROKE THE FOURTH WALL
He really is related to Philza
As soon as you play the disc all I said was OH FUCK
Does liking snow in real life count? Also I hate the house cuz it’s made out of birch
Duffle is so calm and follow tommyinnit
Tommy doesn't hate trees he hates chopping them such a good guy😂 pro anti deforestation
where drug van
Tommy just attracts discs lol!
best vid ina while
how are you alive
0:33 oh ok 😢
That house is so good ever better than me i proud of you tommyinnit 🎉
👍🏻 👍🏻
I haven't seen one of these types of series from any YouTubers I watch in a while, I'm excited to see where this one go's :)
I love the way tommy is just risking his mental health for us 😂
The way he just kept asking Phil for help😭😂
So nice and very kuhl very nice
I believe in you Tommy!! Kill that Warden
giorno... theme...😂
Tommy you can make a compass with the echo shards that leads you back to where you died
I haven’t heard Tommy say poggers in so long
Tommy I’m trying
Bro has dream luck 🫢🫢🫢💀💀💀          Edit:bro is also aaaaa Quirked up white boy With a lot a bit of swagger And he is going into the unknown Elsa style 😮
Really enjoyed this video! Really well edited and loved the energy it gave off.  Love Duffle as well.
thats not...cows dont despawn...how long has he been an mcyt again? lmao
duffle is henrys son its cannon
i love how tommy’s builds arent even the best but hes so proud of them, its genuinely so wholesome and heartwearming. the pride and effort that went into them makes them a billion times better
Tommy this is a signnn
Immediately called out 0:31
What a great idea for a challenge 😊 love it!
Tommy went from a vegan to a tree hater in order to grant Duffle some semblance of freedom. That's our Big Man!
haha,no
DAMN BRO DIDN'T GET NO SLEEP
Tommy, trick to kill the warden easily: FISHING RODS
Genuinely good video and waiting to see part 2 !!!
I like snow
Cow won't despawn on a pen
I’ll be brutally honest, one of the best Tommyinnit videos I have seen in a while, I’m resubscribing
who's gonna tell him passive mobs dont despawn-
it's birch
This is a really fresh style for Tommy being pretty much alone (except for a cow). Very good video :)
everytime i hear the intro i realize that i still have respect for this man
Run from it, dreead it. The SMP past will always follow you.
"ELSA STYLE!" - Tommy, 2023
The cow reminds me so much from Henry from DSMP and it’s so sweet
I love this new wholesome vibe Tommy has in this video! It’s a welcome change from the absolute chaos of the other videos, even though the chaos is hilarious. Please keep doing this!!
When this one is finished you should do terraria
This video is just Tommy learning what Philza does on his hardcore world daily lol
Yeah it's wholesome that you were taking care of duffle but he in fact would not have despawned
a
I love the builds they're so nice! Really enjoyed this video - can't wait to see the next one!
3:38 I laughed so hard
i really like how unfiltered the who video and narration was! you should do more laid back videos like this
this video is the best in this year😍
Getting so good at building that Grian would bust? Now my man better build Dwayne something better, Tommy's getting on Hermitcraft @Grian
i enjoyed this very much and cannot wait to see you attempt to kill the warden… good luck ig
Wasn't that what you did when you was at the dream smp? You are still the old tommy, love ya vids mate
I'm so excited for episode two!!! I loved this video!!
use mods.
He did this all of quarantine it’s not new LOL /pos
this video is so comforting and i love it
Straight into the unknown Elsa Style lol
Hypixel skyblock
I like how tommy could just give duffle food to prevent him from despawning but instead had to hunt for a name tag
Oiii Tommy why you not drink beer eh?
Damn Tommy changed from a "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" person to a survival player builder
Tommy play crystal pvp
9:59 missed opportunity to say “moosic”
Tommy I believe in you beat that warden!😃
2 days is just 48 hours.
Suffocate da warden in a hole with gravel
Tommy... you do know that you can very easily get name tags from fishing... right?
"Minecraft's a horror game now" YEP-- WE DONE KNOW
I really liked this video 👍
Dude how long took to your editor to edit this whole vid?!
You should have brought mexican dream
Would love to see a Warden mod
I was crying cuz of a bad haircut but this made me feel better
You have to, now! Pewds did it in hardcore first try, a veeeery looong try, but you can too!!
WhoAH What seed is tht?
bruh killing warden is impossible is not even possible if u have the best armor and full of level 30 enchantment is still not possible
oh my god your house is so pretty!!!
Why you surprised bro you play every other week 🎉🎉
"Ok but what is a fetish"
excellent film, ill show it to my gran
i ❤️snow ⛄️and trees 🌳
Hey Tommy you should do this stuff live on YouTube
No cap y the house look so good
i loved the vid, but, why did the house need to be made out of birch, seriously, why       - camman18
I want more
so, whos gonna tell him that passive mobs just straight up dont despawn?
I got vietnam flashbacks when tommy got a music disc and became friends with a cow
Dreams luck is reserved for cheaters like him
Duffle reminds me of somebody. Someone that starts with h and ends with y :(
I love this new chill style of videos instead of over the top and hyper comedy videos or lore videos
Goodluck trying to kill the warden it has 500 hit points same as the wither and dragon combined
The amount of joy tommy had with duffle actually almost made ne cry.
i love how tomyinnt knows about Elsa and not the deep dark PS so funny🤣
ello ello ello
low key i like this style of content. look forward to seeing more.
this was a very enjoyable video!!!
yoo ur house look cool how!!!
Make sure u destroy all the spawners next time lol
Bro just fish for it
Try playing doors in roblox
You finally have a friend!!!! BRAVO!!
His thumbnail is staring in to my soul
11:06 i get the reference
best video in a while tommy this was awesome
Tommy fish for a name tag next time it is way easier and this video was really wholesome.
0:31 Everyone in the Pacific North West Rn:
KILL THE WARDEN TOM, WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU
Why?
The way the Warden spawned on the other side of the wall, crawling out during the blackness, and then slowly appeared as it lumbered towards you...could not have made a more perfect horror intro if you tried.
i love when tommy uploads
where do i plaey amou ng us.
God, the memories this brings back Also, RIP Tommy's stuff
I don't know about you all but did notice the background music (at the beginning) lol Jojo
dk
Mozt Regular tommyinnit move to do-
I'm sorry, I know this is random, but how does tommy pull off the butt chin so well-
tommy in hannah merch is giving me life
E
POG
Tommy! I’ve never been this early to a video lmao.
I never thought I'd hear Tommyinnit say "ELSA STYLE!"
Tommy: “If you like snow…DIE” Me, a ski racer:
Hi
Everyone when they see the creeper dying to the skeleton: OH OH OH MY GOD
Duffle
In the warden fight u should use potions of turtle master it gives u recistens 4
You can trap him easily and kill him but only use like one weapon and put the rest of your stuff in a chest
AGH!! I missed Tommy's older 2019 - early 2020 video style and his 2021 mod video style, so great to see two nostalgic styles mixed to make a masterpiece:)
the builds in this are pretty good, dude :D /pos
duffle
YES SSIR ITS BOUT THAT GRIND THE SIGMA-MALE GRIND
If you like snow.. DIE the newest Tommyinnit meme
I absolutely loved this pace in video :))))) I still wanna know how something can have curse of vanishing and binding how the fuck does that work 😭
That was epic, tanks Tommy!
"mom and dad show moment"
This video was like substantially better that a lot of the rest
its funny he does not know any thing about 1.19 update
friendly mobs don't despawn in java. that poor cow would have been fine out of the boat
Timmy you need to crouch
5:09 this feeling is way too familiar
Tommy literally doing the hardest things to get Duffle a name tag when he can just go fishing
duffle
This is so refreshing, I love that Tommy is just playing the game by himself without any mods. He doesn't need them to be entertaining!
Do 14 days
Here's a few tips I learned for fighting the Warden (this isn't just for Tommy, it's for everyone) . Get a bow and put the max Power enchantment on it along with unbreaking and, if you can, mending. Don't waste your time with anything else. . Get tons of arrows. If you're lucky, you'll go through half a stack of arrows, but considering there are spawners EVERYWHERE, I'd suggest bringing 5 or 6 stacks if you're not just exploring. . Wardens don't react to fire or lava. I learned the hard way. Wardens can also sWIM UP WATERFALLS. Yea. These fuckers can SWIM. . I'd suggest making some sort of platform that is, at least, 10 blocks high, maybe higher, and make sure the Warden can't get up there, but be sure YOU can get up there QUICKLY. Have some sort of waterfall at the bottom so the Warden will be pushed into one spot. Just make sure it's in a big space or else it can get to the actual waterfall and it'll swim up. . Make a (maybe) 4 block wide opening at the bottom of the platform. Make sure it's somewhere where you can clearly see the Warden, but it can't clearly see you. . Also, make sure to put down as many torches as you can that'll lead back to your platform. One every 2-3 blocks will be good. . I'd also suggest not jumping as you run. Idk, my brain thinks it's bad when you're already making a lot of noise, but I know this doesn't change anything. The Warden is still after you, jumping or not. . Chests WILL alert it. I'd suggest going around and breaking as many spawners as you can before looting the place. It's tedious, but at least you'll be safe from them. . Break the spawners first, then the sensors, THEN get rid of that other deep dark block, the one that looks like the other shiny blocks but doesnt drop XP? I'll come back to this once I have the name, apologies for that. I think those specific blocks are where the Warden spawns as well. I break those as an extra precaution. . When it shoots it's rays at you, no matter what, take a break, eat, get your health fully up, then go back into the fight. If your armor is fully upgraded and enchanted, it'll still only take 2 hits for you to die to that thing. Don't think you can make it, "it only needs a few more shots". No, it's gonna be more than "a few", don't get cocky.  I think that's about it. Good luck out there!
He say 7 days video is long 15 min wdym
It’s funny seeing Tommy keep Duffle in a boat even though passive mobs don’t despawn when they’re near fences 😂
E
This was so good! I genuinely loved this video. It was chill and chaotic at the same time if that makes any sense? Anyway I loved it and I really want a part 2!!
This, together with the video on the new channel, were so nice to watch. Needed this relaxing moment
Cool
YES
Tommy I'm gonna need to see a video of all those singing clips
Duffle :D
.
of course the vid starts with Giornos theme, classic.
Ahhhh it looks like I must die.  God I love snow
4 hours Tommy, Alr more views and likes than half the videos on this app
This is the best thing to watch while on shrooms
Cows don't despawn, the poor  thing could've been free :(
New letsplay???!!!!
and i play on ipad wondering why they made the caves unplayable unless you have torches but then its still hard
*gets cat* "NO. IVE DONE THIS NOW, NOT AGAIN!" 3:12
Your slow!!!
You should play terraria more too tommy! It has alot of new updates nice then
Several years and you still don't know the easiest method is fishing for name tags, auto-farms are super easy (in java) and iron golems can spawn anywhere.
jojo fans: OMG TUMMYINNIT JOJO INTREO REFERENCE!!@!#$!!
good luck on the grind tommy LMAO, from experience from killing the Warden MULTIPLE times, use turtle master potions with strength, regen, and speed just so you have a possibility of survival, perhaps you'll need full enchanted diamond too LMAO - Wardens terrifying
2:01 cows don’t despawn anyway??
A week, is 15 minutes, nice.
i think this is one of my favorite videos of yours.
According to the minecraft's developers the Warden is not meant to be killed, but to be avoided, like a tornado or any natural catastrophe, when a player actually kills the warden, it drops nothing but a sculk catalyst, and many wardens can be spawned (naturally) in the same ancient city, so yes, this is gonna be a horror game lol.
NO YES TOMMY YES SAY YES TO THE DISCS
A good thing to make it less boring is a "to do" list
Lmao
Everyone be talking about music discs and duffle and playing mc normally                 but the nametags......
The cow can only despawn if it can walk a certain amount of blocks like a sheep can despawn if it can walk a 40 by 40
not even gonna lie, tommy’s a fairly good builder
Why did I sit here and randomly think "Damn, tommy should try monster hunter and have alot of pain from it." Even though it has no reason to be thought of
Damn, i turned out to be the 50k like o o
WE NEED MORE!!!
These builds are actually super good! The colour pallets are really nice and fluid, and the leaves are a great touch! For a player who doesn’t build much, it’s really cool to see what you can do when you actually put your mind to it. Very impressive! And an awesome video in total! Can’t wait to see more!
Must have been a long week
This is the best video I have watch in a while
I LOVE THIS OMG DO MORE   aoerhgou;we
GG
Gosh it hurts to see a both curses on a armor and actually puts it on :(
0:31 guess ill die
Create mod when?
the G.O.A.T is back
please quit youtube
Hey Tommy, I realized that you might don’t be a fan of mining trees, however this is just a hunch, in case you somehow don’t maybe you could try and do a tree farm, it could also help you be better at doing red stone, so not only will you be better than Grian in building, you would also be better than Mumbo at doing red stone! However this will only work if you do not enjoy cutting down trees which I’m pretty sure you don’t mind at all!
the discs are calling
I think fishing would have been faster
YES TOMMY DO IT
0:21 starwars reference
0:39 R.I.P Tree  “Even though I’m gone my roots spread across far lands” -Tree🌳🕊️
Ah so that’s where he has been.
“If you like snow *d* *i* *e* “ I live in Arizona 💀 I wouldn’t know what that is-
Theres a setting to turn of darkness pulsating, wardens cannot hear footsteps when walking on wool, it requires full prot 2 diamond to survive the warden on one heart, this is an amazing, video, you're an amazing person, keeping making good videos
no way a series b y tomert simons
I like. Good vido
this is probably the most fun ive ever had watching a tommyinnit video from the past year and i hope to see more of these little videos
Tommy. You need a professional. You need Lukethe Notable. He’s killed the warden hundreds of times and has done 100 days in the deep dark.
Love the idea of a lets play series from you, super hyped!!!
This lets play series is gonna be pretty hype ngl
next to come: return if the creeper
Tommy did you know that passive mobs, like Duffle, dont despawn when fed food. 🤔
I think this is My most favorite Video now
We all know Tommy was missing the SMP, that’s why he made this video and I don’t blame him. We do too.
Hey Tommy what is worse Getting the Absolute crap scratched out of your hand by your cat or jumping off a building
Hey Tommy! If you feed mobs, they don't despawn.  This applies to any feedable mobs :)
bruh he cut off the best part😭
the warden used to be a lot scarier by the way it literally had blood dripping from giant fangs on a sideways face
5:27 that’s what she said 😏
I like how the most wholesome thing about Tommy is his obsession for music disc's, I tell ya.
I loved watching this, it just felt like a casual lets play with the casual Tommy twist. Also who doesn’t love Duffle who is in fact the real main character?
Great video!
You should make this your own survival world to keep and you can make videos about stuff that happened in that world because this world looks really good
Peaceful mobs don't despawn no matter what
The discs that Tommy find gave him war flashbacks 😂😂 Duffle is the best cow ❤❤
I’m sorry but I hope grian sees this just for that one comment… mcc is gonna be interesting if you team😅
Tommy’s the kind of guy to wait years to play an update, then finally plays it, but completely misses all the other updates
The effort that you’ve put into this is insane!
Thanks for distracting me from something distressing, even if only for a bit, Tommy. 🙃
0:32  I’m Canadian and I love snow
The scream's XD
U should rest bc I will damage ur eye if u stay up ur vision will be damage at least get blue light lens glasses like I forgot the name they called it like it make ur glasses see far i forgot but get those ok
Inv tubbo to the world
Is tommy ganna be like surviving mincraft well he died like 2 or 3 times but ishe ganna kill the whither ender dragon and warden?
Love the new content tommy
I really enjoyed this a lot
Gotta say, it's really sweet to see you get so into just. Playing the game again. I have a survival world I've been working on for over a year now and it's still just as much fun as ever. Sometimes it's nice to log on, alone, and spend a few hours zoning out while you build a world full of stories up from nothing. Personally, I like creating lore for every world I make - it keeps the inspiration flowing. Also, highly recommend making a playlist of your favourite bops and putting that on while you play. Nothing quite like it.
awe, classic game :))) more of this please + for the algoritm
Always loved watching tommy I cant wait to see him fight the warden I’ve tried and I’ve failed and I gave up so good on Tommy for not giving up
11:07 Tommy: Its adventure time! Grab your friends! :D Me: Adventure time!        Grab all friends,        We can make it to the End!        With Tom the lad,        And Duffle the cow,        We can do it all!         Adventure time!
that was really cool, like *really* cool. gonna be enjoying this new maybe-series
Give us the uncut content on vods. I am a lover of longform content, especially when it’s intense and quiet.
11:15 “Elsa Style” is now my new favorite thing that Tommy has ever said
A new smp arc
i miss annoying tommyinnit but also this is nice
I love how your going solo now without your friends
Tommy just don’t get scammed by hypixel
Your hair looks nice bossman <3
good luck for that 👍😐
Wouldn’t mining more trees help climate change?
Team climate change pog?
HELLO TOMMY GREAT VIDEO OKAY BYE :)
is this rated R?
These type of videos are what I always like, thank you dude 😄
Davo?!?
Tommy: If you like the snow biome, D I E  emerald duo: ...
Rip Henry  Now we have Duffle
Not even 2 minutes in and I know for a fact that cow is going to die
dont worry i hate snow
dude i love this video
ahhhhhhhh your the best you make me happy thanks
sussy baka moment
WE NEED MORE
the iron golom spawned on the house and cant get down so yeah thats why xD
Ok but why was this video the 5:50 first time I heard Tommy say dude and dang he said it well lol
STOP MAKING ME STIM YOU MF /POS your love for mc anmals is so adorable ):::
He is starting his own smp alone
6:53 memulous: did you forget about your mum
tommy: * hiding from the warden* Warden: * senses tommy and one shots him*
Omg remembering the fetish thing lmfao
0:32 wow you have to go there. I hurt /j
i love the video! but the super Mario galaxy music man... it gives me so much nostalgia i was about to cry when the sad music kick in, remembering how much fun i had playing that game, remembering how id ask my mom to read Rosalinas story to me because i didn't know how to read yet, and playing hours every day so id be as good as my dad sense he introduced the game to me. anyway that's completely unrelated to Mincraft but it made my day!
Its nice to see someone use birch for once
he be playing survival like its hardcore xd
I see this world becoming the tommySMP
The most suprising part of this video is that Tommy built decent things
The thumbnail: Hour 1: Tommy :D Hour 50: *A fucking warden*
Giornos theme goes with anything
I can't believe I got emotional over Tommy dancing with a cow. he just seemed so happy!! (keep it up Tom! I love your videos)
I just kept rewinding on the intro because it’s dope and I have not seen anything like this
I like snow
12:40 W Zelda music
I had a really shitty day at work today, and this video rlly cheered me up. Thanks tommy.
Wait…you’re telling me this was a challenge?…this isnt a common activity?…this was something I could have been making money on?…THIS WHOLE TIME?
The adventure time reference
Who's gonna tell him that passive mobs don't despawn?
this was so good what the fck! love you tommy, thanks for putting in the effort! <3
i saluted tommy at the end of this video- claps to you man this made me laugh sm
Every name tag except for maybe 2 I've fished out of the water. The others were in abandoned mineshaft chests.
Just watching you go into the ancient city gave me so much anxiety!! Holy crap tommy!!!
Bro could have just gone fishing and he would have gotten it in like 20 minutes
One of the best videos you’ve made so far! Feels fresh.
You forgot the redstone room under the statue thing
i like your building style
Nice
MAKE THIS A  SERVER MAKE THE WAR ALL OVER AGAIN TOMMEH
I love this :0 keep it going plz
2:35 ‘I immediately ran back home’ Same King… same.
ngl you need diamond or netherite armor to beat the warden. 😅
"i just burst out into song" the first thing that commes to mind for me ...       JUMP IN THE CADALAC
YOU CAN'T STOP ME TOMMYINNIT I'M STILL GONNA DO DRUGS
WAIT BRO TREES GOVE US OXYGAN
"No! I've done this now! Not again!" All those hours of mining up stone and putting it back in the furnace just to mine it again actually worked. The discs aren't worth it anymore!
This was fucking great, im so oumped for the next ep!
everything is a jojo reference
just incase you didn't know, a passive mob such as a cow will never despawn if it moves 20 blocks in any singular direction from its spawn location! Just incase your thinking of making duffle a family :)
The warden has tons of health and does tons of damage with no reward for killing it, so i definitely wouldnt recommend doing so
cant wait for episode 2!
Honestly, I need this to become a whole series.
6:55 passive mobs don't despawn lol
I WANNA SEE MORE
I like this new style of tommy's videos. Gives a pretty chill vibe which I love. Please keep doing this kinds of videos.
Aww this reminded me of Tommy’s old videos and how excited it made me to hop on MC
He could've just .... ya know.... went fishing... 😭
YOU SHOULD DO VR
TOMMYYYYY MY MANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
bros prime is over
That seems like quite a challenge.
FOR DUFFLE!!!
I love that the epic music is a Hyrule field remix. Just love it lol
One time I slept for 7 days straight.
Ok but the house looks good
you know that passive mobs don't despawn, right? right??
Better bump those numbers up tommy, those are rookie numbers
Canadians in the first minute 💀
"Is it worth it, and is the game still fun" I see where you're coming from 😌
if you want to find i city you have to go into the biggest cave entrance
nahhh grian man
ayyeee tommy's on the grind
3:38 sus
dang dude, you know that passive mobs dont despawn right?
The fact that he could have just gave the cow wheat instead of a name tag.
When you put “farm animals” in an enclosed area they don’t despawn
Henry 2.0
the fact that you mined right into an ancient city from your spawn mountain 😭 so sick
3 years later tommy still hasn’t killed the warden 😂
I just figured out I’m worse at building than Tommy. THAT HOUSE IS BEAUTIFUL! I love how this video is wholesome :D
i love this
should i sub?
Bro found the RAREST disk in the first spawner lol, i've been looking for a while now!
FINALLYY A FUCKING LETS PLAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
30 seconds in and he loses all of his Canadian subscribers with his first statement! 😂
(0:32) I just died. I am now a ghost.
I spawned near a biome where the deep dark city and I was so scared of it that I had to go into creative and destroy anything that allowed it to spawn. I'm scared of that thing and I don't get scared easily, yesterday when I logged on I was shaking and breathing heavily because I didn't want to end up spawning the warden when in the caves.
Tommy is the kind of guy to see a cow called duffle, ask “is anyone going to eat that?” And not wait for an answer
The fact that Tommy has more luck with discs somewhere he *doesnt* need them is quite funny to me
YES! I love tommys series, ive been waiting for another since his trip to New York
Hi, Tommy I'm New 🆕👍
I love just watching people play just normal survival, and Tommy’s humor really makes it even better. Please do more! :D
This series (I hope it’s a series) is going to be awesome! >:D
Wait. Cows don't just despawn
I love how the thumbnail implies that after 50 hours, he BECAME the warden
Tommy i know you back from your skyblock days, anyone who's opened that game knows what actual grinding feels like
another week killing the warden
you dont need a nametag or anything for the cow because its a friendly mob. correct me if im wrong, but i think they dont despawn even if you let them out of the boat :)
No shit Sherlock 3:34
I love how Tommy is still getting disc’s 😂
I actually can't even explain how much I enjoyed this video
to be honest i like watching him actually play the game for once, very cool, i like it
This was freaking awesome. You should stream this please I’m begging you.
Lol Sb737 recently did 24 hours straight
He turned a week into a 15 minute video
"I was gonna have to change my ways, which is a shame because my ways are the best ways" So true king so true
''I'm going straight into the unknown, elsa style'' here's an another quote from Tommy also all the flashbacks when he get discs edit: this  is 1.30 a.m here *_*
Like random but thx you tommyinnit for allowing me to grow up watching you and growing up with you I the process, it's like 3 years later I'm no longer the 15 year old teen in my awkward faze but now a 18 year old returning from "basically" a frat party and now watching your video sobering up as a immature young adult... so thanks for creating this journey I could follow
Wait tommy did drugs 😂
That is truly the most wholesome thing about the this Vedic cause no one does this anymore thanks
Better man than me Tom simons
This made my hole day thank you
Wait he just runs into a ancient city without any reshearch
deffcvgbh
Sub to tommy for the charity thing
Guess I have to die then piece out ✌       I LIKE SNOW OKAY 😭
Could have just fished for the name tag but this was more entertaining I guess
Did you notice something at 7:25 to 31
Umm he could of just zombiefied them so like a weeks grind is only 1 to 3 hours… he knows this right?
Phil is going to be so mad that you got otherside first try.
Can't wait to see this new series
HOW ARE HIS SUBSCRIBERS GOING UP SO FAST IT WAS AT 12.4 ITS BEEN LIKE 30 MINUTES AND ITS AT 12.5 AHHHHHHHHHHH
Hi Tommy Love your Videos
7:11 I always love when he mentions dream LMAOO
'You see duffle in a boat for 4 days, it fills you with determination'
This video was awesome! I cant wait for episode 2!
Tommy probably is going to lose duffle.
11:08 Adventure Time come on grab your friends we’ll go to very distant lands with Jake the dog and Finn the human the fun will never end it’s Adventure Time
him: "we needed a name tag. and where are we most likely to find them?" me: "uh, fishin-" him: "nether. fortress."  me: ". . .if you say so."
Pls continue this Tom! It was soo fun to watch m8!
Who's gonna tell him cows don't despawn
I hate to say it. You could have just finished
The disc flashbacks- BAHAHHAHA   also D U F F L E
Watching Tommy finally build a house, I felt pride in tommy 🥹🥹🫡🫡
I don't think passive mobs can despawn.
Yooooooo "next episode"? This is great, I'm excited to (hopefully) see more dude!! :)
Right above this on my notifs was a video of the worst haircuts in 2023 :) thought that was funny Edit: aside from that I’m so proud that Tommy built such a beautiful house 😭
The fact that his first home is way better than my homes ever.
such cozy vibes fr and the music/editing was all so perfect!! excited to see more of tommy and duffle
No Tommy, it is always worth it
Don't use jojo music unless you watch that stuff bro
Passive mobs don’t respawn, does he know?
2:22 my brightness and sound is always off LMAO I have no sympathy for Tommy here.
Next episode!!
If you whant to now the warden is blind but he can smell you and hear you to now where you are
No one tell him that cows that are fed wheat don't despawn
i love your vids u are helping me in this storm
It’s crazy how much his voice has changed over the years. Actually insane, also how less chaotic he’s gotten. Well he’s still chaotic just more mature lol
In case you do more like this: passive mobs don't despawn!
tommyinnit, you are insane. but we love it.
SwEaRiNg iN tHe FiRsT mInUtE?????!!?!!??!!!!!??? 🤨🤨🤨🤨⁉️⁉️⁉️ Good video tho, well done!
I really liked him just playing the game, especially with his personality and editing style. It was just so interesting and fun to watch! It was also interesting watching his genuine reactions and stuff!
Loved the friendship between Tommy and Druffle. 💖
Good luck sleeping!
Epic
Aight now being serious Hell yeah I was hoping you'd do a series of this sort. So cool dude
my nickname is trees. im hurt.
oh hell yeah! i wanna see more.
41th like or something (this is gonna be past 140k i can tell
Tommy is awesome, it’s always a good day when he uploads. Him dedicating time to Duffle is precious. Watching him mine in the dark was funny. And then he mentioned building something and wanting to be better than Grian, and that was the hardest I laughed. As a firm enjoyer of the Life Series, I’ve seen Grian make amazing builds his worst being the newest “Bad Boys Bread Bridge”. I still couldn’t help but laugh though. And Tommy finding Cat brought some good memories back.
you changes
You should’ve named Duffle Henry JR instead but I still really like Duffle a lot PS you are amazing and your videos make my day 😊
The death at the end reminds me of the the thousands of times I have been destroyed by a boss in Elden ring who comes out of nowhere
Wait till Tommy finds out warden can kill him in two shots even with full prot 4 netherite armor
DUFFLE.

He knows that cows don’t despwan
tommy i love you!!!
I’m so here for this series!   But I don’t even take my enchanted netherite armour to the ancient city, because even with that the warden can kill me in like 2 hits, so I take a bed, a load of wool and sneak about naked. If I do trigger the warden I place a chest, put all my stuff in it and accept my fate.
I love the simplicity of this video, you've really come far as a creator and after lots of years of your content this has to be up there with some of my favourite videos of your's; keep up the good work man :)
Also I hate snow
who's going to tell him he didnt need a name tag for the cow not to despawn?
This looks like a brilliant start to a new adventure!
Make it into a series TommyInnit
Neutral mobs don't de-spawn so you put Duffle in a boat for no reason. Abuse!
His best face ever at 0:41.5
Same
Tommy thinking that passive mobs despawn...
you say you hate anime but the fact that you are using Jojo Golden Wind is making me question that statement
who is going to tell him passive mobs dont despawn
Put it on your vods
I hate snow I an in Canada
For some reason this is giving me nostalgia but i really don't know why
I find it funny how he doesn't know that animals like cows don't despawn even without being on a boat or named.
Hello
I am so excited for this new series!!
Tommy still with his gf? We haven’t heard a mention in a while😮
Proud that Tommy finally spent the time to make a decent build, it took long enough!
Tommy: next episode, I'm gonna kill the warden. Also tommy: goes back. Tommy after that: where is the warden
Can't wait to see you next video Bossman
wow
omg a tommy innit video from not long ago😨
JOJOMUSIC
should I go to tommys tour say yes or no ⬇️
We wanna see more :)
Ughhh good luck
What the heck I started a new survival world around 7 days ago too   Tommy's slow
He gonna die over 100 times lol
The warden has more health than the ender dragon so good luck
just fyi, peaceful mobs don't despawn!! you only have to worry about putting hostile mobs in boats
Little tip Tommy look in the deep dark look for enchantments called Swift sneak they allow you to move faster while sneaking good for getting away from wardens and moving quickly while not setting of shriekers remember that they go on the pants also bring a ton of wool it's the only block that doesn't set off skulk sensors on it and avoid being detected by the warden just don't get too close to it because it can also smell you
Ive missed normal lets play videos! And with the new commentary over top it combines the classics with the short-form 100days style to create a very endearing series! :D
I have a feeling this is going to become my comfort video. For some reason I was smiling the whole video
Tommy being so close to a cow was honestly really wholesome
DUFFLEEE AWWWWWWWHH, I jumped when the warden killed Tommy.
Literal character growth
A warden can kill players in prot 4 netherite
200 days in my hardcore world going strong
lol otherside in a dungeon chest is a 2% chance
Tommy, I don't know how to tell you this, passive mobs don't despawn, you didn't need the name tag
He can’t moo-be around the ban, Tommy I’m not impressed
Sorry to all the fellow canadians watching this video like me :(
Good vid
How does he still have a girlfriend after doing his man she must really like tommy
11:04 uh, did you hear the part about risk? 😂😂😂😂
Man Tommy gonna have problems with that warden
nice
passive mobs don't despawn
Idk anything about the ancient City either
Oh no he’s turned into a warden
I actually really liked this video, the editing seemed pretty professional and Tommy's humor has changed a bit and I like it a lot. Love to see more of this :)
Good luck Tommy you are gonna need it. And lots of chickens!🐓
I felt that death
Did you make that out of birch
It's very nice Tommy.
11:06 the adventure time reference made me so happy omg
If u like snow die!😂
i literally love the fact that he has a soft touch for pixel animals (mainly duffle) its so sweet
BRO, the first non-square and non grass-top house ive seen tommy built! props
hi
WHY DID YOU DO GRIAN LIKE THAT 😭
7:00 Tommy, cows dont despawn
Beautiful home Tommy!
I'm almost certain that passive mobs don't despawn when fed? Like, my farm mobs certainly never despawn, and I never nametagged them or kept them in a boat XD
Disc war trauma
7 days worth of game playing in 15 minute :0
I love how tommy chose a cow for a pet because uhhh      *Henry*
Love that Tommy is back on the grind again wish you the best of luck mate
Alright father Innit I'll go die.
CHILD.
we need more stuf like this
ok but Tommy’s obsession and dedication to give Duffle the best is actually really wholesome
I have to say, I absolutely love this video. Seeing your genuine emotions and efforts towards playing not for any purpose other than just playing the vanilla game is really lovely. I picked up Hermitcraft at the start of Season 8 and began really loving this style of video and am super happy that you’ve done at least one in this style. Thanks for the wonderful video Tommy! :)
this video is awesome
Really enjoyed this video, Tommy! Can’t wait for the warden fight!
Your house is so cute!
Bro insulted SB373, ” ”IF YOU HATE SNOW, FUCK YOU!” ”
me and my freinds spawn traped the warden and farmed it so i say we are now experts at the game.
This was so great 😃
I think duffle was a paid actor
i love how tommy said " next episode I'm going to kill the warden " meanwhile his health 500 hearts ; - ;  (   i love u tommy 🤟🤟🤟 )
Nah when you put on the music and Duffle did the Duffle Shuffle, goes hard. Went crazy.
WOOOO SEE YA NEXT EPISODE:D
i like the new kind of video you're putting out
Tommy in your next video you should try To kill the warden with like Phil,Charlie, Tubbo and Wilbur. It will be just like old times
OH MY GOD I WANNA SEE MORE OF THIS! An actual let's play is going to be so cool!
5:24 WOAH, IT'S WULZY!
Tommy put all that effort in to stop the cow from despawning and put it in a boat for the entire time until he got a nametag but passive mobs like cows dont actually ever despawn so he didnt even need the nametag lol
I only like snow because it is fun to pelt people with a million snowballs
Seeing Tommy makethe house makes me think he might get invited to hermitcraft
What's the seed????
Now we reach the point- t o u c h g r a s s
And its still gonna 3 ir 4 shot you ir ur not careful
This was genuinely a refreshing take on a very oversaturated game. Well Done!
Pears
funniest part is that you can't even find name tags in fortresses
I really enjoy this type of editing style for the video, and I love the calm vibes. I'd love to see more fo this type of tommycontent.
Seeing tommy playing 1.19 just vibing is reminding how fun the game is
Just to let you know, when you kill the warden it drops nothing and another one spawns. Also I’m sorry about your absent dream-luck. I can relate.
U gonna need netherite to kill the warden enchantments and maybe pocions
I swear tommys favorite passive mobs are cows or smth
What if i like eating snow?
More like 7 days gay  Got em?   Yeah. I think
death to the warden
Tommy, cows don't despawn 😂
I should play this game again man
"IF YOU LIKE SNOW DIE" -TOMMYINNIT 2023
I love that he puts all his effort into his vids to make them the best he can for us:D
hey for once i am kinda early
This title💀💀💀
@Grian 3:30
i love how when he came face to face with the warden, he just stood there in absolute terror and fear of this abomination
I honestly think this is one of my favourite videos from Tommy. It’s simply just block game but it’s beautifully done. It has a totally different vibe yet I still feel like I’m watching a regular old Tommy video. I love it.
<3333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333
Tommy always research a new update even if it’s a trash YouTube tutorial. The warden scared crap out of my 21 year old sister
Why did you use birch 🤮
Can we all just agree that even if some jokes are offensive, the intro is epic
Dang it I am 2 hours late But I'm here I love this vid!
“It’s adventure time come on grab your friends” my favorite line because that’s like my favorite show
You didn’t have to keep Duffle in a boat. Animals only despawn if they can create a 16 block path. The hours of grinding for a name tag was meaningless
Is this a great moment to tell him that cows don’t despawn? (Just like Chicken, Sheep and other non violent mobs)
insanity
THIS VIDEO WAS SO FUCKING COOL
This stone of my favourite videos of yours
He's acting like he doesn't already do this
More Duffle! We love Duffle he's extremely poggers!!
cant wait for the empire strikes back
i mean you could have very easily used the Dream "luck"...... cause it just involves cheating....
Duffle Shuffle???? 😆
you remind me of my cousin
THE WHOLE TIME HE WAS JUST STANDING IN FRONT OF THE WARDEN I WAS LIKE” FUCKING RUN, FUCKINGGG RUN”  The new update is genuinely a horror game
more types of videos like this pls
ONG THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE TOMMY MADE A JOJO REFERENCE YAY IM SO HAPPY
If you want tips on the warden watch dantdms video it helps alot
damn..
We need name tags and where are we most likely to find them? Nether fortresses. :Fishing  did you forget I exist?
I'm an ♈too love u ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ᵇᵗʷ
WAIT i swear passive mobs don't despawn
The warden is blind so use that to your advantage
I JUST LOVE HOW HE SPENT DAYS JUST TO MAKE A COW A HOUSE
Loved the Adventure Time reference. Can’t wait for the next episode.
Pog that is all that is needed to be said :)
Bomb it
Does Tommy ever make bad content?
Yknow you can actually get name tags pretty easy if you start fishing
Good
wait, tommy didnt know that diamonds are easier to find in 1.19?
Hey Tommy
Why is the disc blue and green though?????😂
More now
I love the classic style to the videos. Gives me flashbacks to demonstrate vids 😢
I recommend the client lunar
Play grounded
Hello pls replay 😢
Tommy is a true gamer
Nice change of pace and fun to watch. Keep up the good work :)
I feel like I should mention it again 5 shot you in full netherite protection 4
Duffle<Henry
Tommy... only hostile mobs and special passive mobs despawn. You did not need to get the name tag or the boat...
4:48 IM SORRY?!
i really enjoyed this video. idk what else to say lmao
Awesome start
The funny thing is that Tommy spent so much time trying to get a name tag but fishing is really easy and in 30mins you can get live 5 lol
Loved it
More please
i truly love your personality and your just the best youtuber ever
The warden genuinely made me jump 😅
UPLOAD THE UNEDITED 9 HOURS 😡😡😡
Yoo that was really nice to watch. We want more now
when i started watching the vid was on 57k views and now after finishing (15 mins) it on 128k
tommy peaked last year 😐
6 years later tommy will know we can get a nametag in 15 minutes fishing
He finnaly made a good base😂
Tommy: "If you like snow, DIE Canada: ...
nice star wars references
Mans really learned to build out of boredom
Bro you're going insane
If you like snow… *diE*
Ahhhh
duffle the king
only 7 days🤡
LMAO I CANT-
Wait till he realizes passive mobs dont despawn
YEHEHEAAAAAH
Its quite funny that he does not know passive mobs (cows, pigs, etc) do not despawn😂
the warden is really hard to beat
this feels weird to say but as someone that watches both sides of the mcyt community i feel so proud of him seeing him genuinely wanting to build things n all,, like MAN he even tried to decorate his nether portal,, it just feels heartwarming to me
how do you make such great builds yet don't realize passive mobs don't despawn
LOVE
15:12 i laughed so hard like pls
It was so fun and refreshing to have someone play the game and looking on new updates without previous knowledge i loved this video a lot, also the editing is incredible i didn't even realise time passed
When is the next video coming out????? Does anyone know
awesome stuff big man !
Haha a new hope (star wars)
I can't even play for 2 h straight 😭
Its nice knowing he doesn't know the warden is stronger than the ender dragon, and maybe even the wither
this is so good, keep up this series
THIS VIDEO WAS AWESOME
get Fulbright
nice vid
The best 15 minutes of my life, better than the dream smp XD
The house was really cool looking!
Pog
cant wait for a pt 2
Amazing video Tommy U should have named the cow Henry tho for the og vibes
WOOOLLLL
Passive mobs don't despawn naturally, so you definitely didn't need to keep Duffle in that boat.
This videos it's so...idk It's different in the best possible way, I hope you make more videos like this :)
I need more of this
Why do I get the feeling that animators are gonna animate tommy and duffle as cute friends
Duffle MY beloved <33333 I love Duffle more than any of you could know because well- none of you know me lol. :D
Oh holy Duffle
amazing video! makes me want to get back into my hardcore world
whats the music at 1:47? it sounds like a different version of the super maro galaxy 2 end credit song but i cant find it anywhere
Cows don't despawn though right? Or am I just dumb
And let the chaos ensue
Tommy is on his name tag collecting arc. Fr tho, it was awesome to watch and I didn’t even know the warden existed T-T
Why is the time lapse wood placing like asmr-😳
hi
We need more Tommy Let's Play
WOOOO
Everytime tommy gets a disc I somehow get both really nice nostalgia and war flashbacks
This was actually so very lovely!
wanted to be first comment. beat by 2,000 and a half people.
this style of video was so enjoyable keep it up dog
Duffle be a celeb now---
3:12 Not the disc Era again 😭😭😭
i love the jojo music at the start
ok so is tommy going to get me back into mc? yes.
What is that thumbnail
A NEW VID, WOOOO!!❤
Yo I love this vibe!!! Duffle is adorable, you should find him a friend!!!!❤️❤️
first video of u that i like in 2 years. gg continu
The mario galaxy music giving me nostalgia
POGGGERS
not even one minute in and birtish person doesn't like snow like oh my god do you like any other weather than rainy come on man
a great video!
Wait till he finds out passive mobs do not despawn. No boat or name tag needed
Tommy’s story telling is actually on another level…🔥🔥
yay
It is not bad, than others dirt hut,but it was fun, so if you please continue playing like this, make a series, your reactions were genuinely hilarious.😂❤❤❤🎉
Already excited for the next episode😜
AAAAAAAAHHHH! BIIIIIIRCH LOGGGS!!! *SELF DELETE*
ive been missing 2020 a lot recently and this is just what i needed. love you tom :))
DUFFLE FOR WORLD DOMINATOR
3:12 LMAOOO
Why do you sound like your Australian?😂
1 hr in and the grind has already started
No mater matter what a tommy vid never disappointed me like if u agree👍👍👍👍👍
epic
I was waiting for this for so long bro finally
Bro, just feed him one wheat, and the cow is not going to despond
tommy with the dsmp disc war flashbacks
After watching this video I can indeed confirm we all have zero braincells.
Nice video idea Tommy 💯
All the lore references made me cry
I'm now just waiting for someone to draw tommy with duffle
Duffle reminds me of Henry (o7)
I really hope he can beat the Warden next time
Grian? did you bust?
the only british who gives freedom to innocents(i am from india)
Tommy all you needed is to feed duffle some wheat and he wouldn’t despawn since it counted as a interaction which then doesn’t let him despawn
Very nice change of pace. Big man's back to his roots.
Maybe after you kill the warden, maybe make a tree farm! There’s like a hundred different kinds and will help cut down time from chopping down trees!
Tommy really doesn’t know cows and all passive mobs don’t despawn???
Hi
I'm glad I watched a video that wasn't posted 1+ years ago!
Bro i subscribed only because you said you hate snow. I would say you have a good opinion
I loved this new series, proud of you Tom
ay early at last
Heroin come second got me😂
NICE!!!
Bro I felt the same about the game and you made it interesting again   Smashed it
3:40 was so funny!
tommy cows , cheeps , chikens and pigs never despawn if you feed them
I recently started an origins mod single player world and I found a disc in a dungeon… it was disc 13 😂
I'm 13 now and had several dreams Abt the fcking warden
THE SERIES BEGINS!
KEEP DOING THIS ITS GOOD
I cant be the only one who saw a pink sheep around 9:25
Good vid.
I only saw that clip for the first time today: 9:50
wow- tommy just playing the game? cool!
Now that Tommy has made a nice house, the next step is to join Hermitcraft.
Ummmmmmmmmmmm my inner health expert is telling me this is unhealthy
7
Nobody: Tommy: promoting deforestation
I really hope that Tommy will stream some of this on his twitch…
Here
The warden respawns after you kill it
Why is Tommy so rude to Americans
Wow. I am literally just speechless... 😮
:))
Ahh id love to see more videos like this!
Next episode I’m gonna kill the warden Famous last words
nobody tell him that passive mobs dont despawn
I LOVE DUFFLE SO MUCH
I love seeing Tommy just being him ❤
Poor Tommy.. If he only knew that neutral mobs don't despawn 🥲
Oh this was so much fun watching!! Big smile across my face throughout the entire video (well except for ancient city, but it was still funny to see how you knew absolutely nothing) excited for episode 2!!
tommy’s hair at 3:50 looks VERY ✨fluffy✨
good vibes :) like seeing some chiller stuff on this channel
You can go fishing to get a name tag
Absolutely love this type of chill content and you manage to make it very funny as well. Always leaves a smile on my face, even when my mood is dowm
adventure time come on grab your friends we're of to very distant lands with Jake the dog and Finn the human the fun will never end it's Adventure time
Never thought I’d see the day tommyinit would actually try building something.
omg YES!!!! I've been wanting to watch a new regular survival gameplay for So Long, and to see one of my favourite youtubers do it is amazing!!! keep it up bossman
that was such a fun video to watch, I need more of this!!!!!
Tommy pls heart this
"Goodbye tree, Fu*k you and your oxygen" -TommyInnit 2023
Amazing
Jojo 🎶
Amazing
Sick
The “Elsa style” had me dying 🤣
YES FINALLY! TOMMY THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST CONTENT
nice
I wish you the best of luck when killing the Warden. (Maybe ask philza for tips he seems to know a lot about this game) (no fuckng shit he played for so may yer ahf hasmgt....so yeah again good luck!
W this series will be entertaining
Tommy gave us serious war flashbacks with the dsmp references
killing the warden???? good fucking luck man
1 hour gang
Bro has not kept up with the updates his reactions though I can't get over it!😂
coulda planted trees near the house 💀
We need another episode
Omg i love u my Brother❤❤❤❤😂😂
good videyah, toimehh yinnet
This is suck a funny video so different from the others
Elsa style
I've never felt more called out by a video title in my life
It’s the Tommy SMP
I didn't know how much I needed this
In other words this is tommyinnits survival lets play
An hour late huh?
Tommyinnit “if you like snow, die” Me- lives in a snow biome. Me *stops watching video and comments *
I loved this
I remember the times of him saying if you think im annoying
ig the Dream SMP hype died
lol xD😂
Terraria time fr
I want a TommyInnit renaissance so bad you have no idea
never clicked so fast bruh
Im pretty sure passive animals don't despawn
Only one way to get a name tag   I guess fishing for like 10 minutes wasn’t quicker then making a master level village
this is proof that tommy is lying about his girlfriend
Who else loves his content?
Trust me, killing the warden isn't worth it. Just avoid him by walking on wool. He won't hear your footsteps
This is fun to watch with no mods  Thanks Tommy
Tommy you could have just fished to get the name tag
He won't despawn. He's not a mob. Noob :p
I have a feeling Wilbur will make Tom mine trees again at some point just for the bit
Oh hi tommy
You should have named the cow « Henry »
Yes tommy, kill that big scary shitt of a mob.
“Mossy base” and it’s not even moss lol
epic new series! excited to see where it goes :)
Jo joooos good anime brooo
Omg I loved this, funny and relaxing you should deffos do more things like this x
YES MORE PLS
ok but that house looks so good? wtf
Oh no tommy
mama
This was so cozy and fun LOVED IT :DD keep it up king :D
now spend 7 days straight outside
tommy, don't get mad at those people calling you stupid for keeping your cow in a boat. you didn't know, and that's ok.
114k views in 1 hour! Ggs
good
YES Please keep playing the normal game Even if you have to make up quests! keep building!
This was so good omg
peaceful mobs don't 'randomly' despawn.       like 99% sure.
Elsa style LAMO
lollll i love the name duffle (lol duffle kuffle)
OMG we need a part 2!!!!!!!!
Tommy, you know you can fish for name tags. It takes much less wood and time
We need a whole MC series with just Tommy hard core
so who's gonna tell him that passive mobs don't despawn,,
i would give my life to duffle
Tommy: *sees the discs*  IT'S NOT HAPPENING AGAIN!   Me: He's getting Music Disc PTSD again.
DREAM SPM
Finally an interesting Tommy video
<<<< Tommy being friends with a cow
Lmao when I was watching this the fuck you tree popped on and my parents were right there
TOMMY. Just so you know killing the warden is almost impossible :)
Glad your back :)
tommy passive mobs dont despawn, only hostile ones. you didnt need to put duffle in a boat 😢 also your house is really cute i like it a lot!
kill the warden tommy
WOOOO!
Genuinely the funniest video you've uploaded in a while. Its not high energy, nor does it have a bunch of mods and people in it. Its just you and a creative vision which is so wholesome and entertaining to watch unfold :)
Check Chiefy and Branzy they know how to fight the warden.
Look at duffle man, so inspirational
Did he just cross out Betty and Walter 😢
13:43
"holy shit Minecraft's a horror game now"                                                                 -tommyinnit  2023
I heard that the Warden can kill a player in full Netherite in two hits.  Love your content!
😂
I have found it. Ladies and gentleman, I introduce the all new grinding channel. (For those who don’t know play this in the background of u playing a game it helps so much.)
8:50 why that talking is like a study motivaion talk
Liking this new survival series Tommy
It's really good to see u actually playing again
I honestly love the shift of comtent. It’s still entertaining for a young audience, but also leaves room for people like myself that have matured. Keep up the great work Tommy! ❤️
Just because of that house tommy ur my favourite
This is poggers
It took him a while to lose everything
" WHY AM I SO SMALL?! " I wanna say it, but I shouldn't.
I was crying Alot and was gonna Kms but after watching Tommy I feel so much better  Tommy is the sweetest soul
Very enjoyable video. I look forward to the next.
This has no right to be that funny. HOW DARE YOU TOMMY NOW IM LATE FOR WORK
u can also get name tags by fishing… i fished in my world when i was bored and got many, many name tags
Tommy “I HAVE A HOME AND NO DIMSS” Me.       “same”
Yippeeeeee
10:15 bro said it like it was an achievement
Tommy’s videos are so entertaining even know his uploading could be better. ❤
If you like snow, haha, DuiE
i love his little bounce when hes dancing with duffle!!!
OH NOO !! THE BIG MAN IS BACK NOW
fell off
Its been an hour I'm never this early :00
soo if the warden spawns, just like run, ( also to kill him you can trap him in a hole and bow him ) thats all i know lol!
So u don't have to cut down trees you can build an automatic tree farm!!! And love u Tommy ❤❤❤❤❤
Bro cut down 7 days worth of footage into 15 mins
I love it already, it’s chill but exciting and I loved the little flashbacks! I hope this will be a series!! :)
Ok now do a month
.
reeeeeee
i love how the warden just one shots him lol
Wait so how is this different than usual?
Great video as always keep up the good work!
“If you like snow…           DIE”  Best quote 💯% relatable
Bro replaced Henry
Literally can't wait for the next episode<3 Great job big msn
Tommy you know feeding a mob makes it not despawn right?
Me and everyone else watching as Tommy triggers the third shrieker
“It’s a new boss” oh no
Star Wars reference he said new Hope in the title
I would've killed duffle at the start without  even thinking about it.
1 hour late
Bro looks criminality insane in the thumbnail 💀💀💀
Omg lol
You neeed 7 iron golems to kill 1 warden
this reminds me of the Tom channel
Another great video.
GO TOMMY!!!
RYTH
lmao
HOW HAS IT BEEN AN HOUR AND THERES ALREADY 2359 COMMENTS AND 26K LIKESSS??????
The more I watch you the more I think you act like my little sister
You should make this a single player, seres
RYTHx
If you like snow 😇    D i e
I can see Phil dying inside cuz of Tom finding Otherside that easily, when he spend so long looking
NOT THE MUSIC DISC MEMORY ON THE BENCH WITH TUBBO 😭😭😭 YOU CANT DO THIS TO ME TOMMY
You did a good job on the house
ree
Honestly, Mogang should make an update where you can tame the Warden.
3:38 WHAT!?!
TommyInnit
Someone tell him cows don’t despawn
“So if you like snow hehe 𝐃𝐢𝐞.”-Tommyinnit 2023
gosh I’m so early
I like snow :>
Welp i think Tommy found some things he hates trees snow bioms and the warden
Farming is way easier than building (in my opinion) just place down a 4x4 hoed bit of land with water in the middle place some seeds and just wait and watch, it's fun
Just the vanilla mc again, very nice to just watch him play the game and vibe with it. 10/10 would watch again :D
TOOMY found something new to do for once
3:36 w h a t
Maybe not
The discs, the cow, the crying to Phil for help. The good old days. :]
Maybe
hi hru
I'm so proud of him for doing this  :DDDD
Yes
Tommy : if you like snow… d I e  Also Tommy : lives in the UK (for all of you souls out there, it fucking snows every winter and sometimes spring and not tiny little ‘Look snow! But it won’t stick to the ground’ no hon it’s sticking, and there’s 12 inches of it
tommy, buddy. Peaceful mobs don't despawn without a nametag. Only hostile mobs.
I wonder if hes going to have to fight a green teletubby for the music disc
I’m to terrified of the warden to even explore the ancient city tbh😭
duffle duffle duffle duffle duffle duffle duffle duffle duffle duffle
This was a w video
*tommy be like*  I HATE YOU TREE AND YOUR OXYGEN
I think he should spend 50 hours in real life
No
Is this lets play series like pewdiepie? Got the named cow and everything
Tommy’s building has improved so much! this video was so fun to watch! keep up the good work Tommy
Oh tommy I love u 😂
Godlyy
i love this style of videos!
Tommy are u ok
Bro did you releaze that bedrock players dont have beightnes :I
You should try building farms or trying to get elytras to find the game interesting again!
The "you are" and "don't know why" 😭
Every 4 year olds dream
I relate so much to that fear in Tommy's eyes in the ancient city. I started my first MC world in about 3/4 years a couple weeks ago and accidentally built my base (including mines) right above the ancient city😂 it did not end well
Tommy made a challenge out of what I do everyday of my life
hey tommy are you a jojo fan? cos u keep on adding jojo music to ur vids
If you Seek for ancient City be awhere the Warden, he cant see but he listen, even with netherite he can kill you fast.
Chic tip ivorytv made a video i killed 1000 wardens With end crystals you shud shaek dat out btw sorry if my riting is a litel bad im swedish
for some reason the vibes of this video hit just right, id love to see more :)
TOMMY DID DRUGS HE IS A CHILD HDFKJSHFUHEWIUHEIU
If you like snow, haha *die* Me, as a Norwegian: you have offended me and all my people, but I agree with you
HI
"fuck you i don't like oxygen" is the most british thing i've heard
7:43 it touched my heart when I heard this music.
This is such an amazing video as always I can't wait to see more of this content. (also Duffle is a very cute name)
Yeah, I hate snow too. Also, did you see that Mojang is adding a new biome? the Cherry Blossom biome!
4:20 I also randomly burst into song. Welcome to the Theatre Kids!
…
This is an amazing video. I might just take an inspiration from it :]
everyone keeps saying how wholesome this video was and ill i have to say is among us
56mind ago I was dead
YOOOO REVENGE TIME FOR TOM
At the start, Tommy gave duffle a better place to live than his own home. Such commitment .
DreamSMP Season 2 in the new Version is gonna be great, but you need to wait for the 1.20 update
My question Is how tf did he take 7days to make the progress got. I would literally take 5h to do what he got
I can’t even stay awake for 6 hours
you can get about 12 nametags in 4 hours of just fishing with normal, unenchanted fishing rods xD
You can tell you had fun making this video.  Or at least recording the commentary
This next video is not gonna go well Imao
Pog warden fight
Another Day Of Mayhem
Don't swear or curse or i will unsubscribe and dislike
i was playing with my friend, and we spanned over an ancient city
Tommyinit u can’t get a name tag from the nether 😐 u can get it monster spawner rooms mansion from villagers and mineshaft
This will be my fav tommy series
give duffle a girlfriend
“WHY AM I SO SMALL?!”  Size doesn’t matter Tommy.
bro passive mobs dont despawn lol
hi Tommy!
BUFFLE MY BELOVED <33 Also this was a blast watchin pls do more /nf
Jojo
Why
i was here ( 1 hour uploaded) currently playing ksp
🎉 LES GOOO HE UPLOADED 🎉
The fact that he found the rarest disc in a monster spawned is crazy luck
I like this video, Tommy.
We love phil
BABA BOI
honestly i started to get bored of tommy and his fast paced edited content and wow this was amazing
this was probably the best video I've watched and will watch all week, REALLY nice to see tommy just playing the game, and to see him out of his comfort zone.. loved this really!! <333
Hello
you already do this
what music did he use when he was going back to spawn? I am a huge zelda geek and want to know because god damn that was good
amazing vid you really inspire me big man
If this is gonna be a series i’m so excited!
"if you like snow, d i e" I will now perish in my snowy biome
The grind is real. Techno would be proud
Duffle yo son?
Mojang: the warden is a boss that you're not supposed to kill, it doesnt even drop anything! Literally everyone else:imma go ahead and ignore that, chief
netherite and bells. make a bell rining machine. it should distract him
Pasive mobs dont despawn
I like this style:) No pressure, just doin' what he wants
Holly shit we’re doing episode type stuff now
I like how tommy doesn’t realize that the cow wouldn’t despawn as shown by the millions of other farms
I love how he hates and loves Duffle at the same time lol
I really likes this video allot more then i thought i would
Tommy actualy Bildung goog house
Tommy’s going on his Grian arc!
i really enjoyed this video just because he is playing the game without mods and challenges happy to hear that their wil be a next epsisode
Ayo, was that a Jojo’s reference?!
duffle. the reincarnation of henry. i missed him 😭
YESSSSSS
just killed a woman, feeing good
Finally, a Tommy upload.       I've been waiting for this moment for decades.
This is a very Tommy thing to do.  Edit: Except for singleplayer
Awh Henry would be so proud.
Im excited for this series lets gooooooooo i really hope u find more fun and you get to fly and have shulkers <333
I love how he realized the caves and cliffs update while it was out alot of months ago
I'm actually really excited for the next episode!
You have to get carpets to stand on so the warden doesn't know you are there because it can sense movement
I haven't watched tommy in a really long time I forgot how enjoyable he is to watch  When he says "not again" to any disc is that a disc war thing or something else?
He played so much that he turned into the Warden.
Just playing the game is still fun!  Glad to see you get into it!
Tommy just being himself and playing the block game is fun enough for me. And my god do I LOVE DUFFLE. he dunks his head in tommy chest cuz he loves his boi AND I LOVE HIM BACK!
Jump scare fr
I can just hear the AUs comming from this
0:31 “if u like snow die” 😢👎🏼😞 winters my fav season
EPIC
Amazing video I loved watching you be amazed at updates that happen so long ago and I had the same reaction hope to see more 👍
@Dangthatsalongname what do you think of Tommy’s house?
the ' not again ' when he got the disc hasngfhd
Bro turning into old MrBeast
0:31 I'm a Texan, and I have never agreed with someone more than this
I wanna see Tommy do a no swearing challenge😂 That would be hilarious.
Yes.
Now do a hardcore video and make your e-dad  proud
Comrade I have suffered with snow back in Siberian Russia, snow was good friend of mine.
“I’m going straight into the unknown, ELSA style.” -Tommyinnit 2023 my favorite line ever 😂
i love how he didn’t even need to keep duffle in the boat cos it’s a passive mob and thus won’t despawn
Why do I love this? 😂
What have you done?!
yeah tottally worth it...
When u said fuck oxygen I cried because legends like u wilbur philza ranboo tubbo and Charlie wouldn't be alive. It sounded way better in my head imagine this comment isn't here✌
Tommy, you didnt need to keep Duffle in a boat... Farm mobs dont despawn....
Tommy is going to die of suffocation calling it.
common tommy W
5:48 MUSIC DISCS
it says im first but i see comments
This video was so fun to watch :)
Tommy trying his damn hardest not to use discs as lore material
Like everyones saying its really cool to see tommy play alone and regularly. Also that hes taking it seriously and only died twice is pretty neat.
as an avid vanilla mc player, it pains me to see that he went to the nether first before going to the village, THAT WAS RIGHT NEXT TO HIS HOUSE, in search for a name tag, no water bucket for the cave systems or for fall damage, no ender pearls or potions of fire res (piglin trades), no wool or high quality armour for the ancient city. this was an absolute pain to watch, very cool 100% recommend.
Henry
Cow don’t despawn
Music discs... Music discs
Tommy you do know that passive mobs doesn't despawn right? There's no need to keep them in a boat or give them a nametag
W house honestly. Better than anything I could do
7 whole days! Wow
NEW SERIES YEAHHHHHH
This video just vanished 15 mins of my time (also first min)
The disc lore refrences lol
I love Tommy’s relationship with Duffle! It’s so wholesome I love it so much
Phill: The Warden can do 45 hearts of damag-. Tommy: I'M FUCKING ON IT
Loved this Ngl
0:20 Don't let Disney see this.
Bruh
a
duffle replaced tubbo
I love that Tommy is so proud of everything he does like even small builds and little challenges
If you feed a animal with food they no longer despawn. Also 3 strikes and gameover wool helps stop the warden and sensors from detecting you
Ever just think about how it took one of the best modern mcyt’s to FIND a ancient city?
You realize that the boring parts were because you always have your chaotic friends with you, right?
W duffle chain
0:31 i mean, i have a gun in my room, its fake but still
I never knew Tommy could build that well 🤯✨
LOVED THIS TOMMY! so simple and funny, the editing was really cool too :))
how dare you i love the snow :(
SUB HOUR
Wow
I scrolled up in my messages, only to see a message from my best friend for last easter saying “I just ate a whole chocolate bunny and now I feel sick.”
He needs to do more of these
The Jojo music🤌
The cow reminds me of henry... Rip man rip
I so wanna see Tommy get better at building
I love this, if this becomes a series I will watch every episode
Best Tommyinnit video. No contest. It's just so fun to see you play the game.
I didn't expect a solo letsplay to get me so invested but it did!!! looking forward to you um. killing the warden 😭😭   I mean if double life is to judge you can just kill him with the fishing rods but um 😃 good luck
I thought I was the only one...

Hii tommy big fan and I love your videos and your building:)
No matter the universe, Tommy will always persevere for the sake of his cow.
you saying "next episode" made me ligjt up. i'm excited to see more of this content type!!
Tommy… holy crap. Honestly man.. this video was one of the best videos you have genuinely ever created.the commentary,the effort,i swear i forgot i was sitting at my desk watching this video. Good job.
Do a let’s play tommy
cows don't despawn even while in boats
more content! we love you
Bro can this be like a series or sm like idk "exploring 1.19" or sm CUS this is fucking awesome
damn this is going to be one of my favourite tommyinnit videos for sure
bro the way he was like: MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SNOW BIOME IS EVEN- and i thought he was gonna say "better", but he said: EVEN WORSE. *laughs*
I was wondering where he was for 7 days.
Hey tommy have a great day!
This might be my new favorite TommyInnit video!
Hello
If you like snow die
he didn't realise that only hostile mobs despawn
MORE! I DEMAND!🤣🤩
I love this format of videos dude, it's so great
Imagine being Philza and doing the same shit for a living
lolll
Nice
This video was really good!! Can't wait for ep2!!!!
Love how Tommy explore the game now , no script .
Is it just me or did the cow remind you of Henry. I thought he was going to name it Henry as well.
Mans climbs to the summit before digging down
WE LOVE TOMMY🫶🫶
yay
Yoooooooo
early
Peaceful mobs like cows don’t despawn…
I know it wasn't intentional but I like the implication that within 50 hours tommy turned into the warden
You did what
This made my day
Hi tommy
wow
Tommy never  dissapoint us with his videos :)
Tommy... you kept Duffle in a boat for no reason. Passive mobs don't despawn...
I could never mine AND craft for that long. Crafting maybe, but mining.. No way.
btw i love how u used the roblox arcane odyssey sea theme
Tommy have you ever in your life watched JoJo ?
next episode?! a series!? ...nice.
Great Video!
Claim you’re here before 24 hours ticket 🎟️
Just so you know, passive mobs like cows don't despawn
hello Tom 😐
wot
yay tommy is on his peak minecrafter arc
Honestly this style of video was so fun to watch I hope you make more videos like this
Definitely didn’t get the idea from sb3737.
hi tommy
Tommy with animals is my favorite Tommy
Good luck with the warden hope you kill it but be carefull it can 2 shot you in full netherite
Playing the game in vanilla wow that's refreshing to see, a bit satisfied too. Also i know you Tommy have been liking the jojo's beginning theme you put in the video's intro :))
Good job Tommy
Fill free to do more of this by yourself or even include some of your friends :)
Why did watching this comfort me sm after a break up a few hours ago...<3
Tommy's new weakness: This video
INCREDIBLE VIDEO!!!!
SERIOUS VIDEOS LETS GO!!!
Tommy:finds the rarest music disc Also Tommy:NOT AGAIN
THETES GONNA BE A NEXT EPISODE??? FUCK YEAH!
Every TommyInnit video will always be amazing. I don’t have to worry if the concept is bad, I just need to hope Tommy is still hilarious as always.
Love your vids Tommy, never manage to disappoint 👍🏻
Me: Watching a tommyinnit video. Tommy: I have no knowledge of the ancient city. Me: Well that's concerning. Tommy: *Dies to warden* Me: Oof. Well at least he knows to avoid it. Tommy: I'm gonna kill it. Me:👁👄👁
3:02 Fun Fact there was originally gonna be mob fighting music. But they found the music unnecessary, because the fights only take a couple seconds.
Helooo
Tom should start his own 100 days hardcore series
thanks for posting your weekly routine king :)
Tommy is so amazing words just can’t describe it  <3
PLEASE part 2
I don't know why but this video makes me so happy
who is gonna tell him, that only hostile mobs despawn?
When you start to hate trees because you don't like chopping them, so you want to destroy them
this was fun to watch!
:D happy cuz u uploaded this is so happy moment yes yay
Honestly yea comforting memories hits different
Your vids are great I hope you get 15m soon
nostalgia
the gamemode was hard, and so was Tommy
Guess I have to die I live In Idaho
YES! THE CONTENT WE NEED!
'To make Grian Bust' *squirting noises* 💦 😂
Early
loved the vid Tommy the hours of content you make it is truly amazing
ELLOOO KINGGGGG 😧😧😧
You should be invited to hermitcraft now
First time?
Star Wars title
first?
tommy one of the best content creator
Tommy's face when he sees the Warden was priceless! I laughed so bad. I love Wardens, they are so cool.
Some of the best content you pulled so far, love it !
I don’t know why but I actually kinda enjoyed this video :D I normally never watch u at all, and tbh u are kinda annoying like how u say u are at the beginning XP but ur videos never appealed to me, but for whatever reason, I liked this vid, sick.
who has missed this 🤚
He actually trying to be like his dad
"Elsa style" oml I'm giggling
new favourite video RAAHHH
W
When will Dream SMP Season 2 come? Tommy Simons
when i first  saw people shitting themselves in the deep dark i thought they were overreacting for views.... then i tried going into it myself.... i thik u can already guess that i absolutely shit myself.
That house looks like shit.
Damn that dreamSMP flashback with the fetish jokes rly strikes nostalgia
I don’t even like mcyt anymore ,however this brings me to the good old days omg
It fells like it’s been a decade since Tommy last uploaded, (not the YouTube shorts)
This is why tommy is my favorite YouTuber
Tommy is a bit more menace in this video...
and in the starting few seconds he offends Frostopia (a creation of mine) me sad now         this is a joke keep up the good videos
looooveee this, it's great to see you playing Tommy ❤
i think you should play 1.19 in vr and fight the warden
Imagine spending a whole week on ONE fifteen minute video????? Your drive is insane man, keep the grind alive!!
I'm looking forward to seeing you try to defeat the warden. That will be interesting.
3:48 heyyy!!! grian would be proud my man!!
I mean-       this is all I do anyway……
How dare u not like snow
love it just playing the game
0:31 as someone who likes snow, can confirm as dead
when your're too early you don't know what to say
this was SUPER fun :DD
tommy what the actual f are you doing
My man is such a survival player, using stairs to get out of a cave 😂
*Please don't die in Cancer like* *techno 😭*  *Edit: playing games for long time* *straight is bad for health*
I think this series is gonna be big Ngl
also tommy changes backgrounds his last few videos
Tommy thanks for the new video
How can Tommy make unmoded vanilla mc so fun to watch xd
No matter how many days it's gonna take!"  The people who seen the warden and knows its strength:days?  Btw for the people who don't know it's about as powerful as enchanted netherite armor I think and it's stronger than the ender dragon
"A build so good, it would make Grian bu--"
Balls
So… no “most people find me annoying at first” today?
My friends and I used to spend hours just fishing while we talked in this one world. We would end up with hundreds of enchanted books/bows, way to many saddles and so much more. Good times. Also a great way to get name tags quickly!
do this but with mods
Ngl I'm invested now 🤣
Chommy, play skyblock now regularly it was so much better when you played skyblock
Can you play rlcraft
sheeeeeesh best video yet
JUMP IN THE CADILLAC GIRL PUT SOME MILES ON IT ANYTHING U WANT JUST TO PUT A SMILE ON IT U DESERVE IT BABY U DESERVE IT ALL AND I'M GONNA GIVE IT TO U
Part 3000 of my trying to kill the warden I have full max out netherite amor and about to kill the warden 3 mins later dies 😂😂😂
I love how tommy just insults duffle while also building him a roof.
I think he lost a large chunk of his sanity
Man how much I’ve missed this so excited for more honestly DUFFLE POGGGG
That kinda friendship with that cow >>
Duffle is like Henry 😢
We love duffle❤ chain
Tips for Tommy to defeat the warden 1: Projectiles 2: Avoid close combat with the warden 3: have a lot of golden apples 4: have enchanted diamond or netherite armor 5: Never EVER charge at the warden Facts about the warden: Warden has I think 500 or 200 health correct me if I’m wrong It detects you by smell
Always a good day when Tommy uploads
this was awesome, cant wait to see the next one !!!
Finally a gameplay vedio 😂😂
“I hate you and your oxygen!” TommyInnit 2023
this is so unusual for tommy, but god it's the best. he really found himself in this world ❤
Wow Tommy this was like a whole movie man. One of my favorite videos of yours, no joke.
Get some sleeep
Wait, do cows despawn? I have like a couple thousands in my barn, and these suckers still there
Love the callback to slimecicles disaster vids with the Giornos theme in the beginning!
Idk why but for me this is the most interesting video tommyinnit ever made
WOW I LOVE THIS GUY
“Fuck you and your oxygen” 😂😂😂
what was that intense music called 12:48
AAAAAAAGH
Dude this video was actually so refreshing, imo it’s the perfect balance of just playing the game and your unique humor and style. Also cows don’t despawn bc they’re a passive mob LMAO
Dude has such a history with music discs that the mere thought of getting another one is terrifying, I love it
Tommy you need a Bow for the Warden fight Take this from a Bedrock Player
I've been playing on a world since 8th February 2022. I named it "solo" because it was my world to just spend time alone, by myself, when i needed a break from the outside world. It's a huge help and I really encourage everyone else to just have one world where they dedicate their time when relaxing!
I saw the title and thought "this is gonna be a wild ride"
YES part 2 pls
HELLOO
This is nostalgic and meaningful, I’m already loving these series!!
I love this
7:07 I’m pretty lucky to get name tags when I’m fishing with a normal fishing rod. It’s a pain in the butt when you’d want food sometimes but so far just go with a fishing rod. It’s much safer than the nether
Morning tommy! Great video as always! I hope that everyone who reads this has a great day!
I chronically feel like I can genuinely get into mc again without feeling like a lazy sack of garbage:)
duffle was basically the only thing that kept tommy going in the game lol
The music disc you found in the spawner  sounds really good
Love to see this kind of vid from you Tommy
this is awesome I'm loving this new content Tom!!
I just had an idea of Tommy creating an editing service called PogchampVideo. Is that weird to anyone?
I get being tired of the game.
...
LETSGO! This was an awesome video! Can't wait to see you take on the Warden next time!
NEXT EPISODE PLEASE
4:48 is everyone in the comments just going to ignore that now? 😂
@Grian did you bust?
duffle my beloved

It was an adventure...lol..luv ur content
YEAHHH TOMMMYY IS BACKKKKKK

Ok I am actually scared. Never thought I say it.
JUMP IN THE CADALAC

Hooray

Its so refreshing to see a video of yours like this, really liked it, please keep up with the series
Almost died of laughing when Tommy got killed by the warden 🤣🤣Tbh watching the warden while staying on the same location was a pretty dumb idea xD
phantom hourglass music made my day instantly better
funny vid
Just got out of school, glad I’m able to catch the newest video fresh off the presses! Let’s see what this one has in store - Giorno’s theme is a very good sign indeed.
9:52 felt nostalgic and emotional before 'okay so what *is* a fetish' smacked me in the face
GOLDEN WIND LETS GOOOO TOMMY MY MAN
I’ve just been waiting for my internet to work to watch this “<
It's incredible to think this video is fifteen minutes. I felt like I went on an entire adventure.
in what world do friendly mobs despawn....
Duffle is Henry without the lore.
It really changed my mood today when at the star of the video i was told by TommyInnit himself to die...thanks man
3:12 Whopety whopety, This disc is now Dreams property >:)
This video is so cool
Bro could have just fished for the name tag bruh🤣🤣  Nah but Tommy's content is always so funny
THAT WARDEN MUST DIIEEE and do not take away duffles jukebox he needs it
It's cool to see tommy doing this video style I can't wait to see it again 😂😂
Good video
Please make this a long series Tommy, I already love it!!
Can you please make hypixel skyblock videos again?
It's me on Friday 😂
Lol tomi
Tommy you should play doors in Roblox it a  horror game  it is so fun
Heroine is a close second 😂
Your poor girlfriend lol
That intro is fire ngl
press shift to avoid those things to activate in the deep dark and ancient cities
I legit thought tommy was gonna name the cow “dubbo”
How could Tommy tell me to die in the first minute of the video? :(
i don't think hes gonna be abel to kill the warden
E
Tommyinnit is a Madman
He should've found a spruce sapling, 4 of them give so much wood, bout a stack of logs.
Use mods
I love the editing bro
Lol
do an iron farm
If your scared because the brightness is so low remember some people’s computer can only handle low brightness. JuUsT tHiNk AbOuT iT * scaary ghoost sound* OoOoOoOoH
The fact that he kept finding discs! 🤣🤣🤣
Loved this
Passive mobs like Duffle don't despawn. But I think Duffle likes the boat.
first to 28mins and 27 secs
Duuude !! That’s awesome Tom ❤
Well, for the past couple of days I have been addicted to Terraria🔥., (why is that game so fricking awesome)
I was feeling sad earlier but this video brighten up my mood. Thank u Tommy <3
TOMMY AND BUILDING? WOW. They grow so fast.. :(
WAIT IM EARLY? WOAHAW

Man’s high
“If you like snow, DIE” -Tommyinnit 2023
Tommy bored himself to almost death to cure our boredom. Big man
YOOOO
2:53, ive.. seen that before...
Here's the best part about the video I didn't even feel bad.
Tommy if u put a animal in a boat once it doesn't despawn. Even if it is released out of the boat after . (Only applies to non hostile mobs)
I love this so much. silly overload
my adhd could never
I've actually been waiting to see you come in contact w/ the Warden. prepare for frustration
Duffle reminds me so much of henry mann
I actually like this alot more than your regular content
passive mobs dont despawn
Omg I'm so early and there's already so many likes and views also I like how funny Tommy can be I like it when he can play the game without any mods
You think THAT ancient city is scary? Try it in Bedrock
Next episode??? I'm gonna love this series lol
AHH THE HANNAH MERCH!!
that... that was actually a fun watch. I've heard so much stuff online about you tommy being annoying but to be honest i don't get it. This was so much FUN to watch! please keep making more episodes for this and i will definitely tune in!
i love how every time he's faced with something, especially boredom, he just calls for Phil XD
I saw that Tommy struggled with trees So here's a tip that for some reason people don't use: DARK OAK Well it's not that good for building but u can get soooooo much wood
I luv u tommy
giorno theme
I LOVE YOU TOMMY!
GOOD FUCKING LUCK FOR NEXT EPISODE 🫡
am
do a hardcore series with philza and then have another special guest every episode or something
Just finished the video and my word, i can tell this is going to be my new favorite series, great work king
He's change so much but hardly at all
this made me happy
Tommy still doesn’t know peaceful mobs won’t despawn without a name tag 😅😂
I had that book too
I love the references about the discs.❤

Tommy: "Grab your friends! I don't have any..." Also Tommy: **Literally has all the friends**
POOOOGGGGGG

Hello Tommy how are you.

these types of videos are my absolute favorite to watch!! can't wait for the next one :D
This makes me wanna play survival single player more :D
Tommy, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but passive mobs don't despawn, including cows. Good vid tho
Loved the adventure time reference
When tommy doesnt realize that trees absorbs carbon dioxide and not oxygen
I love how Tommy has to control the urge to get obsessed over music discs multiple times 😂
tommys the type of guy to see a cow and ask "is this cow anyones friend" and not wait for an answer
An entire week, GOSH Tommy!This must have been outrageous😂
Leather Duffle Bag
Have no clue what to comment but I want to comment
he lasted pretty long.
I loved the slightly calmer vibe here with just tommy :)
This explains where he's been
love the new vid
Tommyinnit love sex?
6:55 I don't think you actually need to for cows
I was having a terrible day and then you posted this lovely video, thank you Tommy!
Loving this series
"I've done this, now!  NOT AGAIN" Read more...
i havent even finished the video yet but its genuinely so nice to see this type of content from tommy its a bit different from usual and i love it :D haveing a great time watching, feeling Sick and Bad so this is a very nice distraction
Tommy running dadza is such a iconic Thing. Just hearing him yell at Phil is funny
Yoooo
DUFFLE <33333
WOW TOMMY BULIDS ARE BETTER THAN MINE
The amount of effort and time that is put in these videos is literally unbelievable this is amazing Tommy’s a legend✨
This was one of those tommyinnits Vids that are chill and awesome.
Loved this video man good content
i love the cow sm ☹️☹️☹️
HENRYS BROTHER
yoooooooo tommy hitting those high notes😎
Kinda early
i loved it sm :D
now im so interested to see whats gonna happen thanks for the intertanment tommy
Timothy
"Minecrafts a horror game now" yea
finally
This man really told me to die. Lovely
die grass lover then touch snow
3:23 that looks suspicious like chat gpt
IM SO HAPPY I STARTED WATCHING YOU YOU MADE ME MUCH HAPPIER SO THANK YOU FOR THAT😊
Iconic Tommyinit lines. If you like snow hehe.. die
WELP GOOD LUCK WITH THAT! THE BIOTCH HAS LIKE 10K HEALTH.......
“Snow biomes are terrible!” Also tommy: stays in technoblade s house, in a *snow biome*
Im not even gonna lie, i havent been enjoying tommyinnit content as of late but this vid, ITS SO GOOD
hi
loving this tipe of vid
why
I love this format of video in the Tommyinnit style. It feels very unique even though it’s not a revolutionary concept. I’m excited to see if there’ll be any more like this in the future >:)
This is so good i hope u do more of these
I  love your content Big man, please keep it up :]
The flashback to the disc's It's just Og
The warden is literally has more health then  2 Ender dragons combined and the warden can 1 hit but can’t see but hear really well and it can come out of walls , the roof , or the floor but when injured another warden may appear and the other warden that’s injured disappears so you have to be really quick
I think each time Tommy found the disks it was a way to say dream smp season 2 really isn't happening.
Hello!
I am in the 1st hour!
Tommy in Ohio
Tommyinnit will be 20 years old soon. time flies
this series about to be amazing
20m early
7 days?! Tommy man ur crazy 😂😊
lmao
Tommy getting the disc and instantly getting flashbacks was pure comedy.
you can do it tom! get another cow friend for Duffle as well.
Phil: "There's a new boss in mc but its very risky and dangero-" Tommy: "IM ON IT!" Phil"...did...did u hear about the part of very risk-" Tommy: *already on the grind*
I once played for 10 hours straight
You need to make a new video now
Him building his i think first ever cool house was like the top 5 happiest clip ever ngl
Amazing content as always !!
HE NEVER PLAYED CAVES AND CLIFFS UPDATE
When Tommy screams his mic just starts dying
I’d love to see another episode of this! This was super fun and intense
It took hours, Days, MAYBE EVEN A WEEK, and then you just casually find one at the spawn.
7:00 he can’t even moo-ve around it 😂
Hasn't he already been doing this for the past ten years?
love it
So glad you posted a new video! It's amazing, made my day as always <3
was your girlfriend on vacation without you or something, so you had days to pass?
im so excited that we're finally getting a series like this ^^
You need to make a new video now
uhhhh
19 min of bored min till i found ur channel
We stan Duffle
if i could subscribe 1 million times, i would.
Me 30 seconds ago: Hmmmmm I wish there was another Tommy video Me: *sees the video from 19 minutes ago* HAHA YES
I said no to drugs…. Which clearly I am on drugs if I’m talking to them. 😎😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
I tried to build an iron golem farm and it took me 6 hours to build it was worth it tho
I sharted
This was genuinely such a great video, I was engaged the entire time and it gave me so much nostalgia from 2020 and 2021. So glad you're getting back into youtube again, I'm excited for where this channel will go!
TOMMY MAN
20 MINUTES AGO? wow.  One year ago? Holy shit.
You need to make a new video now
Incredible
really love the vibe of this video, hope you do more :D
Tame a dog and name it Ruffle
I learned swearing from you 😅😅😅 and my mom is not happy
Why are you torturing yourself for us, Tommy?
helloo
You need to make a new video
Holy crap, I'm early. HI KING
The first time I went into an ancient city it was scary af
After how many years... Tommy has made an actual let's play...
poor phil 😂
I love how he’s going to find out passive mobs can’t despawn after doing all that boat shit
duffle is a perfect name..... will steal it
Rip the tree he killed🥺
Cows don't despawn you fool
the effort that tommy puts into these videos always amazes me!
HERE AT 19 MINUTES !!
wag wan
6:48 the moment of true happiness
We stan Duffle
3:38 ayo
For this FaKa got me SO HARD 😂😂😂😂
this is why he was not uploading for a week
if you let duffle make a child with another cow he also wouldn't have despawned
Loving the fact that your playing a new world it’s just a wholesome experience
I love this so much Tommy we need more of these ❤
epic
The house you built is AWESOME
this is going to be the new dream smp
never thought I'd be impressed with a single one of tommys building but this video proofs i was wrong maybe cause my expectations were very low haha
Now I need to know if grian did indeed “bust”
Every creeper I saw I was hoping he would scream lol
7:21 he just lost all his Muslim followers
I like how he speaks calmly as Phil… and super loud and chaotic for himself😭😭 very accurate👌
"Into the unknown. Elsa stlye" had me dying 😂😂😂
So much effort FUCKKK
okay but like..... why do i love this new vibe and energy?
No-one tell Tommy Duffle wouldn't have despawned even without a tag
THIS VIDEO HAS SENT ME INTO A DARK RABBIT WHOLE OF LAUGHTER
If you get your name tag back, you should give Duffle a friend <3
i love how tommy’s builds arent even the best but hes so proud of them, its genuinely so wholesome and heartwearming. the pride and effort that went into them makes them a billion times better
I like that he went to the extremes for a name tag when you can just fish for it
New series? pog?
YEAA
TY SO MUCH FOR THE VIDS TOMMY
Here is an idea on how to kill the warden. Build up and use a bow the entire time
I am seeing too much bots with some not so family friendly profile pictures in the comment sections, tommy please do something about it.
this is giving such a big "just how fast the night changes" vibe it's actually- yeah-
YOU NEED TO CONTINUE THIS EPISODE THINGY ITS SUPER FUN
Idk why this was so wholesome but I’m here for it
Done
The best part, is seeing Tommy actually building A nice looking house!!! 3:59
THIS MADED ME CRACK UP SO FUCKING MUCH
fun fact tommy cows, sheep, pig and horses as well as wolfs cats pretty much any friendly mob  dont despawn
The warden has 500 hearts of health, and also has a ranged attack that ignores armour.
LETS GO
Tommyinnit and Duffle, third best duo <3
Good luck killing the warden I tried 50 times also go check on duffle
By the way Tommy, passive mobs don't despawn, its only agressive ones that need a boat
LMAO
Wathching his videos the night rly made my mood better, ily tommy :)
Tommy… you’re short.
epic
DUFFLE!!
Hi
I love how aimlessly and unstrategically he just went In and thought he could raid a warden city, that's crazy, but honestly I have hope for him, I mean it'd be the craziest title! "Tommyinnit beats the Warden"!!! 👀
بیا بیلاخ بوقول👍🏻🗿
Looking forward to more videos like this :]
Nothing against Tommy but I knew he was dead the second he got to the ancient city 😂
Tommy’s chaos level has only increased but the snow biome has and will always suck
tommy has music from jojo on the beggining of the video? how gay is he?
Good luck with the warden tommeh
Hey I’m kinda early!
WE NEED MORE OF THESE.
Thx Tommy, thx for just making content. :)
YES VANILLA PLAYTHROUGH LETS GOOOOOOO
Passive mobs don't despawn ! Love tommy's content tho!
Can't wait for the next episode!
OH MY GOD a new series I love this eeee
the edit is so good
Amazing
stop the end actually scared me even though I knew it.
He is back!!
actually what are the chances an ancient city spawns under the spawn
Tommy looked absolutely traumatized in the deep dark 😭😭
I deal with the warden by running in, looting and running out very fast, also put a bed down nearby
Tommy please do a vlog we're you go to Harry Potter studios London with Tubbo Niki Phil and Wilbur it will be Poggers
WHY DIDN'T YOU RUN
only 1:31 into this. ISWEAR IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THAT COW I WILL KILLL
Duffle is poggers 🙂
This was really nice and chill, I’d love a little let’s play style series!
0:32 is that a stryfe in the background?
You can easily kill the warden with entity cramming - or defeat it in a fair fight using cobwebs! 🕸️
First we have Tommy and Shroud and now we have Tommy and Duffle :0000 By the way....THAT HOUSE AND DUFFLES BARN LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL....It made me shed a tear! Thank you for your wonderful uploads Tommy! They always make my day better💜💛🐝🐝
I believe you can do it tom
LETS GOO TOMMY!!
You should get another cow, Duffle and Buffle
every time i saw a music disc i thought of jump in the cadillac lol
i am the 4th watcher lets go
another series to look forward to WOOOO!
I knew the warden would kill him😭
12 seconds in and we hear the classic *AAAA*. It's gonna be a good one,
I am staying for this let's play. Exciting shit.
Tommy im worried for you.        But grind with the trees
Tommy has the best ideas for vidoes
tommy putting little smiley faces into his captions means so much to me :)
I love this video :D
This was 14 mins ago, it’s still got over 7.1K likes. Tommy is stress, Tommy is death he is no love, he is no life. But he is a god, In our hearts atleast.
Bro your videos are so high quality the music is also so immersive!
Tommy never fails to entertain and crack me up. Tommy keep it up dawg.
The fear in Tommy's eyes when saw the Cat disc and the othersids disc 💀
People like me who have watched philza go agents the warden in that snapshot we know how dangerous it is😅
Tommy having troubles with seeing without brightness: Me playing without brightness all this time: (Please I can see EVERYTHING)
Great video!!
HES BACK ON İT YESSS
Tommy has unlocked the ability to copy Charlie Slimecicle’s editing style
Finally tommyy
I know people who do that without any reason.
ok big man
Te extrañaba tommy WAAA:')
yyooooo hi 15minute mark
4:55 Specifically “Comforting Memories is the “Feels nostalgic although it’s a new song” song
tommyinnit’s videos are the best❤😂
i haven’t started this but i already know it’ll be crazy
Man spent days trying to make his cow not despawn when passive mobs such as animals doesnt need a nametag or a boat for it XD
Hillarios as always
POV Em for the 7 days : 🧍‍♀️
love the staring into nothing face cam haha
Hehehe I'm early for the first time ever
Wow, I can't believe he spent 7 whole days playing minceraft just for his viewers
I dont know if its only a bedrock feature or not but you can get nametags from fishing, would've took less time
Hollo
W duffle
Yayyyy new upload! WOOOOO🎉
Damn Tom.
Next Thing you know my guy will be playing for a whole month
These videos are insane, keep up the good work
love ur videos bro
Keep up the work Tommy😀
And here begins a new journey that will last years...
love how he just casually got cat (disc) from that creeper.
Tommy has some of the best videos I’ve ever seen   3:12 oh no not this again
Make a full vid
Dream :-  "𝙊𝙝𝙤𝙝𝙤𝙝𝙤𝙤𝙝𝙤𝙝𝙤" you are challenging me??
oh god, and i’m an atheist
cool
Jojo???
I just gotta give Tommy some credit for not getting a heart attack every time anything happens in the deep dark.  or maybe im just getting too scared, playing on peaceful mode.
not this guy again
Yooo jojo music.Its from italian giro giovani seasone
Why do you hate trees (and me) so much :(
oh god
No sleep here 🤣
First 50k :D
One like equals one hay bale for Duffle
GUYS IT HAPPENING AGAIN WHAT DO WE DO?!
the absolute madlad
Hi
hello tommyinnit
✨Elsa style✨
1:56 did u mean 'Kerfuś'?
Am I the only one who got super nostalgic when he started playing the disc
Half of the comments are bots 💀💀
Nice congrats
you should play hardcore mode
Tommy puts brightness down and being terrified but is bedrock players are used to it
9:53 you made me cry Bro😭
Is incredible how Tommy Is disposed to spend a whole week of his life just to entertain us
Tommy have you heard of packgod you should talk to him
The level of dedication this man has... o7
Pog
It’s feels so nostalgic idk whyTT
YAY A NEW VIDEO!!!
Hi tommy
I loved when he picked up the disc and said NO!!!!🤣🤣🤣
I could watch a whole series of just this to be honest.
I think philza would be proud of you
this is the literal plot to tommys dsmp character, gets emotionally attached to cows and discs
We love duffle
its a great day when tommy uploads
TOMMYINNIT whyyy
POG
You are the best YouTuber to have ever exosted
Never clicked on a video so fast before
SPAM F IN THE REPLIES IF U LOVE TOMMY
0:30 technoblade meanwhile. o7
Cool
I had to go to school but I ended up being late just to watch this😂
yo im early no way!11!!1!
cows and other neutral mobs don't despawn L
Wow
Fishing would’ve been a more efficient way to get a name tag.
Can i get a hi from tommy
Seeing Tommy with any disk at this point brings back great memories
HIII TOMMY
Techno loved snow,so you die innit
Not Tommy putting a passive mob in a boat so it doesn't despawn HAHAHA
this is why tommy's not on hermitcraft.
Love this video :D
Tommy is the best teen in the universe
tommy will never fail to make me laugh!! <3
Now do it in vr🤣
Why?
Tommy here saving kids from drugs. He truly has matured
Tommy knows how to come up with a good video that is funny and chaotic at the same time
Love this vid <3 ✨
JUMP IN THE CADILLAC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CAN I GET A PIN?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BLOW THIS UP SO HE CAN SEE THIS!   👇
"If you like snow... die" - Tommyinnit 2023

This video is so good. I love this and I really hope it becomes a series!!!
**wave**
How is youtube funny man TommyInnit so good at building, I thought I was adequate enough but damn I just got put in my place
It's nice to see Tommy just playing the game :). No Mods. No Challenge. Not doing Lore like in the Dream SMP. Just playing and enjoying the game how it was meant to be played :)
This is somehow one of his more calming videos That says something especially with the amount of screaming within the first 20 seconds
I’m early 🙃🙃
Why no optifine window mod?!
Who knew 3 years ago that his content is still amazing?
*Enter LukeTheNotable*
idk if I’m high or being truthful. But this video feels like a old jschlatt OpenTTD video with his commentary/storytelling. idk I kinda like this videos vibe.
Positive mob never despawn
who is going to tell tommy, that farm animals can't despawn...?
Nerd.
we all did what tommy did when we were 12, ah the good old days.
Yeaaas
Amazing video as always! <3
Why is bro doing the John Cena emote throughout the video 💀
Tommy is like a boomer trying to understand chatgpt
Am I the only one who just realized Tommy never built an actual house on the DSMP?
i need to know 2 things 1.are you going to do more mods with the gang? i kinda miss those videos 2. is the dreams server finished?
for the name tag it would’ve been easier to find a mineshaft
Who new Tommy was such a great builder
"It's awsome, it's magnificent!" It's fucking birch....
I Miss The Video Everyday Instead Of The High As Hell Quality Videos Reminds Me Of SB737😂    Let Me Know If You Do To!❤❤
3:13 only OG's will know
F*** THESE TREES WE HATE OXYGEN! -*tommyinit 2023*
You know it's a good day when Tommy posts!!!!
0:30 But It’s So Tasty……
"if you like snow hah! die."
I hope tommy does more of these videos, I really enjoy them
awesome video bro!!!
Xool
Small boi in a new big world would have been a better title
tommyinnits video titles are my life goals =]
I love you Tommy, you always make my day <33333
Tommy has aged fast man... First time I saw him I thought I wouldn't be into the whole dumbly funny content.. and the more I watched the more a coped... My humor has for some reason been more weirdly funny and made me better.. thank you..                          also fuck you.
Tommy: Finds multiple discs Me: *flashbacks*
Cows dont despawn you trapped him in a boat for no reason
"What the hell are these new addons?" *Show the Deep Dark*  Bruh. Tommy. My Man.
Tommy!!!!
I like snow because it’s pretty and it’s an easy source of slowness arrows  I don’t wanna die
Hello there Thomas Simons! You are rather poggers! Reply to this comment or I will do unspeakable actions to your girlfriend.

There is no way anyone finished this video yet  *finds disc* "ITS NOT HAPPENING AGAIN" -Tommy
Baller

Tommy is the type of person to see a tree and think, "is anyone going to insult that?" And not wait for an answer
top 5

Tommy’s the type to ask “is anybody gonna get addicted to that?” And not wait for an answer.
what my mom thinks i do instead of my homework:
😢
He spent 7 days of his life in solitary confinement 😅
Eat bread, bread is good 👍
