Love how this shows a second replay of the first England try which was very standard but don’t show a second replay of one of the all time great rugby tries by Duhan🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Great game of Rugby.
Grand Slam still on for Scotland. Technically: After all, they beat France. (Couldn't give a fuck what the official results say). However, Ireland, at home will just be too good I think
Fantastic game
First try for england is a knock on everyday 😂🤦🤦
That was double movement
I could watch that forever. And probably will.
Could watch that van der merwe try all day long

Just love that poor effort from Dombrandt for that DVDM try.
As a french, I can only say Long live the AULD ALLIANCE
I think we should let the Southron win it next year. Just for the novelty value.
So England B beat England A.
I feel sorry that England lost the Calcutta Cup to Scotland.
Excellent result so proud of my country
Наконец-то шотландцы дали бой! Я из России, но болею за команду Шотландии по рэгби.  Парни, не останавливайтесь!
Шотландцы -бойцы!  Настоящие мужики!
After years of promising glimses, I am absolutely loving Scotland's ability to put in a performance for a full 80 mins. Cracking opener.
yes that was a forward pass
Go Scotland!!! 💪

I just learnt Marcus smith is Pinot 😊 I was already a fan but you got my respect for that king
Excellent game, especially for the neutrals. Scotland have lots to be proud of and I wish them the best in the tournament, and England have less to work on than people will give them credit for but all the weaknesses were highlighted here. However, the most notable weakness for me, is the fear of upsetting Owen Farrell...if your unsure of how deep that goes, take the example of the majority of commentators and writers blaming the start of the Van der Merwe try on a missed tackle by Marchant. Despite there being no defensive system that asks the outside man to tackle an inside runner. Truth is that Farrell was poor at 12 but no one has the balls to tell him, in the same vein as the story from the Emperor's New Clothes. Either play him at 10 (and don't get the job done) or bench him (as he's not a 12), but he can't go on being untouchable if we want to win things.
Come on Scotland from Italy 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
That’s what you get for firing one of the best coaches in history
Alba!!!
England, stick to soccer!
Humped ☺️
I could imagine Bill McLaren's commentary on the Van De Merwe's try....🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
England shit team, Scotland a Saffa team!
For all that the first VDM try is a piece of brilliance, his second is nothing short of perfection - a real team effort. Can we play like this every match this year please?
these guys are both better than the all blacks.
Great play Scotland
Alright Scotland. 🙂
This game was absolutely brilliant, both teams played superb and seemed fairly evenly matched though England might have looked slightly stronger a lot of the time. The result was well deserved but didn't show how close it had been. I thoroughly enjoyed this match and would have regardless of the outcome.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧
Magnificent Springbok try
I do love the '' van der Merwe'' bit🤣🤣🤣
Duhan van der Merwe?. A proper Scottish name.    :)
South Africa's B team played very well didn't they.
Steve Borthwick needs the sack, what a disgrace to lose to Scotland in your first six nations
Russel -> Brown -> Grey -> Duhan 10 -> Prop -> Second Row -> 8 -> Wing
More importantly. Scottish rugby is fun too look at again. Even if they would have lost it would have been entertaining to watch.
As a casual follower of rugby and a neutral supporter I must say that I enjoyed this game. Well done to both teams.
As a Wallaby fan, I loved this!
Defense coach …Sinfield?…..my granny in Welles could have run through those gaps
G'wan the Scots. Great game.  Delighted for ye. From an Irish fan.
Scotland's try was like the rugby equivalent of maradonas famous goal against England
What a try
Proud of the Scots !!!
Show the England tries twice but only the Scottish tries once, you English basturts. Get it right up you
Not far of the 38 each draw in 2019.
Should never of sacked eddie jones
Oops nearly forgot to watch this a second time today :-I
Absolument incroyable. Victoire écossaise mérité dans des conditions hostiles. Van Der Merwe juste extraordinaire.
Wow Scotland never would of picked you as a winner
What utterly shite English utterly shite tackling by England shocking
Amazing, DVM both tries absolutely brilliant.
Not sure if that was just terrible defending or amazing attacking, but Scotland got some fantastic tries there, slipping straight through the lines.
https://youtu.be/FMtsXQ6PxN4
South Africans laughing at England
Good game, well done the Scotland.
Great start by the Scots. Always enjoy seeing them get one over England.
Looks like SA wingers just know how to cut England in half !!! What a game of rugby congratulations Scotland🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Since Scotland now seem to be routinely beating England, does that mean you all hate us a bit less now? 😋
What a try by the Socttish number 11, sensational stuff!
As a English man of 65 , i have watched over the years loads of England Scotland games ,which are always great. But i must say Scotland were fantastic . England were good to, but Scotland just had this thing about them ,that they were not going to lose this game, well done both teams for a great game, but well done Scotland ,that win was deserved.
The scottish second try was incredible . What a burst of speed and great footwork ! Well done Scotland !
Well done Scotland/Springboks
shiu
Glorious
Excellent and deserved win for Scotland from an Englishman! A new beginning for England they had a decent game the influence of Borthwick and Sinfield beginning to show but a long way to go.
As a Frenchy always love to see my great English friends in trouble hehehe great game Scotland!!!!
Such an weird sport
Imagine if they played that match in the town of Chillingbourne. ⚽⚽⚽⚽
We will be watching that vdm try in 30yrs still in awe
Mike Drop Moment ! 1:12 One of the best Tries scored in the Holy stadium of Rugby.
Always  A Pleasure  Seeing  England  Lose In Every Sport..
My grandad would have been so proud if he saw that 😢
Unbelievable Scotland. Huge congrads,  from Cork 🇮🇪
Fuck me that is the best try I have seen in a long time, respect from nz
Tuipulotu's grubber kicks are incredible. For both Glasgow and Scotland.
BBC News: "This content is not available in your location." (Two days ago.) Thank you BBC...and a massive thanks to youtube!
Wheels have fell of those charriots again. After the positive Italian showing today Englund have to be favourites for the wooden spoon 🥄
I played rugby for 30 years so ide say I know abit England have serious problems they have a penalty on Scotlands try line and decide to keep the ball in hand,what did England do take the ball to ground and hope they can Forse the ball over the try line and it went totally wrong,if they took the tap penalty and stade on the feet kept the ball moving into a rolling maul at speed moving away from the touch line ide say they could of scored a try,my rugby team was great at it scored 99% of the times the teams that win the world Cup like England in 2003 are big powerful and crushed other teams to death,south Africa done it to England in a world Cup final so why do they play pretty boy rugby 🏉 it dosnt work pick a team of size and power that will over power and crush the opposition into the ground,iam sorry to say England have serious problems I can see Italy shocking England when they play each other
Well done Scotland excellent 👏 👍
The tackling from England for that 2nd try 🤣🤣🤣 absolute embarrassing. Will stick to rugby league a game with top athletes who know how to tackle
When Townsend first took over, I gave his earlu success due to Verns teachings. But slowing he is coming up to been seen as a coach of stanging.
Bravo aux écossais, vous pouvez maintenant obtenir votre indépendance 😉.
Legitimately such a great game of rugby. I’ve never seen better defense by scotland. No cheap trys, didn’t become rugby tennis between stuart hogg and owen farell, not a huge amount of mistakes, great defense, really well balanced and neither side got stomped.
Mad how a South African scores in a game between England and Scotland. Unlike club sports, in international sports it's our lot against yours, not cheating by inviting a friend to help you. Same goes for England too, especially in cricket. 🙄
love it 3 victorys in a row way the Auld enemy.
That run from the Scotland number 15 was flippin amazing. Amazing rugby yesterday. A masterclass from both teams apart from Farrels kicking. Its okay. He'll work it out.
Nothing better than beating the sheep minded English. Now all we need is for independence and my fellow rangers fools to stop singing god save the parasite.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💪
Poorest England have ever been.
That was indeed a mike drop moment 😂.
Great game, highlights show what a fight it was. Been great games all round, should be a great six nations. Feeling positive for the World Cup, even in defeat.
Excellent game and a great win for Scotland
Pathetic defending from England
def a forward pass from Genge to Curry.
Another talented player lost for South Africa. Great for Scotland. Great result-#.
Scotland you were fucking amazing! Well done lads! Mic drop moment indeed 😃🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿😃❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿😃
Great match and the right team won. Go Scotland!1111111
Scotland can beat diddy teams like England but can they do the same against Wales or Ireland?
Would of best video
We'll done Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Duhan van der merwe... what a classic winger...love this kind of Scottish rugby
Fantastic game. 2 rivals going head to head and putting on a show that will be remembered for years to come. Both squads should be praised for that game.   England will tighten up that defence in midfield and will no doubt do very well this year.
England are no pack of jelly babies. Scotland just played a brilliant game. Excellent ...... Flower of SCOTLAND!
Three lions ??  Three pussycats more like.
As a neutral this was an amazing game to watch. What a game.
Such a pleasure to watch the Scottish team play like this! Well done and much respect to England as well from France 🇫🇷🤝🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
DvdM. Try if the year is yours bud. 7 defenders beaten. 58 metres. Mooilik!
A South African hurting England yet again 😂😂
Great game. Cheers from the 🇵🇭
try of his live! amazing
England beat Scotland but lost to Scotland/ South Africa combined XV
As far as great tries go, that try from Van Der Merwe is up there with the best!  Well done Scotland…from South Africa! 🇿🇦
Wow. Some awesome tries. Scotland's winger ... sheesh! Too good! The skill level across the board of international teams at the moment is higher and more competitive than it ever has been. The World Cup is going to be incredible.
Love to see it. Chew on that one England fans🤣🤣🤣
England forever in our shadow!
Longshanks will be turning in his grave, come on the Scot’s.

DEAR ENGLAND WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP KICKING THE FN BALL AWAY !!! IT MUST DRIVE THE FORWARDS NUTS THEY SLOG THERE GUTS OUT TO WIN BALL AND IT DONT MATTER WHO IS NO 9 BANG AWAY IT GOES SO THE OTHER TEAM STRAIGHT ON ATTACK ???????
Great try from Van der Merwe but...  the tackling attempt by English number 8 was embarrassing what is his name? Dormant?
Bravo les écossais 🤩👍
Well done to both teams for playing some great rugby. It was a close and nerve-racking result.  *phew*. But we did it! Hopefully Scotland can keep and build on the momentum for the other games. However there always seems to be a bit of complacency that creeps into the Scotland psyche after we win against England. Sometimes it feels like that is the only game that matters for us.  Instead, England will use the loss to fire themselves up and really go for the rest of the competition - not that they didn’t go for it in this game.  Edit: minor rewrite for clarity
No doubt the press will blame Eddie Jones
Go 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 forever.
Absolute class from Scotland. We have made England look normal for the last five years.
why aren't the southern hemisphere teams playing this weekend also?
Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 have really really improved in the last 2 years 👍
These highlights missed out a whole unconverted try lmao (England's 3rd try)
Twickenham’s prawn sandwich brigade fans with their flat caps and wax jackets are some of the cringiest, worst sports fans I’ve come across.   Scotland more physical and aggressive entire game, always going over the game line. Everytime they attacked pretty much scored a try.
And people say that Colonialism didn't have any positives. 😅 Just look at the Scotland rugby team 🤣🤣🤣
The Scotsman DUHAN VAN DER MERWE for the win. Nice.
I'm a Scot but all credit to England for a great game! 🏉🏉 Proud to be British!❤💙🧡
And South Africa beat England again😂 Well done Duhan Van De Merwe, Well done Scotland.
Don't usually watch Union but this had me fixated. Great game with some great tries. Well done Scotland from an Englishman.
With everything going on right now, the best decision to be on any creative man's heart is having a profitable investment strategy.
Freeedooom ! :))
What a game, amazing win! Congrats to Scotland from France!
This is Scotland's 4th win against England in a row, and their 3rd straight victory at Twickenham. At this rate, we may declare Twickenham stadium a fortress for the Scots by the end of this decade.
BLUE & WHITE POWER!
COMMENTATOR THINKS HE'S COOL SAYING 'WORLDY', NO.
TYPICAL, THEY SHOW AN ENGLAND TRY TWICE, THE BEST TRY EVER GETS SHOWN ONCE. IDIOTS.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Felicitaciones desde Argentina
It's going to be great to see England become mediocre again
Same old story everybody wants to beat England, then when they play Italy they will lose.
i support two teams the all blacks and anyone who beats engaaaland
Of course the pond will still blame it on Eddie jones …. nothing is ever their fault : Brexit, Zimbabwe, slavery, disgusting cuisine…
awesome game guys! from a englishman i can honestly say you deserved it! after all the centuries of oppression, you guys deserved it  scotland > england
Mon the Rangers...down the celtic!
Interesting highlights where each of the English tries are replayed yet not a single Scottish try is…
Why didn't we see the 3rd English try??? Whzt kind of highlights is this
Brilliant Commentary compared to poxy Rte
This World Cup I think it’s Wales and England’s turn to lower their expectations. Ireland and France are looking like the Teams to beat from the Northern hemisphere
Saffas doing well for Scotland.
Insane try from Duhanne
So you literally just got to live in a country for 3 years before you can play for that country?  That sounds like a rule for all the shit players who can’t get a game for their actual national team to go and play international rugby for someone else.   Saying that though that was a ridiculous try and he should be in the South African team for that alone. Sublime try!!!
Another  Scottish 'miracle'  at Twickenham  which surpasses  even the 'Parting of the Red Sea' and  other biblical tales.
Forward passes , offside , lucky breaks and England had a flu bug in camp.  Yet Scotland only just snuck it
Nice to see South Africa 🇿🇦 beating England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 again 😂😂😂
1:15 a clear blocking by headgear for the break to happen. from a aussie fan lol
Where is Eddie?
Well done Scotland 👍 from Wales fan 👏
Beautiful 💙
Always happy to see England lose. Springbok fan.
England 13 Scotland 12 at half time, video restarted and it's England 20 Scotland 12. Thanks for missing a large chunk. Evidently England forgot how to tackle for those tries and the man of the match sounded too Scottish
England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 *Tries:* M. Malins (2), E. Genge *Conversions:* O. Farrell  *Penalties:* O. Farrell (2)  Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 *Tries:* H. Jones, D. van der Merwe (2) B. White *Conversions:* F. Russell (3) *Penalties:* F. Russell

Well his South Africa 😅❤ Van Der Merwe
We love the 6 nations. Packed stadiums, top drawer rugby, electric atmosphere. What mire do you want?!!! No grand slam but Ireland to win!
Always love me a Scot victory, especially against England
Brilliantly done Scotland England couldn't beat you best team won absolutely brilliant.
C'Mon England ❤️
grande Scozia!
My father told me this was a shocker i told him it wasn't.
Scotland own England
It's worrying that england can't produce many world class players and are struggling to compete with the British isles teams. Compared to the 2003 side this looks like a b team. A structural or grass roots problem that will never be urgently addressed by the rugby authorities.
Scotland play some really nice running stuff these days.
All I kept thinking was don't kick the ball to a team that can run through us! Oh you've just kicked it to a team that has just ran through us with ease!
Sweet English tears inflicted by another South African.
Good to see Nigel choke on his prawn sandwich.
They missed Genge's try early in the second half.
Well deserved win for my 2nd team against my 1st.  Scotland are a great team currently and if they were more consistent they could really challenge the boks and NZ.  England looked a little better but that partnership of OF and MS doesn't work. If they won't get rid of OF then they need to have MS start as a sub and vice versa. Putting two proper centres outside of either of them will make a big difference. Ben Youngs was great but again it felt slower when he came on, he needs to be removed. It's one thing to bring experience but if most of your recent exp has been losing then you might as well bring fresh legs on and let 2 new scrum halves gain some of their own. Outside of those three players I thought the rest of the team looked ok.
Awesome….Top class rugby
Only English want England to win. Everyone was rooting for Scotland
McSouth Africans doing it for Scotland. Well played Scotland. 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Fantastic game ! CONGRATS Scotland.
It’s incredible to see how the skill, fitness, quality of rugby has developed over the last 20 years. Incredible.  Scotland used to threaten on occasion but now they have at *least* 3 world class players and a very good squad. Great coach as well. Although the country is going to hell in a hand cart under Nippie - the rugby team is phenomenal. This comes from a fella with two Ayrshire parents. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Well done Scotland.
Well done to my Scottish Brothers💙💙💙🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿From Ireland 🇮🇪💚💚
Lol, no replay of any Scottish tries - sore losers!
Well done Scotland from South Africa 🇿🇦
That’s what happens when you sack the England coach prematurely lol
Totally deserved.
As an England supporter I thougt this was a great game and shows that we can at times play some good attacking rugby
I think England might just find that firing one of the best coaches in world rugby was not the "fix" to their losing streak they were hoping for. Well done Scotland!
Van Der Merwe made in South Africa
Van der merwe for Scotland, Van der flier for Ireland, Willemse fir France, imagine if these SA players were playing for their country…they d be difficult to beat..
Bring back Eddie Jones
What a try by the South African 💪
You missed a try?
Amazing!!!

Bravo les écossais!!
Same old England...
England soft!
Who did the play by play?
Where was England’s 3rd try? Bad editing 😠
Well done Scotland from Scotland.
What a game. Scotland played some brilliant rugby and England played their part in an amazing test match.
Eddie jones must be laughing
get it up ye's
Well done Scotland from ur irish cuz
What a win Scotland from nz chahoooo 👍💯💯
Mooi Duhan
Poorly edited highlights package
🇼🇸🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💪🏽
Itoje has always been and will always be a soft ballsless marshmallow,
South African breaking England hearts again 😂😂
In case people wonder why South Africans never ever get off Farrell's back:  the man is a wimp.  If you've played rugby you know that shoulder-charging is what wimps do, whereas wrapping your arms in a tackle and absorbing the hit and making your arms vulnerable to the opposition's knees takes actual dedication.   Every time Farrell fails to use his arms the man lets his country down!
Highlights but misses half of the points scoring moments? Do better.
Forward passes are allowed now then?
Well played South Africa B ! 4 players in the run on team…
Yessssss😂😂😂 🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Feels familiar to see a South African step an English player to score.
It would be great if the highlights had *all* the tries!
Well done scotland. From brazil
Where is England's third try? Fantastic result for the Scots but I'd like to see all of the tries in the match replay, yeah?
Any game where that poes Farrell loses I'm a happy camper.
And SA set the place on fire!!!
South african beef on display..🤣🤣..how did we lose him to the springboks?????
incredible match, i fell ill the night before and watching Scotland play the way they did made me feel like myself again.
I said it late last year, Scotland are my dark horse for the world cup.   They have quality across the park
stunning Scotland, , well done
They only replyed England's tries and Scottish tries any reason for that?I am do glad Scotland beat England well done Scotland.The English has been removed from there throne.
Clearly Eddie's fault 😂
Sxlcotland have 2 world class wingers . They can cause havoc for any team at the World Cup , coz Duhan and Darcy Graham are just on a different level when it comes to finishing off tries , half chances or creating something out of nowhere
I'm a big fan of the southern hemisphere rugby, but I'll have to admit right now the Six Nation is the best rugby competition in the world.
French supporter here : glad to see England back in some shape. Those 4 last years under EJ they have been a drag. For a team in the process of rebuilding, they did great and they were fun to watch. Congrats Scotland, it was quite a win ! The tournament is off to a good start, it seems, can't wait to see France and Ireland clashing !
Great win for the Scottish boks.  They have alot of foreign players in their team who have made them much stronger now.
41 minutes that pass was forward for sure
Is Gareth Southgate managing the Rugby as well these days?
South African supporter, 🤔what happened to England!!! They always attacked hard and moved the ball, in the first first 10min you could expect a try from them.looks like Ireland adopted England's attacking style, the difference is Ireland is relentless!! They don't lose they attitude when things don't go they way
That try by Duhan...!!! Absolutely magnificent pearler 👌  All Black supporter!
Well done !!’
No surprise here, Glasgow and Edinburgh are playing good rugby and are dark horses for the URC win.
Rugby World Cup is going to be a BANGER!!
what a game!
Great job Scotland
The English really struggle with South African wings
England fan but credit to Scotland. Not about England failings, just a good quality Scotland team that deserved it. Glad to see the Calcutta Cup back as a proper rugby contest
Superbe game man.. England played well.. kimda tried to spook us with the kicks..but fight on we did... amazing
Rugby was the winner.
How embarrassing losing to Scotland!
England and Scotland are two parts of the  same country .
3:42 Forward Pass… ?   Rugby is a shambles right now in more ways than one. Can’t understand how this wasn’t seen. You can clearly work out it’s gone forward via a YouTube…  ;:/
I just love seeing England come up short....Great rugby 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
best part was the stunned silence from the POS England fans.
England's third try?
C'est bon ça
About time little engerlanders had their asses handed to them
Hahahaha england can't tackle low at all apparently
England, again, get battered everywhere they go. Let's have your tears.

UNBELIEVABLE

Congratulations Scotland. Looking forward to you holding the Rugby WC trophy.   Regards, Australia
People really thought Eddie Jones was the problem
Was really glad that gobshite Curry was caught out for scotlands third try.
Just forgot the England try after half time but ok
Great win and an outstanding try from Van der Merwe.
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
That VDM try reminds me of Lomu running through England all those years ago.
Well done Scotland, what a game
Makes me feel better about the Australian loss to Scotland. Looks like it was a very tense and tight fought game.  Thanks for giving us Eddie back. I was keen to see how England would go under him preparing for the world cup but happy he's going to be leading the Wallabies.
Well done Scotts🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Damn ohh England 😅
Congratulations, Scotland, from an Irish fan. It was a fantastic match. Credit to England as well 👏👏👏
No Eddie Jones no chance
Worst highlights package fucking ever 😤
1:14 possibly one of the greatest individual tries I've ever seen in international Rugby. Or the worst defence I've ever seen in international Rugby...
So no replays for the Scotland tries???
Duhan is pure class and he’s in great nick at the moment .
Congrats Scots! What passion! From South Africa
Well done from us Welsh 👏
foreign 0:15 Smith of harlequins the man born in 0:18 Manila in the Philippines  Why mention this..????????????    who is the commentator?  Why not tell us where everyone was born?  Duhan van der Merwe for example?  Great game. Brilliant trys and well done Scotland.
Well done springboks,errrr I mean Scotland. But how dangerous was that front row 🔥 pretty much the bomb squad lol.
Good 🙏
If you’re not a born again Christian then chances are that you’ll be unable to place your right palm on the KJV and say these words once only-> I refuse to be deceived by the devil.  Rev.12:9 The devil deceives the whole world.  Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  If you’re left behind after the rapture then get born again & DONT TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST!
1:12 try of the year contender for sure!
Gutsy win.
"sCoTlAnD gEt bAtTeReD eVeRyWhErE tHeY gO"
Terrible highlights! Why didn't they show all points scored. Just lazy
They must of watched braveheart before this match
get it UP YE!!!!!!
Can Japan win ?
The year just started and we have the Try of the year from DVM!
Duhan
Falta un try
That try is Scottish rugby’s equivalent of Archie Gemmill in 1978!, it’ll be played again and again for decades and decades!
And the wild card takes it from England
Brilliant game Scotland from an Irishman 💪🏉🇮🇪
The editing of this video is absolutely horrific
Very well played Scotland!!!!  Always so good to win over England!  Well done!!!
Eish
My money is on a Scotland vs Italy final.
Eddie Jones having a laugh
"And sent him homeward tae think again"
Seems to have been a great game and a massive congrats to Scotland from an Irish fan
Well done Scotland the Brave from New Zealand. And...haha...to England. Let go of Eddie Jones...that was silly.
Well done from South Africa, you played a fantastic game.
Get in! What a game. Well played both teams.
Always loved van de Murve, legend

Well done Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Is Duhan related to the DTH van der Merwe who used to play for Canada?
Well done Scotland for three wins on the trot against the old neighbor from the south.
Duhan's first try was pure pornography....
An Ireland win and an England loss... today is a good day
Van der merwe with an insane game
YEP changing the coach certainly changed the outcomes for England ROLMFAO
Ni pensar que a esas dos potencias nosotros le ganamos. Vamos Pumas!!!
Good job stuff the poms, go back to pongo land lol
As I said before, this Scotland side is GOOD. I hope this is a catalyst to some consistent form. The quality in their team is clear. I’m a little worried as an England fan that the Premiership is just too far off international standard now with the salary cap decrease… it’s hard to tell, I guess we’ll see over the next year
Two away wins plus a bonus point each for Ireland & Scotland. What a start to the 6N.
Time to upgrade video quality to 1080p60 folks. Thanks
Don’t care about rugby but love to see England lose no matter what sport 😂 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

Sure tuilagi wasn't in form?
Good freakin job! Go Scotland from Australia! Shame I’m England
Thought Eddie Jones was England's problem...
Commentator sounds like he's been listening to too many Aussie super rugby highlights...
It's great to see Scotland competitive again but a bit too competitive for my liking lately! I got the feeling today the England team thought the new tackle ban above the hips applied to them.
How about replays of the tries next time?
I'll say it, the calcutta cup (Scotland pre game, the holders of) sitting on a Rose plinth. Absolute insult.
What entertainment! Excellent tries!
Had the feeling Scotland would win from early in second half. England just couldn’t put them away. Great game to watch, props to Scotland.
On the Scots! More evidence of Scotland's cultural and ethnic superiority. 😁
Sounds like the Irish commentator loved those Scotland tries?
What the fuck is wrong with England, missing every single tackle effortless whack play
Farrell keeps on taking cheap shots and the refs do zero about it, he is a disgrace to the game of rugby Borthwick should not select him his poor game management, offside, and potential RED Cards are a liability he is just a THUG!!!!
Topsided Yet gain ! 🔥🏆🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💙💪🏻
England losing at home? You love to see it.
Eddie Jones is having a good laugh to himself
That was the try of the decade :D 1:11
The news hardly mentioned the result at all. Now I know why. Most of the time you get 24-7 coverage of England's win with bonus in the shower footage, but it can get a bit too much for those fans watching with weak wrists
Whoops the wheel on my chariot. 🙂👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
What muppet designed the England jersey?!? Horrid!
Duhan!!!
The editing on these highlights is atrocious as always lol
Managed to miss an entire try in the highlights
We've reached high points like in 2003 when we won the Six Nations grandslam by thrashing the Irish in their own backyard in the grandslam decider, beat New Zealand, South Africa and Australia all away and then won the World Cup grandslam in Australia and now we've reached a low point in today's defeat.
What a try say no more 👏
Missing the 3rd try from England
Get it right up ye!
Scotland  very very good team at the moment  England are very very very bad at the moment
England 8 was last chance to stop DVdM, and he was brushed off like he was a schoolboy .... DVdM is starting to look mean
I. AM. SCOTLAND!!!    Lekker!
GET IT UP YE!!!!!!!
Didn't watch the full game but if you qsk me any team at home under a new coach should be on fire, especially since he has been called Englands saviour by the media. Maybe I'm biased but looks like England should have waited for the WC to end before just sacking Jones.
England have lost again,so it wasn't Eddy Jones fault but the players struggling for a win.
Well done, Scotland!
England’s midfield defence awful!
The winners were more a team of the real nationality I am glad they won.
As we say in Scotland...........get it up yee.
Kiwi here. Wow Scotland, what a great win! Congratulations
looking at the replay two tries look very forwatd passes. one for each so i guess no damage done
Go Scotland!!!
Names on the back look weird
This was a win for South Africa as much as it was for Scotland with one fifth of the Scottish squad being made up of South African players. While this is wonderful for Scotland it is tragic for South Africa's white rugby players who are forced to leave their friends, family and country behind due to a racist quota system imposed upon white players by black politicians. Apartheid never left South Africa. It just changed sides.
No replay of VDM 1st try ffs!!!
where is the 3rd england try?
Takes only one South African to beat England
thats a good signing from a bokka, van man
Great result    Hope we don't collapse now like the last 2 seasons
The Boers are the greatest of all the white tribes.
Well played Scotland from New Zealand!
Scotlad 🙌
Duhan van der Merwe try !
South Africans smashing the poms
Van der Merwe what a player
Did they miss the genge try
Duhan van de Merwe, now there is a right old Scottish name. Great try though.
In fairness to England they are running the ball a lot more with the new management. Great game
Great match. Pity about the commentary.
Love having YT highlights but please do the basics right. England had such a good half time break they gained 7 points......
The problem with england is owen Farrell . Hes not enough creative as a fly half and he sucks as  a centre . He may have won the Heineken cup 3 times with saracens because they have strong forwards .
Duhan van der merwe that try wow how many players did he beat🏆
Magnificent solo try and a great team performance. Well done Scotland from a Kiwi fan :)
Kongratulations Scotland💯💯💯💯👏👏👏👏great win.
What a complete shambles 👎
Bet 1 million on france winning the tournament . Bonus grand slam winners
France grand slam 🏆
That try tho at 01.09
The improvement in Scotland has been remarkable.  The athletes - across the park - look more comparable to their opposition, the coaching is top notch, and some attacking X factor really makes difference.  On their day does Scotland have a chance to win a quarter final at the WC and play in the Semi?  England can turn it around - but I think Eddie will be missed - he's a master tactician will a pedigree in winning 'knock out' Tournament Rugby.
Last Scotland try after a forward pass. A Greek friend of rugby.
Brilliant result! Nice to wake up to that in Brisbane 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Guess who’s winners again at twickenham
Oh how lovely. I bet they’re glad they sacked Eddie 😂
The 6 Nations comes alive and the Calcutta Cup delivers another stonker. Every player that took to the paddock today deserves credit. It was a fantastic game of rugby.
Sacking Eddie was a good idea then
Another great game absolutely ruined by Mark Robson
You missed an England try?
And the Brits accuse the ABs of poaching! So many non-British players on display here.
Surely gotta be the shitest highlights ever, come back from half time and they did show the try and conversion
If that's all you have from a Welsh man, God help you
🏈 Come on Scotland!!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
In a 4:40 long video, 35 seconds are dedicated to the players' exit at the half, and some 40 seconds to the post game hand-shaking. Meanwhile, one try from England is missing.
Always find it genius, when the score isn't showing- in the title!
What a sensational game. Well done Scotland!
Good game good win
Guess this is the only win for Scotland
Boere power 💥
Peter Vardy - def one to watch out for in future.
<3 thank you i just woke up and what a pleasure to see England loose x)
What a boss DvdM
England dreadful as always
I don't know what system you use to make highlights, it's a disaster though. Every year the same problem with your highlights, missing replays of some tries, missing even tries that were scored, missing even important moments of the game.
3 in a row boys 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🥹
Goodnight England
Brilliant 👏
Well done Scotland, well worth the win but good to see an England Coach picking players in form and not by reputation, after all Leicester and Bristol are tearing it up in the Gallagher.
Great win. Let's hope they can now string a few victories after this
VDM  beating 6 Englishman for that try...English defence looks  they still on COVID 19 protocols... ..
South Africa beat England once again. Nice one.
A fine Scottish  name. Lmao.
The game has changed. Is tackling no longer allowed?
🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Absolutely brilliant.  From a Kiwi born Scot.
England fan here but well played Scotland, the better team & a deserved win. Can’t see us getting anything out of the Irish or French & Wales is never easy.
I'm a big Cricket 🏏 fan Nigeria  .. I love England Cricket 🇬🇧 but sad to see there are no massive capacity stadiums for Cricket in UK like rugby or football 😭😭
Bring back Eddie!!!
Well done Scotland. The Pommie grub is a bitch. New Zealand salutes you.
Funny to see Scotland so excited … won by a couple of lucky breakaway tries
Well done Scotland 👏 ✔️ I am glad a South african born has done us proud in Cape Town. Super victory ✌️ may there be many more !!!
ah yes, the famous Scottish highlands McVan Der Merwe Clan
Well done to Scotland.
Oh this makes my heart happy !
Argentina suffered this scottish team and now here is why, the FB is amazing
Well done Scotland, but England?, I mean Danny Cole, Farrell, his game plan, kicking?, Looked slow after all those replacements, France and Ireland will run riot.
Stunning victory Scotland. Consistency next.
Well that's the try of the year contest over in February
Scotland you Beauty !
1:13 Try of the year, and it's only February.
Scotland play some scintillating stuff. But can be there own worst enemy with some daft decision making.  Russell is a mad genius but he would give any Scotland supporter a heart attack.  England still will have a big say in things .did alot of good but still too rigid. As a neutral it was great entertainment
What  a Game , well done Scotland - From a Kiwi down here in Communist NZ
Duhan van der Merwe...a typical Scottish name.
England coach all talk, they got owned
Pure power and speed from duhan van der merwe What a try 💪
The power game just don't work for England now....
1:49 the most obvious forward pass I’ve ever seen poor reffing
England played like a bunch of halfwits they had no idea of why they were on the pitch
What a game by Scotland and England and what a phenomenal try by Duhan Van Der Merwe!! 🏉🏆
Good on ya Scotland!!!!!!!
Scotland played well, but yet again England managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. I don't understand why England persist in their standard tactic of kicking and hoping when they're within spitting distance of the tryline. It seldom works in their favour, almost invariably resulting in nothing more than surrendered possession. New coach? Plus ca change, plus le meme chose...
A very satisfying game of hard fought rugby, end to end👍🙂 Well done to Scotland and England.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Where I come from Duhan Van Merwe would be know as "Wot - A - Boykie!" 🙂
It's astonishing that after decades of disappointment....a Scottish victory in the Calcutta cup now seems almost routine. Incredible. Wish my dad was alive to see this.
Amazing try by Duhan but wtf I didn’t know you only had to live somewhere for 3 years so you can internationally play for them. Worlds gone mad.
Fantastic! Just beautiful!
indredible scots try
What a difference a South African on the field makes. Just a shame duan vdm isn't in the green and gold.
Fantastic game
well that was a great game, and well played Scotland, cant see us beating anyone apart from Italy. Ill be surprised if we get past the group stages in the world cup. Perhaps we should have stayed with Eddie.
England are just a free win for Scotland at the 6 nations these days.
The Scots have beaten us again. What a surprise. 🙄
Love it 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
We did it
`The pressure will be chasing them down the street`
NZ/SA/Wallas gonna love this. England no where near.
Why are the other 2 videos hidden? We wanna see it coz the quality of those are better
All of the trys were spectacular, wow what a game
Some game that. Two good teams going at it.
How's Brexit going Richy
Time to sack the English coach,same rubbish,kicking blah blah
As a Kiwi living in England this makes me happy. Serves you right for sacking Jones, your best coach in 20 years. Good luck making it out for pool play 😂😂😂
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Get rid of smith. England seeking another average pin up boy.
Fantastic end to end rugby from both teams.......brilliant advert for the game
Try of the year
I always back Scotland 7
Lekker Duhan!
There are just some videos you want to give many more thumbs up to. This would be one of them. Great finish Scotland!
Well done Scotland. As a Welshman, I can only dream of us playing with the passion, bravery and vision you do
Excellent
What kind of highlights leave out an England try ? Highlights went from England 13 to England 20 without showing the try !!
Well played Scotland, hat off to that expansive attacking rugby of yours. England was poor defensively, need to improve that part of the game and quick as I can see Ireland and France tearing us apart, and please oh please don’t play Farrell in the centre, he is too slow and can’t influence the game from there. Matlins as good his two tries is not a winger and too lightweight, every tackle he got brushed aside, put a proper winger in!
DVM unreal try, on of the best I’ve seen in the Calcutta cup
Love watching the most overrated team in rugby lose again and why does the English trys get replays but the Scottish doesn't. Northern hemisphere rugby is boring
Im sorry to say this but Smith is a complete defensive liability. I know he is a great attacking weapon but he really lets us down on defense.
Absolutely brilliant! Buckled chariots everywhere!
BRILLIANT
BBC sport tonight didn't want to talk much about the result .mmmm
Well played to Scotland! Even though I'm disappointed with the loss, that's the most exciting Calcutta cup I can ever remember... And if we're going to lose, I don't mind losing to tries as beautiful as that. Excited to see this England team rebuild under Borthwick, I think there's much to be excited about.
No longer bullied , a great result  for Scotland away , and the try of the season so far .
not good enough against Scotland, they deserved the win
I wish England would stop that aimless kicking. Not taking anything away from Scotland, best team won. That try was something else.
great stuff from the scots......  sorry to say but eddie jones sacking so close to the world cup was a mistake.  RFU is a bumbling, stumbling organism similar to the ARU.
DVM with the try of the year contender in February. What a result. Eddie would be loving this haha
Wouldnt have happened if Eddie was still at the helm LOL
DvdM wow
Pathetic tackling by England for 3 of the Scottish tries. Scotland deserved the win.
Dumb question but anyone know why they walking in at half time and not running? Maybe a time rule change?
Scotland,south africa and Ireland is gonna be a crazy pool to watch in the world cup.
england turning to a banter team
Well done Boks
The South Africans had a good game 😉😉
Duhun Vander merwe born in s a we still beat the England and eddy Jones is not to blame
Gutted
Great match. @GuinessSixNations - a whole try and conversion was missed here? England end the first half on 13 and start the second on 20. Show us the try, please? 🤞
Best I've seen end to end but great timing  to get the well deserved win magic moments  by van the man boom and the scotand team
Well done Scotland from an ABs fan 👏 Van der Merwe is a beast
Big Scotland fan here and delighted by the win... but, consistently poor highlights in this channel.  You missed out a try!!!! That game deserved 8-10 minutes of highlights.  Show all the scores.  Show more of the build-ups to the scores.
What a win for the Scots England battered lol
i have waited literally my entire life to see us turn England over on their own patch (in front of a crowd). proper goosebumps.
Was England's 3rd try really boring...?
A memorable performance by the SA winger, an all time great solo try
Get right in there!
Scotland played a stormer of a game and beat England again... This is going to be a great competition. I think Ireland will be looking at Scotland and France real hard over the next couple of weeks.
BRAVO L"Ecosse. Wonderful, well deserved result from great running rugby. So entertaining to watch. Brave hearts indeed. Keep going lads.
Bravo à l'Ecosse, et bien fait aux anglais !
congrats scotland. proud
Well done Scotland from New Zealand
Congrats South Africa! You beat us again!
Borthwick ball won't work at international level. It was only just working at Leicester.
Scotland deserved that one. Far from their best but good enough to beat Borthwick’s England
Well done, Scotland 👏 I wonder who England blames because Eddie is not there anymore 🤔
Grande vittoria della Scozia
Ja well , no fine !
Honestly what an astonishing win, being a Scotland fan almost feels surreal, this fixture is definitely my favourite, it’s always too close for comfort, world cup year is starting off spectacularly!
Well done South Africa! You made Scotland proud
Bien escocia  , muy vien el sudafricano terrible potencia
Congratulations Scotland
Edited by a blind man
They need to drop Marcus smith, he can’t tackle
amazing you show a replay of marcus smith cross field kick but not VDM’s wonder try….
What a game, hard luck in England
Calcutta cup becoming the el Classico of rugby. Easily one of the best games that we will see this year
Video goes from a half time score of 13-12 to 20-13, I though you would have at least shown All the tries @Guinness Six Nations
Maro Itoje nowhere near the level of Eben
I’ve not watched the game, but would be curious if flow of the game and quality that people are talking about is a result of less time wasting prior to set piece.
Well done South Africa for beating  England 😂
It's been said before many times but I'll say it again in the hope someone on the other side listens. Whoever edits these videos does an absolutely terrible job. It's a travesty. Well done Scotland. Well deserved!
why no show the 3rd try of england in the highlights?
That's pretty rubbish editing: 31-12 when they go in at half time, 20-12 next time the score flashes up. England try edited out.
England have had their coach for too long. Time for a change LOL.
too short
How do you show half a minute of guys walking off the field and forget to show a goddamn try? Weird highlights...
Itoje, Curry, Vunipola all coasting. Defense abysmal, ingenuity lacking. Smith looks like a cockatoo. Sweep the whole lot out and replace them with the under 20"s. Bring back storm eddie.
Well done Scotland. I've said it before, I'll say it again, big mistake getting rid of Eddie Jones. 🤣🤣🤣🇬🇧
Well done Scotland,  from an irish fan 👍🏻👍🏻
Tae think again! Duhan or white as man of the match?
Nice Scotland putting England into their place
Why would they not show the replay of that Try ?Absolutely Amazing 👏🏽
Damn that was an impressive win
How the tide hath turned. Scotland in three tests vs England have produced three wins on the bounce. Twice at Twickenham in two years? Unprecedented achievement. I dunno the last time Scotland have beaten England at Twickenham back to back. But Unbelievable performance from Scotland. They were up against an England team with a new coach and still they produce a performance like this. The first 20 minutes is always where the tone is set and Scotland had the upper hand after the first quarter and from there despite England having the halftime lead were able to wear down the English Defence and from there onwards there was only going to be one outcome. Duhan Van der Merve was out of this world. Two tries that sunk England in Twickenham, one from long range and the other with brute strength despite the attention of at least three defenders. No doubt he was the difference and clear-cut Man of the Match. But well played Scotland. England has got a lot of work to do before they host Italy
England get battered everywhere they go.
Well done  Scotland what a game  🇮🇪
England were sent down the tunnel 'tae think again'.
4.39 minute video of highlights and you show us over 30 seconds of teams walking in the tunnel? What a joke of a channel. Keep up the good work dipshits
You're welcome, Sotland :) Warm regards - South Africa.
Borthwick will be gone in a year and the RFU put him on an immediate 5 yr contract. Absolute muppets
Always good to see Scotland's South African contingent haunting the English, but in all seriousness what a great match.
What a fucking game!
I'm English but I love that Scotland can kick some ass now! HELL YEAH!
poor highlights, missed lots of action
For Gods sake stop playing two number 10’s and get flanker who can tackle. Curry too many mistakes and two numbers tens equals confusion in defence. Farrell missed two kicks and is a liability in defence. Someone needs to bite the bullet before the World Cup. PLEASE
A huge win for the United nations of rugby, they'll  be eating deep fried mars bars in Johannesburg tonight 🤣🤣
Any game the grinning idiot Farrell plays in, and his team loses, is a bonus. Welgedaan Ruan v/d Merwe , boerseun. Ons is trots op jou Afrikaner!
Great win
So good from Scotland. Hope they play just as good against Ireland and France
Eddie Jones laughing in Australia 😂😂
You gotta love the 6Nations. Quality game!!!!
Try of the tournament????👍
England cant open a can of beans, let alone a defence. Same $hite different manager.
Hi
Eddie - come back please, all is forgiven !
Let's wait for France & Ireland to see how good we are.
Well done Scotland. Hope England realize now that that they have fired the best World Cup coach in rugby.   Good luck Borthwick and England, I have a feeling you are going to need it.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The commentators Said what a great game.Are they having a laugh? Fair play to the Jocks Only one winner  to be seen while watching it.England's green and pleasant land had enough spaces for A dozen tower blocks to be built on. Had to just rub arthritis rub on the back of me neck after watching the ball for an average of over thirty minutes through out the game in the air.Both sides were a comedy of errors.What with Italy these two sides will be competing with Italy for the wooden spoon
A relief to see that the Netflix series might get a few cracking games to cover!
3 TIMES 😂😂😂 CAN WE PLAY YOU EVERY WEEK
Fabulous game to watch
You love to see it
Duhan van der Merwe's 1st try was one of the best i have ever seen alba gu brath!
No words needed🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Pretty to watch. Unless you are English, eh 😉.
Looks like itoje was about to cry at the end !!!
Well done Scotland , did us proud !
same old england...bit depressed. Scotland clinical and deserved winners. Neither are going far in the WC on this showing
One of the best games in an awful long time open end to end rugby!!
Wooow well played Scotland first upset of the tournament lets see how they can play against two favourites vs Ireland and France
Well done my Celtic Brothers over in Scotland☘️☘️☘️🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
I don’t like names in rugby jerseys 😢
Where's the rest of the highlights? Saw more of the teans walking in at half time than anything else.
Well done Scotland from Ireland
hahahahaha, england sucked
Just miss out a try why don’t you
Wow, fantastic win Scotland. Expected England to win by 10 but what a performance. Scotland definitely have the edge over England now. I fancy you to beat Wales next, just hope you won't beat Ireland. Think Ireland can win the grand slam but I'm very nervous of a slip up in Murrayfield. Good luck in your other games
For a country that sing about how "Scotland get battered", England really don't seem to batter Scotland very much in sport.
where's the highlight of the England score from 13 to 20?!
Great result for the Scotts🏈
SWING LOW LOW 😂
Oh yes!!!!
The english team is going to breake Marcus smith
We are massive
Another memorable Scotland performance, commentary 🔥 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Well as an England fan  it’s  not  the results  we  Was  hoping  for  but  you have to admire  the 2 tries  that  VDM  scored  the 1st  one  was  on  a different  planet  well played  Scotland
Leave it to a South African to score one of the best tries..
Well done Scotland
When Finn Russell finds his feet Scotland are gonna be helluva formidable!
No comment
Well done scotland
Excellent performance from Scotland. Again, Very poor from England.
Crazy crowd
