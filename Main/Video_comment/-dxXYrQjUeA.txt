Two gorgeous young queens.  I like these two together. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This song was so underrated
This was me and a girl I worked with 😂😂  the guy I was with, apparently was her guy first and he cheated on her with me. We didn't know each other at the time,  when we started working together, I would talk of him but never say his name, I said hers to him one day and he started asking a thousand questions. Get to work she's like I didn't know you such and such🧐🤣🤣🤣
This needs a part 2
Same girl the ladies version
Who’s here after that shaderoom Post.
Who's here after Queen's post about not liking her raunchy lyrics in this song?
Anyone else coming from Instagram after seeing her comment?🤣
Y'all cant just leave em lol woman do better yall
See never let a man ruin yall friendship cause niggas be playing
Same girl. Usher and Rkelly did it first. And sadly, way better.
God curtosy from taedatea He obviously want to meet you. Lol where u been????

Ooh, ooh, ooh Ah, ha, ooh, ooh, whoa, ooh Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh Girl, I feel a way, need some Chardonnay Just got my hair pressed after I see him, Goldmember Beyoncé Ooh, I thought it was just me (I thought it was just me) He came and laid the D (he came and laid the D) The nigga turned me out (out) When he went down South, I had to change my sheets Ooh, your man must be nasty (nasty), just like mine Love his dark brown eyes, and he packs nice Hmm, sounds about right but what's your plans tonight? Anything and everything (quick as ever) Daddy wanna do to me (oh yeah) Anything and everything Daddy wanna do to me (ever) Everything Lovin' when he sexin' me Said anything and everything Ah-ha, ah-ah-ha (girl, let me tell you what he did) He grabbed me by my waist, threw my panties on the floor He ate it like a cake then we broke the headboard Love the way he smell when he wear that Tom Ford Hit it so good, had me beggin' for some more Ooh-ooh, ooh girl, I know how you feel My man wear the same scent Told him it's my favorite He just got a new whip too, G Wag' like blue And we made love in it 'til the sun came through Wait, was there letters on his plate? (What?) Do it start with L and end with an H? Yeah, I think it do, girl, what you tryna say? You might be confused, might've seen him 'round the way Do he got a tat' on his neck that say "The realest"? Do he got a room with a mirror on the ceiling? Do he got an ex out West he used to deal with? (What?) Girl, if your nigga, is my nigga, I'ma kill him now, ooh, ooh Everything I'm doing anything and everything To him if he fuckin' with you, ooh And he fuckin' with me too, ooh Everything I'm doing anything and everything (better not be fuckin' with you) To him if he fuckin' with you, ooh Tell me girl, what we gon' do?

This was my favourite song in my matric 2021😂❤ ironically i'm a gent😂😂 today it's the 29th of August 2024 and still here.
2024
❤️💙💚
I hate when the songs better than the video
Whats wrong with having two women men suppose to have other women africans and Muslims have 7 women in africa
Looking at it years later, definitely a girl version of "Same Girl" with R. Kelly and Usher without the twins being the plot twist
This is the new The Boy is Mine it's so good!
Came to see in 2024 if they acted out the restaurant scene yet 😢 #dope video and song 💪🏽💪🏽🌹
2024444❤❤❤❤❤❤❤still hereeeeee
Never heard this but its fire
Ari is just the most beautiful thing ever! From her spirit to her looks! 💯
Alternative universe version of Belly 😂😂
Queen I love your voice!!
✌Peace and respect to the female 🎶 🎶 singers 🎶 listed as Queen Naija and Ari Lennon acting as in showing out by the attached 🎶 musical 🎶 🎶 joint and mimicking the art of made-up communications in ways that some males and females communicate and or can relate to by someway.👌
Female version of Same girl with R Kelly & Usher
Ari look so mf good 😩🤪🍫
Love this song and the energy of these beautiful ladies. This exactly how women need to react to foolishness.
How cheeky
Not yall taking him to get his favorite food to set him up 😩 woulda took his ass straight to the city dump 🤣
i love this
I love this! ❤  I just like the man at the end being tied up with tape over his mouth. I kind of felt sorry for the dude lol
SONG TOO SHORT  NEEDDED MOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE tO FIRE
its ari for me
This the female version of that R Kelly Usher song. 🔥
One more thing, the beat. WOW! MIND BLOWING. GOOD BEAT, WHOEVER MADE IT. You know yourself.
Ari Lennox Queen Naija i love this song, and great job looking forward for more great projects from both of you, not forgetting the director for this video Val Vega. Good job. The video was a great one. Just like a real music video suppose look like. Again, great song girls. And great directing by Val Vega
Usher and RKelly same girl vibes. Dope to hear it on the other side.
Remember when this song dropped, Ari killed this.  No disrespect to Naija but Ari was ittt here
Same girl❤by r Kelly and Usher??😊
It's Sad when some women don't value themselves
Let me in. 😊
D I V A S!!! 👏🏽💖💖💖
The way this song is written is so dope
Usher and R Kelly ain't got nothing on Dis with the Same Girl. You betta play if you want to and handle your business with Ari and Naija. This negro betta have a twin. 😜
I couldn’t even focus on the video. Queen Naija hair is so good!!!😭
I was HOPING they were going to do the twin surprise at the end of the video like R Kelly and Usher "Same Girl" video
This Song is so underrated 💕
They sound so good together!
need a album with them both asap
Why am I just hearing this!? 🙏🏾 Siri. I asked her to play sum I’d like. ❤️
❤❤
R.KELLY-SAME GIRL
Favorite jam currently
Those dam fake raptor claw nails be killing me,not only I don't think they're cute in no way but I don't want no female to touch me with them stuff on
That's not the energy real women carry... They still hold themselves together and don't let nobody change them nor their ways of thinking and operating... That's the problem with women artist... There's no real role models for young females... Its always about money, sex, status and revenge... We need the wise elders back bcs most of today's women have failed the younger generation miserably!
I love this song! Not quite the way I saw this video being (in my mind), but it was cute for them.
Went back to this vid..I forgot how much I love this song
YASSSSSSS GIRLS
this is the shittiest music i've ever heard
Remember Same Girl by R Kelly ft Usher??? Mmmkay..
❤️❤️❤️Yes~ This joint my Jam🧁
Ever since I heard this #repeat
This is a better plot twist than most films
Worse than the boy is mine
One of my favorite Songs by Queen 👑
Has anybody even notice the dude in the background with his hands tied up with his hands behind his back and his mouth covered up like they use straight set him up women need to do that s*** for real for real instead of getting down each other cuz it wasn't person don't even know that she that he got a girl but then the one girl finds out about the other girl but they don't even know about each other like this dude is  like clowning  playing them come on this is what we need to do
I really do like this
Such shot, so appealing🌊
Queen is soooo underrated and don’t get enough recognition!!! Can’t believe I’m just hearing this
So y’all see the energy he was give Ari 😜🤣 but that’s right set it on up ❤
Need part 2
I did this to my bf in HS lmao
Ima guy and i love this song 😂 I love music regardless what the subject is. Talent is talent! idk where i heard this from but I knew I had to do some searching..this song kills !!! 🔥

This collab is 🔥🔥🔥🔥 love it yeessss Queen And Ari
I love when they sing their phone conversation❤
LOL, I loved this video and I have watched so many times, that I did not notice that the guy they tied up in the video, was my main man himself,  "Lucky  Daye", my new favorite artist. After I noticed it, I immediately said , oh hell and yes,  he was set up and laughed.  🤣😂 I see the ladies were having fun with this video. 😃 and I also enjoyed the music lyrics and video. thank you.
The fact that this is 1 year old today🔥🔥💨 April 15th 2021 and it's April 15th 2022 today

Side part Queen is a vibe
queens voice at 0:49 😩

This reminds me of Usher and R. Kelly "Same Girl". Love the vibe...
Which is which?
It’s giving same girl with usher and kelly but with women this time
This is perfect! I love it! ❤
Time traveler: *Moves a chair    Timeline when R kelly made same girl:
Ari voice reminds of a modern day Erica Badu with a sultry & sassy voice. Queen Naija's voice with her runs are effortless. Their voices vibe so well, because their not try outdo each other. And they some absolutely gorgeous woman. Im an old head, so this is my style of music. 🙌🏾. I love It 😍
I guess all the curators are dead. We only remake things at this point. Def giving Usher and R Kelly "same girl"
Yaasssss CAN NEVER GET BORED OF THIS SONG & TO BE HONEST.... BOTH OF THEM ARE SOME BEAUTIFUL, CREATIVE, AMAZING WOMEN
I think that I’m actively in love with Ari, because😩😍.
This is the 2021 version of Brandy and Monica THE BOY IS MINE😂

"We messing with the same Boy... same boy" 😆

Same Girl 2021  R.Kelly should get some writing credits for this bop.

I loooove this 🤍😭 geddit queenith & ari 🔥
Love it!!! The only thing I dislike is why didn't yall show the set up
How about let's choose a man that's actually a decent human being so we won't have to do all this. And let us not sleep with them before we know their character so we don't lose our dignity and have our hearts broken. These songs sound good when you're 12-18 and then one day you wake up and you're like uh.. no they're encouraging dudes to use women degrade and discard them and then we have vengeful angry women who are walking around hurt because the man is not doing his part to take care of us and treat us like ladies. so. ;-; we wonder why crap is so screwed up because chicks are giving the milk away for free and the dudes aren't buying the cow.
This is 🔥
This hon be on the news soon…….don’t go to far with it :(
Waited on this song since the snippet and they did not disappoint this is the best Naija has sound I want her to get better producers who can bring her voice out cause this is it!!!
I put this one on repeat and vibe
Ari Lennox would be Monica Queen Naija would be Brandy. Fo sure. All my opinion.

This definitely the girl female version of “Same Girl” by Usher! Queen, you really out done it👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
People said the most but I'm down with this track.
Anybody notice they playfully talking about calling the guy out in the song, but end up kidnapping him in the video?  That escalated quickly.
YESSSSS MAAM!!!!!!!
Who else done this before? 😘😜
I can listen to the first 10 seconds of this song all day!!! 🔥🔥🔥🎼🎵🎶🤗🥰
The vibe of the video was reminiscent of Brandy & Monica's "the boy is mine".

New generation of Queen Najai N Ari Lennox just like Brandy N Monica
Happy Mothers day!!
I don't get how this Queen NAIJA song is said to be related to "SAME GIRL" by R .Kelly and Usher.
Love it so much. Verses women fighting over a man giving him the upper hand. That's how you do it.. Yesss ladies🤎‼
This is my new favorite song
This song is all of it
Like the new Beyonce and Shakira, but in this Era. I feel it
Narrative✅ Lyrics✅ Sound/Visual Design✅ Sexy not Trashy ✅ Instant Classic✅
Female version of same girl. I dig it
I STALK people on twitter to see what people tweet w/out having to follow anyone mind your own life and embrace your own life -how others live their life should never be yours or anyone’s concern Thankfully I never make it my choice to live by other’s life advice because it’s not my responsibility to live up to anyone’s expectations  I never make it my choice to care about other’s opinions because it’s not my responsibility to live up to anyone’s expectations
We messing with the same boy, same boy how could the love of my life and my potential husband be the same boy, same boy 🤣😂😂 darker version of the song same girl lol
This is a girl version for Same Girl
I love Ari, she is so beautiful ❤❤❤
This has such a sweet melodious and nostalgic rapture that brings me back yet,  has such a new exciting sound with the combination of these queens 👸🏾👑🤩⭐💕
Version USA de ella y yo (don omar y ventura) JAJAJAJ
This song should get a part 2
This reminds me of Brandy and Monica The boy is Mine 🥴😍
Nice song and two beautiful young ladys
I love that you guys are telling a story!!

Imagine Naija and Khordelia tho... the worlds population would double. Angelic transcendence.
🔥🔥🔥 keep em coming
❤️❤️
ITS GIVING THE BOY IS MINE I LOVE IT
What happened to war cry? What happened?! You were right... we must see the Blood of Jesus. Even if you didn’t write the son but just sang it, you do this? I’m not judging you. I’m just not understanding. God bless you and I will pray for you
Didnt Usher and Kelly do this already? And also Monica and Brandy?
Same girl remix lol
🔥
not for me..its too fast or something ...cant understand what they saying clearly ...
Ari just been killing every song she’s been on and queen wow you really showed off your different tones you both sound and look amazing

How can anyone say that Ari Lennox is anything else but pretty?
This song is actually really fucking good
Love this
I just love both of them..and these lyrics are bomb asf!!
I love that they're not going after each other when he's the one cheating. Plus I love the random throwback blow up couch from the 90s
Ari should never ever ever get a nose job. Her beautiful nose is one of the top things that makes her unique.
This song 😍I had to put it on my latest mix!!!
anybody getting this "rkelly ft. usher - same girl" vibes here?
Yaaaaaas queens!🔥🔥❤❤
Okay Queen this is the 2nd video I've seen and you've had some man tied up and gagged. I'm starting think you are a dominatrix on the DL.

YESSSSSS I love this this is the narrative that we as women especially black women need to see more often. Two women unfortunately got played in instead of being stupid and fighting each other over a fuck nigga who doesn’t deserve their time anyway for cheating on them they want to play him, set him up, dump his ass, and continue to be friends 🔥🤩
Omgggggg this is so cool that they made a song like this.

Love The Song But The Video Could Have Been Better !! Felt More Like A Ari Song Then Queen When You Watched The Video ...
🖤🖤🖤🖤
I don’t get Same Girl vibes at all. The entire point of that song was that they were mistaken....🤷🏾‍♀️
This was alright ........
I would’ve loved to seen a play on the Brandy & Monica “The Boy Is Mine”....it could’ve been a little more creative!
R Kelly and User must be happy as hell lol!
I love thissssssas
this is suuuuch vibes and they killed that shit !!!

Honestly the song is coo, but the music video could’ve been better. Like the song is R.Kelly & Usher Same Girl but the music video is Brandy & Monica The Boy is Mine. Would’ve been a bigger record if the visualization told the story, or any story...
I love it 🥰 just seen the ad then search it now I’m hooked
Love it all. Beauty, the song and the video.....❤❤❤

Same girl song vibes haha
This has my hype for Ari's next project her voice is everything and she just might be able to act too.
We love our @Queen Naija, my entire family loves the positive vibes she gives, a mom, a dynamic singer 🎤, a friend, a philanthropist, an activist for social justice, a survivor, an example for young women on how to be your best self when the odds are against you, a lady with substance , platinum award winner and future Grammy award winner! We love you Queen and Spicy 🌶 Mafia!
wow nice and well put together
I’m speechless! This is too good!!!!
Here for it🔥🔥
Giving Monica & Brandie “Boy is Mine” vibes
People on Twitter were saying not to support this bc of Queens colorist remarks. Yeah what she said was wrong and colorist but I do think ppl can change so I’m giving her the benefit of the doubt. I actually really like this song both women ATE!!!!
Not the same guy 😂😂
When they got to that plate...I was like OoO
28 Come unto me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 30 For my yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light. (Matthew 11:28, KJV)
There should be a part two , Ari ft Queen 😍
Pt 2??

Ari should’ve just had this song cause she ate 😭🔥🤌🏾
#goingthrough
Hardly noticed the lightskin chick! Ari is everything 😍
I love queen😍

Ariiiiii ateee this
Should have done the video like rkelly same girl and made them twins 🤦🏽‍♀️
Same guy -by Shaneil and Denyque. They did it first and better!!! 🇯🇲 are so underrated.
We love an Aries & Libra duo ! 😍
ari made this video for sure
ARiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ATE IT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ari’s voice is just.... 😩😍😍😍 my gooooodness!
Rkelly n usher same girl version
This whole video was Ari’s I’m sorry ... gurl better work
fiyeee
Here b4 this blows up! Ari and Queen naija should do more music collaborations!😊❤
This is the type of energy the world needs. Too many times I been in situations where the woman either wanted to fight me or try to creep under my nose  or was too scared to admit they was messing with my man.
Those who put thumbs down are really some haters smh these two ladies sounds beautiful video was amazing y’all haters can got to hell 💯
Ugh! Y’all girls killin it! This is eeeeeverything ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You ladies did that this song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥Ari is my favorite singer 💙♥️💗🧡
If only women was like this but nah they rather fight the besyfriend over a man that played them both
I wish I could’ve seen another  video of y’all catching him at the restaurant Fr!!😂
naija annoying af
When "The Boy is Mine" by Brandy/Monica meets "Same Girl" by Usher/R K*lly 👌🏾💖💜   ps. couldn't take my eyes off Ari oufff🤩
This joint dope!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Yeah like usher same girl
Real R&B .. they did a great job!
this is the modern version of the boy is mine with brandy and monika. So fire !
So he smashed two bad women. He didn't lose in my eyes.
This song is everything and they look amazing in this video! They slayed 😍
KILLED IT!!!!
ayoooo that comment about "Same Girl" is factssssss
Queen look so good 😭❤
Ariiiiiiiiiiiii yassss yass yasssssss yall look so beautiful. I'm loving this
The video should’ve visualize the lyrics
It's gettin' "HOT IN HERRE!"
This is nice yall should do a part 2
Pt 2
this is soul food fr
This must be a dark cocoa and light chocolate duo typa month cause sza and doja was some heat too! Ain't no complaints, i fuxks wit our black queens, heavy💜👑

Ari looking like a beautiful black Barbie Doll 😍😍😍🥰🥰
I like this. It’s fire
Sounds about right!!! ♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love this 🔥
THIS IS SAME GIRL  concept
Loving these beautiful talented Queens!!! ❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰
This is the best song of 2021 so far 🥰
Modern day "The Boy Is Mine" By Monica and Brandy. Yasssss go girlsss
Voices come together so beautifully smooth like butter 💫
🔥🔥🔥 love it.
I can't stop listening 😭
Their voice just magical together ❤️❣️💕 Ari so fiinnneeee
Yes 😍😍😍
I love them, I love this 🤍😍
Queen looks so good in this ❤️
I was thinking the exact same thing girl version of same girl
Did him dirty, black men don't cheat.
This is a straight vibe both women can sing tf outta anything. “Same Girl” vibe for sure and i stan for it!
'TeeEee boy is MiIiinnee'    NOT
Y'all know this is the message "The boy is mine" MUSIC VIDEO was tryna deliver. The song was built like that 'cause it's damn catchy & beautiful. But the music video shows how the situation should be dealt with -or maybe more aggressive. I already thought of Brandy & Monica when I read the title
Yess give me usher & R Kelly “same girl” but the girl version
this is like the boy is mine brandy and Monica meets same girl Usher and R Kelly
Yes to more grown vibes. 💕
2:28
This a whole story and I’m here for ittt♥️♥️
Yoooo this is hard!! Yess queens
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💕💕💕💙
This tuuuune so gooood😍😍🔥🔥is. Loving Queens💜💜 collaboration 💖💖, their voices complement.
Ari got that side teeth fixed I see
Don't confront each other..just set the nigga up...PUUURRR
Guuuuuurlll 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sorry I've been neglecting you sister but I'm about to listen like comment and share everything 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
ari is soooo <3
I like it a lot but can artist nowadays deliver a song without being so explicit?🤔 I think “same girl” and many classics are that because it’s not explicit. I think it’s very easy to write a song about sex and catch peoples attention.
YESSS!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love it 🔥🔥🔥
GOODDDDAMM!!😍🤤👏🏽”we like to set him up” Okayy🤚🏼
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💃🏽
Phenomenal female version of the track Same Girl by R Kelly ft Usher. This is truly exceptional. 🥂
A bop
Amazing artist indeed😭
I love those inflatable love seats 😂 reminds me of when I use to work at Spencer's back in the day ❤
Yes Ari! 😍
Same Girl.. Queens Style..love this chocolate 🍫 and vanilla 🍦 mix right here..😻🥂🔥🍾
Before I even press play, my pretty brown Ari better NOT be the side chick in the storyline while the redbone is the wife. I love Ari down and I hope she gets paid well for this, but I am tired of black women being depicted as NOT WORTHY OF THE NUMBER ONE SPOT.
This feels unfinished I’m going to need part 2  and 3 loool
Classy🌺
This a whole story!! I love it
2 Beautiful goddesses 😍😛😋🤭
Very Interesting  idea really need to set these men up team work ladies move it.
this not really all that 😓 .
Y'all did y'all thang. YesssQueen
It’s giving The Boy is Mine by Brandy and Monica...plus both are serving looks and vocals💜❤️
Ari’s voice is everything

They killed this!!! 🔥
Same girl type vibe 🥂

This is straight heat !
Why set him up when y’all gonna still be in his bed 😂😂🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
I hope y’all credit Denique and Shaniel for this.  Monica and Brandy did it first.  Hey this is a good song.
I didn’t think I would like the song but I doooo ! Y’all ate this
🔥🔥🔥we want part two. 😭
YA'LL ATEEEEEE
This is Amazing
Kelly and Usher did part 1. This is part 2. Dope though 💞💝
🔥
Love it
This a hit 🔥
Music is my blessing 🙏🏾 If you give me 5 minutes of your time, I promise you’ll soon agree with me 💯 Thank you for reading this ❤️
That guy definitely should have been Lucky Daye! That would have been a great feature 😂😂
This is giving me jhene Aiko vibe
This song is ass. Sorry not sorry.
This duet is the shit yasssssss ladies my shit on repeat👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
queens voice really fits with this vibeeee 💘
Omg i got to get this album Queen🙏🏾
Damn Ari Lennox 🔥
This is different and great for the ladies for a change for music videos.📻🛋️
Queen seemed very uncomfortable compared to Ari you can tell queen boyfriend is "controlling"!!!
Can someone tell me what time queen comes in so I can skip it.I'm only here for Ari.Not for a colorist bi#$h
Queen your so lit we love your song
Been on replay since it dropped 😩😍❤️ 🎶
It’s giving me same girl vibes usher & rkelly  I love this though they’re both talented & beautiful
Lesgoooo Queeeeeeeeennnnnnn 😩😩😩😩
Love this record .. seeing black queens coming together to make great music.. refreshing from this rap trash out here
This give me “same girl” vibe by usher and r kelly
Same girl R. Kelly and Usher 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
they need to do a set him up 2
Love this
I used to be a fan but after I saw this song I’m a  whole air-conditioner to queen naija
Missed opportunity to do an Action scene for the actual set up Teanna Taylor should’ve been the director
The boy is mine meets same boy 🤣
Concept: That boy is mine - Brandy & Monica, but they don't fight over him, they "set him up" instead :)
He looks like a sexier Mahershala Ali even though looks good on his own lol
I smell a dual album 👀🤔
This song on repeat and I don’t plate these games lol
Every body missing  R Kelly
this is everything fr
Who else thinks there's going to be a PART 2 !! Here for it 😍💯
Fire fire fire fire
💜💜
They both ate this up! This is deff my NEW JAM🎸 & the acting? ON POINT! 💪💯🙏Who else agrees? 💛
Why are people saying “The Boy is Mine”? If you guys actually LISTEN to the lyrics. “The Boy is Mine” is just two women fighting over one man. This is more like R. Kelly’s “Same Girl”. Where R. Kelly and Usher described the same woman and decided to set her up. Even the video pays homage a little.
Queen was uncomfortable with that man. It showed.
They should’ve done a part two where they did set him up and then sing to him, I love how they brought back old school r&b
Y’all it’s a Bad Bitches remake of “Same Girl “ with R Kell’s and Usher 💗😩🥰💜
Well I want to eat 2x’s, .. sooo?😶😬😬
A duo that I KNEW wouldn’t disappoint 💕
Oh this that old skool shit fr fr 🤪🤪
This shit is nowhere near comparable to Monica and Brandy. this shit fucking sucks
I think I needed part two
This is like a female mix of Same Girl, GOOOD!!! Now i dont have to stay silent on R Kellys part, ill settle for this jam from these 2 beautiful WOMEN❤️🙏🏾
favourite ARI feature
🔥🔥🔥🔥SAME GIRL VIBES 2021

Female R. Kelly and Usher Same Girl version.  Not really feeling this song tho. But I see what they tried to do with it. It's just a copy and paste of SAME GIRL.

Okay so to the ones that are saying the vibe of this song is The Boy is Mine no disrespect to all the 90’s people but I see it and here me out when I look at the video it’s giving me Same Girl vibes cause they find out they getting played by the same girl and planning on getting back at her and I seen The Boy is Mine and they basically arguing over the dude but coming towards the end and confronting the dude that they know what’s up.....that’s all just saying 🤷🏾‍♂️
I KNEW I was getting ‘Same Girl’ vibes but this wayyyy better. I love Ari Lennox, getting into Miss. Queen too. 🔥 🔥 🔥
This song is a whole vibe🥺🥺 and they so beautiful 😍😍😍
This is actually r n b and I’m here for it.. I’m so glad that singers like Kehlani, SZA, Queen, Ari, H.E.R, Ella Mai , Jhene , Jazmine Sullivan are a part of my generation and making good music bc a lot of these mofos making us look bad 😫

Queens voice is beautiful
This is the female version of Same Girl... but BETTER😝
Jesus died on the cross and resurrected three days later so that we can be made right with God or reconciled back to God, because our sins separated us from God. The wrath and punishment that was supposed to be on us for our sins, was on God(Jesus) in human flesh. Death(Hell) is the punishment of our sins because God is just but we can receive eternal life(Heaven) through Jesus Christ alone. Repent and trust alone in Jesus Christ for he is coming soon to take his people who are saved. Jesus will give you peace and joy if you trust in him. Don’t ignore this message cause this might be ur chance to get right with God and you can die today and u might be heading to Hell, but I want you to go to heaven. If u got any questions lmk
Giving me Usher vibe 💕
🔥💕
Okay switched it up .... R KELLY SAME GIRL TYPE OF VIBESSS ❤️❤️
Queen Naija don’t even like black women . Why Ari ? Whyyyyy????!!!!
It’s like they made a song out of that Blameitonkway So Gone challenge 😂

I’m glad Ari Lennox didn’t get her nose done to look like these ambiguous girls. She looks good just the way she is. 🥰🥰🥰
This is what women need to do when they find out they hv the same man. 🤷‍♀️
Ari was acting the scene better than Queen Naija.
Female version of Same Girl- Usher! Love it 💞💞💞💞
I was the 1M view ❤️❤️🔥🔥
This is too close to the concept for Ari's video with Kiana Lede which I loved. This is cute too but we gna keep seeing beds and house phones during 2021??
🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾
Absolutely amazing 🙌🏿
The 1 millionth viewwwww
This giving “the boy is mine “ Monica and brandy vibes ❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Two of my favs

Same girl vibes
SOO UNDERRATED OMG
Ummmm QUEEN MAAM! I knew you had this in you! GAH DAMN IT QUEEN! Everything flows so smoothly like OMFG! I’m screaming
Tf w/ dis BS?
Love the visual!!!‼️‼️‼️
I'm seeing many minds of my generation waste away from decadence and ideation. Trash like this is not for consummation. She needs more musical talent if she wants to write a ballad.
This is the first  song queen has sung which ive really liked
They knew what they were doing with this one!!!
So good❤
I feel like I’m in a salon on 7 mile...love this 💞💞😂
love the y2k feel it would be cute if they did a part 2 😭😭 jus like the 2000 ...use the idea and pay me lmao
Love how grown this is 🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful creation by gorgeous Black women ❤️
Wow ari is like overly beautiful 🧡
Amazing 🤩
PERIOOOODT
This gives Usher and Kells Same Girl vibes. This is the rebuttal Same Dude. I like the flow and vibe.
Messing with the same boy
Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior, is The WAY, The TRUTH, and The LIFE! Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord of your life. Believe in His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all human-kind and you will be saved.                               May Father God, our Creator bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior! ❤️
A boy asked a girl in a library: "Do you mind if I sit next to you"? The girl replied with a loud angry voice; "I don't want to spend the night with you !! Everyone in the library started looking at the boy and felt embarrassed. After a few minutes the girl walked calmly to the boy's table and said: I study psychology and I know what the man is thinking, I suppose you felt ashamed, right? The boy answered out loud: $ 300 for one night That's too much! and all the people in the library looked at the girl in shock and the boy whispered in her ear, "I study laws and I know how to make someone guilty ... 🤭    If you like the comment, please "write" on my channel ...

This deluxe album 🔥🔥
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming

For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6:23 KJV
For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, Hebrews 10:26 KJV
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Proverbs 28:13 KJV
#TeamJesus💪💪
When pride cometh, then cometh shame: But with the lowly is wisdom. Proverbs 11:2 KJV

Make a movie from this please
If you want to be saved do this. Here's what you must do. Admit that you are a sinner and that you need God's help. Be willing to change your mind and turn from your sin (repent). Believe that Jesus Christ died for you, was buried, and rose from the dead on the third day by God.
Please tell me there is an alternate video I would love to see the actual set up scene

DO YOU REALLY LOVE JESUS? Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.John 14:23-24 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him Hebrews 5:9 If you truly love the Lord, you will walk in obedience to him. Our obedience doesn’t save us but it proves to the Lord we love him. Jesus says if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed (John 8:31) so we have to follow the Lord and walk in obedience to him. Can someone who doesn’t love Jesus go to heaven? Obviously not, we probably to Jesus we love him through our obedience (John 14:15)
This should be over a milli by now what is going on

😂 women
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
I’m loving this video... YAAASSS Queens!!  Edit: can we get a part 2? 😂 I need to know how the set up went 😂

10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. I took an IQ test and the results were negative.  2. I've only been wrong once, and that's when I thought I was wrong.  3. We are born naked, wet and hungry. Then things get worse.  4. IRS: We've got what it takes to take what you have got. 5. 42.7 percent of all statistics are made up on the spot. 6. Be nice to your kids. They'll choose your nursing home. 7. The word "gullible" isn't in the dictionary. 8. Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time. 9. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it. 10. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool.  Editorial:Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit NeedGod.com.

1 Corinthians 15:1-4  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

This is the female version of Usher & R. Kelly’s Same Girl song!! If u ain’t too young to know what I’m talking bout then let me know by liking this comment!!
They should've did the restaurant scene 😩 it was still nice
I been waiting on this song for so long 😍🔥
Didnt saweetie say 1:03 - 1:23 in https://youtu.be/PPii0QbGtBw
I love you queen 👑!! You ladies killed this 🔥🔥 blasting on my way to work 🥰❤️
Queen is so talented. I like how she's getting out of her comfort zone but yet keeps it classy.
I like the ideas of to unique queen coming totogether
I was ready for them to really serve him tht plate .😂
This shit fire asf goddamn
Love it!!!!
Its cool queen , im from indonesia 🇮🇩
They’re both super pretty 😩😍
This is how it should always go down. What y’all fighting over a man for? Set him up and then go to the club 😄
Pray for the molested and abused children.  Pray for the elderly and weak.  Pray for moms and dads who have lost their babies.  Pray for the abortion, pray for the mother's who kill their own children. Come brothers and sisters lets pray for All who suffer. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL Praise Jesus Christ always 7💜
Its make me think about r. Kelly Usher : same girl or Brandy Monica : the boy is mine. Its more Ari's vibes, Queen naija sing like her sometimes
Geez, they're so ugly as heck.
Я ОБАЖАЮ его ТРЕКИ, просто сами послушайте https://youtu.be/T9KqeNyli9o
Foolishness grow up ladies

Y’all know y’all could of took us to the restaurant
Woman’s version of Same girl lol cute
Okayyyy girl version of “same girl” 🥰🥰🥰
Ari Lennox is such a queen Loving the boy is mine bedroom vibes
They’re copying off of Usher & Kells “Same Girl.”
Brandy&monica the boy is mine vibe& r.Kelly usher same girl vibe
Naija always look so rigid. Idk why. I love the song, but thats something i always noticed about when she performs. She never really lets loose.
Can barely understand what they are saying their voices are not clear and the music is too loud.
It’s giving same girl energy 😍
Yesssss here before a 1.M also I love how they both were going to set him up cuz y’all women be like I’m bout to beat her a$$ and she probably thought that was just her man like you did it’s the mans fault not hers I can see if she knows it’s your man but it’s still his fault to cuz he know he got a woman
beautiful liar vibesss
❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yasssssss! Bumping in upcoming car rides ✨ love that they came together in the end now in days females gotta always go against each other
I love it 🔥🔥🔥🔥
They both sound really good but to be honest it reminds me too much of R Kelly and Usher's Same Girl song. But they both looked beautiful and sound dope. I just wish there was more creativity lyrically cause we herd this storyline before.
I love this for some reason (๑♡⌓♡๑)
Oowee! I'm all set. BANGER!😍😍😍
Finally a same girl - girl version 🥰
I had that same blow up couch in my room & a phone that was attached to the wall 💀 I feel mad old..
Fire
Same girl 2021 girl version 🔥

Literally chills!!!😍😍😍
I'm feeling this Ari Lennox pure oldskool vibe.  Queen keep this up
Ari!!
Girl version of Same girl
This hit different because this actually happened to me shortly before this song came out to me & this girl we were both dating the same guy & he was lying to both of us so we set him up on 3 way..... i sent her this song. Crazyyyy 🙂
Why all the songs about sex , ass , bitches ,money and drugs ? I challenge these guys cannot write a song without using the above !
The U.S. will over issue 5 trillion U.S. dollars in 2020! In the first quarter of 2021, the U.S. issued another $1.9 trillion in over-issued currencies just first season ! Are these over-issued currencies interest-free?

This is fire!!!!!!!!!!
The new version of the “The Boy is Mine” instead of fighting over him they team up and set him up.
Feel like this was inspired by Brandy and Monica's "The Bot is Mine" video!
their outfits are so lovely and aesthetically pleasing
The exact same beat as boo'd up. When will R&B artists stop regurgitating the same style and keynotes looking for a hit??? And trying to sound nostalgic is getting played out now imo, very 2013.
Same Girl but 2021 version
Another hit💢 Queen Naija never disappoints her fans 👍if yo agree and Ari Lennox complement the song perfectly
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ratchet and predictable. It's a no for me. I love the classics. Brandy and Monica.
THINGS THEY DID: THAT! MAN THIS VIDEO IS FIRE, TOO GOOD❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥
Beautiful ladies❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love this song 😍😍😍
Queen, Im not a hater but I just never been a fan neither. But I’ll give credit where credit is due... this song 🔥🔥
Part2?????
🔥🔥🔥 love your music you bring back the old school r&b
They look so good🙌🙌🙌
ARI IS FUCKING GLOWING BRUH
Ari 😍😍😍
Vibe
This is amazing and  it remains me of that song we messing with the same girl just the female version and it’s wonderful
Does this remind anyone of "same girl" by R-Kelly and Usher!!
It's giving "Same Girl" vybezzzzzz !

Yasssss love it 2 of my fav singers in one video giving me 90s vibes

Giving same girl vibes
New Anthem!
💜💜💜💜💜💜🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is some keyshia cole and Ashanti woman to woman. Usher and R-Kelley same girl. But it's not better not feeling this jam.
I love the whole vibe🤩 of it all it took me back to my Brandy and Monica!!!🥰
I’m amaze how much talent Queen has and Ari and Queen they balance each other with the melodies the song is so smooth it’s a song that relate to a lot of females out the, there you go again.

I like the song... it takes me back to the late 90's early 2000's. That's the last Era of great music. But Queen and Ari give that vibe. I love it.
Both look amazing song is a vibe🔥🔥

Glory to the Lord! Accept the Lord and seek the Lord with all your heart and soul, truly repent and truly repent means to actually start to turn from your sin because if u ask for forgiveness while planning to go sin then that’s called a fake repentance and the Lord knows your heart. “Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.” John 9:31 KJV And also that means if you know your a sinner and try to ask the lord for stuff he will not listen so don’t bother. The only time he will listen to sinners is when you are truly repenting. Ask the holy spirt to help you turn from sin and to guide you you, read his wisdom, spread his wisdom and pray for the Lost souls so we can save as many people from damnation as possible. Can’t wait to see you guys in heaven! God Bless!
It’s definitely a vibe for me 🔥 🔥🔥🔥❤️💕
I love it

This is why you don’t lie to women by telling them you’re exclusive if you’re dating multiple women. Just say you’re keeping your options open and okay if they do the same.

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)

“Same girl” REMIX For Women
Romans 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 10:9-10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Ok Boy is Mine 2021 real R&B tings yasssss 👏🏾 😍💕
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
This is CUTE 🔥
YES QUEEN 👑
Ari is serving crazy sexy cool..its Ari for me 💫

Reminds me of Same Girl  with R.Kelly &Usher
This is giving me same girl vibes but boy instead 😭💕
I HOPE EVERYONE IS DOING WELL LOVE YOU person who sees this⭐️
This video is disappointing asf lol they couldve literally used the lyrics as a video concept, Ari goes on a date with the guy and Queen is the waitress or they lure him into a car with Queen in the backseat and they attack him or something lol
Great job Queen and Ari 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽💖  This scenario actually happened to my best friend.  I was on the phone with her describing my new boyfriend and how he just stood me up.  She started talking about this guy she just met and how much fun she had with him. She couldn't wait to see him again.  He told her he would call her later.  She was just gushing over him 😄. Then she started to described his facial features and that's when it hit me like a lightning bolt ⚡😲. You see Kevin had a scare on his face that made him very distinguishable .   I asked her if his name was Kevin and she said yes, why? I told her that was the reason why he stood me up. He saw you and spent all afternoon with you.  😲 So we formulated a plan 😈👿 to set him up 😄. My friend is a Jehovah's witness and I was Baptize at the time.  Kevin and I attended the same church. I  invited my best friend to church for a few minutes. She walked in during service and sat down next to me with Kevin there. He looked 😳 like he saw a ghost 👻 😂😂😂😂. That man silently left and we haven't heard from him since.  😂😂😂😂😂🥰
Giving me “same girl” by r Kelly vibes lol
This video was everything 😍😍

Yesssssss my girls ATE this!!!!!!! Love it!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good song but you can’t be mad at the guy lol
ok here's the treatment I had in mine: Queen in the back of a limo on the phone with Ari. Camera only on her side of the backseat. Ari at home on bed. As call is progressing and queen realizes that its Ari's man she's dating the camera pans over the other side of backseat. we see dude. Then Queen keeps talking on phone with Ari. Dude keeps texting queen qhile she's on phone. He says "act like you didn't know". Then scene cuts to Queen and Ari meeting dude at restaurant. Queen acts "pissed" Ari storms off. Queen stays with dude.

Let me first start off by saying they both have unique voices I never said they could not sing. I see what they were trying to do usher ft r.kelly this was a good concept but they should have had someone else write this song. I see where they were going with this video and song.

This giving me "Same Girl" Usher & Kells vibe!!
Yesss my girl Ari looking like that chocolate queen she is 😍🥰🔥
Call me nitpickyyy 😅😅BUTTTTT I think the minute they started setting up the “set up” they should’ve had it reenacted. Like so we could see him get to the point of being tied up on the bed. I think that would’ve been spicy. I’ma visual person and I think how it would’ve turned out would’ve been really nice. But its still a sexy ass mv & a dope song.
A colllab I never knew i needed. Fireee
So good!! I hope there’s a part two ...
i love this
🔥🔥🔥
Who produced the track? It got that Masego vibe.
Yesss  I love it. its  giving me Brandy and Monica  type of vibe 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
This song is a bop and they both look gorgeous. The nails and outfits are cute.
This definitely gives usher r kellys same girl energy I wish they would have acted out setting him up
🔥🔥🔥🔥
See people shady this is a good collaboration 👌 real R and B it's a Boop for me just support what people stand for now not things that happened from being young and ignorant like we've all have been
So the new “Boy is Mine” basically. I like it
We need a part two!!!!
SAME GIRL VIBES..LOVE IT !
Yessssss y’all look so pretty 😍
Beautiful liar vibes
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Keep whoever is the creative director, this is your best music video yet

Anything and everything (Quick as ever) Daddy wanna do to me (Oh yeah) Anything and everything Daddy wanna do to me (Ever) Everything Lovin' when he sexin' me Said anything and everything Ah-ha, ah-ah-ha (Girl, let me tell you what he did)  He grabbed me by my waist, threw my panties on the floor He ate it like a cake then we broke the headboard Love the way he smell when he wear that Tom Ford Hit it so good, had me beggin' for some more Ooh-ooh, ooh girl, I know how you feel My man wear the same scent Told him it's my favorite He just got a new whip too, G Wag' like blue And we made love in it 'til the sun came through Wait, was there letters on his plate? (What?) Do it start with L and end with an H? Yeah, I think it do, girl, what you tryna say? You might be confused, might've seen him 'round the way Do he got a tat' on his neck that say "The realest"? Do he got a room with a mirror on the ceiling? Do he got an ex out West he used to deal with? (What?) Girl, if your nigga, is my nigga, I'ma kill him now, ooh, ooh  Everything I'm doing anything and everything To him if he fuckin' with you, ooh And he fuckin' with me too, ooh Everything I'm doing anything and everything (Better not be fuckin' with you) To him if he fuckin' with you, ooh Tell me girl, what we gon' do? Oh, oh  Hey girl, I got an idea What if I call and told him, "Meet me somewhere?" Yeah, I could roll up with you in those tinted backseats And tell him, "Get inside" then surprise it's me Hmm, wait, I'ma ask him if he ate Yeah, that's a little better, take him to his favorite place Then when his food is ready, I'ma have you bring the plate Ooh, girl, I cannot wait to see the look upon his face, yeah  Yeah, we 'bout to set him, yeah, yeah We 'bout to set him up, yeah, yeah We 'bout to set him up, yeah, yeah We 'bout to set him up We 'bout to set him, yeah, yeah We 'bout to set him up, yeah, yeah We 'bout to set him up, yeah, yeah We 'bout to set him up

Ari carried the whole video. Facial expressions and all. Queen was so stiff and just singing to the camera. She need to loosen up and actually FEEL the words that she’s singing. Video could’ve had a better concept. Y’all need me to produce the next one?😂

A quick inspiration - Nothing that has happened to you is a surprise to God. God’s hand is always on you. He’s ordering your steps. If the door is closed, it was supposed to be closed. If the person walked away, they were supposed to walk away. Don’t get upset, keep moving forward. God has already worked the situation out. He has something greater in store for you. Declare by faith, “it is  already done” 💕🎆.

YES ARI AND QUEEN 👏🏽😍💥
I mean, I love Ari and errything but this is literally "Same girl" by Usher and Rkelly
Yessss Queen
You ladies look and sound beautiful! I just don't like it. Music videos are so lack luster and boring these days. Yall didn't do anything but sit on the phone and lip sync. We waited a long time for a vid that was basically nothing. I love both of y'all but the creativity is NOT THERE. The visual should match the audio. The Medicine video was so thought out and went perfectly the song. Thats why it did so well. I just think your fans owe it to you to be honest.
Now this some ishh i can vibe too!!!!  Real music !!!
Wish the visuals would have matched the lyrics with how they were going to set him up. Wanted to see a movie. Ari looked gorgeous but was washed out with the red whereas Queen looked bright a clear with her purple theme. Both women did their thing nevertheless
Y’all serving looks in this
angels 🙂🥺🤍
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🖤🖤🖤🖤🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💗
P🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ari looks so sultry in the warmer lighting and Queen served in the cool vibe. They slayed in contrast!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Perioddddd ❤️❤️❤️
So 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Y’all hating this video Is going
Listennnnn! Two bomb artist vocally and beautifully just killed the collaboration of togetherness! Ahhhhh! I love it! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ik this queen song but ARI ATE UP
Queen always tying someone up lol this song was a whole vibe 🔥🔥🔥
Baddies’ 😌🗣❤️❤️🔥🔥
Usher x R.Kelly “Same Girl,” vibes
Yessssss !!! 🔥🔥
Whewwww 🗣🗣 this is so 🔥🔥🔥🔥💃🏽🥂🤙🏽
Wow!  You ladies did the damn thing!
TODAYS “THE BOY IS MINE”...cinematographer good and song not bad🤔 could they have cast a better body boi...seem like the dude didn’t fit the description/vibe of the song
J
🥰🥰 I can't wait for this deluxe to drop tomorrow. 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Feeling the R. kelly and usher same girl vibe
This reminds me of brandy and Monica’s the boy is mine it’s like the new and improved version
Ari voice don’t play at all
From the 99 to the 2000🤣😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Love the video 💖💖💖💖
This reminds me of trading places with usher and rkelly
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕 It’s “Everything” for Me
It was giving me very much what it was suppose to give 💞🤍😍😍
So dope vocals,visuals,concept 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The video made me like the song even more 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is so “Same Girl” / “The Boy Is Mine” and I freakin love it. ☺️☺️😍
I was waiting to see if he had a twin brother 😅😂 guess not lol
Love how we get “Same Girl” for the concept of the song and “The Boy is Mine” for the concept of the visual yes Queens bring back and celebrate real R&B 👏🏽👏🏽
Definitely took me back to the 90s💜❤️
omg i love thissss , this such a good collab omg .
This is HARD🔥
Yesss 🎶😍😍🔥🔥🔥
Pop off sis🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I guess I’m the only one who doesn’t like the song or the vid 🤷🏾‍♀️🤣
Y’all def understand the assignment !! 🔥🔥🔥
Mannnnn!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Gave me the boy is mine vibes but when the women actually support each other when the cheating bum of a man played both of them
😱😱😱🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Get your ticket 🎫 here before 1million

Idc what yall say but we gotta give R.Kelly n Ush props tho same girl definitely inspired this

Y’all so dope
This is giving me Belly vibes low key, but y’all were giving visuals for sure. I loved this 💜💜💜💜💜

wooooooooooow I´m so proud of you, queen !!!!
And who will play this over 10 times yes .....me 🙌🏾🙌🏾🎧🎤🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love this
It's cool but to me the visuals and scenes could have been better and I say that based on your first video medicine that video had a better artistic concept, also it was a little similar to  Brandy and Monica concept/ r Kelly and usher and your director should have come harder when using that concept because visually and artistically Monica and Brandy/usher and Kelly bodied the same concept you all used, but the song is fire
Love this song!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Queen continues to shit on these haters!!! Continue to elevate!! Remember what  Queen B said best revenge is to paper.....
Yes ladies!!!!! I knew this video was about to be bomb and we were not disappointed. I love it 🥰 🔥👌💯❤️

Dopeeeeeee !!
I love it
I wouldn't be trying to struggle to get away if I was him 😍🥵...LOL! 😅😅😅
uhhhhh ain't this female version of same girl
Purrr🔥
Beautiful Job ladies you both look Gorgeous its my first  time. Hearing Ari: such a beautiful voice.  Queen: I see how much you prospered. You got so much confidence. You got everything you ever manifested. Wow! How God is with you. I see it all over you. Your  such a beautiful and talented voice. You give me confidence ladies in my insecurities. Thank you for your story.
They look good asf they did this ‼️😍🔥
This is like the sequel to "The Boy is Mine"lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wish they would’ve showed them actually setting him up. Still 🔥🔥
Queen is adorable I swear!
Love love love this concept. From Barbara and Shirley, to Brandy and Monica, and now Ari and Queen. This sounds like an homage to the boy is mine. Did anyone else hear that in the beat?? Either way they did the concept justice and I love how they teamed up instead of tearing each other down. Issa win for me 🔥🔥🔥
Okay okay okay but listen.... A JOINT ALBUM 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 would go crazyyy y’all’s energy together on a track is too beautiful not too 💜
This song stay on repeat in my car, been waiting on the video ❤️💋
💥💥🔥🔥🔥‼️FUCKIN SPICY‼️🔥🔥🔥💥💥🔥🔥 LOVE IT!!!! Do ya thang ladies!!💯
Loving it 💥🔥🔥

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Killing it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love to see it 😍😍🔥🔥🔥
Nah this song is everything 💜💜💜
Luv the video there both beautiful and talented they gave me modern day brandy and monica the boy is mine vibes ❤️❤️❤️❤️!!!
I wish they would have acted it out instead of being super sexy lol i still like it but we should have had some setting up happening
love this song
Queens 🔥🔥🔥
Now that’s some shit I would do
The person who made this video didn’t listen to the song 🤣🤣🤦🏽‍♀️ but It’s still dope🔥🔥
Is it just me thinkin that they are another Monica and brandy ❤️❤️❤️
Man this should have been the female version of same girl. Like when they show up to the restaurant to set him up it’s his twin...joint would have been craaaaazy! I mean this joint is still fye though!
Why do women keep holding Queen's mistake over her head? What exactly do y'all want her to do after apologizing? Haters stay bitter because it makes their own demons feel comfortable.
Video was so tasteful. The ladies looked beautiful. Just wish they didn’t use the n-word.
Omg Yess I love this!!  My favs 🥰 Y’all look so damn good!! I’m about to watch like 3 more times❤️❤️

Okay but that was sickening 🔥🔥🔥
I love the video but would have been better with the storyline on the video.

This was good but you guys should have paused the video and do a lil skit of her calling him up them meeting and you bringing the plate literally
Queen love your style in music thanks for being back the old vibez ♥️🔥

I don’t know who needs to hear this but God does certain things for a reason, it’s all for a purpose, and it’s all in his plan. He allows it to happen because he is preparing you for greater and better things. No situation is so far gone that God can not fix it. Just know that God never takes away something from your life without replacing it with something better. God loves you, he cares for you, and he will never give up on you. Keep worshiping and praising God, you never know where he might take you. 💕😊🙌🏽🙏🏽
