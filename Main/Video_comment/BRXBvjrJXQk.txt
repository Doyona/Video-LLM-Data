I'm like super late in catching up!! but i effing LOVED this. i really like the song, art style and everything. I love that every campaign is DIFFERENT, it's not supposed to be the same. Ya'll did great, i know ya'll moved on from this already but congrats to all of you.  All the love from a random nerd!! 💓
This is the only intro i skip
So my wife and I agreed I get a nat 20 I will have a good night. I rolled an 8. She said hold your breathe and roll….it was a nat 20. Im mad. I’m going to bed.
0:37  Isn't it cool how they kept Taliesin's essential tremor in his bit? I loved it!
this is the one and only CR video that gets a thumbs down from me
I like this intro a lot. Marisha's entrance always gives me chills..
Can we all take a moment to appreciate the fact that they gave Taliesin his tremor in the intro
that is so cool! <3
Didn't this have to get changed from the live action intro because a few sensitive karens got upset about it?
Coming here as a late-joining Critter still in love with Vox Machina and catching up on the later campaigns, I think this intro is fantastic!!  The concept art is incredible, I love the color palette, the imaginative blend of the real players with character actions/traits/animations…  Really well done!!!   And the action at the table captures the fun and frenzy!
Why does Matt look like the Jesus of DnD?
Anyone know the name of this animation
IT IS SO EPIC! Damn!
i love it <3
The song is my favorite so far!
this sadly feels like a downgrade from campaign 2
I am amazed thank you Critical Role cast
This song needs to be part of a DM's Pre-Game Pump checklist. Do yourself a favour and add this to YOUR pre-game Right Now
This is awful
this is literally the worse intro they did by now... i dont want to see the players, I want to see the chars... the style is terrible and cheap... colors are to bright... and everyone looks like some fever trip... please get a actual intro witht he characters doing something and not the players...  by now i think this was made with AI... i can literally pull out the same quality with an AI generator, maybe even better with zero cost other then time...
I would love if they reworked your turn to roll instead of this. This is fine but your turn to roll is just so good
I really didnt expect to see so many people hating on this. It's so weird. This is my favorite intro. It's so well cordinated and I love how it ties in hints of  the characters to the player.
Gotta say, not the biggest fan of this intro. Rotoscoping works if you want your animation to feel weird/unsettling, other than that there's no reason to use it. The music clearly goes for an epic, dinamic effect, rotoscoping doesn't fit that. Also, instrumentally there are a lot of folk elements to the music, but the animation doesn't have that either. The first C3 intro wasn't very good either because of all the gross close-ups and cheesy slow-mo, but at least it worked with the music. In moments like this I realize that the creative directors aren't actual visual artists but actors. I think they are really good at running the show, but these kinds of creative decisions should be left to professionals.
I actually have this song on my "Random" playlist. Love it
tl;dr this is Art. okayokayokay the more I watch this the more it grows on me. If you look at it as turning live action into cartoon you're looking at it wrong. For me, I first had to get over associating the art style with Anastasia (and how much Marisha looks like Anya??).
This isn't going to be as fun as Your Turn To Roll to sing with a crowd
The other intros are fun, this one just gets me in the feels. Good times!! 😅
Sorry  M9 is hard to top.  This hints at the characters and emphasizes the players and I don't think it's a step in the right direction.
Everyone is shitting on this intro, but where else do you get Travis almost turning into a werewolf? I'll wait.
No matter how many times I listen and watch this intro it gives me chills. I only recently discovered critical roll and I’m going through all the shows and loving it more and more. I’ve never played D&D but I want to play it so much now.
1:30 This is what Jesus coming back would look like
I hard to decide what I like more: 1) Travis constantly yelling 2) Sam’s ginormous gas can drinker 3) Marisha in an intro without sleeves… because she hates sleeves so what was up with the live action intro?
Love it ❤🎉
Woweee!!! Fantastic
I've only seen this twice and I'm into campaign 3 now.   Still...  all the goosepimples. And happy there was a Doctor Who dice roll feel for Matt, if that's what he wanted. Can't get enough of this.   Such a good job.
I love the animation style but the song is a little lacking in my opinion. At least compared to Your Turn to Roll. It just doesn't have the sheer charm of YTtR
It’s all the little touches of their characters that does me in…
I actually think this intro kinda slaps. It probably isn't the best intro the show has ever had, but I like it! It's fun to see totally different styles with each new intro
It's just incredible. This gave me goosebumps
The live action is fun but honestly… I like the animated better  Might just be me though
I actually love this animation style. I love how it puts emphasis on the actual people but still has little hints of their characters. The animation style is very different from the anime or cartoon action style of the mighty nein intro, but this style is very pretty and very smooth in the transitions. The lean toward realistic makes the references to the characters look like they are actually there. For example, the vine going down liam's arm is just as detailed as he his. The shadowing just makes it all come together. Add in the amazing song, and this intro is wonderful. 😊
we need more Taliesin and Liam singing
This might be my favourite intro. Very original. It also has a sort of bitter-sweet untertone to it which is very enjoyable. They did a great job!
The Lyrics, the sound, the  transistioning simply amazing.
I've been behind big time. Currently on EP 24 C3. While EP 40 I'd out.  But I listen to x2 speed. I didn't notice it was this slow. I thought they made a dance song the whole time haha.
Personally, it's giving uncanny valley vibes. I do think the idea is very cool, it just... gives me the ick. Everyone face is just....a little off. I do believe this was the best way of trying to incorporate the idea of the characters and the players being two different entities that are merging into one.
Gonna be honest, we need more emphase on the actual characters. Your Turn to role was by far the best opening you guys had up until now. If u wanna incorporate the actual people behind the characters more, u should go with something similar as the opening for the first campaign with u guys in costume (maybe the cast animated like these but with the actual clothing and themes of the characters). The song is pretty lackluster too, sry.  Just my personal opinion. Loving the campaign and love u guys ;D.
God, what I wouldn't give to have a close group of friends who a passion for story telling like this. I'd LOVE to play DnD on this level with people who get into it.
Love this!
NO ME GUSTA
I like the song but not a huge fan of the scanner darkly animation
Make an animated intro please. This sucks.
It's incredible how much this intro grown up to me. It turned to be one of my favorites and really love it now!!! The music is just perfect
The way they animates the actual people reminds me so much of Waking Life.  I'm pretty sure they filmed all of this and then painted over each cell - at least that's how they did Waking Life.
Nothing will quite compare to M9's animated intro sadly.
The animation is so good GREAT JOB 💝💕💕🧡✨✨ 0:16
I love this so much but I do miss Laura Bailey and Ashley belting out beautiful lyrics.
I adore critical Role and pretty much everything they make... but this intro is extremely unsettling. It's wayyy too far into the uncanny valley. I honestly would've prefered another Mighty Nein style animated intro with all of the characters (Although I'm sure something like that is expensive to make). It's just the eyes... the eyes
Both intros are bomb!!
the other intros felt like they were celebrating the characters and this one feels like they are celebrating themselves
This one is certainly an acquired taste but once it settles, its so fucking amazing
siiiiick i love it!! epic
Well one things for sure, they instantly dated it with that style.
Chills
This is what you get when nerds have too much money
Half a year later, I still hate this intro…
I know it isn't as good as the Mighty Nein intro, and I don't like it as much as the first C3 intro. However, this intro isn't bad by any means and doesn't deserve the harsh slander it has received
Idk I think this ones cute
The start kinda reminds me of the doctor who time travel tunnel
This song is so cheesy 🤣
the roto AI is strong with this one.
This is the dopest intro thus far. I have to say every time yall make a new one, it blows the others out of the park. Can't wait to see what the next will look like..
I would have work some more on it...  Some stuff look great, but it seem unfinished.  I still prefer the campaign 2 intro, but it also needed just a tiny bit of frame adjustment with the music to be perfect !  Update: I've watch it quite a few time, and I think the music track is perfect(That said, I discovered with subtitle that I heard "it the d9' instead of "it thursday night", and "d9" when he said "he might" lol) .  The visual idea is great as well, but it doesn't fully match with the music at a lot of time.  Where it worked perfectly and connect to the music is the sword swing from Ashley, the camera movement look great, petal look great.  I also like when Liam grab the sword (ok I guess I like sword), the white out effect really help sell it out, but I just wish we stay a tiny bit more on his face.  When Laura jump at the begining also felt kinda ok, but was not super interesting there.  But Ashley is on top here, including her acting, her eye position and the camera movement.  I complain alot, but I think it still good enough ;)
As a choir nerd this intro song is the best, however the animation of the season 2 into cannot be topped
As someone that only gets to listen to the podcast version, that was everything I wanted it to be.
I'm saying it here I love Sam's charaters and the fact that all the campaigns is set in the same world
C3 was my first campaign (I've now finished C1 and half of C2) so this song wil always be special to me, even though it seems like it's not everyone's fave. Hearing "it's thursday night" always makes me happy, especially during a really hard year.
I think this opening just needs that "UMPH" feeling... In the M9 opening there was more energy and intensity. This one kinda lacks it, but it's still a good one. Definetly getting shivers when the chorus strikes! 😄
Meh. I liked the animated one better but hey more Crit Roll is more Crit Roll.
The animation i stunning <3
how ever did the animation is amazing and i will give masive propers to do i imaged to be just like this! so ty and hi to all the critters out there!
Favorite version
I really don't care for this...I loved the live action intro, the theme was a bit jarring...Going from victorian explorers in the jungle to high fantasy dnd. BUT It was good!  This compared to the previous and the final C2 intro seems like a step backwards.
I tell you what, the Oxventurers Guild is my fave, but I'll be danged if this song doesn't slap so hard my twin brother felt it and he hadn't even heard it yet
Tbh I find myself playing this intro more than C2’s. But C2 is my favorite. Idk— I just really like this one to replay.
Being in my 50s and playing DND I was harassed by kids. This intro makes me cry every time I watch it. It is a beautiful intro. Thank you all for making it cool to play for the first time for everyone.
Oooh I love this
This is  ... this is just .. FREAKING AWESOME!!!
I reaally like this one !
I LOOOOOVE this style of animation! Originally I wasn't sold on the song by itself but seeing it with the animation has changed my mind, idk it's just nice to see the real actors in the opening instead of the characters
Anyone else cried? No? Was it just me? :D
This song slaps!
Isuuus?
Holy fuck, you guys really outdo yourselves each time you drop a new intro sequence!!! This looks absolutely incredible!!!
This intro was cool.
This is the perfect blend of cheesy and badass.
it's meh for me. Not beautiful, sorry
It’s good, just not my favourite
Am I crazy for not being able to figure out what the white structure on the cliff is right at the beginning? It’s so fast and I just can’t make it out
I can’t tell if that’s Travis or Sam singing .. the part right before Liam and Matt 😭😭
For whatever reason, maybe "it's Thursday night" I love this intro and it has me singing each Thursday night when it plays. It really sets up the mood.
I might not love the visuals(They're fine, just not my favorite) but I FUCKING LOVE the song
I really hope this song to be forgotten in the next campaign. I am sitting out S3 because the story (and specially the characters) got me so sideways that became unwatchable. But I do miss CR and I hope they go back to their top tier content when this season is done. Hopefully, with their old song.
I wasn't sure about this intro the first time I saw it, but it gets better every time I see it and now I'm pretty attached to it
i love the little nods to their characters. it makes me so happy lmao.
Dang Dorian was just a flashback now :/ (I'm not caught up no spoilers if something happens to him)
I like this
I love Thursday night but I will say this intro, idk it it's the colors the movements or both but it makes me kind of sick, like I can't watch it without feeling dizzy and disoriented.
I was singing this all day but I couldn't remember where it came from (I'm finishing S2 right now).  Then I searched "It's Thursday Night" and this came out.  I maybe listened to it twice at best, but it's already stuck in my head forever.
This song is terrible
I love the glimpse of Chetney's chisel in Travis hand. There are so many tiny nods to their characters.
I gotta thank you guys for this song. I bring kids to an after school program and play this for them. They are TRANSFIXED by the song and the animation! (And also probably Matt's GLORIOUS hair!)
Got to love all the ppl complaining/comparing C2 intro to this one while ignoring how C2 intro was made at episode 43(?) of C2
kind of cringe :(
"Two by two we fall" That came true for Orym and Fearne.
I gotta say, not a fan. It's artistically impressive but the art style is too "uncanny valley" and makes me actively not want to see it again. If this is common in future episodes (yes I'm playing catch up!) then I'll probably skip these.  To me, the best intro was Your turn to roll because:  * it was designed to sync with the music. This intro is sloppy in places  * it was about the characters, not the players. I love all the cast but I'm here for the story and the characters * the art style matched the fantasy, whereas here it clashes hard with real people being shown * Your turn to roll made it look like a coherent group with the same goals. Here it looks like a group of independent people all just doing their own thing, and the focus on showing mad screaming and exhiliration is actually off-putting.  Did you do panel testing of this by any chance? I would have thought a properly conducted test with a proportionate probability sample would have shown these problems.
Looks like the Doctor Who intro 😂
IS IT THURSDAY NIGHT YET????????
this sucks
To me, this show is as much about the players gaming as it is about the story they're roleplaying. In that sense, I feel that this intro reflects that far better than the beloved animated intro, which was beautiful, but could just as easily have been the intro to a cartoon series like LoVM.
M9 animated is my favourite BUT this comes So.Close to beating it. It really captures the joy of the game and how much fun these people have playing it.
okay NOW its as awesome as "Your Turn To Roll"
what the hell is everyones problem with this opening????? i think it encapsulates what DND is- you're PLAYING a character. but underneath it its YOU. the players helped create the story so why not make an intro with the players faces?????
Looks like people like the first C3 Intro more, from the Likes and Dislikes. There was too much going on in this one to enjoy the animation. I enjoyed the first C3 as well.
If they update the intro, they should make Ruidus in the opening shine a bit more
LOVE IT
I feel so torn about the current season as something just is lacking from it compared to the last 2. Maybe part of it is that now being as big as they are and CR being more business then pleasure what once made a bunch of nerdy a** voice actors sitting around playing Dungeons and Dragons is just now business partners putting on a show. It feels like CR is trying so hard now to make everything so over the top that the core of what made is special is not there anymore.  I still like the CR crew and Mercer is still a great DM, but the characters were so bland or trying to hard. I will admit I took some time off around episode 6 and came back hoping that a break would help get me back into the current campaign. It did not, each episode I watched felt like a chore, or personal punishment. I finished watching episode 15 and had to stop. Nothing was really going anywhere still, characters were being way to open and trusting, heck I rather watch them shop at Gilmore's Glorious goods for 3-4 hours then the 15 episodes I watched.  I stopped caring about spoilers and seems like potential character death/s happened around episode 33. At this point it's be a while, but I might have to wait til campaign 4 to see if the next set of character and story will be more intriguing. Of course, it might also be me and I've moved on from the livestream D&D type content. Guess time will tell.
Your turn to roll still remains my favorite, but by god do i get goosebumps on that sword transition. I cannot figure out why that it is. Is it the sudden epic music transition, is it the hawk in the background, is it Liam's triumphant look when he grabs the sword, is it Marisha's powerful presence that kinda brings a finale to it all ... i really can't pinpoint it, but it's bone tingling awesome
I liked to other one better. Where they were explorers.  You will never beat campaign 2 animated intro.  Everything you do is great.   Matt.  Please try not to kill the characters, for some of us they are the only friends that we have.
Beautiful intro 😳😊🤩
so I listen to the podcast and only watch maybe 3 or 4 episodes a campaign, and the opening to this with the "its Thursday, its Thursday" is so great, which is something teased from the first episode of the podcast (at least now it is)
I really like this theme. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Your Turn To Roll is great, too. Both opening for C3 are fun! Keep doing your thing
I prefer seeing the characters than the cast itself, thats my opinion. At least was better than the first one.
after hearing the Take on me version on tiktok i can’t unhear it 😂😂😂
This comments section is a perfect picture as to what's wrong with the fanbase, think I'll just head back to campaign 1.
Best is C1 cosplay.
Bout time... I am still waiting for my turn to roll. Thank you
I think I would like this intro more if it was a fluid fps. I understand  it is an an artistic choice, and it’s purposeful, but to me it the way it’s executed makes it seem like it isn’t intentional, and that the video just isn’t buffering properly.
I’m not sure how to feel about C3s opening. I understand they’re going for a different vibe but I really don’t think anything can beat C2’s opening
LOVE IT!
Don’t mind me crying over here!! This is so cool!! I love both intros lol
My problem with this intro is that it doesn't really feel like something that a group of D&D players would make - it feels like something a company would make. I mean, as a D&D player myself, I personally would love to see an animation of my character rather than myself. It feels like a generic Critical Role opening rather than a Critical Role Campaign 3 Bell's Hells opening.
Love the transition from Liam to Marisha! Great way to acknowledge the connection between two of their characters. 😊
This is pretty bad, compared to their other stuff. Changing their first intro with a pretty rushed rotoscope piece just because some random TwitterTwats cried “offensive” is a rather unnecessary change that will only serve to give power to people who will moan and cry about anything you show them. I enjoy CR but thief need to put their foot down in regards to creative decisions that they are much more capable of making
The word "animated" in this intro is very loose i see. Its just rotoscope.. After seeing the animated show on amazon this is a let down.
i honestly miss the mighty neins intro. this just cant top it
This intro is good. At first I didnt like the song, now I find myself singing along to it every time.
After the most recent episode I think they’ll need to change this 😂
I'm not even on C3 yet but this opening has me in tears of joy. It sparks so much emotion. Love it
best intro ever!
Half animated Sam can't hurt me.. he isn't real... right?
I really wish they kept Your Turn to Roll.
gonna bring some much needed positivity to this comment section and say i think this intro is very cool and seeing the actors in animated form is dope
This is pretty bad
yikes
You know what? It's grown on me
That oil tank is what I am for here
this is bad, plain and simple
Damn, now I wish my group of players had an epic opening title when entering my flat for a game !
Straight up garbage. Go back to the other one.
Is it just me, or does Travis sound EXACTLY like Liam in the song?
Is there a BTS video or does anyone know specifically how this was made?
Welp, there you go. Shapes and bright colours. Hope you're happy. Hope you won't have anything to be offended with this one because this is what we're stuck with now.
I really love that each intro for Critical Role has been unique in their own ways.  The original intro for campaign 1, the low budget cosplay intro. It felt like a bunch of kids that used their pocket money to be able to buy some props to cosplay as their PCs. The second intro for campaign 1, the high budget cosplay intro. It felt like a bunch of full time cosplayers that have the time, money and resources to be able to create cosplays of their PCs. The original intro for campaign 2, the funky 80s romp intro. It invoked the image of a bunch of friends in the 80s heading over to their friend's place to play D&D and have fun regardless of background. The second intro for campaign 2, the legendary animated intro. It really showed the viewers the world and who the PCs are, giving us hints of their backstories, their adventures and what they could face in the future. The updated second intro for campaign 2, just a more grander version of the animated intro. It added details to the already legendary intro. The Exandria Unlimited intro, shows off these beautiful landscapes and stained glass windows that depict locations and significant events in Exandria. The original intro for campaign 3, the explorers intro. It showed the players and DM exploring this temple, a stand in for the world, dressed as stereotypical 19th-early 20th century explorers' gear. And now the second intro for campaign 3, the rotoscoped intro. It blends the fantastical world with the animation with the real world players by animating over their actions.  All of them are unique in their own ways yet still feel distinctly Critical Role. Sure some will be more loved than others (everybody will absolutely love the animated intro and the updated animated intro), but you can't say they are bad. They all do their job and do them well. A lot of work would've had to go into each one, and we must accept that.  All that said, I look forward to see this intro more, though I do need to catch back up due to IRL obligations, and I look forward to what they end up making for the next intro, as given their track record, it will be unique and exciting.  Edit: fixed a typo that completely changed the meaning of a sentence.
😍🌟💫😍
I think this one is fantastic.
Eh... I appreciate the effort, but the live action was better. And nothing beats Mighty Nein yet.  For context, I LIVED to hear, "Roll. Critical." And played the theme every episode. This... skip. The live action version was the best, and it made me happy. This? Totally skip.
I still haven't started c3 but I'm in love with the intro!!! Everything about the song is amazing! From the fact that everyone has a part to the lyrics itself. It's such serotonin boost for me^^ I also love the style of the animation and how is the cast not the characters. It feels new and fits the song really well!
I started as a DM about a month ago, this really pumps me up!
Was surprised to see the reaction in the comments, I loved this one. Just looks beautiful.  I've loved all of them so far and I'd have various ones with different styles like how they've done it so far rather than a single one/style
This is beautiful
We need CR the Musical
Damn, so much negativity in the comments, kinda shocked these are critters. Shame.
Love the show, hate the intro's XD There was only one that was visually okay and it was animated intro from M9. When it comes to songs they all suck LOL
+1 for making the next intro like the C2 anime-style opening with the characters rather than the cast. This one is also interesting, but after the C2 intro, everything is just... underwhelming, even if it is "not bad" or "good".
campaign 3 is my least favorite campaign so far, but golly gosh, the cast and creative team of Critical Role never cease to amaze me. This animation is really cool.
What a Banger . the violin and change of keys make it so epic.
I definitely want to hear more of Liam and Travis for any future tracks. They sound fantastic.
After rewatching it, I think it need a need soundtrack.
I wish they'd done another animated character intro. I wanna see Imogen blow shit up with lightning, Laudna transform into her form of dread, Chetney ripping his skin off to turn into a werewolf, Fearne telling Mister to throw a glob of fiery poop, I dunno, there's a lot of potential here.  The song is perfect tho. Sam Riegel is so fucking talented.
Oof.
far be it from me to criticize for nothing, but I find this opening bad, especially compared to the others, these kindly show the players more than the persones, but here, I absolutely cannot say who he is fighting against, and especially who is playing what, their characters are so badly presented that I have NO idea of the race/class.  and the acting at 0:53, these .... really special have you going to say  finally I find the music much less catchy than the first
im new please teach me oh faithful ones
This comment section shows how much people just complain about everything. Just skip the intro if you dislike it and move on.
old video for this song was better
Cheap!
I'm wondering if I'm legit the only person who thinks the 80's intro for C2 was the best one. It gave off the air of a bunch of friends sitting down and having fun. This just feels so... overdone.
I'm having the crawliest goosebumps I have had in YEARS!
Might be me, but the bright rainbow colours everywhere distracted me a lot from the action and tiny character details that are in it. (I missed many and only found out when reading comments).  The style is not really my thing, but beautifully made though, details on the faces is amazing.
"OwlBear-Man is myth! Meant to frighten the cowardly and superstitious."
This is absolutely “we need to market ourselves, not the characters” energy
❤️
I like WHAT I saw in this trailer but not HOW. I feel dizzy while watching. This trailer would be 100% better if they choose other art style more cartoonish bc this filter like animation is really confuze my brain and hard to watch even as I sad love the details and alls.
Travis is the best. Change my mind. Cheers!
As an aspiring artist this intro nearly made me cry, it's stunning
Now that’s fucking cool!!!!!
I have to say the song itself never grew on me. As much as I hate to say this because I am sure a lot of work and thought went into making it. But I would rather just not listen to it at all it sounds terrible atleast to me personally. I am probably in a very small minority here when I say I liked campaign ones non-vocal intro song still the most. The Grog scream at the beginning always meant let´s go it´s time for Critical Role. I understand that most people prefer lyrics to sing along and I am certainly not against lyrics but neither "Your Turn To Role" nor "It´s Thursday Night" ever captured the same feeling that the C1 intro gave me. Both the C2 and C3 opening feel more like "Yeah let´s play a fun, silly game together and laugh" rather than "You are going on an epic quest to save the world, fight monsters and other dangers".  Oh yeah and the video itself is nice. People are quite harsh in the comments but I think it´s fine. Also a lot of people have no idea how much effort actually goes into making any kind of animated product and the whole "controversy" about the old intro is bullshit anyways. Fucking terrible woke culture. I bet not a single person who actually belongs to the apparently offended group was actually offended by it. All just idiots who think they need to get offended on other peoples behalfs.
I’m never going to find my own dnd party am I?
i somehow really like this one.
Can we please have an animated campaign!!!?
I love it.
Honestly, not a fan of the song and haven’t liked either version of the intro. I get that not everything is gonna slap but it’s a bit disappointing after the incredible c1 and c2 intros. This felt very… Disney channel…
We as a community don't talk about Liam's singing enough. I love it I always get chills and it makes me want to restart the whole thing.
Looks like CR has had some budget cuts in the animation department. Pretty sad that there's no properly animated intro this campaign
There's a rescore of this to Aha's Take on Me running around tiktok that is ridiculously fitting.
Ok, that's epic.
This one is better than the first intro but not as great as the classic animated ones, imo. HD slow motion closeups of people making weird faces is not the way to go.
I'm sorry, this sounds like a Eurovision song xDD
So is it true that the previous one was accused of racism? Because if it's so, that's absolutely ridiculous.
All I have learnt from comments on this is people have real difficulty with their eyes.... I mean it looks fine... you are all far too used to 60fps
I love how it feels like it's also referencing the other Campaigns they played
It's uh, I'm trying to be polite, but it's not good. It literally looks like they took 20 steps back from the campaign 2 one. Art style is one thing and up to personal taste. But this looks choppy and just rough overall. And why are they not doing one with their characters? Much better. We all know what the players look like and what DnD is, seeing the characters and the setting of the game would make for a much better intro IMO.
You're high if you don't like this!!
Wish Robby was apart of the official gang. But I did hear him in the back
Yo! Marisha with the epicest of entrances.
i dont like it too much like a scanner darkly
Such a fan of C3 song.
I actually got the chills. Those harmonies!?!??!?
This has a very rushed feel to it and the rotoscoping is very uncanny. Just has a very "wrong" feel to it, personally preferred the prior live action intro and ofc the old Mighty Nein animated intro.
This show is just getting commercialized and predictable. This campaigns only saving grace is chutney
I don’t care if it’s an unpopular opinion; this intro is amazing. I was absolutely floored. Excellent work! ❤️
You just know Travis was stoked to get a werewolf scene! Great intro as always!
The more I watch it, the more I like it. It has so much to it that is amazing!
EPIC!
I'm so sad to say that this is the first opening I'm truly underwhelmed by.  The rotoscoping was an interesting choice.  It feels a little uncanny valley to me.  And the pacing was just way off.  Like, why wouldn't you make Matt's book snapping line up with the end of the crescendo?  It would have been so perfect!
This is ok, but the other is better.
1:07  Look how bad this looks, seriously guys come on.
Omg ! Loved it so much
GAWD DAMN
Song doesn't fit at all. Saw someone put this to Take on Me by A Ha and fits wayyyyy better
It always amazes me how they managed to turn thrusday into their brand. Thursday night is synonymous with critical role for so many fans. And i heard the reason they had to stop doing it live was because people had scheduling conflicts, which is funny that even this most famous show has that same problem every single home game does.
A lot of people are saying "This is bad compared to the previous intros" they are wrong, it's just bad in general. The animation style is just awful.
The intro is a thousand times better woth dear maria the music doesnt match
And this is your brain on D&D... and well acid
im sorry but this looks so creepy and weird to me. mostly just their eyes.
I just realized on this rewatch (I keep trying to love it… I’m not sure it’s working) there are a BUNCH on nods back to their campaign 1 characters. Travis in the Strongjaw Ale and VM shirts, you can see Liam’s raven tattoo really well, and then when he casts gust it blow’s Marisha’s hair and she smiles, the rock Tal hits is residuum (I think), I probably missed more. I think it’s maybe pointing out how closely C3 is connected to C1? (Though we’re starting to get more nods to C2 now too.)
I absolutely love Matt as "Goofy Jesus"
I like the idea of this, but the beats and transitions just don't match the flow of the song... I think it needs better syncing/editing, but overall, nicely done
ngl its cool to see elements of their charcters come through in each indiviual cast members parts
I appreciate the effort of this intro, at the same time tho, I prefer the live action one, and I very much prefer a purely animated one.  I heard there was backlash over the theme of the live action one, which is just a very dumb thing to get offended by in the 21st century.
Man just add the characters. Before an episode we need to visualize the characters, not the players who we'll be looking at for the entire 4hrs. Makes this feel narcissistic.
This is so fun! Love that its drop also pretty much lines up with the group leaving Jrusar for the moment.
I think the video was more hardcore than the tempo of the music.
I think everyone here needs to know that this video lines up amazingly well with the first 2 minutes of “Take On Me” by a-ha.
so are they asking Joel haver to come in as a guest or is it just my imagination?
I love the song I love the animation I'm sure  the animators did such a amazing job on it and yet for me personally it feels uncanny valley maybe we'll go away after I see it enough let me know if anyone else has this issue
Still love the song but the frame rate of this is REALLY janky. When I first saw it, I thought my phone was glitching out and rebooted it. Turns out, no, capping out at 5 frames per second was a stylistic choice. Also, its kinda all over the place. Why is Laura just hopping on blocks and Sam is just surfing on Liam's sword? All the other cast members got something to link back to their characters but those two are just doing random stuff.
while i enjoy the intro as is, the reasoning behind the change should not be the case  I mean crit role has gone through many changes: home game to internet show to cultural standard they dropped tiberius in game which then erased him via their tv series lore  I think the great concern is when fan input becomes canon, they humored it with Imogen getting glasses, but i wont be surprised if she eventually does  I recall there was a one shot they did involving a wendy's setting and they deleted it over some 'ingredients' being lesser races  Critical role is a great culture for fans young and old, but when it becomes too malleable to the point the owners and creators can't recognize their work, does it still retain the roots it started with?
I hope there’s a “making of” video for this coming soon.
[ groovy Critical Role theme ] was my favorite
From :53 to :58 has a really awkward cut in the middle of it, not really sure why and it's been really bugging me.
I like this! Kinda looks like a video game. I liked the live action opening too, not quite sure why it changed so quickly?
i think the video is fine but the music dosnt fit as well as it did with the last one
Its amazing how animation can make everything but Sam's teeth look bigger than they are (Love you Brian)
Anyone else getting "Lord of the Rings"-1978 vibes? That rotoscope look always takes me back.
Be a real shame if someone dies (looking at chetney)
So many chills but the tears quickly came at 1) Liam's Orym moves and 2) Matt's fleet of NPCs plus Bertrand and Dorian. The creativity and attention to detail is incredible! You can see the subtleties that makes each player and each character themselves. I love this!
0:26 Nice
They truly missed an opportunity to create clips for guests in the previous intro
I really like this, especially in comparison to the last one. That one was just rough. No connection to anything they've done in the campaign. Yes, they've started slightly exploring jungles now but that early 1900s aesthetic is a lot more Call of Cthulhu or The Mummy than this high-fantasy DnD world. I just don't understand that artisitc choice at all.
Honestly... i like the real live version of S3 over this semi animated one...  just feels idk... forced?  Like S1 80s splash art combined into a video open.  But S3 music is pretty good!  But i agree... I dont think anything will beat the S2 M9 open though.  That one was the best.
This grew on me! The song still gives me goosebumps regardless
This intro is not my favorite it seems like it was done quickly and cheaply because I can do most of this with instagram filters I expected more from from the most popular dnd show on 2 platforms. I am hopeful the next one will be awesome of ridiculous as those seem to be the casts jam.
I think the Chetney reference in Travis's segment is very fun, but I think Ashley's is my favorite.
Everytime I hear/see a new CR intro, I get so emotional. Hell, even the fan art gets to me, in the best of ways. From being a group of people who voiced characters that I grew up with, and seeing all of them be themselves, and loving each other, to creating and supporting a familial community who supports one another. Seeing Matt and Marisha get married, Laura and Travis having a wonderful super child, and Ashley full timing with the group. Being introduced to CR was one of the greatest things to happen in my life. I love all of you 💜
Trying something new and interesting and I think it's awesome!
I love the song
Don’t get me wrong I love critical role! But….. this made me feel slightly uncomfortable
I actually really like the opening The rotoscoping combined with the sort of.. choppy feeling is kind of cool. It reminds me of old school claymation and has a cool /art/ filter that reminds me of a version of cell shading. I like that they're diverging from characters to the actual players again, showcasing the people that come to the table and are making all of this possible for us to consume (content). This all reminds me of a very VERY 90s style of art too in a way that makes me sooo happy to see in nostalgia. There's also a very cute video game feeling with the set floating and everybody being super giddy and celebratory.  Everybody has a little flair closer to their characters and how they play those characters. I love how the player embodies the character throughout this. It's nice to see a throwback to one of the original cosplay animations but in a fun twist.
People are always going to hate what they didn't start with. I think this is wonderfully done. Rotoscoping is incredibly taxing!
I love it!!! It's gorgeous. It's fun. It's COOL! And it's a bop 👀
That's dope
Love it
Is this whole thing a vehicle for Travis to turn into a werewolf?
Kinda meh, the song doesn't fit, the art looks awkward, and it doesn't fit the setting like the first did.
Dont hold back! Travis should go full wolf, Marisha should turn into a nightmare creature.  Then sync the sound and maybe think about different lyrics. They worked great with the other Intro, here Not sure
I... don't know? The animation style is nice, and all, but it looks choppy at times, and uncanny valley. Most cast members have something related to their characters in their bit, and then there's Sam who pulls his bottle joke again, and then slides around on Oryms sword, no "hint" to FCG in his bit.
I do like the previous one more because of the sheer joy expressed, but I love the sense of magic and imagination in this one.
this amazing idk what ur talking about also travis is god dam cool
I personally love this animation.  It’s the song that’s always bothered me.
Woah! They animated Taliesin’s tremor! Incredible detail! AMAZING!!
love this intro, animation reminds me of Delta State
Okay now make one where each cast member has equal time dedicated to them in the intro
struggling to find something to like about this one 🫤. First like 7 seconds are fine… the laggy “A Scanner Darkly” animations of people really feel uncomfortable.
I sat with nothing less than an absolute smile on my face while watching this and wishing I could be a part of it.... this entire crew is fantastic and constantly re-inventing how they entertain the community. Much Love from Ohio.
Embarassing and self pandering. Yikesss.
Man...this is bad. Has nothing to do with the characters and more so about the Brand of Critical Role...which is becoming more and more corporate
rotoscope for the WIN! So fun, would love to se some bts.
Maybe I should use this song to remind my grandma when it’s Thursday because that’s also the day she takes her weekly diabetes medicine. (Knowing it’s the same day as CR already helps me remind her lol)
I LOVE this!
Don't mind the critics, I love the new intro: The little connections to your characters, the pastel colors... Just great! Thank you for your work, you're all amazing 😁
Aww man, that was beautiful!
They will never top the campaign 1 cosplay intro.
I enjoy it more at speed 2x
Glad I'm not alone in my opinion, after looking at the comments.
A bit disappointed. I will probably run the old intro as a video in the background whenever the new one plays. feel like the music doesnt fit the animation in the new one :(
Missing the previous live action version of the intro! Always thought it would be cool to see the cast actually singing their parts, though! Maybe in the next iteration?!
Aww I thought this was gonna be a new show.
to me looks underwhelming. I prefer all previous intros.
The coloring and scene work makes my head spin. It's really trippy and I cannot say I like it. I am also not a big fan of the song, which in my mind lacks the punch of a theme song and sounds a bit too auto tuny. I love you guys but this intro just isn't for me and I'd find it quirky even in S1. It's by far the least favorite of mine and probably the first ever intro here I will be actually skipping.
I think the Intro is good, but I do feel like there are some pacing problems and lack of hitting the beat of the song that makes me think this was made because of the backlash of the explorer theme in the original. In any case its always cool to see new styles in the intros!
Why would you change the intro it was the best one yet?!
Going to be permanently skipping the intro from now on. When I watched the VOD, the intro made me rather motion sick and I'd prefer not to get motion sick from simply watching an intro to a D&D show. It's a shame too, because I do like the song. Your Turn To Roll is still magnitudes better and will remain my top favourite theme song of all time, but It's Thursday Night is still a bop.
This is awesome :O
They really outdid themselves with Your Turn to Roll. This is still a good song. But season two just slapped you in the face and made you rage with joy when the song came on. By then end of it, we were ALL ready to roll.
Matt looks like D&D white Jesus! 🤣
So badass
I feel like this was all brought on by the Kotaku article. I mean, why change the intro after only 20+ episodes? That said, this intro is pretty cool. I can dig it. I love how they gave the viewer a little insight to their characters (except maybe Sam).
Uhhh change it back
What do people mean with "it's off beat"? I don't get it...
wtf this is awful lmao
I love the art style, but the animation and choreography doesn't seem to sync well with the song.  The final shot of the whole cast to the Critical Role logo especially seems out of sync with the music.  The original intro had better synergy with the transitions and scene changes.  I really wanted them to get Erika to cosplay as another fellow explorer and then have them insert her where Robbie's spot used to be.
This one is good, but i prefer the first one.
Sam drinking out of a jerrycan at 1:01 made me laugh harder than i think it should have
They peaked with the Season 1 original intro. Season 1 is still the only season I have been able to watch to completion.
Ok..... I REEEEEAAAAALLY like this intro!!!!! Like..... REEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!
This one isn't exactly hideous, but the last one was WAY better.
that doctor who inspired opening and ashley channeling yasha 👌🥺
Kind of wish Robbie was still there when this was made. Could you imagine?
This is so damn 90s. I really did love that slo-mo intro though.
very cool, guys. well done. I like the style.
They animated tal’s tremor
I am not sure which one I love more. The animated on or the real life one. Both are really amazing and its very evident that a lot of work has gone into doing both. Do miss Ashley and Laura Going F#@K in the beginning.
I love it its cool
Somehow MORE cheesy than the first.
this opening song never fails to get me teary-eyed. such an epic blast.
Some cool effects but overall just doesn't work for me. What's with Sam's hair at 1:28?? Janky cut at 0:50 too
It's beautiful and a lot of work has gone into it. Rotoscope technic is cool (LOTR animated anyone? :-)  but I prefer the live-action one.
So the piss take  of Take on me on top of this has been taken down I am Furios!!!!!
This intro isn't great. I love the creative branching out but it does not hit - love y'all!
Cute... Just wait... They always come out with something different... That's why we love them🥰
I liked the music and rotoscopy, it looks very clean, better than waking life, A scanner Darkly, Undone, for some reason the color palette reminds me of Shingeki no kyojin - opening 6 :) I loved it.
I prefer "Your turn to roll", but I think this is going to grow until I find myself humming it at random times.
Sadly this one makes me really dizzy and motion sick. It does look pretty cool though.
We love you guys, but honestly we love the characters too, similar to the video for your turn to roll.   I don’t wanna be reminded that I’m just watch a bunch of peeps sitting around a table, I wanna FEEL like I’m in the world and the characters are front and center.
This one honestly makes me physically sick to watch. It doesn't feel very polished. The jittery and glitchy way the cast move and that beginning landscape pan around felt like I was watching it on a very low frame rate with a spotty wifi connection. The galaxy transition after Matt's clap is also painfully low resolution. I would expect it to be pretty smooth in HD but it feels more like a crunchy jpeg and adds to that unpolished, jittery feel. There are moments when the cast glitches back and forth almost as if the animator accidentally shifted them over (Ashley's scene is one of the more  jarring ones 0:30). The goofiest example is at 0:53, Ashley's eyes are literally pointing in opposite directions so you get this uncanny ps1 character model look.   I very much preferred the live action. It felt much more like that it was made for the song. I thought the previous opener also gave way for guests to show up in the beginning and that they would interchange the slot Robbie had with new guests and use Talisen's part as a placeholder if anything. I saw that the original intro could possibly be seen as offensive(?) so I understand if they realized their potential mistake and wanted to replace it as soon as possible (I personally see the offense as reaching, especially since one of two sources I found of it was Kotaku and we know how they write articles, but CR obviously tries to be cognizant of issues around them). This intro feels it was made with the purpose of being as generic as possible and any song could be played over it and have the same feel. I'm not entirely sure what song would fit better with this style opening. I played other songs that are similar to the vibe that this opener appears to be giving but the pacing is odd.   If anything from this opener, I was hoping they'd push the mold with their characters since animation gives you the power to really do anything. Have each of them transform into their characters and we get the full party in the final shot. Instead we get these small nods that are closer to easter eggs. There's not much of FCG in Sam's scene at all except the faintest appearance of gears and that he goes on one leg to represent his one wheel? I wanted to see Laudna be absolutely terrifying and Travis/Chetney really transform into his werewolf form (especially since he tends to be rather vivid in his descriptions when he transforms). If you're an artist, these are the assignments we really get excited for but what was represented here just seemed more lazy than anything.  In summary, I do really enjoy this theme but this opener is very weak due to its weird pacing, lack of creativity, dizzying (and frankly epileptic) animation, and general animation errors. This truly seems more like a realization that some people took offense to the previous opener and they tried to churn out a new opening as quickly as possible to sweep the original under the rug.
Ok that was really cool! I personally like watching this one more than the first one, but that’s just because I felt a little uncomfortable when it would get really close up to them in the live action opening. That one is definitely more stunning, but this one’s easier to watch and I love how it looks!!
It just looks like a paint filter on a recording..
This is giving real Ralph Bakshi vibes, I love it
This was beautifully well done; I love the song and the feeling it gives me. The hype up for the game is real! (We use music before our own sessions) But honestly this one felt disconnected. Like they were trying something to see if it fit but it didn't really feel finished. The colors and transitions are awesome, but I felt the live first one was more in theme with what the story was and where it took place.  There are some cool moments, Travis showing Chet's werewolf must have been his favorite part! But it feels more like a practice run compared to the others. I get it, after the awesome job of M9's intro it is hard to come up with something to top it. Most fans love it and we have a little trouble with change. But I think they will get there, give it a little time.
Absolutely loved this opening. Then again.....who doesn't love a good opening. 😉. Keep up the amazing work team. Xx
Have to say I actually prefer the live intro they were using before. This was pretty but doesn’t really do much.
I love it. I love it. I love it. I don't know if I mentioned this already but I love it. Both intros are pretty bitchin' though. The other one captures the comedy of the cast where this one is a nod to their characters. Essentially the flip side of the same coin. Happy claps!
I think I like the old one better.. when Liam points, and Taliesin punches his palm? Instant joy and goose bumps.
Don’t mind me getting emotional at how happy they all look doing this. They always have so much fun together. It’s wonderful.
Holly shit that was awesome.
I like it
I think this one is so great. I know some aren't fans of it. The live action one before this I thought was fun too, but apparently there may have been some negative feedback about the costumes being related to colonialism or something. I just saw it as like Indiana Jones adventure style. But they worked quick to "fix" it with this new one.
To me this intro fits the show a lot more - had no idea what was up with the live action one, it indicated very little about the actual program except "adventure". This one feels much more intune relaying characters being played, showcasing the actors, all while giving the sensational or imaginative aspects of D&D with the illustration effects used. Much better to me design wise, well done!
This is so FREAKING COOL!!!
I was always a fan of the first openings for each campaign as a look at a bunch of nerds playing DnD.  Then, the second openings came and were legit awesome!  For this one... rotoscoping? Really?  Didn't even seem like really good rotoscoping (if there is such a thing).  I still kind of liked it in parts, but overall, meh.
My god, the comments here are brutal. this intro is very in theme for CR. it works for their production company as they head up their third campaign and represents this company well. I think it’s very lovely and colorful and works for the tone of the show they are running. sorry for all the hate you have to sift through, CR social media team, I think this is an awesome intro.
Hell YES!
Rotoscope was a great call. Fits perfectly, and I love that it calls out to other weird niche things that have used e same technique
I can't believe I'm saying this to a CR intro but, this ain't it chief.   If you guys want to do the full cast intro with no character references, go like the 1st C2 intro.
OK, the game is over. This just slayed reality.
I love this!!! I can’t believe people are criticizing it so much
glad to see rotoscoping get more chances as a form of animation. love the magic  effects as well.
Well, they did it!   C1: Their real selves as their characters. C2: Their characters as their characters. C3: Them as themselves. C4: Their characters as their real selves?  Tune in in 145 sundays to find out!
I love that theyre getting to be artists and do so much. Thank you to everyone on the CR team for everything you do. it means the world to me.
To everyone saying they prefer the "charm" of the live-action intro, please know that the explorer aesthetic is based on imperialist and racist colonialism. As a person of color who enjoys Critical Role, I much prefer this new intro.
that was cool
This is like the new Magic card art, and I imagine the response will be similar. Old intro was great, and they could do the Power Rangers thing of adding the current guest in to where Robbie was, to give them some love.
First one was amazing, this one is amazing. It's all amazing.
I just.. I just can't. I wanna like it, I really do.. But for me it passes that "charmingly cringey" line that season 2s retro live action intro had by a fair few miles... Also, I get that the players are now super famous for doing Crit Role, but it's the characters they play as that brings me back to watch more.. This intro doesn't seem to teach or show anything about their characters to new viewers. Compared to season 2s animated visual perfection (which achieved showing so much about each character in so little time) and the musical genius of Sam's D&D Beyond jingle, it falls way short for me... Sorry guys... I don't want my face to scrunch up when I watch it... But it does..
Taliesin's section is fucking clean.
It's amazing, but nothing will ever top Travis's slo-mo, terrified, hair-flopping reaction to Marisha. My wife and I laughed out loud at that part every single time!
i wish i had the time to watch like it did in campaign 1
Has anyone else noticed that they’re subtly referencing their C2 characters before introducing the visuals for their C3 character???!!
Something must be wrong with me because I got teary eyed😅 I love this
Overall it's really cool but in my opinion Matt's shots don't do the man justice. His slowmo scream in the previous intro was just so cool!! I would have loved to see that animated like this.
I feel like we’re going to get another song soon, only because the intro animations don’t add up to the sound cues they seem to want to hit. Which is sad if true because I would kill for them to karaoke this at a live show.
I know it’s not the community’s favorite, but I just can’t help but smile due to the fact it’s rotoscoped. Adventure Awaits, HUZAHHHH!
animated representation of player's characters is much cooler because it reminds you of the game you are about to watch
Oh man that was fire!
But guys, how about we just enjoy it? :)
liking it a lot! But I like the animated one better I'm sorry ><.
I prefer the Live Action S3 Intro...by A LOT
I think the best way to sum up my thoughts on this is that we all appreciate the hard work and effort the artists put into making this and it is a nice piece of art. However, the animation really does not match either the song or the vibe of the campaign, and struggles a lot because of it. While we appreciate the effort put into this, it is quite week. Keep up the great content though.
This is some LOTR 1978 rotoscoping uncanny monstrosity. Traditonal animation is just plain better. Critters want that please.
Why can ALL of them sing?! It doesn't seem fair lol. What are the chances of all of them having just insane voices like this?
Fuvk, Marisha is … amazing.
I don't like this one, honestly. The previous one had so much more heart in it, and while it looked cheesy, it was in a wholesome way, so I enjoyed watching it; each frame seemed to match the song, too. This one feels clunky, and it looks artificial (which anything animated is, technically, but not all -look it-, if you know what I mean). It's sad that the new opening is so... skippable.
Face it. Feeling the need to redo the intro is just a KowTow to woke hate driven insanity.
how can all of them have a good singing voice?? like, HOW??? IS THIS THE MAGIC OF BEING A VOICE ACTOR?
Loved this but loved the live action more I think made more sense with the music
My dudes, you should’ve taken the money for this into and give it to Brennan to DM another calamity.
It's not a bad animation, Rotoscope always has a very distinct and interesting look and feel to it, but I honestly don't like it compared to the original, live-action intro they had.
I got Chills...
Hmm…I miss the old one 😔
Anyone shows why changed?
CR first miss. 😢 pretty bland.
Is rotoscoping animation? I feel like most of it was a filter, when it's done by hand like snow-white and stylized it's KILLERRRRR, I think this probably took a while but for the most part it's not really an animated intro?
Audio is rubish
ooooffff!!!! another epic one! tbh all of crit's opening sequence are amazing!!!
i think i still like the the live action one more but i really appreciate the rotoscope on this
Different vibe, cool style of animation. Not a fan of the song tbh.
I prefer the old intro, this one is cool but there was just something missing.
Ngl this feels like a vr experience.
This may just be one of the most beautiful things ive seen
It's cool as a placeholder title, being semi-animated, but I also hope they do a fully animated one w the characters like the D&D Beyond or CR2 intro. I also love the Your Turn To Roll, but this song is good too.
I saw a version of this with Aha's Take On Me for the audio and it blew my mind.
To people comparing this to C2 animated opening: Its Ok to have favorites, but its important for a business to change, even if you don't realize it. I also love the Your Turn to Roll song, but the "It's Thursday Night" catchphrase is genious from a business standpoint. 100% the right move from them.
The focus is where it should be, on the players, not the characters.  Well done.
All I can think of is this opening but to A-Ha's Take on me.
I love the detail of Pâté hanging from Marisha's chair.
I love it! I was hyperventilating notices all the little character details!!
Werewolf Travis is the best!
I think people are being a little harsh on this theme tbh
😭😭😭😍
Connect with Corridor Digital and colab on an intro. It'd be great for both channels.
The song is dope and the animation was not what I was expecting which just makes it better
C3 opening  < c4 opening < c4 opening animated
I'ma be real, I hate it. It's got a forced attachment with the players to characters.   Why don't we ever get a character intro, we all know who the players are. Show us stats, level up progression, stuff like that.
Argh, I am so torn about this. This new animation is super cool and I kind of want to see it again, but I also really love the live action version and might actually prefer that just slightly. Please tell me you're going to switch them every once in while.
I love the idea but the editing seems a bit off ? There are cuts within the actions and it feels choppy at times. Other than that, lots of real good stuff (Ashley's entrance is amazing, and the Liam-Marisha part is awesome)
The time and effort that has gone into this should be praised.  I will not say its a "Bad" intro because it isn't on its own.  But for me it falls short of the Live Action one.  The Live action mixed both the sense of adventure and the gaming aspect which really brought home what CR is about.  Seeing the gangs faces as each of them sung their part was always a delight and of course it was timed as such.  The timing here just isn't right and throws it out of wack.  That's just my two cents and I don't expect that to change anything...and it shouldn't.  Always remember.... You can't please everyone and trying to can do way more harm than good.  It's OK to stick to your guns and tell people..."No, I'm sorry you feel that way but I'm not going to change just because your feelings were hurt."
While I don't have anything against c3 song or intro itself, Legends of Vox Machina and animated M9 intro's were along with DnDBeyond animated intro (I think all three were done by same people too) were far better than anything they show in c3 so far.
This song still irks me. Does not have any character. It flows all over the place. Needs more *oomph* Rock and roll. C2 M9's Intro. Both of them are it. This song, nah.... skip it every time it comes on.
The other intro to camp 3 WAS 200% better! Very unfortunate change - means I will just skip it really. Waste of time.
It's nice and all, but personally, I want to see their animated charcters or their real faces. Not really into their animated real faces...  The colors and the rest of the art was great though!
I've watched this four times already and absolutely love it.
animation doesn’t quite fit the music but itst cool
I watch every piece of content you put out and love what you do, so I think it’s ok to sometimes honestly say that even you guys missed the mark. This just isn’t good. I hope this won’t be the intro for a year
I luv it!!
I'm surprised with how whiny everyone is with the intro. I didnt know the dnd crowd was this annoying and nitpicky
This feels like they ran some camera angled films through a filter applying program, did some touch up edits.. and I can't say I feel a strong connection to this intro since it feels so soullessly produced and generic.. I don't want to be that guy.. or be harsh.. it's just what I feel..
As I said before, a nice song, but such a wasted opportunity to make something darker and heavier that fits the chaotic style of this campaign.
Watching you guys' continued success and growth over the years makes me happier with each passing milestone 🥲 Wishing for many more years to come!
This is a very fun and creative intro! I do think the jungle intro worked better though. For one thing, this animation doesn't really flow with the music at all. There's a noticeable disconnect here, whereas the jungle intro fit the soundtrack perfectly. However, it's still very fun!
i like it - both are great intros and the new one got subtle hints at the previous campaigns.   overall i prefer the 1800's feeling of the previous intro for campaign 3.
This has that creepy uncanny valley feeling in it.  Pretty cool
I enjoyed the animation style, but the music synching was better for the live action one; that was so carefully timed to match the visuals to the singer, and now that’s gone. This spends much longer on some characters than others, which feels weird. Liam and Marisha definitely got the coolest bits.
I wish I liked this song... I really do. I just cannot stand it. It feels so campy.
This is so cringe and horrible
Man the critical roll intro song is so fucking lame holy hell
I gotta say, i dont like that its not chars but players this time
fucik im crying this is so good
Gotta say, I really don’t like this
It looks OK, but I'm not a fan of rotoscoping at all, especially after we just had a live action OP. Plus the animation never really felt in sync with music the way the previous one did, kept expecting something big when the music swelled for the chorus, but it just kept going with the transitions. I think C2 nailed it, players for the first OP and characters for the second, this time we got the players for the first OP and the players again with hints of the characters for the second OP. I've been watching since C1E1 launched, this is my least favorite CR OP.
That is the coolest animation I’ve ever seen!
This is so cute i love the colours :D
Epic you guys good work.
Awesome intro :) I get it. Showing something different and showing the interactions. Hints of who plays who :)
I think I much preferred the jungle one. I just enjoyed it more - plus this one hurts my eyes a little with all the white and bright flicking around of colours.
I love this.
Delightful, well done guys!!!
my brain for the first ten seconds just stared at matt's name and only saw "mother mercer" and i had to physically rewind the video just to double check and make sure i read it wrong--
Fellow critters, I know we loved your turn to roll, but please, acknowledge how much of that love is nostalgia! These intros aren't bad, they're just new and different. I feel kinda bummed that if anyone at CR is reading these comments, they're only gonna see people hating on their experiments. You'd never have stuff as successful as they did if they didn't keep trying different things!
This is an anime opening.

I really love that Dorian and Bertrand were both included at the end! (And what I'm assuming was Pretty). They may not currently be in the tale but they still helped make it what it is now 🥺❤️
Is that Oleander in Ashley's hands?
i'm really sorry to say, but travis is morbing at 0:50
I do hope that you're all happy with how this turned out. It seems like quite a lot of work went into this. The new style is different, and will perhaps grow on us, the fans, in time.
wicked cool guys I like it
In terms of C3 intros I prefer the first one, not that this isn’t cool! But, what was cool about the first one was that they could slot the guest into that intro, like they did with Robbie. All they would have to do is get the guest to dress like their in a safari and shoot something simple and voila, their in the intro.   An animated intro with all the characters is probably the most ideal intro you can get though, because nothing has yet beaten the C2 animated intro. They might think it’s still too early for that though (C2 animated intro premiered in episode 44)
Sam really does look like steve-o
I love CR but this intro just doesn’t feel right. I would just go back to the old one….
Yoooo....this is so trippy!! Love it!!
Considering A Scanner Darkly is one of my favorite movies I absolutely love this.
I would like to see at some point an animated opening for this campaign in the same vein as the “Your turn to role” one.
breathtaking,  the first one was awesome and gave off the questing vibe,  this one gives off the roller-coaster vibe that a good combat scenario has.  thank you for making us  so many awesome memories
cooool
Where is Ashton's mini in this opening? I'm concerned
Not a huge fan of this one. I don't like the way the video flows and the rotoscoping is very uncanny valley. I wish the song was more upbeat and the animation was based on their characters like the M9 intro.
Apple filters survive even today apparently
A lot of this is beautiful but it feels really choppy. Almost as if every other frame is being skipped. It feel less like animation and more like rendering software was used to essentially trace. While there are some beautiful moments, overall, the quality does not feel like it hits the mark.
I know first die was a D4 but how many will call "Illuminati" on it tho? 😂😅😅
this intro is much less cringe then the first one
Literally did a jump for joy at the end. Love it!!!
It's a great opening, very well animated and well put together, it just doesn't "feel" quite right with the song though. It doesn't mesh the same as the previous opening. The live action opening really feels more personal to me, like we're getting more of a feel of each of their personalities coming across. I'm just not getting that with this opening. It feels a bit more "generic animated d&d opening", even if it is of the highest caliber. Maybe there's a way to combine the best of both together. Just my opinion though.
This is really great, I love the song, and I love the splashy type of filming and animating they did with this. However the movements don't really match the song... The original one the filmed for the song matched the tempo and crescendos and this one feels like it was made for something completely different. If there was a different song for it that fit the movements and animations it would be even cooler.   That said, I really love the transitions in this, especially the Liam to Marisha one. I also really love the energy everyone has, and Ashley's and Laura's movements look so great with this animation. And Travis and Taliesin look like they're having a blast, so much fun!
The black fingers on Laudna.... Scarlet Witch anyone?
Travis looks like he wanted to laugh so bad on those scenes 🤣
I prefer the first one cause it just fits the song better but I'm sure it will grow on me. I just wished , if they already use rotoscope that they include their characters not themselves. It has this uncanny valley effect now.
Love the song, love the animation, just... they don't match each other. The previous intro matched perfectly but this one has a huge disconnect. Takes you out of the experience. Plus I was looking forward to how the guests would show up in the intros. That would have bee fun.
Really enjoy this video opener it is so fresh and vibrant :D that said I LOVE the pulp adventurer Opener !
I just love how far this group of friends has gotten
People are so salty about the song It fits campaign 3 better because we are having more than just C3. We've hade Examdria Unlimited, EXU:Calamity, and I'm willing to bet we're gonna have more, so the intro for this saga of CR had to encompass that so it's better to go with one that's about the fans coming together rather than trying to make an intro for each little spin off
I love this, I absolutely do, but.. the music's wrong. I'm sorry but it really doesn't fit the vibe vibe at all, I think it should be something more like the 4-sided dive theme, because this just doesn't fit all that well..
Thanks to a friend of mine I can’t watch this without replacing the audio with “Take On Me” in my head 😆
Cool... But i confess, i prefer the first one, it have a more "C'thulu" vibe and the scenes with all of then at the table were incredibly funny heh
Lots of comments compairing previous intros, so I thougt I should weigh-in for once.  While some of the older stuff is incredibly awesome and has set a high bar, I'm also loving the creativity and artistic expression the team has come up with here. Some shots are downright gorgeous (Ashley and Liam come to mind).  Just wanted to share some love =)
What is the cliff-top building in the opening frames? Anyone else pause-frame-advanced this vid frame-by-frame for the deets?
Needs a different song, which I’m sure it’s incoming.
love it.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Love it
I love this, personally. ✨💛👏🏾
Guys. We cannot become the new Star Wars ‘fanbase’. Be grateful for the content we get. Don’t become a ‘but I like the M9 intro better’ person. It suits none of us, and we’re better than this. This is beautiful and it’ll grow on us!
I don't understand the reason for the change. What was so dissatisfying about the first that an entire new cinematic had to be commissioned so early in the season ?
I like how Liam's part transitioned into Marisha's. I feel like it had ~Air Ashari~ vibes and it was Keyleth transitioning into Laudna. Not so crazy about this intro but the rotoscoping was pretty cool. I liked Ashley's bit as well ♥
hell yeah.
I think this is great! It's really beautiful, and everyone involved did a fantastic job!
Man, this rotoscoped animation and Blackmore's Night-esque song work together SO well. What a fantastic intro!
Hell yes!  Cool opening!
Something subtle that I love about this intro is that Taliesin's tremor isn't disguised in any way.  Essential tremor is something that affects a lot of folks, and often causes shame, because people can be ableist AF. I've always loved that Taliesin is open about it being part of him, something he manages, but that doesn't go away.  In this intro it even adds to the feel of Ashton/Taliesin holding and controlling the crystal.  [/ramble] Just something I noticed and overthought.
This is the only open credit change that will be a pass for me.
I love this so much T.T Really well done with the animations and I LOVE the fact Travis is wearing his Strongjaw shirt haha. Keep it up guys!
Errrmageerrrrrd.. love this, love you guys. You all sparked a flame in my girls (and myself) to start our own campaign! We love watching Critical Role 🥰
I hate to be negative, because clearly a lot of effort went into this. But it just doesn't work for me, for reasons that others have pointed out below. The only thing I want to add is that my preference is definitely on an intro that showcases the characters, not the players. I'm a big fan, of course, of everyone around the table - but what differentiates the campaigns from each other is the story and characters, not the cast.  Since this is a 'campaign 3 intro' and not a general use 'critical role intro' I feel like it needs to focus on the setting, world, tone and characters of C3. Your Turn to Roll would not be as popular as it is if it featured the cast in non-descript locations in place of their characters, even if everything else remained the same.
It's a beautiful intro but I feel like it's doing a disservice to the characters. The players are all showcased in the amazing live action intro, this could really have given more focus to their characters now that we know a bit more about them and their personalities. I know characters wouldn't exist without the players but them having their own intro really adds to the immersion and storytelling.
While it may not be a lot of people's favorite, I like how they're trying different things and doing things that can be cool in their own way. :) The signatures are a nice touch, and the animation style is neat in a kinda unique way, the subtle player/character details are pretty sweet too. Would love full-on transformations into their characters, but I think it's actually a pretty decent intro. :)
This is absolutely phenomenal!!!
Matt looks extra Jesus-y here. And I love it.
Epic! Good job guys
Y'all should redo the intro to be like campaign 2's
Love it!
Awesome! Still watching season 2, so I'm only watching bits of S3 stuff.
I'm certain they used mocaps suits because animating those movements would be wild
by FAR the cringiest intro of all time
This intro gives me motion sickness
this is incredible i love it so much
Just gonna be straight up: I dont like it. I love your show though and will watch it regardless
It looks really cool. Very neatly done.
Meh, prefer the old one. Loved the Indiana Jones vibe and the colour smoke
Not to be hater but this just feels like a huge downgrade to me. I mean, I know great channels that make silly videos in this style (but even those at higher fps) and those are funny and all but it doesn't really fit CR imo. Just feels cheap and like it was probably a rushed job.  Which doesn't reflect on my feelings for the show, I just don't particularly like this intro.
love it! <3 cant wait for next campaign 3 sesh
I got goosebumps 😍
Not a fan of this intro..I liked the original more. The animation at 5frames per second is jarring to watch.
I like it bit less cheesy than the last one
I really don't want to complain, but I have this feeling I have to get out. This campaign just doesn't do it for me. I really don't know what it is. I was hyped when it started, but that fissled out pretty early on. I don't know if it's the setting, the characters the story or what, but I'm not drawn in like I was in c2. C2 had me from the get go and never wavered, even during the covid break. It feels...removed...somehow from the audience in a way c2 never was. Maybe it's the new set or perhaps the (too many) ties to c1? I don't know. Just my two cents.
The colors are cool but the animation gives me motion sickness 🥲
Now mute it and play "Take on Me" in the background instead. The original idea wasn't mine, but the music fits so well with the colors and movement of the camera.
I can't get into this, it just feels clunky and laggy, and honestly that's the best way i can describe it, it feels like everything has a delay to it.  Like i can freeze it on certain frames and it looks amazing, but as a video i just can't.
why does it have 3fps?
I'm honestly not a fan. The live action version is imo way way better
Not my favourite. Preferred the old opening. Also plays really clunky. Liam and Ashleigh have like no screen time now and I couldn't watch it more than twice. Bring back the old opening
This animation style feels rather cheap, and in my subjective opinion, rather ugly. The previous intro was much, much more impressive and visually pleasing. Trying new things out should never be discouraged though, I'm sure some people love this
This looks good but the timing is all over the place, really needs more work since a lot of the transitions are way too off.
I know everyone loves the theme and opening to campaign two and so do I but give them credit for trying something new and it's Thursday as a theme song is growing on me.
Honestly worse than the before tbh
love it
Damn, y’all are really hating on this.  I loved “Your Turn to Roll” as much as anyone, but this intro is sick, too. Chill guys.
Hate it. The first one was better, don't know why they changed it. It doesn't bring anything new that was lacking in the other. Agree with everyone that campaign 2 animated one, was the best. I like that it had their characters, and you understood what their characters were like from the intro. This style of introducing the cast feels less 'this is a story' and more 'these people are in it'.
It’s growing on me
I love it! I will say i was hoping for a style more toward campaign 2's intro, following the characters in world  but i do understand that this new group is not really looking like a dungeon delving sort, very much more like a social setting bunch like fighting humanoids more regularly than previous parties, through words and fists
Oh my this is so bad.
This is cool & fun & I get they were trying to do something different from other Champaign openings, but I gotta admit I was looking forward to an opening like Mighty 9's lol. Now I wanna watch Mighty 9's opening... Lol
Where is the blue genasi boy player? Is he not coming back?
This is AMAZING!!!!!
I can't say for the visuals, but the song is great and people that are comparing it to the "original" or the second intro? It's okay to like it as your favourite of course, but sometimes the criticsm comes from an obvious place of bias and "it was better back then" syndrome. Give it a chance, I promise it'll grow on you after a while.
This is very cool, but I will echo some of the other comments here and say I hope we get a char based intro later on.
It's lovely!  Admittedly, I'll miss that fun live-action opening, but if people will complain about pith helmets, I suppose you had to do something...
Matt looks hard-core like Jesus at the end.
What I love about this intro is that at first I was like "oh, they went for another one with them instead of their characters" and then transition with Ashley came and I was in tears (yeah, at first time I didn't notice Imogen's "energy balls"). It's a beautiful intro and I love every detail, Taliesin's hand shaking, Marisha on her chair, Laura jumping on dices..
This is crazy, I love it
This intro is pretty good in my opinion.  However it's gonna age really quickly should any of the PCs perish.  Like many others I think trying to compete with the work that the Areopagita's did for C2 is a brutal prospect.
I'm not a fan of this intro. It just doesn't flow very well, and the style is very hit or miss. But I don't want to disparage it entirely.  I think the first one was much better. I know the change might have been made due to the criticism which I felt was unfair, but I feel that it might have been better to just acknowledge some choices might have been misguided and that they would try to do better in the future.  Instead we get something that feels rushed, and out of place. I do appreciate the effort they made though.
it doesn't get more cringe than this shit
This was fire they always amaze me
Reading some of the comments here I have yet to see anyone address that perhaps the cast and crew made a new intro so soon (and mayhap a bit rushed) was to not continue to use the original CR3 intro, which received some very valid concerns for having colonizing imagery. Of course I can’t confirm that this was a part of the intention but I appreciate the move away from potentially harmful themes even at an artistic trade off regardless.
It's *really* pretty. I can't help but think the audio is just a little behind the video, though? The sync just seems off. Still, love the style. 💕
This is absolutely gorgeous!
It's Beautiful you guys. Well done all around.
Wow!
I'ma be honest, the song really doesn't fit all that well to what's going on in the vid itself. Just doesn't mesh all that well, prefer the old intro. It's a beautifully crafted intro! just yeah...berhaps a new song.
I'm really sad the previous one got replaced because it was so good. I hate that some people decided to really stretch and say the costumes promoted colonialism and genocide. This is why we can't have nice things.
Loved the vocals by everyone in this. Also the rotoscoping is pretty cool. However it can't beat the literal perfection of M9's animated intro.
I've never seen this type of art style but it's beautiful
Love how vibrant the intro is, but this is by far the worst CR intro.
Animation has those strong A-Ha "take on me" vibes.
Fantastic!!
This is nice, but I like the first one better. I actually think the jungle explorer scenes for the first half of the song, and the animated scenes for the second half would be a good combo. The slow-mo panoramas in the original C3 intro are cheesy, imo, but the exploration scenes are cool.  In this one, I liked how every actor's animation sequence was a subtle nod to their characters, but I don't see how Sam snowboarding on a sword has anything to do with FCG...
I think I prefer the love action to this, don’t get me wrong, the art is cool. But I feel like the pure chaos in adventure in the first one fit more.
As 'uncanny valley' feel this has, I 100% prefer this over the semi racist colonial vibe the last intro had lmao
I perfer the last one honestly
Sorry Critical Role... I like the general idea... but I just don't like this intro.  Its bright, and flashy, and I just don't have a clue what direction you were trying to go with it.  It's such a weird mish-mash of random. The first little bit of seeing the tower flash, and the zoom-out to the characters as minis is awesome! Matt's choppy weird closeup seems weird?  But the clap D4 portal thingy to take us into the world is a neat idea... but we were just in the world?  So that seems like an odd choice. So Laura rolls a d20, and is then skipping on a row of d20s and falls into a pool or something.  Weird. Ashley slashes an energy ball, and then gets a flash of horns along with plants... so we are going to transform into the characters?  oh, guess not... moving right along then.  Did laura get a flash of her character?  I don't think I saw it. A flower turns into a crystal, and Talisan smashes it with a hammer... that was short but interesting and character related, sorta, kinda, almost. Travis is wearing the strong-jaw shirt and acting all big and tough, so is this the return of Grog? Oh, nope, he sort of turns into a warewolf kinda, so maybe we are going to do more with the characters? Oh, nope, moving right along then. Random shots of the cast around the table is random... I mean, we get 3-6 hours of that every thursday, so why not spend 1/3rd of the intro doing that too but in animated form?  Are we not introducing the other characters? Sam transitions from drowning the world with alcohol, to riding a sword like a skateboard... nothing to do with his character, so what wheel are we tilting at now? Liam grabs the board sword and swings it around for a moment like his character perhaps would, so I guess we are continuing introductions... could have been a neat opportunity to have him turn into his character? Nope. Marisha gets a long build-up moment with her hands putting out goop like her charac.... nope, nope, we are still refusing to do anything cool with the characters. Aaaaand, we must be nearly done with the hero pose.  4 of them get props that their characters might have, and 3 of them are just standing there awkwardly.  No carving tools for Travis?  No rat skeleton for Marisha?  Maybe have a wheelbarrow wheel that Sam is propping a foot on?  No props whatsoever?  They are just going to stand there?!?! Odd choise. One last shot going back to Matt, and we get to see flashes of some of the characters he plays... exactly what I was hoping for with the other introductions!  Maybe we will go back and see something with the others?  Oh... really shut the book on that thought didn't we. And then a poorly animated version of the already animated logo... odd choice to close on.  Why not keep the better older version that goes with the well established branding?  I mean, there are 2 real complaints here: 1) We see the actors, literally for hours every session.  Throwing them in is fine and all, but the glory of animation is seeing the bits we don't get to see all the time.  And all we get to see of the characters is just the bio pic in the corner of the screen. Even going with the medium of animation implies that we are going through the effort to make the unreal visible... but we don't.  All of this could have been done (and probably was done) better with a camera, without the lead-on of something cool that isn't coming.  Mediums have strengths and weaknesses, and this was like watching someone play with a new medium without understanding how it actually works... except in some moments you show that you do know how it works and use it really well... and then in others you don't.  It is just so difficult to watch. 2) One of the most amazing things about D&D is story telling... and this is is just bad storytelling!  Its like we start out inside the world, and then are blown out of it into our reality from an imaginative perspective... But it is an intro that is supposed to invite us INTO the world, and this just kicks us out of it.  Some of the shots bring us some glint or hint at the character the actor is playing... and other shots show Laura jumping on dice for no reason, and Sam surfing on a sword for no reason.  For some characters we get a hint of the character's personality or powers... and others we don't.  Just pick a direction and have some semblance of consistency.  I dunno... I just somehow thought that a group with so many highly respected professionals, and such a large viewership, and with so many sponsors, and so many merch sales, and so many donations... I thought maybe you could afford to do just a little bit better?  In all seriousness, it just needs some work.  Its like a great concept piece that someone worked super hard on, and somebody just slapped the approval stamp on it as the final when the creator wasnt done.  It is just jarring and pointless and off-putting.  Please try it again, it is a fantastic concept!  But please put this version back in the vault and don't subject us to it for the next 2-3 years.  Its just objectively bad and difficult to watch guys.
I love the Mighty Nien animated opening. I was hoping for something that showcased the characters more. We already had a really good opening for this season that showed the actors. It has some cool ideas but it just doesn't do enough. I mean I'm not mad or anything but this is just doing it for me.
This is AMAZING! I literally teared up y'all! I would use this one forever! 🤣🥰✌️
Gives me the big chills always, but no matter how much I try to put it aside in my brain all I can think is "Take on me, take me on, I'll be gone, in a day or two" haha. Definitely up there as a fave intro though, I'd say 3rd place, the original live-action one is 2nd, and of course Your Turn To Roll is 1st place, I honestly wish every D&D campaign could have such a wonderful animated opening that shows the characters and current history of the campaign in such a fluid and silent narrative backed with fitting music.
Do yourself a favour and watch this with A-Ha's Take on Me playing over the visuals. Good times!
I’m really hoping these intros of the cast are just placeholders until an amazing animated intro of the characters they are portraying is ready. After all, we didn’t get the C2 animated intro until around episode 40. Perhaps they are waiting until this new crew of characters has more of an idea of what they’re all about before they set the intro in stone.  I hope.
I'm sorry guys but this ain't it. We're getting close to Uncanny Valley territory here...
Very very cool! I love that each intro has been totally unique & something new. Definitely a favorite of mine!
I'm sorry, but it's still not doing it for me. I don't like the generic "It's Thursday Night" song at all. It's too slow and theatrical-sounding, I guess? I don't know, I'm just not a fan. Doesn't seem to fit Bell's Hells at all.  And I was hoping we'd see the characters themselves in some way. Animated like the M9, ideally, but I'd have taken LARP like with VM again.  The best part of the previous intros were that they actually featured the characters. Here, we see references to them at best.   If you're going for a generic catch-all intro, I guess it works, but I don't like it.
Haven't really seen any comparison to the other intros I've agreed with yet. I think the M9 intro is stellar and I bet its just as gratifying for the cast to see their characters animated as it is for us. I'm also sympathetic that its going to have the highest, most prohibitive time/money cost. That said, I think the live action intros are wonderful. Though they're corny and not as fantastically immersive as a full animation, they're very fun and feel like celebrations of the team's creativity and talent. Finally I think THIS intro, regardless of what I personally feel about its creative decisions, was executed poorly and falls below the quality level I'm usually thrilled to see from Critical Role.  (Also, I understand the criticisms of the previous intro's colonial themes, but I'm on the fence about how harmful it really was; I think maybe its enough for them to just go forward with more awareness regarding explorer tropes. Plus they change the intros regularly enough anyways)
that's awesome! i love the Joel Haver style around the table
Tell me why Take on Me y Aha also works well lol
Damn tough crowd in here. I really like this intro.
I love it. Super cool
The Rapture is coming. What they tell you after is a lie. They’ll say we were abducted by aliens (demons) Accept Jesus, don’t get left behind! Read Ezekiel 37-39, Daniel, and Revelation(see The Bible Project) ❤️
I am absolutely in LOVE with this new intro! all the hidden details are amazing (and I keep noticing more every time I watch it). Not to mention how much better it is to the old one :)
Y'all are way too critical this is badass
ok so everyone was really well made but my god 1:10 Liam looks incredible. and sam also looks really good too
I loved the original opening. But as usual, you have taken something that was really good, and made it better. Love you guys.
While I would've liked to see another live-action version with Erika swapped in, like they did with the original version of this intro theme, I like this new version. It's cute and fun. Plus, Erika's character Dusk is in there right after Eshteross, so it's still following the precedent of having favorite NPS and temporary PCs in the intro that "Your Turn to Roll" set. I hope they keep that up, if they keep this animated intro.
I absolutely love this! Intense nostalgia for those of us of a certain age lol.
Dunno just feels laggy to me.
This was fun, but now you got me in my feels by flashing Bertrand and Dorian in there... I miss Robby. Looking forward to seeing more of Erika in action.
A friend told me about the new intro today and my first question was "does it actually have the characters in it this time"? Sadly not.
Bottom of the list.
best opening since campaign one...
This animation is seriously stunning.
To be honest, I prefer the life action intro... Seeing everyone with the explorer outfits was really charming
Beautifully and brilliantly done.
This Is a cool intro and i think it was alright up until we saw the people all at the table. My biggest problems are the music isn't synced with the visuals and I would say that at them moment where we see the people at the table it's like the art style they had switched. I liked the characters prior because they looked somewhat real, and then they suddenly made them look like sims. My other problem is as we continue throughout the intro the quality goes down, like by the end these characters look like their faces were photoshopped.
Of all the CR intros this is definitely one of them. It's got music and everything.
I like the colors and some of the mannerisms that they managed to capture here, but I'm not a fan of this new intro. I like the live action one better. I would rather see the characters instead of the people playing them. A D&D campaign is supposed to be about fantasy and imagination after all. We haven't seen that too much during Campaign 3 yet. Hopefully it's something that they plan to do later on. I miss the fanart that they used to highlight during part of the break... I understand why they're not doing it though.
Bertrand! 😭
When i noticed their signatures, it felt like the cast is presenting who they really are, not just their characters.
like the visuals, still not a fan of thursday night over the old theme, but thats just me.
I'm speechless...this is amazing
Meh. The colors are pretty, I guess. The first intro was way better - I watched it every time. I imagine I'll fast-forward through this one each episode.
Okay, actually, one complaint - am I seeing this wrong or is Orym as tall as Imogen?? He's a halfling. Aren't he and Chetney only a few inches difference??
Holy crap how do they keep making such amazing intros
It's 1 minute and 45 seconds in an episode that lasts from 3 to 5 hours.  It's fine.  Nice, cool, good enough.  Doesn't have to be the artistic perfection of human history or solve all my life problems; that's what the rest of the episode is for :D
Cringe... But the good kind xD
I liked the original one for this campaign way better. This feels very off, especially the music which doesn´t feel like it match. Only thing I like is Travis almost turning into a werewolf.
This is... not what I was expecting. Not by a mile.   EDIT: 43M, 8.4M at the time of this post. Guess I am not the only one that considers this low effort.
Not sure what people are talking about with the C3 intro. The first time I saw it, it gave me goosebumps.
Why does the moment from 0:52 until 1:05 seem like it would be cool to have a 360 camera in the middle of the table and witness an episode of critical roll from VR?
TRAVIS!! That wolf morph gave me goosies!! So sick!
Eh, not every intro is going to be epic.
Here from tiktok, needed to see the actual opening and I have to say Take on Me from A-ha fits so much better, if I watch this season I will be muting and listening to Take on Me for each episode.
Even though this style isn't really my thing, I continue to appreciate how different all the intros have been. Keep being weird and experimenting! <3
I love this so much! Such fun rotoscoping and this song has really grown on me!
The animation is great. I think the problem with this intro is a direction one, because the timing of the scenes feels off
This is really cool
this intro is good actually because it reminded me history maker from yuri on ice is something i can just go watch
I say this with lots of love and respect to the time put into this by the artists but it's a no from me dawg :(
Lowkey sad how every comment talks about how this isn't their favorite intro. Honestly, I don't care to compare. I just think this is badass, super well-done, and I love it.
I have no idea what half the people in this comment section are talking about I'm loving this  edit: I also feel like some of the people who are missing the c2 intros(me included) that while they're amazing, there is also an element of seeing those intros so much during a campaign that they started with or had such a deep connection with that we don't have yet with c3 because of time. change is hard, but not necessarily bad <3
damnnnnnnnn
This was excellent 👍 While I can agree that a more character-focused intro gets me more invested, this style is insane and I love it. The first c3 intro was always strange to me because the reactions being made were so overly ridiculous and decidedly not candid, so while the editing was cool it felt like there was a disconnect to the home-game vibe since we see everyone's real reactions each week. This one actually corrected that for me
A really beautiful work of art.
Felt like it was laggy, and out of sync?
I think the Rotoscoping looks amazing, Ashley looks great in this style, but just as always, Talesin looks the best in the most odd situations
okay, but this is GORGEOUS!
Ok...that was sick.
So personal opinion for me is that I do consider this intro a downgrade from the previous one in C3, it's not that I have anything against the animation at all. I think most of the stuff when it comes to this intro is really well made, but to me the theme from the first intro of C3 doesn't match that well with how this animation was made.   Now I do see alot of comments mentioning the intro from C2, and while I do agree it's really good, I do dig the intro song for C3 alot. Personally I would've liked to see the intros sorta evolve like how the intros evolved for campaign 1 and 2, with the first intro's being of the cast and the second intros being of the characters. It's weird but I did like that.   Overall this one is not bad, just not as great as previous intros. Still enjoy it though.
It's lovely but the song and the animations dont quite match
I don't like it, plz delete
Rotoscoped or is this a CGI capture effect? Intriguing.
Yay. much better
i think this clips is great and there is a hidden references and magic of edit when liam point the sword at marisha and the leafs blow with stream of wind, bc their first game character, the same as sam sliding the sword kinda like scanlen, in away its very respectful to the characters that started it all, and i cry every time i hear it ^_^
That's so fucking cool, I love the style (and not gonna lie in the last one the slow mo faces full zoom, were both a bit creepy and a bit cringe)
🤜🤛
Oof, this one is controversial, i hope it won't cause any unnecessary community drama (who am i kidding though?). What is interesting - it is done by a great and talented team. Even though some creative decisions aren't my cup of tea i think that the main problem is that it is frankly speaking - too rushed. Low FPS,  sound sync problems and lack of some crucial SFX for everything to pop, lack of characters and too much focus on players themselves, some moments definitely show cut corners (Taliesin face twitches for one frame and the rectangular backdrop for the table scenes is just kind of jarring).  I think everyone (CR cast and Minnow Mountain primarily) deserve a better polished version, but i think the reality was that between the controversy of the first opening and the tremendous resources needed for rotoscoping - there was not just enough time/money.  I really hope that the community would be polite about their feedback and the team would revisit the opening. I think it has a lot of potential, but only 2/3 of the production it needed to pull if off.
I love this so much. Great work gang & crew 🥺
.
Man, CR used to be so good.
Oh my god ….why did this make me cry damnit
I‘m really not a fan of rotoscoping in animation. It would be awesome on its own, but compared to the campaign 2 opening it just lacks thr drive and expressiveness that a talented animator can bring into the scenes. Sadly, the other cool stuff that’s going on here can‘t save it. 🥲
Brilliant !!
It‘s cool but the other version is better ✌🏼
I genuinely cannot tell if this is pure animation, Mocap, or AU but I don’t care. This is an amazingly beautiful intro.
I like the animation a lot but the song’s mood doesn’t match it IMO. Something bouncier and fun would be a great fit.
IT SO! FUCKING! GOOD! In every new iteration of these intro I can see the joy and passion everyone put into the show for everyone's benefit and it just make this MF tear up every time I watch them. GOOD. FUCKING. JOB. *chefs kiss*
I love this! As the end rolled, my 18 year old walks in and asks "Was that Matt Mercer at the end?" and I replied, 'Yes. Why?" Their reply was "Oh, it's just Jesus. Cool."
Super cool :D
That gave me goose bumps! I love it, well done!
You are really talented my friend 🤗 you have my full support 😁 thank you for sharing this amazing video👌👌👌👍
I dunno about this intro, unfortunately. The rotoscoping seems off, maybe it's the audio syncing, or maybe it's not that exciting. I kinda see a generic Critical Role intro that could fit into any Thursday night show on the channel, and not a campaign 3 intro that really stands out or showcases the colorful cast of characters that everyone is playing like the ones in C1 or C2.
Your Turn to Roll was the best animated intro, It's Thursday Night has the better live action intro. And i dont know, this intro felt a bit, choppy? but not choppy good.... and it seems like the visuals and the audio syncing wasn't thought out as well as previous intros. thats just my opinion tho, still fun to watch, but... yeah...
Love the art style, but much preferred the Original Campaign 3 intro video, which fitted the song alot more. But  still love this though.
so good
This is good, but not nearly as fantastic as the animated c2 Your Turn To Roll.
I loved it
Its... its not good. To be honest, it's even worse than the live intro, and I didn't even like that one.  "Your turn to roll" animated intro was good, but this one has that "uncanny valley" vibe.  Somehow even guys from Zakarpattya did it better
With the colour and style of the animation they should have used "Take on Me" as their theme for this season!!!
do the roar!
I think my heart just exploded from excitement
The new intro is pretty and everything but I feel like the visuals and the song just aren't in sync. It makes the rhythm of the whole piece feel off
I think this is cool, fun, and fine and all of the people who worked on this should be proud because I'm sure it took weeks and not pay much mind to everyone who thinks they're entitled to other people's creativity wether they realize ot or not. It's your show, so make the show the way that fulfils you.
This is horrible
I think the one in the jungle is better I just love how elaborate the sets looked even though it was kind of not a right fit it worked awesome
Not digging it.  Loved the the live action one they started the campaign with, but don't like this one at all.
Stupid question. Did something happen between the cast and Robbie?
Smash.
I love how each player got an aspect of their character represented in this.  Werewolf Travis looks so happy!
I like what you've gone for here but this animation has a real uncanny valley feel to it and being so similar in so many places to the live action version only enhances that.
...now moving to Fridays! Lol 😂 that would be funny.
We still have many episodes as the opening may evolve, while the first one is still my favourite for C3 this one is okay too.
Never been a fan of rotoscope, and this does not change my mind.
Don't get me wrong I simply LOVED the previous one but this one and how it nods to the characters they are portraying is just beautiful and that little flash of Dorian at the end T_T my heart.
Very different but I like it. I hope getting a new intro this early in the campaign means we will be getting more intros as the campaign progresses.
Sorry I still think Your Turn to Roll is better.
I’m sorry but this franchise makes SO MUCH money and these are the intros they give us? I was already kinda iffy about this campaign, but now I’m just disappointed.
The whole being mad it "glorified colonialism" thing is stupid. First of all, the presence of a common clothing item does not mean it was glorifying. Second of all, literally every group of people have done bad things. There aren't any groups of people that are 100%innocent of wrong doing. Everyone has always been a victim of and the perpetrators of something messed up. If we cut the existence of anything that could relate tk a historically harmful moment in time, then we'd have nothing left. The only reason people get super mad on some things more than others is because apparently European colonialism is the only thing people care about.
On the one hand I see a lot of good animation points, but the attempt to capture the human likeness in this style just looks strange to me.
I like it, the more I watch it the more I like it. It’s hard as hell to top M9 honestly, and that’s okay. The colors are really cool and I like to see the cast being highlighted as opposed to just the characters. I know it’s divisive but I’m into it.     My only advice is there should be a warning that might need to be issued because of the movement/lighting for it.
Yall need to stop tiptoing around. It sucks. We all know it sucks.
thats frickin beautifull!!!
Oh my god this is epic
Love how all the people trying to make out that the first intro was racist are now complaining that they don’t like this intro. Such a toxic fandom.
well… it’s definitely an intro
Hmm, its not bad, but it doesn't give me goosebumps from watching like the original C3 opening does
I geeked out the entire time watching this.  SO FREAKING COOL!!!
I saw a tiktok that Take On Me by A-ha is the perfect backing track to this and I just can’t agree more now seeing it again
This is cool and a banger,  but campaign 2 intro is GOATED
I dig that this one is more personable than your turn to roll. And I like that it gets everyone involved but. Fuck I hate that we didn’t just get a new animation for your turn to roll. It’s a better theme song. And a better SONG cause it’s not actually tied to anything specific (which is probably why they opted for this to be more CR branded)
Marisha better come through with the 3-point hero landing
Animation is great. Song is great. Gave me goose pimples. But it KILLS ME to see the sync be so damn bad. Barely any of the animations line up with the beats in the song. Would also appreciate a bit more development on the character side, Sam's and Ashley's sections are completely pointless, and the rest feel too underwhelming when it comes to presenting characters (Marisha's was dope tho).
there's a lot of good things happening in this - the colors, the splashy magical feel, the players warping into their characters. all fun and cool. however, i agree with everyone else, this pales in comparison to the other intros. i think the animated stuff should be saved for showing off the actual characters and bringing them to life, and the players should stay in live action
Well....better than the previous one, so thats something. But yeah Season 2 into is unbeatable!
The C2 animated intro nailed the attention to detail from the storyline to the characters, the many easter eggs and references in every scene was animated with clear intent that there were no scenes made to be a filler. While the first C3 intro had the creativity and feel of roleplay and curious exploration that CR does in their campaign. But this one feels like it was crammed the night before the deadline. Like they just slapped the color palette and whatever C3 references they know and called it a day. I feel like there’s a disconnect between their idea and the execution. I honestly would like the old C3 intro back this is a hard pass for me chief.
Okay but that Liam sword flourish
The art style is something I don't like.  The first C3 opening was really good and worked well with the intro.  This one is ok but the first C3 opening was really good.
this looks SO FREAKING COOL
Yeah, tbh not really a big fan of rotoscoped style. (especially Laura went full uncanny valley) Colours are cool, and it got me on the edge of the seat expecting Travis to go full wolf, and to see Marisha go unsettling presence, but instead all I got is tiny fang action and just a drop of ink. So much unused potential of medium as if animator was afraid to go whole hog and half-assed the job as a result (or just simply wasn't capable enough). Ashley and Taliesin's bits are cool, ngl.
Awesome!
Soo good 😊 I love that the intro gets changed sometimes and we get to experience new and interesting things, but we can always go back and watch the old ones
It's both incredibly good and incredibly cringe 😬
Bro I just cried this is so good
I think this is really cool because it feels like it's more about the cast than the characters they play -recognizing that these characters stem from real people loved by other people who are just as real [us, hopefully lolz] though nothing beats m9 intro for anime-ish-ness
This is top tier stuff!
Wow, this is beautiful.
Gave me goosebumps for some reason 👌
It's making me dizzy with all the camera tilt. Feels like I'm watching someone play in VR. Not a fan.
I liked the old one better where they had those cool slow-mo shots of the real cast and they were all doing cool/silly things and stuff was flying everywhere. The animated versions of the real people look kind of uncanny. I'm just glad the music stayed, because I absolutely love this song!
1:05 is the result of: -OK, so then Sam has to look like a robot. -Sure! How do we do it? -Huh... We don't.
TBH the previous live action one was a lot better and the actual animation of C2 was mind blowing my awesome. I was hoping this was a fan thing at first :/
I love how literally everyone's a critic. Scrolling through YouTube I rarely see in song comments "well the move to G major seemed unnecessary, and the fourth in the chorus could've been replaced by a fifth, but overall a good song", but that's how the comments here read. Y'all need a blog.
My god... They've done it. They've made something I genuinely hate.
its very well made, but theres one law the animators ignored that kinda ruines and its that they drew the lines near the noses, which makes the cast look like 15 years older than they are. you never want to draw those lines, its a big no no in rotoscope.
Now I'm hoping that we get a campaign 3 animated series in rotoscope
This was not very good, I'm sorry
Gotta be honest and say that this intro is just ok for me. The live action was much more fun. But we all know that C2 Your Turn To Roll was the ultimate opening and will never be topped.
This is like... Better than I could do for sure! But it feels underwhelming after the others.
It's cool I guess, but the previous one was so much better. Seeing them in slow-mo and with such chaos gave me chill every time.
The colors in this are absolutely beautiful, this is *stunning*.
..im sorry but im a little dissapointed here. CR used to get wonderful high quality traditional 2D animation of their characters and now.... roto? really? did the budget go down or something?  beside, they already had a super cute filmed one, why change it if its to lower the quality?
I didn't like it. Would've liked it more if they had animated their characters instead of themselves. Honestly, if they had the budget for animation, why not? Maybe have a live action scenes of the cast playing at a table, that then focuses down at their miniatures as each one animates to life as the cast plays out a story that unfolds.
Nice animation but still not a fan of the track
I don't sugar coat so bear with me... It's pretty but it doesn't fit with the entertainment that you are trying to make. The intro feels like an old sitcom intro not a high fantasy sprinkled with action adventure and drama intro. Kinda feels like this was made at a specific time for a specific reason which has now passed due to animation taking forever
This intro is cool and all, but I’d just like to see them come to the table on a more regular basis. They’ve missed so many weeks with all their side projects. And that was even before EXU Calamity.
LMFAO WHAT IS THIS
I was a big of of campaign 2 70's sytle opening, but I am a big fan of this one too!
WHAAAAAAAT!!!! This is so Cool!!!! Love it!! I do prefer the live-action intro tho. . .
That Indiana Jones style intro was cool, don't bow down to a vocal minority of morons and change something you genuinely liked, I'm disappointed that you've chosen to allow those people to bully you into changing the intro as if history never fucking happened
Gosh I... really dont like this one. It looks so bad overall and even ONLY the fiery intro looked a lot better.  The animated Mighty Nein was the only one you guys nailed it
It was.. .a choice, alright. Ill probably be skipping this intro in the future episodes, First intro I'm really not into. Still good for those who appreciate/like this new one though, I guess.
Fuck, that was good.
I love the song and I love the intro but something about them together just feels a bit off the older intro went better with the song I think
I mean, it's always fun to see a new intro. The character/actor portrayal could have been better resolved. You're rotoscoping which means you end up with illustrations. Use em and have the character burst out of the actor illustration. We know who you are. We know you're playing a character. Show us a spectacular transition between the two.
Oh great more rainbows….. like we didn’t know all ready….
This is amazing, but is it just me or does the animation appear to lag behind the music by a second or two??
I, uh... Maybe it'll grow on me? The colors and themes are nice. Personally, though, I've always *HATED* rotoscoping. It freaks me the hell out, man!! Like, if you'd ask me to define "uncanny valley", I would simply ask you to pause the video at 00:53 and then at precisely 01:00. Look at Marisha's eyes! WTF? Or Taliesin's entire face for that matter. I love CR and the people in it. It's a labor of love and you can feel it. I've been watching since the Briarwood Arc and loved every single intro since then, but this one is a *huge* mistake IMHO 😰
This is good, the live intro is better, EXCEPT in the case of Matt. Giving him a tome from which he can conjure the world was pretty dope.
This...this I like :)
mmmh... the intro feels weird... the rotoscoping (it feels really flat)... it's probably the lack of darker and stronger outlines... it feels to blurry and timings feel off because of that...  After seeing it would have hoped for a stronger morphing and blending between actor and character
I guess if this is from the same artists as undone
For me C2 intro was 12/10 This one is more of a 10/10 Still awesome tho ♥️♥️♥️
I will say this for the first time since I started watching the series: I don't like this intro. I like certain parts of it, I like the style and the idea. But as a whole? It didn't click with me.  Animations went on a rollercoaster with trying to fit personal and PC traits, like Taliesin smashing a crystal, great, Liam doing a sword flourish, awesome, and the rest of players have really subtle gimmicks: Travis half-assedly showing some teeth, Marisha smearing a bit of goo on her fingers... And there's Sam snowboarding on a sword... I mean all is great but it's inconsistent how all the people are connected to the theme, is it their traits, it is it their character, who knows? It seems random and chaotic but not in a way that CR cast is chaotic...
I'm not sure how I feel about the transition from campaign focused marketing to brand focused marketing. C2s intro was incredible it was catchy it was memorable and it really showed off the campaign and hyped up the audience. 140 episodes in and I still couldn't help but stop to watch it every once and awhile.
This intro hits different when sync'd up to Take on Me...
Worst theme song they've done.
A lot of odd decisions in this, framing and pacing specifically. It's just so disjointed.
Here from TikTok someone put a Aha take on me song over this and it fits ways better.
It can take a little bit to get used to changes to something you love 😋 I've noticed that with the switch from c1 to C2 and then C3, as well as when the songs and the intro animations change up, that once you let them exist in their own space, you will see the beauty in them.  Your turn to roll was a power house of a song. It really riled you up. And the animations were so damn good. the current song  plays your heart strings where it's almost a tribute to the friendship through adventure.  I've enjoyed letting the changes happen through all of it and to learn to love and appreciate the things that this intro will  envoke differently  I for one am really enjoying how travis almost has a childlike wonder and joy in his expression. laura practically being jester in her joyful mannerisms Liam his gentle hearted slow sword dancer style transition in to marisha who is visibly stoked to do her part. Taliesin and Matt standing out from the rest of the group with some feeling of myserious power Ashley has something calm over her as if she's looking out over a meadows field with a hint towards there being a tremendous power within her And Sam doing a bit with a fly sword and oh dang it's my turn already! -gulp- Arrival at the table 😂
Love the song but this intro falls pretty flat for me, vs the live action one, the epic M9 anime one and the VM larp one
While it is pretty it feels more like you placed a filter on some of the shots. And as an animator I see which shots in this are gueniuenly animated and which is AI. Not as if that's a bad thing, but the animation in mighty 9 was better. This is alright but the live action is also better
Why is critical role so fucking cringe?
How did they miss the opportunity to make Travis "wolf out"?
First i was like eeeh tacky, then i was like goosebumps
It was pretty good but I personally referred the live action version. Might have been better with the characters portrayed rather than the players? Not as good as the M9 intro.
*Whoosh, finally!* I'm so glad you fired the director that spawned the cringe which had been in your intro before.
gonna be honest it just kinda looks bad to me
Aweful frames. what the heck
Taliesin's sequence is the best and all the others are kinda lame in comparison. During the table scenes, everyone has dead eyes, no movement, no blinking, full iris visibility on everyone...kinda uncanny.  The only reason I love this is that I can hear Travis' joyful giggle when he saw his own partial transformation for the first time :D
Damn this is so cool!
Oh I love this style! I really appreciate what they are doing here very beautiful art and animation
The c2 intro was just too good. This one feels a bit too derivative. But the Animation is tight.
Ahhh, I was also hoping for it to be more like the C2 animated version with the characters. 😅 That was the best, you guys. This style is ok but I think you all peaked with the combo of “your turn to roll” and the character animation style. I do love Travis always repping Grog no matter what. ❤
There's something highly cursed about the animations ngl
ITs good and all, but i can't help to feel sad that we will not have an opening with the actual characters anymore, like we had in C2, this was a big opportunity to make the cast "cosplay" as the C3 characters, but alas..
ITS STILL SO COOOOOL
Love you guys, great intro, great as always!!
this is so awesome
very well done
I dunno how I feel about this new intro. The artstyle is really cool and this song is a 1000 times better than "Your time to Roll" but there's something about the whole cast dressing up as members from Indiana Jones/The Mummy that I miss in this new video.
An animation with all the characters instead of the players will probably be later. Bit too early for some of the ones the M9 got. Lets wait to see who is still alive character wise before dedicating a lot of artist time
Gonna bet Travis paid extra to get the werewolf bits on him
Woaaaaahhh
Stuff like this is why theatre kids can never be allowed to assume positions of power because the second they get free of anyone who can stop them from their bad ideas, they go all out.  This was really lame, and super mastubatory.
I love it!!! 🥰🥰❤️❤️
That's cool, but I wanna see their characters in action. C2 intro is still unmatched.
I join the majority about "Rotoscoping is meh" / "the Live opening or C2 opening was better". But good job overall, what can i say : You can't have them all !
I am going to miss Sam blinding himself with a camera flash but this is gorgeous.
This one should have been the first intro for c3 since the beginning
Really? This is the same boring stuff as the last intro. The first intro to C2 was pretty good. 1970s feel, took us all back to when we were young (ok i'm in my 50s), the second was bombastic, and you could sing to it.  but this... yawn... watched it once in episode 1, and skipped it everytime i had to endure it (and i'm not writing have to see it - this is some kind of torture tbh)
you glorious creatures, you!
I might be in the lesser party here, but the animation in this intro is really clunky and weird, coupled with the bright colors it is a recipe for making the unpleasant watching experience. The ideas are cool, the color pallete used is great, but man, this realization. I just can't stand this low fps, but somehow fast-paced, twitchy animation. It is a pain to watch. 😔
Honestly, this is fine. Pretty cool, even. But it would be really nice to see an animated intro like in C2.
Missed opportunity to add in Mister for Ashley's scene!
Its really weird in my opinion. But i guess they had no choice after the really loud criticism for the first C3 Campaign.
It's so fantastic I love it
The colors, duke, the colors! Absolutely love it!
I don't think it fits. The music doesn't sync up with the video and all the highs/tension building parts in the song are glossed over by the video, which has amazing animation, but just doesn't 'hit' when the music 'hits'. Still well made though, fantastic art style.
Omg, I got goosebumps!! I love the style so much of this one! You just always have the best intros! <3
Too unrealistic: Marisha not squatting on the chair.  Seriously though this was fun
Its a shame im gonna have to skip this every time becasue all the flashing colors and janky transitions are seizure inducing
Looks like they just rotoscoped some video. Honestly the intro song and animation took a step back this year in my opinion
I don't really like this one. I think the art style is weird and I would have preferred something more akin to "Your turn to roll", where we would get to see the animated characters.
Love the artsy color explosion. Good direction to lean in what animation allows you to do like mixing character with actors and the smooth transition between each. Taliesen's shot was especially badass. Not a fan of the choppy/jumpy animation though. The rotoscoping can be uncanny, but it's something I got used to watching Joel Haver skits.
I like the first opening better, but this is pretty great.
This is interesting. I like the effects that echo their characters.  My favorite opening title is still Your Turn to Roll though. It was just so powerful.
For a second there, I thought I saw Pretty near the end. Then I realized it was Lord Eshteross. 🤷🏻
I love the art style!!!
this gave me goosebumps holy shit
Take on me! Take me on, I'll be gone in a day or two.
Love it ^-^
Nooo the other one was so good! 😭😭😭 it felt like a true intro to a hit tv show. The art in this is really amazing tho
Take on me by a-ha played over this animation is fucking incredible!!
I love the cameos of Bertrand and Dorian and Esteros @ 1:32
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO LOVE THIS?
I want a Naruto Shippuden style open
This is miles better than the first one love it
Honestly of all openings of all seasons this is the weakest for me, by far. All the others got me hyped, i had this epic feeling. I couldn't even say which of them was the best, because they were all so great. From the cosplay one in the first season, both the retro opening and the animated one in season two,  even the real life on of season three, they all took your breath away. I watched them for every episode, never daring to skip them. But this one? Just meh. Thinking about it, even the miniseries had better openings than this. I do't know what they where thinking with this one.
As a personal preference, I don't like this opening cinematic. Could be the art style, could be that they aren't "in character". I'm not sure.  The song is amazing, though. Love it.
The new animation for this is honestly so adorable and heart warming, and the transition from Ashley with a greatsword and then her with plants and such is smooth and I Stan
Ok I love that Sam's features the iconic Veth sledding moment
meh
Nah this ain't it. "Your Turn to Roll" felt like a project made by the homies, for the homies. CR has had some cheesy opening, but I didn't consider anything cringe until Campaign 3. Guess selling out really does change ya. Oh well, I can only catch CR on Mondays nowadays, so thank the Dawn Father I can skip.
The music doesn’t match the video
this is nowhere near as good as the first 2 songs, sadness....
Just needs a little work but not a bad intro
I don't hate this but I definitely feel like it was a step down from just using the live action intro. But I'm sure it will grow on me~
This is fantastically animated props to whoever worked on it, great work.
They should've just redone the original Your Turn to Roll, but take out the bits that make it feel like "colonials in SEA jungle during Imperialism times," and have the cast wear adventuring clothes, that match their characters.
Kinda sad that Robbie is being putted in the last part as the other guests since he stayed on for way more than a simple guest...
Is there some rotoscoping going on, like a Joel Haver animation but smootber?
I'm less of a fan of this one. Much prefer the live action version. The watercolour-yness of it doesn't quite fit for me.
For funsies  Laura; skips like Jester / purple magic like Imogen. Ashley; swing greatswords like Yasha / petals and horns like Fern. Taliesin; crystals like Caduces / hammer like  Aston Travis; shield like Fjord / werewolf like Chetney Sam; I guess oil can like FCG? / Avalanch and sword surfing? Untold backstory? Why did you break the formula here guys, I need to understand. Sam has zero robot references in this intro. Liam; fire for Caleb / Swordplay for Orym Marisha; Um, leaves, so ninja? Balancing on chair monk? / Ah, there we go, Laudna goo!  Why do three of you have no character indicators at the curtain call? Is this a hidden message? Someone help me understand!
That was spectacular
As someone who is colour blind, i just cant get into this intro. the animation style and odd colouration makes everything a blob of gray. That said, they didnt make this for my disability lol   However, i feel like there are great moments here, some not great moments, and some that fall flat entirely for me.  Sam surfing on a sword? why? i mean its funny but has nothing to do with his characters right? Travis wolfing out a bit was really cool but ended as soon as it started, would have liked a litte more of things like that Ultimately the song itself isnt as good as your turn to roll, and the animated c2 opening is just so iconic it will be hard to surpass.  Do i hate this? absolutely not. but i dont really enoy it much either, which has been the vibe of c3 in general so far for me. if course, it will grow on me, just like c2 did after watching c1 for so long.
It's alright to judge things separately, team. The c2 intros were so great, agreed, but that doesn't take away from this at all.   This intro is just flat out beautiful. I think it does a far better job at capturing the energy of the players and their characters and is just a really nice tribute to the people at the table and what they've created. Laura's playful hopping, Travis' rawr face, Marisha's entire energy, etc... It's great.
The animated C2 intro gave me genuine gooseflesh and tears when they'd show Molly's robes flapping in the breeze over his grave. This... doesn't.
Still think C2's animated intro was the best out of all so far.
Oooooooooh!
Personally I don’t like the song. Never did. Both intros visually are subjective. To each their own. Maybe they’re waiting for the campaign to settle in so the characters develop their personalities and iconography before a new animated intro. Maybe they’re not allowed to do that anymore since they have the TV deal. Either way an intro is a minor thing at the end of the day. My last thing is I miss the hell out of Your Turn to Roll…..
Based on other comments, I think people just really want to see the C3 characters animated like they did for C2. I don't think it's necessary and I can understand the expectation, but guys, there are animators out there who already do that and there is also a lot of fan art. CR is full of creative juice. Of course, they're not going to just do the same thing again.
you can rub shit in glitter all you want, at the end of the day, it's still shit
Matt reprising his role as jesus I see
I LOVE THIS!!!! Travis turning into a were wolf is awesome!
...I like it. :) It's colorful, imaginative, and fun to watch. I didn't notice until someone else pointed it out in the comments, but there are easter egg transitions from C2 characters to C3. They're so fast you almost miss them like swinging Yasha's sword and then getting the druid vibes for Ashley. The only one who wasn't clear was Sam's but he's always the outlier and probably just really wanted to surf on a sword...unless it's a hint to his backstory? That's a really fun intro and I think they pulled it off well.
On a scale of 1-10, this is a 1, the former one is a 1.5, and the Mighty Nein (your turn to roll) was a 12. Just bring it back with new animation please!
Great visuals, the audio does not fit at all.
I havent watched season 3 yet because it just did not look good to me but after this I might reconsider
There's an eighties song that this reminds me of, but as I was a small child in the eighties, I can't remember the name of the song or the band.
I’m mixed on the intro because while it’s very cool and the colors are amazing and all the little details are amazing, I’m still obsessed with the original intro. I feel like we didn’t have it for a long enough time. Also, this song is so good! Still so epic! But, Your Turn to Roll will never be topped. I do still miss that intro and that song. But, new campaign, new song, new intro, and all of them are amazing! Love it all! I look forward to an animated intro of the characters once we get far enough into the series!
I feel like they’ve been trying something new with each of the openings theyve done so far. First was indepth realistic cosplays, then it was goofy 80s  outfits, then the iconic animated op, and now we’ve had players exploring the new world and at the actual table and lastly, this style that kinda hybrids the players and their characters (even connecting to past campaigns). Each op is trying to be distinctly different, which is neat, but gods doing the powerful and beloved animated one so early really makes it hard to be really in love with the later ones.
That was... a lot of rotoscoping. I feel like this would have benefitted from being a combination of fully live with animation rather than all animation. 0:52 to 1:05 was particularly uncanny, and it genuinely took me a moment to recognize that as Liam at 1:12. I also found it jarring to see images of other characters in a completely different art style at 1:31.  It feels like they were in too much of a hurry to replace their previous opening...
"ANNNNNND Welcome back!!!"  *raucous laughter*  Seriously though, a great opening montage for sure!

Lacks the soul and fun of the original C3 intro. It makes me ask, "what is CR and what does it mean?". Well done on a technical level anyway, but I find this not resonating with me.
The colors are great, but the characters have a rotoscoping look that makes me want to toss this video into the abyss with tharizdun
I feel like the C2 intro really was the best approach to a critical role episode intro because it actually sets up who the characters are and we can even see the npcs or guest characters at the end of that intro. It felt more fluid and more like a series intro that introduces the characters we'll be following than this intro. I get that the cast is very very important and I love them, but it just feels odd to see the players rather than the player characters who the story follows, and there are nods to the characters they play but the medium of this kind of animation kinda doesnt do it for me. The song is great but isnt anywhere near the kinda thing that the C2 song was and I find myself skipping the intro more than not in the vods. This intro is cool and I do really admire and respect the work thats been put into this, but something just doesnt sit entirely right. Maybe I'll grow to like it, time will tell.  Edit: Also, I dunno for sure since Im not an expert nor do I know anyone personally who has it, but this intro feels like an epilepsy trigger and just feels like a lot, I hope that if they stick with this, they clean it up more in the future.
I'm going to be honest: I'm not a fan of this. Maybe it'll grow on me, but I'm not a fan.
😲
I like how this one has more references to their C3 characters. It feels like the intros to each campaign evolve this way: starting with a more generic "nerds playing D&D" one as nobody knows how the characters are going to play out, one that more subtle reflects the characters (C2's D&D Beyond animation, M9 doing cool stuff but no deep backstory references) until eventually we get one that fully reflects the new party once they establish themselves.
Yeah...not a huge fan of this one. The faces just seem really uncanny valley, the animation style doesn't work for me, and the NPC/old PC characters' heads' floating by randomly at the end just seems weird. I really hope we'll get an animated intro fully based on their characters, like we did in C2.
This one is probably my favorite CR opening, honestly. I think it's cool that we get to see the personality of both the players and the characters in the animation. (Matt DMs using silhouettes of the characters, Laura has copious amounts of dice and purple Imogen magic, Ashley has fire and flowers and has Fearne's ears and horns, Taliesin smashes a crystal with Ashton's hammer, Travis does a werewolf roar and transformation, Sam drinks from his giant gas tank and sorta rolls in, Liam fights with Orym's sword and has vines growing where Orym's vine tattoo is, and Marisha is perched on a chair and then starts oozing Laudna ichor. Not to mention, when they're all at the table each person's energy is just perfectly captured. I think I could actually HEAR Ashley at around 0:51. XD)   There were also a bunch of easter-eggs that I caught, and probably even more that I missed. It's really cool that it looks like they used the actors' signatures for their credits. It feels very Avengers Endgame and I'm all for it. I also I love the chaos of the players' actions through out the opening, especially when set against the beautiful background of stars and/or landscapes and/or pretty color splashes/swirls/patterns/etc. This contrast feels like a metaphor for Critical Role itself, which can leave us both dying laughing and bawling our eyes out; sometimes even in just a single episode.  This is probably my favorite opening song, too. Don't get me wrong, "Roll the Dice" was cool, but I really like some of the harmonies and whatnot on this one. Plus, it's cool that the audio has the ENTIRE cast in it.  (Quick question, though: Does anyone know if Marisha actually sang in this? Or is the only Marisha bit the "You can certainly try"? I thought I heard what could've been her singing voice in the chorus, but they just listed the chorus as "all" so I can't be sure. I would assume "all" includes her, but I was just curious if anyone knew for sure.)
SKOONGA!!!
Neat concept. Doesn’t quite work.
😲
I like the personality and acting as their characters. Very nice!
Rubbish
The animation is great, but I have to agree with a lot of the people in the comments.  I would prefer to see a return to "your turn to roll", this song is just kinda meh.  They really outdid themselves with the intro to C2, and I'm hoping they can find something like that to fit C3
I’m in absolute love with this 🥰🥰
man this makes me a bit sad. i loved the C3 intro! The pure chaos lent itself so well to their playstyle, it gave off so much character. I do like that they spent time and used the animation to bring out more of their game characters like travis turning into a wolf but these stock play session scenes that look like they were put through a very cheap filter to match the animation are just not doing it for me at all. The mismatch in timing doesn't help either. It was absolutely impeccable in the previous one. I'm glad they're trying out new stuff from time to time, it's important to keep things fresh and stay ahead of the curve. But sadly this one is a miss for me.
I like the animation but otherwise im kinda disapointed they reused the song from the old intro. It doesn't really fit in my opinion and makes an otherwise cool animation feel like a drag
well, it's something
The art is absolutely incredible in this opening however i miss the majesty that was matt's hair flowing wildly when he let out his roar and the absolute chaosbat the table that was the previous version.  I do wish that they had done animations of their characters rather than the actors if they were doing an animated opening since we get the actors in the previous version but i still like the opening.  Just feel it's inferior to what we had before.
I’m not going to lie I’m getting tired of people in the comments complaining about how everything Campaign 3 is worse than Campaign 2 (and these are ones with the most likes too) This opening is wonderful and the art is fantastic. The song is also great and I love how everyone has a singing part in it. It’s obvious how much love is being put into this and how CR is constantly producing new things to give to their fans.   And yet some people are so filled up with nostalgia for Campaign 2. Guys it’s literally only been half a year and you’re already comparing the quality of this Campaign to that of Campaign 2 which has over 100 eps? Just stop and enjoy the content.
It’s good
awesome and so artsy, love it. not sure if I love this one more then the first intro for series 3. time will tell. but still awesome work
Omggg this is epicccc!!
Can we have the old one back?
I love how almost everyone was doing something related to their character during their special intro, but Laura was just DICE.  (I mean later when they're all together she's got purple Imogen energy, but I was really only taking about during the special "Laura Bailey" part of the opening. Technically it had purple Imogen energy, too, but Laura did not associate, she was to busy with dice.)
I swear to God, y'all just keep blowing me out of the water! You and the animation team did another phenomenal job here!!!!
Ahahdhdhsjjs this is so cOoOOL
Worst Intro I hope they had a good time doing it
Is there a Mount Pride in Exandria?
This is just pure joy! So amazing!
I find it funny how Sam somehow feels the same, like this is stuff he would just do normally.
I'm getting big Taliesin Jaffe as the next Doctor Who vibes from this, and I like it!
I’m going to be honest, and I mean no disrespect to anyone; this looks very low quality overall. The rotoscoping leaves a lot to be desired, and it just seems “low quality” overall. I would accept this as a fan animation, but as an official intro it’s left me scratching my head.  Again, no disrespect intended. But I can’t help but feel this was a bandaid for the criticism regarding the critiques of the colonialist themes in the original cinematic opening.
This is great, love Travis' fangs, Sam's chugging and Taliesin's swing the most but would love to see them portray their characters more :D So far my favourite intro is still the "live action" version from C3....it has that great energy to it. PS: also loved seeing Sir Bell and Eshteross in this. Much love from Romania, Bells Hells FTW!
This theme just doesn't get me pumped like the others did.
Ohh I like it
Holy fucking shit man
Seeing Dorian pop back up in the intro was so cute
I’m not really feeling it :/ it’s not bad, but c2 just had such a beautiful and amazing opening
This intro is probably the weakest. Season 2 had some great intros that got you excited for the show or could bounce in your head in a fun way. This intro is good from a technical standpoint but falls flat unless you’re watching the live stream. Which to be far are the majority that probably watch the intro. Though I feel like if an intro is engaging a majority of people will not skip it. That has worked for plenty of anime that I have watched over the years.
How have their intros gotten worse since campaign 2
I'm sure a lot of effort went into this, but I personally find the style kind of uncanny valley? Some parts also feel really weirdly synced and poorly directed,, idk I'm not a cinematographer but something about it feels off? I probably just got my hopes up too much bc of how fantastic the C2 animated intro was
Dude, chills. So good.
*Scanner Darkly* rotoscope artstyle
If you were going to change things why not replace the Indiana Jones parody with scenes of their new characters and keep the excellent table reaction shots? Really highlighting the fun and connection between the cast was a good live action choice.   I personally am not a fan of this art style and find it uncanny/ugly but I could get used to it if overall this opening was stronger than the last one…unfortunately it isn’t.   I appreciate you guys trying new things but this was kinda clumsy and didn’t lean hard enough into animating character traits in. I already miss the fun, over the top and excellently edited original C3 intro.
I love it 😍 I never cease to be amazed by CR’s creativity
Love critical role, but this felt extremely lacking as an intro.
Real talk here: It looks beautiful, but it's not the beauty that made C2's intro so amazing.  C1's 1st intro was players larping/cosplaying, it introduced us to players doing dorky RP shit. C1's 2nd intro pulled out the stops, and now we're looking at the characters, actually fighting something, actually swinging swords and shooting bows and blasting lightning bolts at tentacle monsters. C2's 1st intro introduced us to the players again (doubling down on being giant dorks, btw) C2's 2nd intro introduced us to the CHARACTERS; Showing where the characters all came from, how they came together, and even the trials already faced and hints at what they were currently facing. C3's first intro did an amazing job upping the ante, it introduced us to the players, but now focusing less on the dork and more on the RP nature of the experience. Cool.  Again, I cannot stress how beautiful this animation looks. If rotoscoping had looked this good back in the 70s, we might have been able to get by with Ralph Bakshi's LotR. That said, this... felt disjointed? like, okay, we got Talesin swinging a stick that might be a hammerish thing, we got Travis looking a bit scruffy, we got Marisha finger ichor drip... we got Sam doing his gas can bit... and then surfing on a sword which Liam brandished a bit? (seriously, the surfing was fun, but why?) Ashley was out in the beginning, but her and Same felt like they barely evoked their characters at all, it just left me feeling... lacking. I never felt like this introduced the CHARACTERS.  I do dig Matt's "godlike presence" though.
Mmm, I'm gettin' some feelings in ma chesties.
i love it, but the slow motion reaction opening is still priceless
Huge bummer, I'll be skipping the intro until this is swapped out. It's just super uncanny valley and straight up difficult to even watch. I know that they were trying to move past the controversy of the previous intro, but this isn't the way to do it.
I liked the first one better, I get why they chose to change it but the first one felt genuine in it’s approach. It was trying to invoke nostalgia like they did with the 80’s kids intro last season. I get what they are going for in both intros but this one actually gives me a headache.
I like this one a bit more than the one before.   It’s kinda like A-ha’s Take On Me video, but if they used watercolors instead of pencils.
*Insert generic complaint about not being as good as previous intros here*  Can't please any of you kids
Ok that was awesome.
Lovely intro y’all, some cool scenes and moments in this! Big love for all the folks responsible for this art.  That being said… “Adventure awaits! HUZZAH!” is the first and only thing that came to mind watching this.
I'm glad there's a new intro, but why don't all the cast members get the same amount of time? Some get 15 seconds, others only 5?
Looks amazing.
The rotoscope and colors! I miss the character intros like season 2. Those really put me into the show. The song was performed well...
How very Bakshi's Lord of the Rings of you. lol Still not gonna rival Your Turn To Roll's charm, but that IS a big ask.
I miss Dorian
This is BRILLIANT! Love it!
This... this is absolutely wild, I adore it. Holy moly, there are no words to describe how good this looks.
That was fantastic animation and detail. I think stylistically, I prefer the live one but variety is good and this is impressive.
I love this one so much more! Great job cast and anim8rs!
Almost like a best of all the previous intros.
Honestly, least favorite one so far. The bar was ridiculously high though
tacky
Super fancy
Holy fuck, how many hours did this take to get rotoscoped. Like dammmmm!!
Understanding the difficulty of appeasing a large demographic. I dislike this opening as compared to the previous one.  Season two opening was amazing, and I like the live action of the first season 3 opening! Even though it doesn’t really relate to the player characters!  If they had made this opening more relatable to the PC’s it would have been better!
This was so fucking cool
Cool. Just as good as the original opener. Still, nothing is going to come close to beating c2's animated opening. Best song and lyrics, best animation and just as good at episode 140 as it was at episode 44.
I freaking LOVE this intro. Wow.
This looks like they rendered it in 2x frames, realized it looked uncanny, and rendered it in half framerate to try to salvage it... not a fan
Incredible!
Very creative and interesting to watch. I think adding a little sound design through out the whole video would improve it a lot such as a clapping sound of some sort when Matt claps his hands in the beginning or a thud when Marisha jumps from her chair and so on.
Marisha, Liam and Sam really got the short end of the stick on this ehh?
I love it!!!
Oh man this gave me chills. loved how wild the hair was!
I love this, I'm glad they did another one
While I appreciate the artwork and colors. I found that the perspective and camera angels of this made me dizzy. I feel that the previous intro was a lot smoother, and it didn't feel as "rushed." I also think that with the previous intro it better explained "What and Who is Critical Role." If someone was watching this for the first time it doesn't really make sense. I don't hate this but I don't love it either.
So glad they kept the flaming d20 at the end. Classic
Tallison gives of some serious gargamel vibes
My favorite intro will still be the cosplay intro I wish they would do that again
It's not bad, but I loved the other one and hope they interchange them.  Super glad they kept the song, which would have been a crime to change already.
Can't say I like the animation here, something seems a little off. There's also some sharp disorienting cuts in Laura's section. But the animation is still quite impressive well done, and I hope they really like it! Doesn't really matter what I think  Also, I did like Taliesin's part pretty well.
This is a million times better than the original C3 intro.
Beautiful excited for more DND <33 love the animation style!
This song is way better at 1.25x tbh.
I like how Matt is portrayed like a god
I like this intro better then the previous one… but the song is still just not hitting. And neither come anywhere near the M9 intro and song.
This is one of the best things I've ever witnessed in my life, actual chills!
These comments are wack, man. This is incredible!!! I love the colors and the vibe and the animation is super fun and unique!! This is such a vibe
For all the people saying the c2 intro was better: it's still up. You can still watch it. But this is the literal translation of "apples and oranges". CR as a show, as a company, and as a cast&crew is different to how it was when the c2 animated intro came out. You're not saying one is objectively better, you're saying that you aesthetically prefer one more. And there's nothing wrong with that. I prefer c2 intro and song. But that doesn't mean this isn't brilliant. Comparing them at a 1-to-1 is fallacious.
It's  not easy to top "Your Turn to Roll" but this could grow on me.
The lyrics still just aren't working for me. Also I think this intro is a little too self-indulgent. The shots on everyone take too long once they've been established, and if there is a blend of animation and live action then wouldn't it be better to have everyone turn into their character more rather than less. That way everyone who just tunes in for the first time really gets an idea who is playing whom.
I kindaaaa don't like iiit? Nothing on the animators/editors.. just, not really what I would choose as the opening credits... I think rotoscoping 95% of it was not the way to go.
Personally I prefer the live action one. This one just doesn't quite fit the song though the rotoscoping is pretty cool.
This was fantastic!! Feels unique and they did a great split of real actors with characters ♡
Laura’s dice obsession is strong in this one
good intro, good song. love the vibrant colors and i honestly enjoyed the rotoscoping. a VAST improvement over the first c3 intro.
what do you do with the money😭
C’mon that is f***ing sick! Nice job team…
Anyone else get "take on me" vibes from this new rotoscope stuff
So who here is gonna start manufacturing  Sword Shaped Snowboards?! Cuz I'm ready to pre-order 🏂🥶
I love it!
I like a lot about this, and I'm aware of the controversy of the old opening for this campaign, but this one is kinda hard to watch at times with the visual effects (especially the Dr. Who tunnel) and the jittery animation cuts.
I love how it transitions from Liam/Orym's sword with leaves to Marisha. Seems like a subtle nod to his character's connection to Keyleth.
This is beautiful and I love this song but nothing will ever beat Your Turn to Roll with the animated opening. Y'all set the bar wayyyy too high with that one.
This is interesting to see, but this is not as good as the current real campaign 3 intro by a LONG shot. And both versions pale compared to your turn to roll from campaign 2.
I'm sure the new intro will grow on me eventually but one small nitpick is I would have enjoyed seeing the images of all the actors transition into their gameplay characters at some point in the intro. On a second watch through though I am catching more of the suggestions of their characters in the animation (the first time around I only noticed Marisha/Laudna's power and Ashley/Fearne's) which I do appreciate. And I do like the various transitions from actor to actor. A little uncanny valley at times though. I'll still miss the original visuals for a while but the song is a banger either way and I appreciate the work that must have gone into this.
This isn’t it, sorry :(
Yep old one was better
Sorry, I really want to like this new song but I don't.  Changing the video portion still doesn't do it for me.  C2's theme song (and video) spoiled me, I guess.  Probably doesn't help that I was really looking forward to seeing the characters in the intro video and, while some of their traits are present, they, themselves, are not :(
I know a lot of people are criticizing but I love it!! Love that we constantly get new intros
I don't hate it but I wish we had more of a look at the characters instead of the cast. We're already gonna spend 4 hours looking at their faces, why not show us the thing we're trying to imagine in our heads that whole time?
Would have been funny to see Travis scaled down to gnome size. In the "Hero Reveal" at the end.
i hate this intro
I will never get tired of Sam regals ginormous cantine it looks so amazing
Hell yeah.
*Let's have a movement of silence for legends in the world. Past, present, and future. Rest in peace, Techno*
This is the best kind of madness!❤️
Ok I did not think I would like this one as I really enjoyed the 1ste one but damn that was good. Another good opening guys.
im soo glad the other intros done   this  is  by far the best one
WHY is it when ever  i see these friends together in any form im so happy i cry tears of joy
this was amazing!!
Very Waking Life vibes
We did it boys, we finally got Dorian immortalised in the CR intro
Wat. That rad
Congratulations for the new intro, guys. I must say that this is not my cup of tea tho, but i try to respect other people's job whatsoever. That being said, the part with Liam executing some Orym maneuvers was dope as fuk!
Rotoscoping is absolutely SUCH a pain to do, so it pains me even more for the artists who had to do it when I say this intro just doesn't do it for me... It's just so choppy and doesn't really seem to have any rhyme or reason for being rotoscoped vs live action or fully animated.
this song is just as bad as when it released sorry
this is sooo amazing!
Rotoscoping is kinda cheating in the world of animation, but it's a style. I agree with the others that it didn't line up to the music well. I'd give it a solid 6/10 compared to the other intros. Matt looked great as usual, so a bonus point there. haha
Travis in the Strongjaw Ale shirt is iconic
umm I'm only on episode 2, so I don't know, but where's the bard?
Y'know... I don't even know how I ended up here.  One day you're saying "nah... that's too nerdy for me" and the next day your heart skips a beat because Laudna broke Imogen's rock.
This is awesome!
SPICY
LOVE IT!  Love the little shifts of characters into the player animations.
This is incredible!!!! This animation is absolutely GORGEOUS. The motion and mannerisms of each player are so perfect! And I love the clever little nods to past campaigns in some of those transitions. ;) Truly stunning work you guys. Now pardon me while I go work on my animation skills because DANGIT that was inspiring.
HOLY SHIT! THIS INTRO IS FRACKING ROTOSCOPED!
I.... genuinely don't like this version. I don't hate it but it looks messy. And feels a little lazy. I love the colours, and what I *think* the basic concept is awesome, but I really don't like this version of the intro.
Okay this animation is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!!!!! Love it!
I LOVE IT!!! AHHHHHHHHH!!!!
Interesting take on a theme.  Definitely not a personal favorite.  Actually pretty low on the list. Some will obviously find it appealing.  And it also doesn't offend that I can see...  So...  Okay.
Wow this is horrible, like what the hell were they thinking with this.  THis looks like a college freshman's first every project.  Just an absolute shame that they decided this was okay to go with.
Little disappointed that the animation doesn’t really match the songs lyrics. It’s beautiful rotoscope though
No one cares which version you like best.
Aw, cute!  Love it!
critical role: the telltale series
Dope
I! love! It!
I enjoy this opening more so than the first one for this season, the attention of subtle detail to everyone's character and the animation makes it so good! well done, I hope the cast and crew are happy and proud to see this all come to life :D  is it Thursday yet?
Do not like this intro that much. Not saying it isn’t good but not my taste. The live action one is way better and the M9 one is even better.
1:30 Y'all KNOW the DM scene is going to fill up with NPCs and guest characters throughout the campaign and i'm here for it!
I like the old version, but this one is cool too. The song gets me every time lol
Bad
very nicely done!
im convinced they are trying to collect a opening title in each and every one of the best old commercial styles that exist and i love it
God damn, good thing they saved Marisha for last cause I got heat stroke that was so hawt.   But for real, this is awesome and I love it
OMG omg omg omg omg omg omg incredible job y'all. Be proud and cannot wait to see what comes next!
I love that they have aspects of their characters in their animated selves
oh my word what happened to the faces at the end
TLDR - New intro feels rushed, unfinished and unsynced at times i hope this was a just a draft for opinions  eh not a fan of this one honestly i think its the first miss. song still rocks but wouldve been okay with a more "dnd beyond intro" style or just the players doing actions. the whole thing feels like they were 1/4 of the way done animating a great intro and rushed to throw this ou because calamity was over. some parts are cool and whoever did the animations you work is def good. kinda wish they would've waited to release one full pollished.
Bring back the live action version!
I miss the old one, this just isnt it, but they included dorian so i guess it gets a pass from me
A Scanner Darkly and Waking Life up in here
I love the colors! But I will miss the chaos at the table because the cinematography was just 🤌🏽 on the last intro. Thought it would stick around longer.
Liam’s and marisha’s are the coolest
I love those, but I was looking forward to seeing guest stars dressed up like explorers.
People are being overall positive and supportive along with their criticism in the comments section. This is to be expected by the (mostly) nice community that are The Critters, but the fact that this overly nice community still has shit to say about it really drives home the point - This intro is a hard miss. It lacks quality and polish and the good art direction we've come to expect from Critical Role. Hope they change back to live action one or come out with a properly animated one soon, because this is rather jarring and uncanny to watch.
I like it because you were able to add a bit more about their characters representation to the animation... 🔥👏🏾👍🏾great job
Might there be copyright issues for style of animation of characters for cr since the prime tv show, or is that a reach? I know nothing about these things
Oh... They had Bertrand in the title card now. YES! Also. I love this intro.
Bring back the live action one please. I liked it far better. This was too much colour about nothing, whereas the live action was the team in the adventure - it was awesome!
Probably an artistic choice but the frame rate feels to low
This is so sick I absolutely love it
Kind of odd, and I like it a whole lot better than I liked the original opening.  I just thought there was a huge disconnect between High Fantasy and Indiana Jones.
I'm still on C2 but I can't wait to get to C3
Sorry. Not a fan of this new treatment of the intro. Much preferred the first one.
As much as everyone loved Your Turn to Roll (me included), I'm glad they're updating the intro here and there.
This is fantastic I can’t stop smiling while watching this
How did they manage to make Taliesin look like british comedian Greg Davies
I really like the theme song for this campaign and thought it would be so cool to see brought into a character animation style. Maybe with travis still being unsure about chetney they didn’t want to do that just yet but they still have his werewolf aspects shown here so not sure! Just would have been so cool and they could have adapted it like they did for the final arc of C2 with mollys empty grace after lucien came along - would have been really awesome!
This is a big artistic swing and I applaud them so much for that! There are some really cool things in it. I also hope we'll get a character focused intro later on in the campaign, I love those.
I'll be that guy and say this is a step down from the first opening imo. And its mostly because of the rotoscoping.
I really really like this! It’s amazing that we get all kinds of great art from these people for FREE. Thank you!
OMG
omg this is seriously badass!
My not crying 😭
Rotoscoping (drawing over pictures/video to animate) is very uncanny valley and feels cheap but also funny as heck so xD Keep it up, proud of you
At first, I got stoked to see the animated characters. As it stands though, the rotoscoping is neat and the colors are pretty, but I much prefer the live action intro.
If anyone is wondering why they changed the intro so fast and why it seems "half-baked," there was actually a controversy concerning the previous intro, which got brought into light more because Brian got dragged into it. We are still too early for a fully animated intro with the actual characters like in C2 which aired much later in the campaign.  If anyone's wondering of the controversy, it is because of the explorer outfit's that was worn by colonizers who colonized the Middle Eastern/ North African countries that that world of Campaign 3 was based on, with some of the people from those countries who criticized the intro getting censured by majority of the fandom. As a person from a country who was colonized by these people, I personally was not bothered and I understand that it is "reaching" to be a big deal since it's obviously took inspiration from pop culture explorer's which we grew up with (tho those are also seen as controversial).  **BUT!** It is perfectly understandable for the crew, especially Matt, to want to do truly right for the countries, with all their culture and history, that they took all of their inspiration from. Even if it was not a big deal and they meant well, it would really suck to accidentally miss an aspect of something you really dedicated your world to.
Not gonna lie, this ones a bit of an L for them. It's just meh, like the original C2 intro. I thought their last one was ten times better
I prefer the previous C3 intro. The music does not align with anything happening within the video... as many pointed out, it seems the sound and visuals are out of sync.   Maybe my opinion will change once that is fixed, however for now, my opinion stands where it is.
The thumbnail looks like Metalocalypse from a distance, lol
not a big fan of either of the C3 intros, the song isn’t as fun and why aren’t they putting the actual characters in the animation? i would think if they had the budget for animation they’d want to animate the characters not the actual people we can see move around and be real any time we want.
I think they've gone and gotten just a little bit full of themselves. How far we've come from the simple, homestyle games we all once loved. Now, there is no chat, little interaction with the fans, rare charity drives, and so on. Sure the audio quality is better, and the performances more streamlined, but how much did we all give up on the way? We had a fully crowd funded animated series, but they immediately sold out to Amazon, rather than trusting in the fans to keep them afloat. Like the Sun Tree, I find myself wondering if the roots are even there anymore.
thats dope. love it
Chills
This is absolutely epic <3
sadly this ended up looking super jank, especially the rotoscoped faces, the music is off or just copy pasted over it, and this laggy psychedelic trip doesn't fit at all with the show. I love the character elements coming through (wish they showed more pronounced), and certain parts like Liam's or Ashley's turned out okay, but this needs a lot of work. Or maybe just a straight redo.
Very very cool!
Love love love this 🌈
Awesome!
All I have to say is... DUUUUUUDDDDDEEEEE!!!!!!!
I love it, it's new and colorful. Does need a bit of a rework to sync the song to the animation I think but that's easily done and if not, it's still awesome. Whoever the artist(s) were for this have some real talent.
🤢🤢🤮🤮
I really liked the first intro, but this one is cool too.
Holy shit its good
Not a fan of this.
NO opening will replace "Roll Roll Roll Roll" to me. I used to sing it every time you aired. And the video of the theater singing it for you almost brings tears to my eyes every time. Please bring it back?
Cold as fuck
I love it so much OMG
This is....bad.
This is REALLY COOL!!!!! But also creeps me out a little. Fever dreamy
Y'all are one of my personal faves!  :)
I’m sure it will grow on me. But I’m gonna be honest… I don’t like this one so much. Idk why it’s just not hitting quite right on first watch. I’ll watch a few more times to see if that changes Edit:1 after only a second watch, it’s already growing on me. Still not sure how I feel about the art style. I reminds me of watercolor paint, but seeing it animated feels off. Idk. But I can say I absolutely love it now.
7/10, it would get 12 points from UK in the Eurovision.
Waaaaa se re zarparon
This opening is awful, like someone said "I have cool filters on my phone I can use" What was wrong with the cool fantasy set you made and filmed? OR that cool after school one you did for campaign 2 and then abandoned for animation?
Yeah, the problem was not the visual .
This is very cool
I, didn’t hate it to be honest. I feel like a lot of folk just can’t get over mighty neins intro. Which, valid. But I enjoyed it
Oh man! That was so good! I really enjoyed that intro! You guys make me so sad though… I don’t have anyone near me that wants to play dnd…
I'm gunna be real this is really painful to watch. Love CR and this is just my feelings on this intro.
I hate to down on people's work, but.. It.. is so uncanny it makes me look away from the screen. This makes me physically uncomfortable to watch, the low framerate is strange and it doesn't match the movements, it just..   What was wrong with the old one? It was so pretty.
Oh I hate this. Such an uncanny valley effect from the faces just puts me off
Conceptually great. But the framerate on it seems a bit off and choppy.
I feel like this intro was unnecessary since we just had a new one not long ago. But it is pretty, minus some creepy uncanny valley moments. Good on you guys for having your fun!
Eh
They way they did Matt is amazing. I never thought I’d be so invested.
No offense, but it just doesn’t really hit right?? Someone mentioned the synching with the music being off, which might be part of it, but I feel like the slowed down(?) music doesn’t help either, the visuals have so much energy but the music doesn’t. I feel like the live action version had more characterization with the outfits somewhat matching the characters or at least the same theme.
Wait, how often are they going to change the intro?
I think we can all agree that Matt looks majestic in this opening
I'll miss Matt's face when he roars from original.
My guys...Yall are killing it with this shit! Damn with the intros and new songs I am overwhelmed! Yall are fucking amazing at this stuff!
It isn’t a bad opening, but it’s no M9 opening. I think there’s something more about connecting with the characters rather than the players. I loved watching just a snippet of M9 characters in a setting, interacting with each other and showing off their fight styles. Hopefully the next one is more like that
nope
What will mother fuckers find to cry about this time?
Is this a Joel Haver Film?
if I may say.... Perfect. I don't know about anyone else but this is what I see in my head while I'm watching and listing their videos. simply beautiful.
0:13 ah yes my favourite type of dice, a D1
I don't know why but I got chills watching this. I think the colors hit my brain in a weird way
Omg I love this so much
I love it
With a bit of improvement on the sync, this could potentially be their best intro!
Personally I don't love it.  The song I still love but it doesn't really fit with the animation.  Still love CR but this one was a miss for me.
I love you guys soooo much. The concept and artistry here are excellent. Probably not quite as well done as the previous version, except that you’ve ensured that the imagery used is considerate toward all audiences. I don’t find fault in honest oversight, but is very meaningful how y’all always go the extra mile to be respectful.
It's pretty and artistic, but I am not a fan of rotoscope animation.  I tried to enjoy it, but I really can't.  I get that some people like the look of it, but it's too deep of a trek into the uncanny valley for me.  But my schedule doesn't allow me to watch live anyway, so I will just fast forward through it until the character animated intro comes out (please make it soon!), and if I have an itch to listen to the song, the original version is still on YouTube.
I thought it was good was thinking they were going to do kinda mirror the player with their character or doing a sort of blending of pc and character
Oh man, I love the rotoscoped animation and the colors! It's fantastic!
Pretty cool but I definitely prefer the live action intro. There was some backlash about it having colonialist imagery I wonder if that contributed to them changing it.
It must have been so fun to film the stuff for this
I'll never understand why yall decided you needed another opening song for this campaign...also this intro is an odd choice...feel like a 80s music video rebranded but worse
This is so cool
There should have been a trigger warning for epileptic people. The flashing colours hurt my eyes a bit, I can only imagine how someone with it would feel
Is it all getting just a bit too 'professional'.  I liked the homebrew feel. Is it becoming too Critical role inc even though it is sort of I realise.  I want the snacking and the occasional belch back, running out to the loo, and people coming in late.    Still rate it although it is becoming just a TV show now.  Hey times move on and I've just got to get over it.
This is very much...a vibe. It's not really idk, my vibe. Like it looks great, and whoever did a an amazing job. With another narrative, or just just by itself without context this would be stellar. This just feels very upbeat and happy, and doesn't feel like it matches the darker tone of C3 or the characters that well. I really loved the chaos and more overall gothic(art style) of the live action one spliced with the exploration theming that seemed to fit the tone of C3 better.
i guess what hooked me in C2's opening title was that you got to see more of how the characters interacted vs how the players looked. we see the players regularly in watching the show and its our collective imagination that builds that world around us but to have a visual identity with each character, between seeing knot run into an alleyway or jester playing with the traveler, it gave us a visual ground to stand on. now in C3 we are seeing the players and the characters act out their roles as if theyre the same and while an argument can be made that they are since it is DND, it still makes it hard for me, a viewer to connect with them on a fantasy level and therefore a personal level. And i understand as VAs you want to be seen more than heard, but to me, and maybe im wrong, idk, but to me, you are AMAZING VAs because you bring life into existence with your voices, you dont NEED to be seen. we love you for everything youve done and brought into the world and shaped the community but after setting the bar so high from C2 opening sequence, its hard to meet it in C3
This was probably made to replace the old one because people from united states are fucking stupid and always find a reason to complain about everything and make everything about race, etc
I feel guilty for not liking this one...
Incredible. Great job everyone and extra kudos to the animation team.
the floating heads at 1:30
I loved the previous one also, but this one, holy shit!
I probably think Sam got too little time on cam (?) but still, gorgeous
its ok. campaign 2s intro song and video are 100x better still tho
ew...
I love the new theme, it does look really nice but your turn to roll is like. top notch no beating it imo, your turn to roll was a masterpiece
Who cares if it hits or not…….. THIS IS THE SAME CRITICAL ROLE!!! TURSDAY NIGHTS ROCK!
Am I missing something??? Everyone is critiquing this and it is AWESOME! People were losing their minds during the stream last night. What I love is that the cast comes first with their characters hinted at. Ok, your turn to roll may was PERFECT, but this is incredible in a different way.
I really like that they changed opening after the disrespect to the SWANA people (known or unknown) in the last openings visuals
I thought the point of an animated intro was to see the characters.... this is dumb. Also looks like it was made with a bad instagram filter on.
"You can certainly try 😏"
This is cool, but I do not think anything will top the animated "Your Turn to Roll" intro. It is a neat animation style, but I like the previous C3 opening more, this is probably the CR opening I like the least.
These opening gives tones of fantasy vibes 🧝🏿‍♀️🧜🏽‍♂️🧛🏻🧞🧟‍♂️🧙‍♂️🧚‍♀️
Thank you, Critical Role, for the amazing stories and music.
Did they change to this cause of the colonialism issue?
I love it :)
It looks a little off throughout. It would also be nice at least at the end when they are all standing together to have a ghostly image of their characters looking out from behind and above them. Since it seems like the point is they are playing these characters so well aspects of them can be seen. Would both give a good background image that could be used a nice what for anyone watching to imagine the characters better.  I think it is because the faces seem to have different amount of quality they were done to. Both between them and from start to finish.
This gave me chills down to my critical role
SMOKING hot.
It was okay. I like the previous version (early 20th Century explorers vibe) much better.
Rotoscooooope
Maybe it's the audio sync alone that's dragging it down, but I'm not a huge fan of the final product. Def. enjoyed the original more. This video feels sort of rushed tbh.
Super cool! I was really excited for Laudna's part, they could have gone really dark and I was here for it. Not as much as I would have liked, but everything was a little... Bland? Like, Travis' werewolf part could have been a bit more exaggerated. Maybe that's just me though.
I actually rly like it. I feel this one is more for the cast and it won't be as popular for fans, which is fine. They shouldn't try to the same thing over and over, so I am really thrilled to see they are experimenting. Its artistic and different. This also applies to the campaign, which is (as far as I watched) more relaxed and quirky than m9. The scene at 0:55 blew me away. The song is different as well, less hype and more esoteric (idk the right word, but I sense Arabian Nights vibes from it)
All of you are my babies. I will not elaborate
SOOOO FREAKIN COOOOLL
This is just epic! I have no other words, spectacular!
I feel like a lot of people here are missing the point. They talk about the music, about the colors, about the style, but they miss the message. C2's intro was incredibly lanimated due to the spirit of the animated series and what the cast was struggling with at the time. But this, BUT THIS ONE it is much more personal. It shows small details of the characters they have played in their campaigns, but more than anything it shows THE PERSON BEHIND THE CHARACTER.  This intro shows them exploring their fantasy worlds, the ordinary person who is capable of dreaming like each of us, continuing the message that Matt has always tried to convey: We can all dream and create something wonderful.  Honestly, I know it may not be to everyone's taste, but I loved it.
Even in an an animated intro Marisha is climbing the furniture <3
If only Critical Role was animated, then I would watch it.
should have had sam an liam hold hands at the end would have been great
Eh, even thought it seems to have had alot of work put into it, it isn't very good.
Love this! Kinda made me emotional to see the mini 'character moments', because I've really missed these characters in the past month <3
Someone is 3 months late with the April Fools joke...
MAJOR SPOILERS!!!! ... ... ... ... ... Well, there it is Critters! FINALLY!!! The secret HIDDEN EASTER EGG teaser for the REAL over-arching villain for the whole of Exandria has made the titles!!!!! 😱😱😱  Check it out at 1:21!!!!  🪑  We all KNEW it was true!!!
I heckin' love this! ❤️
I dunno, this intro is... I have the same problem with it that I had with the last one. It's like you've bought into your own hype so much you're celebrating the hype, and not what makes this show great. You're not reveling in the game or the characters or any of that. I know some people worked hard on this, and it shows, but it feels like a giant miss to me, just like the last intro.
I really like the art style. It's creative and fresh.
Haven't enjoyed the Campaign 3 intros or EXU ones so far.  The production values have been great, but they're just not themed to the story/characters.  The ideal to me is something like Campaign 2's animated intro which was amazeballs on all levels (quality, related to story, and even the song mentioned parts of the story).  The only way to go beyond that would be to go full-on anime (not in style, but by including symbolic foreshadowing, like if two characters start as friends but drift apart and eventually come back together, then at the start of the intro they're just physically walking away from each other or turned away, but by the end they're together again  If that's too expensive, I'd much prefer just backing down on the quality level but still being story/character focused.  Even Legends of the Multiverse's simple intro is fine to me (basically they take the character key art and use wiggle-animation and translation to make it not feel totally still).  It could be worth mentioning that I'd have been fine with Campaign 2's intro not changing the Mollymauk sequence.  Meaning one reason they might've made the intros less story-specific was over the costs regarding changing that part of the intro, but I'd just much rather have a really good intro that maybe wasn't 100% relevant to the current story than generic shots of stained glass.
I love the personal touches that each of the players has with their current character.  I almost expected Travis to go full werewolf for a minute!
Not going to lie, this doesn’t speak out loud to me. The first intro is way more entertaining. This new intro, I enjoy the color concept and it feels different, but it’s definitely not up to par with the first intro. I feel bad even saying it, since they always put out bangers ya know.
This new intro is bad a**, I love how they've Incorporated the characters history and development thus far.    Also, I love Mercer's opening clap like he's setting off the Big Bang !
Jesus! Wonderful again. I do love this party of beautiful people so much.
Nice. Twitter freaks complain about cultural appropriation of the good one so they cave again and make another one. When are you guys gonna grow some balls?
Gives me really strong vibes of Pink Floyd's "The Wall" movie animations.  Cool to see the new intro :D.
man, really wishin I could see that like/dislike ratio right about now
This is fucking cool
Everyone complaining that they'd rather have an animated intro with the characters, it's way too soon for that! We barely know anything about them. I doubt we'll get anything like that untill _at least_ 40-50 episodes deep. That way it can have all those tiny little character details we all love and obsess over that tend to accumulate over a longer period of time. We'll go to interesting new places, We might meet some families, maybe get some pets, make some new enemies, have more backstory reveals, somebody might die...
I like it but I hope they didn’t change just because of the shit they were getting for the last version
Wtf, where is Sam?
I am really sorry to be THAT guy, but: I am a big fan of animation, any kind of it and the opening to CR campaign 2 was amazing, this one... I just prefer even the old one with live action... It kinda looks uncanny and I would have very much preferred if you could portrait the character played instead of the ones who played it. Hope this comment is just something to push you to do something better, no disrespect to those who worked on it, I just wished it was different.
Matt slamming the book shut at the end was EPIC! I loved the character details. ♥
Shivers and goosebumps! Omg!
Not to be too negative, but this one clearly lacks some polish & fine-tuning :/ The colors are amazing, but the rotoscoping looks stiff, choppy & is off-beat.
I wish it was the player morphing into the animated character. That would have been cool.
That was so effing dope!!! Extremely well done and balanced!
Huzzah
While the coloration is amazing, I am not a huge fan of the low frame rate style along with the overall filtered effect. I do love incorporating each character’s theme in with the player. But I think it just doesn’t push the envelope far enough.  I really miss the slow motion exaggerated expressions of the jungle into when everyone is around the table.  And overall I think the song fits the previous intro far better. This one feels like it was made to a different piece of music.  But please take this criticism with a grain of salt, as it is still impressive!
This was good. Really like the song. Video is pretty good. Lot of people comparing this to S2 which isn’t fair. We’re gonna need a lot more episodes before they can do a fleshed out piece like that. Not to mention that one was just a masterpiece and took us all by surprise. Also gotta love people saying they prefer the first season 3 intro when CR got so much hate for that intro when they released it.
Actually pretty fuckin' corny. Didnt like.
That was so incredibly well made.
The fact that it's become a "generic Critical Role episode opening" and not based on the characters in the campaign is another part of the reason C3 isn't hitting for me like the other two did. Everything is too professional now, it's lost it's vibe of "friends doing fun things" and feels extremely like "IT WILL BE CHEAPER AND EASIER TO HAVE ONE GENERIC INTRO FOR EVERYTHING".  No offense to the group ofc, it IS a huge business now.
We've already changed the opening after just 20 episodes? That seems so premature. It's not like the first opening wasn't fitting. This isn't really an opening I'm enticed to watch, for me this is a "Skip Intro" theme :/
Love the song, I prefer the live action version. Which I have watched many times. This one is good but it’s missing something.
Nice job!  I like it.  Would love to see the intro song redone to shades of Take On Me by A-ha.  Thur... sday... night
Liked the old one better. Sorry. People worked hard on this more "correct" video, but the other one was absolute perfection. It's paint over film, not animation.
I love this new intro! It's so cool!
Nope, needs to be inspired by the campaign itself, like the M9 intro.
Niiiiiiice, o love rotoscoped stuff
definitely flows a lot better on silent, when the sync issue is fixed it'll be better. That being said, not the biggest fan of the rotoscoping. If you're gonna go animation you should do the characters, if they wanted to be in it be live action
Not bad! Looking forward to the C3 anime intro around Episode 60 though.
kind of cringe 😬
How can y'all in the company see this and still decide to release it into the world...
This is really cool!
I hope they didn't pay a lot for this extremely basic photoshop filter.
This is the qualit that the most grossing twitch stream in the world can provide...
tbh this is one of the worst intros in terms of animation and theming.. It's best when the characters themselves are on display and, as mentioned by people much more talented than me in the comments, the animation could use a lot of work.
Eh. Its cool, but the live action version is way better x
I miss the old one...this one is okay and I'm sure the artists put in alot of work, but its just....not as good
It feels so weirdly corporate and disconnected from the feel. 🤷‍♂️ miss for me
OH damn oh damn oh DAMN
This one is a miss for me. I'm sure if this style appeals to you it is great (No need to tell me I'm wrong lol) but it seems to be a step backwards to me. Maybe when everyone was younger and had sharper lines to their faces but the amount of psuedo fat necks in this makes everyone look like the REALLY enjoyed their break.
They've got plenty of time to polish it up in future episodes. Maybe it'll become a running gag to have one thing change about the intro every week.
The sync is fine. The animation is fine. Fine work.  Fine. Fine. Fine. Thanks 🍷
Awesome touch with Mr storm
I love this! All intros they've had have been different and unique. Love the bold colours and the character depictions made by using just a few small details.
yes! YES! Y E S YES!
I love yall but holy crap this is straight nightmare fuel..
The artwork is amazing and really speaks for their individual styles
Amazing visually, but I feel the jumanji style opening was epic especially when Matt's and Liam's lines hit.
A lot of negative comments in here. That's a shame. I like it. I like the song, I like the first intro too. It's all awesome.
Honestly, it's weird as hell, but I like it. I appreciate that they're doing fun experimental art (With their extra things, leave the Main Campaign alone!, if it ain't broke don't fix it). I think I would have liked if there was a little bit more about their powers, like the Travis/werewolf Marisha/black goop Laura/purple glow stuff for the others, and if it lingered slightly longer. I liked Liam with the Sword and Tal with the hammer, maybe they could have flashed FCG'S eye's over Sam's or something, or make his skin look metalic for a second, I mean if you're already in the uncanney valley you might as well dig in lol. It could have been like how they did it with Ashley even, just a light sketch of the details for a second, blink and you miss it 0:30 which I do kind of like. Also Matt looks great in this. And the colors are gorgeous. The bright galaxy bursting forth when he claps his hands is really cool. And for people complaining and comparing to "Your turn to roll" I highly doubt this is the "Final" intro and once the characters are established enough I'm sure we'll get an animated open with them in it. But it's way to early for that. We barely know them!
Love the new animation, but I’m afraid to say the song still makes me cringe. It’s just so *earnest*.
Was having a hard time figuring out who was the third "guest" PC before Dusk. Then I realized it was no PC, it was -beefcake- grandaddy Eshteross.
This was awesome! Although I love the OG just as much - I’m a Indiana Jones kid
Well you put production value into it... but it's really not my thing... I still likes the campaign 2 theme way more. and the animation here...it just doesn't seem to match the tone and mood of the song at all...
I like the concept but this needed more time in the oven.
Not really a fan, tbh. With how big CR is at this point, and the amount of quality output, I expect a lot higher quality production value and quality. Now that we're ~25 episodes into s3, we have a good feel for the characters' personalities, and it would have been infinitely nicer to see either a more s1-style cast-cosplay or a s2-style animated style intro. Even the s3 jungle intro, while not very representative of the characters, felt nicer than this; it, at least, gave the feeling of intrigue and discovery, and had SO MUCH cast personality into every inch of it. This just feels like the cast awkwardly doing stuff that sometimes represents their characters, sometimes doesn't, and not in a funny-fun-awkward way, just plain awkward. Oh well.
SO FUCKING COOL
Sorry, but the original, live action version is far better in my opinion.  I always watched it in the VoDs, but this one I'll be tempted to skip past.
This slaps so hard for me personally 🔥
Why do I feel like this new opening was made in order to deal with the "controversy" that people drummed up over the other one?
Honestly… I love the new intro. The colors look amazing, I love the hints to their characters, and the bit at the end where we can see the past PCs and Matt’s NPCs are great!
I love it... Now, how long until someone tries to say this is racist for some odd reason...
I think I might have appreciated this a lot more if it had a new song that it was synced to, because right now it hits me right in the pet peeve of not matching exactly with the beats. Also animation allows you to push things so much further? If you're gonna have live action rotocoping bits it would be a lot more interesting to go all out in magical girl transforming the players into the characters instead of just having a mild nod to it.  I recognize the amount of time this takes because animation is a bitch, but overall I am not impressed. Not when I have the live action version to directly compare it with.
HOT DAMN I love you all!
Not all of the openings can be winners, I suppose. I wonder if we'll be getting new ones throughout this campaign?
Aww so cool
Really loving this new intro animation! Each new one is so unique and awesome in a different way
Much much prefer the original C3 opening. This one is really missing something...it feels...offf
Neat
Does anyone know why they changed the old intro? I really liked it. Almost every comment I’ve seen about this new intro is negative.   I’m pretty sure they changed it because there is some colonialist ideology tied up in the explorer aesthetic they were going for. If that was such a problem I don’t understand why they couldn’t have just refilmed that and kept the other stuff?  I don’t like this one but it doesn’t really matter, it doesn’t change much about the actual show.
Cool, but doesn't hit as well as the live action one. I still think that Campaign 2's intro is better.
They should really concentrate on characters, not on the players. M9 intro was magical, in part because it was depicting the adventure itself, not the people siting behind table. Don't get me wrong, they are amazing people, but this show is not about them. It's about the personas that they create inside the world of the game.
goddamn y'all
It's interesting, but I prefer (and already miss) the live action C3 starting.
Just lovin it.
This is beautifully done. No art is every going to be perfect and that also goes for animation. Let's appreciate the work they have done here. It's incredible and further appreciate the imperfections. I can only imagine the time, effort and resources they invested into this. Once again it's beautiful. Thank you to everyone who worked on this and for sharing it with us all. We love you guys and wish you many more wonderful years Critical Role (everyone involved). Thank you thank you thank you! Have an awesome weekend, you all earned it!
I was wondering if they were going to try to put together another intro after all the thumbs down about some of the things the players were wearing.
It’s like if C1 and C2 intros had a baby and I’m loving it
I like it! It is fun and colorful.
This ones to happy, no hook, I like the original from season 1 and 2 better hook and you can really sing along with it
Why wasn't sam riding a unicycle or holding a grappling hook or a buzzsaw?
Love this.
What was wrong with the first one? This is cool but doesnt put a smile on my face like the first one.
artstyle is creepy as hell
0:52 - 1:05 The table reactions was my favourite part, Liam was totally giving me Chris Evans vibes (Rocking back in a chair laughing) And Marisha with her getting in people's space and hitty, slappy ways lol. Marisha's hero's pose landing was awesome too :)
more flames more flames more flames Wooooooooo
Gorgeous animation. Holy poop.
Amazing!!! Love the music and the animation!
This huffs farts.
Man, that initial footage of Sam Riegel just looks WRONG! Now I'm wondering if all of this was animated or if parts were CG altered from actual footage (such as when they were all gesticulating around the table, that looked too real to be purely animated)
I think I liked the other one waaaay better
2 reasons i like the video A. Sexy matt B. Marissa drawn slapping and touching people at the table, true to her personality 😄
This is fucking terrible, I’ve always loved the others, but This. Is. Fucking. Terrible.
I like it better than the "old" C3 one, for sure. But nothing can beat the M9 one (for me) ^^
Liam, Travis, and Taliesins intros are really the best things about this intro. Glad to see others in the comments saying that the music doesn't match, because that was my biggest issue. Feels off and not as epic. C2 M9 animated intro has never been topped for me. Even the DnDBeyond ad was better. It gave the nostalgic feel of old 80s cartoons and like we were tuning into a TV show. The new theme song doesn't give that same feel. I sang along with “your turn to roll”. I don't sing along to “it's Thursday night.”   I was kinda surprised there's a new intro already. After all the production value that went into the cast running around on a set? That was pretty neat. The massive stretched faces of everyone screaming not so much.
WHOAH!!! Amazing!!!
I think it is amazingly well done, gives better feels than the live version because it  references the characters, which makes sense for a campaign intro.
This is true art in it's purest form.
This needed a significant amount of finishing polish before it went love. Framerate is bizarre, framing is strange, completely off beat, and not a great animation. Individual stills look fine, just the animation needs work.
Love this! I love when Marisha stands up at the end and it goes along with rise.
N’aww! Beautifully done!
Well they screwed that up. They should take another three weeks off to see what else they can screw the pooch on. Huge failure. That just sucks.
Ew.
This is the first opening that I have not liked. For some reason what the music and lyrics are about does not go well with the animation. Also the animation feels inappropriate for a medieval fantasy campaign. It is too futuristic in my opinion. I think the animation makes the cast look much uglier than they are in real life.Sam and Ashley especially are much better looking than their animation. I would have prefered an animation with their characters. Please go back to the old intro it was much better.
looks cool, although the low framerate almost gave a a stroke.
This is FREAKING AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!
So glad they listened to the people who were a little hurt over the last one. Way to go, CR!
Dope
neato burrito
First intro to C3 is miles better than this one
Ehhh, the live action intro was much better imo
Wow, that is.. huh
So janky!  Edit: Nah, it's just bad
This is so great. So amped for the next season of C3. Love this opening sequence. Have loved all of the opening sequences tbh. Probably because I remember when opening sequences didn't exist here lol.  I see some comments about the production of the trailer, I would hope that we can watch these and see them for what they are. They're just stories and trailers from DnD nerds to the rest of us DnD nerds. I don't expect next level 100% tight production for something I am essentially getting for free. Crit Role gives me so much quality content to consume and I will always be glad to have it. I've seen shittier production on Netflix and I pay for that... -_- lol  Calamity was so great, looking forward to C3 continuing.  If you read this Crit Role fam, come to NZ ay? I'll shout you all a real steak and cheese pie.
I'm just going to assume they sold the rights to Your Turn To Roll to amazon for the show otherwise there is no reason to use this song. It's bad, sorry not sorry but it's just not a good song and there isn't going to be an intro that makes it a good theme song.
Was kinda expecting Laura to turn blue in that group shot near the end
Weak.  Go back to the live action one.        Prediction: sensitive critters downvote me to oblivion.
Everyone in here arguing about which video was better. You're all wrong and you should be embarrassed. Ashley's redub of the D&D Beyond jingle is the best.
Honestly, I do prefer the first Version of the Opening.
I'll be that guy and say it, this is not good
Is the C3 campaign set in the uncanny valley? Wtf
Yes, yes yes! Fantastical, magical, colorful, and that awesome soundtrack! Perfect opening.
I kinda liked the original intro to season 3 more where it's them basically being indiana jones. the music not being synced aside, the original intro I think fit their vibe better, and didn't take away from the song. Just because something is more expensive, doesn't mean it's automatically better.
I like this waaaaaaaay better than their live action one which didn't really connect to the campaign at all.
Oh they did such a good job capturing everyone’s expressions and I love the colours. Would have liked more character visuals and I will miss the jungle video.
Older was better
This is stunning - especially appreciate that they’ve got the iconic Marisha Perch in this.
They should have had their animated selves morph into their characters.
Aw man, idk about this... I really want to like it, but I'm not sure about the rotoscoping thing - somehow it also ages all of them, weirdly?
Dont like it, just feels bland. Sure its pretty, lots of colors, but it feels like it lost the human element to it funny enough.
Unpopular opinion, I don't really like it.  The song is great but I don't feel like the visuals match up with it too well.
I don't know if i'm overthinking it but i wonder if the intro change is to combat some of the criticism around the colonialist vibes of the live-action one?? Just a thought.
Not gonna lie. Bigger fan of the live action opener.
WOOOOOOOOOOOW!
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL!!! I LOVE IT!
Love the style and colours - a bit more punch with sound fx and its perfect!
wow :)
What an absolutely insane new artstyle
You guys are having way too much fun with this
So amazing
I just... I don't like this graphics style. It reminds me that one youtuber Matthew McCleskey that does sketches in this kind of style (although much more raw and lower quality). It works for short sketches but don't really work for me for CR intro.  Oh well. I'll get used to it.
I fucking love these people so much it hurts. I hope they know if they ever meet me, I'm having their name tattooed on my arm
me: sees dorian at the end  me: robbie come back pls i miss you so much😭
Love-hate  feelings for this one. I really enjoyed watching it because it's neat, but I also hated watching it for sensory reasons. Definitely think a flash or eye strain warning may be needed here. The animation is really fun, but low fps, lots of motion, and light bright colors together make it a bit difficult to watch for my autistic eyeballs personally. For me, it would have been completely watchable if the color pallet was the usual deep, rich one. Edit: I have realized that my main issue is the white base for most of the shots.
Wow, this was just mesmerising and incredible 🤩
I think we all agree that this isn't one of the best intros but it is something entirely different. I really appreciate how willing and open they are to experiment and take some risks. There's always gonna be some misses this way but it makes me interested where they're gonna take the next one.
This is gorgeous. Fun and colorful. I love it.
I love it! bit I must say the original is still my favorite <3 The way you guys are all indiana jones style and Ash and Laura inaudionly mouth "oh fuck".
I don't care what anyone says, this is badass as hell.
Love it
That. Was absolutely fucking BEAUTIFUL.
Love it, but the editing is a bit weird.  There's some choppy cuts like at :52 when it shows the Laura/Ashley/Liam/Talisin side of the table where it seems to cut 3 times quickly.  I understand what they were going for there but it looks a little disjointed with the animation and music not really syncing up.
It's a little jarring that they went from the very smooth and technically impressive (yet tonally a little odd) 1st intro, straight to one that is glaringly and distractingly janky and rough looking, while still maintaining a lot of the same awkward tone.
Idk about this one boiz
lol, Critical Role simply cant win. People hate the first intro for season 3 because they somehow deem it racist, so then they switch it up, like they have before, and people STILL dont like it. This audience is annoying as hell, make up your fucking minds people and get a grip. For the record I love this art style, and i love this intro. 10/10.
I like the original more 😁
Hm… first time I haven’t really loved a new intro, but that might only be because the previous one for this campaign was OUT OF THIS WORLD awesome! And the Calamity one was bonkers good as well. But I LOVE that they switch it up!
For me, the best part about this is Sam's intro part
I believe I've peaked in life by the fact I could enjoy this bit of history
Doesn't quite hit.  Art style and animations just feel off
The previous one was so good though! This one is.... 😬😬😬
The CR theme continues - no matter what you do, or how well you do it, the die-hards will still complain about something. Great intro I think.
Makes me want to re-watch Waking Life, still interesting take for an intro.
Nothing beats Travis face on the original intro slap fighting Marisha , wish the would have included that part!
Can't say its bad because it isn't. Its amazing but for me nothing will ever beat Your Turn To Roll. It was more in-game character oriented. This is still great tho
Its beautiful! (But I guess I prefer the non animated version. I like it a bit more whimsical/silly/goofy)
Honestly i loved the original intro we had for C3, which felt very relatable and homely. Just pure good vibes from the cast. This sort of pulls you out of that, at least for me
It's sad and pathetic how hard the cast of crit role tries to be inclusive and non offensive to the point that the slightest complaint by even a fraction of their community causes them to entirely overhaul aspects of their show.  First they oversaturate their world with an unrealistic number of gender neutral characters when less the  5% of the IRL population identify as an alternative gender.  Now they're changing their entire intro because of a *hat* that somehow is now linked with racism? For the first time in literal centuries?  Its getting absurd, "imo"  Edit: please let me make it clear that I totally support gender neutrality and all it entails but I dont think it needs to be that matt makes every third NPC we meet go by they/them and then make a huge day about the cast mistakenly calling said NPC he/she as if that hasn't been the norm for literally their entire lives until very recently.
I dont hate it,think the previous ones have been more hype and goosebumps tho.
Matt looks like D&D Jesus. Kudos
I don't love this new intro, but I don't hate it, love the signature to tell the name.  I feel this is a patch up until the animated character version is ready.  For people unaware of it, there was a bit of a controversy with the C3 live-action intro, especially on the choice of costumes that hit on a bad way middle-eastern cultures.  I feel that this is an apology to be sure it isn't shared anymore but not the final product.
This might be one of the most attractive things I have ever seen. Thank you <3
since i listen to CR this is the only time i will ever see this
That was exactly  what I needed to see after a long days work - Fantastic!
I am so confused by all the criticism for this lol. I think it's fucking amazing. Y'all are so critical. Constantly holding C3 up to C1 or C2 and expecting it to be just like them is always going to result in disappointment. CR is putting their whole heart into this stuff and it's obvious. I think they knocked it out of the park with this personally.
OMG THIS IS AMAZING!!
So Matthew Mercer IS Jesus
I absolutely love this. It's so intense and colorful. This is my favorite of the opening songs, and seeing it animated is just really cool. I feel like the style lends itself well to the energy of the track.
Yes
HOLYYYY SHITTT THIS IS AMAZING :0
Prefer this opening to the last…something about the last opening rubbed me the wrong way.
Each of them singing a part is life
as someone who was in a film media class.... Fucking respect this is some good shit. I couldn't do this most likely at all.....
i get you guys made this to address people's complaints and probably had a short window of time. but this is terrible. i cannot cushion my wording at all. i was already not a fan of the previous opening (for different reasons than the ones most people have) but it at least visually looked fine. this is so much worse. i legit think you might have been better off just using the title card like you did in the beginning of this campaign while you had something in the oven a little bit longer. i appreciate everyone in the comments trying to politely say why they dislike it but i can't do that lol
This is so good I love it aaaaaaaaa
Okay this has vibes of the opening to a DIE animated series. Y'all gotta read these comics.
I am glad they paid homage to Dorian at the end, and understand why Robbie is not shown now, but I miss seeing him.
mehhhhh it IS cool, but i liked the previous one a lot better. very nice and colourful but sorta just like motioncap for the cast? why try to be ultra realistic with cgi and just do a live action instead. like a lot of other comments are saying, i feel the music is off somehow?? maybe they need a new song in general for this new intro. But i love the song for the previous intro.  back to the drawing board?
Featuring the players instead of the characters was not a good creative choice, but if you do make that choice then you really should dive into those details like werewolf shifting or eldritch blasting black goo.  We want to see the characters in action in the intro, not the players. We see them for multiple hours each week.   Both would honestly be a solid creative decision. Have Travis morph into chetney and then chetney into a werewolf.   All the players become the characters and we spend the majority of the intro with those characters.   Would’ve been nice.
This is better. Not because its animated. But because it has both players and characters together. But honestly... I would of made the player completely transform into their characters !
The music is out of sync, other then that. Its great.
Not good at all. It feels very "recycled". Most of the themes and images are drawn from a previous intro. Great work, for whoever did the animation and colors but the quality of the intro was seriously lacking.
I think it’s very nice and well done, but I don’t think it shares the same energy. It needs a new song to go with this animation.  Keep the theme song to the live action music video, but make a new song for this that matches the energy of this animation.
This is amazing. I'm loving the Doctor Who vibes at the start as well.
Big improvement.
The animation is nice, but it doesn't time with the music at all and feels really wrong from that. Some parts the animation was feeling behind the music. Other parts, namely toward the end, the animations felt ahead of the music.
This is not as epic as C1, and not as energetic as C2, but It's still fantastic.
This one is cool but something about it just isnt doing it for me..
Absolute goosebumps, i love it so much
It's not bad. Rotoscopy is fine. But after C2's fantasy and beautiful retro fantasy, this is.... lacking. :(
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh......
I like the parts with Matt, but honestly this just doesn't do it for me at all. For the animation, it would be great to animate your characters, not actual people. For the actual actors your original live action version is much better.
I enjoyed the last one. Sorry folks put pressure on you to redo it. This one is lovely too though.
I like the old one
I like how all their names as they appear on the screen are written differently. I assume it's their signatures? Anyway, loved the new opening guys! Thanks a lot!
The live action one is much better.
This is very cool but it's a hard fight to try and improve on "your turn to roll." The song was fucking awesome and seeing the characters animated was always the coolest thing. Plus all the homages to Molly, and the NPC'S, i wish we had something more like it's style
Animation is beautiful props to the Animator.  I do wish that it was more focused on the characters rather than the players though.
Considering the bar set by the M9 intro, the live-action one was better imo. I think they should have waited and commissioned an animated intro like the one for C2, with the characters actually being in it and doing their things, giving them personality. Others have said the same thing, so I'm just adding my agreement to them.
Call me racist all you want. The old one was simply put better.
DOPE!
Well done, its not the vibe for me. Something seems a bit off with it. Kind of like a doll that looks almost human but not, it is offputting. Looking forward for CR to be back on youtube monday.
I think for me what feels the most off is the direction everyone's eyes are looking doesn't quite look right all the time, like when Liam grabs the sword.
Yall why are we trying to be nice? I love CR and its cast but this intro is dogwater. I respect the effort put in but this was not the play.
Just so you guys know. You don't need to listen to everything a small group on Twitter says. Feel free to wear India Jones type clothes. You didnt have to change the intro. You do you
Nice, but I was hoping they'd have the characters animated.
My initial thought before watching was "Oh no, I love the current one!" but this is fucking amazing.
👏
strait up fire
I like it. But I liked the old one more.
I love all the personality coming through!
I like this one, but Your Turn To Roll will always be king
Im sorry but this just aint it, hopefully its just a placeholder until one with their characters, like c2, is made? Imo. i really liked the first one, especially the chaotic table moment, and if they really changed it for complaints and valid concerns, couldnt they have just filmed different content to cut in? Idk, i just am not fond of this one i guess.
Eh it's alright
I love how they gave Sam his barrel of mead lol
oh god did another of sams chars snowsword down a mountain or is that just a Veth reference
Creative people gotta create! All for them messin' bout, looks visually stunning--yet... something about it unsettles me? XD and I'm not even sure what it is.
Better!
One by one we…remove Dorian from history.
Holy Cannoli that is badass!!!
Freaking awesome. Put that is your pipe and smoke it, Bilbo.
The live opening for season 3 was critiqued for having 19th century reminiscent of colonial history. So the new animated intro is largely abstract, emptied of any historical implication, and full of rainbow clouds. It feels like it's catering so hard to a certain crowd that it's bordering on the passive-aggressive.  I'm not going to hate on you guys for making an exceedingly safe intro... but I don't see much of you guys in it, and that makes me a little sad.
I'm gonna keep it real this isn't good  Just bring back the C2 style intro
Initial impressions/things I liked: - The playful energy of Laura coming through in the hexagon hopping - The portrayal of Liam acting out Orym's maneuvers with the designs on the blade - Marisha in classic standing-on-chair position*, then flicking Laudna goo off her fingers - Capturing Travis' energy in general - Taliesin taking a big swing in character as Ashton  *One of things that made me smile during EXU Calamity was how much this translated to Marisha trying to crawl under the table at tense/scary moments
not what i expected, but still freakin' amazing!
Rotoscoping isn't my favorite animation style, but I'm always down for more intros!  Hopefully we can get the guys back from season 2 to do an intro again!
What a pity this amazing animation wasnt set to "Your turn to roll"  Sorry but "Thursday Night" just doesnt have the epiciness
the hilarity of releasing a song about Thursday, on Friday, made me laugh. overall it's a bop and the look of it just gives me old school Borderlands vibes (I know it's not cell-shading, but it just feels it).
This is pretty cool and I like it. Still doesn't beat the Campaign 2 animated intro. That was a peak of awesome.
i cant help but feel someone should have checked the final product before uploading. there's some pretty amateurish errors that have happened. im sure you will fix it
Not my favorite CR opening… This one seems a little bit weird. Everyone’s faces are a bit off?
Skip.
Can we please get the “old” intro back? This one just isn’t very good and doesn’t really fit.
Easily my least favorite of the intros. I'm sorry.
This ain't it, not good
I love it
Why did they change it when they just made the other new one?
I don't know why, but this made my heart swell to the point of almost tears 😭 Badass and amazing. Very well done ❤️
I don't really see the point of having this be animated if its just featuring the players and not the characters
Cool intro!
sometimes people are TOO nice.
I.. kinda hate it :/ There's something wrong with the faces. And the previous one had a lot more "impact" for lack of a better word
Very "Take On Me".
I love this art style of how they're like paintings coming to life. It's beautiful.
I get it but I don’t like it very much
Not loving this
This is beautiful
I prefer it to the insensitive first opening
This is kinda... off. Maybe they need to pay someone that knows how to do presentation? Most of season 2 (about 90%) is still superior to 99% of season 3 overall – there are three amazing episodes (two I think are made for cinema). Furthermore, the season 2 theme was, in contrast, a masterpiece.
I find this way better opening!!
The oil jug kills me
That was amazing :D Love it, but I'll still go back and watch the old one, different energy :D
I really don't like this. The animation really doesn't jive with the music, and the rotoscoping just feels off, and it can't compare to the full animated intro they did for C2. This is a misfire on almost every level.  😕
Never expected rotoscoping but this is incredibly fucking dope! Well done to all the peeps involved, cause this is obviously a lot of tough work!
I've got to be honest, really not digging this intro, it's my least favorite of all their intros. Not saying anything mean to those that made it, just not my cup of tea
Love this! The art style is SO cool omg, can't look away
I love the look of the intro. A scanner darkly vibes. But the audio doesn't fit as well as the other intros. I loved the little  bits of character showing but...like Travis into werewolf. I wanted to see them all take their characters shape...oh well.
Guess who's back.... back again....  crit is back.... tell your friends.... crit is back.... crit is back.... crit is back.... crit is back.
I like the first one better. This one is okay, but the live action was pretty sweet.
It's like an AI Dream Generator watched a bunch of obscure 90's cartoons.  I love it!
That's pretty damn killer
I fucking love this! Callback to the animation style of the original Lord of the Rings animated film, incredible colors, love it
I love this but I love the other one more. Don't get me wrong, this is cool! However the other one just hits different
I guess sometimes things don't hit the right spot.   I've been here live to see every campaign intro, and loved them all, honestly. This one falls a bit short.  I'll say that my favorite opening from CR is the last one. It felt like a perfect mix of basically all of the other intros with them so far, and the shots at the table in slow-mo are AMAZING. I'm gonna miss that a lot. Luckily, we still have our C3 song!!!
I'm speechless...I love everything these amazing actors are doing
The song totally does not go with this new opening.  Cool new video, definitely needed a new song to match its bright coloured tone.  Maybe that's coming in the next couple weeks.
There is a lot I like about it. Travis, Ashley, Liam and Taliesin especially
it looks like a shitty metaverse ad. all because people cried about the first one being very indiana jones
It's not bad, but... why? The last one was sooooo awesome!
When the Art Nerds become All Powerful. I Love It!!!
Matt looks like Jesus in this😂
I would rather have seen an opening that was with the characters. :( It's still very well done, but yeah I'm a bit disappointed.
i'm gonna add my thoughts here - i prefer this intro stylistically, i think i'm in the minority that thought the old c3 intro was a bit strange in terms of theme (we have minis in a jungle, then live action in a jungle, then the slow mo table moment). this intro is at least cohesive in style. also, i know this is contentious but i'm SO glad they've replaced the weird pith hatted colonialist adventurer vibes from the old intro (it really jarred with the ideology and feel of cr for me). i will say though i think people have a point with the comments on the music not lining up and the uncanny valley animation
its Marisha standing up on the chair for me
That was ginaminasaurous.
I can appreciate it from a technical / artistic perspective but it doesn't exactly do it for my in the hype department.
Well this was pretty meh. They did so well with C2 animation, this is overall pretty bad. Feels like they're spending more money and getting progressively worst.
Aww I liked the old one it made it more personal and made it look people could be added with each episode showing up in the intro like Robbie did this one looks good but then it looks bad within they emote and move it makes their faces all uncanny valley and wrong
Totally awesome but, to me it feels kind of... unneccessary to change up the intro this early in the campaign. Especially since the first one is also great and really radiates the fun you guys have at the table and in your roleplay. It just oozes joy. This one is beautiful and magical and very expertly animated (forget what alot of people are saying, nothing really is perfect but will still be enjoyed by many as something top notch) but it lacks the amount of fun I see in the first one.
Hmm... nope.  Preferred the first one, this feels a bit off
Thats just epic
There is something VERY unsettling about the uncanny valley of it but I like the aesthetic of the players doing things that their characters do
This is cool, but the older live one was so good though. I feel like this one could have benefit from a few more hours of editing.
So I'm on board with making BETTER stuff, but this screams "We let the white libs in twitter get into our heads so we took the blandest least 'offensive' path we could so they wouldn't complain"
The New opening look more like a LSD Trip, then a Intro for a rpg. Also the music doesn't fits to the Clip mostly cause its more heavy and epic and Dark while this video is more  colorful and bright its a nice idea but just doesn't fits But thats just my humble opinion...
Don't want to pile on and repeat what everyone else is saying, but for the sake of feedback; I vastly prefer the last version.  Something is off about this, and people with an animation background have explained it much better than I ever could in other comments.  I think it's a great idea, and you can see the love that's gone into it, but the execution is a little off.
I really hope this was planned in advance and wasn’t a last minute thing in response to the slight criticism they received for their live action video. Because that criticism was hypocritical anyway.
The rotoscoping looks weird in places, but hey, that's what rotoscoping do.
Chills Fucking chills
I'm being constructively critical here (ha ha, get it?). The part of the opening that sucked was not the scene. I mean no ill intentions here when I say this. The intro song sucks. It doesn't set the way for the episode, it doesn't get the viewer excited. It just isn't the vibe. C1 (although simple) and C2 get the blood pumping and hype the episode. This intro song is just a reason to fast forward. I mean this constructively, I promise!
That was fucking awesome
This is too cool!
This is outrageously epic. It's legit better than a lot of music videos that have topped actual charts.
It at least show SOMETHING about the current campaign's characters. And of course it highlights the stupid overreactions at the table.  I'm trying to listen to the dm talk, not everyone yelling and screaming. "Oh but it being a fun energy" it's way over the top and is irritating as fuck.   Also, Robbie should be a full time cast member.   Maybe get a full second campaign that you can air on a different night. Poach Brennan and keep him on as a full time dm for the second show and have Robbie in that one. Maybe have concurrent games running in different parts of exandria. And, I know it'd be a logistical nightmare, but they could team up against an army of big bads for the conclusion.
The D&D beyond opening season 2 was way better literally made me want to play D&D this doesn't
goosebumps
Arabian nights vibes max
Ok intro, old one was better. Needs some finetuning.
At 0:50 onwards, the rotoscope makes it look like they're all soyjack faces.
I’m afraid this one doesn’t quite donut for me. There are some neat ideas in it, to be sure. But what i mostly don’t like is how the music doesn’t sync up anymore. In the live action one, in the verse you could see the cast solo. And in the chorus (which they all sing together) you see them at the table. It works and I like some parts of it. But I hope they keep the live action one as well.  Maybe take turns with the intros.
Just bring back your turn to roll at this point
omg ❤❤❤
Just personally I love the inclusion of a little Dorian Cameo after he was such a presence at the beginning.
Awesome <3
YOOOO THIS IS AWESOME!!!
Much better!
this is a neat idea, but i prefer the previous one still, sad that this got changed probably due to people wanting to see something to criticize from them  "they are group of white people painting themselves stealing from temples and shit" Pls, go touch some grass, and watch indiana jones and others alike ffs
LOL amazing
I don't...I don't get it. How is this worse that the last intro C3 started with and it actually has character stuff? Weird
The part at 0:12 really strained my eyes
Holy cow my heart is going a million miles per hour.  That was awesome!
Let’s GOOOOOOOOO!!!
I like it, but what the hell does it have to do with the third campaign?? LOL
Critical Role made the mistake of making the C2 Intro so damn good. This is great, the animation is awesome and the style is cool... It's just hard to compare with actual perfection.
I hope they don't look at the comments and just enjoy what they've created. Criticisms and all. They put a lot of effort into this, I appreciate that effort. That is all.
This is giving me the same motion sickness that I'd get watching The Dragon Prince Season 1.
The Marisha on the chair is perfect
Holy shit the people around me in the coffee shop might thing I am crazy because I started clapping like a kid when Matt closed that book at the end! AMAZING!
I still loved the live action cosplay opening , and the last animated opening,  It had more emphasis on the characters. I appreciate your hard work but respectfully,  l think it may have been just ok... sorry ... l was looking forward to this.
Love the Rotoscope effect. Reminds me of the animated LOTR movie but more up to date and colourful.
something about the frames feels off the animation itself is wonderful but it feels like the frames were slowed down by accident
I definitely appreciate this—especially Travis, Liam and Marisha’s moments—but I already miss the “old” C3 opening :(
WAKING LIFE AINT GOT NOTHING ON THIS INTRO!
Amazing, loved so much
I honestly really am not into this intro. I was so excited when they said it was animated, really hoping it was like the c2 intro, which was phenomenal and set a great tone for the epic adventures they went on. I really even enjoyed the live action version of this, each person was on beat and it was very dynamic. This seems choppy and doesn’t flow well at all in my opinion. People are talking about the colors, but I find it to be overdone and really didn’t feel refined and cohesive to me. Sure the animation style is interesting, but the composition between transitions and characters wasn’t smooth, and I honestly just found it pretty disappointing. I love critical role and will continue to support them but I think that they definitely could have done better with the time spent on creating a new and engaging intro, especially if its animated, why not animate the characters themselves ?? I really really looked forward to seeing their characters animated like in c2 (id understand not doing it exactly like that, switch it up, but still have that sort of worldbuilding and character design through the poses, designs, interactions, and setting like they did) and I can’t lie, my heart was a little crushed after watching this. I don’t mean to sound negative, and absolutely no hate to the cast and artists involved, but I just feel like I liked all of the other intros much more. Love you guys tho !
Every new intro always fills me with excitement. This is the first time where I've just been disappointed. Most of the time I sit and watch the intro and feel the goosebumps break out on my arms and the back of my neck, even if I've watched it multiple times, it never seems to fail. This just made me want to fast forward and/or skip it.
Real elves would go gay for Matt's eyes in this like wut
I…don’t love it. It feels like it’s playing on a computer that can’t quite keep up
Wonderful, love it!
I’m legit crying. This is bloody phenomenal!
Love the change in style, even if rotoscopy can be risky. For those who say it's not very much in sync, it's true. I guess they received so much heat over the costumes of the previous intro they had to come up with another one which was less "problematic" (whatever that might mean, because at this point I don't know anymore) and in a short time to stop offending people asap.  And this is what you get when people complain in droves so much: A rushed effort to please everyone that ends up pleasing almost none. For my part I like it, I love seeing the actors doing silly things and being epic, I love seeing Matt with that book, or Marisha's sweet callback to Keyleth, or Liam wielding that shortsword and being our dear, brave, Halfling warrior, and all the splashes of watercolor and effects.  Kudos to all those who could conceive this and put it together. I love it to pieces 💓
The animation is gorgeous. The colors are fantastic. Truly, all the technical things are there. But why, why, why didn't you focus these on the characters? I love you guys but I wanna see you guys bring these characters to life...
ya....not a fan sorry guys. looks....off...
sweet
Not really into this one. I ejoyed seeing the player characters op. It helped introduce new viewers  to the personalities to expect.
HYPE!!
well this is fire
I'm not here to throw shade, but I'm just not a fan of this intro. I loved the mighty nein ones and I *loved* the previous live action one, but this one doesn't slap like the other ones. The rotoscoping just feels awkward and it doesn't feel like they commit one way or the other for the theme of this one.... I dunno. Am I alone?
Merp. That about sums up this intro. Plus I’m still not a fan of the “Bell’s Hells” name which I’m still hoping gets changed and maybe that’s why they don’t introduce them as such for a “final” introduction?
ngl the rotoscoping feels very lazy
Looks kinda weird. Not my taste.
Can't believe I'm saying this but I've watched the intro every single episode but I think I might be skipping this one. :/
this animation reminds me of the fellowship of the ring / two towers animated movie
not a big fan of this one…
Not a fan.
This is Amazing, keep up the Campaign and let the adventure continue
……😐…… It reminds me of Take On Me… But it’s not… I don’t know what else to say, not feeling it.🫤
Very cool. Critters have become a very toxic community and this comment section proves that again. But i love this intro.
Someone was on high after LSD or something... previous one was totally better
So they gave in to a minuscule amount of people who complained about the first intro and made… this. Great.
Every time I hear this song it gives me chills. I love it so much! New intro is awesome! 🤩❤️
well damn
Holy shot that was amazing
I don't get it, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this... I know they're Critical Role but why has everyone got to be so critical lmao. Loved it, good work.
Damn yall dont like it huh wow, i thought it was really cool :(
I love the character elements!!! That's what the old theme was missing
Magical, gave me goosebumps! <3
Wow what an amazing and clear showing of the improvements that each title opening has had each time 🎉👍
I'm sure lots of works have been put into this, but..woah I don't like it and some frames are genuinely terrifying.
Pretty dope, ngl
I love all the little details, and nearly screamed "PÂTÉ!" when I saw him on the chair. Even for a relatively new Critter like me this is AMAZING!!!!!!
There is something about this that is a little off. It's not quite uncanny Valley, but somewhere in that ball park.
Love this. Super amazing. I am bummed that Marisha didn't pull out Patte.
The effects are well made don't get me wrong, but the cast looks so wrong and weird in this
Have mercy on me, I am still on campaign 1
SCREAMING this is so good I have goosebumps
Honestly I highly prefer the live action version (always do) but I am extremely impressed with the artwork. The artwork was absolutely beautiful. I wish I was half the talent this took lol.
I do not like it. Aside from the music and timing issues, the first live action version resonated so much more for me -- it was beautiful and told a real visual story. This was painful (literally, it gave me a headache) and said very little about the characters and left the players poorly rendered. It took away from the song instead of adding to it. Just my opinion, but I think they really missed the mark with this and is a poor replacement.
Unfortunately this artwork looks like it was done by an AI bot and it doesn’t quite sync with the music. I guess I’m a little disappointed as the old intro used to give me literal goosebumps!
This one kinda comes off as a little odd at first. I'm sure it'll grow on me, but hey. At least they're not in controversial costumes, right?
Thursday Night is a cool song and all, but it does not smack NEARLY as hard as Your Turn to Roll. Not even close. I also really, really miss seeing the characters being brought to life as opposed to more stock footage of the cast but now in rotoscope. Like, don't get me wrong this intro is neat as heck, but it just ain't no C2 animated intro, that's for sure.
Was this cell shaded or traced?
Bit of a downgrade ngl
Missed an opportunity to draw Travis half of his normal size and now my immersion is broken.
Wonderfully done! And now I can put that song on my music Playlist! Thank you so much to everyone at Critical role! You all are good people and sadly there's not enough for us. You give me hope that one day I could run a campaign with all of my friends!
This version doesn't hit as hard as the live action one in my opinion. The animation style is beautiful but it's not as punchy as the first one for this campaign
The retro theme one is still my favorite with Sam in the rainbow suspenders, Matt as the goth kid, and Travis the jock. It was just silly and fun!
Dope.
very nicely done Cellshading, great to see a new title sequence and it a great mix of animation relating to the campaign and the previous title sequence.
Dsng, I'm going to miss the other one! It was so cool and atmospheric, but this one is cool too with showing the characters that we know!
Nothing will beat the animated Campaign 2 Mighty Nein intro. That shit was legendary.  This is alright though!
After seeing both of the C3 intros, I think we learnt that it will be really difficult to beat M9s animated intro
It's not terrible, but its certainly doesnt seem up to the same quality as the others. I think the "live" one was much better and fit the song far more comfortably. I wonder why they decided to change it?
rip techno we will remember him greatly
Damn
Although I love the animation, the live action version is my favorite. 💕
*watches Liam and Tal's sequences for a BIT too long...*  ........Welp, I'm gonna go Pray to Eros now.
First one is better. Not that this is bad, just not as good.
This is epic
❤❤❤
Why is animated Liam hot?
I really wanted to like this, but the music is too epic for some rotoscoped clips. The best parts were definitely when the player characters were melded into it. No offense to the animation team, but it feels almost like a proof of concept and doesn't match the production quality that Critical Role has developed into the years. The last intro? I never skipped. This intro? I'm going to be skipping or at least walking out of the room. I love the song, but the visuals just... aren't working with it in this. Taliesin's face shifts on his head at 0:41 and I'm just really uncomfortable with how Ashley and Sam look in the table sequence.   Edit: After another watch, the music at the end seems to be about 2 seconds ahead of the animation. It's really obvious at the end with Matt closing the book and the sound of flames coming up. But in the beginning, it starts out somewhat in sync, and then just derails.
Can anyone explain why they so quickly made a new one? Not even 20 episodes after the first one they made? Seems odd no one else is talking about how quickly they changed it...
I'd have much preferred a campaign 1 or 2 type video with the characters themselves. Strangely disconnected to the theme, this time around, too. Don't get me wrong... it's extremely well done. Just doesn't catch the way season 2 did. Still... well made.
DUDE. This just made my day. so freakin' cool.
This is very good but nothing beats the Mighty Nein intro.
Absolutely brilliant guys!
I like that first transition from Matt to the table, very Doctor Who!
This ain't it.  But I applaud the effort for trying to do something new and creative. The song doesn't line up with the animation some how, the rotoscoping at low fps just seems like a terrible idea. It makes me feel uncomfortable and uneasy. Laura seems to get like 30% of the screen time and Sam is an afterthought that barely makes it into the whole table shot. Liam gets like 3 seconds of screen time. Some of the decisions around this seem questionable to say the least.
THIS IS SO INCREDIBLE GREAT JOB EVERYONE INVOLVED. I'm really happy this exists and hope it replaces the original.
This just feels off... And I think it's their worst opening yet (except perhaps at the start of C1 when they didn't really have an opening anyway). Colour's are nice, but otherwise the animations for janky, there isn't much of their characters in it, and the music feels slightly out of sync with the animations as well. The live action version with this song was much better.
Love it! MUCH better than the previous one ;)
It's so fucking sad. If the Video only started *1 second later*.  If your brain also struggles with the syncing, start the video twice, one without sound and 1 sec later than the other (there are sites that can do that as well).
Very well done, but music is off and would’ve liked to see more of the full characters.
I like it but the first one was pretty good
of course Sam's part is total chaos
I loved the old one but this new intro is so undeniably beautiful
Love it!
Really nice, hope they keep it. The first one was cool but I like this one's vibe more!
It's OK, nothing special.
That was breathtaking.
by the gods of Exandria and beyond! it's beautiful!
IMO, rotoscoping is so uncanny that it can only be used effectively in moderation. On top of the janky feel, did we really need a new intro?
Damn that shit looks dope.
This is rad
Bruh!!! Killer Intro!!!!
Audio sync is definitely weird in this version, but that seems like something they’re likely to clean up.  I love the animated “fantasy” parts, but I miss the real faces in the table shots.
I wasn't expecting this but it is really cool. I LOVE the movement in Ashley's part and the way that Liam's leads into Marisha's.
Good.  In the old version, I really liked the parts where they were in costume (even though it didn’t match their C3 characters), but I hated the slow mo shots of them at the table.
It was ok, last seasons was better.
nope the original was way better sorry I had to give you an thumbs down
I love the hints of their previous characters blending into their current characters.  Laura doing a Jester like skip before the Imogen magic starts closing in. Ashley cutting in with a two handed greatsword before being surrounded by flowers (still feels Yasha-ish, but also... Druid.) Taliesin grabbing Cadueces' crystal before smashing it like a barbarian. Travis using magic to defend himself with magic like Fjord before turning Chetney feral. Sam's is a little weak since he's riding a sword like Yasha did and there is little FCG in there. But then Liam comes in with a background of Caleb Amber as he grabs Orym's sword. And last we have Marisha doing a Beau toughman walk before shooting out Laudna's ichor and weirdness.   LOVE IT!!!  Edit: @BethWood01 pointed out that there is also a Orym - Keyleth connection with the leaves blowing from Liam to Marisha. and @our Adventuring Party pointed out the cogs in the background of Sam's entrance, just above the mountains. NICE!
Thank you guys so much
I like this a lot, but it really felt like there was an imbalance with how much time and care each of the cast got. With those at the back end not really getting as much, and Marisha only really having a moment which was just no where near as well done as Laura or Ashley's time on screen.  Plus, I honestly like intros that are a bit more character focused. That said, this is still really neat and Matt closing the book at the end looked great!
"Animated"
wow I love retroscopie !!! this is a blast ... and damn Taliesin look SO FUCKING GREAT !
I went on a trip.
Awesome
I liked the other intro more
Its good but it just doesn't feel right. Does anyone else feel this way?
Definitely cool/neat but imo it doesn't even hold a candle to the live action opening or the animated opening for campaign 2.
I got chills watching it. Especially when Travis went a little werewolf, lol.  Loved it
This is dope!
Nothing will ever top campaign 2 intro.
It's enjoyable, love the colors and PC/player cross. But I think I like all the other intros better. This just feels a bit disjointed.
they all have rather simple, monochromatic clothes, and then there is Sam...
Look so good man
this is amazing!
Little bit of a slow start but it started popping a little more at the end. Looks cool and like that something new is being tried but it just doesn't quite fit with the song. But I've only seen it once, I'm sure it will grow on me. Can't wait to watch the latest episode as I wasn't able to watch live.
I uh, I don't really like it. Sorry.
Love the a animation but the song and visuals dont compliment each other
A Scanner Darkly.
I don't know I did preferred old one more,  but still well done and great job to who ever did it 👏 👍 😀
That song gives me shivers every time I hear it. Everyone sing in it.
I appreciate the work that went into this - but it just doesn't hit right. The action doesn't sync to the music at all.
Feels like they just finished the last one…
I have to say, I preferred the other intro.  This one is very beautiful, don't get me wrong, but I preferred seeing their actual faces.
I don't like the new intro. I never liked the new s3 song much. I NEVER skipped the season 2 intros. They were perfection and fun. I was hoping the new animation would improve the song but it made it worse. I'll continue to skip it until it changes. No biggie.
A photosensitive warning would be nice so a seizure doesn't happen. Note to self, never watch the opening for Critical Role again
This is absolutely breathtaking!
meh 1. i want to see the characters 2. video seems "choppy" 3. doesn't sync with the music 4. how many times does mercer have to close his book
another swing, another miss
Aww I hoped Marisha would be having a cool Form of Dread transformation. Laudna is fun scary! :D
This was interesting to see if nothing else. I do like it & yet I kinda agree with the general consensus, the animation just seems off with the beat of the music.
OH HELL YEAH
Sorry. This aint it.
A scanner darkly vibes :)
its so extra I love it.
Oh my glob...that was awesomely epic and brought tears to my eyes
Why is Sam trying to kill himself?
Seeing Travis werewolf out is a dream of mine and you all made it come true. So thank you for the beautiful new intro, same badass music, a million times better visuals
Although I respect the time and effort that has gone into this, this doesn't grab me like the other openings have. The others followed a clear theme and this one doesn't seem to know what it wants to be between the blend of live action players, character traits and abstract colours and shapes.
These last two intros have been awesome looking but they both Miss the best thing of the intros for seasons 1 and 2, the characters they're playing. These intros are so much more focused on the actors and the real people while I don't know about you but I'm here for the characters in the story. Season 2 is my favorite due to a heavier focus even in jokes on the characters not the players.
This is… weird… The live action one was much more in sync with the song and, although its theme was really generic, it was incredibly well made and impactful. It's not a big deal, but I hope they make another one.
Just sad that you felt you had to get rid of a genuinely good piece of art and performance because people attacked you for it. Wish you all the best.
I know I always comment this, but…  Dorian! 🥹
Most of the time you guys hit the mark but uh... this aint it chief. This looks really bad, and not just on a "I don't like the art style" level. The FPS is super clunky and painful to look at, it doesn't feel well synced, it's jarring, this feels super poorly done compared to most of your recent work. I prefer the old intro.
Glorious
Awe. Apparently people don't like the new one? Didn't people not like the old one? Ya'll gonna make me cry
I think it's fantastic. I can't believe some people didn't like this.
I thought Travis was going to turn into a werewolf for a hot second and honestly I would have liked to see that lmao. It’s very pretty though, and looks even better sped up (I watch all the episodes on 1.75x speed and it was so weird to hear the song at its normal pace, but the animated stuff genuinely looks cooler when it’s faster).
i’m sorry, i love you guys, but what in the etsy store is this? 😂
Rotoscope always looks terrible.
OH MY GOD I'm in tears This is too good
Hm, I was kinda hoping for a new song as well
this is the first time I've liked the live action opening over the animated opening not a fan of this one
Anyone else get the C1 feels as Orym/Liam sends leaves fluttering into Marisha's smiling face? I might miss Keyleth just a little!
its pretty badass and cool and all but god do i hate rotoscoping
Love it! Gives reading rainbow vibes
This is amazing 👏
aight, i'll say it. Campaign 2's animated opening set the bar that none have hence or since reached. yeah this is objectively good, but it makes the focus the players and their shenanigans, which i like, but C2's breathed so much life into the characters that we'd never seen anything like before.   like i said this is good and i like it, but i feel like they're making changes in direction that they don't need to. they had it spot on before and they're letting it slide away.   idk man i miss my warchant badass opening
It's certainly better than the previous intro, but still doesn't feel right. Like you guys are pushing the group more than the story and the characters, which, in my mind, are more important.
its very well done but I still prefer season 2 opening
Liam's sword thrust sending wind toward Marisha was such a nice little easter egg
Aaaahhh this is why we had a huge haitus
fun fact, the infinite loop of dice laura runs on os an accurate depiction of the amount of dice laura really has.
I love this!
I love it.  It reminds me of The Waking Life or A Scanner Darkly.  Was this done doing Motion Capture or Rotoscope or something else?  Sorry, I've just always had an interest in animation... unfortunately, interest does not necessarily equate to talent.
Music doesn't really match up with what's going on the screen and it's a mess.
Incredible stuff as always from the CR team
It's cute. I love Ashley embodying some Yasha and Fearne energy at 0:30.
Anyone else think Ashley is a flawless beauty inside and out in every way? Even animated.
I teared up at the sight of Dorian. Can't wait for him to return.
They should've snuck in Brennan and aabria in the background somewhere
Boring.
Is it weird that I think I prefer the jungle theme?
It looks good and very artistic but cannot beat overall awesomness of live action version ;)
I'm not too sure about this one. I liked the first intro because it lined up the different singing parts with the actors. Here, there were some moments that seemed like they were supposed to be impressive but the animators only went halfway with the idea, so it had less of an impact. I did like the transition to Taliesen and his little bit, along with Matt's intro and outro shots. The animation style is interesting, and I like what they were going for.
This makes me so happy! Thank you to all of Critical Role for all the laughter, tears, joy, and everything else you have brought into our lives since the beginning of Campaign 1! ❤️you mean the world to us!
Looks cool, I really like it. I don't really know what was wrong with the first one though xD
Well... This is bad. Like real bad. Excep Travis's wereworf ofcorse. To those ho think overvise - just rewatch C2 opening and first C3 opening. They are MUCH better.
Honestly not sure what to think of this intro …
👀 Replaying it for the third time! Simply amazing art work!!!
Freaking sam with his drink case lol
Absolutely incredible
I watched all of campaign 2 and am doing my darnedest to catch up to campaign 3, which I'm enjoying greatly :) I'm a fan of what the show is doing and I'm sure the Critical Role team is working hard to keep it up  I'm about to rip into this intro, but I will say, other folks have pointed out there may be a sync issue, and its very possible that this is what tipped me over from "not everything can be a masterpiece and this just isn't to my tastes" to "this is bad and its disappointing that it even made it to release"  But I cannot say I enjoyed watching this. The jump cuts look like animation errors. Everyone's faces fall into the uncanny valley. The visual effects are a mess, that is, the paint splotches, glitter, distortion, etc., whoever was responsible for sticking this in After Effects was not doing their best work. The visuals are hard to parse and the stylistic, colourful water colour theme I expected is muddy and confusing. Also the rotoscoping just seems poorly done, like it was either done by AI or an unskilled grunt as opposed to an experienced 2d animator. Facial features float around the form of the head and shapes jitter noticeably. In fairness, maybe it was also made difficult by the source live-action footage, I do not know.   And there's just not enough to redeem it. The water colour concept could create an exciting, joyful mood, but as I said, its just too muddy. Blending the cast with their characters is fun, but it fell flat. (i.e. Taliesin's hammer swing is sick but I paid more attention to his rigid angry face; Marisha seems to be missing her fair share of creepy effects, etc.). A well-executed, crisp, minimalist animation might justify the absence of lovingly-made backgrounds and/or easter eggs, but this isn't the case. Similarly, I could have looked past the messy rotoscoping and appreciated the novelty if there was more quality in the overall composition, but alas.  Idk, I'm not trying to be a dick. But even as an amateur artist I can see a few things went wrong along the way here. Hopefully things come together better next time around. I'd personally prefer a different intro than this for the time being, but I suppose its not a big deal regardless.
Loved it! The first Opening Title and this one are both amazing and both have great atmospheres. I hope you use both of them from now on, cause I'd still love to see the old one now and then.
Matt looks like Jesus and I love it
The music doesn't fit the animation at all. I think what the music did for the original intro was nice, it was paced with live action and really told a story of who was singing at the moment. This felt like it didn't belong. "From the healer to the renegade..." This part it didn't really emphasis what the lyric was saying just people being excited. Overall, Who ever did this Rotoscope is cool but if you wanted to excite your audience, a new song or tone of the song would have fit better.
Was that pretty I saw? Haha SAVE PRETTY AT ALL COSTS!
Not the best animated opening, I'd rather they stick to the cool live action on they did it feels like their was more effort and thought put into that then this mess.
There’s times where the art is beautiful and times where it’s borderline uncanny valley but I still enjoyed it.
Critical Role has some Critical Fans.
The colour work on this is absolutely beautifull!
I really hope none of their characters die.
Nice to see you are having a blast.  I still love C2 opening but I do realize that was lightning in a bottle. May the 20s be with you. Always.
Well, time to loop this and play it 24/7
the faces are just a liiiiiitle uncanny at times
Let's hope this doesn't age badly when Chetney actually does die.
Tbh this is the worst intro so far. The Animations are choppy, not lined up to the music and the art style doesn't really fit the overall theme of CR.
As a huge animation fan, artist and very novice animator: OMG THAT LOOKS GREAT, THE COLORS, THE SMOOTH ANIMATION, THE LINELESS STYLE THAT LOOK GORGEUS BUT STILL DOES FACE EXPRESSIONS GREAT. JUST AMAZING.
hmmm yeah... that's a no from me... a little bit unsettling  (PS: i love everything u do tho)
This is purdy!
Watching your intros always make me so emotional about how far you’ve come!
Love it! Especially the the Dr.Whoish tunnel thing at the beginning!
This is WAY worse than the previous opening. Stop pretending like its good people, its ok to criticize CR.
Matches up to the song slightly better here than it did on Twitch, which I imagine was a sync issue.
all i have to say. I like this
Just remember, this is all twitter's fault.
I like this
I love this Song. It evokes so much of what I love about Critical Role.
Awesome!
Matt Mercer, Modern Day Messiah
The video is cool. You're turn to role is still a better song
I am sad to see the first opening sequence go so soon (by comparison to other opening sequences) because it was such fun to watch while singing along with the theme, but the animation is absolutely beautiful.
It's like that old-school painter/animated Lord of the Rings that was done but done better. Nice. Seems too bad that you all spent the time doing the first one. That was fun, too. Cheers.
Thats awesome
You all look so gorgeous!!!!
This is so 2010s
I really don't like the art style of this but I'm seeing a lot of people loved it. It isn't my thing but I have also always not really liked the music for the intros - always a little cheesy. I do like the song a lot better but I always tend to skip it even though there is so much talent in the cast and this animator! I have nothing but appreciation for it, but I can't deny I'm anticipating whatever intro comes next (if there is going to be one).
How are they ALL so hot ????
Pretty fuckin dope!!!
I love this!  Especially the logo at the end.  But, I kinda like the old one a little better.  Don't hate me!
I actually like the original way better then this :/ this just seems off, don't like it
Man…. what are you guys doing? You go animated and instead of the characters you decide to animate… the players? Bad call.
Fantastic!!  The call backs are awesome, the pacing is great, it keeps much of the feel of the previous intro, and suits the song well!  Wonderful job!!
Loved a lot of it.. There are some scenes that are a bit scuffed, but well done :)
Awesome ^^
Reminds me of a 90s tv show opening.
RIP Bertrand
This is amazing, the colors the everything, I hate that people have to make themselves seem interesting by saying they like different ones better, like ok no one cares
I have to be honest, not my favorite but i really like this one i feel there is put so much personality into this opening. The idea of starting the video with a dice roll is so D&D. Good job guys 👍👍
The art style is so beautiful, I love the use of pastel colours in this campaign + Travis going beast mode is epic af !!
The wonders will never cease
Please bring back the ORIGINAL Critical Role T-Shirts!!!!!! PLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!! (just the critical role logo on front and back)
This is pretty bad
Ah, good, bye-bye colonialism porn intro
Back in my day we would dress up and carry our selves to a park and roll die face to face. None of this fancy pants ttrpg twitch or YT video non sense. Back then it was just called, "playing RPGs". So ill just sit on my porch until I critically hit someone with my cane and tell them to get off my lawn or I will unleash my *"creeping doom" on them. Note: "Creeping doom" is my pomeranian's  name. And yes I'm a multiclass 18th level druid/1st level merchant(real life).
Looks like the audio is off by a couple seconds. Either way, I still like the live action more. The table scenes were fantastic.
Dope af.
Legitimately upset when I realized it was not Thursday night and the show was about to start hahahaha.
I really like this intro, especially the Travis Werewolf part and the part with Taliesin, the hammer and the shards. Spectacular.
The first C3 intro was the best
No disprespect to anyone who worked on this. But honestly seeing them in this animation creeps me the hell out. Specifically their faces
Not my cup of tea, but congratulations on the hard work 👍🏻
Not gona lie. This doesn't do it for me. The art style feels amateur-ish and choppy.
My favorite one is still the animated campaign 2 intro. Best music too.
This. Is. Stunning.  The visuals and the vocals. Amazing!
The whole thing is stellar, but I have to say, the coolest looking part by far is the start when Matt claps and starts the big bang
Eh...
Super lgbtq I love it
I'll be honest. Cool idea but it looks bad. The music doesn't match up and the art style while interesting doesn't match the themes or the player/characters. Hopefully they learn from this and either go back to the old one, even with the minor issues people had with it, or quickly get a new one.
Ngl this looks pretty cool
Wow! This is really cool! "It's Thursday Night" is my favorite Crit Role song and this animation has my favorite Crit Role opening visuals.
Spectacular. I like them all tbh.
I feel like this was rushed out as a response to complaints about their previous intro, and given that those complaints were started by some idiot white lady who co-opted other cultures outfits for herself, meaning that her complaints were hypocritical and bad faith at best, I really don't think Critical Role should have listened at all and just kept the awesome original intro.
I. LOVE. THIS. The colors, the transitions, the identifiable character traits overlaying the actors, THE ROTOSCOPING AHHH!  I feel like they have deliberately put the focus of the intros back on the players rather than the characters, and for good reason! Campaign 2's animated intro is amazing, but I feel like it had the unintended effect of causing the fandom (mostly the toxic parts of the fandom) to focus on the characters more than the actors in a way that probably had some negative impacts on the cast. It was almost as if the toxic parts of the fandom only cared about the characters and not the actors who controlled them.   So I'm glad these intros for campaign 3 have shifted that focus more to the cast again, like the 1st campaign! It's a message, honestly, for us to keep in mind that this show we love would not exist without these real life people, who are only human. The players come before the characters, always. They are the ones who are real.
Ehhh I miss CR2 animated intro that was the 👌
Not a fan tbh 😂
It's ok
I love the animation, but I feel the old, live action one (for obvious reasons) Matches the music much more, and it's cool to see them actually doing those things, rather then (beautiful) Drawings.
Travis morbed bro
Waking Life vibes! I'm all for it!
So just the season of meh intros. Cool
Sorry, I'm not hating, but no...big nope
brasil Brasil Brasil
I would occasionally watch the C2 intro for the hundredth time during my 3rd rewatch of that campaign. I've always skipped the C3 intro, and if this is the direction, I'll continue to do so.
I think Travis just wanted to be able to be werewolfy! Which who wouldn't
Nice
neat
Just beautiful
This one's excellent, I'm glad they made the change. The previous one was, at best, awkward, the "colonial / tomb raider" look for a campaign based in Marquet that took inspiration from a Western-Asian setting felt deeply unappropriated. Not sure the consultants who helped Matt work on Marquet were consulted for the opening sequence 💀
Liam O'Brian looks like he would fit in an isekai world really well seeing him swing a sword around
Looks weird
I really like the animation style of this intro. It is very colorful and fun. However, I still think "It's Thursday Night" isn't as well-paced a theme song as "Your Turn to Roll". Because of that, both this animated intro and the previous live-action one drag on a bit too much for me. That's just my personal taste though.
I watched this fully prepared to be mad because I love the other one so much, but WOW! This one is wonderful too! It was so satisfying to see the blend of their characters' powers flaring through the players themselves. Very cool!
They somehow made it even worse than the corny live action one lmao. Actually it fits C3 perfectly.
Dude, that was awesome. :)
I love this. It really sets a mood of fun and adventure!
This is my D&D character. There are many others like him, but this one is mine.
Ralph Bakshi would like this. Maybe not sexy enouth..🤣
I love the 'Big Bang ' by Matt at the start
Does something important happen on Thursday night?
I really don't like it gives me creeps in the bad meaning of the word
eh, tbh not my favorite intro. May end up skipping this one :(
OMG <3
I like it, but i prefer the real action one
I’m so impressed I don’t know what else to say other than these emoji. 💛🖖🏻
I've watched this opening twice now and it brought tears to my eyes both times. I have never seen a better representation of what it's like to be yourself and yet able to be whatever you want to be while around the gaming table. Players bring parts of themselves into their characters; their passions and dreams give them life. You can be what you want to be around the table. This opening shows what D&D and other RPG's are supposed to do: bring friends together and give them the chance to explore both their world and themselves in a way they could not otherwise have done. Thank you to Critical Role for all you do and for allowing us to be part of your journey.
It crosses a bit in the uncanny valley for me, i dont really like it tbh
I liked the old one better I think. This one feels kind of rushed like it wasn't ready to be used yet but they used it anyway.
the prophecy... Is true.  Ok but for real that was pretty and sweet.
Sadly this seems kinda generic. I really thought the original intro was pretty cool and was hoping they'd eventually get one out featuring the characters instead of the players. This seems kind of like a stop gap with a  lot less production value. Rotoscoping can be cool, but the choices with the generic bright colors and tunnels of light feels like a high school project without much character.
WELL DONE!
Im getting a Headeache because of the low FPS.
So cool! Would be dope if they had the players fully morph into the characters in the animation.
rotoscoping? nice  glad to see that style of animation get more use, especially with this level of quality
Everyone's faces look REALLY uncanny. The rotoscope just makes their faces look like a poor Snapchat filter :/ Hopefully it grows on me!!
the dorian at the end 🥺 i still miss my blue haired bro
“And welcome back…”
It looks like shit…
Seeing everyone elses comments about the music beats not quite hitting as hard on the transitions and wondering if the animation was re-edited with the at-table segment at some point? Or just something changed there that throws it off a little. I feel like the music lines up well in the solo segments up until that moment. And then After that, if u line up matt closing the book with the musical beat [its about a 3 second shift] it fits better again. it also has marisha standing in her chair to match with "friendship will rise"  People are feeling something not quite coherent between the sound and visual and I feel like its around that table section where it gets a little muddled  [The at-table parts look like they were shot at a different time too considering sam is clean shaven compared to his solo shot with a beard idk if its related just curious]
Pate on the chair!!!!!
Pretty good, but the Mighty Nein animation is still the best one for me overall. Both animation and the music
THIS IS AMAZING!!
I am speechless. This animation is out of this world
Much better than the previous intro. Thank you for changing it. Though as someone who was raised on Atlantis I *do* get it.
Better than the live action one, but doesn't come close to It's Your Turn to Role
"Were we paint in one of the universes?"
Pretty cool tbh. However, personally I  preferred the previous one.  This one looks 'weird' in many places.  Again, just my useless opinion ;-) Plus the cast consists of beautiful people, why replace that with an OK-ish 'animation', I dont get it.     At least the animation for C2 was great.  I dunno, maybe they've explained this change somewhere. I'm sort of ok with this change, it is only an intro after all. But all in all, it gets a stamp of "slight disappointment" from me.      And yes, some will love it, some will hate it. And this is my opinion. Simple as that.  <3
I LOVE IT!!! You guys rock!!!!
Brilliant  Love it :)
All kinds of epic.
OMG I loved it!  After just one watch, I was so excited!  It really colorful but also pretty subtle.
I like it overall but it does feel like the music to animation is off by about half a beat.
wow thats insanely good, couldnt be any better
Meh.
I love how Liam points his sword with all the leaves towards Marisha as a beautiful homage to Keyleth. <3
Woah, that's dope as hell.
Nom nom nom nom I'm eating it all up nom nom nom SO GOOD SO TASTY SO MUNCHY CRUNCHY
Is it Thursday yet
fucking epic
Whoever made this, STANDING OVATIONS AND CHILLS!!!
Really rotoscoping? you do you ig lmoa
Love it
epic AF, but for me i would of thought if they transformed into their characters as they all landed at the end would of made it more epic
So thankful for a shout out to Dorian and Bertrand. These guys really know and love their fanbase. I feel I'm starting to become a full blown Critter. Best wishes from Poland.
Matt with beard just gives him extra power!
I prefered the season 2 song, but damn this art is amazing!
They all look so Good in rotoscope. Don't know why it is but it really accentuates peoples faces in a attractive way
Am I just being a bit of a party pooper in that what I loved so much about "Your Turn to Roll" is that it visualized the game rather than the players.  I would have loved an intro like that.  When I think of Campaign 2 I think of Juster, Nott, and Caleb not Laura, Sam, and Liam.  This feels like a video about Marisha, Ashley, and Talesan with little nods to their in game characters.  I love these people, but I listen for the stories of their characters.
The transformation of Travis with the werewolf is fucking 🔥 🔥 🔥
It's clear this took a lot of time, effort, and care and people are trying not to say it but it's really not... good.  Gram Gram Animations did a pretty thorough look at the technical reasons, find that comment, I'm sure it's in the top somewhere, as to why so I'll do some more subjective thought and opinion, which again remember this is my opinion, if you like it good on you!  First let's put something elephantine in the room out of it's misery.  The reuse of the audio (mistake) and continued theme of "players at a table" focusing on the players not a character I don't think is an accident.  If I had to guess this, like the last version, is aimed at creating a reusable, general intro which can go at the front of any main CR series without needing rework.  My guess is that this creation, with it's incredible, bright color pallete, and removal of ANYTHING ELSE that might remotely be referential or geeky, is a reaction to the backlash from a group of community members calling the original insensitive, pro-colonial and a tease about their "cultural appropriation" and whitening/europeanization of Africa.  Which is dumb, since that stupid shit died down awhile ago.  It lacks all the geeky, nerdy character we (I and others) actually love the players for, it's washed them of character other than their character. *bang* that's the elephant done.  Aside from that it's just... a worse version of live action, which is in part because they've never done this kinda work before, and in part because it just... is.  They coulda left this live action, on greenscreen and created the fantastical dreamy feel around the real people and it woulda looked 10x better, avoided all the technical issue, and they could have done soft transitions into the roto for the character aspects, such as travis wolfing out (which I thought was a visual glitch until people pointed this out) into a puddy roto wolf Travis which transitions over to the next character, the anim sword falling into real liams hand and transitioning him into puddy roto dream liam, shadow falling around real marisha and turning her into puddy marisha.  Not only would this have saved some effort it would have lender more to a telling of real people playing out a fantastical dream.  In essence, while the effort for this is clear in terms of work it's reuse of intention AND music from the original make it feel like a hasty rehash of the same thing with no thought in it other than "how do we bleach this so as few people are offended as possible" and frankly, I'm offended!  Well not really, it's pretty and standalone I do like it, I just don't like it in the context of other knowledge I have.
I feel it's better than it was but not as good as "Your Turn to Roll"
One question, what have you allowed Talesin to feed to animators, this thing is breathtaking and trippy!
Love it! Just needs some fine tuning. Some parts seem “laggy”
That small bit of travis' transformation is what I imagine every time he says "I would like to RAGE".
Try playing the video in 1.5 Speed. It'll make the animation look more smooth and it looks better.
I like the art style, but… the other one was better. If you’re doing animations, giving bits of what the characters do, then why not just animate the characters instead of the player? This just doesn’t feel right
The intro is pretty in a sense. It is getting slightly closer to my favorite intro which is from C2, I know its hard to strike that magic twice in a row. But this one does have some neat things about and the popping colors is great. I just hope this cools the tits on twitter who are always just looking for something wrong because they literally have nothing else better to do with their lives.
Okay but I love this. Even more than the other intro 👌🏻
It just brings tears to my eyes to see how far you all have come. Cheers!
I like what they were going for in terms of themes, but everything seems off. Art style is the biggest complaint I have.
as always, that looks amazing.
This is so awesomeeeeeeeeee
I'm just happy for Travis. Immortalized on the internet as a werewolf.
I hope eventually we will have an animated one with the characters of Bell's Hells, this one is cool though, but I would always love to see the characters brought to life as an intro.
What is this
This shits awesome idk what y'all are talking about.
I wonder if guests would be rotoscoped in, but I didn't see where they'd fit.  Good to see Dorian's art at the end, though :)
Every intro always makes me cry 100% of the time and I cannot say exactly why. Like, it touches me. These guys friendship and passion, and how they are the story. I have spent years crying at EVERY INTRO YOU DO EVERY TIME I WATCH.
That beginning was just so much of a Doctor Who vibe
I'm way behind on C3 but this show is still one of the few where just an intro can make me tear up.
So much better than the live action.  It actually improved he song.
Yeah, that'll do....
I don't comment often, but this might be the most uncanny opening I've ever seen.
I gotta say, I don't like it. The vision you had is really cool, but I don't like the result. It is very uncanny valley, the animation doesn't sync well with the music, it's very jittery.  It's not for me personally.
Why does Tal look like an evil dark lord?
Delightful!
Many drugs were taken to create this
all the deteils omg !!! sooo good
So very well done!!  Love it!
The frame rate at the beginning and the photosensitivity issues after matt claps his hands are really hurting my eyes. But everything from Ashley onwards is very cool.
They changed the opening already? We've had like only 15 episodes with the first one
Still misses the magic of the old CR2 intro. Why are we ignoring the characters? That's what people are here for.
Ahhhh I love this new opening so much!!! So good. Love the vibrancy and energy. It’s also so beautiful
OMG 😱 ❤️😍🥰 I F*CKING LOVE IT! Keep this one. WAY BETTER THAN THE FIRST! That Matt Part is AWESOME, but LAURA’s PART WAS BEST!
Hey so last opening (same song) I was a bit critic about some points, and I now realise that it can pass as more critic than it really is. So just wanted to say I'm admirative of the amazing work, you guys rock, and it was a great opening! As is this one. :)
Really cool!   It looks like the names are actually their signatures,  and I like the incorporation of the actors portraying their characters.   Also cool that they listened to the concerns about the original c3 intro regarding colonialism.    Nice touch adding the character art at the end for Matt's major characters and the guests we've had so far.
So epic, and catchy! However, I’ll forever miss the character intros just like in season 2, “Your turn to Roll!” But I have to give props to the creative department making these, I have enjoyed both the previous intro and this one. We’ll done and a great way to amp up the excitement.
this is really cool but at the same time the faces are the stuff of nightmares lol
Perfection. Sublime. I can only say: two thumbs up. Job very well done!
this may be a hot take, im a huge critical role fan i have a bunch of merch and the minis. this opening is hot fucking garbage. the animation is terrible and choppy at some points and it just looks like throw up
omg i love this soo much
This is so great!
THIS IS GORGEOUS
Ralph Bakshi would be proud :D   I love the animated LOTR vibes at the table-sit scene.  The little nods to each of the characters to the players intros is genius.
Critical Role. Kill your darlings. Seriously.
Beats are a little off, but this is still very cool. Shame to be getting rid of the first intro, I think it was far better than this AND felt much more real, more human... this doesn't get me as excited to play D&D.
I’ll say it, this is bad guys. You’re a multimillion dollar company, y’all can do better, come the fuck on
Stunning...absolutely love this.  The hints to each character really sells it.  Cant wait to see it on my big screen.
this is amazing! I love it!
That's gorgeous
campaign 2 still has the best opening
Problem: Rotoscope animation usually looks stiff and unnatural. The ideas are there, they’re great, but could be better
I mean, it's ok, but, can someone tell me why, why you decided to change the intro? The first one was just fine and it looked like you people took real time and effort to make it... just to throw it away for this one. It's a mystery to me? 😉
I got excited that this meant they were doign an animated version of campaign 3!
1:31 Matt Mercer looks like Jesus xd and Taliesan looks cool in rotoscope with the battle poses
Damn this makes me happy
Really cool, but man will I have nightmares of some of those expressions!
oh my god...
Looks amazing! Love it!
ROTOSCOPE ANIMATION! ROTOSCOPE ANIMATION! ROTOSCOPE ANIMATION!
Good luck trying to ever top that x)
I like it.
Holy fuck thats beautiful
I love this so much more! It always bothered me that everyone was wearing bland, black outfits when they all have such unique and awesome styles. The subtle/not subtle character flourishes are great! I totally expected Travis to full-on wolf-out!
That intro is amazing. Matt at the end holding the book as the camera pans up towards him and the NPCs appear behind him.
HOW IS MATT EVEN SEXIER IN ANIMATION FORM?!?!?!?!?
When they announced there would be a new animated intro, my first thought was "isn't that too soon? The live action one is still super fresh. Oh well, I can't wait to see the character animations". So yeah, for me it was pretty disappointing. The live one is better overall as well.
I absolutely adore that opening pan of the C3 character cast as tabletop minis
Super! Gives a total 80's A-Ha! Take on me music video vibe. Top notch!
I hated the goofy faces in the last intro tbh, never been a big fan of the live action ones as much as the stylized ones, besides the campaign 1 live action intro that one was awesome. I love this one, so much better then the old one!
Rotoscoping was certainly a unique decision. Idk how I feel about it tbh. It gives some serious uncanny valley vibes for me
Animation and everything is awesome, but for me, the previous one is better :)
Looks a little awkward and even gross? I think because of the uncanny valley of rotoscoping. It's not bad, and props to the artist, but I mean It literally does hurt my eyes to watch.
Holy cow, the vast majority of people didn't like this.
omg
miss the intros with the in game characters though...
pog.
Wow. So incredible
this is kinda shit, what happened to the iconic JCM theme?
This is an animated… Motion capture maybe… Wish we had an intro more focused around the characters
The campagain and everything around CR is great so pls take this as construktive critisim. Imo the Intro is very much in the uncanny vally and it doesn't fit too well with the song. I like the RL intro with the cast and would wish that you show a bit more of the characters, if you decide on an animated intro. Keep up the good work!
ok but why does rotoscoped liam look so good
0:04 i was expecting Adventure Time
Hoping this is a midway intro for a little while (tbh looks a little cheap and it physically hurts my eyes), and we get an INCREDIBLE one later down the road!
I love the aesthetic but what keeps me from fulling enjoying it is that it doesn't seem to match with the song in terms of timing and some of the scene transitions is kinda clunky. Well done but I think could have gone through one or two more editing rounds.
Very 80's / 70's feel with the color palette.
It's evolving!!! Just backwards...
Not a massive fan of this...
Travis finally gets to be a werewolf. This alone makes the new intro iconic.
What in the 10 fps is this
It's clearly rotoscopped, not animated xD
Ashley looks so pretty in that art style.  This was amazing to watch and well done.
their are lot going to be able to top C2 intro.
To be brutally honest, I don’t really like this one that much, it’s cool and all but as many others have said, I don’t really see the point in an animated intro if it doesn’t have the characters like the animated C2 intro, this just feels like the old intro but a little bit more painful to look at to me.   I feel bad but, it’s how I feel
I very much approve!!!
I tell you I got goosebumps watching this. Awesome Job.
i'm not crying you're crying :')
Honestly, this was a fun new opening. I like it
Amazing! Wish the characters had made some kind of side-by-side appearance though!
I really appreciate the effort put into this intro. While it doesn't pizzaz me like the others, I still love the newfound effort to keep every part of this show fresh
I love this theme song, idk which of the critical role themes I like more but this is up there. Although I still think the theme for The Unexpectables campaign 2 tops all the other, if you haven't heard that one then I recommend listening to it even if you dont watch the campaign.
Why am I crying? Why am I crying!!??
Epic!
Ooh :( I wished to see their actual characters being animated. It's definitely not bad (a little bit out of sync) and amazing but I was so excited to see an animatedly fcg, Ladna etc. They'd be so great and their attacks and transformations could be way more exaggerated instead of using the real players.   It'd be so great if they have the cast transform into their characters!
Can't believe you guys released this on a  Friday morning... what a missed opportunity...
How do these things keep getting better?!?’
Terrible.
Kind of soon for a new intro, I didn't mind the old one to be kept untill one showing the characters is made, like maybe 50 episodes in or so.  I guess they really went more artistic with it here, maybe it will grow on me but I think most of us are still waiting for the final intro with all the characters.  The rotoscoping I just don't like much, but I do hope they will update this one a little so the music syncs better with the visuals.
I like the nods to campaign 2. Nott swordboarding, Caduceus and Residuum, Yasha with sword, and Fjord with shield (might be a stretch)
I'm getting a lot of uncanny vibes from this
OMG this came out so good I love how it's painted this was done so well
This is trippy.
props to the artist... but it hurts my eyes to watch.
Does anyone know what the white building in the first second is?
C2 animated intro was fathoms better. As others have pointed out, we see the people behind the characters all the times, its the characters we want to see brought to life. Might as well keep the live action intro they already have.
Interesting
I want the old one back, not a fan of this one.
that's a nope from me... not good
much better at 1.5x playback speed on mute and the sound track in another tab
I liked the original better, but by the end, I'm saying, "fuck it. This is fun."
ok, always going to love the og intro, but this is fun!
This is adorable
awesome 10/10 would recommend  .
a masterpiece!
Damn. I think this did the inconceivable and topped Your Turn to Roll for me.
This is beautiful, I love the scene in the beginning with Matt in particular
So much better.
OMG OMG this is so awesome!
Beautiful
This feels like the gods creating Exandria.
Fuck me. They all look like they are on drugs in this one to me 😅
HOLY SH*T!!!!! I'm FULL of goosebumps!! That's AWESOME!!!! Love the live action one, but this animated one is great too!!! Well done, everyone!! Is it thursday yet?!
I'll always love the intros but sometimes when I pause on certain frames, I get cursed images and it's amazing
It looks very epic.... But Matt just looks like Jesus floating in the sky like that haha
I appreciate this a lot. You can tell they took the feedback they received from their first C3 opening and took action to make it better.
This is amazing!!!
Goose bumps!
Hahaha... what??
HOW IS THIS SOOO GOOD! You guys, chills! Ugh beautifully done.
It’s just beautiful. Colourful, eye catching, and really visually pretty.
I’m not the biggest fan of this intro. The music is really epic sounding and the visuals are kinda not fitting that vibe. I kinda wish it was the old visuals or the 80s style animations like the campaign 2 intros
Kool
I love the "trippy colors" and animation style, not sure why we needed a replacement? I hope it wasn't because of all the "imperialism troll" bullshit that happened...
Yeah I couldn't even finish this,talk about a step back in quality
Who else thinks the cast should get vocalist training to get gutteral/scream metal singing? Then we could get a full heavy metal version to rock to. Lol
What's the building at 0:00 - 0:01 mark referencing?? Am I missing something?
It's cool and all, but no Robbie on the new one :(
That’s so wicked
No
I just don't like it. Like, I don't even get why they need a theme song, every action they make is stepping further and further away from what they were supposed to be. But hey, if you have money spend it I guess. I'm glad they are having fun
Honestly, not a fan of the real life versions of the cast being in the intro. I miss the animated characters and seeing the different aspects of the world brought to life with 2d animation. I totally get waiting until we are 20+ episodes so as to avoid spoilers and to have a better grasp on what direction the party will go w/ the plot. The C2 intro was fire (both song and animation). LOVM intro was gorgeous, but was missing a bop. C3 has an amazing song, but has been lackluster with the videos :(
i like this one better than the live action one :)
this is so unique, oh my lord   i am LIVING
I would love to see a making-of for this title sequence! Definitely one of the most unique ones yet!
I like this
This is pretty but I'm still working my way through Campaign Two so it's going to be a while until I get the context…I am expecting it to be totally worth the wait though 👍
The art style is so cool but I was so hoping that we were moving on from the Its Thursday Night theme :/
Nice, but I also prefer the live version. The song is the most amazing part, it's iconic!
Is it Thursday yet?
I'm wondering if the gap between Matt and Laura is where they'd put longer staying guests like Robbie was,
I almost cried during the ending drawings with Bertrand and Dorian
I hate to say it but I'm not a fan of this.   Oh the intro is nice and playful but the song was written for the other opening and I personally enjoyed the live performance performance the cast did in the jungle temple set. Gave me legends of the hidden temple vibe every time.   For those that like it please enjoy. It just doesn't hit right for me.
The theme song for 4sided dive is way better than this song. I wish they had used that theme song for the main show instead of the side show.
Amazing work guys!
I really like this.
I understand why they changed the opening, but this one just isn't...good.
Love this!  My 2 year old daughter just watched it with me and kept saying "ooooh"  and "aaaaah!"  Safe to say it's a hit.
I love the "A Scanner Darkly" vibe!
I just, don't like the song tbh
Very take on me-esque. I like it
Not my cup of tea. Live action one it better
Definitely a decrease from the c2 intro but still pretty  good!
I still like the other Crit Role theme. It was so fun to sing.
The frame rates on this feels kinda low?
I always feel like my emotional response to these songs too intense for a show intro, but there are so many years of memories and feels from Crit Role and my home games that come flooding in whenever I hear a CR song... it just gets me.
Eh. I liked "your turn to roll" better.
Meh. I liked the other one better.
Beautiful!
Quite meh. Enjoyed original one more.
I mean, it's very well done. But the artstyle just doesn't jive with me. I really don't like it, and wish it featured more of the characters like C2's opening. But hey, they wanted to do something new and we're here for it always :D
well its...colorful
Not bad not bad
Everything about this is stunning, but my highlights gotta be  1) Liam’s Orym sword sending an Air Ashari breeze to Marisha who then evokes the transition from Keyleth to Beau to Laudna with just her body language 🤯💗 2) Matt’s cheeky lil eyebrow raise at the end
It's alright, but doesn't beat the previous one and certainly not the animated Mighty Nein intro
I am sure a lot of effort went into this intro and yes it's neat and all but I feel it would better fit one of the behind the scenes shows (like Talks Machina) where we actually watch the actors behind the scenes. Personally I feel that Critical Role campaign intros are best when they do as intros to pretty much all other shows do and show the characters of said program (like the Vox Machina intro where everyone was in full cosplay during Season 1 or the Your Turn To Role intro of Season 2).
I’m a big fan of all the old intro videos, this one feels a little cringe though. I still absolutely looooove the show!
That animation of Travis becoming a werewolf is great.
bRuH...g o o s e b u m p s .  AMAZING!
Cool
gives me chills! Good stuff CR, good stuff.
Much better than the last intro! Well done!
Yooooo this is SO GOOD! OMG that tribute to Bell and Dorian at the end 😱
Wait a second, are those Easter eggs?? I think you can briefly see them subtly transition from their past characters to their C3 characters???   0:16 Laura with Vex’s wink 😉 and then the playfulness of Jester, leaping into the role of Imogen 0:29 Ashley as Yasha swinging into view and finds herself in the Feywild, Yasha passing her sentiment towards flowers to Fearne's aesthetic. 0:37 Taliesin as Caduceus with the refined residuum crystal transforming into Ashton the earth genasi and break the crystal with his hammer 0:43 Travis as Fjord blocking the crystal shards with some sort of an arcane shield, and Chetney’s wolf form comes out for a moment. 1:05 Sam as Veth sledding down the snow with a sword in reference to “bladeboarding” during the Aeor arc at ep.115, then leaping into the air with patterns of cogs and gears in the background. 1:10 Liam catching the sword. Colours of flames from Caleb with Orym’s two moons in the background, blending with greens, then blasting fire with leaves swirling in the breeze. 1:15 for a second there, the wind from the air ashari catches in Marisha’s hair, then rising from Beau/Marisha’s signature perch, her hands dripping black ichor as Laudna.  Am I tripping??
This is awesome. I still don’t think “your turn to roll” will ever be topped, but this is pretty good, too!
It’s beautifully made but I don’t think it fits the setting of the campaign and the tone of the music. From readings the comments I understand the issues with the previous intro but I felt there were ways to change without doing a complete 180°. Again not issues with the actual production of this, I just think this gives more early episodes mighty Nein chaos crew vibes than energy marquet gives.that being said I’m sure it’ll grow on me somehow
I love critical role but what the hell is this it is so ugly my goodness
I like the new video alot. But it gives me a totally different vibe than the music. It just feels wierd to watch this together with this music.
Cool filter. A bit rough around the edges, but very cool.
You know guys, it’s just a game….lol
The amount of time this took to make makes my head hurt. Rotoscoped?
how fun! You guys are awesome.
Definitely preferred the original, still good though
And chills yet again
I really like this one better than the first one.  The whole exaggerated faces and fake chaos made me so uncomfortable I couldn't stand it. I love it when they stick to the character's traits and themes. C2's animated one was the best intro and I hope they keep making animated intros like that but until then, i love this one.
SO COOL! It has that roto vibe, but there are elements of it that are wayyyyy smoother than pure roto (I.E. hair shading tracking really really smoothly) and this is so pretty to look at. I've watched it like 4 times in a row!
Very very good intro!  But I will fix the animation in the Marisha segment when she drop off the chair. There's a little gap that it's annoying (at 1:20)
Love, love, love the new intro!  You find some of the most impressive talent for animating things, it's just incredible!  Also.... Is it Thursday yet?
Just wow…
It's Thursday night is still not the CR theme, and i will insist as much untill Your Turn to Roll returns.
I love you guys
Wow, looks awesome
So fuckn rad
This is so fucking sick I was fighting back tears of joy. Amazing. Those involved with animating this deserve a raise. 10/10
Noooo the other one was so much better!
Well it's not bad. But those facial expressions are kinda creepy
very nice
Loved the first intro for the clear personality on display, and I’m so happy it didn’t get lost in the translation to animation. Absolutely fantastic ❤️❤️
This is amazing
OMG I GOTS ME SOME CHILLS AFTER SEEING THAT! Wow what another FANTASTIC intro!😁👍
For those wondering why this doesn’t hit for them, here’s my thoughts as an animator:  1.) The music is not synced correctly. I can’t tell if it’s because of the animation, or if someone messed up when the music starts in the final render. The music being off though makes all the big transitions fall flat, taking away all of audible impact they should have.  2.) Rotoscoping at a low FPS is often worse to the human eye than both live footage and hand drawn animation. This looks like it was done at 12 FPS. Pure rotoscoping like this also takes away many animation principles, such as easing, anticipation, and over-exaggerating. As a result, everything will look really stiff, unless you try to make things look hyper realistic, which requires at least 24 or 30 fps.  3.) Choppy camera movements. The footage they rotoscope is footage with a moving camera. In animation, you can get by with animating at a lower frame rate, but often you still want to keep the camera movements at a high frame rate, otherwise it will make everything look choppy. Think of old school video games on the Nintendo: the characters animations are slow, but the background scrolls at 60 fps, making everything very smooth. Because CR provided footage with a moving camera, the people rotoscoping couldn’t add in their own camera movements, and so the final animation ends up being much more choppy. This is especially noticeable when everyone is at the table.   In addition to this, there are times where they could’ve added their own camera movements themselves, but didn’t. The limitation of purely rotoscoping makes the camera feel even more stiff. Adding some camera shake as Orym’s sword flies though the air, or as Sam snowboards would add a lot more movement and liveliness to the action. Adding zooms and slow camera pans to a scene can also make it feel more alive and direct the viewers attention.  4.) This is more of a personal taste, but I really wish they did more with exaggerating the character details. I love the little Travis wolfing out moment, but I wish they went harder and more extreme with those ideas. Taliesin and Liam’s parts are probably my favorite in terms of animation direction. Ashley’s is also just very well animated I think.  5.) Theme. Another personal take. They stuck with a color pallet, but I really wish the pallet incorporated the themes of everyone’s characters to better highlight their personalities. Give Laudna her dark goth girl vibes. Give Taliesin the purple and green and yellow tones of Ashton.
Love the style! Especially from Ashley and Taliesin
This gave me goosebumps, really well done!!
1:20 **Pained chuckle** omfg the chair squat
It's not the best, song is still great. The animation is meh. Won't stop me from tuning in though
Amazing, I still like the live action one more I think, but the little character details on this one are beautiful
Maybe it'll grow on me... Hopefully
This is just my 2 cents - and my opinion is probably worth less than that - but the original live action intro appealed to me more than this intro.  Not saying it's bad, so don't start jumping down my throat!  Just that the original intro appealed to me more!
Banger
The new disco elysium looks great!
That was fantastic.  I really like how they mix their RL selves with traits from their characters!
Mixed feelings.  The original C3 ‘live action’ was great, but seemed to fit more with a ‘Call of Cthulhu’ storyline. This one is fine, but doesn’t seem to fit the song’s timing.  While done partially, it would be interesting to slide the actors into their character visuals more completely. Seeing Sam turned into FCG and Travis down to a gnome (along with the rest) would be fun.
Much better! Phew. Music is still cheesey, BUT this animation really helps cut through that to the underlying feeling of excitement.  So hugely less cringey to me than their pose-ey and accidentally a bit imperialistic feeling live-acted intro. A good fix. I may actually stop skipping the intro at all costs, just enjoy it for a while!  (And if you liked the previous one: good for you! That's totally fine. I'm just saying that to my tastes this is huge leaps and bounds better)
Honestly, not my favorite. I hope they rotate it again at some point.
I love how you try to keep things fresh. But I liked the old one way better.  But who cares. It's the game that matters.
I could watch hours of rotoscope Sam.
Matt missed the boat not being a romance novel cover model
A Scanner Darkly.
This is like, really bad guys
love this opening, the music is probably the best so far, but theres some weird framerate things going on, where some times the rotoscoping looks smooth and sometimes choppy... stylistically its beautiful, the colours are gorgeous, but the framerate thing is a real turn off because it doesnt seem consistent dfshjjfksfd. Still fantastic work though!!!
C2 theme was better
Goose bumps
Dorian <3 forver in my heart... Thanks Robbie and see you again!
Meh... I get that they feel like they are making unlimited money, but how many openers do they need to create for the same thing?  That's money that could go into a lot of other things, including just paying their staff.
I can't watch it due to immediate motion sickness from the animation frame rate, which is bizarre as i have never had this issue before.  Hmmm. Not sure how to get past this...
Honestly the live action is better
I dunnnoooo
I got blessed living in the same period of time as critical role
Gotta admit, I much prefer the live action sequence. I'm actually a little disappointed that it's been swapped out already to be honest. The animation and style is nice I suppose, but for me, the fun and mischievousness shown in the live action intro is just brilliant. Ah well, I guess that's two minutes saved now...
That gave me goosebumps
I dunno, not a total fan of this one. I feel like the Life Action intro you guys did was better. No a total fan of roto animation, it's kind of low fps and at times its got a pretty uncanny valley feel (I get that feeling from about the 30-second mark.  I really want to like it, I am a total fan of you guys, but this one didn't stick for me. So please don't take this as hate, just... yknow I feel like the 1st one was better.
As always...wow!
Glad to see the live-action one go. This isn't great for a not too dissimilar set of reasons; however, it's a definite improvement. If only marginally.
Chills! EVERY. DAMN. TIME. 🔥❤️
Love the live action better but this one us a lot of fun, like the animation style.
A little thrown off initially, but got into the style really fast. I like it!
The best one yet!
Complete and utter shivers I will never ever skip this intro this is absolutely amazing!!!!??!!!!
ITS SO COOOOL
aw I was hoping for a character centered animation. It made the characters feel sooo alive in C2 ... looks nice tho
not sure I like the art style, but eh can't please everyone. what i like is that they are willing to experiment and try some new stuff with it
Man seeing a lot of people liking this.  I see it looks like the animfy me filter on snap chat and then just recorded them doing stuff
Holy smoke.......that gave me goosebums O.O
love this? I how you rotate both the live-action and animated ones
Matt closing the book gave me chills tbh
Meh. Never understand the appeal of this art style. It's too uncanny Valley esque for me.    Also don't understand why they moved away from having the characters be in the intros, if this was done with the characters not the players it would be more enjoyable.   Cus with the slight nods to the characters, this is still campaign specific. So why bother doing it if you're not gonna show Laudna and crew?   C1s live action intro, and the animated c2 intro are still leagues ahead of this one, and pretty far ahead from the generic intro.
not my thing but i am guessing it was done well.
Did they change the Intro because someone said the last one was racist? I mean I don't mind the change but I hope that was not the reason.
It's gonna take sooo long for me to finally catch up, but damn this is a great motivation to do so.  This looks gorgeous, this sounds epic, gosh this is insane!
Yo, so you're straight up changing opening sequence like anime does when a new ark starts?   Alright, I'm down with that.
nah, the live action one was way better, sorry. I just don't enjoy this style at all
personally its not my style its too stylized but kinda weird and uncomfortable to look at i prefered the previous 2 openings when it was either just animated with the characters or live action with the players this weird in between just doesnt work for me and isnt pleasant for me to look at so despite the fact i love the show ill definitely be skipping the intro   (no offence to the artist etc who made it i just personally dont like it and find it unpleasant to look at especially since  i will be seeing it every week)
The animator definitely has a crush on Liam.
meh
I love the style so much but damn put some colour correction over that thing
amazing!!!
Oh dang! I don't envy the ppl that had to do this amount of rotoscopy! Looks nice though!
I will admit, I am impressed with the rotoscoping, but I still prefer the other intro better
Absolute scandal that liams segment was so short!!!! ><
The animations here are just so very beautiful! Love watching this and how everyone are presented
I really like both the song and animation, but they don't quite mesh. Like the music beats don't feel like they match the beats of the video. The first C3 video fit the song better.
Okay i guess. But its rough and kinda weird to have it animated but not in character. I dont like it but yeah. Its just an intro.
Preffer the old one personally but still cool
I'm too old to get excited like I'm hearing Saturday morning cartoon theme song...... is it Thursday yet 😂😂
Perfection
not gonna lie.. but.. well, this looks low-key horrifying.. It's interesting, artistic, but the faces look possessed xD
I really like this version more than the previous one, although it's pretty much impossible to beat Campaign 2s.
Nice, l like the style! Love both, honestly. But I'm always a sucker for animation :P
Maybe I'm looking too far into things, but I can't help but feel like the Intros are kinda setting up the tone of the adventures. The first one was a more grounded romp finding old secrets and exploring dangerous places and discovering new things. The new semi-psychadelic opening may be because we're going to be focusing on the feywild stuff happening in this campaign, and it fits the feywild being this weird otherworldly place. Very possible im just looking way, way, way, too much into things though.
This animation is INCREDIBLE
Speechless.  Beautiful, perfect, masterpiece.
I love it. It's so good.
Is it just me or does the timing feel off? It seems like the impactful moments are not in line with the music.
I prefer the live-action opening this time. This time it looks like one of those bad "drawing" filters was put over a bunch of normal clips from the show, and it just feels very underwhelming for the music it's playing with.
LOVE IT
This is insanely well done.
0 for 2 with intros this campaign.
Critically Awesome!! 🤘🏻
Should have had the cast morph into their character instead of just the subtle hints. I want to see the characters come to life.
well, that's rad as F*ck!
Although this one is amazing, there's something special about the live action version 😬. If they combined these, THAT'LL be the best opening ever. Like the neon light scribble effect.
FREAKING AMAZING GUYS 😍😍😍😍😍
so cool😱
Some interesting rotoscoping
I was not a fan of the new opening song.  But, I find myself enjoying it a lot more with this sequence.  I must not have been a fan of the visuals from the 0riginal opening.
This is awesome. I still like C2's better, but the art style of this one is breathtaking imo.
This is so good. Really gets you psyched for Thursday night.
OH NO THEY'RE HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWT
Did they really change it because of the stupid "controversial" original?
The first intro was drastically better.
Ashley 😍
Why does each member of the cast get such a different amount of screen time? I thought it was in my head last night, went back today and timed it... Laura's topping out at like 11 seconds of devoted time, and Sam only gets like 4 seconds. Laura 11.5, Ashley 10, Taleisin 6.5, Travis 9, Sam 4, Liam 6, Marisha 9ish... Matt 6. It just seems odd in an animation, where you control the segments, to not have them be a little more even.
This is high level.
This is way better 👍🏻
I like this opening more than the other one. Not because of what some have said about the subtext of it, but precisely because the vibe didn't seem to fit with this campaign.   This is nicer, more neutral.
That was absolutely freaking gorgeous.
I just wish the framerate was higher. I understand why, but it's such a disconnect with all the stuttering frames.
It's such a visually stunning piece. Kudos to the animators!
Finally, a perfect James Bond title song
this is so Flippin' Beautiful!!! 😍
Think I prefer this version!
I like how there were a few homages paid to previous characters.  Laura skipping like Jester, Sam snowswording like Yasha, the wind blowing by Marisha ala Keyleth
This was so surreally beautiful
I cant elaborate this enough but CR is perfection
Not biggest fan of Rotoscopy but its ok. But tbh nothing can beat Mighty Nein's animation. I guess i just prefer opening being about characters more than players :)
I think its time to call the guy from fear and loathing in Vegas to watch this opening properly
Its sad to see critical role going from friends playing a game together, to actors in a script
ITS SO GOOOOD
Am I the only one turned on right now?
Travis make a good sabertooth villain from wolverine comic
I was not expecting this but with Critical Role it’s epic as always!
An interesting visual experiment but ultimately I don’t like it 😔 I’m sorry. I prefer the fully animated or fully live action intros of yore. Kudos for trying things and keeping it fresh.
I always think they can't improve on the previous opening...then they do this!!😘
Now do it for the MN intro song. Bet that would also be amazing. I miss It
I find it a little pointless to use animation but then animate the players as they are. The live action one is already fantastic, if they were gonna make a new one, why not use the in-game characters?
I really don't like it, it comes across as low effort and cheap with the "watercolour filter", but I mean if that's the branding they wanna go with, sure.
Love this. Great expressions. Nice rotoscoping. The only thing I would suggestion is right at the end, just as Matt is closing the book, one eyebrow should raise. Nicely done.
Urf, too flashy and really not fond of the rotoscope animation. I hope we get a proper animated opening with the characters next time.
Hmm, I don't like it. I don't feel like it goes with the song very well, looks really rough at times, and lacks structure.
That wasn't very good.
damn
Can't top Campaign 2 song and animated opening.
Well played, Hells!
I like the original better :-(
I love this, and the animation is SO COOL! But, I really like the live-action one! I literally cried every time I watched the live-action version because their personalities, and bonds of friendship were so apparent and showed through so strongly.
Bagulho ficou brabíssimo, mané!!! xD
I like how they incorporated a characteristic from their character - that was cool.
Omg it’s amazing!!!!! Love seeing everyone as their characters 🔥🔥🔥
The most wonderful kind of camp bollocks. 🤌
My favorite is still the Mighty Nein animated intro.
yikes .
This is very well done.
This is beautiful! I just love the watercolour animated representations of all of you guys, and the way the characters were all represented too; from Travis's werewolf transformation, to the Fearne horns on Ashley and Laudna's black energy on Marisha. You know, I love Campaign 2's intro, but this is a perfect intro that encapsulates all of what Critical Role actually is.
It's like the Reading Rainbow intro, but with rocking tunes and D&D!
Love the show and cast, been watching since start of C1 - not a fan of this intro
I was prepared to be disappointed because I liked the last intro so much, but this is equally spectacular. Well done.
Bruh, It is like the lowest out of all openings so far
Really really cool. The faces go a bit uncanny valley in the art style, but everything f else is amazing
hooooooooly crap!!! My goosebumbs got goosebumbs. This gave me more then most movies. Very nice!
Nice. Still prefer the other with live-action and maps, or the Mighty Nein animation, but it's very well done and very nice.
reminder that the live action one caused a lot of controversy which might be a part of the reason this one was made?
honestly, everything CR does is incredible! i loved the previous one, but the new opening is just... beautiful! love u guys
Okay, this. Is. Another. Masterclass
Nothing beats the "Your Turn to Roll" intro, this is close though.
looks cringe
Not meaning to sound mean but this is by far the worst opening for Critical Role.
That looks like you all had a lot of fun making that! Beautiful!
That's gonna be a no from me dawg. Rotoscoping is a good tool to use if you're going to DO something with it beyond "toonifying" people for lack of a better term for others to understand. As time consuming as this must've been, it barely did anything that couldn't have been done with a green screen, live footage, and some props. It doesn't have the earnest heart of C1, the catchiness & Saturday morning cartoon vibe of C2, or even the standardization the live action one they've been using worked for. I wasn't a fan of the latest opening but it served as an opening that would cover all material for the channel. Being supportive is good, but it's also important to tell those you care for when they're making a poor choice or haven't done what they're capable of.
Loved it, very well done.
So I get part of the style is a low frame rate. But like... idk I'm vibing with it in this case. I usually dont advocate for this in animation but... wonder if they could use an ai to increase the frame rate a bit? It's something about the quick movements, the photo realism, and the like 12 fps that make it... a bit hard to look at for me personally.  Edit: I think it's mostly just the beginning where it stands out to me. I think it's the quick pan over the landscape that makes it look like its lagging
French kiss 👌 love it
I'm going to say here what I said on stream, this thing gave me some weird motion sickness/vertigo when I watched it live on twitch, I don't know if it has to do with the choppy animation or not, but I am going to have to avoid the intro video for the next...however long C3 lasts because wow that was bad.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!!  ✌️💙
An odd blend of cast and character. I want to see something that tells me "here is a tale of these characters" instead of "here is a tale of these people who are playing these characters"  It strikes me a bit like celebrity worship which leaves a bit of a sour taste for me.
That going to be a nope from me dawg. If i had to rank CR intros this would be at the bottom
OMG!!! THIS IS JUST ABSOLUTELY A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!!!
I love this, I also hope to see the Hells Bells in animated form too :3     Oh and live action like they did with C1!
I say they can never again exceed my expectations every time they do something but once again here I am FLOORED.... HOLY SHIT
This is so dope!!
love it, just amazing plain and simple
So creative and beautiful.  It’s great to see new intros that are great!  Love the style.
I think I like the Live Action version more. Personally I just don't really like the art style, but the song is just too good not to like it.
It's good but the mighty nein animated with the characters intro is the best style.
I very rarely complain about anything CR does but this intro is not it
the live action one is better.  this one is pretty, and isn't bad but...the live action one is just all around better.
This is probably my least favorite intro for crit role, but that doesn't mean I don't like it.
I’m going to miss the live action, but this is stunning!❤️
I didn’t know what to expect when they announced it, but I was NOT expecting this.   Truly beautiful, well done to everyone involved!
Best open yet. So subtle and direct simultaneously. Outstanding.
Magical
I actually do not like this new animated campaign 3 opening title. I actually enjoyed the live action one better. It’s not horrible it’s just not my kind of animation.
Every time they come out with a new intro, going all the way back to the first one they made in the G/S days of C1, I've always thought "This is the best intro they've ever made. No way can they get any better." Then they go and make this and do it again! I love this intro so much!!!!
I know that the live action one had some issues (and it's fine, the point made was actually very fair), but even tho the production value of this one is probably waaay more, I can't dig the 3D rotoscope with this art. If it was a 2D animation, would look less stiff and not strange.   I also know that this is the studio that worked on the new Amazon Prime animated series, but, it lacks depth on the volumes of the animation. The on set footage is kinda disturbing, especially Sam's jumping and screaming, my man is looking like he is a psycho. The beginning with the minis and the florest was awesome, but when Matt's jumped into with this rotoscope, it jumped me of the road with this one. :/
This is so cool!!
GOOSEBUMPS
I really like this!
I remember reading a post on r/criticalrole earlier today about someone who missed the animated opening of C2, and wished for something like that for C3.  Well, ask and you shall receive, I guess. Can’t wait for Monday!
It's good, but I think I liked the first one slightly better. Something about the slow motion sections with the cast being goofballs just fit so well with the vocals.  That being said, animation is kinda sick!
Is Sam snowboarding meant to represent F.C.G's wheel
Sam and Travis without props at the end is so funny. At least Travis crossed his arms!
Not better than C2 animated, but better better than the first C3 imo.
I think this is fantastic, with little touches of the characters in it (Imogen's Dancing Lights, Fearne's horns, Ashton's hammer, Chetney's transformation, FCG's gears, Catha and Ruidus for Orym, and Laudna's Form of Dread with Pate on the chair). And I think it's nice that we're STARTING with Matt for a change!
Now THAT is a decent opening.
Yaaaaaassssss!!!!!🤟🤟🤟🤟
My one take, ending should have the book already be closed then opened into the logo, since the story is starting again and not ending.
1:00 It appears Sa, had become an IRL ninja.
Liam rolled a nat 20 on charisma check in this opening
I'm sure they all love this experience , but Travis needs to get a poster of werewolf Travis in his house pronto
It gets better and better.
Really enjoyed the LA intro, but I dearly missed one that can be tailored to match the campaign. Love this
My preference is with that first one. Feels like a rushed response to the part of the audience that had gripes with the previous one. Still positive.
Woot!
the way it led from Liam to Marisha with the leaves blowing through her hair almost made me cry!! Keyleth still lives so dearly in their hearts and it's so nice to see
This is pretty awesome
I hope they do an animated intro like from Campaign 2
i LOVE ITTTTTTT
i mean... i dont like it... but great effort? do people have fond memories of scanner darkly? :P
Dope! DopeDopeDope!!! I can see the tattoo possibilities now!
Heck yeeeeeeees
I understand the choice of changing the last one, since it had robbie, though I still think this is not a good one :/
The First was was better.
This isn't nearly as good as the other intro...
I love this!!
Holy shit. Rotoscope animation takes forever. Well done y'all! 👏
I feel like this is a downgrade from mighty Nein animated opening
Eh, I still prefer C1 cosplay version.
6.5K
Holy fuck it got more epic, I didn't know it could get more epic!
Okay, not only is the animation here top-top quality; That animated logo at the end brought a really cool refreshing feeling to the nostalgia of CR.
Chills. Just chills.
Woa
THIS IS FREAKING INCREDIBLE well done it's SO GOOD
Absolutely PERFECT!! I LOVED this opening. I enjoyed seeing the little animated "nods" to their inner characters as it played. From THIS old 58 year old Critter...AWESOME JOB!!
Not my favorite thing but badass nonetheless
Is this MoCap?
Unpopular opinion, but it's not for me. Very disappointed.
The little details to the C3 characters they're playing, the mass bomb of colours, this is incredible. You have the characters and the players in a song about playing together. I love it.
I love it, Im so happy for you guys, nothing but love for each of you.
suuuper fab!!!! ahhh marisha on the chair <3
These people must be protected at ALL costs! 😆 You bring so much joy to so many lives. Thank you for what you guys do!
Is this what an acid trip feels like? But also like this is fantastic
This is awesome, but I will definitely miss the original c3 intro. I only just discovered that people apparently thought it was racist for some stupid reason, which is absolutely ridiculous and seriously reaching. I have a feeling this was the intended intro, but because rotoscoping takes so long it wasn’t ready yet. I remember Marisha saying that they were working on the intro when c3 started, so they may have thrown together the previous intro as a placeholder until this was finished 🤷🏻‍♂️
This is lovely!  Really giving me "Scion" vibes.
was this changed cos people got offended over the old one?
It looks cool but definitely far from my favorite opening. I wish the song lined up with the animation a bit better.
I do like changes but the premise for this change was odd and disheartening to see CR give into a handful of loud people who’re delusional.  But nice intro regardless
That's Ashley transform is bloody beautiful. And the pan to Marisha. I will hold my tongue about the bits I don't like. Think this one's going to be polarising.
I think this is my fav intro!!! This is soooo pretty!!!
I adore this, well done
i am hoping for anime opening intro next.
Amazing intro!
Marishas animation was in my opinion the simplest but also the most pleasing to watch. I wish someone would make me look like I had my characters traits 😅 lol.
Absolutely amazing job with this intro. Animation is insane. Love it! ❤️
caralhoooo mto foda
Yeah, not really feeling this one. Couldn't get into it at all.
P E R F E C T I O N! Beautiful, beautiful opening, guys! Wow! ♥
Okay, that was like 1,000 times better than the last opening sequence! Well done! Really enjoyed it!
Leave it to Marisha to fall as they say "Our friendship will rise"
I find it interesting how the group seems to get more personable with each campaign, and their intro themes seem to reflect that. In campaign one, it felt like there were a lot less out-of-character jokes per episode, and the intro theme was all serious and immersive. Then the second campaign got a bit sillier, and the intro music itself kind of acknowledged, "Hey, we're still just a bunch of nerds playing games around the table," though the animation was still character focused. Now we're into campaign three, and it seems like there are new jokes popping up every episode, and the intro theme is pretty much entirely focused on the people at the table, rather than the characters they portray. Really interesting phenomenon, considering that people usually get less personable once the spotlight is on them.  I'm nerding out right now. x'D
My only real critique is that the animation often doesn't line up properly with the musical beats. Some moments would hit harder if they were timed up a bit sooner or later (example, Matt's book slamming shut right before the final "night." That would have much more impact if it came after the line and cut to black on the last drum sound and the logo came up on the denouement. I don't know music terms, forgive me.)
This is my favorite one yet! Big love to the folks who worked on this <3
Animation is cool I guess. Prefer the prior one tho.
Fuck me, that's brilliant.
INCREDIBLE work. Love that this style can blend the fantastical and real so well. Every single frame is a work of art.
Love this! :) 😊
I still miss seeing the characters in the animation just like season 2, because we always see who plays in the stream anyways. But this is just amazing and really loved the new opening
Epic
hmmmmmmmmmm celestial themed with scenes zooming through the astral plane visiting other planets and spelljammer just announced for 5e.  Good... Very good.  *puts on Tricorne hat*
Rotoscope is a hell of a drug.
I’m not crying, you’re crying
I love that this emphasizes what playing the game feels like- that it’s focused on those moments when you’re sitting at the table with your friends and you’ve suddenly lost yourself in the story.
This was cool as heck love the style
This is incredible, is it wholly animated? It looks rotoscoped, reminds me of A Scanner Darkly, lol.
Honestly I like the first one a lot more than this one. Don't get me wrong it's pretty and creative but just feels mid to me.
They are such horrible nerds and I absolutely love them for it!
orym's swords leading to marishe is a good touch too, subtle but very nice
I wanna see the footage that got rotoscoped, the uncut version if you will
Some truly gorgeous animation right there.
first the Abbatars now the CRavatars!
I love that each of their introductions are themed after their Character. Imogen’s Electricity themed Psionics, Ashton’s Dunamantic Rage, FCG’s Automaton’s Gears, Chetney’s Feral Teeth, Fearne’s Druidic Fire magic and Satyr Rams, Orym’s Ashari’s sword and his own grace, and Laudna’s Undead Goopyness. Absolutely amazing.
Larry Niven and Steven Barnes wrote "Dream Park" in 1981 as Sci-Fi. Forty years later we still don't have a holodeck, but the other predictions have turned real.
God I love these so much, every into has there own unique style and I'm here for every one
Not the biggest fan of rotoscoping but I don’t mind this for now.
Absolutely incredible!! The animation style and the colours are perfect. Also, side note, all the cast have gorgeous singing voices
That was dope
This is astounding
like this one better, less goofy face ^.^plus personally i just prefer animated
I have mixed feelings about this one. I absolutely love the concept and the colours however it still feels rough (weird jumps in the animation) and like it needed a bit more time
I love it! I especially love giving the players their character abilities. Can you imagine if Marisha (not Laudna, but Marisha) actually had the inky eldritch magic? Matt would be so screwed! 😂
This makes me smile like an idiot, and frankly that's exactly what I needed
um....very artsey, lets pin that one on the side of the fridge
I was really hoping that Sam's song from the ending of last 4sided dive will become new theme :P
i like this better then the live action one simply because it doesn't make me think i am about to watch the bizarre fusion of Marvel What If and Agents of Shield
Oh gosh. I hated it.
The ending could have been more on beat with the book close, it's a nice intro though. Very good job to the team!
Honestly not a fan.
Me, roaring uncontrollably when Travis came up. Losing my shit completely when Liam caught the sword. Goosebumps. Fuck yes.
Is it just me that is kind of sad not seeing the shadow of Delilah behind Marisha?
Ngl, this made me smile, but I don't really like it
this is awesome. my favorite intro since the original C2 opening.
10/10
the song is dope but i think the animation could have been much better. it just feels like what we normally see but in a snapchat filter
Ashley Johnson is....breathtaking.
this animation style gives me a sort of whimsical 90's sitcom vibe
Nice!
Sick
Don't like it, the original is so much better
<3
It's very uncanny, kinda looks like Joel Haver's stuff, if you squint...
it's nice, but kinda hits that "uncanny valley" area for me. Think i prefer either live action with the cast, or animated with the characters. Animated cast just feels weird.
Love the color splashes. Reminds me of the ekko vs Jinx fight in Arcane
I want to like it and for the most part I would. But the eyes are so uncanny valley that it completely distracts me
Great work <3
feels tainted knowing they HAD to do this to stop the people saying the last opening was "glorifying historical figures that participated in mass genocide or slavery".... like, just enjoy the fucking show.
Well... WHO IS READY FOR ALL THE AWESOME COVERS OF THIS?!
we love subtle cosplay through animation
It's interesting, but I don't know if I really like it.
I don't know... the low fps style makes me dizzy.  Definitely not smth I will rewatch.
It's going to be really sad when one of the characters in the show dies and it still plays this intro. XD
This is grotesc I love it
As a nerd for all things art, I am so in love with the watercolor art style they are using now.
That is so cool!!!!
Literally was watching EP 24 yesterday and was thinking to myself wonder if they change the theme like they do in anime and wake up to see they did to some degree
give credit for trying out something and while it does look cool, it feels like this is a step down in production value from the Live Action one.
I feel like now that i've started to use EbSynth i'm seeing it everywhere.  This is much better than what I can do though , truly amazing stuff
Why did you change this after only like 20 episodes? I dont understand, the other intro was cool af and new. Why make a new one?
This is good, but they can't top the animated opening for season two
I like it a lot, but some uncanny valley vibes with their eyes at parts.
I still love the cinema version and for some reason this wonderful piece has brought a deep emotion of love and tears. Weird.
I miss Your Turn to Roll but this animation still goes hard.
Sam flying on the sword like something out of Murim is a weird combination and now I want a Wuxia one-shot from CR
Hah, this just horseshoed from so lame that it's good again!
That line of Matt's at 0:55  O_O
Was really hoping 'Your Turn to Roll" was coming back when they started announcing a new opening title, but this is still cool.
It gives me technicolor take on me vibes lol
I love this! I like it more than the live action! <3
The animation lacks FPS. Probably it needs to be modified by some AI for more FPS
oh my god I love it
this art style is awesome, well done!
Holy crap!! Love it!!!!
a lil chunky but pretty
Rotoscoping... nice!
The transition from Liam to Marisha gives me chills every time. Every time.
not sure i'm liking this one... rhythm between animation and  music seems off at some points
it sux
This is amazing
This intro’s really fun! I love the colors and the attention to detail. That said, I’m really not a fan of rotoscoping. It’s a completely personal thing. I think something about the uncanny valley of it all just makes me feel weird 😂 However, I think the animator did a wonderful job! I always liked the song, too! I’m glad we were able to get an intro that doesn’t step on any toes. I know CR didn’t intend on causing any controversy with the old intro, but many BIPOC fans were bothered by it.
Hey, this is awesome. I’m seeing a lot of comments saying that people are missing the old intro, but I just want to say that this is incredible. The roto must have taken aaages, so fantastic job whoever did that, and all the added touches of the characters to the players was so cool. (Fearne’s horns on Ash was what tipped me off personally). Getting to see all their reactions was a nice little touch, and I really liked seeing Bertrand, Dorian Eshteross in the intro and putting a face to the name Eshteross. (I thought it was Pretty initially, but we’ll move past that). Thanks so much, this is so cool!!
Still doesn’t beat the Your Turn To Roll intro imo. I miss that song…
This new one is Awesome too! I love them both!!!
I am really not digging this one
My heart hurt a little seeing Bertrand and Dorian in the intro! Really love how this gets to incorporate their characters and themes with them.
Great idea! Not sure about the execution though.  Looks to be 3D animation with 2D textured rotoscoped or something, but feel like the shadows on the faces (around the nose/mouth, Ashley at 0:34 for example) are rather unappealing design-choice. Also it leads to some really funny faces, like Taliesin's face melting at the 5th frame (unique picture, individual frames, its the 15th) of the over the shoulder shot that goes into a zoom. And the hair similation (especially on Marisha on around 1:01) also struggles a bit. Love the nods to the characters, as an idea in itself, especially Travis and Taliesin. I totally get why they would switch up the opening, especially considering how so many people seemingly got outrageously offended at the previous into, so making something that is hard pressed to be found offensive by minorities is definitely a safe bet. I think the creative idea behind this opening is great, but the execution of it is rather... mediocre. Its like watching a CGI show from the early 2000s that just started using celshading and physics simluations.
It's cool. I do like the more character centric ones.  This is very good with the main theme....
Oof that fire at the end. That had to take a ton of work and it looks like poo poo.
Was a bit taken back by the art style but I ended up liking it. AWESOME
Yeah, this one is MUCH better than the screaming at the table one!
This is giving me real uncanny valley vibes haha
When you make as much as them you gotta spend it or lose it
The old one was better.
Honestly still like the first opening more. It was done so well and really captured the "adventuring" aspect of the show and the game.  This is also done masterfully for sure, and there's nothing wrong with it. But it doesn't excite me the same way the first opening did.
Outstanding!
Woah!!!
DORIAN!!!
0:47 Holy crap Travis is morbing!
Something has definitly been lost. CR is something different then it was for the first 2. It feels like the story has taken a backseat to the actors. Certain checkboxes need to be ticked. It has to appeal to the corporate side of their branding and buisness. Everything is the brand. Idk, clearly people are still into this new version, but it just doesn't feel like it used to. Idk how it changed so fast, C2 felt like the peak, I guess it's just downhill from there. I guess maybe it just got too big to maintain that real, home made feeling it used to have. Great artistic work on the visuals tho, obviously.
Yo the flaming logo at the end is INSANE
Beautiful intro, but C2 still my fave intro. :)
why did this make me cry?
WOW this looks so goooodd!
THAT WAS AWESOME, I got shivers down my spine!!!! Very well done!!!
Mannn that look awesome!!!
The old intro had more gravitas for me but I love this one references Dorian, Bertrand and the new one (sorry I can't remember her)   Great job!
Absolutely lovely
rly people stop changing everything you do cause your snowflake fans gin up fake reason s to be made at you
Ok... that was pretty damn cool!
Gorgeous
Love the song. Great production and love the different vocal parts
From a critical perspective some of the editing and shot direction in this is very strange. The wide shots at the table you barely see Sam in the frame. It jumps to Sam sliding down a mountain on Orym's sword which is by far the least thematic individual shot to tie a player to their character, nothing about that is FCG as far as I can tell. When it goes to Marisha and she jets the black ink left and right it looks like she's lifting the camera and then suddenly falls which feels disjointed. Some of the jump cuts in this are distracting and the deliberate choice of crystal clear animation together with a reduced frame rate is not when I would have made. Overall could take it or leave it but liked the live-action one more.
I'm a big fan of the first version, it connects to the song more.  This animated version is beautiful, but I think suffers from an emotional disconnect that happens caused by the uncanny valley of rotoscoping.  Looks great! A solid entry, but boy I just really got a kick out of the first version.  I'm sure others will find that this version will hit them in a special way too.
This is up there with the cosplay opening! Love it!
Liam and Marisha look fantastic in this artstyle
I’m still upset Robbie isn’t there
I like how they are leaning more into the people behind the characters this intro. (Not saying I S2 intro won't forever hold a special place in my heart)
I love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dude, that was fuckin beautiful
Another great intro!  Never disappoints!!
Wow!!!!!
This opening reminds me of something; i would give a liver and a half for Laudna and Opal to meet.
Really like the colors, the animation is beautiful and the song was perfection from the start. But I can’t help feeling that it’s just a little too slow. Playing it at 1.5x speed just makes it feel so much more engaging.
Frankly... there is far to much "uncanny valley" going on here for me to enjoy the new animated opening... I prefer the old one, especially because I really liked the slow-mo around the table...
The problem with both C3 intros is the song. It's too slow, so the live-action or animation has to adhere to it, and some awkward scenes that would've just whooshed by with YTTR or a similar song, linger here.
god even the gas tank had a spotlight (i love the new intro so much ㅠㅠ)
I’m gonna be honest I was skeptical about losing that banger of a live action intro but I stand corrected. That animation is fantastic
Fingers crossed we get a character animation with the OG song like campaign two
This was so amazing!!
Gonna be blunt. Hate it. It clearly took a lot of skill, and it’s very technically impressive, but an animated intro should be about the characters, not the players. That’s the whole appeal of an animating a dnd campaign, you get to see the characters moving. Not taking away from anyone that does like it, but… yeah no, this just makes me upset to look at.
Why such unevenness in the time given to each castmember? Most everyone gets between 4 and 6 seconds to be featured with Sam only getting 3, and Laura gets _11_ seconds? Who the hell storyboarded this?
This looks disgusting! no offense, love you guys
mats eyes <3
Holy shit this is so amazing!!!
Okay. That’s pretty dope.
Capturing Travis living out his best life alone is worth a new intro.
Not seeing the old one anymore saddens me. I loved the high definition slow-mo.
This has pure finding Vincent vibes, I love it!
It looks really cool! But the frame rate jumps seem really off putting towards the beginning
Cool rotoscoping
Absolutely incredible, it's amazing
this. is. AWSOOOOOOMEEEEEE!!!!!!!!
Matt is the GOD
The animation is good but I hate this....they even went out of their way to remove robbie, like I get it he's not part of the main cast but he was in the original live action opening....
I hate rotoscoping with a passion, but this is one of the least offensive examples of it I've seen. Not bad. I do wish the cast would've morphed into their characters a little more. That could've been cool.
I think I still prefer campaign 2’s animated into over this and campaign 1 but it’s still really cool
I got the fucking chills, the hero landing of Marisha was immaculate !
Awesome.
NGL, I can't help but imagine nerds from like the 80's seeing stuff like this and being blown away by how fricking cool they make DnD and DnD players look.
So pretty!
Incredible
Nope, don't like it. The animated one for campaign 2 was so much better.
I’m not keen hope it grows on me, but first impression is put it back
Was hoping for more PC animation, I really love those. Maybe a consplay like C1 but with this drawn over animation, that would have been great too.  But this is pretty good.
Looks like someone ran some videos through photoshop filters. Looks terrible but thats just my opinion.
I mean it's better than the previous intro but it does feel a bit self-indulgent. Wish they did something similar to their Mighty Nein into "Your Turn to Roll."
Makes me want to start rewatching and keeping up with the new episodes every week.
Loud minority and click baiters has spoken, let change the intro, let struggle with pronouns, let the bags slips away (wendy), lets get rid of our friends (rip foster). I hate that they have to comply everytime so they can keep going in peace. Anyway, Nice Job on the intro.
Badass! =D
Love the art style. Everyone looks rad and Sounds amazing. Though it feels like a missed opportunity to not show the art of campaign 3’s players and their characters. ❤❤❤❤❤
So wholesome, I had to watch it multiple times
Beautiful!! I adore the colors 🥰 I think Liam’s and marishas were my fav
Dude this is so cool!!
Ok, but why am I crying!? And has anybody saw Sam as Not snowboarding?
Everyone "You can't top the Mighty Nien animated opening."  CR: hold my beer.
I just love every CR opening! I love every transformation especially Liam's/Orym's. How they're all at the same position as their minis at the end. Beautiful!  I just think Marisha could've been scarier.
The is f-ing awesome. GG
I could care less about the new animation, I'm just here for the epic song mixing. 🤤
Rotoscope is cool, that probably took a while and the result is very artistic.. personally, I really miss seeing the characters in action though, we see the people behind the characters all the time. Campaign 2s intro really set a bar that hasnt been matched yet when it comes to giving the audience a clear and concise look at the movement, mannerisms and emotional competence of these characters that only truly live in the minds of the cast. The main visual we have for them is the info cards that occasionally pop in the bottom left of the stream.   What i mean is.. for example, Jesters scene in the intro "your turn to role".. as soon as she flys open that door, with that hopeful, willful, blissfully ignorant face, you just get a grasp of that characters soul, you can already tell how big her heart is and how damn silly she was. Bo catching her hat with that stern but stoic expression.. knott when she hides.. I mean, there is just soo freaking much detail to the characters.   When that intro started airing.. it changed CR to me.. I stopped seeing them as just voice actors who play dress up... I started to really see these characters. I had the head cannon to visualize the reactions, the way the walk.. down to the simplest things like the gate of their step.   I soo desperately want to see Chetney (travis's characters always blow me out of the water) in action.. how he walks, smiles, how he moves.. FCG, I want to see the mechanisms, the way his wheels turn, how his mouth moves. Laudna and Fearne.. my god, again, really freaking cool characters. I have this image of Laudna, rackety, petite but with an almost floaty elegance to her step... no idea if that is anywhere even close to Marishas vision lol.  I know it is insanely selfish of me to say that that is all I want because these characters arent very fleshed out in the world yet, not enough experience for an artist to be able to portray them correctly (aside from travis, he probably knows every single aspect of Chet). I just want it soo badly because until that moment, my mind is just guessing in a hopeful arrogance.  All that aside, like I said, this roto is done very well and is insanely stylistic, it really is quite a visual experience.
nice, now make it 60 FPS for that creamy smooth look and it's gonna be perfect!
WOW JUST WOW
wow. I really hate it.   Hopefully this grows on me, otherwhise I'm not ever gonna hear the intro again.  Definetly prefer the live-action intro we had for C3 prior to the Calamity-break
I love these humans so much.
It kinda gives me motionsickness weird AF
Still miss the Your Turn to Roll theme but the animation here is amazing
Not a fan. Taliesin & Travis had the best moments but otherwise this was quite lackluster. Quite possibly the intro i like the least since I began watching CR
1:37 Oh, that look....*swoon*
That's incredible, the animation is stellar! So smooth and stylish. Great job!
this is so cool!! the rotoscoping looks so sick, and i love the reduced framerate! and the effects are STUNNING, i am in awe. the flames of the logo are animated now!!
Love the art style, rotoscoping, color, and how personalized this one is. Can’t imagine the work rotoscoping all that took lol, and the shot of Matt at the end is great.   Just idk if “Its Thursday Night” syncs well or fits the tone. Something like TLOVM’s might sync better.
OHHHH this is sick >:D
The rotoscoping is what sells it for me. I like it.
Its good but the framerate is a lil wack
I love that the tattoos are present and accounted for. Meaningful tatts have meaning.
They didn't change the song? :/
Not my favorite opening.  I like seeing the characters more than the actors...They have minor transformations, but I think it would have been cooler to do a full transformation into character rather than just the minor things they showed.
Just make all the openings for each episode all random, because they all deserve the love ❤️⚔️🧝‍♀️
This is incredibly dope! Definitely my favorite opening
It's cool, but the previous one was way better. Frankly speaking, the original intro for Campaign 3 was the best intro out of all of them in my opinion.
They should have Tara Strong and Dee Bradley Baker join them in their campaigns. Even have them voice in the next season of _The Legend of Vox Machina._
Taliesin and Matt looking extra eldritch
It's nice BUT I think the opening for the second season was the Best. Nevertheless I'm just Happy they're having fun 😊
Yesssss
I LOVE THIS! 🤯🤯🤯
I love how in this Liam sends his leaves on to Marisha and we see a glimps of Kiki and then move on to Laudna ! so amazing!!
I like how they added flair of each person's character to the intro. Travis having a bit of a werewolf transformation, Marisha having the black dripping from her fingertips, Taliesin swinging his character's hammer. Nice touches that hint at the characters they are playing.
For me this is a step up from the original campaign 3 opening but that's just my personal tastes, nothing against thus great group of ppl
I'm sorry I'm not a fan i know a little about how this type of art made but it remind me of the old photo booths that turn real life pic to this  but i do have a thought that maybe could help small artist  why don't you offer tickets for small animators so they do do an opening and help them get there art recognize and maybe do a buy a ticket and spend a wheel to see witch artist win one ticker per artist for a month or something like that could possibly do year in advance? i been working ideas for alot of things this what came to me critical role you may use this if it intresting
Omg I'm speechless. I love CritRole so much!
I love the 80s animation vibes this intro gives! I love pretty much all the intros for different reasons. And also nice references to each character 😊
I didn't this it was possible fo Ashley Johnson to look more breathtaking... But, here we are.
minnow mountain did an amazing job this is beautiful
not even close to s2
Not what i was wanting out of the animated intro but its alright I guess
I legit cried a bit during the Keyleth cameo 😭😭😭😭  It was perfect
cringical hit , natural 20
Simply awesome!
Very cool and increasingly interesting productions. The values of production are growing here. Good stuff.
Gotta say...not the biggest fan🙈 I still love the song and I can definetely appreciate the work that went into the animation but for me its a little much (my brain also doesn't work like it should so maybe thats why) ... Too many flashing colors, too much movement. Might also be that I'm biased bc I REALLY loved the other intro. Guess I'll just listen to the song with my eyes closed then.
Oh, I really love this!
Dope as F**k.
I like the live action better. It had a more adventurous feel. This is beautiful, though.
I love this! Why? Because it's a call-back to the original C1 intro that had Matt with a book open -- until he closed it.  Well done, Critical Role! Only question I have is, when will we see a live show and hear the crowd singing the intro song?
Thats one sick animation
Is it wrong I want a version of this but it's made by Joel Haver??
Kinda gave me motion sickness but it looks awesome as hell
I'm not big fan of this intro - I don't feel like it sets the mood for the table as well as other past intros, but I also don't watch CR just for the intro so it's fine that it's not up my ally. Just like it's fine if it's not up yours. It doesn't take away from the show itself, even a bit.
paint me like one of your french rogues
That's rather excellent.
Wonderful 💋
I like what they did and it is a great job, but I do enjoy the orginal Campaign 3 intro more. Still great job guys.
Love it
I don't know about this one, previous intro and C2 intro were so much better than this. It feels like some early 2000's nickelodeon intro for a kids show xD. Hope they go back to animation or live action in the future!
I love everyone's intros throughout this but man there's just something fun about the big character moments before they transition into the next cast member, Liam's might be my favorite.
I like this one better than the last. It is so colorful 😊🧡🧡🧡
This is awesome!
Heavy Take Me On vibes
Chills! Great intro!
the parts with white background remind me a lot of the 100th episode david mack poster!
I'll miss the first S3 intro but this one is pretty cool. :)
Dope
It looks really cool and bright and colourful and all, but sadly it gives me major motion sickness. Prefered the old intro
Hm, I like it, though I think I liked the real life one more, it reminded me of the first ones you made.
ACTUAL goosebumps
Omg
Sorry but the old one is better. The faces look uncanny, especially for people who know how this was done. Good work though, just... uncertain who asked for it?
awesome
Can ya'll be any more awesome? Just when I thought you have maxed out, ya'll pull this magic rabbit out.
amazing intro but i cant get over how it feels like it was made in vr chat lmao
There's just something about this new opening that really draws you in. I also liked that they captured the facial expressions of each character. The first version was chaotic and magical, but this one rocks!
The artistry of this is just beautiful, but I have to admit that I really loved the previous one, where all y'all were frolicking around on set & it looked like you were having the time of your lives.
The shot of Matt at the end produced such a visceral reaction in me that I'm in literal tears.
*screams*
Gbh this is giving me motion sickness, appreciate the effort, but the old one is better
That was rather hot.  It's really warm in here!
Very well done! I like the art style a lot and love that they put thier PC physical traits on themselves. - Hector
I hope this wasn't changed because of the manufactured controversy over the old one. Not that it's a bad change. I think this one is actually a LOT of fun and I think I like it better than the old one. Though neither was as fun as Your Turn to Roll. Combined with the animated intro, that was just lightning in a (potion) bottle.
I like it, but I have to admit I think I still prefer the old one more o= this one doesn't really feel synced with the music at all like the previous slomo one was and that kinda trips my brain out o=
I appreciate how each opening is like a completely different style and vibe from the previous ones.
Eh,,, Now Art critters; make it better
I ADORE IT SO FREAKING MUCH YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS GO OFF ANIMATORS
I still like the live action one better, but it's not bad to mix things up. Honestly, I wish they'd rotate all of them.
Im calling it now, someone is totally going to take this footage and overlay "Take On Me".
I kinda prefer the old one, but I can appreciate the work put into it. ... Plus, Travis' bit is just ( _chef kiss_ )
Only art styles i can think of they havent done is pure cgi(think transformers), clay mation lol, and a 3D render akin to something like shrek, also an anime intro om thinking like dragon ball Z
Some Scanner Darkly vibes. I love it.
This is sick as fuck, and I'm not even 100% feeling season 3 - would love to have been a fly on the wall on its creation. Hats off
First, this is a banger, second, the animation on this is incredible. Absolutely love it, congrats to everyone involved for pulling off something like this !
Literal. Freaking. Chills.
Apparently some people either a) are professional complainers or b) don't really know what they want
I fucking hate Autotune with the white hot passion of a thousand suns.  If I wanted to hear computer-generated music, I'd watch a Floppotron video.  But this is far worse than computer-generated, it's the voices of real, living, breathing people being roboticized, any nuance or soul in their performances completely crushed and homogenized into synthetic pap so that no matter who is singing or how they're singing, it all sounds exactly the fucking same.  That's not why I hate Autotune, though.  I hate it because it has been so completely done to fucking death.  It is a dead horse that's been beaten to a pulp, run over with a steamroller, scraped off the pavement, freeze-dried and put in a Ziploc bag with some silica gel packets, left in a mummy's tomb for 5 thousand years, dug up, sprinkled on a bed of rock salt, and then beaten some more.  I am convinced that Autotune is a secret military experiment to see just how much goddamn puppyfucking Autotune can be shoved down the public's collective throat until we as a nation puke blood.  Other than that, this is pretty good.  For, y'know, 90% computer-rotoscoped animation.
I liked the live action one better but this is ok. EDIT Just found out why it was changed and have to wonder why they keep giving in to such a vocal minority of the fan base all the time. The people who complain about the old intro are the same ones who got real violent when Mollymauk died. So instead of those people just muting the intro and letting other people enjoy something now we all have to suffer with this new intro.
I prefer the live action.
AMAZING
The song doesnt fit.
Like every campaign esp. animation intro, this one is so unique. It brings out 'them' in portraying their characters. It hard to rate this cause you just can't put it somewhere. I did honestly liked campaign 2 animation but this is on another level and by its own flare.
Is this gonna be a new thing, like every new chapter there is going to be a new intros sequence? And I know Robbie has his own title card for the first chapter, does that mean he’s going to be a longer cast member than any of the other guest cast members?
THIS IS SO COOL!!! FANTASTIC WORK!
I definitely prefer the C2 intro to this but, it isn't bad by any means. Hopefully as C3 progresses they'll do something similar.
I. LOVE. THIS. This song always makes me tear up and idek why! Everything about this is amazing! I can’t wait to watch it again every week!
Hrm.  Prefer the other one.  Nothing tops that animated Campaign 2 opening, though.
Literal tears of joy.
People should be careful with the comments about this or anything really. The critter community can be oh shall I say sensitive about peoples harsh comments towards critical role.
I love CR with all my heart but this theme doesn't hype me for the action, if anything this one  is the "outro", not "intro". And although the visual is beautifull i feel like i've seen players enough on the show itself and have a burning desire to see characters brought to life instead. *Respectfully* (in a voice of pumat) i doubt this song would have same energy in a live show as  "your turn to roll" had.
Not very catchy or memorable like campaign 2 sadly
Better.
It’s like the “Take On Me” music video for the world’s greatest nerds
The new one was okay but prefer the one they made it fit the song better.
I like this better than the og opening. That one just reminded me of Call of Cthulhu.
So fun to share this with the world after everyone's hard work! Thank you Critical Role!
That was so cool!!!! I love it!!!!!
Still like Your Turn To Roll more tbh
Woaw
Nope. Should be animated with your characters like c2 was. That was the best
Roto-scope. The best kind of animation.
This new animated intro looks sick!
First campaign 3 op : wow that looks good they’ve came a long way production wise cool stuff   New into : HOLLY SHIT THATS A BOP!
rotoscoping is always so impressive to me!! I loved the colours and how everything flowed!! it looks absolutely amazing!!
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHH THIS IS AWESOME!
when the tab of lucy kicks in while your playing dnd with the homies.
I am a big fan of CR and I love all previous intros, but to be honest this one is terrible :(
Awesome. I don't know if anything can beat Campaign 2's intro, or how blown away I was when I first saw it. But definitely fun, and all the little character touches, especially Travis/Chetney were great.
god this reminds me of their big campaign 1 intro with the in-character cosplay. and the way that each player into mirrors more than 1 of their characters?? good shit. I'd lose it if we get full cosplay again for Bell's Hells
I confess, I liked the live action one better but, this is still pretty darned good!
I miss the animated C2 intro with the in-game characters featured. I think that's what we all want to see!
This was amazing! The art style and animation quality is epic!
I LOVE TARVIS’D MOMENT!
Not really feeling the new intro. Animation is kinda rough to look at. The song is still a banger though.
This is so awesome! Gave me goosebumps! I love every intro though. You guys are awesome!
this is beautiful!!!!!
The start hurt my eyes but overall this is awesome! :D Especially Taliesins bit
OMG I LOVE THIS INTRO!! glad they updated it, this animated style is BEAUTIFUL
I LOVE it. Animated intros just feel right for the show at this point, and this still manages to be completely separate in style and feel from campaign 2 intro, instead of just being "let's just do the campaign 2 intro again but switch the characters".  Also why is everyone so insanely hot as cartoons
Weird cuts, not a fan of that aspect, rest is cool.
AWESOME!
It's a nice video but I kinda hope this isn't the final opening they use for Campaign 3 and they still have something else in the works.
Much prefer the old one.
Marisha standing and jumping off a chair. Classic.
Dude that was awesome!
I like how Sam is just snowboarding on a sword
Ok that was f**kin sweet
Behold,  Marisha gained a +2 to her badassery
Unfortunately this campaign's theme didn't really get me so as long as the theme song stays I'll propably skip the intros. Not bad visuals tough,pretty artistic.
Way better than the last one! good job.
It's a very nice intro, but I am still hoping for an animated one like campaign 2. I assume it will happen once everyone has some more concrete character hooks to include in an animation
I like it I just don’t know if I like get better than the first one
This is cool and all, but I like seeing the actual characters like the C2 opening. When I see the players it’s harder for myself to get into it more. When I see the characters I’m able to put myself in the world easier.
Otherwise it's great but the frame rate is bit too laggy for my taste
Oooo! I love it! The old one was good too! But this one I can tell took a lot of work and the art work is perfect!! Great job!!
D&D beyond 80's action cartoon is still the best, but this is fantastic too! Always great stuff coming from the CR studio.
You didn't have to make Talisan such a badass!! I love this so much
BROOO! So good! There needs to be an intrumental version of this with violins for the vocals so it can be played during the big battles like in anime, that would be amazing.
Look what Critical Role has become. Anyone else feeling like a proud parent right now?
I love this so much.
I'm straight as an immovable rod, but everytime I see one of these new intros I feel closer to the rainbow for a bit. I didn't knew I needed Liam with a sword.
Its not my favourite opening. Much prefer the old one but the song is still a banger.
I thought cool new song and new intro the cringe is gonna go away... well I waw certainly very wrong :(
Ok, haven’t seen the episode yet.. but gotta say I love the knee intro. Fits critical role more than the other one they started the season with.. makes me wonder if this was the one they wanted originally and it took to long to get ready so they started with plan B
So cool that Sam is flying on his husband’s sword
I love show and old intros, but this one give me a lot of uncanny valley feelings. Not the best one, the previous was much better in my opinion :'(
yO... freaking... dopamine
I like the live action one more, but this is still really cool!!!
I guess I'm the only one who doesn't like this. The frames are so rough it looks like a cutscene from a PC game running on Windows 95. Compared to the animated C2 intro, this looks amateurish.
This is PHENOMENAL
OMG I LOVE THIS. THE COLORS, AHHHH
well this is better than the colonial one your sensitivity consultants somehow let through
Once again… NAILED IT!!!!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
They switched cause they got backlash that their intro was oppressive and referencing colonialism. Meh snowflakes everywhere.
Yup, sorry, the old one was miles better.
Apparently some of you never realized how incredibly problematic the old intro was. I am glad they re did it. I’m hoping they realized the mistakes they made and don’t make them again, but who knows..
WHAT
I need more Galaxy Matt.
No because I'm always this 👌🏼 close to sobbing when I hear Taliesin sing
Why does this look like dog shit???
This is so dope. Also, Laura and her dice lol
love the song! not sure how I feel about the actual animation, but it'll grow on me!! I know how long rotoscoping takes haha. keep up the good work <33
As much as I'm sad to see the original one disappear, I love this one.
I don't know...
Didn't the other animated openings have the characters in them? That was what I was hoping for . . .
The animation is amazing!
I just want to go into the past and show this to the bunch of insecure nerds hesitantly shooting bad sound quality livestreams from the G&S studios and see what they think.
Ik the put so much work on it and it might be me butt hurt but anime OP like CR2 pls that’s all I want
Beautiful art!
What an Intro!!! You are amazing 😍😍
Shivers all over! Awesome art style!
Why is Sam the only one without something from his character....? Can't wait to find out what he really is.
Reminds me of a Scanner Darkly!
I think I've had mushroom trips less crazy than this intro
This is definitely the roughest of the openings, but artistic rotoscoping is WAY outside what CR has done before. It’s very splashy and feels like a bunch of watercolor paintings come to life!
Not going to lie. I honestly like the live action intro better.
I'm still kinda waiting for the your turn to roll opening
I dunno about anyone else but Travis in transformation just...Sends me.
Very good, actually, very good!
I like it, I hope they didn't do this just because people complained about the costumes in the first one.
I prefer the other one
For sure lovely … tons of color and energy, sorry you felt the need to change it from what you had which was a lot of fun and I’m quite sure cost a fair few bob to film.
God everything here is beautiful and great and I adore it!! "I miss Dorian gang" come here cause I cried upon him being there
I love this intro so much better.
Dope
Can’t wait
Don’t love it I like the other one better but Liam looks very handsome so I can’t hate it. Fav intro still campaign 2 animated one
A little sad that it's not the characters themselves in action
This intro is fucking creepy. The way people's mouths move with this half-animation half-live action style is just off putting. I like it better than the last one, but Campaign 2 is still best intro by a fucking mile.
Pretty cool. It's a toss up for me which I like better. The first one seemed like everyone was having so much fun making it.
Don't get me wrong the old intro was good, but this one is on another level.
oh my god definitely not skipping this intro every episode. rotoscoping these must’ve taken ages to complete but it was worth it.
Looks very nice. I would watch a series with these characters.
I love this art style. Awesome job.
Sam snow boarding, so he can write off his ski vacation again? XD
Omg it's amazing  You guys Give me so much wanted to played DnD  With my friends we start our campaign this summers  Actually I'm kinda scared because I never do that before And I'm the Dungeon Master
This is cool. I prefer the first season 3 intro, but it’s still cool.
As awesome as this is, i still think the first one was just a little better 🤏
I really enjoyed this one
This song isn't hitting the same as it did with the old opening. I still like the song.
This is fine, but I kind of prefer the old one. Not a fan of this animation style. Still, though, clearly a lot of talent and effort went into this, it looks great, it's just not my cup of tea.
You guys look awesome in medieval times
LOOOOOOOVE THIS OPENING <3 <3 <3
I think this was one of the most interesting intros yet
YEAHHH
I'm usually not a big fan of roto-scoping, but this was pretty fun.
I love how it's you guys and not your characters
Reigel's GAS TANK! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤌❤️
Usually not a fan of roto scope but it works well here
It's not that it is bad, but.. i really like the old intro SO MUCH MORE !!
Why did they change it again ?
It's a lot better than the live action version, amazing work!!
I will miss not seeing real pure chaos at the table, but the colors in this are unbeatable
I love the artstyle! Like a blend of 3D and 2D
Alright it's well done animation, I just don't like it. Honestly I still prefer the the old C3 one
It looks amazing I love it!!!!!
Very cute. I love the art style great job guys, can't wait to see what's to come
This is amazing!!!!!
Great now my eyes are crying tears of blood from how epic this is
Beautiful
This is amazing 😻
Personally for now I like the old one better but this will definitely grow on me I mean it already has so it definitely will even more
Not gonna lie, this is pretty lit!
You guys are so awesome, you are what made me become a DM ❤️❤️❤️
The artstyle is gonna take some getting used to
Another beautiful intro, great job
still not a fan of the song but this intro really makes it better.
What amazing art! Very charming intro. I think it really fits with the campagin
Had the biggest grin on my face from beginning to end. So good *chef’s kiss*
I freaking LOVE this new animated intro! No wonder they took a month off for the animators to create this! Special thanks to Minnow Mountain for making this incredible intro possible!
Sooooo cooool!!!
i still miss the campaign 2 intro (it was just soo well animated) but this is pretty fun!
It’s good, just not campaign 2 good
Holy hell that's amazing
love this art style animation
Bertrand, Dorian, Eshteross and Dusk at the end 🥹🥹🥹
Love it!
Love it
Ngl I thought the song and intro they filmed were hella cringe but this is SO GOOD! Critical Role, I’m sorry I doubted you.
Stop giving me chills!!!!! And by stop I mean keep it up Jesus love this for sure
The rotoscope work is immaculate. Well done! Lol
This looks so fucking cool
Rotoscoooooooope!
i love that they all look way older than they actually are with this xD - cant get Taliesin  out of my head
Matt be lookin extra handsome in this whew 😍
Love the watercolor palette
I'm.... clearly not found of it
holy shit this is amazing
This art style looks familiar, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Though I will say, not my favourite art style its actually very well done.
Very pretty!
Song still not as catchy as  s2
Shivers just shivers
That's pretty dope, looking forward to flando time stamping this.
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCKING HYPE IS THIS!!!!!!!!
Dont get me wrong this is awsome but i still think C2 has the best intro
Not really my thing, the previous one was better.
Beautifully done animation, and that rotoscoping was very impressive.
A visual masterpiece ✨️
I. FREAKING. LOVE. IT.
Very A Scanner Darkly, love it.
Damn
Much better
I legit cried the first time watching this live 😭💕
New art style, new story. Same incredible people.
Never a miss. Love it 🤘🏼
They really should have spent the money on paying Sam to do another song as epic as “Your Turn to Roll.” I know they put a lot of effort into it but this intro isn’t even in the same category. That intro gets you pumped as hell, this one is like eh time for bed
never been this early i cant wait to watch the vid (:
HOLY CRAP IT AMAZING
This intro is just everything!!! 🔥
The art reminds me of Reading Rainbow.  🌈
This is like Take On Me by A-ha made for nerds and I love it.  (p.s. thanks for including Dorian, Bertrand, Eshteross and Dusk in it. It's very sweet)
Odd...why they'd change the intro????
This intro is just everything!!! 🔥
The colors are great but the rest is... Meh. Uncanny valley... All that
Wow
Love the new intro
Looks great!
Chills-
IT LOOKS SO DAMN GOOD!!! CONGRATULATIONS ON SETTING THE BAR EVEN HIGHER 🎊🎉🎊🎉
it’s interesting:)
This is so awesome, I love this community and this opening
Ooo, That gave me tingles!!!
seizure warning to all!   very cool though
Yooooo let’s gooooooo
Damn, this is Pentatonix... with music
Got chills and teared up watching this last night. It’s perfect 💖
I'm gonna miss seeing the *incredible* slo-mo sections of the old intro, but this is fun too!
first
Oo pretty colors
Beautiful 😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 love the song of the Acapella style very beautiful
🤩 so colorful, love it
Oh neat
Holy shit this looks amazing
