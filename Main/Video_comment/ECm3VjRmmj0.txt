Mark says he makes these songs for the Trussel Trust, but he really keeps on making them because he knows we love em
When it comes to hacking, KLAXONSTOOLS COM are the best. They just got me over $5,000 from their service. I'm grateful

I prefer ladbabys song winning and helping lots of people then any other artists songs tbh
Ladybaby for pm

You got my crying as well I got my pre odder and can’t wait to hear the song and you doing a great job for a fantastic cause keep it up xx
come on guys let’s show the mainstream we aren’t messing about !!
You are and your wife are model examples of what people. Should do and can do - see a problem help fix the problem. You’re both genuine and keep it real. Best of luck I. Striving for a third number one. Merry Christmas from the USA.
Just pre-ordered mine in the US! Definitely a great cause.
You guys are the best!!🥰
Might be a stupid question but do YouTube views and plays on Spotify count towards the chart? Cause I will have it in repeat! 🤗
Amazing keep it up guys!
You guys make me smile whilst supporting such a worthy cause
Love this guy but he makes me cry when he does, such a heart of gold LADBABY to break history again for 3 number ones!!!!

Bought..... well done, looking forward to hearing it. Our very best wishes and all the luck in the world for another No 1 😍👍
Pre ordered. Thank you for what you do x
Just pre ordered really enjoy your videos
I think what we need to learn from this is that Christmas number one in the uk should always go to charity..... it’s only right. Think of all those people just doing it line there pockets it’s just wrong. So thank you ladbaby for taking that away from people and giving it to the actual people that need it.
You both are amazing xx
I've ordered it already, three number ones in a row...yes mate. Luv you guys xx
Ordered!! Keep it all coming!!
You've both done so well raising money, well done guys love you #yesmate xx
I so do hope Ladbaby makes 3 in a roll. Good luck guys
Bro....never in my life had I thought a marriage like y'all's existed.....what y'all do for everyone day in and day out is speechless....I'm just glad I can be a part of it and watch it....your wife's laugh is the best by the way and you are the biggest sport about everything.....people need to sit back and watch y'all even if it's just for a day....keep doing what y'all doing it's working
Kudos Mark 🇦🇺❤️🇦🇺❤️👍👍👍🥰🥰🥰🎄🎄🎄🎄
I’m legit sobbing...
I'm from California, and have pre-ordered!!! I never miss a video cuz you guys are the best family EVER! 💜♥️💜♥️ Good luck on year three of Christmas number one!!!!

It's the magic of Christmas! To celebrate this time of year, I propose a video clip to listen to on headphones 🎧 (music in 8d audio). Good listening and good clip ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqc8BP1MyLY
You and Rox are amazing fricken people Thank You for caring so much about families that can't afford food.

i work at the YMCA in Nottingham in town centre, and so we see everyday the struggle that people go through and the kindness our city can bring when we come together...this Christmas is going to be especially difficult, so i think anything Mark can bring to people in need is amazing

Pre-ordered good luck guys 👍👍👍
Pre-ordered. ❤️ From Michigan USA.
I can't pre order it wont let me it says not available 😔 😕. Strange don't understand why. Gutted.
I've been sitting crying with goosepimples all over. I sooooooo hope you are Christmas number 1 again. Wishing you massive good luck xx
yes matee! - its just what we need after such a pants year. just pre-ordered.
I read the interview where you talked about what a hard time you both had after Phoenix was born.  We actually depend on a food bank now here in our state. If I can, I will definitely buy your song, because, it doesn't matter what country anyone is in, we all need help. If I can help in anyway,  I will.
Callux?
I smell sausage rolls... it has begun
One last time (2020) Christmas (2021) approaches, last time ;) bring on 2022, 4th N.1 !

I just pre ordered the song. I’ve purchased it every year so far! It’s amazing what you’ve achieved and this is from a vegan who hates sausage rolls lol xx
Love you guys and I’m greatfull for the cause . But do it another time of year please . You don’t have to do it at Christmas to get same results. I miss proper Christmas songs lol . In ten years all were here is your songs for number ones . Can’t see that being a good Christmas album . But thanks for all yous have done . Much love to all . And your boys are pucker . Shows your great parents x
This is my fav YouTube chanel. 😍🥖
Let's all get lad baby a 3rd number 1 in a row peeps by getting their new song
You have to bring out an album next year of silly songs because we love them
You have to make history because your the best #yesmate
What you both do for charity is amazing you help out so many people with just being yous ..we need more people like you both..😊
Pre ordered! You have to have it in the Greg's sausage roll bag, right??
Pre ordered. So much love to you guys.
order confirmed :)
He is such a lovely person im emotional
Absolutely!! Get in! Xx
Blimey you have strong competition from the nhs this year, anyway you are all winners
This isn't a competition between Marcus rashford and ladbaby (and I feel that if they knew people were talking like this, they'd be heartbroken), it for a great cause. And even though I think both the previous songs are crap, and an insult to music, I have purchased both songs and will be buying this one too. Let's just put food in people's bellies ay guys
Just pre ordered on iTunes.
Eh? https://youtu.be/aU5LDAzZ0R0
2020 = Driving home for sausage rolls 👍
Just give me a call iv got a whole 15 album waiting for you my lil sausage roll x
I pre ordered it guys. Can’t wait to hear it. Happy to help for a good cause 😊😊
I hope the 3 year goes well mark & roxy like the other 2 good years that u had, the music is so good
YES MATE!!!!
The most wholesome family channel on YouTube, they deserve a lot more creditxxx
You are the most inspirational man Mark. I love your little family. I really hope your record gets to No 1 - I'm off to Amazon right now! Happy Christmas to you all.
If only world leaders and the governments acting like this man and had half his work ethic and morals this world would be a better place
hahaha
There's a family doing a covid song trying for number one too
Pre ordered 🤞
Praying you make it to number 1 again this year. 🙏🙏🙏
Yes ladbaby come on let's get ladbaby back at number 1 this year
I can't find the song to pre order, on amazon. Only the first two! Is this me being an idiot?
♡♡ come onnnnnn!
We don’t want you number one again it’s not proper music
Yas matee ..we'll be backing you all bro xxxx
Good luck guys love ur work so so much from the Orchard family in New Zealand
♥️🥺🎶♥️🥺💪🏼🔥🫔🏆
Pre-ordered 👌  can't wait for the song and helping everyone in need.... and good luck with #1.... for the 3RD TIME 🙏
They won't get it this time. Seriously I think Mariah Carey will keep them off. I think they will only stall at number three  above Lil Nas X and Mariah Carey. That's my prediction for this years number one. Nice try LadBaby, but this Christmas number one won't be yours, even your children behind your back even think you not getting the Christmas number one. Just remove the song, you won't earn another number one hit, people don't know who you are.
Let's win this, Best couple on utube 💯👌👌love your beautiful heart's 💜💜
Just a thought can we try raise even more money and really stick it to the music industry! Why don’t we all get behind ladbaby and get all 3 songs to the top of the charts ! Let’s have Christmas number 1,2 and 3. Re release the old songs too and let’s smash this.
Thats not what Christmas music is about! Love listening to Christmas songs and on every radio station ive been listening to this year thankfully none have played that song. What does that tell you?
Just pre ordered can’t wait
Hat-Trick!!!!!!!!
i hope you do it every year pal......raising money for other people is what Christmas should be about, and not the celebrities for fame and prestige!!..........keep going, even if it means farting on a sausage roll and looping the sound effect.....ill buy it!!......merry Christmas!!
You are an awesome person for what you are doing for people, yes maaaaaaaate 👍👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤❤ merry Christmas to you and your beautiful family 🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎁🎁🎁🎁
Good luck guys you can do it 👍👍👍🎄
im in bring it on ladbaby
Lad baby Xmas song is a tradition now keep going it’s a awesome charity xx
That was a great moment!
Awe Mark, I love you Man! You are such an amazing person!! I really, really, hope you win again!!
I am in Canada and trying to preorder and having trouble, does anyone have any tips or know how to do it?
Man, when I seen Mark start crying you can really tell how happy they was because I don’t think I’ve EVER seen him cry until now!!!🥺🥺 You guys deserve. Y’all are AMAZING & such caring people!!!!! Love you guys❤️❤️❤️
Damn now I want a sausage roll 🤣😂
Oh god this idiots back.think I’ll buy Mariah Carey 100 times and put it on Spotify loop just to try and keep him off another undeserved number 1
Can’t wait to hear it!
Do you know what i think you should do for the christmas song maybe next year as will have time piecing it altogether and yes i know it has been done a few times, but i think this may work and be a good idea and sell. What about getting people from the food banks make some videos of sending out food with the people they help and pull together with a warming video of FEED THE WORLD. I reckon with a little work on the music and videos put together it would work and well it is not like feed the world song don't fit in because i think tht is a perfect song to re-do due to what you are doing. What do you think guys?
Wow 🤩 three number ones !!! Let’s go  Don’t stop me Eatin  Let’s spread the Love  Amazing sending lots of Love  out to everyone 💕  What a Beautiful family for all you do 💓💝 Merry Christmas  to all🎄
Best family ever lets get this family to number one they deserve it come on fans help them out let's do this
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
New if anyone would like to watch or support :) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zpaxJnvvWcs
As an American... UK number one doesn’t mean much to me... but I buy the song every year. Pre-order complete!! As I go to find the tissues because this makes me cry EVERY YEAR. This is the best thing the internet has ever been used for.
Ngl mate moving into my new flat tomorrow and got to go to a food bank and thats some what thanks to u ! Thank u Mark and Rox so much love ❤💙

Up the lads !!
The world needs more people like you and Rox. Humanitarians through and through. I’m from Canada and I have gladly pre-ordered your song. Hope you make it to number 1 again this year!!!
If this gets Christmas number one again it will be in a group with The Beatles (1963/64/65) and the Spice Girls (1996/97/98) to have secured the Xmas number one 3 years in a row
Lad baby number 11111111!!!!!

Come on ladbaby 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👊👊🥰🥰👊😘😘😘😘
Just preordered my copy , thank you for thinking of others , you had me in tears 😭 , bless you and your wonderful family for never failing to make me smile 🙏
Such a great caring couple 👌 I felt the emotion in you over what you understand and know is the reality for so many, I've lost any chance of earning any money for nearly a full year , my reward is to see my kids disappointed faces on Xmas morning through no fault of my own , and the food bank something I felt I would never need to use and something I've always helped is now feeding my children, talk about feeling low isn't the word but I hold faith something will happen, and I thank people like you ❤️
It should be : Its a long way to the shop if you wanna sausage roll .. 🤣❤️
I can't stop buying the sausage roll crisps yes mate x
Preorder done! You guys are amazing! You two have helped so many people. Happy holidays.

Absolutely want you to do it 3 in a row...I think Robbie Williams “Can’t Stop Christmas”…is your biggest challenge this year...pre ordered yours...all the very best.
I went back and listened to both of your songs. I must say...I would really love to eat a sausage roll. American, and I've never had one. Can someone send some my way? Lol I look forward to listening to your new song!
Wow, this made me so emotional... but a happy emotional.....  I know this year has sucked for so many... me included. I had a dose of Covid, took weeks to get over. I havent been in my office since March and I live alone. My mental health has really taken a bash.... but all year small bursts of positivity come along and keep me moving forward. This news has put a big smile on my face and tears in my eyes.... I so hope you make it 3 out of 3... and your spot on... the fun element more than ever is so important.....good luck to you both... by the way I love that Queenesque cover to the song... thats brilliant.....
You and Rox can smash this again!!!! Come on!!!!!!
I'm a Muslim and I love this

Pre Ordered :)
LADBABY FOR NUMBER 1
Just preordered it, let's make it a hatrick. You guys at ladbaby are awsome. And the sausage roll crisps are amazing.
not only in uk you give people a smile. throughout the european union you make people happy despite a brexit! please keep going and i hope for your 3rd number 1!
Omg I’m crying 😢 you are the most selfless family I ever have known! Go on ladbaby! I’m so happy for you guys! X
Thank god it isn't this year
Did a buy straight away to help you guys is a small reward for all the entertainment you give me the whole year and its for a great cause love you guys so much and have a great Christmas
Well even if it doesn't get to number one, it's definitely worth buying as the Trussell Trust will need funds more than ever this year.  And if you live near to one and have the funds to, get in touch and find out what they  specifically need,  every tin of soup, bottle of cleaner, tube of toothpaste even will be gladly received.
I really hope you guys get the hat trick. You really deserve it unlike the others artists in the charts. Where does their money go? Their pockets buying stupid cars and holidays making an ass of themselves.
Pre ordered 😃👍
Go on you absolute leg' of a family! You've made such a difference to so many lives. From a 5 minute laugh to break up the madness to a meal for a person in need. Absolutely smashing it, what an extraordinary example to set. Your kids will look back on all these memories with complete admiration. I will be downloading and cannot wait for the live stream! Xx
Just ordered "Don't Stop Me eating" from across the pond. Merry Christmas to your family from mine. Let's make this single a #1 for the 3rd year in a row! Semper Fidelis, Sergeant Wesley Bennett USMC.

Tears 😭 & I’m American (USA). I think 🤔, it’s b/c we’ve had to get so many food boxes 📦 this year. It’s been so hard. I’ve been laid-off 3 times after, a lack of work from the event company since, March(which was my normal job). Love 💗 Juls!

Pre ordered yessss mate .mmmmmwaa love you two ❤️💋
Cool 😎 ladbaby
You are amazing, keep it up!
YAA YAA YES YES YES!!! LETS GO
Not sure if it will help getting it to number one being from the U.S., but wanted to help with the food bank.
Let's get this to number 1
I remember when I was younger and my mum would struggle and need to go to a food bank. I would always be embarrassed when going but as I grow older I now realise it’s not something to be embarrassed about because not everyone has all the money in the world. I now own my own business and make good money so my mum no longer struggles and i’m always donating to food banks and charity to do my part in helping people that need it the most. I have money just sitting there doing nothing as I don’t need all of it so I like to do my part and donate. I think what you guys have done/are doing is amazing and I can’t thank you enough. You have made many family’s happy and you will continue to do that. Don’t ever be embarrassed about anything because the people that judge you are the people that are embarrassed about something there selves. Continue to complete your goals in life and i’m sure you will achieve them as that’s exactly what I did. Hope everyone has a very happy christmas. Good luck on your christmas number one. I have already pre ordered it on itunes.
Yes Mate! Already Pre-Ordered my copy sending your family Christmas joy from New Zealand
proud of you both mark and rox
It may be a silly song, but what you're doing is helping those who need help the most. Lad baby #1!!!

Mark truly is a good man....the love and admiration he has for Rox and the boys and the amount of pure sincerity when he speaks about the charities he supports.....this year has caused my cynicism to be pretty much a daily constant.....but seeing Mark shed tears made me cry......I needed that reminder that there IS good in the world.....Merry Christmas Ladbaby from the US
From California... Just pre-ordered 4 minutes and 2 seconds of another LadBaby Sausage Roll song!!  ...& purchased 20 bags of Walkers Sausage Roll crisps!!!  #YesMate

YESSSAS
I love that you are doing this again. As someone who spends 7 days a week volunteering to pick up and distribute waste food from the supermarkets in my town since I lost my job at the beginning of the year (and used to do 3 days pre lockdown) and distributing it to local people in need I can vouch for the fact that more and more people are needing this service now. It's brilliant yous are supporting the Trussell trust, it's great when our community comes together to help each other and I love that you are role modelling that to the wider public. Thanks guys :) xxx
Food charities all over are seeing high rises. The one I volunteer for has gone from around 300 meals a day to nearly 1000 in just a few months
That's it I'm just gonna say it you need you're own sausage roll company by one of the local shops
wishing you guys all the best, let's get Ladbaby to NO1 xx
I must say..: COME ON!!! ❤ from 🇧🇻 🙏🤞👍🤘

I love how it made a mockery of the Christmas number one. Such awful songs about sausage rolls but for a good cause. Scott mills hates ladbaby lol you can hear it in his voice when he talks about it on air. Mark is doing it for a laugh and good on him. Raising money for charity at the same time.
You guys are amazing humans, period

Just pre-ordered 👍, is there a donation link to the charity???

I know that this year is probably the hardest year most of you have had to face but you made it to this moment reading this comment and that is truly amazing and I am soooooo happy you didn't give up. This year lots of people went through depression and heartbreak from losing a loved one or even just being away from them but this is the year we all carried on despite it all, its the year we all held each other up. I just want to say thank you to everyone who has helped someone this year, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Keep going and remember you matter ❤❤

Pre-ordered!  Good luck for a third number one!
Yessss let's do this 🙏🤗🤗

I don't know how this works.  Am I correct in understanding that you compose a song, then whomever sells the most copies or raises the most for this charity wins the contest?
I paused the video as soon as I heard the title and went to pre order it. Let’s do this everyone, let’s do this !!!
Good luck Mark & Roxanne, left it a bit late but we will do our best for you.
Will be listening on repeat to get it to no. 1
LETS DO THIS AGAIN!!!!

I'm in the U.S. and it wouldn't let me purchase the song, but I found it on Amazon.com and bought it there.  Will you still get credit for it?

i'm ready to start playing it non stop!
I knew you’d do another one!
You guys are the greatest you deserve it...  Fingers crossed
Go on you can do it. All the best to you and doing it for an amazing charity
Let’s get ladbaby number one again yes mate!!!
I love both your songs, brought both, but I'm sad that I never hear your songs on the radio or even on a Christmas CD...
Hearing and seeing him cry made me start to cry and then laugh. Good job on that Ladbaby 😜 Zero for doubt it will go GOLD! Cheers to year 3 🍻
Ordered and shared. Let’s get them to #1again this year!!!!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
We need the Christmas merch
Ordered! Can’t wait 😃
Pre ordered fo sho 👍
Ordered. Let's do it again!
yes mate 👍👍👍😊
Really didnt think inwpuld be bk this year with a song after working so hard with walkers
Preordered in Canada!
Amazon won't let me download it
I’ll do all I can to support you wonderful people and at the end of the day it doesn’t work we have all helped a real good charity, you two are brilliant and deserve the world!!
I love this guy so much.... he’s absolutely hilarious, he’s an amazing father, and you can tell how much he really cares and how compassionate and caring he is in this video. Everyone should aspire to be ladbaby, these people are amazing ❤️ keep going 🙌
You are national treasures! Yes the charity deserves it and you deserve over a million subs by now!
I think this is what everyone needs after this year. Something fun, something to put a smile on people’s faces when times have been so tough! Every video you have uploaded has more then likely put a smile on someone’s face after they have had a bad day. I know it has for me after some terrible days working through this whole pandemic. Even just watching whilst on my break and it’s been the pick me up I have needed.   So thank you for putting a smile on the faces of those who need a pick me up. Never change and you guys are honestly just amazing!
TWO WORDS! YES! MATEEEEEEEE! Let's goooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!
Pre order already ordered. Let's get them to number 1 again this year
Just placed my pre-order. From the U.S. to the U.K., Merry Christmas, and God bless! ❤️🎄❤️

You’re both so lovely x
But can people in USA order it? From Amazon? It says it's there kind of money?
I pre-ordered this faster than I could say sausage roll!
You will do it again already pre ordered mine love you keep on doing what you do I dont miss a video I'm a huge fan and love it all cant wait to hear you get that number 1 spot YESSS MATEEE!

Pre ordered!!!
Come on ladbaby you got this we all believe in you
COME ON!!!!!! LADBABY WILL MAKE HISTORY
I love this channel but think it is now to much. The Christmas number one thins is to much. Yes i no it is for charity but there is so much more you can do other than take a good song again and put what is now becoming so repetitive over it and has nothing to do with the spirit of x mas. I think we all should go for something different this year  Its like all the x factor winners all over again
❤️❤️
3 years come on people make him the 1st ever to do this
Love you guys!! Let’s do it again. Yes mate!!!!!
Let’s do it guys

Without the Trussell trust this year I wouldn't have been able to eat, I lived on toast and jam, as long as my child had a proper meal. Christmas is going to be especially difficult.

Yes mate!! Pre-ordered, you're doing great work for The Trussell Trust. Let's make history again and get you to number 1!

Come on. Three christmas number one's. I've pre ordered my copy. It's going to be epic. YES MATE
Amazing haha keep up the hard work guys !!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Only 2 bands had ever gotten back to back Christmas number 1.. and Then Ladbaby became the third! If they get xmas number 1 this year, then a mother and father with a heart of gold with a wholesome youtube channel will of made absolute history. Think about that.. And the fact they snubbed y'all at the brit awards is a travesty.. they'll snub you again next year i'm sure, but you'll of done what no one else in the music industry has ever done before
OMG!!!!!! COME ON......LADBABY FOR CHRISTMAS NO 1...I'M PRE ORDERING NOW
Really can't wait to hear  your song . I got packet sausage rolls crisp and  I didn't want to throw away crisp packet so I put in oven to  turned it in to key ring x

From Nashville, Tennessee (the music capital of the United States), I have pre-ordered your 2020 song, and I also ordered your 2018 and 2019 songs. I was going to visit England for the first time this year, but the pandemic changed those plans. I’ve been following your family for a long time now, and it has made me smile and laugh through a very tough year. I donate to the local mission here. I see homeless people at every corner lately. I am grateful people like your family are in this world. And please remember, you’re already number 1 to all those people who benefit from the proceeds.
We're all behind you guys 👍
Ive shared 🙋🏼‍♀️❤
Literally to the 1% who's reading this, God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day. (my dream is to become a famous YouTuber) thanks 🙏🏻

I feel like sharing how you guys stay fun and silly and just awesome could really help some of us out here that are in ruts or struggling to get back the sparks in our marriages or relationships! We could learn from LadBaby! 😁 Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays everyone reading this! *Love The Song* #1
Get in
You guys are frickin awesome! Can’t wait to hear it and I’ll be telling everyone about it as well. I’m so proud of you both, and admire you deeply. You are doing something that really matters. Something important, that is gonna help so many people, and not just praise an already famous name and help make rich people even richer. You are such, lovely, genuine, humble people and even though luckily I’ve never been in a position to require help from a food bank, I am so grateful to you for what you’re doing and I appreciate you so much. Thank you again, and keep being awesome! x
