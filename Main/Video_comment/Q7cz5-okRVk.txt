🤣 thank you
2 Chronicles 7:14 if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land..
You have the wrong voice or the wrong body.
It is time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read your Bible
https://youtu.be/L35MUuY8o2E
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
You copied this At least give some credit
I’m Japanese  I couldn’t understand at all 😭
Bless your sweet, funny heart.🥰🦖
PLEASE STOP WAR IN UKRAINE!!! SUPPORT UKRAINE!!! RUSSIA BOMBS NUCLEAR STATION IN UKRAINE!!!
This is plot from that bollywood movie with Shah rukh Khan. I forgot what the title is..
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
Your funnylil big bro
Love to see the respect for the planet with these recycled jokes
We just gonna ignore the dirty joke he embedded in here
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
U stile from Luke Davidson
This video gonna come back to hit us in a couple years if you know what I mean
I’ve heard this like 5 times
when the worker  says come again, the lady thinks she means “(white stuff that happens during the devils tango) again?” so she says “No its toothpaste this time!”
I don't get the toothpaste one,:V can someone explain please :\
Right now Russian tanks are firing at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Watch online: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYUT36YGOh8
I died at come again LMFAO
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.  Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.  1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God..  Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.................................

Nice copy
Oh no it's Toothpaste this time😱😱😏😏😏😏😏😅😅

👎
What happened at 8:30
bro don't copy people
So nobody is talking about the “COME AGAIN” part?
It is copyed
I don’t get the joke at the end…
I don't get all the jokes can someons explain it to me?
If you didn't get it, the first one means that it's good that she doesn't know who he is so she doesn't tell the principle about him.
Don't worry bro, the boomerangs was thrown improperly so it's not coming back. Despite popular belief, a boomerang is not thrown like a Frisbee. It's actually more effective to throw is vertically in a down forward direction   Btw this comment isn't meant to be hostile or anything, helpful since boomerangs seem to never work if you've never been taught
Copy cat
Can someone explain the jokes to me
I didn't understand the first one
I thought this was all the same story
Wait a minute the 2nd last one you don’t mean that stuff right?
Luke gets the credit !
Wow so original
No ones going to talk about how principal is spelt wrong
I didnt get the 1 st one
These jokes ain’t funny
Is she " principles daughter" or "principal's daughter "?
Learn how to spell Principal it is not principle
The toothpaste blonde joke almost killed me.  Did not see that coming…. (See, I can be funny, too).
Olddd
This guy actually looks feminine when doning the shirt as a wig.  He should try to grow some beard later on to look more manly
This guy gets all his clout from other people talking
the fact that these jokes don’t link together
srry i have a monkey brain i don't get the first one🙃
“What happened at 8:30?”  Boss:work my guy…
A blonde walks into a drycleaners *guys just wearing a black towel on his head*
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺+🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦=🪖🔫💂
It wasn't worth it

Man none are even funny
Uhhh what I don't get it
Is dis just 1 long story of both people
I saw this meme weeks ago
It took me way too long to get the first one 💀
Whos the voice behind this I've seen so many people use it
It took me a second to get the toothpaste joke, but it was definitely worth it when I did understand it
You sound like Nathan Doan
For the kids that keep saying "stolen" "this guy just steals content" well actually no. It is a fucking tiktok sound.
I think I’m having a stroke
I hv the same jacket on the first one
U know what? U should change ur name to 'Stolen Productions', every one of ur shorts is someone else's , make content of ur own, u dont even give credit.
im littarly wearing a simalur jean jacket
man building in backround building when strong man is throwing a metel ball: im in more constant fear
💀💀💀
Click bait
Yay more copied content
That last one wasn’t a joke.
I remember this audio from last year but it still makes me laugh lmao
True story: I was standing at a food truck getting chips and soda. A bike messenger rolled up and asked me if I had the time. I answered, "Sure! What do you have in mind?" He actually stood there like he was thinking about it. Then I said, "It's  2:10 pm.
Ok
The way he keeps caressing his shirt as if it was a cute girls' hair got me bad... Come again.. Lol
"Thank you come again, oh no it's toothpaste this time"... 🤣  EDIT: For those whom don't understand perhaps it's because you don't have a dirty mind. It's a reference to sexual intercourse and leaving stains on the sheets.
I remember when I was 7, I threw a boomerang and never got it back. I still go to the same place where I threw it but I have to force myself
A blonde also her having black hair
I don't understand the toothpaste one Plz explain for me
Please stand up If you think your dumb, a boy stands up, she says why do you think your dumb, the kid goes, I don’t I just don’t wanna see you stand alone

BRO STOP copy and paste from another guys YouTube channel
I’m dead lmao I hate to see u standing alone😂😂😂
Husband says "Ha, funny jokes." And has a huge smile on his face.  Thank you.
Boomerang reminds me of a Mickey Mouse episode
The Gospel of Jesus *if you're interested* All people have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. The penalty for our sin is death. But Jesus came to Earth, lived a perfect life, died, and was resurrected to pay the penalty for our sins! Repent and have faith in Him💗m
I wish this dude would give credit and he still can swallow a banana sideways with that mouth
I think I have seen some of these before
LOL
Its the same damn joke
Ive never seen this before111!1!1 (sarcasm)
Come a again  oh on its  toothpaste Me taking a sec to think me:ooooooooooooh 😳

It took me a second to realize when she said "come again?"
this would be remotely funny if these jokes hadn't been reused thousands of times,  this is rock bottom humor
Wow
Doesn’t even give the credit to the original creator Luke Davidson 🙄 so disappointing 😔
May someone explain the 3rd one
WOOOOW

I didn't get the joke on the first one

“One day the teacher said if you think you dumb stand up and then a little boy stands up and the teacher asks why do you think your stupid and the boy says I just didn’t like seeing you standing there all alone
