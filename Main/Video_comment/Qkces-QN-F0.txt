I love this!! Rio just watch your rants about defending mike Ashley you absolute  Hippocrate (sorry for spelling) you are embarrassing your owners have put their hands in pocket to pay for top players and top managers! You are a disgrace! Man Utd are hilarious now! Cry me a river!
Both moaning like Gary neville
Say thank-you to the glazers rio
"almost crashed the car 3 times, and I was in the passenger seat"
Why is howsing on this - TURNED OFF STRAIGHT AWAY
"what they probably paying them" interesting choice of words.
It is just soul destroying to think how far we have fallen. We have overpaid, weak minded players who don’t know how to win - except Ronaldo. Ragnick was correct - open heart surgery required. We will continue to struggle until we are under new, solid ownership.
United Fanbase is so spoilt, how can you be mad at owners who have spent billion in a decade. your complaining about recruitment was it not ten hag who decided to sign a 5ft9 centre back, was it not ten hag who signed a 5ft7 left back c’mon. Problem with united is the fanbase won’t allow your managers to prosper. U want big names and have no patience. Klopp finished 8th his first season with Liverpool didn’t challenge for title until his fourth season. Pep didn’t win a thing his first season at city and he already inherited a mad squad, even arsenal fans had patience with Arteta now their owners are getting the right players for his style of football. United need to realise they’re rebuilding and need to have patience.
These players aren’t good enough? We are talking about Brighton and god damn brentford not the fcking UCL final against prime Barca lool
Utd are a dusted club 😂😂😂😂
Can’t even banter arsenal fans? We’ve won more than you in recent years.....
Question for you guys, what game do you think MUFC will win 4 - 0 this season and against which team?
Meme Utd living it up👍
Took the Glazers money though didn't you and supported a manager who slammed the FC United fans for their breakaway club.
I may be naïve, but how are the Glazers responsible for the players drive to play football.
United's biggest problem is that their expectations are set way too high. They first need to be set at winning the relegation battle. Bring in big Sam!
Biggest hypercritic going. Does he forget how he defended Mike Ashley with Newcastle fans in the same situation.
Just play the academy and be done with it. This team is finished.
All the years of corrupt decisions finally got up to you mancs
The worst thing is that Ten Hag had a chance to rectify the crappy performance against Brighton but he made it even worse lol  Wouldn't be surprised if you go and beat Liverpool now though because that's how football seems to go
No one would pay what we paid for Bruno if we put him up for sale today
Well money doesn’t buy success   Man U like to pay the players OTT. But the players they got are average
I’m sick of tired of ex Man U players   Blame the foreign players but ignore the British   Man U are a big club yes   But now a laughing stock   When moriniho was in charge 2nd place europa champions   But the Man U ex players blamed him not the players   Hypocrites
I liked Bruno Fernandez but now he is playing silly  I don’t know why  The all looks silly not good at all Keep changing managers  Some of the players have to leave  Shame on them
You'll believe in big names players but this season is for new young talent who is hungry for success, & Manchester has some young lads & new players who is not being highlights on the pitch.. the coach is to be blame for the poor & weak line up he makes when he got good players on the bench lol this coach is a joke 🤣
Feel sorry for players. You must be joking. The players are a disgrace. There is no winning mentality and the character of these players is not good.  Individual mistakes can happen but the fact that Brentford players ran more than Man Utd players shows that they wanted it more. Why on earth are we still starting Maguire, Shaw, Fred and Rashford? Ten Hag needs to show authority and bench these underperforming players. I would rather see us lose with youth players than these lot.
The lines up is a joke. How can he put Martinez in center back & Erikson in defense mid field smh 😞. The coach has no idea of the players he got. Bruno need to be bench so Erikson can play is position, Martinez should play Luke shaw position & elanga must start over rashford. This coach is a fool by the way he put his line up.
What if they spend big and bring in high profile players but still the team doesn’t gel! Who do you blame then? No club deserves continuous success overnight…surely this is a work in progress which is gonna take a massive amount of time to rebuild regardless of how much money you throw at it!
Rio, the glazers are just businessmen like Mike Ashley! They doing a great job!
Just be grateful that in the next game you're not playing another team beginning with ' B ' .. 😁
These billionaire owners have put a price on talent when it should b priceless what a joke
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Time to build housing on Old Trafford, we need the accommodation for the immigrants, a good start can be made here !
Stephen How To Win Friends... The Price of Politics -_-
Protest on Monday get behind it guys ,rio have a prawn sandwich with Arnold and murtagh... Ralph told you all.  But you didn't wanna listen to the proper d.o.f .. Jamie vardy is the answer to uniteds problem . Can't sell a player can't buy a player .. glazers out Arnold and murtagh join them
Already predicting Bournemouth to beat Man U 4-0 as well I see
Rio owes Ralph rangnick a massive apology... united brought a dof into the club and made him coach.  Sacked him when he exposed the structure of the club . Now look at united bottom of the league and panic buying vardy ,anatovicj  rabiot ????    Ralph,  zakaria  kamara ,alvarez  would of cost united 25 /30 m  . Look what John murtagh your pal ,rio has done ?
Bormouth?! 😂👋🏿
Is it just me or does the title of this video have a mistake in it? Shouldn't it be Brentford instead of Bournemouth?
The club have let 10hag down. Cr7 wanna leave bcos its being exposed that this club is finished. Its sad. Under the glazers this club is a goner
Glazers cant come, too busy laughing all the way to the bank 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Keep it up United,Ur doing fine!! 🤭🤭
I am getting angrier listening to this but also feel helpless.
Im with Stephen who cares if the parasitic glazers come now. To quote the great Claude from AFTV (RIP) its time to go.
Ste or Rio... If it took united to be relegated this year to get rid of these owners would you choose that over another 10 years of mediocre football and non existent owners?
I was in my car watching the game and almost crashed 3 time ooooppppssssy
Bournemouth?
The problem with keeping McGuire as captain is that he cannot go back into the dressing room and point fingers at players who are playing terrible. He’s entire team would bash him for the amount of mistakes he makes on a weekly basis. A captain needs to be a leader, if he is making mistakes be accountable and lead by your next example. His lack of presence as a leader on the pitch is ManU’s downfall.
Hope Utd continue falling. Absolute joke of a club run by clowns. Over $1 billion spent and 8 managers since Fergie. Utd issue is way worse than Arsenals. Atleast Arsenal didn't spend as much or change that many managers .
Funny how when Rio was selling his crappy sports label in Mike Ashleys tat emporiums, he was saying how Newcastke fans need to be realistic and that Ashley is a shrewed businessman. Hyocrisy in it's purity.
“Whether you like it or not, he’s the one that’s put the money up and he’s doing what he thinks is right for the club. Whether the Geordies like it or not - a lot of them hate him and don’t like him but round your money up and take over the club then.”  Remember those words Rio ? So put up or shut up. It’s their club and they’re doing what they think is right for THEIR club. If you disagree get your money together and buy the club. Wanker !
Whether you like it or not, they are the ones that's put the money up and they are doing what think thinks is right for the club. You may hate them and don't like them, so round your money up and take over the club then.
The title says Bournemouth 4-0 can they predict the future?
Brentford !!! Not Bournemouth ( Look at the title ) . Heads are truly gone !! 😂😂😂

Embarrassing that rio sits with a clown who wished another person dead all because his channel is the largest united channel and fan channel in the world disgrace rio
Probably Renaldos goals which masked the problem last season ,if united stay up it will be Renaldos goals which save them
When ten hag arrived I knew straight away he was useless by keeping Harry Maguire and especially keeping him as captain. An embarrassment
Why appeal to the Glaziers? The club is run off a spreadsheet which really motivates everyone as you’d expect.
embarrassing, lack of focus and thats just the title of the video. Bournemouth were brilliant
Yes,bad performance by man u but don't blames everyone cause others team in the EPL are getting better. But if this form they plays against Liverpool next week...?????
If I was Ten Hag I’d walk now … shambles of a club … relegation will be a strong possibility with these snowflakes
I fully agree with Rio where are they ? Any owners of a buisness thats failing would be going mad and trying to get it right the Glazers dont care
They are not there because they don’t care about football. Only their late father was interested and he was the one who went ahead and bought the club. These kids of his are Americans. American football, baseball and golf is their thing. Not football.
Yeh where glzer..bullshit..glzer must out from the club...
After what you said about Ashley and Newcastle surely you should be saying Thank You to the Glaziers 😂
Should get all your mates together and buy the club if you're unhappy Rio!
I do wonder sometimes Rio if you jumping online and destroying the players after every bad performance is actually helpful to the squad in anyway shape or form.  If you were in a failing team at United in your day, I don’t think Stam jumping on YouTube and destroying you would of helped you find your confidence.  We’ve already got Keane and Neville destroying the lads every week.  And Gary in particular May be speaking to a wider view of outing the Glazers with his comments, but ultimately in the short term. Announcing to the football world on national television that our Stadium is nakered and our training ground is second rate, only hinders any potential signings we could make.  I’m starting to think Ruud Gullit is right when he says “now United have had a bad game, all their old legends will run to criticise in the guise of helping, but they don’t help”…
what Rio doesn't seem to get is that, the owners don't see a problem with how the club is run. what point is there in showing up, it's not like they are going to come and inspire the recruitment to do better, or the players, or get fans onside....they just need to go
These owners are systematically running the biggest, most loved and supported club in the world into the damn ground and it’s time something gave!  10 years ago we had the best ground, the best training facilities, the best academy and the money and status to purchase and attract “the” best players in the world, all of that has been run into the ground and into disrepair by these parasitic owners and their negligence. It’s time for change in ownership sooner rather than later, how we do that, I’m not sure.
Well, it would be a good start if Rashford and Sancho started attacking their full backs. Forget passing the ball sideways and back. Have a go! Take the risk! I also think three centre backs (two with pace) are needed at United as insurance for Maguire's lack of pace. Maguire is an aerial asset at set pieces. Why isn't this being exploited? Definitely need aggression and physical presence in midfield which McFred don't have. We need two tall guys up front for the long ball if the opposition press high. Put all that right and you're on your way to repairing the problems.
Its not just that 'the Glazers are ruining this club and not investing this summer', (That is a HUGE problem for sure),, BUT it seems there is another big issue here. Even (IF) Utd had got Darwin Nunez, De Jong, Antony, Timer and Savic this summer, the SAME thing would happen, there is something wrong within the team. This team (squad) of players clearly do not get along with each other. There are player problems with each other in the team and that is explaining why so many talented players are playing so bad with each other. When players do no get along, when there are divides in the squad, when there are cliques happening, then these players are not gonna gel together OR play well together.  This needs sorting out before anything else. IMO
Maguire had NOBODY showing for him in first 15mins, despite Brentford closing defence down! That's criminal, it shows there's zero confidence in the side.  I expect the players to finally do enough running and closing down against Liverpool though
time for a change upstairs man united fans? ⚽
Don't know why but I'd love to hear any comments from Ibra about the club
The Glazers are the root cause of this rapid decline of this club. Until the Glazers ownership is terminated we are f*ck’d!!!!!!!!
It's a bit evil, but I love Ste floundering when United lose. YNWA
The players are always looking for excuses not to work hard and take responsibility for their own outcomes. Off the ball is even more important than on the ball. Man utd players are decent. The manager is good. Time is everything and you have to take some short term pain for long term gain. Those owners though they are the rotting core of soul of your club. The fans have to rise up and help change it. ❤️⚽🤔
Rio is a joke, he was defending Mike Ashley when Mike Ashley's Newcastle was rotting and he never attended games, seemed totally hands off... hired non footballing people to run the club and now has the exact same beef with the glazers. Great footballer, completely biased on his footballing views for anyone to give a f!@# about
You.don't.like.mnutd.you.are.crook.
Rio Rio Rio, where should I start. When I when to spurs as a young teenager in the 70s,it used to cost me £1 to get in and watch the team hoddle was in. Now when I take my teen to watch spurs, it costs over £140 for us to get in. This in my view is footballer wages. None of you care about the generation that will never watch a match live due to the cost. Footballers have taken billions in wages without a thought of the cost being passed onto the fans. The Glazers are doing exactly what you did as a player. You are all greedy and for man u, the chickens have truly come home to roost. You sit in your mansion demanding money be spent on new players. Where do you think the money come from. THE FANS.
Ten hag need to changed his mind about maguire as the captain, trashford shaw bruno and mcfred as the starter instead of about ronaldo ! Martinez cant worked out at the back , ten hag need to put his ego elsewhere and try to play Martinez as a cdm very soon . The pressure keep mounting , he need to act fast if he really want to achieve something
Someone explain to me how Maguire starts over varane?? A show should be made on that alone.
The manager can't be blamed. We had the same thing with Jose the Ole, the issue is solely with the players!
Stop sabotaging Eric Bailey!!!
Rio had a go at Ralph for airing the business. There is a reason why he left and this is it. He got pushed out because of speaking the truth instead of doing everything to keep him as a behind the scenes figure helping to make decisions.
Here from the Paddock. Man I feel you Rio and Ste. Sucks to keep being embarrassed. Keep hearing okes round the office asking who supports Inited and I feel like Peter after Jesus’ arrest man. Fucken just deny or face the shame 😂😂. Until it’s Sold we’re not getting any better. Just hopefully the players learn to scrap for points sooner rather than later.
Ralf had to bring in a sport psychologist so, there you go. Mentally not up to it. They need to shift that captaincy/leadership. Rest Maguire shaw MacFred Bruno. I feel sorry for De gea. He won't survive this playing style.
Players only care about money they don’t care abt the club they should not even be able to wear the shirt and I think United should put all players on £50,000 or less and c how they play
These guys still don’t get it….. the glazers didn’t buy United to make it better. They saw it as an opportunity to make money by sucking money out of it until it’s sucked dry!!
Oh how I wish we still had Jose as manager. He was spot on with what he said, and should have been given the time to sort it out. We certainly wouldn’t be an average premiership outfit right now.
I hate saying this, but I HATE this so called United "team".
Everyone talks about bringing in Rabiot etc won't change our fortunes. The big players that are in their prime do not want to come to United. We will have to take good academy prospects and decent experienced players (yes, some from lesser clubs), and build from there. We can't keep thinking that players from mid table teams aren't good enough to bring to United, because many of those players are better than what we've got. We'll have to suck it up and search for players to rebuild.
De gea makes mistakes every single season.....few times a season every season it's nowhere near good enough
Same players same mistakes year after year and they expect things to change???
SELL OFF MAGUIRE AND WATCH UNITED CLUB SEAT UP 💯 MAGUIRE IS A SYMBOL OF FAILURE AND OF COURSE HIS FACE TELLS IT ALL!!!
The 3 greatest signings of this century were Rio & CR7 & RVN - all signed before arrival of the Glaziers. In 8 months time - it will be 6 seasons with NO trophy’s- only Rio as assistant head coach (AHC) to Ten Hag can turn it around - even better if they can appoint 4 AHC’s Rio - G.Neville - Roy.K & P.Scholes. It’s all about the mentality- they have only one monster in the team & that’s CR7. Like Gabby Aghbonlahar said - Strangers on the pitch- Strangers who like to B!tch - Strangers who are too rich. If u get a big monster like Rio in as a AHC then other monster mentality players will want to come play for him. Eg Sadio Mane & De Jong would run through a brick wall to play for Rio.
Rio has to be added to the coaching staff - players respect him - harry McGuire needs rio’s monster mentality installed in his mind. It could be 0-7 vs liverpool. Best Man U can hope fir is if Man U escape with a 1-3.
Why can't somebody as high profile as Rio not get in touch with Jim ratclifffe?
How did Ole come third and second with a lot of these players. The problem ETH has is he is trying to get a whole team to play a completely new system to what most of them have played in the past . It is going to take time but also it does need a few more players . I personally don’t understand why Gardner and Garnacho can’t get a run . They can be any worse than what is out there at the moment .
Haven't the glazers provided significant funds to buy players ?
Ronaldo might just be the problem as soon as he came back into the team they start underperforming and losing I think he's toxic and needs to leave  if the club wants to start fresh they need to get rid of any distractions create a strict regime and don't take no bs from anyone staff or players. if the players ain't there mentally there's no way they will be able to perform. IT needs changes and big sacrifices
When you break down the decession making at the club it feels like I'm watching a 9 year old play football manager .   Sell smalling for 12m , Decline signing koulibali for 95m and buy Maquire for 85m 🚫  Manager asks for some top level defenders board  signs  Rojo , Darmien , Bailey and linderlof while Liverpool sign Van dike.   Manager needs strikers , Board Buy ighalo,  Sanchez , Falcal and Cavani in the last week of each window .   Reject 25m for linguard,  41m for pogba and allow them to leave on a free a season later .   Give bumper contracts to Rashford , Bruno , De gea , Martial , phill jones , Luke Shaw and make them un sellable.  Take a 30m bonus every year while the stadium crumbles.    70% of transfers made by the board not what the manager wanted us to target. Ed listening to souts over what the manager needs for his philosophy.   Hire a banker to make football decessions when he's never kicked a ball in his life .   6 managers , Lvg , ten haag and Mourinho  classed as the most technical in football , Rr who is one of the great analytical minds in football all couldn't get these players to up their effort on the pitch.   Only owners in prem history not to spend £1 of their own money in 10 years .
Edwards Charlton Buchan Robson Keane Ferdinand Rooney Neville.....All leaders of Men and Leaders on the pitch and OFF.  We have Maguire? Your problems start there.  The rest is irrelevant.
"This is not the Manchester United I once knew"  There's the problem, you're too young, this IS Manchester United, Ferguson & Busby were the anomalies and what you have now is United returning to the mean, get used to it as you're not that special
Is relegation our best hope???
How ironic is it that the chicken has come to roost!!   Ralf Rangnick said we need up to 10 players and it seems only him and fans with sense that seen that. Man like rio out here putting out to the public that he should be banned from press conferences, why?  There were so many fans that loved every presser from him cos he was showing all these delusional pundits whats really going on.
Why can't these players play for pride? It's a game of football! Who cares about the chairpeeps? Chairpeeps should just give money for the stadium/players/coaching then f..k.ff! How many times do we see or hear chairpeople of those clubs who face relegation? Half of these players seem as though they've already booked a flight abroad...They are killing careers!
I don’t want to hear United fans complaining about money spent. Hire a good DoF and manager and the problems go away. That’s it
We have become arsenal pain
i am only waithing for new owners i dont care about new signinings or who is leaving as long the glaziers are in charge the club will stay rotten
My mans said “ i almost crash 3x …i was in the passenger side. Lmao
The Glazers will never truly understand what the club means to the fans. Asking them to understand is a waste of time. They're not Abramovich, they're not in it to play 3D Football Manager, they're in it to make money. So they're not fans and therefore, cannot be expected to understand the fans. I think that this season could see them gone. I hope so, at least.
Glaziers combined with hopeless Football  Management (Woodward) and poor recruitment you have all the ingredients for a disaster.
I have to say, the business is NOT struggling, its thriving! Why do the owners need to communicate with the fans? To say what?! The stadium improvement talk is nonsense. Have Chelsea improved Stamford Bridge? It's excuses. The glazers have invested! When utd lose the EX PLAYERS talk glazers! Basically what they want is a sugar daddy to just keep pumping money in! The Glazers own the club NOT the fans, they can take money out of the club if they want to. It doesn't affect what happens on the pitch. Its business! There is no quick fix and the bottom line is Utd need to accept that it is going to take at least 5- 10 years to get back to where they want to and even then other teams would've improved. Time is needed! A strategy and a clear plan is needed!
Recruitment is a shambles ! Worse for value in the league
Well said Rio!
Get used to the fact your club Is a shithouse
Glazers were paying your wages su sunshine
Man u might need to be relegated before things change
RF has to be 1 of the biggest hypocrites around.... Listen to what he is saying here and then refer to what he told Newcastle fans when they were complaining about Mike Ashey's running of NUFC.  Talking about how the Glazers need to come out and speak and communicate. Mike Ashey was notorious for not communicating with fans and when he did an interview everything he said was quickly found to be lies.  “He [Mike Ashley] don’t care what people think. “It’s his club and he’s doing what he wants to do. “Whether you like it or not, he’s the one that’s put the money up and he’s doing what he thinks is right for the club. “Whether the Geordies don’t like it… “A lot of them hate him and don’t like him but… “Round your money up and take over the club then.”  It's the Glazer's club, Rio. If you don't like it round your money up and take over the club. Otherwise be quiet.  Totally unrelated that Rio had business dealing with Mike Ashley at the time he was making his comments of course....
🩼🩼🩼🩼🩼🩼🩼🩼 This is what all rival fans should be injecting in their veins 😂😂😂😂
We gotta stick with ten hag. He will deliver provided we give him time and get rid of more dead wood. It clear the high turnover of managers is not working. ITS THE FECKING PLAYERS. I just hope they are reading the dossier prepared by Ragnick.  If the divas can’t cut it play the fecking kids at least they have the heart to play for this club
It is just soul destroying to think how far we have fallen. We have overpaid, weak minded players who don’t know how to win - except Ronaldo. Ragnick was correct - open heart surgery required. We will continue to struggle until we are under new, solid ownership.
i almost crashed the car 3 times and i was in the passenger seat... bruh
best intro ever lol
God how I miss the days of Ferdinand and Vidic, Valenica and evra and even the Da Silva brothers ffs.
Even Arsenal at their worst won a couple of FA Cups.
The whole lineup screamed defensive shortcomings. MCGUIRE is asssss, positioning, touch, awareness, pace, everything he does is terrible, then u have Martinez as the other centreback when hes waaaay to small and slight to be a premier league centre back. Ajax always have possesion and its a lesser league so u can get away with that. Hes a left back on the prem, period. Fred as ur only holding midfiekder, again nlt good enough or strong enough to cover it on his own especially when u bave ericksen and fernandes as the the other 2?! They are number 10's Who dont have defensive skills being asked to track bsck all game and help Fred??? Horrendous.
F****k about time rio spoke up,if ex players had any sympathy about the fans like fans stood by you (players)through thick and thin it's only right you guys support us through these days
Glazer out 45 yrs old and never seen us play so bad since the 80s even them we was winning the odd fa cup
The coaching department seems to be non existent. Not a single player has improved and loads have regressed, that's damning. Rabiot is overrated by the way.
So proud of Rio speaking up against this ownership while so many others sit silent. Club legend as a player and also now as a supporter. We need people like Rio involved with the club. Glazers out.
Does Rio actually read the comments?
I love this game 😂
We can’t talk to the players but you guys can. This is insane, you need to speak to the players like Roy would. Forget about previous managers. Forget about excuses. Forget about sympathy. This is rubbish and the players need to know how fans feel.
"This is Manchester United" - Gary Neville
PUMPED up the FARTER no LUBE  THE MAN U WIGGLE
Pep on a show string budget? The man spent close to 200 million on fullbacks alone his first 2yrs...all he does is spend and still csnt win the ucl
This video is priceless I’m so glad to see Rio cheesed off because I remember when city lost the semi final in the champions league his smiles couldn’t be any bigger this is karma and long live the glaciers and believe me everybody is laughing at you lot this could be the best season ever people are going to milk this situation mark my words on that
Why is ETH playing short Martinez in the midfield this the epl. Martinez is too short to play in defense. Why not play him in the Midfield instead he stuck Erikson in defensive midfield. It shows ETH doesn't understand the physicality in the epl. ETH refused to have a conversation with Rangnick, he could have learned a lot from the conversation. ETH is naive.
Delusional utd fans predicting them to finish in the top 4 and arsenal to finish 7th/8th. What a bunch of overconfident bunch of fans. Deserved what is happening to you
They need to be locked in the dressing room with with two crates of lager and not let out till it's all drunk
While i can agree that ddg is a great shot stopper...I don't see him adding anything to the United defense. He does not come out, he is not commanding, he does not communicate, he cannot pass a ball,  etc. Mark my words he is a massive part of our woes. Letting dean henderson go was a mistake i think
Really tough times to be a United fan. Keep the faith we will be back one day, but not this season #GlazersOut
I forgot it was the Glazers who played Eriksen false 9 last week and DM this. They also want DDG to play out from the back and wanted Rey Mysterio at CB. GlazersOut
it's giving us all a great laugh, keep it up Utd it's making us feel so good even with all that is going on with the economy, lmao lmao lmao lmao
My wife ran off with the milkman yesterday and I blame the glazers?? 😂
The problems with United are many. Maguire, Shaw and Rashford must be benched or let go. When they play, it's like they are by themselves, doing what they like and hope someone will cover for them. This English boys must play mentality has got to be revised. During the pre-season games, the policy was relaxed and we all know how well they did. Also, the genesis of Man utd fall is authoritatively located on the arrival of Maguire. When he came, folks were like who is he, wetin he don do, who know am outside England, wey dem make am Team Captain. Many of the players then, even now are portraying this. Check the body language it is there. 2. They say drop McFred midfield duo. For who? United needs 2 CDM to cover for Maguire's flaws and Fred (who is btw, only energetic not a natural CDM) unfortunately is assigned to do that. Fred is somewhere between a CM and CAM, not anywhere close to a CDM (see when he plays for the Brazilian team). This is why when playing for United, his instructions are contrary to his natural playing style. You see him infront, then at the back, doing Shaw or Maguire or Lindelof's job. Mctominay on the other hand, is too temperamental and relatively inexperienced and so when he starts, gets a yellow card and gets pulled off. No other midfielders on that team can do what these 2 do, they are the most versatile midfielders United have. Fernandez cannot defend, Van De Beek is still struggling with the United philosophy of play. Eriksen is getting old. Who else now? This is why we want De Jong but then if he can’t come to United then look elsewhere. it does not matter the coach we hire, the stars we sign, if the "English boys must play" is not revised and Maguire, Shaw and Rashford are benched or moved along, all will be the same.
This players should at least pity the Ardent fans and season ticket buyers #manutd #mufc
Better we use our youth under 23 and 21..am sure they will provide better
Dead food =United my heart bleeds .never thought we would sink this low.
Wasn't Rio part of the Manutd first eleven when city smashed them 6-1... please remind him
Bring back ralf
We’re fucked. Finishing 10th is the best we will get, and that’s optimistic because I think we’ll be 16th
Man…Ole went to Europa League final and made top 4 twice with this team.
Well said Rio 👏 Maguire???? Where is the so called captain????
Let's sell everyone in the main team except van de Beek, Malacia, Sancho, Martinez, Eriksen, Ronaldo, and Dalot.
Should 've been hired Conte in the first place, he probably wouldn't be staying beyond 3 seasons but i think   the problem in the club would get fix
Rio is anti glazer when it's fashionable, not for years looking for a job
You got to sell players that dont work out straight away not hold on to them qnd think something is going to change
Wtf happened to our academy also there's no hype anymore looking at our system
I'm loving it. 🤣🤣🤣
After this early results, it's gonna be really difficult to convince any decent player to come to United... Who is going to want to come play for ManU?? The rebuild on the pitch is gonna be with the youngsters, can rely on many of the older players, and forget about reinforcements
Brentford so hard to play against 😂😂😂but when they beat Arsenal last season it was the line used it was how bad Arsenal were!
GLAZERS OUT
Why's Rio crying?  He tried to engineer a move to Chelsea when things started going wrong at United.
Arsenal fans here are not aware thier regular problems are just a defeat away from popping up. They behave like al problems solved in just two games🤣. We know Arteta
I bet you if rio Ferdinand come back on defense for Manchester United many progress would be made  He would take maguire’s spot easy !
14:18 GTFO United already plays in the only Superleeague that exists, which is the Premier League, kings of financial doping since the early 2000. But it's not even a european superlegue because it's owned by the arabs, the yankees, the chinese, etc. You wanna talk about crooks? You are allowing murdererers to fund your filthy league.
“Fair” means nothing when you’re banking millions in dividends every quarter.  Bottom line: nothing changes until someone comes with billions to buy them out.
Well they say it's darkest before dawn. In that case this feels like the long night.
As a lifelong Man U fan I'm utterly embarrassed about where we are today... and how we have systematically declined post Alex Ferguson... but I do believe in miracles and fairytales... the sun will shine on us again!!
Rio, maybe it's time for you and some of the ex-players to have a chat with Michael Knighton. #glazersout
Rio is such a hypocrite... Why don't the Manchester United fans "pool in their money and buy the club if they don't like how it's run" 🤬
rio says he wants the owners to communicate and wants the glazers to invest yet he slagged newcastle fans off for saying the same about ashley live on tv mans a fkn hypocrite
Ten hag is setup to fail, Untill the glaziers sell up nothing will change.
They're not running, trying or fighting. They're not a team. United has fallen from grace.
Nothings going to change and the Glazers aren’t going to sell, and the only reason is that they are still reaping the rewards of full stadiums.   Why would they spend when they can get get stadiums without spending much.   #commonsense
utd have made sanco,pogba, varane, shaw,sanchez,Bruno all worse..mind blowing..graveyard for top players now
Finally even you can not stand these shambles
You are now Banter FC 😊 enjoy
I worried for Ten Haag last week before the Brighton game, when asked about Brighton, he said they're a decent passing side DECENT!! If he knew anything about them, he would have known that Brighton are a FANTASTIC passing team. He underestimated them.
I think Varane and Bailey wouldn’t have conceded those goals.
Man Utd are back!  Haggy's at the wheel!!!!
*TRANSFER WINDOW ALMOST CLOSED...HERES MY BID FOR HARRY MAGUIRE!!...80p...AND THATS TOO MUCH!!*
We won't win any cups or titles with this crop of players were a mid table team fact
14 minutes in and I’m on my 5th advert. Nope 👋
Stop playing the English players! .. try that for once PLEASE!!!! .. Shaw Maguire Mctominay Rashford stop playing the English players!! .. Eric Bailly is there .. Malacia didn't come in to rub bench .. Martinez is there .. Erikson .. put little faith in Garnacho ... Stop playing the English Players!!!
Who would rather have running your Club, Corrupt Man City or John Henry and FSG with Julian Ward as Sporting Director and working alongside Klopp, Pep and all of his coaching staff.  Klopp and the owners just do not go and spend money on players they do not think is right for the club, Klopp ants stability and you look at the youngsters and the first team would go through brick walls for Klopp and his coaching staff and most importantly the fans.   I will never forget when UTD fans where taking the piss out of Liverpool players hand in hand waving in the air, the media had a field day. Who is has the last laugh now?   So would have this winning model, Gary Neville and another you tuber Mark Goldbridge said Liverpool have the winning formula this is from die hard UTD fans. I cannot wait to see Liverpool play UTD a week on Monday. YNWA
Not going lie who the hat fit wear it . But some ppl don’t talk the trust about the club and hype up bad players .
He says that but running down michael fool
What we’d do for Rio to be in our back line again. This team is full of gutless heartless ……
United need to get their academy going again.  Bring in players hungry to win.  But if there is no nutrition staff for the youth, then that is a challenge.  They are right though; if Glazers don't invest in the club spiritually, then United will continue to struggle.  I can empathize cause Liverpool went through it with Hicks and Gillette.  The league is better when United are doing well.  Best of luck with the rest of the season.
I don't think it's the Glazers fault if the manager and  the director of football beg a player to come to MU for three months and don't buy players it's their fault to have appointed that director of football.
Mistakes all round
Big Sam it could happen
Not even mad any .more , just dissapointed, youth in
Glazer's are venture capitalists and don't give a fig.
Ok players go into work got self look at, why us fans get ripped bits at work and when will it end , like away form shocking , home not better either , poor players,
We are the worst Football Club in the league. FACT
Actually They have invested in the stadium. I worked on it about 6 years ago they renovated the toilets in the red Cafe and players lounge.......
It’s funny because the so called “virus” is gone, yet the disease still remains. This club is in the mud
The City owner doesn’t spend anytime at city, why? Because he pays the best people to run and manage the club, it’s that simple a club like UTD should have the best manager the best assistant best coaches best physicians at every level, not just jobs for the boys, Darren Fletcher, Steve McClaren Mike phelan do me a favour and that before you get on about the players.
Man U just need to build like AC Milan did years ago, gone with all the “non hard working” players. Take them out, buy young p.Ayers, but that guy with the David Luiz hair and Garnacho, put the young guys in. It will not be worse then now. It costed Milan 7 years
Uniteds just a cash cow for the Glazers. Just interested in it ticking over. Can see United collapse into a Leeds United, a once great club
Call out individual players like your buddies maguire and rashford
Im Inter fan and our story’s are quite the same owner wise, only thing is that we have a better team with good players in every position. and still can challenge for the title and maybe have a good run in CL but our owner is a massive joke. He’s in Milan for like 2 months a year, when the seasons is gone and he needs a profit again so sells top players and is gone to China so he don’t have a problem with angry fans, it’s a joke. He can’t even spend 1M because of a ban in China when he can’t invest in a football club (same as Wolves have now) it’s unbelievable. Our broke owners don’t care about us Inter fans who go 9 hours with a fk bus for a away game against Lecce. Their ego is to big to sell and they are acting like everything is good
Play the youth team instead ! bet they have more passion in them!
Credit to Brentford...every one of their  players looked a class above Mess Utd's slow, clueless & unmotivated individuals. Too many to name, so I won't bother!
I’m sick of people saying are players are better than certain smaller clubs , no there not if they hadn’t a united jersey on there back nobody would talk about them , even rashford let’s be honest at best he’s decent but he’s not what united think he is , just one example
When we apologise to Jose and Vangal then u can progress. We sluged these managers like they were the problem. Well...I hope we find a solution .
Where is the Arsenal lad?! He missed out on talking about this shite show called Utd, big time!   Guys, as a Arsenal supporter I can honestly say yesterday was a beautiful day. But jokes aside, I called this when the fixtures came out. Like Arsenal last season, Utd would be bottom of the league after the first 3 games. Brentford and Brighton are the antithesis of Utd. Your kryptonite if you will. Everything you’re not good at they excel in. Liverpool are just better full stop. Biases is the only reason why couldn’t see the above coming. Keane and Neville both had some things to say about Arsenal in their season predictions. Shocking analysis from paid professionals. Being wrong is okay but their reasoning leaves a lot to be desired.
Football used to be an escape...It helped towards my mental health, watching United of late only leaves me depressed... it's heartbreaking to see how far we've fallen... We're at rock bottom and I can't see us getting out of it
😆😆😆
The whole difference is that it isn’t their business  They inherited it from the father and not a dollar of their own money has gone into it, so no attachment in a financial or emotional way  Just a bit of free money every year
Have a whip round with Neville and the lads and put your own money in Rio. Was good enough for Newcastle fans wasn't it?
to be a united fan right now from yesterday performance was so heart breaking and shocking i couldn't believe it, we sacked lvg,jose,ole,ragnick and the common denominator is the owners who put these people in charge to run our football club. I know rio that you have to be careful with what you say but even if behind the scenes if the likes of yourself, neville, evra can come together to really get the glazers out. they are incompetent owners its been proven for over 10 years, is the Micheal consortium really serious about taking over the club, i don't know but we can have them here by this season we just cant. look at the transfer strategy, we only spent money on Martinez and pocket change on malacia, erikson was a free. we need the glazers out.
Rio what about saying “Ten Hag’s at the wheel”  🤣😂 Man Utd are bottom of the league 🤣 They have spent more money in the past 10 years than any other team except Man City. Man U are a joke. 😂🥳🤣
Pogba laughing is head off in his Italian mansion
Bruno was the one who carried the team when Ole signed him.  He is still a quality player.  Others around him have dragged him down.
it's because they don't care, Rio. They can still take out their dividends so it doesn't matter to them.
I said it when Ten Hag came in, if he keeps Maguire as Captain and keeps him in the side, that instantly demonstrates he's absolutely clueless. Either that or there's some agreement with the board that the likes of Maguire and Rashford have to play no matter how awful they perform. It makes absolutely no sense that these league 1 level footballers continue to start for United.
I thought RIo was a West Ham fan 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rio has no Morals... Ask hes ex
Ten Hag has been terrible so far.  2 appalling league defeats. 4 months chasing de Jong, an over priced, over paid player.  50 million spent on a 5' 9" center half.  Ten Hag has kept on selecting McFred, MaGuire, Bruno, Rashford, Shaw, Dallot and the appalling Sancho.  Drop them ALL! Sell them ALL! In the first game of 2007 Sir Alex started the players from the class of 92.  United lost 1 v 4.  He kept with youth and United won the league that season. Ten Hag must drop McFred, MaGuire, Bruno, Rashford Shaw, Dallot and the appalling Sancho.   Ten Hag must start at home to Liverpool; Verane, Van De Beek, Garnacho, Iqbal, Savage, Hanibal and Malacia.  If Ten Hag keeps selecting the same failed players his life support will be turned off very soon.  Starting the same players against Liverpool will result in a big defeat. Dropping 7 of yesterdays starters and selecting young players may result in a win and certainly will help Ten Hag develop his own team quickly.
Ole at the wheel 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 give him that contract
Rebuilding is a slow process.Start playing some of the youth.Believe in Ten Haag
Pity for ten hag is limited ,if we can know he wont be back why didnt he regardless of what the board promised him because the managers history is there
These kants need to be sacked, they've been hiding for years now. They are absolutely trash, no exuces, no coaching can do anything with these players, 3 players deserve starting 11 and even then it's questionable, the rest wouldn't even start them in the carbao cup
Maybe the Glazers are man city fans
Even 2000 roy keane is better than mcfred
i wish we sold the club to boehly while he was still available, because if this aint clear that the glazers dont give flying F's then what is, are they waiting for us to be a relegation battling club. We are no longer a top 4 club never mind one of the best in the world. The glazers have used the club as a piggy bank for long enough, our stadium F'd, sporting director none existant, transfer policy F'd, we are a middling club now and have been leap frogged by the likes of west ham, totenham, arsenal, leicster. last 10 years have been an absolute nightmare with these guys. ITS JUST TOO MUCH TO TAKE NOW! even de gea is taking ownership saying its his faultz, is it F its the decision makers constantly making the wrong decisions. so many players goin on a free! signing players with high age for no reason and they dont fit the team. We are beyond a joke! now even the bottom sides have figured us out and pressing the living shizzle out of us because we cant hande it. I JUST CANT BARE TO SEE THIS ANYMORE. Madness, sorry for the rant
United will be fighting relegation
We are blessed to see the decline of United... love to see it :)
The time has come drop most of the first team players and play the bench and the youth it worked in pre season screw these drama queens and divas give a chance to the players that want it !!
Should’ve never sacked Jose M
Busby and Ferguson = Man United. They are not like Liverpool, who achieved their greatness over time and over many managers.  Liverpool is, and always has been, “A Family”; A far greater club than United!    The only way back for United, is for them to poach Pep Gaurdiola.
That’s the price you pay of hating on Mourinho, he was the only manager could turn things around and was the only one who got Man U some titles after SAF , but Man U sacked him just for saying the obvious
How you surprised? Ralf told us this and y'all wanted to silence him. No one wanted to hear the truth but you see it now
Wonderful isn't it
CAN WE JUST THROW MONEY AT VAN DER SAR. also, does anyone know why you cant just sack a football player?
Houssem Auoar about to sign for Forest. Guy walks into our team.
When you look at our next 5 games I think Ten Hag is fucked……home to Liverpool and Arsenal and away (where we are on a 7 game losing streak) to Southampton, Leicester and Palace. I wouldn’t even be shocked if we lost all of them and if we did Ten Hag would be fired whether it’s his fault or not.
One player won't be able to change this team in it's current form, even if they signed Messi/Mbappé, it wouldn't make a difference.
I say this in a slow and calm voice..  I think its time people realise man utd arnt a top tier club anymore and they never will be
They've never been relegated under the Glazers... Turning a profit... no debt... in the PL...  Fink you is what you should be saying! If you don't like it, you should buy the club 😆 Ten Hag wants some players he should buy them himself 🤣😂
Simple. Change that Line up. Have B.Williams RB, Bailly, Varane CB, Malacia LB, Sancho, Van De Beek, Zidane Iqbal and Ganarcho classic 4 midfielders and Ronaldo and Elanga as 2 CF.. This will be a massive change and mark my words a new start.. We can get a draw with Liverpool with this team.
I don't see the problem. Glaziers have spent £1b on players, brought in proven managers like mourinho and van gaal. Won everything in club football etc. I didn't see Rio complaining when he was taking the glaziers money. If he's not happy he can round his money up with the other fans and buy the club.
Keep blaming the glazers who have spent more than most.. yous deserve this 🤣
United are the Premier League’s whipping boys
Rio thinks he’s a much bigger United legend than he is. Very lucky he had vidic beside him for so long
This was coming TBH,it’s going to get worst.A long hard season ahead
This Rio pagan was spouting off last season about how Ralf Ragnick was wrong to expose the state of the club..look at us now
Clueless FC
Rio helped to enable the glazers now he acts like he’s shocked
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
£60.000.000 for rashford is more than what’s he’s worth were asking £120.000.000 for someone that bad when£51 .000.000 buys Haaland we’re getting relegated
Someone to explain to me how we can play shitty football at first half and in the second half is a different story, its something players have decided to do
I almost crashed the car 3 times and I was in the passenger seat 😂😂😂😂😂
Wow I’m impressed
Am a man u  fan, have been for years. This is embarassin. The fact everyone are blamin the glazers is stupid, we have  had the money, it all comes down to recruitment. Let this sink in, we paid 80 million plus for Maguire... Just to compete with van dijk and lfc, that's just one example. De gea, great shot stopper but he makes mistakes all the time.. shmichael, van de sar and we settled for this keeper, he wanted to leave not long ago.. let's get real and stop puttin the blame at the owners, Ronaldo is on 20 million a year at man utd, more then the entire Brentford squad.. the blame is with the recruitment and where the money is spent.  We have no god given right to be winnin stuff, why are we so privelaged.. we had over a billion and a tenth went on Harry Maguire..
But why is Ten picking the same failure team of last year?
The new signings thing doesn't really make sense though. Apart from de Jong we've not been linked with any top players.
THEY SACKED RANGNICK BECAUSE HE SAID THE TRUTH. THIS CLUB IS A JOKE.
we should play varane and baily as cb and lisandro martinez as a number 6
The Glazers inherited United and their money, so would you expect them to know about building a successful business.
We are not a big club not even a football club..we are just the brand from the past
What an absolute clown. Manchester United have no god given right to be successful anymore. Why don't the fans get together and buy the club then? All the money generated doesn't belong to Manchester United it belongs to the owners its their business.   I'm just applying the same argument he had when it came to NUFC. 🤣 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Will always say the debt paid for the backing of the super league.same Bank got paid a billion in interest.
Ten Haag is not going to last. 100%.
Feel Ten Hag needs to throw caution to the wind and field some of the youngsters coming through, Garner is one of them, heard Robbie Savage's son is pretty decent, blood them through now because Ten Hag can't trust the current crop of players, and he has to strip Maguire from the captaincy the mind boggles while he has stuck with him - his biggest mistake so far
Maguire has to go. Make an example of him. The 'captain'. Constantly slowing play down. How many touches does he need? Cannot play on the half way line.  This guy is suppose to bring assurance to his back line. He can't even bring assurance to himself. Mistake after mistake.   Don't get me wrong he's not the only one. But he's not fit to wear the shirt let alone the armband. It would be a huge statement of intent to take the arm band off him and sell him. One I'd love to see.
Subbed.    Sorry ATV, I’ve found a new loser stream.  :D
All spot on
Beyond taken the piss , Enough is Enough,
Didn't Rio stick up for the Glazers recently?
I like ETH but when you kept Maguire as the captain, you're basically digging your own grave. Keep playing Maguire, Shaw, McTominay, Fred, Bruno and Rashford, and you'll be gone way before x'mas.
Funniest thing about the super league is united wouldn’t get an invite now
Hurts to see Ronaldo like that at his final years. This club isn't serious. Just shut down club for 2 3 years and start from zero with proper planning and with new ownership. Sack all of these overpaid players
what Manchester United needs is Milinković-Savić not Frenkie  De Jong he is better by far than the Dutch De Jong is not playing continuously do not repeat the fault by buying Varane do not bring footballers their club don't need them anymore
Here you are the big man Rio Ferdinand. After hit Ralf Rangnick for exposing the rotten Board and now you ask "Where is the Board". You are such a prat man. You and your mate should have supported Rangnick.
I'm 100% convinced the scarecrow from batman has sprayed fear gas on these players. Absolutely shocking.
I hope the Glazers stay as long as possible and keep taking millions out of the club.
Teams up against Man U this season will smell blood in the water!
It was obvious that 5/6 high quality players needed to arrive in the summer. It was also obvious this was never gonna happen. #glazersout
Finally at the end he blames the player's.
THE TRUTH IS , THE PLAYERS INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH ! BRUNO FERNANDEZ IS NO BETTER THAN FRED OR McTOMINAY ... THE PLAYERS ARE OVERATED !
You'll win nothing with kids, really, proven we did give them a go !!!!!@
Wasnt Ronaldo right about being furious about the summer transfer window???????!! You should point that to all media beggars who were attacking ronaldo!
The problem is these lot didn’t acquire United and don’t care about it, they just got handed it when their dad died. End of story. Need to get them out.
Let’s just boycott all the next 3 games .I swear these guys will learn in a minute.
Hi prophet Rangnick
Could they get relegated?
The powers that be at Deadited are telling the manager regardless of who that is, he must pick certain players, there lies the problem. Maguire, McTominy, Rashford, Shaw, Bruno Out, Out OUT!!
I am making a bid to buy United
Could be bottom of the league after gameweel3
Rio, you love the club as much as we do it more we do. How about calling the players out to be dropped and supporting the move for Glazers out. Talk won't fix this. I know it'll be hard but it's better than this. Thank you
Banter fc
I called it
You better listen to Ragnick. All this player are going to deceive your career as a coach. I think Manchester United need total reformation of all the players they're all rubbish and deceivers
My friends laughed at me last season when I said we could be relegated next season,well guess what we are 💯in a relegation battle because of these weak minded players we have.
Same issue under mourinho and the board didn't back him.  Look what happened.  I have no doubt that mourinho would have created a winning team at united, no doubts, but he wasn't backed.  Upstairs backed the superstar players with the shitty attitudes instead of the manager.  They cannot do the same now.  Ten Hag should be the last person out the door, all those players will need to go first
The club is broke stop expecting signings
Would of started verane and balliey
Brentford done it again last session it was Arsenal now it’s the bottom of the pits team United or disunited.
Love how Rio still respect Mr Gill, love that. We brilliant money men over the last ten years, but not had a club about football. They didn’t know or realise that football is there bread and butter. We need a top football director. ASAP. Then let them build the infrastructure. That will take time. Investment on the pitch, clear out the deadwood, even if that paying them off.  As fans we have to except we not be complete in at the top for a few years, but it need knocking down and starting again.   The big problem is the glazers, even if they sold us, it would cost £4-5 billion, £500 million to pay the debt off, maybe another £500 million to fix us on the pitch. Well over a billion to redevelop old Trafford and carington, plus more to fix our women team  So we talking about 8 billion.  I know we could solve the redevelopment of old Trafford and carington, by using sponsorship.
motion of no confidence
Ten Hag Out!!!
perhaps these players should just do drugs then skip the tests after games Rio?
Has anyone seen or heard of the shopping centres that the glaziers own in America? If you look into it.. they run them into the ground. They do not keep them up to date or we'll kept. Just squeeze them for as much money as they can for as long as they can until they do not resemble what they once were.
Players who don't deserve MU  Maguire Luke saw Fred Scott Bruno Rashford Sancho Elanga
I beg to everybody plz don't spend a single penny on man. united #shameonglazzers #glazzersout. Let them leave n save our club
LET'S START WITH CHANGING THE OWNERSHIP OF THE CLUB!!!!!
Rio why don't all the fans club together and buy the glazers out? That's what you told us toon fans! Mug
Nonsense podcast. Both are reluctant to point the finger at the Manager. He played a huge role in that defeat. Wrong team, no reaction, dodgy subs, clueless. He’s out of his depth. And now we’ve got Rio just parroting what Gary Neville says about the Glazers . It’s the wrong message entirely!
Arsenal owners communicated when we finished 8th twice, glazers need to do that same
Man utd too ocupied by their own mistakes. They need to do a listing for their mistakes and then solve them. One by one. Thats all we do in live. And I think thats what liverpool doing in Klopps era.
It’s really a beautiful thing to see you lot finally realising you’re finished hahaha
We are finished as a football club unless the glazers sell up they are a virus draining our club the stadium needs works training facilities need updating
Never seen Rio so down. This club is in serious trouble.
He'll walk and we'll get Poch and we'll have to call him Eric Ten Games. IM NOT HERE FOR THIS.
£1.5 billion on players in the last 10 years, more than any other european club
Do ya think Ten Hag’s mission was given to him to turn these players around first? Rather than back him in the market?
Why doesn’t Ten Hag write the season off and put the youngsters in
Do we have to blame the Glazers only? Didn't  previous coaches order for the recruitment of these players? What happened that they now play like a useless bunch of overpaid underperformers. There us an underlying reason.  First is who the captain is, second is the Portuguese factor and thirdly, thise who want to leave the club and are intentionally destriying the club so they can be transferred for less. Management should wake up from their slumber. We have thirty + registered players, why not give the youthful ones a try?
The glazers just dont care about this club.
All big spent signing   Mata Gone Di Maria Gone Pogba Gone Depay Gone Lukaku Gone
A billion spent not one good buy…..Maybe Bruno
Please dont come to the games just empty the stadium
Half of these player are not talented enough demand they all lack real pace
Mourinho’s comment that taking Utd to 2nd being his best ever result has really stood the test of time
GLAZER OUT
Whats Wrong?
I’ve said amongst friends United is a money washing operation
Kinda interesting to hear about how David Gill got involved. Also would be cool to know what the reaction to the start of the 07/08 season was behind the scenes... Because we only got 2 points from the 3 first games
The answer is Paul Mitchell and the glazers need to go
You say ten hag hasn’t been backed but he’s already spent 90 million. United fans are delusional and are in serious trouble. Team is a complete joke and they have no players to save this team. Bring any manager and it will be the same outcome. It’s got nothing to do with the owners. It’s down to these players who are all being exposed. Pathetic excuse for united supporters to put blame on the owners it’s hilarious
Bad renewals, keeping bad players to long. Overpaying and bot buying what manager want as first choice also vanity signings to prop shirts sells only then not reinvest. Glazer do not invest they buy at high and drain dry. We had chances to sign a good technical director and nothing. We fired most of our scouting when a new manager was coming in weird club management. Hire the people that worked in club with the same dude that been failing in Ed Woodward. To keep running it into financial death so they can cash out. They own the stadium and everything else. These leeches will drain us dry. They know nothing off football. I can’t go at ten hag he took job where structurally we are fucked to be honest.
Love it how these deluded mancs blame the owners after the players play rubbish. Hahahaha
🎻🎻🎻
Not a man u fan. but yesterday stood in a prem club shop at a ground buying a new shirt, there were thousands of people spending hundreds of pounds on named shirts. If that was united there would be a host of people asking for a refund. Unfortunately the owners have made this relationship a one way process
Become a laughing stock? Man United have been a laughing stock since 2015 at least.
7:28 here we again 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾 just stop it !! Already!! Bunch of kids always complaining about the owners
Hahahahhaaha!!! 😂😂😂😂
GLORY GLORY MANUTD 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ten hag is not doing himself any favours with his teams selections, starting Shaw, fred, maguire,
But Rio, you said that all an owner needs to do to be good is make a profit!  Shouldn't the Man United fans 'just put their hands in their pockets and buy the club if they don't like the owners'?
"I can't even banter Arsenal fans anymore..."  Rio, love ya but you haven't been able to for a year now
We will be bottom of the league after 3 games with no points and a - 10 goal difference.
I've been saying we will be in a relegation fight since May. The Glazers are slowly sucking the life out of United.
They own the club u don't so stop your crying they can do whatever they want either stay happy with this or support anyother club or leave football
Overpaid players nobody wants because nobody else would meet their wage demands. This squad was starting to creak before Fergie left and now we've ended up with a mish mash of players assembled by 4 managers and an interim manager.
The incredulity at the end misses the point so badly. They’re not over here because they can still draw their money and the fans will still go. They will be able to keep milking United for years. It will take years for that to dry up. United would need to relegated or be a lower table team for 10 years before people will stop propping the glazers up with their support and cash.   For all these reasons it’s not a normal business. It’s not a truly public company or a business that can fail if performance declines.   It’s one of the biggest cons of the century how they bought that club and until they’re forced out it’s not going to change.
hahahaha cry baby hey show us the same reaction us did when your signing pendo
The club will never see real success under these current owners that's a proven fact ,how many times god sake it can't be the managers we had and have good managers the players have been giving different ways to play in last few years and these current players are heartless unenthusiastic lazy brainless the list goes on ,pathetic
It's just shamefull to say that United need to spend more money to fix this problem. United allready have a squad worth around 8 times, Brentfords squad. Still Brentford outclass them. Furthermore United just spent 5-6 months with Ralph Rangnik the proffessor of the pressplay style, but they still can't do even that. United become useless to press opponets to mistakes, and win the ball in good counterpositions. Coaches are not to blame if the players refuse to learn something new. The way things have been the last few years, it's predestined that Teen Hag also going to fail. The only way to solve this, is to get rid of every player that doesnt back the coach, and start new.
hello Rio, and steve, i agree if a player makes it clear he does not want to play for any team then forget him period, brentford bashing well, maguire should be dropped,dalot fred, de gae, rashford too, even the kids would of done a better job, one other thing i would change is no more press conferences, stop telling everyone what you want what your doing your plans and who you intend to try and buy, just shut the fk up, fergy never told anyone who he wanted to buy he just did it, ten hag has not learnt yet how to avoid press,
So many players are not good enough for this club  . Dalot , Fred, maguire, shaw , lindelof , mctominay , rashford , martial , Fernandes ,  van de beek , wan bissaka and there is more we need a MASSIVE clear out only problem is who would sign them players becasue I am free and ready to drive any of them to the airport
We need to break d bank and get Conor gallagher and Declan rice,
United are not a big club any more, its hard to hear but its a fact.
Liverpool next.....could be double figures...maguire will get absolutely destroyed!!!
What the hell happened to Bruno Fernandes? In his first 18 months he was creating and scoring goals..he carried us.Ole would not give him any rest and slowly he has become a non creator of chances always complaining to the ref.Bruno was not coached by Ole or Ole’s staff.Maybe, Ten Hag can recover this situation.
If Rio is unhappy with the owners, maybe he should take his own advice to the newcastle fans and just buy the club?
Bantchester united
Pulis and big Sam would play youth and not play Ronaldo and Maguire that's how u win.
I'm depressed literally... This is getting too much. Liverpool were never this bad. They had Stevie G. Na we are useless. This is a shambles
The Glazers are leeches....attach themselves to something good and suck the life and goodness out of it, when it's dead they move on to the next one!
Glazers have spent 1 billion!!!! They have backed everyone thats been in charge. Utd only attract wannabes, thats your problem
Haha . A joke and a trash team. Gitgud
Hahahahahahahah Rio deserves this. Him and the man u fans should put their hands into there own pockets and buy players or the club with it. He expected Newcastle fans to do it under Ashley so this absolute idiot should be expected to do it
hahaha this is hilarious. Rio surely you should be thanking the Glazers? Isnt that what you told Newcastle fans?
We are in FREFALL
Rio's only in it for the banter and for the social media. That's the extent of the man.
imagine ronaldo getting relgegated lol am not even angry anymore am passed that am just laughing now
Unless Maguire, Rashford, Bruno and Shaw is benched, every weekend we'll have the same Result. Ten Hag is at fault as well. His team selection is F****g POOR.
Did Rio blame the loss on the players not taking the knee ?
Imagine not cringing every time Rio Ferdinand opens his stupid wide mouth 😂😂
Am I being paranoid or does Rio sound and look uneasy when The Glazers are being discussed?
Seriously we could do with being relegated. That way we’d get rid of the whole squad and the glazers. Might be the best solution.
The Glazers got rid of Rangnick because he went public with the truth, he wasn't prepared to cover up the inadequacies in the club and risk his reputation...........good on him I say.
🤪
Sir Alex Sir Alex..  like Javier Hernandez said he's gone years ago get over it.
It's the Glazer’s club and they’re doing what they want to do. Whether you like it or not, they’re the ones that are putting the money up and they’re doing what they think is right for the club.
"Glazers where are you?"  Counting our money!
Please don't change UTD. Its karma TBH.
The beginning of the ending Unless the glazers r out they don't care about football they care about money only they sign players based on the bond not talent
had brentford to win 3.0  gutted
Ragnick out you say??? Lmao
Just want this nightmare to end 😓😡
I’m no conspiracist but surely someone higher up is demanding Maguire start & captain ever game due to not being seen as a failure of a signing. He doesn’t suit ETH system and is somehow benching Varane
Man United need to get rid of there players and the owners and transfer policy
I think Man U fans should stop complaining.   I dont have any business dealings with the glazers so my opinions have nothing to do with that.  The glazers spent over 1.3 billion over the last 10 years...thank you that should be.  They got in Moyes, Mourinho, Ten Hag, Van Gaal....you should be thanking them cos, by rights youre lucky to have had those managers.  Man U ate gonna become a yo-yo club because the glazers dont want to incest anymore. Theyve been there, done that and they want to move on whats the problem?  The fans think they need to soend money on new players well why should they spend millions and millions of pounds, say 50 mil on Anthony, 60 mil on De Jong and they get injured, that 100 mil down the drain.  Maybe the fans shoukd all pitch in and buy the club. Im sure 5 billion quid could be crowd funded but the working class of manchester.  All these opinions are Rios by the way, not mine. My club had shite owners in the form of mike ashley for years and this was Rios arguments, defending Ashley. I feel for the united fans i really do. You deserve a better owner. But to hear Rio vo plai ing is an utter piss take.
We are a shambles of a club. The Rabiot deal shows how embarrassing we are. Acting likes he’s a huge signing, Murtagh flying out to Turin to meet with his mother over a week after agreeing a free. Wtf are we doing? Other teams take this long to complete a transfer for their marquee signing, not a €15m player that the club hes at now want him gone
Rio watching TV while driving? Then realised what he said, and said he was in passenger seat... ok rio
Train Wreck FC !!!!!!!!!!!  it's Disgusting Watching this Awful Team !!!!!!!!!🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨👀👀👀👀👀
You Man United Fans make me LAUGH, everytime the on field football doesn't suit you " what do you do you blame the owners,,, 1 Billion is a massive amount of money to spend to make a team worse. Rio + other X players don't know what they are talking about,  Tottenham manager Conte was yours but nearly all the X players said Conte doesn't suit our club LOL, he would have put a firework up your players Lazy players who Run sprint tackle the less in the entire Premier league,  1 last thing stop living in the past the Premier league is Nothing like when Alex Ferguson was in charge " times have moved on. You also have a problem with Staff Recruitment " jobs for the x players just isn't the correct method because they are All Yes men earning Big money for a Mediocre return.
I was at Salford City Crewe yesterday and I have watched a lot of them under Neil Wood former United 23s boss. There are things I have seen him doing that look a bit Olé- but I actually think the 3-4-3 he is deploying is what I expected from ETH. The shape is dynamic put they press high, the outside CB’s underlap and overlap the fullbacks, positionally dictated by two very good CM’s. I think there is something in that for United, managing at the ‘youth’ type level culturally and bringing players through etc is that maybe missing from United’s bench?
But still they are getting paid extortionate wages every week.
How Slabhead is still captain 🤣🤣🤣
The players should get paid for performance. But then most of them would be homeless so
Our club has a virus. The owners and the players. These players are broken Rashford, Bruno, Shaw DeGea Fred McTominay Dalot Maguire all broken
Maybe the protest should take place in Tampa on their patch around their peers
I feel for Ten hag and CR7 that's it no one else because no one deserve any respect in this club. This players make any legend player or legend manager as a shit....I like to see all the players sit on the bench get young blood even if we loose no one will point as it is a young team like arsenal.....atleast remove Maguire, Bruno, rashford and mactominay for 3 matches and play young blood...
Erik ten Hag should realise that building a team starts from the young ones. He should play the youth and build his team from there
First thing a good manager would do is get rid of de gea and brought in koulibaly
Well if you don't like the owners, then buy the club yourselves", right Rio?
Because ManU is not struggling FINANCIALLY thats all that matters to those Yankees
The culture  of Man United is now about what i can get not what i can give. It was established by the Glazers who are in the club because they can borrow to get access and now take out as much money as they can with no cost to themselves. Do you think they care about anything other than the financial benefits? They will only  leave when someone pays them enough for them to leave and not before. Until then don't expect to see them leading a positive change.
please drop Maguire from 1st eleven n appoint another player to become captain like ronaldo.. character n leadership is very important.also drop players who not perform like sancho n Rashford,shaw, dalot,fred,tomminay  n bruno from starter 11...
I fear for ETH... embarrassing... the culture everything is wrong. Lost for words tbh.
These babies need to watch a game of Australian Rules football to see what toughness and determination means. They are a bunch of gutless cowards.
Start the YOUTH, why are we putting Maguire, Rashford on the pitch? empty shirts, put the youngsters on a let them play.
If I was Ronaldo I would leave.  I rather have players that weren't a lot of money.  If they could get lesser players that work and play gritty is what is needed.  Glazers should probably sell.  Need better personal in scouting players to buy...
How can you feel sorry for the players? That's like feeling sorry for the Star Wars writers who made the franchise sh*t.
To make this team better, we have to go even lower than where we are now, Glaziers must go and get in a CEO who lives football, get rid of 75% of these players - Rashford, Maquire, Dalot, Fred, McTominay, Shaw + more need SACKING, bring in our up and coming young players and add world class players as we go along, Drop down to the Championship if need be and re build
#GlazersOut
Use the youth players and lets these mercenaries sit on the sideline for a few weeks
Liverpool 12 - Manchester United 0
United need to bring in the right personnel once again they are wasting money on positions that don't need improving, a CDM has been needed since matic's form dropped off since ten haag wants to play a 443, without that the team is never gonna work it's so obvious that i can't believe the scouts are still getting paid.
I love how sancho never gets talked about, 75m for 3 goals 3 assists on 31 games, absolute liberty 🗽
This is not the Manchester United that I once knew...🤣🤣🤣..one decent manager in your history has skewed your opinion..nothing but a cup team before ferguson.
Tbh we can recover jus need to believe n play physical.
All of these social media Outlets say Man United are not a top club anymore... Get out of Sir Alex fergusson era ... And expect them to win like city or liverpool week in week out..
The Glazers have destroyed the club. It’s heartbreaking. I just want them to sell.
Fuxxk off ETH, see how many mistakes you made in past two games?  Very chaos arrangement at midfield & forward position. Uses youth players instead Must drop list, OUT!! (No more potential,  No mentality, power, energy, capabilities)  1. Martial 2. Rashford 3. Shaw 4. Fred 5. Chong 6. Mctamminary 7. Tuanzebe 8. Bailey 9. Brandon William 10. Wan-bissaka  Strong Recommended to sell  11. Sancho 12. Bruno 13. De Gea  Recommend to nurture youth stars 1. Garnacho (next CR7) 2. Ethan Galbraith (potential to next Scholes)  3. Ethan laird 4. McNeill 5. Hannibal 6. Greenwood 7. James garner 8. Amod 9. Others ( ManU too many very talent youth players)
Rio,come out of retirement  pls,help is needed
The question I'm asking is, if we're taking a beating from bottom- and midtable-loving teams, what then would happen to us when we play the league's so called big boys? We'll get absolutely hammered!
Stop buying their sponsored products...if sponsors dip ,the glazers will dip.
Why do we keep persisting with these players , give the kids a go , they will at least give there all  !!
rahsford sancho totally useless fred shaw should never start ever de gea should be sold asap
As a UTD fan, I pray we get relegated for the Glazers to F### off
Not single player grew in value, even bruno has dipped in form since fans came back to stadium
I hope with Rio coming out like this would make other ex players do the same to kick out the Glazers and useless players. Nothing to do with managers. Even Ragnick for that matter
Bring in Big Sam for the relegation battle!!!
Stick to your fashion and posing Rio , your just repeating the same sh*te very poorly …
Right now your just doing this for views and money. U don’t care about the club. U and the rest of the ex players are as bad as each other spreading a negative msg all the time. Neville is the worst . That bad I Mute the whole game Cus of him,
This is normal now getting hammered every game its relagation this season because these players have no balls and roll over and die after 10 minutes 😳   it's not a surprise 🙄 this is the level that the club are at   and if you are honest the football is terrible rubbish the attitude is awful and the owner are useless swines
Big Sam would never let that happen. He is underrated
Ralf said open heart surgery needed and 10 players and then they terminated his contract it says it all were rotten from top to bottom
But the business is going well. It is the football that isn't.
There isn't much difference between the idea of the Super league and how our precious EPL was  created, both were money moves for the  bigger team. Check you facts before you slander other teams
Nottingham Forest have spent more than Manchester United this summer. 👎
Their decision & policy (owner & board) is the reason why Man Utd getting worse in the last 10 season.  Sign not the right players, sign the overpriced players too. And also give some of them very big salary which is not deserved.  The whole Man Utd has to be CHANGE.  That just my opinion
I love the way Rio still says "our football club".  He is a star and a legend.
The Glazers don't care! Why do you think they bought United that wasn't on their doorstep. They are unscrupulous terrible businessmen  that were getting to much heat for their antics in the US.
glaziers wont bother man united is a part of there portfolio  they pick a team to run the club  . take mansour at city he has been once to city but he picks the best people to run the club  take levy he has been to spurs everday  for 40 years   and they have won zero
How do you feel sorry for Ten Haag? He came in banging on about fresh ideas, style of play etc. and the first thing he does is take the proven worst player in the squad (Maguire) and make him Captain again. No wonder Ronaldo wanted to leave not long after..there must be contracts in place that dictate playing time or something, because there is no way that any footballing person could see Maguire and the majority of the other players in the squad and think ‘these are man united caliber’ …so why not play Varane and Bailly?! Why not play Garner, Garnacho etc.. 2 matches in and TH looks a bluffer.
🤣🤣🤣 as a City fan of 30+ years this is a joy to see. United and their fans have had this coming for a long long time!
It's not a spending problem.  The problem is that there are no knowledgable people in relevant positions. Rangnick was a chance,  but players played against him,  because they knew many would have to leave etc.
Maguire cant handle this team. It all started when he took over this team.
Barsa finished 2nd and bought in 6 top players. This interview is almost the same as that ralf a few months ago. The players will fire more coaches in their utd career then the trophies the win. Get rid of the mf. Ffs
Ten Hag had conversations with Ralf. Why did we throw away Ralf’s services ?
Very simple fix, get rid of: Maguire, Shaw, Fred, McTominay, Bailey, and Fernandes. Acquire players based on top 10% of objective evidence of results w. respect to age.
I wish the people that bought Newcastle bought United 😢Rest in Peace Manchester United. we're finished.
Haha. Just remember all the back you gave Mike Ashley because he was the only mug to sell your five merchandise. Time to get your hands in your pockets. Karma
It's not a team!  Toxic dressing room full of overpaid egos. When Ronaldo heard Maguire is gonna be captain this season he decided to leave. Can't blame him.  How they act on the transfer market I thought was the biggest joke and  showed incompetence.  Got topped by their squad.  Ten Hag obviously couldn't form a team out if these players so far.  And I doubt he can.
RIO is aprt of the problem; they keep critizing ebry manager except Ole ; all these ex-Utd players are still living in the past
The entire team needs a damn 50-70% paycut ffs
Get rid of Maguire,shaw,fred,mctominay,bissaka..rashford needs motivation..shuffle dea gea with heaton..ralf rangnick sacked for his honesty..lastly Glazers out! They never understand about football passion & culture..
It’s so weird watching rio speak like this …… because when it was Ralph telling us this same thing he was the first person to condemn the guy and out him and shield the recruitment and the back office people.  What a whole load of rubbish.
Look on the bright side Rio, keep this up and you may get a top 5 finish in the Championship next year, hahahahaha, bloody hilarious. Could not happen to a better bunch of low life scum
1st goal: De Gea's fault (happens occasionally), 2nd goal: De Gea and Fred/Bruno/Shaw/Dalot's fault (provide another passing option when they're being pressed 3v3 and trying to play out), 3rd goal:  Rashford's fault (he leaves Mee free after the corner comes in initially, who then scores when it's 2v1 against Martinez), 4th goal: Maguire and Shaw for being slow and unaware of Toney & Mbuemo running in behind them. No one in that team looked like they knew how to pass the ball, and when we got forward it looked like we didn't know how to create chances or dribble 1v1 to create overloads and space for attackers
Let Rio talk greedy always sucking up air time lives the sound of his own voice
Number of points.   1. De Gea was our best player last season with a number 2 chomping at the bit for the starting spot. No competition this season so complacency will inevitably set in.  2. Martinez is not a CB. He is perfect to play as a CDM. Aggressive, good tackler, confident on the ball and would be a massive upgrade on Fred.  3. Maguire is not a captain and is not a MUFC player no quality on the ball. Pau Torres should have been a replacement in the door on the last day of last season. 5. There of midfielders out there can help us improve, Tielmans, -Savic - Carlos soler- Sandro Tonali- Bennacer  the list could go on.  6. Glazers need to go. They should never have been allowed to buy the club on a credit card. Cash rich individuals and companies should be. No debt should be saddled to the club being bought!    The only way is up. GGMU Glaziers out!
Past glory FC 🤣😂
What complete tripe Rio and Neville talk, you don't need the owners when you are winning just when you're losing. When do the manager and players become responsible ? Also if Alex Ferguson became manager in this era he would have been sacked after 2 seasons, there is not one top European club today that would give a manager 6 seasons to win a title.
It amazes me how low the standards of this club have dropped! Maguire can't hold a candle to Rio or Vidic! And that is our captain huh. Shaw not giving it his all and Bruno still playing!? Unleash Van De Beek already!
intervention is simply not the neoliberal way
The glazer's family don't even put their own money into the club instead taking money out of the club and for transfer strategy there is none plus the fact its the money the club generated that goes towards the transfer window that's abysmal
How do you have man utd in 4th ahead of chelsea and arsenal bruv😭
Ten Hag didn't know much about EPL.. Didn't realize he was in a bigger league.. Spending money for Martinez.. So silly he can not handle EPL rough and physical pressing.. Ten Hag wrong starting line up.. And wrong strategies
Man Utd fans should be grateful for Glazers Rio! Just as you said to Newcastle fans about Mike Ashley
2 words THE GLAZERS
Can't fall any further. Man u are bottom of the league..
You have a toxic dressing room led by Bruno and CR7 the new manager backed down to CR7 and played him which undermined his authority, player power is what the problem is and de Beek told De Yong don’t come here bro go to Chelsea.
Why don’t you guys talk about how Ralf was undermined. Rio stopped supporting Ralf now look where we are, we needed him now more than ever . he was right about the open heart surgery and us needing 10 players. Talk about that.
It’s not even the money though. The bad business of before means utd have to spend silly money to sign anyone and have to pay extortionate wages. Not every signing will work and then you can’t shift them. You’re in a mess. Better rebuilding the stadium and training ground and buying young and hungry. Won’t do anything chasing stars
Speaking of Usain Bolt ⚡ ... Hahahaha 🤣 he's probably depressed
Glazers need to sell up, simple as that, Sell up take the money and go invest it for better less stress returns else where
As an American, it’s not that the glazers don’t have the “desire”… they don’t have UNDERSTANDING! They don’t get it lads, they genuinely think this is like American sports, they will never understand how much it matters.
Hey Ste , What's good Rio? Can't believe I have to ask this. But what do you guys thinking of at least playing Aaron Wan Bissaka instead of dalot just for defensive security coz let's be honest dalot isn't great defensive and is decent going forward but at least wan bisakka brings absolute one on one and second ball wins. Would love to hear your comments on this
Some might say that Ralf has been vindicated.  The fact is Ralf won’t be feeling that. I sense he cared more about the club than any of the idiots in management or ownership.  He must be feeling just bewilderment like ALL OF US
Martinez is so small 😂😂😂😂😂
Everything is wrong at our beloved club. On and off the pitch. The mentality to begin with. Brentford players ran and ran, contrarily to our bunch of overpaid divas! Many of them think that they are now BIG because they play for United and probably believe they are no longer entitled to sweat. SHAME on you guys for letting the team, yourselves and all of us fans DOWN.
We're in so much trouble it's not even funny. The entire club, players included, need a rebuild. At the same time though can you imagine a team of younger players getting slated by fans week in and week out being successful? The club is in so much disarray no one even knows where to start. The Glazers have to go. They need to do some soul searching and really ask themselves if money is more important than us getting relegated. There going to go down as the worst owners in football history. It might happen this season but if we have another transfer window like this one we're almost guaranteed to be fighting for relegation. The most frustrating thing is we knew we needed a complete rebuild going into this season and the club have just delayed that by another year. You can't look at what's happened this summer and think yea Man U is rebuilding. Those penny pinching fucks wanted ETH to polish a turd instead of buying younger players for a rebuild. I really think when the rebuild begins we as fans have to be patient and supportive because no young team is going to succeed if they're under the current pressure. Somehow we also have to get players that talk to each other. I honestly believe that most our team don't like each other. You never see them talking on camera or smiling/laughing having a good time.
Their recruitment is on a different level to us. They don't get many things wrong. Rio on City,L,pool...Even if we knew that,it sent shivers down our spine, those words. How far we have fallen and behind, thanks to the Glazers and board.
I'm a wolves fan we let Conor coady go to Everton and we all thought it was mistake but can anyone actually say Maguire is the best defender for England if I was Garth Southgate I'd be starting max kilman and coady in the world cup
Rangnik was right. 10 players new players. Open heart surgery. Now we have good coach and he is exposing how bad this lot is. Can't play out from the back nor through the press. Liverpool lacking their lips.   I fear Ten Haag won't last long and that alot of these toxic players will still be around after he is gone.
I’m betting someone will hack the glazers emails and they they will be forced to resign.
Before Ronaldo came into our system we're very strong and wining matches 🤔🤔
Much respect goes to Legend. OLE🙌🙌🙌🙌Who takes us to champions league
The fall of Manchester United….
RAGNICK FOR DOF. No not having it, now united will be relegated
United Fans in Tampa need to apply pressure.
Miss Daniel James and Telles, gross injustice was done to them. Not given enough time to prove their worth in such a turbulent environment, replaced on the team sheet by two English players who are at best average.
The reason the Glazers don't care is because they don't invest their own money....it's simple, you care more for something when there's an element of risk attached to it....I hope this is a catalyst to get these leeches out of the club we all love.
If we just played the backline we suppose to play (Varane and Baily), put Martinez as a 6, put eriken in his actual position, add VDB (the player the manager made) to the midfield, it probably would have been better, it's everyone's fault in man u but something weird is going on at Man U with the selections and substitutions
The women are playing out of portable cabins!? I’m done with this club!
Literally, all rival fans told you this will happen one day. We told you a year or two ago. You did not want to listen. Bantering Arsenal for "the process", but overlooking your own huge problems. Now look... ;)
Coach u need to bench this players. Maguire Ronaldo Bruno Diot Shaw Rashford Sancho And bring young academy players with team spirit thank you.
Trashford is back in full effect, kid does nothing in final 3rd..nothing !
What if Utd play 442 once more?play with true wingers with ronaldo & marcus as 2 upfront.but finding those wingers is difficult these days.
Everyone blaming Glazers but to be honest every year money is made available and invested into so called World class players. Who is to be blamed?  Simple example is when Conte was available you guys choose Ole.  One Question I have is y don’t play martinez DM and varane CB.
Ralf was the whistleblower that you fans mocked and mugged off for him to eventually get sacked  That’s another guy I feel bad for, entitled fanbase ruined it for themselves
If it’s down to ability, these actual players won against Chelsea, Man City & even Liverpool in the past during Ole’s 1st full season…
If it’s down to ability, these actual players won against Chelsea, Man City & even Liverpool in the past during Ole’s 1st full season…
Honestly I love the downfall  But I feel so sorry for Erik man  The board have let him down  Where’s United’s scouting system? Why aren’t they bringing in players to fit Erik’s philosophy like Liverpool do for Klopp He wanted Brandt and Götze, the board said nope, we’re giving you Salah and Mane
Almost crashed the car 3 times in the passenger seat 💺!
Why you guys bringing Barcelona in this conversation when top 6 epl team was in it
Don't  defend Bruno... he is most overrated player in this league. Must sold with fred, scot, harry.
Remember how mad we were when we lost 5-0 to liverpool 😂 thinking that was rock bottom is laughable
Shudder to think what the outcome of the Liverpool game could be
#YNWA
Cmon Rio... Just do something man.. call Beckham and buy the fking thing.. this is not the way
Don't worry Rio as Keano said last season about arsenal, united are safe, they will not be relegated
Finally, Rio speaks the truth about the abilities of our squad!  they are not just good enough period!! Ragnick was absolutely spot on about the lot. #openheartsurgery required for the team. SHAMELESS FC.
Relegation or force the glazers to sell the team ASAP
Put Martinez in the middle of the park. can't hurt?
what a shameful bunch of dead legs who doesn't respect the badge we are done as a football club done!!!!
A 5ft 9 centre back? Really?
Can anyone call out the players? Effing Bruno Radford Sancho  Maguire  list goes on.
I want united to get relegated. Then the glazers will sell I think because of riots and loss of money
What did we expect from the bunch of players we have? It's practically the same team that was horrible to watch last season. I think it's gonna get much worse before it gets better. Feel sorry for the Erik. For now we are a joke of a club..
Rio saying that the recruitment has been bad at Man u since Alex Ferguson left. Di Maria, Alexis Sanchez, Pogba, Lukaku were at the best phase in their careers when they came to United. I remember Martial's goal against Liverpool. He was compared to Thierry Henry.  I also remember the billion pound manchester derby. It was 0-0. So fans and ex players/pundits criticized Luis Van Gaal. Then they chased Mourinho out because his style was too defensive. Any of you remember Valencia, Ashley Young? Only reason Ollie survived so long was these same ex players and pundits were supportive of him wanted to give him time. So the owners who don't know any better stuck with him so they could please the fans.  ETH is a coach not a manager. Mourinho and LVG were proper managers. ETH would need a complete overhaul of the squad. He can't with work with this squad. Ronaldo needs to go. He is not your long term solution. Maguire, Fred, Martial, even Bruno can all go if they don't see any future with Man u. EtH needs a barnd new Starting 11. Give him 18 months. If he wants arnautovic, give him Arnautovic. Don't let the fans and so called experts bully you into submission.
Has anyone heard Rio state clearly that the owners have to go? If so please link it here.
Glory Glory Man United. 🤣🤣. Get the popcorn out and enjoy. Drinks are on ice.. The downfall begins!
We are in Norwich territory  right now.
But they Players were considered good (in the main) once. De Gea is top class, Dalot might be marginal, Maguire was considered overpriced but good when signed, Martinez was considered a positive signing, Shaw was the best young English left back when signed, Mctominay, no comment, Erickson was a good signing, Sancho was considered a great signing, Fernandes was on fire when he arrived, Rashford was the a star not that long ago and and Ronaldo is world class. To say the players aren't good enough might be true, but the team consists of mostly players who were considered good signings.
Ronaldo & Eriksen were the only United players that seemed bothered by such an embarrassing performance. Rest just carried on without showing any kind of frustration... that ain't right!
I would say bench the "first team" and start the youngsters but I'm afraid for them now, what if they come in and are infected by this weak mentality curse we have running through our first team. There is no explanation for these players being as bad as they are, I cannot understand it.
How is it the owners’s fault is players do not run around on the pitch and give their all?
Opponent's don't need to play their best game, we gave them goals as a present, opponent knows that we play from the back without quality, just pressure them & they lost the ball like school kids
Rangnick was smart, knew the issue and quickly go.
Ronaldo saw this coming from miles away!!! That’s why he wants to leave! He knows this team and club, they don’t meet his ambition!
Imagine, Ole has this team in second in the league and he was sacked for it.
The players seen like don’t care and just let it be. They just talk but don’t show on the field like they care. The discipline and the tactics is being ignore what manager had told them.
Now I see why united didn’t go for conte.. the board would have to get off their jack ass to get players for him… they just want yes men at the helm
WTF is Fergie doing he's still there cashing in on his £2 million every year he needs to call it out. Don't rock the boat Fergie.  The business is not failing in Glazers heads they get their dividends if there's enough dividends it's successful.
These owners are American MBA types. They will allow the stadium to fall apart, and then build a new one with someone else's money. That's our system. As long as United  remains in the Premiership, they don't care. People keep buying tickets, watching on TV and streaming, buying merchandise...etc. They will leverage the clubs value for other investments that have no connection to football. They only care about business. Football is not important. Only money.
With this group of overhyped players and mcguire in captain I don't see UTD winning next 5-6 games.. Why that Slow train from 1800 that need charcaol to run is Captain that is beyond and i think Mcguire being captain is chosen by the board because he is 80 mil spending. Teng Haag would never choose him as captain. There is much more going behind the scenes. Ten haag didn't get the signing he wants. He is playing trasford, penandes, scooby doo, friday night fred, shaw, dalot, and slow rusty train.  There is definitly something going on....
@Jorginho  Naaah, its Pogba...Lingard ("sunny init")...Felleini, Lukaku...Sanchez...VAR...Ole...Jose...Zlatan...Lime green kit...pink boots... Herrera...Moise...Jones...Smalling...Ashley Young...Henderson...my Grandma... Woodward...DeJong...the Glassers...etc etc
what did I do to deserve this
Love it thst Manchester are struggling
Sorry for the players? Alcohol is very bad!
we must act. We need a leader.
Man City and Liverpool are in a different league Arsenal are back to the form and scoring goals Chelsea are backed by owners with top signing Tottenham transfer market was the best they had, they have the top manager and are real title contenders Here we are man utd where we are bottom of the league and have no vision, did not back the new manager. The squad is the same as the previous season nothing changed much. We are completely fucked up
It's going to be very hard to come back from this...this club is finished
Ten hag should stop playing Maguire please  some body speak to him please
I would've played Martinez in DM, Varane and Maguire CB, Malacia LB, Van De Beek and Eriksen ahead of Martinez in midfield.  The team desperately needs some resilience and strength in central midfield.
“I almost crashed the car three time and I was in the passenger seat.”  That about sums it up
MURDERER - they will suck out your blood 🩸. GAG (GO AWAY GLAZERS).   Did you just say no nutritionist for the youth?!  F this 😭
Ralf
ETH had Van De Sar and OVERMARS,  now he has Murtough & FLETCHER, EGO & NAIVETY convinced him he could work with Novices .Until we hire the best in class in recruitment etc we're going to suffer
It’s not there money 🤷🏼‍♂️. It’s joke that they can borrow money to buy the club and the club playing back for them
The sliding doors moment was last summer. Both Kane & Rice were available for the right price. That was the statement of intent required. Everyone got caught up in Ron returning home. It was short sighted. I doubt either players agent would even answer the phone today.
Just accept it Man Utd fans all over the World......... Man Utd ~ End of an Era. Please wait 35 years later to rise up again........
Team selection is practically impossible because, as Ralf said, almost the entire team needed changing.
Worst season start for mufc...
BYE BYE AGAIN... next ... LIVERPOOL...... 10-0?
54 seconds: don’t want to thumbs up the accuracy of the analysis of this DISASTER. My son asked me why I support United (not a local), HE FELL ASLEEP 😴 before I could explain this flagellation.   INDEFENSIBLE
We need to persevere. Rough times will come before success.
Sad thing is they need to persuade rabiot to come to united eventhough the 2 clubs already agreed on the fee.
We should go with 6 at back against liverpool to avoid double digit thrashing otherwise they will score 10-12 goals the way we blay
With so many players leaving and the worst league position in 30+ years the team needed a rebuild but the Glazer's set such a tight budget that once Ten Hag decided he wanted De Jong that money was tied up leaving all other targets on hold (and while they went to other clubs). We need a lot more than FDJ but if that deal falls through, and ESPECIALLY if he ends up at Chelsea there will be a total meltdown. The fans will probably start shutting down home games in outrage. It tells you everything that the Glazer's set a normal budget during a crisis AND after not spending a penny in January.   On another note they are not good businessmen (shock I know). People just assume a lot of rich guys are uniquely clever when the vast majority of them inherited the wealth. The Glazer's live off daddies money and success but like many trust fund babies (who have been surrounded by ass-kissers their whole lives) go around pretending like they're some business genius that made it on their own.
Let's get a Go Fund Me to buy the Club from the Glazers. We have thr highest fan base worldwide
They laughed at Rangnick when he said United need at least 10 players…
Man united board lied to ten hag, they promised him new players and I'm definitely sure that is what brought him to man united because anyone could see those players are not good enough and right now no manager or player wants to come and play for united and Ten hag should have balls and play this young Boys and drop all this called stars because they are useless.
Maguire, Rashford, Bruno, McTominay......................why are these players always starting games?? 90% of our games we see them starting. Why????
Need to play hardball with Rashford. He doesn't want to play  for united anymore.  Can see it in his face and body language. A payrise is not going to change the fact he is missing his dancing mates. Get rid of some of the coasters
Talk about it lads. Until we pass to another one please scream this out. Your more important than you’ll ever realise. Ste I watch everything you say brother, the boats not floating no more, the ships sinking quick. My hearts broken
Of course we need rangnick for the board position
Yes the club is rotten but are you telling me those players are not good enough to beat BRENTFORD
Ten hag has underestimated the magnitude of his job. If he starts Maguire, Shaw, McFred and Rashford consistently, he's the one to blame. On merit - Varane/Bailly, Malacia, Zidane and Garnaucho deserve to play.
You guys are nothing but a fans of  banter utd.
Implode the team. Play all youth against Liverpool.  Could they do any worse?  I mean who in the squad today is worth keeping to play against Liverpool?   McGuire is shockingly bad, shockingly
I think that 4 United to get back to competing they got to start from 0🤣🤣🤣
trashed out
You predict united will get top 4😎😎
GLAZERS OUTTTTTTR
Lol tune in next Monday for more of the circus show that is United!
The Glazers don't pick the team or coach the players! Change your narrative..
you are all  talking yourselves  to death.   the solution  in my eyes is    FANS  STRIKE        don't go to some games   !       can you imagine   old trafford  standing  EMPTY   in a  game like against  Liverpool  ?
Ex Man Utd pundits didn’t help last season with Ole out of his depth and not be truthful like they would with a manager that wasn’t their mate and then saying Conte not a good fit  Utterly ridiculous
21:05 you're right; it would be "all hands on deck" if a business is struggling, but the is business not struggling in this case [according to the glazers' bank accounts].
As a chelsea fans this sweet me to the max 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂
You Fool. Crook's like Barcelona? Man United fans so bitter about a club that's not in England because our player refuse to join a sinking turd. The level of player's your club can attract is from division 2. Know this and know Ur a small club
Watching in Vietnam. More advertisements than ITV 4. Good content though
GLAZERS OUT day 8
MOURINHO WAS RIGHT AND YOU BASHED HIM. HOW DO U FEEL
The players are a disgrace but ten hag is not up to the job! , not taking conte was a huge mistake! He would have got these players working and running at the very least. This season is going to be absolutely shocking!
Brighton and Brentford are better run clubs.......that says it all.   ManU are years away from a top 6 finish now.
Can't blame the owners, despite what they've not done, they've allowed money to be spent, but between the manager and recruitment team united have fucked it and it's so nice to see - another 20 years of this please thanks 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Your team is a joke Ha Ha
Looking at the next 5 games I don't think we can win any of them with the way the team is playing. Absolute rock bottom. Relegation battle on the horizon.
Lol the two laughing stocks are these two....."man united are back", "ten Haag schools Klopp" deluded fools
😂😂😂😂keep crying
Ollie at the wheel
You are not a legend if u can't  say glazersout
Ferguson just I great manager in the PAST so get a grip
He's in the past ITS GONE
Rio support Arsenal this season
Ferguson
Alex who
0:56 “there’s teams below us I can’t even banter”.   There’s no teams below Man Utd Rio! You’re 20th
Stop ya whingggggiinnggg
But you are a JOKE
Doesn't matter Man utd we once
Rio is right on ETH.He was given false hope.Imagine managing a team that was full of confidence with young ambitious team and coming to Man United.
So get it down ya BIG SAM hahahahahahahh
PUT THE YOUNGSTERS IN! THEY WILL HAVE MORE COURAGE THAN THIS LOT OF PLAYERS. ABSOLUTE JOKE
Ten Hague THE RING LEADER
Stuttering about what YOU FOOL
Rio Ferdinand @rioferdy5 @NUFC fans good morning to you all!! Ya clubs turning a profit, no debt, oh & playing in the PL! Terrible!  Rio you posted that to Newcastle Fans. Why are you crying now???? Or was it, bcuz CASHLEY would market YOUR brand. Over to you Rio, unless you are scared to answer that, as we Toon fans are dying for your answer!!!!
Need to start playing the kids
This is karma, years of laughing at other clubs now you feeling it heavy. Ironic as arsenal look like one of the most promising teams in the league now and you man look like relegation fodder
To be honest.. What can the glazers do?... Everyone wanted Ten haag.... They got him... Ten haag asked for Martinez... They got him.....Theres not much more they can do... Blow another 100 million?....
👉👉I have a feeling that ManU will surprise everyone next week & destroy Liverpool. Take it to the bank.
👇FACT👇  Carles Puyol (Barcelona) is one of the best defenders in history & he is 5ft tall 🤦‍♀️
I died we. rio said I can’t even banter teams below us…. Bruh your 20th in the league, THERE ARE NO TEAMS BELOW U! 😂🤣
Stop blaming the glazers. Your blue eyed English Boys are shite. You sleeping with Rashfords missus?
Shambles in it
Get Rio back out  of retirement.
Thank you rio for speaking out and talking truth
The Glazers have to go at this point. There is nobody left to scapegoat. It's going to cost hundreds of millions to fix the mess they've made on and off the pitch, money they're not willing to spend. The well is drying up. If United get relegated there won't be the money to pay off the debt and pay themselves dividends. Right now they could still sell the club and gain a massive profit, it's time to leave.
Rio should unretire. Better than Maguire or midget Lisandro.
We knew this had to be a whole rebuild under Ten Hag.... nobody said it would be in the Premier League 😅🤦
This is what happens when you fail to prepare for the season with all the signings. We’re a shambles m8
The Glazers don't play for the club. Blame the players and the manager. Not good enough.
GLAZERSOUT- FREDOUT - MAGUIREOUT!
Let’s get it right - these owners should have been THROWN out of this club when they attempted to remove this football club from the historic football league into a Super League, all whilst fans were at home under Covid restrictions. No consultation with fans, NOTHING. They are only concerned with one thing, the DOLLAR. As owners, they have defaulted on their responsibility to be owners of this historic club. It’s time to go. WAKE UP PEOPLE.
Nothing is embarrassing about the club and that's being straight. It's a shithole.
Brentford were like sharks with a scent of blood, Brighton the same the week before. When every point is hard to get and you know effort and physicality can get you 3 points which could help you survive 1 more season in this league. It mentality and motivationally fine tunes the opposition to maximum power settings. Until these players win this battle, the players won't get a moments peace. Win the battle, then you can show your quality.
Aside from fly across the Atlantic, what exactly do you all want the Glazers to do? Would you rather be run by a tyrannical regime associated with countless human rights violations or a shady Putin lackey?
Having Harry Maguire as your team captain proves how low Man Utd have gone.
From a financial and business perspective. If the club's current debt stands at £500M with an interest only finance package. And you are asking for  £700M. Wouldn't it be better to clear the outstanding debt and make the club debt free again. This way you wouldn't be throwing away money in paying the high daily interest. Instead that money can be used to invest in other key areas of the club.
I'm exhausted. If a Company is failing, its pretty common to shake up the board and fire the CEO, you don't usually blame the employees. In this case, the Glazers make money whether Man Utd win or lose so they have a board and management that protects that bottom line and the employees (players) get all the blame. These are not top 6 quality players at all, but who hired them, who gave them ridiculous contracts, who can't get new players, who trashed the youth development, who doesn't have a strategy? This all stops with a culture of failure in the management of the club.
Don't worry mate, it's still only 2nd game of the season. Still 36 games to play.  They will not in this position forever.
Fuckin sick
Expected result when we have the best captain thought I am dreaming saw that at first half
Maguire, Shaw, Dalot, Rashford should all be dropped immediately n shouldnt even be allowed to start Europa matches. Will ETH do that, no chance
I disagree, Ten Hags pride and ego after 'choosing' not to speak to Ragnick about the clubs issues n givin certain players a 2nd chance (4th chance for some) has cost us 6 points.  So Naive
I hope the players learn a lot from this. This aint about United anymore. They ought to have some dignity for themselves.
The glazers have never taken responsibility for anything ever, only ever taken dividends, ams that's never gonna change
ERIK TEN HAG = FRANK DE BOER
The problem with keeping McGuire as captain is that he cannot go back into the dressing room and point fingers at players who are playing terrible. He’s entire team would bash him for the amount of mistakes he makes on a weekly basis. A captain needs to be a leader, if he is making mistakes be accountable and lead by your next example. His lack of presence as a leader on the pitch is ManU’s downfall.
The last 10 years just highlights how good Sir Alex was. You had a 1 in a million gem with him, but now unfortunately for you, you've found your true level.
Ole needs respect for what he did with this shower, yeah  he didn't get silverware but we were competitive at every level
The following players need replacing first: Mguire, Dalot, Fred, Mctominay, Rashford, Elanga, Bruno, Shaw and Wan Bisaka. If we can't buy new players, use the youngsters as they'll work much harder than these lot.
All of yall opinions inside are valid. Pity the players/owners wont bat an eyelid to read it.
Relegation is coming… 7 away defeats in a row. 22 goals conceded, just 2 goals scored. Blown away by Brentford 4-0, Brighton 4-0, Liverpool 4-0, City 4-1, Arsenal 3-1 and also defeats to Everton and Palace. Let’s be  honest that is relegation form spread over 5 months.
But Brentford didn't spend big.  It not that
We could with Rio and Vidic to start with. Embarrassing.
Bruno you are joking yes?
Everyone saw this coming for United. Fergie said on his last day of retirement - do not fire coaches but this bum Rio started that culture - got moyes removed and then they had 4-5 managers in 10 years. This team has players brought in by each coach. Glazers are the worst owners of all time - just look at the Tampa bay bucs who were dead last until Brady showed up.
It's simple: drop Shaw, Maguire, McFred, Fernández and Rashford; bring in: Hannibal and Iqbal, Savage, McNeill, Shoretire and Fernández all from the U23s. These kids will have the energy, drive, fight and passion. The Man U maun squad us gonna get them languishing in the bottom 6 for the foreseeable. All other clubs are getting themselves sorted and international players are no longer attracted to go to Man U. So go in-house and rebuild from the roots, working around the youth.
We begin with the manager and the players. Give rashford a salary cut and no new contract. Martinez, arsenal must be pissing themselves. Mcguire mactominey are we serious playing these guys.
4 manager exchange but Maguire still Captain. .why always Maguire, Fred, Mctominey and Shaw. .they are toxic in Manchester squad. .i'm for sorry for Ten Hag😞
I’m loving it personally. MOT.
Man Utd playing like this without getting rid of Penaldo the cancer...will play championship next year with Everton 😂
Sadly , we don't have the quality signings Rio to beat teams in the Premier League, Are we a championsship  team???
and people still angry with ronaldo for wanting to leave that sh*thole?.......XD
I think we need to face facts. We need Ole back. He never got a chance to finish the rebuild. He can bring the good vibes back
This is out Football club we are getting Killed. Glaziers out at United.
Well i had enough of this. Shambles yes it is. I Want you all to remember the months before they bought Ronaldo. Manchester Unuted were second. Then the prosess was to buy a midfielder that you were missing. And all that positive stuffthen Ronaldo suddenly ere going to manchester city and ya all were 20 years back,no ronaldo please we have to buy him. Then see what happend after that? Thats why you ere were u are.
But the business isn't strugling for Glazers. They still ger their money regulary.
34 years a united fan and I promise you now I have never felt so annoyed am sick of seeing players getting game time coz of merit we carnt bench Maguire coz he's England captain blah blah sick of seeing rashford mummy cuddled he's not good enough olay garnacho he's hungry midfield is just a mine field but I'd try Martinez as a cdm and have lindaloph and varane at cb Maguire is always all over the place then points the finger we've collected too much dead wood from managers over the years now ten haag is expected to do something with this group. I said in the comments on the last vibe from last season and I said united will get 1 or 2 players and expect to just get by. Glazers need to go that's one thing but the whole club is rotten it's a proper said sight
If liverpool win 2-0 then i would consider that a great result. We are terrible, any proper team like pool or city will destroy us again
It is on Rio, on ex-players, on board and anyone supporting Glazers, individuals over Man U. Ralf was 100% right, shame on Rio, Glazers and board for not accepting the truth and sacking Ralf. Man U is dead, will get relegated if no heart surgery is done and buy 10 new players.
Why do we not ship players out when they don't make the grade ? We have so many players at the club that are totally deadwood
They said pogba was the problem now he is gone I wonder who souness will blame now ??
Love it this is where man United belongs comedy mode this is brilliant the team what keeps on giving Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
Man united are a meme now.
No one listened to Mourinho 🤔
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Again you seem confused between sport success and financial success. The Glazers don't care because they are making money.
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
About to crash his car 3 times in the passenger seat, makes no sense 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Glazers care more about Tampa Bay.  Our players do not show up, do not put in an effort & do not care. We're going to get smacked around by Liverpool & they will trash us. These players will throw ETH under the bus to save their salary.
Joel is gonna eat u lads up 😂😂😂
I don't know why you think ex players speaking out will change the ownership. So long as they make money they will own the club regardless of criticism.
😳😳😳😳🎼🗑 🙄 can’t banter Arsenal no more.?! Ok.. 🤣
Ragnick..ten hag background cannot fix club with a lot problem...this is board problem when conte is available...
We are bottom of the league say we are bottom of the league
Stop blaming the glazers, Haag is at fault this time, he’s been obsessed with one player all window messing up the transfers, board have agreed fees and he can’t convince them to come. This is on Haag
Oh big F@ckin deal Rio thinks the Glazers should come over here?!?!?! huge Story eh? FFS wheres the opinion you asked for? he didn't speak on them, other than saying they need to come over and communicate more? really Rio? is that it mate?
Rio, just want to say that you were brilliant on Filthy Fellas.
Mourinho did good with them. Ole did good with them. Ralf did good with them. Ten Hag will reach 10th or something, and that’ll be good. For this squad. They’re about in the same league as Aston Villa, and they were 14th last season. That’s where they SHOULD be… They’re absolutely awful.
With all due respect to Rio, the argument about a "failing business ... all hands on deck" falls down. United is making money for the Glazers, so they don't care about on-field success, and they aren't entrepreneurs, they're venture capitalists. They just exist to squeeze a cash-cow until it is a dried up husk and then move on. They aren't like traditional business owners who muck in when times are tough. When the profits stop coming in, they will sell up and move on, they aren't emotionally invested in the club, it's just numbers on a balance sheet to them.
I was in my car travelling almost crashed my car 3 times and I was in the passenger seat huh ? Ok rio
Awww the cry 😢 👶 babies blaming the glazers(they father) for not giving them more money to spend to have the right friends(players)  "This is Manchester united, we are talking about"  Rio remember when u got ask if manutd could become the next Liverpool(going 30years) You laugh 😃 "no chance"   You guys need to remember, although u were good /great players, you had influenced on the refs, Fergie was the FA favorite man(made sure rules were bend for him)  Rafa Benitez rant about him was a laughing stock for u & the media but its karma hitting u in your faces   Manutd will become the new Everton, a once big club
The Glaziers should go followed by players who take humongous pay but give nothing in return. They do not comprehend the coach instructions. People were like Moyes was bad, Van Gaal was boring, Jose M. was was no more special, OGS was a baby coach, Ragnik was not a coach and now Eric Ten Hag. Whose fault now? On the other hand, the Glaziers do not understand the real football business. If they continue to manage Man United like this, they will loose all the major sponsors and the value of the club will go lower reducing the value of the club. I am afraid of unknow!
😂😂😂😂😂
Man Utd need to change the whole squad.
The one point you guys are missing is no good player wants to go to Utd and your golden boy CR7  only came back for the money 👍
Ten Hag could do a "Frankie de boer" in first 7 games. THEN WHAT??
We're fucked
Another very weak man who's in charge of this club who's got absolutely no charisma or authority
If Utd beat Brighton 5-0 last week would there be any talk of protests? I don’t think so, and that’s exactly the reason why no one takes your protests seriously. If the Glazers want to get this new protest cancelled they just need to sign De Jong before the Liverpool game.
We. Are. Going. Down.
What's more "funny" is that they want to bring Rabiot,  I mean wtf, Manchester United is bigger that these kind of players, it's kinda infuriating.
Ppl looking at me funny as I'm shouting at the car windsreen listening to the car radio, as every goal goes in.
Obviously there’s big issues at united and it’s a hard job but…Ten haag is naive. Martinez has been bullied 2 games in a row. He’s escaped much criticism but he’s been very bad so far, welbeck and Toney targeted him. Either play him midfield or go to a back 3. Fred can’t play alongside Eriksen and Bruno, that’s a tiny, weak midfield against a physical Brentford side.   I agree with what they’re saying obviously but ten Haag needs to play a more solid team, varane shouldn’t be on the bench and shaw should never play a game again. Malacia showed passion and played well.
Rio you got the money buy man u lol 😂😂😂😂
The more I look at it the more I think,  How good is Ole?
The glazers aren't on the training ground, coaching these players. This is down to hype players and hype coaches.
Utd fans needs to be patient.   I know it's painful now, but the squad is poor.  Let's hope the manager gets time to fix it.    These two games is a wake up call for ten hag, there's no gimme, he'll learn just like pep.
Need full team
Man like Rio was saying Man Utd would finish in the top 4 last week.....2 games in to the season he's asking "Where are the Glazers?" 😂😂😂😂
Making money is paramount to the Glazers. Winning is immaterial as long as the tills are full. There is zero ambition to be successful. Deep down the players know they don't have a chance of winning the League so just want to fill their pockets too like the owners. Winning is secondary..
Not a single coach in this world   eve pep or klopp, can develop and win a trophy with this current crop of players. We need more new players . Players that manager wants. We cant polish a turd!
I was watching in the car......I was in passenger seat.... Good save lol
With this backline (except maybe Martinez), almost nonexistent midfield, and GK like de Gea, do we really have to keep playing from the back...? I'm not a manager or anything but there has to be another way to play football...
Manchester United is the same club as it was in 2014.   No difference. No improvement. Thats the problem.
The glazers need to accept defeat and just sell up they not up for the task and out of respect for club just leave !! Utd need new owners with some desire and ambitions
Nothing will get better before the Glazers are gone.  Thinking otherwise is naive. It was different under SAF and Gill. First of all, those two controlled EVERYTHING that had to do with the footballing part, and our stadium, Carrington etc was fine. It is not fine anymore, and nobody will ever has the power SAF had ever again. Not under any ownership.
"and I was in the passenger seat" that actually cheered me up.
As a liverpool fan, i dont think liverpool is the biggest worry for man u. Man city and Tottenham look bonkers right now
There is losing and losing with dignity and showing heart.  Seems lost on this squad.  They are in so much trouble next week
It’s a sad situation , if they had employed a a proper DOF under Woodward  and bought up and coming players not name brand players thing would be different ,  Theve flogged the horse for to long and is got no legs
It's obvious Rio has a deep relationship with the Glazers, which I don't blame him for probably long standing friends and employers... He asked for them to come and talk to fans LOL we need them OUT not to talk
Dutch league vs prem big difference ey Teny boy lol
We have been laughing stock for the last 10 years... We have been laughing stock since the 1st minute of the first post Fergie game. Its been sad decade as United fan.
Rio why u making like Ten has not gotten players his gotten the ones he wanted the rest just don't want to play for ur usless club blaming the owners yet they put the money up for the players
MARK MY WORDS: We will be crying out for Arnautovic by Christmas.
Rio had to check his statement about driving before he got a letter from the constabulary 🤣
Put the contact on the table now Rio 🙈😁😁😁
We need Elon musk at this point
Rio mate tell Van der Sar, Evra, Neville, Vidic, Scholes, Carrick, Rooney, Giggs, Owen, Van Nistelrooy to come back to United, I bet y’all that at your current age you all have more form and shape than the current squad.
We had Ben mee looking like Sergio ramos 3.0 🤦🏿🤬
This another idiot will not blame the players…
Remember that smug look of satisfaction last year Rio gave when it appeared CR7 might go to City?  I was hoping this channel might turn into arsenal fan tv 2.0 and be worth a watch but these clowns are as boring as the football they watch every week.
Our cycle is over and it’s going to take a long time for not only the team, but that whole club to get into a better position
U won the league during pre season lmao so where was this energy???? Running out of pepole now its the owners fault heard Gary blaming the stadium falling apart lmao stfu 🤣
Banter club
I don’t agree with the point that the Glazers don’t need to worry as we will always stay United fans. Yes the core will stay but the kids will look for other clubs. In 5 years this will have big financial impacts that will bring the share price rock bottom. My 6 year old son already asking to rather watch Liverpool or city …sad but true
Embarrassing I'm a Birmingham City fan, remember in the 80s taking over half of Brentford's ground, and they're smashing probably the biggest club in the world
I’m literally crying don’t know what the hell is happening with Manchester United 😭😭😭😭
IT'S TIME OUR MANCHESTER UNITED PUNDITS NEED TO SPEAK OUT AND OUR FANS NEED TO UNITE AND GET THE #GLAZERSOUT
NFL preseason just started. Got Brady on his last year. There is NO SHOT the Glazers focus on United any time soon.
Why blame the stadium, that isn’t the reason why the players are so bad
The more money the club looses  The more the glazers can deduct from their taxes !!
The glazers don't give a sh*t. They don't care about how the fans feel. Shut down Old Trafford on Monday. Shut down all our home games. Then they will start feeling the hurt. The game against Liverpool needs a good protest.
Feel your pain Rio lad
I remember meeting David Gill on a stadium tour about 11 years ago and he stood and talked to us fans for about 10 minutes and shook everyone's hand and thanked us for our support. Absolute gentleman
Its all Solskjaer's fault. Ole out!!!.... Oh wait... Nvm
Trying to tell the Glazers that this is a football club rather than a "normal business" is like trying to speak to a cat.
Glazers are counting the dividends...
Problem is the business is fine. They have made £20m in dividends this year. If I owned a "failing" business and could take that much every year I'd be laughing. Need to hit the pocket of the Glazer's before anything will change.
If I was ten haag, I'd drop every single player for the Liverpool game and play the youngsters, no matter the score it can't be worse than what the first team would do
I think United should hire Gordon Ramsey as a consultant at the club at this point.
AWFUL...and I was only i listening to the match on 5 live....well get relegated if we get any worse...overpaid players who hav jus given up..How and who is going to turn this around?? SO many problems on many levels here...they need psychotherapy and I'd recc some regular hypnotherapy in training..works brilliantly and quick...could turn around lack of confidence and improve training and competence levels...seriously....for the amount of money MU spends this would be very worthwhile...please Rio have a word ...
Why don’t we sell all of our players on the cheap and buy all players from Brentford. Then we should have some cash on the side for other investments… just some food for thought
Ten Haag should take some blame as well. Starting the league Fred & McTominnay in mid is ridiculous. Surely, he could've offered a plan B/C/D to De Jong to the club. It is almost a sin to keep Donny, Varane on the BENCH? These guys have the tools at the club. Dalot is quite useless, at least AWB can tackle. As a manager, the Glazers hands-off approach is works if the CEOs are not clueless. How do you start a season without a proper midfield?
And yet yous lot still think you’re going to finish top 4 and above Arsenal lol
Idk man. There's only so long u can blame the players. The whole atmosphere is wrong. It's not the players, it's the management. I feel bad for u fans & I'm a city fan.
How much was vidic bought evra Raphael Rooney even Ferdinand christiano non was bought anywhere 50m
"And I was in the passenger seat"   Good save Rio,good save.
Sir Alex is part of the problem, it is a hard pill to swallow, but that is fact. Can someone explain McTom?
The only player to go for a profit... Daniel James! I'll tell you how it's gone wrong Rio... Because we've had our DNA and identity stolen from us by a bunch of Football Terrorist... Whilst all pundits drool over the teams of human rights abusers! They have come in, spent BILLIONS, and BLOWN the Glazer's out of the water!! It's not even the Glazer's fault, it's not their fault they cannot compete with a STATE OWNED club!! Man City are owned by an entire COUNTRY FFS and that's the fing TRUTH! They have bought the best manager, stadium, training ground, coaches and players! Completely sportswashed football, from Championship to Champions League... Overnight!! Complete corruption and that is the TRUTH!! THE ONLY WAY WE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO COMPETE IS IF WE A) BECOME A STATE OWNED CLUB (& SELL OUR SOUL SEEMS NO ONE GIVES AF ABOUT NCSTL/CITY) OR B) GET TAKEN OVER BY SOMEBODY WHO CAN COMPETE AND INVEST!! C) GET THESE CHEATING STATE OWNED CLUBS OUT OF THE LEAGUE BECAUSE THEY ARE A COMPLETE STAIN ON THE GAME AND THEY ARE RUINING HISTORICAL CLUBS!!! THAT'S THE TRUTH, SPEAK THE TRUTH!
As bad as it may be and may get, I am so down for united to get relegated snd completely reset  Get rid of everyone on High wages who haven't earned them, poor poor ten haag the board have completely done him
Have mercy Liverpool
"I cant even banter Arsenal fans anymore" jezus christ man united is DONE
Glazers where are you come on they've  spent  more money then most teams come on  No signing coz no one wants to go to a club in the mess at united I still can't understand that ex players and all the fan still think man u are the club they used to be the fly Scotsmen left and since that so has man u understand it
The glazers were at old trafford vs brighton....  U signed top players post fergie none did anything.
Noones buying UTD, they would need billions to buy it, pay its debt thats another 500mill, and inverst in players another 500mil, groundwork and training facilities etc.....
Rangnick said this team needs a minimum of 10 players in the transfer and they threw him and his bags to the street like a crazy old man.
I'm really enjoying watching this 😌
Rio almost crashed his car from the passengers sit😂
Do you guys think the Mason developments have had a bigger impact on the dressing room than people have made out? The results have gotten progressively worse since the news broke.
Ferguson can manage these players what u need is different kind of coach Glazers can't be blamed
The club is broken money men that don't love this club bad times ahead
GLAZERS DONT CARE THEY ONLY WANT THEIR DIVIDENDS. THATS IT
Recruitment is poor. Sancho took 3 years, now we chasing after De Jong for almost 6 months. Move on!
lee gunner is going to start supporting united
I can’t tell you how beautiful this is. Tears in my eyes 😂
The glazers are driving this club into the ground
Will be back. Proud of Rio. He really cares.
Steve macca will sort it out🐦
I blame Pogba 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
We’re not even a laughing stock anymore. We’re pitiable.
Should have asked him about Ralf...he warned us longtime this club needs open heart surgery! yet nobody backed him..😂😆
The recruitment of players and coaches,  stealing a living, good to see the Penny finally drop.
Pity ex-players like Rio and Neville don't use their platforms to extend the calling out of the hierarchy and their lack of competence to fulfil the roles that they find themselves in. It seems as if this doesn't happen because to call out Arnold & Murtough you would have to question how on earth their ex-teammate Fletcher has been appointed and remains as technical director. What has he achieved outside of his playing career to warrant such a role in one of the biggest clubs in the world?  The same applies to calling out shocking individual performances and the unwillingness to run on the pitch. Why not question if the likes of Shaw, Rashford, Maguire & Scotty are good enough to be at the club? The English/British bias continues to shelter these players. I won't forget Rashford's unwillingness to even jog towards the end of last season as he repeatedly strolled back towards his own goal and the same lack of effort was present today. These players have played under numerous managers in the last 4 years. You shouldn't need a coach to ask you to track back & work when you lose the ball.
Lol 4 nil
This is very funny cause this is everything you guys were saying about Arsenal a few years ago😆And im sorry to say you guys are years away from being competitive again, and one thing you guys have to understand is that just because you were a once great club it doesn't give you a Devine right and swallow a big slice of humble pie!!!
The man united squad has more than enough quality in it to beat Brentford and at least match Brighton. I’m not having it that the squad isn’t good enough. Plenty of teams are working with lower quality players that wouldn’t lose 4-0 to Brentford. Put simply something is fundamentally wrong at united. How do they keep signing exciting players like sancho and varane only to turn them into bang average players? Not a single player seems able to replicate the quality they showed at their previous club once they arrive at united.
Rio, remember you told Ralf to stop talking so much to the media when he exposed the failures of this club. You're just as culpable for allowing this rot and protecting the establishment. Your were defending Arnold, Murtough and Fletcher,  you've been utterly exposed for your hypocrisy and pandering.
Hahahaha! Finally Rio talks sense. Laughing stock you are! Your time is over - for good! Laters xxx
How many times ..all those don't play them simply..
20:55 Thats the core problem... Why would anyone perform at work when the owners and top hierarchy have no ambition? (They only see the money they take out of the club every month, and its fixed). No one is responsible for anything it seems. Players dont care and i cant blame them sadly...
Ten Hag is also partly to be blamed,he has reluctantly refused to go for other alternative players still insisting on De Jong, why put malacia on the bench and play Shaw? Why did you sign him? Dallot is awful but still starts. Quite disgusting to watch United
Shouldn’t be driving and watching football at the same time  should you mate !!! 🙄
Harry Maguire starting over Raphael Varane is akin to titus bramble starting over Fabio Cannavaro.  4-0 down at the half hour mark and 1 of the most successful players in the history of the game is sat on the Bench and Eric Baillys been left at home drinking some hot cocoa and asking God whether he's living in a parallel universe where Harry Maguire is a better center back than him. Embarrassing
I wanted to say a lot but I just can't be bothered any more.
I honestly think that any new owner that comes in would be just as bad as the glazers. In order to buy Manchester United in 2022 you would have to be a mega, mega rich multi billionaire. After that kind of outlay buying the club they aren’t going to want to spend much more or they won’t start making their money back.   Either that or you end up with some really shady characters who use the club to improve their public image.
I have no comment .
It's like a witch cursed United and died before lifting the curse.
UNITED FANS DON.T SPEND ANOTHER PENNY TO M.U.F.C IT.S EASY TO DO 50p OF EVERY POIUND IS GOING IN THE GLAZERS POCKET ENOUGH  ALREADY
They don't hire the best people for the job - simple it's not just a lack of care its just half arsed n negligent.
When Rio was talking about how many players weve bought since Fergie and how you accidentally get 2 or 3 diamonds, We have had world class players and they've gone shite. That's even worse ! Not only are we not improving players we're actually making them worse.
Man utd are a laughing stock. They were shambolic today 😤😡🤬
Triple mud
Give ole the job! Man utd are back!
We better play the youth rather than these amateur players,we need to kicked these players such as Maguire, Bruno,Fred,McTominey, Rashford, Luck Shaw,De Gea out from the club,we need to replace them,they're not good enough to place for this great club
Man Utd spent over £1 billion since 2013 when Fergie left. There is no rebuilding. They just spent badly and they're paying for it now.
Drop Shaw, Maguire, Dalot, McTominay, Fred, Bruno and Ronaldo.    Back four of Malacia, Lindelof, Varane and Laird.  Martinez sits deep with Eriksen and Sancho ahead.  Garnacho left, Elanga right and Rashford up front.  I don’t have any other ideas - but the team should be a meritocracy and some of the players have proven that they are simply not capable of playing at this level.
Lol, remember when Big lad Rio defended Mike Ashley for his ownership of Newcastle United, hahaha cant make it up. Love to see it.
BTW Ronaldo isnt the problem
RIO for me MAGUIRE, SHAW, RASHFORD, BRUNO ALL NEED TO BE BENCHED
Rio stop telling lies!! How come you driving and almost crash you car from the passenger seat...🤔🤔
These group of players don’t know what’s the meaning of honour. How huge it is to play for football club like Manchester United in their youth ? They don’t seem to have any team spirit and individually they’ve have been exposed as technically very weak to execute the tactics and new possession based style of football as they can’t even do simple short passes or grounded crosses. Today, why did the full backs always tried to do the aerial cross and never a grounded cross was mind boggling ?
So refreshing to hear honest fans opinions on their club. United will back at the summit soon.
It is clear now that Ole remains a legend both as a player and as a coach. How Ole managed to reach 4th, 3rd, and 2nd consecutively in PL before he was sacked is part of his level of genius? Although he never won a trophy for Man U, but he is still the best manager post SAF for me. United have 3 problems. 1) The board: The board need to invest more in the team and let the manager get the players he wanted. Ole never wanted VDB, yet we got him under Ole and he never used him because VBD cannot play his style of football effectively. Ole never wanted CR7. Man U dominated in its first two games last season, before Ronaldo's debut, and people were talking about title challenge for Man U. After CR7's debut, the Ole adjusted his style of play to suit Ronaldo and that was the beginning of the end of Ole's Man U managerial career. Ronaldo is not a problem don't get me wrong, but he can only fit into Conte's or Chelsea's team perfectly at his current age. 2) The fans: The fans need to stop dictating who the manager or the team should sign. Let the manager sign who they want and can play their tactic. Most of the players in the team were promoted by the fans and these players struggled to fit in despite the huge amount spent because fans promoted them. There are players who don't have passion to play for the team, though they are good, but came because of money and media promotion. Klopp and Pep decide who they want to sign and they sign them, cheap, because they can play their style of football and fit in their team easily, without media or fans promotion. FDJ is out again with medias and fans promotion for a player who do not want to play for the team. Why must we always beg players to come and  3) The players: The players need to play for the money they are getting paid for. We know they don't have passion for the team than the money they get but at least they should be able to work for the huge wage they gets.
Blame the owners when you blew money on Sancho and Varane.
Glazer’s are on the golf course, they do not give a 💩 about Man U. They just want ££££££ and sucking the life out of Man U
Blame pogba
#ralfwasright. There was absolutely nothing wrong with what Ralf was trying to do other than these priveleged entitled pricks didn't want to put in the effort. End of, wouldn't be surprised if no more players come in that Ten Hag leaves and the fans take over OT again. LUHG.
This club has destroyed me 💔
Couldn't happen to a more deserving fan base 😂
Ste obviously hasn't been to Rosso recently 😂👀
We'll probably beat Liverpool, then get beaten by Southampton. GGMU
Rios lip looks like 🐈 yow
Hush bro arsenal looking reel 💯💯🇯🇲🇯🇲
Sky sports have only just started to back the united fans up even tho we saved them last year with other fans from the big clubs for. The super league would of killed sky sports and any other channels, its about time we got backed and by the Premier league
United are reaping what they sow. Not only for the past 10 years. But for the past 6 months. Ragnick would have turned that club inside out all the way to the smallest stone but no one wanted to listen to his analysis about the rot.
Do I feel sorry for you lot with the next match being Liverpool? NO NO NO!!! LOLOL!  COME ON LIVERPOOL, YNWA!!!
While you are all hear listening to Rio just remember that he is part of the World Economic Forum...he is a joke himself.
Rio you can banter with the championship sides, you’ll be with them soon enough if you have a few more days like today
GLAZERS DONT PLAY ON THE PITCH ITS THE PLAYERS
strip maguire of the captaincy I beg, even basic leadership on the pitch is missing.
I wish the ex players who are club ambassadors step down to protest the Glazers . Its really up to the former players to save the club rn .
Boycott the OT if you love our club. Boycott all that is United until they leave. As long as the Glazers are here nothing will ever change.
Cristiano Ronaldo 😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔 he still my 🐐 no matter what
I just think the Premier league is such a high quality now you can't just wing it as much, the managers have got so much more about them that they can pick apart any team that isn't quite at the races. We could end up being relegation fodder if we arnt carefull. Mabe abit dramatic but could get alot worse if we don't get the glazers out
Sorry to say it, but why should I be put on blood pressure medication because the actual owners don’t care about their own business but we do? I’m out until the Glazers are… full on boycott
Rio, please, can you and vidic come back
The glazers have never invested anything into our club onlu used the money that the finance machine mufc is and have generated all they have ever done is it withdrawn cash. if utd had the investment pumped into the club like roman put into Chelsea or wat Sheik Mansoor had put into city we  wud b able to compete more ut all decisions from the top for 17yrs have been totally abysmal an the Current players shud b embarrassed like a us man u fans r for so long now, The   club is becoming a Joke.
Shocking stuff..Club is a laughing stock..
You cannot have owners who want to implement an NFL business model into the EPL. They simply do not care about our history. The fact that Joel Glazer was co chairman of the Super League proves that our owners cannot be trusted
Bruno is a very very poor player
don't fret it will soon be over, Glazers need a little more blood and then you can recover
Preseason champs🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Sadly it’s so bad Newcastle are recruiting better players and they can’t offer champions league football either . Unless there is a massive change before the window closes United aren’t even in the top 10 this season. If you can’t get in superstars start recruiting the best players in the EPL out with the top 4.,Sad reality is no one is interested in the fans voices and United are going to be the old Newcastle under Mike Ashley .  Toxic!
Ole deserves more respect for getting these into the CL twice, but I still don't know why it went so downhill when Varane, Ronaldo and Sancho joined
Crooks like Barcelona you say??? 🤣 it's not Barca who is under hostage by the glazers 🤣🤭
They all do not deserve those huge wages
If United are not careful, they might be battling relegation, like what happened to Everton, last season
The players have not bottle and no desire. That isn't just on the owners. Even if I have zero love for them
Ten Hag going into the season with Championship standard GK & midfield. Yet for some reason he’s surprised?! 😂 Huge wake up call for Ten. 😒👎
The power is in the fan just like Legendary Rio said , if fans don’t go to the games im sure there will be change.
it is actually very simple. all these things rio mentions? they do not care, 'manchester united' is a business in a sense yes but the glazers ownership of united have nothing to do with running it as it's own entity. 'manchester united' is a brand a piece or a 'tool' for them that is all it is and all it will ever be to them.   the purpose have always been to bleed and scrape every bit of meat off the bone and leave a ruin and a carcass on the floor when they eventually sell the name back.  because that is all it is at this stage,  it is not a 'football club'  it is a logo on a shirt.
Club needs to invest in the players mental health if they’re not going to buy players and realistically they’re going to bring in max 3 more players. So it’s important to build up these players’ confidence back up. Everyone looks absolutely destroyed on that pitch. I think therapy would work wonders for these lot, also group therapy and activities to unite the group again.
weak utd fans protest 🪧
Rio please you have contacts. Please please try get on touch with glazers. Get neves  get leimar,  get the best in class. You have the power and contacts. Get maguire out take the captain armband of him hand it to ronny tell ronny to pick his team. Do something other than talk here on your show. Love your show but you got power.
As Newcastle Fans got told, why don't you just buy the club? You should thank the owners for investing their money (The money made by the clubs is there's after all, as was Mike Ashley's), Glazers kept you in the Prem Rio, be happy, be thankful, be grateful.
Bring Greenwood back as soon as possible!!! Even Chicharito.
*-GLAZERSOUT-*   🔰🔰🔰
Why is Phil Jones still at Manchester United?
It's not about money anymore. 1 billion 5 billion won't make any difference. We will still be run like the dog and duck.
Man Utd Foundation should better start giving away free therapy/counseling services to fans.
Everyone’s missing the point with the owners. They’re not their to win or do well. They never pretended to be. They own Manchester United because they can leverage it as an asset with big banks. They use it as collateral to help them take out huge lines of credit that funds their business ventures. That’s it.   To them United is a bunch of buildings and the players are over inflated assets. That’s it. They don’t own us to win. Being global commercial tycoons, to them is winning. Winning to them Is revenue not on pitch success.   If you don’t like it, they don’t care. If you protest, they don’t care. They’ll seek when we’re dropping out the league because we can’t afford the over inflated wages of players.   Watch us do a Leeds.
"There's teams below I cant even banter" Sorry to break it to you Rio, but theres currently nobody below Utd'😂
Manchester United's amount of success had already come to an end ten years ago. It is very unlikely they will ever see that success again.  They were able to mobilize their commercial arm at the birth of the Premiership quicker than other teams. That fuelled their success.
This would be a good convo if ste didn’t talk over rio all the time
We opened Pandoras Box when we invited Americans to influence football: the beautiful game. They have a game in which they run and carry the ball,, also called football. Americans ooze with confidence, as they behave foolishly, chasing dollars.
Can you guys please own up to your mediocrity and stop pointing fingers at Glazers all the time... you want the glazers to get some boots and step on the pitch???
The first two goals our defence looked like they couldn’t be arsed, not showing for the ball. Pedestrian, lethargic, absolute mess at our club at the moment.
Why did Ferguson and Gill not prepare a succession plan before they departed? They were in the club for decades… im not suggesting its all their responsibility, but thats what great leaders should do. Look for example at Apple, Jobs knew he wont be there forever and ensured there is a succession plan so company wont go bust without him.
Rio . Help us out here  We mustn't take this anymore!!! Win or lose Glazers OUT .. don't be a spectator HELP IN EVERY WAY THAT YOU CAN!  WE are making a difference! Falling profits, cancelled sponsorship deals, Falling stock market prices  BUT make no mistake, these Glazers are scum. They sued their own SISTER to get more money from their parents will, in a legal battle lasting 10years, and, won!  We have to be in this for the long haul.  supporters from:- Protesters Unite👊 United stand  The 1948 Stretford Paddock United real therapy Flying pig The man United agenda Alice talks football The muppetiers Saeed TV United view Webby & O'Neill United people's tv  SAY what you can, DO what you can Social media/ticket sales/emails&letters to MU club/Cancel subscriptions/Call MU/Tag sponsors/Create Twitterbots/Disrupt events  We are in it for the long haul Fans UNITED  Whether you protest/speak up/social media post/write letters WE are in it together MAKE YOU VOICE HEARD💯🔥❤️ One Love
Now you onow how Nufc fans felt about Mike Ashley Rio you complete dunce
Not a united fan, but that is embarrassing.. why dont united go for Neves? No wonder why conte or zidane wanted to touch united
Ok but yano there's alot of actual things goin on around the world right?? No one cares about mancs
Get back out there Rio these idiots have no idea 🙄
United have reached the point where they can't sign the big players they need anymore, they will go elsewhere.
I badly feel sorry for Ten Hag
The Glazers wont come out into the daylight because they're vampires sucking the life & wealth out of the club.
Enough is Enough. "GLAZERS OUT" .
Rio are you willing to call out why folks like your mate Darren Fletcher is working as a sporting director?
Blaming only the owner is also description for a level of intelligence. Are they kicking the ball? Rio open your eyes and start to look the problem into the squad!!!! Bunch of fcking losers as they play. No respect for the club and for each other. Can you tell me any time when you (as a United player) forget to fight for your mates? No, you can't because It's never happened! This squad is not enough to reach European top football. Let them go and give time for a passionate manager who knows what means to be a Man UTD player. Shame on all!
I thought Pogba was the problem.
What is wrong with manager knowing that Maguire,  Luke Shaw,  Fred, Mc Tominay and Rashford is average,  overrated and 2nd division players.... I don't care weither we lose or win but I don't want to see them play.... And also why buying old retired players unlike Liverpool and Manchester city who buy young and good players...Now I want my money back forsupporting past 25 years.... Enough is enough 😌 I won't watch and support Manchester United again..
Remember when you said Newcastle should be saying thank you to Mike Ashley for spending 50m when they went down well why aren't you saying "thank you to the glazers for spending a billion since fergy left "
As a neutral and from a club that went in to a decline because of poor ownership...I have seen the same signs at MU it starts in fits, slowly rot from the edges, then you could see it with poor players and buying decisions, panick decisions, wrong managers, money taken out of the club instead of investing in the youth, the training ground, upgrades to the ground.   The owners in this case have sucked the life out of the club, there's no vision, poor executives. It's a unique situation and its been papered over because of MU's historic past, everyone has been living on the past, only fumes remain  - and the owners have used that belief to their benefit £££  The owners will not change... they will attempt to (lip service), then back off. They will only leave IF forced to and IF it is cheaper for them to leave than to stay.   At this rate you will be in the bottom half. The players have never had to handle the stress of flirting with relegation nor does the manager have a real understanding of the Prem, how each and every game is a battle, any team at the bottom can beat a top team.   Question: would you accept going down for one season IF it meant you wld get rid of the Glazers and most of the hangers on? A true reset...
Ten Hag is part of the problem he said the players are good enough
Seriously United need 25 new players
Heading for championship. Relegation, we are shite
Rio CALL OUT the Glazers on TV like Gary Neville does. I'm with Erik all the way! THE GLAZERS HAVE TO GO FIRST #glazersout
this was bad bad
The glazer family doesn’t care about trophy’s only for profit. They have own Tampa Bay buccaneers for 20 years and only have won 1 super bowl.
Wank united
Remember when you told Newcastle fans to buy the club Rio?
David Beckham could lead a consortium for a takeover couldn't he?
Time for action starting Liverpool
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 how can you support Man urd in 2022?
Players Out:  Shaw Maguire Fred  Players In:  Guehi Rice Abraham
Ralf said we need an open heart surgery but if am honest we are in coma and not really sure whether we are dead or a live. Maybe we are dead but we fans just think we are alive but we are dead.
God i cant stand rio
So the glazers should come and communicate and get involved....but when Todd Boehly gets involved at chelsea Gary Neville says he is playing football manager.......
I don't understand Glazer out Explain two things to me, First, when exactly have they not spent money in the transfer market? A billion pounds is not enough? Getting some of the world's most decorated coaches and players is not enough? Second, who exactly can replace these owners who can do anything differently? Nobody can afford such a massive club, including all its debt, other than some other yanks, or some people with blood money/oil money trying to sportwash their way.   Every coach has failed miserably. You bought Varane, Sancho, Eriksen, Malacia, Martinez, van de Beek, Telles and Cristiano in three seasons. Don't tell me nobody is investing, absolute horsecrap.
I love my team city OMG🥰💙💙
Maguire out 🤡
I killed my own family after watching this game , I’m currently on death row
We got Maguire as our captain will never eva win any trophies or play well or a league with him in our team
What a surprise Rio not calling out his mates on the pitch. 🤷‍♂️
where are they? watching and ploughing our money into the Buccaneers
the thing is that the glazers do not care about English football. they don't understand it.  plus mabe they think or know that in the future that they want to take the club into a mess type league no relegation or promotion
These players, managers, owners and board threw some of the greatest managers the world have seen under the bus and what makes us think they won't do the same to any other manager. At this rate ETH will need the lawnmower rather than the hair dryer.
One pundit in Germany who has talked to Rangnick in private said that he told him: "I am not able to list you all the things that are going wrong in the club. It is even worse than it seems."
This man once blamed Ralph for speaking facts
I had a niceeeee nap, woke up and i saw this 4-0 L .... Something is wrong in the club its not Just the players its something unhappies
I’m surprised fans are still going to the games. I say let’s boycott the games and let’s see how empty stadium can kick their butts 🤭
Have not invested in the stadium, the training ground or in recruitment, money has come from either borrowed money or money from revenue of fanbase & commercial side. Owners have not put in a single penny to Utd. Get out now! Players step for the badge and take full of this performance again! 😠🤬
😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rio we are going down this season we dont deserve beeing in premier league we are terrible..
Rio last year you  said youde got the signings with ronaldo ,Verane,and Sancho
In recent years, our best results have come when we have played as a counter attacking team. Ole was successful initially because of that. The moment he started to try playing as a possession based pressing team, we started conceding too many goals, and that hasn't changed. This leaky defence transmits this nervous energy throughout our team, and I guess that has a direct knock on effect on our attacking players. Untill we reinforce properly with 4-5 new players, we should try playing 5-3-2 as a counterattacking team, so that our slow defence doesn't get caught that often.
Glory glory glazers!!
De Gea New R.back   Varane   Martinez   Malacia     Ericsson    New no.6     New no.8   Sancho    Cr7       New Left Attacker
Barcelona is broke yet they signing quality players What is going on with this team Man United is finished until new owners get here we will be fighting relegation this season
Ex players need to call out their buddies. Some of which are in the backroom with no experience and known function.
Rio ferdy Manchester United are back hahahaha
Just round the money up and buy the club if you don't like it.
GLAZERS OUT!
When Rabiot has flopped in a year's time, three more years will remain of his contract. And he'll be making 200 grand/week. So he won't leave and no one will buy him. This has been the story of Man Utd for ten years now. We fill our squad with past-their-peek "name players" that we can't get rid of. And then we get told: "To buy, sell first."
Same old story .... What else United can do? Always hopefully awaited their match and this is the result... Shame on united squad... Jokes of the generation"They called themselves as football players"..
Mate if your unhappy with the way the club is run I’m sure you and all the man united fans can all put some money together and buy it 👍 am sure your old pal Mike Ashley will sort you out son 😂😂😂
To be honest I'm beyond caring.. why should I let these sorry excuses of players ruin my weekends.. why should we care when the players clearly don't...
It's not about a lack of talent, it's all about a lack of character... these guys have been, and will always be, bottle jobs...
Hahahaah :)
DE GEA looks like he's taken a dive payment. Maguire looks clueless and CR7 is looking for a lift out of there. Surprised he didn't go straight to LHR after the game. Lisandro I'm sure mouthed what have I done!!!. Glazers out man
So you going to apologise to ralf Rio you pagan.
. How did maguire raised to this level of his career? . How come he's our captain?      He's useless, rubbish.  He don't even deserve to be in the national team, i guess that's why England is getting nowhere in tournaments.              His awareness is poor, he can't even control his body useless.
ETH will go for breach of contract by the way he was lied to in accepting job. His reputation is being ruined and I can see him walking
What's the problem? United beat Liverpool preseason
Rio says the players aren't good enough, yet pretty much all of the starting 11 have proven themselves in the past either at Man United or at previous clubs. United are just cursed.
What more could the glazers have done an owners job is to give money to the people running football operations they have given a billion you lot annoy me man any excuse
Jose once said one of his biggest accomplish was coming 2nd in the league with United.. Let that sink in..
Maguire captained this side too 7 thrashings!! Shaw here for 7 years, rashford still gets chance after chance yet hasn’t played a good game in near 2 years, Fred and mctominay always guaranteed to play, why are these players still kicking a ball for United!!!
It's a neverending nightmare 🙈
You can blame the owners for hiring the wrong personnel but you def can’t blame them for not spending…..
Steve stop saying RUBBISH! What you mean by saying, You almost feel sorry for the players?” STOP THAT NONSENSE PLEASE!
We can comment on the defensive selection. Martinez and Shaw should have never been in that Defence for this game. It should have been Malacia Varane and Maguire and Dalot for this one.
Boycott old Trafford
I thought our pre season was good and the players were fitter than ever, I'm yet to see that fitness as no one them even run. Rashford and Sancho only good for putting out training trailers on social media and are the 2 most laziest players on the pitch. They are all shocking and need sacking one by one.
- Still the same team as last season - Dysfunctional players keep getting selected  - Manager tactically outsmarted in two games straight - CEO and sporting director clearly incompetent - We can't sell players – stuck with deadwood on long contracts/high wages - Horrendous transfer window – and probably getting worse/buying MORE deadwood - Owners who don't care This will end BADLY. Probably this season.
That point Rio made re: the Glazers coming to bask in the glory days, but conspicuous in their absence in recent years is salient. It reflects a character trait (stain) that now permeates down through the entire club. Nuff said.
Good to hear Rio talking about the Glazers👍
Stephen looks broken. It’s sore real sore to be a United fan in recent times.
We need a laporta
Can't pin blame on a single player, as a collective absolutely appalling, but full credit to Brentford.  Does Meguire enjoy captains privilege? I.e. if  fit he starts? Bailley was our best CB on tour, surely he should be starting? De Gea been in decline for 3 to 4 years, Brentford keeper is ahead of him in the Spanish pecking order!
The Glazers run us as a commercial entity. Not a football club. Thats why they dont give a toss because when it comes to social media, shirt sales, sponsorship revenue etc etc, they’re fine in their eyes. We could finish bottom half but if we don’t see a significant drop in those things then the Glazers will stay.
our young Academy players need chance.this manager talks about zidan Iqbal but we don't see him
Martinez 5'9 centre back playing in the premiership great recruiting for 45mil+ he must be worth 15mil now.
Come on guys.... Screw the players!!!  They don't have blood & desire playing for us!  Also coach... Isn't good enough (at least until now)   And the club needs G. Neville as the new owner 🤝😜
Ole was actually amazing when you see just how bad things are now! ETH tactics are weak. And he revealed in the last game that he probably didn't watch Brighton's style and patterns of play.  Brentford manager and players even said where the weaknesses would be in ManUtd, exactly what they expected, so they did their tactics.  Glazers - 10 years, 8 managers, random signings. £100 million a year taken out by the Glazers for their own pockets.  Imagine owning Manchester United and never going to matches.  Glazers out.
Emergency broadcast 😂😂😂
First person out that door needs to be Maguire, he’s uniteds worst defender of the premier league era, never mind captain!
#Glazers out
Why don’t we play the young kids Zidane, Garnacho garner etc..what do we have to loose? I think eth might have a case if he lost a game with the young lads
The solution for man u z to buy experienced premier league players
can United pls terminate some of this players contract for God sake.I nearly cry today when I was watching the game.because this is not the United we know
EMBARRASSING
All the other teams I premier League have upgraded. Only thing I've heard from United is character? Haha your neighbours Man city's B Team have  ore characters 🤣
I hope ETH now realises that Maguire and Shaw are just not good enough. Shaw had one good season and that was with no crowds. It's time to cut our losses and move on from these players. Now ETH has seen what we have all seen these past 12 months.   Absolutely heartbreaking to see our club torn apart by poor top management, poor recruitment and watch the ground and training ground fall apart.   #glazersout #emptyoldtrafford
Top division Football died years ago … no youth players come through ,,, huge wages ,, too much TV ,,, too many pundits … too many stats …. It is essentially American Football
The 17/18 Squad look like Legends right now
Also formation matters use 4 3 3
I would just get rid of all the first 11
Rio is right! Stop going to games, stop buying your shirts and kits! Stop  giving money.
Watching united players and fans complain about their recent failure after years of success. I'm only hosting because United are too proud of their accomplishments and achievements. This should humble them. The United Way? Haha
Who bought the players? LUHG
Damn, this match was enough to give Rio Ferdinand grey hair!
The glazers are not the type to care about others.
Get the Glaziers OUT OUT OUT
How can a team that has over 100 million fans in the world play football this way? It's a disgrace!!
so rio tell man utd fans what you told us geordies to buy the club  want the glazers out let your fans buy the club
Fcuk me..... the glazers have spent fortunes..., every year it seems Utd sign the dearest player available...pogba Sanchez sancho McGuire Lukaku.... Fred mikataryan Bruno baily lindelof and more... they didn't come cheap...ole is at the wheel....camel face Rio got what he wanted... what more do they want... Moyes Jose Van fat head OLE Ralph and now ten Haag...puzzled.
That’s not a team,this group of players have No chemistry,individual mistake all over the pitch,absolute nightmare..Some of these players can’t make a decent cross,not even a decent pass,wtf do they get paid for..
A bad day for MU
Man U are in massive debt which means the glazers are supporting the club with their own money. Everyone including Rio should be saying thank you.
Get Savage, Garner, Iqbal, Garnacho and if we can Hannibal on the pitch, there all can be Gems for the club, give them a chance !
You can't blame everything on the Glazers. These expensive players are horrible.
BANTERCHESTER OR MANJESTER n Eriksson at customer services like can I get a return please
Just seen Frenkies cameo vs Rayo.  Truat me xavi will not let him go just yet
WHO IS EMPLOYING THE CURRENT SCOUTS. THEY HAVE BROUGHT CHAMPIONSHIP LEVEL PLAYERS
L
Jamie blames the players and highlighted how many managers have taken the fall for these players. Jamie wanted Gary to agree that this was the main problem but Gary blames the owners (for "buying" the club not with their millions but loans from investment banks that are £100M per season in Interest plus the £40M the Glazers pay themselves in "dividends" which all adds to the debts. The millions that United spend on players isn't coming out of the Glazers pockets but is adding more debt of the club and all of this is paid for by the fan base and global commercial revenue which is dwindling. The Glazers have "backed" the managers but its always been too late and far too costly (Maguire and Sancho £160M?!). Now we are to believe that signing De Jong will transform the team when the reality is we need a whole new team who have quality. Don't even get me started on the current team. Today they ran 15km less than Brentford. Brentford strategies scoring from the second headers. Our 5'9" defenders got bullied by 6'3" opponents and our tall defenders were duped to be drawn for first headers when Brentford knew they could still win those duels and send the ball over the heads of our short defenders and score. Add naive goalkeeping of playing out from the back when it was too risky. We got our first corner after 65 minutes of play. It's relegation level at this point. Liverpool will be 7-0
rio pre season you were like,,,,WE ARE BACK pmsl hahahaha
United ruined Sancho s career now they going after Ten hags Frodo can not play at CB though may make a good LB
All the great sides over the years had amazing skill but all did work hard they worked for the shirt this bunch I wouldn't put in charge of emptying the bins at old Trafford
What is going on at man united is going to run down to the players, the club is completely fucked with the glazers in charge , it's more of a mess now than it has ever been , united will generally be looking at relagation this season,  the glazers need to go , this club is doomed with them at the helm
I really hope ETH has a plan.  Right now its not lookin good brevv
No You Can't!
Get your pal Ashley to buy the club. ;-)
Brentford 😂😂😂😂😂
Glazers are failed business family, their father (Malcolm) was the businessman . These six children are like Donald Trump, just blowing father's money.
Why would anyone come to use destoying the reputatians and careers with the glazers and this board.Ten Hag is the man i believe in him
You weren’t a great defender though, its all about Vidic. Manchester United should rely on their youths for now and stop talking about ur legacy which is fake.
Ste. After years and years of hugging the nuts of Rashford and all the England player, I hope you learned your lesson. You reap what you sow. Years of bollocking Jose when he was RIGHT. Only now are you figuring out what some of us have been saying for years.  "I don't mind calling out individual players". More like "I dont mind calling out individual players as long as they are not English, and as long as it means I can continue to undermine the manager to generate clicks" Biased twat
GLAZERS OUT
So who is more honest Ralph or Eric 🧐 so who do you trust one of them is lying 🫣
I heard next Season's shirt sponsor is going to be a fight between EASYJET and SPIRIT AIRLINES. Low Cost, Budget Service and Performance.
Respect to Mr Ferdinand ~ a legend that’s broken hearted, we feel you bruv.!! Seeing that game was soul destroying 💔
Why don't you ask Ten hag to put his hand in his pocket to buy players? In fact why don't you?
The glazers weren't on the pitch .
What difference does it make if the glazers are there they are not football people there just straight forward businessmen in it for the Yankee dollar💲💲
I am really really sad today!
Rio, 5 or 6 players aren't going  to change this team!   *The mentality at the club has been ERODED and that's the owners fault* . They have to go or CHANGE and fast too, else Utd is dead!  The team itself needs a CLEAN SWIPE- build it from the ground up with the right players and a manager YOU CAN STICK WITH.
😂😂🤡🤡 is it just me but ETH fucked up today big time ?? He hasn’t got a clue he’s winging it! Not doing his homework at all, he got the job by saying I can coach these players how arrogant is that fool 😂🤡🤡🤡🤡
Guess conte wouldn’t have been such a bad thing
IM HEARTBROKEN FOR TEN HAG
This is what happens when little boys get life changing money from 16 years old. I bet not 1 member of any club from U19s up nowadays has cleaned the senior players boots. They did it for a reason.  Man u are shocking fair play, but I think it's prevelent in all clubs. Man U are so big, it's noticed more but it's simply a case of those players today are not crap, they just have no heart. Little rich boys 💯
Stop pretending to be a Man Utd fan then
I am not going to panick nor overreact for such an anomaly (4 goals in 30 min ?! cmon now). I just want Erik to protect the team and   Shaw&Maguire by sitting out both against L'Pool then bring back Shaw against Southampton.
Football stopped being the "people's game" the moment clubs started charging insane amounts to watch a game and then rip them off at half time.
Harry Magoo is NO Leader and should be stripped of the captaincy
We can even score 1 goal lol.. I won't be around for a while as I'm hanging my head in shame lol
There are only so many managers you can throw under the bus before people realise what is going on. Surely the last days of the Glazers are coming
Well...blanking football until the 22nd
I'm meant  to be going to the match against liverpool. I'm not entering the stadium. I will protest outside.
That's the problem right there! Their business is doing well, they spent nothing and they're collecting regular dividends - why would they think business is bad?
Ex players needs to help utd fans get rid of glaziers
And there were people laughing at Ralf. Uniteds biggest mistake was letting him go and not putting him in as Director of Football.  Yes Ten Haag wanted to do it his own way but we’ve seen how amateurish Murthough has been. The players are all bottle jobs and are not up to the standards we as fans want from them.  The least we ask as fans is effort.  Please do not blame the manager again. It’s the players who cross that line. We’ve had numerous managers and the common theme …. Are the players.
Rio u were amongst the real united, God help them 🙏 😢 whatever has happened. We need the players that work as a whole. Don't remember dressing room bust ups between each other in your days.
The pundits haven’t helped though, so much negativity surrounding the club and the constant comparisons to the Fergie era. To have the cheek to say Conte isn’t the guy needed at Manchester United but Ole was is jokes! It’s a toxic environment that has been there due to the resistance of change and not getting over Ferguson no longer being the boss while the arrogance remains at Manchester United still to this day. Stop using Ronaldo as a cop out aswell. This is not news that the club is in a poor state.
So numb by now. Don't even want to watch my team anymore. Is it even my team anymore? Is this even real life? Good night.
To all current Man Utd Players: Do your best, and people may like it. Like what you do, and then you will do your best. The most important thing is, whatever you do decide to choose, take it seriously and do your best. Whoever is underperforming, should hand in their resignation and leave the club with zero compensation, if they had any self respect or dignity. How much damage are you doing as an individual player to your own career and future in the sport. The fact that you are staying at the club knowing you are not doing your best and then accepting the fact that you are damaging your own brand and career speaks volume about you as an individual. Absolutely Shocking. If it were your own business, then hang on for dear life. But the club belongs to the fans and you are disrespecting and disgracing them. The owners are a different and separate story.
Fans and Pundits: Utd can't get any worse this season. Utd players: Hold my beer.
People can see How crap Maguire is. But not the coaches. How is that???
Honestly everyone can keep criticising the players and managers. The ultimate problem remains the same. The Glazers. The ONLY way to make them sell is to not buy anything from the club. ANYTHING.
Bt you placed manchester ahead of chelsea 😁😁😁😁
O one has chased our players since Fergie. We have to give them away or keep them because we pay way more for mediocracy than other clubs.
Pick the best from the under 21s and under 18s and leave these over paid clowns in the car park, no pride or respect for the club or shirt
"5 or 6 players that would change fortune" Rio he got 3 he wanted. 2 more won't do it either meanwhile manager isn't even playing those players. Why send Garner on loan to "prove himself" for 2 spells and then sitting him when this team is dying for his skills. It's a combo of all things not one magic wand. 1) add 3-5 more players of quality and depth and move on from Frank 2) use the new players unless they prove useless like the others 3) play the youth since they are hungry 4) I'll take 4 nil loss if we make changes but today wasn't it and that's on the manager
The owners have to be here. Front and centre. I would be if MUFC was mine. Then you look at the business. Recruitment, funding, facilities, objectives, results. Starts with Recruitment though and united have been very poor. Hence 4.0 v Brentford as a example.
This is the kind of dialogue and critical content that is needed.
Rio we are in the mud, Absolute garbage.  £50 per week is too much for these players.  Bring the youths on at least they respect the shirt
There is teams below I can't even banter anymore, Yeah teams in the championship are below.
I say 76000 people need to stop going
This has been allowed to happen just like Chelsea’s blood money was and state run city. We have owners who have stolen the spirit from a great club. We still owe 500 million after 15 years and the owners have stolen ove 1.5 billion from it. Corruption for money, from the dirty FA to the fans. It stinks
Carrington, Old Trafford … everything and all facilities should be fully blocked by the fans for very, very long time..till the club is sold ! Should be all or nothing for united and the time is now!
I thought it was "Individual Brilliance" when things were going well. Now these players aren't good enough... These guys are lost.
The real kick in the teeth is those clown players will watch this and not give a damn, so if you're a United player and reading this, shame on you. Do the decent thing and just get out of the club. Play the kids and start from the bottom.
Smaller clubs love playing Utd because they have nothing to lose and they know Utd are vulnerable.
Hahahahahahaaha
Ste is 110% right.  We are a on one-way trip downwards with the arrival of these money-grubbing, parasitic mofos.  Fergie was able to keep things going but once he left the direction has been clear.  They are money people and they appoint money people (Woodward, Arnold) to run the club, not football people.  They know nothing about football and they care less just as long as they can keep skanking the club and filling their pockets.  Rio seems to want to lay the blame elsewhere - execs or whatever - but everything leads back to the Glazers.  They should be coming over here??  No, the only direction for them is out - out of this club because we will continue in this direction until they are good and gone.  A major campaign needs to start now to get them out.
some one said haven't see united play like this so bad since last weak
love this Rio, great seeing ex players with honest & passionate reactions
When I saw United's new kit I said they were trying to be invisible on the pitch and they literally did it and i think who chose this kit he the same person who scout player for united
That a boy Rio - about time. Very welcome and welcome to the resistance.
I'm sick of hearing about Bruno. He's had one good season. He's been absolutely S.H.I.T.E.
When United crash & burn, the Glazers don't have problem to sell it, even for $1 deal. But for sure they want the debt paid in full by the bidder side, else no deal happening. This is how evil they are. When they took the club, they're not spending a dime, they use bank loan. Then after succeed taken the club, switch their loan debt to become the club debt. If when they sell this club, they won't pay the debt with their own money. These how corrupt corporate taking over business. Evil can't create, they're corrupt.
Clubs lacks consequences. Guys put in $h!t performances and guess what...... they start the next game, without fail everytime.
How many are Liverpool going to put past us? Everyone is predicting double figures
UTD needs players that respect the manager, when you respect your manager and you do what he tells you to do, with the players UTD has, they should get at least a draw in every game, loosing shouldn't be an option, so in my opinion first thing to do for Ten Hag is to find a way to make his players respect him, really respect him
Maguire is my captain..... he is gonna live and die by that
The teams cursed no matter who you get in both player or manager they will have the same issues .
Glazers are doing a good job, this ten hag guy is a fraud, Bring back Ole....sack ten hag now..... Ronaldo is toxic
Sack Murtough. Get in Michael Edwards. Screw our pride. I’d rather win with the ex Liverpool sporting director who knows what he’s doing than be bottom of the league ran by muppets running our recruitment
Red devil's more like the dopey devil's!!!
Man Utd, you just got merked!
Chelsea have won more trophies than Manchester United for the last 20 years, let alone 10-15, but nice try though.
I can play more than rasford
Can't wait for the big 6
8 young men died for taking Manchester United to the top of European football. Since then The job for the owner and everyone part of the club is to keep it there. The Glazers have failed. They do not have the will to win. They do not have the knowledge, expertise or judgement to honour those young lads. It’s time to go.
how can you blame the glazers when theyve spent like 1.5 billion pound?
Ragnick said we needed open heart surgery needing 10 players, rio said he was gobbing off and needs to shut up. Fast forward 4 months later and the same players  same rubbish results.
This is the same Dope testing Dodger that told Nufc supporters to be grateful for Ashley. You reap what you sow Rio.
If Brentford had wanted to get 5 or 6 goals then they could have. They were conserving energy.
They don't care, its time to make them care. That Liverpool match is cancelled whether they like it or not
How is it the glazers fault.. this is bullshit..
SACK MAGUIRE AND GROUP WELL DAVID LOVES TO COST US GOALS THE WHOLE TIME TILL DATE …
When the players have no shame and are happy to pick up an obscene wage, this is the end result. Sub standard players who no team will want anywhere near their squad.
United as a club dont love the truth..ralf told it like it is and guess what he got sacked...an absolute disgrace
Nice one Steve / Rio 👍👍
Bruno is not good enough
R biggest problem is not getting over ferguson, we need the next generation an believe Iin ther leadership

You criticized Ralf for calling this out, Rio , instead of applauding him ….Nothing about Rashy, Maguire, Shaw ot Scottie . Can’t take these Man seriously
Rio sticking up for Ronnie cringe….
Ragnick said we needed 10/12 new players, and they got rid of him! They don’t give a dung about bringing United back to the top.
Start a campaign  to all Manchester United  fans across the world  to stop  buying Manchester United  shirts, stop going to old Trafford, stop watching MUTV and do this until the Glazers sell the club, we Know the only care about the money going in their  pocket.
Surely the glaziers should come over and start painting the stadium maybe change the colour, that will work
No coincidence that the same insipid performances have returned at the same time that Ronaldo come back into the squad and the dressing room. Don't know what it is but it's linked to him.
The biggest problem is they don't see any problem right now since they're getting their money which is what all they care about
"this is not the Manchester utd I once knew". All this bollocks about Utd being too good a club for this... It's been a decade of mediocrity.
The  club needs a public execution to send a message that this is unacceptable.  I don't care if it's a player, a staffer, an accountant, or a gardener.  Someone needs to pay the price.
You are no longer a top 6 team… get used to it!
It's bad when Brentford are smiling and having side conversations during the match because it's that easy. It was like an American high school team versus a professional team.
Everyone who isn't a moron knew it was going to be rough going given the utter shite we have in the squad. Anyone who thought otherwise needs shooting. We should all be willing to take this all on the chin if we played the youth players in the places of those players who have been dog shite for so many seasons since they literally can't be any worse and even if they are just the same then at least it will be cheaper...
HOW CAN YOU BE A UNITED PLAYER & NEVER BE ABLE TO SAY THAT YOU WON THE LEAGUE OR GOT TO A CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL?  MADNESS.
That was a tough watch for all the Man U fans, great for the rest of us.  Substituting Martinez after 45 minutes is a huge L. Those players look like they’re the ones to blame,that’s demoralising. Can anyone name a fighter on that side? One single player who digs deep no matter the scoreline and leaves it all on the pitch? I see a team of quitters and prima donnas, spoiled entitled children unfit to lace the boots of their predecessors.
"When does it end RIO" 🤣
A laughing stock - no divine right to win anything - Utd are just another team of 20 in the top flight. No club is above others in terms of a right to win.
OLD Slevery lips is right,.
What kind of players is this they can't change on less they sell Maguire, Fred, mctominy, Dalot, look shaw, Bruno, wan bissaka, rashford, Elanga they all need to leave now de gea out
Such dumb thing to say about watching while driving 🤣 yeah, passenger seat, of course.
Not sure why people say it's the Glazer's fault. The amount of money they have spent on players is huge. £450mil starting line up v Brentford's £55mil. The Man United players should be dominating the match. I can only assume there is no team bond, therefore no desire to work for their team mates. Having Maguire as captain doesn't do us any favours as he shouldn't even be in the starting line up.
The real reason why we will never be successful under the Glazers is because they will not employ people in key positions who aren't happy with Glazernomics. Would someone like Michael Edwards or Paul Mitchell be satisfied being given a budget of 60-70m? No. Hence why we are stuck with the likes of Murtough and Arnold - puppets who won't question the owners but are completely inept at their jobs.
see rio we need to sell rashford it's facts he's been our most poorest player harry maguire also
over-haul is the ONLY and ONLY solution for ETH to make Man United an effective and efficient team to compete in the top 4 and win trophies. 80% should not be offered new contracts and shown the door.
That's simply not correct from Rio that Erik has been let down.  Erik said HIMSELF first press conference he was taking over a team that finished 2nd the year before and had the nuclears to strengthen within.  He knew he would not be supported like Ragnick said was needed.  The owners simply fired Rangnick and threw the problems over to the next manager that knew very well his job.  He didn't know how bad things were for sure - but he knew his job.
Your the only channel i listen to Stephen you talk sense
The glazers bought the success, they just can’t buy the success, and I’ve stopped blaming the players and managers, Its the grounds men and fans fault for expecting to much
It's time to stand up and be counted for. All you legends all you that have a voice say what needs to be said about the parasites that are the glazers. Show how much you really care about the club. GET THEM OUT. STADIUM ROTTING SQUAD IS FULL OF SNAKES AND PLAYERS HAPPY TO TAKE THE MONEY AND FK OFF. WE ARE BANG AVERAGE AT BEST.
WE ARE NOT A FOOTBALL CLUB ANYMORE
First change Utd need to make get rid of maguire
There's a harsh reality for United fans to face about ten hag. Brentford and Brighton are winnable games, coachable surely...yes the glazers are bad owners, that is the dark side of capitalism for you. All football club owners at top level are corrupted, this isn't anything new. Ole would have been slaughtered for this game. Why isn't it the same treatment for Erik? A man who has thus far done nothing for United either as a player nor manager....
Yes Rio you are 💯
We need to stop saying the players dont care. They do care. They're just really really bad. The sooner we accept that the sooner we can accept that no amount of coaching will improve them and we need to recruit better players
Can't forget you offered to sign Welbeck if you were the gaffer.
"A coach CANNOT Perform Magic" Erik Ten Hag. "Manchester United is a Commercial club NOT a football club" Louis Van Gaal. Manchester United needs an "Open Heart Surgery" Ralph Ragnick. I arrest my case. #Manutd4sale #glazersout🔰 #Ragnickin
Get used to the abuse ferdinand  its gonna be a L O N G    Season
The ridiculously high wages United  give to those average players is an essential part of the problem.
Spot on lads
These players are Sabotaging each other, they all want to sink together. I don’t think these players United fans deep down. It’s just work for them. You can tell how they don’t run and not passionate. They try play like 5 aside game and see how it goes.
Go on then Rio. I dare you to tell the Man United fans to band together and buy the club off the owners like you did with Newcastle.
We can all agree that we don't want to see that third kit😅😅 anymore 🗑️💯
Shambolic Performance. Where are those 3 points are coming from? Which team United can beat ? Next is Liverpool.
Stop with this Glazer bs  Players need to take responsibility Every time MU loose we blamed Glazers I guess if we win we going to thank Glazers?
Well done ste. Rio and co been in the dark for ages
Klopp once said he doesn’t want to buy players to jump on the train, he wants to buy players to help push the train! Everything that United have gone against in the last 10 years
Remember a year or two ago when Crystal Palace released most of the first team and stated again? Maybe we should just take it on the chin, release them and play the new signings and just play the kids. It can't get much worse than this
Rashford, Sancho and Bruno have been ghosts for the first 2 games. Phantoms. No quality or bravery in attack. We were just chucking crosses in to Ronaldo.  The defending is panicked. Anxiety everywhere.
I think that man u fans should all band together to buy the club if they’re unhappy with the owners, good idea isn’t it rio
Man Utd is such a commercial powerhouse it seems that the owners are content with what’s going on as the revenue will still be huge, but I understand the point and it’s such a shame to see how far such a great club has fallen
you people keep doing the same thing and expect different result,thats just crazy,you have a relegation captain and a empty midfield and a graveyard frontline ,what expect ,you have players who dont actually pass to each others
See you at the QPR vs United match next season Mate 😂👀
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Work hard positive vibes
Glazers will not leave unless something drastic happens. Such as boycotting home matches until the glazers say publicly that they will sell the club. Abramovich was forced to sell in a different manner but he built that club into what it is now. That was his baby.  Glazers don't care, we can hurt the glazers where it hurts, in their pockets. Over the long term, it would be the best thing. If only a few thousand fans attend home games for the rest of the season, that would send a huge message and they would have to speak on it rather than keep quiet. The super league, the transfers, the lack upgrading facilities, the disconnect with the supporters, the debt, it is untenable to keep these owners.
Glazers are the scapegoats now. United spent more money than anyone else what else do they want 😂😂😂😂
Like CLEARLY Maguire isn’t captain material, he’s not good enough, during his captaincy he’s resided over the worst United displays in decades! Maguire, Fred, McTominay, Shaw, Dalot, all mid table premier league players now at best!
I just don’t think your club captain can’t be someone who’s biggest achievement is playing in a euros final.
you need leaders. you have none. captain, manager, board, owner. none are real leaders. ten hag, maybe too early, but seeing him sat down as goals go in isnt a good luck.
Howson is clueless, don't blame the players? Do me a favour
Ronaldo mctominay rashford Fernandez and more need to go absolutely***** clueless
Baily + Varane need to start against liverpool ....Martinez is a CDM not EPL CB !! Shaw, Bruno and Maguire OUT !!
Why cant our players run out of possession. Why??. It is mind boggling that they dont run and track back. What the hell is going on????
Rio talking about the Glazers was embarassing! That's all he has to say? That they are not showing their faces? This is someone who cannot talk honestly about these guys or does not think they are all that bad. Sorry! The video does not make sense anymore after hearing that. This is just some tv show that now is on youtube....censored. I prefer listen to Howson by himself.
Playing Christian Eriksen as a DM lol
What a game really enjoyable , i love this game
🔴😶
It’s all the glazers.  Every one complaining about the players you’re right but they’re a symptom of the real issue.  We can switch the manager, the starting 11, the DOF and none of it would matter as long as they’re in charge
The glazers have changed the entire management of the club in the last 6 months.   They have spent a billion on players. They've paid the highest wages in world football.   What more can they do?  I blame Woodward more than them.
Rio you said United would get top 4 😂😂😂
The fletchers and coach's in there are clueless. Man utd don't have people who know how to spot winners
It is just soul destroying to think how far we have fallen. We have overpaid, weak minded players who don’t know how to win - except Ronaldo. Ragnick was correct - open heart surgery required. We will continue to struggle until we are under new, solid ownership.
Shaw , Maguire , Mctominay , Fred , De Gea , Ronaldo , Rashford , Bissaka , Lindelof all have to go.  We need 10 new players period.  Fact that we brought 3 and 2 were almost free is a bloody joke.  We lost 8 players. Greenwood also gone.  Club is finished , its finished. Pressure is too much now and season is done mate.  Liverpool will destroy us
I think united fans should take a stand and make a big statement by boycotting games at Old Trafford.
Such a flaccid performance from this team.  The majority of those players have 0 fight in them.  It's crazy how little effort they make and how they just don't seem to care.  Ronaldo was the only 1 getting angry but idiots in the media will say that's a bad thing.  They should all be furious with the way they and their team mates are playing but they just don't care.  Clear out this useless squad.  Rangnick was right.  The Glazers won't let it happen though.  They need to go as well.  Done supporting this shitty team until this shower of losers are gone from the club.  They have already thrown ETH under the bus because they don't like him trying to make them work harder.  Maguire our captain standing there with a stupid expression instead of cursing his team out of it and trying to fire them up.  Get rid of these overpaid, lazy, slow losers who don't want to work for the badge or their salary.  Wake up call time.  Hairdryer treatment and a halving of all salaries.  If they don't like it, then leave.
What you've run out of people to blame? Your Ronaldo sucks. Your maguire is the worst professional footballer. Fred is another joke. Your Fernandes just signed a new 250k contract. Your new manager will get the exact same results no matter who he signs.
And we are gonna bring in Rabiot FFS
United ran 95km Brentford ran 111km absolutely shocking stats.
Rangnick without experience become a coach 5 years & Ten Hag is one of the best coach right now.. Rangnick choose Ten Hag & Ten Hag indicate doesn't need him.. Its Board choice they trust Rangnick (United need heart surgery & 10 new players) ot Ten Hag (Give second chance to players). Experience tells everything & Rangnick is rights. Sell them all & start New Era.
I think we’re beyond the phase where it’s just embarrassing. The current state of the club, on and off the pitch, is indicative of disaster brewing. The players are playing and signing to earn a good paycheque, they don’t care about the badge. The owners are doing the same thing, happy milking cash out of the club. There is only one way through this, and it is down down down.
I haven’t seen Man United play this bad since last week
The Glazers have turned Man U into a cheaper than Macdonalds cheap snack. Not good enough.
The Glazers got rid of Ralf Rangnick because he spoke to the truth. That shows everything that’s wrong with us
We need to actually protest at Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Rashford and Sancho can’t beat a player 1-1. The defence is in complete shambles this is a terrible team.
It’s rotten from top to bottom and the glazers have never out any of there own money in and have used Man Utd as a massive cash cow !!! That said that team may be one of the worst Man Utd teams ever but it’s still full of internationals and shouldn’t be getting turned over 4-0 by Brentford ???
I love how he realised he nearly incriminated himself by admitting to watching a football match whilst driving 😂. "I nearly crashed the car"....uh uhhh and I was in the passenger seat" 😂
Rioooooo👏👏👏a true red ❤️
Scared FC
Start Malacia, Garnaucho, Garner, Varane, Laird/Williams, Heaton, Iqbal, McNeil instead of these overpaid stars.
Sure , Dave made a mistake ... But the team has to bounce back amd have belief.  Ralf Rangnick said it well , its an open hard surgery.  For this manager and his style of football , they have to get him the players needed.  We dont have the players that can keep the ball .  Ship has sinked.
this team is a Subbuteo team, they get in position and just stand there
Ten Hag has to stop playing these clowns and give the youngsters a chance.
Let me make something clear, you are talking about recruitment but if I'm not mistaken you were the one that on TV screaming to give Solskjaer an open contract? isn't you right? So, what makes you even better than the owners or board? You are at the same level of nonsense Rio.
Ahh the therapy session about the Glazers starts now 💀💀💀
Love how United fans refuse to blame Ten Haag when he’s had a shocking start
Sack Murtough, yesterday. Imagine thinking you know recruitment better than Ralf Rangnick.
Ten Hag is clueless about English game...and looks like he is coward too
My question is who put Richard Anord and John Martough in those sensitive positions. Those two clowns are clueless and should resign on moral grounds.
Yup.  We're a joke now.  We're a relegation level side now.  It's crazy.  Everything about the club is broken and rotten.
Can't blame the manager, I feel sorry for him. The players have no leadership, Maguire has resided over countless thrashings against all levels of opposition from Watford to Liverpool and claims he's good enough because every manager keeps picking him. Only leader on the pitch is CR7 and he wants to leave and no one can blame him. We'd will keep falling if we weren't 20th. 7 away defeats in a row, 4 defeats in a row, 3 managers in the last 12 months with no different results. It's clearly the ownership and the players, DO THEY NOT HAVE ANY SHAME?!?
Honestly? I'd rather the midfield was zidane iqbal, savage and hannibal  Get rid of maguire. Just terminate his contract. How was he ever considered captain material?   Who the f is John murtough and what qualifies him for his job.  Useless.
Erik tea bag shagger gone by September COYG
The team lacked no spirit, no leadership, no enthusiasm. It’s embarrassing to be a supporter. It’s been going on wayyyyyyy to long. How many more managers, players is it going to take????   What should be allowed is the players sit with the supports say in the training ground and see how much it is disappointing us as fans. We have a fantastic bunch of lads but we need to bull something out of their asses and soon before the championship beckons.
United getting bullied out there lol
All former United players should be forming a coalition against the Glazers. Make you're voices heard. If Rio, Scholes, Beckham, Evra etc. stick their neck out TOGETHER and say enough is enough you'd amplify the message that this isn't going away
#glazersout
Imagine going back on filthy fellas on the back of this. As an arsenal fan this is hard to watch. This is worse then a fall from grace this is a joke
it wasnt just 4-0  it was 4-0  first half
We need to keep the faith only 6 points behind with 36 games to go🙄
All these words when the answer is simple. Clear out
I can't banter the teams below....   Rio,  there ARE no teams below
It's the same core group for 3 plus years,  there over hyped,  over paid,  mentally weak bottlers.  A reflection of their captain as well.  Shaw, Maguire, Dalot, Fred, McTominay, Bruno,  Rashford,  and even Sancho all have no business starting, some shouldn't even make a Manchester United bench. They've had chance after chance, and regardless who the manager is they still start and these mugs the Glazers resign them for more money as fast as they can
So Rio, what about that Ralf Rangnick huh? Still think he was wrong to say what he said? Hmm...
Man utd and Everton relegated
Rio! you wanted Ragnick out of the club for saying the truth about this shitty players. Who is right or wrong now?
shoutout to all the people who abused ronaldo for wanting to leave this mess, shameless
United’s recruitment has looked at big name signings or overpaying ONE player than doing volume signings. Arsenal last season bought 6 players and bought 5 this year. We have no CDM, RW and a proper RB.
Almost crashed the car in the passenger seat 😭😭😭
WTF honestly we need a clear out at our club....it's just amazing that we have players in our team that just shut out at a lil sign of pressure...it's baffling that we have had 8 player's that left the club and signed 3...we need 5 more signings that need to immediately get into the starting 11 ....also where are the goals going to come from oly from Ronaldo...??? He should leave and stop playing with mediocre players it's astounding to see man u at this level where we battered clubs left right centre now we being made fun off... Shame.
Not one of them player play fir the badge it’s a joke.
Man United fan saying Brentford and Brighton are not easy games...u wot mate?😂
Lads still thank you for putting on this live for us. Rio <3 how United misses characters like you.
And liverpool's next......yikes 😂
I'd love Roy Keane to have an hour alone in the changing rooms with these cowardly, spineless, overpaid wastes of space
Embarrassing doesn't even begin to describe how awful them players are. Ralf was right, and was sacked for telling it like it is.
Right. Enough is enough. Time for season ticket holders to boycott games. There is no point going into the ground and chanting Glazers out. They already have your money.  The ground needs to be boycotted. Swathes of empty seats game after game after game. The media focus would be detrimental to the Glazers. This needs to be the focus now.
The Ronaldo effect....
Rio we are in the worst time ever
Remember wat u said about mike Ashly, keep the same energy dog
These players aren't fit to wear the Jersey
Malacia looked like he belonged, he looked like he ain't scared, he looked like he's ready and yet Ten Hag didn't start him, baffling.
Don't worry Rio I thought you said Richard Arnold is going to change things around 😂 absolute muppet! 🤣 The fanbase have been saying for ages that the glazers and board need to all go, they're all the big issue here and nothing is going to change until they sell the club!
Poor Rio 😮‍💨
Goalkeeper responsibility
Ruin my weekend fc lool
This unbelievable 😳 with Bretenford football ⚽️ not like before coz many players gambling money is honey dosnmatter about fun !!!
Glazers aren't the problem if crap players are signed and given salary high enough that they stop giving a toss about football. This then results to players not wanting to come - they finalised a deal for FDJ w Barcelona but the player himself doesn't want to come.
Ragnick was correct
RIO wanted Rangnick out of the club last season when he spoke against the players and said we needed new players to the media.
Evening lads 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lasting this long at the top half of the prem table last season was a miracle for these players because I can't believe that MY CLUB would put up a decent fight against any of the other squads. Norwich would run a field day against us.
We're so crap
No balls or character in this team. Sad Times for fans. Feel for the school kids that will be dreading Monday Mornings when they go back to school 🙈
“And I was in the passenger seat”…yeah sure Rio
FIRST Hi RIO HI GUYS #GGMU
Should've got rid of half the scumbags on the pitch today..thats ETH biggest mistake
Glazers out, forever and always! 🔰
