i think it'l be gr8 somepf thwe heavywieghts are getting up there in years if they fpught and quit trying to duck each other it'd be evn better
OOOh Anthony Joshua!!!!…….win or lose, I ride with AJ, my favorite athlete 💪🥊
It's funny looking back on him dissing AJ's opponents so much although they did way better than Ngannou did against Joshua.
Glass Jaw Ngannou LOL
Correct, all the other guys he fought were professional boxers.
A total feelings based preview video of the AJ vs Ngannou fight, an absolute dumpster fire of nonsense, wishful thinking, and delusions, totally exposed after the brutal KO of Ngannou.
This aged like Brain 🧠
This seems so ridiculous in hindsight now that AJ steam rolled Ngannou like he was a toddler in kindergarten !
All the MMA fanboys were more wrong than anyone could have imagined. Pathetic. Easiest “fight” of AJ’s life. Didn’t break a sweat slaughtering Ngannou.
This fella make his predictions on his feelings and not on rational viewing of the facts
Geordie you have egg on your face now , it will take a very long time for you to rebuild your boxing knowledge reputation now
Can’t wait to be here tomorrow night. I enjoyed watching this channel Geordi
..But i ve got little bit of hope🔥🫣🔥
Francis is a real fighter if I was AJ I'd get a cut like tyson
Anyone betting on Ngannou to beat Joshua needs a head examination. Fury carried Ngannou for the last 2 rounds and increased his landed punches 29% > 31% > 34% > 42% for last 4 rounds. AJ was throwing around 50 punches a round for all of the last 4 rounds against Usyk in the rematch and that was over 12 rounds.   I am not disrespecting Ngannou - he is a strong and big stiff tree of an old man and will be easily hit by a drilled boxer with proven history.  These are exhibition fights only and unless AJ ends up counted out then he'll also get a close decision, which it won't be. 2/7 AJ is better than any savings club.
Yeah hes a freak of nature but also juiced. But so is joshua... lol so i dont care Both have lost. Joshua has... lets say it this way.. i dont believe he wins. IF.. well good for him and then he  looses against Tyson and his career is at the end. :D No way. THIS is just a f... money laundrey event it has 0 to do with Boxing
This fight is actually so exciting Francis story just got even more interesting 🔥🔥
Francis 👑 is a GOD! I'm more of an MMA guy You don't understand the Devastation he's gonna unleash on Boxing! Flee, Run, Hide.  He's Coming...👊🏿💪🏾
14:42 love that banter
I don't know if there ever was a fighter such as Francis. Chin that's never been cracked despite being in small glove fights+ a power that's unimaginable
Ngannou = quick learner. And he might stick around for a few years, HW can stay competitive longer than lower classes. Guy is going to be ripped an a menace for this fight.
Nobody is like Francis, no one has that history of resiliency, strength and superation. but Anthony is 100% a great boxer. Very, very interesting fight they put up.
I can see Francis being like Foreman and Walcott.What I mean by this is that these guys, in their late 30's, posed a massive threat to the division.  Walcott fought the best of his era and made a great accounting for himself. He was heavyweight champ at 38 or 39 and was considered the toughest opponent for the undefeated Rocky Marciano. Foreman came back into boxing at the age of 38 and was twice the fighter he was in his youth. he regained the title at age 45
True Geordie i,d like to know what you're prediction is ?, you have just spent 15 minutes telling everyone the good & bad points of each fighter, & at the end of it you did not pick a winner, "I love A.J., but i really like Ngannou", dont sit on the fence pick 1 ? ? I,m picking Ngannou by late k. o.
Saudis  buy your morals and rights
Aj looks like he lost lot of muscle mass....
Funny how people think Naganu  will ko joshua  just because  he dropped furry😅 aj his harder and throws better combinations  and his chin is better then fury Aj been hit by Dr steel hammer Wladimir and sure he lost to ruin but that was not chin hit on side head and drill got up  fury been dropped by Cunningham  and Neem who are cruiserweight 😅 Aj speed and power will be touch for naganu Aj in 8 by tko
Totally Agree!! I want Francis to Win Convincing or Ko but  am alwways  an AJ fan !
Wallin is a fraud and a quitter all the talk got an opportunity and never showed up than went to the cook out a skied in the alps expexribg support huge let down you 💩 all over sweeden hope you happy with the mo wy you earnt you have no honour
He won't lay a glove on aj all thoe he beat fury
I love how true geordie says aj can only go off the 10 rounds with tyson fury RIGHT AFTER he watched aj said say he watches some of ngannou's mma fights against better stand up opponents instead of grappling
275 lbs Andy Ruiz was Heavier than 265 lbs Ngannou. AJ has experience with someone of similar size. Yes he lost the 1st match than Destroyed Ruiz in the 2nd leg/match.
Lets go Francis!! Undisputed Heavyweight Champion and Lineal UFC Heavyweight Champion!
I cant take MR Turkey serious, he comes across as a Sasha Baren Cohen character
Easy knockout for Francis
On paper: this fight sounds like the fight between Ngannou and Rouzenstruik. One is a master of technique and speed, the other is a ballistic missile attached to a wrecking ball.   In practice however: I also think it ends the same way Ngannou vs Rozenstruik did. And if you haven’t seen it, take a few minutes out of your day to watch it. It’s spectacular.
What will be interesting for me is to see how much Ngannou has learnt from being trained by Tyson.  Unfortunately I won't be watching the fight because I don't agree with these fights being staged in Saudi Arabia
If Francis cuts to 255 and becomes agressive without being impatient,he will win this fight
Usyk fury fight is dead until proven otherwise 😢
here's another perspective on Joshua beating Fury's opponents more effectively than the Gypsy King - Fury destroyed Klitscho's aura of invincibility, Joshua mopped up the beaten remains; Fury (apart from an eye cut) beat Wallin all round the ring and destroyed his belief that he belongs in the top level, Joshua again mops up what's left of him.
If Ngannou beat AJ, the internet will break in half.😅
Francis actually started out a boxer😊
I got AJ by stoppage..8 rounds.. will look like Mayweather v McGregror..
As an FBA Yank, I want to see the “Predator” Francis Ngannou deliver that same vicious uppercut to AJ that he put on Alistair Overeem, sending AJ to the Night Realm. 😈😈😈
Your are the tesla of boxing content and podcasts  the pain game is the business absolutely brilliant
AJ is a soft fighter. I don't see him withstand ngannou
AJ going to box and run as he did  with Andy Ruiz. He ran from that fat guy all night. To me it was a boring fight. Ngannou is a different guy and going to chase Anthony and knock him out. AJ has never met any one like Ngannou. We shall se.
He get shown for what he is a one off fighter
He trained boxing , fighting all his life , does that not count
Behave, Geordie: you're talking like Ngannou has never boxed before; he's a big, hard striker with 20 MMA matches to his name?!
Damn money makes the world go round
Hahahahaha all you AJ fans are in for a shock! 😂 Boom!💥
I'm in the same position as you , a massive AJ fan but n'ganou's journey is too special to wanting him to lose so it's going to be a tough one but I want ngannou  to win
ARTUR BETERBIEV
The arab dude in begging looks like he lost all money from his Clan on his name 😂😂
Come on. Ngannou can not box. He looked terrible against fury, which says alot about fury 😂 but come on now. He looked a mess. A.j 100% will beat him with ease. If you cant see that you shouldnt follow boxing
Ngannou is a machine. As one imaginary boxer once said... "It aint how hard you hit, it's how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward...". My money is on Ngannou
It's not how hard you hit, rather how hard you can be hit
True geordie so you're telling us you're a fuckin turncoat then?. I cannot believe you're up for ngannue when Joshua has gone through so much you've just lost a viewer.
I am DREADING when Joshua gets on the mic 🎤 in the wake of his own defeat to Ngannou.  Pure Cringe
I don't predict fights usually but I find it ridiculous that some commentators are still talking about Ngannou being an MMA fighter with no boxing experience, when he started as a boxer and switched to MMA. Ngannou is a freak, and I mean that in a good way. I think he'll comfortably beat AJ.
aj will wipe the floor with him within 6 rounds fury didn't even train and only went down as he was off balance it's another circus
I like the prince’s table cloth. I wonder who he stole it from.
I think ngannou is going to look a lot better in this fight with the experience he got, and the continued training hes gone through, but AJ could school francis. Francis usually ends up shocking the world though hes known to do that.
Think aj will try and jab francis whole fight but aj has to be extremely careful of the uppercut of francis from the inside
Don't sleep on Ngannou...he just needs one clean shot. He's not even at his peak yet. I wouldn't be surprised if he sends Anthony to the Shadow Realm. Keep in mind he already knows everyone thinks Anthony is gonna knock him out, so he's gotta  prove otherwise.
After Fury postponing undisputed again, this is the fight I'm waiting to see.
AJ will Finish Francis by round 4
When Francis puts a left hand in Joshua face that's when Joshua goes in fear mode, Francis will stop Joshua for sure,
Thts how people are who talk to much
If he means a 37 yr old novice with limited boxing skills, then yes, Geordie is correct.
Joshua legs when he walks is liue tyson fury. Where nganno has normal standing positions
The wrestling skills from mma is the key to winning
Damn Right..About  The Losers  facing  each other  before  before  this  kingdom 's ideas  of the undisputed..its gonna  build  it up.. make it on the same night..
It's going to be a sticky one . but my man don't  stand a chance period.😂
Every other UFC fighter thats tried to box can't even beat Jake Paul . Francis battered Tyson fury this geezer is a one off freak of nature .
Problem for aj would probably be ngannou switching stances will be difficult to read ngannou then
If this is the old aj it will be hard for ngannou and if ngannou plays it safe until he has a opening I think ngannou can ko aj
Anthony Joshua focused in his saddle bending his knees while punching like in the Dillion fight wins handsomely I'm a AJ fan, but Francis is raw more technical than most think, in the fury fight Francis didn't know what pace to fight at as it was new territory, now Francis knows what 10 rounds feels like, Joshua is in for a serious nights work, if Francis goes for it Joshua will get ko'd. Mark my words!
I'm not a fan of this turkey. I find it creepy how they are all sucking his ass. He's disrupting the sport. An undisputed belt for the winner of usyk /fury and AJ / ngannou? The undisputed is usyk v fury.
Aj is scared and won't let go his punches let them go go go.
I love Nagannou. He really is a nice guy. He is a naturally strong man and one of the strongest heavyweights ever. I think aj beats Nagannou, but he has a punchers chance, and I say good luck to him.
Francis body has been trained to get rough kicks and hands. Which AJ doesn't have.
We have a clear difference between both fighters. Francis had the body fo an MMA fighter, but the hands of a figher. Giving an upper hand.
N will will 🏆 against AJ . Francis is like a  🦏  & AJ is like a 🦬 😮
I thought we were gonna leave Captain Obvious in 2023...  but here TG has clearly hired him to write his fucking video titles.  Unless you have fought FnG already, no one has fought anyone like FnG. He's a freak of nature....  TG, if you need someone who can write propa title, hmu
I stopped liking AJ when he went all public PR perfevt boy, lost all his anger. But seems like with ben he is getting his anger back and its good to see.   U cant dislike nganu tho, where he has come from to now is incredible.   I think if it goes to points AJ wins but i don't see it going that far
You would never best khabib or betterbiev mentally... they are conquerors
AJ is Stragetic
No one has explained this situation better than this guy great little powerful video
speed kills
For sure francis ngannou will take this opportunity 😅😅😊i can bet my ass on that
Yeah more than likely, But Ngannou has a little bit more than just a punchers chance!
Sheesh AJ's a big boy!
Everyone is expecting a winner what if the fight ends in a draw or a no contest? Although quite remote its a possibility
Thank you so much my brother really  this is the best and fair reaction that I have ever seen absolutely the one and only comparable ones are dc and Jo rogan masha allah alhamdullilah allahu akbar subxanallaah tabarakallah the world needs people like you and dc and Jo rogan allah bless you 4ever Mr pain game is the man from somalia
Geordie has good point
Geordie talking nonsense again.. You dont beat the goat Jones, you are never the MMA goat.. Just talk boxing enough.
AJ loses before the 3rd round.
AJ does not have a good chin that's were his problem lies, he is also slow to recover when down.
I wanna see aj wipe the floor with him then i wanna see furys face
Francis is a fucking BEAST! AJ better watch his chin. 🤣 🤣
Aj tokk flush punches from dr steel hammer himself he can take a punch . Imagine the force behind a Andy Ruiz left hook he’s a monster
When you can crack like Francis with great timing anything can happen. Every heavyweight can crack
i think aj walks thru francis
Promotors dreams
Aj getting put to sleep here  😂 ruiz done aj so what's ngannou gonna do to him... aj ain't as slick as fury he gonna be in big trouble here ngannou takes this all day
Cyril gane faster on hus feet then aj and Francis wooooped him
seriously, Fury was well off vs nagannou, and he isnt the big puncher he thinks he is, AJ will ruin Ngannou, its a mis match.
Francis will past same foreman 1974 with Ali mark my word
after this fight Joshua  will not be the same enymore,it will be to much.....
You seem to forgot in your visualizations mate that Stipe BROKE Ngannou!!!! BRUTALLY in their first fight, the fight could and should have been stopped several times, Stipe PUMMELED Ngannou and the ref (paid off) didn't stop it. Yes Francis KO'ed Stipe in the second fight and would DESTROY AJ and Fury in MMA ON THE SAME NIGHT...but...Mate speak some truth in your posts and refresh your casual fans..Anyway if Francis lands just one punch on this man it's over.
Aj stops him within 5 the MMA fighter steps out of boxing never to fight again
👍👌👏
As a Nigerian am seeing as Nigerian vs Cameroonian but for some reason, i want Francis to win some how. call me traitor lol
I cant even argue with this Geordie he's spot on.
Bro Francis has thought very strong and ferocious people in his career. One of them is Alistair Overeem. AJ has never thought someone of that caliber
Not a chance Josh will school him
I like both but I’ll be rooting for ngannou
It's gonna be fun, but I think we need to take a step back. FN fought the worst version of Fury we've ever seen, to a draw. Everyone, especially AJ, is gonna take him very seriously from here on out. It's likely to be a very different fight this time against an in-shape, athletic heavyweight.
My bro Francis got elbowed clean by "their" champ Fury and ate it like  nothing. With his patience and skills i think AJ is gonna get a welcome to Africa ☝🏾✊🏾
lol, hands down, the best take on the whole match up between AJ and Ngannou.
What? One of the 4 championship belts was from the great Vlad Klitschko. Another from Josef Parker. Francis is a warrior, no question. He is an awesome man! AJ with a great coach like Suger Hill would be unbeatable.  Show some respect...
You need to do a video about michaela Mayer getting absolutely robbed by jonas last night,  that is a pure skid mark on the sport how corrupt that decision was
By round 3 , Fury was on the deck but got back up as he has a good chin. If (and I see no reason why we wont) Francis catch's AJ with one of then shots .. I see this fight not going the distance , Francis leaving the ring victorious by a KO by round 8 .
Joshua's speed, i never looked fasy against usyk
AJ will win  AJ should use Makhmudov and Barkole as sparring partners.  They are both raw, can be outboxed but have extreme strength and power.
Ngannou smashe's Joshua no problem.
IF A.J. CAN KEEP HIS GLASS JAW OUT OF THE WAY ,HE MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE, .......I THINK NGANNOU WILL BE CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER.......I HOPE HE CAN BE BAILED OUT IN TIME FOR A REMATCH WITH JELLY BELLY
fury / joshua should be in england it’s for the fans
as a AJ fan i dont want him  to loose his 4th fight but i dont want francis to loose 2 times in a row. fury needs to be humbled and weather francis wins or loose he has 2 fight uysk
It’s go na be fun to watch, good luck to both of them
ANTHONY JOSHUA WILL EASILY BEAT NGANNOU THIS TIME,, NGANNOU IS AN AMATEUR  HE GOT LUCKY WITH TYSON FURY,  FURY FOUGHT NGANNOU COLD, HE DIDN'T HAVE VIDEOS  TAPES OF HIS BOXING ABILITIES,,, KNOW ANTHONY JOSHUA  GOT THE VIDEO  TO DICEPT ALL  NGANNOU FLAWS,,,?
Boxing is now wwe
I think Aj will nock out Frances
Yea just like how everyone was disappointed how bad Spence did against Crawford
Ngannou hadn't fought in nearly 2 years prior to debuting against Tyson Fury.
AJ runs clean with god on his side. Ngannou DEVIL is running too.🫡👋🏻
AJ will get ko.
Even Tyson fury has said privately that ngannou is a harder hitter than wilder.
I think AJ smashes him
The fact that Francis is in his thirties I believe is irrelevant. He hasn't been in contact sports that long and doesn't have the wear and tear that a typical Combat Sports athlete would have by his age. I actually think it's to his advantage.
I always assumed AJ always has headphones on because he has a beats sponsorship
He's never fought anyone dececent, full stop. Beaten by a man half his size and kept away from the top fighters all his career.
Agree with everything in this video. I can’t wait for the show down
You’re not wrong at all
People will finally realize that Francis should have being in boxing a longtime ago after this fight against Joshua, Francis gonna knock Joshua spark out, he know now he's not gonna get a decision by the judges who is trying to preserve boxing, Ngannou is going to send shock wave throughout the sport of boxing.
I'm happy for his getting paid and I'm extra glad he embarrassed that overrated clown Tyson fury.   Still, AJ will do the business fury should have done instead of diminishing the entire sport.
Aj is going to knock ngannu out COLD 🥶
AJ aint fast mate, he is one of the slowest ever seen, WTF you talking about. Clearly you are huge fanboy
How salty is Dana right now 😂
If AJ sticks to boxing ,he will win if he goes in there to knock  him out he may get hit and hurt.
god bless the bumpkins paying for these sham fights, I bet some of them actually believe these WWE scripts 😂
5:17 Have  you ever heard of Alex Pereira my dude???
Has anyone questioned the size of the ring for the fight? When AJ faught Ruiz the second time that ring seemed huge; Fury vs Ngannou the ring seemed tiny in comparison. I the ring is big I think it benefits AJ as he will probably look to box long with small combos and get out of there
You the man bro# love the show 💯💯💯
AJ will win inside three round
Francis will be two fights in with a better resume than Fury😂
He hasn't just taken boxing up. He's had previous amateur experience and is quite cumbersome and ponderous, as a boxer. Hence why he's a cage fighter. Joshua (who I'm not a huge fan of) will dismantle him within a few rounds. Fury fought Ngannou as a sloppy, out of shape mess, so don't judge Ngannou's abilities by that performance.
Hes to technical for inganou, hel pick him off coming forward etc
First round k.o ?   Naganou realised from the Tyson fight that he had lots of energy left, he put Tyson on the floor ! In the next fight it’s safe to say he will fight faster and harder , and if so Tyson may get k.o also ….I predict a riot 😊
Joshua Hype is over.....he lost fights and starts crying ...this is not a boxer he is a marketing project.....ngannou beat his ass badly up for safe
Fixed fight you see
Francis is amazing but it’s too much to expect. Fury didn’t show up. This will be one sided beat down
You dont half chat some waffle at times, AJ goes through him like dihorea
Seriously it can go either way!   Francis has a better chin than Joshua
Aj can fight any body .the fight he lost to useky .does mean Aj is not good.Any thing can happened in sport
I seem to remember that you are Tyson's biggest fan. I would say the upcoming fight would be a 50/50 fight and hopefully involving a KO!
The shadow boxer Dublin
Francis never fought anyone like AJ u mma dudes going find out this is sweet science boxing u got have the skills francis is amature Jousha 2x unified heavy weight champion. Its levels to this u will see on march 9.
Nganno is like takam
7:10 if we get the best version of AJ then Ngannou has no chance.
AJ by KO ...within 3 rounds...
5:02 he’s the greatest mma fighter ever by beating a boxer, good one😂😂😂😂😂
Francis is not a boxer wake up
This has to be the chillest king in history.......we will miss him 😂😂😂😂
True geordie the best youtube channel for boxing and mma if you havnt subscribed then you need to n while your there go over to JSF BOXING chanel I've only just started today its not a bad start but its not no where near what in hoping to achieve keep up the good work Brian 👍🏽
Very fare analysis
Francis would be the baddest man on the planet
A.J. is an athlete.  Ngannou is a beast and a killer. If. A.J. tries to FIGHT he will be destroyed. If he tries to box he could end the fight standig, maybe...
Mygggg Aj 🔥💯
AJ is a dirty racist melt.
Fantastic breakdown of each, brilliant post.
I think Francis loses badly, AJ will just box him and keep his distance, it will be very much like Ruiz 2, an absolute snooze fest 😴
I hope Francis trains like a madman for this fight, he took a gypsy elbow to the face and didn’t even look shook. Granted AJ is a motivated fighter so we will see how it goes
as long as AJ doesn't get drawn into a brawl, he'll win on points.
Thanks sir you are a man of justice masha allah
If AJ beats Ngannou make sure you give him the due respect.AJ will show you haters n negative ambassadors that there are levels and fury is just overhyped dosser. You said after Usyk 2 that AJ is finished..Ngannou has made the best mistake by running his mouth pre fight with AJ.If you want to beat AJ show him respect like RUIZ 1 pre fight
This is gonna be an interesting one my money is on Aj
After that debacle after the Usyk fight I lost a whole lot of respect for AJ and I wrote him off. Fair play to the man he has kept active and hungry and got straight back up to try and retake the throne. You have to respect that as a lot of fighters aren't like that nowadays.
Fights are fights
I think people are getting a bit carried away by how well France’s did against hype job fury , fury’s not that good at 100% but coming in under prepared and under trained made Frances look better than he really is.
You are super real in your analysis and honesty
See how Ngannou smash heads
Honestly for the good of boxing, we need a Francis win. Nobody wants to watch AJ get destroyed by Usyk again after he beats Fury
Pure Ngannou power
Love Ngannou s humility.....may be I do something no one has ever than
I don’t see AJ beating him but u could be wrong . Ngannou is very patient and composed , that’s what makes him dangerous
Lets face it AJ has been gun shy since Ruiz and never got his chin checked by Wallin. Francis will definitely do that, it'll be interesting to see once he feels the power will the wheels fall off
Are you gonna do a video on Strickland?
The fight with tyson fury he was lucky to not get knockout because tyson fury has amazing natural head moment but AJ oh lord no head movements. I would say 4th or 6th knockout for the big man
The biggest threat to AJ us that ngannou is very dangerous when he gets hit we seen in the fury fight where fury thought he could put it on ngannou , it was at that moment he knew he fucked up picking ngannou , the way he throws punches back while being pressured could be a problem for aj
Cyril Gane vs Ngannou is a perfect blueprint for AJ. NG couldn't touch CG and had to resort to wrestling.
if yoyu have watch AJ vs Tarka, then you should know what wll happen. My money on AJ
Francis saved to much energy worrying about the rounds he needed to do. This time if he goes for it more he will knock Joshua out round 4!
Prince Turki has some great plans for this year its a great time to be a boxing fan
Francis is knocking AJ out
Ngannou’s chin allows him to take shots and land his bombs.  Derrick Lewis was the only fighter whose power he respected in his career thus far.
Frances’s will beat him with in 4-5 rounds
Let me hit my cup
AJs getting DESTROYED!
What are you on about? Francis has NEVER EVER been against someone that punches like AJ his chin might be good but he hits as hard as Nganou anyways it's gunn be a lop sided stupid fight it'll be what Fury Nganou was supposed to be but Fury isn't a powered puncher he doesn't have the 1 punch ko power for the highest level of heavyweight boxing he has the best skills to keep people back but who's seen Fury ko someone in 1 round with a punch to the Chin never happened AJ will kill Nganou
I like both fighters, but on the night i'll be rooting for Francis, cos I like the underdog story. It's nice to see AJ more relaxed too. Trash talk isn't for everyone. I think this fight could go down as a classic. Too much power for it not to be.
He has tape of him boxing. Anthony in the second KO
Can't wait to hear AJs tearful excuses
You're absolutely right @Mike649foxx. AJ is going to wipe the floor with this dude. AND this is going to be the end of Francis.
I wouldn’t say that winning against AJ makes him better than any mma fighter of all time 😂 that’s a crazy take. Now yes it’s a super impressive feat but he does not have the resume in MMA to be considered the goat. Not really even that close.
Poopiebutt stinkpants
What is amazing is them all looking like Oliver Twist asking can i have some more money please.
Aj might just go punch for punch don’t think he will like but he might
AJ needs to watch out for the counterpunches. Fury overestimated his 1-2 and left himself exposed, which is why he got dropped.  If AJ can watch out for ngannous counter punches when he connects i think AJ wins this by TKO.
The last time Joshua fought somebody on his physical level, it was Klitschko and it was a 50/50 fight. Despite Klit being 10 years older and hadn’t boxed in a year.   Francis is a physical specimen and Joshua can’t bully him. However, I would expect the boxer to beat the martial artist
Aj is going to do to ngannou what usyk did to aj. Just outbox him and use movement and speed
If only the Saudi’s could get rid of all the meaningless belts and have a one champion per division.
AJ has everything to lose in this fight. Hopefully, that will toughen him up mentally for the fight. If AJ wins but wins poorly or by some Eddie Hearns manipulating he still loses.
at least Saudi are making the fights finally happen
The English are marketing geniuses. Joshua has been finished for years but still headlining.
Francis had the goal of boxing from the start, so MMA was only a backup plan til boxing came calling
I can bet it that Nganno will loss all the ten round, he will stand to the end though
Your shirt is on point! Wow!👍
He’s the African Rocky
Boring presser as AJ is the A side
FunFightFact: The last MMA/Boxing upset was Thunderlips v Balboa.
Ngannou will take the jabs and shrug them off then AJ is in trouble. I think AJ can win but he needs to deliver most shots with power from the off otherwise the big fellas coming   close and AJ won't be able to take that haymaker.
I can’t stand this guy and his “knowledge” for boxing.
love the respect you show both these fighters! cannot wait.
heavy weight division is getting interest again of many fans the biggest loser in this is Dana White good for Francis making the money he deserves
Unless AJ has some mental health issues, I see this a comfortable win for him. AJ will dominate Ngannou easily... Unless, like I said, he has some mental issues that makes him gun shy or not able to think properly... Ngannou will then be in the fight and could land
AJ wins. He hits harder than Fury.
Brock had 3 fights and was the heavy weight champ and was a wwe wrestler ffs. We have seen this in the UFC.
I enjoyed this video.
Get rid of the alphabet bodies!!!!!  Have the Saudi Championship!!!  i like it.
I once believed these heavyweight fighter's of this generation are the best ever. I now believe they're the weakest. Lennox Lewis in his prime would tool them all.
Well unless there having a MMA fight he’s fought plenty of people like him.
i really love both fighters, if AJ looses it would be totally devastating to his carrier but if ngannou looses he possibly could still be victorious in the lose & his boxing status would increase despite a loss , this is not so for AJ. Thats why i want AJ to win
How much of a violation is it every time you have to delete ppls comments about you begging people on the internet to stick things up your 💩
Warren and Hearn. Twin cheeks of the same arse.
Quick nights work for AJ, it’s gonna be a vicious KO
The last fights A.J have had, take a look at the once he fought - Wallin for example didn't do S*** and the others, besides USYK, Wasent worth much either... Way to easy fights he have had last year, especially when looking at what he is going up against now... 🥊👊 Francis will eat him raw and beat the H out of him - One thing Francis is really good at, is coming back way way better than previous fights, he is improving so fast and i sure think A.J is in for huge trouble and will loose that fight, absolutely... 🥊👊🥊
If andy ruiz can make AJ stumble. Surely FN can knock him down
saudis took a chance when heavyweight boxing was languishing and are now pouring their oil money into it. great, at least that oil money is going into something entertaining and not some line city or whatever that doomed project is called.
They are both sausages ... and you are the third!
Ngannou fought Fury The pound for pound man   Fury went in tooooo cocky against Francis   AJ just survives or get KOd
The thing about Francis is he has a chin of granite.  He stays in there and can take a hit while throwing his big shots
Bigger gloves will suit Joshua, remember how small ufc gloves are. Love this fight though. Great to see fighters taking fights when others duck duck duck
Im suprised Connor McGregor wasnt trying to fight Francis!
True Geordie is still sour about Fury calling him out in that interview they had. Was licking his arse up to that point. Now he's so sour. Wipe that coke from your nose Brian. We have seen it on a few videos some little coke bogies dangling.
francis will get tired and try and knock joshua out and then Aj will capitalise on francis poor stamina and stop him
I don’t know man… the bais against fury is getting boring.
U re making mistake when u said francies will beat Aj
Funny how you slated fury for fighting him yet said nothing now the money makes sense for aj
Am putting 10 on Francis knock out Brian gut feeling
No way is AJ an inch taller! More like 3
Geordie got his a*al beads ready for the fight.
AJ is Nigerian but the places Ngannou as walk in Nigeria . AJ is not dream of walking in.,Those places in Nigeria.
AJ is Nigerian but the places Ngannou as walk in Nigeria . AJ is not dream of walking that walk
We can  recognize the power of a man by the shape and size of his legs.Ngannou  will win this one  for sure
Otto Wallin UD's Francis Ngannou
AJ knocks out Ngannou.
If I was Nganou i'd put the heat on him right off the start.
There won't be an undisputed world champ after the Fury Usyk fight. Cos they'll get stripped of a belt due to the rematch clause.
Either way Ngannou winns ❤
people keep saying Francis is a beast etc, if so then why did he lose several times in the UFC?
People forget Francis trained boxing during his UFC Career and before being advised to take up MMA he was training as a boxer and he's not got a lot of miles considering he started MMA late and doesn't get hit hard much in the head. I would bet my home that Francis doesn't get KO'd
Francis’ approach to Fury. Which was basically sit and don’t flinch….. counter and bully….. won’t work against AJ.  Who has AJ ever struggled against? Usyk…. Who’s movement and defensive game is the best ever in the heavyweight weight division.  Then you can say…. Ruiz….. but only in the first fight when he over committed and just got caught.  Rigid, stationery big fighters….. they’re his prey.  Francis can’t just stand there and try to counter. He’ll get battered.  Part of me wants Francis to win. Because it’s a mental story.   But think we’ll see what we thought we’d see in the fury fight.  I also think….. Francis hasn’t been hit ever…… ever….. like AJ will hit him. He’s Elite power.  Francis also gassed from round 5 in a very slow paced fight. AJ can fight at Usyk pace.
Francis ngannou will KO AJ in the 3rd Ron, and he will be à next champion of boxin in the world
TG Literally don't know a THING about boxing
So now you're absolutely glazing Francis like you did Fury and Conor. Its pathetic. AJ wins easily.
Aj getting praise for fighting an 0-1 guy. The same guy who apparebtly "destroyed" furys legacy because fury looked totally washed up agsinst him
Nganou will ko him ajs chin will shatter
You make the best content
Your right he hasn't fought a 0-1 ufc fighter before
Francis knows how to fight..thets all he needs
“Pick AJ up and slam him into the floor” 😂😂
Before Ngannou came into the equation, AJ Vs Fury was all I wanted to see, but for the reasons discussed this has to be the most intriguing fight right now. One thing for sure is it will not be an easy fight for either.
The press conference was quite boring.  This podcast made it far more interesting.  Thanks Geordie 👍
Francis gonna end this mans whole career.
Francis needs to crack aj early if hes going to win aj dont like being hit he was gone in the ruiz fight if not aj should school him
Question mr true Geordy : how come you're not roasting AJ for taking a fight against a UFC fighter who has nothing to do with boxing , the same way you roasted Fury ???? Has it suddenly become acceptable?
This is perfect for AJ he will smash Francis and I really do like Francis
Saudi is about to make the governing bodies irrelevant
I enjoy your passion for the sport of boxing, thank you! What is not enjoyable is the 4 letter words you use, as I wrote to tell you about last month.  I didn't finish that video because I found the sware words offensive. And I didn't finish this one. May I encourage you to continue to pursue your passion for the art of boxing, but to reconsider how you say, what you say. No one is perfect. God knows I'm not. Having said that, I will not unsubscribe, and look forward to your next video. Thank you for the time, talent and ability you put into your channel. God speed.
Love both fighters but if Francis touches Aj like usyk did it’s gonna be a problem.
If AJ stays calm and picks his shots and combinations he should be able to dominate Ngannou and as Ngannou gets tired after 6-8 rounds, AJ is likely to wobble him with a big shot and then finish him off with flurries of body and head shots.  Beast though he obviously is, Ngannou has limited boxing nous and is likely to get exposed…unless he gets lucky with a massive haymaker of course!
Money has bought football and Fuxxed it up...Now Boxing... Its all so Phoney and fake as fuxk
50 Mill??
Despite the name of the event, and the power of both fighters, I think AJ (with Ben) is going to approach this tactfully and look to control Ngannou in a similar way to how Usyk controlled him (even if not on the same level)- not risking the KO unless it's there, and staying on his feet to one-up Fury. I think we'll see a tentative opening round, with a battle of the jabs as Francis tries to show his grasp of the fundamentals and improvements from the Fury fight and AJ will want to try and take centre ring. Both will respect each others power too much to risk eating shots from the opening bell. That said, I think Francis throws some big shots early/first and puts AJ on the backfoot, but doesn't set them up enough to properly land. Ben will keep AJ honest, who then takes the middle rounds- showing the in and out style seen against Wallin, frustrating Nganno, winning the points decision. Final flourish in the closing rounds with AJ trying to catch Ngannou coming forward, but the fight ending with Francis rocking AJ who just about manages to stay on his feet. Both fighters save face, Ngannou wins the crowd at the end ("if he did that at the beginning he'd have won!") and another fight looms, AJ secures bragging rights against Fury. There.. spoken like a true armchair critic.  TLDR- I'm probably wrong
Bigging up AJ 😂. He is so slow, robotic, no movement or technique. His career is over.
AJ should win, but thats what people thought about Fury. AJ's chin is still somewhat in question to me. Thats why this is a great matchup
Can't a boxer learn MMA or is it a forbidden art?
Francis hits hard , but fury got up , nothing new for boxer's
People can say what they want about the fights being over there but without the oil money these clowns in boxing will never fight each other
I think it's going to be a 12 round borefest
honestly i love watching you breakdown fights!!!
In reality AJ should beat Francis easily.  In saying that, the punch Francis dropped Fury with, was nowhere near as hard as he can bang.
Nice little double - Usyk by points, Ngannou by KO @12/1 😉
And the idea of usyk fighting francis  nope usyk wont take the fight  never
2 pure natural athletes just like Usain bolt
id bet the bank that francis is going to knock out aj anthony joshua is going to get knocked out by frances nganuo an tyson fury will beat uysk an anthony joshua
This is why I like it when chisora's at the table (not throwing them) trash talking. There seems to be no fire here, but possibly a historically good fight.
Ngannou will KO AJ
Does it get bigger then this? Yes 😂 there has been bigger
Great fuk'n answers from Ngannou
Thanks to Fury for giving Ngannou the opportunity. Hearns say its going to be a KO. To Ngannou I believe.
Think AJ on points he's going to dance round ngannou and jab him from close so ngannou  can't use his power but having said that it's not going to be easy for him and I can see ngannou rocking him a couple of times Also fury usyk next month where is the build for that
The size difference... Head of Francis is huge wtf and he looks only slightly shorter but more massive.
You spit only facts in here bro 100%
AJ is so awkward whenever the mic's on him, he sound's nervous and he fumbles into cheap talk. If his sponsors would let him pull that earphone out he might hear the questions a bit better and give a better answer.
I am from the future and Joshua wins on points. Put your house on it.
AJ going to sleep within 3 rounds. They still underestimating francis big time in boxing.  Saying Fury fought crappy, didnt take it serious …. yet i have a feeling it will be the best anyone will ever do vs ngannou in boxing.
Your forgetting one thing "bottle" and AJ hasn't got any hes a flat track bully who doesn't want any smoke if Francis makes this a fight he wins
Get your tong out AJ arse the guy has lost 3 times 🤔 yet your still trying to make out AJ the best 😂
AJ has to try and box dangerman at a distance. If Ngannou gets the speed like Ruiz then AJ will be in serious trouble. AJ should not try and fight on the inside with Ngannou or else he'll be in trouble.
AJ has to stick and move till round 6... Then go after him
Love both boxers.. But I think I’m slightly partial to AJ💪🏾
I see estrogen on the screen
You could argue the point that A.J. has fought tougher opponents than fury. I feel A.J. win this fight comfortably. I feel he has the better boxing skills A.J. is hard to hit.
I reckon Ngannou might try and wear Aj down with body shots and try to take him out in the later rounds, Aj has improved a lot and definitely with the right mindset will be a force to be reckoned with. Ben Davidson is the right guy in the corner Joshua needed to get him on the right path to becoming a champ again like TG i like both guys and wouldnt mind either one winning. I still feel like Ngannou got robbed against Fury. I wonder if there will be a bit of a sour taste in his mouth which makes him want to go for broke and get a decisive victory.
This fight is definitely more hype worthy than the Fury Usyk fight despite it being undisputed. Crazy times, great for boxing. Francis Ngannou just came into the game and replaced Wilder as the hardest hitting heavyweight. Personally I prefer this fight over the Wilder fight especially after his performance against Parker
Aj has no any idea what he is in for 😂 Ngannou will absolutely Smash him, seriously Aj should have gone with Wilder as his next opponent!
AJ has always been a bigger puncher than Fury so yeah he has stopped fighters that Fury couldn't knock out like Wallin and Klitschko. But AJ couldn't school Klitschko like Fury did so Fury edges AJ when it comes to skill and AJ edges Fury when it comes to power. It's like Mayweather and Pacquiao, Pacquiao knocked out Cotto and De La Hoya and Mayweather beat Cotto and De La Hoya on points but Mayweather outboxed Pacquiao. So styles make fights. I really hope Fury vs AJ happens.
Aj will beat fury but not nganu. Nganu too strong
Give it a rest....you're boring man! 🥱.....what do you know about boxing.....you didn't know half of the day of reckoning fight card 😂😂
The bellend himself.. lady’s and gents true gordie
You’re a clown. You disregard Fury after his worst performance ever against Francis and now you’re saying AJ hasn’t fought anyone like this? Why is every opinion you have about fighting total bullshit?
Youtube editing because you cant speak more than one sentence without stopping thats sad
God loves you
I find it all a bit cringe and sickening how Eddie and Frank are bumming each other now they’ve had some cash waved at them. That’s all the evidence you need to show you just how little they’ve ever really cared about boxing.
AJ taking this fight is the best option for him. Yes, it involved his honour and that of boxing. AJ has always being the one promoting boxing in the heavy weight division. We should be proud of him. I wish Nnganou best of luck, but i know AJ will dominate him 100%.
Depends what aj turns up, if its timid aj it might not go well for him
I'm looking forward to this. I can visualise the fight playing out loads of different ways and I can't make my mind up what way it's going to go.
TG really switched up after Tyson kicked off at him
Ngannou got a heed like a breeze block
Why Eddie made this fight for him I have zero idea!!! It’s the worst fight he could take, Francis will hurt him 💯
Ngannou will be way better now after going 10 rounds with an elite heavyweight in a boxing ring, people overlooking that! No way AJ or any heavyweight knocks out or stops Ngannou head made of iron, tough asf, I got AJ on a close points decision
Whilst i love an underdog story, especially one the calibre of Ngannou’s, i’m AJ all the way man, he’s one of our own, olympic medallist and has the best resume at heavyweight. Never ducks a fight but takes constant criticism from everyone over one upset loss and two defeats to one of the silkiest and complicated hw boxers possibly ever. On the other fight, i absolutely cannot stand Fury and i’m a big fan of Usyk but i’m hesitant to want to see a Usyk win because i want AJ to finally get the opportunity to silence the doubters and everyone who said he’d be an easy fight for Fury and i don’t see that fight being made if Usyk wins.
The saudis are about to shake up heavyweight boxing history, they have stupid money 😂🎉
Can’t wait till this fight happens it’s going to be immense 🥊good review big man
So but hurt by Fury 🤣
Honest question, is francis better than wilder?? Ive not seen anyone talk about this but it might actually be more of a challange than wilder
Honestly get your tongue out Francis ring brian you giant whopper
Hard fight but for me as a boxing fight... actually makes sense. Cmon the man is a freak of nature
Honestly, I believe boxing is rigged. Between the last Wilder fight and then, the Walin fight. It looked as though it was their first time in the ring,  which leads me to believe they were instructed to lose
Your analysis is good.
5:25 Alex Pereira is a 2 weight class champion in MMA and Kickboxing
We are all forgetting Francis hates body shots. And he's not getting any younger he's 37 it catches up with you... And Francis is stiff . Joshua will wear Francis down and finish him Francis won't like it when he's getting peppered with lighting strong jabs 5x Fury's jab power wise. Francis will struggle with hooks and Joshua uppercuts and his jab is elite level and the speed is a massive factor Joshua combinations are in my opinion better than anyones. His power combos are easily better than Fury's.  Any fighter has a chance I like Francis but he's not winning this... Can see a points AJ win as likely scenario.
If AJ believes he’s gonna win just like he did with Wallin then I think AJ wins!
NGANNU IS GOING TO BE UNDISPUTED CHAMP ITS HIS DESTINY COME BACK HERE AFTER HE BEATS AJ AND USYK
Mate, you seriously need to be attending these fights, evidence is in that stupid question Gareth put to his excellency
I’d go further and say it’s the best accomplishment of any fighter ever being ufc champ and beating Joshua and, arguably, Fury
I think this is going to be a mismatch. AJ will pick him apart.
They both know they can get KO'd though Ngannou has never been knocked out yet, the size of his head is just huge. AJ I'm still not convinced he's back yet. I don't want to see these two just look at each other for 10 rounds, afraid to pull the trigger.
Great take man, really enjoyed how you put together.💪🏾💯
Prediction:   AJ beats Francis  Usyk beats Fury  AJ and Usyk complete their trilogy with a third fight for the undisputed title and Usyk takes it home.
To me he is already the greatest MMA heavyweight champion fighter ever💯
Overeem was a lot more lethal than Jashua, don't kid yourself, Elite glory kickboxer would beat any boxer in a street fight any day, and Francis almost killed him AJ is not a threat trust me
Funny how AJ doesn't have the same energy as he did with his last couple of opponents
Am a fans of AJ Francis should stop lying he is a beginner...  he's a lier and a cheat is too big for boxing he's going to beat AJ ....
I'm not even sure I can actually do a computer prediction for this fight since Ngannou is not really ...well..he's a beginner in the sport..not sure I Want to go through the trouble of doing it since I think that Anthony easily wins this fight. Oh sure, Ngannou if he hits AJ just right could stop him,but the odds lay heavily in AJ's hands.
AJ has never fought anyone good.
Ngannou best chance at getting a belt is get a slick coach that can show him a few set up tricks to walk people on to a lulabye
Eddie and Frank being the new Vince Mcmahon vs Eric Bishof 🤣
He will obviously get better but I can't see him ever having more than a punchers chance just because of his age. But saying that he's been a stand up all his life so....... he will struggle to get to top tier status cos the finppundamentals take years to get he has no amature career
These money guys could make boxing boxing again. They've got the cash to make people be willing to loose their 0 so we could see the best fights the best again FINALLY. Mayweather made boxers think they have to keep there 0. If u take a loss the right way it makes ya way better. 1 way or the other though with a loss either make it motivate ya not to loose again. Or it breaks them
Amazing fight ahead for us and Imagine this : Francis KO’s Joshua and then beats the winner of Fury vs Usyk … He would become a legend in combats sports … the first ever fighter to be lineal Mma world champion and World champion in Boxing …  Insane
Your hate for Tyson Fury really clouds your judgement - it’s a shame. AJ is not a scratch on Fury and is no where near as mentally strong - look at him! He’s acting like a spoilt child
I think AJ will win. I'm starting to like him. He's changed and has become a rare thing in modern day boxing... a boxer that actually wants to box.
I see Joshua winning on point but more comfortably than Fury. Ngannou can take a punch so I'll be surprised if AJ stops him. Joshua's jab is like a spear, will be the key to his win in my opinion.
A focussed joshua is a dangerous man, I think he stops ngannou inside 6 rounds
People seem to forget the Saudi govenment have colluded with other nations to bring terror attacks to the west these guys hate western people but want to take boxing etc away from hosting in western countries it’s a madness 🙄
The earphone in AJs ear is a publicist telling him when to speak, and what to say - IMO
I’m a huge francis fan since day 1 in the UFC, to say josh hasn’t fought someone that hits as hard as Francis when he fought Klitschko is mental. Man had 53 KO’s alone
Joshua is clearly the favorite. It helps a lot that he has tape on Francis now. Fury literally had zero tape. You can’t under estimate Francis though. Francis is literally the hardest puncher in the world and Joshua doesn’t have the best chin. If Joshua can keep control and fight on the outside
Challenge for true Geordie, don’t lick Francis asshole squeaky clean, I rekcon it’s impossible for him🤔
It will be a late KO for either guy or a decision to AJ, pretty simple.
True geordie said Fury v Ngannou was a joke and said people should not pay for it and did a vid called BULLSHIT ,   pot  kettle ha ha ha
AJ wipes the floor with francis who is a terrible boxer.
Gordie would like Francis 💩 on him by the sounds of it
Is true Geordie fat or muscular? Disgusting imo, anyways Joshua is too overrated with his glass chin, stop talking like he's the 2nd coming
I hope someday, someone speaks about me as highly as Brian speaks about Ngannou
I like you analysis
FRANCIS  wont get knockout. if an elbow didn't knock him out or even cut him i think AJ just need to outbox him
The Francis meat riding is real
AJ will destroy him..Sorry Ngannou fans.
AJ wears headphones for sponsorship reasons bro, not everything has to be analysed...
True geordie doesn’t know boxing
It’s worrying your boxing knowledge buddy
Honestly bro what I think will happen is Usyk will spank Fury , Joshua will beat Ngannou but then Usyk will retire , he's already beat Josh twice lol  he has nothing left to do after that . Then and finally then will be the Joshua Fury fight .
Saying he knocked out all fury leftovers, so means he beats fury is stupid Triangles don't work in boxing  For e.g if Parker beats zhang.  Zhanged wiped out joyce TWICE, but joyce wiped out Parker...  So yeah...
Easy target for joshua. francis has no head movement
I get it, I appreciate and respect everything about Ngannou, I can't help feeling gutted for all those fighters out there around the world that have been training their whole lives and making all sorts of sacrifices for the love of the sport that the world we never know. I may need to move with the times, but I just can't help thinking it's wrong to just jump in and fight the 2 best heavyweights of our time immediately and not earn it on the boxing ladder.
ALL the years in the ufc? Francis was a relatively new chap in that discipline I thought. Not fuckin arsed enough to g00gle it like mate😂
TBH, I reckon that AJ is in big trouble with this fight.
Who cares.   Really who cares   They all make millions for taking bull SHI.    AND ALL THE PROMOTERS HAND PICK FIGHTS TO MAKE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TILL THEIR FIGHTER HAS NOTHING LEFT RETIRES OR WINS   ITS A BUSINESS
Aj is guna box how he boxed Ruiz 2 on his toes moving and jabbing the head of francis
8 Round stoppage Francis Ngannou wins.
I agreed with your expression!
This is a fascinating match up, like you say it shouldn't be close but just look at Francis man he's an absolute juggernaut, but he's a very good counter puncher as well so I see AJ wanting to keep it at range, if Francis does try to get in close does that leave him open to AJ's favourite shot (the uppercut) ? It's gonna be great night no matter what and I can't wait for this.
Connor McGregor had no boxing history prior to Mayweather and never returned. Ngannou definitely has what it takes to rule the Heavyweight. Note how Joshua didn't do his usual passive aggressive threats in the press conference nor face off. His past fights since loss of belts he has intimidated opponents who have been non verbal/ non threatening. AJ is worried. Ngannou's movement is way more fluid. Ngannou can comfortably switch from orthodox to southpaw for long periods regardless of oncoming pressure. AJ can not be ranked above Fury based off a fight with Ngannou. Such would prove AJ has been scared of/ Ducking Fury. AJ must Meet Fury
Referring the question if AJ has ever been in the ring with someone who hits as hard. Maybe not as hard but Glad certainly hits bloody hard and shouldn't be forgotten. Yes was a bit older but power usually fades late or last. And glad definitely has more superior technique than Francis. We can't forget that Francis has this concussive power but we have mostly seen it in MMA gloves with also MMA style winging punches and MMA opponents (absolutely no disrespect to MMA..love it too). Just saying. Wlad hits damn hard too.
It's a 50/50 fight, no result would be a surprise. Neither has met anyone with the power each has.
( :¬{i}}
All Frances did in the UFC was boxing and people are surprised he’s good at it.
Oscar de la hoya is a hater
I think if aj makes the pace of the fight Francis will gass out he's to big like people say about aj but aj has his cardio on point now
Maybee aj fights nganou like andy ruiz 2 win by points
Ngannou is not foolish enough to wait for points he is going for a knockout that means he will attack more and he push for an early win
I think francis knocks out joshua round 2-3
Fake A.I. Invest Future ad!?!!!
The same goes for Francis. He fought Fury who is extremely overrated. AJ beats Fury even when AJ is at his worst. Ruis beats Fury after 500 snickers.  Yeah, styles make fights, but Fury is levels below.
Lets not forget   Zhang v Parker    thats a great fight too    hopefully another affordable ppv too    🙏
Theoretically I think AJ should outbox Francis, but all Francis has to do is catch him once.
Big ups to you for doing a good job analytically, love them both let see the fight
Geordie hop off pal, Joshua will stun him with a jab and ko him in 5 it’s that simple he actually hits hard enough to scare him unlike fury when he gets hit a couple of times and hit with a few combos it’s game over he will lose his head and his technique
AJ is doing the same thing that Fury did, which is look past Ngannou to other fights.  Ngannou is going to stop AJ.
Its laughable the predictions from some people.    AJ will batter him. I know hes a beast but people just dont realise Fury is not as good as everyone makes out    he was exposed. Francis was better than expected    but he aint beating AJ.
Cannot believe we in the west have become circus entertainers for these goat herders. It's a joke.
I think AJ gets caught with a power punch and game over even thoughAJ will out box him
Ngannou might single handedly ruin the sport of boxing. No one will ever credit boxing again if he becomes world champion within 3 fights.  MMA will be taken to a new level.
You nailed it towards the end of this video Brian. Its the speed gap that will make the difference. Joshua will bring the power far quicker than Ngannou will be able to cope with.
PFL might even join forces with Saudi to one day overthrow the UFC. Who knows.
Imagine if Tyson really did just have a bad night and Nganou gets played with by Joshua😅 it’d ruin this princes play time 😂
I think AJ will win this quite comfortably on points. It will be a tough, gruelling fight, but AJs skills will see him through
Man I hope Francis wins what a story
Fury didnt lose that fight and Francis boxed well . Francis did have his best night, and Fury did have his worst . The strap on lover just hates Fury lol  I think Francis might beat AJ . Yet Tyson will beat Uysk and then you will.come with somw excuse
Looking forward to this one!! It’s amazing how money talks . It’s going to be a close one this is it’s a hard one to call. I think USYK is going to beat fury , something tells me fury is on the decline and his legs are going
AJ normally loves to intimidate people at these pressers, must be depressing looking over and that monster is looking back at you and doesn’t even need to speak to intimidate you
Get out of Ngannous arse, you will see a different Ngannou.
I love Francis and I'm no fan of AJ, but I think Joshua will school him. Sadly. Having said that, you have a point. Gonna be interesting.
What this shows is money talks and if you have enough you can have whatever you want.
Hopefully AJ wins so we finally see AJ vs TYSON to see who is the uk’s best and if AJ wins I think Francis should fight dillien white as that would be a good fight to watch
Francis has never been in with anyone like Joshua, think AJ will destroy him Quickly, Francis couldn’t stop a fat washed up fury, infact all of his right hands bounced off fury, never jump on a hype train before any wins in boxing have happened lol
Respect for Aj for fighting so often and happy for Francis for living his dream. We are living in his world
It's brilliant that we have some massive fights this year! Good luck to all competitors 👌🥊
So what you mean to say is AJ has never fought as sloppy power puncher with ZERO TECHNIQUE? lol.
I use to hate your videos in the past before Francis's first boxing fight because I thought you were not being honest but now I think you've won me over as a fan. I agree with a lot you be saying now and I enjoy watching your videos.
Brother, bring the winning belt in cameroon
Hes built like a fucking dump truck, rooting for the underdog, im liking this fight.
Ngannou is more muscular and his muscle is all natural. Joshua is just a roider.   Hope Ngannou wins tbh. He's a gentleman whereas AJ showed his spots in the Usyk fight.
Francis definitely stronger in mental side of game, the journey he took from his home country in Africa to get to France, then still think boxing/MMA best option to take to earn a living. AJ gets busted by police as young teenager and given choice box we go a bit more lenient or don't box and we charge. What a tough young teenager/g he was, took boxing route earned his dues as amateur(regardless of gold medal) but as professional let's face it Eddie Hearn did the PBC thing, don't face anyone until it's significant
If I'm honest Ben Davies is going to be the reason AJ wins, I'm not saying he will ko him or stop him but I do think AJ beats him up. Ngannou is a great fighter and I think he will land on AJ but he's slow the and I don't think he lands clean. It's a great fight 65/35 in AJ favour for me. But i respect Ngannou for everything he's in in combat sports and in life.
I like both of them, didn't want them to fight because I don't want to see any of them lose
I don’t see the upside for AJ besides the money.
Left the ufc and made like £30m+ in under one year at this point I'm for Francis being the king of Africa guy is q walking myth 😅😂
N’gannou has been taking hits from UFC fighters,with different gloves and shook it off..AJ has been rocked a couple of times,by fighters with less power,so bring it on..N’gannou will knock him into another dimension!!.👊🏾
There's always that question: "Who is best, America or Europe?" In golf, they have the Ryder cup. Forget Warren Vs Hearn, I think America vs. Europe would get people talking more 👍
It’s about time the arabs spent all of that oil money on something decent instead of stashing it a 100 feet under the Sahara Desert 😊😊
Bombowollll🎉
Why do people still watch this clown lol true Gordie you're a nob head
Technique beats power every time. Look at fury vs wilder and how that ended. Joshua beats Ngannou easy
I like both of these guys as people but i admire Francis story. Francis Nganou attempted to get into Europe 7 times. 7 times. 7 times and once ended up being dumped.  on some desert. When he fought Fury he had not fought anyone in a year. Francis is a beast and AJ was once beaten up by a fat man. Francis fancies his chances and he should. They look like gladiotors. The lasttime i saw learhal looking boxers eas Tyson vs Holyfield. These guys even look like how proffessional boxers should look.
The difference from the fury fight  is that now there is footage of ngannou boxing. Should be enough for AJ to prepare himself..i see him winning by stoppage.
Is there a more over hyped fighter at the minute? He went 10 rounds, in what everyone other than him thought was going to be a move around.   AJ is using this as another excuse to duck genuine contenders. It is a clown show.
Aj wins less than 10 rounds. AJ for the win 🏆  cant imagine people think because hes champion in mma he can beat Aj. AJ for the win.
4 fights in 12 months, all I need to hear, fair play Josh. This is what boxing needs
My guy lost to andy.
AJ is not a boxer. So overrated.
Slurp slurp. Your logic is blinded because Tyson called you a tosser.😂😂😂😂😂
Jones and Dana praying Francis gets beat but we all know who the baddest man on the planet is and will be after this fight
This Francis hype is funny....I'm the biggest MMA fan and TG must not have watched the Derrick Lewis fight when he was petrified to throw, the Cyril fight where he didn't land anything..and tbh he took 8 rounds off doing nothing against fury. He's not this crazy aggressive fighter that he thinks he is
massive thanks to the Saudis to put on this dream fights !!! I am going to buy paperviews first time ever 😂
You're so high on Francis. It won't be competitive
this is a very good video, well done...
Hard to choose who to root for on this one, best left to the Gods, gosh Ngannou's come a long way
the same the other way
It's always a lose lose situation for AJ, which in my opinion takes the excitement away. All you'll hear after the fight is, "AJ did what he had to do"
think this will be amazing for the both of them but has the potential to really mess up the heavyweight division even further and AJ vs Fury   If Ngannou wins or if this is even a close fight.... What does AJ do? Fury fight is pretty much off the cards.   If AJ wins.... we 'hopefully' get the AJ vs Fury fight.  I really want to see AJ vs Fury and I think this is all on him. Just hope his head is right for this one... But at the same time... Its so refreshing to see Ngannou and the way he acts. Id love for him to win and just stick two fingers up to the UFC & Boxing!!!   Will be exciting either way!!!!
If francis connects its all over! AJ's chin will not stand up to that mans insane power!
AJ getting praise for fighting Ngannou, and Fury getting hate LOL
all heavyweights can KO one another with a single punch, so it doesn't matter much how hard they hit bc they all hit hard....this will probably be the 1st time we see ngannou get KO bc he will be over confident as well...ngannou just had a lucky break against Fury bc he was very hugely  underestimated... I don't think he will last long with Joshua if Joshua prepared properly and didn't underestimate him like Fury did..
The Saudi guy has an Italian restaurant table cloth as his head piece 😂😂
Is that prince on drugs 😂
Much love to both fighters🙌2 warrior titans💪🙏🫶.
2 big black dudes I’m sure this dude was excited to watch 😂. Probably couldn’t wait to offer up his gf.
fury ngannou was exhibition fight so fury never really trained for that one while this one is AJ chance to become undisputed another shot at all the marbles. so he will trained much for this. ngannou was overhype due to his performance with fury but its more fury under performance that night.
I'm far more psyched for this fight than for Fury-Ngannou... The reason is Ngannou is now a known quantity in Boxing.            He isn't Ben Askren ... He isn't Nate Robinson ... He isn't Tyron Woodley ... He isn't Conor McGregor who was ready to drop dead from exhaustion in the 10th ... He isn't Anderson Silva, who couldn't put his boxing expertise to good use. Francis can box. He can box southpaw. He can score with dead accurate counters. He can defend. He can push the pace. I can't wait to see this f**king fight.
This level of Glazing for Ngannou should be studied
AJ totally renowned for his boxing IQ 😂😂 he knows like 4 different punches lol
Did AJ not fancy showing his tattoo of Africa to Francis?
I think Aj will smoke him
I wonder the excuses most of you doubters re going to give after Aj has demolished Francis can’t wait
Any betting website you guys can recommend for this fight?
Suddenly I'm not that interested in the UFC🤭
AJ is looking in fantastic shape physically and mentaaly and  like he means business. He did last time round too. I think I fancy him for this one, i really do.
Fury has built his own hype that anyone who does well against him is hard Deontay wilder is average and fury made him look half good
You didn’t mention the “street fighter game” comment from his excellency
I honestly think AJ will batter him, but we'll see
I think Ngannou is over hyped. He’s not that good. I think AJ ends the hype train
I will go with Francis simply because AJ have glass chin,and glass chin and power like Nganou has don't result good when linked together.
Francis isn’t in day one. Boxing or not he’s been around for a while and he’s 38 or 39.
I feel like it must be delusional, but I’m so hype for Francis to do this. Can u imagine? People will be making documentaries and feature films about Ngannou in 50 years, like we are about Muhammad Ali now, if he could beat the best boxers of the generation in his first 3 boxing matches ever and claim the undisputed titles. He will be recognised as the best combat sports fighter in history. It’s gotta be too out there to be possible, but if he does it, to witness that will be something else!
The robotic AJ will be running 🏃‍♀️ and clinching just like he did against  the BLOB Andy Ruiz .Besides all of that TFurry is a way better boxer than AJ the dossier. Ngannou will put AJ down and out he will not be getting up why because he will quit on the canvas or his corner .By way of those infamous words of NO MAS .🤓🥊
When Miocic beats Bones Francis gotta give him the trilogy
How do u know francis ngannou is stronger mentally 🤔
Francis has already sold this fight we all no Joshua cant lose its already been scripted
I really want AJ to win, but imagine Usyk fighting Francis. That would be nuts! It’ll be billed as “David vs Goliath”.
Every time I hit Subscribe button, YouTube take me to a different page. that is very weird.
Francis can be the hammer and be the nail but aj can only be the hammer sooooo I got Francis putting aj to sleep
It became very apparent that fury was in deep water when he threw the elbow it was disgraceful and really showed that he thought he was losing.
I just want Francis should Overeem  Joshua.  In the ring.
Francis only needs  2 or 3 fights ££££££. A lot of people forget Francis is a 20 stone  fighter  brickkwall.  I said Francis drops fury in the 3rd and look what happened. Francis will knock out AJ.
Buckle up, folks, 'cause Ngannou's about to unleash raw power that'll leave jaws on the floor! Technique's cool and all, but when that left hook hits like a freight train, it's lights out! Don't be surprised if "The Predator" rewrites the fight book with pure, unadulterated force!
This guy has no clue
People forget AJ took a full klitchko right hand to the head and got up. Does kiltchko not hit hard?
Francis has to stay focus...i can see some overconfidence
Aj will win the fight, Francis will put him down. Ends on points. Let’s see if any boxing politics are involved
Heavyweight is full of surprises, if Francis could knock fury with a punch you think Aj is heavier than fury 😂keep dreaming anything can happen.
Good point about the ring rust lol. not only was Francis a first time boxer ! He hadn’t fought in years.
This is a very different fight than the fury fight.  Aj has big power in both hands and his fundamentals are very solid.  AJ will walk him into massive right hands . I’m happy Francis is getting paid but if he doesn’t catch aj early before aj has him read  , he’s not winning.
only one reason AJ keep wearing that headset, something on his mind and he can't think straight.......it keeps on like that since he's been defeated by Ruiz.
I think it's great seeing Frank and Eddie getting along at the same table smiling from ear-to-ear and shaking hands,    it's funny what money will make you do 💵💸💵
Joshua is like balrog from street fighter. Game over in 6 . To technical. Inside whack. Left hook. Uppercut. All night. We will see x
Francis also never fight anyone like AJ before. Fury is not AJ n we all know.
Street fighter? This is mortal Kombat
The worrying part for aj , is avoiding a power shot because as fury found out , it may be enough to sit you right down .
Great take True, I enjoyed every word.
i wonder how ben will get Aj fighting here, he might put Aj on his bike, make him lose some mass to keep him on his toes easier, thats what i reckon he will do, i cant see him coming in at 250lbs or more.
Francis is actually faster puncher than Anthony.
Eddie and Frank 🤷🏻‍♂️🤔🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑💰💰💲💲💲😁😁😁
I'm with you. Love them both, but I'm on the Francis Train too.
This is how heavyweight boxing should look like two scary big giants going at each other. Thanks to Saudi we are getting that .
Do your research fat boy,francis started out boxing, then went to mma. He also beat stipe in the ufc,stipe is a former golden gloves champion
Agreed 💯 %. AJ was good again Wallin. But they forgot Wallin didn't throw any hard shot. Beware of the power 😊😊
I'm a fan of both these guys but leaning towards to AJ. I'm glad Ben Davidson is in his corner, he's quite a good strategist.
Francis win
Go Francis
Get out of Francis arse😂 AJ is going to dismantle him and I hope he does so people like you shut up with this narrative that he’s any good. Johnny fishers deals with him. You’re clueless.
I really believe that ngannou should stop trying to play this boxing game ..... he is durable and can take any punch , go foward like a zombie and kill everyone ..... forman wasnt technical, he just had the power and was durable , ngannou should do the same ....
Most boring press conference I’ve ever seen
I still thinks Fury beats AJ.
AJ has won two fights against two boxers hand picked for that purpose. I respect AJ as a boxer but isn't this the same thing you all said (,including me) in the fury fight?
I’m rooting for Francis!
Let them fight
Francis will absolutely get better. However, that doesn't negate the fact that he had a great night and Fury had an absolutely horrible night. And I'm not a Fury fan at all, but it's true. Fury underestimated Francis. He was out of shape. Slow, and ill prepared. And Fury absolutely lost the fight. But, he also legitimately won the decision. We've all seen matches where someone got their ass whooped but still actually won the decision. A great MMA example Jon Jones vs  Alexander Gustafsson 1. My point is that a serious Fury who actually trained, prepared, and mentally prepared for the task would have done far better than what we saw. I still think it would go the distance because I don't think Francis gets knocked out that easily. He has a neck that helps his knockout resistance. Fighters will know what I mean by that. And Fury isn't a power puncher. AJ will have no excuses. He knows what he's getting into. He will not underestimate Francis. And he is pretty much always in fight shape. He just has to prepare for the habits and mannerisms Francis has and not put himself in danger.
GG
The amount of people who dksab is astounding
Klitschko hits harder than Ngannou. There, I said it.
Gfy
You Are A Racist
Racist.
Remember your AJ should duck wilder vid from about a month ago? Shows how much you know you big racist
When aj ko's ngannou people will be like fury who? 😂😂😂
Low key can’t stand boxing promoters asking questions let the sports media do it
Can't wait for this fight, someone's gona get knocked the F out 👊 🥊
Your boxing views are so embarrassing
Francis fighting 10 rounds while now boxing is 12 rounds but to be honest in 4 belt era fighting for undisputed it's almost always for at least 5 belte because either one of guys have IBO or Ring Magazin belt is on the line or becoming lineal champ so like in UFC title fights are 5 round while other 3 or in tennis GS are who wins 3 sets while every other tournament is on 2 sets, undisputed fights shoud be special and shoud be 15 rounds because it's not for the belt but like in case of Beterbiev( IBF,WBO,WBC)  vs Bivol (WBA, IBO) as no.1 and no.2 there will be Ring Magazin belt and Beterbiev is lineal champion after beating Gvozdik who beat Stevenson, so it's like for 7 belts and if that's one fight withoit rematch and both fighters are undefeated it shoud be different than others fight and it shoud be 15 rounds
Why does this guy have his big dumb face in yhe thumbnail
Style wise ngannou isn't great for AJ... well not great to look good against...brick chinned with a good quick hard left hook... Joshua may have to bite the bullet and box him otherwise you run the risk... yeah Joshua will be criticised but the W is all important as always and especially with Joshua
Youre such a casual. I thought you said ngannou was gonna be rubbish at boxing and now youre rating him so high 😂
Anthony Joshua has To Do What SHAQ Did When NGANNU Picked Him UP., "Expect The BEST By Preparing FOR The WORST!" TRY YOUR VERY BEST NOT TO GET DROPPED!
I feel alistair overeem was pretty damn fast, fighting to not be hit and honestly moved as good as AJ at the time and we saw how that ended. It's boxing not MMA but yer Fury's elbows didn't even move shake Francis so I don't think 12+ Oz of pillow on AJ's hands will help him
Poatan has 2 kick-boxing world titles and 2 in the ufc, I think he’s done the most impressive things as a fighter, he’s also going for the heavyweight title.
Sorry but your Ngannou love fest is getting ridiculous yeah he done well against Fury but AJ is a totally different beast imo AJ does Ngannou and Fury quite easily
I think Frances will win
If your saying Francis will be the best MMA fighter of all time for winning the belt in the ufc and in boxing. What does that make periera?
Head says AJ, heart says Ngannou. Usyk v Ungannou would make a great fight. I reckon Usyk will beat Fury.
Ngannou will not beat any of the top guys, at least not at the moment, im talking about USYK, AJ, FURY, ZHANG, PARKER, DUBOIS... Yes hes a hard hitter but thats it, he lacks basic boxing skills, he's a fighter not a true boxer, experience is the best teacher and these guys r way more experienced , yes they might not KO him but they'll find a way to beat him on points for sure.... This talk about how AJ will react when Ngannou hits him is ridiculous, he's always been hit, there's nothing wrong with his chin, everyone just always talk about that cos of the Ruiz punch which was infact not to his chin but towards the back of the head... Ok so Ngannou doesn't even throw any combination, the question for me is how will Ngannou react when Aj hits him with all the combination, and for sure AJ has one of the best combination in the game, and hits hard too.... Aj beats him all day, thank you.
Best ever in UFC because he wins in boxing too? So what about the champions in wrestling or BJJ or Kick Boxing that are and were champions in UFC?
Aj is the undisputed champ
Check this yeah @truegeordie if ngannou hits AJ The way he did fury ngannou will Finnish AJ if he gets back up. Aj could of never done to wilder what fury did 3 x in a row 😂😂 you never have a nice word to say about fury since you got phone put down on you you joke 😂😂
I am more excited for this fight than the Fury vs Usyk fight as well. I also believe the AJ vs Francis fight will do better numbers.
If Ngannou and Usyk wins it would be crazy to see them for the undisputed
I would say Klitschko moght hit as hard as Ngannou, idk if it's exact but similar
Francis has too much power and AJ has A Soft chin
Saudis changing the game with this cash fans are definitely winning here
Ngannou has everything he needs at this point. From a pure boxing standpoint, I hope he holds up at this age. I think Joshua loses by KO unless he runs the whole fight.
Joshua smokes him easy
Didn't adesanya get smoked by Strickland n everyone said. Izzy fought 5 times in 2 years years. He's exhausted... same will happen to Joshua.
For me Ngannou is going to win by KO/TKO. They're both heavy punchers, but Ngannou is a the heavier of the two. But the main difference is that Ngannou has a better chin than Joshua, so he will be more likely to be able to take what's coming back at him. I can't say the same for Joshua.
Poor Francis is in for a right good pasting
But has ngannou fought anyone like AJ before?
I get Saudi Arabia has all the money but if fury and Joshua win there fights, then fury vs Joshua has to be a UK fight☹️☹️
where did you buy the shirt? it looks good
A.J. either wants to Win, or Retire? Better not be a Rematch Clause, either way, get it done, and Move on to the Winner of Fury Usysk?!
FN gets demolished. He will freeze and think what the FUCK is happening.
Tyson Fury Is built like a librarian 😳😳🤷🏼‍♂️
Everyone talks about what it would mean if AJ convincingly beats Francis Ngannou when Tyson Fury couldn't - We don't hear anyone wondering the same thing about Tyson beating Usyk when AJ could not... Just putting it out there to consideration
Good hunting AJ 👍
🔥  🔥   🔥 🔥  🔥 Goku vs Broly 🔥  🔥  🔥 🔥 🔥
Ngannou is slow & 37. Let's see 🥊🥊
Everyone has a price, everyone.
Francis for the knock out ✊
I'm pretty sure AJ will box him and go for the points, from what I saw Ngannou he's big and he's powerful. But against Fury he was a bit pondersome and slow to get his hands up on occasions. Joshua is an all round athlete in peak physical condition and from his last fight and what he's been saying, I think he's finally done it and possibly realised his potential. He's got that "Eye of The Tiger" back and I think his strategy is probably the same as the late great Ali against Foreman. Pick him off, wear him down, set some traps and either knock out or a convincing points win. Joshua is far more composed and focused now, his speed and boxing IQ will be the difference in this one.
The last big power guy yall hyped up couldn't fight going backwards, I suspect this guy will have the same issue.
Ngannou can beat Joshua if he goes into the fight like Mike Tyson did in the first part of his career; Joshua just isn't islamic enough to win.
I think AJ just needs to keep Francis out of range to avoid taking a big shot, and if he does he should comfortably out-box Francis.  It will be interesting to see how Francis reacts if AJ starts landing his own big shots, but to me Francis looks likes he's made of granite and could withstand anything, unless he starts to gas in the later rounds.  For me, AJ wins as long as he doesn't walk onto a big right hand from Francis, who I think only wins by stoppage.
I enjoyed your views on this one, I couldn’t agree with you more
Joshua! Winter is coming! Winter is coming!...Courtesy of Ngannou "The Great and Powerful!" Including, the smackdown of overhyped Anthony Joshua. With tough Ngannou Nougies. Joshua's best strategy?! Bring a Mike Lindell "My Pillow!" For Joshua's rent free nitey night fight night knockout nap. On the canvas! If Joshua surrenders now; then, Ngannou "The Great and Powerful" can be very "MER-CI-FULL!" 😂😂😂
It would be class if francis is able to pull an upset
Is Mike tyson still teaching him for this fight
I first noticed the islamic takeover of boxing when Cassius "beat" Sonny Liston; now they have completed their objective with Beterbiev and Saudi control.
Crikey, the Saudis must be spending a fortune on this. Thanks Saudi. I’m looking forward to this fight. I’m rooting for Ngannou, but I’ve nothing against AJ. He’s a top guy too. It’s just that I would love to see Ngannou’s dream come true. Oh, and I’d love to see Ngannou attempt the flying punch again 😅
francis will end glass jaws boxing prospects, guys ridgid and has no foot movement, and if and its a big IF that fury does fight usyk and not pull out then he flattens fury if fury beats usyk and francis will prob lose on points against usyk (Thats if they are 12 rounds). Hope AJ losses after his turncoat view on the money match after calling fury  Also if these 2 met on the streets AJ would last about 30 seconds
3 fights and world champion. Just think about that for a moment hmm?? LMAO wtf is going on here!!
i think reality is finally gonna hit and Francis is going to lose, but if he manages to put on a good showing then he will still win in a way, i kinda have a feeling hes gonna get knocked out though
Love both of them. It’s a shame one of them has to lose. If I had to bet my house it would be AJ but I wouldn’t be surprised if Francis wins.
Francis Ngannou should expand these crossovers by fighting Rico Verhoeven, the undefeated kick-boxing world heavyweight champion.
Francis never been hurt with those little MMA gloves and he has been cracked. He's built different
The current Lineal Heavyweight Champion is Francis “The Predator” Ngannou from Cameroon. Francis could be the Lineal Heavyweight Champion in boxing and MMA at the same time
Francis all day. I hope he knocks out AJ.
Josh is on a rise again but with tonns of experience, he will outbox Francis
Can’t wait for the excuses when Francis Knocks AJ out!!! Fury was fighting Francis Conservatively to get out with minimal injuries to Fight Usyk!!! Stop It!!!
The winner of Fury/Usyk is already undisputed and deserves that shitty belt straight away. Let’s not change the rules. The Usyk and Fury fight if for undisputed, that is the final. Stop trying to shoehorn AJ into it and prolong things
Reaily good video bro. Smashed it
That Arab money has changed boxing. He changed the game!
AJ wins easy...
Joe rogan knows shot about boxing  Tyson fury the best heavyweight ever ? Based on what, beating ine trick poney wilder and overrated 41 years old klitschko.  Muhammad ali and holmes would school fury Bowe and lennox would knock his head off Liston and foreman would litterally wipe the floor with him
I can't decide who I want more to win, but I want this fight to be ended clearly.  No stupid stoppage,  bs decision or laughable excuses. Just let it happen at it's glory!
Yes ,aj haS never before fought a pro boxer who can't box before .. ngannou is an Okey guy, but causals are putting far too much into ngannou giving fury a simple FLASH KNOCKDOWN,  that had zero effect on fury afterwards, for the entire fight. And that's all ngannou was able to, for the fight, one simple irrelevant knockdown, and getting outboxed by fury for the rest of the fight🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Bring heavyweight boxing back to Vegas....and London. Stop killing the beautiful sport 🥊
Folks were out here saying creed 3 wasn't realistic because of how quickly Damien got the heavyweight belt, yet Francis is literally on his way to doing just that 😂
If AJ loses, this only goes to show once again, how poor the heavyweight division is.
I think aj will will but id be happy for francis too and if you fancy a gamble awesome odds on francis winning
Its going to be suprisingly easy for Ngannou, Ko in under 6 rounds. Joshua does not have a chin, Ngannou will land and AJ will go down, and he will not recover.
You're champing at the bit Brian and understandably so. But let's be realistic, Ngannou isn't going to cause any upset and if he's still standing after 10 rounds that would be amazing, but he would have been pounded to a pulp by then. But I expect the referee to stop the heavy bombardment and rescue Ngannou before round 10.
It’s mad how people right-off MMA fighters in boxing. As if they train in every discipline other than boxing?! They probably train boxing the most, with take down control being second. Hence why the vast majority of UFC scraps are boxing.
AJ will get crushed
Listening to this I know Bullshit Baffles Brains ffs.❤
expect the aj that turned up in the ruiz 2 fight a cautious fighter who will stick the jab and point fight
Francis beats AJ. I love both boxing and mma, I've watched these 2 from day 1. Francis is an animal like no other, he learns whilst fighting and very adaptable in the ring.
I think AJs speed is too much for Francis, we’ve had years of Ngannou footage and whilst he’s dynamite he is also very slow in comparison. Every man can land but if AJ fights a good gameplan and used his combinations and outvolumes Francis, it realistically should be one way traffic.
Good point there. AJ, insufferable head phones and it's not as his fists been doing the talk in a long time now. So when i see him like this again,  ..I need to see him cry in the ring.
Bet the PFL are either fucking sweating or fuming 🤣🤣😅
Joshua will make this fight look easy knockout by uppercut,people talking about ngannous power,I bet if you put Joshua in 4oz UFC gloves he hits way harder than ngannou.
Nobody does.
All I can always say about you, is how you say things in such a Weird manner but so interesting.
I reckon if true Geordie trained for a full year and fought tyson fury, he'd smash him.
AJ's weak chin gets him fall....Overeem fall.
Ramping it up, which is great. Cannot wait to see it. Just hope Fury keeps his end of the deal with Usyk and that part of the fight outcome doesn't fall apart...
Francis 💯 wins this fight no doubt about it joshua will rush in and try get the KO and will get caught just like he did against ruiz
In terms of power I'm not entirely convinced Nganou hits harder than Wlad.  And in terms of skill and speed, Nganou is nothing special.   So the only unique factors are the strength and maybe the chin of Nganou.
Brilliant !,👍😂😂🥊
AJ will beat him easy and in so doing will make himself look much better then Fury...Very smart move from AJ
I think AJ wins on points, but damn do I want Francis to win. He is just genuinely a good guy he deserves it
Ngannou is a beast. Not many will beat him. He’s solid. I think Fury would beat him if he fought on the backfoot. Fury will need to hang back and keep popping that jab, all night and then in the later rounds move to front foot.  Joshua is gonna have a battle here. My money is on Ngannou.
If Francis touches Josh he’s going to down no doubt
Eddie slung aj to the lion....they all want the doe .....its gonna be funny in a month or so after these fights n the fury fight...be interesting to see how this pans out...Eddie n brick top best mates now...who would have guessed it
If AJ is smart, he will fight Ngannou the same way he fought Andy Ruiz in their second fight. Box and stay away from him.
Respectfully...  The fact that people are surprised and amazed that these kind of good things are happening, is actually very sad.  The good events and good fortune that has come upon Ngannou isn't sad, but the fact that so many people have been so mentally, spiritually, philosophically beaten down, that witnessing a person merely rise to meet a possibility that always existed, amazes them;  That's what's sad.  The amazement is an amazement from a pessimistic mind, and doubtful heart....  A heart so steeped in that ignorant pessimism that it borderline CHERISHES unbelief... As if being "realistic" in that pessimistic kind of way, is a virtue.  If you are truly gifted at ANYthing... You should already be starting from the mindset of:   "I don't have to go through their traditional protocols, or examinations to arrive at my professional destination;  And I don't need to jump through their traditional hoops..."   I'm already ready...  Period.
It's one of those "anything could happen" fights
Lol ‘fury looks like a lump of shot’ 😝😂🤣 your so funny haha 😆
AJ says he wants to take his soul. Homelessness, sandmining, boarder hoping and Dana White couldn't so all I can say is good luck
1:28 that’s the storyline of Crash Bash
The thing with Francis is he has a chin And he’s willing to trade
🇮🇪  brilliant
The reason I love boxing is you can guess the result but quite often the underdog wins. All AJ as to do is stop Frances from winning. One thing for sure both men want it badly. I think it will be an incredible fight. What a time to love boxing. I think a lot of new eyes will be viewing this year
You know its even more corrupt AF when someone who is sportswashing is calling the shots on who fights who. Pos.
See Geordie, you missed something though, if Francis has been doing this as long as AJ, he would’ve been corrupt by the politics and he would not be fighting the best of the best and his first two fights. That’s a fact so let’s be happy late to the party.
😂You Britts Really Pump up Your fighters.  AJ should retire.  Ya’ll wont be happy until he’s flat on his back.  He is the most one dimensional and manufactured active Boxer.
Fury has a better footwork than AJ that's why I believe Ngannou will stop AJ in the 5th round.
how does this guy still even have a voice. If you want proper boxing knowledge do not listen to this clown, he doesn’t have a scooby.
I’m a boxing fan, but I cannot argue with one word you say here TG
I get you're a fan of Ngannou, but was it really necessary to say, "Francis is more of a man than Otto Wallin could ever hope to be"? Wallin was nothing but class in his loss to AJ. Gave him all the props and conceded to his talent.
Going out there on a limb but I can see Francis doing him in like 😅
After Francis kO AJ then yall will understand why his call the predator.
Seriously, Ngannou fought competently in his first pro boxing match, losing a decision against Tyson 'For-the-Money' Fury in EXO-Mode; YES, his durable and has a big punch... IF Joshua cannot beat him, he's truly DONE!
Aj sparks him inside 6 rounds. Francis is very good. But aj should dismantle him. With his boxing skills and technically work class.
During the BLM bullshit Ngannou never ranted on a mic to a crowd in the street to boycott white businesses in Britain...I know who I'm backing
Easy, easy, easy nights work for Joshua.
Excellent analysis
Wtf are we talking about here?  Like how hard does Ngannou hit?  Because he flash knockdown Fury on an off balance counter?  MMA dudes don’t hit anywhere as hard as Boxers and we saw that in a ton of them trying to crossover, and case in point being the McGregor vs Floyd.  He caught Floyd clean but the 3rd when he was goofing around and all Floyd did was smile and go on to fuck him up.  AJ is going to get way more credit for when he smashes Francis, but I don’t think it will be a hard day at the office for him.
Dude, every time I try and give you a chance, because you make good ponts, but man....Really? If Usyk does what he did to Joshua, and if AJ mops the floor with Ngannou, he will have beat the same people but better? What people? AJ lost to Usyk twice and pretty bad! Leave it man. AJ wanting to put boxing on the map, like there have been no events before him?
Fury performed better vs Klitschko and Whyte than Joshua did. The only difference is that Joshua knocked out Wallin. I know you hate Fury but at least stick to the facts before you spin a narrative.
Feeling like this won’t be as spectacular. No knockouts, no knockdowns just AJ winning on points.
Love your content man.
Brother I love your video. Truly genuine in fairness very entertaining for the fans. Yes everything you said was absolutely true and accurate. It would be nice if you can cover more of AJ and Ngauou. I feel a big guy like you should cover the big monsters of boxing. Looking forward to more of your content now that I am a huge fan of your channel
This is all complete madness. AJ is going to make Francis look like a complete amateur and it’s not going to be remotely competitive. It’s easy pickings.
At this point i hope ngannou wipes out aj and fury or usyk takes all the belts.... what a documentary they could make on his life if he does it
Francisc N. is making Boxing interesting and lovely againg. ❤
AJ has one huge asset on his side and that is revenge imagine if AJ beats ngannou easily it will make Fury look silly thats a huge motivation for AJ DONT be suprised if he beats ngannou trust me revenge is a dish best served cold !!!!!!
How do you know how hard Ngannou hits hard with these heavy boxing gloves? He never knocked out Fury or even made had him seriously hurt like Wilder done. AJ demolishes big guys and nasty. Ngannou will get knocked out inside 5 rounds.
Bald racist
Being watching Francis since he joined the UFC, but one thing everyone is overseeing and ignoring is the fact Francis HAD A BAD FIGHT in the UFC vs Derrick Lewis, they were scared of each other and did nothing so please mention that because it is one of the few black marks of Francis Ngannou MMA career
Looking forward to you getting cancelled again 😂
Fury rebuffed this guy and now hes gone from wanting furys hog down his throat to loathing his entire soul😂😂😂
Is Mike tyson helping Francis  again?
Aj should faked some injury like bones to get out of this fight with the head up
TG is such a fraud. He really does not know a thing about this sport 😂
Francis will win I have no doubts
This guy has no idea what he's talking about
I don't care how big and strong Ngannou is with real TNT power and a granite jaw, 'cause he'll need all of that and more to match AJ in this Bata dance. The god of Thunder is laced in AJ's fists, and he'll fork lightning and send shock waves in the arena and thru the boxing fraternity.
His excellency about to turn around and be like "the winner of the fight fights brian"
You dont know anything about boxing
lets all sell our souls for Saudi money. 😪😪
...and FN has never fought someone like AJ
Ngannou is in the Guinness Book of Records for having the hardest recorded punch in the world. AJ has quite literally never stood in front of a power like this man possesses. I'd probably back AJ against any other ranked boxer, but Francis... He's just different.
Much respect for both . Big fan of both . Do not ride off AJ .  I think AJ stops Francis
Francis will spank Ray jay
He would have beaten Tyson if he was more experienced and won the money / championship rounds the last two. Tyson made sure he won them with his experience if Francis went for him the last two he would of won
Francis is there for destiny, the paycheck is nice, but Francis is following a dream.  He showed he has the power and it isn't as demished as everyone said in boxing gloves. If Francis' accuracy,  power, and patience, all come to play, he's gonna hurt Anthony.
Never underestimate anyone here, it is war between Nigeria 🇳🇬 and Cameroon 🇨🇲 . All victory and honour will go to Africa. The children of Africa are demonstrating their talents and skills. Let the best win but I am going for Nganou
I don't think anyone knows how good Francis is. Yes, he did well against Tyson, but he was holding back. He was more worried about making a mistake than ending the fight. He has said he knows that was his mistake. Not that he shouldn't fight smart, but when he gets a chance, don't hold back. He stung Tyson with a punch that wasn't full power. Just think about that.
Aj has never been hit with proper heavyweight power Francis will sleep him when he land's one 👊💥💤💤💤💤💤💤 and Francis has been hit and walked through bigger hitters than Joshua
They v e actually taken over Boxing now they really have. Their doing what they want and their paying the money big style
Francis will win this fight
I think the Ben Davison connection is so important for AJ, i was so tired of watching AJ but he looked rejuvenated in his last fight, and Ngannou imo will get sorted within 8 rounds.
FURY BEATS USYK!!!! 🐐
Great video bro
Francis beating aj means he’s the mma goat? In a boxing match? what are u smokin 😭
Saudi has literally saved boxing. How crazy is that.
Francis will always be a hero for taking this and the Fury fight.. Even if he loses..One for the history books ..  Joshua has always been obsessed with Fury yet he hates him..
Thankyou turki for the Turkey teeth
I love Nnganno have always rooted for him. Haven said this, yall be talking about Francis mental edge well, everyman got a plan until he gets punched in the face. Any fighter can doubt themselves and get careful when fighting a powerful puncher. Go watch francis and derrick lewis in UFC, the fight after his lost to Stipe you will see Frnacis isn’t has mentally tough as you think he got scared to engage with lewis cos he was beaten previously and now fighter a puncher. He did nothing, couldn’t even throw a punch yet running scared and lost the fight. Easy said than done by the way millions of pple had crossed the sea to get to europe from africa is nothing new poverty brings such determination. I rest my case.
🔥🔥
I think Francis is biting a lot more than he can chew... Fury has pillow hands compared to Joshua
Great vid Brian!! 👌🫵👍
AJ my goat will make this look easy.
Mostly agree with TG here. But by no means am i more pumped for this or any other fight in combat sports in sny weight class than the undisputed heavyweight title fight.. But that in my opinion might line up a Usyk vs AJ 3. Id rather see Usyk masterclass the hell out of Ngannou. And he definitely would.
Joshua inside 4
This guy talks so much 💩😂 he literally hates fury and wants his downfall so bad. I’ve watched the first 9 minutes of this and he’s spoke about Tyson more than the two fighters actually fighting 😂 embarrassing.
Everyone is channelling their focus on in this to take the heat off the fury ducking usyk in a minute. Just wait and see.
Yes Love them both may the best man win
One thing Brian you said that every man can be broken which is true. But I don’t think nnganou can be broken. Stipe fight 1 his body was broken because he was gassed but his mind never broke. He was gassing out his arse start of round 2 and still lasted the distance. Nnganou is a freak we only ever see every 100+ years.
Truth. My exact thoughts and sentiments precisely. I'll be over the moon for whichever guy pulls it off and hope the winner eventually claims undisputed. They both deserve it
The fact that this is even being debated just shows how sad the heavyweight boxing division still is…
I’m telling you now AJ will make Francis look out of place like he don’t belong on a boxing ring fury has always been overrated & i said a very long time ago AJ will be the last one standing mark my words,AJ will out box & probs spark Francis out or just out box him win every round & make it look easy,people banging on how hard Francis can punch,he only dropped fury once & people forgetting AJ is a very big banger to,but again a lot of people saying how AJ has to win & win looking good has to knockout Francis something that wasn’t put on fury,but watch AJ punch up Francis
😂😂 true gordie is insane the guys 0-1 in boxing and hea talking about him possibly being undisputed 😂😂 ffs he was given a top ten ranking because he wouldn't get there otherwise Remember no MMA fighter has ever beat a boxer in a boxing match and never will period
Over hyping Ngannou.... Ngannou has been beat before in MMA and will in boxing the man needed to fight Jon Jones in my eyes!!!!
I'm not actually bothered who wins i just wanna see Ngannou do well and put up a good fight.
Why is ur man wearing a drone as a hat
Money is the glue to all of it ❤😂
Not even close mate...joshua is not fury...he will not play around with francis...especially now all saw what francis has!this will be embarrassing for francis
I'm loving this whole Saudi boxing saga turki is like a kid in a sweet shop you can tell he loves the sport the more money he throws at these promoters the more epic fight cards we'll have long may it continue 🥊
I want I want spoiled kid
I like both AJ and Francis....but I see AJ going to sleep in this one..  I think Fury was the worst match up for Francis...  Fury's movement,reach IQ and experience fighting Wilder just put him in a great position vs Francis...and Francis still had success..  Francis is a Bad match up for AJ..  Francis is Big strong,good reach ,huge power..and sneaky fast hands..  AJ will probably implement a similar plan as he did in Ruiz 2 or the Parker fight...use his Jab and good movement..to try get a Decision..  But Francis has better reach than Ruiz and is good at timing counters..  I can't see him not catching AJ over 10 rounds..  Either way I'll be happy with whoever wins..it would be great for AJ to out do Fury..and it would be great for Francis to shock the world .
Stipe broke him in the first fight bad
what alex pereira did is more impressive than what francis could do imo. 2 weight glory and ufc champ. unheard of.
Speed kills
Why is everyone so hyped up for American or  UK fighters? I think east European fighters like Bivol, Usyk or Lomachenko are much more exciting to watch, and they remind me of grandmasters in chess. Fury was exciting when he had more movement like in Klitschko or Wilder 1, but now he is so flat-footed.... AJ vs Usyk reminded me of an american Muscle Car that tries to beat a Porsche on a racetrack. Stupid power vs Intelligent precision
Nganou and AJ have both brought a much needed boost in activity and excitement that boxing has desperately needed.
I said this years ago, throw away the ABCXYZ  belts and have a grand slam tournament similar to tennis, only best qualify, Oscar is only into bribes and corruption, sweat pea 😜. AJ is a bodybuilder not a boxer same as Wilder,  heavyweight boxing has been unfit in strength and skill and speed in the last 20 years. Heavy weight boxing is coming back
i love both guys mann, may the best man win..
Elbow when he was desperate 😮
i like the fact that they "respect" each other it will be a barnstormer of a scrap when they get in the  ring
Come on, Ngannau! 👏
Im gonna be honest i came into the boxing world trough influencer boxing... but now i understand why boxing fans call that a circus. The way thewe real fighters carry themselfs during a press conferenc and faceoff is different and way more respectable.
Hope he goes all the way bout time they got found out, had it easy for to long ...go kn franny 😁😁
AJ doesn't have the chin to take this. AJ is going to sleep.
Greed for money  can bring people together
this turkey guy is dodgy asf
Is this 10 rounds like the fury fight??
😂 I swear to god AJ could pick his nose and people would make a video analysing him
When aj beats fransis the fury fans will be so mad especially  when he already  gets beat by usyc
Are people out here surprised that Ngannou can "Throw Hands" ??🤔 That's literally his main attribute in MMA!😂😂
Yes let’s add another belt, that’s what boxing needs, more belts 🙄
Francis gonna do a  Rozenstruik on AJ the racist role model
Easy money for Joshua
Brilliant video Brian like share subscribe and support the channel
Bro stop it. Styles make fights and AJ is all wrong for him given what I saw vs Fury. AJ comfortably beats him.
It should be a great fight, I don't ever remember seeing Ngannou getting hurt by a punch in UFC. Will be interesting to see what tactics AJ plays, hit and run or stand and trade. These press conferences are so cringing to watch - the promotors continuously blowing smoke up his excellencies a... A thousand thankyou's for lining my bank account with yet more money. It's embarrassing how many times they feel the need to thank him!
Francis did get koed by a much smaller stipe and derick Lewis
The same people that said Tyson was ruining boxing for boxing the same guy absolutely licking AJ's bollocks like a dog fucking bums🤣
I predict an Ngannou team towel throw Joshua will box his head off.
Is this fight an exhibition?
You were saying it was a disgrace when fury announced he was fighting ngannou but now is praising AJ for fighting him?
This fight is a pickem, Francis only needs to connect and AJ should be able to outbox Francis, anything can happen, this fight has woken up the boxing community.
I absolutely love your analysis, everything you said was based on common sense and I love that. Thanks
Bradley’s 260 though
Francis sure needs to be more aggressive than he was against Fury. If he tries to out box AJ he’s crazy. He’s ONLY got a chance if he goes for the ko and happens to get a good one on.
I'll pick the black one to win 🥊
I want to see Francis switch to southpaw 3rd round, and see what AJ does. lol
And I believe Ngannou never fought someone like AJ🙌🏿
Hes not fought anyone like AJ either
Francis crossed the Colour hurry desert all the way crossed the Shark infested Mediterranean Sea 🌊   AJ born around all the British  deities.  AJ should be worried.   Inner strength of Nganou is very high.
He fraught Cyril Gane. Who has the body type of an AJ, but with the movement of a fury, might move better than fury.
If I’m being honest I can see it going AJs way with a decision, since Francis had never been rocked in his career and his jaw is made out of steel
Sick of hearing about wallin wtf Wallin sucks nganou would put wallin out proper in 3 rounds AJ coudnt even drop him never mind knock him out😂 coudnt even hurt franklin either so what can he do to nganou😂
Never forget Joshua got smashed by a fat Mexican and a cruiserweight twice.
Tbh pal your talking about Otto Wallin not being anywhere near the size of Ngannou is nonsense 🙄  Its not about how big you upper body is in boxing,  Its about MOVEMENT ! Range , speed and timing , all these would be better on Wallin , its not easy to land punches on a man that is moving around,  especially if every time you try he leans back and puts a 3 or 4 punch combo on you or even just a 2 punch combo , its sickening!! And implants doubt !! Ngannou will need to be a lot more experienced than he was with that other Gaboon 😂
Aj smaller then fury easy KO win for Francis
Maybe Aj had thicker sole. Shows on to make him taller lol
Hope Francis ko aj so the judges don't cheat
AJ couldn't stop Usyk
Love the fact fury in his head 24/7 he can’t help but mention him and call him in his videos
Iv been a fan of Francis since he walked into the cage and im still a bigger fan after he stepped into the ring and proved everyone wrong against Fury, AJ may b fast and has more experience but he got his ass whipped by Ruiz which is alot smaller so don't sleep on Francis because his mind set is alot different and he can take a punch..he is strong and he knows more about boxing than people give him credit for as a beginner
AJ will destroy Nganou. He will do everything that Fury should have done. He will make him look like the amateur he is. I guarantee it
AJ is shhhhhtting himself. Protecting his chin is gonna hamper him. And when ONE connects?
agreed.  boxing in Saudi is dull for the fans
His ear phone is their to tell him what to say. He is a plant
Joshua's got bad nerves and a suspect chin he might be in trouble.
Heavyweight boxing is a joke. If you are big and athletic you can become a heavyweight boxer. If Nganou was in any other weight division he would get destroyed.
2:18
Easy fight for Francis.  Francis will break AJ's glass jaw.
Amazing how salty this lad is since Fury petulantly walked out on his interview
Francis Ngannou by KO!
This guy is such a complete moron. Fury won the fight easy and didn't even train.
I hope AJ & Fury both win their fights because i still want to see them fight each other.
think fury did train for ngannou but he had no answer having thrown everything at him including a possible elbow ,he just got on his bike and and stole it on points, joshua may regret taking this fight I think ngannou beats them all including uysk he,ll knock um all out
You fools were saying Fury vs Ngannou was a mismatch now your all for Joshua getting whooped  by him!
Sitting down eating dinner watching Brian's breakdown of the latest combat sports news... doesn't get better than this
Ngannou kos Joshua
Francis should go full on Mike Tyson style against AJ. That would be awesome.
EMBRACE YOUR SELVES FOR THE FREAK SHOW. "NGANOU " The predator is here to reign.
daniel dubois vs frances   i believe daniel would win
I think it’s safe to say Francis hasn’t faced anyone like AJ either tbf
Francis eats elbows for breakfast, kicks for lunch. Ngannou foe the win.
its not a fight but a  boxing match. Francis broke completely during Stipe 1 and mentally broke vs Derrick Lewis the following fight.
Aj about to punch him back to the motherland
I think Joshua will best Francis. Buy hey I was wrong about Francis about the Fury fight.
Aj glass jaw if Ngannou find his chin hes done
For me people are like Fury “off night?” More like no drugs and doggy gloves!
This is a really tough fight for AJ. He should be favourite but its going to take somethint special to stop Ngannou.
Worst take I’ve ever heard is beating AJ in a boxing ring makes Ngannou the best MMA fighter ever. Wind it in Geordie, we all have our opinions and I happen to enjoy listening to yours, always have.. but that’s ridiculous.
If Francis plans to rough AJ and fight inside please inform him that Aj got the most devastated uppercut in current heavyweight
We saw the look in Fury's eyes when he was hit by Ngannou, how will Joshua cope under pressure and while hurt. Will he spit his gumshield out?
AJ will absolutely demolish him completely getting OTT with this Ngannou!🤷‍♂️
Is Mike Tyson still involved with Francis?
This fight s gonna go of watch can’t wait think it’s gonna be a banger
Problem is every one has been fooled  that Fury is good .... he really is not look at who he has fought and all his accolades come from Wilder who is bloody awful , been nursed through a career to get the biggest paydays, he was dodging AJ and put some stupid time limit for the contract to be signed.
Francis has the speed advantage .
Joshua wins early ko
Francis K.O. Joshua in round 1.
Thank you for your honest and Unbiassed opinion and thoughts    I really enjoy that👊
Just coz AJ stopped Klitschko (who was 41 at the time) and AJ was in London whereas Fury was in Klitschko's backyard, and that Fury didn't stop Wallin makes zero difference or means AJ destroys Fury. Styles make fights, Fury beats AJ on points 8 days a week
Ngannou by decision is 18/1 😮
Nganous powers average, i dont need to hear but but but he knocked down fury..so did an Estonian journeyman
Francis by KO!!
If I am wrong about Fury and him being a complete FAKE ,  Ngannou will KO Joshua , However if I am right about Fury ? Joshua with either give Ngannou a boxing lesson or knock him spark out ?? Fury has already started to get exposed when Parker showed exactly how good Wilder REALLY is !! Then Joshua completely smashed Wallin who gave Fury nightmares 😳  I FIRMLY believe Fury has had everybody off ??
Aj will mess him up badly
Ngannou 100% takes the W.  FREAK OF NATURE. After this fight NO one is ever going to want to fight Nganou until he start to slow down. Good he's getting he's money now as everyone is going to avoid fighting him
There's no way Ngannou will let the opportunity to fight the undisputed pass him by. He will brutalized AJ. No doubt 👍
Joshua will be picking him off with the jab using footwork to circle him and picking him off to the body with big shots winning every round then nganou will get desperate and start coming forward then nganou gasses in 8 9 10 and gets tko somewhere between those rounds
Fury thought Ngannou would be in the same mode as Dillian Whyte and Chisora, slow flatfooted and easy to read/manipulate but Ngannou's kept his shape and didn't fall for any of Fury's feints. Then he tried to employ the tactics he used with Wilder, fall in after his shots to smother him but he quickly realized that Ngannou is the most physically strongest man he's ever stepped in the ring with. This intimidated Fury for the rest of the fight and Fury reverted to boxing and moving. AJ needs to stick to the fundaments and be disciplined! ram that jab down Ngannou's throat, make him pay when he comes into range with 3 shot combos and move off to the side. Eventually Ngannou will get frustrated, start swinging wildly and leave lots of openings. Fury got cocky AJ must NOT do the same
Geordie come on ffs Wlad hits much harder than Ngannou
I dont rate Dylan Whyte... but he is miles ahead of Ngannou as a boxer.  Nganou has a decent left hook. His only hope is to hit AJ with a ruiz punch from the Gods.  99/100 AJ wins.
WELL SAID 👑
Who designed that belt? A 10 year old 😂
Francis by ko uppercut from hell.
The pain Game be honest you're more going for Francis you're attitude shows it. But francis will be dismantled he will be only remembered as MMA undisputed champion not in boxing
I genuinely look forward to seeing a new pain game video come up in my feed.. one of my top 3 YouTube channels. Always the truth and an opinion I agree with probably 95 percent of the time. Thanks for all ya hard work mate, love it!
klitscho hit harder than francis
OVEREEM is just as Big as Aj or bigger and Just as Skilled or More Skilled. Kickboxing titles K-1 , Glory Overeem was a UNIT Juiced to the Gills and Francis Took his Head off with Uppercut
If Francis somehow manages to beat AJ.  That shouldn’t automatically give him a shot at the undisputed championship.  There are other fighters who have earned their place in the rankings. I can’t see the sanctioning bodies allowing it. That is unless this undisputed title is fabricated by the Saudis. This is more like something from a Rocky movie.
"It's the Eddie Hearn show, apples n' pears"
MMA guys still have that mindset of old school kung fu guys who think they can kill anyone cos of what they can do on some floor mats
This guy is a weird freak but i got hear the fight fans opinions. Only reason im here.
Ahh my god. So excited for Boxing... the Arab has money to burn 😅
Geordie Shilling for Francis will Never Not be funny
Betting the house on Francis. 🍻
Joshua will ko francis!!!
Why don’t they ever thank the double excellent turkey? Ungrateful bastards
Fury a Man who has overcome unbelievable life obstacles and a world class massive boxer, aj just a freak and a role model, ngannou is one of a kind. What they all gunna say when aj outs ngannou?  the levels that aj is at compared to Tyson and wilder will show? but Tyson can still beat Usyk and say u all dossers 😅, I say Turkey sheikh needs to activate money mode sheik level and make a Premier league of the top 10 boxers and let them go at it home and away for  couple of years , also all survivors deserve an island each and free oil if needed. AJ fan. He beats ngannou
Francis to shock the world. Round 6/7 AJ gets knocked out after being up on the cards. Unless he hides on the outside.
AJ hasn't fought a boxer who hasn't won a fight and only had one fight...true geordie you are correct he hasn't fought anyone like him
The Saudi dudes tea towel is a mess. But then again the fact that he's part of a regime which murders dissidents, chops up journalists, murders homosexuals, bombs women and children and treats women as 2nd class citizens is pretty sketchy too
Great fight run down as ever. Ngannou is a beast of a man and will test any heavyweight. He will walk through punches and he hits with enormous power. AJ has to keep it long use the jab and the occasional heavy right hand and keep away from Ngannou’s huge right hand.
Joshua might find himself being manhandled in the clinch, with a strength and guile he's not used to either, like Fury just did.
okay dude come on now
I suppose the question is whether or not the anti-Wilder tactics will work as anti-Ngannou tactics. Up until Joseph Parker flipped the script that's the fight they would've been preparing for.
AJ wins but he doesn’t hurt Francis in any way, no one in boxing right now hurts Francis, only chance is Wilder and even then I doubt it.
AJ is gonna win easily with Ngannou.
Episode 52 of Geordie absolutely glizzying Ngannou
Cringe video. Ngannou did well but all he has is a puncher’s chance which is very possible in heavyweight boxing.  Don’t over hype it though
DC vs Marvel lol
I expect AJ to rely on his footwork, step in and out of range, set traps, and gradually chop the tree down. If Ngannou and his team focus on dominant footwork this camp... night night AJ.
Pretty hard one to call tbh…. 2 huge beasts going at it
Loved the vid.. Frank and Eddie 'C'mon big bro.. all the way to the bank'
AJ wins comfortably
1 massive advantage over everyone of these boxers is that when they having face off the boxer is thinking this guy could kill me with my bare hands however he wants, didn't see aj usual tough guy act saying stuff like "your not about that life" as he has said many times before 😂👌 saying that francis is getting destroyed against aj but even the he can get up off the floor shake hands look aj in the eye say good fight and They both still know who is the dominant man 💯
AJ vs Wilder? (never happened). Now that Saudi money is involved.. AJ changed his mind and agreed to fight Francis. 😨
TG doing tricks on it for Francis lately 🤣
I can’t wait.
I’m not a fan of these cross over fights but I hope Francis wins, but AJ probably will.
All this talk about Francis never boxing before is a load of bollocks. He never had a professional boxing match but he's been a striker his MMA career and he started boxing training years before his MMA training. And he sparred boxing his entire fighting career ffs. Guy was sparring Joyce years ago!
He has. He's fought dillian whyte
AJ has better cardio, better boxing skills, more experience. The only thing that Ngannou has going for him is his power. And that is where things usually go wrong. Here are some of the same situations that happened lately: AJ(power) vs Usyk(everything else), Usyk vs Dubios, Parker vs Wilder, Fury vs Wilder. A lot of those fights don't go the way of the stronger fighter. There is always a puncher's chance, but still, AJ should take that easily
Ngannou has been fury, gane and Lewis
How does the winner of this fight  for undisputed? Madness
A agree Brian if Francis can pull this off wow am betting on him he can punch got good i Engine etc he has nothing to lose bud take care big Kenny from jock land
To say you looking forward To see this over the only and first ever undisputed match with the fighters who both beat Fran and aj is to me just showing your complete disregard for the sport and your hate for fury im also hyped for it but it will be nothing to uysk fury
I believe Nganou I can't help but believe him because his faith is so infectious and that man can dig deep mentally and the blokes got skills speed power and determination we know that I'm favouring Francis unless AJ can step his game up I think Nganou wins
If Joshua goes straight at ngannou and trades for the knockout he will get caught and knockout cold ngannou is a absolute beast hard as nails and can take a punch
You are not knocking Ngannou out, but AJ will gas Ngannou out, he was tired agaisnt fat fury just counter punching
Everything says aj but I'm sat on the fence with this one. May the best man win
You are absolutely disregarding the fact that Joshua is focused again and looked better in his last fight than in the last few years.
It's raining men.. thats what AJ listening to so I heard
I mean vlad was a better boxer than ngannou so he has
Joshuas getting knocked the f out
Big fan of Ngannou, his story is tremendous, and no one can take away from him what he did against Fury. But I gotta go with AJ on this fight. This is a boxing match, and AJ has far superior skills. He will manage distance with the jab, and wear down Ngannou by drawing him into the later rounds, where cardio fitness will matter more. AJ by a decision.
Turkey is just a boxing fan and is making these fights for himself since he’s so rich
Francis is talking too much.
AJ is gonna fight like Ruiz 2. Box and stay away from that power
MMA-friendly youtubers doing their damndest to psyop AJ into losing. Hope he stays the heck away from all media until the fight.
Would love to see Ngannou win but realistically I can just see Aj's speed and ring IQ being too much and him cruising to a late tko or decision.
Fury puts Joshua OUT within 5
That hammer fist from ngannou would be deadly in a street fight
Otto f. .kin Wall In?? Why does everybody keep talking about him?
Totally agree with Geordie when he says it's lucky for them lot Nganou wasn't in the boxing from years ago but lol but I reckon the mma experience has to be giving him something different to bring to the table and that different thing could be the ticket to Francis's success for example you talk about ring craft maybe the ring craft from mma has made Nganou better than if he'd been into boxing for years just maybe for Nganou the recipe creates an all round better warrior in combat sports ,
Anthony needs the eye of the tiger. Big softy. To much money and will walk straight into a big right hand. Brain damage is on the cards. 🥊o-o🥊
He's the Predator he's fought the best MMA fighters in the world.Francis is not fazed.
Ngannou is on a cosmic destiny. AJ goes down within 6 rounds. It’s already happened
Entirely apropos of nothing, if AJ is a "legend", what does that make Usyk? 🙃
I love Francis and what a man he is but I think AJ wins this. I think either a late KO or points. Then I think it is AJ vs Fury double. If AJ wins against Fury twice then he retires and champion of the world.
It’s been a while since I’ve found myself this excited for a fight; two absolute beasts going at it round after round. This being said, I’m banking on an AJ knockout around the 6th-7th round. Francis has tremendous power, but AJ showed world class ability and power in his last fight, and I believe Francis will get more tired than last time and AJ will dig deep and put together one of those devastating combinations.
AJ is going to need a Nuclear punch to take out Francis. Francis is a former UFC champion and can take pain, leg kick, liver kicks, and he can handle punch, and If he touches AJ his done.
Joshua will knock nganou out in 4-6 rounds he will smash him to bits. The tyson fury v nganou fight is no yard stick what so ever as fury didn't train for it did he
anyone else think this is the exact story of creed 3 😂
Everyone is MASSIVELY overlooking Francis fighting intelligence...he has already worked out AJ already...'Good but orthodox'....he is used switching SP/Orthodox but know how much it screws with ingrained 'trained' boxer's minds...Ngannou wins this all day long...like watching wing-chun guys try MMA fight...same w Tyson Fury 'clinche' ...mentally couldn't get around another unorthodox style
If AJ loses would he say "Hip hip?!! Champ champ!!" and then maybe spit on Eddie and throw him out the ring since there's no belts. 🤣
I know boxing is different but Ngannou has fought MMA fighters wearing 4 ounce gloves and none have touched his chin or damaged him, AJ hit's harder but Francis hits harder, we'll find out who can really take who's power.
Tom Aspinall knocks them both out
Aj shouldn’t count on Francis coming southpaw again. Southpaw vs Fury was the game plan and that caught Fury off guard. And Aj is well prepared against southpaws, he is also preparing for Usyk.  I predict Francis coming orthodox and jabbing more. He couldn’t do that vs Fury cause of Fury’s reach and in and out. Aj on the other hand relies on his jab and power. And Aj had always reach advantage, not this time. Unless Aj is much quicker, it will be a battle of power jabs.
Teddy Atlas said once a fighter becomes a champion they get 30% better, Francis Ngannou although he didn't beat Fury on the scorecard, the way the fight went he feels like he won the fight and it's going to give him that extra edge, plus he's a UFC champion already. Big mentality.
It's gonna be easy for A.J. and I don't even like him, Fury did really bad because of the fitness, he looked extremely slow on he's feet, Nganou did better then everyone expected, but he didn't look anything special.
Francis has never had his chin tested either but he will AJ will destroy him within 4 rounds he will end this joke of a man.
fury is a dosser
Joshua is also pretty strong. I saw a video of him lifting a car
People think Francis only has power. Even now, when he has shown great boxing skill vs the supposed "best ever HW", outboxing him at times with SKILL. Still they have this dumb mindset of "oh he has power and can KO anyone if he lands".
Fury v usyk is bigger then joshua v francis and joshua has had 3 of furys left overs haha
They're like children calling him your excellency 😂
Why do you keep saying Nganou is a beginner at boxing?  He has been boxing for over 30 years.  He was a boxer for years before taking up MMA.
I'm glad you mentioned AJ's stupid fucking earbud.  Not only does he look like a total pleb but it's incredibly rude too.   I'm a huge Boxing fan. Favourite boxer has been Usyk since I watched him in London 2012. However......... I hope Francis brutally KO's AJ.
Ive still never seen anyone hurt ngannou in any of his fights
It's very interesting, and Francis is an amazing guy, but Im 90% sure Joshua is going to beat him relatively easily. Fury was and is currently awful and he did not take Ngannou seriously. - Joshua will take him very seriously and he stays in shape, plus he's bee very active. It'll last as long as Francis is tough.
this is going to be interesting fight, for sure. Surprises of this type are only possible in heavyweight division and Nganou has a puncher's chance. I just don't think he will be able to counter after received punches like he did against Fury. Against Fury, he was almost immediately striking back. I don't know if that's gonna be the case against Joshua. On the other hand, have we seen ever Joshua fighting on a back foot? Because Nganou could bring the heat to AJ... I am slightly going for AJ to win it, but if Ngannou does it, I wouldn't be super surprised.
I'd like to thank his excellency for this video
Your more up for the aj vs Francis because it’s a 50/50 where as usyk is gonna wipe the floor with fury
Francis is the exact opposite of Jake Paul.
AJ will give him a lesson in boxing
Just waiting now for Fury to pull out of the Usyk fight 🤔 His Ego wont be able take the L that's coming   Furys been a spent force for a long time Ngannou Whyte Chisora Fury might of won these fights but extremely poorly  When usyk beats him last thing fury will want is a rematch cant see that happening  🥊
this man glazes Francis Ngannou more than anybody on earth
Anthony joshua is a BATTY MAN 100%..hope he gets a pasting the big fake.
Aj has been in there with big punchers such as klitshcko, povetkin, whyte etc
Say what you want whatever happens AJ is a brave motherfucka for taking this fight it’s good to see him back in rhythm.
Aj may not knock him out but i would say he can get him to quit on his stool thou too much speed with power and fought the best heavyweights out there Ngannou might hit hard not fought the best and Aj will probably be to much for him .
You are right' hes never fought an MMA fighter before
Anthony Joshua will show the lvls there are to boxing which fury never could
Francis gets the K.O within 4 rounds.
How can aj put boxing on the map when fury has already done that frank warren has thrown eddie a bone and now they think there running with it 😅
I know Brain mentioned AJ not being present, but like the sportswear brands could he have an earbuds sponsor?
I don’t even know if that’s possible haha a true Geordie came out there
I know you like Ngannou but i just dont think you understand how serious AJ will take this.
Really like both of these guys, best of luck to both of them ✌️
The pain game is the best... Love love it 🙌👍
I am so excited for this fight 🔥 Can't wait! Great vid as always, solid points. I agree Francis will continue to improve and is super mentally strong. Great insight too on if things kicked off, no one is beating Francis. I feel Fury started to realize that too in their fight. And it's fascinating to see imo. Before the fight Fury was entertaining a rematch in mma according to him.. haven't heard a peep about it since the fight tho 😅
I predict big boom KO
There both massive weapons i mean they've probably both got massive weapons 😂
Real street fight Jon Jones destroys both
Thanks Brian. Big love, kindest regards, Richard U.K
Has Ngannou ever been hit by a bloke like AJ?
If Ngannou connects with AJ’s jaw, AJ loses. But I don’t think he’ll connect and AJ will take the fight without Ngannou landing anything significant but it’ll be a decision victory.
Even Usyk that doesn't carry heavyweight power was able to hurt Joshua with his punches. What ya'll think is going to happen against Ngannou
🧙‍♂️
They both have dynamite in their hands. Having said that, the way the fight unfolds will very much depend on the approach. I see AJ trying to box Francis on the outside, then try to counter when he steps in, he has the attributes to do so. In having said that, Francis’ power only takes a good knock, and he’s also patient. Could be a longer night than what people think.
I love all your videos but you are blowing a lot of smoke up francis now he’s had one fight so far against a rusty fury and still lost I think it will be a blow for blow great tho
Thanks True , for not sleeping on Francis , we are both UFC fans
Francis will beat joshua imo
Good job geordie keep it up.
He hasn't fought anyone like Ngannou because Boxing is 12 rounds & Francis can only do 10. AJ will beat him up & Ngannou will retire unable to continue.
We need to take a moment to thank his Excellency, Uncle Turky, bro is just matchmaking boxing
Sorry but Ngannou shouldn't be getting these title bouts. Professional boxers who have build a career in this sport, who've progressed through the ranking deserve these fights before him.
Francis Ngannou wins this fight he is the undisputed baddest man on the planet. UFC heavyweight champ, boxing heavyweight champ if this were to happen - Ngannou will be the baddest man on the planet if he wins.
Rip aj 😂
he's still not willing to fight a man inside a top 9 and looking for a title shot on back of this if he does win? Dodgepot. Wait until Zhang is 43 or 44 sure.
AJ will win. Fury was terrible against Ngannou (off night or not). You can't just come into boxing and beat everyone, it doesn't work like that. If this was a risky fight, do you think Hearne would have made it? 😂 not a chance.
Francis is a beast , we will always love Francis
how did AJ become top 3 in the world without beating a fighter inside the top 9 since an out of shape  Ruiz 5 years ago? You Brits are all dilussional.
AJ has never fought someone like Ngannou and Ngannou has never fought someone like AJ. This will be worth watching
AJ sparks him within 6 and im not even a massive AJ fan.
Not quite true. Takam and Whyte are similar stature and style and 10 x times better than Ngannou.  AJ wins in 3
I don't see ngannou winning this, AJ is simply more skilled a fighter. Fury had a very bad night joshua i think controls this fight and possibly stops francis.
Francis is going to win this one True , I think you will see a better Francis
I think people will be surprised by how badly Francis does in this fight. Mark these words in the future.
AJ about to make easy work of Francis.
I think AJ has bitten off more than he chew, if I wasnt broke id be putting a sizeable bet on Francis Ngannou.
Damn. Had 0 views when i clicked on it
🎉been waiting for this
Ngannou wins inside 4 rounds
