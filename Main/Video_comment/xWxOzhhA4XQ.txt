thats not how it goes
seeing sneako in this is like seeing the twin towers before 9/11
jack pop 2.0 is crazy
Jesse Blackman
Wow this did not age well
sneako is a pedophile
Got bloody flashbanged by the Sneako appearance.
All over the map
I’m just now finding out Sneako was in this
1:39
I love how Skyler's only appearance in the entire video was to dump Walter
Bro who let Sneako in here
Then they all watched cuties together
wtf is sneaky doing there
when sneako wanst a dirty ho 😭😭
Is that sneeko on the right in the background
Back when Sneako was actually funny
never realized that was sneako, feelsbad
Tf is Sneako doing here?
sneako should’ve been walt
the guy that plays jessie here seems like a great actor i hope he sticks to summarising more shows like this
Absolute jumpscare realizing Sneak0 was in this
sad to see where sneako has come
This sneako was the best
I remembered this video and rewatched it. And I wondered who was the actor for Jessie since he seemed like a funny nice guy, I didn’t recognize him. I can't believe  it's the same guy who defended Cuties
2:32 Name’s Todd, rhymes with Grug
Sneako as jessie is wild
bro couldn’t have predicted what came of sneako
Damn what happened to Sneako
that is NOT who i think it is.
Is that Sneako how did I never realize
Never thought anyone could some up the entirety of breaking bad in 3 minutes, but here we are and its golden
the pizza lol😂
Is sneako, pinkman?
0/10 no mike
Sneako wtf hahahaha
sneako
Sneako
Nah the last couple of seconds is how it should have ended lol
badger as a racoon reference for badgergojer
This giving me jackpop vibes
Every episode of the first two seasons.
crazy that in less than half a decade one of these guys went nationally for eating cheeseballs in front of thousands in new york and the other is openly pedophile
How'd i never know that was sneako 😭
1:19 Music?
This was the moment sneako became heisenberg
Just think, you were with Sneako, who met Kanye😘😘😘 I love Kanye btw
Is jesse sneako?
Seeing sneako gave me whiplash
is that sneako
1:02 He said the thing!
I never realized sneako was in ts
Can’t believe sneako is in this that man fell hard
Wow this Sneako guy is pretty cool… I sure do hope he doesn’t turn into a crazy incel pedophile in four years
Damn... did not know sneako did content with you.
this is getting my updoot!
I remember when Sneako was pretty cool
2:44 Sneako caring about the safety of children was the funniest part of this video
Back when sneako was likable
This was the moment sneako became a cuck
i thought this would be like a stereotype of what most breaking bad episodes are like, but this is just every episode condensed into 3 minutes
Just now i noticed its Sneako as Jesse 😭🥀
before sneako became a cuck and an incel
i like how this implies when the methlamine train came through they were just in the area at the time and robbed it on a whim
“Its me gus”- mr fring
thank you for not wasting that pizza
Is that sneako?
Jesse: "Bitch, so i basically decided to fuck our entire operation up, multiple times, for no reason other than my selfish subjective moral concerns, cartel is after us, DEA is after us, that irrelevant german nazi gang is after us, bitch"  Walter: "Jesse, you are like a son to me, im sorry that literally only thing im trying to do is better both of our lives by using some creative chemistry, and for some reason its MY fault that YOU are constantly fucking it up for both of us. You are like a son to me, Jesse. There is nothing i love doing more with my life than tidying up after your fuck-ups as a stage 4 cancer patient. I should be at the fucking hospital getting a chemotherapy instead of collecting you from decrepit drug dens for the fourth time now, but you are like a son to me Jesse."
Yo is that sneako 😂💀
Put this video on 0.40x speed and it'll be the entire series length
is that fucking sneako ???
4 years and i just realized sneako is in this video
u look rly sexy in a cop costume
its funny how it just goes from tod getting shot by jesse, to the ending
you didn’t ruin it you awfully destroyed it so I like it and forgot the actual show
The sneako before and after didn’t age well
Why did I never noticed, that that`s Sneako, I`m blind
1:35 not the 2016 Berserk opening lmao
he looks like breaking bad jr
Who's that other guy??? I hope he doesn't go on to say really bad things
Was that sneako as Jessie?
2:24 this scene has no fucking right to be this funny 😂
I like how the entire 2 seasons of Gus were compressed into a couple seconds, while the pizza delivery scene  lasted like 3x as long
Damn sneako grew up lmao
I sat the meth on fire had me dying
Sneako before he became a clown
before sneako became an incel chud
is that
holy shit no fucking way that’s sneako 😭
Hm I wonder what happened to that Sneako guy
Whatever happened to sneako, he looked sane here
Dude what even happened to sneako
Jesse should thank god that Charles White isn’t in the show.
walter wait
lol this show sucked, blame the awful cult of reddit for overrating the crap out of this mediocre show
What happened. Sneako seems funny.
Sneako
Sneako being in this aged like milk
damn its crazy sneako devolved from this to an andrew tate meat rider
The beginnings of cucko
Good Spoiler for anyone that wants to kill of the storyline of the series go ahead
why the fuck does sneako play jesse
sneako 😭
wtf is sneako doing here
Long story short, don’t be a teacher who gets less money.
Wtf is that SNEAKO
holy shit thats sneako
Sneako before the ….💀💀
1:52 just gonna leave this timestamp without context
Disliked for Sneakos cuck ass
is that f****ng SNEAKO????
SNEAKO????
So sad that Sneako became a clout chaser
This is literally that Colombian remake called metastasis
damn this videos crazy after the callout in his hello video
SNEAKO??? this guy used to be normal??
Is that sneako?
0:28 this was before Sneako was an Andrew Tate Stan and a right wing grifter
Here after he called sneako a loser
0:29 SNEAKO???
It took me three years to realize that Sneako played Jesse and Gus. Oh how far he has fallen from grace.
can y'all believe that sneako, like had respect at one point, like people thought he was legitimately funny and well rounded, for like, a bit, then cuties came out...
Now that i think about it. Sneako does get beaten up like Jesse all the time.
Greatest thing Sneako has ever done
Jesse is sneako
It’s a shame what happened to Sneako he seems like a kinda nice guy here
damn, you even got muslim Epstein in this skit
Sneako pre-Andrew
This is more of a recap of the show
yoo sneako’s a lil cutie
Is that sneako???
I miss anthpo
Damn, back when sneako wasnt a retard
i sure hope jesse doesn't become a cuck
i like how Jesse keeps saying the B word
wtf is sneako doing here
The berserk OP killed me
"i don't have nothing anymore"💀
"I'm Dying" "No you're good, alright here's the pla-" "Ok"  Cinematic Masterpiece 😂
Yall im so out of touch with reality i went "wow that guy sure looks alot like sneako" 😭😭
Wait, is that Everett?
Wow coming back here after like 3 years the actor of jesse did really well, he totally wont become a punching bag for the internet
Why does every single house near Las Vegas look exactly the same
I had to physically think on what everyone means on, "The person who plays Jesse in this skit is horrible irl." And I had to think for like 2 minutes and came to the conclusion of, "Hey wait, that's Sneako, they're right."
I thought that dude was familiar, its Sneako!
All good. lol
How did they get sneako to do this 😂
"pizza time" "no"
Where’s the part where Jesse cucks himself?
Back when sneako was sane
Is that sneako?
That ain't bryan Cranston. Thats Brian crackston💀
1:35 Hank jumpscare
This is sad... he had so much potential, but he ruined his career and now no one will take him seriously. I am talking about sneako obviously
This is awesome.
he was the youtube shorts guy before youtube shorts
sneako???/
You look soo hot in the cop costume
wow who ever did jesse sure is a dumbass
Seems accurate
Wait... isn't that sneako?
I love sneako. I love old Sneako. We all love and deserve the old, quality youtuber Sneako was. I fucking miss his old styled videos when he would just talk about life and speak with us like that. I fucking miss it, or maybe I miss who I was, but fuck it I love and I want it all back.
young Sneako was a jumpscare
Sneako looking funny af 😂
Sneako
Not a single utterance of fly. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined(thought of this comment before I saw it was a copy of top comment)
Seeing Sneako here hurts.
You look sexy in a cop costume fr ong
When sneako still had a personality of his own
I can’t believe sneako was in this. It’s baffling to see him in a “normal state” back then. He broke bad just like Walter
I really thought that Jessie was Sneko lol
Clicked on this video cus I was like is that fuckin sneako and it sure as shit was
what the fuck i did not expect to see sneako here
This video marinated in my mind very well
i miss the old sneako
I loved sneakos performance in this. Too bad.
sneakers??
Better ending
Forgot when sneako was normal
Wait is that Sneako 💀
Bro thought he could sneak in sneako and we wouldn’t notice
why the fuck is sneako here
Why tf Sneako here bruh
Back when Sneako wasn’t a bad person
bet sneako was in that clip
I didn’t expect Sneako to be in here
"Dont shoot kids, bitch." -Jesse, Pacifist
Why is sneako in everything 💀
1:52 this clip aged well

ha ha that shit was not funny. never do that again.
sneako in this was a genuine jumpscare
It surreal to Sneako in this now
what is sneako doing there 💀
Sneako played a race swapped character lol
I just realized that it’s FUCKInG SNEEKO
Anthony's an absolute hottie in that cop outfit. Slayyy 💅
sneako when he was bearable
This is giving me jack pop vibes
Senko 😂
Sad this didnt ever get a “every episode of better call saul” sequel
Holy FUCK that is Sneako😭
I’m sorry is that sneako as Pinkman
Fuck yeah the good ending
ah what a nice actor is the guys -playing gus, hopefully let us assume he knows what a mag is
Ruining it?? MADE IT BETTERRRR
sneako
Remeber the tollerable sneko
I didn’t even realize that this is sneako…. I was always wondering who played jesse in this 🥲
The minecraft XP was so dirty hahahaha
Tf is sneako doing here?
sneako before he was a cuck
“What do you methyla-mean”
For over a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the Dark Times. Before the Tate
Before the dark times
Jesse created beef with jesus christ for being a cuck
Make more sense if sneako was walter since he broke bad irl
jesse: ayo mr white. i have some clips  walter white: there mags not clips you abosolute dummy the same way this is also a mag there all mags stop saying clips you look stupid here.
I love how Walter’s main thing to say is “ok” 😂😂
why is sneeko mr pinkman
Jesse! These are not clips, these are mags, Jesse!
"watch my needles" -Jesse after Janes death
is that sneako?
Jesse before he watched Jane get fucked by another dude
skinny pete dancing absolutely killed me
Sneako before the lobotomy 😊
Como realmente debió terminar Breaking Bad:
Bro goes from making skits with a anthpo to eating dinner with Andrew Tate lol
Times where sneako was actually funny.
I just realized Jesse was sneako 😭
I just realized bro actually had Sneako in this. Quite possibly the only content Sneako has been a part of that is good.
Peak sneako
bro is that sneako
i thought jesse looked familiar
i cant belive this guy is a k pop idol
Cant believe they got the real badger for this video!
I love how sneako mirrors Jessy
ok but like this was before the clip situation so go in with an open heart for ya boy anthpo
"Cook meth for me, nothing will go wrong" famous last words
in this version jesse watches jane in the corner
awesome xD
Sneaky was actually a normal person in this video
why is sneako here?
"Don't shoot kids bitch." -Sneako 2020
"cook meth for me ... nothing will go wrong"
Jesse looks a lot like sneako!
no mike?
How the fuck did Sneako go from this to a neo-Nazi
So that's sneakos backstory. He changed his identity to flee from the cartel.
I did not expect to see Sneako here
Jane's actor is the greatest. He captured her personality to the full extent.
Cuckneako
WAIT IS THAT SNEAKO???
How did I JUST realize that sneako was in this?
sneako what
You forgot about the intros
I love how this video mixes the plot so bad that actually it's not a spoiler for people that want to watch Breaking Bad. Great job guys
i love how almost all of season 5 is completely skipped
man sneako killed me when he played gus
I’m not caught up with breaking bad so I’m not sure… is that fucking sneako???
Jesse, I am the one who cucks
bro skipped s4
When sneako used to be actually good
"Don't shoot kids b*tch" - Sneako  This aged very well.
damn so accurate
Is that the king of cuck???
I’ve been watching breaking bad, and coming back to this at the end of every season to compare it, stoping before I get any spoilers. It has made the experience even better than it already was, and I love it.
Does anyone know what the song is a 1:35?
Wow. I have never seen Breaking Bad before. Is this really what this whole show is about?
Anime name?
Sneako 2.0
What do u methalamine 😂😂
i remember when sneako was actually funny
Wait is jesse actually fucking sneako
"I'm sorry for ruining this show"  Least you didn't have Walter die
Is that sneako lmao
Season 5 of anthpo's breaking bad was absolute gold
So the guy who cuck sneako is Mr white..
Dude your friend with sneako 💀☠💀☠💀
what?
sneako during the pre-cuck era
Heyyy sneako! Hahaha that was funny af
if sneako played walter then he would've watched skyler fuck ted
2:37 dahmer
The Tuco part is hilarious
Sneako?
Common Sneako W
Sneako 😂
sneako was jesse?
Never forget Anthpo
1:52 well he's not wrong there
i thought Jesse actor was familiar but then i sorted the comments to newest
DAMN!!! him in a cop costume tho
Basically breaking bad 💀
Yo is that Sneako? Wtf
Damn I wish that’s how it ended
No need to apologize,  the show was already ruined
“i set the meth on fire” “ok”
This is basically Breaking Bad in 3 minutes
Gus was perfect
literally just watched the snl skit
Wow the guy who plays Jessie looks cool, hopefully he doesn’t grow to be controversial
Gad dajm Sneeko worked with u as well thats so funny XD How much he leches of other good content creators
sneako and anthpo did a vid together???
Congrats on the going to collage.
I can't believe Jesse got cucked.
The actor for Jesse was really good, i hope he doesnt go off the rails and start beef with MoistCr1TiKaL
wow the actor for jessie is good at comedic timing, i hope he doesnt become a laughing stock to the entire internet including his man demographic
Bro when I first say this couple years ago I had no idea this was sneako
Why is sneako Jessie???
😭
Hi, I'm Jimmy McGill or colloquially, Saul Goodman. I really love your rendition of Breaking Bad, especially that Walt-Saul phone call scene. Anyway, *better call Saul!*
cant believe he didnt cover "Fly," the single greatest episode of television ever produced
Finding Sneako was in these videos way before knowing about his reputation plummeting is like rewatching that Gamergate episode of Law & Order everyone dunked on in 2015 & noticing Vine-era Logan Paul was the main bad guy they were after.
this is where sneako peaked
1:44  Welp that aged extremely well
wow the actor for jesse is so good, really hope he doesn’t turn out to be a cuck
I'm mentally ill bitch
I guess sneako ended up breaking bad
Why people be acting like sneako was this type of guy since day one! Nah sneako was one of the unique creative dude on whole youtube that's why even mr beast uses to consider him most favourite youtuber but everything is just sad
sneako would then become shit
I'll miss you anthony
This was the first video I ever watched on this channel, with the end near, I wanted some nostalgia 😊
the way the smile completely dropped from my face the second I saw sneako was jessie 😭
How'd the sneako crossover happen?
Bruh that's better than metastasis whole series
This is the kwickie notes version
This man forgot about combo 💀
I just realized one of the person in the video is sneako.
OMG is that sneako? 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
dont worry, you only made the show better
yes
i just realized, is that fuckong sneako?
the one who plays jesse is funny I think he'll be successful in no time the future is bright for him
💀
i was watching this right and then i was "is that sneako" is was indeed sneako
you forgot the fly one.
Why does the dude playing Jesse look like sneako
I guess jesse wasn't wrong when he said he was mentally ill
Im mentally ill bitch
2:00 Gus is too accurate
damn the jesse actor is cool. i hope he didnt turn into not a clown... but an entire circus
what's sneako doing here?
Oh my god, I really do miss the old sneako.
God it feels so weird seeing Sneako here
Sneako?
that pizza throw was so cool
Wtf is sneko in this video??
Jesse looks like sneako

Still better than Metastasis
Every new person clicking on this came for Sneako lol
When sneako was cool
Wth is sneako doing here
Jesse we need to cuck
it was hella perfect... bitch!
Thank you for the rewind even though I'm finishing season 5 tomorrow😂😂
Wheres the part where jesse watches walter fuck his girlfriend?
Bruh sneako moment
Sneako could’ve been way cooler if he just stayed like this
Based sneako
the casting did not age well
Never getting bored of this classic I'm gonna tell my kids that this is the true Breaking Bad
WHOLESOME
Sneako should've played walter since his wife got railed by another man
Real
Is Sneako acting as Jesse and Gus
Todd think he Walter White 💀

Jesse, we need to defend the film Cuties
The motherfucker Sneako is here?
1:33 best part by far
Yk the actor for Jesse seems familiar from a certain “clip” or a mag idfk
Jesse looks like Sneako.
Whats this song called? 0:53
“Watch my clip”  Moments before disaster…
Jesse is a cuck?????
Jesse... we need to be cucks
Sneako broke bad and went crazy, then was mutilated by a skinwalker who took john wicks body
i miss the old sneko
is that sneako
Been ignoring this vid for a while. Then I noticed Jesse…
Waltuh,let’s cook some clips
is that Sneako
Holy damn. This was sneako before he went crazy.
The fact that they didn’t waste the pizza is my favourite part
When sneako was respectable
So in this version does Jesse get cucked by jane?
SNEAKO
I don’t remember the part where’s jesse’s girlfriend has sex with another guy
0:57 THAT SPECIFIC BEEPING SOUND SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF ME
you r very sexy in a cop costume indeed
Jesse if he was casted by netflix in 2023.
Yo mr white i just watched jane get fucked
Wait I just realized that’s sneako
YO MR WHITE I MET THIS GUY CALLED ANDREW TATE. WE NEED TO ESCAPE THE MATRIX MR WHITE.
Man imagine how different Sneako would be if he didn't ditch Anthony for Andrew Tate
sneaker really fell off
damn sneako downgraded fr
deadass is that sneako?
Sneako??
Jessie exept cuck eddition
bro sneakos here
Sneako is still epic
Jesse Cuckman
2:05 the pipe bomb was activated through sound, it was supposed to go off with hectors bell but instead from Gus' yell.
Sneako before
0:12 FBI ATTACK😂🤣😪🤣😂🤣😎😂😎🤣🥶😎🥶🥶🤓🥶🤓🥶🤓🥶🤓🥶🤯😭😱
Doesn’t Jesse look like sneako
Sneako as casting was perfect he's had men shoot into his girlfriends aswell
Damn Sneako playing Jesse? It's one tragic figure playing another tragic figure
Is that sneako ?
I really love Jesse’s actor, I hope he doesn’t end up becoming a fool.
I really love Jesse’s actor, I hope he doesn’t end up becoming a fool.
just remembered sneako is in this vid
I love how he (Walt) looks like CGI on the thumbnail.
"Jesse, we need to cuck"
in this version sneako is the good guy and not misogynist before this andrew mate comes in this youtube.
Hmmm I really liked the actor for Jesse hopefully he stays a good person
Sneako
Ah the good times, when Sneako was still a good guy. What has happened over the years?
What do you Methyla-MEAN has absolutely destroyed me 😂
“I’m mentally Ill……bitch  “
that cop costume was so :emoji:
This so weird watching it in retrospect, knowing how sneako ends up
why sneako of all people
Woah gus is a cuck
Is that sneako?
the other guy looks like sneako
That Gus impression is pretty spot on, I wonder what the actor is up to these days
Watch these crystals watch these crystals
why does that guy kinda look like sneako
Is that sneako the cuck?
I miss the old Sneako 😔
Bruh is that sneaky 💀
"There mags Jesse"
I miss the old Sneako
Old Sneako and new Sneako are both massive Ws
damn sneako, 'dont shoot kids' that aged well
before the madness of sneako
Never knew jesse was a cuck
Damn it
this was when Sneako was a good person
bro thinks he's jesse pinkman 💀
the only good content Sneako is involved with:
Before sneako became a cuck
What if someone watches this video and thinks that the ending of breaking bad is really Jesse just shooting Tod so they don watch the show
Was wondering why jesses face looks so familiar then realized its fucking sneako
Damn, so Sneako was awesome long time ago, who woud've thought.
Forgot sneako was in this, how times have changed.
Before sneako became an absolute weirdo
When sneako was funny
I didn’t know Jesse was a cuck
Aged like fine cheese
Sneako pulled a Kayne West.... damn
You lost the opportunity to invite Charlie so he plays Jack and explains to Jesse the difference between clips and mags
accidentally had this on auto play and it spoiled the entire show im pissed but im not mad at you lol
Even when sneako kills Todd he probably reload his CLIP
When sneko was cool
I remember when sneako was funny and wasn’t a stupid weak minded little cuck
this sneako persona is good wtf did just happen
Sneako reference
rare sneako w
the good era of sneko
damn the actor for jesse did a really good job , lets hope he does not end up being a major clown
Sneako before he met Tate, I miss this sneako
Ayo is that sneako
I miss the old Sneako before his downfall
I was in the middle of typing "that guy looks like Sneako" when I read the other comments... wow
1:40 sneako after he pulls up to Charlie
Old sneako was good but now he is a just IRevealAgility and Angeli Gate mixed up
This fuckin' AAGGGEEEDD.
sneako shoulda been Walter since he's used to getting fucked 😔
True Meth ending
Sneako does kinda make things both more realistic and kinda ruins it at the same time.
Alice porcva madonna
I fuckng cackled when i saw Badger
Love all urs vids my whole childhood fr
Holy shit just now realizing it’s Sneako must’ve been back when he was still somewhat respectable
2:48 bro think he Walter White💀
it's weird seeing sneako before he turned into a... you know
bruh...sneako went full villain mode after this era.
Before sneako went insane
Why is Hector a cat
wait is that sneako?
what is sneako doing bro
Is that sneako
Is that sneko
what a funny mixed race dude. i sure hope he doesn’t go on to radicalize young boys and men with anti-semitic, fascist, misogynistic and violence inciting incel ideology….
“Here’s a bag of money, don’t do drugs” lmao
Accurate thou
Man like sneako dafuq
What is the music at 2:57 ? Someone please
2 yeas ago I watched this, and I had no idea what was going on. I am coming to this video immediately after I finished breaking bad, and let me just say you did this show a service. And also Toby looks exactly like Todd lmao.
0:13 slipknot duality?
SNEAKO's doing side quests
That actor of Jesse is so funny I hope he dosent get badly influenced by a misogynistic millionaire… but that would never happen.
Mitochondria = powerhouse? That’s biology, not chemistry
i didn't see a spoiler alert
Bhahahahahahahaha j'adore
WHAT DOES HE METH-LA-MEAN????
How sexy does that man look in a police officer uniform
Sneako deserves an Oscar
made it to the end of the video, not making that comment anthpo, i am not.
2:49   Bro think he walter white 😭😭😭
Sheesh on a stack frfr on god you lookin mighty fine in that oppression 9000 inator outfitorator goddang.
How did u get the real walter white to film this video?
sneako?
Sneako before he signed a contract to suck Andrew Tate's dick for eternity. Pretty cool, huh.
you forgot the plane crash and the poison beans
"Jesse stop following Andrew Tate" "Yo Mr white Andrew Tate is actually a very smart person who I agree with"
the fact that sneako plays jesse
i love sneako in this!
Saul Goodman is like the Lester of breaking bad
2:02
Todd at the end:  Me: heading straight to the comments to say “Bro thinks he’s Walter white 💀”
dont shoot kid bitch 😂
The fact you did the entire show without Mike is a crime
is that sneako
Sneako  actually being decently funny for once???
not good bitch
sneako looks exacly like gus
“No Waltuh, put your camera away waltuh, I’m not gonna be in your sketch comedy video Waltuh”
This is so accurate 🤣
LMAO WHY IS WALTER SO SMALL
Accurate
that “what do you methyla-mean?” joke killed me
Sneako?
wtf thats the Megaglowen style
sneako indeed broke bad
Sneako? Lmao
What a wholesome story about a highschool chemistry teacher and his former student bonding over science (bitch) with really good lessons to take away like "don't do drugs" and "you shouldn't harm children" now if only there were a heartwarming sequel about brothers who are passionate about defending law and doing what's right by the justice system. I think that would make for a really compelling and family friendly show!
I thought that was sneako
Yes
Dont shoot kids bitch
@sneako
Now we need every better call Saul episode
2:32
Damn didnt know jesse was a sexist
You look really sexy in a cop uniform
0:02 i thought walter was a chemistry teacher What is on the board is about cells
What is sneako doing here 😭☠
What do you Methlameam always gets me
The way the "OK"s get funnier because of where he says them👸🏽🆚👀🆚😭
Yo mistah white

Sneako
bro is that sneako?
The ending was perfection.
Not a single mention of the fly, day ruined
ii love how mike is just not
sneako😂😂😂
Berserk😊
I like how the ending is just Todd dead instead of Walt.
bro's looking fine af in a cop costume
Badger's performance as Badger was awe inspiring.
Sneako should’ve played Tuco, woulda been perfect
Sneako is a W actor in this.
Is that sneako?
epik
before sneako was a huge shithead ig
"yo mista white take the red pill, it exposes the tru-" "Jesse shut the fuck up about the god damn red pill"
Nahhhhh is that sneako bruh
Why is sneako or something in this💀
Todd was the true Heisenberg all along
Ngl sneako seems like a Jesse pinkman
No joke i think this video is the reason i watched the whole saga
I’ve seen this so many times but never realized sneako was here LMFAOOO
Dang this is sad seeing Sneako before he was consumed by the Tate bs. I mean he literally just became a copycat and a bad one at that. Tate is wrong as well but he did have some good points just most were wrong and he's a human trafficker so fuck him.
I just finished watching this video and now im wondering 2 things. number 1. what the hell is this video number 2. what is breaking bad number 3.
0/10 sneako didn't play every single mexican and asian character. L taco tate.
SNEAKOOOOOO
U DIDINT RUIN THE SHOW U MADE IT BETTER LMAOO
Holy shit is that sneako as Jesse
I like how they put paper under the pizza so that they could eat it later. 2:28
Breaking Bad lore be like

I wait a year to see this video , I have to say this wasn't what I was expecting😂
Is that sneako?
The waffle House has found its new host.

The Waffle House Has Found Its New Host

This is the Breaking Bad video ever.
Is the sneako?
when Jesse rats himself and Walt out to the DEA and the cartel begins chasing them, we hear voices in Spanish and the words DEA open up at the same time. This implies the Cartel and DEA teamed up to arrest/kill Walt and Jesse.  Edit: probably both if we’re honest with each other.
Snoeko sneakt in this
Is that sneako
Sneako before he became woke
Why tf is walmart andrew tate jesse
LMAO
This edit style reminds me of Jack pop, what is it called? I wanna see more

I've waited two years to watch this video since I'd never seen Breaking Bad and wanted to watch it. I'm so happy I did that, and even happier this video exists.
Sneako
0:50
is that sneako?!?
SNEAKO as jesse is wild
Didn't know Sneako was an actor.
Careful you could get sued for copyright  Cause you literally just copied the show
ngl sneako is gorgeous
I learnt a lot of chemistry from Walt's lecture scored 35 marks in chemistry by watching his lectures
Hold up is that sneako
Sneako-
Oh hey its the Andrew Tade guy?
2:48 bro thinks he's walter white 💀
Jesse I have stage 5 cancer help me cook and sell meth
Sneako
Where is the breakfast guy?
This is how breaking bad should have ended
Is that... Sneako?
Sneako before he went insane
oof sneako isnt a good pick for this nowadays well he did basically break bad
That’s sneako what
Is that sneako?
Sneako the cuck fell off so hard
How breaking bad was supposed to end:
Wtf? I watched this vid a whiiile back and I had no idea he was sneako
💀
I wish sneako was still a good youtuber

avengers level cgi and editng
Whats the song in the background when Jesse shows up at 1:12 and at 1:33?
How did Sneako look like a little kid 2 years ago lmao
LOL SNEAKO
“Yo mr tate, that’s like mysonnistic to women or something yo”  “SNEAKO we need to stream!”
2:48 bro think he Walter White 💀
What do you methla-mean?
sneako before all the cringe
Wtf sneako with antpho
i never realized that was sneako when he was a little less crazy
Idk but this was so fun
Bro why is SNEAKO in here
Sneako is the best part
is that sneako?
Sneako a bitch
it's good to see sneako in something again. i havent seen him in a while.
Smash
Sneako?!?!
Gus's "nothing will go wrong" was absolutely perfect on the accent.
The cop costume is nice but does nothing for your ass. Next time blue or black tights.
Forgot Jessie was so cute
Sneako?
Walter: say my name. Jesse: b*tch. Walter: you're goddamn right.
Bro why is SHNEAKO here💀
Is that sneako?
not sneako
Can't believe someone uploaded the entirety of the breaking bad series and it hasn't gotten taken down.
I've never seen Breaking Bad... and now I'll never have to, thank you! 🙃
This is the way it should have ended.
You got Sneako to play Jesse?
Skinny really pulled out the emote wheel.
I watched the season like 3 times… why is this accurate…. Except for Jesse killing Todd
Hey guys I guess that’s it🤯
Badger and Skinny Pete showing up got me laughing 😂
sneako
Beautifyl
that looks like sneaky
Don’t forget flynn asking what’s for breakfast every episode
2:13 my favorite part in this vid             Hey guys I guess that’s it                  Pizza time           9/11           No twin towers?
“oh man”
what do you methla-mean?
What do you methlamean 😂
I would have liked this version wayyy more
Imagine having a bitch ass cuck like sneako in this video sad as fuck
Bruh sneako is a misogynistic piece of shit
do better call saul
🤮
2:49 bro thinks he’s  Walter White💀
Clicked because I couldn't believe sneako would be in this video
SKINNY PETE 😭
Seeing sneako know is different.
sneako from mrbeast!
Damn sneako went from this to hanging with white supremacists
Sneako such a baby in this 🥹
This is not breaking bad this is broke worse.
this sneako guy seems rly talented I hope he doesn't end up getting canceled
I laughed more to this than I should have haha
Where’s the twins
"what do you methlaMEAN, bitch?"
it wasnt blue when tuco tried it first
I like it
The pizza scene I wanted but was not expecting 😂
Oh look, woman beater Andrew Tate wannabe.
Sneako??? man wtf???
I just realized that is Sneako LMAO
The shear amount of work and non work that went into this makes me happy
hahahahaha Absolute Gold!! Nailed it.
Nah, you’re good 🤣🤣
The Sneako collab is wild
Is that sneako?
This is much too intelligent for Breaking Bad, which is a prestige TV show seemingly written by Beavis and Butthead.
If only Jesse just shot Todd. So much could have been fixed.
SNEAKO???
I always hated that badger wasnt a real badger. Thank you for fixing this
Better call Saul
SNEAKO
Sneako???
Is that f*ckin sneeko
eww sneako…
Where is walter jr eating “bneakfast”😂 thats 50% of the show and 100% of his role in it
This brought tears to my eyes. Jalt pinkenburg was truly one of the most drug dealers of all time.
Remember when sneako was actually entertaining and didn't support a neo nazi
i have a character on Project zomboid called walter white and he looks like him
You forgot to portray what a huge pain in the ass his wife is
The middle of the series was kinda boring imo.
"Here's a bunch of money, don't do drugs"  That "Aight, bet." was the most "bet" I ever heard
seeing sneako here is like seeing your parents killer at a childs birthday party
is skiny "p" for peni-
THE PIZZA THROW 😂
2:37 the way he looked to the camera 💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oh baby, you're so cute when you sleep... lmao
The only time sneako has been funny and it barely had anything to do with him
Tf is sneako doin here
Subbed
VEry sexy
When Sneako was tolerable
I’m literally not gonna last much long- Nah you’re good 💀
waht is sneako doing here xd
SNEAKO???
Never realized Jesse is Gus.
Omfg Gus voice is spot on
This is a masterpiece
That pizza toss, fuckn nailed it 1st try
this is a masterpiece
Ha they got sneako
i just finished breaking bad I'm crying
The good ending
Ew somebody put a sneako in my breaking bad contenr
Forgot about combo😞😭🥲
The Minecraft doors stoooooop
Is that snake?
That Gus impression was spot on for the 2 seconds he showed up
Lol. Loved this
Walter weight
Is that sneako?
Lmaoo the xp orbs from the kid todd shot
Man this is dogshit
"What do you methla-mean.... b*tch?" = best line in the entire show.
Skinny Pete dancing almost killed me
This is the best thing that is everything
“Bitch” was said way less than it needed to be
why tf is sneako here
Badger be like: 🦡
what is sneako doin in his free time bruh
bro look like sneako
oml sneako
Yo this shit cool and all but where's combo
The dude playing Jesse looks so familiar but who tf
this is the best thing i have laid my eyes on
Bruh from where the hell Sneako pop 😂
very good video.
Is that sneako?? 😹
So is that sneako?
good ending
I picture the Salamanca twins watching this and then slowly looking at each other.
danny gonzalez?
Sneako? Tf?
This, This is not Good. You would have been better off going with Breaking Bad in Denmark. Start EP1 DR. "Mr. White, you have Lung Cancer"  WW: " OMG what am I going to do, how will I pay for this? I guess the only option is to sell meth" DR: "Mr. White, you don't understand, this isn't America. All your medical Bills are covered" Sound Track: "Curb Your Enthusiasm" Theme Song as it zooms into Walt's face. End EP1
weirdly accurate
The good ending
Damn sneako changed
I like how you can tell they kept the pizza on the paper because they still intended on eating it after filming it
The fucking G-mod death 😂
A very accurate portrayl of the show, i must say.
bro what the fuck happenend to sneako
This is amazing 🤣👌
NO WAY
BRO IS THAT SNEAKO
yes
Sneako fr sold out
is that...
Seeing Sneako as Jesse made my day
that was the first video. finally i discovered my fav cornhub channel.
"I'm mentally ill B*tch" is my new catch pharase
i have watched this 679 times and its still funny
Bb in a nutshell
Unban sneako🙃
Aaah don t we all wish jesse killed todd at this moment
W sneako
bro i had no clue sneako was in this
Not bad ...

When Walter White from Breaking Bad said "It's Breaking Bad Time" I felt that because Breaking Bad is a really serious show since it is Breaking Bad and the awesome collaboration with Better Call Saul
This is truly the moment Asac McGill became hank Goodman
sneako?
Sneaking??
Garbage
Sneako's "BITCH" is on point
IS THAT SNEAKO?
The fact that sneako is in this is pure gold
Sneakoooo

Good ending
"What do you methylamine?"   I'm dead

Gus Fring's voice is so accurate
Sneako ruined this video
epic yo
*(and then everything went wrong)*
cook meth for me, nothing will go wrong. (spolier: something went wrong)
shneako sneaking
Yo this was a master piece, bitch!

Felt like Walt Jr. was forced in this show
sneako
sneako fell from this to sucking a bald man's dick

goated song at 1:34 (inferno form 9mm parabellum bullet if anyone asked)
“what do you methlamean?”
Fkn sneako
Y is sneako in this bro 😭😭😭😂😂
Breaking Not Good
Hello my name is Waltuh the lll and this is completely inaccurate as waltuh the ll was not idolatry in this video at the end you were worried if you ruined the show ha! You just made it 30000x better you did it statistically,mentally and physically and come on you didn’t catch how much of a bitch skyler was
Realising that sneako is a part of the acting
Judging from Sneako's status then vs his status now, I guess you could say Sneako...broke bad.
the way they open the doors 🤣😭
Just finished this show. That video slaps so differently now.
I really wish they used a real Badger that would have been way more entertaining.
Sneako makes this better considering what he does now 😂
The guy who played Jesse and Gus was really energetic and funny, hope he doesn’t turn into a delusional streamer who cries over other dudes wearing makeup
Skinny Pete 😂
Lmao sneako as gus hits different
the fact that sneako did smth like this before all his recent stuff just proves it's all an act
Thank you. It's just now that I see the deeper layers in this show. Thanks again. And again. Thanks.
is that sneako💀
Maaaaan 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Song at 1:34? I remember hearing it before and forgot
Jesse didn't say bitch enough.
“It’s me gus, cook meth for me nothing will go wrong”  Walt: ok
Walter
sneakooooooooooooo
Thanks for saving me 50 hours and a Netflix sub.
Why is sneako here tf?
Back when Sneako didn't make his money purely from hating women.
rare sneako W
Idk why but sneako being in this makes it so much better
Before we truly knew sneako😢
sneako😂
yo its sneako
Thank you for helping me remind the end of the Show 👍
how the show should have ended
“The Good Ending”
Wtf I just came back to this video and realized this was Sneako in this.  When did he go so downhill???
The ragdoll at the end was perfect
SNEAKO
Ok
Still better than metastasis
This is a work of art
Bro it's sneako
who's here after Sneako blew up?
How dare they not include Walt crying after Hank's death.
Bro is that aneako

You can’t just make Jesse black
What do you methlamine?  Best pun ever
Bro that’s sneako!?
Wtf happened to SNEAKO in like one year
So many turns in this video. The fact that sneako was in it, and the berserk intro song at 1:35, this whole video is awesome haha
Oh sneako. I miss this. How you have been redpilled and have gone off the deep end. Rip
yo what the fuck is that SNEAKO??
Sneako dude really 😐
Another sneako dub
"what do you methla MEAN, b*tch?" -jesus
Wow it's Sneako before he became a bitch. How ironic.
Sneako has changed so much
Not a single scene where  Walt Junior is eating breakfast. My disappoint is immeasurable and my day is ruined
THEY CALLED SAUL NO WAY
sneako lol
Ngl, bro do be lookin crispy af in dat cop uniform 😳🥵🥵
meh... not a single Hank reference on how his brother in law is the person he was looking for the whole show...
This is so true.

SNEAKO IS IN THIS? I'm so surprised 😆
Remind me of early Youtube
NOOOOOOOOOO U SPOIL IT WGHY...
very
All i can say is, 100% accurate.
Wow Sneako really went down hill. You could say he broke bad.
I can confirm every episode begins with Walt being diagnosed with cancer and ends with him killing Todd
Bro it’s crazy to see where sneako is after seeing this
"dont shoot kids bitch!" pop XD i hate the character tod so much this made me laugh
Man you look so sexy in a cop costume
saw Sneako. dislike.
“what do you methla-mean bitch”
what sneako doin here
Bruh the video wouldn’t load for me and it was just Walt standing looking at the screen, just like the series
Sneako???😂😂😂
Didn’t expect to see sneako 😂
This is why sneako looks familiar
I didn’t want to believe he was in this video I thought my eyes are playing tricks
"what do you methyla-mean.... bitch?"
ITS SNEAKO
Sneako!?
Sneako?
What do you methaly-mean? ...Bitch?"
"I'm mentally ill, bitch!!"
No skyler saying “the devil is in the details” like 100 times not accurate
How the hell you got Sneako in this bruh 💀💀💀
"What do you metla-mean" that was gold
WHAT IS SNEAKO DOING HERE
No mike? L
Why did I waste 60 hours of this show when I could have watched this brilliant 3 min recap instead
vince gilligan would be proud
I know, I am EXTREMELY late to the party, but I just watched through Breaking Bad for the first time. Now I am scouring Youtube for all the parodies I can find.
Sneako??!??!?!

Ah hell naw, why is sneako in this
Haven’t noticed til now that that’s sneeko

Bruh sneako out of nowhere 🤣
Do better call saul
yo is that sneako
Sneako before tate 🤨
Polyphia inferno
Why’s Sneako here I feel like that’s the type of guy Anthpo would make fun of
Hello everyone, my name is Gustavo Fring. But you can call me *sus*.
How tf is sneako in here
Sneako as jesse bruh
"Why wasn't I a part of this video Waltuh? I'm a relatively important character in this show waltuh, more important than badger waltuh"

“It’s me Gus, cook meth for me, nothing will go wrong”

Back when sneako was somewhat normal

Sneako ????????? 🤣
Yo is that sneeko

Walter looks so funny
Wtf is sneako doing
This pretty much is the whole show
LMFAO
"what do you methla-mean..? bitch" LMFAOOOODHSJDSGSJDBD
I dont have plans of ever watching breaking bad as it would take a lot of time so thanks for the run down so I can comprehend breaking bad fans
I no longer like this show
From avatar to breaking bad🥹 oh how far you’ve come anthpo
im currently on 1:40 of breaking bad
never realized its was SHNEAKO
Never realized Sneako was in the vid playing as Jesse.
W story  W characters  W dialogues W video
Is Sneako grinding in this video?
when sneako used to be good
Sneako before he fell off
So this is what sneako was like before he fell down, hit his head and become mentally deranged and unhinged
Still better than metastasis
Is that sneako
This is basically every season wrapped up in under 4 minutes. I’m just annoyed there’s no scene with Walter jr earring breakfast and complaining about shit
99.1% amazing
Sneako is that you
Yo is that sneako
Just realized that’s sneako

Yo Mr. White, ever heard of andrew tate yo
only my real heroine addicts noticed he tied the tourniquet on the forearm and hella wrong
This is how i got spoiled on gus's death
I like how every problem relating to Walt and Jesse working for Gus was summed up in Jesse saying “bitch, this sucks!”
pleasure doing business

why is no one talking about the fact that sneako is in this
Sneako?
Sneako
Honestly…         This is way more better than Metastasis (The ripoff of Breaking Bad)
Sneako Bad
They should have added old Salamanca spamming his bell in the middle of the video
breaking bad explained in 3 minutes:
sneako
Before Sneako became a complete loser
Is that sneako?
Bru is that sneako

I still like you even though you associate yourself with sneako
How much accuracy. I totally forgot Hector was a Cat
What do you meathla-mean…. Bitches
Badger? We don’t need no stinkin’ Badger. One wonders if the creators of this - ??? - did so after sampling the product.
Snekooo
99.1% ACCURATE!
sneako was never the same after the cuties video
Sneako!!!
Pretty good. Just needed the part where his wife was furious until she knew how much money he was making.
shneko as Jesse is the best thing
Before sneako fell off
Sneako?
Is that sneako
Wait Sneako?
That sneako
Damn just realised anthpo is friends with sneako
Wtf is SNEAKO doin here?
bro why is sneako here
this is the best summary i have ever seen
Dayym sneako popping off
fax mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
2:47 not the gmod death sound 💀😭😭
holly shit thats sneako
SNEAKO!!!
Sneako?
nah he got sneko on this mf
This spoils everything about breaking bad while also spoiling nothing about breaking bad
I love how Todd is the one with the final death scene instead of Walter.
"Nothing will go wrong" Famous last words..
Yo sneako
downvoting this bvc schneako is in it
epic effects^^
Wait wtf sneako
SNEAKO
this awkward type of comedy has got to die. i cant imagine anyone actually finding it funny
I knew that was SNEAKO
sneako fell off
Ruined it?? My man you just saved people weeks of watching this show
“Look at him go” LMAO
the moment wall became high birg
sex 2
Back when sneako was still good
why is sneako in everything
rip mike screen time
Disclaimer: no pizzas were hurt during the recording of the show
Sneako?
this is so accurate i can tell when  mr white becomes hiesenberg
is that sneako 💀
Is that sneako
He does look pretty sexy in a cop costume though.
1:34 did this man use the berserk 2016 intro
The cat scene was funny
Sneako?
great video, bitch
Wtf is Sneako doing
2:26 Funniest Photoshop Ever.
What do you methyl-mean     Bitch
not the pieology pizzaria
This video is TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT!!
sneako before he was sexist
Nice how a twirled in some el cameno lore to at the end.
Sneakoooo
ofc this guy has pronouns in bio
Anthpo in the cop costume be so hot
can we take a moment to appreciate that Jessie doesn't say "man" at all throughout this whole video
Bro your a negative out of 10 in that cop costume bro no cap all fax no printer
song at the end?
0:32 this is the most accurate representation of Jesse I’ve ever seen
How did I just realize Saul is using a croc as a phone
Yeah that's how it happened, Jesse didn't like cooking in the lab so they killed Gus.
sneako really broke bad
NO THEY FORGOT THE ENDING
They really just said Nah the Gus Fring arc ain’t important.
he broke bad
Jesse saying bitch in every line is golden
😡😡😡😡 spolers
BRO I WOULD TOTALLY SMASH RN
this is like jack pop but ti has more people
i love this
Is nobody going to point out that Saul’s phone is a croc? 🤣
Breaking bad if it was made by universal.
Yeah pretty much
okay but that’s literally how that scene with tuco went
I decided to watch the whole series before watching this video so I wouldn't deal with spoilers. Now I can watch it in peace
1:36  i cant get away
I love how skinny pete is literally kust minding his own business
Jesse's life going down the drain Walter you're so selfish
Got walts "yeah" spot on lmao
the longest word written out is methionylthreonylthreonylglutaminylarginyltyrosylg lutamylserylleucylphenylalanylalanylglutaminylleuc yllysylglutamylarginyllysylglutamylglycylalanylphe nylalanylvalylprolylphenylalanylvalylthreonylleucy lglycylaspartylprolylglycylisoleucylglutamylglutam inylserylleucyllysylisoleucylaspartylthreonylleucy lisoleucylglutamylalanylglycylalanylaspartylalanyl leucylglutamylleucylglycylisoleucylprolylphenylala nylserylaspartylprolylleucylalanylaspartylglycylpr
Jesse  We need to fight the ender dragon
i was worried this would spoil it but honestly i didn't understand a damn thing so i think i'm good
its crazy because this is exactly how the show goes
Bro the “cook meth for me…. Nothing will go wrong” had me weak
Gus got best tie ever
Great...thx
Please do one of Better Call Saul
As someone hasn’t seen breaking bad can confirm this is accurate
i feel like im watching a danny gonzalez skit
hide and seek by imogen hill playing when todd shoots drew followed by todd dying gmod style got me
best recap
I like how Mike isn't in this at all.
worryingly good gus impression
Just realized hes wearing a skirt at 0:17
I thought the writing in the original show was incredible but this takes the blue  Heyo Mr. White What's up? Bitch!  Oh I set the meth on fire Aw man And i ratter us out to the dea Aw man And the cartel is chasing us You know what Jesse... You're like a son to me.  Bitch!  AMAZING!!
this is perfect
ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE
Good job on gus man jajdja
Mending Good
So much respect to the director for letting the actors play one at a Time and then have them greenscreened together. Gotta have that personal space
that Gus impression was on point
Breaking bad in 3 minutes :
he actually sounds like gus fring
"okay." -Anthpo in every series
Yeah basically
ngl this is pretty fire
This is amazingly accurate
he actually did sound like gus
cringe
Gus’ death looked more realistic in this
Those Eric Andre Show claps were a nice detail lol
this ending is the good ending lol
I love the cook meth for me nothing will go wrong
do el camino
No joke, halfway through I thought "the only thing that could make this video better is if it ended with Todd showing up and committing unnecessary murder". LMAOOOO
If only Hank would’ve pissed instead of shit, he’d still be alive 😔
sorta
This ain’t breaking bad this is vandalising terrible
whats the song at 1:14 ????
i love the way jesse says bitch 😫😫😫😫
"This meth thing sure makes a lot of money. " "Yep."  *Breaking Bad*
This was terrible
Isn't Jesse white? This guy is a hybrid.
hmmm
Breaking bad with a budget of $5
Thank you. This saved me 6 long, boring seasons worth of time
This video literally covered everything 😂😂
My favorite anthpo video
Bro everythings perfect but you forgot jesse saying about walt that " We cant let him get away with this this time"
JESEEEEE !
9/10, they didnt say "Jesse" and "Yo Mr. White" every 10 seconds.
jesse: i ratted us out to the DEA walter: aw man *literally not even 5 seconds later* walter: jesse, you're like a son to me
I love how it doesn't even include a thing about the finale.
not enough breakfast scenes
Your pfp looks like Danny Gonzalez if his life had gone according to plan
This is a better rep of Breaking Bad than any hour long review about it
2:07 there should've been the taco bell noise to make it more funnier.
why do i undersand every single par of his
Still better directed than Metastasis
I make high quality breaking bad X minecraft meme edits on my channel, if you like this you will prob like them too. They are not garbage i swear lmao
The only thing that could make this better is walter white saying "It's Morbin Time"
this is the best youtube video for Breaking Bad ever
I set the meth on fire
0:50 how could you forget combo? 😭😭😭 I’m shaking and crying rn.
I love how Skyler's only line is "No."
me:
at 1:33 is that "im on a horse motherfucker look at me"
2:44 last time a kid on a bike went unshot he killed combo
😂
Jesse kills Todd and never becomes a nazi slave, this is the good ending
i like how todd became the main character in the last five seconds
I can't believe you managed to throw the pizza on the roof on your first try.
Destruction of the unpleasant
Just when I thought I have seen the least funny thing this community has to offer I came across this meme. Hitler is in hell rn being forced to watch Breaking Bad memes.
Was enjoying the video til Sneako came  up. Lame ahh dude
Why he lookin like ecco2k
br     ba
I have 1% on my phone and i think i can watch 3 more mi-
What do you methylaMINE….. bitch
2:07 my favorite button
Aaah! Just as i remember..
we need walt jr. having breakfast for like every 20 seconds
This video came in handy when my friends started making references
Bro wear that cop costume more often
"This whole meth thing sure does pay alot huh?" "Yep"
bro got sneako to play jesse💀
How it should have ended
Better than original
The rust bear sound when he said badger lmao
breaking back
Is that SNEAKO lmaoo
Where is season 5
Literally the best thing on the internet
Ohhh skinny pete
Yo the sneako collab is crazy
walter jr. aka flynn always shows up every breakfast or bbq occasions, how was this not included
I watched the first 3 episodes and I already know most of the story from videos and spoilers everywhere 😭
Those Minecraft doors literally killed me 😂😂😂
Nice, the only thing missing is Mike
I love how they put the pizza on a piece of paper so they can eat it later
Everything was pretty accurate till I assume they ran out of budget for Season 5.
What about Flynn and breakfast?
'ok'
Breaking Bad Good Ending
pretty much
Damn you look kinda sexy in that police outfit
the only reason i watch this video is because of the "bitch, i got 2 of my people's that can sell for us. skinny pete, and badger." quote
2:32 - 2:44 it's the best part of this.
Jack pop's brother:
hector looks different here
i wasnt expecting sneako in this
if only Jesse would've killed Todd
Best
no coughing from walt ? 😱🥸
2:48 he just folds like an omelette
Walt: METH
2:03 my life in a nutshell
serious danny gonzales vibes
You forgot to include Walt and Jesse and every character constantly trying to call each other but no one answers
I like the fact that he spend spent 1/6 of the video only on the pizza scene.
Loved badgers actor he should be in more stuff
“I’m mentally ill bitch” killed me
Didn’t expect a Berserk song here ngl
sneako
*just skips all of season 4*
Yes
this was on my birthday
i dont remember jessie being a fucking foot taller than mr white
This is the moment Hank became Skyler
Favorite video
do one for better call saul now
I watched the whole series, because I wanted to watch  this video, without getting spoiled
why is sneako here lol
2:41 My sleep schedule after watching videos like this at 2:00AM
Bro this is the best recap I've seenabout breaking bad
Baking bread
What do you Methla mean... bitch?
"nothing will go wrong" sounds like its voiced straight from Giancarlo
he did this for his family
That cat has crippiling depretion
What’s the name of the song that plays when that last guy dies
Lmao
Badger has still not been released from jail.
what was that train thing?
„we better call saul“ started laughing my as of
😂😂
I want this video to play on a loop during my funeral
This is ironically what got me to watch the show lol
super innocent nursing home 😭
S
i think you rushed through 2 seasons litle bit
"what do you methlamean..?     Bitch"  im fkn dying
I realise you watched all the breaking bad show
This gave me joel haver vibes
I watched all of breaking bad to watch this lol
There’s an ad for an RV in my recommended during this video Hehe
that was a really solid gus impression
jesse should’ve said yo more
how did he actually sound so much like jesse?
What do you methla mean
No mention about the plane crash. Probably a paper airplane is too much of a hit to the budget
Just how the series should have ended.
Metastasis:
The gus voice is A+
Back when anthpo was funny
The intentionally bad production quality makes this already funny video even more hilarious
Wait is that sneako
Funny
This made me think, what if breaking bad just ended on “dead freight” like hank never finds out about Walt, the neo nazis don’t get introduced, Mike doesn’t die. They just add Tod getting killed by Jesse right after he shoots the kid
Gus is spot on
Inaccurate, not enough “bitch”es
Yes much accurate
This shit wasn’t even in order lmfao
“ ah man ! “
Walt: Haha cool, alright here’s some money, don’t do drugs. Jesse, fully intending to do heroin: Aight BET
I like how he skips like half the show by skipping the whole thing with gus and just cuts to when he dies
Cut too much bruh😭
Get me outta prison
"bitch this sucks"- knock off Jesse Pinkman 2021
missed the oportunity to say every episode of breaking bad badly broken down
Went from season 3 to season 5 in literal seconds
I thought I was dreaming when I heard the Berserk (2016) opening when hank came over to beat up Jessy
i love how the whole gus fring arc is summarized as "this sucks"
Why did I waste my time rewatching Breaking Bad? This is exactly it
I love Fortnite
:)
Nah this is just a summary of breaking bad
okay
you literally spoiled it for me 🖕
Jesse words "Yo" "bitch" "ok"
sneako was going from job to job
“Nah, you’re good” lol 😂
GREAT
Had to stop in the middle bc spoilers but yeah pretty much.  Also this is easily one of the best written shows out there and it's crazy.
As someone who never watched Breaking Bad I can confirm that this video is high quality
you didnt even spoil it correctly lmao
i haven't finished watching it, so it's nice to see it be ruined in a way my adhd ass brain doesn't understand the lore from x
This is the moment
Sub to me. No reason at all. (I’m scummy)
the hank vs jesse scene actually made me choke help
So much better than howsenberg films so much more specific
This is fucking gold!
Yeah . This is the whole Damn show
You look very fuckable in a cop costume
I lost it when Imogen Heap started singing 🤣
Now I don’t even have to watch the show! I have all the info I need right here
I love how Gus is just Jesse with glasses
50 watches in, still can't get over how genius this is... The early 2000s video game graphics.... EPIC!
🦍
Ayo what’s that song in the end
the good ending
“Pizza-time” bro !
more like columbian breaking bad
How did he get away with pirating the whole show
1:58 is clearly the best line in this video  " is me, gus "
You look more like Charlie Chaplin than Walter White
Whats the song right before the outro? 2:48
Lol
0:42 :( DISLIKE, DID not see you on undies 0/10
Nahhh this man used to get SO MAD AT JESSE
at the end, its horrible that he had no XP
Todd died doing what he loved most  Killing kids
I think u forgot to add the part where we r suppose to laugh since this is entirely unfunny
That was fantastic
Hello.
“What do you methla-mean?”
That's the first episode
Heard some INOCHI NO MA KATURE when jane dies
i never get over this
pretty acurate
Remember, since the Hector cat rang the bell again and we never saw Gus fall, the only 100% deaths in the Anthpo Breaking Bad universe are Jane, the kid, and Jack
I loved this show as a kid
Breaking bad in 3 minutes
saul here is not an attorney at law hes a hitman
-Im literally not going to last much longer... - NAH YOU'RE GOOD! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Awesome bro...Todd was best...came out of no where
I love how "B**** this sucks!" perfectly summarized S3-S4.
i stopped it, as season 3 started,... cause i hv to watch full season 3 yo  🤷🏻‍♂️☹️
make breaking good
Jesse looks like Miguel from cobra Kai
0:31 HE SAID THE LINE
lmaooo
I'm surprised about the accuracy
Thank you so much I needed this stupidly genius funny parody of breaking bad cuz watching the show depressed me 😂😂😂💯💯🔥🔥✨
I haven't seen this show before but I think I've seen all I need. I understand everything now.
Love how they showed the kid on the bike yet didn’t show any Walt jr., Marie, or Mike
What do you methilamean?
All Jokes aside tho, Breaking Bad was a Legendary Movie
Damn he looks good in that bald cap
This is more like a summary of the entire show in 3 min
Where is the "Im the danger" part?
AYYYYYYEEEE SNEAKOOOOOOO
you have literally recreated the entire series
*sussy baka*
<3
"yo mister white"  "what?"  "bitch."
Wait… where’s the fly?
This is the best character essay on Jesse
You forgot Tuco “tight tight tight”
Do every episode of peaky blinders.
Beautiful 🕴️🇧🇷👿
Riassuntazzo accuratissimo!!!
Dafuq did I just see?!
“i’m mentally ill bitch”😂
Eyo Mr White
2:28 Me: That delivery is so great I feel like clapping Video: I got you bro *clap track*
the half life dying sound, i cant
Very accurate summary.Please keep up the good work
my name is gustavo
Legends say that this is what you see when you take Heisenberg's meth
why is jesse 6’0
His girlfriend looks like a man, kinda confusing but it's probably better that way so that woman doesn't  have the vibe of the video I guess
The berserk ost killed me
pretty accurate, though you got the gus fring death and the pizza visit backwards
I'm mentally ill, bitch.   I fucking lost it.
i love breaking bad like religiously n this shit is fucking funny lol
im fucking dead
i don't know why but the guy who plays Jesse especially just cracks me up, as well as their dry deliveries of the 'okay...' gets me every time. also when he turns to him and goes 'you're like a son to me' and he smiles and says 'cool' after turning to him just makes me laugh unreasonably hard
Episodes are 30 seconds less.
sneako starting his acting career strong
walter withe with crocks hahahahaha
the good ending
The Todd actor was so perfect that it feels like you did this entire sketch just to get to him, and I love it.  You also look pretty sexy in a cop costume.
“What do you methla-mean” I hate how stupid this is and yet I’m laughing anyways lmao
Breaking bad' summed up: Walter: "Jesse! We need to cook, JESSE!" Jesse: "Ayo MISTAH WHITE!"
I’ve never seen breaking bad
The new Karlson Vibe serie is looking good
This was a wilder ride than I'd bargained for in a 3-minute video.
Love how not a single person knows it’s ducking sneako
This was alot better than i expected. 10/10
ok.
Beautiful
Jesse i told you not to call me here my wife can’t know JESSE!!!
You look cool it in the cop costume!
Golden
ok
Where's the part where Walter does the funny on Todd and his Nazi family?
Best touch was the half life 2 death sound
"I'm mentally ill bitch" is my new favorite quotes
Dude viacom is gonna sue you for uploading actual episodes of breaking bad
2:42 whatchaa sayyy 😭😭😭😭
At this moment walter became anthpo
Sneakoooo
Anyone: "Cool rocks" Hank: *falling heisenberg meme*
he says sorry for ruining it no its so funny and wacky BITCH
the art of shitposting
This is basically breaking bad recapped
2:09 Best moment
accurate
Every single "bitch" was on point
where is the rest of it tho
You forgot the part where they break phones every 4 seconds
You didn't include Skyler being suspicious of Walter every five seconds and Walter somehow making a lie
"i'm mentally ill bitch"
As a fan, I can confirm that this is exactly how breaking bad is
At 1:33, that sounds really like 9mm Parabellum Bullet - Inferno. Can anyone confirm?
Sneako's Emmy winning performance right here.
good ending
dont shoot kids, bitch
This is a masterpiece.
jesse we need to cook
bro who is the actor for badger he deserves an oscar ngl
My leg hurts
That was a solid Gus impression
I love, when Jessie is saying bi*ch word on end of every of his sentence.
LOL
Walt: “I have terminal cancer” Gretchen & Elliot: “We’ll pay your bills” *intro them plays*
"beach" -yeah?
😂
I've never seen Breaking Bad.... until now
never seen this series, but I feel like I got a good summary here. Thanks man!
I saw the title, length, and then smiled very widely and clicked on the video.
No yeah that's more or less accurate
0:50 Lmfao
Nah Walt definitely should’ve yelled at Jesse more
i love skinny pete
0:52 what song name
Never watched breaking bad but thank you for saving me time in the span of 3 mins c: amazin show ima reccomend breaking bad to everyone now since i know what really went down
I followed everything and understood from beginning to end. Thank you for this masterpiece
this was more enjoyable than the actual show tbh
yo sneako
why i seem to have to watch this almost every day and laugh at it too
I really think Jesse believes that the word Bitch is a vowel cause he says it at least 5 times an episode in the same vindictive tone 😂
lol not entirely accurate but pretty close
Gus was spot on
0:42 I started crying laughing lolol
That inaccurate height difference tho lololol
the way you skipped over the entirety of season 3 LMAO
skinny pete got them MOVES
SKINNY PETE AND BADGER R KILLING ME
This is a masterpiece artpiece
shit man i got ending spoiled
posted on my birthday
THE WALK WITH THE PIZZA LMFAOOO
man, this is incredible, lol
“Nothing will go wrong.” 🛎 💥
1:43 I'm trying to memorize it
“Cook meth for me” *zooms in while saying* “nothing will go wrong”😂
'Don't shoot kids, bitch!'  ~Fini~
😂damn
this video is 10x better when you have not seen or have never heard anything about the plot of breaking bad
i like that they couldn't get a 3rd person, so they just got a picture of a badger
This dude looks like TheActMan
There wasn't enough of Walter yelling JESSIE! JESSIE! JESSIE! 0/10
Thanks, saves me from the endless loop of rewatching 👍
The "Dear Sister" bit fit in perfectly, this is truly a work of art
i was like “oh yeah i can just stop the video right after jesse and the hot goth lady do heroin” and then suddenly MY GIRLFRIENDS DEAD
i think this was historically accurate
dreams
You suck
That dear sister was spot on.
"What do you meth-la-mean? ..Bitch" 🤣🤣
You can't sum "every brbad episode" as almost every one makes a story and is very different
i stg you are danny gonzalez
Welp. There goes the 10 GB folder of the show I torrented go straight to the trash bin.
The first 2 seasons took like 3/4 the video and the last 5 were like 30 seconds lol.
Im sad i saw this a year too late
Why does Walter look like Hitler?
Not enough breakfast
I like that I don't have to watch the series now.
how is this every episode, you suck
Gotta love filipino jesse
How was the angry pizza walk so accurate?
This reminds me of the "Blockblister" segment from the Amanda Show.
I was not expecting to see mfing sneako
This is truly a Masterpiece.
I could barely tell it was edited.
What a better ending
u missed hank everywhere
2:22 LMAO THATS HOW WALT WALKS
This clears up all the random little clips I watched cuz I dont wanna watch the show.
I’m so glad someone pointed out how ridiculous this show was
Wait why is hector a cat? Haha
Omg thanks for uploading a full episode I appreciate it
add in hank being overly suspicious and you're spot on
Bravo 🎉
utter  crap
I love the reverence shown to pizza in this vid. Woulda been a real waste had they not used CGpie
I'M MENTALLY ILL.
a masterpiece.
Y’all missed Krazy 8
Don’t worry bro you didn’t ruin it😂😂😂
He made hector a cat
What do you methyla-mean? Bitch.
I haven't seen the show, so I thank you for the synopsis. I'm not joking.
LOL
Thank you for this, i was going t rewatch the series but now i don't have to
I love that he put the tourniquet distal to his veins hahaha
Gary’s Mod Breaking Bad server.
I laughed, I cried, it was in essence a masterpiece, a magnum opus, bitch.
I thought when you said "Every Episode of Breaking Bad" I thought you were talking about the parallelism of each episode. I understand now you meant a condensed version of the entire plot.
He seriously just downloaded an episode of breaking bad and uploaded it to YouTube like we wouldn't notice
Whaddyou Methylamean? Bitch?
but gus dyes after walt throws the pizza on the roof it was a little out of order
lmfao
This was so funny
no minerals
Guess I got... What I deserve
"Ok"
most unexpected but amazing collab
The cat ringing the bell 🤣🤣🤣
Nah, this is dumb. And the montage from the 90-s. Meh...
It's more like every Breaking Bad series ever. But that doesn't make sense coz there's only ONE Breaking Bad series. 🤔🤔🤯🔫
“What do you methyl-mean, bitch?” Comedy gold
"I'm mentally ill bech i'm dying" 🤣
gus looks like a younger gus fr.
Just so you know when you tie off, its better to put the tie on you upper arm rather than your wrist. The whole idea is to stop bloodflow to your heart. You want the tie off to be as close to the heart as possible in order to get the best heroin rush.
I was gonna watch breaking bad
shitpost check pass.
The fact the joke is how low effort it looks is funnier because this would actually be really hard to execute
Well done..thx
1:1 with the show really got every big moment right
Still better than Metástasis. If you don't know what Metástasis is, oh boy! Go look it up and entertain yourselves.
I love how I understand all of this
Pretty accurate
How hasn't this been taken down for copyright yet
SNEAKO representing
Made the show better tbh
You look like Walter Blanko and Jefe Pinkmano
Jessie would have been the perfect victor
Mikasa : ErEh 👁️👄👁️ Walt : JeSsI 👁️👄👁️
Jeese should say more bitch
Where’s Mike?
Pathetic
Why theres no walt jr eating breakfast every five minutes
I can’t believe I sat here and binge watched the entire series…what am I doing with my life
Todd did nothing wrong
Better than the real thing
1:59 "danm he the gus fring son"
Crazy you got the real Todd to come back and play his role again
This is terrible content.
You look so sexy in that cop costume
this is so bad but it's so obviously a labor of love and i absolutely adore it.
oh ma man would've eaten ya alive if I got a chance hottie tempter
You spoiled the shit out of the series.
I like that the entirety of S3, S4 and the second half of S5 is cut from this
almost every character is wearing black crocs. now i can never unsee it when i come back lmao
LMFAOOOO BRO
the guy who did the gus impression nailed it
People letting this hack get subs was a mistake
for someone that hasnt seen breaking bad, i do not know how to feel
I think you missed a spot
If i were to parody breaking bad, id compare the dynamic of walt and jess e to that of rick and morty.
This is way better than rewatching all them episodes before I start better call Saul
Love that random berserk 2016 reference
So... is this supposed to be funny?
Imma ba real with you, this shit was GENIUS!!!  Do more!!!
U should've showed walt
Lmfao Sneako
2:01 this is the best Gus impression I have ever seen
That Gus impression was dead on 😂
And that kids… is how I met your mother
JESSE
The most overrated show in the history of man.   Better Call Saul, however, is fucking fantastic
Directed by : Beans Giligan              I’ll stop now
pizza time!  no
Когда-нибудь я выучу английский... Когда-нибудь...
dope video, title kinda threw me off tho, definitely more of a "dismantling negative" than "every episode of___"
0:49 and badger HASJDASHJD man I can't im dying
the fact that the pizza is practically impossible to be thrown on the roof like walt did is insane.
Gums fring
Ayo Mr white
true
I'm mentally ill bitxh I'm dying
2:00 I love how he skipped over 2 seasons in 10 seconds because it's so hard to make jokes out of them(cuz they're great)
He said "Nothing will go wrong" perfectly tf
1:34 the moment it started playing inferno lmfao
I swear Saul is the guy that gets the payday gang out of police custody
Holy shit the fucking gmod death, I'm crying laughing
Truth
What do you meth la mean lol
I'm mentally ill 😂
"cool" proceeds to angrily stomp and throw a photoshopped pizza into the roof
I've seen the actual series, this is pertty accurate
Please do this for every show on the planet
Legendary
Holy- lookin fine in that cop outfit, anthpo 😯
2:35 “What do you methlaMEAN… b****
Jesse we need to cook
Some funny as joke's in this one.
sneako is the goat
Amazing
:)
What about breakfast? There wasn't enough breakfast!
Jesse was actually really intelligent bringing Badger and skinny Pete remember that they are the best hitman's of west Mississippi
Wow this cop costume... You look saxy af in it.
The stupid effects, make this so much funnier.
2:22 HAHAGAAA
Teachers when a student is being beaten to death: “whatever”    Teachers when a kid is 2 seconds late for class: 1:35
Nah you just made it better lmao
0:26 literally filmed like a fallout dialogue
They had berserk 2016 opening lol
SNEAKO
Please tell me you're continuing this i need to see walt collapse but its you
What do you methlamean.... bitch
Mr white that was pretty accurate.. bitch
What do you meth-la-mean, b!tch - Jesse Pinkman 2020
0:48 what about combo? :(
Mistah white
Cringy
"what do you meth-la-mean.... bitch.."
“What do you methyl amean?” I’m quoting tht everyday
Rip badger
Wow that was a good episode of breaking bad i enjoyed the alot
I love how it spoils everything but at the same time, nothing  Thank you
Its as if i rewatched the whole show in just 3 minutes
The minecraft edits murder me
When the show finishes, we need an “every episode of Better Call Saul”
im mentally ill, bitch
True
The Minecraft door killed me🤣🤣🤣
When I saw Badger I died lmfaooo
“I’m mentally ill, bitch”
“I’m mentally ill bitch”
i like to think that when jesse said "this sucks" when they were cooking is when he explained the math of how much money they are making in comparison to gus
0:46
pretty accurate not gonna lie
berserk music: funny
why are the jesse and gus impressions actually passable
Bro this if fucking hilarious lmaooo
This was hilarious
Verdict: Okay.
Damn u look so Sexy in this Cop Costume😍
I'm still on season 2
This.... honestly, yeah.
"hey its me tuco give me more of this blue stuff" "ok" *sets off life threatening explosion* "pleasure doing business with you"
this is so fucking funny????  also sexiest cop i ever seen
I'm reporting you for just uploading episodes.
Walts like vin Diesel but with meth
Brilliant
Sneakoooo
skinny pete and badger 😂
I did not expect to hear the Berserk 2016 opening song in this lmao
mr white we need to cook
Best breaking bad analysis ever
lol
i love how the end isnt a spoiler
this is the first episode not every episode
nice
skinny pete is the shit
As someone who has never seen breaking bad, I can confirm this is accurate.
а есть такая же но на русском
Why is this a masterpiece?
Why?? I'm mentally ill bitch
I thought I was gonna hate this and I loved it
not a single scene with mike /:
ahahaha sneako caught me so off gaurd
The badger sound effect is priceless
You know this parody might need a bit more insanity……better call Saul
agreed
Gotta love how the skipped out the later half of season 5 and just had it end on Todd dying....we wont ever know what happens next
0:46 XD
you had me at minecraft door. 😂😂
I like how this all happened because he only had a few more months to live.
wtf u got the real Todd from the show? not bad..
We must *COOK* We need to *COOK* We have to *COOK*
Am dieing bro so funny cook more videos anthpo
Impressive.
10/10 show
we need more of sneako in these videos
Me encanta la escena de la pizza jajaja
The fact that Todd dies literally makes this better.
I waited a whole year to watch this because I could only watch one episode of Breaking Bad a week and I’m finally finished
The pizza throw was what made Breaking Bad Broken Badly..
This, is art. Thanks man!
Почему Джесси негр?
Spot on
"im mentally ill, im literally not gonna last much longer-"   walter: Nah, you're good.     LMFAO the accuracy
There’s only missing one thing: YEEEEAH BITCH...✨MAAAAAAGNETS✨
what is the song at 0:53?
I bust out laughing when I saw Badger was a real badger 😂
Sneako
Yep that's it that's the show
"Welter Wade" lmao
Metástasis chapter
Anthpo: "I don't have the budget to throw pizza on a roof." "What you don't have pizza? I can buy you pizza." Anthpo: "No I bought the pizza I just can't throw it on the roof." " *Ohhh* cause everything is a green screen. Sometimes I forget lol." Anthpo: "No this scene alone will be filmed on location."
as someone who hasnt watched breaking bad...  this is exactly what the episodes are like
Every Breaking Bad episode is PERFECTION
bitsch
"why- im mentally ill. bitch, im dying"
the good ending
"what do you methylamean?"
Nice to see sneako
should have snapped a flip phone in half
Why Jessie is black? >:O
"I'm mentally ill bitch"
lol you used a honey badger for Badger
Cook meth for me, nothing will go wrong.
2:00 how gus he was ...like absolute perfect voice
oh hey this was released on my birthday
i love how they didnt waste the pizza
this video is very funny
So I only saw the first season. This was crazy
Accurate
1:37 berserk funny animation man
whats the name of the music before hank beats jesse?
I sent this to my friend 30 minutes before he starts watching breaking bad and Now he wants to burn my house. I think I better call Saul for that.
The half life 2 death killed me
Make a part 2
2:22 anyone gotta hint of that music  And Good vid guys
You in a cop costume tho..
1:04 Whats the song name??
Jokes aside, this was a great summary of the whole series.
If anyone asks me to break down this show, ill give them this link
The little cat ticking the bell at 2:06 HAHHAAH dude, i loved it
Thanks!
PIZZA TIME
1:34 what is up with the berserk song lol
I watch this video everyday
every episode of the walking dead would be funny
Jesse cry all the time
I guess Todd did get what he deserved. Don't shoot kids, bitch!
I'd be better if white randomly just insulted and verbally abused Jessie when he said he loved him
based
damn Sneako
Why Jesse taller than Walt? 😂
Very realistic.
The good ending
I'm mentally ill bitch
the thing is if jesse had shot todd the whole thing wouldve ended way better
"Hey mister white!" "What's up?" "BITCH! I set the meth on fire"
Pleasure doing busines
9mm parabellum bullet inferno
Jesse killing Todd is the good ending where him and Walter successfully run the empire for the rest of their years. Mike retires and Walt jr goes to college and has a successful career in the automotive industry. Jesse marries Andrea and they raise Brock together
Now do it for real
I'm sad I could watch the rest of this until I finished the show   but I did anyway
1:40 "jesse we need more money" thats the most accurate thing ive ever heard
Eyy it's sneak
I mean.....yeah that's pretty much it....you could have added hank's death too
The Gus impression was immaculate
It is at this exact moment that spooge became hector salamancas wheelchair.
Anyone else thinks he kinda looks and sounds like Danny Gonzales
You look sus in that cop costume
You sure this isn't just clips from the actual show? Seems pretty legit
Good one
“Cook meth for me. Nothing will go wrong”
Do a part 2 PLEASE
My literal favorite part about all of this is how events that happen in season 1-5 just happen randomly like how after Gus dies we get the pizza scene and also how Hank beating the living crap out of Jesse just seems random here
since when does a badger sound like a bear from WoW? that one got me haha
perfect until one detail Jesse didnt shoot Tod after he kills the boy. you easily forgot to show 10 hours of screentime in your short parody.
Out of context this is just so extremely stupid it’s great
Over hyped.. Average show
As Walter white I can confirm that this is 100% correct
it's could be better :I
This thing is better than the Colombian version XD
2:49 he died in his home 😭
He talks exactly like gus1:58
I like that it's implied Tuco just kinda bought some meth and then just disappeared
This is the moment bitch turned into lasagna
These are better effects than endgame
That’s not how i remember it-
I don’t know Anthony, you’ve been seeming sus lately…
you missed the whole ending
this is the best video out there as of right now.
JESSE
they happen in the wrong order but they're still accurate lmaoooo
1:12 he even added my rims chops in the background LMAOO
SNEAKO HAHA
tbh i like that ending
When you're interested in Breaking bad but too lazy to watch the whole thing.
WHERE IS MIKEEEE?
I'm crying😂
0:41 what the fuck is he saying bruh
😂😂😂😂😂😂
The best video I've ever seen
Fucking hilarious. One of the funniest breaking bad parody out there.
Pog
HOOOOW HOOWW DID HE DO THAT THE GUY WHO SAID "COOK METH FOR ME NOTHIN WILL GO WRONG" IT'S DAMN PERFECT HOWWW
Pity we didn't see Hank going insane in his garage with the beer and investigation
I love how you just skipped all of season 3 and 4
AHHAHAHAHA
title is wrong its not every its all
just finished the show and this is 100% accurate nice job
Skinny Pete and badger   * Badger is a literal a badger*
"Don't shoot kids, bitch"
SNEAK0
Yup, exactly how I remember
The Tuco thing is HILARIOUS
Bro this feels like the entire show in 3 minutes
I've never seen this show but I feel like I understand
cringe
This felt like way longer than 3 minutes
This was the exact moment Walt became Heisenberg
SNEAKI
One thing I would add: junior eating breakfast
"I'm mentally ill, *bitch!"* was amazing.
I’m mentally ill bitch 😂
SNEAKO
GODDAMNIT JESSE!
ok are we not gonna talk about how on point the costumes were though?
You notice that the actor for Todd is like a fat Matt Damon…. FATT DAMON
Is it Jack pop?
dude saved a lot of time.
Help my device is watching me I literally just finished the show and this pops up
But what if it turned into minecraft!?!?!?! https://youtu.be/H13dKAuXTvk
No one's talking about Badger
That was amazing
Todd was the protagonist all along
2:02 why did that sound exactly like Gus?
1:34 is https://youtu.be/O5RHkSKK4Dk 2016 berserk inferno
… basically
Jessy: Im broke and I have no home, I have nowhere to live Walter: yes very sad, anyway...
Fuckin love skinny pete
Perfect now i dont need to watch it XDXDXD
I've already seen the last episode but it was nice you didn't include the end of it for spoilers
"What do you methla-mean?"   "Bitch?"  gold
JESSÈ
True
wanna cook?
They are 2 people. They can littarly do scenes together no problem, but they still chose to do one guy at a time on the greenscreen.   Love it
Perfection
why is the berserk theme in this
Uh ackchyually Todd got choked with a chain not shot. Good vid tho!
Lmao
I can die happy now
This is good and accurate
Moral of the story: dont shoot kids, bitch
That was the best Gus impression ever
1:20 what song?
damn Walter White is so sussy baka right now
Jokes on me cause when I was watching season 5 I wondered when Todd would bring up the train.
Am I the only one who noticed Sneako in this video? 😂
Wow this actually doesn't spoil shit LMFAO
The only thing you killed that gave you experience points was a literal child lol
You really stopped the video before even finishing the show...
He sounds more like Walter white junior than senior😅
1:35 berserk op 🗿
I’m surprised this hasn’t been copyright striked.
I’m mentally ill b*tch 😂
you polish?
2:40 xD
how can you make fun of the best show in the world
Lmao true
Why was there no fly episode reference 2/10 smh
It’s so good, like I just finished bb
Sneako?
very
Jesse voice
"i'm mentally ill bitch"
Among us
Idk walt, ur acting a bit sus lattely
I like that you put the pizza on the paper so you could still eat it lmao
"Im mentally ill bitch IAM DYING"
As someone who hasn't seen the show... wtf
6/10
مبدددع 👏
"Skyler, you know all the sacrifices I’ve made, I made them for my YouTube channel"
This is the moment when
you didn’t ruin it, you made it better.
the berserk 2016 intro guitar took me back dude lmao nice vid
This is so stupid and poorly done that it's genuinely hilarious! 😆
Why'd you rip and upload the Columbian Breaking Bad version?
Literally froffing at the mouth  Hey baby you mist a spot
#Badger
Walt saying "jesse" angrily every 10 seconds*
SNEAKO let’s go!
“Anthony jokes about cooking meth for 3 minutes straight.”
I dont know this serie and i dont want to now
0:33 I was waiting for "aaaahh wire"
i love this
I love that you put #badger as if it’s a trend
THIS VIDEO IS FAKE!!! YOU DON'T SHOW THE EPISODE WHERE THEY KILL A FLY!!! THERE'S AN ALL EPISODE ABOUT IT!!!
Ffs when you put it like that its a shitshow, but a good one
The word bitch wasn’t used enough
still better than metastasis
Ahhh finally the exclusive Vince Gilligan cut sees the light of day
This is like breaking bad, if it was done for a school play
the skinny pete bit fucking killed me
The Badger we deserve.
why that song on todd's death tho, it hurtsssss!!!!!!!!
I started watching breaking bad and was genuinely surprised it wasn't exactly like this
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
I just watched every season of breaking bad in 3 minutes.
This has strong Abed vibes
As someone who has never even seen breaking bad, I have no idea what the hell is happening.
POV: the good ending
Didn't this guy get canceled?
This is the bad ending, where Hank never takes a shit and the show ends with season 5A
cop costume finna make me bust  i'm mentally ill
God I thought you were a women in a black hat till I heard you say "ok"
You didn’t ruin the show for me, bitch
What song is that guitar riff in the end from???
Yo btch
Anthpo, please take off Sneako's channel from the description. He has revealed himself to be extremely disrespectful, homophobic and anti-covid as for the past few months.
I forgot the plot of this show lamp and this actually helped lmaooo
W-wait what?
mether jesse meth!!!
i wish it ended how you showed it
Mike - "Are you sure about this walter? You dont want to do that walter. Walter, I wouldnt if i were you. Dont even think about it walter."
Go beat off to cuties you fucking loser
How the series should’ve ended
I hate badger with a passion
that badger dont sound right…
You should change the title of this video to (breaking bad but walt is an absolute chad)
JESSERD WE NEED TO CUCK METHY SO I CAN FUEL MY KETAMINE ADDICTION!!
SNEAKO!!!
So we are not going to talk about Skyler being a B*tch and f*cking this Ted ?
lmao love the half life death sound over todd
What was that song at the end when the blonde dude gets shot?
lmaooo, sneako and anthpo
sneako?
Yes...don't waste any pizza
Why is Jesse half a meter taller than Walter?
Wheres the fly..
2:17 walter has good taste in pizza
Damn that was pretty funny
wtf did i just watch, am i high or what XD
LMAOOOO BADGEER 💀💀
I never seen breaking bad and on youtube are appearing a lot of these video haha
Where is Mike bictchhhh
honestly this is not funny
1:59 he legit looks like a high school Gus Fring
I LAUGHED MORE THAN I SHOULD HAVE
02:30 to the end is funniest imo, especially when the kid gets shot wit the minecraft xp💀
Heisenburgor
Braking bed
Walter looks like white big smoke by the end
hey yo mr white  wassup  B*tch XD
2:02 it sounds exactly like the real Gus
What do you Methly-mean Best joke of the entire video
Is that Sneako??
i need anthpo to do the colombian version now
you didnt even mention huell b**ch
Basic Pooh: Breaking Bad Sophisticated Pooh: Metastasis Me, an intellectual:
i clicked because i thought i saw sneako in the thumbnail and i was not disappointed
WAIT HOLD ON IS THAT OG ALMONTE???
This felt like 15min, loved it
Skinny pee xd
This was the funniest shit I've ever seen.
Dude, what's your onlyfans?  I gotta see you in that cop costume.
u didn't ruin it. you made it be full
Ok
No Saul 😢
The moral of the day, as told through breaking bad. "Don't shoot kids bitch"
"Cook meth for me. Nothing will go wrong."
Did you really think you could just upload the actual show and get away with it?
the good ending??
I love the idea of some random bald guy going "YOU." at a dude just living his life and then he beats him up
do a Sons of Anarchy version
now this is art
Ok, Now when am I suppose to laugh? But this is very accurate.
that roof pizza looks so good they had to put a wrapper under it so they can eat it
“Cook meth for me. nOThInG wilL gO wRoNg.”
the pizza editing killed me LMAO
9mm parabellum guitar solo
Budget cuts
I like how "Jesse" 😂😂😂 is bigger and taller than Walter
Don't shoot kids, bitch
is this like a budget gus johnson?
Sneako?
Its me gus         -gus
Haven't seen it, but it's strangly accurate
You missed the part where Jesse cries.
where hte rest
1:35 is that the berserk opening?
2:06 Hawwwwwwwww
you don't understand this is now my favorite video EVER!! 💞💕💞💕💞💕
MMM WHATCHA SAYY
*The Good Ending*
I love how skinny Pete is just dancing in the background
Wow, a cinematic masterpiece
“I’m mentally ill bitch” *-Jesser*
Yo Mr White! ( bitch!).
You made it better thank you
“Hey yo mr white” “Whats up?” “Bitch”
PLSSS SKINNY PETE
kryoz
Seriously why is this accurate
This video is sponsored by Pieology: The pizza to be a throwing device
The budget on this is what makes it amazing
I just finished BB ten minutes ago and i have to say that’s pretty accurate
yes
You missed the most important thing: THE TIMELAPSES, (It is the signature of Breaking bad :))
The badger xmsjmdnd
No Walt Jr and no Mike makes me sad
Actually.. everything is bcz of fucking Todd guys. I will announce the episode's release day when Todd shot Drew as "Fuck The Todd Day"
that pretty much it..
Inaccurate... there was not a yo in there, Jesse
yo how'd they get the real actors
When you can't afford a Netflix subscription...
“Bitch?”   “Okay”
Garbage
Where’s that title card intro from? I’ve watched the entire show and never saw it
Do the breaking bad spin off with Jessie, it was name after a car or some Spanish shit
This isn’t every episode this is the whole show
Where the fuck is gus
Pleasure doing business 😂
This is probably accurate
Hey Yo!! You ruined the fucking show, bitch!!! You didnt show Gus slitting Victor throat. Yo, I'm so disapointed.
"What up biatch!"
This Jesse is more like Victor
I haven't watched like the last 30 secs of the show
"Its me Gus." "Hi Gus." "Cook meth for me, *nothing will  go wrong* "
what do you methlamiean??? WOW great job guys ahahhaha
Jesse we need to cook!
this is the greatest thing I've seen in a while
Lol, you didn't ruin the show. Memes already took care of that. (Jk, weaklings let memes ruin things for them)
Yeah, sounds about right
"walter wait"
Badger being a literal badger is gold.
Too short n missed a lot
"No you're good"  "Ok"
This is like what someone would explain if they heard the plot of Breaking Bad from 3 rooms away over the sounds of running water with a fan in their ear
*Oke*
SNEAKOOOOO
"nah you're good"
there is a always a scene where either walt is yelling at jessie while he is sitting down staring blankly or jessie is yelling at walt while he stares blankly
Gus 😂
Guess he did got what he deserved
This doesnt have enough likes
gus= sus=amogus ඞ ඞඞඞඞඞ
Ok.
Drugs
they gave him 2 years to live, 24 is not a couple
They deserve every view lmao
The fact Mike is completly left out :/
I like that you just stopped mid-way through season 5
he did forget probably the most important line “AINT THAT RIGHT GOMIE”
METHENTHETOMEAN
0:42 then jesse woke up
Breaking Good looking fine
N1
YOu're so cute in your sleep LMFAOOOOOOO
yeah seems about right
Didn’t know it was legal to post all of the breaking bad episodes on YouTube
very very good indeed
Does anyone know what that song at the end is?
i gained braincells watching this
What's the song at 1:19?
@cat
bruh you made the show even better
nobody: plan b: 2:42
Moral of the story:  Don't shoot kids       bitch
yeah science
Jesser
More like the entire show instead of every episode
Pizza time
lamo
I love how badger was a real badger 😂
DUDE YOU CANT KEEP POSTING FULL SHOWS ON YOUTUBE!!!! YOU WILL GET COPIRIGHTTG!!!!
the order is all fucked up but its pretty funny
sus
This video was about 200 breakfasts short
I’m doing this for my family
"You only have maybe a couple months to live" "Okay...:)"
Jesse: "Ayo, Mr. White."  Walt: "What's up?"  Jesse: "Bitch."  Speech 100 Intelligence 10
You forgot they killed a fly
I came back. Now that I finally watched the whole show.
I was once a scared coward at one point, didnt know what a song was on a YouTube video..... the song at the ending is baby blues by bad finger
Jessie: I'm mentally ill I'm going to die I'm not going to last much longer  Walter: nah you're good Jessie: Ok
You didn’t put a spoiler warning and I accidentally watched the whole thing
Looks like fun
still waiting on the joke
I love this.
Gonna tell my kids this is the original breaking bad
you just summed up the whole series in 3 minutes
For some reason the line “It’s me, Gus” absolutely killed me
But you missed the most important episode: Fly
I almost forgot to watch this today...
cook meth for me, nothing will go wrong
Fairly accurate
What do you methyla-mean....   bitch
Still better than Methastasis
Tuco's place playing the jellyfish house party music LOL
skinny pete grooving in the background is more pure than walt's meth
That gus impression was on point.
If you wanna speed run the series, this might be in your best interest /and it's super well done even  Like you will miss out of some great scenes, but might be worth it.
the "ayo mista wheit" is so accurate
the minecraft xp when todd shoots the kid 😂
So I sent this to my boyfriend, he immediately started quoting lines from this video, I asked how did he watch this 3 minute long video in 10 seconds, he said he already watched this yesterday. AND HE DIDN'T SEND THIS TO ME, OUR RELATIONSHIP IS NO MORE!!!! You must share the best stuff with your love!!!! WTH!!!
Here’s a bag of money, don’t do drugs.
Ew ugly video
0:50 amazing image
The editing is so poor, yet so thoughtful. Excellent job!
I come back to this video almost every day lmao
Where’s Haaaaank? -with Heisenberg voice
0:53 Thats not an episode, that is the movie...
this is pure gold

ive never seen breaking bad and this seems about right
stupid but that's true XDDD
‘What do you methly mean bitch’ lol
1:13 easily the best part of the video
I died when Badger was literally a Badger 🤣
This is too inaccurate to take jovially
gus looks like tuco lol
Oh what the hell you fucked up the ending
Is this Sneako?
1:21 tying the tourniquet around his wrist and forearm would make the veins in his hand bulge so it would make zero sense for him to shoot up in the regular spot in the bend of the elbow. It would make more sense for him to shoot up in his wrist or hand if he ties the tourniquet this way. Who taught this man how to do heroin 😂
Hey cuties is a lovely movie !
This is no joke one of the most hilarious videos I've seen on this site
Where is mike??
Oh hi Sneako
the minecraft door shut 🤣 automatic like
man i love u
you actually made my day.
pure talent
this ending was better, then the ending of the show
the mc doors make this perfect
nice.
This man played the Berserk opening too op!!
1:23
What was the song at 1:37
The game was rigged from the start
Cool
actually spent the past month watching all of breaking bad just so I could watch this video it was worth it
i was gonna comment on how the guy pretending to be jesse isn't white, but somehow, that fact makes the "everything is slightly off and bootleg-ish" nature of this video even more hilarious
2:42 great great great
The minecraft doors got me😂
Music at 1:33 ???
The finger guns and Minecraft doors broke me.
this is the best video ever
"here's a bag of money, don't do drugs" "Aight bet"
"Never have i ever been so offended by something i 100 agree with"
YOU
Jesse depressed Walter youre ok Jesse ok, this is my gf walter she ded jesse depressed Walter youre ok Jesse ok, this is my new gf walter she ded  jesse despressed in slavery walter youre ok with other ID jesse ok.
what do you methla-mean bitch
TOBY!!!!
We need 5 more minutes of just Walt jr eating breakfast
*ooooo whatcha sayyyy*
Why was hector a *fuckin cat* 🐈
*Skinny Pete milly rockin thru da maddness*
Alwsome, generous!!
Anthpo be lookin fine with dat cop costume doe 😳
do Stranger things next please :)
Jesse: Hey this is my girlfriend... Walter: Haha, cool. Here's a bag of money, don't do drugs. Jesse: *Do drugs* I love how you summed up a more than 5 episodes in two lines
"What do you methyla-mean?" Greatest line in the history of youtube
As a 13 year old I can confirm, that I have never watched this show
Brown Jessie is good
GOOD ENDING: Now Walt will never met the nazis, Hank lives and Jesse keeps the girl
Phenomenal
Cracked up when saw that “badger” of his
2:35 best. pun. ever.
No one:   Kids at school: 1:52
this is truly the moment walter white became Heisenberg
I feel like he based this purely off of the first few episodes
There were no pancakes 0/10
Where was the Tuco impression?
Having never seen Breaking Bad I can only assume this is accurate . . .
I can't believe I've wasted my time watching 6 seasons of Breaking Bad. I could've just watched this...
Im missing Ted Beneke in here
I wont shoot kids I’ll shoot children
I wanted to dislike this video. Found it... impossible. I appreciate your hard work.
Walt: ok 😂
Damn when they said every episode they said EVERY episode
Jessie pinkman more like jessie ni
mmm wacha say
This video cured my depression
Skinny Pete is the absolute highlight.
This was hilarious
Yup, basically
Literally just semi accurately summed up 4 seasons and probably near 50 hours of content, in 3 mins. AND made it funny. Props to ya :D
Inaccurate, Jesse wasn't crying 2/3 of the whole show
Skinny Pete dance got me
skinny pete and badger introduction always kills me xD
lol ol
That man in last  "HEY U GUYS ROBBING A TRAIN OR SOMETHING?" *GUNSHOT* that was hilarious
Awesome ahahah
Where's the rest? XD this is brilliant!
this was almost good
“What do you methlamean. Bitch.”
I lost it when the minecraft door closed
Pinkman: mr White i det the meth on fire Mr white: oh man Pinkman: i rated us out to the dea  Mr white: oh man This broken me
You look fabulous. No homo. Period.
Amazing.
pretty acurrate
Thats so epic 😂
I mean....basically
This entire video reminds me of one of those green screen skits that Danny Gonzalez does.
Not enough gasping from Walter white
"I'm mentally ill, bitch" gets me everytime
Hahahahahahahahahahahah!!!!
It's me Gus.
Sneako looks like a awkward lesbian.
Gus died like in 10 seconds after he appeared
2:49 song?
bro skinny pete is awesome
you forgot "aaaah wiiire"
nice 3 min summary of breaking bad
That pizza throw make me lose all of my shit, all of my diarrhea, i just explode in caca, my god that was funny as hell dude
That’s brilliant
1:35 I guess you could say Hank went *"berserk"* on those guys.
Name's Todd. Heard you guys need methylamine.  What do you methyla-mean,... _b i t c h?_
+Eyo Mr White -what’s up +Bitch.
Waiting for Walt jr to eat breakfast
da baby
This was more of a rundown of the whole show instead of showing the typical episode
what do you methylamean
Only Legends will get that Dear Sister Watcha Say reference 😂😂
What do you meth la mean ........................................................................ bitch
Not Funny!
"I'm mentally ill,  bitch. "
You need yo make more
Why is the guy playing Gus so good lol
I was waiting for Walt Jr to say the n word
Man I thought this was gonna be comedic but also accurately summarise each episode of the show, I would have liked if it did more of the latter but other than that it was so damn good. Thanks for the best laugh I have had in a while
man skipped 3 whole seasons like bruv
I like how “every episode” is just the plot of breaking bad
when jesse said bitch i felt that
2:00 holy hell that impression is top tier
AMC with 10 dollars of financing
Why did i waste like 3 months of my life watching the full series
I love how Jesse and Gus are casted as 2 asian boys
I’m mentally ill bitch I’m dying
I am eating pieology pizza when the showed the pieology pizza box
Bitch
this was a really good summary of the part that i watched last summer lmao
Man the production value on this is better than the real thing
of all the things i expected in this video, toby showing up as todd was not one of them
I guess they meant "every episode of breaking bad" instead of "every episode of breaking bad"
i accidentally played this on 2x speed and it felt normal
Laughed my fucking ass off, haven't seen shit like this since fucking ageeeees ago, good content my guy
This has a jreg vibe
Man, that was really great Lmao
Shut up nerd
"Bitch"
He actually sounded pretty similar to gus
walt: Jesse we need more money jesse: why bitch im mental ill, im dying  lmao that shit got me so bad idk why
Bruh if anything you made it better
I’m mentally ill bitch 💀
ffs murray is like so annoying
#Walter
i would want to unsub if you wore a cop costume jk no
so that happens for 5 seasons, 13-14 episodes per season    *damn nice*
Why does jessie look like Lucas from nct?
Don't shoot kids Bitch  (Bone breaking sounds)
Ok  Ok
Bitch
Bro you can't just upload full episodes of Breaking Bad to YouTube man you're gonna get in trouble.
Not enough bitch
I mean forget about the cop costume, I'd rather see you with it off!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEiYC_7HsrY&ab_channel=Daredaron
After a month of watching the show I can now say I get that reference.
wait SNEAKO
why is the line "it's me, gus" sound so damn funny
Cringe
Yes, kids, that's exactly how it went down
0:51 BRO ain't that the bear sound from skyrim?
This makes the show even better
"I'm mentally ill, bitch"
Had to stop and watch the entire series before coming back to this....was not disappointed
jesse saying "bitch" every three seconds is so goddamn accurate
I literally just finished this yesterday
This is so accunderate
Season 3 and 4 is summed up with "Bitch this sucks" 2:03
Do “every episode of Octonauts”
Walter jr isn’t eating breakfast???????
The Fuck is wrong with u
walter
i love this part of breaking bad
Hey, that's not Mr white or me!!  this is fake I'm suing u  BITCH
How has this been out for 4 months and I haven't seen it😭
funny
Huh I don't know why but I thought that this show was about zombies
every episode walt gets diagnosed with cancer
:0 sneako pogg
like the berserk opening👌🏽
take this  concept and add the drawing over them with ai thing and this could be a really good animated goof
“i’m mentally ill bitch”
No
not fun ...
Best resume ever
Cringe
"Ayo mister white, bitch!"-Jesse
GIVE MA BOY SHNEAKO SOME CREDIT
I lost it when the pizza went ↗️⬆️↖️
This actually made me laugh
Jesse: “yo mr white can you give me my money BITCH?” Walter: “i presume you won’t blow it on drugs?” Jesse:  R I G H T  O N *actually buys drugs like a boss* *H e r o i n e   t i m e*
I loved this even though I have never watched this show.
Wow breaking bad with Minecraft flavour vala
when the kid burst into xp i died
Still better than Metastasis
Polic codsume (
i forgot the song. song ? 0:53
you looked pretty good in that costume
2:33 LULW
i have never watched a single episode of this show and i am incredibly confused, though entertained.
"You got maybe like couple months to live" "Okay" *Hate it when that happens*
this was not all, the show did not end in the train heist :/
sneako being in this
Why dose he look like the two dollar hitler
This is so damn bad and good at the same time😂😂😂😂
JESSER
Bro I was not expecting sneako to show up in this biatch
"Im mentally Ill... Bitch." Aaron Paul shit actor only actor is Sneako
UMM... actually this isnt every episode  of breaking bad, and if you were a real fan, you would know this XD... this is just a summary of the series like, lol, does the entire 5 seasons happen in each episode??? Yeah. Didn't think so. try better next time anthpoop. this video is stupid man
What do you methylamine... ? *shit, I forgot my line* B I T C H *got it*
Accurate representation
Better than Metastasis
Was that Hector Salameowca?
I don't remember the ending being like that... Hmmm
Melhor atuação possível , atores incríveis cada um de sua única maneira e meu personagem favorito com certeza é a pizza jogada no telhado
aight 🅱️et
no you're good... lost it
I just started watching sneko before I saw this god ddam
The edit with the XP was so wrong, you didn't have to do that 😭
Not enough coughing
1:00 skinny pete. genius
My guy goes to Pieology and gets a fuckin plain cheese on what looks to be gluten free crust?!? You go to a place where you can make your own personal pizza and he only gets cheese? Unsubscribing right now.
You forgot Walt constantly calling Jesse a dumbass
yo yo yo that beat at 1:14 slapped ngl what it be do tho
the good ending
thanks this was better than the show, i could've just watched this instead of sitting through that nonsense
When the kid died and it started playing that split second of that song omg I died
0:51 badger be looking  s t a n c e d
Plot twist. Badger is actually a badger. I also love it every time Jesse pauses after a sentence and then says "bitch"
*BET*
The ending tho
Asian Jesse
extremely talented!  always get's me 0:57-1:00
We.need to go to the mosque jesse
The ending was pretty accurate
I’ve never watched an episode of braking bad and  I can confirm all of this is extremely accurate
бля полная дичь  Кому это вообще понравилось?
i've never seen a single episode of breaking bad. don't need to now
Where’s Walt Jr
I don't think they watched the show
“Ey yo Mr White!”  “Yes?”  “Bitch”
Yo I like the special feature at the end tho😂
The pizza throw happened way before gus died
This sparks joy
evrybody gangsta till walter whip out the explode gus button
I never watched the show before so this so out of context for me 👁👄👁
next level shitposting
I love u
1:33 song name?
SNEAKO
1:35 Berserk mode kicks in
So this is Breaking Bad's "good ending"?
If I made it that far scale on one to ten 9 no homo
I can’t believe I just realized there are two people instead of one.
Still better than Metastasis
Do this with dexter
Jesse we need to go the mosque
Skinny pete is a legend
"I am the one who knocks." Walter "car engine" White.
No fly
If only the ending was canon
Ok now where is the fly episode
The pizza on the roof in BB wasn't scripted. It just happened and Gilligan decided to keep it because it was awesome  lol
I watched this before and after watching breaking bad.  I wish I had some meaningful observation to make.  I do not.
*This is 99.9% pure*
Haha cool.
We can see that jessie is a good person because he believes shooting children is bad
I hope this doesn't spoil the show for me
That sounded like Gus when you said "nothing will go wrong"
Pizza time!             - Tobey Maguire
The train part where he shoots the kid made no sense for me since i'm only on the 3rd season Edit: it makes sense now
Accurate
Those effects are so cool for real I couldn’t donthat
Walt: Pizza time Skyler: no
The good ending
when jesses girlfriends looks more like jesse than jesse does
bro... now you spoiled everything
Hank is Berserk
I love how its literally *all* greenscreen
Jesse saying bitch every other sentence was so accurate
What do you methylaMEAN... bitch. *claps*
Do you know what would be really fun? Every episode of Lucifer
I started  to watch breaking  bad  because of this
i died when i saw toby haha
"I am mentally ill,bitch" got me dyin :D
Holy shit you did it!
he had to wear a bald cap. on his bald head.
"nothing will go wrong"
Got the ending wrong lol
Mmm dat cop costume doe
I dont even watch breaking bad but this is hilarious
0:17 me high watching my imaginary friend go
Now it's time for Every episode of Better call Saul
that skinny pete dance got me
What do you methla-mean  Bitch
When you can’t afford breaking bad or Netflix:
1:40 Walter: Jessy we need more money Jessy: whyy duuh.. I'm mentally ill bitch. IM DYING!  Walter : 👁️👄👁️
WHAT DO YOU METH LA MEAN?💀
Become hisenburg
That pizza scene! Beautiful edit
skinny pete
Incredible...
*Explosion* Walt: Pleasure doing business. Tuco: Pleasure doing business.
the fucking walk in the pizza scene is so painfully accurate
y o  b i t c h
Damm bro new Breaking Bad
1:12 music in the back?
I loved this. Also SNEAKOOOOO
Those Minecraft doors tho 👏😂
fucking lost my shit at 2:25
Why I'm mentally ill bitch I'm dieing
Bruh Toby
Well... That was pretty much exactly what happened. Guess this means I don't have to rewatch the show
tuco is the whitest hispanic dude ever lmao
B I T C H
Ion think Todd died like that lol
Damn he looks good in the Cop costume
This is some kind of blasphemy lol
He managed to capture Gus’ entire persona and demeanor with just that one line
please do one on bojack horseman
‘i’m mentally ill. i’m literally not going to last much longer-‘ ‘nah you’re good’  *school.jpg*
This is absolute art, god bless
I just finished the show, and this is so accurate
PIEOLIGY AYYYYYE
I just finished season one... Just in time!
0:53 TURNS ON CASUAL SPONGE-BOB PARTY MUSIC
Cool meth for me  *NOTHING WILL GO WRONG*
2:33
lmao why is sneako here
Music at 1:13?
This is better than Metastasis
anthpo, you did a horrible job, where is the fly?
Oh man, he sure says b*tch a lot.
what's the song at 1:20?
i mean basically
This is hilarious
THIS IS SO ACCURATE
they should turn this into an actual series
do the sopranos
Um is the video supposed to be just a black screen or is there something wrong with my iPad??
I still can’t convince myself to hate tod, as much as I should
Is that SNEAKO
todd was never shot tho
Skinny Pete had me dead🤣
The fact that Skinny Pete is just Anthony but  t h i n  is basically canon
El mejor video            De la vida ❤xdd
jeser where is the methè
Damn that methlamine joku was nasty
How can you upload the whole show directly on Youtube without your account being taken down?
Mmmmm that Gus impression was amazing
dam what a secksy man in that costum 😳😳😳😳😳
this was amazing
100% on the Jessie recast.
Imagine do this on red dead redemption 2. I know its a game but it will be 2 minute video of dutch said "I HAVE A PLAN" and every time after that they show one gang member getting shot. Btw i love rdr2
noo where is disabled fat man
They missed the part where they went to mosque
Yo they got Toby in dis?
This was so good wtf
ooooo almost had it, the ending killed it
"Yo Mr White" "Yeah?" " *Bitch* "
I like how they forgot the second girlfriend as well as combo Edit: they also put the pizza scene after Guses death
"What do you methla-mean, Bitch?"  lmao
The whatcha say part made me actually die!
Is that Polyphia at 1:35?
Yo 1:35 is that berk opening 🤔
this sums up the whole series
I don't know how to say it but the pizza's scene iz the exact same thing
lmao just lmao
0:50 - my last 2 brain cells turning up to work on a Monday
Most popular lines: I did this for my family Skyler! Jesse! Bitch! Walter will u tell me what's going on They are minerals
jimothy
lol I caught that Berserk Music
Very hoy
how about "every episode of regular show"
No scene of walt jr asking for breakfast 0/10
I fock this video
+ wanna cook crystal meth? - shut up nerd + okay - okay
jeSsEr: hey yo mr white hEinVerSerG: what's up jeSsEr: b*tch  *wow, that was so powerful*
“Pizza time. Nooooo” nice reference
that guy did a funny impression
this is nothing like breaking bad
Toborwitz
The dear sister reference at 2:42 MMM
every episode of sons of anarchy!!! :D
1:31 Yo please give me song name 🥺
Bro he just broke bad
Respect for using Berserk 2016 opening at 1:35.
I saw sneako I click
I cant even tell you how much i hate this sound 0:57
Jesser where is the cokanier
this was so good!
Well we now need a part two
Minecraft editing is a cherry on the top 😂😂
I really wish that actually happened to Todd
Saul Goodman's phone being a shoe >>>>>>>
I’ve never seen breaking bad but now I feel like I have
Sneako is fucking perfect as Gus
No one ever mentions how Huel was reasonably happy
0:50 I like how badger has the skyrim bear sound effect for a voice lol
not accurate, not funny and gay
Man so many dislikes you must've angered the meth community.
BRUH! This was EPIC. 1 LIKE is given to you in these trying times.  Thx for the lol.
You forgot when Walt dies
You're so cool laundering my money right ?
Anybody else  this Jesse?
I've never watched this but I'm gonna assume its correct nice
Im on season 3 and this is funi
This vid made me want to watch breaking bad after 1 min of watching, now, one month later, I've watched the entire show and I can finally watch this video
every episode of steven universe plz
SKINNY PETE WND BADGERBDJDB
SpOiLeR aLeRt
why does your friend play jesse so well it's scary
Don’t worry, you didn’t ruin the show for me...     You made it so much better.
El xellar ve esto y se emperra
The way todd falls over is priceless
#SpookyScarySunday
This is genius! :)
so shrexy
Ruining the show?! Dude, you just made me appreciate it even more!
My disappointment is immeasurable. No Walt junior eating breakfast and no walter killing a fly.
Id give you a 10
B*tch
THIS IS COMEDY GOLD .
YYYOOOOOOOOOOOO SNEAKO
I just realized that Mr.White *is* white
We need an Every episode of Community
Make every episode of Glee
While I am watching this, it is at 666k views.
Next we need every episode of jimmy neutron
Haha, this is hilarious! Great video!  I literally finished watching Breaking Bad a couple of weeks ago and just uploaded a video sharing my thoughts on the show. If you'd like to check it out, that'd be amazing. I'd love your feedback! But if not, no worries. Keep up the great work!
do "Every Episode of Dexter"
Breaking Bad, Sweded
Why are jesse black?!?!?!?
0:12 Is no one going to talk about the cops wearing skirts?
the guy playing Jesse can do some really good impressions damn
ayooooooooooo that fold at 2:46 was perfect
Hmmm needs a splash of autism to enhance the flavour of the memes.  Nah but cereal this is funny as heck dude. Like the work :P
No No No No, You didn’t ruin it.......                           You made it better than it already was
this is the moment anthpo became heisnberrg
That's not Jesse he didn't say yo
Watched this while drinking tea from a breaking bad methalamine cup
Just finished watching this masterpiece
I never got the chance to watch Breaking Bad, but now I don’t think I need to.
pleasure doing business pleasure doing business
WHERE ARE THE BIKERS TODD DIDNT DIE ALONE
This video is fucking perfect
2/10, no shocked walter
this is a masterpiece
Pleaze do karate kid next
Name's Todd! Heard you guys need methylamine! What you you methyla-mean? _...Bitch._
i don't wanna kill the vibe, but that's not every episode, that is literally just a summary of the whole series
This is the best thing i have ever seen yet making sense
Xd
As someone who has never seen breaking bad I can confirm this is what breaking bad is like
He forgot to mention when Walt junior wanted the different kind of rasin bran
"what do you methylamine...     bitch"
*Masterpeace*
You see, I wanted to rewatch Breaking Bad because it was awesome, but you just let me relive the entire show in three minutes.
Sneako as Jessie perfect casting
"I'm mentally ill bitch"
The guy who plays Jesse and Gus is funny! XD
You know the feeeling you get after watching Breaking Bad for the first time?I got the same feeling while watching this.                    and that’s a good thing!
This was very accurate, except for the ending
I love how the "Bitch this sucks" line encapsulated Seasons 3 and 4.
I can't stop laughing 😂😂😂😂
Exquisite pizza throw
The “bitch” was on point every time, respect.
How dare you honor Todd with Baby Blue
“What do you meta-la-mean?” Greatest Breaking Bad pun ever
the "What do you meth" part was my favorite part of the entire Breaking Bad show.
Secsy in COP costumr
Man you litterally made the best show become the worst 😂
The fact that the "Whaddyu methla-mean?"  joke actually got me! XD I'm mentally more child than I previously thought
*Sees thumbnail:* Hey that looks like Sneako  *Clicks on video:* Hey! Sneako!!
Hey brother, you should do all the episodes of the gravity falls series, it sure would look great, by the way good video keep it up
0/10 gus wasnt wearing a black suit
SNEAKO Edit: And Toby?!
how did i not even notice you were from the house nobody asked for until toby came in
Todd doesn't get shot tho
As someone who has NEVER seen an episode of breaking bad this seems accurate
2:32 amazing cameo by toby
the only thing missing to complete the video was Walter junior eating breakfast, the "WHERE IS THE MONEY SKYLER" scene and walter saying every 30 seconds "i did this ... for my family"
The baby blue playing at the end... IMMACULATE
He should do every episode of naruto, that would be so funny.
Man how could they miss out on the fly episode in this
You gotta do Game of Thrones
The only thing I learned from this video is to not shoot kids
What do you methla " mean ".. haha good one.
"I rat US out to the DEA" Walter: oh :(
this dude is to epic for this platfform to fully apricate him
Children are exp Adults are ragdolls
Where's Mike??? Hahaha
This is so goooood anyone know the editing software he uses ?
i still can't believe i started watching breaking bad cuz of this video
Very accurate
Fuck yeah, now I don't have to watch Breaking Bad.
wtf did i just watch 💀 beautiful
That gmod death got me bro😂😂😂
Mr wheit whr is my 20003 km/hr of meth
You forgot the most important character: Walt Jr
Every teenage girl “im mentally ill bitch”
Mr white i require methe
2:59  can’t I’m underage
Where’s uncle Jack?
I see no difference      U fucin liars
Jessae īm fúcking homeless

You should do every episode of parks and recreation
Appa looking like a sna... wait, wrong video
This was HILARIOUS
0:17  smh You just reposted a whole fight scene from the show.
Is are school hee hee over? Waaaa
Skylar was perfect.
*what do you methla-MEAN? b*tch*  thank you for making me wheeze with unending laughter
Okay this is so fucking funny and accurate
“i’m mentally ill i can’t-“  *”no you’re good”*
I've never watched breaking bad so this is even worse of a rollercoaster without context
The chowder video has 74k likes.
i got the plot of the entire show from this
It’s the dude from tik tok
that shot of Gus without half a face always felt so oddly  disturbing and like it came from another tv show lol
that shot of Gus without half a face always felt so oddly disturbing and like it came from another tv show lol

TIGHT, TIGHT, TIGHT!
do darling in the franxx
You know as a kid my parents watched this and I never payed attention and I tell everyone yeah I basically know the whole show this helps my fat life lie even more
i saw toborwitz from tiktok

It’s the Jessie “yo mr white!” “bitch” impressions for me
I started watching breaking bad and ATLA  because of anthpo's vids. Thanks dude.
So I guess this is my life now.
He knows sneako ?????
This isn't in chronological order bruh
The legend of korra like this guy's
I like the part where Jesse said bitch
Omg sneako 💦
POV: hitting the næ næ
Yeah, pretty much
He literally condensed seasons 2-4 into like 10 seconds and I don't know if I should be disappointed or impressed
It's me gus :D

The fact that it ends with todd’s death makes it so much better
It's ok anthpo you may have ruined the show but pyrocynical did it first
why did i waste days of my life when i could just watch this
2:06 why is there a cat on the wheelchair ringing the bell?
Jesse wheres the cocainer?
The Minecraft door sounds were the best
Truly amazing

My dad was a fan of Breaking Bad
The minecraft doors i cant- LMFAO
0:46 bruh he nailed jesse's tone and voice
Jesse, where is the cocainer
My man just uploaded all of breaking bad thinking we wouldn't notice
Pls make an every episode of South Park
I like how Todd replaces Walter for the last shot of Breaking Bad in this video
make a parody of ddlc that would be hella funny to see a jacked monika
I haven't watched this show, but after seeing this i don't think i need to
I love how his kids aren't even mentioned and skyler is shown once
of course toby was todd
Ufunny Unoriginal Unsatisfying  BAD!!!
Lmao this was amazing

Olmost perfect exept jesus marie this is minerals
Was not expecting to see sneako here
Mike?
Bro spoilers

God I WISH it ended like that
We need legend of korra
I loved the monotone tone of this episode. Breaking Bad is my favorite show ever. And you guys did it justice.
Can you máké legend of korra now
This new guy kinda looks like sneako lol
Thought I was having a stroke when I saw sneako  in the thumbnail
I want to see him do Tuxedo Mask and Sailor moon... lol 😂😅
I'm so upset you forgot about combo.
This is like my tenth time watching and I just now noticed that Saul's phone was a croc
i was worried i thought he'll throw the pizza like walter
More Gus scenes
Haha lol

Maybe try Percy Jackson series?  Just a suggestion
I feel like I’m caught up with the show again , thank you
I mean...they’re not wrong..
heres a bunch of money dont do drugs alright bet LMAO
Sneako sneaking in other channels
Three minutes of my life I unfortunately will never get back. Worst video I have ever seen. -Karma
Someone snuck in the Berserk 2016 music, but all of these guys are so weird idk who it was.
Only part missing is Walt asking Jesse where the cocainer is
I did not get your video, at first. I got the entire 5 seasons downloaded. Just now I finished watching and now I get it!
SNEAKOOOO
SNeAKO!!!

This is an amazing video
the guy who's portraying Mr. white lowkey looks like the portuguese writer called Fernado Pessoa.
This is so funny
“Sorry for ruining this show.”  No, no....you made it better, trust me
Next up is every episode of Money Heist
Who here just here really likes breaking bad and has seen it like a billion times?
Drug.
idk why ive watched this 6 times in the last week
Imagine if he does victorious..
Can you please do every episode of how I met your mother?
oh rayos no me aparecio en recomendaciones :c
The pizza throw literally made me laugh out loud.
Wha... was that... Berserk music I hear? Please take my money and time.
Disappointed, needs more bitch, bitch.
Just saying this and putting it out there but I wouldn't be upset if anthpo watched the entirety of the Garfield Show, the best anime of all time Just saying
I loved it.
*Beach* XD
I really just went and watched the whole show to watch this video
When Better Call Saul is done, you should “every episode of better call saul”
I’m such a huge fan of breaking bad, and I love seeing it be memed
ayyo mista white! what up?  *BITCH*
SKINNY PETE
Was not expecting the Berserk music
Pieology was a good choice. 10/10
I am sure they went back for that pizza and shared it
0:13 The comment section whenever something remotely to do with politics is mentioned
Ha ha badger cracked me up 🤣🤣
I was laughing I don’t even know what’s going on

This is so accurate tho
Breaking bad but jesse is black
i like how you got lazy at the end and finished season 5 in 12 seconds

Info on the song playing at 1:35 ?
This is ART
The sfxs alone bring back so many memories
2:52 no ur not >:(                                Liar
I can't believe this masterpiece is only 3 minutes long 🤣
can't wait for the game of thrones one
"🅱️itch" "Yeah?"
Sneako shut up
2:58 ... No, I dont think I will
2:53 ... you better be! it was cute
ok
You know, I opened up YouTube to look up how to get into Mr. Freeze's lair in Batman Arkham City but then I saw this in my feed so I said fuck it.
Anthony YouTube pfp has potential to have a background

2:24 as italian , I'm happy that no pizza got wasted to make this video
0:50 skinny pete has moves
Better than the original
Ah what a classic 👌
Thanks for the spoiler 😂😂😂😂😂 Shit was so accurate
2:01 the best Latin imitation
It's me! Gus 😂
Janeeee lololol
"oo what you sayyy"
I'm mentally ill bitch I'm dying
That pizza moment is literally iconic
I actually laughed out loud bro,  no one really watches this around this time tho sadly
a sneako feature 😭😭 the simulation is fr glitching
great fucking video
wAIT when they die ?
Coock more of this blue stuff! *blows everything up* Pleasure doing business! Pleasure doing business!
Jesus fucking christ
Not a single scene where Walt Junior is eating breakfast. My dissapointment is immesurable and my day is ruined
this is definitely when saul became gus.
OMG, having watched the whole series I think I was able to fully appreciate this video. Very good, my friend
This is a good idea for a show, AMC should do it.
Anthpo pls rail me while in a cop costume ty.
Seeing my man be at 1M after watching him on 1MTS in the beginning is so fuckin cool
Mr. White was Breaking Bad all along.
PLS WTF IS THIS IM BUILDING A DRESSER SSHHFAD
Look man, I hate to be that guy. But the pizza throwing happened way before the money-laundering did.
Hol up don't think i didn't notice the 2016 berserk opening in there.
Dumb video
“Don’t shoot kids bitch!”
I love how you didn’t even bother to try and hide the mics 😆
So first it was Caroline and now its sneako Its like anime crossover
2:12 YESH!!!! YESHHH! THEY DID IT!!!!!! HUMANITY'S SANE-NESS HAS BEEN RESTORED!!!!! MOWOHOHAHAHHAHAHA!!!!! pIzZa tImE.
I require methe
Ok why tf is no one talking about the fact that sneako was in this video???
JAJAJAJJAJAAJJA
Mmm sounds about right
Does anyone else watch these videos but not the actual shows
B-bu-but where's the breakfast? And Skylar saying she 💥 Ted
Sneako is the perfect fit
Aight bet was the one for me lmaooooooooooo
Holy shit it’s Sneaker
Hi
Awesome! Hahahaha.
The acting in this was absolutely impressive!
I like that every episode was the whole series according to this 😭😭😂😂😂
“What do you methlya mean? B****!” 😂😂😂
HE IS THE ONE WHO KNOCKS
I didn't even know Sneako was in this when I saw him as Jessie I lost my shit for a moment and dropped my phone and had to rewind it just to check if my eyes deceived me lol
#FREEVILTWIN
I feel like a better title would be breaking bad in a nutshell
“Im- im mentally ill, b*tch”
That quote of thelonelyisland tho
Yes
How Breaking Bad really should've ended, clearly
How is it legal to upload on YouTube an entire, non edited TV show?? Have fun getting demonetized
I absolutely loved this! 😂😂😂
I love that the door sound effects are minecraft doors
Im mentally ill bitch
How I met your mother, please!
I LOVE THIS
This channel should get copystriked for re-uploading every episode of Breaking Bad
Sekcy
This is just the series in a nutshell
What do you methylaMEAN?
Way better then I expected
I feel like this is what you get when you ask AI to watch breaking bad and it has to create a simplified version
You didn't ruin it you elevated it to a new height
This is the best video YouTube has recommended to me in so long.
Cook meth for me.  Nothing will go wrong.  🤔 You know he's not wrong, if all Walt did was cook everything would have been gravy train with biscuit wheels.
Pretty accurate
Try making "scaring students as doomguy"
100%
Fun fuct: Jesse said bitch 54 times in the series
I’m super disappointed... that you didn’t add mike to this
Never expected SNEAKO to be in this
I have never ssen Breaking Bad, now I will go watch it thank you anthony
Ruining the show? For god's sakes are you Vince Gilligan?
U just killed toph
U killed toph bro
I thought that was sneako for a second... it’s just Jessie tho
SNEAKO
where is the cocainer
It's 4 am, i am drunk and i am watching this wtf
WHAT DO U METHYLA-MEAN,,, ,                              BITCH? **background clapping**
second one second 11111!1!1!1!1!1
Never watch breaking bad but now I know all about it.
1:36 I'm trying to remember what game that song is from Might be something Tales of related.
jesse i have no money for fuckijg bills and steam sales
wait, the title says every episode but this is only like half, are they gonna do more?
1:42 "I'm mentally ill bitch" hits hard
SKINNY PETE DANCING AT 1:00 HAD ME DEAD
"Ok"
this is too accurate, and i never have seen breaking bad
Sounds qbout right
this is the greatest video i’ve ever watche
What's the name of the song at the end? I can't remember for the life of me.
What do you methamean?
Walt did see Jessie as a son, that’s why he ruined his life
Walter Weight
the part with jesse in the hospital was hysterical
jesse: exists hank: 9MM PARABELLUM BULLET - INFERNO
These Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion mods are getting out of hand...
Daamn anthpo looks THICC on that cop outfit
2:25 Perfection
Simultaneously the most accurate and least accurate depiction of the show I’ve ever seen.
Zorman en inglés xd
todd just didn’t die tho
WE NEED MORE SNEAKO ANTHPO COLLABS PLEASE THIS IS THE BEST THING THATS HAPPENED TO ME IN MONTHS
Loved Gus impersonation, almost real
nah its cool, ive watched the  show waay too many times lol
best acting ever bro
SNEAKO and anthpo holy shitttp
That Gus impression was ON POINT tho  Edit: Holy shit guys thanks for all the likes :D
its beutiful ;-;
I'm too lazy to watch the actual one... Plus this one is better.
Guess I got.. what I DESERVED..
Don’t drink and drive! But if you do BETTER CALL SAUL!🍻🍻🍻
Sneako Playing Jesse is one of the best things on Earth
Ok
I actually can' t believe that they convinced vince giligan and the team to remake the whole thing!
Why does this not have the same amount of likes as views?
"I'm mentally ill bitch; I'm dying!'
Say my tax returns
I am tax returns
remember my tax returns
😂😂😂😂😂😂
'I'm mentally ill bitch, I'm dying.' lol
cook meth for me NOTHING WILL GO WRONG
Lmao i feel like this video should’ve came out years ago
1:01 what a good reference
Amigo es muuuuy buenoooooooo, me duelen los pulmones de tanto reír
Came here as soon as I saw sneako
make El Camino please xD
Nah you're good lol I'm dying
SNEAKOOOOO YEAAAHHHH
Can you do this but with stranger things or Steven Universe😁
See gus fring in half  Omg😂😂😂😂
Pleasure doing business 😂😂😂
*Vince Gilligan left the chat*
This is the only ‘every episode of’ one I’ve watched where I have absolutely no background knowledge of the show at all but it’s still hilarious
This is what I watch when I don’t feel like watching the whole show
"bitch this sucks"
Or gossip girl
Do Jane the virgin
When a 9 year old gets a green screen
that was actually pretty accurate i don’t think i needed to waste 5 years of my life
I like how the show is like popping up again
Fat Tod was a different creature all together
You missed the bit where his kid is on crutches and barfs from tequila for no apparent reason
The good ending
It’s weird seeing SNEAKO play a character.
THAT GUS IMPRESSION GOD TIER
And the most lame video on YouTube award goes toooo
Thanks for the recap
Mt white.... i require methè
idk this walter guy seems kinda sus
What happened to Daphne Henry and Rahul 😭🙂
LOL GUS WAS ON POINT THO BRUH
you're about 10 years too late
Skinny pete on demon time the whole show
*and then they did drug*
Jesee whre is the cocainer?
Jesse: **breaks down the fundamentals as to why he cant go on anymore** Walter: "nah youre good. alright so heres the plan..."
LOL
Masterpiece
Wow this should been the original version
"I'm mentally ill, bitch"
when todd dies why did baby blue play lmao
I would love if they went to real locations and remade this video!
I like how Badger is literally a badger. lmao
my brain on how different the ending and post series would be if Jesse just shot Todd right there
This is terrible....TERRIBLY CREATIVE!   frigging hilarious.   well done team.
Damn this was funny
At least Todd dies early in this version
does anyone think he be looks kinda cute in that cop outfit tho
I love to see Breaking Bad being popular in meme culture again
P I Z Z A  T I M E
jesser where is the cocainer
2:34 best line
Thanks for catching me up on what I forgot
Ok
Walter Season1: Chemistry is the study of matter,but prefer to say chemistry is the study of change Walter Season5: I am the one who Knocks
honestly how it shouldve ended
Metastasis
Skinny pete be vibin
Lol the part where jesse does drugs is funny af
THE PIZZA SCENE HAD ME ROLLING😂😂😂😂
I recently finished watching Breaking Bad and I must say that minus the fly and Walter White Jr. eating breakfast this was pretty darn accurate
i thought it was gonna be like:  jesse: this is my girlfriend walter: haha, wait til i watch her die and do nothing about it
shneako
This is so irritating
This is dumb and so off point
I heard you got the pizza throw on your first take
Love this crossover
This is exactly how i remember it.....bitch
It’s like when you dream about your favorite show but it’s just not correct
Jesse: “Hey, this is my girlfriend.” Walt: “Ha ha, cool. Here’s a bag of money, don’t do drugs.” Jesse: Heroin time
This is like how youtube needs to be more like. Just creativity, humor and hey be funny.
I haven’t seen sneako in a minute
"Every episode" is really just a summary of the series
Gus was a character for a huge portion of the show, but he died in 2 seconds here lol
ive never seen the show and im so fucking confused
There are spoiler alerts and there are spoiler regrets.
Your accuracy is 99.1%
Walter didn't die it was Todd the whole time
1:35 that's the opening from berserk 2016 Huh
WHERE IS MAGNETS BITCHHH?
Just finished the show- can confirm this is accurate.
1:34 Damnit whats the song I think I recognize it from somewhere but I can't remember
every episode of bbc Sherlock!!!
Hi bro love your videos 😂
This is art.
"bEtTeR cAlL sAuL" lmfao
you know what this should have been it
Only clicked for sneako, cool video though bud
i feel like it would be funny if you did every episode of Hunter x Hunter
skinny pete 😂😂😂💀💀💀 I'm dead
I liked the video when I saw 'I'm sorry for running this show' 🤣🤣
Omg sneako!
the entire show is one weird summary ig
I love the dear sister reference.
God: You have three minutes to live Me:
Video: 1/10 Reason: No sad Walter
that ragdoll tho
I fucking died at the Minecraft door and the way he shut it.
Here before copy right strike
jesse you brun RV with the wrong ingredent@??
For a second there I thought I was watching the actual show.
Jesser where is the cocaine
hmmm whatcha sayy
Me: Mom can we have Breaking Bad? Mom: We have Breaking Bad at home  Breaking Bad at home:
Walter: "Jesse we need more money." Jesse: "Why dud- I'm mentally ill- bitch, I'm DYING" Walter: 👁👄👁
Bitch
Lets be honest, Anthpo’s content is kinda getting repetitive ngl...
Lol at sneako
I don’t know anything about breaking bad nor have a watch the episode of it but this seems strangely accurate
No wonder my dad liked this show
After saw this video i start to see breaking bad......and all is identical.
Yo can you do a cartoon review on Clone High?
Its me, Gus
Oh yes breaking bad at the height of its popularity 12 years later
The Garfield tie on Gus gave me a reason to live lol
Y’all got mf SNEAKO playing Jesse 🤣🤣 I’m dead
the happy ending
Please do one for supernatural!!
Do the walking dead next eenthpoe 😳
The only thing that would make this better is having Walt say “I did this...for my family” every 15 seconds.
Bruh, after like a whole minute watching I just realized Sneako's playing jesse
Bro that's so good
the berserk intro had me rolling
I finished Breaking Bad last night and this shows up in my recommended the day after. What a time to be alive
Ok...
no walt crying 0/10
AMC guys copied this video.
Can you do every episode of big bang theory pleeaase
"Now throw the pizza on the roof" "Naw man, I wanna eat that" "...we'll fix it in post."
The title should be "Breaking Bad in a nutshell"
This man shaved his head just to make this video
Anthpo in a cop outfit is pretty hot ngl
vince will be pround :)
Wish he had killed Todd that sooner.
breaking bald
**ahem**  *bitch*
Another day waiting on anthpo to do every episode of the boys
Honestly if you can't be bothered to watch 5 seasons this is kinda it
Todd: *Guess i got, what i deserveee*
Mm whatcha say Lolol
He missed the fly episode
Ahh, such an amazing show.
Stranger things next
La casa de papel plzzz 💯🖤
I lost my shit when Toborowitz showed up as todd
"Jesse, where is the cocainer"

I wish gus actually wore Garfield merch 😔
Please do one for Peaky Blinders im really curious to see it
Jesus where's the cocainer
Bruh moment 2.0
Breaking Bad but also Gen Z humor. I love it. Here I thought breaking Bad was mainly a millennial thing but a lot of other people seem to like this too.
Why are you here   Go drink your milk
The fact that you didn't include anything about "The Fly" bothers me to my core...
This is awfully bad
every episode of community?
Do Better Call Saul next!
Ok we need more every episodes of
The pose at 1:40 is so accurate lmaoo
I’m mentally ill, bitch
jesse you brun rv with the wrong ingredient
I’ve never seen the show, but I now know everything about it
u didnt finish it my dude :c
I've watched only this for the past 3 days
i can tell you the name of the song at moment 1:35 its inferno 9mm parabellum bullet
You need to make “every episode of death note”
He just wants another excuse to shave his head
Lol todd was perfectly cast
The fact SNEAKO is in this kills me.
I want this for Umbrella Academy
Loved it
DUDE SNEAKO IS IN THIS
Honestly the exploding Gus scene was masterfully done here, gave me chills
Game of Thrones next
thats not how it ends.
dont shoot kids
#Badger is killing me
Whwre was mike :(
Breaking bad is my favorite cooking show
why watching memes is making something revived?
Nice croc phone Saul
Fuck you and fuck this video. . . . . . . I was supposed to rewatch the entire series 5 months from now, now I have to thank you for bringing the entire Seasons 1-5 in a span of minutes.  Fuck you and thank you for this. +Sub
Please tell me I’m not the only one that can hear the Gumball theme on the outro music
the pizza throw must have taken so long to get exactly right
Breaking Crocs.
The ending is underrated lol
brooooo the michael jackson shirt in the girlfriend scene i'm dead
How it should’ve ended
You can't just upload every episode of breaking bad to the internet.      Psych.
You the best cop, not that that's hard to accomplish
The gus impression is actually gold
This just tells you How Good of a show Breaking Bad is Still talked about till this day!
I promise you didn’t ruin the show, you actually made it better and easier to understand 👏🏾
Masterpiece
woah didn’t expect to see toby
Laughed so many different times at this. Absolutely amazing work!!!
Took 7 years but it’s here
Exactly right
this ending is not the ending we had it but the ending we deserved it.
Oh my god that’s sneako
Did they really use the berserk 2016 theme
Dude reuploading an entire show is not cool bro come on man
This is so weirdly accurate that it hurts I watched this show for so long 😂
Eastern Russia says hi and are you still living in the tiktok house
this is the best Doritos chip that I’ve ever seen
Plz do lok
Just finished the las episode right now and this got recommended lol
My name is Gus, cook meth for me. Nothing will go wrong.
"im sorry for ruining this show"   *you mean making it 1000 times better*
Boy, I don't think you finished watching Breaking Bad!
i kinda like your buzzed hair better
you guys should watch haiykuu and then do one of these on it
He Improved the show 🔥 🔥
"B*tch" 😂
This is gold
u didn't ruin the show now i wanna watch it again
Wow two weeks ago i just start watch breaking bad
All we need is a Cailou parody to complete the Triforce of bald television
Just finished watching the series last night. This is waaaaayyyy too accurate.
sneako has no chill
I love it so much I watch it on repeat
Damn u be lookin fire in that cop outfit
Now I don't need to watch breaking bad anymore
I've never seen breaking bad, but this seems pretty accurate
Imagine watching this without knowing what happened in the show. Confusion
You forgot the parts where Walter yells at Jesse
Very Accurate ngl
"hey i heard u guys need methameen" "what do you metha-MEAN?"
im only on ep 3 s1 and this is all i needed to know about the show thank you
best thing ive ever watched ngl
This was great. You should do like every episode of classic Pokemon or Pokemon Sun and Moon or something
Is...is that Toby?
Why is this in my suggested videos?  Watching... 👀  Laughing the whole time!😂
that pizza bit was amazing😂
This is too good 😂❤️
But what about THE FLY?!
“We better call Saul.” Tell me a better line, I dare you.
Please GOT next🤣
so no one's gonna talk about the writing on the board “mitochondria = power house?” and “2+2=?”. while he's a chemistry teacher XD
Why is mvperry sneako danidev vaklisbum and more famous youtubers here the hell?
Plz do more vids with Sneako. That shit was funny as hell
Jesse, where is the cocainer?
This is more like the entire story
Do Narutoooooooooooooooooo

Holy shit, really?
I love the pizza part. 😂
I hope you make a part 2 i want to see how you interpret the ending
the minecraft doors really added a layer
I cant believe AMC turned this into a real show thats crazy
You should do a every episode of hannah montana
I think this Is a good and well-done *In a nutshell* video of Breaking Bad.  I didn't want to bother watching that series, anyway. Thanks for this!
0:53 only real ones know what song this is.
the way i did NOT see this collab coming wtf
That gus impression was accurate though
Better call Saul?????
2:46 best death of all time
WAIT A MINUTE You look like someone Are you Maurice? The destroyer??
Me who’s never watched breaking bad: 👁👄👁
toby is so perfect for todd
Breaking Bad? more like the untold story of how I dropped a Michael Jackson record down the stairs
What do you Methylamine?
johnmulaney
you have to do the rest.
Anthpo commits crimes and pretends to be walter
THIS IS SO GOOD
He do he kinda cute in that cop costume 🥵
I’m not gonna lie you did look pretty fine in the cop costume😳
This was relevant....a decade ago.
Jesse, you brun the rV wiht the wrong inrgredient???!!!
Okay
I didn’t know how much I needed this and until I got it
Funny. Laughed.
Yes.
0:31 that was so accurate lmao 💀
Damn. Anthpo lookin sexy in that Cop Costume
Omg sneako
Ruined ? You mean improved upon, right ?
jesser
I didn't know I needed this, but when I saw this it was like my life was fulfilled
Filthy show, I never watched one episode,  ever since I was scrolling through the channels and come upon the scene where he is fingerings a lady in classroom. Jesus christ,  that pornography not a televised show wtf. And shame on the actresses who throw out their morals to make a dollar!! Never get my view.
JESSEY!!!!
Thank you you saved me time of rewatching it for the 4th time
Forgot the plot, wanted to watch the show, watched this instead, it is now my favorite show
I want to compliment you on your cop costume, but you also look fine with those glasses. 😳😏
Production quality is on fleek
Imagine the ones who haven’t seen the show be so goddamn confused
you are crazy
U suck
Oh cool I literally just picked up the box set
THE SKINNY PETE AND BADGER PART I WHEEZED
Hot dayum
This is beautiful
I thought we said to shut up old man 😡😡😡
Yeah....
Most of this video is him going okay
"I'm mentally ill, I'm not gonna last--"  "No you're good"  That's literally the show
Faith alone saves you. Salvation is a free gift. When you believed you were sealed until the day of redemption .  Jesus died for our sins on the cross , was buried , and rose again on the third day and because of this you are saved.
Random people who like this will become millionaire someday
I haven't seen it but I'm pretty sure this is goes
omg i love this LOL
Do el camino
sneako sneako sneako sneako
I’m mentally I’ll bitch
Jesser we need the cocens
The 3rd Seal of the Apocalypse will break soon. Research it.
This is so wholesome
"Aw bitch i'm mentally ill"
Anthpo making another classic! Great video
Greatest scene in my opinion 1:16
Im considering every parody of you now canon
could have used more minerals
There is a skeleton for everything... basic ally LoL
wh...... was that ending part a hlvrai reference--
"Say my name." "Wh- I don't have a clue who you are." "Yes, you do. I'm the platypus. I'm the man who made a good live action Avatar." "Bullshit. No one can make a good live action Avatar." "You sure?" *nods from friends and subs* "Now, say my name." "You're anthpo." "You're goddamn right."
ayeee less go people are starting to watch breaking bad again
This is not how it ends
"Yo Mr. White" "What" "...." "Bitch"
1:21 I love i he tied it _below_ where he would inject himself.
Frick this spoiled everything to me
Yes. A good show.
Didn’t expect to watch this whole series again.
Skipped a lot but ok
Walter Black
Breaking Bad: "Jesse, we need a new distributor!" *They get a new distributor* *a few days/weeks pass* " *HE'S GOTTA GO* "
Inaccurate, why is the no walter jr eating breakfast?
Better then the actual breaking bad ngl
I havent watched the show but this makes no sense at all
My god this was so good I cried!  Subbed!
anthpo lookin pretty attractive in this cop umiform ngl
This dude is the love child of gokanaru and twomad.

As someone who has never watched BB, this is getting me interested
why is walter soo small xD
I swear the pizza throwing happeneded way before gus getting sploded. 0/10
hahah i like how sneako plays every race
Millennials think they know everything about a show they were too young to watch when it was on. Listen here you little crap eaters, breaking bad is awesome, family guy is funny, and tide pods arent food. Also, Miley Cyrus looks like a chipmunk
I mean, if my chemistry teacher made an argument like that, I would definitely stop being depressed to go cook meth with them.
the ending tho
What dobyou methlamean
What do you methilaMEAN beatch? xDDDDD
These are how many times Hank and Mari should be slapped in the face. 👇
These are how many times Hank and Mari should be slapped in the face. 👇
"What do you methyla-mean, bitch?"
These are how many times Hank and Mari should be slapped in the face. 👇
Guys .....                   We're all in danger
Bruh, the Gus impression sounded legit wtf
ANTHPO AND SNEAKO? OHMYGOOOOD
Literally all Jesse says: "Mr White, b**ch, I'm mentally ill"
The sopranos

If we learn anything from this show it's to not shoot kids
Gus: cook meth for me nothing will go wrong  Walt: yeah but im smarter than you
Mr Whote where is my 20003km/h of methè?
"don't shoot kids, bitch"
Bitch.  - Jesse Pinkman
Breaking bad in a nutshell pretty much lol

Breaking bad in a nutshell
He looks cute with long hair at 1:16 and you can't deny it
I thought this video was gonna make me wanna watch the show  but after this video I feel like I already watched the entire show
"Bitch I'm Dying."
The quality is truthfully exquisite
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved .  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117750/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_KttEFbESFBVEC
0:50 No one remembers Combo
Oh my
at least you apologised. But... I don't accept.
Judging by Jesse, the series was obviously adapted by Netflix
I’m glad anthpo and sneako found eachother
This was just beautiful... Just beautiful
Do Bojack Horsemen or Community
Jesse’s actor was honestly perfect
Soooo good
Man, this is very well done! Like they literally summed up the entire series in 3 minutes lmao 😂
Mr whote, whee is my 20003 km/h of methé???
"I set the meth on fire"  I lost it at that, and it only got better from there lol
accurate af
Do every episode of Pucca or bubble guppies
WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE
ladies and gentleman we have the new and improved breaking bad    also anthpo if this gets us more videos:  :shy-fingers: you looked great in the cop costume 😳
TRENDING!!!
Mexican jesse
You should do every episode of Death Note Like if you agree
Jesse looks EXACTLY like in the series
Vince Gilligan’s been pretty quiet since this dropped
oh god if only it ended that way lol
Why sneako of all people..
1:35 bruh that berserk opening
sneako has top tier acting but its so weird that hes not talking about dEep StUfF
Now I don't have to watch the whole series 😂
So is Antho just gonna shave his head every time he starts a series cause that's two in a row already. His method acting skills are impeccable.
LMAOOO todd: heard you guys need some methylamine jesse: What do you methylamean bitch
now better call saul :)
yall forgot about Combo..      having the pizza on the roof was necessary tho..
Shneakooo
Spoiler alert btw
jesse

"All stories are simple, it's how you tell them that makes them compelling"
Now do el Camino😂
Idk why I thought the title of the video was “every episode of baking bread”
Yo you can’t just pirate the entire show and post it online that’s illeagle
damn men in uniforms
A masterpiece.
Mr white, what's up with the hair loss?
Walter white: bombs tuco. Tuco: weird flex but ok.
Why wasn’t there an entire half hour of this video dedicated to killing a fly???????????
Just finished the show last night. Thank you for this 💀😭😂
I've never seen the show so I'm gonna take your word for it
Its so hard to not hate Pinkman

My man Saul literally used a Croc as a phone 😂😭
Legit the funniest YouTube comedy I’ve seen in years
sneako saying bitch is somehow soothing
You forgot Walt getting furious at Jesse always and Skyler getting more and more suspicious
I was gonna re-watch Breaking Bad...now I just did. Thanks.
"what do ya methylemean, bitch"  Bravo
“I’m mentally ill bitch” 😂😂
lmao, I was not expecting to hear the Berserk opening in the background
Why does Toby look so much like Todd wtf
Not finishing the other half of the vid until I am finished with the series
"Hey this is my (drug addicted) girlfriend" "Haha cool, here's a bag of money, don't do drugs" aye
If you want you can do every game of Among Us but you don’t gotta :)
If you want you can do every game of Among Us but you don’t gotta :)

Why the hell are their three youtubers in the comments lol
Exactly how I remember it
Yo you didn’t credit the badger

i should prolly finish this show before watching this but ight
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.   God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
From to harassing people with Fat Yoshi To 40 on trending. Congratulations Anthony..you really deserve it
The good ending
This was a stupid waste of time.
The guy who played Gus,  sounds like Gus.
But where is gustavo fingés 20003 km/h of methé
OMFG WOW MY TWO FAVORITE YOUTUBERS WATCH EACH OTHER ANTHPO AND LIAM THOMPSON ❤️
HOw to resume a show by: Anthpo
Snekooo 🖤
How many Anthpos are here?     Yes
Wow this is so me when I break bad
You know, anthpo looks pretty sexy in a cop costume ngl.
but for real though...the mitochondria IS the powerhouse of the cell...
Damn Anthpo really pulls off that cop outfit.
Finnaly breaking bad episodes for free
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos ♦️ Non-Duality
This is when you can see Anthpo become Heisenberg
Bro i watch all breaking bad in like 4 weeks, and now I can watch it in 3 minutes
NOOO THE WHEELCHAIR CAT
I saw sneako and was like   Wait this isn’t anthpo’s channel
Ayo misstah white
fckn love this
This was amazing
I searched “breaking bad” for no reason and I thought this is some ancient skit but this dropped not even a full day ago
Imagine showing this to a person who never saw the show...
I haven't seen the show but i feel like i don't have to now because i know literally everything that happens in full detail
😂💨
Is that SNEAKO
Don’t get copyrighted man
I see sneako I clicko
Breaking bad the anime  Now coming to hulu plus Bitch
He look good in dat cop costume doe
Why us there writen mitochondria thas biologie not chemistry
I see Sneako and Anthony together, I click
Well..somehow I made it a minute and a half through this abomination of what’s suppose to be a funny skit smh this was just honestly terrible. I’m about to stop looking through trending vids lol it’s always terrible “rap”music that all sounds exactly the same or garbage like this 👎👎👎
But the ending was wrong dude
when this is better than the actual show
Every episode of Family Guy?
this is Art i have never seen a better Video wow my Cancer is Gone i am cured of Illness you have given me Immortality Wow
Who needs Netflix when you got anthpo
Did sneako join thnaf? I deleted tiktok so I wouldn't know
He absorbs the kids experience
this is the collab i never knew i wanted. sneakpo
sisters veeries
0:57 "pleasure doing business" I already can't 😭😭
i love how the avatar series was quite accurate to the show but this is just. uh. something else :)
You just want an excuse to go bald again
Ahhhhh drug busts   Me too
pizza time
im so glad this popped up in my recomended
Yes epic
You look so good in a cop costume that even george floyd would be scared of you!
The fact that we're still talking about this show
"nah you're good"
Yo i thought you were a real police officer for a minute. That costume is dope.     Bitch.
You missed the part where uh... uh... uh... eyebrows?
masterpiece
Sneako and Anthpo!? This is fucking hot
breaking bald
im not paying for those
Whats this?!
Pls do every episode of power rangers
Nothing looks sexy in a cop costume, ugh
Brae kingbad
sneako as jesse is something i would have never thought of yet is so perfect
*na, you're good* 😂👌
*shutup nerd*
u having a laugh i only just got the notification for this
Anthpo lookin pretty good in that cop suit 👌
Anthpo looking dummy cute in that cop costume 😳😳
jëssé wehre is the coke coler
Yeah. It's perfect.
The BERSERK music xD
breaking bad But the budget was like 2 dollars
damn that cop suit makes you look thicccc
these videos are so good its ridiculous 😂
i didnt know toph was in breaking bad
has anyone else only seen up to the end of season 2 and just doesnt know what the rest of the video means
HEY GUYS... I THINK THAT MAN'S THE AVATAR.
Why is anthpo single ?
The cat bell thing cracked me up
Jesse ws spot on
Never seen the show. Now I don’t have to.
sneako and anthpo in one vid together? bruh... ❤️
Honestly by killing Todd immediately after he shot the kid you improved the shows sole issue
do the res plz
Did you just fucking manage to put the show on YouTube without getting copystriked?
Anthpo,,, you lookin kinda cute in that cop costume aha,, jkjk,,,, unless?
i love this
this did and didnt make sense
great show
Thank you Anthony ur content is amazing and I liv ot
Yeah you pretty much nailed everything on the head
Came from Sneakos story
white is sus
Bich
I watched this on my selfie stick
this guy is literally putting negative amounts of effort into his videos at this point
I thought Bryan Cranston was the best actor for Walter White......I was wrong
Shneakoooooo
0:15 looks like Homelander
Breaking bad is a show that will never get old lol
YES YES YES
I wish I could throw a pizza on a roof as good as Walter
Wow two shows in a row where he had to shave his head bald
Bad cop more like *baddddd* cop       I don't know why eitheir
breaking bald
Has no one noticed how sexy he looked in a cop costume
Not accurate. Walt didn't say "Jessie, we have to cook" every episode and they didn't ride the Meth Mobile to the underground Meth Cave.
this is fucking perfection.
wait wtf sneako is in this???
Disappointed not to see Mike
Hey wanna do crystal meth?  He said that way to casually
If Antpho doesn’t comment in Liams vid imma sue
Never even seen breaking bad but I can tell this is better than the actual show
You mean BIATCH!
I'm in class so imma quickly do my math here sry 16×10=160 16×6= 60+36=96+160=256
wow it’s sneako
Thanks their is not enough Breaking Bad videos out there.
Skyler is missing her cigarettes about 5 at once
Don’t shoot kids, bitch
NOT SKINNY PETE ABD BADGER
Sneako?????
Don’t shoot kids bitch  Words to live by
Great...
This man deserves an award of best acting and directing
Lol imagine them recording these
Mitochondria is the plural.  The correct statement is either: The mitochondrion is the powerhouse of the cell The mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell
Anthpo do look thicc in that cop costume
Oh fuck yeah
haha pizza go weeeeee
i don’t want breaking bad     I NEED KORRA
you should do gravity falis next
i have never seen a single episode of breaking bad i've never been more confused in my life
I've never seen Breaking Bad and now I don't think I need too. I now know everything.
*SAY MY NAME*
Naaa män u saved the show
Why so many verified comments
Mr whit where is my 20003 kph methamphetamine
jesse you brun Rv with the wrong ingredient
"What do you methlabmean ?"  Ded.
Wow sneako
that minecraft door gets better each time
ah yes, walter white's famous line: "pizza time". classic.
I've never watched braking bad but now I have no need to. Thanks 👍
That was a pretty good Gus impression
beter call saul is next
did not see this collab coming but it’s FIRE
The best crossover of all time??? 👀
Do the sopranos next
Jesse wheres the cocainer
Anthpo should do every episode of gravity falls
Was here for sneako 🙋🏻‍♂️
So...his girlfriend dies in every episode?
nice
half life sound was pree good
this was dope
AYYYY SNEAKOOOOOOO
Dude, make a video of every episode of cobra kai pleasee
very
“Bitch”-jessie
i thought that was my guy sneako in the thumbnail
Wonderful acting!
Love this stupid series. Do Prison Break or I will delete your channel
The fucking minecraft doors :DDDD
Jesse we need to make el cracke
pls make for ozark :D also with sneako cause sneako is cool
Can you do the thing where it’s only you. Not that I don’t like the people you film with I just think it’s funnier when it’s just you
wait you DON’T play every character?!
why is there one student in his class just standing one a stool
I just finished watching the show wtf
Me watching this before I even started the first episode of the show liek👁👄👁🧍🏻‍♀️
this is the moment when anthpo became anthrax... wait
Anthpo is lit fam
KKKKKKKK WTF
It’s sounds like something Pamtri would make
Could you do FRIENDS next it would be hilarious
It’d be funny if you did Every Episode of Stranger Things like so Anthony can see
Very
but where is ''say my name'' ?????
Bro the way the badge amplifies your pecs, so sexy bro
but where is ''say my name'' ?????
This accurate and I love it
Can you please do "Every episode in stranger things"
Bitch
This is amazingly accurate anthpo!
just trying to get the most out of being bald
So he was willing to shave his head to play Aang but refuses to shave it to play Walter White
You got me when I saw the "mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell" on the board
And that's what happened
this is the worst video you ever made
i dont even watch breaking bad but i loved this
Felt much longer than 3 minutes
ive never watched the show but i think this is all i need to know
2:12 "pizza time"          "no"  Such saddest moments on tv
This is a man of culture
SNEAKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I miss some voice phone records
Careful now, you might get copyright striked
I know the song from 1:34 to 1:36 but i cant fucking remember the name and its driving me insane
Dude I’ve been bingeing this show for the first time and I just saw the train heist last night. This video couldn’t have come at a better time
Lost it when badger roared like a bear
I love how theres a hospital machine thinggy sfx when theyre literally in the middle of a desert
Ugh! Spoilers!!!
This is not every episode. This is the entire series.
this man should be in literally every show ever and everyone would like it  change my mind
Baking Bread
was that the fucking opening of Berserk '16 I heard there
Last kill was half life SFX pretty good
did he actually shot a kid?
I bet shaving head for ATLA is paying of by being able to act bald cool characters and being disabled in general.  *Ba-dum-tss*
1:35 i heard berserk 😳
I think what do you methyla-mean will go down as one of the greatest jokes ever told, bitch.
You know its illegal to upload episodes from the show?
Accuracy went from avatar 100% straight down to about a 35% hahahha
Hmm yes very very accurate from what I saw from the movie
As someone who's never seen the show and doesn't want to, I can safely say this is 10000% better 👌
i like how he couldnt waste the pizza
1:38 9 mm parabellum bullet
It deserves to be on trend😭😭
Yo wtf is Sneako doing here lmao
U should do gravity falls :3
I’ve seen the show, this is accurate
Los Pollos Hermanos is the best fast food chain, you can't change my mind
So to play hank you somehow became even more bald
i’ve never watched breaking bad but i don’t think i need to anymore
So Aang has been Heisenberg all along? 😳
K
Cancelled my netflix subscription. I’ll just wait for ur vids.
Jesee whre is the cocainer
WHERE IS MIKE ?!!!
damn wtf. didn't expect sneako here
I got in halfway through and got lazy but wanted to finish it . Now this is the answer
I would have watch the whole video but I am watching the whole series so
I just rewatch a month ago why is it everywhere all of a sudden i see new memes of the show everywhere
this is breaking good
Pls do Friends
I like that Mr. White is shorter than Jesse. Looks better that way.
Dude you didn’t include my man mike. I’m disappointed by you
Wow so acurrate
Fucking Meth Damon
This is the moment Warlt became heysenburger
Funny Cause I just finished BrBa over the weekend
Thanks for including Baby Blue. :")
That pizza throw killed me,
Pls do every episode of Criminal Minds
Don’t forget about the entirety of one episode was about killing a fly
You should do Every Movie of the Sam Raimi Spider Man Trilogy
Badger x breaking bad
Shit bro, you made me watch Avatar now I need to watch BB??
Jesse where's the cocainer!?
Very accurate, but it lacked the overly artsy introduction shots
Bad breaking
why is this so good
1:37 berserk opening music?
What the fuck is Sneako doing here
2:42 "my names not shane kid"
Can you do El Camino next 😭
" Nah, you're good "  - Walter White, Breaking bad 2007
Ngl Bro. You Look Amazing In A Cop Costume, Btw Could U Do Chowder Next?
Omg
My friend never watched a breaking bad episode, and didn’t want to watch it for such a long time, so I showed him this…
Jesser you brun rv with wrong ingredient?
spoiler alert in the beginning needed for the ones havent watched lol
This beautifully captured the show honestly brought tears to my eyes
EVERY EPISODE OF TOP GEAR PLEASE ANTHPO
"Don't shoot kids bitch" at least it ends happily.
I think we need better call Saul and el Camino
Guess I don’t need to see Breaking Bad anymore. Thank you? I don’t really know
No you are not sexy in cop costume
Hahaha 😂 I love this
My favorite character is the old dude on the wheelchair
Damnit you spoiled child killers death I haven’t gotten to that part yet what have you done I was not told there would be spoilers wtf why wouldn’t you tell me you have ruined this show for me forever agent P we have heard heisenberg is at it again wait no stop please i want to die oh wait just like child killer oh yeah I can’t believe you spoiled this show for me what is wrong with you do you just want to remove all of my happiness or something
THIS WAS ONLY HALF
"Hey, wanna cook crystal meth ?" "Shut up nerd." "Ok." "Ok."  *The negociations were short*
How to cover every major plot moment of breaking bad in 5 minutes or less
Never seen a single episode of breaking bad. I want to say thank you for this and it is probably better than the actual show XD
I’ve never seen the show and I’m extremely confused
1:44 me whenever my mom asks me to do anything
AYO ITS SNEAKO
Do every episode of cobra Kai
2:33 the true crime was that Vince Gilligan didn't use this in the actual show
Skylar was on point
thats the momento when walart whiter becam heineken
Anthpo is the one who knocks
The person that thought of "what do you methyla mean" deserves a raise and a pat on the shoulder
I love breaking bad so much I’ve watched it like 3 times I’m so happy you made this
anthony looks so sekis in a cop costumme
jesse where is the cocainer
Should’ve done all the parts yourself. Really dropped the ball casting your friend as Jesse. Dude is terrible... even ironically.
Pizza time
Do better call saul next! It would be fun watching you do saul!
Aight, bet.
🙌
every episode of clone wars
ok
ok
Dammit it's too accurate
anthpo actually looking mega swaggy with a goatee ngl
Where is the most important moment when mr.white says "say my name"
Nice
Acab
Ive been playing half life 2 for the first time and when todd died, i felt that 😔
Haven't seen Breaking Bad but this caught my attention
I am watching this before watching breaking bad so i get spoilers.
This is pure artistry. A true masterpiece.
SNEAKOOOO YESSSSSSSS
The pizza thing - 10/10
That  pizza looked thic
not not very sexy at all i might hav made it this far in the video this isn't meant to be funny i just feel like the way i was told to comment was a good one but i hav nothing to say so *_______________*
I love the TO GO videos now i don’t need to see all these episodes
never watched the show but this is probably accurate
My dad sent me this
Breaking Bad in 3 minutes
Do every episode of Better Call Saul
jesse wheres my cocainer
Never seen it, and don’t want to,this is obviously superior
I love that they didn’t waste the pizza
Ok     I love this
THAT WAS FUCKING GREAT
Anthpo lookin mad fine in a cop costume 😳🥵
I know nothing about this show and I am highly confused
legit how the fucking show goes down
that "nothing will go wrong" sounded on point
SNEAKOOOP
Nice to see Sneako here. I remember the Breaking Bad poster in his room.
This is amazing man
Can't believe Toby is in this lmao
You should do Legend of Korra after this
The "umm watcha sayy" at 2:42💀💀💀💀💀
Love the sneako feature
How i Met you mother plssssssss
well you forget the rest of the show dude
let's get top gear next
THANK YOU
sneako
I never watched Breaking Bad except for that 'Pizza Time' scene so uh, thanks for filling me in Anthpo XD
- "Name's Todd, heard you guys need  methylamine" - "What do you methyla-mean?" LMAO
You didn't ruin it, now I never have to watch this show.
anthpo u rule my world in a cop costume
😳
I cannot describe how much I love seeing you literally drag these shows for FILTH lmao, your editing is top tier
The Heisenberg is now Anthpo
Bruh SNEAKO????
Ok
Bitch
Where the hell is Walter White Jr. asking for breakfast? And the lady who loved purple?
This should be called Breaking bad in 3 minutes
Okay this was hilarious
anpoht whér is me 20003/kbps of methef
*me squinting at the thumbnail to make sure I’m not going crazy seeing sneako in it*
Damn someone should make a show off this skit
Its not an "every episode" but more of a recap. Still love it. You should pair up with Oversimplified
Jesse, your meth is good
Right, I forgot the part of Breaking Bad where they closed and opened the doors without touching them and it became the inspiration for Minecraft doors
Yes
Thank you I cannot afford netflix but with a subscription to your channel it's basically the same :')
wow the production was so good !!! must've been expensive to make, filming budget must've been crazy high !!!! as someone who's never seen this show before I bet this was totally 100% accurate and even better quality than the actual show 😎 plz keep making these skits lol
Lester < Saul
Yo anyhow you look pretty fiiiine in a cop costume also that pizza scene was spiiicy
white guy and his many philapino friends make hilarious video!
Just got into breaking bad less than a month ago and I’m currently on season 5. Was super hesitant on watching this video because I was afraid you were gonna spoil the ending lol but I love your videos so I had to see it. Lucky for me, you didn’t get too far!   Also, it’d be sweet if you did Better Call Saul if you watched the series!
there wasn’t enough bitches
okay
Best show ever     Bitch......
Omfg... Sneako? Lol wasn't expecting him in your content
I just got done with the series 5 minutes ago and this is perfect
I liked this one but tbh it’s lower cuality compared to the avatar ones
Show this to Vince Gilligan he needs some tips
Wer is the methe jesser
SNEAKO and anthpo is the most powerful and simultaneously dangerous duo on the planet.
Fixing good
5 hours isnt that early. But it's kinda early                 Oh hey you opened it all the way :D
Song at 1:35 is the opening to berserk 2016.....figured someone would want it.
ayyy skinny pete 💕😎
Ok
that's exactly how it went down
I started watching and I’m on season 3
You were in a cop costume?
Me never watched Breaking bad   Also me watches this:
This collab though
Guess I gotta watch the actual show now
Okay now make part 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49, and 50. You have a lot of ground to cover (specifically the geodes)
ThAnk you anthpo, for everything
My dad watched this show so I wanna show him this
how did you screen record Netflix?
Say my name......... Perry the fuckin Platypus
honestly this kind of wants me to watch this show
Why the fuck is sneako here

Jesse: Makes some horrible choices that get him and Walt nearly killed  Walt: *You’re like a son to me*
Wow sneako in an anthpo vid 😍
I don't even know what is this 👁👄👁
As a person who has never seen the show, I claim this as a worthy musical.
For a person who has never watched breaking bad, this is amazing
This doesn’t change the fact that Walter White is a simp.
if he’s bald... Anthony will play him.
B I T C H
It’s a good show
Omg i love sneako

Actually the show.
Absolutely jazzed that I don't actually have to watch the show now
Yes yes yes bb ftw

1:26 song?
Next every episode pf community!
Well at Least he got Baby Blue right.
I just finished breaking bad and you made a parody, now that I understand the context this is even more hilarious.
This is so great!! You should totally do one about criminal minds!!
the true alternative ending finally leaked all these years
Walter teaches his son driving. He gets pissed off after sometime. It's because junior was . .  brrrrrrrrr brrrrrrrrrrr brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Tisss!!!!!!!! . . *BRAKING BAD*
Anthpo looks way more like Jesse tho
Jesse: sets meth on fire, snitch to the dea, got the cartel on them Walter: your like a son to me
This is especially freaky as I’m currently rewatching the show for the 4th time... also pls do better call Saul next
Wtf Is sneako doing in here
I’ve never seen a sexier man in a cop costume
bruh anthpo gonna make me act up when he puts on that cop costume
my guy lookin fresh in the cop outfit 😳😍😳
*Bitch* lol

anthpo ft sneako is probably the best collab in 2020 so far
I love how Walter Jr is completely ignored along with Holly. So when’s pt 2
Living in Albuquerque and going anywhere out of state, people just be like yo  B R E A K I N G B A D.

Wow, just like how I remember.
Yeah that was basically everything.
I’m watching all of his videos if you look hard you can see this
"Shut up old man!!"(anthpo 2020) But ye cool video
Ahahahhaha I knew it he's still bald
Jesse:I am mentally ill I won’t last for much longer Walter: Nah your good  Jesse: Ok
This made me laugh
Really hit us with the pizza time huh?
Antpo  You are the best YouTube or ever
Ur really milking the bald thing huh

bruh what is Toph doing here I thought they were helping the Avatar
I didn't believe my eyes, when I saw this video's thumbnail...! Sneako! :v
You would've looked better in a maid costume 😗✌

😂😂😂
BREAKING ANT
i love how they didn't want to waste a good pizza
The best part of this video hands down is sneako wearing a Garfield tie

I've never seen the show and I'm confused
Sad to hear the news about badger, he was a great businessman.
Imagine if Anthpo did a collab with Scott the Woz
The Minecraft door sound effects broke me.
yo who thinks he should do a “every episode of Naruto”😂😂
Pogchamp I've never watched any of the things you've dont this series on but I love all of them
This ain't breaking good ep 3, but it'll do
my biggest flex is i live where breaking bad was filmed thanks
The end?
Bro wtf I haven't watched this show since it originally aired and the other day I decided to rewatch it And then you upload this
The adventures of water and juice
"Nah you're good"
SKINNY PETE AND BADGER
EYYY SNEAKO!
/e salute
Anthpo should do every episode of JoJo’s bizarre adventure
Do every episode of fuller house ANTHPO PLEASE
Malardo
You have maybe like, a couple months to live.   *Ok*
YO SNEAKO
This is how the show should have ended.
We need an Every Episode of Johnny Test
oh my god finally breaking bad
*RUINING IT?????*
Sneako the best
Oh wow I knew a lot of verified YouTubers will be here
Since I’ve never seen the show, I think this is pretty accurate.
Never expected to see our boy Sneako here, man this just got like 100% better holy shit
i cant believe you actually got the original cast to film this
I've never watched Breaking Bad but I feel like I don't need to anymore.
Do the legend of Korea!!!!!
Anthpo: doing a recap of every franchise with a famous bald character ever
The minecraft door was great lol. But I was hoping for a classic Tuco line like “tight tight tight!!”
*I bet you that after filming this the cast got to eat that pizza thrown on the roof.*
Pretty good Gus impression, not gonna lie  Also, I'm surprised Toph could aim well enough to shoot someone
Mr ant where is my 20003 km/h of methé
jesser, distribuut the methé
Really taking advantage of the Avatar haircut
Yo ive been planning to watch it. Guess i already did
Never thought I would see this crossover
breaking bad in 3 minutes
I didn't know they were remaking Breaking Bad. This teaser looks nice 👌
You didn’t ruin it you just ruined that pizza 😭😭
Finally
My my your hot Mr.Anthpo
"Don't shoot kids, bitch." - Jesse Pinkman, probably
this is the best youtube video i have ever watched
can you do stranger things
It’s literally Malcom in the Middle
I never ever thought sneako and anthpo would ever collaborate this is crazy
im genuinely confused i have never seen this show but what the heck
Haven't seen a ""HHm Watcha Say " meme in a while. Good Shit man
Where's Mike??????
Seems about right
Man I feel when the experince came out of the dead kid
Anthpo
b*tch **clapping intensifies**
Best one yet
Oh do I love a man in uniform 😍
I can't wait for Better Call Saul
That skeleton vfx was rad
Where's the fly at tho?
Sneako more like sneak
SNEAKO :0
as a cop you look like an instagram model
bald+breaking bad=*emotionless drug noises*
It fucking cracks me up seeing Todd take Walt's death.
Great now Toby reminds me to Todd.
Is that the boy sneako 👀👀
Yo fuck Todd....
Never watched the show before, but thank you Anthpo for showing me it in the best way possible
We went from ICarly, to The Office, to Diary of a Wimpy Kid, to Avatar, to fucking Breaking Bad... what a leap in tone and audience. It’s like going from Mario to Doom. And that’s why I fucking love this video
Pretty good bro
That ending is a much happier one then I expected
An unexpected gem
Can we get a better call saul
better then breaking bad
As someone who has never watched breaking bad what the fuck is going on
here to support the almighty
SHNEAKOOOO
Plz upload more
This is great.
Now do el Camino
Huh. Doesn't sound like a good show. :/
AYEEE SNEAKOOOOO
Ahyelo
anthony you made me 10x more gay than I already was in that costume and then you knocked me down about 5 notches with the mustache
Toby before his face got destroyed, and Anthpo before his hair grew out.  Was this plannedddddddd????
wowie]
WOAOAH IS THAT FUCKIN SNEAKO?!??
This is a chaotic, unexpected duo.😂
Sneako should be an actor
BITCH
Me: *Never seen it before*   Watches video: OH YEA TOTALLY HA HA
ANTHPO X SNEAKO POG CHAMP SWAG
ANTHPO X SNEAKO POG CHAMP SWAG
Jesse, where is the cocainer ?
Damn anthpo, you looking fine in that cop outfit, ahaha.
🤣🤣🤣
I’ve never seen this so I assume this is accurate
Wait...sneako?
U look good XD
As someone who hasn't watched the show this is just fucking chaos
Probably should've done one for each season like you did for The Last Airbender     Btw can we pls have one for Korra
Make a sieries of unfortunate events imma do this to every vid until u do it
mother says i may not watch breaking bad. this is an excellent substitute
I heard *anthpo* is nominated for *best actor* of the year...
Very Unsexy. There, I said it. You happy now? *Cries as I run away*
this video is breaking good
*it's me, gus*
sneako was  a great choice for jesse
Why did I think the video title was “Every Episode of Baking Brad”?
Shut up nerd
the doors really said *weep woop*
sneako was such a pleasant surprise
Wait do people actually watch the show?
Get your here before a million ticket here
walter
You forgot Hal waking up from bed right next to Lois and realizing that it was all a dream.
ive never seen this show but it looks like a banger
What do you methlamean?
I fucking lost it when white said "ok"
cool but when every episode of jojo's bizarre adventure
Haha a love that you added Jesse saying b*tch all the time! Good touch.
You didnt want to spoil the ending?
Actually you made it better
Why so many verified people?
Of course Toph would be Todd.
I'm glad that i watch breaking bad and now i can watch this😎
Better call Saul
oh my god PLEASE do the good place next
I love baking bread
That was unexpected but nice to see
This is like when they put the whole plot of a 120 episode series in a 90 minute film
I can't believe they killed Toph 😭😭😭
honestly, i think you could have showcased more plotpoints and episodes. i enjoyed the video and i acknowledge that it is not easy producing an entire show and likely took weeks to bring it all together but you could have gotten twice the watch time easily. love your vids <3
SNEAKOOO
You don't look that good on the Cop suit
I think most of the actors are from the same family, it is as if it were one person who was acting in various roles, how curious is it?
Very
"I'm mentally ill, b*tch." lmao
I never watched breaking bad. Thanks to you I don’t need to watch it
Oh shit, whud up Sneako !
Every episode of clone high?
"I heard you need some meathlamean" "what do you methlamean"
Show me cop costume
What’s the deal with flight food
I wanna watch the show now, no lie  Ill edit it when i finish maybe 3 episodes
He should do “every episode of cobra kai” like so he can see this
Nobody Disney with random crossovers
How does anthpo know everyone
But the ending? 👉👈🥺
i...guess i liked...it?
Have an A-1 day!
The dear sister reference 2:43
I just dropped Netflix cause at this rate I’ll have every show here for free
ㅤ
Every episode of saitama
10/10 great cast, would recommend but I'm too lazy to do that soooooooo.
*chef's kiss*
I don’t even watch this show and it's still funny af xD
This video is 99.1% Pure
Sneako and antho 😎 this was AWESOME
This dude thinks he can just upload the episodes and call it his own
Ok ok great now do gravity falls
MR WHITER
You have like 2 seasons left
anthpo can you PLEASE do 'every episode of stranger things' P L E A S E
hi sneako
Walt Jr is Walt's son but Jesse is Heisenberg's son 😳😳😳😳😳🤕
Ahhhhhh shit sneako in the house
This has to be the one of the most legendary collabs on YouTube
Somebody copied your idea and turned it into a series
This is even more confusing when you've never watched the show before
Yo you forgot the fly episode
BRO WHEN I SAW SNEAKO I CLICKED IN WITHOUT EVEN THINKING OF IT!!!
Yo what's my guy Sneako doing here? I didn't expect this crossover lmfao.
0:51 brooo skunk second and breaking bad had a crossover? This is lit
ohh boy u look so Shrexy in that cop costume hahahahah
You forgot the infamous fly episode. Also at least you kind of didn't spoil the ending
Yes
Hey I liked the guy in the sexy cop costume
Damn man I was gonna watch this show way to spoil the entire series 😔
.
Anthpo is the one who knocks.  Btw, that pizza looked good.
Why is this so accurate
Better Call Saul has to be next once it finishes with the last season next year
I’ve never seen breaking bad and I uh....
make one for Brooklyn nine nine
If you would’ve added the line “TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT” it would’ve been perfect
Skinny Pete was the highlight
It’s like watching hundreds of hours of the show, but in 3:01 minutes.
You should dress as a cop and bust people on campus for stupid stuff like walking on the wrong sidewalk and shit
Jessie: Aye this is my girlfriend  Walter: haha Cool. Here's a bag of money. Don't do drugs  Jessie: Ight, *_B E T_*  Walter: *_Closes door_*  Jessie: *_Does Drugs_*
Hey guys look its the earthbending badgers
Sneeko
He's a better actor than Bryan Cranston
i you and sneako was a combo i never knew id need
as a person who hasn't watched the show, it was very entertaining
u just played a episode of breaking bad
Ruining it? I dunno, I'd say you enhanced it.
Forgot to make Walt Jr breakfast
No one  Sneako: B!%€#
You look pretty hat in the cop costume ngl 😏
I wish you went into more detail about the show like your avatar series
SNEAKOOO
This wasnt all xd
Wow no fly episode no thanks looks like a gottta zooooooom outtta here 🏃🏻‍♂️
1:34 why the FUCK am I listening to Inferno by 9mm Parabellum Bullet, Anthony. Explain yourself.
You can’t just upload the whole series and expect YouTube not to notice.
Whaddyu methlamean
*AnY qUeStIoNs?*
this is definitly my favourite breaking bad recap. its so incredibly detailed
second worst t.v. shows i ever seen its so boring i stop at season 2 of how boring it is. i fell alseep most of the show of how boring it is
I thought Toby was going to play Saul
Yes you heard my request thx anthpo
I'm much older than you so I will not comment on your appearance in a cop costume lol but I did enjoy this breakdown for a show I have never seen, so props for that!
OH MY GOD SNEAKO
i have only seen season one and season two but yeah this is it basically
"every episode of buzzfeed unsolved"
Oh yea baby big man has returned
That was you in the cop outfit. Wow you do be lookin fine
I’ve never seen it. But I like it.
Don’t worry anthpo you didn’t ruin the show you only enhanced it
SNEAKO??!!
heyyy I'm glad Badger made it in the top three hashtags of the video
Never thought this collab would happen but it’s hilarious
Breaking Anthpo
That cop costume. Damn boi
Yo SNEAKO gang where you at?
Excellent grasp of breaking bad!
🗿
this is the only breaking bad ill ever watch
*Can’t believe breaking bad would copy this.*
Anthpo and Sneako am I dreaming
could you by any chance do hannibal?
Mister whité we need to cook methe
Omg yesss y’all did the iconic pizza scene
Pretty damn accurate
I'm gonna use this opportunity to tell all those who haven't watched Breaking Bad yet to watch it.  Just.. just watch it.  Please.  Thank you for your time.
Damn bro, you look pretty cute in that cop costume
I feel like im watching the MCU when i see Sneako in a Cherdleys and Antpho video in the same mounth
Badger an actual badger XD
The colab that i needed
what do you methla-mean  bi-
Comment
Every episode of foster home for imagery friends
Sneakooooooo
idk about yall but that chick at 1:20 looks kinda hot anthpo, bro, do you have her ig? for research purposes obviously the cop is hot too btw
02:37  I thought he was going to say something with vibing  I associate this person with cool vibes now
Jesse where is the Cocainer?
Do every episode of Naruto
Now I can say I’ve watched Breaking Bad
Man all these Breaking Bad memes are on fire, but they finally made me watch it.
Sneako was doin a good Job fr
You forgot 32 minutes of a fly
This is pretty cool, they should make a show about this.
I was just talking about breaking bad
That Gus Fring imitation was great tho
Can you stop spoiling my moms entertainment?
Damn you forgot about combo mad disrespectful, RIP Combo
Hey.
shark boy and lava girl in a nutshell would be fun
1:05 every episode of better call saul
my mom dosent let me watch breaking bad but she didnt say anything about this
2:42 😂
So is it supposed to be what every episode is like or every episode combined???
Anthpo, I dunno why but a show called breaking bad copied your video, you can sue them bro
I watched the show and ngl I HATED skylar with a passion
When that kid died I didn’t even know what to do anymore
Sneako 👍
bruh you better fix the ending or im gonna tell my mom on you
this is just the whole series in 3 minutes.
This makes me wanna watch Breaking Bad-
Funny video man 💪👍
God damn Anthony. That cop costume 😳
as someone who hasnt watch the series im so confused
LMFAO THE FUCKING MINECRAFT DOOR
Dude what a collab, freakin sneako here. I clicked immediately when I saw him in the thumbnail lol
Do scooby do next
lmaooo awesome and i wasnt expecting sneako lmao
WhErEs LeGenD Of KoRrA
You look pretty ok as a cop
I'm so relieved you didn't waste a pizza by throwing it on the roof.  They don't grow on trees.
I was literally thinking about restarting this show but now I just don't know anymore...
I find it hilarious though I have no idea what is going on because I haven't seen it
...did....did he shave his head for a youtube video.....again ?
Jesse
Jesse, Jesse im fucking homeless, Jesse
I liked watching Breaking Bad, I was good at it
sneako
Do One Piece
I'm disappointed you shaved your head for Avatar but not for every male character in Breaking Bad.
"Wadda you methla-mean?" Funniest shid I've ever heard
Anthpo is the kind of guy to make ridiculous YouTube videos that my friends watch at sleepovers
I heard that sneaky use of the Berserk 2016 music, tryna hide you're a nerd smh. Hot in that cop outfit tho
YO IS THAT SNEAKO
I fully expect to see Better Call Saul and El Camino after this. Also, I didn’t hear enough “Bitch!” in the video.
I have not watched breaking bad but I think I understand now.
Sneako should have been jesse in El Camino
48,385th!
Quite the s3x
SNEAKO!!
Jesse, Brun RV with wRong engridienT
Sneakoooooo 😂😂
you lkook liek ain a costu,emk !!
I was concerned when the video was 2/3 of the way through and they were still on season 3, then my mans really just skipped all the way through season 4 with Gus's death
Bro you looked so good in that police costume
I've just finished the show today lol
"Hey yo Mr. White," "What's Up?" "Bitch"
*distressed Walter White face*
the only part you missed is walter getting CLAPPED
oh shit sneako
BITCH
I mean the jump from Avatar to breaking bad is a liiitle drastic, but I can vibe with it
2:38 I didn’t know toph was in breaking bad.
Do every episode of ben 10 please
Never watched bb and I’m so confused anyone care to explain
I can't believe anthpo singlehandedly ruined breaking bad because of his sexy cop costume
I've watched breaking bad, and this is the funniest shit I've seen in a while
Cocainer
ok ok
this makes me want to rewatch and maybe actually finish this time breaking bad  mmm whatcha sayyyy do b99 next in honor of andy samberg. HE looks sexy in a cop uniform  fuck that worked so perfectly :)
Unpopular opinion: Badger was by far the best character and had the best character development.
Hank: "Do what you're gonna d--" **BLAM** Walt: "aw man"
‘ok’  -Walter White
5/10 for the cop costume, when you’ve seen Bryan Cranston in one it’s hard to hold up
Turns out I wasted 5 years on the show when all I needed was 3mins.
gus killed me
Oh no I broken the bad
that cop costume though...
Life if you want legend of kora
ok im spongebob now like cause i change subject
Awesome
Anthpo in cop custome looks THICC
Sweet! Now I can say that I have seen breaking bad
"Hey this is my (drug addicted) girlfriend" "Haha cool, here's a bag of money, don't do drugs"
You be looking pretty shady in that police costume. 😳
To be fair, you didn't ruin the show. El Camino did.
Gotta admit that looks pretty fire
Bruh, you be lookin kinda cute in dat cop costume doh
Good. wigs..
Like if Anthpo could win a marathon without legs and arms, just elbows
I haven't even watched breaking bad
That "nothing will go wrong" sounded a lot like Giancarlo Esposito ngl, like I'm not entirely sure it's not a line of his from something.
Not sure if the bald cap is a condom or not, but if it is, kudos.
How did you get the script for Jesse?
Sneako!!
If a first grader got the script of breaking bad:
I swear he keeps making these so he can find an excuse to shave his head.
I’ll never need to watch this show
Breaking Good
HOLY SHIT SNEAKO AND ANTHPO
Didnt know jessie liked cuties.
do legend of korra pls
Imagine being one fine specimen of a man in a cop costume.
I was just about to start watching Breaking Bad tonight, but now im good.. ty 4 this bb
Drug
i love this format. especially the last scene was gold. But u missed so many opportunities on the whole skylar drama. and minerals, bro.
wait do bad things happen in this show
It took me way too long to notice that he used a croc as a phone.
1:35 Fun Fact: Berserk Openings make videos 142× better
Can I get top comment just for being Dwight
Mr white where is my 2000/1km of meth?
i've never watched breaking bad but now i feel like i don't have to i know everything there is to know
Anthpo never comments on people’s comments. If he comments on this comment I will comment on his comment to my comment commenting about how he never comments on comments. Then if he comments on that I will comment on it making an ultimate chain of comments.
wait you were in a cop costume
I dont even need to watch it now
thanks for taking care of Todd man. total embarrassment
Legit just started watching this show last week
Now do every episode of "Better Call Saul" lmao
THE BOYS next?
Why waste months of your life watching the full thing when the plot fits into 3 minutes
SAY MAH ANTHPO!
JESSER!!! WHERE IS THE PIZZASS JESSIES????????
Dad is that you you sad i am going to leave you and your mom to do braking bad
Low key wanna start watching breaking bad
Hey Anthpo do every episode of regular show. You won’t...
Dude forgot the m60 scene
Called it
Yaaaaaaaaaa breaking bad my ultimate favourite show of all time
Skinny Pete got nice dance moves
That's better than the original
Yeeah keep em short
That cop costume tho😳😳😳
New vid and ITS pretty great
Here is the validation you asked for: you look sexy in that cop costume.
I think you killed the wrong guy in the end
I haven't even seen the show! and this was fantastic
rug
Sneako as Gus Fring???? I’ll allow it.
u forgot the fly
Nice shirt dude
Gus was kinda spot on doe
oh my god are you going bald again
Gus impression too good
I loved the part where sneako said “im mentally ill... bitch”
No
Aaron Paul looks....different
Is the cartel psychicpebbles?
Bruh fucking 35 minutes ago lmaaooo
Now say my name ... Anthpo ... You're god dame right
walter black
I saw sneako in the thumbnail I HAD TO CLICK
Nice  (;
Can’t believe you just straight up ignored Combo!!!             Bitch
"Im literally dying-" "no youre good listen hered the plan"
Every episode of Pokemon better be next
idk if you watched prison break but i would a version of it!! <3
I have never watched breaking bad so thanks for the summary
It infuriates me how people just go and make knock offs of all your shows, you needa start suing
I've made it this far
Y E S
I can't believe you got the actual Giancarlo Esposito in your video!
so this is what SNEAKO did before, SNEAKO
Anthpo now know how to make meth .3.
Omg!!!! Sneeekooooo!
Sneako!!!!
niiiiiiiice you look good in a butt costume
tying the tourniquet around his lower arm XD
SPOLIERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As someone who has never watched breaking bad.... I don't understand anything of this
Sneako and anthpo the ultimate combo
If they ever do another Breaking Bad special, I think we just found our new Walter and Jesse
wow what a good show cant believe i found it on youtube since i don't have a netflix subscription thanks anthpo
What do you methlamean. Bitch
Huzzah! A show of quality!
"Say my name"  "ok"  "ok"
Jedse, where is the cocainer?
I always knew that this day would come or wait... is it just the meth?
I just started the series a few days ago and this is perfect timing
I just finished the show like two days ago perfect timing my man
It's my birthday today
Sneako playing Jessi was disturbingly on point and is it racist to say he played a good Gus?
this was really good
And now we're just waiting for the Better Call Saul parody
Segsi🥵
I wish Anthpo would come to my house just so then I can turn him away and watch him throw a pizza
I never watched breaking bad so WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING
that was one smexy cop outfit
1:39 this part hit different
"Watcha methyl-mean... Bitch?"
Hey I live in New Mexico were it was filmed
1. I got a dig bick 2. You that read wrong  3. You read that wrong too  4. You checked  5. You smiled  7. Your wondering why your still reading this  8. You saw the mistake ...right? On 7  10. But you see that I skipped 6 10. You checked  11. I saw you I doubled 10 and skipped 9 12. I said saw you, not you saw 13. I also skipped 12  14. You got tricked, I didn't  15. I wasted your time

I can't believe Breaking Bad gave you the budget to afford this. This is Making Good
You should do every Harry Potter book
Who else wishes Los Pollos Hermanos was a legit chicken place
Man, you look hot in that cop-stume. Get it? Cop-stume? Ok, I'll see myself out.

I haven't even watched Breaking Bad, but I feel like I know everything I should know about the show now.
Breaking Bad is the best show on television.     Except maybe The Wire
It really be like that sometimes
Another role where Anthpo shaves his head
Attack helicopter
To this day I still don’t and will never understand the point in the pizza on the roof

This is gold
SNEAKO
Fuck Leonardo Di'Caprio Me and the homies watch *Anthpo*

The pizza throw was oscar worthy
The alternative ending to Breaking bad looks sick

A new person?
Fixing good
it's important to stay educated on ur meth kids

the pizza throw must have taken so long to get exactly right

Anthpo looking like a snack in that cop costume
“I’m mentally ill, my Gf is dead and I lost everything”.  Anthpo: your fine
Pog
So, Bottom Gear next ?
I have never watched this but is the drug man cool
“what do you methlaMEAN?  ...BITCH”  classic
You’ve officially gone too far
I am disapointed in you anthpo, There was not a scene where the joke "Only a Spoon Full" was implemented. I am truly sad
"shut up nerd" "ok" was the best line i have ever heard
I like eggs
Omg what the fuck? This is really funny.
0:00 when the teacher tries to get the class to talk in zoom
Hello anthpo I’m here early

The scene of Gus' death ended me 😂
Minecraft
Making full use of ur hairstyle i see
im losing my shit over the sneako feature
Lol
Yo that ragdoll at the end of the episode
Bruh i just started watching this show and this is perfectly accurate.
y’know i like imagining how anthony actually decides what show to do an “every episode of”. since he has less hair atm, he probably googles things like: “bald main characters of popular tv shows”. absolutely amazing, you have gain my respect 100, anthony.
You have like a couple months to live.     Okay.........
jesse wheres the cocainer
Walter White: So who can I sue? Saul: yes
ngl best video ever
What did i just watch
jesse i need the cocainer
SNEAKOOOO, biggest crossover ever
SNEAKO!!!!!

Im dissapointed i was waiting for legend of kirra

I haven't seen Breaking Bad, but I'll go watch it so I can understand this. brb
Why did everyone just start watching breaking bad again. Like srsly

The special effects in this video were top notch as usual 👍🏻
this is Breaking Bad but better
Every episode of Seinfeld
I've never seen this but it's most likely correct
Hey Anthony.  There is this show called Breaking Bad, and it seems extremely similar to this.
Give us korra
Damn nice cop
YOO WE GOT SNEAKO IN THIS TOO? LETS GO
Anthpo cop, more like, Im gay now
this videos are the only good thing from 2020
This made my day
Walter White looks like Dr. Doofersmitz
Do gossip girl  🤪🤪
i see sneako i click
bruh I can only imagine how smokin you'd look in a cop costume
sneako lmao
Why did you tie off the wrist
Skinny feet and Badger had me dying
This accurate, but where is the punchline doe
“Heard you guys need methylamine” “What do you *methylamine* “
do BROOKLYN 99!!
hey
-Ayo Mr White -Whats up -B*#ch
Haven’t watched Braking Bad before but this is still hilarious entertainment
Me: *has never seen a single episode of breaking bad*  Also me: LMAOOO this is too accurate 🤣
pizza time
I cant stop laughing this haha
he did not kill tod at that part tho
What if u wanted to go heaven... but god said: *O K*
yeah bitch
Anthpo is the best actor of our generation. From everyone in phineas and ferb to the greatest character of all time in Walter white
the ending's a little different from how i remember it...
Give me my croc back you thief
Missed the most iconic line of the entire show: “Jesse”
Do the sopranos it's kind of like breaking bad a little,well not really but do it anyway
ok
You should do every episode of adventure time
Anthpo looked ugly in that cop uniform
SNEAKO
Say my name
Re
Almost finishing up the series and love the accuracy of it
This makes me want to watch breaking bad
Breaking Bad, literally one of the greatest shows ever made, I always love when I see people making parodies just to say “Hey, we still love and appreciate the show and everyone who was behind it,” that kind of stuff just warms my heart
Seems legit
I tried 5 times start watching Braking bad, but i just cant finish
i mean it sure is accurate. shouldve included the disabled kid on the crutches, though i suppose the hospital wouldnt allow you to take those, even if its for "an epic prank"
Love the enthusiasm he puts in this
I-
U look good in that cop suit😳
LOL SNEAKO
acab except anthpo 💖
Am early for once in my life...
“Nobody cared until I put on the hat”- hisenburger
I watched breaking bad during quarantine and well this is very epic
I was genuinely laughing my ass off when Sneako popped up
Thank u for keeping all pizzas safe in this video

I feel like I've been spoiled but I don't know what the spoilers are.
Haven't seen this show so I'm gonna believe that this is the actual show and anthpo just re-uploaded it
