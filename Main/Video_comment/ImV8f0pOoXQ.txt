True or false that is how we discover th amercas,VALIANT AND COURAGEOUS PERSONS .SECRETS? TO CONTROL? JUST TIME WILL GAVE US THE ANSWERS.BE RESILIENT.
Fox News reports whatever spin gets thrown at them. You would think to have more viewers if they would just speculate  in the other direction people would tune in again and again to help you help them if that makes sense. If these guys were trying to make$ off a rock they would have just shown the edges of the right angles their being truthful hoping to find out what it truly is
what a stupid waste of time, you go down into a pitch black water and you bring a flashlight! Dummies!
“It could be man-made!” But it may not? It isn’t!
I think those days no ocean only gaint lakes
All the Best 2 all , But don't behave depressed.  God is with U
The background loud music is unbearable
I think It is a single entity , with multiple consciousness within , and yes , it is a UFO too
I dont get that. What are the odds , its just a trucking rock. Nope. It just has to be a UFO, portal , hellhole. Crazy.
If this is a natural rock formation, show me one other on the face of this planet that resembles it. This follows the pattern of all legit finds. Trivialised by mainstream media, military investigation and threats. Almost convinced that this is more than just a pile of rocks.
you have a lot of fake "praise bots" channels here.  why?  did you purchase them?
How come the anomaly looks ALMOST EXACTLY like the Star Wars hans solo ship, Millenium Falcon? No, seriously, its pretty much the same shape.  This is why I am SKEPTICAL of this video.  Do the research.  Its fake.
Evidence of Atlantis and their technology has been spoke of being here. Clues are in the book THE DWELLER OF TWO PLANETS. Verified by Edgar Cayce in his collection of Atlantis readings. Other connections can be seen in Ancient sanskrit writings of India in the videos of Mohan Praveen of Ancient Aliens fame. Good hunting!!!😊❤
Starts at 5:00  Is it possible it came down when there was no water present there? The trackway it appears to have made is suggestive of that.
This is actively being covered up.
They have been talking about this for decades and nothing😂
Hindsight, sonar showed the floor in a massive mosaic. Clearly looks like a crash sight of an ET space craft. The planet is being visited, it's being discussed in Congress. Whistleblowers with untouchable credentials, under oath have testified that we have downed alien spacecraft. And their occupants. All the 3 letter agency's have an office secretly investigating UAP/UFO interaction with earth. We are not alone
41:47 Top scientist collecting material from a crust that grew over 140,000 years with a small knife, thinking he's collecting the real material... He should have gone there with a drill and extracted about 2 meters to reach the actual object...
If I get to the end of this and they dont solve the mystery I'm gonna say the n word
I like how they have to over dramatize EVERYTHING!😂 they spend 5 mins talking about a cable and how difficult it can be trying to find and hook it. Follwed by the narrator saying they found the cable almost immediately 😂
It's a time travel machine made by human in the future.  I mean at some point we was going find a time machine we don't know where. The threats are from people who is afraid of the truth of is it spaceship or a time machine what are are they afraid of. Both spaceship or time machine is a threat to religions. If it spaceship there is no God and if it time machine mean religions come from the future meaning there is no God.
Chewies been looking for that for years he will be well pleased
Joe rogan should bring this back to everyone's attention
Get lydar
horsefeathers,why was this made
If one truly opens their eyes to see what is still visible, it becomes clear that there have been several resets throughout history. It’s no surprise that the media ridicules those who question the official narrative, since the media largely serves the interests of the government. Governments around the world do not want people to discover the truth, because then we would realize how much we’ve been deceived about many important matters. This is also why we seem to be moving toward a future with greater control and less freedom. Individuals like the ones featured in the documentary may soon no longer be allowed to conduct independent investigations.
If it's man made, it should have a door.
Some nerdy billionaire is out there laughing their butts off at their sunken starwars ship prank 😂
Prolly a geological formation
How is this Milenium Falcón a natural sea anomoly
Looks like a man made structure once existed there when the sea levels were much lower and this place was dry. It almost looks like the base of a light house with steps leading up.
A fossil of a millions of years old creator....?
😮
It's obviously the Millennium Falcon.....
I don't understand why a bunch of guys go to check out something on the floor of the sea and then get death threats. Like, way to go humanity. What is wrong with people? It doesn't matter if it's a pile of rocks. That's what they went down there to determine. Whatever they discover, at least they're out in the world doing things, rather than sitting at home, making videos that just make fun of other people's interests. That's just bullying at its finest. (I hope the crew gets the funding that they need.)
1st it was Christmas trees and now it’s the Millennium Falcon. Like Woke culture stole the rainbow. No the Latvian’s can not claim our Star Wars legacy! 🤣
time to give up learning ANYTHING about this BLOODY 'ANOMALY'...waste of time
the Millenium Falcon???
You can see more of the rock formation all around the anomaly very faint, this must be the peak of a rock formation
Reading your video description, "millions of years old" hahaha, immediately reject the video and block your dumbasses. Grow up
Did you know that flying vehicles sre written about in God's word. This is just a teaser from NASA (liars).  Satan needs a way to make people want to rapture off this earth with him. What better way than a fake alien invasion. And don't forget... Satan has flying vehicles, God has them, and God even sends out scouts to go to and fro over the earth. We will see flying vehicles soon. Endure until the end. Do not be afraid and WAIT ON THE LORD who comes AFTER THE WORKS OF SATAN.   This is talking about satan 👇  Jeremiah 4:13 Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.
utter rubbish
Some day scientists will discover intelligent life.............on earth 🌎  Interesting story about  this strange rock, sure got my rocks off 😎
Debunked 2 years ago. CLICK
looks like lava
if this was the History channel, they would have made 10 seasons out of this... 😅  kidding aside, i applaud them and i hope they get a sponsor to continue their investigation!
why it is so called anomaly???  😂 it’s not
Uplifted Rock formation nothing else. If you look at the surrounding earth, you see a similar rock formation. Sorry folks it's not E.T.  👽 😢
It's the Ebon Hawk,  a dynamic class freighter. Quite popular in its day
Looks like a megalith

What utter tosh.   Nothing more than tabloid garbage.
So we still don’t know what it is?
That looks like the mellineum falcon from Star Wars
Skip the first 55 minutes.
It's the star wars Melinium Falcon.  Contact George Lucas and Tewbaka asap.
Yawn....oh...another rock formation....zzzz
Your discoveries help shape up the world. Whether it is extraterrestrial or man made. keep up the good work.
Are there any deep divers out there?  I'm a diver, but only certified to 100 meters.  Can you tell me why fog is a danger to the dive?  The divers are underwater and if there is a safety line they would follow it up to the boat.
I believe it is what it looks like. If it has a runway like track behind it and a path in front of it then shouldn't the real question be did it crash from the sky or while in the water and if there is a path in front of it then where was it going?
I'm so sorry for the slander visited on these two explorers by Fox News. Fox is truly a blight on decent society. It's lies have destroyed American democracy, for fun and profit.
4:44    scientists stupid enough to rent a leaking boat - and they will tell us how earth was created ?? no way 😂😂😂😂 wtf
5.6 millions had watched 30 mins fo youtube/google ads - this world is going down fast
This is the plow that plowed up Denmark in old Scandinavian Folklore.
I’m a History Hit subscriber but disgusted and disappointed that you would endorse this UFO speculative nonsense.
Do a Drain the Oceans on it
How did they not record the GPS location the first time???
Absolutely BS.. I wonder if the “object” exists at all.. very “professional” crew..
This whole show for nothing
It's like flash ... to light up hidden ancient stories below the surface... to inspire other to ieep looking hidden unsolved mysteries further!
It does look like a crash ufo
Looks like a stone ship dock
Its an ancient island harbour, when the sea level was lower... No mystery... 🙏

Keep at it guys, some really serious backing is required here to fund maybe a saturation diving team, or a manned vehicle to be able to spend some serious time on it. I cant believe that this isnt given highest priority by the worlds leaders. Or even better, someone like Musk who would probably have it raised and restored by this time next week
It’s the millennium falcon folks😅
I hope some day someone who has money and the same desire to discover what this really is comes to you and helps out....Good Program keep true to your dream...Praying the threats stop ....
It looks like the Millennium Falcon crashed in the Baltic sea
Pareidolia is a great wealth generator.  In fact it's one of the biggest.   It makes you think there's something there when there's nothing there.   Exactly like this documentary, and all forms of religion.
I wonder if they tried to get James Cameron to cosign and fund. Sounds like something J.C. would be interested in.
This is not natural and for me this is a crash something in the ocean. Thank you for spending your time to find answers for us viewers you made us happy to satisfied our thinking.
Captain Thomas is the man!
Ineed natgeo to make drain the ocean series for this
Shaped like the miliium falcon
You are not supposed to find something’s because there is a lot they don’t want us to find out
That was a really dangerous dive because of very limited space mistakes. Wow.
It’s obviously the Millennium Falcon
The object will never be found again. To long for the US Government to recover it
I would love to be a treasure hunter! Living the dream fellas. People who reply negatively do so behind the safety of there keyboard, keep up the work
Humans are disgraceful creatures

Is it stone or metal
GTA San Andreas predicted it in the map
What's a youfow? AI voice reading as written?
Looks lke a rift, volcanic in origin.
Damn! Extraterrestrial Aliens with a sense of humor decided to build a spaceship that looked similarly to the Millennium Falcon and crashed it into the Baltic Sea, hoping we'd find it to give them some interesting fun as they monitored us when we discovered it. It's not the end that matters, it's the journey! Keep investigating it until we know for sure.
A Corellian YT-1300 light freighter, mystery solved
a "you-foe"?
A Doggerland  submerged   watchtower?
interesting how often  the word "money" is used by those "explorers...
This is an hour I'll never get back
Yes..so much details that go nowhere..  Call Elon and ask for 100 million..✅
I am so sorry people have been horrible to you
Just another unsatisfactory docu with zero answers. Just like the search for bigfoot. Lot's of episodes about finding nothing at all.
While everyone argues over politics and news, The Obscured Principles book by Dorian Caine quietly explains how the real game is played. The moment I read it, everything around me looked different. It’s like it gave me the decoder ring for reality.

They found the millennium falcon!!😂😂😂
Oh my God it's The Drain. I hope they don't pull it 😮😢🥺😬🙀
It's just a HUGE FUNGUS and people don't see them because they don't believe in water mushrooms. They are STUPID idiots for not having faith for them. TRUMP2028 AND BEYOND
It's a HUGE MUSHROOM
It burnt during re-entry. It looks like the top of the Millinium Falcon.
Maybe be straight forward & say it as it is. Than acting when a camera is on
Is it just me, or is there anyone else thinking about sipping on a bottle of champagne that the Swedish team discovered?
Maybe a disintegrated undersea  lava flow end.
1. We still don’t have any answers about ANYTHING…ANYWHERE…EVER   But we do know:  1.  Epstein did not kill himself 2.  This was thoroughly explained by The completely blacked out documents that Pam Bondi released after telling the world that they had all and tons and tons of evidence along with video. 3.  The spacecraft and orbs in our skies that are zipping around it warp speed through atmosphere are hours Trump says 4.  Gislaine Maxwell is in prison for doing nothing to nobody ever.  And lastly, this is just another. We have no idea video but thanks for trying to waste our time.
The world and humanity is most likely deprived of a very interesting archaeological or historical find because of... Friggin Fox News?!? I can't believe people can dare question these treasure hunters' experience, intuition and enthusiasm like this from their comfortable seats?!? And torpedo their chances of getting funding? Then people start smear campaigns on these adventurers to silence them even further? Please, I want to wake up to a different reality tomorrow.   All my congrats to the documentary team for bringing this story so well to the public, and dear treasure team, please don't doubt yourselves! Don't let threats and smears get to you! I hope soon I'll watch you guys going down there and figuring out what it is. All my best wishes to you 🙏✨❤️
It’s the Ebon Hawk
Of course it was, Fox New pushing a fake story without real facts yet.
IT TAKES A NASTY POS 💩 TO THREATEN A MAN AND HIS FAMILY LOOKING AT THIS EVIDENCE MAN I WISH HE COULD TEAM UP WITH BOB BALLARD S COMPANY WHERE WE COULD HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS OBJECT 🥺
Ich wünsche dem viel Glück und vor allem auch Anerkennung für so viel Tatkraft und Forschungsdrang. Es ist eine Anomalie und wer Klarheit haben will, muss eben auch die Möglichkeit bekommen, das zu untersuchen, ohne das irgendwelche Cyber-Mobber ihren unqualifizierten Kommentar abgeben.
Unexplainable? Maybe some extraterrestrial accident. Has to be covered up by all the other aliens living on earth in our surrounding? Nobody wants to be uncovered...
one of the greatest discoveries of all time, without explanation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13ShK2UAeP0
for those who are curious: this video is worthless. It gives no information about the object. Wasting an hour of your time.
Looks like an old gun turret minus it’s barrel.
To me if I were these guys, I wouldn't give up until I knew exactly what it was and what caused it. It almost looks as if something was flying at great speed and crash landed on the ocean floor before coming to a complete stop. Whether it is a human made ship, a UFO or space rock, I still want to know as much as these guys what it is. If I had the money I'd send in enough to hull the items up to the surface for analysis.
You will be assimilated,  resistance is futile , its the borg
It is a glacier stone
Blah blah blah,beat around the bush .
I don’t understand why these professionals didn’t have the exact location of the object from their first finding it. With all the devices available today I’d have thought that would be the first thing they’d record when it was initially discovered?
The most logical theory is that this is a meteor that drove through that mountain carving it out, and the remnants of that mountain caused the 'ridge' up to the meteor that was visited by the divers. The other parallel remnant could be a splinter of the meteor that broke away earlier on the trajectory because of its similar remnants.  The Earth is hit with meteors quite often through history,  but the true answer has yer to be concluded.  I salute the discovery team for its bravery, passion, and human spirit !!!
14years later now that ufo and uap are starting to be revealed you look back on google map and now that anomaly is no long their which make me believe that that was a real spaceship and probably moved elsewhere
I have found one of these on land on Google Earth
a ancient stone quarry or a petrified non human craft ..i wonder how many centuries ago it was that there was no water in the baltic basin and when it was inhabited...awesome
Yeah I 1000% immediately thought Millennium Falcon... As in "oh that obvious geological formation looks like the Millennium Falcon"  Like they found nothing, they showed nothing...
looks like the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy !!!
Light speed drive must've went out. Wonder how many parsecs one could do the Kestel run in such a craft
I could do without all the Swearing. (Not necessary !)
That location used to be dry land. That is a part of a man made structure.
its a lost ATLANTIS
nah some nearby government probably have discovered something on that spot then started calling them hoax to discourage them from coming back
Well me bealive that is space craf. In 2020 june 21 i have to sleep in Rio Haina gringo beach. No driven home. So stay and swemind at 3.00 am. Then these thing come out the water about 1 mile sway the come to shore fly top of  me.. many light wss like shues horse. Big ingene was lout some blue fuel smoke turbine . Seat for about 1 minute and thend yes disapier in secons maibe 60 food lond a 20 wide.. tray icture phone wont work. True history never forget everty dsy think about. 😮
I hope one day, this gets an answer.  But until then, let’s enjoy the mystery
If I had the money I would fund  you for sure I have been watching you ever since you first started it is a UFO I really hope you get funding I wish you all the best it's about time the world knows Michael from New Zealand 😊😊😊
I think it may sound a little bit crazy but it seems like something made of material that is not from this planet crashed into a live volcano and in the process the material that it was created from absorbed the minerals of this planet and then turned said craft into stone! That would mean that said craft would have to be millions of years old in order to turn metal into stone. Example titanic ! How ever the material of said craft is made from a different metallurgical substance not from earth! So its reaction to earth materials would be different than what we know! On a metallurgical scale would be different from what we know here on earth! There would be no reason for it to take this shape if it didn’t already exist in shape only volcanic rock around the outside of said craft and only the shape of craft left! The thought is very provoking!
Wow, so interesting. Too bad they couldn’t have another expedition, it all came down to money, sad 😞
That's the millennium falcon
That ship UFO looks like the Ebon Hawk a ship from the Knights of the Old Republic games piloted by Revan/ Darth Revan
Your work is important.  Don't give up! We need to know
This is a man made object. In one photo at 55:27 the upper right corner you can see characteristic arcs in the shape of the letter M. This is definitely an underwater McDonalds restaurant for aliens.
OMG! They found a rock. An hour of manufactured drama supported by dramatic angels in heaven music that I will not get back. When diving in the Baltic Sea it gets darker the deeper you go until there’s no light at all. Wow! A revelation. It’s that way everywhere you dive. Sunlight only penetrates so far. I’m not a diver so I ask this question honestly seeking an answer. How would fog above the surface of the ocean affect deep sea divers?  The only bigger waste of time than this is the Curse of Oak Island. Those conmen have created an industry. Lifetime income from a scam.
The millenium falcon
I'm so sorry, that whatever they found might not be a flying saucer, but whatever it is, their efforts deserve more than ridcule and threats!
A big round rock with quarried  bits taken from it before the sea covered it' a long time ago.
The Wasa is an incredible ship, but sank in Stockholm's harbor on its maiden voyage. I'm impressed about that ship having seen it twice. The Wasa Museum is worth visiting in Stockholm.
57:34 - "Special of the Day" menu 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Vc acha que vão falar o que realmente é 😂😂😂 A ciência supostamente sabe quase tudo sobre o universo e na vai saber de uma pedra a 90mt debaixo da água 🖕
Wasted time. Video about nothing.
i cannot beleive people beleived fox news they are as fake as anything but i havent seen any updates about it
O rock... yes the dumbs get dumber Never listen to archaelogy liars and creeps. Blind bats and sickly gnats are the evil overly under educated. No one listens to these idiots anymore... yah right that does not look like any stupid little rock... oh funny! The educated dumbs are dumber yet!
Dumbs talkin dumbs we are sick of these leftist dumbs telling their lies
out of star wars ffs
Baltic Sea Anomaly/  Natural Rock Formation.   The most obvious answer is usually the correct one.
Government and filthy pig man don’t want to know ,outer space ufo hit down and made it look like engine and equipment got failed and more over this was been hunting down and it came here and ended in Baltic Sea ,so it’s an UFO 🛸 nothing else
So, there are posh oligarchs, which risk their lives with the Titanic dive, but non of them, no Elon of some sort gives this guy his few millions for further investigation? I don't get it. What are a few ten millions for an oligarch? Nothing, that are the last seven numbers on one of his accounts, when stock ratings slightly move. I wish you guys luck!
Its nothing they found nothing unfortunately a waste of time
Anyone that does a deep sea dive way down there have balls of steel..diwn that far everything is trying to kill you down there
It could be a chunk of the deck of a ship that just deteriorated in that shape
Hans solos ship
I watched too much start wars
a "you fo" 😂
It's the drain plug for the Baltic. Remove it and the whole Baltic drains away.  Actually I hate documentaries where the answer at the end is "We don't know" because you never get the final answer. If the final answer turns out to be mundane, you never get told because it is not worth filming. If it isn't mundane, then they have to justify the cost of a new documentary which seldom gets approved.  Management says: "We already covered that and we aren't paying for it again."
this belongs on the discovery chanel....
I'm 100% behind.You have found something truly amazing & it is very important that we find out where the spaceship came from. I wish you guys good luck .
It’s highly likely that this part of the ocean was once bode ground…. Maybe a mountain range, maybe impact from the meteors that hit the earth pre ice age
Mystery solved… That’s just the millennium falcon
The research team collected enough data to prove that this object was constructed, and is artificial. If it was a ship of some sort, then it appears to have plummeted through the atmosphere, possibly with it's surface having been charred by atmospheric friction, then crashing into the water at a great speed, and when hitting the bottom, ploughing through a rise in the sea floor, then coming to rest on it's bottom.
When I first caught sight of this object, I thought that it indeed, might be a crashed ET ship, but upon analysis, it is more like some sort of sculpture. The only thing that is obvious, is that it entered the sea, and sunk to the bottom, due to the trench that it made, when coming to rest on the sea floor. It must have been airborne to have done that. And it emitts an electromagnetic field? Very odd indeed! What is the military afraid of, that they restrict access to this thing?
Looks like a Jumpmaster transport ship.  There was a Bounty hunter who went by Dengar who used a modified Jumpmaster called “Punishing One”
Its Hand Solos Aluminum Falcon!!!
Did anyone think to ask Harrison Ford??
I haven’t, and don’t plan to read all the comments,  so I apologise if this is already said, but doesn’t it look like the millennium falcon?🤔
anyone can see it's the millinium falcon
For a seasoned treasure hunter, I'm surprised he didn't take GPS coordinates .
My first thought was glacier rock. My last thought was also glacier rock.
This is the first time of seeing this video, and on the first glimpse of the object, I declare it as nothing more than a oddly shaped rock...I wont be watching any more of this video, time stamp 3.30
For me though I look at the rest of that data and it tells me not of UFOs but of a long ago eruption where the magma plug ejected due to pressure but instead of breaking up like it would above the water, it skimmed the seabed and came to rest. The transection of the mountain can happen in volcanos when there is a release of pressure causing the weaker rock to collapse. Also I do speak Swedish, that was a very sanitised version of the Skipper lol.
can someone share exact coordinates?
bruh thats the millenium falcon
45 seconds in and the guy says ufo? Like he's never heard of a U.F.O.
It's pretty obvious it's the millennium falcon.
You know when you're on the right track when media debunks you and you get threats, well recognised method by governments to undermine and deter the honest man
Get the Titanic guy involved!!
Its a cork plughole for the sea!!😂😂😂😂😂
The whole explorer crew are heroes.. keep moving forward...god Bless...
Spoiler Alert.  Its clearly the Millennium Falcon.
Its just like most other mysterious man-made like stone-objects on the bottom of the oceans:  Lost advanced civilization structure.  Remember that the sea level just pass 14.000 years ago was 300ft lower than today. 14.000 years ago, this object stood on dry land! He is right, the more we dig our head into these things, the more questions we get because its far beyond our paygrade as the humans we are today.
14:39  You didn’t take down the coordinates when you were there the first time? Now you have to go back and find it.
I think it looks like the cross section of a ship, a bulkhead !
Sometimes, we must learn to love the questions themselves.
You know youve stumbled upon something when msm try to discredit you. Msm is first point of contact then the threats
I sent through the photos to OceanX and Stockholm University for you to consider.
It has to be a meteorite. I think that is the best possible answer
What a crock of shyt, glad that i skipped large parts of it,
ALIEN SHIP MAYBE COULD BE A POSSIBILITY..
Make no mistake.. he's just a glorified grave robber.
V🎉🎉🎉🎉
I think it might have been a meteor that liquified when it came through the atmosphere and hit the water and flattened out as it cooled and fell to the bottom. Too big and too heavy to be man made, and why would it be way out there?
Looks like the millennium falcon
That would be a UO not a UFO. It is obviously not flying.
they dont deserve the hate mail. im proud they found something and were trying to explain what it is. even if it is just a rock it is very interesting and the object being colder in temp than the surrounding area is interesting as well. explaining  the unexplained is what makes the human species unique. problem solving. keep solving and finding treasures guys. good hunting
a complete waste of time!
It's the millenium falcon.
Looks like a volcanic plug. Volcano goes dormant and the magma sets. The surrounding material erodes away leaving the top of the plug exposed. How is this a mystery? Were there no geologists around at all?
Natron theory!
That looks like the Millennium Falcon
I don’t have enough time, patience or intelligence to answer all your questions.  What if you are just idiots that can’t get any answers?  What if the money that is ment for research goes into your pocket?  What if you shut up?
Ok how long ago was the sea 90m lower!
These documentaries always end the same way, nothing is revealed and no questions answered, just a waste of time.
This is a Corellian YT-1300 light freighter.
Why didn't they do a go fund me?  FOX News fks up everything.
Looks like the Millennium Falcon, guess Disney finally crashed it.
Does night vision Not work underwater?
Ancient tree stump. Time of the Titans
It looks like the Millennium Falcon
Why do we jump to the most fantastical explanation when we aren't sure about something?  As soon as I saw the first images in this video, I recalled seeing other natural rock and lava formations that look very similar. My next thought was, could it be something that fell off a cargo ship?  A meteorite? Well, some good research will eventually figure it out.  I never once thought, OMG an alien spacecraft!
My theory is that it’s stone, likely something that sank to the bottom from an ancient ship.
SPOILER ALERT:        Just kidding!
Re - OPEN 🔓  don't GIVE Up.
I say this coming from someone who watches to much films… Dose it not seem weird the fox should release a vid saying it’s just rock with no actual proof so that they lose all backing and support, (witch is another thought, why did everyone just stop too, dose everyone really believe everything the see on TV or Fox News??) specially giving the shape, size, drag marks, wouldn’t surprise me if there is a big secret military diving exercises going on in that area of sea to this day 😁  Nothing like a good old conspiracy theory aye, special how quick every backing drops them then the cyber threats
Extremely ironic that researchers & 'scientists' discover an anomaly which obviously wasn't formed by haphazard eons of time, had not come about without design, yet these same folks steadfastly refuse the idea of an Intelligent Designer: GOD, when they encounter irrefutable evidence of design intervention all about us.
Soft tow.....omg... Armored cable better.
Why is the Ebon Hawk at the bottom of the Baltic?
9:25 "Today's special" 😂😂😂😂
Very interesting. I hope one day you can drill deep into the object to gat more answers.
Loosing the sonar was a big blunder. No one noticed????
Super materiał. Ludzie którzy brali udział w tym odkryciu i w expedycji na zawsze zapiszą się w historii. Ryzykowali własnym zdrowiem i życiem żeby zejść w głębiny Bałtyku. Niezwykli ludzie i profesjonaliści z ogromnym doświadczeniem. Hejterzy którzy nie dorastają im do pięt, niech się walą na ryj. Dziękuję i pozdrawiam wszystkich bohaterów tego filmu.
It’s probably some weird rock formation, it is highly unlikely that aliens with the necessary tech would traverse light years to visit earth . And even if they did or will do, earth has legions of social media “influencers “ whom we can send to “influence” the aliens to give up and go home. No stress .
I know I’m late but definitely millennium Falcon
Love it! If I could 100% fund their expeditions, I would.
It's obviously The Milinum Falcon.  Daaaaa
That’s the millennium falcon
I feel the frustration for you guys. Anyone with an open mind would love to see more expeditions of this finding and analysis from this object. Maybe it’s because they’re trying to hide the truth x
Its the millennium falcon......
Even if this is nothing, I think human curiosity is always worth the efforts and I think it is miserable that there are some bunch of people being so judgmental about other individuals curiosity.   Even if that is a bunch of rocks? Even if some group of folks consider this as a loss of time? Whatever! Let people be happy, let people dream and let people that doesn't rest to go there and fight for their dreams.   I wish the best of luck for the team behind this search and really hope that they can someday find more concise answers. <3
What are the chances the navy boat sent a covert team of scuba to cut the sonar? Wish they showed the line where it "snapped"
There is LITERALLY a SKID MARK!! I mean you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to see something isn’t right here. These so called scholars aren’t as smart as they think they are.
It’s a rock formed by glaciers moving over its surface for thousands of years.
Death threats are odd
Proffesional treasure hunter?
Rubbish.
Are there any follow-up videos about this? I want to know the results of their discovery.
UFO pronounciation...hahahahahahahaha
I bet the majority of the dislikes are from people that watched this for the ~60mins, expecting an answer. Not all cases are solved, get over it.
It's the Millennium Falcon!
Who crashed the Millennium Falcon into the Baltic? 😁
Deep sea prawn nonsense
Fox news are just propaganda network
Subsea Lidar?
damn no conclusion
It is the place where tang san of doulou dalu 1 pulled out the trident and became sea god 😉
The ebonhawk!!!
This kind of mysteries are the same with people. This team tried to answer what spark their passion and curiosity and at the same time people who have nothing better to do put them down.
Its the Millennium Falcon - clearly
Just go down there man makes no sense , it's skeptical because y'all won't just go down there and see what it is
Why don't they just go down there jeezus
For the algorithm and beyond.
They found the millenium falcon
I like how dramatic this was 😂
i think all of this only proved they were closing in something, when the A**holes at Fox received the order to start silencing this expedition
It’s the Millennium Falcon.
Perhaps a dragging ship's anchor, when it was about to move, accidentally hit a hill and split it into two parts
It 's clearly the Millennium Falcon.
It's probably nothing.
"The Millenium Falcon" UFO.
I enjoyed the documentary.  I hope you guys get a sponsor.  So much unknowns in our ocean.  Best of luck!
It makes me really sad that people will be so threatening over something they know nothing about
There is a strong possibility that this is the ark of our master Noah, peace be upon him, and that its age is approximately 315 centuries. Please respond to this suggestion because it is a very important matter in research that I am conducting. Thank you.
They gave their best and for that they deserve recognition. It is a difficult project and requires serious funding. I wish wit the advent of technology it will become more affordable to dive and get core samples and have robotic diving machines employed for longer discovery times at 100 meter depths.
Shape of this rock pretty flat. Maybe concept with glacier makes sense and during the sinking it started to accelerate in two directions, that's why it looks like crash side. Imagine huge ice surface and flip of it due to imbalance. Alternative solution is meteor, but this would probably have an impact across whole sea.
It must've been a UFO that crashed and turned itself into stone to hide any evidence of finding it. That's probably how advanced they are and anything is possible.
I think humans as a whole are afraid to know what it is, we may never know but its something that not only seems out of place, it looks like a crash debri field of a solid object that came in a lt a high rate of speed. I think its very dumb that people dont want the answers of what it could be.
Maybe Musk will finance it
So it looked like concrete, untill they touched it? Yet they didnt brush all the silt off of it?  And why havent we gotten any clear footage of this thing?  Its been years!  They dont want anyone knowing what it is.
Reported for spam . Waste of time
Is that the millennium falcon 👋🤔
treasure hunt your way to my community, my people are told they do not leave me yet my people have all gone home or moved away https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDjMcl2CD7Y&t=3s how can a people who are stranded on a rock desert this concept? It functions to the best of my ability which atm is not very good I have an ability to stay alive
Its  made of concrete  not anti-gravity vehicles  😮😮
Looks like a volcano with a strike slip fault like Santorini which would be a huge find too.
The Millinium Falcon
Rename proposal: Nothing Found. Don’t Waste Your Time.
So we're supposed to believe a CGI image of a spaceship that doesn't exist 😂
I appears to be the remains of the “Mellenium Falcon” from the late spring for 1977. Just remember that “Chew-Baka” in the co-pilot’s right hand seat. May God be with you!
so thats where i parked the millenium falcon
I honestly do see a crash site of some sort that could've happened millions of years ago. Maybe a UFO or meteorite what caused  that massive crash trough a mountain , the right sponsors and funds would give us more answers to what we really want to know . If i had the money i would have definitely help find answers to this strange object
I think it's an ancient man made temple or something like that.
So what is the end result?
With all the super spy satellites 🛰 orbiting the Earth and able to photograph a golf ball from 80 miles up in  Outer Space ; I'm surprised it hasn't been scanned by LIDAR or other scanning techniques [ 3- D ] ? There might be something down there 🤔 👀 or it might be nothing at all? If it's nothing to be concerned about and poses no threat , then why have the  Swedish Navy Ship shadow the other ship ? Hmm, what's really going on here ?
You guys get the warp reactor out that dam thing 😊??? 😮
Il definitely put money towards it but want to be one of the divers..😅
If i ever hit the lottery, im paying for that thing to be raised and brought on land😮
Millennium Falcon?
Its a rock formation
Obviously Crashed Oumuamua. Obviously.
Timeline, History Channel, Discovery Cannel, all have one thing in common- they love miserable failure! It’s a Damn Rock!
Wow are people so dumb you dont realise there was whole cities now under water where do you think it came from 😂😂😂😂
It's a UFO whether people want to accept it or not I wish people would stop making excuses scientists and any Authority we the public are tired of being lied to we pay our taxes we paid everything through our nose and yet we are lied to constantly these guys that went down there to check this anomaly came up very surprised by what they found and I know that they know it's a UFO so come on authorities quit trying to fool the world
I want to believe, but I hate when people push the situation to absurd theories and conspiracies , my question is how an unusual basalt disk like formation was an alien ship ?, or a lost city 60 meter in diameter ? I even heard a vip from an important agency that it had a cockpit and hidden rooms inside of it , and still all you see are sketches and artistic renditions and still no “real” footage .🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Its almost exact replica of Millennium Falcon on star wars movie
Looks like a large skipping stone that was thrown across the world and violently hit the floor of the sea/ocean. Like when an meteorite comes in at a shallow angle skids to a stop.
Spaceship 🪐🛸🕳️👽🗿 Which is why the demons made everyone believe it’s fake rock 💯
fastest ship in the galaxy. One capable of doing the famed Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs
Why are the wasting time searching for a place they've already been didn't they mark a satnav coordinate?
The Millennium Falcon has been found?
Gee and I thought FOX "news" only did damage in the US. 😡😡😡
Am I the only one whom thought it looked like the millennium falcon?
Is this the ocean between Ukraine and Russia?
Why does NATO not want you to investigate this crash site?? This fact and the response to all sites around the world like this meets with the same response from government and the military. This make's me think this is a UAP crash site.  Covering  up finds like this make me doubt government and NATO.
It's not like it's impossible to be other worldly object ,I mean you would have to be mad to think we are the only place with life.
perhaps a ship,we have concrete ships now
U people that have the need to help the one's that are doing a good deed for naleg.
I believe they found a UFO.
There are an awful lot of stupid people in the comments section. It is a rock and no, it is not important.
You made an hour long video on a funny shaped rock.
if you look closely you can see lockness swim by & wave a flipper
That should have been a lot more interest in making sure what that is.  I find it funny that no governments saw fit to finance more research. At the least,  None admit to have been down there checking it out!   With all the interest it's undersea discovery generated.    Why don't we know more about it? Why is It always the same video?  The media hyping it up then running it down, without anyone interested in knowing for sure.  Seems a little too convenient.  Can I be willing to bet a bunch of dollars there are military vessels already flew over the top of that baby or sailed over or  underseas.  This whole thing stinks of hiding something. Like the location of Flight 370 All Local military is involved the ships submarines the commercial ships the commercial aircraft someone would have seen what was going on or they knew where it hit the water at by acoustic means.  Mysteries the government's claim they know nothing about, their militaries mostly likely are involved or at the least aware of whatever happened.
Was ein scheiß Bericht, ist das nötig den ganzen Unsinn die nebensächlichen Sachen zu zeigen?? Die Anomalie und nicht die Bootsfahrt und wie das Wetter ist. Das interessiert niemanden 😂😂😂
I’m not finished watching but it looks like a tanker has dumped a load of cement off the ship.
It’s part of a bait tank from  a 1960’s sport fishing boat😮
Looks like a disc shaped asteroid hit the earth at a tangent travelling at a speed similar to earth’s rotation. Something like Oumuamua spotted in 2017. Which, while possibly cylindrical, could have been a disc. Such an object hitting the ocean at the correct angle, with a relatively low speed could produce this structure. It would need to have been travelling in the same direction as earths rotation. Well done to these guys pursuing this project.
Did you guys ever think that this object that you found is in fact a UAP that is covered with molten rock from an ancient volcano that spit it out eons ago?Think about it,many individuals have reported the coming and goings of UAPs from volcanos for centuries?So, what's to say that it's not a UAP covered in molten rock from a volcano that spit it out from its depth eons ago?If you ask me,that would explain a lot.There's no way that's a natural formation!I believe my hypothesis is certainly more realistic than the claims that it's a natural formation! That's absurd!The implications that it's a natural formation is ridiculous!What you need to do is get some money together and start chipping away at that  layer of molten rock that's encased that UAP!
I’ve never understood the unwanted approach to curiosity. Why wouldn’t you want to know.
This has been solved years ago. It's a big rock. And that's all it is.
The Falcon
Wow...absolutely fascinating. 🤯🤯🤯...it is SERIOUSLY disgusting, sad, and infuriating how the criminal mainstream media so viciously attacked them. Along with the COMPLETELY unnecessary physical threats. 🤮😢🤬🤬  I have NO doubt alot of that was orchestrated by the damn criminal government themselves to keep this discovery well hidden. 🤔...I really would not be surprised if the government already knows exactly what it is. 🤔  I truly hope they don't give up. 😢...going off the available images, ESPECIALLY that clear image, there is NO WAY its merely just a natural formation...simply NO FREAKING WAY. 🤔..  I really wish I had the wealth to finance them myself, I seriously would if I could. 😞...I wonder if they tried reaching out to Elon Musk. He seems like someone who would be open to financing something of this magnitude.
It not a space craft it is just a natural image,I watched the actual men that researched it
Never give up guys ,,  i can SENSE what it is , as you do too .
Its the antenna disc from a Orian sub aircraft.
Did anyone else brush there screen thinking there was something on it?
Shipping Wessel love it!
UFO or not still interesting
The millennial Falcon is real…I knew it
It's a rock
Tieši par to domāju, kur ir palicis man kosmosa kuģis 🤔 A te i😀
We know we know, is a ufo from outerspace from the bronze age plato atlantis gobegli tepe
I can't believe some would threatened someone for trying to find something of great importance.
It’s nothing…absolutely nothing. It natural just like the photos from Mars.
It’s nothing…absolutely nothing. It natural just like the photos from Mars.
I have footage that you may find very, very interesting in regards to this unidentified object under the Baltic Sea. I have several photos of the same object up close just last month and during a severe lightning storm. I know you think I'm crazy and lying. However, I have the proof. If we can connect, I would love to discuss this further.
Looks like the millennium falcon
If it were real the Swedish government would have already brought it to the surface.
If I hit the powerfully for a good amount you guys will be getting a call from me.
Get some frigging subs down there!
USO, NOT UFO
Where is the part 2
Interesting, yes. Yes! 100% Just for some commentators: yeah, ancient, still visible, "crash site". The ship is still there. The mass of basic rock literally turns liquid. But ship? Noo! With such an impulse, yes, it just can "clap" like a hand and stay on the surface. Sure. And every metallic asteroid will tell you that's absolutely so) UFO topic like a main (and far too early) pre-conclusion is just a way to "viral", "unboring for unaware masses", maybe way to find private money and the "red flag" from scientific points of view a the same time  And I guess you know it
আমাৰ জীৱন কালত এনে কৌতুহল  পূৰ্ণ প্ৰযুক্তিগত পৰ্যবেক্ষণ চাবলৈ পোৱাটো,সকলোতকৈ সৌভাগ্যৰ কথা
The marks look like the ones glacial depositions have.
LOL the thumbnail looks nothing like the actual lump of rock this is.
Black coatings? Metal sulphates/sulphites?
There is a triangle on one side. Therefore it is man made.
This was a major waste of time.
Raise it and find out.
Whishfull thinking here ,  lets Start a Foundation to raises ton of funds  ,  this could be one solution  among  many other ..  Yes !!???
Well, duh, HELLO. Go back to that site & do a deep dive to find out. MYSTERY SOLVED.
Drain the ocean
Well duh! It's the Millennium Falcon. 😎
❤❤❤❤❤
So they didn’t take GPS co:ordinates when they first found it.
it's the millennium falcon!!! All right Chewy you didn't forget about me..... lol
whatever it is, it seems to have aroused people's curiosity, so why are they scammers? Don't we all want to find out
The famous  Rob Parson quote 'if you don't give up ,you cant fail"
Looks like a Kilrathi ship for those that know what I’m talking about.
Star Wars spaceship...
Todays date. 3-3-25. Haha. I bet everyone is changing their minds now.
It's said by some that this is a natural formation of rock.  How does a perfectly formed circle, like the one at the front of the object, form naturally.  It doesn't.
https://youtu.be/5buyBJfYLZM?si=hJdy352tVfr5bcJV
I think it’s just a part of a wall that fell down from megastructures that were built before the flood when the Annunaki ruled these worlds
There are thousands of above ground objects all over the planet that look like tractors, airplanes, buildings, etc., but are beyond recognition as we know them, even space ships and submarines. This object is just another one, and all are pre flood objects and structures.
🇫🇷.  I think there is too much square form on this (( disc form )) for to be an natural stone bloc .
Hello from France 🇫🇷🙋🏻Vous êtes des héros d'avoir essayé ! Et si cet objet est vraiment en métal ou quil se révèle être un vaisseaux spatial alors vous serrez les plus grands populaire team du Siècle !!!! Et le film de science fiction qui peut se faire avec votre histoire pourra faire de bonnes entrées ! Et rembourser bien des peines ....🪙💶💸💰💶💷
He don't know why theses volcanic rock are under  the Baltic ocean "** 🤔if it's only the stone by lava volcanic it's important to drill it !
Courageux Plongeurs cecserait mieux d'envoyer le Rover avec le bras perceur,,, mais attention si cest vraiment un appareil ..percer sa coque pourrait être dangereux // Courageux Plongueurs....this thing was dive in Vulcan Lava before falling in cold Ocean ok ...but that Form stay bizarre ..with some edge and others forms géométric ...it's not natural // cet appareil s'était donc tombé dans la lave d'un volcan et a  ensuite continué sa courses dans l'océan car la chaleur aurait détruit la machine de motricité...intérieur c'est bien possible mais ( ce que j'écris n'est qu'une Hypothèse... évidement...
Stone or not stone there is the Question 🤔🙋🏻
It’s the millennium falcon and luke is inside. help o b wan Kenobe. 😂
Chewy! We're going to crash! Find a spot! (Chewbacca language) Aho Oh, Oh, Oh... (Han) There! That looks like a good spot! Everyone brace for impact!  (Impact) the dust settles. Where do you think we are Han? I dont know but one things for sure, we're in a galaxy far, far, away from our own.... That jump into hyperspace was out of this world. 😂🤣😔
This was found in 2012 and it STILL is advertised as a new find. WTF. Scientists won't touch this. It's too real.
Fox News was probably paid to squash this story! UFO coverup.
Saw the guys that spotted this. They ended up going down. Unbelievably it was a weird rock.
I think the word we're looking for is "click bait"
Don't give up!
Hi there I also see a crash sight with the 3d last  scanning at the end of the video
the millennium falcon
They found the Millennium Falcon
Stupid 😂 all cause it resembles the millennium falcon 😂😂😂 stupid 😂😂😂😂
Spoilt by the dramatic music
The majority call FOX news FOX entertainment because they repeatedly proved they lie for $
How cares how much costs or what you did. Answers
very interesting and curious well done
it was torpedoed by Government disinformation to prevent the truth from coming out; fake news operation.  The physical threats confirm that....Elon should step in to fund it.
Of course it’s a spaceship. Open it up and you’ll find a Wookiee
Ok... Let's assume it is volcanic origin. Then: 1) Why are there so many straight lines and 90 degree angles? 2) What on earth made the water temperature drop down to -1°C just above it? Water is in it's densest state at 4°C. 3) What made the stone "fairy ring"? It must have emerged after the last ice age. 4) It's in the middle of tectonically passive area called "Baltic shield". There has not been volcaninc activity in almos 2 billion years. It should not exist any more.
This was a waste of my time.
I dont know why no one builds some automatically inflatable ballon to these sonars/ROV's, which start to work if contact with the surface is lost.........
supergrover
Now ...when someone else finds something...they be afraid to tell anyone...how backwards people are!
Fossilized organic vessel.
57:30min -  bla-bla-bla. 00:04min - there it is
They should bring it up very slowly incase there are aliens sleeping in their hypersleep pods inside. 👽
1:49 in, just done the intro, already predicting is just rock formation and people wasted nearly a decade of ridiculous money wasting time and energy lol
Guys, I wish I could be a millionaire  to finance this project. It's a shame that so many millionaires out there expending millions in trivial things and not wanting to sponsor such a discovery.
looks like a phillys helment
I believe the gentleman who found the unknown, are true . They finding a  treasure of difference, makes it an obstacle to the world . Never , NEVER let people of ignorance, threaten Your gift in exploring the truth . For if You do find the truth, it sets you free. !   If You don’t know , then You just don’t know … simple . Thanks for the sharing , I wished I could help , just remember….. NEVER GIVE UP IN WHAT YOU DO…What You DO ….            IS YOU ❤
Its the millineum falcon
It is really good. Coz its a real story with big money spent and big efforts❤
First thing i thought.. millennium falcon
if government say its natural and keep you away. then its mean its something
mysteries everywhere as human beings
It needs exploring further.
This is might be a large burnt coral because of volcanic eruption when the water or ocean is low
They took it out the water 😂u think the men in black going to let regular people find out about the unknown
The abuse you received was disgusting.  Keep at it guy's, I for one, am interested in your future ventures .  🇬🇧
I saw this flying over me, once.
No one coule identify? Thats millenium falcon
0:49 Its Millennium Falcon!
The millennium falcon
4.6 million views at the start of 2025... yet just 5,855 comments before mine. Civilization itself is the biggest mystery of all and this task you all have accomplished is nothing short of amazing. I choose to believe and I too see it as a crash site. Cheers to the future and to the safety of you and your loved ones. I hope those that threatened your children were found and dealt with appropriately.
The filthy cult that runs the world is behind all your troubles, they will not let you expose truths because in so doing you will expose their lies and they themselves. They don't have much time left anyway.
It looks like the Melenium falcon
rescue diver bruh is Aquaman from parallel universe
Stan Meyer found a way to use resonance to boost the bond strength of water molecules, (similar to Brown’s Gas) when broken with pressure, released energy to drive pistons and eliminate contaminants in piston. No electrolysis or purification needed., designed fuel injector to transform water, killer, cheap and quick upgrade. Probably powered by implosion, not explosion for higher speeds and longer cooler engine wear.
Dang bro how'd the Millennium Falcon get down there?
A complete waste of time.
It's just a strange face
I remember when I first heard of this back in the day. I've always believed it was from out of this world.  I remember something about the age of it being extremely old like 400,000 years old or something or even older. I've always wondered what happened to the search of it I would fund it if I had that kinda money.
Sunken? How do you know that it's Sunken?
DON'T BE DECEIVED THESE SO CALLED ALIENS ARE PURE EVIL DEMONIC ENTITIES AND UFOs/UAPs ARE FALLEN ANGEL TECHNOLOGY ALWAYS REBUKE THEM IN THE NAME OF JESUS AND ALWAYS CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST TO BE SAVED
FALLEN ANGEL TECHNOLOGY
Oak island 🙄
Куча патетики и трагизма на пустом месте👎👎👎
Like Anatolly.
It’s the Millennium Falcon!
Yes I do believe that the rock is volcanic but maybe that rock was shaped into the shape that has buy some people back hundreds or thousands of years and used it for flying it looks like some sort of a ship you got to remember that these kinds of rocks will withstand anything up in the heavens I mean comets they withstand fire.
Humans are so unkind and so ignorant. It's good to know and understand expeditions of our earth underneath above and in space. People can be cruel. Keep the dream and the goal and go forward there are many that appreciate this. Godspeed.
Two sets of stairs one set angles in the front of it and a smaller set at the back....also it looks as if there is a entrance...they said it felt like concrete but when they rubbed the sediment off of it it was black....this reminds me of what happens to precious metals from a old ship wreck......they need to go back down and make sure they can give it more time
Looking at the picture for the video it looks like towards the backside of it there are steps of some kind...
🙄 OBVIOUSLY its the Millennium Falcon🤷‍♂️
That thang looks like it could travel the Kessel run in a little less than 12 parsecs!
Don't be silly, it appeared months later that the creator of Starlike and the movie Titanic went there with the equipment and built this Starlink there. You guys have weak memory and information
Fox News... MAGA media machine...
Looks like one of those drones flying over NJ in 2024
As for Fox News and American opinions they think they know everything that they’re so smart sad part is the world falls for it !! SO SAD
Who believes Fox News REALLY THEY FOUND SOMETHING AND “ THEY “ don’t want it researched  bssssss
Is that Millennium Falcon??
Uk might be able to help the government are giving money away like water.
It's the millennium falcon!
1:00 The Millennium Falcon. 🙂
Nothing but wishers wishing ! It's a mound on the bottom of the ocean with a fisure running through it . Be adults about nature 😱
Hello, if you are still in a search for  sponsorship . Let me know.  I maid be interested to get in to this whole mess.  If not best of luck. ✌️ Denis you are absolutely correct it looks like a crash site of some kind.
Well it's obviously the millennium falcon, from along time ago in a galaxy far far away......😐
Nowadays when you do good and meaningful things you became a laughing stock. It only goes to show that only a handful people who do good things to be better for everyone.
Są jakieś nowe informacje w tej sprawie???
I believe there is something more than meets the eye here.  If I had the money I would definitely 💯 sponsor y'all.   But I'm broke.
All about Drama !
Natural  Rocks? What I'm guessing
Looks like a meteorite from the 3D image. Their initial guess was right. Came in shallow
This is possibly an ancient craft that crashed during an ancient ancient ancient nuclear war 👌,
I really hope these guys get a chance to discover the truth about this anomaly, even though some incredible ignorant and small minded people have a problem with that.
build a tube  around it  pump the water out  then go down when it dry  and take a look
shape is millenium falcon
Things cannot come from so called outer Space!  The Historical Book,The Bible will tell you that!  It is Terrestrial possibly,Fallen Angel Tech! From a Very long time ago!The outer crust is used as Heat Shield.
It's a foundation to a very old homestead
Have they had any success since the making of this video? I want to know more.  Even if it is a pile of rocks.  People who are criticizing these people are not adventurous.  They don't realize that there is still a  lot to discover in the world.  To these guys it's like reading a book and just as it's getting good the book is unfinished.  Imagine playing your favorite video game and have it end in the middle cause it's not finished and have no idea if it ever will. I hope they find funding.
It's the Millinieum Falcon!😂
Absolutely zero footage of "the object."      Hahahahah
I can save every one a whole lot of time and money, the object at the bottom of the sea is a big rock, yah I know you want to believe its more , but trust me its a big rock that some how does look a little like an UFO.  QED
Waste of time video!
Never give up.
The government already know that is why spoiled all the investigation.  But someday we will know. The true always comes to surface.
We don't know what it is so we think it's a ufo
Depending on the ground material, being melted that quick and reset would be like vulcanic rock.
And we're still no further forward
Misinformation  and getting shut by MIB.  True True
This is "The Raft" a prison  mean't to contain super powered individuals.
A rock...
Why don't they send a submersible?
You can have any situation,  all situations will attract attention ,  evern , simply put a person who minds their own business  , attracts a situation where people create a atmosphere around them , leading to the most horrible accusations against that person  , kids mucking about with computers in their bedrooms  , a cults and their peculiar behaviour,  take the recent Israeli situation  oct 7th 2023 and onwards  , with two-faced people deliberately advocating circumstances to meda change the truth , you have woman that gossip and destabilise,  people just carry a demonic attitude and will go out their way with no provocation to harm ANYTHING  . Stay focused  , and from my perspective  , their is alot of interesting uniformity to the shape that really does require answering,
All you alien conspiracy theorists out there should be donating big time to this research... Or are you afraid that it really might be one of those aliens depicted in blockbuster movies? 😄
Ask Elon, he would love to finance it, aspecially when you also have an X in your logo )
The cut to the chase 35:00
it's the millennium falcon. no explanation needed
Is that the millennium falcon?
Then I guess it is Alien
There are so many haters in our world, never give up looking for answers. May you and your families  be safe also. Good luck guys....
We’re  smoked? lol something tells me that’s not what he actually said.
If there was something like that it would have been lifted up by know,so flying objects false
HALO plasma cannon?
U must know that the USA will take over and kick U off site
Why involve anyelse in your find
Why you in involve any body else
Why you not drag that to the top !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Massive waste of time. No answers.
People need to keep covering this topic. There is a lot going on right now and we want to know the truth. The recent hearing in congress discussed USOS and UFOs. Whistle-blowers are saying we are not alone, there are crash retrieval programs and non-human intelligence.
I wished people wasn't so keen to jump conclusions about someone or something they know nothing about. They have put their heart, soul, and reputation on the line and for what??? To get beat down? Mocked? I wish them well, and to those who are mocking them...Is your life so pitiful and blank that you need to mock and make fun of others to get the attention off you??? Stay in your lane if you have nothing nice to say, say NOTHING
Well, its 2024 and we have disclosure. So how about this object gets more attention?
I believe that they found something but really don't know what it is in real life. I hope someone steps up and help them out int finding the real answers. Keep up the spirits guy. Something will come along. I also see a crash site. Be it meteorite or space ship. We will not know until you get to return to the site and do some more work.......
There's really no excuse for why we don't know what this thing is yet. I'm not blaming these dudes- I'm blaming human civilization as a whole. Whether it's still unidentified due to a lack of financing, resources or cooperation, then that just tells me there's a lack of will. Where are the world's governments? Academic institutions? Billionaires?
Apparently the object is 140,000 years old. the Baltic Sea was created around 14,000 years ago by the flooding of melting glaciers. At around 54:48. You can see that it hit an underwater mountain (that may have not been underwater at the time of the crash) because like I mentioned the anomaly is much older than the sea itself, so I say all that, to say this. This may have been an above ground ufo crash that was flooded over and long forgotten. Also, if you look at the front of the anomaly you can see where it looks like the front was broken off by something (maybe when it hit that mountain)
This might be far fetched to most but the answer to what it is just come to me, and when things like this happen, I’m yet to know them to be wrong, and from what it shows in this actually credits what I was given.  It’s a weapons mould for ancient giants. It explains the volcanic stone removed from it and if you actually look at the shapes within it, they actually depict weapons.   The threats made to you is probably from the same people that did the Bali bombings to destroy evidence coming threw there from people who were trying to show the world the truth.
It's nothing more than a profile of the Master Chief's helmet.
ohhhh Thats where i left my Millennium Falcon
im here to teach so thats what il be doing
the remaining ship ended that fight over Earth as they are awsome ultimate war machines built by tho
i dont know why you all dont remember that youve already had your starwars like technology many times before now
resembles a star cruiser, as it should
beautiful ships
looks like the one thats missing , the other is still docked in its bay under the sphinx, three sphinx three ships to guard the world while they were away.  one obliterated by enemies one drown one still functional, last deployment was durring comet hail bop. know you know. they are self aware ships no need for pilots
bulshit! !!!! Nesze semmi, fogd meg jól!
I think this is a spaceship made from stone. Like the polygonal masonry we see in Peru (Sacsayhuamán, for example), where it appears as someone made these walls with a different concrete mix, than ours. Imitating natural rock, like granite. Creating alloys, mineral alloys, not metal alloys which we are familiar with. A spaceship made from stone (maybe it was built in space) is logical, for the stone will be an excellent insulator for temperature, maybe from radiation too.
I think it is a ufo that crashed into the ocean, its black because it was probably burning thru earths atmoshere before it crashed. It may look like cement, but I doubt it is, who knows how many thousands of years it has been down there, it could have solidified over the years from the interaction of the ocean and whatever the object is made of. It could be made from some substance we have never seen.
It looks like the melenium falcon
han solo's ship ...finally found .....
It is quite clearly a large boat that has 'Spatchcocked' flat to the bottom!
I feel mixed, both ways.  I hope you eventually receive the assistance you require.  Peace.
DONT  WORRY   YOU   WONT   FIND   OUT   THEY   DO   NOT   WANT   YOU   TO,
Could you work from a Diving Bell at that Depth,  I am not a Crank, I`m a Businessman.
There’s something down there  That’s what happens when someone finds something
I am quite certain, that formation is in truth, an ancient structure/building and nothing more. Otherwise, it could just be a case of irony, in that over time, the ocean currents formed it from a rock formation. Ancient alien spaceship n stuff?? .......extremely doubtful .
I’m curious, have none of them seen Star Wars?
That’s how Deep state works… they don’t want you to know the truth
It is baffling that volcanologists are not more interested in these features. The underwater 3d images look like it was a failed rift or something
looks like Millennium Falcon
Somebody wanted this buried  . That makes me believe they are right over the target .
That could either be spies from our kind/ dimension,spies from advanced cloaked cities living beside ours,people from beyond the ice wall or under ground..as well as off world intell non humans.
In case Europeans are not aware, Fox News is not actual journalism. It is a propaganda machine for the American right.
Fantastic??? What’s happening now 2024
I think it's the bottom half of a sphinx monument
I also am an expert in undersea anomalies. It is a dooplewhoopleganger. A spiritual dancing ground for the illusive sea fairies.
These men are genuine and the critics are afraid of reality or what the truth looks like. That my friend is an actual alien crash site a quarter mile long. A meteor would have left a much larger fingerprint. Need to bring her up ?
I know what it is! Millennium Falcon.
Awesome video would like to learn more about that area
Good luck to these explorers and I really hope one day we will all know what this is.
I seen that it looks like the millennium falcon from Star Wars. Well it looks like it cut a notch through the mountain behind it that would generate a lot of heat and explains the melted rocks at the ship or whatever it is.  The problem I see with a lot of people is if they didn’t build it, it doesn’t exist and since they can’t build anything then if somebody else did then that’s scary so we can’t talk about it so it doesn’t exist because they would be afraid so there is no god no aliens and nobody has ever done or seen anything that they might be afraid of which is just about everything except for children digging out lithium with their bare hands because that’s going to save the planet by making lots of money for china and they can sleep easy knowing they saved the world and it you find out that there are space ships in the ocean and some in Antarctica and cities under the oceans in different parts of the world they don’t want to hear about it and will threaten you for finding out about it because they don’t want to hear about things they don’t believe in. It’s sad we have way to many people like that around unfortunately but I hope you do find funding to help with your discovery’s they found some others like that near India and I’ve herd that the government took over the site looking for advanced technology but there is nothing there so don’t look but they took it over and say there’s nothing there which seem like a lot of trouble if there’s nothing there😱🤫🤐🙄
It's a giant metal placard that reads "made in China"
Henry Ford said that if you drain all oceans . At the bottom of one of them you will find Railway Tracks .
I hate social media they are cruel and have no better purpose in life than to hurt others. Keep up the good work. It is fascinating what you do. Thank you for the work you do!
Yeah, its rock and a glacier carved it. Water currents sand and rock craved the holes. Got them in rivers over here. No U-FO
Looks like the Millennium Falcon.
Typical government misinformation .
What if it was a UFO fossil ? 🤫
It's a rock🎉
you never herd of the millennian falcon?
I've followed this for years, and honestly, if the sea level was 400ft lower back at the ice age, I was convinced that it's either an out of this world craft or something from a previous civ.
Is a space 🚀 ship.
This is an interesting story. I love it.
IT'S a ufo that came out of a volcano which then crashed into the sea hence the volcanic crust .
Hmmmmmmm🤔
And then...............................drama 52:28
And then........................drama 11:17
And then............................drama 4:44
It's definitely the Millennium Falcon
A piece of a SpaceX satellite?.
Master Chief Helmet
The sunken city of dwarka in india, the yonaguni underwater structure in japan, the bimini road in bahamas, the Azores underwater pyramid , for me all of them are human made and should not be there,  for the scientists its all natural, don't you see a pattern here ? Our history is being purposely hidden from us.
Last vue shows the answer. It realy looks as a fast stop of something that flies under the water. The reason, why you only found molten stone, is that - what ever it has been - is now away, and you only watching on a „footprint“. Now you should find out, from what situation came the heat, that melted the stone underneath the object - the energy of stoping, or the energy of start egain from the surface…
Thank you comments for saving me a whole lot of time.
we've known about in the mainstream now for close to 20 years, yet u rarely see or hear it mentioned anymore. they want this discussion silenced.
Halo Master chief helmet?
It never fails as something always causes a time element with these adventures.
4.3 million hits. If everyone contributed just 50 euro cents to the cause, they could continue this extraordinary adventure.
Why don't you forget about this object. It is just like the English who always start with Stone Henge and before people with Crop circles and conclude nothing.
Shida siku izi pesa mingi wanapeleka kwa vita badala ya kufwatilia mambo kama hii
It was originally  found in 2011. By deep sea divers
Obviously that last landing place of the Millennium Falcon.
it's............... a clickbait object!
A. Ufo. That. Crashed. Eon's. Ago. Before. The. Sea. Was. At. That. Level 3:48
I don't know why the negative comment or it's replies exist. Thoroughly dangerous work they performed.I found it extremely interesting. Thank you.
0:43 YT-1300 Millennium Falcon
A weapon maybe could be ancient
Ebon hawk
Hitlers sace ships ...IFOs identified flying objects
This is a waste of time. I have gained nothing by watching this. How does this have so many views?
Fox News,,, that’s the problem
A TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME ! And, You all wasted others money !!!
This opening is pretty silly.  The image looks like a movie prop from Star Wars, it is a uso -> unidentified sunken object.  There’s nothing about it that suggests it could fly.  I’ll keep watching.  Maybe they’ll find a Wookie skeleton.
It's absolutely nothing out there!
Millennium Falcon
Divers are friking awesome.    Thanks
He found a bunch of rocks. And created all this drama, well done. Treasure hunting is expensive. And somehow the need revenue. And here we go
Lmao 🤣 okie dokie you just solved all the stuff no one else has. And I bet you also believe everything the government says . Oh let's not forget about all those history books. Ahhhh the same history that is so one sided and only tell their version of history. If anyone 35 45 age range went sat in a class today, you'd be thinking, that ain't what they told us. Ya left out the part there are spots Antarctica that are all blurry out and why does the space station cut the feed over Antarctica? Oh yeah u also left out no one is allowed to fly over it and since when does Russia China and American sign any treaty with each other not to mention all the other countries who followed suit. And only people allowed to go there , like free roam there not a controlled visit is military and scientists who also sign no disclosure contracts. Yeah dnt think be back to ur channel. I bet we came from apes also and the universe was made by a big bang and all this just appeared out of nowhere. 😂😂😂😂😂
Millennium Falcon 1
That thumbnail is clearly master chiefs helmet.
I wish you luck. Don't ever give up.
The simplest and most comfortable explanation for this phenomenon is as follows. Evil Soviet Russians from the Kremlin had this manufactured during the Cold War and deposited it with submarines at the bottom of the Baltic Sea to confuse the Swedes. This was part of a grand plan to demoralize the decadent capitalists who believe in spaceships and aliens.😂😂😂😂😂
Tell you the first time I heard this story my heart was crushed. AND again, just Israel today, my government is to blame ! Now they want to tell the truth? but it's too late for the damage they caused these poor fellows who really wanted to show us the truth!
Millennium falcon
It's the original crash site of the planet of the apes that we evolved out of and when we can go faster than the speed of light it will all happen again.
I hope these guys also realize that they have already done a great service to mankind in general just from the research they have done so far. The object is really frickin interesting and NO ONE else showed it to us. So for that, on behalf of all the positive-type minded people on this planet, we thank you. May the Lord bless you and your families guys.
"Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds" - Albert Einstein. I would think at an absolute minimum it would have a great deal of historical value. Be it geological, geographical, etc. Don't let the naysayers get you down guys. The world needs more people like these fine gentlemen looking into this kind of stuff.
I know what it is and its at least 20.000years old.
Why send down divers and put them at risk ?  Just send down probes with cameras and lights to investigate this so  called anomaly ?
It's the machine that made all that precision stonework in 4500 BC.
It's obviously the Millenium Falcon. Idiots....
https://youtu.be/6_nHg31OMas?si=0FMIS26B_js5jgKY
Sad they weren't allowed to follow up. Just shows you they were on to something important. Same thing happened in the "copper scroll project" when they figured out where the treasure was, started digging at qumran, and was told to stop when they just about got down far enough.  The same happened with the ancient city off Cuba.  No one was allowed back out there. But sonar proved it was there.
It's a construction site for a temple that's been submerged from the great catastrophe that happened before the ice age
its probably some sort of old soviet sub defence object might even still be classified
I bet it was the government who doesn't want them back there. I mean why would it be a navy ship there ?
JUST go to 55 mins and save watching the bull💩
They need investors now!
Before the North Sea existed the Baltic also wasn’t there. So, man made? Without a doubt. Megalithic architecture is common the world over. Why burned? Same event that created the North Sea probably. And that left the north eastern part of the North American continent looking as it does. Some kind of solar event/micronova. There’s burned and melted stonework in Egypt and South America.
How many years ago was this? And still no video or photos? How long are you guys going to milk this?
It was a Pokémon
People fail to understand that there were, have been, and will be cataclysms to come.  Maybe this is a remnant of technology destroyed by a polar shift, and resulting  plate tectonic shifts minutely going on all the time.  Love documentaries to see ne research on any subject.
YOU IS A SMART ONE!!!   KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!  GOD BLESS!!
It looks like the thing at the west side of starbuck island
It's The Millenium Falcon
Agent vimana that bring sea animals in to the our world to survive.
But it still looks it IS A OLD CAP of something...
good luck guys xx
Looks like a landing . You are not crazy you are right in your thinking . The people that wrecked you dream are IDIOTS
I remember how upset I was and disheartened that there are so many idiots out there that totally ruined the chances of what this is. I was upset that had I been Rich , I would have given Millions to find out. I feel so sad about the men who wanted to find the truth but had their hands tied. The sad thing is people are finding it now and acting like they discovered it themselves. I jump in and comment and tell them all the truth. The dang thing was found 13 yrs ago ,by you 😢😢😢
Meteorite ...possibly ✌️🍁🌲
Meantime keep up good work♡
Could it be part of a space-ship
Still think it's a:UFO maybe a portal of sorts?!!Ppl r afraid of the unknown,they don't want 2want to know,pls takecare❤*
Speak to ELON MUSK. MPK.
Why dont military submarines go there and take  a look, it will costs nothing for them,  or maybe they already been there and there are nothing to collect?
That's what it looks like to me......a crash sight.  Wish I knew how it was going with the diving on this. Any update???  If I had the money I would invest to help the cause.
Looks like the Millennium Falcon to me.
have fox news been down there?? i think not…so how can they make such comments,and as for threatening you and family,that’s so wrong!!! i don’t know what you’ve found but think it could be interesting regardless of what it is…wether it’s a geological anomaly or something else…it’s all good…best wishes 😊
I had Chat GPT to summarise this transcript:  The YouTube video you saw involves a discussion with a psychic medium, Liz Cross, about the mysterious Baltic Sea anomaly, a structure discovered by Swedish treasure hunters in 2011. Many have speculated it could be a UFO, a natural glacial deposit, or something else. According to Liz, using psychic abilities, the object isn't natural or a UFO but a part of something else, a device meant to gather information beneath the Earth's surface.  Here are the key points from the transcript:  Origins: The object isn't from Earth but was created by extraterrestrial beings from a distant galaxy. These beings don't understand space and time as we do, indicating their origin is from a place without these constructs.  Purpose: The object was intended to be a data collector, designed to gather information beneath the Earth's surface, though it ended up in the wrong location (the sea floor) due to incorrect coordinates.  Structure: The anomaly acts like a transmitter and absorbs energy, but there are no biological or energetic entities within it. It was dropped on Earth by a larger craft and has been on the seabed for 50,000-100,000 years.  Creators: The beings who built it use advanced technology akin to 3D printing, but with metals and complex materials. They are energy beings who require physical objects like this anomaly to penetrate Earth's surface and gather data.  Motivation: These beings are researching how to create souls, which they see as the key to power and domination. They want to understand the mechanics of the soul to 3D print and manufacture them, fueling their existence.  Conflict: The beings are engaged in a larger existential struggle, trying to gain an advantage by manipulating soul energy, which they cannot naturally create. Their primary limitation is they need physical structures to gather certain types of information from Earth.  In essence, the Baltic Sea anomaly is part of a complex, long-term alien research project aimed at studying Earth and its souls.  If you want to watch the video: https://youtu.be/D-w1zDel2sw?si=qoCjjn5NKJdaf0YJ
You guys should reach out to Graham Hancock! Looks like an ancient structure and he would be very interested!!
How come no one else knows that you can google it and get the cords? Also, how come people never look at the long skid mark that started a long ways off, and the skid grows wider with more seabed build up in the direction of the skid? And what about the fairy ring on top of it?
It's a rock, simple as that... people are just crazy
I FOUND THE ANSWER AND ITS A SPACE CRAFT THAT HAS TURNED TO  STONE,    I DONT KNOW COMPLETLY BUT ITS SOMETHING LIKE CARBON OR SILICA THAT REACTS WITH THE WATER AND  BECOMES A TYPE OF CONCRETE IN THE WATER........
It looks like it might be some sort ort of prediluvian (now under water) construction from c. 5000+ years ago. Such construction allegedly can be found off the Eastern Coast of Russia and Southeast of Okinawa. (Those are the ones I'm aware of.)
I don't understand why some people feel it is necessary to threaten others and their families for any reason, especially  hunters of truth who are trying to further humanity's progression into the future.
Finally the Millennium Falcon has been found
Amazing !
We are  never going to hear from this object again.
Well, it is a sunken ship for sure... but it must be in a thousand years old spaceship that crashed a long time ago that it turned into rock...😅😅😅
Rock scoured by glacier in the last ice-age? Mysteries are created by people who don't understand something, or it is beyond their level of their experience and knowledge... It is good to ask questions
when something is found and some one doesnt want it known then slander , intimidation and doubt  soon show up it looks to me like powerful people dont want this object to be explained …..
Could it be a Heat Shield?
0:44 come on...thats clearly the Millennium Falcon. Enigma solved...
it was just the way the rock looks
I'm sure I'm not the first to identify the Han Solo's ship
Dig around and don’t give up what’s really underneath.👁️❤️🙏
Oh gee........only men......... There's no equality.......Man are better at everything.
Total wastage of time. Nothing is in this video. They just found out people who just threw stones in the specific point of the North area for measuring their locations, hunting and catching fish in the ancient times.
Look's Like the Millennium Falcon.🤣
Good thing I fast forwarded to the last couple of minutes of this video.  Garbage.
Wether it’s just rocks, a volcano or something man made it doesn’t matter it’s all more information on our wonderful 🌍 planet
Nice to know the government is keeping that area safe and off limits
If i hit the lotto these guys getting at least 5 million from me
Eff fox.This was deliberate,a blatant attempt to hide the truth. Just like the guy who found mermaids,they destroyed his entire life. 15 years later Arctic explorers caught one on video. The cabals want us blind and dumb.The corporate Cabals want to be the highest authority,so they supress all knowledge of anything outside the status quo
Concrete that changes color when you touch it,AND changes temp of water to below freezing🤨. They didnt answer the question because theyd come up missing if they did
Doesn't look anything like a rock! Seems someone wanted to cover this up!
It a water tower the round part 😂😂😂
If it had already been discovered, couldn't they have taken a GPS reading so they could find it easily when they went back? How come they didn't know precisely where it was?
It's deffo the Falcon like from a galaxy far far away
Oahua or what was that large thing what people thought first was asteroid, before it suddenly speeded away. It was like stone but had intelligent design. Good camoflage and protects the ship in entering athmosphere.
It's  metal after travelling near light speed. Micro asteroids pummel the surface on longer travels.
Yep, they found a really big round thing.  Now I know for a fact that it's a big round thing!  I feel so much more enlightened now!
It's a rock...
What is this mysterious generative AI programmed by morons beneath the Baltic Sea?
It's a rock! Lol
Amazing... Looks like the famous millineum condor space ship of Star wars saga....
Do yerself a favor ..fast forward to the end where there’s no answers
Send A Message Up In The Atmosphere There's Bound To Be Some Aliens Up There Somewhere Who May Want To Give You A Hand To Find Out What You Have Found!
HAS  A MOVIE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THIS UFO  THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING DONE BECAUSE THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS THE MILITARY NEEDS TO STEP IN AND DO SOMETHING BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO DISCOVERED THIS ANOMALY AREN'T DOING A DAMN THING!
That's the Millennium Falcon.
Someone made a round boat out of cement, don't think it worked.
ANYONE WITH A BRAIN knows that Fox is not serious media. They were instrumental in keeping Trump afloat.
TL;DW - It's still unsolved.
Please continue your search and report every criminal comment. FOX news is a toilet outlet, it is beneath contempt. I will pray pray for the protection of you, your families, your supporters and your entire teams by extension. May God surround you all as His children.
Don’t waste your time …even if they find things ..they will never put it on YouTube ..because they keep it secret…
it is just a rock dudes, its just a rock
https://psychicfocus.blogspot.com/2014/08/baltic-anomaly.html
we need a part 2 for sure
the mans just trying to see what this random shape is at see why are people so offended by it.
Fox entertainment is owned and controlled my Rupert Murdoch it is a top-down "news" corporation. I wonder who his friends are and who is whispering in THEIR ears. 🧐  Knowledge is power. Those who have it, will destroy you through multiple layers anonymity and denial. Going public was the only way to go. Otherwise we may never have heard of you.
The big question is why you did not get a core sample from two or three spots and around the object should’ve hired me. I would’ve worked for 5000 a day and your trip would’ve not been a waste.
4:34 sounds like the final hours of TLoZ Majora’s Mask
Annoying why do they do it.
The answer is told within the Srimad Bhagavatam, also known as the Bhagavat Purana. It has been said that it is "the cream of the Vedas". The Vedas are the trascribed conversations of the Aryans, the orignal embodiment of mankind. The Aryans establish civilizations then the rakshashas and yakshas destroy  them, the Aryans return from atop Mnt Meru and re-establish civilization.  The Vedic Timescale is immense
FOX News is not an accredited news agency. They are more like the paparazzi.
They will find skeletons all around the rock if they look
Before the global flood of Noah. This rock was a place where ppl sacrificed to their false idols .which are demons
At sometime that object set on dry land before the flood.
I hope someone invests in this.I don't understand how anyone wouldn't want to know.
The swedes are now builsing a windfarm on top of the anomalie.
Wake up peoples...😮
ITS A ROCK
It is made of volcanic but is also, somehow, a spaceship... hmmm 🤔  Wonder who paid fox to run that story? Obviously some higher powers are getting involved.
I remember when this was on the news.
i almost feel like nothing groundbreaking will be filmed. it usually is only heresay. but never in a geraldo rivera like exclusive.
I think adding a light to the buoy would be a good idea, especially in the fog. They might have been better off using the old deep-sea diving technique, where the divers have a tube connecting them to the surface and get air that way. Then, they would not have been restricted to only 10 minutes. Anyone who decides that something is a hoax w/o fully examining it is a fool. I wish Peter and Dennis all the Luck in the world! It was really strange when the temperature suddenly went to -2C. I live on a small fixed income, but I wish I had enough money to sponsor another dive. I would really like to know just what the thing is.  Have they tried Elon Musk? He seems to like strange, unusual things. God Bless all of you. IMHO, anyone who threatens you or your family is insane and should be locked up for the safety of all of us. There is no telling what that person/s will fixate on next.
Since the object is made of stone it seems unlikely to have been a space ship. Those aliens thousands of years ahead of us in science would likely have used a more suitable material for interstellar travel.
Ancient China has stories about flying craft made of stone.
.... regardless of what the skeptics and critics  have to say , the TRUTH lays at the bottom of the Baltic Sea waiting to be revealed , just as the TRUTH concerning what lays waiting to be discovered in Antarctica .... The TRUTH is out there .... Why are people so afraid of it  ? .... Why  ? ...
It’s just a rock formation 🤷‍♀️
Sunken, parked or waiting?
It is an ancient monument resembling a ship, made to contain certain artifacts of communication between a humanoid colony developed here and their mentors there approximately 32,000 years ago, long before the colonies of Atlantis. These "artifacts" contained in rocks are molecularly programmed, that is, work forever until they are destroyed or absorbed by nature. In the last relocation of the continents many of the regions were submerged, and some may emerge again with future tectonic relocations.
I see a crash site as well if no one can go to the site tells me Government recognize this as well ...  This find belongs to this team.. I believe   Dennis & Peter should finished their mission after all it's their find their  treasure ...  GOD BLESS YOU BOTH.... ❤   I believe  in ya'll  💯 😊
Of interest..billy meier has had over 800 recorded face to  face chats with human ets. see his site, et says up to 30 diff races visit us annually. They claim 3500 years ahead, get here instantly over 500 lite years distance.. and that we are ALL et here today. 1000 close ups, even of a craft landing in his yard for a chat. 20K  pages of data.
The Ship was there to keep the cover up the Storm was hurled at your location to slow and or stop you.  They sent a Team  to cut your Sonar which they did.  It appears as happenstance but it ALL was intentional.  Thank your local illuminutts.  Who probably funded you anyway😂.
I feel so bad for these men Fox had no business doing that to them. So what if it turns out to be a pile of rocks worth knowing either way because if it is a pile of rocks that still history of earth how it came to be that way and I’d rather know more about earth than space at this point.  ❤
Is that the Millennium Falcon?
These Documentaries make me Laugh. They All have the Same Dramas. Held up by Bad Weather, Equipment Breakdown and running out of Time. A Lot of Money Wasted on something that was so Obviously just a Piece of Rock, right from the start.
If you turn picture its looks almost like a mammoth, altar of the mammoth
The power of one news story...  Think about that. And only truth threatens those who spin lies.  When people threaten to hurt you and your family, it is because you have uncovered something they want concealed, so they won't lose control of the situation. Interesting that it was Fox News that did that.
Elon Musk has deep pockets.  Have you guys tried contacting him to secure sponsorship????
Omauamua was about the same shape. I'm surprised no one else has drawn the similar conclusion. It wasn't a long cylinder like everyone thought it was.
Is there a follow up video yet?
Do Not give up Guys I too, believe the scans look like something plowed into the raised mound because it looks like a path and a groove in the sea floor. I'm with you, find out!!
I believe they have the answers but have been threaten or paid off to be quite !!! But I do believe in you guys !!!! YOU TRULY FOUND SOMETHING, THANK YOU !!! ! A mother craft and escape pod ? .... I am NOT JOKING !!!!
This is a real ufo ship not fake i wish i could see it in real life but the military omg
The mockery they received was by mainstream media which is the main instrument in psyops. It’s obviously a way to distract and discredit perhaps because governments want to hide something of extreme importance. Their work is courageous and perhaps of incredible significance. The existence of UFOs is widely recorded but there have been equally large efforts to hide it.
単なる遺跡だな。ＵＦＯの残骸なんかじゃない。
They should make the coordinates public.
Looks a little like the millennium falcon to me
Ship was hauling concrete items and came into a storm when one of them came off the ship.
These guys need to hire an accountant, if it’s costing them over twenty thousand euros each day then they’re doing something wrong.
they were here
Am I the only one to notice that it looks like the Millennium Falcon.
I want to know what it is..hurry up and find out!
And it looked like a "You-Fo" 😅😂 gotta love foreign speakers lol.
sounds like FOX NEWS is a propaganda news outlet for the elite who want to hide the truth.
The 1st thing we must ask is WHY is the military so set on exploring SPACE when we have so much and cost less to explore the OCEANS of the WORLD
Don’t bother watching, they never find out what it is ..I just wasted an hour of my time .
Is it still there? Has anyone done any further research on it?
U know they carve down in rock what if they were in the begaining of if b4 the flood 🤔
100% no visibility from fog has nothing to do under water..
What l have taken from this video is you cannot trust any governments, this man was researching this for the public , l know this is a ufo and so do all of you . This man is a hero ❤️
time wasting video. u guys done just a inch discover. u have to hand over who have such a huge support, who can actually have concert answer.
Elon Musk can help you
Do you have my support brother I bleeding yes brother
❤❤❤
Consider what the bible says  about Elijah's being taken up in a fiery chariot with horses of fire and wheels of fire . What are they hiding ?
Well it seems someone is putting a lot of clout behind cutting off the money.. The question is why? Why would the Smithsonian hide the skeletons of Giants and the cave complex in the Grand canyon that holds prehistoric Egyptian  artifacts .
Fox News really needs to shut up sometimes like they don’t even know and they just spreading false info to the public this can’t actually be an ancient site maybe even part of a lost ancient city I hope they are still continuing this!!
It could have been made during the ice age when water levels were much lower.
Judging by the picture? Simple Basic Boat Dock. Very Old.
dont waste your time
Diving lessons for today… lol lot’s of drama and stuff… dull…🥱🥱🥱
It is the Millenium Falcon🤣
looks like a bomb went off to me . humans lol
Should only take them less than 14 parsecs to solve this one.
Milinniam falkan
Obviously you're slamming on Fox News and because they're conservative and they don't support Democrat narrative. Well, if Fox News did support Democrat narrative, this would not be being slammed. This would have been talked about and yes it would have bothered these men. I wouldn't want to have my story talked down about either but this was made political. You could tell despite what he said and he isn't even. I don't believe he's an American and even if he is an American citizen. This was still politically motivated those words😊
It’s the Millennium Falcon!!!!
Things that sink don't leave a trail of a half a mile and no one ever talks about the second one
Aliens admittedly have the best disguise for their ships. Their shields transform the shell of their ship to whatever the surrounding rock is for protection so as not to be discovered easily! Who imagined it would be close to  the shape of the fictional Millenium Falcon?
Its a Bitziq armory helmet
He's listed as a King whose missing and is incoherent, quarantining himself to the best of his ability!- police when hes sick and hiluscinating  Shut up, King of what?-A Yeah whats he the King of?- Ty He's the only King listed in the book of Revelations and he's completely out of it!

They came to his quarantine green mile cell and said they won! Pods
He hiluscinates that hes in a quarantine cell on the Green Mile... pods thought you think that was interesting
Why don't they lift it up ? With a Hugh ship or move it closer to shore. Is it too big to haul it?
Looks like a crash site and its funny how the military is now involved with this not letting anyone near it.
Millennium falcon 😂
Wasn't this found on Google Earth so the coordinates are online LoL 🤣
Pathetic idiots🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ Its a simple dive mission,  to much drama.
The fact that a global media campaign was waged in order to discredit them and ensure they couldn’t go back tells you a lot
It is not sunken.
I BELIEVE THESE THREATS WERE MADE TO STOP THEM FROM DIVING THE ANOMALY NOW THE GOVERNMENT 😡 HAS STOPPED THEM 😡
What year was this? Where was his crowd funding, could have rented diving bell, and another week at the site.
Millenium Falcon anyone?
Clickbait
45:42 if you guys looking for hypothesis of what it is. basically molten rocks from lava that got chilled rapidly. this chilled lava often creates strange shapes mimicking human made structures. if its crash site of an aircraft/ ship, you can test for metal reaction on that object with underwater metal detector . you guys might not found any alien spaceship, but that area likely has gold and crystals beneath the rocks that splits. when technology has advanced for underwater mining, this is one of the site you might want to check for valuable minerals including confirming that object you are curious about
You should try observe the lake baikal..
Do you know what of which material it is yet?
Are you looking for something YOU hid yourself  hm?  Could very well be I think😂 ages ago  certainly
Like 2 minutes of the whole video is them diving and looking at it. Not showing us anything really.
Ok wait. Did he just say “youfo”?
Looks like it's missing pieces, where are they ?
It is easy to get it on the Sunlight, No Matter how deep 😊😅
THEY ARE TELLING YOU NOT TO WORRY , BECAUSE JUST REGULAR EVERY DAY PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME ..THEY ARE GOING TO DO AWAY WITH US ANYHOW.  ONLY THE ELITE MATTER....THE SUPER RICH, BIG NAMES.  SO YEAH , " YOU GUYS SHOULDN'T WORRY BECAUSE YOU WONT BE AROUND VERY LONG ANYHOW"
Thats the Millennium Falcon
World governments, silencing people, working to find the truth.... again. Thats a UFO. Another way, an object can be partially glassed is through enough heat and rapid pressure/cooling. Judging by the distance the object traveled, from the impact site  of the mountain, along with its size indicate that, it was traveling extremely fast, allowing it to coast along the sea floor, for as long as it did before halting. The temperature of entering earths atmosphere at such an angle, could generate enough heat, to rapidly scorch the surface of the vessel, causing the material, to calcify into a substance similar, to the recovered pieces from the expedition. Due to the density of the sediment on the ocean floor, along with the distance traveled, could absorb the impact of a craft enough, to preserve some pieces of it, potentially keeping its main structure together.   In other words, that's a UFO, likely crashing here at some point, after being introduced to the planets atmosphere.
It's Gamera.
👍👍👍❤
Ancient tree
Ovni made in rock posible falla en el reactor antigravedad se llevo asta una colina al caer miles.de años.de antiguo. Posible adactacion con la tecnologia de ANUN. retornaran eso les.digo
Looks like Star wars ship
Fascinating footage! I think if some scientists found a light switch, they'd claim it a natural occurrence
theres a cliff with similiar shapes on it a slab that fell from here could have glided that  far and would explain the trail....
This video is waste of time
I would love to help you guys to raise some money ot help you lot to go back down there and find out what it is. I don't think you should give up on this.  If we can get people to help to fund the money we should. I would love to find out wht it is. So please don't give up. And stop listening to people who think they know wht it could be. You divers have been the closest to it and you don't know what it is yet. So go for it. Good luck.
I have a better picture of a space craft sitting on the bottom of the ocean floor. 😳
why not they collaborate with those has 25m submarine
I bet it's rocks carved by man before the water rose 400 feet like the place off the coast of Japan
There are so many galaxies, each with so many suns, i find it difficult to think we are alone in the univerce.
Its a rock
Seemmmooooooo!!!!
Wonder what it looks like when the sun is actually up? I wonder if solar or lunar activity changes anything about it..
What if Atlantis was in a island in the sky, or an island that was in the sky but crashed down to earth at one point in time. Maybe when the flood happened it do5ne something to it?
What if it is connected not using screws and connected like Chinese use to make furniture with no nails
Do an ultra sound or x ray to see what's in it!!?
Yeah, so thats the Ebon Hawk
How can it be a UFO ? It is not flying. Its not even floating.
God damn, that is one salty captain!
Yea, it's natural rock formation..........  Nature always produces Millennium Falcon shaped rocks and that also explains why the entire Baltic Sea was militarized after this expedition 🤦🤦🤦🤦  Wake da fukup
WHY? I can understand life out there even teaming, but the chances of 'them' looking and living in the same planetary crust composition, look 80% like us? no way. This UFO stuff has no proof, soon they will be following the Catholic church and bringing out that old rag "The Shroud of Turin".
Conclusion: 56:20. You're welcome.
That object is either man made or made by non humans. Yes it could be a crashed UAP. Why don’t millionaires step in and help these guys unravel the mystery. It could be evidence of Atlantis for heaven’s sake! Keep your heads up fellas. You have much to be proud of. This is a historic and momentous adventure, an incredible achievement and exciting experience with such an exciting extraordinary outcome.  You guys are all heroes in your own right for being so brave and risking so much for the sake of scientific exploration (& treasure!) . I pray someone will step in to fund another venture to look at this object soon.
This is not natural. Looks like a ufo crash site yes, but logic says it could be ancient lost civilization ruins under water like in Japan made by man.
Definitely a crash site.
I think that the rectangular empty space on the object once contained an escape pod. Interesting.
the thumbnail is clearly a covenant energy rifle or a plasma pistol.
What has none of them ever heard of a core sample start around the edges and do a few if they look good move to the center!
It's men we are not alone
Keep heart.,your on.a inportabnt journey...i wish i had the ability to help.
You want to tell me, in the age of GPS, that these people found such an extraordinary object and then didn't make sure to record this spot PRECISELY so that it could be found again later?? And when they come back and have to search laboriously, they lose their probe??? If incompetence had a face, I would know what it looked like. Totally stupid story.
So what is happening with this? Whst is the latest?
Extraterrestrial have the knowledge for coating their ships in the past. These ships have been seen Goin through solar flairs and volcano lava❤
The money slipping away while still in port is a failed contract negotiation. No at sea time no pay. Simple.
Millions of Euros to do a drill, sounds like they definitively lack of some serious money.
It very much has an answer  get in find out
In our distance past, area now dry were wet, and areas underwater now are dry, maybe it was built back in a time when the oceans were lower and someone build a house out of stone?
It it by chance a “broken arrow” intentionally covered with concrete to prevent radioactive contamination?
The big mistake was to reveal to the news the find....but understand its the only way to find Money for the project. Now its to late,new forces Will take care of It...be safe
Poo 💩 poo 💩 cockcocka 💩.....its a rock
It's the Millenium Falcon
That’s just the Ebon Hawk
I love this documentary very much.💗
Didasar lautan baltik ada gunung dan juga ada patahan lempeng tektonik
MH370 needs finding
I could have saved them all that money and told them what it was for half that
It’s a rock
You dont get an answer you get more quetions!
Maybe a big meteor, millions of years ago,  scraped -- and crashed across  the top of a mountain?
I can identify that immediately!!!  It's obviously the Millenium Falcon.
Surprise it. You don't have anybody else sponsoring. You wonder interesting to figure out what's under the water.Most of the time
The burned and quickly cooled rock could have been a ship which crashed causing the ocean floor to melt and cool.  I cannot believe with all the crazy millionaires they can't find funding. I am NOT surprised they are being threatened. This is clearly a VERY important find. I admire your work gentlemen!
Star wars! Milenary halcon space ship
Treasure hunters willfully destroy historical sites without properly documenting them, and that is exactly what should be prohibited!
It's green which means it was made by bronze, a metal which qualities are never seek for, in modern technology, and will not be, for the foreseeable future.  Just by its color, an intelligent person should have discarded this for what it is, an oddly shaped sci-fi looking bronze plate, which was part of a shield, armor, culinary utensil or ostentatious building adorns.
Sensationalism..... come on..... if this was an object of interest......? Get a grip. Why make it look like something from Star Wars???? Fanatics........ leave it....... you're 'treasure hunters' not scientists......
There is An Exactly similar object at Antarctica  Seen repeatedly in Google Earth in plain sight  Exactly same shape and those characteristic lines on it  So. I guess is A Vimana or any kind of spaceship from millennia before when the Tech described in the Ancient Vedic Indian knowledge are referred as VIMANAS  Good luck guys
Skip to 45:45 to see what they found.
Don`t give up Dennis help will come.
Please just get down and find out what it is

The simplest answer is often the correct answer, probably is just volcanic rock. DRILLING into volcanic rock, especially if you don’t know what’s underneath, could be very dangerous to surrounding areas and environments. The ‘skid marks’ might be a fault line. Governments posting ships there might just be a deterrent for idiots thinking it’s a frickin UFO.
You should call the guys from ancient aliens, they can find aliens inside a toilet.
When you search for the Truth, the enemy will try to stop you. Don't stop, go on.
You need better photos. Now it’s 2024 robots can determine the truth.
That is some kind of ancient ship from at least 11000 years ago. From a civilization very advanced that used technologies way different then the ones we use today and that we still cant understand.
Peter you’re gonna have to Peter up buddy! Man you dedicated all that work and you mean to tell me a few comments disheartened you? Well then what is your strength? Find it and you’ll be just fine
My dad used to listen to a morning radio show he was a 23 year airborne ranger and all I remember is the beginning of it and it says my name is Earl Pitts wake up America! Use your brains people just look at artifacts around the world nobody wants us to remember where we came from or what we’re capable of together! And we need to end that now
F you Fox! Thats a “Itchy” move and you know it! touché mother lover!
The government is already gone in
HOW SICK ARE SOME PEOPLE TO TREATEN HIS CHILDREN ...DUMB IDIOTS!
Looks like a piece of a shipwreck
Ask Elon Musk my heart goes out to you nothing great comes from others being evil  but comes from ones with passion. The scum that threatenes you and family will be dealt with by god ..push on  good luck
They should all just consider themselves lucky the Aloens probably considered this old tech though they still tried to deter them - strange storm, probe lost, drop in temp at the crash site & fog?? They got off easy!
IS FAKKING FALCON  mILLENIUM
This was fascinating
Thank you for sharing this on YT.  It is so fascinating to find something like that.  And who knows what it is to have people be so cruel and rude is heart breaking.  I hope you find the answers.  it has been a year since this story came out.  I wish the best to all the crew who was on this expedition. Thank you for sharing your adventures and never stop exploring Stay true to who you are and don't let others sway you.
At 55:12 that ridge they are talking about that looks like a fin or wing attached to the anomaly.
I don't know what it is but they copied the wonder in Star Wars .
Nobody knew what it was? Are they just dense? Certainly it's a YT-1300 light freighter. Wake up people!
It is a crash site pay up Sweden
They should be financed by Sweden as Latvia is broke
We are a spec of dust in a sea of planets .Image billion miles away planets populated we have never been on our own . I cannot understand why people have no idea of history
Make me superrich very fast
This documentary is all about the process. A process derailed by Fox News. They didn't ask for fox opinion if it was an UFO. They thought it was something and went and investigate it, with no conclusive evidence to what it is. People who crib about documentaries that never answer the question need to realise that documentaries in general document the process and doesn't answer all questions. For some its the process that is exciting. This team wanted to get to the end but the derailment from fox had all their promoters and financier backing off. A deep dive project would cost a lot and this divers can't fund it themselves. It's not whether you believe in aliens or you dont, but its all about a mysterious object they think they found lying in the bottom of the baltic sea.
people who are threatening them are sick. They didn't ask for this. They thought they found something and no one really knows what it is as of now. Maybe we all need to stop poking around and find situation and opportunities to hurt people's feelings.
That may be some weird rock formation lmao. Think about how nature is filled with patterns and regularities. table salt crystalises into cubes, snail shells curl a certain way, rocks form into hexagon.
Ron also had only his family  discoveries that he did not tell anyone except. The persons that told him about it.
If this video is altered I will know that someone is deceiving us. As I watched these shortly after he finished each adventure.
Underwater fissure that resulted in very small volcanic eruption.
Heel de eu gaat naar de kloten door al die migranten..vol is vol ..
Regarding one theory about the anomaly, how many pillboxes were constructed around the Baltic during the 30s and 40s?
3:56
"What have I done to deserve this?" You cound a UFO crashed in the ocean and is almost revealing this to the entire world. What is happening to you is the same that happened with everyone that came close to have proof in hands to share with the world about the existence of aliens: Blackmail, death threats, reputation assassination and even more if you keep going. There are big players that don't want this information to become public, why do you think there was that Navy Ship following your ship or weird technological interference with your equipments? Why do you think the "news" were fabricating unrealistic stories about your discoveries? It's to keep a very old secret, a very, very old secret. This cover up didn't started this year or even this decade.
I hope you get your funding and I can see any future results as I find this extremely  interesting.   I want you to realize  your quest.
It's 2024 now this was years ago anything new come to the surface?
Non sense..
Ppl are sick hang in there,  you've done nothing if it pans out witch I think you are honest DONT let the system bring you down. I'm a Targeted person by our U.S.  so do be careful you've done nothing wrong an the ppl giving you a bad time
The malenium falcon?
Your not crazy. I believe its a crash sight too.
2nd anomaly is an escape pod. Just launched-- too late :(
You could contact lottery winners in usa too. They give, they can get tax breaks and may show interest if you strike Their imaginationS :) Got nothing to lose
Dennis in video should contact a few billionaires who want and need to spend money. Elon is open minded i more than bet. Just contact him :) More than once !
Typical, the quackademics say "nothing special here, its natural !!"   Then military take over and nobody is allowed to enter 🤦  I think we all know what that means
A rock formation....
I want more, more more on this find!
This very craft that crashed through that mountain, tells me that this was possibly millions of years ago! A time when that ocean was land! There must have been so much damage that the object did not function again!
There will always be those who either are not, out of the box thinkers, or have a vested agenda and interest to stop you seeing further what this is. Usually the CIA or agents of some secret knowing that is trying to stop you. Follow your passion and your belief in finding the big one! Go forth, but bring the public in to protect yourself.😊
Peter and Denis, Please take this exploration to the limit. You could set up go fund me, public interest and support, donations and more. Employ other experts on even bringing this to the surface. This could be a world watched and historic event! We the people need this amazing discovery of other life within our hands. I would sponsor you on your continued expose and complete full find of its truth, inside and out!
This craft needs to be cleaned off so that its true skin and structure can be seen.  I imagine this would be a very big task! But what a find that the Smithonian museum and the powers that be, cant take away, and hide from us!🤔
I watched a recent Remote Viewing session of 5 individuals, and they all had a similar insight of what this Baltic Sea anomaly is. They saw hallways of tombs and a very old benevolent race of beings that visited earth, but crashed here. There leader or King was left to set this craft up as a catacomb to preserve his beloved travellers journey. There is apparently walls of hyrogliphfic writings describing there world, the crew, and what happened. Going by this I would say its safe to approach and even enter this craft. Great documented perilous and costly adventure to this site. Cheers😀
It's the... SAMPO
Why does this doc have 5.9k dislikes?
It's just the top of a volcanic chimney ; 'polished' by land ice. It's made of basaltic rock and volcanic sediments.  Sorry people ; wrong space ship. 😊
its definitely a neolithic, prehistoric site. how it got there is another question.
So he has dived every day for about 20 years straight..🤔🤫
I think this whole story is just incredible. I also think people just like being negative just to be negative? I get your concern for your safety and your family's. You need to finish what you started, to think of never knowing is enough to drive me crazy. I wish I had the money I would definitely back you to finish what you started. Good luck to you hope you find the money. God bless you 🙏
I believe you guys....hope all goes well  .
It's the millennium falcon
why does the goverment always interfere with stuff like this ? Its like they know something we don’t
Is it just me? Or does that object look very much like the Menillium Falcon?
I hope they get the help they need to investigate it again
Do you guys have a Go fund me page? “THERE” coming in time we will be revealed the truth. No gov, secret secondary nor human powers will be able to stop it.
They just couldn't catch a break, between the weather and technical issues.
Attemp to find out what it was. Still trying to find out in thousand of years. Documentaries without answer.
I totally believe you all have a crazh site!  The haters are doing their best to hold you down.  Join the UFO community and Ask for their support!  😊
How stupid to go public! Should have gone to a handful of reliable scientific professionals.  Just wanted publicity?!  You triggered the military and the haters on yourselves.  Such a shame!  You should have waited until you had finished your recovery!
Rocks.
❤   so unfortunate.  I  know it is a structure of some kind, not a ship. Hope he sees this.
They just don't want you to find the truth😢
It's just rock
I’m not sure how many videos I seen of this ship the others even found skid marks that it crash landed. I see them have all these machines yet bezos just fish out the engine of the Apollo and had it in his house you mean to tell me all gadget they got they can’t lift it just to see what’s under. I’m just saying
I can tell you now this has been a cover up I wish you wouldn't  give up what you have found is larger then life may our father in heaven be with yous
Well that was 'whole lot of nothin'
The Captain is seasoned and rules with an iron fist. Legend.
Lots of useless stupid BS drama. O, m, g, we don't know what we're looking at.I am so scared
Surprised the Spanish didn't claim it being their 😆
I  too also  very  intrested  to  see  thid. Channel.
In the first views of it (around 6:00 in) appears like a deteriorating circular wooden panel, or eroded limestone... so far.. let's see how it unfolds...  It seems to be taking a European take upon that American documentary habbit  padding stuff out with useless info which needn't have been included.  I really admire how they persevered with the set-backs, including finding the lost ''fish''. That stuff can be soul-crushing to most people. I'm rather confused why they see the sharp temperature gradient as ''surprising'' since it is NOT uncommon at al;l for underwater currents to be a completely different temperasture to the surrounding waters. Even as a child you experience thyis when swimming and diving on a beach!  And then.. scuppered by trmup, ... sorry FOX News.. typical. They are BASTAR*s  However, the last Computer generated models based upon their findings, do appear natural formations, like lava flows. However, the sdquares feautires, and lines are still rather puzzling. I hope the guys end up getting funding.
I wish mr.beast do funding in this and solve the mystery for d first time in history.
I think it's from the earliest times when the earth was being hit by these huge rocks and it hit ,like the Astrid's made the bottom of the sea are.
Thanks for your commitment to science, truth, and sharing your work and experiences with others. I commend you!
It didn't drag on the sea floor because it would have left an impression.  The trail is raised as if something pushed up through the sea floor, which would make sense as it is volcanic rock.
If you believe in climate change then you must beleive that what today is the sea was once dry land with glaciers 6000 ft high at both the north & south poles!  The disk in the Baltic is due to sea muck only partially revealing what it really is?
Is it just me or does that thing look like the millennium falcon?
It is blatantly bleedin obvious what that is. It looks like a youfo, it is a youfo. End of.
Yeah its just a Rock and people with high Fantasy.
How do you drill core samples maybe you could pour some type of non-toxic epoxy over it and make a impression and bring the impression back to the surface
My curiosity is very aroused and I believe if I had the money which I'm just a poor truck driver the vessels would be going out with rovs
Proof of civilization probably dated to Younger Dryas.
These people are doing their best to save face. Just a crash / grave site from visitors. Get over yourselves.
Millennium Falcon 😂
A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away... 0:50 the Millenium Falcon crash landed at the bottom of the sea.
If it wasnt for people like you we the population of the world would not have the life we have most of the population are shortsighted i love what you do  and take my hat off to you Thank you so much for this video and  your efforts
Wow, So far a big waste of time.
Why don’t they lift that object off the bottom of whatever it is ! We do have the equipment to bring this item up ! Save some money to sponsor this project instead wasting billions to Ukraine
If I had to guess, I would say it is a large rock formation that moved across the surface by glaciers during the last ice age.  That would also explain the ridge of material behind it and the smooth surface.  Like stones in a river the rock was smoothed and polished by this movement making it look like concrete.
It's the Millennium Falcon...
There were volcanoes all over the world during the world wide flood that's where it came from
lol oh my gosh there are psychos out there and they are going to attack anything they can you have to ignore them and persevere. those people are so weak willed and have so little energy they wont actually do anything. i want to know what that thing is down there.
Pre Flood
A freaking rock formation.
I would not be surprised if there’s a government that already knows what it is and it’s not ready to reveal it to the rest of the world. Trust me they have all kind of technology to be able to do this. They’re just not ready for it to be exposed that’s the only thing I can think of And in the process making you look crazy .
They always use music 🎵 like the movies.😂
The one percent always washing.
So the first time they don't mark cordinanance?.
That's way y like to watch 4 bidennolege.
It’s a transformer.
I saw this. Eventually they got closer and it was just a weird rock.Not a ufo
So what happen with this guys and this what they find what is
Guys, don't give up! Ignore the nay-sayers! Haters are gonna hate, no matter what you find!  You have opened my eyes to the possibilities of what you might have found! I'm so looking forward to your follow-up video! The perks at Fox News are just jealous!! You go, guys, you rock!
Please!! They are not doing this out of curiosity or for altruistic reasons! They are doing this strictly for money!!
Keep up the good work and never loose faith..., despite the trash people who threat..., some people here on earth still believe in you...
I am a poor boy from Kansas. USA.  But I wish I was a billionaire.  Because I believe in what you're doing and I believe there's something there. I know my support isn't very much but I want to let you folks know. I support you 100% I wish they can do more.. just don't give up and prove all those others wrong
Aliens have been here a lot longer than we can even imagine
To save time: This all leads to nothing..
Nature: *creates a sophisticated shape rocks in the garden to get place* Alternative sapiens: *lOok, ItSa MiLAnIuM FalCoNE*
I would not be surprised that governments got involved to steal the funding for themselves , to investigate it . This way , no matter what it turned out to be , they would not have to share it with the world . "Share" is not a word in their vocabulary . "Control" is . Antarctica ring any bells ? The 3D graphic of the area really paints the best picture . That had to be moving quite fast to shear through a mountain top like that . The additional piece flowing from the same point of exit , fits with a crash site . Very old , possibly before the water was there , or very shallow at that time . I hope they can get back there sooner than later . They deserve full credit , as it was their find . Thanks for the post !
Your diving expedition is called X. Contact Elon Musk and see if he wants to finance it because he's a millionaire and owner of X in the USA.
I enjoyed the video regardless of a definitive conclusion, Its defiantly something of interest and should be explored further. The comments below only highlight the close minded Ignorance of most people.
Biggest mistake you made was making it puplic...
My view is that the scoured section is a large block of sediment dropped into the sediment surrounding it - at some distant period when the surrounding sediment had been laid down at the bottom of a water body, or maybe was being laid down simultaneously. Into this layer was dropped the block that its now scoured more easily than the surrounding rock. A function of differential hardness of the 'rocks.'  I am certain you could find similar examples given access to rocks with difference resistances, and some scouring device.
millennium falcon or the ebon hawk lol
Its A sLeD! Rosebud was a sled, I just saved 2 hours of your life.
Its a rock,
Someone is having a laugh because that is literally the millennium falcon from star wars, note the two forward fins and the round pod to the passengers side.
12:15 people are so worried about money. Forget about it and keep your eyes on the prize.
YOU KNOW IT COULD BE A SHIP FROM THE ANNUAKI WHEN THEY CAME HERE FROM NIBIRU.  SERIOUSLY.
Looks like a Space Ship 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
I'm sure someone better equipped will go out there and investigate it
You found it once and can't find it again using coordinates I don't understand 🥴
It's a Klingon vessel it's a Class A warship. Captain Picard we don't have a Fighting Chance
How deep is that thing ?
How come no one ever went into that ship on the bottom of the ocean that alien looking thing ?
Looks like a crash site to me. Likely the military are keeping people away so they can control knowledge of truth to people like us and these investigators looking for the truth. Remembering that our generation is not the only one that had technology; the book written by Christopher Dunn about the "Power Plants at Giza" where he, an engineer, studied the great pyramid and revealed it was never a tomb (anyone who claims to have any knowledge of the Pharoahs know their tombs are in the Valley of the Kings). Christopher realised that the chemicals found, and the structure itself, would have been designed and worked to produce power. We have electricity conducted through wires, Tesla had it going through the air - how can we be ignorant to presume ancient civilisations could produce energy that provided power for flying machines? There are so many pyramids scattered across the globe that this is not unreasonable. And don't forget that the flood (yes, every ancient religion and their scripts records the great flood so don't sit there shaking your head thinking I'm a religious nut), the flood would have completely covered any evidence of this technology. Look at what they are finding under the sands in the desserts of the great Sahara - buried cities! Dinosaur bones and fossils are all found around the same depth in very similar strata levels across the globe - meaning that the cause of their extinction was at the time of the great flood. Maybe one day people will realise that just because you don't believe it, or know it yet, doesn't mean it isn't true. Maybe that day, if it ever happens, people will stop and think - "oh, maybe governments and their military have been misleading us all along" for financial gain, control and power. Sigh. People just love to live the fantasy, deny the science and cloud truth with fear... fear that there is something bigger than ourselves.
This is nothing less than a farce. the object is the cement base of a off shore drilling rig that came off. deep drilling sites are routinely radioactive due to the drilling depths involved. These producers think you are stupid.
Ofcourse it is black. While landing from outerspace it burned. It is probably some kind of metal covered with sand.
So much nothing. A 10 minute video stretched an hour. I hate this kind of stuff. Reminds me of "I'm not saying it's aliens but it was aliens."
Really sorry about how the media and social BS sites basically shut you guys down, and I pray you eventually get more funding to get a core sample. It’s very compelling how it looks like a crash site, either by a UAP or a very large meteorite. Keep this dream alive, guys, there are many people like me who know you’re not scammers and will support you.
It's the millennium falcon
Wake up, it was a space ship that got whacked by a Direct Energy Weapon and crashed.
I agree a crash site with a debris field.. carry on the fantastic work🇬🇧👍
Hey giys, great story.  I agree with Peter.  Any updates on your team's  progress with these two objects?  Cheers❤❤❤
Just need a fossil of Han solo to go with it
I believe that what  you have discovered could rewrite history,the fact that certain people and T.V.companies(Fox)were trying to persuade peoples views speaks volumes.Theres something HUGELY SIGNIFICANT down there,and THEY do not want it disclosed!! I ONLY WISH I HAD THE MONEY TO HELP FUND YOUR PROJECT AND FIND THE ANSWERS!!  DONT GIVE UP HOPE,YOU NEVER KNOW,YOU MAY FIND THAT SOMEONE MAY COME FORWARD WITH FURTHER FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT!!
Surely the technology now exists for this object to properly investigated.  In the meantime I suppose it provides some more sensationalist programs on YouTube.   Sorry if I sound a tad cynical!
Bore holes in it all the way around and attach giant balloons to them to raise it off the bottom
Unidentified Sunken Object
I would like to find out, unfortunately a lot of people are so misguided and malicious …
Thank you commenters for saving an hour of my time 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Braw
Fox News is not news. Losing 781billion proves it.
So sorry about the enemies that taunt you and your mysterious find.  God bless you.  Joan Icker. USA 54:59
I believe its an Ancient Rock quarry
The ship has been at this spot for centuries, what's covering it is sediment from the soft sand hardened making it look like rock.  That's my personal opinion, and the men in black coming in on it
Raise it to the surface
I really feel for you guys.,but you have fallen foul of toxic social media..I hope everything turns out the way you would like in finding your answers,good luck guys….your biggest mistake was letting the media know
We are not the first intelligence creature on the earth, that's it. Maybe the religion dont want people acknowledge it.
What is govt and media afraid of the truth? Aliens have visited earth
Thats a plasma rifle from halo lol
What people should take from this documentary is that we live in a world full of undiscovered mysteries.  I applaud the team for their investigation and the Cyber bullies need to back off because its explorers like them that have helped shape our understanding of our planet.  Amazing work guys.
hey guys sorry to say anything this late but in the world there's always some idiots and those idiots will never have that courage what you have and therefore they are stupid or ignorant by asking you guys that what it is and not knowing the most simple answer.. Which is that you don't also know. You see the same image or photo they can see. Therefore I will believe in those 3 answers you already gave. It is extraterrestrial. It is manmade. It is a natural phenomenon. For now for me it remains as those three. Greets from neighbour, FI
Keep the faith, brother!
Kudos and shout-out to the daredevil divers !!  In terms of real risks, the divers undertook the most. And its multiplied due to unknown nature down there.
1. It's definitely man-made  2. It's a STONE structure.  3. It's has stairs on the left side 4. It has a perfectly circular area near the back. Like a helicopter pad 5. The square section missing from the front could be like a boat dock 6. I'm 100% sure it was ABOVE water when it was constructed 7. In no part does it look like a ufo, OR a vehicle of ANY kind
Yep, I can't believe those darn Swedes, I better get over there tomorrow and see for myself, LOL!
I would have been tempted to investigate too.  But on balance, it seems likely to be a geological feature.  Lots of them are bound, just by chance, to look like manmade objects.
I know an alien spaceship when I see one! Luckily aliens know too. They probably watched the thing also.
I think this thing is the conduit of an ancient volcano filled with basalt lava and plodwed by glaciers during ice ages
I think it’s obvious that George Lucas based Star Wars on the real life Millennium Falcon crash landing on earth. Poor  Chewbacca has been wandering around, being called Big Foot for so long now! Jokes aside, it should be investigated. It’s what humans do that make us special. If it’s a cover up, of course there will not be anything there anymore. My feeling is, it’s probably a meteor. Still very interesting.
It's the Millennium Falcon
MMMmmh imagine if a movie was made about how the military could supress a ufo crash in the sea, i'm sure they would use the same tactics to make sure no one will go there again. There is so much people studying so much differents places and things, why this have been attacked like this is beyond strange.
Well played, Sweden. First pinpoint the location with  navy, then discredit crew so they can't go diving again. Enjoy their discovery, and let the internet know what u finds there.👏
A large building 😎
"What  the  f**k's  an Aluminum Falcon?!"
that's where Han Solo crashed...
Most likely space junk, sunken war stuff from WWII, pirate "booty", or as the default on the comments section here "aliens".
An ARK, patrimony of the humanities, is under there, to be opened, when the time is right.
Anyone with a brain knows that FOX AINT NEWS
What drives you is greed.  Your godmoney is what most people worship
It is the Millennium Falcon.
❣❣❣💘💘💘💋
That's it. It's the Millennium Falcon. Han died in the crash, and Chewbacca become the Bigfoot.
Weird how they can't get people backing them to look deeper at something that shouldn't be there and is in plain sight. While you have multiple billionaires funding a bunch of random guys digging on an island for over 8 years now, and all they have found are a few buried stone roads, and what could be blanks for weighing against coins. Like really all they have found is evidence of the digging done decades ago by other treasure hunters, nothing really amazing at all.
It's the Ebon Hawk
Some rock. Get over it.
Sixty meter diameteor meteor remnant??? LOL ... I don't think so.
Wow. You know you're onto something when the govts and media give you the works. It's always a big sign you're onto something they don't want you to know
Keep exploring, live the dream do what you do best ignore the ignorant ramblings of mad men and women
Probably somthing made by a baltic at some point
It definitely looks like a crash site from an object from the sky hit that sea at such an impact in such a speed that broke through that hill and proceeded to go further.
If the U.S. government believed it was some sort of alien craft, they would have raised it from the ocean floor. They raised a soviet nuclear submarine....why wouldn't they have grabbed this by now??
I have seen this quite awhile back. It looks like a space craft.
I have seen this quite awhile back. It looks like a space craft.
Perhaps the concrete - like surface is the result of sand superheated and then quickly cooled as a result of an object hitting the ocean floor at a relatively flat angle ( guided ? ) at a high rate of speed. The divided hill and subsequent extended ridge of material is just too much of a coincidence To be totally discounted. Truly mysterious!
OMG did they drag this out!
The representation they are recording looks a lot like a helmet, stylized to be sure, much like those from South America.
That is definitely not concrete or stone
Hmm, with that drag line behind it it looks like it crashed
Because im thinkin that is a starship
Because im thinkin that is a starship
All because of Fox news which is a joke in there selves all because fox was in with starwars. Dudes, if i had the money I'd fund you guys
Like the millennium falcon.....hmmmmm like i have always said humans aren't from earth
Looks like a starship
Millennium falcon ?
Don't give up! Ignore the ignorant journos who are just showing off.  You inspire me.  How will we ever move on in our knowledge if we think like those ignorant people?  Don't let them get to you, you are 100 times better than them.
They found the millineum falcon.
What Is This Mysterious Sunken Object Beneath The Baltic Sea? It is man-made fortress used by an ancient human civilization.  That is all.
its look like rock to me
I think they stumbled upon something no one wanted them to know.  Something Secret.
I know what it is, it's Putins Navy Fleet 😅😂😅😂😅
the gawd damn millienium fulkin
Careful with the media... they will destroy you
As l was watching the 3-D image at the end of the video l said, That’s a crash site, something very large crashed here. The next thing I heard was you saying, this is a crash site. To me it looks like something split open the top of an underwater mountain. I really enjoyed this video. I hope someone will finance another trip. Good luck.
It is exactly what it looks like
Spacecraft
Where's Luke Skywalker😂😂😂😂
Very interesting. Who does not love a good mystery? Going public is a good way to get money and collaboration from others who can reach that depth. The other side of that is military intelligence. Their ship could be tracked by a $12 tracking dot or dart or even by satellite without detection. It has probably already been examined and the mystery solved but not published. Saying that a circle is the most common natural shape in the universe. Love the comments and guesses on what it could be UFO is a possibility, ancient buried tower. Cooled lava vent, a meteorite crater that cooled and crusted over. There are also records of civilizations that actually built circular watercraft, although have not heard of one that big. Could be an ark like Noah. The possibilities are almost endless. Makes an interesting mystery for sure.
EXTREMELY BORING, AND OF CUORSE IT'S NOT A UFO, I JUST WASTED AN HOUR OF MY TIME WATCHING GUYS ON A BOAT.
0:43 Is that the millenium falcon?
How come nobody has try to bring this craft to the surface? Lol
Seems like this would be a great project for one of our multibilltonaires to fund..????
Like a meteor it couldve burned going through the atmosphere zone......but the problem is the perfect square with circular opening and stairway....along with a door then u have hallways inside??? It also left a trail on ocean floor as it slid in....
what  if it is a metor crash site....  or unique phallic imiage.  but cheeks with a shaft....  or an underwater black site.
It is the story about how the tried to find a story.
Nope, sorry.  Fascinating subject but ruined by overdramatic music and portentous narration.
You should try to contact Elon Musk he seems to me to be interested in this kind of stuff maybe he could help fund you.  Good luck and I hope you can go back and do some more diving.
Distraction only no final conclusion or information
We still believe in you guys. You don't have to clear any names. You're good people. Us true believers will never stop believing in you.
ship made  of  stone  oook
What's a youfoe? 😂
UFO looking anomalie that turns out to be concrete. What a disappointment & waste of time watching this. I’m surprised this even made it to tv……..😮
Fox News is b.s. news and I hope you get a chance to further examine this structure!
Bosnian Gulf? W T F?  Are you kidding us?
👍💙 Well, it’s 2024 & idk what Ocean Team X (?) is doing today. I find your Treasure absolutely fascinating & something I hope your team will conclude Successfully. If I could I would finance it & someone should! So many w so much money. Not me. Loved the program. Want more!
I just found this. I’m really sad that Fox News caused these men trouble. They are not a real news channel. More like a tv show.
Oh it's real. I think it was carved on land before that area was under water. I wish whomever created it, left information behind to explain it, but then future hunter's wouldn't have been this curious.
The mind of that young man.....the Mellinium Falcon.....
Maybe they should use a submersible ship. I think it's a rock formation when that land mass was not submerged.  Maybe it was carved by man, and maybe there's an entrance, but it could be unacessble or entrance is hidden.  Very interesting object.
kinda looks like a broken toilet seat
No questions are answered here
why still talk about this ??  the authorities  in charge ( those that rule above you ) have posted no trespassing regulations. no one allowed to further investigate this site !!  authorities are scared of what !?
I loved this, I'm sad to see others threaten them and family, that's so sick, I hope you go back and even just one more time, It is something, I can't wait for part two, please don't be discouraged because some idiots out there say horrible things, once they thort the world was flat, they find ancient civilizations now, those laser photos that strip away forestry, i wonder if that can help, I was shocked too see the navy ship, Fox news sucks , who took that picture? Pioneers and explorers, all these people open to opportunities , achieve more than people who throw stones in glass houses. I really wish you all the very best of luck finding sponsors. Fox news made me so angry I  would ignore them, or perhaps they should pay, and prove it since they tampered with your discovery. Do what your heart says, what your passion is, plz don't give up. Many loving Blessings to your crew and dreams.
12,000 years ago 300 feet deep today was above water. I think it’s possibly a megalithic structure built during the ice age.
Looks like fake news again, no solution, no more investigation,  no nothing. Waste of time even going there to look and give up, doing nothing. So sad😢
Thank you. It was an interesting watch, instead of the normal rehash of old footage for clicks. The sample rock he was scraping looked like coal instead of the rock sample at the end, though. The death threats makes it sound like someone is trying to stop investigation... or maybe just the normal batch of nutters that crawl out from under a rock.
Anything that doesn't conform to what historians/governments know, Certain establishments will turn and corrupt. We don't know everything and never will,  guys like these are the only ones pushing for  more knowledge..
As usual , the best thing about such videos are comments.thank you all.
It's a Statue of the millennium Falcon watch episode 1 of Star wars when they won the war they built the statue it's over a half million years old it was long long ago but not Far far away
I did the math. This thing is 6.3 acres!
37.04minutes  you guys waste my time and mah mobile data
It's not going to answer the question is it?
volcanic fracture along a fault leading from magma chamber to magma chamber dome  .. it makes sense to me far more than man made and hidden or not from this earth
I wouldn't risk my kids. Safety on it
If something come in real hot it could of melted dirt into rock on the surface of it. I would guess drilling into it would be the next thing to do.
Skip to the last 30 min. Anyone trolling in the comments is a kook or part of the coverup. It’s wild that there is a disinformation campaign going on.
The image you see before you click into this video looks nothing like it in real life its not like that the lines n edges  are not like that YouTube is perfetic some times milking people n tricking people its wrong n should be called false advertising
On a depth only 300 feet it's not possible to REALLY figure out what this thing is? Come on, they managed several times to get equipment down to Titanic that is laying at a depth of 12,500 feet / 3,8 kilometer and film the wreck and even roam around and inside it. If the origin of the Baltic Sea Anomaly still cannot be explained, 13 years after it's discovery, it's about time this needs to be cleared up. If there is even a remote chance this is extra terrestrial the government of Finland/Sweden need to fund a serious investigation.
it's natural formation and scams to get money from stupid investors and bank loan
Oh, look, the Millennium Falcon.!😂
Always wondered where the millennium falcon ended up......😏
IT'S NOT THE MILLENIUM FALCON!  THAT WOULD BE CLICK BAIT!
Believe  me, that is NOT A ROCK !!   WHY DON'T YOU GET IN CONTACT WITH  "ELON MUSK," AND ASK HIM IF HE WILL KINDLY BACK YOU FINANCIALLY, AND SEND HIM A PICTURE OF YOUR UNUSUAL TRILLION DOLLAR FIND?! I AM VERY SURE THAT "ELON MUSK"  WILL MOST DEFINITELY BE INTERESTED IN IT, WHEN HE GETS A LOOK AT IT. I THINK CONTACTING  ELON  MUSK IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR FINANCIAL QUESTION. DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED BY THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE  "ENVIOUS AND JEALOUS" OF YOUR FIND!   DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO AND SAY   THEY ARE JEALOUS !!!!! PLEASE DO SEND ELON MUSK AN  E-MAIL WITH A PHOTO OF THAT UFO THING, AND ASK HIM FOR HELP.   HECK, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BY DOING THAT. HE IS WEALTHIER THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP !!! YOU HAVE HEARD OF ELON MUSK HAVEN'T YOU ? BEST OF LUCK ❤❤❤!
What I find puzzleing in my mind, is what causes it to turn black when you touch it.  That is so weird.   Like, is that thing still alive in some way to do that?    Because it looks kind of like it's Cement, or either it got so HOT that it BURNED, and Turned Black, before crashing into the Baltic Sea. This is a Brain Twister, to try and figure out What The Heck It Is !!!!
I Certainly Do Hope That Peter & Dennis  Lay Claim To This UFO Item As Theirs, so that nobody else tries to get it, and Claim It AsTheirs.
It looks like a UFO to me that crashed into the Sea, and only God knows how long ago it happened to end up down there.   It does have very unusual qualities or traits about it too, which are unexplainable at this time.   I wonder if it will ever be able to be brought up from the depth?
Dennis & Peter have discovered a one in a Trillion kind of thing, whatever it is.  Nobody else has ever found another one like this. This thing is like finding a 24 K SOLID GOLD ITEM.
What if it's a ship from Agatha or Atlantis swedish people do fit discriptoin of the Agatha being
This guy never heard of dropping a nav point where this thing was or just putting something there that flashes or something so it would be easier to locate?
What a HUGE NOTHING BURGER...
Battle Star Galactica. Same ship ! And Same Ship in the movie Star Wars in the 1st and 2nd Episodes!
The hull was actually only supposed to dive that depth for limited  a.ount of dives and had already exceeded this limit which is due to the fact that every time it went to such great depths the hulls integrity degrades,.... I blame the owner/ operator which lost his life in the tragedy,he ignored anyone and everyone who tried warning him,this horrible disaster is solely on his shoulders...
instead of saying     U  FO          its ufo   one bloody word
Loved the diversity of questions on the Archaix data...most helpful and enjoyable. Thanks everyone and special Thanks to Jason, so generous and gracious with his knowledge and time.
If any government thought this was in some way a UFO they would have their nose all up in it and these divers would be restricted from diving , take that to the bank.
In a world where any idiot can walk into a sporting goods store & purchase a self contained GPS for less than $200, which will locate any position in any ocean in the world within less than 10 meters, these guys are having a tough time finding something that is 60 meters across that they have located in the past?
Found this a realy enjoyable  documentary as an exdiver.Sad that some wish to slight others and their families.Does it matter now what it actualy is. But i would like to know what it is as my interest has been ignited. Hope your team come to a realistic evaluation at some point. Also hope you have a continued experience of treasure seeking and finding.Which i think most people have a fascination of since childhood. Wish you well and every success.
That's where ET landed a billion years ago:)))
If the visual of it splitting the hill in half and then crawling forward is correct, it is definitely a UFO.
No-one with half a brain believes ANYTHING Fox news says.. they are the No1 BS news known to man!
What I'd like to know is, has there ever been a large capitol ship in the Baltic which was in a battle with an enemy ship and took fire? Could it be the remnants of a mangled battleship turret?  I seem to recall that some Dreadnought Battleships had round, circular turrets for the large calibre guns.  Aside from people wanting it to be an ancient crashed UFO, and without knowing the answer to my question, a turret is my best guess.
Looks like the Millian Falcon
This has to be the ancient ship from the faraway galaxies long ago that brought the Progenitors of Humanity from, Adam and Eve to Planet Earth. This feeling has continued to grow for some reason. The reason we've been unable to approach it is maybe because the technology is still too advanced for beings like us, or God himself is preventing us from accessing that ship.
why do I get the feeling this is Heraldo Hevara's Capones vault
George Lucas needs to get behind these guys with his billions.
From the first sonar look it's clear, the Millennium Falcon!
Typical of Faux News to spread bs without any evedence whatsoever.
Chewie get to the Falcon!!
All u need is air bags and a tow hook .. 🥸
It's a rock
Wow, this was 56 minutes of a giant nothing burger. Soo much hyperbole in the narration, fake tension, and invented drama all to get to "we don't know but it's probably a rock".
Honestly it looks like a rock shaped rock
That thing is not from this planet and it looks like that thing is sitting there for millions of years
Bedankt
This object is an extra terrestrial flying object that has calcified through out hundred's of years drilling through the calcified layers will yiel the true metal layer .
so old it is FUNNY and nothing new = just a stolen video with 2nd hand news wrapped up with a new narrator = not even good !
Clearly the Ebon Hawk...
Fox says it... so the government took the thing of the bottom from the sea. Fox is like cnn always lies and brainwashing.
And wasnt it interessting that in this time of this discovery,the president of US,namely Obama came on a visit to Stockholm.Hmm...
It looks like millennium falcon from star wars
It's not sunken. There is no "it". Its part of the seafloor that looks much the same. This is a god AD for some people though.
They already know what it is ! A rock.
crashed soviet submarine experiment?
approach the top tier entertainment and mining,commercial multi-billionaires for money,
This has been debunked guys. They got a sample and it is geological. It’s believed it is the remnants of an extinct volcano. Nothing alien here folks. This documentary is old. The face on the moon isn’t alien either fyi 😂
To stop a boat in the middle of the Baltic Sea and an hour later you find something. There are no accidents. Fascinating find.
I do hope they continue the search.. for the sake of humanity please do.
Is it so expensive today to get drone-sub with cable and proper lightiing, scanners and dive down to take samples, Sea geologists does it all the time without breaking the bank.
Yes, It looks like a crash site to me too!!
From that to view? The real malenium Falken. ❤❤❤🙏🙏🪬🪬💎💎🥃🥃🇬🇧🇬🇧
it's just a rock formation. my goodness
Key word attempt
Cylon ship😂
Its made of LEGO😢
Fascinating article
Phenomenal! Thx
Compelling documentary .I hope the trurh is revealed one day .
Were any of these guys qualified as experts? They only got a sample? No measurements? No samples around the object? They need qualified experts, and a better plan. More photos by the divers and the ROV? And only had very limited time once they found it?
Found the millennia falcon.
I think it's likely a very old man-made structure. Before the Baltic Sea existed, that was probably a valley, and one could walk there on dry ground. It's not uncommon to find sunken structures like that around the world.
If I had the dollars, I`d hae piping to the structure and decompression chambers available to decompress to surface standards, but the whole site , I would pull all silt away and analyze the silt too, that is my opinion.
This is  the lost Millennium Falcon
This is  the lost Millennium Falcon
When I first saw the object my immediate thought was it’s the Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars films
Sacrificial alter
It is a crash site for sure, the craft split the high ridge in half and plowed the bottom till it lost kinetic forward momentum drive energy..... Also the crashed craft looks exactly the same as the crafts that have been recorded outside the space station... when they lost their teather cord ... as it was drifting away ...many crafts that look identical to the craft on sea bottom... were videoed inspecting the teather cord as it was drifting away. Fox News and CNN works for government disinformation... most everyone knows that... it is a given.... it is real or they would not have threatened you . They have been covering up anything to do with UFO's .... That is what "Operation Blue Book"... was all about.  God Bless all of You and your efforts to bring Humanity real facts and truth..... Blessings
It's the millennium falcon.
Pre Flood object.
Every extraordinary story has one extraordinary line of b.s.
Why didn't they use a dive submersible...😊
So it’s NOT the Millennium Falcon?
Milalien Falcon!
It tells us we are not alone
We know more about the surface of the moon 🌔than what lies beneath our oceans 🌊 and they hide and lie about moon discoveries all the time. So ditto.
How about renaming it History of S*it?      That's the last time I bother with this channel.
Idk why this is such a mystery. Its a friggin football field deep, supposedly we flew to the moon....
Its clealy a Corellian YT 1300
a    youfoh???
Fully expecting for them to find an American flag with "USA" on the left flank. Craft from the future landing in the past. Crash burnt the surrounding rock. Why not?
It's funny that we think 🤔 that looking at something that we don't know what it is and trying to find out is a joke or something else., but looking for money or something that is not how would you say profitable not worth it.
Write to Elon Musk or Robert Bigelow. I am very confident either one or even both of them will fund the second expedition.
Stay of the internet, who cares what haters say. Keep going
It's The Millennium Falcon duh, let's go get it.
Its the "Millennium Falcon"
They are on to something otherwise they would not be getting threats  Watch what they found magically disappear.  Governments hide things and lie to their citizens
300 hundred feet below surface. What is the large, almost round object?
Hablo en español solamente pero pregunto: no se pueden fabricar varios trailers de 4 mts de ancho por 10 mts de longitud cada uno, impulsados por el fondo marino, con orugas cómo los tanques de guerra, que se incrusten por debajo de esa estructura de a poco, hasta que dicha estructura quede sobre todos los traillers apuntando en la misma dirección debajo de la misma, que comiencen a avanzar todos, al mismo tiempo, llevando a dicha estructura, por el fondo marino, hasta llegar a alguna costa acesible, para extraerla lentamente del agua sin necesidad de reflotar, digo Ya que la tecnología existe, sólo hay que ponerla en acción.
This has a money pit vib
If I hit the power ball or mega millions I would donate several million dollars to see what this is.
These divers are a special type of people.  I would have anxiety down there.
What these gentlemen have discovered is an ancient Family Dollar Store which was closed in 1789 BC due to sales. When the great rains came,  it caused the water to rise and flood the store. If they were able to gain access they would find ancient coolers, clothes racks and industrial shelving which held everything from cat litter to bread and sweet cakes.
Go put a hook in the little one and drag it up, you'll be able to cut it open and or clean it up and know what it is.  Even that small chunk is bound to have technology on it if it is in fact a crash site.  Pretty obvious to my mechanical mind.  That thing either is tuffer than nails or it was shielded when it passed through that small mountain down there.  And lets not forget!  When a U S O is seen moving into or through the water,  people who see it say it's like it's in the air.  The water doesn't slow the thing down one bit. So yes, i see a craft that got extremely hot coming in from the atmosphere,  hit the water,  if there was water there when it crashed ?  And maybe a smaller craft or a piece of it became dislodged and is parked nearby.  Now, and you'll like this one,  the ring of rocks on top is from the Neanderthal tribe that found it 962 yrs later and it was their Holy of Holy sight for 5000 yrs and so the big ring of rocks for a fire pit.  I mean,  who'd want to do the Oggie Woggie Boogie dance in the dark !  That things probably been there since the last Golden Age when many such things seemed to be flying around the planet doing whatever they were doing back then.  Vimmana's ?  Supposedly they had battles and wars ?  Go with your hearts guys,  if I had the equipment to drag it up and flop it on deck for you, 😊🎉.
It's a fake. That's what it is.
Its not a ship, its a weapon, like a needler, Odin used it to petrify the ice giants lol
They are making tours to Titanic 12500 ft below, but nobody can make an expedition few hundred feet deep to see wtf it is? Cmon it’s bs.
Why do people judge others so soon.. even if it is just a rock it is still so amazing discover
Sending underwater drones + cameras— cheaper & safer than live human divers?
Where’s the mysterious sunken object
When an investigation team get into a serious search and then receive threats against their lives and the safety of their families, iits obvious that some people know what is is and don't want anyone else to know!
Don't see why they can't use a floating drill to pierce through the center to take core sample
clearly a rock moved by glacial ice back when that area was under 2 miles of ice... pointless waste of time.
Fox News lies!
Wow, how to make a two minute video last nearly an hour !!  Well done 😵‍💫
Islam
Vision came Islam
it seems a clash site. i analyze someone playing dirty to prevent the ocean team peter and dennis to find an investor for exploration digging. even media outlets from US been dispatch to make it a hoax rumors.
It’s the millennium Falcon
The mystery of, what they are going to show you for 57 mins and then never show you. Move along... nothing to see here !!
Over billion years old UFO space ship. 100% human are made by someone.
It appears to be my cousin's left shoe 👞.  Don't worry about it.  It could be non-human, human or woman maid made or non-made.
good thing its not in usa
The first picture that I seen you guys have of it you know it does look like something somebody has made I mean even the one side that has the steps it looks like steps walking up to the top of it you know stairs that look like they're going to some kind of a top of a vehicle or platform or something
Don’t stop trying to find out what it is 🫡
The depth of that thing and how it’s in the middle of a huge sea is not man made.
If it quaks like a duck and it looks like a duck it’s a duck.
The guys that found this thing and went deep sea diving to investigate it are absolutly amazing dudes with huge freaking balls. This is definitely not man made. It’s either a meteor or a actual space ship. You can easily see how it crashed on earth there is a trail on the sea floor and it looks like it literally crashed through a mountain on the ocean floor
Just spent an hour to find out it is a rock on the bottom of ocean
I see a crash sight!!!
Maybe millions of years ago ufo's were made of stone ? Find the resonant frequency of stone and it becomes light...Tibetan's did
What terrible things you have went through!! Keep going! You guys are awesome!
Whats near the Californian coast, that Google blocked out.
Millennium Falcon
I really enjoyed watching this fascinating adventure, it is very well put together. I hope the team can get some answers to this anomaly. Awesome stuff!
Interesting, that has the same shape as the horn to comet...
I am so sure it is a spaceship
They would have saved 2 days if they would have marked it with GPS when they first found it
Millenium Falcon
The farsight channel answered  the most questions about the anomaly. It was more than everybody expected.
That is a toxic waste radioactive dump covered in concrete
This is real.
I see that a piece on the top right, belongs to the bottom left..I  know nothing of this sort of thing ,but having an analytical mind ,it was like solving a puzzle...I  looked at it once and saw what it should be, that's all...😊
It looks like Han Solos Millineium falcon.
Best of luck to all explorers, past present and future. Without people seeking answers and pushing the limits of our knowledge, we would be just a honking slaves with melting brains.
So after watching all this you still haven't been down and found out what it is?
It is interesting and should be investigated.
Just like the curse of oak Island waste of time
It is a Millennium Falcon that crashed to earth from Star Wars.
That's the Millennium Falcon 😂
It's a Polo mint
I’m curious and hope they can revisit the site.  My imagination leads me to think of continental rifts like the long rift that goes through Iceland, meteors , vulcanism. I hope an answer is found.
I think this was dry land at some point and this is some temple or worship complex cause it is man made for sure ...we have similar places in bulgaria from tracian times on the rocks some holes stares,and other forms in the rocks and they are sacred places for some deitys
I bet it is nuclear waste from Russia.
It's definitely a crash sight made thousands of years ago.
Did the air narrator actually call it a U-Fo?
At 56:39, you can see what looks like the Shu symbol in Egyptian Hieroglyphs but upside down.
During the Glacial maximum 21,000 years ago, parts of the Baltic Sea were above ground.  The site is likely carved into rock by early Humans.  This is likely something similar to the Yunaguni temple-like site near Japan.
I am seeing this clip for so many years that i am fed up. Why dont you go down in your state of the art gadgets and sort it out.
Could be governments want to keep it a secret.
MELLINIUM FALCON...........COOL......
Ein paar betrunkene Segler finden einen Felsen, tauchen ganze 90 Meterchen und finden einen Felsen. Dafür fibt 57Minuten Youtube Fame. Lol?
Yes it is not Hoax that was a true find
Millennium Falcon finally found...
Who cares?
Looks like someone dumped star wars prop in the ocean
It's the millennium falcon?
Wanna buy a slightly used intergalactic space craft....minor repairs NECESSARY BEFORE LEAVING EARTH
It is because government knows what it is and don't want you to let it out it's like everything related to this topic they know it's not from earth it's like everything going on in the sky something is coming or is already hear and waiting for more it's only reason government is so tight lipped but it is defiantly a craft and your right it's a crash site
I must be a big Sucker for watching an hour long video of a few men finding a peice of volcanic rock
the russians got that ufo out of there nothing to see here folks
its now a U S O .....jk
And ? 57 minutes and 35 seconds I will never get back…
Conclusion is that nothing of anything anomolous was found , otherwise there would have been a follow up on the object by now.
So were these also the gangsters who blew up Nord Stream?   Just because they couldn't find anything alien? They needed the money I suppose.  😄
A rock ...
Must of crashed doing the Kessel Run 🤣
It's a fossil 😂😂😂
Looks like a giant Jurassic tick.  Prove me wrong.
Unfortunately it's a hidden agenda maybe others don't want truth to be exposed . As you have found a unusual object  already surveyed and touched and seen first hand . Thank you for your efforts . Maybe a blessing in disguise . Stay safe and Iam sure others treasures hunts will come around for you . Thank you for sharing your discovery . It was very interesting and such a problem solving questions ?? Best wishes for new adventures .
Black rocks possibly sludge exited from craft upon entering into the water . As a UFO sighting story mentioned in UFO reports where black hot sludge burnt through airplane carriers by military and plane crashed and pilot's injected as. Electricity  wires caused  electrical shorts loss of control of plane instrument s. Black rocks . Yet obviously these rocks cold ?? Apparently he's holding it by hands possibly toxic substance needs to be checjed out medically for any sickness and rocks in quantine isolation for other people usage or science studying use of toxic equipment for biohazard conditions safety for everyone on ship and around these rocks avoid contaminated situations. So important. Thank you.
Premolded formed Craft he mentioned like cement feeling.
Black surface spin touch? Cement type feeling ? Stone like . Ceramic possibly like a heat aircraft? Ceramic s with sensitive color changes on touch processing! Hmmm isn't there a vehicle that changes color's in human world 2024 modern technology already. ? Something to consider that as well.
Fog I don't like fog that s big change on exterior temperature very strange! Spooky feeling! Anomaly as well.
Below freezing point water temperature! Changed .  That's something! A sudden change so maybe something made it cold! If they have Access to inner and outward temperature control possibly?
Does it Emmie sounds or anything  noise frequency?
Wow...I hope they get the sponsors....
It's the millenum falcon!!!!!
That ship hit there before the sea comes in.long before and petrified overtime.
Eeer gee maybe someone will invent a metal detector andthey could just lower it dowh😂😂😂😂
Nah its just a prehistoric giant Trilabyte.
Well, the moral seems to be, no matter whether natural or a UFO, if you stay under sea water for long, you ll get stoned 😮😢
29:58 This is a very exciting event in time!..the locating this object has kindled as interesting as the moon landing!..we are compelled as a humanitarian effort to understand what this object is or try too! How can we NOT continue this endeavor!
Wow this is definitely a crashed ufo . I did not see or know about how that mountain is punched through!....WOW!!
NO!!..THAT THINK DOESN'T BELONG THERE!..WE MUST HELP THIS EFFORT IN DISCOVERING WHAT THIS OBJECT REALLY IS!. PEOPLE KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE OBJECT TO KNOW ITS NOT ," A PILE OF ROCKS" !
It is sad that some people make crude comments.
Great show and fascinating content 👍
How can it be a ufo it’s not flying
Ain't that the ship from star wars millennium falcon
First 45 seconds they showed you what it was-- the millenium falcon. Story over.😂
I thought it looked like a futuristic tank.We know aliens and spaceships exist so why the secrecy surrounding identifying unless manmade weapon of war scrapped due to failed testing. The Oceans have long been the military dumping grounds.
I once saw a cloud that was shaped like an elephant!!! And in Bryce Canyon in Utah there are these big rock formations called "the Guardians" that look like ancient warriors dressed in armor. One of them looks like a wolf, too.
Come on people. THINK. This anomaly was petrified by weapon. Notice the landing track behind it. I've been telling y'all to get out of the box.
i think 1000's of year's ago large statues and pillars such the obelisk that ended up in NYC, were transported via ship. The ship was hit by a storm the statue or large object flipped over into the ocean. Does this sound impossible?
It's a piece from a uniform .... I'd imagine there will be more close to where this was found ....   How likely my have we been looking at this type my ..???. ..  Yeah quite some time ... They want to keep the football's thinking it's some amazing Space Ship ... When in fact what your looking at is either a belt buckle or a Button...   It's not some ancient amazing  millennium falcon ... If it is there .. I mean I couldn't tell you if it's there ..   But hey ...even if it's not ....  There are things much more amazing ....  And you don't need to rely on anyone or anything for information on things  that you or I could never verify ... Folks The Whole of The Earth is Covered in the Carcasses of Giants .... Can you imagine this.... No ...  Well don't worry you don't have to use the imagination... Oh no not at all.... Just a quick look on Google Earth or a similar app ...  Folks this is the offspring of human beings and angels ... The Original Fallen angels.... I'm done but before you laugh at me please verify what I say.... It's a must
What a waste of my F’ing time! Glad I kept skipping through most of it.
50 to 80.00 years ago the northsea and waters around were abot 100 to 200meters lower like doggersland was dry they found a hand built wall not long ago
Looking at the thumbnail, this is clearly the millennium falcon 😅
It is very odd it's not just on the flat sea bottom and it seems to be resting on a platform.
Please, someone bring it up and display it.
Why is it so far-fetched to think that ancient civilization used to heat rock to melting points in order to build structures?
An idea - It appears and could have been used as a Docking / Landing  Facility for extra terrestrial space transportation.  It could have been useful during the ice ages when global waters were lower.
You  differently found something ❤ someone’s don’t want you to investigate 😮😮😮😮
It’s the Millennium Falcon
I would donate the millions of dollars to do the expedition to retrieve the thing from the floor of the ocean
Charlie Brown : It's a rock.  It's a couple hundred ft for crying out loud, a ufo would have been known by now. But for the sake of hype. . . .
You would think seeing so much UFO activity is seen with them entering and exiting volcanoes it could make sense that this one was covered in volcanic rock when it crashed, that's of course if it is a UFO, it could be some petrified unidentified material, if it's a natural structure I'd love to see how it formed and got where it was, it's still very intriguing no matter what it is 😮
Contact Dr. Stephen Greer , known for "the disclosure project" or one of the Gaia Channel authors, and scientists.  These people are special and long time experts in their respective fields we'll over 20 years.  My novice opinion: Your discovery may be that of a weathered Trans dimensional or unidentified Arial phenomenon (currently UAP as UFO) that may have landed upside down, or wound up upside down If it occurred during the last "polar shift" . (Perhaps at the time of Earth's  "pangea", when continents appeared completely different on our Earth's surface) .They have been known to crash into the seas.  Perhaps the "black rock or powder is magnetite, (magnetic mineral) which may have been used to propel crafts through space using 2 rings of different polarity encircling one another to wind up thrust, etc, typically located at the base or sidewall apex if the craft.  Please keep us updated, this is a very important find given the smoothe edges of the craft, and right angles, which are not natural, and long "scrape marks".  Best of Luck to you all, don't give up!😊thank you for phenomenal content and your great work!!!
This is a topic for woman only. They are the only people who  have children .❤❤❤❤
i hope you find out what it is in time because im very intrested in things like at!
Looks like they used the same camera all the Bigfoot hunters use. Would have been nice if they played the whole footage all the way through.
Millennium falcon
Its amazing the nonsense people come up with due to their imaginations.
From the picture I would say it’s definitely the Millennium Falcon.
so what was it!!??
I just want an answer all ready.
I don't know why this question is even being asked.  It is obviously the Millennium Falcon from a galaxy far, far away.  Shaped exactly like it.
Keep trying despite these Internet trolls. Approach Elon Musk
People need to research the Japanese mythology on the space craft that look and resemble rocks from Hundreds of years in the past of verbal lore. Pilots today say some UFOS look like rocks flying at unbelievable speeds. Think about it.
In the opener it's said "you don't get an answer. You just get more questions."  I think I'm going to listen to this and watch something else.
If it was, the raw video would not be on YT.
Looks like Star Wars ship, they probably put it there and now showing this
asteroid impact threw molten rock into outer space that then fell back to Earth.
It’s the millennium falcon! Finally! I’ve been looking for that thing everywhere!
It's the final resting place of the millennium falcon
But why we don't get any updated informations about this?
Of coarse it's rock what else would it be 😂😂😂😂😂
millennium falcon hans may be close by
They made a huge discovery, ITS A ROCK. Waa waa waa.
The millennium Falcon.
At first look, this isn't an UFO (Unidentified Flying Object). It's more an USO (Unidentified Sunken Object)
One hour investigating a mystery that remains a mystery, pointless.
Greek stone
millennium falcon
so we know that we don’t know anything … thanks for watching !
So, an update, please. Would be helpful.
It's the Millenium Duck!
The Tomb of Beowulf
😁😆🤣 It's the long lost helmet of Daft Punk
This really is a simple thing to realize what it is.  They say it is stone.  Remember, the space shuttle was covered in heat resistant stone!  So, it is very possible this “ship” is also covered in a similar stone.  Too bad they didn’t dig deeper.
Anything for a story🤪😜
IF you look down at the Devils Tower in Wyoming, it looks round.  Bet whatever this is, it's geological.
Good ole Fox News always ruining everything
It's the Millennium Falcon. 😂
They found a Milenium Falcon!!!!1
Much interruption to the subject matter
Thanks for showing the world. I hope you find a craft or something of extreme importance and significance. People that say nasty things about your project are just jealous and we see that type of behaviour whenever something out of their normal happens. People should support the program whatever the outcome just so the remainder questions are answered good or bad. I'm still extreme interested. Keep your heads up and ignore the bad publicity. I hope you shock.the world. Take care from Fiona
Bosnia also has a 30 000 yr old pyramid of the Sun
ANYTHING STRANGE IS AUTOMATICALLY A FREAKING 👽 ALIEN, G.O.D. DID N.O.T. CREATE ALIENS, OR OTHER PLANETS WITH ALIENS, JUST A F.A.C.T., GROW-UP
A..L..I..E..N..S....O.K.
FUNNY HOW THIER IS NOOOOO FILM WHATSOEVER,GONNA BE ANOTHER BIG-FOOT  SIGHTING.
IF IT WAS ANYTHING THEY WOULD HAVE PULLED IT UP Y..E..A..R..S. AGO, F.A.C.T.
What is the predicted weight of the object.  Could  crane lift it onto a barge so it can be transported to land for closer examination? It may be a mistake to drill holes through it and allow sea water inside which would ruin technology if it is actually a space craft.
Millennium falcon
Maybe,better do further investigation!must be a military submarine go there funded by the government.  And try to move it,dig it to see what's on beneath this anomaly,,,
WHY  ASK IF  YOU  EVER  FIND  OUT TELL  THEM YOU  CAN'T  PARK  THERE  MATE
Go with the geologists.  The ridge and channel, and the object itself, appear to be volcanic in origin, and could be evidence of a small spreading ridge in the middle of the Baltic Sea.  If so, it should be of great interest to the Swedish geological survey, who may be able to find funding for new research.  Not a UFO, but perhaps something of enormous scientific value.  Good luck!
It's the oceans left nipple
The whole "its just rocks" story is stupid. Rocks that just happend to be shaped like the millennium falcon. Might not be a ufo but it definitely doesn't look natural.
disappointing doco'
Just another ancient anomaly that may be from a galactic incursion, or a previous advanced civilization.
Ah yes, I've seen one of these before. We call that a big rock where I come from. Cool hey, they're everywhere!
If it were a crash site then it would have left a trench on the sea floor and not a ridge.
Millennium falcon
The  Millennium Falcoln 😂
Come to think of it the military could shut them down
I think you seen something and it turned out to be rocks now all the haters need to chill because you was trying to prove it u did nothing but try so people hating need to chill
Its rocks
Your team was just targeted, because someone or an organization wants to be the first to dive in and get what ever it is down there.
Its clearly the Millenium Falcon.
Our perception fails us when we cannot comprehend how unimaginably complicated a random shape could be formed by pure luck. We still think that something or someone should create it, but in reality it could only be just a simulacra that seems to make sense ONLY from our angle of view.
You should have Elon Musk fund your expeditions
It's the millennium Falcon
Its probaby part of a meteorite
I was thinking it was lava like I also think they are being told to say this bc it really is a crash site. Or this could be a huge hocks to pocket a income for ever
It's the Master Chief.
Extremely old fossilized UAP would be my guess 🤔🤔🤔
yeahh. the rumor has been around for years, no answer what it really is. Probably it is nothing. and some people makes money when it is kept a mistery
It is the melleniom falcon😮😅
they went down to see it ..just a rock formation thats all
So sorry for this brave men to receive those intimidating msgs. Keep fighting brave men! You all have our support.  Like you guys, we need answers too.
Rock looks like the ones in the Bosnian Pyramids.
The threats are clearly a proof that what´s down there shouldn´t be "discovered".
Fox news just more Government control mechanisms . It is such a sad thing the narrative is allowed by US the people the only power that does exist . A tiny few control the worlds people only because of laziness and stupidity  blind following of the narrative provided you for your enslavement into there game . Please break away Blessed and eternal we are .
sacrificial altar
Looks like the Millennium Falcon
It looked like a UFO?  Jumping to such an idiotic statement lost my interest entirely.
Love watching !! Turns black ??
Come on people, it's the millennium falcon!!
Good luck is what I got to say, And besides that I would say call in the name of the lord jesus and you will accomplish much, ask and you will receive.
04:38 is that the same music sample used on Majora's Mask for the Final Hours? Lol
Its a crash site
they just afraid of the real truth. you know religion is their tools to gain control over people
I seem that same image in the clouds one time but it didn’t last as long as their rock 🤓
What drives you is the money . Do not kid every body ....
300 feet deep. That means it is probably a city or fortress around the time of the last ice age, when the sea was 400 feet lower, ALL of the baltic was land, Britain was NOT an island then... Entire cities are under the sea.
It’s just an underwater rock formation. Mystery no longer a mystery, you’re welcome.
The Millenium Falcon!
Knowledge is found by your type of efforts. 🍻
6000 dives, really??? Bro was more under water than Jacques Cousteau and Ariel together!
Thanks Fox News 🖕 I want to know what it is
A rock shelf !
the object sunk? or the land that the object rests on was once simply above the water line.
The SFX overlayed with Location Titles sound like ST:TNG
Government will be interested so they will wad off this guys with various means and take over the investigation
Maybe this THING is responsible for Nord Streem pipeline attack?
This is one of many dots needing to be connected. For example, UAP's have been seen going in & out of volcanos. We have seen the track marks left behind by objects that have come to rest where they sit. Surrounding data must not be ignored but collected, & extrapolated.
A rock.
Save your time this is GARBAGE.  Clickbait like old bad UHF TV.  At the end of the day they find a glacier deposit,  big deal. Then the IDIOT says "straight line" must be man made - lol. I guess he's never seen razor straight lines in nature. (crystals for one)   LOL    AVOID GARBAGE LIKE THIS
Thier no mystery here (English accent) this is the mallenian falcon !!!! 😊Fastest ship in the Rebellion........ 😎💯
WTF?!?!? Seriously TIMELINE looping in the past and stole the work and discovery of others???!!  Peter Lindberg and Dennis Åsberg discovered this f**ckin STONE already in 2011 !!!!  Greedy FRAUDS!
nasa spends so much money looking for what is outside our earth when there are things like this that can't be explained say it really is a crashed spaceship there could be lots to learn from this ?
So that's where the Millennium falcon ended up  🤣
Everybody has a Passion or Two.  From the beginning of Times people were Adventurous. Some go to the Moon, Mars Etc, and some go to the Abyss.  Congratulations for your Courage and Determination.👍👍👍👏🏼👏🏼🙏🏼😇
this  is  government   they   will  do  these  things,
Im convinced this is a USO/UFO. I belive it is likely very old and covered with very thick layer of sediment. Im very exited to find out what you descover inside. Please be cautious when you open. Best wishes and good luck to all. 😊
It's the Millennium Falcon!😂😂😂😂😂
Too bad a team with a deep water sub don't step up.
Voice an DRAMATIC music is pissing me off after just a few minutes…..: 🤬
Id like to say something but not sure if my signal will go out very well from down here...i dont understand why people are looking for me... I paid the Sumarians to park here about 12,000 years ago and they said there was no time limit. But ita all crusty and. and  and ICKY looking now....just waiting for mom and dad to come pick me up.
I can tell you exactly what it is.
Just ask Jules Vern.  It might be the rock that brought them through the volcano and was spit out into the ocean.
Master chief
To be continued.
Treasure hunters are all a bit of a con man. To support an endeavor like this wealthy people have to buy in and believe on faith. Could be a rock but we will never know until someone coughs up a big hunk of cash. Remember Columbus raised money to find India and found the new world.
tree stump
Star trek
Bs 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
The damage that irresponsible journalism causes to the world cannot be underestimated….
I was thinking about the burned rocks.. These are akin to the burned ceramic tiles of the space shuttle..re-entry damage.. food for thought.
These men are fantastic professionals… The beast of the beast.
Wow two hours for a 10 minute look.. just wow..
When the dude reached the object and started hammering the surface I can almost image two little green meaning looking at each and one say to the other “Did you hear that?” And the other says “Huh, Nope”..  and the other says “There it is again”…..😂😂😂😂😂😂
PETA has my absolute admiration. He must have been busting to see the object with his own eyes and yet he said no i am not diving. It is my responsibility to ensure this project is safe and according to his plan. Absolute leadership. I’d hire him any time for my business.
ITS THE ANCIENT ASTRONAUT HELMET ITS MAYAN CMON NOW
I haven't seen the video yet. But the thumbnail looks like master chiefs helmet.
Thats so cool looking, Thank you for making this documentary,  I wish you all well, stay strong, Peace from Oklahoma USA..❤
whenever a US legacy media tries to discredit you, and you receive threats, you know you’re on the right track ❤
i whant  to see part  2 and part 3
So it’s a craft that crashed into an underwater mountain and the object next to it is a broken off part of the craft!!  Come in any one with a brain can see that. I’m Just Saying!!!
Does anyone know any updates about this?
I wish these two explorers the best of luck. Great presentation thanks for sharing .
Punch it Chewy!
I'm actually more concerned about what it is the top of.
Looks like a BOOGER from The Jolly Green Giant!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
the guy sniffing the rock shavings takes the take. Plus handling it in such a haphazard way to contaminate any findings. (Instead, bag the samples and take them to a geology department. They might have a spectrometer to tell you exactly the atomic composition - heck they might even know what kind of mineral makes up that sampled spectrum.)
Thank you and good luck
It looks like the Millennium falcon.
Or if it is a made structure, then maybe it was made before that area was flooded
My 3 main theories:  1. If the Seed Germination Theory is to be believed. It's the vessel we arrived on millions of years ago before we evolved and now it's fossilized.  2. If the Great Flood story is to be believed. It was some sort of dedicated temple or sacred site, or used for agriculture from the antediluvian period, and got submerged.  3. I know it's far out, but it's from the Annunaki(or fallen angels) that helped humanity create civilization like in the Book of Enoch, and it's very large because these were the Nephilim. Atheists or Skeptics would just call them aliens, but aliens is a term that just assumes we don't know their origins, but the Annunaki are aliens but we know how they got here IF the Book of Enoch is a fact of history.
Why r there 4.8k dis likes?
I have enjoyed this Documentary and can only dream or speculate like others at what lays below, I also find it is always the doubters and people who issue out threats who hide behind the internets intercut layers giving anonymity to these people, why is it that these armchair critics are never the ones to risk their money or lives in the benefit of science and exploration.
Guys. Guys, relax, it's the Millennium Falcon. Haven't you ever seen Star Wars?
Oh my god its the millennium falcon!!!
Anyone can see that it’s the millennium falcon, duh !
millennium falcon
Clearly it’s the Millinum Falcon.
Ive watched ice calving videos and thought about how easy it would be  for chunks of land to break off and flip ove or sink into the ocean like thes chunks of ice have.
That was 44 minutes I'll never get back
It looks like a doorway obviously.
Send a depth charge ...
Thank you for the truth on what it really is and not the lies about what was said!
Someone should reach out to Elon Musk, to ger involved, cause this stuff is right up his alley!!!
This house seem on in a nordique thriller... s'en on tv long tile ago with a big cellar
Maybe just old permafrost under the sea
Cheebaka is in dont wake him up !
An ancien house of à fisher géant anté diluvien as stonhenge or in Turquie
Un truc nazis un sous marin ruskof irradiés pourri comme les autres
so it is just an incredible  coincidence that it looks like millennium falcon  ? 😏
An awful lot of sensationalizm going on here.
I'm not disputing the possibility that It could be the Millenium Falcon but i'm pretty sure Han Solo and Chewbacca are still alive.
so sorry...we ALL wasted our time...
The best way to prevent this from being investigated is to make it a joke, almost all governments across the world would be scared of the truth about it coming out as they dont believe the public can handle the idea of ufo s being proved. If it would be possible to lift the craft it would be best.
It's Luke Skywalker
People always ask the question "If there is other intelligent life in the Universe, don't you think they would have been here by now and we would know about them?"  I always answer "NO!! Because they are intelligent!!"  One look at us and our planet, and they're out of here, Jack!!
It is probably a structure from world war 2, that was dragged out  there and sunk, or from an oil exploration company.
You spent $127,000 or more, and you only spent 10 minutes down there. With a thing in dark, murky, dusty water?  That's ridiculous!!  How about a large diving sub, where you can be inside, and it has lots of arms, lights, tools, and drlling equipment?
It's the Millennium Falcon. Duh
More fake the image was taken by OceanX this is a doctored imagined Image not at all like the OceanX image. More fakery for those who will fall for it. People wake up, these YouTube photos are all fake.
The New Expedition Unknown!!❤
Where is Josh Gates when You need Him or Cameron ?
Big mistake, always bad luck to rename a ship!
Thats crazy saying its just a random rock formation???? We are lied to on a daily basis so even if it was an actual ufo  that crash landed the powets that be would not tell us anway 😮
Oh! my God it's Brexit
THEY SHOULD HAVE  KEPT QUIET  UNTIL FURTHER    EXAMINATION   TO LEARN MORE   ABOUT WHAT THEY     MAY BE DEALING              WITH.     LET KAT OUT OF      BAG MUCH TOO                 SOON  Why Everything was     Working Against                them   including credibility
It's nothing just rock😂😂
well done boys...keep low profile and keep going....
I thought the divers were going to bring samples since one was using a hammer on the rock or whatever it is..😮
They need to speak with Elon Musk. He has the interest in space travel and the money to do the search. He might want to know about the material that could get a space ship safely to Earth.
Under the big concrete thing could be a nuclear warhead that accidentally fell off of a PLANE, OR was discharged from a submarine and left there for leak of radioactive material possibly? and then the govt came and  built a TOMB around it with water hardening concrete ...     There was once a nuclear bomb that fell out of a plane on accident back in the day.   Im just guessing of what it could be... but it seems MAN MADE and the govt didnt want them poking around.. SOOOO    what else could it be? People are guessing alien craft site? I doubt it because they would of PULLED it up and took it if it WAS... They would want to study it ... Not bury it in concrete.
Millennium Falcon
OMG! kickstart , kickstart this!
Long Story short.... Chewbacca parks the millennium falcon on the sea😂
I’m glad she’s so perfect!
I dont remember from previous reports on this . But was there a crash path on the bottom ,where it slid to a stop ????
This finding goes against religions and they are making sure you get no finance to proceed. Maybe the Vatican will help you?
Lump of concrete...
Movie prop from sea view ,flying sub, series of voyage to the bottom of the sea.
I can't believe that they are treated like this for trying to find the truth. I hope they are able to complete their quest. I hate fox news!!!! Practically all they do is lie!!!!
We must find out what it is whatever it is that is what tge search for knowledge is all about even if the answer disappoints we must know.
I believe in these guys and their discovery and work. They have made no false claims as to what it is they just want answers but for the sickos out there that threaten them and their children it is you that also needs help you unbalanced morons.. Derek and peter this world is full of critics and idiots but guys  you should never have gone public with this its too late now but I hope you find your answers and never trust fox news as they are a fake industry with their lies..if you make anymore discoveries keep it to yourselves and only tell a trusted scientific institute when you have samples and other evidence. Do not trust the media or public only scientist. Good luck guys may you embark on other discoveries too. Uk
Hopefully this documentary will generate interest and possibly income that can help finance another expedition.
At 300 feet and they still cant get an answer, seems like a bunch of incompetent people put the whole show together. What a waste of time watching.
🙏
Launch Pad from Way back
It is pure click bait nothing there nothing
The head of some giant mechanical wrench 🔧😊
12000 years ago that s was not submerged so it might be natural rocks that were man altered
WOW. Thank you!
The rediculing of the team afterwards is an aanomaly by itself. It points to somebody allready knowing what the thing at the bottom is, and try to stop further progress of the project. To me the object sems manmade and had some specific purpose. It is possibly  a hollow platform that got filled with water and sank, serving as a base for some activity, either  when floating or lying at the bottom.  One possible activity was harvesting minerals at the bottom, for example gold. But thefence activities or surveillance is also possible.
You didn't get enough funding, you should have said it was for Ukraine. Biden would have given you BILLIONS.
Its obviously the Millennium Falcon
The public is accepting of the ideas of aliens. the public WANTS there to be aliens. it excites people. so why is the very IDEA of aliens so suppressed? I'm talking about the mere IDEA of alien life in an impossibly massive universe, not just the idea that they might have come here in the past. that in itself is a paradox, isn't it? Humanity really has to be incredibly arrogant to think it's soooooo special and froofy that they are the only life out there.
Well done these maggots 🪰 🪰 are jealous and bitter good luck with the future. Kenny
Alien spacecraft flying in impossible maneuvers at 45:23 is so amazing! UFO!
They should ask Elon Musk for the funds to go back and figure it out.   Good luck..........
Columnar basalt fallen over.
"However, a group of divers collected samples from the mysterious entity and gave their finding to scientists who determined that the Baltic Sea Anomaly is simply a glacial deposit."
You got me subscribed with this genuine discovery. I love Mistry
Don't give up!...
Millenium Falcon!
Its wondergul thecontinue tbeir finding. As fox why dont you stop putting your nose where it dont belong for you have no clue what is found under the sea. I wouldnt be surprise the government doesnt want anyone to  find the truth. I hope they are still finding ways to reach their findings. Think about it people of those ufo that they release that we didnt know about.
There is a much better chance of something being on the bottom of the ocean somewhere then in that sea
How long has it been since this area was above water? Good luck to you. Don’t hang your hat on nay sayers. Their opinions usually come from ignorance. Genuine inquired has no need to be justified by ‘success’, or fear of failure. If it did, there would be no inquired, and we would not be living in the knowledge based world we do.
Reminds me of of UFO skeptics that laugh at people that have seen these strange objects It’s better to have an open mind
Isn't anything but what it is.
That's obviously the Millennium Falcon
These guys look genuine in their work, now, if that artifact is made of artificial matter such as concrete, for what purpose was it made for? But if it is made of  molten rock and has such features as a spaceship and that it has crushed into the sea splitting the mont in half below and stretching a groove on the sea bed. Then it must be from outer space, but the strange shape of that rock shows to be design as a hover board, but by who, well it may sound stupid, but by my point of view, it could originate from the cast of Satan on earth during the time of the great heavenly war in eon past.
It is a crash site.
how much more juice can you guys squeeze out of this lemon with no answers bahahahahaha its been freakn years!
Millinium Falcon!
It’s the millennium falcon dudes!
Kinda looks like a big rock on the bed of the sea.
It's a rock.
My very first impression of the initial image was that it was a slab of rock -a case of 'the Emperor's new clothes'?
Well that nicely done video answered just about nothing. My question is was a deep dive the best and only choice based on the money available, or was that a scientific decision?  Also are there no million/billionaire's that donate to this type of thing, or any scientific grants to help with getting the best equipment for the exploration?
Aren't the seas full of shipwrecks ?
what if its both natural and man made? there are plenty of examples all over the world of people carving into interesting and eye-catching geological features.
Who knows how long it’s been there and it’s very likely that it hit an underwater lava pocket covering it in the black rock. I also find it funny that news outlets would report that story after one diving expedition and why did the team not team up with a larger team with more resources. There are so many questions that have nothing to do with the object itself.
Its an old documentary and what disturbs me the most is that the team would not be able to further investigate the site as anybody who goes near is stopped by the military, so in my view this speaks volumes as to what it may be? I honestly believe this to be an ancient crash site.
Oh, come on! It's clearly the Millennium Falcon.
U-FO?
To discover what is below the surface of the object it must be drilled, cored, are there room-like empty areas? What are the materials below the surface. Importantly, during the last ice age, when was this area of the Baltic dry? If it is man-made, when could an early, unknown human civilization had access to this area to build megalithic structures of this sort? Then, what would have been the purpose? Temples of worship, civic structures, living space, etc. ? This is all speculation, but I would strongly suggest the presumption of a crashed spaceship be loosened to allow much broader thought.  In any case, this could be a dramatic discovery that could rewrite human history - or it could have some strange, natural origin. Mysteries like this must be pursued by some well funded organization, like the discoverers of the Titanic.
what a blinking waste of 57 mins and 100,000 euros
I found this intriguing and very interesting,the first episode in a saga that I'm sure is one day going to vindicate the lads that risked their lives and spent a lot of time and money to bring about the question of whether this is U.A.P crashing into the ocean perhaps tens or even hundreds of thousands of years ago then covered by rock,silts and other ocean processes that has blanketed it over time...Bravo 👏🏼 team Ocean X .😊
I found something very similar but much larger off the coast of Costa Rica https://youtu.be/imMXqJ98W1o?si=5Z5WrwCViRA7onOa
Lol ! It's obviously the millennium falcon ! Look at it ffs ! I think someone's pulling our leg here ! It may contain the remains of han solo and chewbacca.. 😄😄
Well,  the millenium Falcon was in another galaxy a long time ago. Maybe this is where it came to rest and it was fossilized over time ? Lol.
UFO. It is exactly that....until identified....we would refer to it as an Unidentified Foreign Object.
You look like Ukraine President...hehe
Millennium Falcon Duh!
Still interesting.   Thanks
no matter what it is or isn't i have such respect and admiration for those men who are so passionate about this project. i would love to buy some merch!  it is amazingly sad how awful people are with their hate and threats. but i'll go to bed after watching this with a smile on my face because of these adventurous souls.
It’s alien killer entities waiting to let loose on the planet ,  and kill the human race,  don’t let them out
It is people like these who advance our global knowledge and understanding.  Musketeer-explorers to be saluted for their endeavor rather than shamed by disappointed dreamers.
I suggest, that it was a concrete lid for on top of a Nuclear Reactor housing Uranium Rods.  After a Nuclear Accident, years later, the Russians or some other country took the "Radioactive Lid" out and dumped it in the middle of the Baltic Sea for safety so people will not become ill by being around or near it.
WHY is there only one team of divers???!!!!!!  Please get some women next time.  These men are not professionals.
I think that painting is so ugly it deserc
Put more women in charge and we would be better off. Watching men try to do something is so enraging.
Why did they have to locate the object again?  Fellas...ever heard of gps?
It’s not ever going to be told what it really is
Aaah! A Dralthi fighter; designed and built by the Kilrathi...
These fishermen never heard of Kickstarter.
I blame Obama.
It’s the Millennium Falcon.
The Star Wars ship which is used in comparison, is a FREAKING MOVIE PROP. No actual spaceship, will look like that or have huge engines and no tank etc. it’s a fantasy. What you actually see on this picture, without framing it in a certain color to give it the look of the millennium falcon, is just a bunch of rocks with even surfaces which easily can be created by lava or other natural processes.
It makes me really mad how many people make fun of these gentlemen and even threaten their children. What is wrong with these people?! Dennis and Peter found something interesting, let them investigate in peace!
I see one big object here. And it stands out from the whole pile of stones at the bottom of the sea with its clear symmetry. If you let your imagination run wild, perhaps this is really some kind of aircraft of past civilizations that for some reason ended up under water. But why was it poured with concrete? Probably just to hide it from prying eyes. And who poured concrete on him? Maybe the owners of this "ship" themselves.
Malenium falcon
Millennium falcon?
Appreciate the comments❤I wont waste my time Turning off after the first 60 seconds
Rock. Case closed.
why anyone would thumbs up trash like this is beyond me.
Thank you for taking us on your journey. I appreciate your honest approach and technical expertise as underwater hunters. You should have done what others have done in the US and hit Fox News with defamation. Good Luck to you and your amazing crew.
Mars has canals. There's a face on the moon. the Earth is flat. There's a UFO at the bottom of the  Baltic Sea...
I think that a few governments worked together to try and silence and discredit them. I believe they found something important and it needs to be explored and exposed.
This 'documentary' lost all credibility when the narrator said 'no one can identify the object but it looks like a UFO'. Bye bye.
This is a prototype of  the Polish submarine -Herring 69 . There was only ONE flaw in the design-- the screen door
The milenary falcon!! 😂
🧐🥰👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Just watching this. Very interesting. I hope they never give up.
Why aren't rich folk interested?
Why isn't millionaire Graham Hancock on the case helping..?
Nah. Looks like an old settlement site with a causeway, probably over a small lake. Remember that topography has flooded and risen many times over the millennia.
Its the millennium falcon from star wars
Ice age structure ❤
Millenium Falcon, I'm calling it now.
People who believe its natural are idiots.  It definitely skidded into place.  No doubt about it.  I believe it's from high above.
It could be a plug from a volcano, as it hit the sea floor it rolled like a coin... It could also be the starship Event Horizon. 😉
1st thing that came into my mind was Millennium Falcon
hMM COULD IT BE AN ARC AS A lot f them are appearing all over the world in strange places some sort of ancient alien technology?
I think it’s one of those old circular ships the Russians built in the 19th century.
if you think you can take a pill and get the kind of results your talking about, I have this bridge for sale, interested ?
I can't believe anybody believes any "news (never ending worthless slop) stations" today. But then not many will see the Truth before their eyes. Scripture says it all. Period.
You need to keep looking or you will never find anything.
You need to keep looking or you will never find anything.
I think its more likely to be a flat shaped meteorite coming in side-on slicing that hill, coming to rest ....then falling flat. Just another speculation ofcourse.
I believe there is something very special down there I can feel it , may the world open up and help these gentlemen inspire the world and prove it's  more than they could imagine it to be and then sum .
He he he, anyone can see thats a alien space ship. Too funny.
Could you take a core drill down and drill into it to see what it's truly made of
I would rather have a question that can’t be answered, than an answer that can’t be questioned…..
Its funny because it looks kind of like the Millennium Falcon.
Never give up
Thomas bangalter's helmet
If I won the lottery I would fund it 💯
ANY one surprised that it was FOX NEWS that brought out the FILTH in their droves? Brave Scum, happy to threaten children via E-Mail...classic Fox News Viewer response of course.
How surprising that FOX yielded negative effects.  The dashing of hopes and dreams, threats on the researchers and their families, sounds about right.
It's a stump of a titan tree
Space ship....alien... Everything is clear.....
I’ve been watching this whole thing since it started. If it’s a meteorite that’s awesome! It doesn’t look like anything natural to me at all. I hope it’s a UFO I’m not even gonna lie. Maybe if they don’t find out what it is then their kids will! I will be watching this entire journey though. I am very curious about exactly what it is. I lived in the FL Keys for about about ten years and was out on boats a lot. I’ve seen sunken planes, ships, all kinds of crazy stuff but never anything like this! Good luck to anyone who journeys out to take a chance to find out exactly what this anomaly is!!! God speed!! Take care!! 😊
parked et spaceship, once shut down it turns into stone. as soon as reactivated, it becomes an artificial live organism.
its crazy the nations of the world will not support this .. like if everyone got together .. its only 300ft down  we could bring it up fairly easy if the right stuff was there ..  idk why all the gov around it havent teamed up .. like wouldnt you want answers ..lol just seems stupid to not do that ,..
YOU’RE SEEING ……(VALENTINA PAPAGNA…Ancient Plugs at the bottom of the Sea)……these plugs that we are showing you, they are very ancient. They have been here since the beginning of Creation. There are many of them throughout the world. Soon, we will have permission to unplug them, because God will give us the commandment to do so. When we open them, the world will experience many volcanic eruptions, fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Soon there will be severe suffering in the world if people do not repent and convert.”………The angel said, “No human eye has ever seen what I am about to show you.” As the dust cloud settled, on the sea floor, I could clearly see what looked like a round cement slab, less than half a metre in diameter. The more I observed, I could see there were many of these round slabs on the sea floor. They were all identical.  https://valentina-sydneyseer.com.au/13-october-2018/     The angel was very stern with me and said, “You have to speak the Truth to people, do not feel sorry for them. If it is the will of God, it will happen. God has been warning people, and they do not listen.”
I believe in your work. Your integrity is without question for me.
That rock formation in Japan is a natural phenomenon, as is this one most likely . But what sort of snivelling, scumbag, degenerates threaten a man’s family over it??
It's a crash site and that object didn't come from earth. There's something under the rock
Or there is a possibility that some one don't want to revel the truth u find something there and is real
Never let it go , the truth is out there , I believe in you and I want to see what is there , and that is not just rock that is a real space shipif I was a billionaire u will have may all money ...
I will not stop thinking about a damn Rock in the ocean 😮😅😢😂🎉❤. "You guys are brave". Nice video to watch!!!
Godh. Why not go down there and do an actual survey. Naaaah.
I’ve been wondering if alien spaceships could have been made out or stone. Earth is a kind of spaceship. Something huge could be made in space. Stuff seems to stick together differently in the vacuum of space. Plus, enormous amounts of rock could be much more easily gathered together if it’s already in outer space.  Our ancestors were incredibly knowledgeable about the properties of different rocks so I can see an alien civilization that was more orientated to stone as well as metal. Just an idea. It occurred to me looking at the Peruvian stones that are fitted together so precisely.
And then the glorious of the meantime go look for gold there’s more out there
You don’t have to be an expert to be a problem solver, but you do have to find that expert.
And in speculation, it could be a crash site that man at that time we came to build some shrine around. You really have to dig into the history and geology and anthropology of that area and consider those variables as part of the solving of this equation.
You do not need to manage the core sampling. It’s  going to take more then a small ship with an rov and no decompression equipment for divers. So the question you have to ask yourself are you ready to let go to realize that the truth is more important than any immediate profits. What comes to mind is Noa and the Army Corps of Engineers they have sophisticated equipment to completely survey the bottom of that area in the greatest details stage one. You know better than everyone else that you’re not gonna be able to crack the walking throw up with the box litter find gold coins.. and somehow emotionally tired and yourself to what others say is embarrassing stop it I believe in what you doing and you also have to be able to shift gears when necessary. This is truth for humanity. Somethings happened here we need to know what it is as a human race and that’s the contribution you will make, what better people to be in that situation God bless I wish you luck if I could be there and I was able to contribute I would be there..
Without people like them the world kept lurking and wandering on the dark side, these people are the ones who show the world what is it out there beyond the grasp of the human mind, they tried to shed light as much as possible so that ordinary mind can understand wonders of the world. I salute this team and my deepest respect for them. It's just common people are so naive and some intellectuals are trying to hide something that they don't want this explorers to discover the truth.
It is a UFO... The burnt rocks are the fallout from the machine not making it through our crust, like others do.  They use heat to melt through our crust. That's why when they enter water, there is a no splash but a tiny bit of steam.  There is a perfect circle off USA coast made by a tictac craft. Please don't give up. Your not far now. I promise...
A Romulan Bird of Prey
They should have used a chain.   I am STILL wondering what's down there....
the mistake they made was getting in bed with industry doc makers yeah they fund, but they have this way of taking a 1 hour long thing into 12 series and your still waiting for some answers but build it up like its almost gonna happenand the end of each 3episode, and ik that didnt happen but u can tell it was about to start heading down that trail and ppl noticed... thats why every1 backed off...curse of oak island...perfect example... please just find out what it actually is and then make the documentARY
Un identified swimming object,not 👾 UFO
I still believe you have found something  I believe the powers to be is the problem
I am sorry that they have not found the answer, yet. If I were wealthy, I would find the project with even better equipment and more time. Humans are natural explorers seeking adventures and new discoveries. We want to know.
Great investigation
Is the millennium falcon from Star Wars   sea Star wars isn't about the future  What is the movie based on the past   It's a whole part of the Great reset  It's not the first time they did that and then they have different people come out claim that they invented stuff that we already had  Cadillac video chat it's been around since the twenties there's actual pictures if you dig deep enough and the internet you'll see pictures of people from the 20s
Thats the Millenium Falcon
Ahh. He just said crash site. Yes
It's an aeroplane !!!!!
Good luck and I have enormous respect, and value the fact that there are skilled, decent men out in the world seeking answers. Thank you for restoring my faith
Dennis and to his team.... You got my backing... (As if it matters)... I pray that it is your team who finds out what it is. I really don't understand why people get hostile towards them.... Let them do what they do for themselves..... Even if it is an antient construction when that area had no water and later got submerged....or mearly volcanic rocks..... But let it be a confirmed finding.
The Millennium Falcon?
Why don’t hey check in with the skinwalker ranch multimillionaire???
It's not an object, nor is it sunken.
Millenium Falcon?
If you watch when they drop the side scan in the water , the shackle is not tight ,it was bound to happen , normally you would tighten it and then you would safety wire the pin 😅
His opinion about where a navy should and should be means nothing.
My first guess is it’s just a rock outcrop.  So can’t to see what it is and how it was over hyped for a rock formation.
That's a nice nice boulder
It's a rock formation - but humans imagination is amazing, so they have to search for it!
good luck in all you do! we need people like you. may the LORD WALK WITH YOU, BETTY
Ballast off an Oil platform? Massive piece of Stone dropped off in the ice age by a Glacier?
IT'S A MANUFACTURED OBJECT  BUT MANUFACTURED BY WHO ????!!!! ✝☦✝
The shape is somewhat round, which always catches the eye, but doesn't seem like anything too special... propably just a rock which moved along the bottom during the ice age
The Bible states that God said to a race due to there evil ways “ I will bury your nations beneath the sea never to be named “ and so he did. We don’t know who or what the race was simply because God did not want us to know. Perhaps you are seeing the remnants of the nations beneath the sea that he buried to do away with.
I the first minute it's obvious they found the Millennium Falcon.....
it looks like aliens have helped caveman civilization with laser beam crafted something that could seal the vulcanic mountain and that could that potentially lead to worship the aliens, and caveman just rolled it down from the who knows where is that mountain today
It’s a fancy blender
It's the Millennium Falcon!!!
Ask Elan Musk
Honestly it doesn’t matter what it turns out to be, what’s most important is they continue to search until they have the answers. Rock or an unknown object, it’s the adventure and the wonder seeking that counts. Keep up the great work gents!
I'm only 5 minutes in and I can already tell this is another vid of 'wishful thinkers" spending a million bucks and years of their lives looking at ANOTHER F'N ROCK...clearly its a simple fractured multipiece circular stone formation. You guys think it looks like a spacecraft from Star Wars movie! Smoke another one and go home to your sci-fi movies. Obviously these guys have too much time. I think the Mars rover team needs people to review their photos too...haha
The Titanic was 12,000 ft deep and they sent subs and cameras.  This thing is 300 ft deep and still they say nothing.  So yeah they probably know what it is.
Looks like iceland volcano..long crack couple of small peaks. Lava spreads out in a circle....
Millinem Falcon.
I would like answers, but there were too many problems on this mission. If this was a convenience in order to keep interest? that's the first question. If it's not, then among other questions, is this outfit's qualifications for finding answers. When you have this many problems with equipment, that means that there is some severe issues with the management. I would question their dedication and work ethic. The equipment should have been tested and readied BEFORE you left port. WELL before. It's clear this wasn't done. And this is why you won't get any more investors.
Could be a meteor/small asteroid full of precious and rare metals or minerals that came screaming into the atmosphere some 400 thousand years ago, melted through the thick ice, split the underwater mound and deposited itself on the sea floor almost fully intact. I imagaine such a find would be very, very valuable.
love how these alien freaks keep dumping money into things but lose it all since its obvious not alien
It is the solidified lava of an upside down vehicle that corroded away after being filled by ... lava you can see the stairs,  giving you the scale of the people inside
Look like a launch pad for Spaceship UFO. Helicopter pad in our time. But antigravity ship pad in time long ago. Yea in ancient time our ancestors have technology that is higher than our current civilization.
Bring in Ballard and his Titanic subs!!!
Its literally nothing lol
If Fox says it, its a lie.
Wait... Sweden and 8 other countries? What's the 8th? Russia No 2?
FN is so annoying for writing that article! And its disgusting-  the people that have threatened them.  I hope they get more funding! Even IF*** they thought it was a UFO, the science used to figure out and test what it REALLY is is still fascinating.
That is the main drain for the Baltic
Maybe it's an earlier OMOHOMOAH ''looiking'' like an ASTEROID BUT WITHIN IT'S INTER SHELL THEY FIND ELECTRNICS AI deviceies or living quteiors .? HA!
The spaceship has been petrified.
do these gobblers have a website?  put all the photos on a website so we can look/download them.
The sad part isn't knowing what was down there, the sad part is the threat to him and his kids.  If they ever find the person or persons who threaten him they should be locked up for LIFE.
Who in the world would believe fox re anything.
Master Chief 117 helmet?
49:57 a faked story on Fox News...go figure
i think it looks like the formation from japan
?
I’m telling you next we’re finding the stargate bro
“What is this mysterious sunken object beneath the Baltic Sea?” It’s the space craft from The movie Independence Day😂😂😂
That’s the first ship that brought us over to earth
It's a rock..... a rock.
Its The Millennium Falcon ! 😃
why files ifykyk
It looks like the Millennium Falcon.
I've been lucky enough to have been on several of these type of expeditions. Often you run out of money before you accomplish the goal. There are two Spanish galleons North of the Bahamas off of Canaveral. We found them with side scan and photo mosaic with an AUV. You can plainly see anchors, cannons, and barrel hoops. Problem is they are in 3,000 fsw. So, they sit.
Occam’s Razor, people: the Baltic Sea is a glacial basin. The majority of the samples were not volcanic in origin—and those that were do not need aliens or Ancient Civilizations to create/move them: glaciers are surprisingly good at that(obviously just the moving part)!
Relax. It’s just a submerged Predator spaceship parked while he goes hunting
A UFO got hit by a Volcanic Lava Splat while in mid air. It would explain the huge drag marks leading to the Object.
The real starship enterprise!
Millennium Falcon
probably the government ready to steal your find.
Its ancient....amazed that the skid marks are still visible behind it as it hit the bottom and slid to its location.  lets just call it what  it is...a crashed UFO, fossilized at best and old.
Fox screws up research and the people’s lives once again.  Shut up fox, go eff yourselves. Pay your fines fox, and get some more.
looks like the millennium falcon lmao
"Worthy of discovering to it's conclusion!"  "Sad some entity that does not want you & your team to finish get full credit yet on a personal level satisfy your curiosity!"  "Astonishing it is & everyone's efforts & courage❣️"  """❣️"""  """👍😎👌"""
If I was super rich I’d fund their whole expedition and get core samples. What a fascinating story
Of COURSE the first UFO we find looks 3xactly like the Millennium Falcon! Makes perfect sense!
One should NEVER believe anything Mainstream media produces.
Make note: 2011-(11) 5:15
Better chance that is the top of a structure
I believe in you guys
Its either nothing or something not from this planet because i would of thought someone with money would have jumped on this so fast when they went public with it...
I saw this on the Osbornes and it really intrigued me!😮
It’s the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo’s gonna be thrilled. 💪🏿
I'm having a "Why not send robots?" moment, since it's so dangerous and also rather dull.
I can't wait till you find out what it is.  But I don't understand how we can recover the Titan but are unable to get any samples from this.
More kudos to them all. Keep going guys.
just recover it
It's the Aluminium Falcon! :D
It's the meliniam falcon!!!
I saw this years ago I think. Yet the video was only uploaded 11 months ago. Are they still trying to raise funds for another expedition?  Perhaps they should borrow one of the confiscated oligarch super yachts😂 and get a crew of volunteers and crowdsource the food and all the rest?  I always wondered why it cost over $20k per day for the first expedition. Surely that is excessive?  Also - how can you be real treasure hunters without your own boat, sonar, LiDAR, diving gear, etc?   Seems a bit sus, but I’d love to find out what it is.
Damn, it looks like the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars!
Also, money is fake, and its sad that things like this can't just be fully "funded" so we can discover amazing things.
The MIB threaten people in the same manner. Sounds like it was definitely a UFO
What's an Aluminum Falcon? Who are they??
The helium voices are funny af 😂😂😂
They found the Millennium Falcon!
Anyone else look at the thumbnail and think "hey that kind of looks like Master Chief's helmet" 😂
Ten thousand years ago, there was a massive flooding event - - Sea levels rose 300 to 400 feet ... Could this be the floor of a very ancient temple/palace that got flooded out of existence???   Or perhaps it is a small, very ancient (millions of years old) volcano that was a one time burp by the earth .... The area is very prone to earthquakes, volcanos (Like Italy, Crete, Etc) and millions of years of continental drift could account for its current location
What I don’t comprehend is that explorers have mapped the Mariana Trenches at over 11 miles deep and even 14 miles below the sea surface with man operated deep sea submarines (like James Cameron) And have DISCOVERED amazing life forms we never knew existed thriving next to volcanic sulfur at 800 degrees in perfect harmony but no one is curious enough to sponsor a man-operated deep-sea dive and finally figure out not only what the first object is, but now a second-found anomaly right next to the original one? Multi-millionaires like Musk, Bezos and others want to invest on trips to Mars, a life barren place that would takes years, billions of dollars and an eight month trip (one way) to freaking Mars that would highly risk the life of its on board voyagers but no one has any interest to explore something that is right here on Earth at 90 meters deep? Are people just so stupid that they will spend millions on a useless voyage to freezing, lifeless, airless Mars with no guaranty of anything useful but right here on our planet a chance of an extraordinary discovery is mocked upon by ignorant people..? No wonder why we never get anything done… People are always afraid of what they don’t know or understand or simply make a mockery out of their short-sighted ignorance… Where is your sense of adventure and discovery? People in general are plainly stupid… Period.
Looks like the millennium falcon to me?
Ancient Aliens, Ancient Civilizations, Ancient Gods could be anything
Another example of Faux news spreading lies and BS. They are very anti science and anti education.
Does no one else see the millennium falcon?
it slid off the land while molten, and then sunk as it cooled?
Aside from the anomaly that itself is unbelievable,  the trail on the sea floor is what really intrigues me.  This really looks like something crashed there!
I think i can help ? ..... Its a rock !  A craft, ship etc would be symmetrical. And not made of stone lol
Hello my friends.  I am a fan from Moose Jaw in Saskatchewan Canada.  I believe like you that this object is special.  I believe it could be a UFO what is there for hundreds or thousands of years. You don't lai someone doesn't like what you discovered. Keep going you are so close . I love you guys. I growed up close to Iceland Ruegen in north east Germany and I believe you.😊
Possibly a meteor that skipped along the top of the sea like a skipping stone rather than a direct impact?
2012metais rudenį vėlu lapkričio vakarą savo sode virš obels pamačiau keista skrendanti objekta disko formos tamsiai raižito protektoriaus konuso formos ir apačia aplink diska žibėjo raudoni žibintai skrido be jokio garso ši fenomena prisimenu lig šiol kas tai❤
Hang in there you can find I believe it is a spaceship that crashed their over 12,000 years ago were the Vikings came from the oceans were 400 ft shallower at that time is spaceships are mentioned in the Bible it very well could be
What if the rock is 140,000 years old but it was moved and carved by humans 12,000 years ago, however while it was over the Scandinavian ice sheat during the last ice age the younger drias impact happened causing the burns on it and sinking it into the Baltic sea.
I didn’t even think they would find anything .like the piece of fur from big foot! Lol big waste of time.
If that is the rock  it might be the footprint of something very hot that burned that shape.
bruh if its a spaceship then why is it made of volcanic rock?
Perdón...pero la expedición q yo comadre llegó a la conclusión q una forma natural d este tipo jamás se pude dar en la naturaleza...la conclusión final d los expertos y los análisis concluyeron q es una nave alienígena d 15.000.000 d años...el caso fue archivado d confidencial máximo secreto.
The millennium falcon
It’s clearly the millennium falcon
Imo, if the news media is poking fun demeaning the expidition, then they were told too by thier handlers.  That is a warning flag to me that it is a crash site of hidden tech they want kept hidden.
Russians left sth to hide maybe radioactive
None the wiser.....
Lol you know what it is
DAMNIT! I greatly admire the people involved in the actual search but this turned out to be just another "ghost hunter"... Perhaps the vid was produced to raise funds but I would have been better off to have just skipped ahead to the last 5 minutes. I knew of course that this would not be an earth changing discovery but expected at least more final discovery than "OH look, now I see a crash site". The End. Seems like some kinky billionaire, and there are many now, would step up for the drilling expedition. Perhaps it has been suggested to them to just "let it go" as in if it is proof of alien visitors millions of years ago it mite upset.....um, every government. Therfore creating a race to recover it.  Oops, accidentally solved the case. Some government has recovered it, rock or not, and deposited it the giant secret warehouse. End of story and my wasted time.  Hope the treasure hunters were compensated to keep quiet.  BTW:I encountered a supersonic to sudden stop large drone sized UFO in early 2021 if anyone interested. And other information.  My time is short so perhaps it's time to share.  rick in Tennessee.  New Years Eve 2023. 10:10pm. CST.
Shame on you if you did not recognized the Millenium Falcon
Government always  has to stick there nose in never want to do the work
Don't give up on searching for the Truth.You have many people out in this world that appreciate what you're doing. You are teaching us that there is more here than what we know .May God Bless you and your family safe from all these ignorant people in this world.
Its the top off a navy gun
I wouldn't be surprised if they secretly got shut down!
You ever see the film "Outlander"?
Ok let’s settle this: Everyone in this thread donates $100 to a GoFundMe so they can dive down to it, & find out it’s a rock.
You often wonder if the Cryogenian Period exfoliated a billion years of geological history into dust and into the oceans. Was there a boom of life, and even civilisation prior to the great glaciers erasing the lot?
I think there's some theatrics going on here. No one cares enough about something not discovered in the ocean to send out death threats. That doesn't add up.
The millennium falcon
The answer is at 56:15😉
That was a great show! So interesting
It crashed at high speed through the mountain and over it got covered with rock sediment.   Ask Elon Musk to give a few million.
This is a wonderful documentary. Thank you. ..
So tired of watching videoes that never come up with a factual conclusion
What I wonder: Was there any check, that it's not some by-product of some more recent construction maybe of some pipeline projects? They tend to even out the sea surface for them. Also, they can get entrenched or covered with dirt. The water was very dirty there, so the dirt on top of it might be rather recent or have happened while some construction.  If it actually was some kind of impact: In that case it rather looks like it happened before there was any water present. That would be like 10k years ago? But then again, there should have been ice then, shouldn't it?
The Stairs at left back is Visible " the Circle shape  at front is the control Cabin room " the cover of stairs is Broken " a way to Cabin is open and can be seen
I feel you when you say we need investigator "
It is UFO the Stairs at left side at back is clearly  Visible " the Control  Cabin at front is Circle  ( the cover of left Piece wich cover the Stairs  is Broken "but this break makes the Enternal way for Cabin left open ( good for research  for inside  "  ( near the Circle  left the enternal way open "
At Odin Fly Dragon it Sunk 463 A.D He & His Viking Left Earth to Aldebaran where they found From Planet Asgard from Norway Area in 473 A.D
Sounds like their next mission should be funded via a libel case against Fox News.
Reach out to Elon!!!
Millennium falcon
A crash sight seems the most logical assessment! I agree!
I wasted time on this video years ago. Its a rock. Just like the one's they dig up on skinwalker
Waste of time.
At first this looks amazing then leaving it for a year I thought that gives the government time to cover this up literally ,then they actually get there do investigations etc , then fix news debunks it eg government etc , but to be honest 120 thousand euros didn't sound expensive to fund this trip , surely they was getting sponsorship money or paid buy news networks , I am sure somebody a billionaire who wouldn't miss a few million like Elon musk , bill gates could just answer this mystery , it would be nothing for them , why didn't a governments get involved is a bigger mystery to me
Look like giant toilet lid for poseidon or Neptune
"I got a bad feeling about this kid"
And again the US media opens its big mouth when it knows NOTHING.   Any person who believes what the media says is a half witted idiot that truly believes in the tooth fairy.  They are nothing but paid political LIARS.    There is also strong  possibility that THAT news agency was paid by a government to say what it did in order to hide the real truth.    Keep your heads up.   I believe you much more than ANY news agency.   They are a laughing joke
18:42 yea you don't just loose the sonar 😂 nice entertainment now just find the object plz
12:13 yea these captions take advantage of anything to prolong the trip if they make 20k a day
WHY NOT A ASTEROID...HOT.  THEN COOLED
Count me in if you need some help at no cost. I frequently dive below 220 with no nitrox, just a computer that tells me when I have to head to the surface. I fully believe these guys are truthful and it's important to see what this thing is.
Everything that is round is an UFO , of curse....😂
If there was something to prove it would have been proven.  I believe UAP come from or hide in the Oceans, but at this point, it ain't a Baltic Sea UFO.  Possibly monolithic though.   Huge respect for the guys doing this against the odds and the public.
It's the Ebon Hawk 🫡
Its a rock
If humans would use less money to w a r we could explore more things like this.
Less war, so we can explore these kind of things.
Small explosive under the corner and then bring back up a piece of it.
They found the Millennium Falcon!
Literally a fossilised UFO.
DEEP STATE  PROPAGANDA MACHINE IN PLAY TO RIDICULE AND DISMAY NAYSAYERS WITH NO INVOLVEMENT SHOULD HAVE  NO SAY,  YET INTERJECT THEMSELVES TO OBSTRUCT THE TRUTH ‼️THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS WHEN ANYONE IS OVER THE TARGET 🎯 GETTING TOO CLOSE JUST LIKE THE DISCOVERY OFF COAST OF NW CUBA. The DEEP STATE HAS AN AGENDA TO KEEP  PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF REALITY    CLASSIFIED.
The Mistake was going   Out to do investigations on such an odd anomaly Underfunded and Underequipped.  Should have attempted to contact    James Cameron or  Other for advisement   and possible Teamwork to Get it done more efficiently
It's obvious there was a lid put on this from above, which proves that they did in fact something.
I'm gonna go way out on a limb here and suggest the second anomaly is also a rock.
Il faut remonter à l'air en surface cet artefact et le sonder avec un radar spécifique surtout le percer avec une drill très dur (?)  pour voir si dessous il y a une carcasse en métal ...?est présente un  engin moderne....ou si c'est uniquement du Roc ? De la pierre>> >Steine ? oder eine echt  raumshif ?.....🤔
I dont think a round. Plate is good for flying
Or a sub broke n half with nuclear waste pouring out of it.
Some alien crafts (UFO) are alive, and that on the bottom of the ocean is just the remains of an once life craft that has now been petrified. Several other cases on land showing this. Yes it looks like magic to us, but just try to picture going back in time to Jesus Christ times with a motorcycle and an iPad, Jesus would bow to you for sure....I sincerely apologize for the extreme example, i do Respect Jesus and his image, this was just to make you see the "magic" effect !!!
They should try to get on Joe Rogens podcast, have a crowd funding and Joe can ask Elon Musk to contribute.  Whole thing can be filmed by James Cameron and the underwater film team that produced the Titanic documentary.    The crash site therory with the mountain split in two was the highlight for me .   Very entertaining.   Could be a rock  formation or could change the very history and belief system of the world if it is a ancient space craft.    Wouldn't that be something to watch the world change knowing our past is very different then the story we have been told.
God designed this universe for humankind if UFO  exist then they should bow down to the creature of the universe!
Is this real, or re creation?🤔
Geology. A huge basaltic block  in a region that is know for the ancient Basaltic shield.
Shocked that people think its a spaceship. If anything its a pre-flood temple base or mount of some sort. Prob why they want to keep it a secret.
Control fake news, control and shape public opinion...
How do you no it looks like a ufo...when there's no proof of one
I still think We are still being told a BS story.
Not sure which is worse... that Murdoch and Fox "news" propegate disinformation and hatred that destroys so many lives, worldwide, or that so many people use Fox as an excuse to harass, defame, and attack others. Either way, I sincerely hope these treasure hunters will, one day, be vindicated, and we, all, find out what this anomaly is. 😊
I guess sending cameras down would have been too easy???
Aliens are definitely Star Wars fans.
What is not mentioned is the tides, and that over thousands of years moving water rounds and smoother rocks. The tides will have hit it head on smoothing the rock, and the trail behind it is made by the water tumbling over and down clearing a path behind it. If you look at clouds tumbling over the tops of mountains, it is the effect. It is a natural rock formation.
57 minutes of speculation, don't waste your time
Fragment of pre ice age temple/monument , draged to present local by glaciers ?
Very interesting, something that crossed my mind was may be someone knows what it is and does not want you to find out too
The shape of this ufo looks very similar to one captured on footage, of one flying in weird ways and too maneuverable, zig zagging, this sort of looks like the pod ufo, from that footage.
I hope they could find a way to continue the expedition. I don't believe this was man made.
God is with you. You will find what you seek. Those who do not believe can find. I believe in you finding
👎👎
Propellerless drone !!! Why don’t you ever talk about it google it it’s man made technology
Milenium falcon.!get harrison ford
why did we nothing hear anymore from this topic??/
Its Milenium Falcon
Looks like an ancient volcano to me. Explains the burned material. But who knows.
With all the technology we have we can't build a remote control submarine about the size of a large fire extinguisher with high-definition cameras and high output LED lights even infrared and UltraViolet cameras on it throw it in the water and just go down and look at stuff like that what's the holdup on remote control submarines untethered of course
Are these the guys that blew up Nord Stream II
Is that black stone, Shungite?
At first glance it looks like the Millennium Falcon.
Gentlemen, DO NOT GIVE UP  stupid people are not going to answer the ⁉️ of what this is . If I had the money!! I'd help. Good luck Men , I'll be watching your progress.
To myself it's shape looks like Hans Solos Ship from Starwars movie  very interesting object
Get samples then you can speculate what it is!!?
Elon Musk can bankroll this project.
If Howard Carter had Given up we may not have had the discovery  of TUTANKHAMUN'S tomb for years  and years  later.
Horrible what closed minded dumb heads  do. Keep on with the dream.
looks like the millenium FALCON HAN SOLO Shes the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy !!
Remember the first episode of Star Wars where they had a war on the water planet when the rebels won the war they made a concrete statue life-size of the Millennium Falcon it's been on the bottom of the Baltic Sea for 500,000 years
Space Chip
Brûlé de la vitesse en entrant dans l'atmosphère.
😮😮😮😮😮 Just Wow 👍👍👍👍👍
FOX News...media parasites of the lowest order...smells like  the lads were getting too  close to the truth..legendary team!
And now the government owns it
I think it's a very large game piece from video game piece pacman ❤ BOB
Is there a part two of this???
Why doesn’t someone shut Fox News down! Their spread of disinformation puts lives at risk, changes elections, and can change the course of modern technological discoveries by keeping people stupid. How dare they destroy this project? The Military Industrial Complex was probably ultimately behind the bad press. I agree with the obvious though controversial answer here, especially due to those last images: that narrow perpendicular slit and path, where such “flight” is normally perpendicular, on its side, like a non-spinning wheel cutting through space. But it finally rested horizontally. What a find this could be!!
A mysterious crached spacechip, in the Baltic sea.
So it's location is around 300' below the surface. We know that sea levels were some 400' lower during the last ice age.  So is it really that far of a stretch to say this was a man made structure from that time period?
Please come to India and have a brief research in Gulf of Cambay to find Sunken City of Dwarka which has been dated at least 10000BCE. Researchers also discovered underwater 350km long manmade wall along the Kokan coastline dated 6000BCE. Current Indian Department is too lazy to conduct any further research.
Truly amazing video. This is something that is I must to be investigated. Bring on those financers
That's not a UFO, it's a millennium falcon, mystery solved.. LOL
If they could get to the remains of the titanic and it was impossible am sure someone can help out and find out what this is ...#TESLA  #CAMERON
Send cameron with his submarine to check it out.
The millennium falcon was my first thought at the sight of it.
It's a shame that no one wants to investigate this further. Even if it is completely natural, the formations are beautiful.
good luck guys wish we knew what it is!
There is a lot more options to explore and finish this in 2023 than 2012. They could start a kickstarter, i guarantee they would have the money for this.  Or.... The cheapest and easiest option would be to simply buy a fifish v6 drone that has all insteuments and 4k cameras, lights etc and can dibe to that depth. The drone cost 4000$ which is very cheap compared to 120k euro rhey spend in 2012. Less than 5000$ and they could solve this. I imagine they could even get a cheaper drone from china.
The object may be so old it might be fossilized which would account for the concrete appearance.
Invite Elon to join you in investigating !
The Millennium Falcon  hidden .
Looks a lot like the Yonaguni monument to me.
50:00 typical fox news, giving fake news 🤣
Why a 3d scan when the actual footage is way more revealing already?
lol basic geology would've helped these fools
If they can take clear pics of the titanic why r pics not clear
Why haven’t they gone back. It’s only 200 feet deep
The thumbnail looks like it’s one of the guns the aliens used in battlefield earth
Ancient building structure
The Millenium Vulcan 😂😂
It’s the millennium falcon , Star Wars is real , chewbaca is big foot
Good thing of YouTube , I skipped right to the end to save 2 hrs and know they know NOTHING , Goose egg , NADA , ZILCH
ahhh,  there's the millenium falcon...... ppffttt
To me it seems its just a stone from an unknown Building made with the same technology used in Machu Picchu or the Pyramids in Egypt
Old capped gas well
I'm sure we'll find out how the Ebon Hawk got down there in KotOR III...
that's EZ,, it's the master chief's helmed!
It looks like they found the Millennium Falcon!
2nd time I watched this and "still" blown away! I wish I had the funds to sponsor this incredible anomoly. avb
I'm sorry what your going through!hang in there! Your explorers
This entire film had no conclusion. Watching it is an exercise in futility. The events could’ve been compressed into 10-15 minutes with no loss of detail. Also; to my eyes, the ‘anomaly’ is geological in origin and its interpretation is simple human pareidolia.
Do I really just have to tell the news about my find to become a little bit richer and to let the whole world know what I found❔
Basically the people who think they run there country's.... Well they don't, there just a front, and all they know is how to exploit the population of there countries.
dig it up and find out
It's a USO unidentified sunken object.
That's my ship if you bring it up I can fly it
Obviously, it is the Millennium Falcon.
It look like the ships people have been seeing and filming just hovering or slowly decending down several vids out there showing it flying upsidedown with side view.about 3 videos are out there a japanese one shows it glowing red
For crist sake let them have their final endeavour for humanity
A: a rock. The End.
You found the millennium falcon 😂
LOL gotta love the LLM trying to say UFO   " U-fo"
we thank you for the effords, most of people critizising sitting in the couch with out doing or trying anything, you guys are the real true spirit of science, and we thank you for that, I personally agree there is something more about this case, we hope you guys can  have the sponser to be avalible to continue searching.
Ok it’s the millennium falcon in carbonite…. Case closed 😅 Your work, getting to the bottom of it is much appreciated
It seemed almost predestined to fail with all of the setbacks, and these divers are risking their lives to go on an exploration in such difficult conditions, and you’re sitting on your couch watching a video complaining about what a waste of your time it is, Wow.  There is obviously something down there. The fact that it’s something that’s been there for god knows how long. It could be a meteorite, or a volcanic anomaly, but the lines being so clear make you question a natural phenomenon. FOX News is not highly revered in the US so I’m on your side. So sad that these people are so ignorant to draw such ridiculous criticism from people who do absolutely nothing worth any note in their entire lives.
Millennium falcon? Or god did it!
it's clearly the Millennium Falcon
Now we know where Han parks the Falcon....
Its Millenium Falcon i saw documentary on it called Star Wars
They want to hide it, they want you not to work on this. You know who. This is a organized tactic.
They should join the guys from Oak Island and turn it into another stupid show that never answers anything .
It looks like the millennium falcon
It's obvious you can see it crashed
It's the millennium falcon  ,come on guys 😊
It made of stone. Nothing more. To bad they can't tell the truth
It's the Millenium Falcon from Star Wars, obviously...
I'm rooting for you guys.😊
A broken top of an entrance of  an inner Lemurian city
It's the Millennium Falcon 😊
Lmao is that the millennium falcon
You can fast forward to about 35 minutes in. They aren't actually on top of the object until then.
it looks like the milenium falcon doesn't it?
I'll help you out and let you know what it is.  It's a rock.
IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON JEJE
Glitch in the matrix.
What do you think about paleoastronautics? And Ancient aliens?  I saw the movies about ancient aliens wooowww the imagination explodes!Very good men keep it up...maybe the God of the Bible was an alien (Elohim!)👽😏
God Bless!!
Greetings explorers, my question is, why didn't you go and look at it after you discovered it? I mean aren't you professional divers and professional treasure hunters. I would think you would have wanted to know what it truly is before you announced it to the media or told anyone else? But, I can still understand that researching something and going down there to explore it does take some careful planning and most importantly, the financial factor. Still, I hope you, yourselves find the truth of this mysterious object and are wise enough to share it with Earth's general public.
Under water volcano?
BS... They will never let us know the truth.. YouTuber BS>>>
Lizzid people!!
It’s an alien ship with a bunch of face huggers
What about the theory that this was a petrified tree?  that maybe fell a long long time ago back in biblical time flooding due to our ice age melts...a fallen tree would cause a canyon wouldn't it?  If you saw a REALLY thick tree would you not want to make a viking ship out of it?...without nails or glue or advanced technology?  Just carving.  Maybe this is petrified stump remains...? who knows....  Maybe this is Yggdrasil.   Sacrificed at the end of the world to save the peoples from the coming floods?  Well their 'end of the world'...in their own version of 'Noah's ark'.  No-erse vs 'No-arch'?  Maybe I'm reaching.  Maybe there's some real evidence of the myth...and they ended up a little further south...Mesopotamia is a bit far though.  Maybe its just the story that travelled and it was a legend they carried from travels further north.   Maybe the flood was significant (think up to 500m)  They'd have to go south and almost reach Mesopotamia, more specifically Turkey just north of there....
One things for sure if it was anything worthwhile NO ONE would be able to get withing a mile of it, So yeah, its nothing
Its the Millennium Falcon, duh!
It is the Millenium Falcon
It's obviously the Millennium Falcon
No a good documentary of this strange thing: Only raises questions (some of them rather outlandish) without even bothering to try to answer them (and never bringing them up again): Why is the water suddenly -1 degree celcius cold? Why is the swedish navy there? What are the rocks they brought up made of?  What do actual scientists say and why? etc. etc. Waste of time. 🙄
Let us know when you discover what it is, then make a documentary about it, rather than waste our time.......
almost seems like someone don't want you to find out what it really is
Jeg synes dere ikke skal gi opp.  Verden er fylt med mye som det blå øye ikke kan forstå, men er det ikke litt av gleden av å være i livet, å utforske det unaturlige frem til det er gjort naturlig? Hvor mye penger det snakk om,  må da være noen med en fet lommebok som vil støtte prosjekte, med mindre vi snakker om menn i svart uniform som truer familier og barn, men faen ta dem, gi dem ikke det siste ordet?
Only morons would think these guys were hoaxing this. They should not worry about what brainless sheepeople think!!!
Millennium Falcon
I'm just wondering how the Millennium Falcon got to the bottom of the Baltic Sea 🤔
This is what happens when you find something they don't want you to find. They don't want history changed.
Milinium Falcon.
This "looks" like a bed of rock polished by and advancing glacier before the oceans rose after the las ice age, and that's just what it is!!
I'll tell you what it was it was a civilization at that point in time before the water came up as it is to day
Pffff nothing found
What if it is just a rock modified by erosion during billion of years , I am just wondering 😊  Ah its just that ,so why are they looking for more?
Should have spoken to the experts scientist first before there made the first trip
I think this was poorly planned and lack of high tech equipment and definitely lack of funds to do this properly.
I hope someday that will turn out to be very interesting.
Normally they have to say it is an USO.  An Unidentified sunken object because it isn't really flying anymore.:)
I knew it. It is bigger than it seems under the seabed! It looks Very much like an interstellar space craft from star trek. This site absolutely needs to be investigated further!
Is it me or doesn’t it look like the millennium falcon in the underwater pics at the start of the vid?
Millions of dollars to drill? no wonder people think you are full of BS! There are about 50 other ways to determine what the rock is.
Why were they sent threat letters????!!!!  i don't get it!  I mean you can say someone is a fraud, or a con, or a fake, but why would you go after someone's child?  This make no sense...  They are obviously on to something, someone actually want very badly...
When you drop metal in water what happens after 6000 what do you think it will look like? You are looking at it
I don't think it crashed it landed there it has a heat shield just like the space shuttle does maybe it's like Noah's ark kinda someday when we get inside we will learn the story the legend of the fallen angels has merit how did the get hear it's a perfect place to ditch a large vehicle I don't think we are alone another thought what if it can still fly
What if we say it's a space craft I think the black rock is like the tiles we plate the space shuttle with for a heat shield if it's wreckage who is it's descendents provided it's an abandoned ship from space it would be great to get inside the craft
Too bad they can't ignore losers who are trying to make them look bad, and just do what they do,  they keep searching... keep doing what you do,  people will always be losers, ignore them !!!
I'm drawn to the rich depth of this material. A book with parallel content revolutionized my worldview. "The Silent Bridge: Echoes of the Unspoken Past" by Emma Wick
American style movie about absence of money.
You know if it's great importance and not man made when higher power that be try to shut you  down
What a gave cgsnnrl and magazine...lirs and more lies
i’m just going to say one word SOSUS (think cold war)
🤐👀
I feel extremely lucky to be living in a time where our government is FINALLY developing a plan to disclose the truth about the UA or UFO phenomenon. While it’s highly unlikely we will ever be told the true extent or even the true purpose for the visitation there is a ten year plan for disclosure in steps. I think the reason why ufos have been steadily increasing since 1940s is obviously because of our creation of nuclear technology. Many ufos have been to MANY different nuclear silos and demonstrated their ability to render them useless. Hopefully they are concerned for our safety as humans but it’s more likely they are concerned with the environment
That's a Millennium Falcon
Much ado about nothing. From the very beginning of the show I could see it was rock. Likely a basalt column. Perhaps having a good background in geology was helpful. In the end, all the evidence recovered after millions spent to dive it is some type of intrusive rock. Whoopee. Big deal.
It's a tree stump that was carved out and petrified
I can’t believe you don’t have a GPS on the first contact
I think it did the Kessel Runnin 12 parsecs
It looks just like a ufo crash site from a very long time ago.
I is a. UFO. Simple as. THAT. !!
known kowledge is already here....use remote viewing or astral travel.... to seek knowledge. agencies all use these.... so whats the problem ?????
.
I wish I had the funds. Because I truly believe that what that is is something Big... I'm not just talking about the size... Haha... No. That might be a door or a craft. Something from or to another world.
It's a rock, carried there by an iceberg in which the rock was stuck. As the iceberg melted it sunk under the weight of the rock, and left the trail you can  see on the bottom. Not so common occurrence but well documented. There mystery solved.
Anything round is a UFO. I got two UFOs between my legs!😂
They should contact Trump about how to raise the funds to recover the item below the surface. He seems to have 'grifting' large amounts of cash from the public down to a science! Perhaps, he would be willing to offer his 'grifting' expertise to a good cause and do something constructive for society for a change!
Judging by the photo it may be a pre flood part of a  dock for boats  when the baltic sea was smaller
great work
, I can't understand how people can be so mean to you. This is so interesting to actually find out what it is even if it is just a piece of concrete that fell off a ship it doesn't matter you need to know what it is. We would all be amazed if we knew what was at the bottom of the sea.
looks like the millenium falcon lol
Documentary started and I knew the same once finished: nothing.
It’s a show about looking and problems one after another .. Why didn’t they start at the site without the  aggravating tease .
I would love to see and analyze his samples..a craft indeed but how old..may compare to the AIUD in Romania..?
I personally think the object in the black sea started off above water and got pushed there by glaciation.
bunch of profiteering b.s. if you ask me. Yes, it looks manufactured but what these videos don't want to mention is that it looks precisely like an old Russian Battleship turret. More exciting to say spaceship.
The shadow group will never let u know the truth. Its planned.
When Fox News is involved you get sickos involved as well
IT IS THE MILLENNIUM FALCON
This thing has similarities to the alleged black knight satellite photos
It’s a rock , nothing to see here .
I can identify it just fine its the millennium falcon alright :-D
It's the Millennium Falcon. I thought that was pretty obvious. That's just me. 😊
Looks like an ancient tree stump cut down and burnt afterwards
it doesn't look like a pile of Rocks to me
ask mr beast for sponsor im sure he will do it #mrbeast
They need a guy like James Cameron who made the Titanic documentary.. kind of money to finish this exploration.
There is no such thing as a coincident!
Remnants of the debris pushed by the glacier. it is very common.
These guys I have advise never read negative comments. These negative miron are just have sad life so they  mirroring their mental issues.
I wish To be continue
Pretty  much 95%  of  everything except  the  object, pointless waste of time.
❤❤
Mysterious and intriguing! 🌊🔍 'What Is This Sunken Object Beneath The Baltic Sea?' had me hooked from start to finish. Kudos to the creators for fueling our curiosity with this captivating exploration.
If only America returned the peoples Gold they stole from Qaddafi people here would not be suffering.
So basically it's not natural, in fact it does look like something that has crashed, and they are not going to bother to go down again to see what it is because they are skint? Well I dare say the pesky military will have been and had a look, kinda suspicious that warship appearing at start of search. The gist is, unless some rich type funds another expedition then nobody will ever know.... well that's just great that innit! 🙄
Aliens have technology to turn everything to a rock
It’s the Millennium Facon 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
I dont need to be told......thats the Millinenium Falcon!!!
It looks man made, cyrcle surrounded by a rectangle proves intellect. I personally don't trust the science which in my experience proved it is nothing but a religious fiction that requires FAITH
This is to stop you finding the truth as always this is done to stop the truth good for you keep going.
Its a natural phenomena ie a Volcanic plug.
How can people be so nasty. Theses guys literally risk their lives. And get nasty comments. Mankind baffles me sometimes. I just want to say thank you guys for diving and goin to find out about this object. I love things like this. Thank you for risking your lives. If you ever see this comment. 🙏🏼
It's a crashed Essani ship been down there thousands of years its turned to stone. Break in ya find remains of crew. Dust etc.
It is a craft/ship. Inner dimensional more than likely.
Looks a little like the Millenium Falcon
it is a ancient space craft its not built by human
Fox News supports Trumpism ,do we need to say more. There are so many sad people on this planet who have nothing better to do than mock the adventurers. Do not stop seeking the truth.
It is obviously an alter that was used by an unknown civilization before enormous sheets of ice had melted, flooding inhabited portions of earth, mostly coastlines, but also Doggerland. If underwater archeologists ever did an extensive study of the bottom on the Baltic Sea, history books would need to be rewritten.  Every 14 to 26 thousand years, our planet suffers a major deluge, setting back humanity and knowledge to year zero. Right back to the stone age.  This is information Governments everywhere DONT want us to know
So we learned nothing...
You mean to tell me that I wasted 52 minutes of my life to find out that this is an OG volcano that just got used up?
Great documentary but... why he say Ufo like that 😂😂😂
Good luck to the Crew i hope it will Go further!!!
You guys are fantastic god bless I believe  I. You from Australia
Follow your hearts it’s what you believe in peoples threats are just words words don’t hurt any world wonder was done by determination there are hateful people and jealous people you have a goal they don’t that’s why they have all the time in the world to discriminate may you be safe and follow your heart many great thing in the ocean we don’t know about and need to understand the world.
Ruins from the time period that area wasn’t covered by water?
Looks like they found the Millennium Falcon.
The earth is 4,500,000,000 years old. I have to keep reminding myself that, there are things we have no idea about. We are smart, all we know and understand is created by our brains, man made, we try and prove our theories correctly by scientific evidence and some people just hope and pray.
Next time you could try to hert Natnll Geographic or a smaller ship.  The core samples need be only 50 feet the lab tests might cost more.
Nice try guys. Keep looking. Since no one else is interested no one else could be looking to get at it. I’ll bet there are others out there right now doing chemical and forensic lab tests on samples. You might consider placing some kind of thermal And IR observations of the site while you are waiting for new funds.  Another idea is to crowd fund it for a tiny part of the findings.  Now that Pandora’s box has been opened you will have to act quickly.
ok that is EXACTLY shaped the The Millenium Falcon! Holy S^^^!
How can i get branded merchandise?
Looks spot on like a Millennium Falcon ship from Star Wars.
More of less it was a burnt rock, volcanic rock. Hopefully this saves yourself some time
I wish a lot of success to Ocean X team !
This is Click Bait. Nothing to see here unless you are the type to believe in Angels.
Crack open some of that historical bubbly 🍾  I want to taste history 🤟
Wow this is something you don't get to sea everyday, I watch a lots of exploration programs and I'm so wanting to know the rest of your find leads too. Yes the government sabotage your finding, tracked your first move by having a media on board lots objects?. Its almost watching Nikola Tesla again, hoax, media, threats, sad sack of bull dust, its one of the best finds I've seen. You need a scientist to further your research your stone is your archeological find name your stone use it for further research, yes it does look like a crash landing. This will alter the world's history as a lie is that what they are scared off because the truth has been  hidden far too loooooong. ❤❤❤❤❤
they made a big mistake going public without getting it out of the water first. there are people that work for the government that are literally paid to silence people like this who find ET objects. and as soon as they are alerted of this news , it would have taken them no time at all to swoop up on it and plant something else entirely down there to disprove the theories and cover it up. idk I just wouldn't have did that until it was all brought to the surface and examined.
Disgusting and evil messages threatening to harm children even if it is just a bluff to cause anger. I believe those threats are just empty words to cause emotional harm. Still horrible to receive them yes. The local government or police should try find the evil ppl who sent them. I personally would donate to Dennis and help fund a second investigation. Hope Dennis keeps up the fight, also Dennis has the EXPERTS opinions that this object is something unusual and must be investigated more.
why can't a UFO be made of Stone, best to stop radiation in space, can still have a interior and core engine, need to scan it somehow.  A hollow asteroid would be great to travel the stars, maybe molded or carved. needs more investigation imo regardless of what it is, Imagination drives us to look and learn, even if it turns out a odd natural thing. the journey in learning is worth it.
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY OR ELON MUSK? THIS IS A 'BIG BUDGET' PROJECT.
HAS JAMES CAMERON(TITANIC MOVIE DIRECTOR) AND SPONSORS OFFER ANY INTEREST IN THIS PROJECT?
Don't say anything until we figure out what it is..... They don't have any answers, but still they tell it to the media... 😅😅😅 What a secret keepers I think I can trust them to keep my secrets and tell them where I hide my treasures. Do tell them too, they sure are legit promise keepers.. 😂 I'm sure you're secrets are kept and treasures are safe even you face an accident and even if you lose your life. You're treasures will never be seen even after a million years just like the treasure of king Solomon😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Trench from this UFO made is from Russia / Black Sea to the Baltic sea thats what i have heard from experts around the world a trench that is hundreds if not thousands of kilometers long
Northern Europe Peoples &n Alien Ship instantly "Thing from another World" Vibes
more bs with no results
The sinister threatening messages  Says to me that maybe some kind of  government agency is trying to scare them away  fantastic documentary  keep up the good work guys 👍
What a waste of time.  No answers at all lol
Dont gif up  Everithing is possibel in this universum
Same as Oak Island
Pfffffffffffffffff
Initially I thought it was an eroded conning tower of a sunken wreck. It could be pre-historic ruins. We know they exist and generally don't tell us much about pre-history. I'd imagine as technology becomes more sophistocated, we'll find many more under land and sea.
it could also possible that it is a petrified stone, metal turned into rock due to extreme heat like from atmosphere going into the water
Looks even likfalllen tower or thrown disk or crashed disk like what we sent
🚫Click.bait..
The title picture on seeing it my first thought was it's a cylon fighter ship.
YouTube is now full of nonsense.  It is just a natural formation 😂.
I’m very confused as to why he’s getting threatening messages to him about his family? Nothing stranger than people 🤷🏻‍♀️
Looks geological … not supernatural.
Lake Titicaca..
Starts at 54:30
Sick haters hate. I believe in the project. We need answers, not from the fake news company Fox News, science needs to explaining what it is.
I think it's a ceremony area during doggerland times .low water lots of land and spread out people..if it's a petrified alien wreck. Cool ..its like Japan's yonoguni
We all no there are aliens in the univurse and the new world order dont want the people on earth no
The only problem with that is we've seen an object before years ago, many years ago
No matter if it’s a rock or UFO, it would be interesting to find out. Any discovery by humans underwater is fascinating. It is an anomaly to the region, considering the surrounding area, that’s what makes it intriguing. I wish I had millions of dollars to fund these guys to do further exploration and tests.
I wonder if James Cameron would be interested?
Clearly something is potentially there and someone turned the public against them.
Those threats are shameful and I don't understand what ppl are afraid of - I know a few Christians who get really unbalanced over stuff like this - I hope they discover something that turns the world upside down and they are rewarded  well
I wanted to watch but after the first six minutes it was clear just the usual maybe 10 minutes of useful information stretched out to an hour with scripted drama. No thanks.
Nothing but the fossil of a billion year old giant stingray fish
Alliens can make objects looks like vulcanic debris or anything.... but beneath that cover there is something there that they didnt see at all....i wish that you could continue that expedition sir good luck guys....
What if this is evidence of a created thing but not the thing itself...I'm thinking the original might have gotten filled with mud that hardened to stone. Maybe this is a casting.
Chasing a  dream... This is most probably a stone. But that fact doesn't sell. I'm not buying into this.
It’s a complete waste of time money and effort at the risk of life.

The first thing I thought when I saw the image was "No, that does not look like a UFO, that looks like the Millennium Falcon." I also felt a shiver down my spine and alamost had goosebumps
But its just a huge rock.
🚨 FURTHER PROOF that certain things arent actually "illegal" for certain people, there's just a price for it.  So Bowman(D) gets away with lying, saying he doesn't know how fire alarms and doors work🙄 & saying he was in a rush to leave the building yet he didnt even TRY to open the doors after doing it. Above all, he committed the crime of Trying To Interrupt An Official Government Proceeding - which we have been told is absolutely an INSURRECTION and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.  Yet another valid reason to hate the left
It may contain live beings... dangerous beings...
NASA has plenty of money....failing that..Biden is rolling in it..😂
So frustrating...😢
This is what these shows all do tell us 90% of it the 10th that's most important which is the answer they don't
All the hype against them makes me think not less that it's something extraordinary but more. Almost seems there is something the controllers of the media don't want the world to know about going on down there.
Millenium Falcon.
It's the Millennium Falcon
Great! They finally found the Millennium Falcon. 🛸
That's Captain Solo's spaceship, but where's Chewy?
They need a better under water drone - with a drill... or to place some small explosives... something like a manned submersible
It’s the unknown that advances mankind, sadly that focus has shifted🤮
Its the Millennium Falcon!!!! CHEWIE!!!!!
FOX did this before, with  the 2000 elections. They  lied about, Bush (jr) won  (US) elections from Gore.  And that made Gore lose.  (Comment about 50:03)
Looks like the shape of the millennium falcon
I think it's a lost Russian aircraft or a top secret missile. It couldn't be retrieved so they increased in concrete instead.
It is a π∆¥√€
Is this a documentary about the problems this expedition encountered or is it a documentary about a piece of volcanic rock. Either way it's not worth watching.
we are the aliens ,, the human race was created to be a vessel for our soul .. being  ,, whatever you want to call it ,, when we die our soul is released back in to space waiting for another birth . we only can remember like a dream our past  .. thats why we feel we have done things before .. energy never dies
congrats, you found a rock in the ocean 🤣🤣🤣🤣
IT'S A ROCK for Christ sakes.
I would straight up drop a few million to know. If I ever win the lottery, boom. Financed.
Looks very old~ Brilliant deduction. Dont waste your time here, frusrating and it has ads too.
I’m not a sonar expert, or whatever was used to capture this reading, but I’m 99% sure that’s the Millennium Falcon. Edit: 6:25
They found the millennium falcon.. 😏
Well?  Obviously it wasn't alien.  LOL
At 94 years old, i'm finally getting the drift to move the story to the end without watching all the entreage. After, I don't feel like a boob that I started to believe a wild goose nothing story.....
put simply ... its a photoshopped nothing ... its so bad a fake it looks like the millenium falcon ffs .... joke !
Their are actually two objects which they discovered during the original discovery years ago! Or are this a rehashing of the first time.  The smaller object appears to have detached and went towards the right a of the parent object.  Both objects left a trail on the seabed floor…
Everybody knows that fox news are always lying... If you look in the dictionaries under ( DISHONEST ) you will find the picture of Fox board members!
It's a stone formation that mimics the most well known movie spaceship of all time. Our brains see this formstion as man made Its just stone. Period.
A seaworthy ship is needed first.
People are idiots.i wish you luck finding the truth..don't give up.
40 minutes of maybe, possibly, if  etc etc etc...   ie 40 minutes of wasted time.
Straight out of Star Wars!!
Regardless of the answers a boring one or a fantastically amazing mind-blowing one he answers are equally necessary maybe it is a meteor that skidded to a stop long ago it definitely warrants a sampling and further investigation you never know the level of it's value from a simple sampling it definitely in my opinion looks like something that crashed and skidded along the sea floor the seafloor it may have serious significance to our past Peter and Dennis keep up the damn good work Endeavor to persevere you have more support then you are aware of blessings in good health to you and yours
Look like the millenium falcon!!
If Fox News says one thing, believe the opposite to be true.
Dennis looks like Hollywood movie director Christopher Nolan,
Even pyramids made of volcanic rock(of advanced structural designs) exist, so maybe this is another structure made of volcanic rock
These mysteries are so exciting to watch. Praying for a part 2.
Oh, you're the captain! Yeah, skipper we are needing to go back to port, now.
It’s a hair barre
54:56 honestly just looks like a underwater volcano with a lava flow🌋... Maybe you should petition Elon Musk for further funding🤑
And... instead of finding out about our past, our potential, we get endless wars.😂😢🤬
Omg STOP calling it a UFO. Is it flying?? No. It isnt. Call it a USO (unidentified sunken object)
If is was a USO that came up through a Lava Tube or was investigating a nearby volcano while taking samples it would be possible that the ship got coated with lava or debris which added to it's weight and caused the craft to become unstable . This would be a good reason for the object to crash considering that if the occupant of the craft wanted to cool the outer shell down . After the craft entered into the water it  impacted that ridge and damaged it's systems which is where it was found . I have seen another view of the object but it looked like something broke off of it which created another track on the sea bed before it came to rest . If it was broken off after it hit that under water ridge then it could be a part of the craft however if it separated from the main body of the craft before it hit the underwater ridge then it could be where the pilot  ejected a cockpit thinking that the craft was about to explode .. Of course the thin layer of debris may have damaged the flight capability of the escape cockpit which would have worked it they would have had a problem with the main body of the craft outside of the atmosphere .. Of course this is pure speculation . Really I don't see why the US military couldn't modify the front of one of it's regular military subs with a drill kit and other implements to just navigate to the object and take samples then surface to a waiting ship to deliver the samples . they need to spend hours if not days in direct contact with that object in order to get samples and if it was a space ship maybe even find away to get inside of it . They announced on CNN that UFO's / UAP's were real so whats the problem " Yes this is wishful thinking !!! The whole world needs to get behind Ocean X including Space X I am sure that he would want his own UFO to study because his mission to Mars may start in the Baltic Sea !
amazing documentary. these guys are like heroes to me, they know what they found is not natural and i think the governments know this and purposely shared false information on the mainstream media to lower their morale, the email threatening his family is very suspicious too, probably from the military or some other agency to scare them from exploring it even more. these treasure hunters are the real deal though, they know they found something unusual, maybe some sort of ancient technology belonging to an ancient advanced civilisation, what if this thing came from inside the earth or was a craft that was for exploring inner earth, it could explain the volcanic rock, maybe the craft is inside the volcanic shell. I would love to explore the ocean, i think theres a world within our world right now.
Okay, so. if they finally ID this object ( and the video was uploaded eight months ago) will the people that ID it as something interplanetary, be allowed to say so???  Surely something that looks like a ship from Battlestar Galactica can be looked at by a small ROV? Get James Cameron on to it?!
They found the aluminum falcon 😂
Could this be the ufo that bigfoot came to our planet in  tha crashed
The thumbnail looks like Masterchiefs helmet.
pause at 44:11 and look just above the straightline edge....does that look like some sort of writing, or symbols or heiroglyphs?
I love this anomalous object so much. I've been following it since 2013.
Millenium falcon
If they could propose,an Event before the Earth was Flooded!
I bet the side scan sonar collided with a navy submarine.
meteorite.... no mystery here.
Did they found out yet? It’s only 300 feet! The Gasprom pipeline was not much deeper and without problems taken care of.
Now do you believe in FAKE NEWS, whoever controls the News controls the people. When the government doesn't want you to really find out what it is they spread Disinformation.
"It looked like a UFO."  UFO's fly, silly. It looks like ruins.
If they think something metallic might be under the dirt, go magnet fishing!
I believe this was finally debunked and turned out to be part of a regular ship.
Did they take pictures?
Well this is very obvious isn't it? They found something worthy of investigating but unfortunately they were pulled through the mud in order to blacklist this historic find..sorry gentlemen
WTF!… this story is several years old now.   Although mighty intriguing why is there no follow-up? Why hasn’t any of the well funded, better equipped deep sea explorers come back for a more comprehensive look? Why!
Hang in
This world is filled to the brim with uneducated, who are like lemmings, just allow others to dictate thier actions along with emotions how sad
Hans Solo is inside in a deep sleep in Carbonite. Jabba the Hutt put him there.
What a load of procrastinated tosh.
It’s a natural rock formation .
Looks like the Millennium Falcon
I don't understand. They are called _"Ocean X Team"._ Why didn't they contact Elon Musk?
Millennium Falcon!
It could be stairs to another pyramid ?? That in time has been eroded !!
Clearly it’s the millennium falcon
Nothing short of fascinating!! Both the crew involved in this discovery and the actual anomaly/structure/craft itself. I'm baffled by it's appearance and the surrounding discoveries which really do seem linked to the 'millennium falcon' and it's situational position. I would be yet further baffled if it turned out to be something completely natural or mundane. How are we supposed to believe or accept that it is just that?? I really do hope you can to solve this. Love, respect, strength and of course safety to the crew.
Ask elon
AN UNDERSEA HORHOUSE ?
🙏
Crowd funding!
Has there ever been a documentary that answers the damn question?
nothing burger, waste of time
That's the plug for the oceans. Don't pull that out whatever you do !!
That's were the ides  start wars came from they been found it uears ago
Its a UFO 🛸  clearly  the government has blocked of that area from the world 🌎
It's Obviously Harrison Fords Weekend Galaxy Hopper!
Really enjoyed this video.  Would love to see you persue it a bit more.  When you have more and better luck.  All the best wishes for a spectacular discovery, you guys!  Geat work!
Did they use a metal detector to see if it’s a metal hull?
Well the United States has little green men from outerspace they studying along with parts of craft after crash
if I were rich like Besos or Musk I would for sure take an advanced submarine to go investigate more, and take these guys along, with some other experts / scientists
Strange how it looks identical to the millennium falcon space ship from the star wars movies.
Keep fighting and fundraising! We have to find out what this thing is. It is so exciting! Where do we buy the t-shirts?
I know what that object is ,  that's the millennium falcon....
How's the fundraising going for this project? Would love to see the follow-up! ps... Fox News... they lost their credibility a long long time ago.

tell them most die in sleep between  3 and 4 am.what?
Hey guys. I honestly respect and admire what you have done and what you continue to do.   I will be completely honest with you guys and say this, i don't believe in UFOs. I am 42 years old, when i was 12 u was standing by the window one very late night and up in the sky far away i seen something that i couldn't explain, i was not dreaming, i w as very awake and it was very real. and to this day it is burned into the back of my mind. It is something that i will never forget, ever. So i say i don't believe in UFOs.  That night i leaned the difference in believing and KNOWING.   I KNOW THEY ARE REAL.  Maybe your bad luck of uncovering the truth isn't really bad luck at all. Maybe it is meant to be simply because its just not the time  for the rest of the world to KNOW and Understand the truth. I know what i know because of what i saw. And you guys know what you know because of what you found.   When the time comes for the world to know , i know you guys will be there on your boat with the proof and the truth to show the world.
Urrrgh don't watch this - Is all drama and nothing to show for it. Literally nothing is found out. Waste of time
Fox News were the ones who started the hoax theory. Think about that.  Maybe the government know something and to stop the truth being found out they had to stop another dive, and the only way they could that is by creating the hoax theory, and it worked.
I truly hope you guys make your way down there again. Prove to everyone just how ignorant their messages were. Good luck I have a feeling people are discouraging you because they may very well be the same people following you out there and trying to scare you away from it.
Truth it is  Fly Falcon made by Odin in 469 A.D Viking . Odin Found Plans of Atlantis , He Lost at One It did not Work Right,  but he Build One in 473 A.D Left The Earth to Aldebaran Odin & Crew Found New Atlantis 100% Human ,Atlantis Escape The Earth in 4033 B.C Same Time of NOAH Flood . Odin Found Planet They Call Asgard 100 % Human & Planet Asgard & Planet New Atlantis Work Together To This Day. : 40:49 Please Do Not Died Sir
Is there IRON in it. ??
Yeah,me too, totally worthless
Im telling you there is a universe out there somewhere.  And they say "You-Fo" and ours is the weird way. To be honest it seems odd not to call them that now.
That's a shame for people to mock these fellas,grow up people, stop this mocking,if I was a rich person, I would sponsor you for another expedition
Its just a rock.
fox news are rubbish.
😂😂😂 what a terrible excuse of a ‘documentary’ 🤦‍♂️
Han Solo "I'm in the shower Chewy, just put it down in Sweden"
Its the meliunium falcon
I think that it is visitors from another galaxy, and the o degrees at the top is some type of cryo sleep pod emissions 😮😮😮😮
Videos of this thing what ever it is are made, but no one knows what it is, all the technology we have what is it
It reminds me of that film I think it was spire or something like that and they found a ship under the water that had come back in time from the foucher I'm trying to think who was in the film I think that samuel Jackson was in it and Jodie foster I think but yeah
It's a ship,it's in hibernation,and not made by man
Before the flood all of this was above land, but when the flood came it took them all away.
You all keep up the good work ,I am a big fan keep exploring ..you can't keep good men down!!
Chuwakka supposed to fix the landing gear. Falcon got stuck on the ice. Then it sank when the ice melted.
Simple question is what is this strange Anomoly? Kts is clearly there with the grove and track like image along wuth the smaller one Slow close up  side scanning ultra sound scanning surface samplimg drilling cores ect Should be attempted. Shapes are made? nature does not dom art work or complex clean items? nature dose not cleanup but leaves skree deposites.
The people;e that send bad remarks about this is because they do not want you to find the truth, and it is probably the anti, ufo people truth hurts some people because they have problems believing that we are not the only beings in the whole universe, only simple minds think we are alone, I do hope that you can continue perhaps start up a fund on youtube for believrs to fund you.
Han Solo caught in 4k
That definitely is a crash site … smh. I don’t know why the powers that govern don’t want the truth out there
So Star Wars is true, George Lucas is a time traveler, and he “Luked” the millennium falcon in the Baltic Sea……. Got it
I bet there is a Wookie still in there.
OMG! They found the Millennium Falcon!!!
Don't watch. Waste of time. Literally.
Ask elon musk to help out! It needs an answer!
Let me guess, all these guy's are mormons.
Good grief, it's not a UFO, it's the Millennium Falcon!
It's a temple.
Ahhh they found the Millenium Falcon!!!! 😅
They have found nothing, because there is nothing to find out.
I do hope all you get to find out what is down there, don't give up,, there is always nay sayers,they must have a very negative life, also nothing going on in their own lives. Good luck .Noreen Australia 🦘
Thats so disgusting to have your fans and followers to turn against you like that and simply make fun and have the audacity to threaten them and their families. i hope for the expedition to relaunch and have them make the greatest discoveries.
The fiber wanted to tell what he seen but he kept in he saw something he just doesn't wanna speak on it maybe because of the cameras being there
Omg what are they hiding from us.why did they not get help    when they found it .to me they still don't want us to know.
another cover up
Watch the end 5 minutes, and you ll thank me for saving your time.
It's the Millennium Falcon!
Id bet its a sedimentary rock formation. I see them all over The Burren here in western Ireland. With the exact same lines througj the limestone rock. In fact, Ive filmed rock formations exactly like this under the lakes in lough Urlar and Lough Mask, which are covered in fossilized coral ( look up Urlar lake on youtube and you'll see my film). If you search for images of the Burren Karst region in Ireland, you will see images exactly like this.
1:17 summed up the whole video or "Documentary".
I'm unsubscribing. This channel is nothing but round and round, chase your tail, beginning to end, redundancy, with very little actual information. Every video is just question, speculation, possibility  and doesn't even have the confidence to offer conjecture.
55:18 a shaggy dog on the bottom
We should crowd source these cats. This has been a mystery that caught my attention and imagination when it first hit the intrawaves back in 2011
It looks like a UFO to me, with a landing or crash trail.
I believe that the space object (300-1000 ft) swishing by earth in 2017, and given the name OUMUAMUA, was a spaceship because of its many strange features  and unique acceleration which meteors cannot do. Till now scientists are befuddled but concluded it's an anomaly. I think it has intelligence of some kind. A similar but larger object shaped much like Oumuamua was recorded sticking out of the distant clouds motionless (It looked just like Oumuamua itself visiting earth on it's way out to outer space). Makes good comparion with this Baltic Sea object.. It must be a spaceship just like Oumuamua, strange rock-appearance spaceship, doesn't have skin of molded aluminum like modern aircraft. If you scan that object you might find it hollow with some petrified occupants. Note that the skid marks behind it is lengthy so we can rule out a sinking vehicle. It was a flying obect in its final resting place a billions years ago. Built of volcanc material to withstand the heat of the sun, just like its brother Oumuamua..
That sucks you found something or fox would not have been made to throw a wench in your wheel!! I don’t believe what they say!! And if you feel in your gut that it’s something more than a rock!! Keep pushing!! Keep fighting!! For yourself and for humanity!! Much love and light!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WE NEED PEOPLE TO KEEP PUSHING THAT ENVELOPE
I wish these men the best, and pray they are able, at some point, to continue their investigation!  Good luck and God Bless to Peter and Dennis!!!
The ocean has been explored a mere  5% I’m sure there’s a lot of things down there yet to be found that would shatter our puny one sided minds!
Curious why theyre having so much trouble finding it since theyve already located it once before. For the threats, those are idiots copying spy show dialogue on Tv.
kept waiting for Millennium Falcon comments.
The top has been used as a quarry to remove blocks. Look at ancient monuments in the area for the same stone in use.
Set up a go fund me.
Yay! Finally an actual program rather than a narration with stock photos.
Man, it's the Millennium Falcon!!!
WTF! waste my time did not get any final result!
Same old info, falsely presented as of with new Intel.
Spoiler: Just rock formation.
Yeah watched the whole blah blog.  I'm just glad I didn't postpone something important in order to watch this nothing burger.
The fact that over 2 million have viewed this video just means that there is a financer in the bunch, willing to flip off those who have threatened, in order for this team to finish what they started. I would like to purchase some of the clothing in order to help, but there is no direct link. Can anyone provide me a link?
Get Cameron to dive there and investigate. The Titanic is ove.Explore something new like this. They won't because History is all a BIG LIE.
It is said that all technology shuts off at a certain distance from the object. Obviously that isn't true.
What happened at the end of this video is very typical of humans. He has discovered the very very dark side of humanity. The Lidar image shows that it was a crash. I totally agree with the team. Consider what would have happened if Omuamua had made a low-angle skid crash into the Baltic. It would look just like this.
How we can help ?
I do hope that you all can finish the search to prove those that said you all are fake wrong good luck in the future
It's the MILLENNIUM FALCON!
there ancient weapon mouldings
Interesting. But why you don't use magnetometer and other devices to find out is there any metals? Easy and cheap way to be sure is there any metallic structures.  Professionals should do that right away, before sending any divers...  Best Regards.  Markus From Finland
Looks like the millennium falcon lmao, this is getting ridiculous 😊
Don't know how you named it but I'm pretty sure the thing made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs
The fact that the military were out there and that afterwards media started to give these guys a bad rep tells me there is more to this and they already know about it. Something like this shouldnt stay unanswered. Because that is still what it is, unanswered. If I ever win a big time lottery pot, ill be happy to donate and sponsor this cause if it helps.
Really u r amazing..
It’s the millennium falcon from Star Wars 😂
There is one almost like this one on Starbuck island with skid  tracks and rest on the edge of the island Google earth Starbuck island.
Trying and Not giving up is the bestest lesson in life and we believe that you guys will show us another research too.. all the best guys and i believe aliens are real and they up above space and deeper inside the oceans....
It looks like the Millennium Falcon.
It is extremely sad that people would send death threats to these guys .
its def structure of some kind i believe its just so old it could a folized remains of a structure maybe possable if was mitallic and was open would filled with material over 1000s of years than the metal deteriated away leaveing a fossil of whatever it was never know im sure alot of the oldest history is in oceans that we will never know of and this could be a lucky fossil find of something that once was there
I THINK ITS THE TOP OF A STRUCTURE YOUR NOT SEEING ALL OF IF YOU LOOK ON BOTTOM LEFT OF THE EHANSED PICTURE BEFORE VID BEGINS YOU SEE WHAT LOOKS LIKE STAIR CASE WITH TO OVAL SCULPTURES OF SOMEKIND OVER THE DOOERWAY. I DONT BELIEVE ITS SPACE SHIP ITS A TALL STRUCTURE THAT WAS TALL ENOUGH NOT TO BE BURRIED ALL THE WAY YET
😂😂 Man y’all this real now especially after peru
I believe Dennis is correct, I see a crash site as well ! Go for it guys!
It really breaks my heart to see Dennis and Peter in this situation, but I do have faith and positive good fortune in this.  Do Not give up hope!!!!
Boy you are so right about having more questions about this thing,  than getting any answers.   That is so frustrating to say the least !!!
Do you know why that thing turns black when you touch it ?    That is very strange, and I wonder why it does that.
Are you guys going to be taking samples of the object?
Oh yes, that is what I find as being so weird, because it looks like it is cement.
So nobody took or made a note of the co-ordinates of that object, because if you have that, at least you can still get somewhere knowing where to go.
Looks like a meteorite? Hope they get to explore more and find out what it actually is.
conspiracy or intimate by usa
He said we would be attacked by beings from another world but I left u a tool buried that will help u destroy them in seconds
Looks like the millennium falcon.
I'm sorry how did they say they found this and what year
Sept 2023.. any follow ups? 57 minutes of click bait from the History Channel as usual.
Just some waste from a big oilrigg or ship. Next
looks like a rock
Great & Super Professional Team
it looks like a rock formation.
need a computer to analyze and complete from what it can gather from image a three dimensional photo and a smaller scale three dimensional mould to be able to begin understanding what it can be   the whole mountain ridge and floor into three dimension
could it not have a bottom part of it buried and only the top just the very small top not buried
Handsome men
This is just a classic x files cover up , just for covering some truth. I feel bad for mr dennis and his family. Hopefully there is a figure like fox mulder to give some insight
Looks like a now underwater city or worship temple to me...
Yep ....that's sure look like a crash site !  Your didn't look deep enough is all  !  But if you can't and wanted to know ? All your had to do is work with the Navy or government  organization or official to find out  ?
It is the hulk of the Russian imperial yatcht, 'Livadia', most likely lost while under tow on the way to being scrapped.
I am still waiting to know what the latest findings on this object, but, the reality is, even on Mars we have seen such elaborate object like rocks carved by time. but the difference is, there are many so close to each other when that is the case. But, in here, under Baltic Sea, this is the ONLY thing of its kind, and it is so isolated, which makes sense that it is a man-made or some other advanced species made item.
Big plug
Ancient Japan had spaceships made out of stones.
It is a Crash site.. we know this   but you need to continue so all can see . As far is the person that sent to you the msg. I wold like them to know we know who you are and you need to let the humans continue.  Do not bother them because we are Watching you . This is your Only warning...... 𒀭 𒁄 𒆠 𒁄 𒀭𒁀 𒆠 𒀭𒁀  𒂍𒃲𒌓𒁹𒂼 𒀀𒉪𒊏𒀀𒀭
Awesome find !
I Think this is an underground base  .e t   UFOs  aresaid to have underground bases , you have made an excellent discovery you may have found out the truth is there ,guys do not give up  well done
Just drill some holes in the center of it and see what comes up.
it isnr sunken , the sea level was 100 m lower 12000 years ago thats all
Its a big rock
Well, this Monday morning quarterback could have told you that it was stonework from the beginning. It's resemblance to a movie spaceship skewed peoples logic processes.
Why didn't everyone just say hey we weal give onother day or two òn me crowd fund this for two more days  come on guy's Jesus
This is a very common geological structure called intrusion or batholith which has been exposed due to the strong glacial erosion at the Bothnian Sea basin. We have even more spectacular intrusion formations near by, as the Åva ring complex in the Åland archipelago. In this "mystery object" magma rising up has accumulated to a cavity which has rectangular walls and elongated crevasses and these have operated as casts for the hardening magma. Also  formations resembling stairs are typical for such formations. (Quaternary geologist, remote sensing expert)
When you think of the billions of dollars wasted on arms etc and then the possibility of using a tiny fraction to finance a project like this it just leaves me astounded by human stupidity
Threats????    Ephesians 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places
Long live the Kings of X !!!!!!!
Peter and Dennis are warrior poets and we should honor men of character !!! It is the glory of God to hide a matter;  and the glory of Kings to search it out !!!!  Proverbs 25:2 We honor God for what he conceals; we honor kings for what they explain.
They were able to relocate the object on the second try to relocate it and they took samples it's just a mineral formation  Y'all need to quit posting
Save 57minutes if you want to get the answer, they cannot conclude anything what was found.
Millinium falcon.. I knew Star Wars was true!!              Democrats     everywhere
They have to continue that object was not under the sea many years ago
It is the millenium falcon  you duh!
C'mon guys, it's just a military flare, er, I mean, water balloon. Oh sorry, I meant a flare.......
Nope nope nope i dont see anything
It looks like the Millennium Falcon.
I hope they have the opportunity to find a definitive answer as to what the anomalies are and prove the sceptics wrong, which would clear thier names.
Putting everything on that could be nothing needs a big heart and they proved they have a big heart.
10 years later and still nothing  it's a shame for  humans scienctific explorations and discovery of artefacs or strange objects  and yes it'always about money!
In 1997 some Russian soldiers were blasted by a weapon from a ufo that made them very similar to limestone. This could be the result of that same weapon   Also Medusa turned many men to stone so it could all be related  Either this ship was hit by that weapon or it carried that weapon and it malfunctioned. That’s my theory which also explains why it looks “burnt” to some degree  Also for more background on the Russian soldiers, I believe it was 11 men and 7-9 were struck by this object after they struck it with a surface to air rocket. This flying object was acting in self defense according to the story released. There is more to the story but just look it up if you’re curious
Water breathing aliens prefer aquatic planets to hide in.  We have numerous of these people under the water.
Anyone else thinking this looks like the Millennium Falcon? lol
0:15 THESE GUYS DIDNT DISCOVER THIS ANOMALY... WHEN DID THIS LIE COME ABOUT????
I hope we gonna meet the answer soon , it will cost more money for that expedition,  needs more light there too
I don't believe that it's a crash site per say, but during the younger dryas period around MWP 1a and 1b, the sea level rose something like 120m. That rise would've put that anomaly above the sea level some 12000 years ago. Perhaps it was man made or perhaps sculpted by man to align with the split in the mountain. Interesting to think about at least.
leave it to faux fox  news to create a narrative of untruth, sorry Sweden, if you are smart do not let the fox faux News people into your country.  Can the researchers bring a case in the US or Sweden for defamation and other civil and criminal wrongdoing by fox faux new?  One would hope so.  To the team please do not give up the fight to find out what it is, and perhaps the academic world may assist with funding? I would hope so, looking forward to your further work on this very worthy project of identification of this object. Thank you for all you have done in the name of science.
why nooene is starting  kickstarters campaign to rise funds?
Thank u for this effort sharing this glimpse of what might be an intelligent ancient civilization. Kudos to all the crew, the production team and the financiers. I'd love to know the truth through the next sequel.
Millennium falcon
I bet Graham Hancock would love to give them some fundings.
Doesnt look like a UFO at all. Looks like its part of a much larger buried STRUCTURE. And yes, a DESIGNED, CREATED structure. Anyone who'd say 'That's just a natural formation' shouldn't be allowed to operate an automobile. People who lack judgement shouldnt be given access to half ton projectiles.
I'd like to know why deep dive pressurized suits weren't used, that wouldn't have narrowed the dive window on the object so severely. Neverheless, this made for a very exciting adventure, and an insight into the courage of the men involved in such extremely dangerous undertakings. Loved the doc, watching out for your next adventures. Thanks.
This is the thing about 'Climate Change.' Those touting 'Climate Change' don't have the slightest clue about 'Climate Change' Lol. That entire ocean was part of a super-Continent at one point. There is no TELLING what is buried beneath the ocean floor.
Its the Millennium Falcon!!!
UFO Is ODIN in 469 A.D He USE Wrong Kind of Rock It Fly for 10 Minutes Hit the Water and Sunk .He need Shungite Found in Norway & Russia He Build it 4 of Them and Left the EARTH In 473 A.D to Aldebaran he Found Caves of Atlantis In Norway  Found Plans How  Build Fly Ship 460 A.D. They Found Planet They Call Asgard
It's the millennium falcon obviously
Crashed anunaki craft once homed to sky port in egypt
experts already were able to do a high resolution 3D scan of the Tiatnic wreckage. They should do this next and reveal what's there once and for all.
I love the idea pf going down to explore bit then they pick up a stone or crust off the surface and don't drill deeper than the surface? Use a diving bell for extended dive times. I'm as frustrated as they are! I hope they get to explore this more.
Logically it could be a stone sculpture that once existed above ground Like that now sunken civilization of "DoggerLand!.  We are the 5th advanced civilization on Earth in the last 135,000 years!  GET REAL with your RESEARCH!!!!
With everything coming out in congressional meetings and throughly history about aliens, it very well could be a ancient part of a alien ship. Just started watching though, let’s see what happens
I think this expedition needs to have all the funding to find out what exactly it is 😊
You need underwater drill
Just remember that the object probably went through outerspace and entered earth's atmosphere
Keep up the investigation.
What does that say about fake news?
Millennium Falcon….
I don’t tend to credit unusual explanations for natural occurrences, but in that case, nothing seems quite normal.  So, in my most wild scenario, I’m thinking : what if a ship studying volcanic activity had to land in emergency and crash in a volcano?  After all, I suspect that a ship intended for space travel would withhold extreme temperature variations, and could well possibly be molded in lava, and then be deported by glaciers.  When I discuss with my pops, who is a firm materialistic mind, about the likelihood of the Earth being visited by aliens, he tells me about the almost impossibility of traveling at the speed of light, etc.  I keep reminding him that, as a species, humans are at best an infant; that 500 years ago - which is not even 10 human lives - we officially thought that the Earth was flat…
One hour of nonsense.
Just keep going my friends, I believe in what you believe!..🙌🙌🙌🙌😎😎🙌🙌...
All they would have had to do was create a YouTube channel early on. Maybe after a year or two they would have garnered enough subs to make their dreams a reality.
🌲🍀🐾🤔, this is almost certainly a "crash site", whether it be a meteor, military built secret craft, or some E.T.'s  atv👽.  It looks like it hit the underwater hump (mountain) carved through it, dragging debris to it's final resting place.  This crew set out find the "truth" in about as professional a way as they could, with the amount of time & resources that were at their disposal.  The negative comments should be laughed at.  The threats should be turned over to the proper authorities.  Hope you find the "truth"🏆😉🐾🍀🌲.
When i saw the video thumbnail, my first thought was The Millenium Falcon.
I think that's something special and considered secret by the powers that be. The fact that they are being cajoled and manipulated out of the expedition, including threats, point to the pattern of the underworld. Just my opinion .
Why not use a drone with G.P.R. ( Ground Penetrating Radar ) with/ as well as GPS to get the location before setting sail? It all seems counter intuitive.
BORING.  I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE ABLE FIND A. UAP.
POV: They can't find it out.
It's an ancient Stone- UFO. .
Op incredible Thanks for doing this  ❤️❤️❤️
45:40 Explanation of the sample rock brought up by the divers.
It’s the Ebon Hawk obviously
As humans, our brains make shapes out of things that aren’t necessarily anything significant. We do this all the time. It’s like saying there are pyramids on Mars when it’s just a roughly shaped stone surface structure.
ANOTHER BLURRY PHOTO🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is it just me or does that object look strangely like the millennium falcon?  Narrator: Could the Baltic Sea hold a portal to the fictional world of Star Wars? Could George Lucas be from this portal to tell this story? Could there be lightsabers hidden in the depths? Some researchers say, “maybe”
They gotta get that up and find out
That's a man made ship for sure.
These men are not scammers, dreAmers not scammers . God bless
some rocks and dirt
It is just a rock formation
for sure it's a North Stream distributor system station...🙄
That is the shape of hull of a concrete transport ship that carried concrete for the base for support's for building bridges, this most probably started to go off in the ship and the hull doors were opened and it was dumped, cheers, from Ireland
Have we up to date news on this subject
I wish I have the money to help them. I hope they will find enough to continue
When is the next sequel look forward to it I hope you get the funds you need x team
0:35 I can't be the only one to say it, but that initial sonar scan certainly looks like the Falcon doesn't it?
Keep up the research ,it is not a normal common object  ,many thanks
And…. Zero
Solo's Millennium Falcon
should have sent large lights down
A Jeff Bazos needs to get behind  this project $$$$$$
When I was scrolling quickly I thought the thumbnail was master chiefs helmet
It's a load of rocks....wake up!!!😂
Anyone else come here because they wondered if George knew the Millennium Falcon had crashed in the mud which then was covered up by  the ocean a million years ago and became rock?
Some Aliens have laser technology that enables them to turn vehicles & people into stone.The Russians have experience of this from a small Patrol that approached an Alien Craft, they went to investigate, but carrying weapons showed a hostile intention, so the aliens turned them into stone. This was on Y'Tube, and also stated that 2 of the patrol being quick witted & fearing the possibility, threw themselves down into a cleft in the earth & stayed put. When they ventured out the craft was gone & the other team members, much to their astonishment were turned into stone statues right where they stood. Other strange statutes have been found, thousands of years old, that are so intricate & detailed that scientific analysis cannot work out how they could possibly have been carved, such is the precision. From the above incident it could be they were not carved, but unfortunately encountered some of the same Aliens. Time scales do not matter. Putting the case that an aerial battle took place, (similar to the verified event over Nuremberg, reported in mid 1600's Germany) the current spaceship shaped lump of rock on the lake bed, could have quite simply met the same fate, and being transformed into an immense weight of rock/granite ? entered the waters dropping down in its trajectory & ploughing along the lake bed passing, smashing it's way through anything, as the sonar shows, leaving a subsequent  trail of destruction. Perfectly possible, from other existing evidence.
broken rock !
It looks like a platform of some kind with stairs 🤔
Fox News is an infotainment and most probably a fake news outlet, not much  the team should be worried about
Atleast you have went out and tried not just comment from a computer screen with negative thoughts, I hope you are blessed with the funds needed for future investigations
It answered a lot actually , It was defunded through defamation because they dont want it revealed . They know exactly what it is because they have seen it before.
It could be an artefact created at the end of the last ice age when glaciers retreated and rock at the base of an iceberg touched bottom creating the grooves in the sea floor the waters being much shallower then 10 to 12 thousand years ago.
Fox News is a propaganda tool that lies continuously.  They have hurt many people.  I am glad Domectic took them down and won the lawsuit for defamation.   Others are suing them.  They are monsters.
Since nobody has gone down to see it or chip off a sample, nobody knows. The article is just click bait.
Complimenti per il lavoro svolto, qualcuno sa ma non vuole che tutti sappiano la verità, se fosse un anomalia non ci sarebbe ragione per ulteriori accertamenti che sono stati fatti, vedete la NASA ha scoperto che molti meteoriti sono formati di carbonio che si e'formato a pressioni base pari allo zero e Hanna generato una sorta di "carbonio più duro del diamante, oggi li definiscono diamanti sintetici, ma sono dieci volte più duri e li generano a pressioni pari al vuoto assoluto, li usano per le punte di trivellazione" il vostro geologo quando le avete mostrato i campioni ha capito subito che cosa avevate in mano, una sostanza esotica, ora trovare chi vi finanzi per continuare le vostre ricerche e quasi impossibile, perché avete reso pubblico il tutto, ma io credo che una industria legata alle nuove tecnologie potrebbe aiutare la vostra ricerca che ovviamente non sarà mai resa pubblica ma almeno se non arriverete tardi e farete una presentazione impossibile vi potrebbe interessare. Credetemi avete fatto la storia, complimenti.
It's the Millennium Falcon!
It's a pile of rocks.
If only they'd set up a Go Fund Me at the start when the whole world wanted to know they'd have millions of Euros to work with..
its McDonalds , lol
Excellent documentary on the truth. I always wondered what happened to this object.
The sea floor! Yea!
Ask Elon Musk for funding
This is a very much up to date question. As yet have there been any offers of support to re visit this sight, not that as a 78 year old i have that sort of money, if i did you can bet your boots i would be there sponsering another dive. But i really wish that there was someone with an interest in solving this riddle for the benifit of those who risk their lives trying to answer the problem.
This i think is something that cries out to be revistered and looked at very closely. I am to say the least as angry as the guy running the dive, its not something anyone take on lightly, even more so when done on a mix. I would like to see one of these people who attempt to threaten the lives of others over something they have no clue as to what it is, i would say an experience of the company of a shark with atitude, intent on you being its next meal who kept us down on a shallow dive even after three or four times being shocked with what we call bang sticks, it was not untill it was bleeding itself dod it leave us alone. Divings not for thr faint of heart and requires a degree of interest in gaining knowledge, so i wish that these guys get another go at looking at this object with more equipment to find out just what it is, as it sure is beyond me as to what it can be.
Sediment compressed over millennia would appear to be rock surely. Yes! This IS a crash site. Fund the poor guy Elon. 😢
This is a whole lot of drama!!  There was an anomaly found they investigated it, they retrieved the sample and proved that it's just a magma plume,,  The rest is nothing but drama
It's just a rock, not more not less😂 And an UFO? It wasn't flying 🤠
good find ... love the documentaries
Dead giant
I think he's guys are onto something it might be what they think you got to look at that their it's something that a lot of I agree with the guys it might be something might be something from not of this keep up the good don't let people get you keep doing what you're doing
I fast forwarder through this and that shortened my wasted time.
Geology! latterly and horizontal spreading, between sea floor and strata lines?
BTW there are more of these same exact shape anomalies located around the world. Another in the Black Sea and another I know of located off some islands close to Antarctica. Their identical shapes are what makes this fascinating
I hear it once made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs
I Wonder could it be some kind of Toxic / Nuclear  Waste Encased in some Special Kind of  Harder Concrete to Last for Longer in its Icy Tomb ?
That Chap Floris should be Flying Drones in Ukraine ,  Slava Ukraine !
This story has really tickled my curiosity.  It seems a long time since this pioneering work without any useful assistance from anyone. This begs one question - have the negative responses and threats made potential sponsors scared?   There have been a number of explorations of much more easily explained deep sea objects - the search for Amelia Earhart's aircraft springs to mind as does the recent and tragic attempt to visit the Titanic. Compared with these, 90 metres is just a shallow bit of water. Modern submersibles can now do detailed observations and collect samples that the divers simply did not have enough time  to complete while at the object.
Great presentation of a fascinating discovery and exploration to try and find out what it really is. I really hope further work follows.
When I saw the first few images in this documentary, I was sure it was the Millennium Falcon.  But how did it find its way to our galaxy? Every body knows Stars Wars happened a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away. Maybe it wasn't that far away after all?? EDIT: hahahahaha I made the original comment like 5 minutes in. Now at the 47 minute the Millennium Falcon is mentioned  in the video :)    As a sidenote:  If it is the Millennium Falcon then it is not an UFO because then it will be identified as former Hans Solo's ship.
This show didn't prove anything, just a lot of build up just to say it could be man made.
Have you ever thought that some one dose not won't you to find what is really down there because if what is happening to you now is just for you then it's not it's to stop anyone from going ahead just it might not be so easy buy than to stop the unstoppable I'm sure that they will stop at nothing to make this disappear for good befor they can get it and not for the same reasons you have I would never ask you to put you and your family in so many dangerous as this will do
Aug. 28,2023. Has James Cameron seen this and any comments from him? Will he dive into this?
I hope they get the cash
wow who would have thought this would get comments from dullards, bombs and such idiocy. prob flat earthers
Maybe a gun turret????
Interesting
I believe you Peter and Dennis
👽💯
Thats exactly what it is .....A CRASH SIGHT. My question is where did these threats come from?? I wonder.. and WHY?? Under that rock or crust from heat is metal of some kind. It is obvious.
Millennium Falcon
Its the Crusader MSR Starrunner. ...
MI”ll save you all 58 minutes.  Look at the object carefully…it’s The millenium Falcon!  Case close :-)
I hope you guys find something great
Working/researching at sea is difficult and expensive.  They needed to do a grid of seismic sub-bottom profiling. Then they could get a 3-D image of the object and its surrounds. That is cheaper and easier than drilling into the object. If those results are fruitful, then they could plan a drill. We marine geologists always do 3-D images before drilling.
Media......enemy of the people...puppets of government
What puzzles me is what stake people have  about the object. Why does it matter to them that some people would like to answer the question? Some have gone to the extent of issuing veiled threats. Would this object be the result of some criminal act that people don’t want revealed?  Maybe in the future, will have some technology that will allow us to find out more about what this thing is. However, we should realize that even if this happens, they will still be many more questions yet to be resolved.  Science is a search for knowledge with the expectation that the search will never end.
Its so sad to see all the hate these people got! They are just trying to explore and further knowledge of humanity. Its none of our business anyway were lucky they told us about it.
After watching, I'd like to add my 2¢ worth. Let's go back 10k yrs, either during or just after the last ice age. The seas were lower, even if covered by snow and/or ice. If an object "came in hot" at 1,000's of MPH, and skidded for several 1000 ft, it might look like that, to me. Keep up the good work
It’s a Predator space ship.
Obviously if this thing is real then the ones at the top will be all over it. And they can make it disappear too!
Nooo! So what exactly is the outcome?!
Whatever the thing is, it would be helpful to know. Be it natural or not 💯👏🏻
The fact that they need to use a helium mixture to go that deep...and then hearing their voices like that, I can't unhear it. It's too funny 😂😂
point 1 : if it was separated by a glacier, is it possible to be separated and blown aside by water? or is it the vibrations that carry it there? maybe here can be explored further,  Point 2: if it's a split that occurred due to a collision with the support of blowing data like in the video, this is really worth looking into at the scene of the incident. imagine whether it's a meteorite or a ufo, how many years has it been there? the rocks would obviously cover him, or camouflage under the rocks. so it needed to look further with the bright conditions down there.  But is this project still going on?
I thought, its the bloody Millennium falcon! 😅
It's an alien ship disguised with a thick layer of volcanic rock which also acts as a heat shield on reentry. You're welcome.
I would agree that the images indicate that this object seems to be an ancient crash site. You are all professional men and I was appalled by the nasty threats and spineless texts that you have received. I believe in what you are doing. It could wind up being the most significant UFO site ever discovered. It is absolutely clear that it is an engineering type not from this world. Obviously Aliens have been visiting our planet on survey and topographical missions for millennium and this one simple struck a mountain deep below the surface which would explain the two long ridges on either side of the object, as if a major section of the craft was broken off at enormous speed and thrust forward to create the second ridge. I only wish that It were possible for me to join such an exciting project, but as a 90%paraplegic living on a lousy low income. I am out of luck. I wish you and the whole team well and hope that future excavations will completely prove your theories as I truly believe and that you are vindicated. The object has many features that can be explained by imagining future or alien forms of technology and flight capabilities we yet do not have. The best of luck to you all 👍👍👍😁
I think it’s a crash site,too!
Did I hear right? It's 300 feet down? During the last ice age our sea level was down by about 400 feet(I may be off a bit) it could be something that was land born and then submerged by the melting glaciers...It can be something as simple as a round house.,...the foundation at least....at least something completely man made many years ago.
It's millennium falcon, so totally a real  ufo 😂
its an alien spacecraft that crashed  into the sea millions of years ago
Why do cowards have to get involved in everything that is found.
These brave and amazing devoted professionals are doing an amazing and dangerous investigation.  I know "remote viewers"  exist and by doing the search with one, could be a possible way to solve this mistery. 😮😊
If it was an actual spaceship, the US government would have taken it away immediately to Wright Patterson AFB. Or to their facilities in Antarctica.
Why u think its sunken... its probably built out there when the water wasnt there..
Old Navy is loving this adventure...,  I have been all over the Mediterranean, 3 summers in a row / US Navy.  WE lost a flying saucer in that same general area.  Stop thinking you'll just keep this US Navy flying Saucer.... stop it right now !    I just finished reading the book,  " The Last Templar ".    This video gets a 5 star rating.   You have to go back and do  a core sample perhaps sonic study to see if it is solid.    That  3 D   imagery at the end of this video, screams... " there are answers to be gotten after ".   Go get them ?  Good Luck for a great discovery...
You are fools ! You think the US satalites haven''t locatated where your ship was and your treasure ! Next time you go look at it , it won't be there ! The US government will have taken it away !
There's a perfectly good Space ship down there and nobody's doing anything about it ! There's enought people n the world that would support a crowd fund to get that thing up so we can change the world !! Tie some air bags to it a pump them up ! It's worth Trillions  ! The anti gravity engines are worth Billions !
It’s the millennium Falcon obviously
Very interesting. That’s all I shall say. It’s not all I would like to say though.
So beautiful in the future you will see something wonderful will come up ❤
It is a rock
What you found is so significant that you should consider the negative response as legitimate, credible and little coincidence of how things appear.
You need to ask for support from someone else who likes to know of the unknown & find the truth of what it is. Someone that easily can fund this project & finely  get answers & the truth,  Elon Musk. Just ask a No from him won’t kill you.
It is known that some UFOs are made of meteorites composition which resembles lava on the planet on the planet it could be meteor in nature after all what better material to build a UFO from the meteor right material that knows how to last in space and we know this to be true because they have found evidence of it. Do not listen to these people threatening you it’s the government they just don’t want people to know about. Not listen to these people threatening you it's the government they just don't want people to know about call visitors
The intimidating messages are coming from the government to pay no attention to them. They’re still trying to cover up the Sinopoli we call UFO. Government to pay no attention to them they're still trying to cover up the Sinopoli we call UFO fox News lies
Fox news is known to be the the biggest liars in the United States in the United States they're fake liars biggest don’t that Fox News get in your way don’t that Fox News get in your way you saw how they lied for Trump you saw how they lied for Trump the liars they're paid by the government
India is crying behind their money. Which is useless.
I'm sorry I forgot to end my sins but has anybody ever discussed about bringing what it is up to the surface
As anyone discussed trying to bring whatever it is
Looks like a Millennium Falcon
But it does show the awful attitude of the media industry. I am furious that someone is threatening his family personally and that is not right. Think what you like but please stop pulling his family into this if you have to fight fight him not his family
It’s gaslighting but in film form 😮😢😅🤔😕🤔😡
Thanks for the warning that there are no answers. As you say, a waste of time
To all those who are calling this documentary a waste of time as it reaches no conclusion. how do you suppose they can reach the conclusion that they themselves don't have the tools to prove would you like them to just lie about it . But that does not mean that they are a waste of time because had every historian or archaeologist in history who discovered something major thought like you none of them would have even made an effort to find it And also there are millions of people who are inspired by such documentaries as it rouses their curiosity  to try and find out answers to a question that has not been answered since millennia resulting in more and more people  devoting their time to research and look for answers..Nobody believed in Troy till it was discovered before that every historical record or book about it had no conclusion in them regarding its location but still  the precious info they contained in them inspired future archaeologists to seek answers  to a question which majority of the people just like you thought could never be done. The next time you guys even  think of watching a documentary just to find answers for your every question what i suggest is go to wikipedia and type the name of the topic this documentary is based upon and you will find all the answers you seek and will have zero chance of wasting your time as you accuse this documentary of doing . I mean it is that easy and  fyi nobody is forcing you to watch it anyway. In concliusion just take a look at the comments section of this documentary and you will find that their are hundreds of people who unlike you love this documentary and find it really inspiring and are commending the makers for trying to uncover the secrets despite all the obstacles they have faced. Its the undeniable proof  that majority of the viewers dont find it boring. Stop making sweeping statements about what other people are thinking you are not a psychic
raise it?
Sad, it probably the find of the millennia and people discouraging from continuing.
Burnt ufo from entering the atmosphere.  Probably not
It’s the Millenium Falcon.
candace marie hughes home on mails mail on on galaxy london space card. show all on. paid transactions. receipt. on on on. on.
interesting how it resembles the "crafts" swarming the STS tether incident long ago
To enter a ufo there are 2 ways to get inside 1 u get sucked up into it by air 2 you walk into one up a plank.
A stone carving of what people had seen close to what star wars vessle looked like meannig " this is what will come into existence in the years of our childerns childerns childetn long past what we know now but u and i will ne gone and that which we see now may one day come agaim but not now,like us our childern will know what it real means"
Clearly, it’s a ship of the “Millennium Falcon” class. 😐
Megatron's headquarters season 1 Transformers
Does anyone know of any progress on this?
Most marine geologists now agree that the anomalous object is most likely a natural rock formation, called a drumlin which is formed by glacial action which was common in that area of the Baltic Sea during the ice age.
2023 - NOW MAYBE WE CAN REEXAMINE THIS AND ALL POSSIBLE UFO  CRASHES/SIGHTINGS THROUGH AN ANSWER DRIVER LENS
Brilliant Doco!
Ok je n avais pas regarder la fin du doccumentaire .il me convient .on voit tellement de mauvais doccumentaires. Desole..! Toutes mes excuses .
Vous trouvez quelque chose .OK. vous le montrer.ok.apres vous en discutez. Le comment et qui on s en fout !!!!!!!!! DECOUVERTE et discussions SUR DECOUVERTE OK LE RESTE ON S EN FOUT !!!!! Ou alors très court dans le documentaire .MAIS COMME EN GENERAL ILS N ONT RIEN TROUVE IL LEUR RESTE LE BLA BLA BLA....POUR RENTABILISER FINANCIEREMENT LEUR ECHEC !!! TOUJOURS CE PROBLEME DE FRIC !!!!! VOILA LA VERITE !!!!!
I am going to run an idea past who ever found it    To travel through space you need protection from the.     Cold. Radiation heat collision and deep sea when you get hear    I think that there is a possible space craft in side and the stone is a protective shell and what better then stone to protect you  fro all these elements????
they do not know how right they are!!!!!   hahahahahaha!!!! how right they are!! don"t look at the circle look to it's side under the silt......
It’s a space ship that went up in flame and scrashed  in to the see
E se gli alieni usassero la pietra in un altro modo è quella è una nave stellare?
If it's a spaceship or advance technologies this video wouldn't be put up here.even if it is they would never show it to the public. They are just playing around making the public itchy with curiosity.
Just have to ask. Do Computer Narrators always pronounce U.F.O. as You-Foe? LOL
Looks like something Dr. Wiley would use in the Mega Man games.
Thats where George Lucus dumped his props after filmimg Star Wars! He did it as a prank!
It looks like the Millimum Falcon!
Bless them 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Turned out to be a natural formation, not a ufo..
That was so much fun!  Great documentary. Needs more investigation. You all should be so proud of efforts.
Suppose, if this site is a crash site of extra terrestrial vehicle than that crash happened much before the ocean/sea exists on earth, cause water will break that kind of force that can break the mountain.
How horrible it must have been for him and his family to have received threats like that. There's some sick people out there.
always interesting videos
It's raining outside, man this is just amazing.
Without this dedicated brave people, we would be lost... Congrats to all and each one!💕🍀🏆
When the expert needs another, more expert, expert.. you know they're onto something
Funny because looks like Millenium Falcon…
Star wars UFOs sind schon uns super nicht nur in flim  sie sind wirklich da es gibt sie 😁✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️👍😄😄😄😄🛸🛸🛸👽
Werden wir den Kontakt mit Außerirdische kommen   sonst weren sie ja nicht da unbekannte Flugobjekte zu sehen immer wieder kommen die Meldung von  unbekannte Flugobjekte ist ein Anfang der große Tag wird kommen  mit 110%  ich glaube daran ihr auch .
Star wars UFOs sind im Vorlauf einfach super  bald kommen sie zu uns zum Besuch  das wäre super  die Begegnung der dritten Art jetzt geht's  los  ✌️👍🛸👽😎😎
Hello Elon Musk, please say you’ll finance their investigations. A couple of trips there cost peanuts to you 😁。 Do good do together .
Its a dock
It almost looks like the Millennial Falcon from Star Wars!!!
Rock formation they are found the world over fgs
It’s the millennium falcon hahaha
After watching this documentary and comparing it to the TicTac incident off Catalina Island, I cannot help but wonder if these UAPs are linked to this anomaly. There are so many new and exciting mysteries developing right before our eyes. The next ten years will be the most remarkable and amazing times of mankind.
It's the Millennium Falcon
See what fox propaganda network does to peoples hopes and dreams of discovery. FOX Propaganda network is an atrocity to our world.
The whole is convinced it is fake but there is no proof I think that is odd. These two guys and the driver are converse it should have a closer look.
See what they doing to you guys, they know it is real but the news outlets and the media are trying to convince the guys found it is fake but in reality it is 100% it is real.
I hope you know that Fox news put out fake news. Tell me why are you both believing in this news outlet.
Beton!?
Wow.  Fox got involved in defaming the object?  Whatever that is, someone doesn't want you to reexamine it.  It must be a vimana.
There is evidence that human life has been here before Adam and Eve perhaps this planet has been wiped clean of humans and life numerous times and that object is left over from a human creation 3 creations previously from this period. Maybe 350,000 years ago.
Nobody knows what is under the crust of that object only speculation
Wow what a great mystery on what it actually could  be... But with today's technology of sonar, it should be easy to get great images. This was fron 2013. It is now 20 years later... Let's hope newer technologies get there soon
It's a planet bomb.💥
Nani’s lost ship in Annunakii
yes stupid race of human being cant believe or think beyond steel, aluminum, plastic and fiber...superior race always build things with compositions lookalike of rocks
its a millenium falcon obviously.
Sick people that are hassling these brave men, they have no idea what they have been through, great work, history.weve seen on film , UFOS go under water recently.
I see so many people with good ideas on this topic, plus some with sarcasm. My thought is has that part of the Baltic Sea ever been above water? If so, It could have been a monument to symbolize 1st contact of our ancestors after the real ship crashed on our planet...Just an idea.
Looks like Millennium Falcon
It was a massive tree stump from when sea level were lower and probably used by humans
Ow is it so expensive for a boat and crew to wait until the weather gets better. There only running the generator and drinking an eating. They own the stuff they are using. Not hire buy the hour
The Millennium Falcon
The world is full of skeptics my friend. But we still. Need to be open-minded. The news spreads lies and especially. When you're gonna get close to uncoverings. Something they don't want you to know. The possibilities could be endless. What the masses want is coperhaps lack of informatit should. And Censorship The fact of the word. UFO was ever brought up You're a crazy person. That wears a tin hat Finally, the world is open to other points of view now and I truly hope and bless that you all find sponsors for your work and uncover this and Don't let Anyone take this from me. Not the threats that wanna censor us, not backlash a clash of.  A discovery that could reveal itself. And I hope you guys are the ones that do. This could be the best disclosure we could ever get. That wouldn't be hidden from us. I wish best of luck's. And hope for success for you
It's interesting that such an international uproar against this exploration took place. If it's really nothing, why all the negative responses. That makes a person wonder why would anyone go to so much trouble to put a negative smoke screen on this. Feels like an effort to keep the identification of the object hidden by someone, agencies or governments in a position to influence the outcome.
Try to dig below the rock you will find the metal parts of the spacecraft
Same this rock to tuwatawa flying in our system.. Alien use this as space craft cover up the spaceship and hide the spacecraft into the rock
Looks like they were fans of star wars when they made this one up 😂😂
Excellent
It looks like the millennium Falcon.
If there is volcanic rock ,wouldn't the anomalies have melted the bed rock when it came into contact after coming through our atmosphere?
Great and honest, cutting-edge research.  Thank you for sharing this.  Keep at it!
a UFO LOL ITS VOLCANIC ROCK. SO STOP SMOKING THE CARTELS ROCK HEY????😂😂
"yoo-fooh"
So it is an erratic, fascinating! I live in Alberta Canada and we have one outside our city. It's called the Okotoks Erratic, and it's amazing, and when you consider where it came from and it's size, you can see how this one got deposited. Thanks guys!
the Millennium Falcon
its just a weird rock that a Glazier dragged along and nothing else
An object no one could identify??? Millions of voices...the millenium falcon lol
Well today it is forbid to dive there and the old team is under pressure! So there are 'official powers' who keeps our history in darkness... Well didn't they want to know us that or origins are not from this globe WE already know??? Well there is the theory that intelligence 'live' moved over from mars at the planet dies so why not find reamains of the transporters they used?
This object is a concrete U boat trap. There's literally dozens of these around the Baltic sea from WW2, most of them uncharted.
It's the Millenium Falcon. It's all true. May the force be with you.
ooh noo a storm.  ooh no a navy ship.. ooh no not our sonar..  fake drama,  lot of child like enthusiasm over rocks.  probably fake actors. they don't look much professional.
I can easily tell you what it is.  rocks
In 1865 Modesto cubilla discovered the caves in Alticante Spain where it showed that ancient humans lived their way before science and the church claimed. He argued that the cave drawing proved humans where there 35,000 years ago but everybody doubted him and even ridiculed him, it took decades for his Discovery to be proven correct.
Maybe an AI robot can dive into it. There’s a better chances it could last longer on deep ocean without needing helium and oxygen. Get more samples and take more pictures. Since this generation is making AI bots. Might as well test its capability😅js.
Thanks so much, Faux News!
documentarys that just ask you questions for an hour lol
It's definitely not a UFO I don't know of any spaceships made from concrete lol
Hey more questions ?? Just what  We need
Couldn't it be the remnants of a very old meteorite?...
These men put their lives on the line and their ideas are ridiculed and families threatened? What sort of a world do we live in? I salute them without visionary people like this we would still be in the dark ages!
So much money spent to create "tourist" dives to the Titanic site (we know what that is and how it happened), yet no one wants to fund these men to investigate an unknown on our own planet. I just don't get it and I wish I had money to aid them. If this were a dry land site, archeologists would be checking it out, but because it is underwater it seems easier for people to call it a hoax.
That's where Han parked the Millennium Falcon
“Party Pooper” sounds great in a Swedish accent.
Governments want this kind of stuff covered up and will pay media & internet influencers to say it’s all a lie.
Imagine a ship crashing on ice millions of years ago, ice melts and oceans form and said object is covered by dirt, sand for millennia’s.
4:47 bruh if u rent something n it’s damaged go tell the owner to fix it like who tf rents out a boat that’s leaking
Someone tried to sabotage them, by telling the people it's just rock formation,
P.T. Barnum was right.
Giant horseshoe crab fossil. 😅
It's the Ebon Hawk from Star Wars Kinghts of the Old Republic.
Coś zaryło o dno rozrzuciło ziemię na boki a wy nam mówicie że to wulkan ława 😅 jaja se robicie 😅
It could possibly be an alien craft that crashed millions of years ago, explaining why the outer crust is made of volcanic rock. I wouldn't be surprised if the smear campaign was orchestrated by US military to keep anyone from further exploring it.
Think concrete boat.
Why don't they send submarines down?
It crashed out melting rock  to it look at the trail it made
PLATE TECTONICS.....FROM AN. OLD CIVILIZATION
Looks like the Millenium Falcon to me.
It's not a "sunken" object. It's a relic from the past that was inundated by the rising seas following the last glaciation. But, there's always the tried and true "the aliens did it" hypothesis. Does make for an interesting video though.
They need another sponsor and another dive .. they have the coordinates now, so as long as they don’t lose another bot they should be good lol
They have answers but can't tell the public for some classified or  national security BS.
No alien ufo.  Ancient structure
Ancient structure
If it was something else theywould have said something  but they haven’t
Ancient structure
Look like millenium falcon
It's an ancient place, anunaki city lost 400,000 years ago.
Its the millennium falcon!
How much does it cost to take a team of divers on a boat? Go and dive it again
5:39 you mean USO? unidentified sunk object?
Ahhh.. .. .. . . ....  that's where it went to :)
So, what is it?  It was a great documentary, but darn, not being able to even get a sample of the structure after all of that money and effort is a huge disappointment for us as well lol
Its the millennium falcon
What tools are needed to excavate this? Are there such things as underwater jackhammers?
an object noone could identify.. millennium falcon yo!
if there is a way to bring it up . i think if there where 4 barges you could bring it up .
it could be 1 of 4 things one the wheel of a catapult or a sub that sank tail first  it could also be the wall ribbing of a old ship or a wooden wheel for war .
$20k/day?  Come on Elon, do something good with your money & sponsor them a couple of $million.
outstanding show!!!! I followed this from the beginning, and all I can see is crash site. Now, ignorance will tell you what they tell you, because brains of those people work different ways. It is beyond me why and how no one is pushing this subject on higher levels. Maybe the answer is simple, they do not know, so they leave it alone not to be embarrassed. Keep rolling guys, I would help if I could, but as of now you have my prayers and wishes, from hearth, that you prove everyone wrong. God speed!!!!!
It's the _Millennium Falcon!_
lol. I lose faith in human intelligence daily. Without watching this fully, or knowing anything about it, I instantly thought that the image looked like stone from a vulcanic plug or something similar. What do these guys and the media leap to? ALIENS!
It’s the foundation to an ancient skyscraper in a large city destroyed by the asteroid impact 17k years ago that brought on the last ice age..
I am only 1minute 30 seconds in but I can tell you that thats the millennium Falcon
Noyce
Can somebody tell me why they dont visit it ? Or do they need to call James Cameron ?😂
Let me save you guys an hour. It's a rock formation😂
I see the same thing spoken of looking at this footage.
Crash site 🇸🇬🙈
Its too dark to know what it is, even though they claim to know what it is. Its just chatter back and forth about nothing.
Perhaps it's the missing nuclear warhead that has been reported on ?
Muito bom ❤
I feel so bad for these men. I think the ridicule and threats have been orchestrated by shadow group who actually are the real power in the world. This makes me think that there has to be a reason they don't want this to be explored and exposed. I wish them much luck and im sure that being blocked from finding the answer to this must be absolutely maddening.
Ha. I knew it. Its a lava flow. The earth is huge and the ocean buries many mysteries and the earth is also OLD. Much older than us. Its entirely within the realm of possibility that there is just one little spot in the whole baltic where the depths of the earths molten core and volcanic activity poked through the surface for just a moment in time. Its like finding anything that seems out of place. There are anomalies.
The pre-flood Earth had a canopy of water in the atmosphere.  When meteors hit that canopy the water caused flooding all over the planet causing many structures to appear submerged when in fact they were actually above the water in ancient times.
If your attacked by the lamestream tools like this you know they being attacked are on to something.
It looks completely natural to me. Weird shaped rocks. Maybe carved and deposited by a gletsjer, maybe a basalt lava deposit, hence the crystal structure. How deep was the sea level during the ice ages? Imagination can play silly tricks. It is never extra terrestrial.
Please continue to try to get back and solve this mystery once in for all I believe it is a crash site and I pray for your success and may you all be able to get the honors you so much deserve for even sharing this story with all of us keep going keep going!!!!
This is like 20 years ago and still no good info
Do a kick starter. I will chip in for sure.
Unidentified: Yes Flying: No Object: Yes
Nonsense. They would have used GPS to pinpoint where the object was to begin with so could have easily just navigated to it.
I can't get over the "Viewscreen" sound from Star Trek @ 4:33 lol...excellent documentary, but taht really stood out to me.
It’s the Melenium Falcon 😮
Thank you to the men who took the time to investigate the anomaly and especially the divers who risked their lives on that dive in pursuit of answers. I wish we could have got more answers but I understand it cost a lot of money.
Couldn't it just be a big rock? As humans our brains look for familiar things to identify with. That's why we see shapes in clouds
It's the millennium falcon, duh.
Is it not worth it to find out? The fact that Fox News would publish something without ever talking to the guys that went down to look at it is mind blowing.  But that's Western Media for you. It's all garbage.
wow millennium falcon upside down
I think it was carved by sea giant termite
It's sad to see so many star wars fans so clearly wrong misidentifying the Ebon Hawk for the Millennium Falcon. Darth Revan has officially started his takeover of the earth and chose to take a Manaan approach. Perhaps he will use Red Tide to conquer the Oceans before taking on the the Land Armies
This was shown a few years ago there is also one in Bermuda Triangle
ewww fox news trying to cover it up
It’s definitely the millennium falcon
Shills
It is very odd. It needs more investigation. It’s not natural.
total ally fake danger.....im a diver.
Was there ever any updates on this.?
I'm surprised that they didn't think once that the "cement" layer could have been formed from sedimentary deposits over several millenia. To me this looks far from a natural occurrence as nature doesn't create such angles. Nature flows, and often repeats, but it is quite rare for it to create right angles. Hopefully they receive funding to hire a team of saturation divers and do some extensive research.  Maybe Richard Branson and Elon Musk should team up to fund this endeavor.
They found the Millenium Falcon! 😀
It’s chewy 😢
Haven't seen anything on this in a while. I talked to one of these guys on Facebook about this. I do believe that is a UFO weather or water will not make perfect looking steps and everything else you see on this craft as well as the build up of the floor of that lake as skid mark
So has anyone tested the thing yet
People are psychotic. They’re trying to uncover a great finding and there mistake was they trusted the news  to report the truth.
👍
I’m, the F in UFO means FLYING. Der.
Glad u asked. It’s sunken and mysterious. That’s what it is. Duh.
If there were no dreamers like these, no adventurers like these, we'd all still be living in caves. ALL great explorers and inventors, ALL great scientists of the past were met with the same derision you idiots are exemplifying.
What about the new technology where they drain the oceans ?
I dont like this style of documentaries. They rely on excitement rather than information. Not truly worth for a Timeline content.  And I wonder, why this issue is still unsolved. Or at least presented as unsolved...
Looks like the millennium falcon from star wars.
thats no rock. we need more answers this is not natural.
It's like an underwater version of that Noahs Ark anomaly documentary that also ruined the guy investigating it. He lost his business and all.
that's clearly master cheifs helmet
Yet another oak island.
This thing reminds me if the Yonaguni monument. Some ice age rock quarry or settlement of some type.
That is the eroded top of an ancient lava plug. Much harder than surrounding geology which had over millions and millions of years been eroded by natural geological action leaving just the top of lava plug exposed. Just too much "intrigue" so as to make a TV documentary.  Ridiculous  Regards from South Africa
It’s the Millenial falcon after it looked at Medusa. 😂😂
I would’ve taken a rock sample near by, also from the ufo looking object. To see if it’s the same. That’s if there’s any rocks sticking out of the seabed. If it is, there’s your answer.
Your up against the machine deep state, good luck.  Can't you get a sample of  it
Fox News sucks! Simple fact
Los like the top of a bunker.
Very good Documentary & thanks for sharing
It is a wide known fact circle don’t occur naturally in nature
Somebody call Han Solo, and tell him we found it.
Keyboard warrior's are the best because they themselves are true loser's and have to project their ineptitude at life at others but yet themselves can't seem to find a way out of their parents basement! I truly like animals more than humans most of the time.
Amazing work from this group of professionals - I hope they can succeed in finding out exactly what this anomaly is one day ❤
When they first show a picture of the shape, why do I see the millennium falcon🧐
i swear that pic that is shown looks like the millenium falcom when you see the thumbnail.
Looks similar too the object that can be seen on google earth. Location Starbuck island
If an object fell from a high altitude, whether natural, man made or alien, if it dove into bedrock it may have heated it up and it cooled suddenly, hence the small crystals. That would explain the unusual black rock there and it may very well be something interesting. Too bad so many jumped to the conclusion that it is nothing.
The freezing point of fresh water is 0C. This is seawater. Seawater has a freezing point of -1.8C, so it's not unrealistic for the water around the anomaly to be below 0C. The pressure will also cause some freezing point depression.
what proof is there that the thing they found the second time was the same object and not just a plant left by people who retrieved it so as to throw them off.   national security isn't going to allow civilians  to find and retrieve alien tech.
Is it not the millennium falcon?
It has been proven that this object is just a rock moved by water flows after the last glaciation age, not a UFO !
How old is this doc?
OMG! This is a Dralthi class fighter....
Looks like somebody else went down there and did investigation on it already. Possibly military
That doesn’t even look like an under water mountain and crash site.. It looks like an ancient pyramid with stairs and path way to a structural complex…It could be Atlantis…We have giant pyramids in egypt that no one knows how they were built it’s possible there’s more structures like egypt at the bottom of the ocean..It could be an ancient civilization that pre dated anything we could wrap our minds around.. It would also prove there was a great flood that covered earth and story’s from the bible are true.. If noahs story is true then there’d be citys at the bottom of the ocean..I can’t believe people think it’s crazy to think there could be citys and structures at the bottom of the ocean given what we’ve found on the surface..
Im pretty sure they've taken a sample of the thing and did a material scan...or that test that determines a date.
>-1°C >it's below freezing >which is quite suprising These guys are scientists? Water salinity and water pressure lowers the freezing point...
THATS JUST THE TOP OF ALIEN'S GIANT TOWER... DIG IT!!!!
pretty weak.... they just made full 3D model of the sunken Titanic with cm accuracy & these n00bs here, cant even get a good picture of a giant object?! 🤫 my guess is on natural formation...nature does some crazy stuff after all! , but sure it would be awesome if it is a crashsite ofcourse!
they dont want us to know the truth. They come from the lands beyond ours!
Yes its truly a government cover up warship just bobs up out of nowhere and then the negative towards the anomaly that show me fellas you have struck gold for real you found something governments doesn’t want the public to know or see plz don’t give up that’s what they want and expect you to do so don’t STAND TALL AND FIRM YOU WILL SUCCEED AMEN
Some space ships are made of stone to last forever
This project needs to be supported in a BIG way.
Great entertainment  but no answers just more questions. It's good for a payday for this team and crew nit much else.😮
Do aliens build spacecraft out of rocks?
It's clearly the falcon
Telescope
The fact that some have taken to outright abuse is sickening, There is something at the bottom of the ocean that beggers our knowledge, when someone who has spent their life looking at rock comes up with the thoughts that this is a covering of something underneath, then its got to be worth further investigation regardless of what it is. Those who take to trying theirvbest to make fools out of people who actually risk their lives by diving on such items, really need locking up its really sick and totally unhelpful, and most of all totally un constructive. I have seen pictures of tbis quiet a few times now, and i fully admit that its a structure i have never seen anything like before, so much so that were i still able to do saturated dives, i would be waiting to take a place as part ofba team to descover just what it is, i havevseen some strange things at the bottom of the sea in my time but this is a real brain teaser. I wish you andvyour team the very best of luck and can only say that if i had the funds i would be making sure that it was something that we learnt from rather than leave the questions unanswered, thevquestions arevtoo big!!
I looks like a crash landing .
Star wars wasn't just george lucas thoughts is my interpretation....shhhh e.t. told me.
Millennium Falcon
Clearly its a YT-1300 light freighter
Stupid things...
Almost seems as if certain people don't want this item exposed.
THAT IS ATLANTIS ACTUALLY  JK WHO KNOWS BUT I THINKS ITS A PRE FLOD STRUCTURE YOU KNOW THE BILICAL ONE MAYBE TOWER OF BABEL?
Its Falcon millenium
It's a hair dryer.
Millennium Falcon
this is a hindu temple top base magnetic energy
A rock😂
Did this man really just pronounce U.F.O as "yoofo"
Ancident UFO?
Honestly I think it’s something that a government put down their. Exactly what is unknown. However the threats and misinformation by media all point to it being man made. I’m guessing however but it’s shape and heated rock point to a nuclear possibility potentially a cap on something nuclear very similar to the ones our government put on the bikini islands during tests and they also blocked radiation from getting out. That or it’s listening devices under a cement cap either way whatever it is some government doesn’t want it found. As for the natural geological nature I’m guessing mind you but it seems like whatever it is was built in the natural geology of the rocks. So again it points to a government made object of unknown nature something that whatever government put it there wants to keep it secret. It would also explain the naval vessel shadowing the exploration vessel.
you should ask elon musk for funding billion of dollars is being lost everytime a spacecraft of spacex company just vanished when  exploded in the sky.
Well that was a waste of time to watch.
"They found what can only be described as the wreckage of a spaceship" 🤣
It's awful the way some people have acted towards the Ocean X Team. The kind of people willing to threaten children, or even allude to it, are ultimately insecure about their own belief system for this to rattle them so much. Their anger is misplaced, and their threats are despicable. The Ocean X Team are only putting forward the most plausible explanations due to what can be discerned about the anomaly, and those few options are the best overall explanations. They're only searching for the answers. Knowledge is what we should all be searching for. There should be "A Concert for to further check out the Baltic Sea Anomaly." I'd go!
Bring extra tanks!
My dive partner worked right there in Baltic Sea on oil platform. That platform tipped over. Is this the remains of the oils platforms leg formation mounts where leg broke from. PS my friend was home visiting his mom in hospital when accident happened leaving him one of few if any survivors. So you want to core drill into unknown, like UFO spaceship? Yeah boys, after watch end with long trench, could I not be leg of oil platform that had gas blowout an fell? You have multiple sites now, could those be each leg base?
Now we know where the Millenium Falcon is parked. Anyways, it amazes me how they can scan the Titanic in minute details almost 4000 metres below the surface of the ocean but only have blurry images of whatever this is.
Köszi srácok... Most sem derült ki semmi...gondolom elfogyott a pénz..  Elfogytak a támogatók... Nem akarják, hogy kiderüljön...
Millennium Faken
The wreakage of the "Millenium Falcon"?
Looks like the Saucer Section of the Enterprise.
is it a mold for making a         u   f    o
Maybe..contacting Elon must?
Ocean X Team has a YouTube channel. Maybe if they gain enough popularity and support, they can do another dive?
Its the Millennium Falcon.
submarine search system
I would throw them money if I had it.
I want to know what’s in Antarctica.
Star  wars  dans la mer baltic
It's the millennium falcon. You're welcome
U-pho
It's the Ebon Hawk.
Well, I called Han Solo, and he will pick it up when he is back from Jabba the Hut😂😂😂
Is that perhaps the crashed sun bark that EvD wrote about and that he once wanted to look for in another body of water?
The powers that be want you to stop. They want you to give up and let the world think you're liars and scammers. Please don't give up. It's without a doubt an ancient crash site. The world deserves to know the truth and you men who put everything into this deserve vindication.
Simple this is the millenium falcom just needed to ask me  xD
Millenium Falcon
Am I the only one... This looks like the millennium falcon
It costs "millions" to drill a core sample of the rock? What a bunch of con artists. Could it just be a natural rock formation? Of course.
You can see a stair case on it. It looks like an ancient place of worship. It could be Han Solos spaceship who knows.
They literally had a sample tested and its volcanic rock... Where do people get aliens from?!?
i am thrilled and entertained
Look, it’s circular so it could only be a UFO… C’mon, that’s an option, sure, but there’s literally way more other likely possibilities.
Looks like the Falcon Millenium!!!
loox like a crash site 2 me too.  Wonder if they managed another expedition & extracted a sample?
It's a freakin rock! This conclusion was made like 10 years ago, why did you even make a documentary about this? LMFAO FAIL!!
you remember the plug at the bottom of the bath tub? yep, same thing, except for the ocean. dont lift it off, you will be sorry.
Fox News always ruins everything LOL
a rock
It looks like a crash site, probably thousands of years old.
if t his turns out to be man made or a ufo fox will go bankrupt
I am of the opinion that it is a projection of rock modified for some purpose, for example to observe the movement of the sun, moon or stars. When could it have been? Obviously, at the time when this sea floor (and the whole gulf) was land with rivers, lakes, tundra and .... ice, and that was when, approx.? Who can guess? Otherwise, good luck collecting amber.
This could be the part of the objects seen in the sky at Nuremberg and Basel in the 1560s aerial phenomenon

Imagine getting a bunch of money and attention from a poorly Photoshopped image of the Millennium Falcon.
When I think of all the billionaires in this world who waste millions on politicians and property they will never occupy, it blows my mind that all the team could round up from anyone was a measly $200,000. Seriously?! Even with FOXNews making up stories about the anomaly being just a big ol rock, I would still be excited enough to plop down millions just to figure out how it got there, how old it is, and whether it's composition is entirely volcanic rock or if a layer is simply covering the object giving it shape. Sadly, I live in poverty in the U.S. so that's not about to happen...but if I can be that fascinated to find out more about it, then why not others with wealth and means?
Millennium Falcon
Looks like they entered from hyperspace in the wrong location. split second FTL literally fracturing the mountain!
It looks like something from halo, like something you'd find on the wall of a covenant ship. Man I hope its aliens.
I was hoping it was the Millennium Falcon. Peace Out.
Thumbnail is Master Chief’s helmet
Where is Geraldo?
The problem with places like this that are found. It is to this day people cannot wrap their head around that there are civilizations going back tens of thousands of years that were more advanced than we are today. But no one wants to believe that and that is the problem. Because they will never be looked at properly nor will they be scientifically evaluated like they should be. Instead the so-called historian exports are allowed to intervene and dictate their philosophical views with no real basis provable support. Instead they would want you to believe that ancient civilizations Were Nothing More Than A Step Above cavemen. Which is totally preposterous.
I mean, this all fits perfectly with the younger dryas catastrophe hypothesis. Sea levels were 400 feet lower than they are today so being that it's 300 feet below sea level, it was most likely a costal construction project or temple that got sent underwater after the flood. Please do some research before saying these ufo hunters are smart
ancient ruins

The Millenium Falcon ?
Funny how many of these kind of shows they say they run out of time.
It looks like a sort of building. Anyone can see the steps at the bottom right.
Did the Russian guy at 4:45 literally just say "wessel" like Star Trek?
It's clearly the Millennium Falcon. From as long, long time ago.
saying its an object is wrong , its the same type of formation they found and called Yonaguni , presume to be a foundation of a temple/city on an ancient island in japan before the flood more than 10 000 years ago ,more thruth is comin for sure
if it was anything special, the US Government would get it.  the end.
That’s definitely the Ebon Hawk
Wait don’t tell me …………. It’s a weather balloon 😂😂😂
Its the ebon hawk!  😂
Looks like a temple or other structure that got toppled and fused into that shape due to time and the elements... It has steps.... Pretty obvious what it is
He says if it came from space it would have a bigger impact crater   But he is totally overlooking that the water /sea would slow the impact completely
Looks like a rock quarry that is now under water
its the millenium falcon
Its nothing
You people are all nuts a space ship gee I hope everyone inside is ok 😂
got a massive Borne Identity vibe from the beginning of the video.
When big things hit the water the explode bada boom lol
It's the MILLENIUM FALCON~!
It's obviously The Millennium Falcon. We know for a fact that it dates back all the way to a long time ago and it came from a galaxy far, far away...
Halo Helmet?
46:20 if you don't wanna watch the full thing
Discarded Millennium Falcon from the movie studio
Very cool to see a diving team go after a mystery we've all wondered about!
looks like the millenum falcon
This is probably an Meteorite
There it is.. my milliminum falcon 😂😂
Got to love it when something man made is found at extreme depths and no one wants to look at it further because it looks like rocks to the untrained eye.  They were not able to drill into it to be able to determine exactly what it really is at this point.  It could be part of a very old structure from before AD that was buried by the changing land plates shifting.
Let me save you a watch. It’s a rock.
It looks like pretty similar with the ship from "galaxy far far away"
Fox News lied about these guys too! Is there anything they don't lie about.
15 seconds in and I can already tell you, it's the millennium falcon
How cannot all this be a hoax, just to promote their company!?
It’s the millennium falcon
I don’t like such programs because they literally talk about people who literally came close to alien technologies that were petrified due to the influence of time and nature, and such: Oh well, we all probably won’t study this further, oh everything, oh no money, oh we we do not know, oh everything is ambiguous. Mankind is a bunch of stupid children who have not matured, who cannot take and get to the bottom of the cosmic truth.
It is more likely that it was a shuttle, a landing capsule, a starship that made an emergency landing on earth in very ancient times, it may have crashed along with the crew, but it is possible that the crew survived and ejected. If you really want to explore this - explore more actively, don't be like most of the stupid humanity who are snotty kids who play in a sandbox full of alien objects and drool over them thinking they are ordinary pebbles
49:50.  Thats why i hate maiormedia they lie and discredit important truthseekers
no doubt like Easter island were there will be something much bigger underneath
Das Raumschiff ist von Star wars  👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👽🛸👽☮️☮️☮️☮️☮️

Ufo itu hanyalah mainan remotcontrol anak2 alien  !  Fatamogana  doang tak bisa di raba tak mungin ditangkap   !  😜😜😜😜
hahah yea  never will belive you. What was there is already in hands of USA which came very quickly to check it out.
You should try talking to an archaeologist.
So what does drilling reveal then? Rock?
If this object WAS extraterrestrial, the US military would have had it away long ago, or made the area out of bounds to all. They haven’t. It isn’t.
There is NO DOCUMENTARY available that will tell you what this thing is. Nobody knows. And sadly it seems that nobody really cares either.
don't give up....................something magical down there................its simply waiting for you to discover... don't ever give up..
It looks like a UFO that's been fossilized.
If these divers were not treasure hunters, their video might not be received with so much disbelief and ridicule. However, if this is a legitimate find, it should be investigated to a conclusion. Mankind is inherently curious. I see evidence (be it real or concocted) that something skidded along the bottom of the sea bed, and is resting on the sea floor. Further investigation is necessary to know for certain what it is, how it got there, who is responsible for it and why it is there.
Or aliens dropped it out there ufo lol
I think this was a piece of concrete from Atlantis
It is just the top of the roof, not a Falcon Millenium.
I found myself stunned by the fact that I had lost those, "glittering eyes" spoken of in the quote at the end when I was guessing throughout at the most banal of outcomes, now I see that it is still possible that some of those real mysteries and secrets yet remain in this world and one should not lose the mind to at the very least accept one when confronted head-on.
What if this really is where we came from
A pile of rocks?!? 🤣
It's the Millennium falcon.
It's the Melenium Falcon
Fake news
I'm certain it's the millennium falcon
OR. THE RUSSIANS. DISPOSED. OF SOME. NUCLEAR. WASTE
do they ever get to the point?
Nothing new. It was probably ripped off another channel should probably download this or just not recommend this to your suggestions
Crash landed into the ocean
I have also looked into this. And I think it  is something no one can explain fully. But it does indeed look like a crash sight.
that first pic of them finding it looks like the Millennium Falcon
I totally thought the still for the video title was a Master Chief helmet, L’all.
My imagination got the better of me.  It resembles a spacecraft of  some sort.
Plot twist: it's a toilet seat
Why not let Musk have a go. He's got the money?
I believe this object crashed and who knows how long probably way even before the dinosaur time and nature has taken it course with volcanic sand and minerals covering the object but still gives it shape and size and the captain is getting threats from the secret service and u diffinitly know its a crash 🛸
It looks like the millennium falcon.
Whether you like it or not, the Millenium Falcon is real. Srarwars is real (well at least the first trilogy).
It's looks like a gun from helo,end of story
So this UFO hasn't been recovered. How do you let perfectly good alien technology just sit there?
I am not shocked that one of the most corrupt and artificial tv stations in the world put out that article, not surprised, you only have to look at their recent track history to realise how cynical and sad they are. Were they told to do this, because the answer Peter was looking for would open up the idea there are alien forces that exist. And the fbi wanted it kept quiet for some reason.
Hide the truth, divide, ridicule... control the slaves 😊
Was just scrolling just wanted to point out it looks like Masterchiefs helmet
Master chief
Gosh these guys are horrific on camera.  Trying to do dramatic pauses and suspense, it's cringy and weird lol It's a rock by the way.  I'll save you some time
There have been many rock formations in the seas off Greece and the ancient world which were seen as man-made and in shapes that couldn´t possibly be natural which turned out to be very natural. End of story.  The oceans and seas are so vast that almost anything is possible as far as rock formations are concerened. The main problem in this case is that none of the three are scientists. One is only a diver, but all of them want it to be something spectacular and bring them fame. Good-bye and good luck.  Notice: There is no such thing as luck. There are only circumstances and situations.
If there is scientificinvestigation the idea is NOT to triger the imagination as the head of the Swedish UFO group with  a faint smile.  Any idea that something like this can be an aliain vessel is not my idea of an "open-mind".
At 0:56 it looked like a rock formation to me. That is the problem with TV shows. They have to get your attention and drag it out for an hour, with commercials, meaning about 45-50 Min.
Finally its rock
Sick and tired of these stupid expedition videos. Time wasters
No one can identify? It is the Millenium Falcon.😂
We are on earth surface, at remote locations like south and north pole, some deserts, Bhartiya/ Indian Himalayan mountain range, on moon , on mars , on sun and other different galaxy and other universe also...  I am higher spiritual being, in my last life I was doing great work ( cultivating) for earth's upcoming human civilization.  We succeed to creat good humans but now days majority of humans are ignoring pure spirituality and righteousness that's why we have to make tough decision to teach good lesson to ignorant arrogant humans.
one thing is for sure... someone doesn't want us down there
They're hiding something
It's the millennium falcon. Case solved.
I want to pick it up with a net and balloons 😂😂😂😂 it certainly is very intriguing 😁
It's most likely a glacial deposit.
🧡🧡🧡🧡
Yeah, nothing to see here it was filmed very dramatically for the documentary. The setup was typical,  weather bad, then the side scan radar gets lost,  then they have fog,  then data is corrupted,  all rather convenient. Just a standard script.
Don't watch it Giant waste of anyone's time
“ALIENS”
That’s not an UFO tho, it’s a UWO, learn your lore   (Unidentified Wrecked Object)
its nothing because it was something U.S. govenment would have got it removed off of youtube.
only Han Solo has the key to solve this 😅
I wonder if it could be a spaceship made of stone. The material would have come from an asteroid in space. No need to build a ship, simply carve it from the asteroid, drill into it and make voids and then fill the voids with equipment, and attach propulsion equipment to one end of the carved object. Then the stone spaceship departs on some sort of mission. at the destination, the stone spaceship enters the atmosphere and lands in the ocean.
Based on the photo in the thumbnail, it's definitely an alien weapon, although we don't have to worry about it, Master Chief took care of that species years ago.
Do Not Stop Looking for It!!!.....Keep Going!!!
Just say it is made of rare minerals, people will give you the money to re visit after all they are planning to mine asteroids in future
kool! great video!
This maybe a Alien plug to form an exiskelton shell for theie space ship..??
THE FOUND IT! THAT THING made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs!
A youfo? What’s that? I assume he means ufo
I want to help these people because I think they are on to something. There is two crash sites not one and it seems to be a part of the same Baltic anomily as the first . There is a great interest in this more than you know, If anyone know how to contact them let me know on the replys
Am I the only one who recognises the wreckage of the Millennium Falcon?? 😶
Yes, it's a crash site.
Fox News decided the ending of this research that’s sad.
Sigh ...this video just wasted all our time. It answered no questions and only presented what they themselves were complaining about in the video. It is nothing more than a 57.5 minute long commercial and propaganda to get this guy funding from someone to sponsor another trip.
it appears the  government propaganda department has been working overtime to discredit the find
An ancient site for burning stuff maybe with a man made level access road? I think it would be more likely to be man made. This also requires that it is investigated.
The true evils are not the team but the creators of this documentary, seriously is this fiction ? 57 minutes of wasted time ? a big downvote.
That’s the wreck of Millennium Falcon!
Well, that's 57 minutes I'll never get back. Spoiler alert - They run out of money and never find out what it is.
Yo, Star wars fans .....we found the millennium Falcon......
This is old. Have there been any updates
Millennium Falcon
Millennium Falcon😂
I also believe it to be a crash site , if this object came thru the atmosphere at Sonic ? speed is it possible this object would be coated in some ...? before cooling after entering the Baltic sea ??  The object is to "man" (alien) made for it to be  NOTHING
the Bible tells us the world was covered by a global flood. So yes whatever it is was probably man made.
Youfo is my favorite pronunciation of UFO now
The US Government has already explored this thing and has either blocked all their funding because it's something amazing or they've determined that it is nothing and this is just a dead story.  We will most likely never know.
300 ft, send down a camera
I’m curious as to WHEN these nutz are going to send a dive crew or submersible down to actually film this thing? Other than just guess at what it is. They just keep rehashing the same boring information over and over. Just like “Oak Island”. There’s nothing there. Put up or shut up and quit milking this Pig.
2 mins in and I already know it's one of those fake documentaries answering nothing but including it could be anything, they all emit the same vagueness in every spoken word. Its a rock, nothing more nothing less.

It looks like a tree trunk
You fowww 😅😅 00:48
I don't understand why they didn't mark down the coordinates the 1st time they found it Don't you do that when you find something Just doesn't make sense Can someone please explain
Stop it.
Rock
A group of divers collected samples from the mysterious entity and gave their finding to scientists who determined that the Baltic Sea Anomaly is simply a glacial deposit. Much of the Baltic Sea was carved out by moving glaciers during the Ice Age. Research undertaken by scientists from Stockholm University has revealed the Baltic Sea Anomaly is leftovers from that process.
Lol its obviously rocks. How can anyone think any different
... Falcon Millenium obviously
Y’all found the Millennium Falcon
We all just going to ignore that it looks like the millennium falcon?
That "massive object" appears to be a quarry.
If so far this thing has not been investigated by the Swedish or Russian navy then..... let's start crowdfunding
The world grows smaller and less interesting while everyone is simply being overly contented by the model technology. Kind of sad really...
Millenium Falcon, crashed in the multi-verse. Mystery solved. Moving on.🧐
Spoke too soon. 😁
Its a big rock…..
Looks like the Millennium Falcon to me.
Even rock looks like stone after enough time. It can absolutely be some sort of machine that's millions of years old. Who knows, and until someone funds these people, unfortunately none of us will.
Master Chief
Call a geologist next time, it will cost far less money....
Its the Millineum Falcon, that's where it ended up after Han and Chewy ditched it after it was damaged by a Berridium mine.
it's a rock.
Leave these poor guys alone...without a spirit of adventure and curiosity nothing would be discovered ...theres more things underground and in water than most people realize...if i were a billionaire id throw them a million dollars to dive again and drill and just figure it out..and if turned out to be something boring so be it..but these guys have the spirit of adventure that humanity needs....good luck guys
It looks like something crashed there breaking the underwater hill in half and going under the mud to the final place where maybe it melted the rock around to produce the "volcanic rock." I bet water caused that is buried under the circular rock or the rock encases the object.
The Baltic Sea is where the Millennium Falcon rests.  How did Steven Spielberg know? 🤔
"THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE"
Is this issue were purposely dragged to slowdown to monetize the story? Jeezz, its been years since they announce it. I bet they did not found anything but only a natural rock formation.
I think they (and we) should've called it USO (Unidentified Submarine Object) instead of UFO simply because... 😅
It's obviously the Millennium Falcon
And again, any sighting of a "UFO", even in a documentary, is far and blurred! How come all those random people who saw a UFO in the sky haven't cleaned their phone camera lenses??! It's never clear, it's never close! Even though we claim to have great technology!
is it possible this was being moved by ancient people and somehow fell and sunk? it looks like a boat dock orrrr the millennium falcon.
There are very powerful navy and offshore oil & gas industry vessels that can inspect the site relatively quickly with adequate equipment. These ships are designed for advanced deep sea underwater operations. It looks like it should stay where it is without "touching" and it is very similar to underwater "rocks formations" found recently near Japanese coast.
Oh snap, that's the USS Defiant from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.
The threatening messages they started receiving is even more convincing for me, that this is not just a pile of rocks! I think that some scientists are paid to create any natural explanation, doesn’t matter how it fits the reality. Great work ocean x!
I love how EVERY government agency, country, scientific institution with buckets of money to research this (and spent MORE on lesser concerns,discoveries), are like “laaa dee dah🎵 la deeeee dahhh🎵”  skipping right along, not noticing this significant finding. Nothing to see here- ignore-ignore-ignore… absolutely shameful their dismissive BS non-actions!
must recover the space ship
So we have a fossilized Alien Ship in the sea bed, that is cool.  time to x-ray that thing.
cmon.. by the shape anyone should be able to tell what this is.. clearly the millenium falcon ;)
This was an unnecessarily dramatic venture. If they truly found something "extraordinary" the Govt. of the World would've swooped in.
for me this just looks like ordinary rock
This story is still buried.
The material looks like some sort of megalithic stone work we see throughout the world. The Earth had a very different past history than our Historians teach us. More and more proof of vast past civilizations we have never been taught about keep appearing or being discovered. And the grand scale of these works is astounding. 1000's of years ago that area of the sea was likely land at one point. But because of tectonics,flood's,etc... over 1000's of years land marks get pulled along with the moving crust and waters can either flood or recede. The eerie ness of how much this artifact looks like the Star Wars Falcon space ship is one of the craziest coincidence I have ever read though. My money is it was built by a long gone civilization as an Religious or Astronomical altar or other significant landmark that in time was lost and forgotten due too extreme changes in the weather and landscapes of Earth.
These advertising is really annoying 😭 🛑 stop other people like it I don't
Why haven't they created a kick starter campaign to get the funding they need?
It's a ufo that crashed it still emits radiation and it's old it would b a trip if the thing fires up boom out of the water  can't you see by the shape of it they got samples from it they know it's not man made 😕😲 see it's a🤥 spaceship of some kind black stuff burnt residue from heat
I hope someone with the spare cash helps fund these guys.
Looks like a crane part to move massive stone blocks
I read somewhere that the real deep research is classified
Watch this documentary for the fifth or sixth time this time with my husband brought tears to my eyes. I love watching it at the end truly worth it I hope you guys get funding soon again you deserve it God bless and Godspeed.
Very good documaentary
Hey buddy!
If i was a rich man like Elon Musk for example, i would gladly give these boys all the money they need to countinue their effort in uncovering the truth about this anomaly...
It's the millennium falcon  😮
I want to learn the answers to what this is with a burning fervor. I wish them luck and hope my mind learns the answer to my question. Godspeed to them.
This is clearly the millennium falcon. Its a fake i suppose
I can't believe how much money they spent just to look at it again at it and here I am in the United States at the age of 60 worrying about whether I'll have enough food to eat tomorrow.
What is it?    A POS
The Millennium Falcon, c'mon, everybody knows it!!
The voice of the narrator is the same as on STALKER call of Pripyat?
Wow ! The Millenium Falcon !
Soo Star Wars is actually sea wars.. they found the millennium falcon
Wow what an ending. Just awesome.
Not warched this doc yet.. when i see this shape i think gun turrett.. maybe ill change my mind
I loved it, you're documentary was very brave and I hold the upmost respect for your efforts all. Keep well all. Thanks again
Looks like the millennium falcon
Can it be that it is part of  an astroide that broke off and land in the sea on earth.
They are so stupid and have no idea that they will their family at the same time their family lifes in the mate of timmmmme. What POutin did was to end the end of eussiamm  Imperialismm and soon or later, this will  jusiied.
please let me know how I am able to fihght the russian enemy
As much as I appreciace the effort of the whole crew I do think that there is really too little info about the whole structure to draw any conclusion from it. I know that many of us woud love to see the proof of extraterrestrial origin of this object but a wish is sometimes stronger then reality.Even though I am into UFO / UAV and advanced ancient civilizations I personaly think this is of a natural origin despite it looks "outworldly". And I am also afraid that without much larger investigation everything will stay as a mere speculation.
let us save any ceatues And I am ready to do that...just let me know how?
Aliens was using one mechanism which was gravity open and same was using one looking like torch which was having power to transform anything to stone , you can’t understand now because you not ready , world is not ready , it will create panic , greedy and  death
Just because it looks like the Millennium Falcon doesn't mean it is.
Millennium Falcon!
I am almost confidentally sure, that it's manmade. It's covered in basalt which stems from volcanic activity which didn't happen in this area for AT LEAST 14.000 years, more likely somewhere between 30.000 to 140.000 years. By then, the baltic sea as it is now didn't even exist back then, it was just plain land. I'm pretty sure we're all on the same page that civilization began a lot sooner than modern archeologists care to admit. We know of Göbekli Tepe, which is dated to be about 13.000 years old and I'm perfectly fine with assuming, we're going to find even older sites in the coming future.
Someone hid the Millennium Falcon down there
Why do so many people automatically assume the most ridiculous, outlandish " possibilities?"  A UFO. Really. Looked like something made of wood to me. A piece of junk laying on the bottom. No, no, it MUST be a UFO, naturally.
I've told a few people that I know about this thinf
Keep on doing what you do and ask questions!!! I hope you will be able to reveal what is really is!
Weaponized news media strikes again, with a legion of paid commentors to throw them off the trail, remember the Navy was already there possibly looking at it, and then left in a hurry. It almost makes me hate the time we are stuck living in, when new discoveries are shelfed or boxed away just to keeps us under their thumb of control.
They didn't want you to find the truth my friend so they discredit you. I know for a fact that there are things out there that governments don't want us to know about. Why do you think that war ship was out there
Does anyone know if there are F.L.I.R. water proof specs? Or nightvision for diving?
Wow this a great example or  another example of the media's power to change public opinion .....they were on to something and someone knew it. Damn the media
Hans Solo had submerged the Millenium Falcon until further notice from the Jedi...
It's the Millennium Falcon.
the sudden FoxNews involved is kinda give big question mark, kinda like wanted to say "wrapped it up, forget it"
UNderground Russian Submarine Base, think we know this now. Smart Russians. That concrete hides an entire Russian Submarine Platoon.
It’s a rock
It's a little obvious.
Seems like it would have made more sense to locate the exact coordinates first with a small team; Then do the dives later. All that for one ten min. dive. Better pictures alone may have found funding for a more extensive investigation.
Yo all they needed was the key on Mount Chilliad before going to the UFO, dang.
It's the Millennium Falcon
OK so 2 things immediately jump out at me: the Swedish navy tailed you to the dive location, and your own diver is/was obviously ex-military. So if there was something there, it isn't there any more, and we will never know what it was.
hay hi heurd of this  hi hope you get there end investiget
Okay so what was it ?
It's quite obviously the Millennium Falcon
Einstein was a laughing stock.....the only fools were those who didn't listen
If we ever hear the end of this, I'd be very surprised. When an artifact like this, "crashed alien ship" is found, everybody is going to scramble and fight over it. The everyday joe won't ever know the full story. It happens more often than you might think. I would like to know how anyone expects to raise this artifact  . A lot of questions to be asked.
another Oak Island adventure.  lol
Those divers have huge nuts
big salute to this guys🙌
its the millennium Falcon
“It looked like a yufo”
Try asking Elon....
Is there anyone on the treasure-hunting team called Greco?  Immediately after watching this video, I chose to watch S.Kubricks "2001 - A Space Odyssey" - In the 27th minute of the movie there's a scene/conversation (including actor Leonard Rossiter) that goes - "Q. Where is Greco?  A. Oh he's doing some underwater research in the Baltic!"  A complete concidence that I should encounter this dialogue after watching the doco.  So, is Greco on the team? 🐏..
Humans are a really sick species, bored with their own lives then persecute scientists who are really trying their best to uncover mysteries
Never give up your explorations!
And it looked like a...you'fo
ELON MUSK--get on board with funding this expedition--we need answers!
Don't ever give in and keep going
The ship split a mountain underwater and slowly came to a still..... Time will tell..
Wow that's crazy
It is the Millennium falcon.... Well said and stick to it...
It was burning up entering Earth's atmosphere, it has been down in the cold water for thousands of years.
This is the spaceship from Star Wars been in the water for a long long time...
I also captured the weird item on April 4 last night, and it moved significantly. Is this a UFO?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyoOmsio3Pc&t=18s
Yes it looks like a crash site. Great show, hope one of the many people in the world with too much money can get on board and fund your next expedition.
Ancient temple pre cataclysm. I think we will start finding more and more of these underwater structures.
🤔😎❤👽 ✌
Well done guys, I hope someone funds your next expedition mabey starting with core samples like you said as it’s definitely worth getting to the bottom of this mystery, but don’t let the other fools get you down as they’re the ones who comment after they’ve pulled there heads out of there arses before putting it back in for safety. Good luck guys
Great stuff I'm a big believer in your work, thank you Dave n family.   sincerely, PatRok.
Your thumbnail is a lie.
The shape shown in photo oddly resembles the shape of the MELLINEOM FALCON  it you were to view the FALCON from above ship. .. Hmmmm did, George get his design from some other knowledge.. Just a thought.  Lol
Nonsense
Was excellent I’m surprised one of the big channels like discovery hasn’t funded this for a full show insane.
I hate this " if X happens, this whole thing ends" kind of documentary , feels like gold rush
See also: [4k] Drone Tour of Shiprock - A Geological and Cultural Landmark in the Navajo Nation, New Mexico
Thank you gentlemen  For what you have done for all of us. If you break off coral on top of a ship wreck and analyse it - it is only coral a natural object , does not mean the wreck below does not exist. Keep up the good work , remember there are always people who want to discourage new discoveries as they challenge accepted dogmas. Once again thank you and never give up. All the best from down under. Lewis Sydney  Australia 🇦🇺
I'm not even gonna try and watch this because anyone who's seen the REAL picture and not some cgi edited thumbnail (ehem, looking at you) can clearly see it rock formation worn by being underwater for many hundreds of thousands to millions of years. The end. Go back to your disgrace, belonging more on history channel with Erik VinDanagen and those charlatans. Spit on you, peytuw!
I'm not much of a Star Wars fan, but that sonar image in the beginning looked just like the Millennium Falcon.
Why know one talks about the object disappearing or taken by government agencies after the discovery?
I'm thinking, "don't move it! It's the plug in the drain!"
I was always skeptical of this, but when I saw the 3D with the mountain cut in two...wow! to me, it is 1000% a crash site.
This is awesome!  Why is man so evil?  There is so much of this world YET to be discovered.  May God continue to bless you and your current team and give you the desires of your heart.  There is a lot out there that they don't want anyone to find or discover as well.  God go before you and KEEP GOING!!!!  I pray that you discover something huge.  God bless your children as well and may they be encouraged by your spirit and eagerness to explore, learn and understand this world.  REMAIN ENCOURAGED AND KEEP GOING NO MATTER WHAT; ESPECIALLY IF IT IS A DESIRE THAT YOU CAN PASS ON TO YOUR CHILDREN.  Great video.
Probably something blown off the top of Vesuvius years ago,rock table, with city etched on it 👁️⚖️☕👉
Yes... it is a UFO... actually you can see the control panel in the cockpit !...
00:49 Why did he just pronounce UFO like it's a singular word. He said YOUFO. wtf is up with channels like this so blatantly making mistakes like this lmfao
Well that expose of how treasure hunters operate got absolutely nowhere!
This says nothing about what the title says. Saving you time so you live better.
It's clearly part of some sort of ancient construction you can clearly see steps on it. It just coincidently looks like the millennium falcon
its a rock
I vote an ancient civilization lost to planetary shifts... buried in time.
Definitely it's something out of extraordinary under water there, nothing can do a damage 💔 to the mountain like a fish or volcanic activity yeah from where? It's very interesting and it hast to come out to the surface we can't stay in wonder-land dreaming about it hope there's a way to fund an expedition to examine deeper ones for all. Blessings to the team
Yea, well tell me when they find it, examine it, touch it, figure it out. I'm not waiting.
It’s the millennium falcon, hon and chewy did the kessel run in 12 par secs. Everyone knows this.
Fox -  the entertainment channel  and Fake News.
A scientist says he needs more samples to make a determination, but a yappy news agency blurts out that they are just scammers wanting money, as if the journalist wasn't thinking Pulitzer, Pulitzer. And now no one will fund the effort to investigate further. People talk too much.
discredit you boyz so an agency might swoop & scoop for themselves?
They found the Millennium Falcon
That was above water 12k years ago, we had humans there to have some conection.... but its above a mount sou i think it is noa's ship
Vikings are the best diver sçientists. i ♡ baltik meer
I'm sorry they had to go through that, I hope they find a solution😘
Why are you asking the public? Just float the damn thang and you tell us. A better question is where do they find you BLOCKHEADS!
Clearly, that is the Millennium Falcon...duh
I like how the government tries to scare them off with a warship and when that doesnt work, they start a disinformation campaign to pull their funding.   That alone makes you wonder if theyre really onto something.
The math is consistent with the greek colosium roof. It also explains why its not perfectly round. covered in volcanic ash it would most definetly seem concrete like. I might suggest that you cross reference fallen baltic structures.
Thank You my.  friends ,Super 2023
Wow!! Very interesting documentary, and I wish to the whole crew that one day, they could solve this mystery!!! Wish you the best!!!
It almost looks like sabotage was at play to insure that they never got to the object in time whilst the money is running out so as to deter them from pushing on.
💙💜💚
At the end.. with the improved scan.. Looks to me as a crash of some kind with two skid lines.. The fact that they stop at the anomaly is pretty dang convincing to me.. If I had Billions.. I'd invest heavily into exploring this and even try to bring it up.. Or at least bring up the smaller one first..
Watched the first ten minutes, skipped to the end. It's a rock.
Very good guess and likely correct.  Better to feed the poor with our money and then ask USA military to show other crash sites they have recovered.  But humans are only smart monkeys who will never figure out the knowledge of beings evolved for millions of years past our level of development. But it is certainly shameful that honest exploders have been threatened.
Ok, so they found a heat shield from a galatic scout... now what? hehehe.
It’s the mellinium falcon duh…….
A crash site!…
The government is trying to make him seem like a quack so he stops looking. They don't want him to discover the truth
Come on guys everyone knows it's the millennium falcon
You need to keep digging around it, but I'm sure they've already did that... Just didn't tell the public. That is not a craft, it's just part of a top surface to a much larger structure, way larger.
Keep ur head high
Some reason it reminds me of the structure found off the JAPANESE COAST
Very good what you are luckily looking at is a crash site of the real Millennium Falcon the filming of Star Wars at its earliest stages therefore you do indeed have the Millennium Falcon
It's  the Millennium Falcon
crash site for Shure.
Its the gun from the 5th element! Time traveler must've dropped it!
THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT DOCUMENTARY.!!! DON'T GIVE UP. DISCOVERY CHANNEL SHOULD FUND THE NEXT EXPLORATION WITH AN ROV.  Just know that there are thousands of us people out here who morally support your curiosity and effort.!!! Try to ignore the masses of ignorant and hateful people out there.  You guys have great attitudes.!!! God Bless, and keep you all safe.!
Its th Milennium Falcon!
why does this so called et ship look alot like the one hans solo pilotted
Could be evidence for ancient building tech where rock was heated, molded into shape, and cooled.
I still think that this a part of a Larger Space Ship that broke off in space from a Disaster ?
That's just the millennium falcon
Don't give up - people that r critical have nothing else 2 do but gossip n bully. Only the daredevils with a good wit can explore the unknown.  So continue exploring until you n only u are satisfied with your findings. In order 2 conquer the unknown - u cannot listen 2 negative vibe. Also b proud of what u already accomplished. I'm sending blessings n I can't wait 2 see the 2 part of this adventure... We are so proud 2 have good Explorer still.
No way! Fox News spreading bs?!
Thanks!
Crowdfunding when?
They should talk to Randal Carlson
All those who are called to explore, who are pushed from within to know the unknown have had to endure the "nah sayers" those who are reminded that they seek attention for doing nothing with their lives. But do this for the rest of us that must know answers, because we are the Explorers who can only dream with you. Do not give up....
🤔…..(yawn)….. volcanic activity, or possibly a meteorite.  Nothing more to see here 🙄.  But so many people want to believe it’s an alien craft or structure of some sort…..thus, hundreds of thousands of $’s and tons of energy, and wasted time goes into this total waste of a project.  Meanwhile….. millions of people starve.
I believe the stone was used as a tool to build ships. The burnt pitch is around it that was used to seal the planks. There are measures on the stone and it is curved to the way it would be for bending planks. There is a canyon near this. its where the ships were set while they were built. I think this is where Noah built the Ark.
What's underneath that is the question
I HEARD ITS BEEN DOWN THERE SO LONG IT FOSSILIZED
The update quotes during the credits give me hope. Fox News ran a story without even bothering to contact the people involved in the expedition. I feel so bad for these men and what Natalie Wolchover has done to them.
Easy - it's better known as The Millennium Falcon... and it's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy
Contact Elon Musk a explorer he might help
Thanks for the doc , would love to find out the second anomaly as part of the first breaking up on contact with the hill top. Mind blowing , thanks again
What a pathetic joke. What people will do to extort money from people. Whether that is a museum of faux bs or a documentary designed to be trustworthy.  Like the shroud of Turin they gas light people by constant bombardment of lies, then they use probability psychology and modern day smoke and mirrors to manipulate your ability to discern truth. The longer a lie is preached the more people believe the lie as truth.
If you ever go back , try dropping a super large magnet before you dive again.  Good luck and stay safe !
That's Millennium falcon, right?
Ebon Hawk looks like.
Get some serious financial backing and get back on site and figure this thing out once and for all....
It's the Millennium Falcon. Idk how they don't see this...
Could it have something to do with a shifting of the poles.?
Damn , who was responsible for Chkin the weekly forecast?
So it's a rock. What a surprise!
What it's coated with malton rock. But only right there? No more molten rock anywhereselts. Couldn't be Natural volcano?
At first glance, it looks like the Millenium Falcon!
OK LETS CLARIFY  SOMETHING ....IS IT ROCK OR MEATEL? THAT TELL YOU EVERTHING ...ROCK CAN NOT BE A SPACE SHIP
An asteroid, molten, crashed at a steep angle and quickly flattened and solidified. That checks off ALL possibilities.
I see a crash site, perhaps pre-dating the global flood when the area was dry land. If I were a trillionaire I'd fund finding the answers in a heartbeat
It was a rock outcropping that was used by some ancient culture when the sea levels were much lower...there now you know what it is.
The Millennial Falcon from Star Wars
I believe most comments come from the US. Lots of easily mislead simpletons in that country. What you see in this mockumentary is a geological  formation, it could be the remains of a lava-pipe or a meteorite. But it is not a space ship, it is not man made and in general of only very limited interest to anyone.
Right at the start (1:20),  it admits .."you don't get answers only more ?s". Don't bother
really ? coulda woulda shoulda ? take a damn drill down and get a core sample you people should have done that the first time. more then likely you did take a core sample and it came up a rock but you are not submitting that info because you want to get someone to PAY for you to go back with new equipment .. you are milking this for donations .. what else can explain why a bunch of scientists that are supposed to be intelligent did not take a frickin drill with them ? C4 explosives .. over and done stop pissing around.
Who would be interested in donating to a gofundme campaign to help keep this amazing team and their research going? I see that a lot of people are interested. A small donation by many can make a big change for this team. There won't be any answers unless the public gets involved.
It resembles an incapsulated  container carrying cameras and other viewing equipments to scan some parts of those areas.My favourite guide and ELDER from our KINDERGARTEN,ELDER IKAI once told me a story of the ORITITES from AZEE.EN EEKE MAI EA
I LOVE these guys!!! The passion, the determination, the faith!!! I swear if I had the money I would instantly invest in their efforts!!! This is super inspirational, it gripped my heart, mind, and soul, almost cried from how emotional their perseverance made me. Just know, every bit of it was worth it, for the sake of human evolution and betterment, thank you all.
I will always be fascinated by this anomaly. It certainly looks like it came in fast, sliced through the mountain, and landed where it did. The shape is NOT natural. Whether man-made or alien-made, it is fascinating. If I had the money, I would certainly pay for an expedition to return to the site. And I would love to go (but only with about 100 seasick pills)!!!  I wish you guys the best and keep us informed. patsy
Was there a part 2 ?
Even if this is ‘just rock’ it still has a story to tell. Especially as the volcanic  debris was not expected to be in this area. People invest millions to study ice glaciers and their movement so I’m surprised No has suggested investigating this in a similar way. Has any other volcanic debris similar to this been discovered in other unexplained areas? I for one would like to know more. I hoe you get your funding.
THIS IS A CRASSITE INDEED, THEY ARE DAMN RIGHT
It's rocks, if it was somthing out of this world it would have been hoovered up by now.
You need to find the answers, the only time Fox news ridicules people is when you are over a target that they don't want you to identify, I would love to know what they are trying to hide from humanity, in would love to know what they really think it is that they don't want you to identify. . . Like your diver said , there are more questions than answers. Good luck with your exploration my friend ❤️ 🙏🙏🙏
That object, what ever is it, definitely hit that area and created that crevasse. He need more founding to investigate it thoroughly.
Master chiefs helmet has been located
Has anyone went back there ? Any updated videos ?
It's the millennium falcon :-)
Need more data, I would love to see that it is all opened up on where and how we got here and is this just another chapter in human evolution! Sub humans before us as we are today, whom will think the same about us millions of years in the future !
German made to be cannon turret bombed and sunk before it reached it's destination!
Believe what you want but the is no supporting evidence of an ufo. Looks like a rock to me.
Typical FOX NEWS spreading lies
Its just the milenium falcon
One question I had: why did the geologist not carbon date the rock sample? Or did he and it was ruled out as too old to be plausible. Radio carbon dating would be the 1st thing I would have done, along with a chemical analysts of rick samples using a mass spectrometer.
Great team - really honest, genuine and brave guys. I hope they get the chance to go back and perhaps drill into the anomalies. Excellent documentary - thanks for sharing!
There is still enough to be investigated here! There must be someone with enough money and interest to fund the exploration of this anomaly. I feel sorry fot the team and it makes me saddened and angry that people would go so far as to threaten them , why would you do that?! Even if this is a natural phenomenon, it is still interesting to find out! Come on, give these guys a break and fund them someone!!
Look at the volcano in Lombok
Its possible look at the landslide in Alaska 1962  A 1000 wave  A person wrote about it he and his son was on the water when it hit
Mayb a spaceship that got out of sink flew through while their was a volcanic explosion and titlewave
They couldn’t write down the exact coordinates the FIRST time?!😂
That's the real Millennium Falcon.. it's been here for billions of years and now fossilized..😅😂
Always the crash sites...aliens coming from billions and billions of miles away with their insanely advanced technology for them to crash on earth at arrival......
Looks like something from Star Wars!
Wow!..what an incredible story and verry shocking!verry intereting that full of knowledge that leads us for the true answer.if we are alone in these universe!
Very interesting video. Isn't it unusual to have such a large difference between the number of likes compared to the relatively large number of views!?
Dennis  & partner the second guy u went to to tell u what kind of rock it was sold u out. Someone promised him something from that from some rich folks that's going for it. So they started all the rumors so u couldn't get help  next time have whoever sciencetist u use had them sign nds. And when u find out, because u will ,then u go for their throats. I know u might not have the money to watch him but I will be praying GOD exposes him to u. GoD bless u guys.
That is over 500,000’years old.. Look at the sediment… That is next level…
GOD knows your hearts, guys... Don't be saddened, God is with you and your families! We love you!
Manifesting that James Cameron see this documentary.
Praying that technology for underwater exploration advance immensely so that it will not be very expensive to operate.
Those cable wires must be checked before you send down the ROV, to see if it is in safe and secure condition.
Crashsite but very old so they need to take samples by dig holes. anyway this is more than 10 years, they act too slow.
It's a toilet seat photoshopped to look exciting in order to extract and defraud money from viewers.
Well its just an ancient ruin, dating back to pre deluge when the water level was 120 meters lower. It used to be a watchtower over the then dry lands. Approximately more than 15000 years old at least
Looks curiously like the millennium falcon.. This is not the shipwreck you’re looking for
YALL ITS THE MILLENIUM FALCON
Ok so this object looks and sounds like ʻOumuamua'. Perhaps Avi Loeb with their listening project can back up these boys and give them some funding. It might be exactly what they are looking for. Didn't the professor hire people to sweep the oceans for advanced crashed extraterrestrial objects in our oceans?
LOVE YOU ocean X
That is the millennium falcon is it not?
Great documentary...keep searching - keep believing guys!! Nay-Sayers are only that...
I love this documentary! It was exciting and had me so curious.   I wished I had the money to help you go back down or someone go in a small submarine with brighter lights.  It could be an ancient city or base or my real idea is it's a crash.   And with it being black under the sand, made me think it caught on fire and crashed into the sea.   I am 100% on your side and think you are very intelligent and have a very cool hobby of treasure hunting. To me, what you found is a real treasure.   I like you and your team.   Thanks for sharing this discovery.
Let Han Solo know we found the Falcon
Great video of people standing around talking.   Heck with the object.   Give it a couple of seconds that’s good enough
There's not a machine that can tell if it's metal or rock?
Even if this is nothing more than a geological phenomena, it warrants investigation. Volcanic rock in the middle of the Baltic sea? The Universities need to band together for funding and conduct an investigation, blowing this off is bad for science.
Why can’t they send a small Deep Sea bobble sub down to look at it , 300 ft would be nothing for it ?
I'm sure out there somewhere somebody knows but like everything else, its not us. Will never be us! 🤔
its the millennium falcon
Its the Malinum Falcon.
If there are no Extra-Terrestrial agendas being hidden by the US government (CIA, NSA shadow government etc) then why are so many researchers lives threatened? If it's all nonsense then why would they care?
Only a minute or so before the end I hear the word coincidence. There is no such thing as a coincidence.
Call Musk.
I want to know how much the warrant for his arrest is worth? I know a lot of bounty hunters who would love the opportunity to earn that reward.
Hmmm....IF all this is so astounding (and I want to believe it is!) why hasn't a single major expedition been back in the several years since first "discovered"?  Please don't tell me such  find rubs against professional doctrine thus no competent researcher will touch this site.  Hog wash!  There's plenty well funded private research groups...plenty more with sufficient capitol to re-finance the original discoverers; yet, no one has come back...no one has even taken a cursory second look...  ...  ...  ...geeeeeez!  Then again most of th replies seem no more genuine than used car dealership testimonials...no substance...no intelligence...just a bunch of 3rd grade level mentalities parroting "Golly'gee!"
Jeff Bezos!!   U have enough $$$ to finance this and make it an AP documentary!!!
Money is always an issue.  Someone should try to drill and remove a core of several feet into the object and have it analyzed
Right angles are not normally associated with natural shapes. Note the right angles in the cutout.
Has got to be a petrified alien spaceship from another world. Maybe thousands of years ago.
It looks  man-made. Maybe an ancient temple  20.000 years ago 🤔 Who  knows? Or before the last ice age.What ever it is it's special. Where  are the Archeologists/universities the State even? Good luck 👍.
the picture not clear🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 there are many videos like this that are meaningless and real ones just disappear 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
i have a question how deep is the Baltic sea i know it is 450 meters the most! i am wrong ? so what you tell us you have nothing to dive ! you are telling lies in Mediterranean depths reach 5000 meters.........🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sorry Denise, the world is stuffed with knobs, god bless, pal, uk
I think the gentleman is right I see your crash site as well I proposed it was an underwater battle between uso or it took place before the Baltic Sea had any water in it?
Probably taking a year to study the picture was a big mistake. Your 1st object isn't there anymore and that's why we've never heard anything else about it.
Ufo
Han Solo crashed the minellium falcon on earth
Must be the missing Millennium Falcon.
So what's there,???only 300 ft....probably nothing since the army would have investigated
Thank God for Fox News.
People can be so ferocious. Maybe its just jealousy. I enjoyed this video you guys made. It was very interesting. still would like to know what is under the thing  y'all found.
You guys were brave to even dive there whatever it may be or not be this was interesting & scary & I'm here for the next step..To threaten your family is sick of some people...I pray you're all ok & you get the answers you seek..Great work to you all
Without these type of people we would never find the World history thank them for the knowleagde we need to be a süpumentler to Help us better are understanding sø please Help them ķev kev kev kev kev kev kev kev kev kev kev kev kev be Safe my your god go with you kev
This object and the black knight satellite share an uncanny resemblance. 😊
Dear Christine, If you love Forensic Archology let me tell you this. Our planet has more than meets a politicians eye. They know nothing. You do. Go for it.
Question: Why do ships made entirely out of wood sink?
Reminds of the structures off the coast of Japan.
It looks just like The Millennium Falcon  😱
The fact you gets threats says there is much to uncover and much fear of what may be uncovered.  I believe you must go forward with your work. secure you family and move on with your research. " with great risks comes great rewards"
No mystery. It's the Millennium Falcon. You're welcome😊
all possible outcomes are exciting! What about the remains of an ancient civilization? They could have built something out of/aside of a meteorite.
Omg definitely a crash site, damn I wish I had the money to fund this expedition,  it’s clear they have been blocked by someone in charge 100%, some government doesn’t want them finding out what it is.  The 3d image at the end says it all, you can clearly see the trail it’s left behind as it’s come to a stop, not one trail but two…
Giants helmet from before the bible
That's an hour of my life I wont get back again
Maybe they can try to get Robert Bigelow involved. He’s usually willing to fund projects like this if there there is a possibility of UFOs
Couldn't it just be a case of pareidolia?
I enjoyed watching this. Its very interesting material. What a promising imagery at the end. I am amazed
So thats where we parked the millennium falcon
No mystery, it's obvious the Millennium Falcon.
Looks like time travel, well there is a book said to be real that soldiers from our time line went to the past to stop a evil race of annunaki, the weapon of choice, was a type of weapon that can turn things to stone
Were they able to determine it isn't stone?
i think it's an asteroid😊
And it looked, like a yufo.
Clearly it's the millennium falcon... duh.
"just a rock formation". a normal rock formation does not create a clean cut frames. this kind of formation can only be achieve with human intervention like how human created pyramids and ancient structures. this might not be what they're hoping for as a ufo but it could be a sunken ancient structures. perhaps a evidence of a advance ancient civilization before the flood. who knows. we cannot disclosed any theories about it until they have a solid evidence. which is unlikely to happen since they already stop investigating it. most probably because the effort and cost are too high and what they get back from it? ridicule, rumors, news targeting them and making them look bad, and getting threats. so its understandable if they stop pursuing it anymore.
went down there and all they did was take a video of a shape we already know and pick up some rocks?
Ask the American director James Cameron who did work on Titanic. He has the equipment and billions from his new movie hit. He loves ocean expiration.
It’s a rock. One that was probably exposed during an Ice Age and human beings may have carved some things on it. Sorry, Star Wars fans.
Until such time this anomaly has been thoroughly investigated, it’s it’s any one of the three proposed theories. Just know that nothing is beyond the realm of possibility. 🇨🇦
Contact Graham Hancock
Flipping channels, saw your artifact in the Baltic. Had to stop and have a better look. First the ship looks very real. It could have  been there a  million years.  There has been advanced civilization on earth. It was called the Golden Age.     I think I have seen a picture of that ship on the walls of one of the  pyramids. Another thing, if that is real, there is someone who knows it to, and could be trying to discredit you so you will walk away, I have spent a life time (60yrs)  searching,learning ancient history.  You wouldn't believe what's back there.🤔 Not everyone is asleep.😴
So long ago! It was a pile of rocks. They couldn't scavenge anymore money, and gave up.
When you’re over the target. You receive flak. IMO. Threats to one’s family whenever you’re investigating anything. Is usually a sign that someone is getting nervous. Why? All Governments and Academia have a solid history of mocking UFO Research. Even if UFOs aren’t even mentioned. This is a classic case of that. These Treasure Hunters were simply getting a closer look at a very interesting discovery. That’s all. And they were doing so, cautiously, meticulously and scientifically without trying to sensationalize it. But the immediate and merciless response to their discovery is even more mysterious then the object itself.   Who’s nervous about what’s down there and why the threats?
It's easy to see that it's an unusual rock formation.
Any criticism from lieing ratings fraudster FOX is the laughable part. FOX is the JOKE of our time-Not worthy of any credibility least of all criticism. FOX NEWS=THE INQUIRER of this Century.Fox is not news it's entertainment for ratings by defaming credible sources.  Fox should be disbanded and have to pay defamation costs.
I wish the world would donate to get the answers. It's important to get answers.
ocean X team really has to get this search done ! it is the find of a lifetime and it could change so many things in our world, if it is a rock then it is, but what if it isnt ? only way to find out is to get enough money to make this search go to the finish line ! big thumbs up to ocean X team !!
It’s the Millenium Falcon, of course.
Well that an odd thing. Interesting vid TY. It looks to me like the the imaginative speculations of the crew have inspired that small portion of the population that cannot tell the difference between inside their own heads and the world of reality ie  Fox viewers. It does not surprise me that after the phenomenon has been disparaged by Fox its viewers have reacted and been un-pleasent to the team. It is easy to type stuff to people and not realise how hurtful, and threatening, words disembodied from body-language can be- they are like noises in your house in the dark of night- intruder, ghost or cooling down of the property. Fox seems to collect individuals who feel they have a right to be rude,  hostile,  critical even threatening.  I suppose the lesson here is don't speculate that you might have found an alien spacecraft as you will attract cranks and nut-jobs like er, Fox viewers.    It does seem to me that a circle like this at the bottom of the sea is a little odd. It strikes me as man made as opposed to volcanic. The next thing that occurs to me is that if you pour a concrete lid on something it would be because you don't want future people to messing with whatever is underneath. Interesting though. Could this be a World War arms dump  or something even more sinister such a  spent nuke fuel dump?   Good Luck with this project.
What TF is wrong with Faux News? Can anybody tell me? Is profiting from constantly lying about people really worth it?
Drill into it.... saw a chunk off ... it could be done,  we live in a time and have the equipment that we could solve this mystery
Millennium falcon.. duh
GG's
It’s the millennium falcon
Alott of bla bla bla but no real informations......
Let’s call it what it is, it’s a crashed spaceship!!
Thank You  guys for your dedication and time spent trying to unravel this mystery, You need a Billionaire to fund this project. It could be the key to solving many questions. We have!!
So nothing has happened? 1 hour of old news?
actually OceanX Diving team found this about 10 + years ago .. They tried to get the permission for drill the object but swedish government denied it ..
Don't worry I believe it could be something worth researching why not nothing ventured nothing gained,
Is that a Halo helmet?
but we know what it is it's an anchor stone of the ark
Someone wanted to hide the real truth it seems. I wish those guys had completed the task it could have been the biggest thing ever. At least they know in their hearts that they actualy found something. Good on ya guys andthanks for sharing it with us. Gods Speed and Blessings
Proxima apocalypse
That 60meters depth would have been above water during the last glacial period. It could be a sunken structure. Check if old maps and ancient roads run through it!
The Baltic Sea Anomaly shouldn't be given unnecessary hype when the Treasure Hunters simply have a picture of what it forms, the media then strikes them down bringing with it hostile threats which is unfair. The investigation isn't even complete! They must go down and gather more evidence and get a full scan of the anomaly both on the outside and inside. All things must be considered, ruling out those things that don't fit, so that we know what were looking at. It would be unfair to label this a hoax when they never claimed it to be anything other than a mystery. It could be anything at this moment, but lets not forget that whether it be extra-terrestrial or man-made, it's still a piece of of our historical past. So solve it and lets move on to find more anomalies.
Maybe it blew out of a volcanoe that's in the baltic sea and the volcanoe sank and it has been down there not that long
It's obviously the Millennium Falcon. The spirit of Han Solo lives on.
Haters will hate. It looks like a crash site to me.

Possible explanation:  it is volcanic rock that was frozen in a glacier.  A giant piece of the glacier sheared off, as they often do, creating flat surfaces and drifted out to sea until it melted enough to drop the volcanic rock from the iceburg.
I believe they stumbled upon something the local government didn't want them knowing.
It’s been going on for ages  We know it’s a rock formation nothing more
The man made looking object may have been fashioned out of a large meteor used as an entry heat shield for an alien space craft many centuries ago.
Check out the trail of debris left behind the travel path of this object.  It literally went through the mountain top, pushing out a pile of debris on the exit side as it traveled to it's resting place.  If it had been dragged by a glacier  How could it cut a deep channel thru the mountain, while leaving the top unscathed ?  And since when do natural objects have stairs and other  such features ?
It's Sweden's sensible immigration policy. It sunk long ago. No one is ever going to raise that wreck...
They have found the Millenium Falcon!
Unwatchable with all the millisecond flashes of images one after another! This could be very harmful for susceptible people causing seizures.
This is old news! Enough of this Clickbait
Oh my god !  Could it be something un-earthly ? Quickly discredit it !
US might have gone there already, all the reason for the Fox news, to hide the truth
amazing , i think researcher need more budget here to explore more, i believe this is some of the man made structure from ancient civilization that we yet to discover.
I say it is an ancient civilization !
"And it looked, like an oofoe"
I like how the image looks like the millennium falcon from Star Wars
It's just a rock. Someone has got a Vivid imagination.  A little bit of white paint here and  there and it's a UFO. Beam me up Scotty! Image is just a rock Doctor Spock!
Maybe it's a door an entrance
Fox News only show fake news.
Absolutely amazing
La estupidez humana a alto nivel ,rebasa la lógica y trata de alterar como siempre ha sucedido el conocimiento de todo ,dando migajas del mismo al hambriento ser humano de el más alto grado dei saber Universal.Todo está ahí ,bien claro ...pero quienes nos mantienen como borregos son según la lógica aquellos que por milenia nos han embrutecido con ficticias historias envueltas en el velo de lo fantástico.Inclusive hoy en día muchos siguen esos dictámenes aunque de una forma u otra conozcan la verdad.Todo es una farsa controlada pero bien recibida por lis han tenido al ser humano en la más oprobiosa ignorancia.Solo el tiempo lo dirá ,solo el tiempo será testigo de lo que el ser humano logrará : quitarnos ese peso que es la ignorancia y dar merecido tributo a una nueva era de entendimiento Universal.👈
So the Navy knows about this and Hasnt checked it out yet?
What  a shame they lost supporters! I thought mankind had curiosity,   Thirst for knowledge! See what negative media can do. Such a shame!
Fox News is not news. It's more like the National Inquirer. Fake news: They're a joke. Fools! Sorry for your discouragement.
It might be a U.S.O. but not a U.F.O. because it's not flying and this object is settled on the Baltic sea floor ! So what did these sea treasure hunters find ? And also , when you are on a quest to discover something astonishingly mysterious there is no time limitation ; you  take the time to spend the time expedient for this potential remarkable discovery !
Those that have threatened their families are cowards and need mental medication.
TRUE WISDOM IS TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF WHICH YOU DO NOT KNOW.
Nothing more than a rock. Sorry to burst your bubble. Some one claims it was a U Boat trap placed there by the Germans during the war. These guys cooked this story up to pay for their failed expedition. Checked out newer information on YouTube.
I wish the team the best. This was an amazing discovery and I so impressed how you went down with a drone and a dive team, and came back with samples
very good show, well done.
Milinium falcon
So very interesting I hope one day you have the possibility and get the help you need to find out what the anomaly really is! Thank you so much for sharing this awesome discovery with us 🙏🏼😊
This was found years ago....so what is it ? It now 2023
agree, crash site, vessel maybe covered with stone to preserve it. thanks for the documentation, i would love to see progress on it. thanks for sharing
So they found the millenium falcon? :D:D:D:D:D
Has been matched to battleship turret? If not..break out welcome mat…
That's an stapler 🦃
That's millennium Falcon 😂😂
Know where the anomaly was trying to go before it hit the bottom. Then lift it with air the air won't be disturbed by the anomaly if anything strange happens call me. 💜
A turret of some sort, possible particle cannon.
The people at the top are witholding the truth of our real history.
So many adventurers and explorers were meant with scoffing and ignorant people. Don't give up on your dream.
it is most likely an ancient asteroid site from before that area was under water
Awsome adventure.  Hope they, or someone, can take it further.
could they not give the saftey bouy an audible presence,  so they could find in the fog?
just cobalt
clickbait they answer nothing, they collect stuff but didnt analyze it. the stuff is at 75meters, so if its a rock, it was under glacier during glaciation and started to be covered by sea 14.000y ago
Graham Hancock ancient civilisations should take a look..
It’s the Millennium Falcon!
Sad that the media had to spread  false info... its still an unknown.. and should be investigated.
It's the Millennium Falcon😉
The dumbest thing they did was not explore it first before going to the media...waiting a whole dam year. Any government could have gone there in the interim and removed it and put what they found there after the case. Real stupid move on their part.
seen the comments below , I'm out of here!
Looks like a piece of the replicator ship to me. Call sg1
It’s the Millennium Falcon…
That moment at https://youtu.be/ImV8f0pOoXQ?t=50 when the guy says "You-Fo"
1:19 when i heard that, i stopped watching.
This people are genius..  hv Guts👍
The malanium Falken,  could Han Solo , and Cubacca be found in the pilots seat ???
All the ships are made of a type of Chrystal and are alive and they resinate with the pilots  It was a living vessel now dead or can reactivate with the correct DnA
If your time cannot she'd the light of this mystery maybe in the future someone will continue your quest to answer the truth of this mystery object.
Anybody ask Mudfossil?
the fact that they jumped to second anomaly as more interesting before even have any kind of idea about the first one is just a red flag that they are trying to pull out another mysterie if i would be them i would probably not talk public before i get some solid proof or idea of what it is anbd from what it is made of because even if it is asteroid it could contain loads of extra expensive rare elements that could finance their future hunts .
The principle theory is Harmonic-Generation. The "anomaly, sank, singing, Ezekiel 27:25. The harmonics created a self-assembly of immobile ions bound to the subsurface. The "anomaly created the application  of the electrode, and if the created a semicryline structure on the surface untile the surface of the substrate is covered in a monolyer/rock/corral/et. The only way to know is to bore-drill threw the monolayers, and  finding the ?...
I also see a crash site.
yFO
it is a wakanda weapon
Looks like The Millenium Falcon.
It's exactly as the video shows you people but you can't handle the truth you will all get your answers when time is right
And dumb humans still don't see the truth
Millennium Falcon!
Ur works is amazing and the world awaiting for updates of ur team to explore this object. Ur team creating a new legend , Cheer up yah!
A perfect example of an amazing geological mystery that needs to be studied that was tainted by the word "UFO". The moment it was uttered the scientific community backed off and now won't go near it.
elon should fund these guys with bigger robot
Seasoned astronauts, generals and those in the highest form in academia have DIED mysteriously having this kind of discovery. I urged you to beware
Government entity is trying to tell you to stay away from it period. They will do anything to suppress your information on this.
Disinformation by government to subvert opinion on this
Have faith Ocean X . Nothing worth finding ever  was easy to find. It's a valid hunt 🙏  🙏  you will find answers.
They need to drill it and gather core samples. It definitely looks like a crash site. The strewn field shows a clear path. 👌
I do not understand how it can be a sample taken when it's probably just debris settled on top. The fact that it turns black when touched can mean a bacterial reaction. It's megalithic stone work . If it's metal , is it not possible to get a sample?
It's the Millennium Falcon.
An investigative journalist by the name of Graham Hancock would've been a great addition to this team. Due to his knowledge of diving to document ancient underwater monoliths. He would also have a good idea if this area would be connected to or even nearby any ancient civilizations
I think they were intentionally targeted to abandon the project. They people that did that and thinks the have the monopoly of such discoveries, I think might have taken up the project for themselves
I guess gps coordinates must not exist in this part of the world……………
I believe there was a advanced civilization between 10,000-12000 years ago and was destroyed by a meteorite or some natural disaster, pole shifting or magnetic field. Why do ppl think this can't be true that some ppl survived and had to start from scratch. We didn't evolve through apes lol or we came from another planet.
These guys should try contacting Elon Musk to get funding!
Wait...  It COULD be a concrete UFO.  Because that would make sense.  Lol.
Beware!  The Swedish Navy!  Always to be feared...  Hahahaha!
CONGRATULATIONS!  You found rocks!  And...  Spent copious amounts of money doing it!
that navy ship sold the rock story..to the public..1 stone there looked like the residue from an ancient nuclear powered vessel..the stones are either ?like they said fairy rings possibily  caused by electro  magnetism emitting  close by...pulsing ..or placed there by the previous owner pryer death
It's more disappointing the countrymen of these intrepid explorers believed american legacy media propaganda
MAKE ME WONDER..IS IT CURSED??
Was this b4 we had GPS ❓
The "Millenium Falcon"!!!!! That's it!
That's easy that's the millennium falcon
It's our mother ship when we moved here from mars
I think this video is a good piece of work. Do not listen to nay sayers. They probably wish they could do this .
What's wrong  with  that announcement?
Instead of looking at it! Why don’t you find a way inside
It's THE Malinium FALCON FROM THE movie CALLED STARWARS 😅
Ya know what, ill bet money it was made by the same civilization that made yonaguni.
Networks are doing what they are told to... it's all about control of the masses. Possible crash site!
Looks like a rock to me. Clearly a rock that happens to look like the Millennium Falcon, a made up space ship, not real. Imaginations running wild. Star Wars man. A peculiar rock.
Obviously Han crash landed there long, long ago…
its the millenium falcon !!
❤️
We found something in the ocean. It looks like a spaceship. Hmm....It's a rock. .........It must be a rock covering a space ship !!! Hmm.....
It’s still. Mysterious right
FROM THE STAR WARS PROJECT AND GOLIATH 3 AND ALPHA 7 I THANK YOU
PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS STAR WARS PROJECT... IT WAS LIKE THE SPACE SHIP THE MILLENNIUM FALCON BUT IT HAD A STRETCH LIMO PART TO THE BACK WHERE ALL THE HATCHES ON THE TOP WE'RE FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS ..  IT IS LOOKING MORE LIKE A CRASH SITE I GOT TO SEE GOLIATH 3 CRASH... I WON'T FORGET IT LOOK LIKE THE MILLENNIUM FALCON LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE THERE IN THE FRONT BUT THE WHOLE BACK OF IT WAS LIKE A STRETCH LIMO..... I WAS MADE DURING THE SHUTTLE PROJECTS.....  YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES THE STEEL THAT COMES DOWN FROM SPACE IS ALL RADIOACTIVE AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN TELL IT CAME FROM SPACE....  I WISH YOU LUCK AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SHOW I WATCH IT A FEW TIMES AND SHARE WITH MY FRIENDS JUST SO IT MAY HELP YOU FOLKS
We r just brainless earthworms around this cosmos, there r billions of more habitable xo plantes out there n there suns r m type , we r not intelligent race , we r type o civilization.
Million years before nature covered it n preserved it , it's a crash👍
That's probably Empire.. let the Mandalorians deal with it
Elon Musk.  Space X help Ocean X Please n thank you.   Bezos? Dorsey? Zuckerberg? Joe Rogan? . Any others interested.  Whoop whoop.
my name is Smelma Enus not a Treasure hunter,  have been described as an anomaly, psychologically marring, and other praises.  T&M no no no... you need more T&A , Make it real sexy.
Does anyone know if they ever found out what it is or of the government killed or jailed them?? Happens more then you know MO usually suicide.
It’s obviously the millennium falcon
OMG, this is so 5 minutes ago
It's the Mellenium Falcon
TL;DR There's something underwater in the Baltic Sea and they don't know what it is but it's likely rocks. @56:00 For the final scans.
I’ll be starting my sentences in one location…..  And finishing them in another…!
This man knows he needs to finish this investigation for the good.
It’s a Covenant Plasma Pistol. Most commonly used by Grunts.
And there it is, I just wasted an hour plus of my time washing this nonsense. I knew it was only going to be rocks. This is just as bad as the history channel.
Still no explanation of what it is. Too much explanation of nothing.
Never ending stories get boring and uninteresting after a while!
Quit speculating and find the Truth!
I have had a lot of people threaten me. I think its cute. And wish them well on it. I'm still alive and kicking.
This presentation needs to show actual pictures of this object in order to convince me.
I truly believe that you have found a crash sight. I wonder if the government has ruled something else. It would be great if you had the funds to continue. I think that this is more  than  what a lot of people think. Can’t you do a “ go fund me”? That would be fantastic!!! Please let people know if you are going further with this.
I already watched this video on other youtube channel, i hope this video already have the result. Or they just uploaded the video here... So sad.
This blows.
They found the Millennium Falcon💀
Why don't they pull the thing up?
This show how the ignorance of the People destroy a research. This structure May be an ancient structure.
Millennium falcon?
👍
ONE HOUR WASTED NOT EVEN ONE PICTURE OF THIS STUPID ROCK... WTF
Couldn't they get funding through some University? If the geologists and marine researchers are interested in it too.
Seems almost like a cover up to me. Under water treasure hunters find a weird object under water. News interviews at the dock. Military vessels shadowing them. That arent supposed to be there. Threats saying to stop diving before a diving accident happens. Then threathening his kids. Then publicly shaming and making him sound crazy. I mean its suspicous to say the least.
what a joke you mean to tell me that they didnt have simple gps position  Sorry this is silly
Looking for investors, present this to Brandon Fugal. He is a serious person that should take a look at this possible investment.
If it came in melting hot and hit the ocean what would that do to the thingy
Stay curious guys because nothing ventured nothing gained. Stay safe❤
Wow that's amazing!
Looks like the millenium falcon….
Billy Carson spaceship under the sphinx paw looks just like that
Hang in there!!! Fox news is the most ridiculous news nerwork in the world!!! I laugh at them on the daily!!!
1 hour lost
It seems to me your research is being hindered intentionally in order to prevent you from accurately identifying the unknown object. But why?
i like how they used Majora's Mask music in the background
Belt buckle from a giant nephilum
Bottom of Glacier meets molten rock. Instantly takes on Glacier bottoms patterns?
It's rock.
Never Give Up! Do not have much, a few USD for the go forward.  GKlein
A sacrifice alter that was banned when the civilization became aware . It was taken miles into the ocean and disposed of .
It's the top of a pyramid
Uhmmm millennium falcon?
So let me get this straight, It could be a giant chunk and a smaller chunk of volcanic rock That landed here and then dragged across the Baltic sea floor by glaciers giving the sea bed the drag marks and it's unique shape with 90 degree angles? Wouldn't the rock have to be soft for those kinds of marks to form naturally? Or do you think there was a time when the Baltic sea floor was exposed dry land and humans could have carved these shapes into it? Very strange anomaly indeed and it definitely looks like the millennium falcon. I don't think a meteorite would land in this shape. Another theory I have is that quite possibly it could be an an ancient tree stump but that wouldn't explain the drag marks unless they petrude like roots.
They absolutely need to go on Joe Rogans podcast with this. I bet Elon Musk would endorse this- Ocean X is even the name of their company, ironically enough.
Crash site of a meteor most likely. where's the rest of the scree field from a glacier? Hot meteor hits an island and cools rapidly  makes more sense.
I don’t think anyone w any amount of intelligence thinks this was/is nor you all & your expedition is a hoax. Especially now! This is an incredible discovery & it’s a shame it takes so much money. I hope you get the funds. It’s important. Chins up! Best of Luck. ❤
That's no moon....it's a Millennium Falcon!
And in a turn of events that surprised absolutely no one: Fox News ruins everything.
Leave my ship alone
Looks like an early Zat'nik'tel. Come on syfy brothers an sisters.. 🤓 Can I get a woot, woot?
That thing looks exactly like my boys toy. It's the same size as my hand. The bait my have made it look big by just taking a pix over it and a little editing around it. It's a toy that's all.  It's best to not believe in 90 percent of what you see and hear, just believe in yourself.
oumuamua is an interstellar spaceship that also looked like giant long rock or cigar shape. I remember ufo documentaries always mention cigar shape ufo. If this Baltic ufo is made of rock. Then its for sure its from outer space. Look at all the ancient buildings where there is no space between the rock lines.
Loved this documentary, I believe in your work , an keep going guys , good luck an be safe , we look forward to your findings , I can’t help but wonder as you do , an when u ready to go back , go Boldly!! Don’t let the negativity of others influence your choices an your plans , this object an it’s surroundings, this is very interesting an we as a people would like to keep going with you on this discovery ,  hold your head up high an god bless your work , stay safe divers an crew , all of you I can’t wait to see what you find out bout this , see ya soon , I’ll be lookn for an uodate
a large zatnikatel gun
It's the first Micky D's. I saw the arches!
Wouldn't this object have been on dry land before the sea waters rise of 400 foot
I always thought that since  the earth is covered with three quarters of water chances are extremely  good that crashed ufo's would lay somewhere down at the bottom.
How deep was the Black Sea during the Younger Dryas?

George Lucas sitting back and laughing as they find the Millenium Falcon
Saw this when it first came out years ago no answers then no answers now
Millenium Falcon!
Such bs
War in heaven  Satan cast down to earth. Revelations last book in the Bible.
It was destroy by the flood
That object is part of an  ancient city
UFO/USO 90% corect !
Looks like an altar, I see steps.
Lol I remember people saying it's the millennium falcon
the moment in when the ship was sitting close to them, they were releasing frog men  on the other side into the ocean that had equipment to help them get to the other ship unseen in and out and on the takeoff, the cable was set up to be lost but these men had gadgets of their own and the media was made to bring him down for his find to take his will and ability to find anything.
This was absolutely amazing! These guys are  real deal explorers for doing this. I hope they get to go back or get some more funding to find out more.
What a bummer! We get fatigued by those empty boid long time consuming pseudo documentaries. This is fake
Last five ish minutes prove it is something the cowardly c*nts in the gooberment want to hide
Go back and find out
I wish we would spend more time figuring out stuff like this and less time waging wars... Very sad waist of humanity
It kinda looks like the things NASA Astronauts recorded a while ago with the same kind of shape U F O floating around near their spaceship. I doubt it a ufo cause it's never aliens
its not a sucken object the professional's say its actually rock believe it or not ok
Ok, where's Part 2?  I wanna go back and find out what it is!
A UFO? More like a USO Unidentified Sunken Object
I’m sorry that people turn stupid. Fox News should have shut they’re ignorant mouths. I wonder is someone else looked and wanted to hog it to themselves
that is nothing but  rock formation
It's the Millennium Falcon!
Go Fund me? !
They found the millennium falcon!
It is Han solos space ship.
This was very very interesting, and I’m sorry that you had all these non-believers and haters threatening you and your families. I believe in your work and I wish that you could find someone to invest and go back and do some more discovering my thoughts. Prayers and wishes go with you.
Its terrible to see how despicably these men were received by the skeptics. My heart goes out to all  the intrepid members of the team. The only thing I know to do is to remind them, "you know the truth of what happened!" There are many who do believe you. Karma will out, eventually. Be strong in yourselves, and may God bless you in all your future endeavors.
All these shows are the same. No anawers. Grey results and build up with massive let downs. Basicly put out to get people interested in something where there is nothing really special as a story. They started their " treasure hunt " by renting a boat. THEY WERE TREASURE HUNTERS THAT DIDNT OWN A FREAKEN BOAT.... its like a big game hunter who doesnt own a gun.  FAKE FAKE FAKE.
I think it's just a rock formation made back when the land was separating into the continents we have today.
Just to let you and everyone know that U.F.O. is an abbreviation of Unidentified Flying Object and the abbreviation is not pronounced as UFOE, each letter is spoken as U.F.O. because it is an abbreviation not a word.
We may be looking at a Doggerland artifact. The threats indicate they found someone's secret.
typical. shame the pathfinders dont let the masses know
Ever heard of pareidolia??  This is most likely a pile of rocks that kinda looks like the millennium falcon.. now what would be the chances of it actually being a millennium falcon??? About a million trillion to one... chance of a pill of rocks?? Evens all day
fascinating.  thank u

its very well identified? its the millennial falcon? DAAAAA
what if ........what if............. get the answers or shutup.
Its a UFO for sure, and just like other videos have claimed a UFO is bigger then an aircraft carrier,at 1.5km long this thing fits the bill!!!
He's not crazy. It is a crash site. Might be of an meteor but it definitely is a crash site or traces left by a moving glacier. But that seems unlikely to me. It would have need to have stopped all of a sudden. And left that shape and those traces, very locally. Which seems more weird to me than it being a crash site of some sort.
Why is the meta everything like the history channel. Wtf
I really believe that there is something to this anomaly. If it is not a space ship it very well could be something even more surprising. Two objects with trails behind them at that depth is statistically surprising to say the least. What are they ? Who made them ? How did they get there ? These questions remain to be answered and these guys are the right ones to answer those questions, given the money and the time. Undersea anomalies are being found around the world and recieve much funding yet these objects surpass most of these other anomalies. It is as if someone does not want these questions answered. I for one would like to see some answers and surely someone is wealthy enough to help these guys out. There would be an incredible amount of benefit and rewards for a wealthy investor, at least in my opinion. A lot of money is wasted on scientific research for cures that will never come to fruition yet here we have definitive evidence before our very eyes of something that could have the potential to revise world history with knowledge left to our posterity. If you are wealthy and reading this, do something worthwhile with these guys, even get some of your friends together to help finance the operation if you can't do it alone !
Millenium falcon?
It's clearly a YT-1300...
Woow Spaceship Milenium Falcon StarWars
Dive there again 👍🙂
Yes,you go boy's 😜
Interesting. There are probably about 100,000 different things it could be, the vast majority of which would be naturally occurring. Changing sea levels have occurred throughout the history of the planet so it’s possible that it might be a geological formation that was formed on the surface and then submerged when the climate changed and waters rose. But of course the first thing people would jump to is either spaceships or boogeymen.
Yah! Me too it's look like a crash site of spaceship if I'm correct
I love the end. Can meteorites make lava piles? Maybe the underwater mountain had people living there at the time of the creation of the structure that could prove the discovery of a society that is buried by sediment like Pompeii.
Carbon date the sample. Maybe if it is made of lava, then it maybe landed at a community carved stone stairway to the ocean tidepools then cooled in a circular pile and turned upside down and out to sea by some freak storm.
"We only have more questions." = We need more money to live on. Gotta wring this made-up mystery out for all it's worth. Season 8 - "So many nagging questions!" - They start resorting to flashing cut-scenes of 1/10th of a second hinted trauma and implied danger. Shots of people screaming. With all the nervous exciting loud music and sound effects. Repeating the last hour of video every time it returns from what it intended to be commercial breaks.
Wishing obstacles be removed to you. If money weren't limited, would you have more radar devices and divers even supply ships to save time returning back to shore?
The visible remains of a lost Civilisation? Swallowed by time or cataclysm, perhaps. Or a Prehistoric settlement or stone circle...Not everything is Alien. However, I believe UFO's use the Oceans and Lakes to travel, conceal themselves and use the water as an energy source.
Maybe the structure was a mold for space metal to be cooled by the ocean quickly
It has been said by archeological society; global sea level have risen 400 feet in the last 12K years. This means this ship hit the ground and skidded to where it is now on dry land. 👍🏽👍🏽💯💯
Ini musuh kau Engel ..tak kira kau warna apa pun Engel...manusia mati balik Syuga dan Neraka..hanya ini tempat terakhir.manusia.
Did you ever carbondate the rock taken from the site?
This could honestly be the ark of humanity "meaning the bacteria needed to create us or maybe something else entirely" brought to this planet looking at the mountain being split it was obviously on a landing trajectory to what would have been a smooth surface from the water right or soft ice surface, sediment could turn to stone on a hot object rapidly like say from reentry especially, heat being the catalyst especially  if this was from maybe lightspeed travel and rapidly cooling /slowing down. its impossible to know without a core really just need a jack hammer to get to the bottom of it. if it is a meteor it would be worth alot of money. like alot.
The end is particularly interesting.  Looking forward to the next expedition.
If they had the coordinates for the object from the first time, why do they need to search for it again? Also, why not examine it more thoroughly with the ROV and not risk people?🤔
A sonic weapon could theoreticaly turn things to stone?
its the Millennium Falcon
Right out of star trek 2
"In a galaxy far far away"
I have a wild sugestion about this craft and all other so called stone flying craft like virmana. Could they be craft in themselves and the operation of it all is done in syncronised shifted dimentions. The operation of which is done psycically. We have lost the knowlage about how to change our vibration at will. We've been tricked to look outwardlly seeking something that is just behind the next click of the mouse, and we all think we're doing all this media stuff. When were away for any time we have a strainge sence that we've missed something, and so on it goes. We are not in control. The scary thing is we've also forgoten where and who we were when it took over. Once you seeeee iiitt you cant unsee it unless you fall assleep again.  Just saying.      Once mastered you have to renew with gratitude for the vision of forsight. peace and love folks peace and love.
Airbag it and bring it up
I love that.  They bring up rocks, and test them.  They conclude there is a crust of volcanic rock hiding the millennium falcon.
god  there is  some bloody cranks about on the internet sending malicious rumors and threats about
If it is something for real the power in charge would not let them tell so.   They are smart to stop. °so sad cause it sure would be cool to know what it is❤
What evil is out there to threaten loving babies.    That tells me you have truly found something that certain types don’t wan you to bring out the truth.   May God bless and protect you from the evil in our world .
Please don’t listen to the naysayers! Follow your intention and I think someday someone will find the facts for every one.  Thank you😊
As do I if I had the money we would raise this cfaft
People suck... Especially when they try to discredit good people when they're trying to do good things.
Go fund me . Try this Dennis and Tony .
Sunken beneath Baltic Sea is no meteor but i think a Ancient ET crashed UFO aka USO 🛸 aka Space craft coz its has huge skid line trail behind the object. We are not alone in the Universe.
THE interesting twist comes from watching the whole damn video ,then they put the most interesting thing in the last part,the twin peak small mountain,to me,it looks like a crash site,too,at 180 feet wide,that is a large space vessel,like when the enterprise went down in the movie,it took it a while to settle,and then there's the burnt up carbon rock,that's damn exciting,i like mysteries,strange world,plus it might be a destination world,explain a lot
Looks like you need some backers with deep pockets? I know a guy....
I would love to interview you on my pod cast
It really does look like a crash site and ship
Thank you for doing what you did. That square with the circle in it definitely raised my eye brows
Looks like the millennium falcon to me.
"Discovered an object no one could identify." Me, one second after seeing it, "Uh. Its the Millennium Falcon. Where's my federal grant money?!"
The millennium falcon
Could you use an underwater bell then the divers work out of it and do not need to keep surfacing?
Why need 1 sq mile search? Did they not use GPS on previous visit? Only 300 feet down. They could position themselves directly over it with GPS.
Odd place to scupper the Millennium Falcon.
Oh goodie! Another "Oak island-esque" mystery. Have to love these little docu-dramas designed to capture the audience, for commercial purposes, but never conclusively prove anything.
Hey guys, this is a crash site plain and simple. I scratch my head at why it is so difficult for so many people to believe what they see, but whatever the case, please don't give up on this, or on your drive to solve this mystery. And most of all, don't allow the opinions of fools to discourage your perspective. It seems very likely to me that these two anomalies are not the results of natural phenomenon, and I am definitely not a magical thinker. Sadly most people in this world are asleep, and afraid, unable to venture beyond the familiar and comfortable boundaries of fixed beliefs and content living that way. I sincerely hope you continue your ongoing efforts to figure this out because it would truly be another sad chapter in the pantheon of human ignorance if you were somehow unable to continue the journey.
It seriously looks like the Millennium falcon
Anyone else see another anomaly about 80 meters directly to the right of the original? It's faint but looks to be a mirror copy of the 1st anomaly.
You guys are Heroes! Soldiers!  Grateful for the curiosity throughtout the process! In Asian youtuber also talked about OceanX this project! Hope you guys can finally have government or some countries to support your finding!
I swear to god they used a Bionicle part for the thumbnail
dude! They found the Millenium Falcon!
Hey guys, I saw that about 8 years ago on Goggle earth. I also thought it was a crashed ufo. Or maybe a warship stage for a stand for sacrifices. I honestly believed it to be a space craft. Wierd Goggle earth doesn't show it anymore.  It is blocked out. Just so you know I believe in you guys.
-Shades of the movie: "OUTLANDER" eh?...;) -Dont want your phones being tracked, turn off, wrap in foil n' toss 'em in the nearest microwave to sit until needed....  -Funny how its BIG news, then as for MSM Standard Operationl Protocols, the coveraage DROPS-DEAD, with the MSM, Concerned parties, TPTB are like:   "Its NOTHING, just a simple under-sea ROCK formation, Silly Conspiracy Theorists! -No doubt inspired by binge watching FAR too many episodes n' seasons of AncientAliens! You've wasted your money on a FAILED fishing expedition!"....   -THEN, U.S-U.N-NATO naval Vessels, planes & Helochopters from ALL the surrounding countries military branches take sudden special interest in  buncha "Loonies" when on-site investigating the anomaly & "BIG Nothing!?"...;) -Then come the hang-up/warning phone calls in the middle of the night, when crew is back dirtside... -Then the legions of Vatican, S.M.O.M/Knight Of St. John, Govt(s) Security Service Goons & DarkCabal Organized Harassment/Ganstalking perps begin trailing ya in earnest as if your very own shadow!-(And all thats without one being aware of the plethora of cloaked/invisible off-planet/E.T curiosity seekers interested in what ya may be doing?!;)-

00:49  What is a “you-foe”?  U.F.O. (or UFO) is never pronounced as “you-foe”; it’s alway just the individual names of the letters “U”, “F”, and “O”.   Only in the case of the words “ufologist” and “ufology” is there a change in the “ufo” part of the terms, such as:  Ufology (/juːˈfɒlədʒi/ yoo-FOL-ə-jee).
I truly believe now keep a opened mind look at mars there was a a disaster on that planet at one point in time they found some anomalies on that planet as well and it could be that this anomaly could be people or something from Mars that escaped that planet and crash landed on earth thousands maybe 1 million years ago who knows but it’s definitely a great find and I think truly they need to investigate this more to see what’s going on because even the Navy is putting videos out there a flying objects I look like upside down pyramids
Has radiation dection equiptment been used there?
The Millenium Falcon?!?!
MELCHIZEDEK  MEL= Black CHI=Energy,Chakraborty ZEDEK=Righteous, justice Green Comet maybe a sign of the emergence of the Mystical school of Kalachakra teachings the green Tara idk just brainstorming.Isnt Osiris depicted as green? The Emerald Tablets of Tehuti( Thoth),,1969 /1970 green Comet Bennett.
Rem
Its obviously the Millenneum Falcon
Millennium Falcon.
ITS HANSOLO'S CRAFT....
I'm glad I skipped to the end...
"Millenium Hawk" - the Mankind want an UFO - now they have one. YES, it is a Crashsite for Future Generations to discover with more Equipment and money.
If it is a crashed ufo, the article by fox news makes perfect sense to get peoples attention turned off. Nothing to see here guys. Please keep investigating.
Millennium falcon that is mate
so why no quatar invest in this they only buy football clubs and no contribute to history
To me, it is obvious that the object is a fragmrntary ancient construction from the Antediluvian world
Ancient crashed Millennium Falcon.
It's Millenium Falcon 100%, we should look for Chewbacca
Maybe you could ask the SOBs Schwab or Soros for some money!!  lol!!
Modern day Vikings!
it is the Millennium Falcon!
It's the Milinium Falcon
Why there is no some wierd billionare who sponsor them? 1M is nothing for that rich person and what they can find might change the history of the WORLD.
Take heart  we look forward to future episodes
It is more than Rocks, till more exploration is done it will remain a mystery. A disinformation campaign like what has happened would leave one to believe there is more to the story. I hope they get the support to lead another exploration and find an answer, whether it be rocks, ancient structures, or other, then the chapter can be closed.
ridiculous documentary. seen full doc  but still nothing conclusive...
Gotta love fox news putting their two cents into everything and so many people taking the people writing for them as fact without letting the professionals discover what the real facts are proventing any progress. It's crazy the influence that company has even outside of the united states. The second I saw where the article came from I had to keep my eyes from rolling out my head. No matter what the outcome could of been Fox news loves to shove what they believe into everyone's throat. The legit made things harder for this crew to be able to find out what the object was under the ocean. It legit could of just been magma but with them telling everyone it was a rock before the professional analysis they are just taking the opportunity away from scientists and other professionals to find out on their own.
Looks like a Dolmen. When was the last time that area was above the sea level?
No it's not the mulinium falcon it's pack man ,
Gotta love it when someone takes an acronym and tries to pronounce it like it's a single word. I wonder if the narrator actually knows what UFO stands for, I'm not sticking around to find out
I think that you guys need to get as many eyes on this thing as possible. This thing looks like a craft of some kind to me.
If it were a UFO, you wouldn't have heard about it here.
I think it's something ancient, maybe a fragment of some larger construction. Did they say the object itself could've been brought there by  glaciers, or just the volcanic rock they found on top of it? There are places where giant boulders have been deposited hundreds of miles away after violently being blown out of the ground from ancient water eruptions. Maybe that's how the object got to the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."  Matthew 7:7
sounds like some gov or agency knows what this thing is and spread disinformation to throw these people off the trail...
I  remember the first time I saw this.   I am still so intrigued.  How can some people react like they have. We need to find out what caused this. I hope these professionals are still doing great things. Whether on this project or something else. I send love and good wishes to them.
Send this video to Elon and hope he wants to find out what it is. All thats needed is a core sample.
It's a massive tree stump
Duh... its the falcon 💁‍♂️
Okay since no one else will say it I will it's the millennium falcon last seen with Chewbacca after they froze Hans Solo.😂🤣
The Baltic sea, is full of mysteries,that was where the scientists discovered a real life mermaid, and this thing that looks like a downed UFO.
Maybe theese tic tac craft are looking in the wrong place ??? Saying as their seen over seas alot just a thought not saying that's what their doing but maybe they leave no one behind.
That sure looks like a wreck of a craft after looking at the 2D picture. Have you ever thought of opening a Go fund me page? You may get help with financing your exploration. I wish you and your team all the luck brother, God's speed! Be Safe.
It's the Millennium Falcon
A man made structure (mainly carved, mainly rock - with embellishments) either taken into the sea by Glacier, Lavaflow, Flood etc. Or simply former coastline/land now under water - after thousands of years? Boom.
Please With objectivity compare the topside view of the unidentified object in question to the Legacy Star Wars Millennium Falcon. Spot any suspicious similarities?...
Sir why not consider go to China branch of science to finance further exploration without Western press, CNN etc biases
Monopoly
I thought it said 28th June 2011
One thing for sure comrade,you'll never stop thinking about it. Like your father before you,you are a treasure hunter. 🛸 Seek and ye shall find,nothing is hidden,that shall not be revealed brothers.
Came from a Facebook video, I thought I’d have an answer after watching but nope 😅 oh well…But Wow can’t believe how this ended though! Both about how they were treated but also the images they finally were able to see.
alien make me dream come true and take me away
Keep working guys for me looks like an UFO, you can do it, I wish you luck, KEEP GOING DON'T PAY ATTENTION WHAT OTHERS SAY,  GOD BLESS YOU.   : )
Uhhh.... Its the drain plug for the Baltic sea. Haven't they ever seen "Drain the Oceans" on  the History channel?
a huge waste of time and money
This should be titled, "The Mystery Beneath in which we will shed not even an infinitesimal degree of insight on".
It happened in 2012. No news so far?
I am like thses guys and want to know more about this underwater  anomaly. Looking foward to finding out if trench that splits the underwater mountain is part of a glide path of a metor or somesort of alien craft.
Why not use a diving bell? If everyone who watched this video sent 10 euro`s into the project, the item would be on the boat. I`d donate just to know
Just think what you would find if we drained the oceans from sea to shining sea and then take images and put the water back it would probably be the end of mankind
Obviously  to me at least  It was a carved Alter.    Produced  Before the great flood  before the Baltic was created.    An event took place that held high importance to the humans of the time.    The various levels and display areas show a type of cast system  The rock ring gives it away     The on deck circle     So 12000 or 20000  Flooding  evidence in other areas give the age of the Baltic.     Another thing to consider is it’s relative altitude  when compared to the lowest point in the Baltic     It May sit on a rise  that was a swamp
this video is like 10 years old, could have started go fund me page and collect the money
They dove on it, it's a natural rock formation...
And you think we are not controlled by the media...open your eyes
Before you watxh... Let me save your time... Its not u.f.o...  After spending millions and millions.. They have no clue.
Non arrendetevi ! Never give up!
Crazy it looks like the Millennium Falcon 😮
What sick people would threaten these men and their families? Sickening.
Uhm... well, the Millenium Falcon? Or an Imperial Star Destroyer upside down if it's that big?... Or getting more down to earth, a very ancient quarry.
Now you modern women understand why the vast majority of men like inexperienced women. There's no fun exploring where everyone has been before. Simple really. 😉
Han solo merchant space ship
God i love this S!%t
I... don't really believe there are aliens out there but this video proves that mankind is far, faaaar from being evolved enough to find out the truth.
I see a possible Oak Island tactic here
Looks like a rock formation to me, shaped by currents
“It looked like a YOU-FO.”
I can tell by the shape that it's obviously the Millennium Falcon. Where's the confusion?
Looks like the millennium falcon
I’m sorry people are so mean. I believe in your project
This was a piece of concrete that served as basement for a radio tower, it got stuck in the icepak and when that piece of glacier broke of the coast it did float away and then sunk, and it lookdd as a foreign office
We really don't have all the answers about everything, every discovery  this planet earth is showing us ...but only  one thing is certain ''LIFE STARTS WITH GOD  AND ENDS IN JESUS'' Thank You Timeline and   Treasure hunters for sharing.
What about the skidded impact trail???
Meeting your kids at the kindergarten sounds like a threat!!! I'd get in with Roger @Mudfossill University; seems like he's going through a similar situation!!! Good luck guys, you rock and don't be so disappointed, you still have your fans; this is very fascinating!!! I've not had TV for 13yrs....
It only takes time and $... I theorize it is a metallic meteor that smacked the Sea and flattened and skidded to the bottom. Erosion and particle sea mud looked like cement and that's why it turned darker by physical influence.
What does it's material composition and analysis say? 👹👹👹
It could be upside down!
You could cut a few of those commercials out.... I wouldn't loose interest.
if it wasn't nothing important or if it was just volcanic anomaly why would someone send death threats make a remarks toward his little ones do the math . That's the elite trying to keep a lid on, trying to discourage them from going any further yeah that's a ship extraterrestrial origin,Man that last part of the 3D lidar  flippin amazing gave me chills that is most definitely a crash site!!!!  Absolutely true
it's an old world melted sunken structure
Master Chief's helmet?
Looks like the millennium Falcon!
How awesome was that?!?! No, it wasn’t! Just like a Jeremy Corbell “doco”. A waste of time. Maybe that’s the point. Psshh.
How do you think the Vikings conquest took over so much.
Anything from Fox news is likely to be propaganda. These guys are brave.There are those of us with open minds and others who don't want us to know more about our planet.I hope one day,these men can find a solution to the anomaly.
Some one please grant me way to my space ship !..its bin calling to me i have bin calling for it
to whom it concerns/FYI; 1. there are alot of deleted videos regarding this anomaly some copyright reasons others seemingly arbitrary,  2. electronic malfunction was the original reason it was discovered not SONAR of any sort 3. there are writings/markings/glyphs, pictograms on it 4. the original non-edited commercial videos are not available, not like normal editing but they keep cutting out the part WHERE THE SCIENTIST say things indicating it is as likely to be a rock as the pyramids are to be tombs, i.e. only in the minds of naive, cancerous europeans.
Inilah pesawat Alien yang sangat nyata  jatuh dari luar angkasa membuktikan mereka memang benar ada, seperti bulan yang menyimpan misterius dengan keberadaan Alien beserta jutaan galaxi dan milyaran bintang❤👽
Even if it is a volcano it still needs to be looked at especially in the Baltic were there is none
Fascinating and Worth exploring
Looks like one of those ships on STAR WARS TO ME!!
PEOPLE WHO VALUE THE MONEY THAT THEY GET FROM PROMOTING RELIGEON FEAR THESE THINGS! MOST PEOPLE OF FAITH HAVE ROOM FOR SCIENCE BUT MONEY GRUBBING PROMOTERS OF FALSE FAITH FEAR IT!  SAD 😪🥱😠
IM SURE you have tried hooking up withguys like james cameron. maybe he'll hook you guys up. Its definatly a great movie possibility. He just might get turned on...
That thing down there is sponge Bob work place krustycrab which Mr crab own the place Patrick also a regular customer
after all that they have no plans to go back, was looking forward to this until i realised it was a whole load of nothing
It looks like the Millennium Falcon !! 😂😂😂😂
It’s probably from an ancient civilisation. It could be a representation of a flying disc. The weirdest thing is, it’s exactly the same shape as the millennium falcon.
It’s strange how the News Media suddenly turned against the project and made it a joke on the internet, just as certain people wanted?.
Well. I hope they get back down there and get to the bottom of it either way. Very interesting.
too bad you got stuck here and lost so much money...your family is also threatened...damn !I looked very carefully...for me it's not just a rock, it's something made by someone ,but what it is and how it got there it's still a mystery. I wish you the best !
They need support. If they're using like James Cameron when they searched for the Titanic, then it would have clear result.
The picture in the thumbnail looks like Master Chief’s helmet from Halo!
How media destroy project... and truth win in the end.. Thts the title
It looks like Han Solos Millennium Falcon!!!❤❤❤
Looks like the Ebon Hawk from Knights of the Old Republic
Its the Millenium Falcon.
It saddens me to think that the occupants may not have survived. I hope they were able to send a distress call before the crash.
It's a millineum falcon
What nonsense.
So you made a documentary about your completely failed, overhyped mission, to recover your costs??
It’s a rock. People have surveyed it.
A part of a very ancient space shuttle
It was a landing pad for spacecraft. There are stair's
What are the credentils needed to be a  ' TREASURE HUNTER ' Why just the other day,  I fund my neighbors blue sock,  which had blown into my back yard while drying.   Am I now accreited ?
they found a rock....hope is saves someone 45 mins
DENNIS,  I WOULD NOT WANT YOU AS MY DIVING BUDDY !
How frustrating for this team. They'd probably do better using all remote vehicles to clean it off and grab some samples. This is fascinating! I agree, it looks like a crash site. That new object with the tail looks like it may have broken off of the larger one. Is the object large enough to have been manned?
Literally almost every early 2000s discovery Channel documentary
6,000 dives of "importance,"  and this is All you have to show for it ?
The biggest problem I have with this is that they never mention the Millennium Falcon. We all know that the Millennium Falcon is a fictional ship in a fictional movie. That being said, anyone who does not see the resemblance is an idiot.
mullion falcon
Anyone know yet?
The Millennium Falcon
when they started to get flack from the media, it was obvious something or someone was paying to destroy this explorers, as we humans do not have the right to make discovery anymore...   i can not stand world news organizations especially in the us.
This is a landing strip.■□♤●○
The falcon
I think if you've got a fair mind that you will look at this situation and say you know the really hasn't been enough Research into this for us to come clusive lycee what it is or what it is not. Even the divers that went right to it only could see a couple of feet in front of them at any given time and were only able to spend like 10 minutes there. Images of long just don't tell the tale
The simple fact is that no one knows what the anomaly is. Just because some skeptic with a degree says it's rocks don't make it so. I commend those gentlemen for having an open mind and pursuing this project with faith and passion to unveil what could be the greatest discovery of mankind.
How cool thanks for never giving up on the quest for answers!
It has been a decade, with all of the advancement of civilization sonar technology, I could only hope more is revealed about the object and object anomalies like this.
this how human treat each other stupid and so very silly we are sad
Clearly, it's the Millennium Falcon.
Its a large rock formation
if an object, of extremely high temperature, maybe friction from an atmosperic decent, had debris, dust / sediment covering it, would that material then vulcanise, almost like a shell?
28:23
That 3d scan at the end looks like a ziggurat.
Next time you nip down there take a metal detector with you:-)
I was thinking it could be a lava column with the top scraped by glacial ice but then I saw the last bit of evidence???? WTF
I agree with the crash site theory it seems as though the impact happened before the Baltic sea was There it looks as though whatever collided a portion of it broke off and slid off to the si'd it's a very unique story and a story that we have of something that happened long before which brings many different theories thought processes And hypothetical endings It will be fascinating to see what is actually found This is an excellent documentary and well done
HH do videos on HIDDEN HISTORY not the garbage we are  told is history. That’s the thing I’ve noticed about mainstream history channels they all do the same events. Either WWII, “concentration” camps, Napoleon, Roman Empire, etc… but never the fact that King Arthur died in what is now known as Kentucky which wouldn’t fit into the 1492 narrative, Tartarian “Empire”, Khazars(very evil ppl)& their empire, The Worldwide Mud Floods, The 1,660 StarForts that are also WORLDWIDE, maps detailing cities in Antarctica, I could go on forever! The narrative we are taught is only meant to divide us & to keep hating, Germans, whites, blacks, brown, Catholic, Protestants, Jews, & others. Do people not notice this? Surely, I’m not the only one?! They have us so dropped up w/ so many things we are too passive! What a shame.
Howdy. All I write is free. Brrr. Come along.
It's the lost wheel keeping the earth's axles turning? It's possible don't you think, we are slightly of course.
It's obviously the Millenium Falcon....easy
Ufo..period....UFO crashed...
We believe u guys the higher guys just going over your heads knowing u found something bet they've been down there right after they discredited u guys
Why would people threaten this team of expert Underwater explorer’s. I hope they get what they need to bring this thing up, because it’s the challenge of it…good luck Peter & Crew
"" I FOUND ONE IN AUSTRALIA "" identical.
The real object is deeper. What we see is only a cup made of rock taken from the hill before- look54.54
I wonder if they've asked for funding from the government?
Has any mystery ever been solved by Timeline?
Read the other comments and found what I needed to know.  Apparently, there is nothing much here to see that's of any real interest.  They will most certainly drag this out for an eternity making a soap opera out of it.  I'm only interested in knowing what it is.  I'll check back next year.  Everyone else have fun.
Good evening everyone, this is a annunaki scout ship,it was hit by a petrified laser technology by united states military complex,think people, love you all.
low minded humans are never part of evolution. Only the real explorers  are the back bone of evolution.
smokin too much pot this lot
It's an artifact from the first civilisation before the big melt, a comet hit the earth causing North America's massive lakes held back by ice dams to let go, it caused the Bosphorus landbridge to collapse allowing salt water to fill the black sea which was previously a freshwater lake, such was the velocity of water, a proven fact with all the devastation. Laugh if you like but scientific evidence is accumulating, just look at the sites around the World where pieces of stone as much as 60 or more tonnes are cut with such precision paper cannot fit between the joints, dated at well over 2,000 years it cannot be explained how even primitive iron tools could not do it let alone move the bloody things kilometres. There will be revelation upon revelation in the next ten to twenty years, which will embarrass much of the scientific and secular community, the United States have started it by admitting UFO's exist.
Can y’all give me yall email i know what it is its apart of Atlantis i can tell u what’s gone happen i had dreams about 3 years ago about all we goin thru now out creator is otw and he’s happy so just repent brothers n sisters
All the hype for nothing..sorry
In the future maybe you can send down a large enough drone on a cable to pressure blast some of the mercy mud away so that you can get a clear picture. Because the more you can see the more you can learn  it was meant to be fond for a reason. Other wise it would have never been found, you may need some kind of night vision radar  with a high pixel resolution.
Star wars relic
Melinniem falcon 🫣
Это космический инопланетный объект когда то потерпевший крушение !!
Hello This is my opinion, based on the fact that UFO's are made out of metal we don't have on earth and therefore strong enough to break rock but not damage the machine.  After seeing the last images it certainly looks like a crash site,  hundreds of years ago a UFO crash landed on the bottom of the baltic sea, travelling at thousands of MPH, enough speed to cut an underwater mountain in half slowing down consideratly the machines speed, it comes to a halt several hundred meters after. It may have been lying there for centreries, and the fine sediments on the baltic sea floor have over the years formed a thick crust over the machine so thick that the samples taken from the site only look like rock/stone, but if one drills meters in to the "Anomally" one might hit some mettallic object beneath the layers of silt sendiments that have covered and hardened over the years lying there undisturbed !!   And therefore it may well be of Exterestrial nature, with beings inside, well conserved like the rest of the sunken ships emerged from the bottom of the Baltic sea bed !!!    I'd be interested to read your opinions on my theorie !! I would love to hear the final truth as i've been very interested in this finding since I 1st heard about it !! Keep up the great work !!
As a bobcat driver I'm happy to drop my machine down there to move soil and grab a few samples in my 4 in 1 bucket , any sponsors out there to supply a HUGE  zip lock bag to place the 3.5 tonne machine into so its water tight , oh and an rubber tube for an airline 😂
Looks like the millennium falcon.
Pretty obvious it's a spaceship. If it was nothing there wouldn't be threats n cover up. Anything that leads to missing or crashed technology usually means deaths to witnesses but i guess now days they just threaten and destroy people reputation.
very strange that it looks like the Millennium Falcon.
Elon Musk to get involved?
whats the issue with identifying it,,,,,,,,,,,its obviously the millenium falcon
....rocks 😆 🤣 😂  !
Looks like there's something that needs emediate attention and financial support as well as additional research and support from many other scientific dycaplins. Appears to be a vessel covered with burnt dabree over the surface. This is an ENORMOUS  discovery. Millions of us could send our bucks worth. Money is always an issue isn't it?
Found This Object Over Ten Years Ago And Haven't Done A Damn Thing About It Yet What The He'll Are You Waiting On Are You Going To Talk Us All To Death Before Something Is Done Bunch Of Stupids People Want To Know And Have A Right To Know.
If an object did hit a mountain and broke apart as a crash site the exact thing fox news would do is shame you and loose your sponsorship so you won't be able to discover what they don't want us to know about.  Think about it, just a thought tho.
He said "and it looked like a YOUfo". Sophisticated. Refreshing. Refined.
Keep up the good work. Don't let others bring you down. Proof is pudding of what you are seeking and you showed us in this video
It's a gun turret base pushed off a ww2 naval destroyer...Simple as that...🕵️‍♀️✌👍👁
Millennium Falcon.
It looks like a GIANT crystalline structure in an iron meteorite.
The black burned rocks are leftovers from impact
Do you really think if it's an alien craft they'd be allowed to tell the truth of it. I think it's Alien. Well,alien to us. There was life on this planet way before humans were here. We're not that special in my opinion. Those in power will never let the truth be told or they'd no longer have control of the people
There are nut bars everywhere ! I for one find it very interesting carry on my friends and good hunting 👌👍
Elon Musk
Could it be a replica of a real ship carved in stone?
Just put a giant dome over it and fill it with air and then start digging. We still haven't gotten real hoverboards, let's catch up with SciFi movies some more and do cool whacky things to explore our own planet. Much better money and time spent than all this war and corrupt politics garbage.
It seem like an real  crashed ufo with it skid long mark  but turned into a  rock i hope they can take small part of that thing for laboratories studies.
0:45 Well that is obviously the silhouette of the Millennium Falcon.  Case closed.
I knew this channel have no answer.. just a click bait... waste of time
This is absolutely amazing!! You guys keep doing what your doing!! Open the eyes of all the closed minded!! It saddens me that individuals can be so evil as to threaten you and yours!! Please know that many many other individuals find your work fascinating and incredible!! Much luck to you all and I can't wait to see what's next for you guys!!
My kind of people . No matter who you are or we're your from . Really takes all kinds to get results like these .
another damp squib production
You  aren't crazy
People  who  are  not scepted  I am from from Canada  your  wor  is very  grate
No hate to the crew of divers but this show was a whole lot of nothing. No new info, nada.
This is a 2011 video 😂 wheres more recent detailed findings????
This sounds like another "Mystery of Oak Island."  Total waste of time.
I've seen this before and wondered if they were able to go out again and investigate further since this was filmed. It certainly looks like a crash site to me. I hope they find a way to get back out there because I'd really like to see a part 2 and to know what it is. I also don't think that's volcanic rock.... I think it was rock that was heated during the crash.
Contact Marine Biologist they can get a submarine and go down there. I wish you could get more images maybe inside it! Or one day bring it up on land!!
It looks like a ship or ancient building and many feel the same way. It also looks Ancient. I wish I could drive to go see it.
This has been an extraordinary discovery. I hope your team can continue your research on this anomaly.
At 1st Glance to me it's obviously the Millennium Falcon.  Mystery solved,  your welcome everyone!
View from the top looks like the Millenium Falcon from Star Wars. Chewie and Han Solo could still be onboard.
the millennium falcon they found it
It is Falcon Millennium from Star Wars..
it's the real millenium falcon!
Do we have the ability to bring this object to the surface, it would be interesting if we were able to properly study it? Until then all we have is speculation, who knows, there could be dead aliens inside of it, at least that's what I'm hoping.
1951st, 12 February 2023
We would not have any knowledge of what things are without people like you keep looking
Why does it not surprise me that all the negativity comes from Fake Fox News and the MAGA crowd.
I think it's worth another look! Thank you for doing all this so we can gaze at this amazing discovery. Next time you bring something to be tested tell them nothing! NOTHING! Lol your geo guy leaked that information or the camera crew following you around!
What is the latest news on this research? This can be a breakthrough and the answer to many questions, why are there not companies out there to support the crew?
Vietnames.
There is a lot more to this than rocks. Keep your chin up and keep going. We believe in you guys!
jeez talk about old news rehashed. with no 2023 updates on this object, nor further investigation. anyway it is something like teotihuuacuan you can see the steps and roads. Submerged ancient shrine
Funny when something way out of the ordinary gets found...... Immediate cover up and destruction of the finders livelihood.
Who see the double sworded angel, underneath the head machine? Annunaki?
Highly possible and most likely the top of a buried pre catastrophic pre-ancient times civilization. The earth had many transformations in the far far past, earth tilts and wobbles universal changes, many things the sea levels could change from, causing humanity to start over.
Cog
It equivilated?
Are you kidding me wtf
Just maybe they could find the scattered debri of the China balloon 🇺🇲🇺🇲
It looks to have stairs, it has to be man made.The government probably knows the truth and probably paid Fox News to say it was just a rock to cover up what it really is
sad waste of time hoax.  Better Luck next time.
Well done sleuthing work for the high tech instruments that were available at the time. I agree that it DOES look like a crash site, possibly from the long past. All those who took part in this discovery will be exonerated and credited when the wreck is finally excavated.
Isn't it ironic how one person can throw throw error in the pot and it snowballs. When Columbus first tried to explore look how many walls he came up against. Just think if he would have not discovered what he did, when he did. The capabilities are all around us now, keep pushing forward!
While their looking for treasures.  Sick American Government is looking for all genitalia.  Drop America Russia and China
It seems much bigger . Looks as if that’s just the top layer
They dove but dint take any debre or anything
No one will think it is a boring answer!  Good luck!
UFO's love to dance in and out of Volcanoes, this one lingered too long and took damage and ditched in the water.
Lame
Look guys! A rock!!
The millenium falcon!
l thought they had concluded it was just a natural rock formation a long time ago !!?
Wow…the threat tells you there’s something serious there
Of course it's manmade. Ancient civilisations carved likenesses of objects they had seen on a regular basis.
So it turned out to be a large rock...
Belongs to our Ancestors and descendents of this realm. This is Just like digging up our ancestors.
If FOX said something and the people with money don't want to know anything than they already know and have lied to the world about what it is.
Nothing...absolutely nothing should distract Peter and Dennis from chasing their dream.  Scientists told me my son would most likely die shortly after birth.  I will not go into specifics, but the experts were wrong.  My son is now 33 years old and is thriving.  Yes he has some physical challenges, but those challenges have only made him stronger.  So much so, he has unique insights and compassion that most do not.  He is a better man than myself.  I have never lost faith that, with the grace of God, he would survive and have a beautiful and fulfilling life.  I do not know of a loving individual.  He has fought tooth and nail to reach his dreams.  He now has received a Doctorate degree and has received state board license to practice.  From a 1.5 pounds at birth to a full and vibrant man.  Peter and Dennis must forge forward, must fight tooth and nail until they can exhaust efforts to obtain a scientific conclusion and explanation.  The anomaly might not be anything but stone, or it could be a wreck which has been waiting thousands and thousands of years to be discovered and reborn.  God bless and God's speed.  Drill, analyze and discover the unknown.
As long as the universe has been I'm sure there's more than a few "crafts" underwater somewhere
Looks like a starship with a bridge and aft separated by a long corridor like the craft in the Event Horizon sci-fi movie (https://www.framerated.co.uk/frwpcontent/uploads/2017/07/eventhorizon01-978x509.jpg).  On the side of the rear wing is an engine turbine/after burner/laser weapon platform?
Wish you all the luck
See how the press took over, changed the story for profit, then shafted them !
dont give up on it seems like some people dont want you to discover what it really is
Finaly my car is founded
It doesn't look like a UFO, it looks like we need to be looking for Han and Chewie
So ya know nothing.  But good work
Looks like a template for building or making aluminum template for space ship lol.
It is a very mysterious object, for me it's like a UFO which crashed hundreds of years ago! But keep going with the project my friends.
They need Howard Hughes Ship Designed to Pull a Russian Submarine Off the Bottom of the Ocean.
Well when I win the lotto, I'll fund them
Glacial erratic probably deposited 100s of thousands of years ago
THEY USE MOVIES TO DISCLOSE TRUTH. WE SEEN THIS ONE IN STAR WARS.
There IS much bigger thing close very close that star wars ship.👌
Apparently it turns out it was only Hilary's email server!
So sad to have stupid people saying things like this. Don’t listen to fox. I believe you’ve found something interesting. Even if it’s lava? Why? And I’m sorry that people threaten you for just being honest.

It is strange that the Sweden Navy was watching. Perhaps they influenced Fox to send out the unverified information that ruined the support he needed.
Your research should have led you to  millionaires with interests in the ufo phenomenon. Bob Bigelow for instance.  He's spent millions speculating.
This IS a crash site, first they discredit you with public humiliation and make you go bankrupt and once you are out of the way they send in their own teams to study the damn thing. This black rock looks similar to the one found near the Richat structure in Mauritania.
Very interesting! Is this something new? I'm mean... When started the first expedition and when finished this 3d images?  Even with "Timeline"  chanel  brand, I didn't see anyone lol
It's the Millennium Falcon 🤣
If it is just a volcanic geological anomaly, it's shape certainly is intriguing - on par with the Japanese undersea anomaly
I want to know what it is!
They need a geologist and perhaps an archeologist to look at the pictures to speculate.
Is that the millennium falcon
How sick are these jerks that send threatening messages!!! To accomplish what??? God Bless these men that are just HONEST TREASURE HUNTERS !!!!
They really tried to drum up the drama with the fog.  Also F*ck Fox News
I'm sorry such sick people are scum...
The USA wants to end this so they can take it over...  Pentagon glad to shut them up... better than being killed.
0:47 "And it looked like a UFO"..... This is just something stupid to say. I don't know how many times this has been brought up, but UFO stands for Unidentified Flying Object, it does not mean it is an alien ship, because then it would be identified, and therefore not unidentified. What makes it unidentified is the fact that you can't tell what it is. So UFO Key words (Unidentified) and (Flying). And this is a sunken object (not flying, or swimming for that matter) and you are saying it looks like something that is... well... UNIDENTIFIED so.. what are you saying?. Jesus stop this right now. the term UFO does not equal ALIEN SHIP. UFO is UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. A rock can be a UFO if you still haven't identified it as a rock. A spy plane can be a UFO if it is flying and it has not yet been identified as a spy plane... Get it?
For everyone who thinks it´s a rock formation: Scans of the sea floor show that this object crashed. There's a clear trail behind it that show the collision path. Perhaps a massive tsunami knocked this object off of a mountain far away, or perhaps it's extraterrestrial.
Looks like the fighter ships from star trek" hmm
Is obviously a giant Suzuki QC-1 Q Chord
This really should be studied further. The object clearly slid across the bottom. Which means it had some serious velocity on impact. Natural or not, we need to know more.
I just stumbled on this literally in seconds I said the same.  “Well that’s the millennium falcon”.  Easy!
They are an outstanding group of professionals. I hope at some point their exploration of this object continues in the near future.
If I won the lottery I would sponsor you all the war and back again.
First time i saw the high definition view, i thought a Sword pour mold..3 parts-  anyway i have seen a small piece of volanic spit that shape but not that dense. very interesting rock.
is a russian nuclear silo
Poor guys drowned.
How about lifting it? People would probably sponsor that.
The Baltic sea anomaly is interesting.
Stay strong! I believe you have found something extraordinary , the negative powers that be are trying to cover it up
Well I'll beeeeeeeeee................. It's the dreaded A N C I E N T rock......oh well....spoiler alert.
This is way more interesting than looking through space.We have history on the bottom of the ocean.We should be searching more and more even built safehouses down there!
This happened over a decade ago, I don't think we're going to be seeing another expedition any time soon... lol
Im not even gonna watch this but I can guess that they never find out or tell you what it is.
❤💯☝💪💪💪💪
That's my hair pin!
Elon Musk should take a look...
People are so evil. I wish the treasure hunter much blessings and luck. All the others that try to intimidate Petter and Dani they are loosers.
Call my uncle
I think thats a server
YEAH - NOT!!! 1!! Cover your rears and hold on to the kitchen sink!
I am not a Scientist but, lets assume that this is a crush UFO, is it possible, that when it crushed on the seafloor, it got covered with lava as the result of the impact, and it ended up drying and became concrete as the result of the crush as the time passes??? that could explain the dark charcoal like rock that they found around it, but then again, I am not an expert on that...   This is just my Hypothesis...
Nobody could identify?! I recognized the Millenium Falcon right away!  It's not a spaceship, you idiots. 🤦‍♂
Fox news does it again,,,, They are not explorers, never have nor will they be. They report what they guess might be the answer. Get the team back out and do an examination of the object. Not just that one but the other that shows skid mark too.
Just so happens to look like that ship from Star Wars..the millennium falcon. Can't believe anything you see from media nowadays...could we ever?
"IS THIS SOME KIND OF FAILURE OMOUMOU??
I sure wish these guys a satisfying conclusion to this mystery.
It's clearly the Ebon Hawk the Selketh hid away.
The most long winded waste of time. This is total rubbish, it's purely for the ads, waste of time.
millennium falcon
It's not a UFO its a bag full of king size Snickers bars
Mainstream smearing them so the dive can't be uncovered..!!!!  These guys found something and the powers that be don't want them going back..  exactly the same thing that Graham Hancock has to deal with..  what aren't we being told about this planet and its history?
Thanks!
The Truth Behind Baltic Sea UFO Build by ODIN Once of his First at did not work to good .ODIN was Born in 439 A.D also Greatest...  Grandson of Barabbas one in the Bible who became Greatest Follower of JESUS CHRIST, and ODIN & Vikings Left the Earth in 473 A.D to Aldebaran Star System . ODIN found Secrets of Atlantis in Norway Area
They wouldn't have turned to glass because of the super cooling effect of the water.. therfore I think those rocks were charred by the craft hitting the bedrock of the ocean. Then becoming super cooled before they could turn to glass. A meteor or comet isn't shaped with mathematical angles or perfect lines. Thinkers get this simply.
Surely it just LOOKS like something hit the mountain. Surely to cut through it like that you'd need very slow but very powerful movement. Exactly like a glacier would cause or like tectonics might create..... Either way that's just as interesting as any UFO and worthy of study.....
It looks like a crash site or a mined out mountain to another location structure that was built from it. This is too extreme but perhaps not, considering altogether what this world can do.
So very obviously it is the YT 1300fp light freighter... The Millennium Falcon. Duh!
yeah. F. Hawk Milenium 100 %. Han Solo landed there and left that old junk.
It's a pre-global flood object or a glacier that put that there. A stone wall with a door in it.
Millenium Falcon.
It's the mellinium falcon.
I really enjoyed the documentary ,  very interesting, I wish you all the luck on earth that you can find the answers to it being there,  It is obviously something that matters to someone,  because whenever you get close to finding true answers the vermin climb out of the closet and start to close it down, first with media ridicule and then personal threats, I hope you can keep going with the project............
This sea has existed for 8000 years now and was created 6000 years before christ, the impact shows that it was a crash on dry land, so at least 8000 years ago or more, e.g. 10,000 B.C. Ancient peoples may also have carved a staircase on the stone and held rituals on the spaceship for years, who knows, the gods may have flooded the area by means of the Noah flood
1:17 sums up the entire documentary if you want to save time.
Don't forget that it can be quite petrified after 10,000 years, as much as 1 meter of stone may have grown over the object so you have to drill a lot, think of it as a fossil in the middle of a large stone, so the mistake is quickly made with stone, and who knows, they used to be creatures that didn't consist of matter, but stone-shaped objects were needed to travel space, because they themselves are too light in weight for certain mathematical effects, which would explain why there are so many strange cool-shaped objects wandering the earth without any content
that spaceship just crashed right through a mountain, from space when their shield was still active damm, our technology would have smashed into the mountain
why don't you go and claim millions against fox news, maybe the judge will be on your side
Synced
I would look into ancient legends folklore of anything that concerns the area
Oh come on! Take the sample to a Geologist who will cut a thin section and examine it with a polarizing microscope. Figure out what it actually is made of (concrete?) Don't start with an Archaeologist.
I worked on a research vessel for 3 years. All of the overboard equipment had "pingers" so if lost they could be easily found. Pingers are cheap relative to the equipment.
Without knowing anything about what it is made of, it's clearly a UFO!
Oh. it's just the Millenium Falcon..
If you watches the video all away through to the end, then you know damn well this isn't a natural anomaly. TO SAY THAT IT IS, IS PROVING JUST HOW SCARY YOU ALL ARE ABOUT OTHER BEINGS FROM OTHER PLACES.
just watch the last two minutes don't waste your life time with the entire video smh
Keep going with ur treasure hunt and don't mind those who doesn't support u in discovering the unknown! U are all amazing! Salute! God bless u in ur future treasure hunts!
EVERY DAY MORE PROGRESS IS MADE IN DIVING EQUIPMENT AND UNDERWATER CAMERAS AND SUBMARINES,I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS THE END OF IT .
I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING IMPORATANT THAT THE POWERS THAT BE DO NOT WANT SEEN.WHEN YOUR ON TO SOMETHING THEY TRY TO STOP YOU ..
Been from the United States I have seen some thing similar to this.  After the war, there were weapons that had been used that had to be sealed to protect the population around there in the environment.. if you do some research on this, you will see that they are round concrete domes that this hazardous material was placed under to prevent it from leaking out.
If the anomaly is man made, could it have been made during the ice age when Doggerland was dry?  That wouldn't answer the question of the volcanic rock but it could set the stage for more answers to be found.  I'd like to think the anomaly was a UFO crash site but we can't stop looking for alternate possibilities until the answers are confirmed. It would be almost as intriguing to learn how ice age humans built something as large and complicated as this..  Keep asking questions and looking for answers and we will eventually hit upon the correct scenario.
I know everyone wants it to be "aliens" but seriously this is most likely a geological feature related to glaciation processes.
Purposeful diversions of waters?
Doesn't the drying out of the Euphrates have a human cause of just being diverted for agriculture, power generation, selfish greed ande power for certain nations, rather than any Angelic causation?  Wars?  Financial?  Causations?  Human endeavors?
This documentation was worthless and didn't say nothing....hot air from the beginning to the end!
an ancient structure from before the cataclysm. the level of the sea was more than 100m lower than now, so it was above water.
the baltic see ground was above the sea level during the ice age. this object is likely a man made megalithic structure from an ice age civilization. there are tons of sunken megalithic sites across the coats. this stuff is surpressed because it uprootes the political agenda of the ruling elite. there is a huge pyramid around the azores, and multiple megaliths around the caribbean and the entire coastline around the atlantic acean, which are all submerged.
they just proved that the Millennium Falcon does exist in Star Wars were actually happened not some made-up story from movies when George Lucas was visited by aliens and planting the idea into his mind lol
If nature or the universe created something like this the discovery is as important as if this was man-made. This is what adventures and discoveries are meant to do, to research and find the truth no matter what. So sorry to hear that the team went through so much grief over this and even their families, that is just terrible, alone the prep work and research and dives would have been a huge financial and human effort, seems like someone really wanted this research to be discredited on purposes and that makes me more certain that someone has got something to hide out there below the sea.
"They've found what only can be described as an alien spaceship"... The dolphins listening to all this are just laughing at us.
You totally found the lost Millennium Falcon! Way to go!...
Its either the Millenium Falcon or It looks like the Master Chief's Helmet from  from Halo side view.
Extraordinário!! Como é salutar ver uma história incrível de uma tenacidade, e a coragem dos mergulhadores em busca de respostas!! O lado horrível da natureza humana sem respeito nenhum pelo esforço de quem explora o fundo dos oceanos!! Se for um UFO é  uma euforia se for algo que diga respeito à parte Terra ...descredibilizam e desprezam o achado!! O meu respeito e admiração ...espero que consigam desvendar este mistério oferecido pelo mar!!
I don't understand why there hasn't  been a full fledged scientific expedition to this site by now!!
It's the Millennium Falcon.
Obviously a Falcon spacecraft from the Star Wars, so what ? This is a story made out of nonsense.
Pretty obvious why this exploration was shut down and made a mockery of.....
It’s the Millennium Falcon !
Clearly it's the Millennium Falcon. Duh.
The spaceship is a rock space ship 😎
Its a man made object moved there by a glacier from thousands of years ago. Everything gets erased every few thousands years.
The millennium falcon I knew it
Kinda looks like the Ebon Hawk ship from Star Wars: KOTOR.
You know you must be on something when you're defamed and threats are made. Why would that happen over supposed rock formation.
people that now insert their own commercials are doing a disservice to their content.
Gat them to stop. It is a game an you are not a player.
Nuclear waste  ?
If time was so critical why are they traveling within perfect weather conditions they should have been sitting over the object while the storm raged and waited for calmness to begin their studies I see them traveling towards the object in perfect whether they should have been there already that ship looks quite large enough to have ridden out the storm above the object
The Millennium Falcon crash landed a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
Millennium Falcon. It's the Hollywood prop. 😂
39:59 I have these exact thoughts about many ancient structures. Where it looks like they've shaped hot lava.
Omg Give that captn a snickers ! ☝️
History channel should finance them like skinwalker ranch and the Oak island!!!!!!!!!
They should really sue. Fox is trump
Looks more like a space ship than anything, to me ! Nature is not smart enough to make an object to look like this!
The Millennium Falcon🤔
Can you say STAR WARS THE MILLENNIUM FALCON AND IT GLOWS GREEN (ECTO GREEN) I SAW ANOTHER SHOW THAT FEATURED THIS STRUCTURE
That ring of rocks looks like a campfire. The Baltic was dry land just 12,000 years ago when ocean levels were 400 feet lower.
Now you know you have found something important and valuable. Typical discrediting MO modis operandis by higher ups.
Should be called the Polish Sea, we are the only Empire in history to fully control it.
My name is Robert.  I live in the United States of America, I have watched your post on your Baltic sea anomaly,  and have read some incouraging articles on what might lie at the Bottom. If it is what I Beleve it to Be,  You'll never get ti to the surface. The Goverments will see to that. I Beleve Humanity is Ready...the most Powerfull Are not...I Have had some experiences with things that fill the sky's. Be safe. Trust no one.
Reminds me of the molten type material that fell onto a fishing ship as they observed a UFO incident off the coast of the US.
If I wanted to make money out of nothing I would become a central banker.
Why does it have to be a space ship what if Mr Lucas just suck a starters ship because that's what a human ufo would look like one directional flight design
Why do they keep calling it a ufo I mean isn't it underwater so it be more accurate to call it a USO right.
Not worth the view unless you don't want answers
I think it's probably the remains of a pre ice age temple.
Nothing WW II submarine trap
Am I the only one recognized the background music from the old RTS PC game Celtic Kings: Rage of War?
They need to take Bob Lazar with them.   Seriously.
Anything to do with this "Baltic sea ufo/uso" and im there, this is soooo fascinating. 🤔
I'm getting pre great flood megalith, aligned to a celestial body???
Looks like some one really tried to stop them.
It is always worth exploring and as technology gets better then we get better answers - even if it ultimately turns out to be natural formations of some sort. We all know that Fox is fake and anti-science and their followers are violent, credulous rubes. There is so much about the ocean and what is down there that we still don’t know. Science is about the pursuit of answers.
Looks like something crashed through the rock and came to a screaming hault ... somebody knows and are doing everything to keep those divers from the find of the century.
how tf can it be a world phenomenon
Those divers had much courage to make those dives !
The fact that they got canceled without any proof shows that media in this day of age is the one that dictates the shape and truth about our life's, history, and existence, sadly.......
It looks like a broken top of a underworld entrance ..see below thhe top
Russian round ship Novgorod.
These divers have balls of steel caring all those risks on their shoulders. Wow. 🙏🏽
you know by those last pics of mounton what if its some sorda anchent temple or gathering place that some tribe or something like that using the dirt of the mountion to construct the eleveted walkway to the object diging the mountion out to git the dirt to elevate the walkway to it and the other littler one may ba a living area for thare king or whatever to live it allmost seems like a wershiping site i wonder if its hollow but that seems with the gruve in the montion could be whare thay got the dirt to make the walk way and would also serv as a gateway  to it. its just a gess mabythe burnt part is a offering to the gods or something thay berned (parden my horrable spelling)
It's like whatever it is doesn't want you to know. Everything kept going wrong for them. Poor guys
Clickbait
Hahaha youfo
Good God I couldn't handle the drama let's get to the facts.
I love how the diver's face looked like he can't even believe what he's describing. He's just so confused at what the object is!
Interesting.  The weather.. Perhaps it doesn't particularly want to be found.
collection of time filler imagery nothing useable
I'm not happy knowing the people involved and their families harassed by low I.Q. morons!
Millenium falcon from Star Wars is hidden on earth 🌎
First off , with something like this , how come the budget was so small . The possibilities for this to be a true UFO , would mean , that money would not be an issue . As they say , from the start , this smells . The cable for the fish let go , so why did they have to repair the fish . It's the cable that needed repair . when is the follow up episodes .
It’s the master chiefs helmet with smashed visor.
The fact that as humans living on earth, we had the early focus to explore space. However the unknown space of our oceans, of which are firmly positioned on the SURFACE of our planet. How then has so little of the oceans been entirely explored? The complete unknown that space would have been in the mid 1960s can't have been viewed as a possibility of reality, rather more likely to be the excuse chosen unless of course we had help? The historic events & discoveries we all have been educated in, have many falsifications within the narrative that has been documented. To this day the impossible expanse & variation of lies we as a society are regularly told as common truths, all of which have official credentials to reinforce authenticity as such can only be summarised as criminal. Right down to the publicly acceptance of the new trendy catch term TRANSPARENT OR TRANSPARENCY. This has now replaced truth or being truthful, oh how the common folk are easily led!! So what's the original meaning of 'transparent'? Yes, that's correct...... it's clear, or see-through, or invisible. Invisible, that's the ticket right there. Can you see it now? No its invisible, it can't be seen, that is TRUTH has become invisible right in front of your eyes. Genius, and it's here to stay that way! ToT
I'm shocked I can't find any one pointing out the bald guy looks like the captain if starship enterprise hiding amongst us older gen humans lol even his red suit looks like the uniform lmfao just a funny coincidence,maybe not.
Not surprising at all, that all received media after going public was pure speculation. All documentation on discoveries not of our present timeline, is based on utter speculative ideas. This practice of officially credited guess work is no more prevalent than within the professional scientific community, archeology being top of the guess work list. ToT
How can ANYONE say that this is a rock formation? Are you nuts?
Its a capstone thats on the prison of the mythical Kraken.
Most everyone has seen or heard of the movie "ALIEN", if there is a creature like inside there it needs to be destroyed!!!!
That's the millennium falcon, I was wondering where I parked that thing after my last big night clubbing....
I've seen those twin arches before, I think they're opening a new MacDonald's down there. The first site is probably the parking area for your submarines.
*That’s the Ebon Hawk!!!*
The object was stolen .
It’s obviously the millennium falcon.
I thought it looked like the melenium falkin when I 1st saw it.😂😂
It's the all seeing eye that was blown off the top of the great pyramid when it exploded.
At least watch the last 3 minutes
Dont stop
i read all those comments about bravery and the heroic mission they are doing.. are you really that dumb to not understand this is all staged? lol im in shock
Looks like a concrete ship part. Used during war time when steel and iron were scarce
I am a USCG licensed Master Captain. I also began diving in 1995...yes 1995. Seeing this "documentary" make me think that about 90% of it is Hollywood B/S. Just saying!
NOTE: this object was determined years ago to be a natural geological rock formation of some sort. There is nothing indicating that it was man made or of alien origin. Look it up for yourself under:" Baltic Sea Anomaly"
It could hold nuclear fuel waste, encased in concrete then dumped in to the bottom so the cool water can keep it from reaching high temps.  Whoever dumped it is like, uh-oh.  Gulp.
They just want to get paid 😂😂😂
Millennium falcon
It's a Millennium Falcon
You’re up against Scientism. Good luck.
What’s the millennium falcon doing down there?
Maybe it's an annunaki and
Insufficient knowledge prohibits asking the right questions
Looks like a UFO in the Baltic it is
Even country like China and India are still not considered as "overpopulated". They still have a massive uninhabited land.
It very well could be man made. During the peak of the ice age water levels were 400ft lower than they are today. Idk if this area was under a glacier or not, but it super weird this one area survived. Glaciers pulverize everything.
the Millenium Falcon, obviously
different civilizations.. great work..
Loads of rubbish!
Give it up guys! 🤣🤣🤣
it looks like the millennium falcon
Since this is not a new discovery, somebody knows exactly what it is. Unfortunately, the rest of us will never know.
Millennium Falcon
It looks a bit like the Millennium falcon from above.
Probably a protruding rock surface, water levels were way lower thousands of years ago.
always wondered what happened to the Millennium Falcon....
That's the Millenium Falcon
Reality TV garbage. Don't waste your time
Det är för galet för ord att det inte finns några sponsorer att hitta....eller har vetenskapen ett stort finger med i spelet vad vår verkliga sanning från historien inte ska berättas Jag önskar dig lycka till i ditt sökande efter en sponsor
Am I the only one seeing the Millennium Falcon?
Keep up fight need know what this is God Bless 😇😇😇😇🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I am thinking that it might be from an ancient under water volcano that violently erupted millions of years ago
They didn't have GPS... RUFKM... 60 meters in diameter.... and 'they had to "find",IT
from skim thru the vid fast,it can be a concrete block,with nuclear waste encased..inside the concrete,then dumped into the ocean..but who did this,if so?
Keep searching. Hopefully someone with means will assist you with equipment to get down there and clear it up to get to base.  I believe it too is a crash sight !  Praying you and yours stay safe .  God Bless you. Thank you for sharing. 🙏
Just goes to show the stupidity of people that follow what others tell them,or make comments about something. And don't have a clue WTF they are talking about.  We have been lied to about everything that's being shown to us from our past history, up until even today!  For those that have made there stupid threats to theses guy's family!  Saying something about their children!!! Just like a coward! Don't have the balls to even show whom they are! They are small minded people! Pigs have better brain function than those people do! That's why evil comes out of there mouths! They don't have enough brain to be like normal people in society. And they hide what they do and say about everything! That's why the darkness takes over all those small minded,no manners, can't think for themselves people! And are lead around like a dog on a leash in society today! I hope the gentlemen in the video will be able to get the funds to keep doing what they love, and trying to get the truth regardless of what it may be! If I were able to help funding with getting them back out there! I absolutely would! God bless them and be with them and there's always!🙋❤️‍🔥🙏🕊️🥹
Patreon is a way to raise money, or other crowd funding.  As for the burned re-melted surface, it could be a meteor.  The other possibility that comes to mind is the most far fetched but if there is a metal structure below an ablative surface to survive entry into the atmosphere.
It is definitely a crash site and it looks like some people are trying to cover it up. That is why you are getting death threats. Keep on pushing don't give up!!
Halo the master chief
Clearly that's the Millennium Falcon
Given the Soviet's investment in experimental new vehicles and such, like the Lun-class Ekranoplan, aka "The Caspian Sea Monster", and their habit of losing things in the sea, this could well be one of theirs, and threats to those trying to investigate their wrecks are also normal activity for the Russian military. Western militaries would also like to be first at retrieving Russian wrecks, so they also might be inclined to put out fake news to prevent civilians getting their hands on it.
Its litterally a model of the Millennium Falcon used for a hoax🤣😂🤡 Mockumemtary.
Absolutely amazing find this!
The fact that this has been the second time they've been there and didn't take a small core sample 6" or12" deep.  Even a 1" diameter core bit from amazon ...they spent a million or more already. A 200$ core bit and a cordless 20v water proof drill sure would've been nice...
jus keep digging we can still see you
Very interesting and pretty cool!
a od shaped rock that sucked almost a houre from your life.
Belt buckle
Aaawwww to brand these guys conmen is disgusting! Just imagine a world without people like them? Just imagine how grey and dull it would be 😢 if there were no people that take ideas by the balls and runs with them we would have NOTHING! 😢 I APPLAUD YOU GUYS WELL DONE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING!!!! 🎉🎉
It is obviously the millennium falcon.
How doe's one raise a family being a treasure  hunter??
Remember There have sightings of UFO's going down into volcanos,  it could very well be cover in volcano material. Was there a core test done, or did ahyone think to use a strng magnetic to see if its a meteor.  I dont they were thinking out of the box, it could be a craft inside the rock material.
When FOX News says theres nothing to see here that makes me think the opposite.  I wish these guys the best, follow your dreams and dont let anyone put you down. Great documentary, thank you.
You could tell once the threats started the deep state had got involved which buys time to destroy the object whatever it may be  ......
Our little minds are not capable of understanding everything that is odd . We must check everything then check again and harder. Stay the course. It is what the write brothers did. And look at us now !
Who cares what it realy is its cool lets check it out way more interesting then kiling each other in pointless conflikts also it could be a buried submarine crushed and sanked also a concrete ship like the once in poland bild by germany in ww2 burned crushed and sunk so there are lots of potential options an all of them are awesome
Looks like a heavy object that split a mountain in two and left a skid mark on the ocean floor
It's very sad what happened to this team, as unlikely as it might be, it almost looks like a coordinated effort to ruin their reputation, a smear campaign as we are used to see these days against anyone going against the establishment. This said, I'd love to know what's down there, as there most certainly is something intresting. It's been more than 10 years anyway, where are we at with this? Why the silence? And don't say because it's nothing.
I get ghost bumps as well....lol...where do Swedes learn english?
So if it's 300 feet why hasn't anybody gone down there yet just like the cave in Malibu nobody has gone to it a couple boats of floated over it but no divers at all.
Looks like the Millennium Falcon!
When I read the title of this documentary I thought you where going to tell us what it was 🤦‍♂️anyway its a crash site in my opinion
Fox news which is American they are very very clever with hiding things especially the truth then exactly what it is they are involved with CIA and they are all covering everything up what is in the oceans we know that the truth all the sightings worldwide come on you trying to tell me they are all wrong obviously not some of them got to be real under government know it and they are hiding everything dulce base do your research on it
"Hey guys, here we have a U.S.O." (Unidentified Sunken Object) 😂
come on folks!!  if the story you tell were true already after two days we knew everything, but everything about the nature of this object through the complicity of the secret services and the army of the surrounding countries! Who do you take us for, Mongoloid children? Speculation after speculation as we are vaccined againt them! Cheers
It’s the Millennium Falcon!!!
Gonna be just like Monster Quest and Ghost Hunters….a whole lot of nothing
It's masterchief's combat helmet, clearly.
I like watching documentaries on Marijuana. Lol
There was probably a US sub following the whole time to.
cover up clearly. was probably a space ship or evidence of the 12000 yr annual  cataclysm
Any form of intelligence high enough to design a vehicle for interstellar travel should be able to create a system for disguising their craft, most probably with materials found freely on the destination world. In this case a lot of rocks and gravel. Moving off the disguise is priority to reveal the actual ma trial of the hidden object. Parking the craft at a depth almost impossible for retrieval or visual inspection is basic to the preservation of it's secrecy. It doesn't want to be found or evaluated. Humans cannot take more than tens of minutes under that depth. Why not use more remote rovers instead of endangering loves by diving physically?
What is wrong with fcking people who threatened the diver and his family.
I like the quote, "If anything happens, we're smoked.." Reminds me of The 5th Element.  "SMOOOOKE YOUUUU!!!"
Octopus Spacecraft.  They had to come from somewhere and that somewhere was somewhere else.  Do do do do , do do do do
Drivel. Waste of time.
THIS HAS BEEN DONE. IT'S JUST A ROCK. If you had never seen "Star Wars" you'd realise that quickly.   This is just TIMELINE's desperation for content.  People, save yourself the hour and spend time with your family.
They could have made there own videos and they would have made more money.
What is the gps coordinates ?
Younger Dryas impact that threw massive rock and ice all over the planet?
That’s a fuggin crashed Millenium Falcon
One of a handful of things I searched for years ago when first using Google Maps
I'm sure the lack of sponsorship had something to do with someone trying to keep the truth out of the publics view.  Suppression of the truth has always been a factor in discoveries it is always played off as some natural bs
To hadies with what people say”  they are ignorant to treasure hunting” and you are not crazy, there’s something down there unexplained for sure’ DONT GIVE UP!
The world reacting like this after all they've done is sickening. We need a new Younger Dryas event.
Why do they only show a tiny spot with the camera? I mean they have a camera down there looking at it. Why wouldn't they show us more? Because it's nothing and the guy is trying to scam people from money.
Call me Sherlock if you will, but my guess is it wasn’t a ufo. Save an hour of your life
90° angle lines on the exterior surfaces seem unnatural.
The Millennium Falcon of course....silly you😜🤪
what a majestic sophosticated UFO, huh?
This is a Megalithic Structure under the Baltic Sea
Duh it's the millennium falcon
This channel is a scam. Clickbaaaaaaaait
It’s obviously the designer’s styling proofs for a ‘62 Oldsmobile convertible.
This was like watching a bigfoot documentary!
It looks just like the millennium falcon! Probably an anomaly. Like a face in the clouds.
Why would u go out without a decompression chamber.... amatures lol
@0:48 We generally say U-F-O, not YOUFO. It stands for Unidentified Flying Object
I feel sorry for Dennis.  It is certainly an anomaly that would be great to understand, but it is most likely geological.  No stupendous discovery . . . but an advance in our understanding of the oceans.  Perhaps it IS a stupendous discovery if it provides a new and previously unsupposed phenomenon of oceanography.  That is our future and "final frontier" unless or until our technology figures out how to travel faster than light.
All the big statues could be a shield from one of the old ancient Hercules statue
Obviously a Forerunner installation 😂
That's the millenium falcon
Well the US used Fox News to close the subject about it so they could find out in secret
The Millennium Falcon! Wow! (so kidding)
The FOX news of “ROCKS” was orchestrated to kill funding. Swedish Navy knows where it is now too. Both sets of Grandparents and my parents all from Sweden. I’ve always loved their accents. You oughta here what a Swedish-Chicago accent sounds like 😃
It’s the millennium Falcon…easy.
🤦‍♂️Budget of $125,000!!!! WHAT!!!🤷‍♂️ Does anyone else think they went about this the wrong way. Had they of done a go fund me page from the get go. Had every news station tell there audience about the fund me pg. These guys would have Millions and Millions to work with. Every star wars fan from here to fricken China would have pitched in $10-$20 bucks me included. What a shame 😔. These guys could have built a fricken room around this thing underwater. O well. Maybe the next time they find a spaceship  they ask the world for a little financial help🤦‍♂️
18:21 😂 that face with any emotions I  don't if it's sad worried or mad  Or maybe all at the same time 🤔
I thought it was a pre ice age civilization monument  but after seeing the "crash site " dredge, I believe it's a UFO crash.
SPHERE...
This been discovered a long time ago🤣 before this
Looks like a rock
Mr Beast should finance your expedition and make a video about it.
This is incredible! They definitely need to get back out there.
I think if glaciers put this rock there then there would be others there with it.  Some of the shapes seem man made on the stone.  The whole thing is very interesting.  Even if it is all natural it still must have been a crazy even to have put it there.
Well, the "anomaly," didn't fall straight down to the bottom.  The long 'gouge,' in the bottom, indicates that the object hit the bottom at an angle and slid for the distance required to make the gouge. Maybe it could have been dropped from a ship, or dumped by a glacier.  But in that there is nothing absolute. The shape, and angles of the object's surface, are beyond a simple construct of natural means.  It has an obvious 'man made appearance to it, at least on the surface.' In any event, there will always be those who mock what they have no knowledge of, no concern for or understanding of. How many foolish people mock God?  Yet how many still believe in the Creator, His Son, and have faith in the scriptures? Finding the second object and the appearance of a crash site, only adds to the mystery! I hope to see and hear what they discover next!
Satellite imagery should be able to determine if this object fell from the top of the water, fell out of the sky or if it was from some explosion.  We would be able to see impact marks or something I would think.
What a strange coincidence that the navy ship appeared the day before the line mysteriously broke, sending the side scan sonar to the bottom of the sea.
That’s clearly the Millennium Falcon
That’s clearly the Millennium Falcon
Thank You.
No doubt a spaceship. Made by the ancient builder race, or more recent Mayan. Too hitech for our science to comprehend.
I love this kinda stuff    wishing you success don't let any so called powers that be stop you in your quest!
A wasted hour. There more mystery in my backyard.
It’s probably glacial deposits. If they really wanted to know what it is they would disclose the location so that actual scientists could investigate.
Could it be a 'plug' from a volcanic eruption which flew through the air to its present location?
46 Minute mark. Skeptic says it is "Official"; it is volcanic rock. I am sick and tired of these skeptic Smithsonian-sent morons giving their official word on stuff they don't know about. I was liking the video until that guy showed up with his ultimate knowledge BS.
Millenium Falcon?? Yes for sure! Lucas was correct.
Well there goes 57 minutes of my life I can't get back call my which is exactly why I don't watch videos about Bigfoot or the lock ness monster or Oak Island
Don't forget this object was first discovered in 2011, 12 years ago!  This video is basically  a remake/repeat from a decade ago!  Cool if you've never seen this or have heard of the object.  An update sure would be great!
They need to contact James Cameron.
Plot twist its a rock
Came for an underwater UFO and met the lollipop guild
It's nothing more than old star Wars movie junk
Judging by the thumbnail, the picture looks like the Master Chief's helmet from Halo!
That’s the Millennium Falcon sitting at the bottom of the ocean.
The most suspicious thing is that fox ran a debunking campaign.  I'm in the school of thought that if fox is against something then there's something to hide.
When they finally dive whatever this thing is they have problems with electronics their lights their gear everything
It’s the Mililiom Falcon notify Han Solo 🤔case solved
What a great video. Not every ship needs to be made out of some sort of metal. Look at. The last visitor we had to our solar system. Only a few years ago. It was made out of rock. Some scientists believe that it is a craft.
If aliens existed space would look like Star Trek.  Why?  Because that's what we would do.  It's not.  The fact that it doesn't should mean way more than some glimpse of something that you can't tell what it is and is probably the government anyways.  Why the heck doesn't it look like Star Trek is the real question.
salutation i am this is a ship of mine, one of many here on the earth, i am hid it there and made the water murky to hide it, only i am go in and out of it, only i am can command it, onlly i am that i am open and close the door that no man open or shut, i am that i am and i am is not a man
It’s Ned’s atomic dustbin lid.
I see in other countries they too like to keep the flower pattern on the windows way too long.  We do that in America too.
Obviously the Millennium Falcon’s final resting place.
It's a friggin rock people.
The topography def settles it.
The True identity and origin of this ancient spaceship has been revealed in  Elena Danaan's latest book "The Seeders" Highly, Highly Recommend it.
Thanks!
Has there ever been an update to this story?
300 feet is not deep at all. Buy a mini sub and spend all day down there. Run the entire surface with GPR. (Ground penetrating radar)
Its a rock!
The most useless "documentary" ever! Shame on you!
Looks like the millennium falcon
I have seen this before on some other vid. The question I have is, can it be brought to the Surface and  have some real tests performed.
its only 300 feet down why the divers going down and seeing the stone.
IT's a crash site folks.    THere are no such thngs as coincidence.  Erase that slate you've all been taught.  Its one big stinking lie.
Interesting.  I hope it will be clarified. Whether it is Mature made or man made the object is interesting enough to warrant some attention and study.
The Millennium Falcon?
Fifty Seven Minutes of Watching and Nothing...
What garbage
Aliens are demons See these images revealed through digital photography of the Shroud of Turin First image wears Crown like an Eagle Second is wearing Crown of Righteousness Third has horns in its head Not highlighted is above cup image for two grey Aliens of different species there are many demons Aliens truths seen here This knowledge is our strength.

lolol sounds so fake .. oh *expletive* ends with a "hit" and starts with an S,...so you foul liars couldnt just float for a few more hours... lolololo, get better at looooong clink bait mmmmyes sheeeee mmmmhyesss.. so bad mmyesss... seeee!!!!
good luck guys amazing work
It looks like a rock to me
Looks like an island carved out by humans long ago to on one side to be a mini port.
That's not the spaceship you showed us because I bet the illuminati made you stay away from the spaceship.
It's anything but a crashed ET spaceship from outerspace.....Case closed!  It can only be something else besides what fits the profile from evidence gathered.  Ignore that man behind the curtain that makes all of the electronics malfunction on the exploring ship. Don't listen to any of the actual folks that put their lives in danger diving and coming up telling everybody it looks intelligently manufactured.
You might lose the ROV too.
The illuminati cut your sonar with that Swiss military ship's help.
The illuminati wants to know where the spaceship is.
It's the egg of the Midgard's Serpent waiting to hatch just before RAGNAROK.
They don't want you to touch it because they work for the illuminati and they want to recover it.
Why make a documentary without bothering to actually document or teach or solve anything at all!? Probably just a weird rock on the bottom of the ocean, what a waste of time…
It's the drain plug for the Baltic. Nothing more
" Concrete like ,  BURNT  ROCK "  ?  That spells out THERMO TILES (or Surface)  of some ancient vehicle from  SPACE  Overspeeding Re Entry in our Atmosphere and consequent Landing in Ocean.   The ' Path of TOUCHDOWN ' is as clear as daylight for such an enormous craft crashing to a standstill on sea bottom.   Was it the CIA or someone else MISLEADING the world once again of the true nature of this object  ?  Most likely.
Looks like a sunken city that skipped across the ocean floor and nothing to see here folks.move along now...single file line only. Did I get through from the shadow B*nn*ing?
What the f--k are these two big tunnels doing down there?
Hope you and your familly's are safe. That's all i have to say.
Good documentry
Can they not do spectrum analysis on the rock to determine origin
Its the Millennium Falcon.
It's one of Godzilla's eggs that are scattered around the world's oceans wating for the right time to hatch.
Going the way of the History Channel. 👽
Han Solo knows where the Falcon is
Its obviously an underwater bigfoot nest used by male mermaids to signal the loc Ness monster to give the go ahead to aliens so that can safely descend from space and make crop circles. It's a very amazing and powerful object that answers so many questions. Well done!
Star cruiser escape pod
It is clearly swamp gas reflecting the light of Venus' third moon. And if you believe that I'll tell you another.
Maybe a lid to a submarine??
57 minutes of speculation
There are some very sick people around. People with nothing better to do but make someone's life a misery. These people don't have a life, so try to destroy others lives. They spend their lives in front of a computer looking for victims. So they were disappointed..that's life. Life is full of disappointments. Deal with it. As for me, I enjoyed the vid. I didn't start out with high expectations..so wasn't disappointed. I was simply interested.
Stump of a giant tree...
Um.. Dennis is a frikking loon....
It's the FALCON..
This is a remnent of a long forgotten civilization. Millenia ago, people were advanced enough to make these things and cataclysm took them out. Earths crustal displation is one theory as to why they may have died out. And would explain why this is at the bottome of a place modern people think it shouldn't be.
The millennium falcon!
Jag er Danska bor i Florida.Fox nyheter er saa dum. de har inte rigtige journalister. Keep on going!

6000 dives over 30 years is 200 dives a year thats some diving.
Tak!
Theory one:  Intergalactic traveler crash lands on a glacier on Earth that e-v-e-n-t-u-a-l-l-y ends up deposited by the moving glacier, on the ground far away from initial landing site, that later becomes inundated by glacial melt water and eventually a vast sea.    Theory two:  It could be that the surviving and stranded alien pilot then took a wife from amongst the indigenous people, became “Adam”, and with “Eve”, the first parents of our species.   Believe
It's the Ebon Hawk
Gulf of Bosnia?
More junk from the Eric Von Dumkin school of "journalism".
Go ask John Travolta and Tom Cruise for the money. They are a part of the UFO religion. I am being serious.. don't let idiots put you off your search for the truth :)
It's a total nothing burger. Just a bunch of guys trolling around looking for something to do.
It looks like a doorway cut into it
before we we judged the first time  (by water)  we had amazing tech.... so amazing God saw fit to divide the people into different languages putting us back to technological darkness for another 5000+ years.... we are only recently coming out of that darkness ... and it won't end well again you can bet
The mysterious object beneath the Baltic Sea ?   Not a mystery at all, it's the Nordstream gas pipelines blown up by the US and the UK.
Thanks for letting me know before I started Watching it. Not going to waste my time.
this was a stupid waste of time with no solid conclusion.
"It raises more questions than answers..." It looks man-made but can be a case of pareidolia?  Anyhow, the people who threaten Peter and Dennis' families are cowards of the worst kind...
They've found giant tank tracks on the sea bed before
The fact that the Navy scrambled a ship to go see what they were doing pretty quick smart says to me that theres something in the area that they're willing to be quite intimidating in order to put passive aggressive pressure on people to get out of there. Well done for staying toe to toe with them!
the Yonaguni Monument comes to mind when watching this
In comparison with national finances the cost of a proper investigation of this is miniscule. The countries around the Baltic and whoever wants to aid with funding (I'm talking billionaires and other countries) should fund, say, 100 mil. I mean, the cost just to send that military ship to investigate them likely exceeded 500k euro to the taxpayer.
Har NI forsökt kalkulera vikten på det där objektet? Och det där märkvåardiga, at båda anomalierna utvisar SKIDMARKS?  Är dom sjunkat ill botten i vatten, eller i frit fald i en vinkel til fasta jorden, nån gång på bronzålder, när östersjön var torr?
It is probably a 19th century Russian Circular warship.  ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5AUGq4Voeg
unbelievably stupid for a shipwreck treasure hunter for not owning even a handheld gps.  i would have recorded the initial coordinates during the initial discovery, thus, you can find it again next time and not waste large amount of time finding it again.
Plot twist! They actually found a second spaceship on the ocean floor.
Han Solo entered the chat…
We could not identify it immediately so, it must be a U.F.O.
millennium falcon
What I don't understand are people who seem to threaten the lives of answer seekers like these. The search for answers likely would have no impact on these AH. Maybe they just get some sort of warm fuzzys imagining the stress and paranoia they might be causing another person. But in this fractured world fanaticism cannot be simply ignored. It's like a movie star that ends up with a stalker that ends up attacking the person who they are obsessing over.  The other thing are those like FOX sticking their nose in, creating an image of something and that image is fake and close to impossible to exist as a factual image but people don't stop to wonder, they don't stop to think of the conditions or what the bottom of the ocean is like. This is why The Deep Fake Technology is so dangerous. People are stupid and until their face ends up in a photo or video they never had anything to do with that they'll begin to understand that taking photos and articles 100% as factual is stupid at worst and dangerous at best. I wish these intrepid answer seekers the best. Even if this is just a natural thing, they'll have added to the cumulative knowledge of man.
*_I saved myself almost an hour, skipped to end... no UFO ... duh..._*  Natural formations can be stranger than fiction. Remember the underwater stepped pyramid by Japan, or the road near Bimini. Natural occurring underwater formations.   *_Anyone who really thought it was a UFO needs to get their head checked._*
Hasn't this same documentary been on several channels here on YT? Pretty sure this is several years old.  In any case, nothing definitive about this object has been proven.
Everything is just speculation.
They tell you that they find no answers in the first two minutes! Saves time.
it is a rock formation that by an astounding coincidence looks like an imaginary spaceship from a popular sci-fi movie series.
Millenium Falcon?
❤️
There has to be a Gofundme or something similar to this for everyone to chip in even $1 to fund more research!! I’m sure they would get millions very quick from people all around the world!!   If so, please share the link!
Nothing new
GPS?
Looks to me like the Ebon Hawk
I don't think your a hoax . But keep your family safe buddy. These government will kill you .
We will never find out if it was a ship or not anyways
It definitely bear further investigation.
I enjoy learning about things like this.  Maybe it’s a relative of the Millinium Falcon.
Maybe whatever it is was formed millions of years ago when that part of the sea was land mass, like an ancient active volcano toppled by a glacier a few ice ages ago? That might explain the seemingly split mountainous ridges in line with the mass being the remnant of the volcanoe cone taking into mind the eons of erosion? Most of the rest of the ancient volcano deeply buried beneath the sediment and spread over a much greater area.
That ship looks familiar
It's a crash site...no such thing as coincidences.
The way the main stream media attacked them it's like the didn't want them to find out.
It's nothing but the imagination is gone wild. He doesn't know what it is? It's a freaking rock. Hello
Who can threaten a father to harm his child? I can't imagine how upset this father is. They are really brave. And I think they have already realized that access to information has made people more stupid. They hoped to find answers by making it public, but in the end they realized that secrets should not be made public because the majority are stupid.

Hahahahhahahaha, it looks like the Millenium Falcon.
No one thinks the title pic isn’t the Millennium Falcon? Are Jedi real too?
Seems project X has been suppressed from who I don’t know but for sure that this finding is too good and lucrative for a tv station not to get involved in supporting and producing a real life Serie like oak island
Unfortunately it’s just a rock formation to save you some time
I remember watching this the year they discovered it. Has there been any updates to the anomaly? It must be a shame to leave it as such. The 3D scans are very compelling. 💯💚💯
The Klingons have finally arrived! I knew they were coming.
Looks like it could be A  Klingon Bird of Prey.
Lots of 'sharing the adventure' of the search and the background, not much on the main thing in the title of the post.
:)  You don't get any answers, just more questions.  Why do I think of Mulder from the X Files?
Good one for sure.
Looks like a bunch of rocks.
I new that the millennium falcon was real!
Sooo... FOX is behind of the disprovement report... Now that's something to take note of. And nasa... They got to have a water counterpart. So sad for the bashers, close minded schmucks. Research and discovery takes an amount of time.
It's an ancient construction from the Preflood World, I believe.  As for the assinine detracting and debunking on Fox "News" and other sources calling it "a pile of rocks" are clearly the work of the Deep State which does not want this anomaly or its implications to come to light
SPOILER ALERT 🚨 ngl it was mildly interesting until about 35:00 where dude calls off the mission due to fog like a cuck. What a waste of my life.
It's the Millennium Falcon daa!
OMG!!  It's the Millenium Falcon!!!!
Onviously an alien craft, or a human craft from before the last civilization catastrophic reset
A meteor
Thank you.  Sorry to see so many trolls wasting space in Comments.
They where shut down by the Swedish Gov a long time ago.  Electric equipment was even disrupted down there
Jus wasted an hour, bullshits of a charlatan's. That's just natural sea bed and he knows what a hack is that.
I pray this will have a positive part two. With a successful conclusion. “ may the force be with you “!
Well Children? What have learned from this? Bugger all springs to mind... Thanks very much,,!!
👍
I bet it is ," The M- Falcon"? I know it hasn't been seen since ," The Empire Strikes back"?  Getting back at everyone? Made this show out of vindictiveness ?
Antykera Mechanism  turned out to be a calendar for the run up to the next Olympic games. This probably relates to the World Cup.
Wasting people's time with this," History channel" type nonsense!  Get it together girls?  Why not just charting L&L? I forgot, You have to use one of those POS GPS things now!?
Well Done to all of the Team and those who financed it all!!  🏆🏆🏆 A lot of work went into it as well as those who risked their lives diving down into the ocean 🎓👏🙏
0:52 looks just like the Ebon Hawk from the video game Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, but the ship was lost a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. No seriously, this anomaly is fascinating. Is it natural? An artificial object? Is it the remains of a past civilization that got wiped out in the cycle of cataclysms every 12,000 years? So many questions, extremely few answers unfortunately.
looks like a gate
It looks like a rock formation
Its a shame that we never heard the end of this story, even though it was over 10 years ago that the dive was made.  If there was any chance that it could be alien, then governments would have swarmed around it to dig it out.
Dirk Pitt has beaten you to it
Yes a really old crash site to my eyes......
I believe you   all   wish I had the money to help u guys out . Don't give up.. Government started this LIE something is there they Don't want you finding/ It's not just the people. Bet a lot of negative comments are Bots .
This is obviously some kind of a temple or building it's a megalithic structure just like the hundreds of other megalithic structures on this planet
this is quite a few years old. Still no news on what it is in 2023
most of this video is bloated filler that could have been summed up in a few seconds... Skip to 51:44 for the summary.
The intensity of filth thrown at these people shows that someone is afraid of "insignificant rock".  You don't invest so much primitive, ugly hatred, proving that it is "merely a rock".
Bet its some relic of the war. Submerged and hidden gun emplacement perhaps? Can be re-floated when the tanks are pumped out
IT is part of moon and we all know that moon is made of chees and chees melt when it fall from moon to earth
The Pyramids and Stonehenge are just rocks, too.
It looks like a helmet from columbus.
Hi. Go to 54:57, pause, look at the picture. They found a giant D. Thats all you need to know.
Even if it's a meteor strike it still should be investigated
Glacier picked that up and it melted into place looks like a bronze age grain processing holes in it
Crash sight ok of a meteor
Launch pad conforming with contour of craft
Indeed, why don't universities insist on examining this geology structure, on taking the probe for laboratories...It would help us immensely understand glacial and post-glacial geology.  Talking about planet Earth, of course, what else?
I like watching it...but why are people so narcissistic to think, that spaceship would look like what we always envisioned....like a millenium falcon. A factual approach would be, that the next civilization has a huge chance of being far away...and they would either send probes and AI or they at least make the best out of the features of space. With that in mind most probably spacecraft will be cubis or perhaps ballshaped for efficiency. It is also hypotheticao but it would make more sense to search for such things instead of millenium falcons.
Contact American Film Maker/Ocean Explorer James Cameron, to go to Sea bottom and get samples to bring up. His Challenger has descended 10,927 metres. He has construction tools carry bigger pieces than just a few rocks. 🤙🏾👍🏿👌🏼💪👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🧢⚓️⛴
So frustrating, but deu to the history it was once totally frozen place As a glacier  and they moved huge opjects so this dregging line looks like that possibly. But it's still frustrating to accept.
It’s the millennium falcon. Duh!
Who calls it a U FO
Looks like white landing strips to it's right!
It’s a piece of a barg. Possibly Royal.
Part 2?
Thanks!
Why you gotta stretch it out all day with all the dumb stuff ? It’s like somebody put water in my soda , along with a booger and a piece of cheese .
It is obviously the Millennium Falcon.
Old, old news... click bait.
Occam's razor : The simplest solution is probably the right solution.  This is a rock that was carried there by expanding glaciers and when they melted, the rock just fell in the sea.  Not an outlandish guess considering this entire area was covered by a kilometer of ice 100 000 years ago.
Its a rock, get over it!
Foto is fake
Has to be the worst video on YouTube you find out absolutely nothing it is a total waste of
Its ether the master chiefs helmet, a old temple, and or the millennium falcon.
Why is the music with these programs always so obnoxiously loud and bombastic?
Stop using AI reading programs.  If you can't splurge on a human being to narrate then don't bother
One rov and we would have answers but nnooooooo
i think its an Angel ship,that went down during Noah's flood....from meteors and valcanic activity 4350 years ago    but the world gov wants to keep these secret
But we will see the Wonder soon, outside are so many informations , to many .
I can say WHO knows and Cover together with Goverments, the Smithsonian, WHO Global Events for Humanity to Cover to Behold our Believe and disturb your Imagine make you Crazy Depression in your Mind . They know , you need Evidenz for yourself to Believe , Corona crisis isoliert People , let them see TV what Tell them its unreal . Psychologic tricks
It seems that all the depictions of this anomaly have been digitized to the point that it really doesn’t look that sharp and clear.
I remember when this first came up on the news and how exciting it was. Then I lost track. Much later I thought the expatiation to examine this anomaly stopped because where it was located was too dangerous to send divers. After watching this video I'm so disappointed how the general public was easily deceived to except the lie that it was a pile of rocks.  Really? One detail I keep thinking about is the portal inside that frame one of the divers pointed out. Would a pile of rocks make that happen? I truly believe it is something not from our world. Further, I also believe there are governments who clearly want ownership of that 'pile of rocks' and launched a campaign to discredit Peter and Dennis. When fiction trumps science and fact, as it does with this story, you've got to be extremely concerned about who and why are putting so much effort into keeping the public ignorant.
New info needed badly, we going on what 10-15 years
If you took a chunk off that anomaly would it be a titanium,carbide, chromium, beryllium composite or just a rock?
Does anyone else see the master chief helmet on the thumbnail
I'm looking at the sonar images on Google, it looks to me like something of a structure, maybe ritual or something. If they know when, if any, part of the Baltic was ever above water, why couldn't it be man-made? Or maybe it was a small island, used and modified for whatever reason, that would explain the steps. But, a glacier can carve strange patterns in stone Time for an HD multi-beam side scan sonar
So what's the consensus please ???  Natural or Artificial ?
Far to many Adverts....
My problem Ward.  You just called this General  Duke Nukem
Well that was pointless!
It's the millennium falcon. Clearly
Threatening Emails? lol he should post all of them lol
I'm very impressed with their efforts and wish them success in all their endeavors. It's sad how many people can become so cynical and dark when they are not part of something so interesting. The threats are criminal and some would say some intelligence agencies wanted the site for themselves and did a covert smear campaign and used threats to discourage and discredit the sincere efforts made by this team. I hope they keep plugging away through the fog of life to some answers.  If I had the money needed I'd finance them. Sadly I don't.
Way cool
And here we are 12 years later with the video.
I'm about 2 minutes in and the narrator just pronounced UFO as "u-foe".........I'm out. Enjoy the video
Good afternoon from Syracuse NY USA brother and everyone I am sorry you are going through this because I was hoping to hear about your core samples
Any 'uneducated' person can clearly see that this looks like a crash sight 👍 Millennium Falcon....lol
"It's concrete"... rules out the UFO fantasy then, lol
That’s the grenade launcher from doom eternal.
I'm sorry you all have to deal with some many people that have such a negative attitude for what you have discovered, I don't see a pile of rocks , But i know more needs to be done, I don't have much, But i would purchase merchandise to help, Don't give up I'll be waiting and praying for all of you, GOD BLESS and GODS SPEED !!!!!
It is a shrine to the Millennium Falcon.  The previous civilization knew all about that galaxy far far away
Obviously an alien craft.   I'm sure it was all part of the Russian collusion hoax.
It's probably one part of a big building? This man needs know all buildings were once cut from one stone
So disturbing that some damn idiot would threaten that man & his family over an innocent undersea exploration.  Agree or disagree - fine.  Threaten children - sick.  I've always thought the thing DOES look like the Millennium Falcon.  Lucas must have been poking around in the Baltic.
0:50 "And it looked like a UFO." No it's no flying so it's just a UO (unidentified object.)
It looks like that thing in the bamboo forest of Japan.   Sorry for the propaganda against your investigations. You realize "they" don't want us to know our advanced past.
I think it's a bubble of lava from an underwater volcano that froze in the very cold water.
Don’t stop looking! When people start threatening to stop you from asking questions you are on the right path. I think Graham Hancock needs to look at this
The needler from Halo, one of the grunts had to throw it away to try and run. :)
They found the Millennium Falcon at the bottom of the Gulf of Bothnia?
It's geological, like the formation off the coast of Japan. They look 'manufactured' because of pareidolia, the inclination of humans to see recognisable things in random formations, like faces in trees and dragons in clouds... Interesting, though. Maybe take a proper look and THEN do a documentary on what it is..?
10 to 12'000 years ago the world's water was 400+feet lower so at some point that was probably dry land. It could be the top of something or an alter.
I'm pretty sure he said, hey guys, we have found the Millennium Falcon !!
It could be a cap stone. The people who doubt him are just proof of our primitivity and blindness. I want to believe! 🖖
I looked at the comments before watching then didnt watch. If they dont have the answer then its a waste of my time.
That's The Millennium Falcon   Score!
I was very upset that there were grown adults sending threatening emails, especially when you Aime it at children ( you are then the lowest person on Earth )  .
It’s the Millennium Falcon, of course, lying derelict after falling through a wormhole. It proves that George Lucas’ design was spot on.
It’s the Millennium Falcon
If it were "geology or glacial anomaly", it would have been investigated with scientific submarines long ago.
No answers, and no prospect of answers. What a waste of time and disappointment
Looks like The Millinium Falcon from Star Wars!
Get Elon to pull it up
WELL IF THIS CRASH SITE IS SEVERAL MILLION OR A BILLION YEARS OLD, THEN IT WOULD LOOK LIE THAT! ITS POSSIBLE ANCIENT ALIENS USED STONE TO MAE THEIR CRAFT! UMOAMOA..THAT CYLINDER SHAPED OBJECT THAT SLINGSHOT ITSELF THRU OUR SOLAR SYSTEM WAS ALSO MADE OF ROCK BUT IT TRANSMITTED RADIO WAVES AND CHANGED TRAJECTORY AND SPEED!
I think the discovery style documentaries, that stretch the topic and repeat 1000 times the same thing only to give the answer in the last 5 minutes, must be fined for wasting time.
Perhaps they can spark Steven Spielberg's interest in getting involved. 🤔
It's just a rock formation. It's a frigging anomalies
Am I the only one who thought this was going to be a viral campaign for Halo?
I'd smoke it
They should do a give send go fundraising
I was excited to get more details about this object, but you made it a drama thing, so I'm out after two minutes.
There's a lot of things that we don't know and there's a lot of people that will never let us know
An example of the destructive nature of misinformation.
Man made.
Nothing.
Comeon the amount of millionaires increased by 30% in the last 20 years. You want to tell me that no one came forward with a million dollar to found out what it is? There is someone preventing it. I bet you the US navy was already down there or the Chinese.
Im no professional, but to me it just looks like some large rocks that just happen to have ended up like that
Leave it to Fox News! I stopped watching them after the 2020 Presidential Election because and their clear Bias towards then President Trump. After seeing that they called this object out to the world as a rock, and ruined this very important expedition, It only reinforces what I already knew about Fox News! This needs to be investigated, and Fox News needs to leave the final word of these expeditions and studies, to real Scientists! Like they say in the News business, "there is no such thing as small stories, just small Reporters!"
Glad I skipped to the end , to find the real story, instead of the trash, you opened this story .
The Millennium falcon lol
It's off Cuba in the gulf of big smash, is real , is us, a deluge before a deluge ,after...cuba...Argentina..many old megalithic in our oceans..note bird, insect  migrations to Carolina, Kentucky, as well as monarch butterfly, all have math to nexus worldwide and over courses of thousands of year ref. Carl  Munck ..the code..
Unanswered  - World History Documentaries
This is the legacy of Discovery networks.  Quasi-scientific documentaries which have more in common with reality TV than Nova or BBC documentaries.  Utter trash.
Ask Elon Musk for funding....
He could try reaching out to truth seeker's . Mystery Hystory.  Steven Greer.  With archaeological experts id like to see.  Any other channels guy? . ...Ya can send video and pics to reputable sites.  A good one for news is secureteam10,  Mystery Hystory II , Lex Fidman
Float that suckered to the surface and let's get to the truth
We shouldn't have to sell it with fake aliens in order to get a core sample. A geological explanation is worth the investment.
obviously it's the millennium falcon. that damn wookie must've gotten lost and crash landed here. that explains bigfoot sightings as well.
A whole hour spent asking questions…
mellion falcon from starwars..
It's the millennium falcon, duh.
Looks like the millennium falcon
underside of the roof of a ww2 concrete pillbox. nothing to see here.
I think they mean a USO. Unidentified Submerged Object. A UFO is flying. This one is not flying.
Are you serious ?it is OBVIOUS WHAT THAT IS!!!!!
The thumbnail looks like a Halo plasma pistol
millennium falcon
Fox even screws up exploration in the Baltic!
I don't trust these 'entrepeneur' kind...most likely forged for his own sake.
The Ebon Hawk 😬
So THAT'S where I parked the Millennium Falcon!
Omg me too Dennis.i see a crash site
I understand the function of science to move slowly and not jump to conclusions, but when the establishment in any science refuses to consider new evidence and circles the wagons of small mindedness and lack of open thought, it's sad and not what science is supposed to be. There is often jealousy and anger arising,  jumping up to attack a fellow and it doesn't speak well for many sciences. Why does ego seem to drive the process so often? The further idea that persons unknown would threaten anyone's life in scientific discourse is serious and exposes what goes beyond ego and into what can only be called hidden agenda.
Its a borg frequency modulator. ST:O players will know what I mean.
Bro it's a rock wtf really people
Keep looking. Some people are malicious. They are afraid of everything. I hope you find out what it is. Good luck
so basically bunch of gold diggers looking for treasure instead of trying to solve wtf it actually is, nexttttttttttt
It looks like a rock formation to me.
Fox News can suck it!!!!
This is absolutely amazing!  Please don’t listen to all of the ignorant nay-sayers!  The answer may be astonishing!!!
Is there any current information on this?  Were they able to eventually examine the object or area in more detail?
When things are about to get serious, fake news kicks in .   Way the go Fox, and your mad cows, and troll occult of deniers
You lost me at "it looked like a UFO", it looked like an unidentified flying object... under the sea? What you really meant is alien spaceship and that annoys me because UFO does not equal aliens...
It’s The Millennium Falcon!
Ik this is a genuine discovery but I see master chief's helmet
Foreshadowing the next Halo game
It's not an unidentified flying object.  It looks like a Corellian light freighter.
This object dates between 1598 and 1623, a phenomenon. "  molto rumore per nulla"
Millennium falcon. No doubt.
I was wondering where I left that.
Pumice
Millennium Falcon…
So that's where I left it. Can you guys give me the exact coordinates so I can get back home?
This is lame
Why have the police not arrested the scum who have threatened him and his family
No new images. No new investigation. No new scans. Just a regurgitated story from 2012 that wasted my lunch break. 👎
Interesting it is.
It’s obviously the millennium falcon
that would be a Corellian YT-1300
I have to say I am not a UFO chaser. And I don't know what is down there. But it dose look like a crash site. Or possibly it was caused by a Glacier. It seems odd that the shape is round though. I hope they can get funding to take a better and longer look.
Looks to me like a unique asteroid crash that took out a mountain and mangled it self into that ridge and eventually that object and thats why it does not look like the traditional impact crater.
Looks like the Millennium Falcon to me
Very tantalizing, indeed!  Hope you dive again and share it with us.  Thanks for a great video!
Look like a "You-foe" ?? Are there really Brits who pronounce UFO like this?
Looks like stone look at the surrounding area
Millennium falcon
That captain seems like a total douche.
Remember ... when one of us wins, we ALL win! And fools do not have a clue either!
Oh no! The dreaded oofow 😂
Sounds like someone doesn't want you do really find out what is really down there. Ask the people on You tube to help.  I only have a few dollars but if it can help you can have it.
Its an hours worth of people standing around and no pictures of the object
TL;DR = 🤷🏻‍♂️
The Ebon Hawk
The  Enterprise time traveled back and crashed.
Some UFOs are made of rock like an asteroid class
Spoiler: they never figure it out.
Isnt it obvious? Its the millennium falcon....
Duh - it’s the Millenium Falcon.
Obviously it's a McDonald's!
Obviously the early generation milenium falcon
Gees, everyone knows this is the Millinium Falcon!
bravo,  guys  !   (no  women  ..  ?)
it's a spaceship of some sort ... It dont really matter what it is ... It won't get you into Heaven and guarantee you that. ..... Who wants to bet .......??????
Timeline, for when you want to spend an hour watching someone solve a mystery only to never solve it and be left with more questions than answers.
That is how they are keeping citizens of Earth in darkness and hiding the truth. It is an UFO for sure
It's a hoax people, Jesus.
That's Hons Ship
It's clearly ancient crashed UFO.... scientist will tell us that is not what we see 😂😂😂
This thing was discovered a long time ago (old news) I really thought this documentary was forthcoming with facts/admissions as to what it is.
Spacecraft designed for atmospheric entry are wrapped in some form of porous refractory, usually carbon foam, chipping away the space shuttle would look just like a rock. Can't wait for the core drill to shed some answers
It's space junk from the 60's. It's a wing from Saturn 5 rocket .
So we can god down to where the Titanic lies on the ocean floor and repeatedly film the giant ship from all angles in great detail....but somehow we cannot do the same with this...ummm...yeah...  Doe the same, get it filmed and photographed from all angles, take core samples from the site and define it to be rock or alien...
Looks like something from the halo universe.
FOXNEWS reported it a rock? They distract from real issues with hate! Then with the interest, other followers? It's not a coincidence. What harm is there intended business, ah,... of looking? The people who contacted FOXNEWS know! Follow the money they say. Someone will have a REASON for this!
I think I've seen this in Ancient Aliens, but can be mistaken? Did they find it in 2020?
Don't  give. Up guys.  A. Lot. Of. People are praying for. You...to. Find out answers..🙏
eny one thinking its aliens are idiots  enyone sending vile message's should be locked up n i dont think eny answer would be boring
Oh, man, they need funding to go back down there, we NEED to know what it is. Even if it is pure geology, it looks super weird and interesting, and definitely worth studying. Whatever it is, we will learn something about the Baltic. If it is a glacial erratic, it´s for sure by far the largest I´ve ever heard of. If it is volcanism, that would be a sensation, and we should know when it happened. If it´s recent (like within the last 50 million years, that would be sensational. Then again, the bedrock in the baltic is extremely old, if we could find out about geological processes frozen in time from 2 billion years ago, that would also be super interesting. There are so many good reasons to get the heck back down there. I am tingling. I need to know what it is. It is maddening to see they had to suffer so much abuse from small minds for their curiosity. It´s sad. Curiosity brought us to the moon, thereis nothing wrong with curiosity. Crushing a person´s soul for their curiosity is evil.
Well, it's definitely not the Millennium Falcon.
Look up YouTube channel creater earth creater of channel godgevlamste he has great information about stuff like this...
It looks like the millennium falcon, that both weird and suspect.
It's the millenium falcon, everybody can see that.
This was not ready for a documentary. They also made a bad mistake telling the world about the initial find. This work is extremely important.
The fact they and their kids are being threatened makes me almost certain they found something someone didn’t want them to find
Have they tried to start a Go Fund Me?
Fox News lies to everyone again and their viewers instantly believe their bullsh*t.
Why can't money be raised to solve the mystery once and for all, drill and see if there is anything under the rock/concrete/shield ?  Why should everything be ridiculed.
Clearly, it's the Millennium Falcon.
halo  gun :)
It's a mud fossil.  Giant blood platelets.
Is there a follow up to this?
Don't let public opinion get in the way, guys, even the greatest minds like Tesla were a laughing stock! And for all you know, it's probably government agencies behind the ridicules!
The fact that they keep thinking it's a circular spaceship just reminds me of Ancient Aliens.
Vore fantastisk om ni kunde få möjlighet att fortsätta. Intressant både ur vetenskapligt och historiskt perspektiv och inte minst för er själva och ”gå till botten” med vad det kan tänkas vara samt att ni får ett avslut på er upptäckt.
Calling Elon Musk. Please fund this.
Anybody know if there is an update investigation on this?
The first thing I thought was that it looks like the yonaguni monument.  Italso looks like square pyramids with stairs and surrounding ramparts to make it look round.
Rather watch the other show where they actually dive down on this object!!
That what I thought when I found this on google earth a wreck
Looks like a ancient underwater city sprawled out with roads connecting other buildings you can see the outline of where the structures once sat sea level probably wasn't that deep thousands of years ago these were probably built on top of hillsides at the time and that dip in the sonar image at the far end was probably a fresh water lake at one time got to calculate how many thousands of years would it take for the sea level to rise 300ft then you would get the age of the structures
I couldn't give up on it.
I know it not a hoax because I found it on google earth.
I don't agree with them I searched the ocean on Google Earth. Year's back I found this I saved the picture of it I think it us something else .I think someone don't want you to go farther.
This mystery just won't go away... so strange.. last time I heard Norway or Sweden were going to fund an investigation.. the truth will set us free...
What if the volcanic stone is a form of heat shield  ? Much like the shuttle space craft. It's a much to drill into it to find out once and for all.
I live on the west coast of Norway and I can show you some even more crazy rocks. But that's it. Rocks. There are so many rocks one is bound to encounter one that happens to look like something we think we recognise.
Looks like a crash site to me too 😉👍
That image on the sonar isn't actually what the object looks like, does it? Cus why haven't seem real actual pictures of the thing?
All great things are held suspect at first, maintain your faith!
A lot of space craft and other items lunched from the earth into orbit may have worn out and fall back to the earth perhaps into the oceans that may seem like alien objects
I do not get why they are angry that an article said they found a rock. That is exactly what they found. They found some igneous rock.
here's a question: since it looks to be made of molten rock, perfect in shape, as if man-made... what if when it crashed, going through that mountain at such speed, the hull would had been so hot at re-entry that the rocks from said mountain with the environment elements simply melted onto its form? stupid idea, but heck, i just had to throw it out there.
It's a halo helmet.. Stop tripping lol
It's obviously the Millennium Falcon, or of that ship class.  Could be a sister ship...the Millennium Raptor or Millennium Hawk perhaps 🤔🧐🙃
Having watched it all the way through I hope that there work is taken more serious and not as a joke and funds to do more dives is made available and this story continues and continues till answers are made
What if it is an ancient road when the pathway and the object was on the surface?  In Michigan they found an underground forest in Lake Huron and an ancient Stonehenge in Lake Michigan.  I would donate to a core drilling.  You should do a go fund me page.
Wow, a misinformation campaign to put people on the wrong track to cover up something. Boy, we haven't seen anything like that recently.  Obviously, it is something the governments do not want us to know about.  Looks like a large space ship to me. These men should go on Joe Rogan.
Blimey,  it's the millennium falcon
See how it fares in the kessel run and maybe your mystery will be solved
I see straight lines meeting in right angles, and as far as I know nature have never created things like this. It must have been made by intelligent beings.
This is horrible, they're just doing research why are these idiots so intimidated. Well if Fox News says something about you then you're pretty much doing something right cuz they're a bunch of right-wing nutcases and extremist.  Calling them news is giving them way too much credit they're fox propaganda channel.
Why don't they just contact James Cameron who is a nut about deep sea diving and underwater exploration. It's not as if he doesn't have the money to fork out to find an answer. The worst thing these guys did was to go public and get all the lunatics involved. I knew from the very start of watching this that we weren't going to get any concrete answers. Not once did they state how much it would cost to seriously explore. Doesn't sound as if they even care to find out anymore, nor prove it wasn't some hoax. They just don't want anyone else sharing the credit or else they would have contacted everyone possible to garner interest in further exploration. They're sounding like children who simply do not want to share.🇦🇺🕊
So that's where han solo parked the millenium falcon😅
One thing is certain; the object traveled almost 1/4th mile before it rested, shown by its long skid marks. It either moved itself or was moved by something else.  It couldn't be a glacial movement over a giant rock because the 2nd similar object should have left a skid mark parallel to the skid marks of the 1st object, but both traveled in different directions. I would guess it's an alien spacecraft which petrified itself over a million or billions of years leaving no trace of radiation and is now turned into rock.
So that's where han solo parked the millenium falcon😅
Alien wish is like God wish. When either wish to show themselves is when we will know what their reality and ours really is. A God visiting, sages tell us we should kill. Aliens, I hope, will not meet a fearful, religious and uncivilized world like we have now.
The spirit of adventure lives in these individuals and I hope they continue the search. The world has become a boring place, and we need more adventures like Dennis and Peter. I believe they stumbled upon something for sure, and even if its never reveled, we need these mystery's of the unknown in our lives to keep wonder alive!
Its Megatron
This is very titillating! But if it was E.T. craft your military buddies would have already grabbed it up.
What about the second object  spotted in the Baltic  Sea?
This  anomaly  is  similar  to  the...Aumuamua ...a Cigar  Shaped  object of March  14 ,2019 and  this  anomaly  is  probably  of the  same  Composition  and  could be a  Alien 👽  Aircraft
13.25 boat powered by peddle power... Brilliant informative video
It didn’t look like a ‘ufo’ it looked very vaguely like a known craft out of Sci fi  films, namely the Millennium Falcon. Then the wild stories began . If it been any more than an interesting rock formation the worlds military would be all over it , civilians wouldn’t get near it.
I can tell you exactly what this is.  It is a Nephilim “Starfort.”   Many in plain sight across the world.  Some on land, actually many on land.  SE USA.  After the flood the Nephilim were/are still will us.  There are no aliens.  Only “fallen angel/Nephilim.”
More youtube bs. The strructure was long ago investigated and determined to be made of stone. Please don't confuse this bs channel with the real History Channel.
11 years later and the answer is?
I searched through the comments hoping to find some real star wars fans but all I found were people who don't know their spaceships .-.
If you believe in god, then start to ask why he made a million galaxies just to waste and only earth with life in it. If you don't believe in god, it's even more interesting, isn't it?  Whatever the answer is, if it is only speculation, we always have to remember that any probability can be the real answer.
lol
That's where the great Darth Revan, conduit of the force, crashed on earth while searching for the sith emperor. That's straight up the Ebon Hawk, come on
Maybe it’s a kimberlite pike and you have diamonds around the edges giving a strong signal like steel . The missing parts may suggest that it has already been tested by prospectors.
I feel quite certain that I know what it is.
How to get funding.
To the last few real explorers ...I hope  you find money soon. Without people like you , humanity would still be in caves.
Can anyone say WHAT this is? It's been going around Utube for years and no one has given a difinitive answer. Surely in the last 10 + yrs. this has been looked at scientists they could come to some conclusion.
byt ut skolengelskan  till svenska    och sluta upp med att vara så menlösa  med alla era gissningar
There is no way it belongs there. The simple fact that there is a huge track like its slid in. Why does everyone forget that part?
Looks like the millennium falcon
Was looking for more information on this anomaly! Thank you for the video!
Judging by their search pattern and how long it took them to find the target again , I would say that navy ship stopped directly over the target 🤔
I doubt a spaceship would be made of stone
Get Elon Musk interested in it and offer him the anti gravity motors for recovering it !
Right off the bat ,they should brought down a sling and some hooks and airbags and tried lifting it a couple hundred feet s they could tow it into shallow water. Then they could take their time examining it ! Obviously just the extraterestial metal would be worth a kings ransome . Never mind the anti gravity drive system ! It's still the most valuable object on Earth !
simply, illegal dumping. that is a large pile of demolished buildings/whatever. the boat that dumped there drug its anchor and chain across the big pile while leaving, that is what made the straight line. look at the line thru the big pile, you can see how debris is moved from one side to the other. the small pile is from cleaning the boat before returning.
No one sends threatening messages over a pile of rocks. There is something they don´t want him to find.
Very unusual knowing nature typically does not form  Horizontal and parallel lines even circular and squared  all in one object seemingly out of place Possibly man-made ancient structural ruins surrcomed to oceans rising...
This must be the dullest exploration docu I've ever seen. First, as a diver myself, we all know it's a cool rock. As a geologist, yes I'd explore it anyway. But be real about it, sure there are Alien species 100%, but this is just nonsense. It's clearly a rock, and we knew that 10 years ago when we first saw this.  Can we get a docu about Kathleen Martinez and the hunt for Cleopatra? How about, docu on USA war crime history, they make up 100 episodes. Or a docu on how corrupt Zahi Hawass is, and his lies that we know about today? You to scared for that? Documentary on David Attenborough, the man is a legend, and deserves to be the president of the world. Documentary about Nazi's in USA and where did they end up, producing what, so much material. Documentary about Betty and Barney Hill.   SO much to record! If you need help, I can step in with my team, we can record new things, just let me know.  Looking at these lifeless Swedes all dried up from happiness, I feel sorry for them.   Love the channel! One of my fav's! But I know you can do better than this!
The millennium falcon
There is a bottle of 1985 Jack Daniel's  sitting at the bottom of Robinson Lake in Oxford MA...
Can you use X-rays underwater? If you can, then they would detect a metal structure underneath any calcified rocks.
Setting out on such a task with a single side-scan radar unit seems lacking at best. If one is available back unsure then why aren't there are spares onboard? Forgive my ignorance if it is an expenditure but if it's even a consideration to trackback retrieve a new one and begin searching again then there's no reason you shouldn't have had a spare on board
Who cares if it is not a space ship,weather its a lava deposit an ancient temple or a meteor it deserves a serious scientific investigation.🤷‍♀️🇨🇷
A dolmen from the end of the ice age.
Y’all are blind, that thing is obviously the Millenium Falcon!
26:35 Ah... leave the high tech to the youngsters and find your accordeon (and possibly some wodka)  again skipper...
26:28 Congratulations ! Its a boy !
WHEN MEN FIND ROCKS...  To be continued...
Swedish range of emotion:  Sad - Hva faen... Distressed - Hva Faen. Neutral - Hva faen.  Happy - Hva faen! (grinning) Angry - Hva faen! (frowning) Bewildered/confused - Hva faen? Surprise - Hva i helvette!?
I just wasted an hour watching this and they never find out anything about what it is. Skip this video. It is all hyperbole and nothing more. What a let down.
Millennium falcon...  No doubt about it...
When people don't understand what they have in front of them, they need to imagine certain things familiar to them so that they can cope with the situation in front of them. Yes, the majority of people are not scholars, but average people. That structure on the bottom of the sea has clear visible "man-made" lines and shapes that we don't find in nature, at that degree of sophistication. From what I understand, both the US air force and the Swedish navy took a close interest on the object. So it must hold importance, only that it's been ridiculed so that to disperse any idea of its true significance.
Yes I think it's UFO spacecraft... only James Cameron or Elon musk could find the truth, who nose they could be 😜 doesn't matter what that is bring up to the surface. You did everything guys well done people says whatever they want but the time, effort  and money only you spend not them so don't mind them because they don't have that. Hope you will find the truth 💐💐💐💐
I looks like a hatch cover... Maybe it flew off a ginormous space ship...
Am sure they had GPS fix originally
Obviously that’s the Millennium Falcon, Star War doesn’t take place in our future, it takes place long ago in our past. 😉
Extraordinary work carried out by the diving team… all of it is so extremely expensive. Sadly an element of this shows just how ridiculous some humans can behave…. I’m proud of teams like this who are willing to take risks to find out things for themselves and share it with the rest of us who hasn’t got those abilities skills and finance to explore like this… Well done and thank you for this enthralling journey
What if the black stuff is actually melted rock from the pile before it. What if it's not volcanic rock but maybe just melted rock from that thing crashing through the mountain at a high rate of speed
Outstanding perseverance. It looks to me like what you need is a technology on the cutting edge. Maybe something not yet created. Or ... perhaps enlisting the interest of something like the Cousteau deep diving sub. They of course would need funding ... so perhaps another diving project could be piggybacked?  Keep going if you can.  Thank you for the work. I hope other treasure hunting projects can keep you in groceries etc.  The on line threats need to be given to authorities who can track internet crime.  Hope you have done that.  Start the day on the knees and leave it in the hands of our loving Lord. Then have peace ... and see what he will come up with ... or not ...  Keep alert, let go.
volcanic rock! did any of you other commenters actually watch this?
Maybe it's the top of a volcano that blew off
People with closed Mind's. They can Not handle anything that fly with there way of thinking
It would be interesting to do a core sample using a borehole
54:43 If you closely look at the 3d scans taken you can clearly see that it crashed there. Whatever it is.
It’s a star ship so old and damaged crashed along time ago it’s now not what it was
I don't think the US & Sweden Government will leave something like that alone.
50:28  gotta love the media, they take a scrap of information and create complete stories out of them, often very wrong, and people just swallow them up
😎👍👍
Anyone not eat up with conspiracy theories would have been able to look at the object and see that it was nothing more than a rock formation.
It's the Millenium Falcon
I guess Timeline is caving in just like the History Channel.
Too me looks like some sort of ancient geopolymer structure
A happy bunch trying to find the truth in what this object is are now ridiculed by both International authorities and Net-trolls. Wonder why?          So much of Human Historie are a blanck in people minds but I think we're starting to wake up now.
It looks like a cover-up is moving in on it.
This shows once again how dangerous Media fake news are. Fox put this scientific mission at risk, just to fill some paper space or hollow TV time. They must be ashamed of themselves for their lack of scruple, and for damaging - at the same time  - both significant scientific research and the lives mission of a few honest men. Folks: don't trust TV reports, until evidence is ripe enough to get real conclusions!
It’s the millennium falcon!
I don't know what it is and can speculate all day but I think regardless it should be discovered. Even if its rocks cut by ice or something. Then we can go Ah yes thats a thing, that what it looks like, what does that tell us... its better the humans understand more. ;p
It make sense that an airplane is made in metal. Make it so light as possible in a gravity environment. But in space between planets /solar systems    where gravity isn't that important? Maybe an ufo in stone makes more sense. Maybe rock shell protects better against radiation. Maybe a rocky surface protects better against small space debris.
Clearly its the Millennium Falcon
"100,000 wrecks in the Baltic sea" ... why would anyone make that utterly ridiculous claim?
This was 10 years ago. Most likely its now in the hands of greedy governments. They shouldve asked James Cameron. He has a team and does these kinds of deep sea exploration.
We are not there yet. We are a inferior civilization.
When that thing land it , there was no water .
Here's a thought 🤔 , yes it could be from a glacier and it was dropped there ......... Now hear me out , what if it is man made or made  by other creatures that were here before us . Maybe it was manufactured in the far past and just so happened to be deposited there long after that structure was abandoned. 👈👈👈👈
As always Fox news is the bearer of fake news 😂😂😂😂 nothing has changed since then 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Looks like the Millennium Falcon, from a galaxy far far away.
A "yoofoh"
It's the Millennium Falcon.
Still lookin... I would have thought they knew by now at least...

My God they found the millennial falcon!!!! 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆
It's so obvious it's a crash site. The thing is this exact same object has been captured many times in space around our moon and even going straight into the sun.. a rock could of been formed on the craft by going through the sun. To the narrow minded.....  Go do you your research you will see the exact same shape in SPACE..
It's the millennium falcon
It’s a very strange object and when they are found ,powers that be turn around and say it’s just rocks,or it’s come from the ice.Well they have been saying UFOs are just hot air balloons,or normal aircraft’s that we mistake .Yeah! And a pig just flew past my window..The best way they can assure no one gets funding for something they don’t want people poking their noses into is by announcing in the papers it’s a bit of rock moved there by melting ice.it’s a shame as I would have loved to have found out what was inside.That would have told you if it’s a rock or a piece of other world machinery.They have been watching us since the beginning of time.What a disappointment they must feel with all the wars and the constant murders going on..😢
Take Fox off the air  Disinformation channel
UFO? If it is sunk it isn't flying.  USO maybe i.e. unidentified sunk object  OR just rock which it most likely is.
'Like somebody molded it before it turned stone'.. sounds very much like all the megalithic monuments around the world. An lost civilization made them all.
...                                                                                                      50:30       STONES.   JUST LIKE STONENCHE. ... ...                                                                                                                        BUT MORE INTERESTING.
They loved drama not straight to the point
Threats online, actual threats, should be litigated.  It's so easy to type out a nasty message when you're some faceless troll.
An ultra secret pre-ww2  Soviet project involving a monstrously huge warship that was poorly designed and not subject to critical review because of fear of sticking one's neck out in the Stalin-Beria period.
its the millienium falcon yall stop f-ing around
This is gonna sound silly but that thing looks almost exactly like the millineum falcon from Star Wars
Graham Hancock would love to see this. The oceans rose 400 ft at the end of the last ice age. Could be another monolithic site.
I think it is like a run off some slide in that path.
At 46:00 no it’s not volcanic but similar bc when the object struck the ground it made such an impact(like a comet or meteorite) that it melted the rock. at 50:00 they do not want you revealing the truth about this anomaly bc they feel it is an alien craft and could spread a panic if the truth is revealed. Sorry guys but governments will do anything to stop or discredit you. I wish you luck ! A huge fan ! 🤙
Look into the eyes of the men that found this. You see only honest men that want awnsers to there discovery. So many have the finances to fund this project. But so many are selfish and can not see past there own bank account and greed. There is timeless truths to be discovered in this object.
...                                                                                         12:45        INCONCLUSIVE. ... ...                                                                                                                              THIS IS GREAT,  29:45   IS MADE OF STONE.
Millenium Falcon.
Incredibly interesting and even if it is something man-made the 3D sonar images raises so many questions. I'm surprised an angel investor hasn't yet come forward.
Ancient meteorite strike ..
Bro, that's the Millennium Falcon!!
Well, it could be the Millennium Falcon but we may never know.
Watching this is a Waste of time.
Don't trust the Swiss government.
WHen I was a kid, there was a really good cartoon about a mezoamerican civilization that had an airship made of stone. Probably the Olmecs, a mysterious civilization that came before the mayans and built pyramids and had those famous longer skulls. That's what this reminds me. Maybe it's a piece of meteorite polished by the water for milleniums, I would love to know. If it was man made it would change history and explain phenomenons like the nazca lines and the "mayan astronaut". Either way I don't understand why someone would threat the poor man and his family.
If there is A way to remove the sediment on and all around this object would be great as there is much more going on around this object . Possible a huge stone structure or city.
Why does everything have to have a monetary cost? This is important so let's just get it done. No one cared about the cost of going to the moon.  This is right here on earth.
Ufos are always seen coming out of active and erupting volcanos.  The black material may be volcanic but likely carried there by the ufo.
There is many more geometric shapes all around it going out quite far.
It's the millennium falcon
A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away
There are magolithic cities under a mile of sea water. We have seen only crumbs of what is there.
Hate to break it to ya folks, it is not a UFO. It is quite clearly a USO, Unidentified Submerged Object.
Is it just me or does that look like the 'Millennium Falcon'? 🙄
The circular mark on it proves its not natural.
They're doing one thing that I would love to do if I had the resources. Happy hunting.
It looks like it definitely crash landed there judging from the trail left behind it.
A big Meteor
Meteorite
It's the millennium falcon. What a waste of time
with all the thoughts expressed about this strange item you know that various governments have more than likely sent units out to examine the structure.   From the USA, Russia, China and who know who else might have tried to examine and map this item.  We will probably never  really know the WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE AND HOW this item came into being.  But the question raised will always keep people interested along with the crazies who speculate various theories about its formation.   All I can say is GOOD LUCK  and  be safe in your quest.
Its the secret hollywood basement they`ve created to support extra terrestrial false belief to all their supporters or it may be connected to the outer space, wow! finally we will space travel underwater... but i like the way they inflate the unhuman mystery instead of historical and mythical mystery of nature and earth...
It’s been a decade and no video of object at bottom sea. We should find this all interesting
The sad part of the story is...the stupid messages inflicting their familys...while trying to get a conclusive answer to this case...
Let me save everyone the time it takes to watch this ….it’s the Millennium Falcon.
Abondoned space craft made out of astroids.
Ancient momuments. Past civilizations
I postulated a theory that space travel could be done using stone crafted vessels, look at all the unexplained massive stone structures cut and carried on earth, why? Cos that's what resonates best with sound waves and is virtually impervious to friction generated temperatures.
I believe it is an ancient structure, From a pre Noah's flood civilization.
😂😂😂 ufo?!! 😂😂😂
Forget Fox News they are so good at fake news
I believe you - Never give up!
That cant be natural.
Own up. What weapons grade troll dropped the Millenium Falcon movie set prop overboard ?
SPOILER: They never find out what it is.
This looks like a dropstone from a glacier.
This is nothing more than dramatic theatrics, one made-up problem after another and never get to the point.
SPHERE
Wow now he "sees a crash site".... ugh
What most don't understand is these explorers are pulling down enormous salaries looking for these "mysteries" that THEY already know !
It’s the millennium falcon , you can see the cockpit also
its geology
Geology.
This has to be some sort of WW2 thing, perhaps the foundation for an air defense platform, or maybe an oil rig.
I thought it was an anchor platform for some type of oil rig equipment
This is looking a crucible for forging metals, for weapons and coinage.  Ancient ruins of forge works. Possibly a million years old, predating all written history.  Ancient civilizations are hidden on purpose.  The mainstream media obviously covering up the truth as always. Typical. We know the government controls the media and controls the narratives of history. The truth,whatever it is; Will be hidden at all costs.
it is indeed a crash side and it looks like something came down from the sky at high speeds, considering that it would have made a huge tsunami so i would look on the shores in the crash direction what can be revealed on that side, this is certainly not engineered but most likely a falling meteor of some kind
Oceanteam x's credibility was probably ruined because the discovery is actually much more meaningful than just a pile of rocks.
It's nordstream and the drone that planted the explosives. Case closed. All the trouble for this
Proof of high tech era following a Pheonix event destroying that entire area of land shifts.
Turret assembly
Chewbacca:"woooh!! what took you so long!??"
What a waste of time.  1 h documentary, just to end with the same question as it’s start 😔
It what we in the Netherlands call "Rots".
What about a mining or oil company, they have tons of money and the equipment to drill. If there’s any chance of money being involved, they would be there pronto. Oh, and of corse every single non-psychologist or people who need a psychologist need to put their two cents in.  Hopefully you will succeed in your quest. You seem very normal and reasoned to me. Don’t forget almost every pioneer took non-stop criticism before they made their remarkable discoveries.
I'm so glad the imaging turned out to show better results
Fox News and their scare tactics suck.
Questo oggetto è più di 4000mila anni che si trova lì sotto e non è l'unica c'è più di una Base, sotto i mari montagna e a Altri posti a noi essere comuni mortali non è concesso sapere.🙏🏼👁️☮️🤔🤘
The Vasa sank just off the harbour in Stockholm where she sailed from, approximately 1300m, 1.3km from its berthing point, not in the Baltic Sea. Why you deliberately throw it in is both inaccurate and clearly meant to deceive the viewer, shame on you and your team for making up another misleading documentary
Più ghiacciai si sciolgono vedremo delle cose che non immaginate mai io so quello che dico 🙏🏼☮️👁️
it could be  part of  a long gone underwater volcanic tube that has worn out. basically just a worn rock.
Looks like the Millennium Falcon.
I just can't get over how cute Dennis is
we can look billions of lightyears into space, but cant look 90 meters into water.
It's about time this has gone main stream I've been waiting God at least 5-6years 🙏 🙌
O⁰00000⁰08
This object, whatever it is, looks ancient asf.
Could still be man made structure made with volcanic rock that slid from the mountain after an earthquake(or landslide) to form the "crash site scene". In ancient times people use to make statues for their gods and this could be natural rock shaped by man to symbolize a god.
what if a nation state or states ran a series of dredge ships over the area to obscure as much as possible that Swedish naval ship seemed awful interested.
It is debris from a crashed weather balloon.
The comments here are bizarre - why are the same people who cheer for Graham Hancock’s pseudoscience on Joe Rogan (which has zero evidence) so butthurt about a genuine mystery that actually exists?
I bet its rock lol It looks obviously Rocky to me. How id it form like that I wonder. Whats up wi5h the very odd rock ring? Those divers are different human beings than I am for sure. No possible way would you get me to dive deeper than allows me to surface for air.
it looks like the ebon hawk for kotor lmao
obvious: romulan disruptor.
very interesting
I like millenium falcon on 1:07 !
Cylon cruiser
Thorys are just that -I don't know what it id!
Astonishing . . . This Is The First Time I Have I Have Heard Of The Second Unknown Object Down There, And The Second Line, Which Looks Like A Crash Skid Line On The Bottom Of The Ocean In The Mud   . . .    I Hope That They Can Figure Out What Exactly Those 2 Objects Are ?
( 4:17 ) " The water is brackish " I wonder what the evolutionary implications will be on the marine life there. I was always told not to put saltwater fish in my freshwater tanks and vice versa.  I wonder what kinds of fish thrive in brackish water, besides bull sharks of course.  (I know that a bull shark ain't a fish)
A scratched up hunk of rock. Next!
"And it looked like a yoofoe" 0:49
Enjoying, attractive adventure
A flat asteroid that hit and heated up causing the black surface, like Oumuamua.
It’s a concrete UFO!!!!😊 Seriously it’s a crash site. Don’t look for a complicated answer, first impressions are usually correct. It could be a million years or more. Don’t forget sediment turns to rock. You need to drill. Definately not a natural formation.
If true the US government would be there pulling out of the sea-period!
Only losers would do these stalking things. Losers with $$$$$$$.
It has a runway behind it where it arrived at speed, it's predominantly titanium, and it appears to have partially burnt up entering the atmosphere, clearly it's a rock.
Enter the squared circle companion way!
Find a rock on the bottom of the ocean, go down, find out it is obviously a rock, get an expert to tell you it's a rock, continue with the idea that it's a spacecraft. Look at the multibeam data, determine that it's a crash site. Delusional or what? 58 minutes wasted. Note to self, next time, watch the final 5 minutes first then decide if to watch the rest.
It has a lead up track . A running in way.
Wouldn't they have taken a gps reading of the original sighting? That should have them within less than 100m of the artifact.
James Cameron will go get it, bring it up, and make it into a four hour movie called "The Cement Round Thing"
I think its interesting. What gets me is why was that big ship out there? I like watching sea divevers going and investagate things like that.
This is a very good update to the baltic sea mystery, the 3D imaging certainly outlines a crashsite, however, countries would rather spend our tax money on the Ukrane war, than investigate or be honest about unknown stuctures above or below sea level.
Millennium Falcon?
Why didnt they sue fox news for falsifying information/defamation?!
Obviously, it's the millennium falcon. Duh.
Now we know where Han and Chewie went between Episode 6 and 7  It really does look like a crash site too.
It’s either the Millennium Falcon or a giant Halo Covenant weapon
This is like 10 years old
Doesn't matter. The government will lie about it.
LOL
Who stalked and threatened the crew? Who are the gutless slime dwellers? The Swede Masonic crown and their ' employees ' ?
Why rush !!!!
Go to big objected, a piece that sheared off the top of a mountain and the smaller piece is a smaller piece. Let’s live down the mountains also current can move heavy objects.
"My heart is ticking quite fast." What a waste of money & time for this over dramatised empty story.  52295 views x 57,34 min x 10% watching to the end => 5,7 years x 33500€ average EU salary => You burned an amount of 191.121€ besides your investment. Congrat!
Millenium Falcon. It did say 'A long time ago'...
So thats were the millennium falcon ended up
call elon  musk. :)
The stone circle is a dead giveaway that this object is ancient. When the diver says it looks like it was molded by hand before it cooled, it reminds you of the stones in Peru that look like they were melted and shaped before being perfectly placed.
now that's obviously the millennium falcon
Another oak island
Waste of time. Never explained what it is.
Sometimes discoveries can take years until they give any answers. Maybe one day we will find out exactly what this is. Maybe it will be something extremely significant, maybe it won't. The people who dismiss it too quickly are the people who would never find out. Be proud of what you do and who you are 👍
The documentary is well old but it's been up loaded again
Looks like the core of a volcano
I totally believe that the UFO's been down there for millions of years ,it could have  Fossilize
Cannot be an alien UFO as nasa, seti, military have told us that.. BUT, as usual.. it's all lies. Millions have full disclosure..open, write in reverse, or 'they' delete this...moc.ylfyeht.  Over 700 face to face chats with human ets since 1943, with a Swiss guy, under ..'Billy's Contacts''. Threats? cia?
So yeah I don’t think the Clintons dump there bodies here. Just don’t use all the way they should
If it's only rocks, why would he get threats against him and his family. That tells me he is over the target. Even if it is made of rock/stone, it still seems to be man-made and further investigation is required. When you get discredited and threatened, it means you are onto something.
How many times are they going to repost this. This video is years old and has been posted many times.
Its a ham sandwich
Seems very similar to the movie the Sphere.
Fox News discrediting them should be taken lightly. Fox News lied a lot of times already. Fox is not a news agency.
Clearly there was a major disturbance there of some sort. I don’t think man made, or alien or any of that nonsense.   The only thing that makes any sense, especially given the last few images we saw, a a sizeable meteor impacting at a steep angle to leave such a ridge and it coming to a rest a 100 or so meters away.   Just not a lot here because no $$$
Ask Han Solo 😆
As much as I hope it is a UFO and how exciting that would be, it is probably a natural formation.
IT looks like a UFO crashlanding milyon years ago,to answer that is to drill that stone and examine to lab to make sure whats inside.
It’s the millennium falcon!
Is that near oak island?
That's masterchiefs helmet from HALO
How do you call an object sitting on the ocean floor, a UFO? UFO’s fly, hence the name, flying object.
"and it looked like a youFO." BWAHAHAHA!!!
maybe it is indeed man made. if it was above sea level during the ice age maybe some prehistoric culture was more advanced than we give it credit for and they made it.
I wonder if Han Solo and Chewbacca got out or if they were trapped inside. Has no one noticed that this is an exact replica of the millennium falcon? I think Hollywood and television is perhaps trying to tell us a lot of the things that are true and just writing them off as films. Look at The blacklist. All of those crazy kind of criminals and the cabal shadow government it all turned out to be real. Down to the stewmaker and the other special criminals. It all turned out real. Maybe the millennium falcon was fashioned after real spacecraft. LOL
could it be a foundation of some ancient temple complex? you know during or after ice age when water levels were low?
They've found the Millennium Falcon.
Millennium Falcon
Drama
Wow..  Never give up.. People in this world can be full of BS, one thing is that they are not scientist and can not prove you wrong anyways.. So that are wrong.
I think it looks like the millennium falcon..
I hope that they find out without question what this anomaly is before I die!! It's been a wonder forever it feels like
You are doing what governments should be paying
Conspiracy and religious idiots are certainly out there.  Ignorance is the true meaning of religious right as it doesn’t fit into their norm of God. They can’t believe if anything that wasn’t written thousands of years ago, except ludicrous conspiracies .  Open one’s mind till we find out, don’t blame the guys for investigating… we know very little of what is hidden in our oceans and our earth is mostly covered in ocean.
My thought was, is it a geo polymer monument commemorating an event even earlier. The last time the Baltic Sea floor was above the surface was about 12,000 years ago when the ice melted and sea levels came up. The “fairy ring” makes me think later generations came to honour the gods or the ones associated with the original object symbolised
The earth is flat.   Fact
Update: It's made from very high tech combination of rare metals. That's all I know.
I love watching documentaries that never answer questions. Truly a great use of our time.
its just rock. Saved you time.
I would expect nothing less from fox entertainment.
The government there won't allow anymore research there, that's the latest as of Jan 20 23.
A waste of an hour.
Good luck
one look at it and anyone who watched Star Wars (who hasnt??!) knows its the Millenium Falcon!!    Mystery solved. Why the hype??!!
Ruins
It looks like the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars. It did happen in the past.
So the first time they found this object , no one wrote down the GPS coordinates ?    Now they have to spend $40,000 to find it again.  Half the show if about finding the object again.
Ok.  Say it its a volcanic rock moved or dropped on a glacier. Moved for many years and left of a flat plain.  If I were a nomadic civilization following herds.  On a flat plain.  I would use the weird black roundish stone as a meeting place.  Over time use it as something.    Like the big rock in the Australian outback.  It would be a major landmark for my people.    So humans could of carved on it.
Basalt core of an ancient volcano. NEXT!
That was adorable. It's funny when people can't cope with it being natural geology. Just be amazed at the geology dude. Move past your childish fantasies.
It's the Millenium Falcon
Looks like the stone floor of a building.   Maybe it’s Atlantis! 😃
So much footage of people sitting around yapping, so little actual content.
i think the government does not want the public to get it first. Alien technology is very delicious for government military. and so they said for fox to silence them and then the government is going to pick it up themselves without anyone knowing.
Whatever you do, don't unplug it or you'll drain all the water in the sea.
Its a bloody rock...if it was a UFO it would be off the bottom in a flash...come on peeps....
I assure you, it is nothing but swamp gas.
No it doesn't look like a UFO !
The implications are huge! Could this be the water landing recorded in history of a particular Anunnaki Landing Party.
I believe Peter and Dennis 100% it's obvious they are genuine - - to me it looks like a UFO  plowed thru the ocean bottom (burrowed) and is covered in the debris and the UFO was super heated from entry into the atmosphere and that debris melted over the hull
They should stop calling it an object and either call it an anomaly or call it a mark because it's probably just a glacial mark left in the Earth.
I just can say it's a "creature" made shape. Definitely not natural made to me. Ours, manny many years ago ancestors, ET ?
25:27 Hey Capt.Put the welder to work.
40:39 This is scary.
The World is a mysterious place. No matter how much that you think that you know,, there is always one more stone, left unturned.  Reminds me obba bad old joke of my Father's ( he hadfa million of them  )  So, their was this merchant - ship that washed up inna bay, in Icy-land.  It was creewed by a bunch of Newfoundlanders. It was filled with ganja  !  No tern was left un-stoned !   Total groaner.  Sorry, as always.  I'll be back !
It's obviously the Millennium Falcon. The question is why it's not sitting in a hanger at Area 51!
l have a bridge to sell all the ppl who liked this video
Scientific discoveries are important  don't let these animals get you down pretty sure they thought tesla was crazy
Fox News, of course, they hate science. This is why the human race is doomed, it's become ok to allow things we don't understand to never be solved. But at least we have forty flavors of doritos, great use of "science". Sad they had such a backlash, the world needs more curiosity seekers and less slovenly dimwits.
It's a ancient civilization that was victim from multiple cataclysm floods... nothing more folks... great presentation
If governments were honest they could tell you exactly the type of spacecraft it is.  No kidding
Falcon
Call up the Wagners'.
When they touched it turned black ? Could be some kind of morfing like UFO's in the sky change shape and apperance .
I sincerely hope that this doesn't end up like Geraldo Rivera and Al Capone's supposed vault.  I'm getting a real bad feeling about this.
These men need a newt suite . They should contact Elon Musk,😊
If it had been any advanced technology we wouldn't have known about it at all and it wouldn't be there now.
Could be just a piece of the Giant's Causeway, in Ireland.  Basalt.
Sad to see the researchers threatened! So, makes my question clear!!! Why???
Under-water weldeers.  Your could be off Brunei, one day, the Barents Sea, the next. Limited life-span , in that game.  Make allot of money but when you get that creepy feeling?  Quit,, while you're ahead.
It’s the Millenium Falcon
I feel bad for these guys ,, They are amazing and people are just mean  they shoulnt send out hate making fun of these guys I f had the money I would send it   I  woul like to know what it is   I pray you get the funding you need  plus more for other  Im following you guys ok
That object look like falcon ship from Star Wars
My gut feeling.. crash site. my gut feeling is never wrong. I have a gift
Your blood appears blue, at these depths.
Murphies Law. If anything can possibly go wrong, it probably will.
I think it’s a Russian tank. I heard they can go under water
Halo helmet
Only down-side, though, is that he spends months in the middle of the mistakenly - named Pacific Ocean !
Its from the acient civilization its part of man made structure the area they are in use to be above water and people lived there and have a city or what ever you call it back then it was probably  carved out of stone  granite or volcanic rock why do you think we don't here about is shi7 they even found Atlantis in Africa and they don't even excavate it just like the pyramids all the valuables like metal were very prized so any kind of metal was scavenged way way way back people did not care about history back then they only cared about survival qnd food weapons and shelter and food and woman and alcohol
This show is just a scam to get ppl to donate until the next time they need money so they will need ppl to donate again. 😐
in my eyes....I see a jai lai court.  I will never stop thinking about it. PS  I am also open to the hypothesis that it is a portal to Alsaurian homeworld in the Delta Quadrant.
I can tell you what it is
I wonder who's threatening them and why?
Okay. Divers can"t stay down long enough to do a thorough investigation. If someone wants to invest the times and money they should go back with a number of ROVs. They should start with one that blows or sucks most of the fine sediment off the surface. Once the dust clears, go over it with camara and sonar. Then drill some core samples. All of this stuff is available, but not cheap.
Very interesting I hope you solve this mystery 😊
60 metters seems big but if this object is 10,000 or  100 thousand years old, the possibility that it was carved  volcanic stone by giant humans. might sound absurd but it is not!!!  in the bible....there where giants in those days. !  could be a discus.
Just the usual pseudo-history. A 6-day expedition to produce 10 minutes of poor visibility video of an inconclusive object and then the project "runs out of time" (money?) and everyone goes home. They discovered a glaciated rock formation but just want to keep the mystery going. This is not archaeology and not history just OLD news. So who is and why is it being recycled 10 years later? A hoax? A scam? You be the judge. Better yet, do not waste an hour of your time watching it.
It's a rock. Nothing more.
Fascinating object, speculation aside. It would be cool if it were a ufo crash site, but honestly seems like its volcanic in origin. Perhaps some efusive eruption along an extinct rift zone is the simplest answer. The regular shapes a combination of crystaline macrostructure and glacial weathering
“a yoofoh?”
51:35 just hit me like a truck lmao
Why can't they carbon date the burnt stone?
Maybe the Jack Clouseau foundation would help? The Calypso is a fantastic ship and probably sitting in dock somewhere itching for a new adventure  Just a thought  Good luck 👍
Sooo, no answers here 😐
Waiting for footage from drones ,deepsea-diver 😎
In an octopuses garden in the shade. What goes up must come down.
Oh man only if they can do a gofundme to do a drill operation.
Millenium Falcon brudah
Lots of digital footprints left behind to find who was threatening them.
I can’t imagine what these brave explorers must think 😢of these ignorant idiots mocking them now, when once they were supportive. And FoxNews great big mouths who have tried to also ruin this exposition. It’s terrible! I believe in these brave 💪🏻men. I pray 🙏🏻 🙏🏻🙏🏻that they find their answers with this mysterious anomaly. I think it’s an alien space ship which had crashed long ago.
A lot of agents in the comments! Obviously the powers that be would not want their version history rewritten, so this discovery will likely remain a mystery.
What would fox news gain from a false report in the Baltic sea ?
This thing was found how long ago? It still hasn't been dove on yet??? Give me a brake. They know what it is.
Idk about you guys but I play Terran
Definitely not some type of spacecraft...
There are stories that the Russians have been in Hostile encounters with aliens who were armed with weapons that were capable of turning their soldiers to something like stone and they had larger weapons on their aircraft that could do many more things and then there are ancient creatures that are stone like the giant snake and other weird things that are stones but looked like they were once real creatures and giants
The amount of confrontation and venom these poor guys are getting over this is suspicious - like massive cover-up suspicious.
See : Arnold Murray  three world 🌎 ages.
Volcano
deep diving is something i will never do. im am just absolutely terrified of being at the bottom of dark water. i feel like something big ugly and sinister is just right there looking at me. i already feel "not safe" watching people diving
Don't give up...
Science is science. If there are still questions, then explore it. There are a lot of volunteer deep technical scuba divers. Get a few boats, a few scientists, and a couple dozen divers with the equipment recommended by the scientists. 2-3 days and you’ll have everything you want.  Timeline has made a video for attention, not for science. Thumbs down to Timeline for such a crappy video on a scientific expedition. Skip the drama. Cut to the science. Facts.
should start a kickstarter for these guys
So, after one hour documentary, what’s the mysterious object lying there? No answer and no idea why they create something like this….
Over-hyped underwater rock formation.  Get over it.
It's the millennium falcon.
(40:00) - " It Looks Like It Was Molded Before It Turned To Stone "                   My Guess Is That It's A Great Big Pile of Wookie Dookie !                   If the Test Comes Back Positive For Wookie Dookie Then You Can Bet It's the Millennium Falcon ! - Case Closed !
Didn’t the Japanese post that finding a few years ago?  They then dropped the search as just an anomaly?
I think the track behind the object is interesting and I also heard some version claiming that there is another track near this one, which makes it look more like a crash. Can someone confirm or disprove that? Thanks
Rubbish
Clearly, it's the Millennium Falcon.
Han and Chewie will be back soon to fire it back up and fly it out

What would be the possibility of it being an old satellite or other object used in the space industry (like the remnants of booster rockets)? This may explain both the 'man made' looks of the object itself as well as the apparent damage to the natural land formations in the area. I'm just guessing of course. But I would most certainly like to see a more thorough follow up to this. But we all need to keep in mind some very odd things that were once a mystery, and often explained with rather sensational non-scientific explanations (like they even mentioned in this video - 'fairy rings'), were later explained quite adequately by very natural means.
I'm ok with you calling me a nut so here's what I think. I've seen that "shape" in a number of places on the net. Each one is in odd places.  There's one on the moon, one under that man made island and now this one. It's either a Photoshop or aliens have friends in China.
They found the millennium falcon
Looks like Han was piloting on deathsticks...
Its sad timeline is entertaining pseudoscience 🙄
its the millennium falcon
The millennium falcon
Have the,  Ocean X Team    Ever gotten ahold of "BRANDON FUGAL"⁉️⁉️⁉️     The OWNER of "SKINWALKER RANCH" for SPONSORSHIP On Your QUEST for the "BALTIC ANOMALIE"‼️‼️‼️  Just a THOUGHT,    That OCEAN X Team may have not thought of Asking Before, On their QUEST to IDENTIFYING the "BALTIC ANOMALIE"‼️‼️‼️  😃👍💖
Documentaries like this always remind me of the Crow and Stone Story.  🙃
Big drain plug......
Even If it turns out to be a natural object that has resulted from ancient glaciers. It would be amazing to have that information.
clickbait- I dont think it looks like the image on the advertisement- you dont hardly see any real images in this documentary-its cgi.
They are certainly not the only one who gets frustrate by Fox news.
The Millennium Falcon evidence that Star Wars was it true story
Pretty boring..

Hahah what a stupid video I’ve just watched 😂😂😂
Poor original GPS location. Even a $200 GPS would have given a position fix and made a return visit child's play. They mission execution was embarrassing. This is not hindsight  comment. A conservative mindset doomed this voyage. Ex. Wait for calm weather, fish for side scan, consider halting for fog, failure to take reserve air tanks, failure to realize this was an oil well plug.      These guys were not burdened with excess intelligence.
Unfortunately...this is more about the crew...than the unknown anomaly.... makes for a really boring documentary simply because whoever made this... chose to edit like we actually care more about the crew...smh...
great history
I don’t need to watch the next 57 minutes. 45 seconds in and I already know that is obviously the remains of the Millennium Falcon.   A long long time ago…
Watching people work
It's a button or a key
C'mon, seriously?  It's the Millenium Falcon...sheesh!    Nah, not having finished the video yet my initial guess would be the remains of a basalt column of lava leftover from a volcanic eruption after the cinder cone around it had eroded away.  But I'm probably wrong.  I guess I missed something.  They didn't take a GPS or Glonass fix on the original location?  GPS coordinates don't drift.
Fantastic! Amazing! I wish I had money to spend on this! Why only seventy likes?
You must've been desperate to put something on youtube. If this was something of great importance, you would have been ran away from there by some military or governance. They would've extracted it themselves and kept secret. And of course, no conclusion. Thanks for wasting my time.
U.F.O... not U-fo
This documentary is a complete waste of time.
This follows the classical "mystery" formula where nothing really is revealed, nothing really is presented, it is the "mystery of the mystery" because if there is really something to begin with then some answers would be at reach.
Cmon make a Kickstarter campaign on this, I have seen more crazy campaigns achieving full funding
It’s the millennium falcon
It was a very good year
The remains of Fred Flinstone’s beach house…
It doesn't look like a UFO. If we knew what a UFO looked like it would'nt be a UFO.
The device that the 👽E.T's  used to levitate huge stones around and soften up the rocks for polygonal construction overheated the stone  to the point of unmanageable, so they quickly levitated it to sea and dropped it in to quench.  🤔 🧐 😜
This all happened nearly over a decade ago. I'm astonished that there's not a part two or maybe there is and I just have to subscribe to Timeline to see more?
I would never never never dive in the deep dark sea like that.
It's obvious what it is ! It is the Millennium Falcon...
It is clearly the Millennium Falcon
It's the Millennium Falcon. I'm guessing it went through a wormhole.
Didn't they say in one other program that electronics started to fail every time they went down to it .🤔 my self 100% believe its a UFO if I had the money I would fund them but unfortunately I don't.👍
That’s the doorway to the center of the earth, obviously
No Tsoukalos = no ufo talk
it's obviously the millennium falcon. 🤦‍♀🤦‍♀
No answers, more questions?  Say no more. Move along.
It looks like the object has striations from a glacial erratic. It’s possible that the whole thing is an underwater moraine. It definitely looks weird and out of place, a characteristic of glacier erratics. I’m interested to know what it actually is, even if it is just a pile of rocks. I’m just glad they were able to continue with their investigation even after one of the lamest institutions in existence tried to bring them down. They’re just curious!
Looks more lika a Ebon Hawk to me, than Millenium Falcon tbh.
Much ado about...nothing!
Hey, Han! I found where you parked the Falcon. ✌️😸
So glad I skimmed this. Jumped to "it looks man made" "it could be man made".#NoKidding🤣
Looks like the Millennium Falcon LOL
It would have been interesting to know what the object is but fox news and other trolls made it impossible. Strange that they got upset about this very thing.
I've uncoded the Nazca lines
It basically produce more questions than answers when they publicized it
Its a part of Trump spacecraft from 9000 years ago.
If you really found the ufo other worlds Read the Quran and search.  But before u read say Bismillah And say Allah is one and Muhammad his messenger
Finally found the ship.. darned Vikings... we got around .. ;)
Great work.
Timeline is the best channel on YouTube.  It is the opposite of tik tok thankfully.
Yikes, the ending was messed up... (With the death threats.)
How long yal been cooking up this one lol. We know there's no just exploring around the Baltic right now lol
Seems likely a man-made structure, possibly some sort of pedestal for worship purposes, and it possibly slipped in the Baltic centuries ago. More information about the history of the area would help.
It’s clearly the birthing canal of Hillary Clinton!!! nothing to see here folks!
This one is not man made at all it's from the very Fallen Angel's Technology and it's there flying ship. Why they don't know about the same Holy Bible verse talks about what the heck the very Angeles are not very happy, or nice, or something like that for we should be able to find out what it is really going down in the oceans and water ways and yes it's also the very End Time storyline online for this weekend and it's truth about what time it is now.
Why do we bother with semiconductors when alien aerospace technology is based entirely on stones..
The Decepticon's crashed ship in million year hibernation.....TRANSFORM!
It's a rock
Truly a better thought of wondering what this may be is much better than what is going on these days.. I’d rather find out what this ! In the Baltic Sea😀
If it was real NATO would know . There are sound arrays all over the area .😂
Well, this sucked.
Rubbish
Omg get a real boat for the show you fools.
10mins 3ads. wow just wow
Why isn't some government all over this?
Clearly the Millenium Falcon!!!
One thing we know for sure it is Not...the Millennium Falcon
Its a Poke Ball.
Team up with James Cameron
Why were they not double checking their data collection gear?!? How did they lose half of the data...??
How could it be a UFO if it's stationary... underwater?
TL;dr It's a rock formation
There a sequel to this interesting program  ?
And now it will never be revealed. It will be hidden away with the rest
That’s just master chief, he’s cool
The millennium Falcon 😂😂
Aliens have gravity control. Stone protects from interstellar medium and harse wavelengths. There seems to be a stone quarry reminant
you actually make Fox News look credible.
Master chief? Is that you?
is Timeline going the way of the "History" and "discovery" channel now?
No one can explain? It's the Millennium Falcon.
Is there a volcano somewhere close???. UFO's are notorious for hanging out around volcanos. Could have gotten to close to one and the volcano erupted???...got to heavy and crashed???. Also, check it for magnetics because electronics and magnetism works better when very cold... could be the reason it is so cold around it. Just my thoughts.
did this idiot really just pronounce it "Yuofoh?"
Fast ship?! Shes fast enough for you old man!!
I would describe this entire video as making mountains out of molehills
Jesus is Alive he love us all you your heard the loud voice that you couldn't see get white and look up to heaven
Lol 🤣🤣🤣 people are cruel, Peter put on your diving suit..eeh l don't have one lol
HH, have you been talking to the American History Channel again? I told you they are a bad influence! SMH 🫣
Definitely the Millennium Falcon
I think it is volcanic either a submerged volcano or a volcanic lava tube
Es la nave de marino titán del mar
The media is so stupid 🤣🤣😂🤣 the millennium falcon was built at studio dummies
Rocks
So it's something in fairly shallow water that wasn't swept away during the last ice age just a few thousand years ago? I'm not going to spend an hour listening to this.
The Black Sea and Doggerland clearly isn't the only low-lying area that was prime real-estate way back before our current historical records, only to be covered by water as glaciers melted and the sea-level rose. As a matter of fact, probably the MAJORITY of human habitations still ARE below 400 feet of water, since even today most people live at the same elevation just above sea level,  Living near water since transport by water is always the cheapest option.  The Romans invented the road (clearly not true) but even the best roads wear out and need maintenance.  The water surface may not be always smooth, but it clearly is self-repairing - just try punching holes in the ocean.
IT loOks LiKe A YouFO!... ... ... ... *facepalm*
Absolute trash. I expect better quality from Timeline. What a waste of time.
Whatever it may be, LEAVE IT ALONE. This is not the time to go looking for more trouble.
It's a rock formation and human minds are prone to pareidolia.
I think we all know it's the base of a giant unicorns horn. It's sleeping beneath the seabed and probably should be left alone.
Halo
Whatever it is its very old & definetely deserves closer examination, can't the Navy help you out at all?
Everyone knows very well that the only one capable of pulling it out of the bottom of the sea has already died. It was YODA... BUT, THERE IS ONE, HOPE; Where's Yoda Baby?
Thank you for finding out what the the object was
Straight away I thought....rock formation....occams razor....works every time
i mean, at a glance, it does look like The Falcon. However, I think this is cooler than fiction. Pre Chalcolithic is just a guess.
Interesting, but please stop with the ancient alien's nonsense.
As cool as it would be if this were something noteworthy, it's just a rock formation. There's no need for an hour long explanation.
I want it to be aliens; but my guess is the baltic was at the edge of the ice cap after the younger dryas (steppe-tundra), the sea floor was most likely dry ground some point in history which i'm guessing humans cut it, a lot of human history from that period is lost
Why is it mirrored on the other side of what I thought was the keel line?
It's the millennium falcon!  That's the true reason Han Solo was without it for so long
spaceship,,???,,,not even close,,!!!,,,it's an old low place with rock's on the bottom,,,
God dosent work in straight lines..... ever.
So they went from finding the Millennium Falcon to discovering it was really Lexx the whole time.
What did the lab say about the sample I saw you remove from it?
Honestly, I don't care if it's an UFO or not. I only want to know, why do people have to be so mean to them? Why do they threaten him and his kids on the internet? What the fck is wrong with them?
USO
The Millennium Falcon?
Master Chief's Helmet.
So long winded and drawn out this video may as well be a proof of concept of a perpetual energy machine.
TLDR: it’s an unusual rock formation formed by glacial thawing - I’ve saved you 58 mins of useless speculation with a photoshopped thumbnail.  Edit: To those demanding sources, see interviews with planetary geomorphologist Jarmo Korteniemi and Charles Paull of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. I would appreciate *your* sources for “aliens!” - didn’t think so.
What's the name of the object?
Youfoe??
How come goverments dont want it explored😊
It’s the Millennium Falcon! Where’s Chewy?
what the Eff is a EUFOE❓
