Thank God Your Doin This 😄❤
Ok well I can take this song and the vo😅
Beautiful ❤
Hey Luke, Life is a contradiction like a paradox, whose entirety is an enigma. But to truly know about life is to know that it has many roads, streets, avenues, valleys, many depths are attributed to it. I can't entirely say I know what's up, but that's the mystery. And it's like "feelin' on fire", too. I hope this helps; anyways.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
beautiful tribute to a good friend. Good job both of you
I don't know why but I'm balling my eyes out right now
Luke you are my favorite person to listen to when h don't feel good and when I am just not having the best day and this helps me to get ready for sports and just doing homework I just love to listen to you ❤❤
Who can relate this to high school football??
Nothing. We will both do nothing with this. Please. There had been enough blood shed for a lifetime for all of us tbh. So you'll be a perfect gentleman and I'll be a perfect lady, and no fights. Don't just pick a fight with me
I fell in love with Luke when I first heard this song❤❤❤❤
Hi
I really enjoyed that production, brother!
Amen about family and friends 💟
❤
Then is guess you never met @noahthomson ?.. that kid deserved more
I love this song 🎵
One of the best singers ever ❤
Love the story and song. Luke myself and a bunch of others would to have you preform at the fair in Waterville Washington one of these years.

These songs feel like a journal written in soft ink, filled with quiet thoughts and gentle moments. As the melodies drift by, it’s like time begins to soften, and your heart is allowed to just be — still, tender, and open to everything you forgot you loved about slowing down

This is my favourite song out of Luke
For those that don't know the words .....  Someone asked me once in an interview "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school?" "And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?" I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge Tryin' to make rent with a dead end job, just makin' due With tips in a jar, my guitar and an old barstool  I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin' them same damn songs like I am now I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this  I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day Who was burnin' CDs just to give away Payin' his dues if I wasn't doin' this Five deep in a van, head full of steam Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true Livin' this life just like I was born to do  I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin' them same damn songs like I am now I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this  It ain't about the fame It ain't about the fortune It ain't about the name It ain't about the glory I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about  Having a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin' them same damn songs like I am now I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this  Someone asked me once in an interview "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school?" "And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?"
Hi Luke I’m from England and I love all your songs I am nb 1 fan love to you and your family xx❤❤
How moving moments and song!
CANADA.  I know Canada is small compared to good old USA but why don’t you come to tour Canada?  We saw Jellyroll tonight and the crowd at the Scotiabank arena and it was insanely amazing!  Come to Canada and see a REAL show!  We love you.  Support your fans my man.
This song hits so hard for guys like me who are working musicians just playing in the local scene because nothing else would ever be nearly as incredible, fulfilling, or exciting as doing exactly what you were born to do. Regardless of whether you’re famous or not, it’s a calling and it’s just the only thing that some of us really have a passion for…family, friends, god, and music, that’s all I need.
Já ouvi muitas vezes, mas é uma versão mágica que não pode faltar Quem ouvir por favor me dê um joinh
I’ve never heard this song amazing I love the video as well!!!❤❤❤🎉😮😊 I’m a huge Luke Combs fan, but I’ve never listened to this song.
Awesome Singer!❤
He'll of a singer
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I found this because I was looking for something to help me sleep. I didn’t realize I would be comforted by so many strangers comments. I didn’t realize how much I needed all of this. Thank you to all of you wonderful people.
i just love you Luke and anything that comes from you
❤ LENARD ❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊
I need to see him live
saw him before he blew up, great voice and stage presense. Makes you believe he is one of us. Great video LUKE
Im a local musician in Gastonia Nc. I had done a show at a local bar called the Rooster with Adam church about a year ago when I was 16. I’m gonna be turning 18 later this year and after I graduate I’m gonna be going up to app state much like Adam and Luke did. A simple 30 minute conversation with Adam backstage completely flipped my views on not only song writing and music but on life. Talking with Adam helped me find a part of myself I had been searching for. I will never be able to thank mr Adam church enough for all that he has and still does for me.
As a non white woman, I love this song
You be surprised what people have done.. can you be surprised where I go to find what people done.. Don't worry it's done No big deal😊
🎉😢😮
AWESOME MAN VOICE IS SILVER 😊😊😊😊😊

Ooh God it's 01:25 AM and I'm discovering this masterpiece, Luke you're a killer Man!!🎉 Happy new year, I'm in tears

This one makes man cry cos it hits me, I am a man, it’s ok to cry
A few things i love about luke is how he really puts his heart into these songs. He's so calm when hes making the songs, knowing that he is trying his best. Talking about the aspects of his life, his family, and people who are true to him and who arent. And in a couple if songs, about his childhood. I really love how he doesnt overthink when making these songs, and he always writes and does them well. Love ya luke!
Love this song so much!!!!  Please can you come to Hawaii🙏🙏🙏
Y is he dodging the question

Its is the best song🎉❤

I don't get the meaning of this song.  What's the first meaning of " doing this "?
My cousin Saheed introduced me to Country Music in 2011. He gave me a Don Williams CD. I listened to that CD till it got lost. Today I'm a huge fan of Country and Soft rock songs

https://youtu.be/Ikxnz2NIdxI?si=ZWxT7UeHHcVuEP_6  Upchurch got him known from this song understand that hes great but dont goat theres so many artists in country with insane talent cant focus on just one but id definitely agree hes one great country singer 31 its soothing but seriously how many started with can i get an outlaw because thats when i discovered luke
I do belive he is the next George Strait.no if ands or buts
I hated country all my life but as I get older 39 now the songs soothe me  and they are brilliant I actually take back everything wrong I've said about country cause it was and is beautiful music sorry country lovers I apologize
This man and his music helped me get through the hardest stretch of my life.. a divorce, losing my grandma, my house, everything and the kitchen sink.. except my job and the company I work for.. and this song, made me realize I’d still be a surveyor if I wasn’t doing this.. it’s always stuck with me since this song came out.. and I about bawled my eyes out when he played this Saturday night
As a lifelong struggling musician, this song hits home in a big way for me. A lot of people don’t understand the sacrifices we make to just be able to play those songs once a month in front of 50 people. But without it, my whole world would fall apart. It’s a blessing and a curse and I wouldn’t have it any other way. Thank you Luke for speaking for us!
Some of the Best country music being played today!!!Luke and Cody Johnson are saving country music like Randy Travis did years ago!!!!
Absolute favorite artist. I am a Paramedic and have been a medic for 37 years. Like the song says, I'd still be doing this if I wasn't doing this. A high school drop out found a career. Keep it up Luke and come to Lafayette LA
Love this song
❤BOSS SONG❤

I live in Reno Nevada I've seen him every time he had ever come here I haven't seen him very drunk but he still doesn't miss a Beat
How did you do that do to take mouth  ❤
I love the pure joy when Luke looks over at Adam smiles and wrinkles his nose-- you can tell that it is all the feels for these two to be on stage together. never tire of watching this-- its what we all feel to those that were present with us shoulder to shoulder in our Youth --just doin this.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

I look, think back at my life and I say why am I still doing this
❤❤❤
Its awesome to be able to see how far Luke has come. Especially since when he released this song.
Living the dream, even when they're not as big. That's what happens when you love, what you do, surrounded by people you love. I came across this song by accident. And it gave me all sorts of warm-fuzzy feelings.
I´m Crying. Chorei! Emocionante!
The best song you’ve released for sure! It’s just so genuine
This man is doing big things.. love it..
Here after the Duke Dennis stream 🫡

So much emotion goes into Luke’s music. Folks we are witnessing a country legend in the making.
You are the best
I can't wait til he comes back to Australia, damn I hope I get tickets next time
To much is given much is required! Touching song with a great story behind it
Texas !!!!!!!!!!!!! From Russia with Love!
Seeing him live was an amazing experience. Can't wait to see you live again, but this time at the Grand Ole Opry.
This song is a call to all that want to sing and tell their story. I’ve never given up on my dream to do the same.
This is a masterpiece. You and Adam are amazing humans.
I love this song, as well as the majority of his songs. I love the story telling, the connections, and I am thankful for his songs.  I hope one day I will be able to see him live. It's on my bucket list!!!
Great song and I have admit his wife is hot
Hoss!

Another great singer,one of the greats . I love all of his songs.And his morals,nothing like the terrible music they play now .
Snotherdwill Hey
Yeah, but haven't you always kinda been doin' this? I figure the moment you opened your mouth and that sound came out, that was it. I don't imagine you played those bars and clubs for very long before someone was like, "uhh...get this dude a record deal. Now."
Love this song thank you Adam Church
Such awesome person and singer beautiful voice could  Listen to him 24 hours a day !
You are awesome !!!!   B

That's loyalty. This guy is the most talented artist today. Every one of his songs are dynamite!!!
I Cody lived close to us. My youngest son is getting married Dec. 28. This song makes me try when I think of all there of my kids and their marriages. They all have been married in the last three years. My daughter and youngest were in 6 months of each other.

Recently saw Luke in London, I’ve seen some awesome acts over the years but NO ONE came close to how he had the sell out crowd wrapped around his little finger. He was just  amazing! The best concert I have ever had the pleasure to attend. This is my favourite track of his, always tugs at my heart.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ME SUM LUKE !! I Ty GOD FOR GIVING HIM THIS VOICE  THAT JUST MAKES MY HEART SO FULL ❤ IF THIS MAN VOICE JUST DONT MAKE U FEEL SOMETHING I CANT EVEN EXPLAIN

This may sound corny but Luke I am do proud of you for staying so real. Your music kept me alive when my world was so dark. Thank you ❤
Nice job,your voice is a dream.❤
I can't listen to this song without borderline sobbing. It's one of the rawest tracks to have semi hit the mainstream imo, even by Luke's standards. Really a level of artistry and expression we don't see a lot anymore
1:52
Everything single songs of luke gives me goosebumps.. he is too good
incredible voice. beyond perfection.

Luv u Luke

All I can say is I love luke combs. What an absolute legend
This talented singer has been part of my life since he came out. My husband now he has passed a year ago . He came home an sang beautiful crazy to me. Forever after we danced to 3 weeks around the floor of our cabin. Love you anyway reminds me of my husband because I'm so broken inside. We played luke at my moms funeral . He is so aweso.e hopefully I will get to shake his hand an tell him thank you . I've been suicidal for a year an he has helped me get through the times tears an all. May God bless this young man
“And his name is Ryan Upchurch”
Some songs just hit you different.
Luke Combs has an indcredable Talent!!! Wishing him all the best!!!
I'm becoming a huge Luke Combs fan. I didn't want to like him at first but goddamn he's good. I've only listened to a handful of his songs, because I don't every want there to be no more new ones to listen to, but each one I've heard, I just love. The other night I thought, OK, time to try a new one. Just picked a random song off youtube. 30 seconds in and I'm crying. This one really resonated with me. I AM that hypothetical guy. The guy who didn't make it but still does it with as much heart as if he had. You've never heard of me, but I've been writing and singing for decades, I have 40 albums, all free, on my website. I know most of my "fans" personally by name. Love is really the only reason I do it. Loss does not often make me cry...but sonic beauty and the magic of the right words with the right voice and melody sure does. It can be a background vocal on a Steely Dan song or something like this. Holy shit. What a heart and what a voice!
your on fire🔥
Still coming back to this one, Luke's vocal delivery is special...the song is almost cinematic
🙏
I’m hoping he comes to California I want to see him in concert again so bad.
❤❤❤❤ what a song buddy.
Sophia Jhgk bc dl bc lhlfk my h
I was listening to this song tonight thinking about how much I love my wife.  I was in a serious auto accident 21 months ago where another car swerved into my lane and hit me head on leaving me with a broken back and neck and a messed up spine and leg.  My wife has tirelessly cared for me, washed me, helped me put my clothes on, brings me my meals, makes me coffee, and all this while caring for 7 of our 10 children, most of them adopted and several with special needs.  What an amazing woman she is. She is my hero.  I love her so much and am so glad she is my wife.  She is my best friend, and I would not want another woman.  I pray that God allows me many more years so that I can serve her as she has cared for me.  I wanna grow old with her, holding hands, gazing into her big brown eyes, and feeling her heartbeat next to mine.  My wife is a beautiful Mexican woman who I adore.  So many people fight over the little things.  Focus on what matters.  Overlook your differences.  Forgive each other.  Love one another unconditionally.  And never let go of one another.   I will always love my beautiful wife.  She is more important to me than any amount of money you could offer.  She truly is my soulmate, my best friend, and the love of my life. What would I be doing? I would be loving my wife. I would be doing this. I wish I could sing this song with Luke on stage with my wife listening with his wife. And maybe singing another love song to her.
Luke damn Combs
This is just a flat out awesome tribute!

A real country singer like Waylon Jennings would put out his cigarette on his forehead.  I can’t believe folks like this corny stuff.
Adam's wife is my niece. I just got the pleasure of meeting Adam and Lily a few weeks ago. What a special family. I feel like I've known Adam forever and a lily is a firecracker
Oh this is brilliant
Hope Luke doin good.  Such a beautiful song and voice💯💥
One of the most perfect fitting songs to play for a film’s end credits I’ve heard in while.

Damn this is a good song. ❤❤❤❤
This song right here has to be my favorite Luke Combs song. So much real feeling and heart.
My mom had " The Baby" from Blake Sheldon when she passed away in 2003. My Dad has this song and "Even Though I'm Leaving" for his songs from you Luke Combs.
You have a BEAUTIFUL HEART GREAT SONG 😊
I had the pleasure of meeting @adamchurch8244 tonight in my hometown he played to a audience of about 300 and you would have thought he was playing the biggest stadium in the world he put on a hell of a show and stayed out during his intermission to sign autographs and take pictures such a stand up guy I see you going places my friend keep up the good work
My favorite song……my anthem. When they ask about me—- tell them this!! I’d still be doing this If I wasn’t doing this How I feel about my career

Luke Combs is what happens when you combine song writing, technical skill, passion, drive and the ability to stay grounded all at a young age.
:  Everyone who reads this, we don't know each other and probably never will but I wish you all the best in life and all the luck in the world

That's my point n see ... See Daisy Mae Edberg Minnesota
Maybe a dumb question, but is Adam the son of Eric Church?
Goat of country music
He sounds so villainous every time he says “got the Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand”  I stg im dead
I Will this afternoon on the inlet your Ass is mine bitch
Mfer show them

Good Singer

We're the ones doing this
Muy bonita canción, ee de las pocas en donde tampoco he leído su letra, supongo o imagino lo que oigo, como a mi me gustaría leerlo, pero para gustos están los colores, cada cual imagine lo mejor para su cerebro. A mi me parecería más o menos bonita con o sin imágenes, pero no están mal las imágenes o lo que quiere representar, puede ser otra cosa, quizá no lo sé ni lo voy a leer, me basta con imaginarlo.
what a song man! 🤩
I love your music sir it just blesses me all of it.thank you!
That was a great thing he did now it is your turn to do something like that your self
Love yall stay redneck
I have 1 ? How the f#%@^$- does this song not have a millions and millions of likes I'm not going to lie I'm to drunk to spell a billion how did I spell it right
Love you Luke ❤
Right!  Not many songs I could put on repeat day in and day out but his is that song!  It’s amazing with an amazing story behind it!
Wow. Big question, both ways I d say faith WAS THE driven point
And here you have it people, the song that will define Luke Combs 🙌
It was so awesome when Luke said Adam church and the guy said that's a hell of a answer
❤❤❤❤❤❤🌍 205 ILLINOIS
❤❤❤❤
Wow legendary man. One love
0:22 The way Luke sings "what would you do" sounds like Freedom Isn't Free from the Team America soundtrack.
One of my favorites
After 13 years of doing this in Towson I am still doing this
Great song, video and artist!
ြမိ်မာကသီချင်းေလးကိုြကိုက်လို ့ြကည့်ြပီးအားေပးေနပါတယ်
Best country singer ever...get it buddy
You guys could pass as real brothers!! You look so much alike!😮
This song hits hard in winter for me cus my grandpa always  played it at that time
Here’s my stab at this beautiful song. Would really appreciate if you checked it out! https://youtu.be/Tw9oRhy3ijE
Honestly amazes me so much how some people can be lost in the world and not ever find there calling in life, but some who are like Luke, who was so sure of who he was going to become in life and nothing was going to sway in or change his mind. Thank you Luke for the motivation!!
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
I am doing this God damn Motherfucker everyday. I quit
i love how when your jamming to this song he cuts you off half way with the video💀 great song though man
July 8th can't come fast enough !!!!!!
Heard this song when I re-enlisted. Thanks
Tried for a long time 6 yrs
Get hub danni sue morris Rylee Harris Larry Harris

You know the first time i heard this kid i told everyone you watch hes gonna do great. And so far you havent proven me wrong. Thank you for all those songs youve done that has touched everyones soul. You are a great man and im proud to tell anyone im your biggest fan
This reminds me of my grandparents and I just want to tell those that have them, go visit them. I promise it won't be wasted time. xoxo
Best song ever Luke combs
Just beautiful 🤎
Your story is very inspirational at least from what I've heard.
great video, gives me chills. love all of your music. I hope that you come to play in Montana, Missoula area
I can't stress to you enough how much your music has helped me through my darkest and lowest points.
Luke is and always will be AMAZING!!!!
Don't you mean Eric Church?
This is by far one of my favorite songs.  Luke you are awesome.  Your concert in Oklahoma City was the best one I have seen.  I hope you continue to have great success with your family and your music.
Such a great song
You are truly the most talented artist that I’ve ever seen. Garth Brooks ain’t got nothing on you Luke!
I love this song so much
This is horrible. Thanks for sending this to me Gus. 2:41 seconds of my life just taken from me.
I need my old studio on my own radio station my phone ain't no good I got too much  my phone can't handle I wanted to do what I can for country music but I can't do it off into the mic
Not only is he mega talented, but, hasn't forgotten where he came from. Bucket list for this guy.
Luke and Cody Johnson make me restore my faith that country music isn't dying.
WOW!!  Thank you Luke!!!  I have been so depressed lately and this song just made me realize that I have so much ahead of me and so much in store.  I cried.  Thank you!
It's rare to see such raw talent in a person doing what they love for all the right reasons. Luke, the passion you and your group show in your music is something that should be treasured.  Keep doing what you're doing for the right reasons and we'll always be her supporting you!
I like this song but the tune sounds alot like holler boys by Ryan Upchurch
Your voice is amazing
The brainwashing for future Token Toby Kunta KinTAX payer SLAVERY starts for kids in PRE SCHOOL.  Americas Left Wing Communist leaders and Amwricas Right Wing Fascist leaders really do not give a shit at all about their WE THE PEOPLES of the USA all they give a shit about is their own greed and power and extending it whenever and where ever possible at the tax payers expense.
Awesome !!
The BEST song. Has been my favorite song of Luke's since it was released and this video moved me to tears. I believe him singing this.
A voice to hear

As a young black man who grew up in the inner city I never grew up listening to country music. I just want to say that Luke Combs I have tickets to your show in KC on June 10, and I CAN NOT WAIT!!! I’ve never been to a country show and this will be my first and I have never been this eager. I LOVE YOUR MUSIC!!

One he'll of a song
Just crazy how quick his career lifted off
Best  country music since Johnny Cash !!!
My favorite song ever
Pure Geneuis! Sounds still familiar and took a song called Dirt and made it better. Stopped me in my tracks of what I was doing...this is why I love music and it is my life!!!
Everytime I listen to this song it gives me goosebumps and most of the time I get teary eyes. Can't wait to go watch him and hopefully meet him. Love ya bud, keep doin this.
Saw this man live at the paycom center in Oklahoma City, OK. Best show ive ever been to!
morgan Wallen who???? best country artist goes to Luke Combs... fight me!!!!
Senssacional ❤

I love this man he gets me every time
😎😎😎😎 Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~to be part of any collaboration.   That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only one whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  I feel sorry for them........
I want to sing . I've been scared. But this is giving me motivation.  Just what to sing is the question
Tolles stimmen ich mag alle Lieder von dem singen hört habe mir CD gekauft
Did you mean Ryan Upchurch? Smh
I love this song! So much talent!
Damn great storytelling @lukecombs.
Mrs dunner miss wason
I had goosebumps the whole song probably my favorite. Great job, Luke and Adam.
Έρωτας❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank Upchurch for your come up.
The sheer power of this song hits like a wave.
I love this one ❤️ 💕 💓 💗
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Tender moments are the best
THIS SONG GRABS ME FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY SOUL....it soothes the secret unrest that gnaws at the roots of my being.....
Keep on doing what you do 👍
I must say…  I am in San Luis Potosí Mexico at the moment.  Here for work.  I’m from Mooresville, NC, 15 mins from luke’s hometown.  I don’t know this guy and he doesn’t know me..  but the music has helped me get laid in my own marriage several times.  It is super relatable.   Caused me to buy a “don’t mess with texas” t-shirt while traveling to Mexico with red dirt in my steel toes.   Thank you buddy.  I can’t wait to see my family next week when I get home.   That’s what I’d be doing if “I wasn’t doing this”.
Luke Combs is your friend related to the Karlucci‘s
Thank you for this song Luke, it inspired me to apply to graduate school , I love this song.
world class . super star luke
Every musician can relate to this, while we all want fame and money we also know that at the end of the day it's not the most important thing. Whether you change a single person's life for a night or influence millions, the ripples reach out far beyond what you could have ever expected. I'm working with a singer whose ex helped Luke go up, I'd rather not tell the names, but they're all great people! I wish to share a stage with you one day Luke - no matter the size!!
🙂your welcome and thanks again for your great videos on YouTube 👍🙃😊
Brazil 🇧🇷
Love this ❤️
Dude is really doing what he loves and it is one of the most inspirational things. Happy for you brother. Keep on doing this
This is a like, share, follow and i will listen to this many times TY (new discover)

If any country star can make waves in Africa it would be Luke Combs . He is as original as Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers who are legends in Africa
In a weid kinda way Luke's a preacher ...
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE CMA REWARDS BROTHER!!!!!
I feel ashamed I didn't see this until now. Adam, thanks for doing what you did to elevate Luke to be shared with the world. Luke, thanks for being awesome and bringing Adam along for the ride so he can start his own journey. The world needs more of you both.
Luke combs is great. He is 2nd to that Brooks guy in my favorites. I love this Combs guy.
This song applies to all who have found their true meaning in whatever they are doing. Me too it’d still be doing this if i wasnt doing this

This is a cold ass song..  gave me chills man.... 😝😬🥶🧊
Hubby of 41 years and me drove from Southern Minnesota to Omaha to see you last night. Man, you did not disappoint! Thank you for a fantastic show!
This is awesome.  He's amazing not only as an artist but a person
Carolina is proud!  ❤️
yes Mr Combs I am a true fan and life long supporter I just got your message today I had to reply like this because I couldn't find our Convo man you are my favorite country music artist I love all your songs man they really relate to me and how I grew up what makes it so awesome is your genuine a really good person with a huge heart like me you have given me so much inspiration in your songs there just isn't enough words to tell you man you truly are one of kind Mr Combs and for you to actually reply to me calling me by my name wow I've commented on so many artist and you are the only one that actually responded to me wow what a great day this is maybe one day implement this in one of your songs lol because you made my whole year
I know this is cheesy but I have couple of songs I'd like to see. I am trying to get someone to look at them . My husband is very sick if I could just sell even one it would help us so much.
This gives me all the feels. Thanks Luke! ❤️
i dont know why but this song makes me cry
The guy with no bad song
Luke Combs' "Doin' This" is a great country song, but I always feel like I'm missing something when I listen to it. With UnMixIt, I can remove the vocals and enjoy the song without the distraction of the singer's voice. It's also a great way to practice singing along with a song you know well.
Roll Tide! Love to see you duet with Riley Green some day
Luke combs you are the best country music singer in the world but I will never get go too one of your concert because of my health issues and mom is a big fan also I have had seizure all most 20 years and I  have bad eyesight keep putting out the awesome songs.
Damn you NC... 🙏🏾🍻
marg Damien Herrick joy brey gi
everytime i hear this song i bust into tears!!! i love this song and luke combs!! every song he sings touches my heart!! listening to him i could play a video in my head just because of the amount of emotion i can hear in his music when he plays..God bless him for blessing us with his music
Dall'italia, la potenza delle parole di una canzone arrivano fino a qui!
This dude knows how to put his feelings in his sons
this song made me cry the first time i heard it. Luke truely is in the wrong generation at the right time. He is one  of a kind. Never heard one bad song from this guy. Great job
Chills.
thank god, we ve got band here after a long time.
To put that naritive of black lives matter in Texas is outrageous you are a music channel not a political platform, you're making it hard for people like me to stay on you side!
I was at this concert and I wish I was at it again
Dreams, Live them just do it
When I picked up my car from the mechanic it was on 103.7  Tanner, and as I pulled out of the parking lot, this is the song I heard and have been listening to Luke Combs ever since.  Whoa!  I'm hooked.
Was doing this 25 years ago, bravo to you young fella. I'm still me after all this time but better than who I was .
@KAOSACTUAL_ OR @The Mag Dump Podcast Tell me the interviewer doesn't sound like Richard...
the passion in this song makes me tear up as I scring (scream sing) this song way to loud in my truck 🥴😂 that's what good music does
I love this man!
We love you Luke.  You are a great inspiration.
My wife played this song for me and I was in tears because, although I'm not famous, and have had to have jobs to support my music addiction, the feeling is the same. I've played on big stages and smoky little bars since I was 14, and I'm now 68, no signs of slowing down!
A man of his word.. not in it for the money. Bangor maine... refunded everyone's tickets... because he had a cold... still sang his heart out....best damn free show ever
Luke your awesome man
Morphed me back to 2005 and it felt amazing
Absolutely LOVE love this song.
Alot of Love from Africa Uganda 🤩
This song makes me emotional every time I hear it.. My favorite country singer ever 😢 we love you Luke ❤
You Sir should make a movie about how you reached where you are now. We'd be happy to watch you been through up and downs love from Philippines
ok this just encouraged me to keep writing songs.
Got my ticket to see him in Manchester next year , can’t wait 😆😆😆
Luke combs 🔥🔥
One of my favorite country  singers.....along with Chris Stapleton...
I incredibly love this song... Luke you have touched our hearts, we love you big in Uganda, Africa... Keep mending our hearts bro.

Can't believe you're coming to Australia Luke ❤️
i'd honestly love to see this man in concert more than anything, that would 100% be my dream before I die, i just know that concert tickets are crazy expensive and i could never bring together the money to do it. i'm always happy that luke combs exists and that he makes the best music i have ever had the privilege of listening to
🇧🇷❤🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵
Luke Combs is INCREDIBLE!!  To me, he's like country music's answer to Eddie LeVert. (if you don't know who Eddie LeVert is, ask someone... you might agree.) LOL 😆
Absolutely love this song and it's the best song hands down. It gives a lot of inspiration to everybody not just the ones who make it to the top, but to everybody who's doing what they love to do regardless of what they do.
Luke Combs is truly my auto
This song has been life changing for me! I played this song when I lost my grandpa February 6th to covid!!! A marine veteran who served in Vietnam!!!   It was also the song I just so happened to be listen to when I was blessed with an opportunity to start my own business!!  Luke thank you for this song!! You will probably never read this message but if you do this song changed my mentality and life!!!! Thank you!!
the best
Solid support for those two kids teaching them what working for what you want means and how important it is to support musicians/artists with money and not stealing music/art.  You made a new fan today and I will pay for the content I consume.   Thanks man.
I just saw that he refunded every one there ticket purchased,  bc he didn't feel he gave them a concert they deserved
Thanks to you both xx
👍😁
Those No name towns appreciate you

Great
Luke Combs signs from the heart, that is why he is loved by his fans
An answered prayer every time i hear it. I feel the same. Still be doing this if i wasn't doing this.
When I die, I want Luke Combs playing on a Radio at my Funeral.
Jesus!Luke Combs your blessed. I love your songs.
Hi i’m a really big fan
Adam church.    That's a good fucking answer
Tips in a jar motherfucker
This motherfucker saved my life period
Bad ass tune
I was working as a security officer and helping the people was my favorite thing to do, this song helped me through some tough days . I wish I could turn back time to all those late night shifts….
Hello from a deathmetal listener who generally detests this genre of music.  You have astounding talent. I'm glad you're living up to the namesake of this song. I'll most certainly be listening to more.
This song speaks to anyone that has a soul and feels musics! You killed it like always. Double high fives to you!
True County.
Please
Combs, needs to come to Colville WA,
Omg his songs give chills
Luke's music is like good ol' country! 💓 I love ❤ love ❤ love  relating to his music & allowing fantasies, fairytale & dreams  become reality! Hope there's a lot more to come. Congratulations on being a daddy!
This man never misses  His songs are so powerful and strong its certainly up there as one of my top favorites this or forever after all can bring tears to my eyes
Great song! Is Adam his friend?  Is he famous too?
HOPE YOU COME BACK TO VA BEACH....DISABLED VET HERE..USN...LOVE YOUR MUSIC
I really haven't listened to music in a long time,  until i stumbled upon your music! Luke, you have so much heart, reason and passion in your voice and lyrics.  your voice gives me chills!  you bless so many of us with the gift you have! God bless you brother!
Got this on repeat wearing my Luke Combs Blue Otter sunglasses and Blue Otter hat.
Wow!, such a good song, I just love it
Kane Brown is a joke!  . How does Kane Brown manage to stay in music business?   He should get fired, cuz because he can't even carry a tune.  His performances at the CMA always sucked.  He can't sing or rap!  What kind of a singer is he?   There's no future for singers like Kane Brown or Khalid.  Kane Brown can't carry anything on his own, he has to be part of a collaboration...I'm actually surprised anyone wants to work with him at all!  If truth be told, I'd bet Chris Young and Blackbear both were forced to do so.  No Kane Brown at CMA awards please.  He's nothing but a loser who is terribly overrated.   Luke is a great country singer, but there's no future for singers like Kane Brown and Khalid.  They both are a disgrace to real country singers like Chris Stapleton, Blake Shelton, Luke Combs, Keith Urban, Walker Hayes, Dan&Shay, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan
I love your song buttufull crazy
This literally is my son right now
This is a McKenney/ Connor family anthem.  Amazing family I was graced to be embraced by and lucky to be loved by their daughter, and sister.  She was a point of light,  I hope whoever she focuses on,  knows they are lucky
Incredible gravitas from such a humble frame
When you realize you're not doing something you'd be doing if you weren't doing this...
Future legend.

This is one of his best songs !! Love it ❤️
Luke wouldn't be comb be PICK TRUTH YOU SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT!!
Someone asked me once in an interview "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?"  I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge Tryin' to make rent with a dead end job, just makin' due With tips in a jar, my guitar and an old barstool  I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin' them same damn songs like I am now I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this  I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day Who was burnin' CDs just to give away Payin' his dues if I wasn't doin' this  Five deep in a van, head full of steam Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true Livin' this life just like I was born to do  I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin' them same damn songs like I am now I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this  It ain't about the fame It ain't about the fortune It ain't about the name It ain't about the glory I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about  Having a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin' them same damn songs like I am now I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this  Someone asked me once in an interview "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school?

I get chills and cry everytime the music builds up and he starts yelling the chorus and his friend Adam comes out.
Hey Luke Combs you look like my cousin Trevor
why the fuck is he holdin a guitar if he's not even playin it i mean, common guys.
Love your music...comes from the gut...it's real...makes you the best..God bless..keep it real

Your one of the best of all times I love all your songs
Read through the comments because I love this song and wanted to see what folks had to say. I found that Adam Church responded and commented on this song, a true friend and Gentleman and upon reading further I found that Luke Combs answered at least one of the comments and that tell me all I need to know about Luke Combs and Adam Church, true to the heart country folks.
Your both a class act
You  are awesome love to meet you sometime 👍🏻 keep playin your heart out! You keep sendin out that great music we keep feelin it 🙏🏻 wishing you the best on your journey!
LUKE UR THE BEST ARTIST EVER WELL TO ME AT LEAST OH AND IM UR BIGGEST FAN EVER!!!!!!!!!
That's a great 🎵
I can't wait till the day you come back to Australia and this time play at Rod Laver arena. My family and I have been to every Luke Combs Melbourne concert and are just waiting for the next.
Your best song yet Packed with emotion Which really shine thru.  Keep country alive!
I love your songs I Memorise  all your songs I’ll love singing them I hope you follow your dreams
Good tune, song writing is average, the performance is top notch and production is great. 8/10
Simply great to see such friendship to say the least. Inspirational, motivating and comforting.
It’s really hard to argue that luke isn’t one of the best country artist ever… or I’m just biased but every song he makes just hits man..
Saludos desde Argentina. Soy un fans de la musica Country. Saludos querido Combs. Que Dios te bendiga.
official.Luke.Albert.combs.1
A very well written song..
For the record..it's hard to name every town.😉
I want to know where this super star came from?
Love your music brotha...🍻🇺🇸
Love hearing this on the radio!! Great song, Luke
Everytime I hear this song. I have to stop what I'm doing and sit and sing along.
Omg he is the king of country music! 😍❤️ luv ya Luke!❤️❤️
If Adam Church is such a great friend why not do a song with him rather than cut in the middle of the song with an awkward interview scene. Adam Church is really good, he isnt just saying that.
You got to come to Scotland one day 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Comments 4k mine won't be read by many and that's OK. Luke Combs has my heart and I share his music with everyone I know. Thank you, thank you, THANK  YOU
hands down one of my top 5 favourite singers. cheers from Portugal.
Justin here makes me believe that everything does happen for a reason and that if you had a choice you wouldn't do things different because even as fucked as it is it had a purpose
This song gives me memories about back in the day’s memories in Lompoc CA
I like Luke's music so much I have a lot of his songs on my play list. Saw his baby was born on Fathers Day I to was a Fathers Day baby in 1960 my dad and I always had a special bond I lost him in  2010 but have never forgot his love .May you always feel the bond between a Father and your child..
Great song i shed a tear ngl!!
💔💔💔 Who's Lauren Alaina?  A good question.   This is a fact.  About 12 years ago, there was a boy who who committed suicide because she made fun of him being gay.  She bullied him, harassed him, and pushed him around everyday and called him all kinds of name in the book.  As a result, he took his own life.  She was a school bully back then, now she's an online bully/troll.  Lauren Alaina will always be remembered as a loser and online troll who has never made it in real music industry.  She has no life and has too time on her hands!  Kim English is Lauren Alaina's mother.   She keeps coming back here, because she has some explaining to do why her daughter (Lauren Alaina) bullied the boy?   Hello.  She's all over the place on youtube trying to get her daughter (Lauren Alaina) into music industry, but no matter what she does, it's not gonna happen.   Kim English is Lauren Alaina's mother.  Watch, she's gonna bark at me like a dog....funny woman....lol
I do love a lot of Luke combs songs but this one just comes off cocky as hell. Gets a thumbs down.
Love ko

This man’s very inspirational. Most of his songs gives you chills. My fav artist!
What does his hat say ?? #dointhis
If you know what it’s like to be in the Marine Corps infantry and get out, this song really speaks to you. Getting out today and I couldn’t hold back the tears.
Luke Combs is one of us 👏💪
Thanks for helping me show my buddy’s that we always as man will go FORWARD…

This video gives me chills!!!
You seem like such a great guy. Keep coming with the great songs. I know every song you sing word for word. Loving it!!!!! YOU'RE my favorite country artist
I’m that guy. After 20+ years I’m not doing it but I’m still doing it. What else is there? This song kills me.
Can we all just take a moment to thank God for Luke Combs!!!!? Can I get an Amen??
I love your song I listen to it all the time
I was brought up on AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, Bryan Adams, Springsteen and the likes.  At 21, we had CMT Europe on Sky TV in the UK.  Oh my GOD, was I hooked right away!  Country has a vibe like no other music genre.  It's a story to music.  Immerse yourself in the lyrics, FEEL the music that goes along with it.  Luke Combs embodies everything that is great about Country right now.  Have a great day everyone and LLAP :)
💖💖💖
Man, this song brought me to tears, overwhelmed me at one point. I'm a country musician as well, I've always had a good group of people around me telling me I'm incredibly talented but here I am now at age 48 playing my songs to my friends and family and I never "made it".  But this journey with music saved my life, especially at times when I felt no self worth.
Luke call me your song is so good I'm going to give you a billion I'm going to give you a million thousand hits for it
YOOOOOO THIS IS FIREEEEEEEE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
my guy luke never misses 🤙🇺🇸💙
Idk if I’d be here without luke Combs music
Good luck
Or up on the stage with a duet mamacita
@worldwidesummer22 #huhhiphopcountrydirtywhiteboyz oh boy, it's like I'd be doin this.... Singing Dem dirty rap songs

Yeah
My very favorite my Grandson and i both turn it up loud and sing to it. Thanks for the memorys with my Grandson. Love it. 💕💕💕
Awesome song dude keep em coming
Luke,.. this song makes me take a big slow breath as it walks me right back in the middle of those days on stage with my cousins and I playing,.  Some of the old band have passed on now,.. gone way too young and too soon,.. but one of the son's of the band have carried on, go Michael Ray,.. but this song hits home,.. it's not about the fame, it's not about the fortune,.. it's always been about those Friday night crowds and doing it all with a group you'd give your life for,.. thanks Luke for reminding me of that and taking me back to yesterday even if it is for a few minutes at a time!
Just to think of all the artists who haven't made it big, but are still doin this now.
God bless you Adam Church!
Luke Combs your songs are good
LUKE COMBS (2022) – DOIN´ THIS (Traducción en español) Someone asked me once in an interview Alguien  me preguntó una vez en una entrevista  "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school? “¿Cómo fue crecer? ¿Donde fuiste al colegio?  And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?" ¿Y que harías si no estuvieras haciendo esto?”   I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge Estaría conduciendo mi primer coche, un viejo Dodge hecho polvo  Tryin' to make rent with a dead end job, just makin' due Tratando de pagar el alquiler con un trabajo sin futuro, sencillamente haciendo lo debido  With tips in a jar, my guitar and an old barstool Con propinas en un tarro, mi guitarra y un viejo taburete   I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Tendría al público del viernes noche en la palma de mi mano  Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Una copa de licor marrón, un par de colegas en una banda  Singin' them same damn songs like I am now Cantando aquellas malditas mismas canciones como estoy ahora  I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Estaría sintiéndome genial en un escencario de madera  Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins Luces brillantes como rayos corriendo por mis venas  At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town En el Grand Ole Opry o en un espectáculo en algún pueblucho  I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this Estaría aún haciendo esto si no estuviera haciendo esto   I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day Aún sería el mismo tipo que conocieron en aquellos tiempos  Who was burnin' CDs just to give away Que grababa Cds solo para regalarlos  Payin' his dues if I weren't doin' this Pagando sus deudas si no estuviera haciendo esto   Five deep in a van, head full of steam Una furgoneta hasta los topes, a todo trapo  Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true Pisándole los talones a mis sueños de neón quizás haciéndose realidad  Livin' this life just like I was born to do Viviendo esta vida como nací para hacerlo   I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Tendría al público del viernes noche en la palma de mi mano  Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Una copa de licor marrón, un par de colegas en una banda  Singin' them same damn songs like I am now Cantando aquellas malditas mismas canciones como estoy ahora  I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Estaría sintiéndome genial en un escencario de madera  Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins Luces brillantes como rayos corriendo por mis venas  At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town En el Grand Ole Opry o en un espectáculo en algún pueblucho  I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this Estaría aún haciendo esto si no estuviera haciendo esto   It ain't about the fame No es por la fama  It ain't about the fortune No es por la riqueza  It ain't about the name No es por la reputación  It ain't about the glory No es por la gloria  I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about Supongo que estoy diciendo que siempre ha sido por   Having a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Tener al público del viernes noche en la palma de mi mano  Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Una copa de licor marrón, un par de colegas en una banda  Singin' them same damn songs like I am now Cantando aquellas malditas mismas canciones como estoy ahora  I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Estaría sintiéndome genial en un escencario de madera  Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins Luces brillantes como rayos corriendo por mis venas  At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town En el Grand Ole Opry o en un espectáculo en algún pueblucho  I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this Estaría aún haciendo esto si no estuviera haciendo esto  Someone asked me once in an interview Alguien  me preguntó una vez en una entrevista  "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school? “¿Cómo fue crecer? ¿Donde fuiste al colegio?  And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?" ¿Y que harías si no hubieras estado haciendo esto?”
You Luke are the Allen Jackson of my generation. No one comes close to your pure country sound.
Luke thank you for this sweet song. ❤❤❤
Omg 😭😭 you're AMAAAAZING
101-10 song
Man, you just make my tears drop, bc the feel of the song so deep to me. ❤❤❤
You go mate! And enjoy some time off with that baby.
Love his music from Lancaster England can't wait to see if he does a UK tour
I love the music.
Blue skyz Buddy!!!!!   skybill
Keep up the 🔥 work Adam Church live up to the last name brother 😉💯
Wow this guy is an awesome talent, I started listening to his music after reading a news article about him and haven't yet listened to a song of his that I didn't like which says a lot for how talented he is.  Such a fan, love his voice, music and authenticity, reminds me a lot of Chris Stapleton who I am a real fan of for the same reasons as I am a fan of Luke's.  Country music is in great hands with the likes of Luke and Chris, genuine, authentic beautiful people who make great music.
This east texas boy lives for his music. https://youtu.be/oQNBU82L-kw
Luke combs is a true artist!!! And a wonderful guy because he NEVER forgot where he came from. He is true to the core and that's why I am a luke combs superfan!! I'm also a Carolina boy. Luke is the man and I love his duet with Eric Church! I wish u all the best luke and I admire you for acknowledging Adam in this song....it's always the people that helped you along the way that mean the most no matter how big u get and that's why I have the UTMOST respect for luke combs!! I'd love to have a beer with luke 🍺
Zaxbys Zakazaml))))))¿¿¿¿
He is the male Taylor swift unfortunately
Amazing!
Another country legend.
AMAZING!!! 🙌  I absolutely LOVE this song!
Hats off and drinks up to the man that saved country music, Luke Combs.
Your music always take me to sleep!!!!   You deserve your name
OMG goose bumps when He said Adam Church what a friendship friggin' awesome.💞💞 The song gave me goose bumps, it made me think to what would I be doin' now. Great song Luke and Adam thank you 💖💖
Gawd, I love his music. Gets you in the feels. And so humbling. He's on my bucket list. Incredible talent.
Fucking love it man! Ur a legend keep it coming bro🍻
Love your music
Your sweet.
He’s back!!!
I love your songs
Awesome
super...james
I just had the chance to see this GOAT at the CMA and been a person from Latinamerica who doesnt know much about country music i'm amazed by the feeling Luke can transmit with a song i just can't get over it. Hoping he keeps getting that feeling to alot more people
Didn't like this song when it came out but now I do
I've seen you at stagecoach and just now at cma fest, you always sing with so much heart and it shows that you love what you do.  Thank you
This song hit me so hard. Makes me thinking of my dad, having crowds in in the palms of his hand with his buddies playing his same sets for 20 years... big shoes too fill.
💐
We all need Jesus
This is a great song, and I feel it all the way to my soul... I wanted to be a rock star, then a country star.. I settled for bass player in dive bars, V.F.W.'s...  I haven't been in a band for years... Was never good enough to be a front man.... I can write songs... I have 21 on you tube.... Predivorce paranoia is my most popular song... If not for you tube, no one would hear my songs..... Thanks Luke, you hit the nail on the head.....
The "Easter Eggs" in this video are awesome!
As I'm driving first time listening to this song in full and really taking in the lyrics......chills and burst out in tears....no other words....
This is one of my favorite songs. I sing it as hard as you do in my 2002 sunburnt toyota solara
Song gives me goosebumps. So relatable
Dammit man. I feel like this could've been written about Dimebag Darrell. It's why he's no longer with us. His love of being on the stage, in front of 100 or 1 million people. He was comfortable in either place.  I think of him every damn time I hear this song. 😢 Rest in Peace, D.
Luke is a cold dude...💯💯💯
Luke Combs is now on my Favorite Artists list. He have an amazing voice and I really love his songs. Also, he is a nice person❤️❤️❤️
This man has a great voice
❤️❤️❤️
Luke Combs is one of my favorites ever 🎶❤️

Knoxville when??
I think he meant to say upchurch not Adam church 😂
He had so many good songs but this is my favorite!
I'm digging this cat...such a Hardcore voice with passion for his craft... I'm a black dude by the way. Music is eclectic and universal and brings the multitudes in unison. 🤜🏽🤛🏻
✨♥️🌈🌟🌟💥
THIS IS A AWESOME SONG AND IT HITS HOME AND THANK YOU LUKE COMBS FOR THIS SONG ALONG WITH THE REST OF THEM
The passion he sings with is amazing.
10 years from now I will still be listening to this song...
I would be outside cutting crops like I do while listening to your good music
Love the song and the video, love that he and Adam Church are "tight".  Beautiful....
LOVE how Luke is still close with Adam Church and is honoring him for being such an amazing friend and one of his greatest supporters. You're a diamond in the rough Adam! Everyone should be so lucky to have such an amazing human like you in their life. This song gives me the chills & makes me cry. Especially when Luke says "and he helped me when he didnt have to, his name, is Adam Church". Beyond touching ❤
Love it brother
one of the best vocalists you will ever hear sing right here folks!!!!!
dumbest most over played song ever its like you made this song cause you know it'll be played on radio but ain't nobody adding it to there Playlist
I Love This Song 🧡🥰

I've been listening to Luke Combs since Hurricane, inspired me to learn country songs to sing to my girlfriend.
Honestly luke combs is my favorite. I’m not a big country music type girl, but ever since I listened to luke I love country music. Keep doing what your doing!!!!
Big respect to Luke for putting his friends on and giving them credit
I hope that every dream him and his family have will be answered what an amazing person...
Wow, made me cry!
Cool Buddies helping each other!

Hello brother! I never reached out before but something told me to! I'd like to write a song with you! I don't want any money or popularity, rather just to write a bad ass song wit you!  I can send you what I was thinking! I promise you it will be epic. It's crazy man. When you came out I felt like I was a long lost brother. I know that sounds bat shit crazy but I felt it in my gut. So I said eff it! I'd reach out to you and worst-case -you can't.. And believe me bro I totally get it! I build Fence.. Offical Bull Fence on FB, ny. I work sun up to sun down, 7 days a week to ensure I can survive the winter & make it to the spring.  I would understand if your just to busy.. I know all about being busy! I play Guitar!  I wanted to make a Hard Core Metal Country tune with you! I have a shit ton of songs you can have. Like I said, I just like to jam and have a few beers! If not, I totally get it Brother! God Bless you and the roads you travel! Hail the light and keep it tight!💯🏅 P.S. I subscribed to your channel!
tears my heart into pieces, man  - so good!!

♥️🇺🇸🦾🍻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏽
I'd pretty much given up on today's country music when I heard this song on our small-town radio station.  What a refreshing sound and hope for the future.  Thanks for doin' what you're doin.
All the road-dog's out there be honest when you first heard this song who thought he said Crown Liquor in his hand..
I LOVE watching Luke Combs grow to his passion goal.  He is my role model.  His songs hit home, they make me want to strive more while I am writing my next novel.  Keep making songs.   I am HUGE fan here.  I love the fact that you stayed true to your roots.   I am really impressed that you have a best friend that you can join the journey with.. Great job Adam Church!!!
I'm 42, never liked country, always tried too, but never did...  ...until I heard Luke Combs. His songs speak to me. I'm just a city boy who wants to live a country life.
I love luke he is my favorite country singer can't wait to go to his concert ❤😘💯
Thank you Luke Combs for the great music. I've dreamed of doing music but always been scared to do it in front of people I'm a chicken shit 😂😂
I'd still be doin this if I wasn't doin this. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Much Love From Southern California Brother…
Damn you can sing.
https://youtu.be/vuyyD5bhinc if anyone reading this could take some time and check out this raising artist Colt Graves and his debut single "Lonesome Roads". 🔥 song and would love to get a listen and reply from Luke Combs himself 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
At every turn Luke Combs affirms how much he deserves every great thing that happens to him. Such a good man.
I have never listened to Luke much but my 16 yr old daughter loves him so much.  Her birthday is in 3 days and we are going to see him in concert. Happy Birthday Sissy.
I remember now how much my dad loves this song and it reminds me of him and how I love spending time with him and his girlfriend ❣️It reminds me of my mom working hard for us and our 6 pets to

It not about the fame, not about the fortune, it ain't about the name, it ain't about the glory, it's about the no name towns.
Luke Combs, someone who loves you.  Has supported you and been at your shows my post was taken down 30 minutes ago.  I don't get that that.
Luke, you need to address this with me.  I'm a no name town.
Adam this has nothing to do with you I will be viewing your songs.
If you want me to respect Adam Church then you need to respect me, I'm not a no name town.  Luke, the song is great, like everything you do. If you want me to respect Adam don't put me down.
Don't say no name towns.  Luke we support you the no name towns it cost me $1,200 last time is way at your concert.  I do support you and anyone you want me to do. I'm not a no name town.
I love your music! 💐
This Truly is my favorite song I know every word
Best new song I've heard in a long time...
Never will I ever forget singing drunk as shit at portos in Boone while Adam and Luke sang. Good Ole sticker guitar days. Miss em

You are my favorite country singer
just heard this on the radio on the way home from the grocery store. great stuff man. cheers from hawaii.👍
Man you are truly honored and you have a home w me if all else ever fails.. your voice soothe the most broken souls
I tried to stop doing what I do. It's no use I can't stop. For some reason I do what I do because the Lord wants it as such.
I'm from Liverpool, UK, and throughout my life, I've listened to a range of music genres, from rap to classical.  I accidentally discovered country music recently when I was driving the kids to school and, for some unknown reason, the radio was tuned to a local station called Absolute Country. I was rushing to get them to school so I left it on and heard one or two songs that I really liked. One of which was Why We Drink by Justin Moore.  I got home and started watching Justin Moore videos on YouTube and that night I decided to put Apple Music Country radio station on while I fall asleep.  At some point in the night, this song came on and it woke me up it was soooo good. Just laying there half asleep listening to this unbelievable song while the rest of the world was asleep.  I'm hooked now! Thanks, Luke Combs and thanks for American Country Music.
Love this super country  singer...listen to his music  all the time....A true super star
I've only played this song over 20x in a row. But it's music that gets me going.  Damn my misfortune for not putting myself out there like Luke.
This guys is the reason I like country music now. Thank you Luke Combs
My God his voice is powerful!!
I love this song
LETS GO LUKE
Love you babe
I am sure I am not the only one unhappy with the views, this is a great song ...
Absolute art, I am so excited for the full album!
Brother, I love everything you have put out. Work over 80 hrs a week. But your music brings me back to being normal. Thank you.
Reminds me of a conversation I had with my rocker. Not so famous now how was it singing to a casino crowd? I mean, from stadiums to small crowds, what’s the difference? He said not a thing. Ten people are gonna get the same show as 100,000. It’s what I do.
I love this song and literally got goosebumps when he introduced Adam in the video
A humble guy that we are all thrilled made it big, couldn’t have happened to a better guy! Go buddy ✌🏼
I remember  this song love country
Such a great song,!💯🇺🇸☘☘☘☘👍
Luke Combs is the one of the most amazing talent I have seen, brother you rank with me, witch means nothing in the general scheme of things a George Strait comparison, and probably better in concert. Love All your music.
Want my free Bar? I've seen, Santa, & God there, if you care, like me too? Ask, easy, to find, like you! Lonely, town, I cried, too Z: ^7
Can't get this song out if my head. Makes me want to rewind my life and pick a different path.
i absolutely love this music video so much!!!!! <3

Luke Combs I want to thank you for your music you are the only reason that I don't end my life right now at this moment im tearing up bc your my favorite singer in the world I just want to thank you if this post gets at least one hundred likes I will get the help I need but in the mean time I will keep listening to you music thank you
This guy is single handedly saving country. Luke you're the man, keep on rockin'
Wonderful to see REAL MEN giving others a helping hand and a boost. Everyone has some kind of takent; not all people get such an opportunity. BEAUTIFUL STORY OF HOW THE WORLD WORKS WHEN PEOPLE LOOK OUT FOR OTHERS.  Both Luke & Adam seem so humble, down to earth, and like they just genuinely love performing to make people happy.....PRETTY DAMN PERFECT!!!❤🍀 SPREAD THE LOVE
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand,....Oh Luke, you do....
I can relate to this and thank you for triggering this in me. This reminds me that no matter how hard my day is that I am going to do my best to always remember where I came from to get here.  In my mind where I am today is alot better than where I was then and this is 100 percentpositive.  Thank you again!
what a beautiful song.
GO ON LUKEEEEEEE WE LOVE YOUUUUUUUU
I love this ❤ period. That's all there is to say
Ascultati piesa asta a lui Luke Combs !        I love this song
What I wouldn't give to.be their  live!
Luke combs is an artist who doesn't forget where he came from,  and acknowledged his beginnings
Isn't this Luke the guy who rode of up church's fame.
so good !  ! TOP
STAGECOACH TODAY. CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SUNDAY!!!
Do what you love and you never work a day in your life.
He is the reason I got a guitar you are a inspiring person
😂 😂 it’s so funny that I get laughed and pointed at when I’m blasting this shit in my car just because I’m black!! Love some Luke Combs!!
“At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no name town.” 🔥
Wow, that's about all I can say. Great job Mr. Combs.
So moving I WATCH IT DAILY ,keep up the good work !
Absolutely gives me chills. This song is amazing.
If he did this with Ashley McBride...  ...it would be EPIC!
He's coming to Quebec City this July 8th, I'm going to be there and I can't wait.
This might be his best song to date.

Love his music
What a beautiful thing to see.  Thank you Adam and thank you Luke for doing what you do.  From someone who used to play for a living it's so great to see your dreams come true Luke.  The first time I heard this song it took me right back to playing in nightclubs and having those nights where everything went right and the crowd was right there with you.  God bless you and your family and thank you Adam for helping this guy get out there where all of us can see him do what he was born to do.
Ty
Great Song!  You've got to be one of the top writers in modern country.  I'd put you up there with Garth Brooks and Allen Jackson.  I'm a rocker, but I really enjoy your music. God Bless!
CHILLS...guys...this is an amazing song/tribute.  🙏🏽🫡🫡🫡
Luke’s songs just give you chills man. This song hits hard

Every song this guy sings makes me cry for a different reason and I F'n love it.
I think this song means . He finally got a shot at the American dream . It changed his life forever . Now he has something to live for , a wife and family . And he's doing what he loves . Fame and Fortune are nice too .
Love his voice!!
He’s so awesome, love this song. My home is not far from Boone. ❤️❤️

Usually its the words or the voice that get u in this its both bravo
The chorus of this song gives me chills every damn time
I love Luke Combs music. The song Doin this showed me that he never up his dream. He is an awesome singer. So for me the song Doin this 8s my anthem to never give up
Every drum beat literally sent shivers down my spine. Wanting to be an author, the lines, 'it ain't about the fame, it ain't about the fortune, ain't about the name, ain't about the glory,' hit me hard, because the only reason I want to be an author is to make kids feel like I do, and to inspire people to do what they want, whatever it is. Because it isn't about the glory, name, fame, fortune, or much else than that. And, even if it was, you don't know whether you'll be a hit or not. It's all just a flip of the coin.
Listening From Kenya..
Okay I said all those things before they watch that video please revert back to all the words that I said previously please I'm begging you and Ryan Upchurch you guys used to smash it and now this is all gay and I can't listen to it
Dear Luke Combs please let your other ball drop please go back to what you were doing please grab a rebel flag and be proud please go back to being your patriotic self and stop trying to be somebody you're not please stop hanging out with that where's Waldo looking person grab the nearest bottle of whiskey and a can of Copenhagen and write a f u c k i n g country song I'm your biggest fan
One of the best songs I've ever heard ! Love these real story songs makes my heart ❤️ melt
Such a great song and mutual admiration of friendship. True Country from the heart 💯⭐️ We all need more of this and friends like that.
This song is such an inspiration.
Sophia CD demo leek sleep xoxo also sleep World pro do xll?xx!?xlxlxx!

Hey love Shalimar
Luke combs music forever
Listening this shit after 5 o clock some where with my gas light on ... Best ever .. no worries
I’m Mexican and this guy Is my idol
I love this song. Brings up such strong emotion
😎😎😎😎 Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~to be part of any collaboration.   That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only one whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  I feel sorry for them......
Go Mountaineers!!!
Not gonna like beginning of the video made me laugh
We're here for ya
I can't wait to bring my baby boy to one of your concerts, he's 6 now so we're coming Luke . I've never been to any concerts in my 39 years of life so I'm happy to share my first experience with my one an only true love
Nice one Luke
This song is so good!!!
Luke Combs is true country and thankfully keeping it alive
Your my favorite country singer
This song is so inspiring!
You recognized Adam Church but not Ryan Upchurch; who put your name out there.  Sellout.
If I ever get famous I pray I can have the same mindset as Luke ! Seems like no matter what happens to him, good or bad, he stays down to earth and is just an average guy!
There is no other singer that I listen to, I love every single song you sing.
Your are such a super nice person and I really love this song and video..
Best County song I’ve ever heard!
All  respect Luke I’m one of your biggest fan Becuase I can relate to your song
Crazy cause if I play country it's been Luke combs and it never dissapoints
I’m away from home making my way and just know your music gets me through alot … thank you
Luke, you are the real deal.Your songs are so beautiful and from the heart. The way country music is meant to be. Thank you for doing it your way bringing it back and sharing your gifts with the world. Teach your baby to play. God bless you and your family!
Why does this song give me chills every time
I gotta say, this is a wonderful song. I dont normally listen to country much. But Luke Combs voice is just brute power and this ode to being a musician and being on stage? Just beautiful. I love it.
L.c.is my favorite country singer
I Adore  This Song
Subscribed and liked 👍 ,,,,, need a 5 string ?
I❤kM
There’s that old George Jones song who’s gonna fill their shoes I used to listen to it and wonder the same thing but I stand corrected now this guy can definitely fill and wear those shoes. Luke is gonna be our generation legend🤟
Love this song
I love the message of this song. Even if he wasn't selling out concerts all over the world, Luke would still be singing as much as he could, I mean, he could've not been discovered at all and he wouldn't care. That's why I love him, and country music in general because it's all about having fun singing and hanging out with people.
This is definitely my favorite songs 🎵 Love it!! So many emotions come to me with this song🗡🕊
It's such a great song...
I really like this song. “I’d still be doin’ this if I wasn’t doin’ this ~❤️”There's a video of dancing to this song. Let's enjoy it together~ https://youtu.be/uej-BtIKTRQ
How can I get you to come play at my wedding this coming October down in North Ga?
not my favrit
love this song
This song is amazing!! Is there any way someone can put me in contact with Luke to possibly sing happy birthday to my wife today? It's her 35th. Please?!
Probably the greatest Country music voice of all time. One of a kind Luke!!!!
You are a legend in the making, Luke. Keep doing what you're doing... LEGEND.
so he fades UPCHURCH?.... ok
Man I love his music, my wife and I listen to his music daily, great man🤟🏾
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Imagine the number of people who come here every day to hear this music; it's legendary!! I can't get this song out of my head, and the video is fantastic as well ❤
Absolute garbage
All the country music singers these days look like people i went to school with. They all look like good ol boys.
I want to see Luke Combs and Morgan Wallen do a song together!! It would be unreal.  You guys are the best, we adore you! your music helps us get through so many things. God bless you! x
🇧🇷💚🇧🇷💚
Love this song!! Adam, you the man too!
My dad loves this song
Thank you for sharing your soul with us Sir. 😜
hi Luke. her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine she takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything. huge fan this is a little surprise for you.
Your music is just so dang good
Love luke combs voice
I’m a total Metalhead and yet I love like combs all the way
This made me cry ✔️💞💯
scooby do in this ?
Please tell me luke took care of you and your family...because you did his?
I guess I just got to the level...country...rock...alt...rap...r.b...what have you.....a good song or music...doesn't really have boundaries....hey we're all in this shit together....and it's ok...to grow up or be raised on different style....that's what we were founded on....never forget
Seeing this guy live Thursday night been a dream of mine can't wait!!!!
CHILD ABUSE!!!!!!!!!!!! 1:00 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just seen the video of your fan following y'all and you pulling over and meeting him. You made that man's and his pregnant wife's whole life. You are such a genuinely beautiful person, Luke. Thank you for existing, sir. My hat's off to you, Mr. Amazing.
Im not even country and this song is the shit,this guy is amazing what a voice and a story of fantastic words telling it like it is.Holy Shit
This man - Luke Combs - is a true inspiration… his humble attitude and dedication to his craft shines with every song/every lyric that comes out of his mouth I’m from Baltimore and I don’t really even like Country music, a few songs here and there, but I dig this guys style and his songs become stuck in my head… Great work man, keep doing what you do, you are awesome!
Every musician I know can relate to this...at every level. When I was 20 I couldn't fathom playing music when I was 30...30 to 40...40 - 50...I'm 53 now, have over 100 more shows booked this year and not even thinking about next year yet...You nailed it Luke!! We all keep doing it for something...could never put a finger exactly on the why...but this is it...the pure joy, experiences, friendships...they're all priceless. Thanks for figuring it out and putting in a song!
This song❤️❤️❤️ When it comes on, i rush to crank it up
💛💛💛
This song gives me Chills ! Damn Luke I’m glad they ask u that in a interview 😊
Please drop good ol days
Luke your one of kind and I love your music.
Thank you,please pray for me  losing a best friend to covid 19 happened to me  last February, I saw Brooke last Valentine's day 2021,her wedding anniversary, she had warned me  some of her family members had been sick with covid 19,I knew  she was sick  on February 21,2021 at the hospital here in Gaffney sc ,but she had a fever and had trouble breathing, she was tested positive I knew, she fought 3 days,but lost her life  it's been a nightmare honestly, never telling her goodbye at all, only at her memorial service, she told me sge was scared to die, she did after they took her oxygen therapy mask off, she flatlined, I never saw her again  I just need a friend, two months later my other bff passed away
🔥🔥🔥
I heard Luke combs been quarantine god bless him he wont be on the cmt awards because it god bless you and your health. Feel better soon 😰😰😰😰
The Grand Ole Opry isnt a no name stage.. lost respect
This world would be much better if we all cared about other people more.  Adam you’re a good man whether you helped Luke to the top or just being a good guy to any other guy you didn’t know reach his potential.
I agree with so many others.   1) This song is nothing short of amazing! I can feel almost every lyric. *I’ve got the fuel, the fire, the heart and the courage to put it all out there but I’m *Not doing that!   I write ALL the time. You know how the heart and mind like to communicate and agree on things at the most in opportune times, don’t they.  Like while driving, working, shopping, sleeping, etc… when they not only collide but agree on something, such as “messages” (better known to listeners as “lyrics”) What do we do?… We write them down!   Right?  -Right!   Anyway, I’ve stayed entirely too busy with many many other ventures/occupations in life to even think of pursuing a change.  But I swear, I’d absolutely love to at least share a few “messages” with the world before I leave this place.  Look me up if you ever get bored and want to reach out to another small town North Carolina boy (with ONE HELL of a story) and see what I have to offer (give!) or at least get a quick laugh and some good humor!   Lol   Eitherway, I love your music, your energy, your humbleness and the “messages” that you deliver with clarity!   Keep doing what you do!    🇺🇸✊🏻
In this video who is the "interviewer"? He reminds me of Chris Baird a youtuber I follow!!
Love your voice!!! Get well soon Luke!!!🙏
His voice pierces my soul❤️😘😍
Yessahh ✊🔥🔥
Love it good job
I love your music I can’t sleep and your music is so soothing

“i’d still be doing this, if UPCHURCH didn’t help me”
This is why I love Luke Combs, and love each of his songs and videos more than the last. Luke's talent, raw emotion and story telling ability is second to none, and he doesn't forget his past or where he came from. Keep it up, man....keep it up!
Pretty much FAME WILL NOT CHANGE ME LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!
But did you take care of him???
I know that I feel sad sometimes I feel so emotional about my past I know that I hurt badly sometimes if I give up I would keep on hurting I wouldn't have no body on my side I wouldn't have god on my side but I do have these things I am thankful for these things but I wish I didn't have a sad childhood plus I wish my mom didn't rob the bank if she didn't do that I would be happy but I will be ok but mom why did you do this to me why you don't you feel like the way I do I feel like you don't see my pain my sorrow my life has been a big very disappointing without you here I feel like I am a child who is still locked up in her past I am sorry that I feel sad or the way I am feeling towards you I wish you did do this why do I deserve this pain I am not perfect but I know god can help me oh lord help me find me away to be less sad help me find some peace and less hurting
Beautiful song 🌷

Love when he smiles! He needs to do that more often like the beer song!!!!
This man is amazing! Wish i could see him once singing live!
So whenever I get stoned I start singing this now. My neighbor asked if I was Luke Combs... I laughed my ass off.
Not bad . I'ii sub in on that.
Top de mais🤩🤩🤩❤
I Love this Song❤❣️ It is one Good Story Song❣️
And its funny young legend opposites but he gt it
This guy is already a young legend n country music in my opinion
🇧🇷♥️
should be at 1 billion views ... much love from KENYA!!!
I absolutely love his voice and his music, all of it hits close to home😍😍😍😍
Think this is my favourite song from Luke Combs.   I love his other songs but this is a great song with real emotion
I love all of your songs! I hope I'll see you one day. Much love from The Netherlands. ❤
If u wasn't doing this you'll still be getting famous off of Ryan upchurch 🤣
this song is all over the radio love it <>  best song ever on repeat
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day Who was burnin' CDs just to give away Payin' his dues if I wasn't doin' this  That's my best part, i love Luke.
Going to find Adam Church videos right now!
I’d like to see what he could have done on his own. Now that he sold out he is just a pretty boy singing pretty songs.
Luke Combes  you keep this up you will be the next , Merle Haggard ,The old possum, Lefty, George Jones( Who's gonna feel their shoes  ) that some big shoes  but you're the one that can
Great song Luke! Not a bad life either way..
Happy Birthday Luke..🎂🎂🎂
This is my favorite song
Love seeing people at his level of fame shouting out to the people who helped them get there and how much their fans are what keeps them going since it’s not the money they are doing it for it’s for the hope that their songs even if just one person is helped thanks to their song then they have done a good job at the song they do it to share a life message or something like that is why songs like this are so popular they are not about the stereotypes that country music is girls and drinking and such but about something people can relate to and learn from and take to their day or with them the rest of their lives and to help them through tough times or something like that. As well as the fact that they are down to earth like the rest of us and so and so. I love country music that’s like that it helps me through things and motivated me to persue what I am in life. And just to work to be a better human being thanks to music like this and they stick with me. Thanks to all those who write songs and preform them! Keep it up! Like this if you agree.
Happy Birthday Luke 🎉🎉🎉🎈🎈👍👍
I love ur music u the best😊
I love ❤ this song
Luke you and Adam are amazing. Keep up the good work

Drink of brown licqure , two friends around , My wife and my friend , mybest dog around !  I understand you can and i can't sing . . .  But id still be doing this . . .
Great tun e
cool voice cool song
He has awesome story telling it just makes me so connected to the point where I can feel feelings for this song “still be doing doing this if I weren’t doing this”
Here’s the lyrics ⬇️  Someone asked me once in an interview "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?"  l'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge Tryin' to make rent with a dead end job, just makin' due, with tips in a jar, my guitar and an old barstool  I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand, cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band, singin' them same damn songs like I am now, I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins, at the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town, I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this  I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day, who was burnin' CDs just to give away Payin' his dues if I wasn't doin' this   Five deep in a van, head full of steam Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true, livin' this life just like I was born to do I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand, cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band, singin' them same damn songs like I am now, I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins, at the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town, I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this  It ain't about the fame It ain't about the fortune It ain't about the name It ain't about the glory I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about  Having a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand, cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band, singin' them same damn songs like I am now, I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins, at the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town, I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this  Someone asked me once in an interview "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this"
Jesus Christ is Lord and King and Our Savior
Hi Luke  I LOVE your music and I was wondering do you have any tips on ware I should buy my first guitar
Here after the Daytona 500
It's so awesome to see a man. Be so humble about his fame. Huge congrats to your awesome success. You are a good person. You can tell by the way your passion. When you sing. God bless you
Man, I jam this song every time I hear it. Hit after hit! 🎸
I honestly love this song.
Best drinking buddy eva
Gotta love the way Luke puts it all on the line out there on the stage he's not holding nothing back.
You are so real! I just wished I could meet you in person 😔 the country music 🎶that you sing is awesome, love you partner
My favorite country singer of all time man I sure would love to produce a record with you guys
I’ll watch this video and listen to this song endlessly. It’s amazing, but you forget who actually made you. I watch that video Ryan Upchurch made about you endlessly as well. Be appreciative. He still makes more money on his songs Unsigned
This song sends tears out of eyes any time I hear it. I miss my old job as a radio presenter  any day but I'm far from it now and juggling through 3 jobs on a foreign land. It gets overwhelming but we keep at it. Love this jam Luke. It's speaks to my soul
Thank God your doin this.
absolutely LEGENDARY
LUKEEE OMG I LOVE YOUR MUSIC IM 13 but I feel you music I understand it completely I love them so much I wish I could go to one of your concerts you gotta come to Kansas City sometime I wanna see your concert even tho if you do I might not be able to go but it would be so amazing to know you were here so hope to hear from you maybe it’s a big hope but we’ll see
Would  love you be there one day like him
Georgia breeds ‘em right!!!!
LUKE 😍😍😍😍

uno de mis grandes favoritos, me encanta, transmite algo tan especial, es exepcional.
He never misses
Im a city boy, but damn... What a song. Massive fan of Luke Combs!
One question… please if you could answer this one for me… has Luke Combs EVER made music, or even sang anyone else’s song that just flat out sucked??? I honestly can’t find one reason to dislike this guy. Every song, Every time. Keep up the damn great work Luke… and we fans will always be here!
Luke is blessed and the bond with his friend Adam shows it all...
Love u Luke 💓💗
What a fake Where's your biscuits and porn guitar
Have you actually ever wondered what your life would be like if you weren’t a country singer
Luke Combs could fart and make it top the charts.
Love you music  thks for being  you
Rytikal eye want that guys song
What...a great song..so heartfelt. Another hit!!!!..Way to go
Thx for this Luke you're the goat man
This is one of those songs you just can’t play loud enough
As well as our music
Money ain't ruined this guy HE IS GENUINE! 100% WE NEED MORE POSITIVITY N LIFE
This guy is young wit a CLASSIC voice and lungs like crazy
Oh man I'm a military vet love my country music for songs like this
This is how it should go, no contests, just doing what you do best
Thank you Luke so much I can't wait to see you live man
Much love to you!
Fantastic to see this man grow 👏 🙌 🙏 💙 let's hope we hear many more 😍
I am probably one of your biggest fans and I am speechless and all I have to say is wow.I am astonished with how truthful you are and where during that song just wow bravo.
Pinchi rolo ta
It’s an honor to be listening to this song while sitting in my semi at the freedom convoy . 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦 we love ya Luke, keep being the best!
Holy shyt 🤯
He'd be selling his soul some other way, like calling some other guy that made him famous a racist
I was born in Boone!
This is why people love Luke combs.  They can relate, to this if they became famous
Your music makes me cry that’s says a lot I consider myself a tough guy
So lucky to have heard this played at Opry!!
Amazing voice and talent
U N
Oh GOD. This song was already so badass but as soon as the guy looks up from doing the dishes my eyes got watery. This video makes it SO MUCH MORE powerful!!
I'd still be doing what I'm doing either way, this song is what will be played once I'm layed to rest, I've raised hell my whole life, this song is me,
Beautiful 😍
#lukecombs you are the reason I carry on everyday. You don't understand the things your songs do for me since I lost my father. I'd give anything to see you live. We was raised in the same are of the country. Love you bro thanks for your music.
Wow 😮 again smiling from ear to ear. Doing this, BAD A.. SONG..🙏
Luke I don't even know if you know what you mean to my now 11 year old son, you pull him out of every dark place he falls into with hope, you make him cry, you make me cry and all out of pure LOVE man! I am so beyond grateful for you, your talent and the fact that you bless us both daily with EVERY DAMN SONG that you throw into our hearts! I could only PRAY for the day you see this message, and I can afford to take him to your concert or hell even meet ya. But for my son's beautiful sake and mine, we won't give up and will continue to support you in every aspect! Keep lifting us up Luke! We need your kind of inspiration. Love you beyond words and THANK YOU!
Man when I listen to ur songs it reminded me of my dad he left me when I was 11 and I’m 12 so I know what it feels like you are my imperation Luke combs and I love u man
Love u
What most people forget, is there is no Luke Combs without Adam Church. We all need friends like this. Respect is equally earned. To have certain friends like that is an honor as much as a privilege. Because no matter where you are, we're all still doin' this. Luke is the kinda guy to not forget.
Beautiful song
I wish his buddy Adam could also make it like Luke has. Such a sweet friendship.
Love it lol lot of love Marilee ❤️
Hey Luke you turn in to a pretty boy singing a pretty song you are a fake country boy
Absolutely beautiful 😢😢
One of the best things to happen to me in the last 4 years was finding out who you was Luke and I can say every song you put out is what ALOT of us people need. You are a gift from GOD in the last 4 years of learning who you are has made me realize life throws us curve balls but it also points us to where we need to be in are mind and in are heart. I hope you read this and understand how much I appreciate you and your music thank you.
Man this shit hits hard! Love ya luke
Luke Combs, you are the absolute best.
One of my favorite songs and you have alot of them Luke!!! One of only a few who continues to give us REAL country music!! Will be there too see you in Atlanta!!!
I cannot wait until 3/19/2022. Its going to EPIC. ❤💕❤💖🎯🎯🎯🎯❤💖💕
Awsom
What a great man he is giving credit to Adam church.   True friends for life I bet.  God Bless
awesome song - thank you    #regards from a german fan
As a radio guy of over 27 years, man do I truly get this.  This song hits me right in the feels.  Love your music your true to the music.  I'd kill for a 15 minute interview with you on our small tribal radio station.
Wow this song is beautiful
Oh man I'm a veteran from 2005 to 2009 this song just gets me its love and brotherhood
Bring it son !
I LOVE  THIS GUY LUKE  Combs
Thank you!!! Your are mine expiration♥️🙏♥️with hard work every Dream is possible
Love it and Love Luke Combs! Such awesome music!
Love the Josh Hamilton jersey!!!!!!!
Ojalá y un día pueda conocerte🥰❤️🥰❤️❤️🥰
Brought me to tears
I could easily see me listening to Luke Combs at a bar.  country radio not so much. He obviously got super lucky.
The only thing I didn’t like is how you say you will never change but you turned your back on Ryan upchurch. But besides that great song
That little girl is going to grow up and think “That’s my dad” 💚
My whole life I wondered why they would ask him that during a job interview.  Just realized at 4 AM it’s not a job interview. 🤦🏼
I guess it makes me think, if your answer is doing something else right away then your probably not doing the right thing... You can always make money but you can't always be happy and have a passion for what you do if it's not right 💯
One of the best🔥💯🎸
Dude. Unbelievable. You got something special. Bonified
Even tho I listen to his music everyday its like its my first time hearing him on vines.. Still gives me chills. I have seen him 3 times. 2 at grand ole opry 1 in memphis next week see him again at the Grand Ole opry... 3rd row seats.. Ima cry AGAIN lol prob a ugly cry this well be my closest to him yet... Working them over time hours.. Dont buy me much but I buy myself Luke tickets❤️ #LCalldaybaby
Luke Combs wow what a Great Song lyrics that make you move like a flow in a river Hope and Pray That God May continue to to help you through your journey through music and that he helps you each and every step of the way

👏
i really want go to go to the conecert luke combs featuring cody jonhson. i really love all of there songs there amazing this is my dream to go see them
Was probley worst concert I’ve ever been to
Can’t stand Luke combs but I like the song  would of been done better by Jason Aldean
I'm your best friend love your music 🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇸❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🧡🧡🧡💛💚💚💜💜🤎🖤🖤🤎💜💙
This song is awesome. I also like how he has his name engraved into his fret board. Pretty cool!
I love this song not only because it's a great song by an artist who's work I really enjoy, but because when I first heard it, I heard my story in the music.  Not that I'm a musician, or any sort of artist.  Heck, I've never even picked up a guitar.  But like a lot of people out here working day to day in difficult jobs and doing those jobs every day not for fame, or glory, or anything special other than it's what they always did.  I've been doing the same job for 24 years now.  Sometimes, I count the days until I can make my career change (soon).  Sometimes I'll be driving home, and this song will come on, or I'll play it.  I ask myself "What would I be doing if I wasn't doing this" and the instant answer is what I'm doing now.  It fills me full of encouragement and pride for just being that guy who did his job, stuck with it even when it was terrible, and eventually figured out he found exactly what he was supposed to be doing.  On the surface, this song is about Luke, but for a lot of folks, this song is about them.  This song is about their life, their experiences, and how they feel.  And if that's not what good country music is supposed to be, then I don't know what is.
For me ,Luke is a little hit and miss sometimes......THIS one is 🔥.
LUKE COMBS is the most HUMBLE and TALENTED soul on the planet! Everything his songs has so much meaning and shows the kind of person he is. I hope one day my wife and I get to see him in concert! We've seen many good shows but I think his will be the icing on the cake! Many props to you LUKE for being the BEST THING to hit COUNTRY MUSIC!  #LIFEONSTAGE
I could literally listen to this song on repeat and never get tired of it!!
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE FIRST PICTURES OF YOUR SON GRABBING AHOLD OF YOUR BEARD.  I WILL LOVE TO SEE THOSE
I LOVE THIS SONG AND BY THE WAY CONGRATS ON YOUR SON THIS SPRING.  TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF, NICOLE AND YOU SON AND JOJO  I LOVE YOU MY MAN
Share, Share, Share ❤
I love country music because it's honest and talk's about real working class American's just being themselves.
I follow a show called Meat Eater, and I saw Luke Combs for the first time, and I'll tell you, this guy sings a lot
Luke Combs you were born to do this. You can tell you put your sole into your music but don’t forget where you come from. That’s what makes your music so amazing and relatable. 💖
dude is gonna go down with legend status...
😀🤣😃😄😅🏆🏅🥇🥈🥉🎖🎻🎙🎤
I love him.  He's one of my favorite Singers. Keep the Songs coming.  Love ya
so was the baby bottle a sign to the news we just got👀
This is one of the best singers I have ever heard love to see small town humble people make it big.
When you forget who got you there,,,,,,,,, listen to this song..
Couldn't be a greater honor than someone to say maybe the best human being I've ever met!!! God bless Adam Church 🙏
I worked security at one of your shows. Fucking proud of you brother.
Mannn this is one hell of song!!
This is a great song!! Awesome tribute!! Look me up on YouTube. I just got two covers but I will have some more.
Love all the songs and love you luke
hi luke
hi
If anyone, even for a second, thinks this cave troll of a man would be capable of even dating let alone marrying his wife if he didn't have money or fame, your out of your mind. And if anyone thinks she is not a gold digger who married for fame or money, you are also out of your mind. Proof: look at every horrifyingly fat and ugly linemen in the NFL with a trophy wife, every rich or famous person in Hollywood, or every multimillionaire/billionaire.
Thanks
This song is hella underrated! Ada boy Luke!!
That's how you write a song right there!
Thanks
🥰
Country these days is ass and this guy's no exception. Charley crockett like the only country artist worth listening to these days
This is the sweetest video ever for so many reasons
"he helped me and he didnt have too" ...greatest thing ever ... i throw my heart to that omg
I want to hear him sing Kenny Rogers "Through The Years" in his own rendition
Love Luke’s songs. Definitely the next BIG THING👌🏼
Someone asked me once in an interview "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?"

Good for you Luke...and good for us....Powerful song 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
Super LSS
Not only do you have one of the most incredible voices .. but your soul, energy and humility is nothing short of inspiring. Keep doing you .. and get your butt to Australia! We want to see you down under 🤗

The passion in your songs is just too much
Excellent response to that question.
Something about his voice can’t be matched
subscribed ! wishing you continuity of your success and creativity mate. cheers
Luke restores my faith in humanity
Luke combs, buddy. You are a damn artist brother. My kids especially my 3 year old walks around singing long neck ice cold beer never broke her heart. Haha dude I wish you could hear it buddy. I enjoy every song you sing my friend. Just to drink a beer with you would be awesome, I’d buy you a round.
I love the part ''It ain't about the fortune'' Bruh who sticks up a damn Ford logo on his guitar just for fun
WOW this video blew me away
One of my favourite Country artists….your a true legend Luke! Would love to see you perform live one day!
It was actually a pleasure to watch these two fine young men on those barstools in Boone NC playing for basically nothing to get where they are now. Adam and my Son went to High School together and the three of them where at App the same time. They are both great kids and I can tell you that their parents were and are very instrumental in their lives.
This song is so god damn good . It’s the style like is built to produce! What would I be doing if I wasn’t doing this? A great question..
what a talent
If you weren’t doing this you can bet you would be impacting lives in some other great way. I have said it to my nephew who put me on to you very early. Keep it up, and Garth himself with pass your the mantle.
Just  a good ol boy having fun,,, great song man
the best choice is Luke Combs
Incapable of writing a bad song
IT MUST BE NICE TO HAVE YOUR PARENTS BELIEVE IN YOU.  YOU ARE THE BEST MY FRIEND.  KEEP IT COMING.  LOVE YOU
Man you are the best thing what could happen to country music! You never disappoints. Thank you for your music! Love from The Czech Republic!
Love this bloke full stop 👌🏻
Strip away his songwriting abilities and just go off of his singing and storytelling ability, and you still get a legend.  The vocal control, the build, perfect timing, and grit are unlike anyone else on the radio. He lacks vibrato like other singers, but he uses just as much control and the vocals are flawless.  He can out sing half the people on the radio and sing stories so vivid that I feel as if I am right there in the moment no matter where I am.  Every new song is a new favorite, but this is the one that almost makes me cry as I am so moved.  It's inspiring and reminds me of what I used to dream about.  What an amazing song. No one else could sing it like him.
I love his new song ""Doin This
As country music is transitioning to...well... Not the same thing we've been used to, it's dudes like this that reel me back in.  Luke seems like the guy you can envision sitting next to in a bar having a beer and a normal conversation, fame or not.  Thanks for being a great musician and probably even a better person.
My new favorite Luke Combs song
This shit gave me chills, I love this song
You always forget to mention the guy who got u ur start with "outlaw" the great Ryan Upchurch dude ur a sell out I don't see who gave u a deal
I have only just heard this song and I absolutely love it.
Love him❤
Que increíble canción, una de mis favoritas
1/8/22 feelin like fire on a hardwood  floor stage...FLG 19:19
Love what you do and you'll never work a day in your life .
Luke is one of the best. His songs are REAL. Best of the best in a very long time. Bad ass🤘🏼
Congrats this song helped me get through some of darkest moments in my life this past year.. Navy Chief Ret. Wva. God bless.
Great Achily Someone Has Real Country
Man need chips. 🌎
This guy is a genius. Appreciate greatness.
My daily anthem to get my day started at 5am. I can't get enough of this song and my boy Luke, KEEP PUSHING TO THE TOP!
Got to see him b4 the big time, love you luke. Can't wait to see you again.
I have Goosebumps

I've only found out about Luke over this Christmas period but I already ordered his album and I've fell in love with his music immediately.
great song, congrats..!!!
DIRETO DE SALVADOR - BAHIA - BRAZIL.  YOU ARE THE BEST LUKE!
Happy New Year 🎆 y’all ❤️ sending love, blessings, peace, healing energy to you and yours💕❣️
Helluva tune. You never disappoint ❤️
Shivers run through my spine listening to Luke. So talented,  and cares what music he puts out there!💕
Because my name is Zachary Palmer I'm a big fan of you I watched a lot of the songs before they're so good
If you weren't doing this we would have missed a great singer in our lives!! .. your songs keeps me going .. i always listen to you driving to and from work .. thank you for sharing your talent with us xx
Luke consistently proves that he is a GIANT!
Ryan Upchurch disagrees Luke! Very ironic messaging in this song, truly!

POT FARMER SONG $$ I got out my pipe and stuffed it with pot You better believe, it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter and thumbed up a flame Then sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol; and smoked cigarettes Though, they did nothing, but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis and couldn't walk around When I rolled her a joint, she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack But, after I smoked some, to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high So I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around Then, got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where the wild birds nest And found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground and sowed all my seeds Then said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail The mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in my camouflage suit And used a corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn't be found. Then came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, and stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone But I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!

If you wasnt doing this your name would still be on can i get an outlaw beside upchurch but that ship sailed cant take that back my guy i love alot of your songs but this is by far my least favorite!!
Man I know Luke will never see this but when I lost my dad in 2020 he was the only person that saved me when I was by myself. Your a old soul brother. Please keep it up
1980

This is the best coraey song ever
I just don't know why i'm love Luke's song and his country accent❤❤
Beautiful Beautiful song, you have an Alan Jackson heart ❤️ I see a big future for you.
Luke seems like such a wholesome man, I’m a rap/r&b man first but don’t get it twisted I slap a Luke combs play list a few times a week. I’ve been to a few of his concerts and he’s legit live.
I remember when I use to listen to music that didn't hold any value now all I do is listen to Luke❤
Love ya Luke God bless
🎖️👁️🏅😇👣✨🔏🌍🩱🌴🙏🙌🎚️🌠🌌💞🤗💫
Go Luke combs!!
Love this guy…Merry Christmas, celebrate it healthy, happy and in the best mood possible. All the best from Bosnia and Herzegovina. 🇧🇦❤️ 🇺🇸
luke you know your good if a youtube spam bot likes your song
The bestttttt ❤️
I love his music i went to his concert in october
How does Kane Brown and Khalid manage to stay in music business?  They both can't sing and they should get fired.  There's no future for singers like Kane Brown and Khalid.  They both are a disgrace to real country singers like Walker Hayes, Chris Stapleton, Blake Shelton, Luke Combs, Keith Urban, Dan&Shay, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.  Kane Brown sounds like a street singer begging for spare change in the street.  That's why he can't carry anything on his own, he has to be part of a collaboration...I'm actually surprised anyone wants to work with him at all!  If truth be told, I'd bet Chris Young and Blackbear both were forced to do so.  No Kane Brown at CMA awards please.  He's gonna ruin the show again just like 3 years ago. He's nothing but a loser who is terribly overrated.
One of the best songs I have ever heard. Voice of an angel!!
I love this song AWESOME 👌
All of my love Luke. All of it. Thanks.
Same dude...same
You were destined to do exactly what you're doing not everyone was born with the talent u have.
I love how much credit Luke gives Adam in his, in their success, together.
Here because of NICKMERCS 🔥
MFAM
I have to say it, if you weren't Doin' This, you would be Doin' This with Ryan Upchurch!
oh its so sweet for luke to do this for his friend. i watched some of their vines and this is most likely how luke got discovered and got famous. thanks to adam we can see someone like luke flourish
Micah
Best song ever!!!! Favorite!!!

I am so excited to go to another one of your concerts in July 30!!
My man did it again! THANK YOU SO MUCH LUKE COMBS HAPPY HOLIDAYS God Bless you and your family
There’s so much hate in our poor country. If only the media told the truth. I fucking love every single one of you.. and that’s coming from the heartland.. keep doin this bud
legend
You can see how truly humbled he is for the opportunities he's been so blessed with and the people whose been with him every step of the way! Part of What makes everyone love him is he doesnt act famous he acts like your buddy at the bar with a beer in his hand just singing to you, an he NEVER forgets to mention how grateful he is for every person in his life, where he's come from and that he is so very blessed to be doing what he has always dreamed of doing. I love luke combs as an artist for sure the songs an his voice but i also love that he's just such a humble man. I wish you all the luck an happiness luke you VERY much deserve it!♡
dang man ur  good and u rock bro
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥fist time and I love it
I thought this guy was Luke Bryan.
You motivate me to keep chasing the dream !
Love him and his music!!!!!   Flawless!!!
I love your music  🖤
This gave me chills, I LOVE IT
Luke Combs is my biggest inspiration. I picked up a guitar just three years ago and “Hurricane” was my first song. Now I’m a full time musician playing all over the state of Ohio. Thank you Luke Combs for everything!!
Luke keep it up, at this rate you will eventually be the goat!!
Sehr 👍!😉
Your music inspires your my idol!
God bless this man. Protect Luke at all cost.
You haven't dissapointed me on not 1 song yet and I doubt you ever will❤❤
i love this song so much.  i love the video.  you got the biggest hit right here.  if you ever get to wamego i want to meet you.  read my other messages to you
Never forget those who helped you get to where you are!
the first time i heard of luke combs, I was like, who is this guy? how is he famous??? then i heard him sing...dayum...and im not even into country music...but from that moment I understood how this guys sells so many tickets...

I love his music. He's a great storyteller and this song gave me chills.
YOU EVER GET TO WAMEGO, KANSAS STOP BY.  GO TO PIZZA HUT AND ASK FOR DAWNA.  IF I'M NOT THERE HAVE THEM CALL ME.  I REALLY WANT TO MEET YOU
THIS IS A GREAT SONG AND A GREAT VIDEO.  YOU ARE ONE OF THE BEST.  I LOVE YOU LUKE.  I WISH I COULD TALK TO YOU BUT I NO LONGER TALK TO ANYONE BECAUSE OF THE FAKES.  YOU BE CAREFUL OUT THERE.  I TALKED TO ONE AND HE KNEW A LOT ABOUT YOU.  HE CONVINCED ME TO TRUST HIM.  I GOT KICKED OUT OF MY BANK BECAUSE OF HIM.  ONE DAY I WQANT TO MEET YOU
Sounds like Luke misses playing in front of 50 people in some random bar
Wow Just Wow Luke!! you Hit that out of the Park! One day I will see you Live!
Luke, as we say in my language: "Jy is 'n yster"! Great stuff one again.
Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only one she can depend on but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic lousy performances at CMA awards.  He's not gonna last very long in music business neither.  "Kane Brown can't sing" is an "understatement".  Kane and Khalid they both sound like shit.  "TS" is one of Lauren Alaina's mother's multiple fake accounts.   I'm not interested in chatting with Lauren Alaina or her mother cuz I'm not your boyfriend.  Please don't click the reply button

fame and fourture are not worth it if you hate what you do and the fact he makes it clear in this song its not but fame or forture its about the music thats why he is a cma entertainer now and deserves way more awards because he is a artist a true artist
I’d like to see the clip where Luke introduced Adam at the actual concert. I haven’t been able to find it on here. I was hoping someone uploaded it.

Love this song !. Keep going Luke. Never stop making us happy :). Please.
One of the best vocal in country music! 👏👏👏
HELL YA LOVE THIS SONG
Ok so Im from a poor third world country called SRI LANKA, im sure most people including Luke Combs would not know where that is. just saying he got fans all over at this point. ive been listening to his songs from the time i heard "SIX Feet APART"/ wow his song lyrics just hit my bones all the time with the melody. been a part time musician all my life, as becoming a full time musician would not pay my bills in Sri Lanka. I moved to Canada  8 Years ago but still a part time musician. sang in front of small crowds hundreds of times, sang in a handful of concerts with "Bright Lights like Lightning through my veins" . I know its true what he says "doin this if i weren't doin this" . very inspirational as tears came to eyes with this one especially when it directly hits you. love ya man...please keep doing what you do. really love to meet him someday.. , like thats going to happen lol
Amazing Song! Luke Never Disappoints Me!
Most of your songs make me cry anywt but    I've always wanted to do what you do I love to sing anyway you taught me how to sing from My,,💔 like nobody's there for an audience of one thank you so much bro love you Mark from TurlockCali.
🤍🦋🙏🏻
Amazing💕
Luke is amazing and super humble. What a way to show gratitude.
This song makes me shed tears, thanks Luke for another spot on.
This is hard to do.... We may it top 40 Whittier N.C. little below boone. We have a family song growing up where we raised kids very cool. Don't want no money we are happy. Some body should listen to it..   Thats it....

It looks like are country rock blues fellow know how to sing and captive    I was mad at hen you interrupted him.  That was a pissy thing to do , (I was thinking to myself.

I wish him and Aaron Lewis would share the stage!!!
Someone asked me once in an interview "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?"  I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge Tryin' to make rent with a dead end job, just makin' due With tips in a jar, my guitar and an old barstool  I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin' them same damn songs like I am now I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this  I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day Who was burnin' CDs just to give away Payin' his dues if I wasn't doin' this  Five deep in a van, head full of steam Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true Livin' this life just like I was born to do  I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin' them same damn songs like I am now I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this  It ain't about the fame It ain't about the fortune It ain't about the name It ain't about the glory I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about  Having a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin' them same damn songs like I am now I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this  Someone asked me once in an interview "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this"
I listen to this song way too much😂❤️❤️
😅😅😅😅  Kane Brown is irrelevant in country music.  He's lucky he's still in music business.  How? The two worthless garbage singers: Kane Brown and Khalid
Literally my favourite song

Kane Brown is the one only one she can depend on but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic lousy performances at CMA awards.  He's not gonna last very long in music business neither.  "Kane Brown can't sing" is an "understatement".  Kane and Khalid they both sound like shit.  I'm not interested in chatting with Lauren Alaina or her mother.     Please don't click the reply button...
Sitting here listening to this song it made me start crying. Thinking of the days gone by. The things that everyone has helped me with in my life from losing my Mom to the Bad wreck I was in that in the Miracle of God me and the Guy who was with me survived. To my  marriage just ended in a flash. I want to say THANK YOU  TO LUKE COMBS for this and THANK YOU ADAM CHURCH for helping him!!!
Somerset church st omer by st Paul indiana
Im not coming tho
I LOVE your music and just the vibe of your music. The story they tell!! ugh truly an amazing talented artist!!
luke has me in tears love it!
this song came out on my birthday love you luke combs!
How about talking about our freedom from the globalist? Merle would have and did.
You're exactly what country music needed, bro.
My All-Time Favorite Artist. Much love from Kenya❤
I am literally obsessed with any song Luke Combs comes out with, because there's so much soul, and he has the biggest heart!
this song is the reason why I am doin' this
I smile every time I listen to any of Luke’s music. He’s my ultimate favorite. He had me at hurricane years back and I’ve loved every single song since 💕💕💕😊
nices songs
😃😃😃😃 😃😃 How does Kane Brown and Khalid manage to stay in music business?  They both can't sing and they should get fired.    There's no future for singers like Kane Brown and Khalid.  They both are a disgrace to real country singers like Walker Hayes, Chris Stapleton, Blake Shelton, Luke Combs, Keith Urban, Dan&Shay, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.  Kane Brown sounds like a street singer begging for spare change in the street.  That's why he can't carry anything on his own, he has to be part of a collaboration...I'm actually surprised anyone wants to work with him at all!  If truth be told, I'd bet Chris Young and Blackbear both were forced to do so.  No Kane Brown at CMA awards please.  He's gonna ruin the show again just like 3 years ago. He's nothing but a loser who is terribly overrated..
This is one of his greatest songs yet
Awesome 👌
Great Voive ... is a new coming Star ... i love it

UpChurch is the man
Beautiful vedio got the  Chills God bless you
super  bise
Does Luke ever direct message people ?  I commented on a video once and he responded but I assumed it was fake because well you know the internet.
what a voice.
LOVELOVELOVE!
Beautiful song, awesome voice, but who washes a dish with the yellow part of the sponge?!
so good
That's how too write a beautiful song about a real life of friends and memories of a lifetime
A 💜
Wish you'd come to the State College, PA area for a show. Love ya bro. 💪🏻

This man is keeping country alive, flat amazing, how I'd love to have a hog over mesquite coals and have a beer with this legend, thank you Luke Combs.
God bless
Great vid!
Im in the process of learning this song... this is a great song... i play guitar... awesome song Luke
Another awesome song Luke!
Before I never was a big fan of country music until yesterday when I heard him play at Thanksgiving in the NFL game with the Cowboys versus the Raiders Luke you just made me a fan of your music in other words country music
Best freakin country singer my goddd
This will be Luke's next #1
Why does this song bring me to tears? Why?? It's so beautiful.

Love this man’s music. True country music
Just another pretty boy singing pretty songs!
Vibes/goals
Luke Combsy His Hars. Fatback On Rye twang sangun cuntry wjiney songs that sound as crappy as fish head and peanut butter samiches on white bread.  Bet them hoofs in socks stuffed in balloon shoes. Crybaby sing something about when you have to eat the table cloth with your 25th plate and blow fat cheesers all day because bloated porcine let go all the time or they burst into flame like the Hindenburg

Daddy, sorry, daddy, sorry, daddy, sorry. 👁👃🏻👅👃🏻👁🤏
Miley cyrpuk ain't all dat

Goosebumps....
I’m so hooked on this song!
I'm here because I became a Luke Combs fan tonight.......  Wow
In short words, you'd change a thing about what you do right now. Youre a legend. A great honor to be able to listen to your songs Luke.

This original piece is giving me chills ❤️❤️ Amazing ❤️‍🔥
You are such an inspiration for so many different reasons, knowing where you came from to even where you are now and you are the same and so grounded. Xx
You would think it would of been Ryan Upchurch but who am i
Watching that video almost Made me cry when he started talking about Adam church it reminds me of me and my friends about 8 years back now!!
This song and video made me cry as someone who was born and raised in Boone, NC seeing Luke and Adam two people I just knew from around to seeing them both on stage
CHRISTMAS = 2021 * Christmas is coming and I'm all alone With no one to snuggle at night. My wineglass is empty to help dull desire To kiss you by soft candlelight.  A rare pearl of value, you don't leave alone Or someone will steal them from you. After they've gone and flown far away It's hard to know just what to do.  I'm watching my neighbors hang lights on their tree With tinsel and striped candy cane. I took you for granted and didn't hug enough And now I must suffer my pain.  Lord, I'm so lonely; I wish I could die Then be born to relive again. I realize the value of someone to love And the danger of my selfish sin.  There's a ring on my phone and a knock at the door Which do I dare go for? If neither is you, I'll break down and cry And again pound my fist on the floor.  I run down the hall and the doorknob turns As the swirling snow rides on the wind. There, in my doorway, it's the face I love Such a beautiful present to send.  Now, I am happy and dancing around With a permanent smile on my face. As children are singing their Christmas love songs And the world is a wonderful place.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

My husband can sing so good and sound like you like your a big inspiration to him thank you
The steel guitar always gives me goosebumps. It’s a really beautiful sound and in my opinion a complete element of country music. 😍 Great song!👏👏
this is without a doubt the perfect country song.
I'm too late to find his existence...
Damn Good Song!!!!
This video, song, and how you paid tribute to and shined a much deserved light on a talented friend that helped you get here had me tearing up. I’m still a whole gangsta and a half though!💪🏾😂🤷🏾‍♀️ Naw, but I’m not a very emotional person, but seeing the smile on Adam’s face throughout this video and you and him having so many great times together with it culminating with Adam on stage in front of thousands with you, got to me. It’s one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen.  God bless you both.💙🙏🏾
doing NC family proud!
Same
Good video
I love your voice goddamit
Man....Adam Church  LOL...
This guy is so much better then Garth Brooks

Am i the only person from Indonesia here?? I've been listening to his song since 2018 🤠🤠.
Love him ❤
So great to see this song about a couple of buddies as told by Luke Combs...much love to Adam Church!
The way his pronounce every word makes me want to stay in the North wooohoooo
Obviously you haven't been to very many concert!  Kane Brown's concert really sucked, absolutely the worst I've ever seen in a decade.  He will not be coming back considering he was booed off stage.  Not to mention, he isn't even a country singer who made crappy albums.  I wouldn't spend a dime on his music album! I don't listen to trash songs.    I'm just stating a fact based on my experience!
amazing as always🤠🤠

I said to my hubby during the height of covid. I sure hope some awesome music comes out of all this isolation.  Luke you haven't disappointed.  I love this song.
Good job, Luke.
Found out about Luke on episode of meat eater , great person down to earth guy.

Luke Combs Is By Far My Favorite Country Artist
That one true homie that believes in you and now living both of their dreams came true.
Once AGAIN another amazing song!!! Dude.... you give it your heart and that is what makes you so awesome!! Never change please!!
For the wages of sin is death but the gift of GOD is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
wow awesome song
사랑해요
Right now when i'm writing this, i am working on a night shift. Life has been so rough for me, that I can't even breath. Life, family, debt, pressure... Thank you for a motivation boost midnight Luke !
This was 13 days ago
wooow I love it
Nice done sir  :)
Your music never stops amazing me
why am i crying :")
I 💯 love this track
I used to like this guy until he totally bowed down to the social justice warriors. Rejecting the confederate flag because it might hurt some feeling today, Tomorrow he will reject the American flag because that flag also offends social justice warriors.  I would not want this guy with me in a fox hole
This is sooooo beautiful ❤😭
great song

What an amazing singer. It's possible he could beat Garth in the records. He's that good.
Absolutely the greatest song. Luke and all his band have been the greatest thing that ever happened to country music. Love that fame has never changed any of them. Keep playing boys 👍😁💕
You have a great voice. Good to hear some real, down to earth music. Thanks for the lift up. Appreciate it.
Great lyrics
with and exception of morgan wallen best song of 2021
Absolutely amazing voice
PLEASE.... STOP  I'm going to cry.
Straight up country soul music. 💪🏻 True legend
You can hear the deer meat in this guy's voice..
Remember when Luke combs was cool before he sold out? Nothing beats that video he had with Ryan Upchurch. Stopped listening to him after he sold out and apologized for that video. Luke combs is a bitch now.
he never misses. a legend. thank you for blessing us with your voice king ♥
🤡
Another song to love!
I will say this, it's nice to hear that artists love what they're doing. Luke, keep it up! We love ya
Love this song love his music he’s really a good singer
I never really listen to country music , but my best friend sent me this song . I choked up . Very beautiful

Great to see you add Adam Church in the video.  Great guy man.
lovely...
I think you're the best musician  around
Love your music
Even Walker sings way way better than Kane Brown.  At least Walker has the rhythms.  Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing.  They're not singers, they both sound like losers who are terribly overrated.  Even my dogs run away when they sing.  I wouldn't go to their concerts even if somebody pays me to do so.  Please eliminate those two untalented rappers from country asap
Congrats Luke love your music.
That man is a LEGEND 👍
i love this song thanks @ Luke combs
Just... wow 🔥
Keep it up
That's a good song I've ever listened to
Luke., Luke!.. I get goosebumps everytime I listen to this dudes songs! Never disappoints 🔥🔥

Love your music
Remember when he was good before he apologized for being in a SOUTHERN COUNTRY video with a SOUTHERN HISTORICAL FLAG in the background. He gave in to the liberal left and its hard to forgive him for that. Your in a music genre that requires a backbone and you handed it over when some people cried about how they were offended.
See you later doc sorry don't think I'll make my interview i
And thank God
They cut off the answer of what guy he's talking about in the interview watch it in the yt music app you'll see the film splice that's old school zzz tell they fit a good agent somewhere that actually gives a duck that's something I can't even put into words whoever and wherever you are thank you could
Guess I didn't need paid tho sorry I am a disappointment
Sorry buddy know you wanted more from me Sam needed me
What if Brad was still alive and you could hear him play his guitar right now
Where's corey
Please have*mom* bring me a blanket or coat after your interview I'm freezing bro and homeless cuz I won't sell out love you bro she said she was on her way to Kentucky and wouldn't turn around
Yes I'm speaking to you"Luke combs" also his name is not Adam church it's John Cummins he's a damn good radio man we met in a military prison
My true name is Jesus Christ also known as Lucifer morningstar I walk these streets homeless with nothing but the Hope I have in me with the entire weight of the world on my shoulders and everything against me most days thanks for your honesty Ronnie I love you little bro message Michael marshall your uncle
so much soul and power in his voice
Amazing like always!
Another future classic 🔥🔥💯

He’s such a good singer I found him off of YouTube and ever since then I was playing all his songs my favourite is probably even tho I’m leaving but this song is just fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hell. Yeah. You the. Man
Incredible song and awesome video depicting Luke's start.  I use to check ID's at the local bars in Boone when Luke started playing with Adam Church, who had been playing around Boone for quite some time already.  I remember so vividly Luke's very first shows joining Adam at Klondike and Boone's Town Tavern.  Pretty awesome to say I witnessed the very beginning of Luke's career and knowing Adam personally it's really special to see him get the recognition he deserves.
I fully expect that Luke will be 'doin this' another 25 years or more.  I consider him Hall of Fame material with legendary status.  Great writing, great singing, and great records!
❄️
literally smiled and sang along this entire music video soooooo gooooood ahhh
I am sitting on my back deck listening the you guys sing. I just got.icu, got some sopts.on my head. I have a wonderful wife who's my best friend and a love for cou try music that is in my blood. Yne time I hear you guys sing I get a kilttke.for peace. Don't know how long I have left but I promise I'll don't my best to love those keep on keeping on. Mr. Luke and Mr. Adam I greatly appreciate and you guys do for this qorld
Luke Your my happiness Lovin on u is outstanding bro you remind me of my dad that loved your songs, I love Hurricane and if your seeing this your somebody with the gift of compassion commitment responsibility resilience and respect keep up the great work your like no other. Sending love from Australia
Should rename this song to " if I'd never met upchurch"
God bless America and Americas who DONT see race ✊🏽🇺🇸
I first heard this on a YouTube ad and it was so good I had to check out the full thing
https://youtube.com/channel/UCp6dAN8MeSth3ugA1JD-saQ
He only disappoints when he doesn’t stand up for his values remember the flag he sold out his people to be woke he’s got talent but he sold out his people for a dream what a coward
Luke Combs you are my sons age, Matt looks like you!  He just married this year, your music resonates with him.  Your music touches my heart, your words make me cry!!  I binge listen to you. My son follows your local concerts as he can. Hands down you are the best without  a doubt…. You’ve been blessed FOR SURE!   Just know you having a standing invitation to a private barge ride at our place on Lake Tawakoni if you ever get a break while your in Texas. Bring whoever you want we will entertain you! We would love to meet you, I’m sure you’re an awsome guy!!  Thank you for sharing your amazing talent!!  I hope to be able to see you in concert and would love to meet you.  My son and his wife attended your concert at American Airlines in Dallas tonight (11-19). They had pretty good seats and sent me videos🤗😭🤗
I'm true to my music and this is the best
Very surprised not a bunch of dick beaters with thumbs down

Idk im getting Drake- Started from the bottom vibes from this.
Luke Combs is a bitch,  not an outlaw.  Ryan Upchurch is right.
Phenomenal song Luke!
It’s always an honor to be a part someone being honored.  Keep doin this!
Damn the Hamilton jersey
LGB!
I’m not really a country music fan, but I love his songs!

Your amazing
Thank you for putting country back into country
Wish I was seeing you in Glasgow next year at the c2c fest
Pure power right there... Vocally and musically...who's the talent on the guitar at 3.15 ? Wow...Prince would've been proud of that. Keep em coming big man.
One of the most incredible artists I've heard! Just amazing songs
Another snoozer. . . . This guy is the Jan Arden of country music 🤣

Absolutely brilliant 🙌 Love from Ireland 🇮🇪
Not a single bad song from this man. It’s a life goal to see you live luke !!
Luke doesn’t know how to have a bad song
The best
I love it ❤️❤️❤️
And remember, if it wasn’t for Ryan Upchurch you wouldn’t be where you are now.
I don’t think half the people realize how special and meaningful this song is not for how it sounds but to Luke.
This man literally can't make a bad song... It's almost illegal to do so.
Heck of a song.
Salute.
Amazing Luke is king of country music ❤️
Hell of a song and hell of a friend great song choice
As usual, Luke gets the best song award :)
Big love for this song  ❤️
It's been said already, but this guy cannot write a bad song.
So much love for your music Luke
We wanna see real professional country singers at CMA or ACM awards not some rappers who can't even carry a tune like Kane Brown or Khalid.
This is country, Luke definitely can sing.  Kane Brown's voice is pitchy and he can't even carry a tune.  Get rid of Kane Brown from country music billboard permanently!😅😅😅😅😘😅
And to add to my previous comment, my country hero is Alan Jackson. My 14 year old son is Luke. Fine by me
Determination, ambition, tenacity, stubbornness, not taking no for an answer. These are values that everyone should live by. I know I did.
If you were country, maybe driving a big truck? Just saying.
Remember when you were a coward and backed down to the woke mob? The rebels in country music are dead.  Here for the downvote.
Everything woke turns to shit. Including Luke combs. #LetsGoBrandon #FJB
Love it
Great song
Becoming a huge fan especially after the hunting episode on Meat Eater.
Again the best!!!!
Thank you so much Luke. My ole man has dementia. He really loves your songs. You make him remember, sometimes. Again thanks. Dolly and Joseph from Red Springs NC
Best voice ever added to playliat of yours mate
Beautiful Luke simply beautiful 👍
I'm relatively new to country music, the beginning of covid, and I absolutely love it, luke combs truly is amazing.....I can't wait for a tour in the UK no matter the cost I WILL be there
Leave it to Luke to write songs about small conversations and moments and turn it into something lasting forever. 😎
I never really listened to country. I listened to hank and his son, that's bout it. This past summer tho my brother had a ticket to see Luke. I took it not even sure I was going to go. I literally have never heard of this guy, but I live in the country and whatnot so I decided to go. I was immediately hooked and luke has turned me into a country music fan. Thanks luke for  being you and being a small town guy and holding to that.
This music video was and is amazing 💯 The real life story both in the song and shown was a masterpiece 🙏❤️
Can sing it word for word good enough to share the stage with you brother 🤛
Every time I hear one of Luke's songs I can't help but be blown away.
This is why we LOVE Luke Combs so much. He’s a real man with a great heart!!!! Not to mention an asskicking musician. Good on ya, Adam Church, for being a good person!!!🙏🏻🙏🏻👍👍👍👍👍👍
I love this so much 2nd fav
Beautiful ❤️😭
Luke is one of the most important artist We’ve had the chance to be introduced to , him being humble an grateful for the life he worked for an the ppl that helped him along the way is just an added bonus. Like combs single handley got me into county music.
Hey Luke, you should really consider taking some lessons from our boy, RYAN UPCHURCH 😂
Upchurch is the one who helped him put the respect where it’s due.
Luck. Comb's ❣️👍
Great 👍
Blessing.
Country music now belongs to Luke Combs. Forever and always.
Luke’s work is truly amazing, he is so inspiring.
His name is... Ryan Upchurch. and you apologized for it.   You're a very talented man there's no doubt.  Wish you would have stayed independent.
Great song and can't wait to see more of country Music like this. :)
I Lost my lover. She went with another Man 😭😭😭😭
Aohh🤍
Another absolute banger of a track.
He could sing the phone book and people would buy it. He better cash all the checks he can before people dump him for the next flavor of the month. Couple of good songs but just riding the wagon till the wheels fall off.
🔥🔥
Vocals +Fingers talent ✨🔥
Roll DAMN 'Neers !!!!!!!!
Whooo! Goosebumps bro!
this guy gives me chills.
How there is so many dislikes blows my mind and confused me. What is not to LOVE about this song and every other song belted out by Luke!
Australia please
I heard this guy was good, I guess I heard wrong, friggin garbage
Pretty sure I just picked myself out of that Boone shot. You never miss!
Already know it off by heart
Just WoW!
Someone asked me once in an interview "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?" I'd be drivin' my first car, a worn-out Dodge  Tryin' to make rent with a dead end job, just makin' due Tips in a jar, my guitar and an old barstool  I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand  Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin’ them same damn songs like I am now I’d be feelin’ on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin’ through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no name town I’d still be doin’ this if I wasn’t doin’ this  I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day Who was burnin' CDs just to give away Payin' his dues if I wasn't doin' this Five deep in a van, head full stream  hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true\ Livin; this life just like i was born to do  I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand  Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin’ them same damn songs like I am now I’d be feelin’ on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin’ through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no name town I’d still be doin’ this if I wasn’t doin’ this  It ain't about the fame  It ain't about the fame  it ain't about the fortune  It ain't about the glory I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about  I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand  Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin’ them same damn songs like I am now I’d be feelin’ on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin’ through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no name town I’d still be doin’ this if I wasn’t doin’ this  Someone asked me once in an interwiew  "What was growing up like, where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?
G.O.A.T. and that's saying a lot!
hoolllyyy Goat!!!
Many people don’t realize that there is many to thank when we make it to the top. Way to go Luke! Congrats on all your success ! Catch you on island time
Shouldnt he be apologizing for something?
Funny how Ryan upchurch is no where to be found in this video !
Thank God that you are doing this for everyone to listen and enjoy your music,  it's amazing and I haven't heard a bad song yet from you.
A dude named Adam Church??! LOL BOY IF THAT ISN'T MADE UP... THINKING HE TALKING ABOUT RYAN UPCHURCH AND ADAM CALHOUN...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 LUKE A SUCKA
631 people don't know good music.
Fake Friend
You dam right
Wow what a song and voice love his music he keeps impressing with the songs
Question should have been what would you do if Ryan didn’t help you out
I will never not like Luke Combs. His music is touching. His heart is big. Love him or hate him, he’s just a great artist.
It's awesome that Luke pays tribute too someone who helped him
Seeing him live this Thursday in Dallas
If I was wanting to become an artist, is there any tips or warnings
Born to do this. 👏
Legendary 👍🏼
I like it but it does need a fiddle or a steal guitar in it here and there
He makes my heart melt!❤️ hes sooo perfect!!!
WOKE
Living Legend !!  #Prayers for continued success for many more years Luke ~
Goosebumps from a brit 🇬🇧 Love Abit of Luke Combs
Sounds good but not true.... you found your group so your able to do this. I never found mine so my dreams are damn near gone... its now depressing to play guitar or sing an never hear the buzz or feel the bass or stomp a pedal or hear the silence turn into screams of applause. Some people aren't born to ride solo and do it all yourself
You are very talented you are the best country singer right now
Keep going ole son your name will be right there with cash and all the greats !!!
🥺🥺🥺🥺 to everyone who is struggling with their dreams out there ,  keep on pushing , put love to it and mind no ones words  ..   as long as it puts a smile on your face .. 🖤 its worth it ..
Been so in love with his voice.  He seems like the most humble and genuine artist ... wish he'd come to Orange Beach AL or Gulf Shores. ..... my 7 yr old daughter has his songs her Playlist...
Love u Luke! A real true humble amazing talent. Love all your music. U never disappoint. You don't make a bad song. So happy for u
Luke combs never heard of her sellout to mainstream Ryan up church is ur father
Greetings from Germany. Great Guy. Great Songs. Great Story. Love it.
Here bc my gf is making me listen to this
he deserves every award he's won. real life definition of taking the industry by storm
Powerful!  Thanks!
It's crazy how I believe it was the Voice who said he wasn't a fit for there show. And look a you know brother. Love your music congrats on your entertainer of the Year award. More to come.
I'd rather listen to Luke combs over Upchurch any day love this song 💗
Luke he's on his own level...!! can't get tired of listening to him 💞
Country music is the purest kind of music ever🌟
This man is amazing! This song is amazing!
WOW!! that gave me chills.
Hey look. Its another purdy boy singing purdy songs. I thought we didnt need that luke? #CREEKSQUAD
Wow this man deserves ever award going just brilliant 👏 one genuine person with a true country ❤ heart.
Wouldn’t be where you are if it wasn’t for ryan upchurch 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️👍🏼👍🏼
This song gives me goosebumps everything and I don't know why
Mate, this song gives me something I haven't had in a while. Hope. Bless you man
Beer glass half full
Literally have chills across my body. This man speaks to my soul
Stay humble luke. People believing in you is all you need in a world that turns a cold shoulder
why am I crying? this is too good..... absolute chills
the people that dislike this —> 🤡
Hope u come to Vancouver BC one day Luke I’m a huge fan 🤙
Still miss the old rebel flag Luke that Luke was better he didn’t say sorry for being himself idk about most “fans” but I’m all about tradition and not caring what other people think I mean either way you can blow up and get fans and money and popularity it don’t matter upchurch is living proof of that no labels no sorrys no being controlled by record labels or anything and I guess your kinda the opposite lmao kinda sucks but you’ll still always be a good artist in my book man
This guy can't make a bad song.
You’d still be proudly flying that Confederate flag in Boone though
https://youtu.be/dtdXC7AOBt8
Another banger!!
Church?? Liar nobody knew until Upchurch holy shit
O I like him but I gotta be honest don't like how he did Ryan, my first car was a 78 Dodge Aspen 😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVc6uVh89Ik&list=RDMM&index=4
I like that neon in the video that was my first car, and amazing music luke
Goat farm 💪🏿💪🏿
Английский язык я слабо понимаю, но эта песня зашла, ахрененная
my favorite artist since I first him... Once again he makes another song that gives me chills and bring tears to my eyes with his voice
This song make you ask yourself what you would be doing I wasn't doing this.
Luke just refuses to miss
Amazing!!!
Heres to every showed you played at Town Tavern and the Rock! We loved you then when you were doing that and we love you doing this ♥️♥️
I love Luke Combs!!! ❤️
Nothing like staying humble.
Your music tells a tale to every man women and child. I sang beautiful crazy to a girl at karaoke and ever since I've been with her. She's my daughters step mother and the biggest blessing other then my daughter remmie! You have brought so many bright lights into my life threw the energy you give off!!! And you keep doing it! Do it bub DO IT!
🤍🤍🤍
one thing i like about luke. Is he pours his heart into all of his songs.
IMPORTANT MESSAGE :D  the only way to Heaven 1) ADMIT THAT YOU’RE A SINNER: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23) No one is good enough to go to Heaven on his own merit. No matter how much good we do, we still come short.  2) REALIZE THE PENALTY FOR SIN: "For the wages of sin is death..." (Romans 3:23) The penalty for our sin is eternal death in a place called Hell. But there is good news, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to die on the cross for our sins, that whoever believes in Jesus should not perish but have everlasting life. ( see John 3:16) 3) BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD: 4) CALL UPON THE NAME OF JESUS: Trust in Jesus alone as your Savior. Jesus loves you and He's waiting for you with his arms wide open. Accept Jesus and repent (which means to confess and forsake your sins)
I wonder if this is how he responds to all of his interview questions
Can't help but feel this is kinda a layup to "this one's for you"
Just when you thought it couldn’t get any better. You the man Luke
When I listen the song I feel really happy but sad at the same time.
I still believe, that we touch people heart with a simple song, and change a lot of things for better,  Luk songs it’s a real proof
Luke Combs hits real hard like Five Finger Death Punch with those emotional songs.
i love luke combs
Love you big time, Luke!! Great job, as always!💜
Man i love this song makes you feel like you can relate to the man instead of him being just a country legend.
WOW
Shut up... 🥱
I knew this was something different when  it started. Glad I let it play. I love the story behind this.
Hands down his best song
Biggest sellout in country music. Utterly ashamed of this industry
Love your songs
Haven't visited YouTube for a while,and I opend YouTube and bumped into "doin' this" this song am adding to my playlist immediately
Awesome...
Im sure...another of views.. Yall played upon a person not knowing what was planned all along.. hope you enjoy my personal distress.. and many others.. now write a m..f.. song about $$ notifications  calenders.. players. Im margiehigh 8 was my Facebook Family.  Enjoy Thanksgiving B..t.  especially
Luke where have the rebels gone
Great song!
You wait around, trying to make sense of where Country Music is headed.  Pop Country, nonsense songs about nothing, sung by Hollywood pretty boys who couldn’t write a song if there life depended on it.  You wait around…  and then you hear a song like this.  Thank you Luke Combs.
SOFT WOKE COMBS!!
Luke, I'll definitely be seeing you in concert one day. Hopefully in better conditions after covid subsides. You deserve all of the recognition and awards you get. You don't make a bad song and you're an inspiration to many. Keep going brother , thank you
What has country music become?
https://gofund.me/9709d70c
Luke is the best country artist right now I swear man can’t make a bad song
Damn they can sing!
He can sing I mean sing
Who is Adam church?
Sometimes I feel like giving up writing and composing but then his songs always inspire to achieve what I’ve been dreaming 🙌🏻
Legal 👏🏼👏🏼☺️🇧🇷
If you read this while listening , doesn't matter where you are right now, I wish you a wonderful and a happy peaceful life where all your dreams become true. Cheers ❤ | MrCandyPup
DAMNN!

FIRE 🔥
Already a country legend! 😭
He just doesn’t miss. Ever
Luke Combs is a sale out to the big record labels, he denounced the Confederate flag and turned his back on his heritage
Too much screaming. I get bored with how every song is starting to sound the same! Yes, he is talented... bought a couple of his albums...but I only listen to a few hits!
He’s going to be remembered for decades. Mark my word.
Luke Combs is not only a remarkable writer and singer but he’s a very special person. He’s changed this world for the better and he’s changed all music for the better. These lyrics in this song and are absolutely priceless. There’s no better writer than him today.
something about his voice and the lyrics to his music
Lyrics        [Verse 1] Someone asked me once in an interview What was growing up like? Where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?

Where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?
Luke combs is literally my idol! I was going to see him in concert next year but it is all sold old😭I wonder why he is the most amazing singer that ever lived!❤❤
♥️
This is country music
That’s a story you can’t make up! The song and video was a great way to tell it
Will always be my favorite
Definitely my least favorite song
Speecless😭😭!!! Love him...another hit!!! 🤘🏻🔥♥️🙏🏻🙌🏼!!!!
The best stadium in college football never looked better than in this video. Go Luke! Go Apps!

Can't get enough of this tune !
Absolute love this song
Love his music

Fire
Not only an amazing artist, but an authentic and humble man!  Way to go!!!
His voice it just perfect 🤩 congrats 🍾 amazing 😻 song 🎧
every. single. song.... gifted.
I love your voice. 😍
Wow love it
Honestly, he's one of my favorites. To think couple years ago people were like who the hell is This Guy. Awesome voice and has some of the Best songs out there.
Everything this dude sings I feel is relatable to me, every single song has a great story behind it and that's why I like this dude art so much
😍😍Lauren Alaina is desperate for fame, but she is way way too~u^gly~to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone.  Kane Brown is the only person she can depend on who has a hopeless future.  Nobody wants to sing with her.  Nobody wants to be seen with her.  Poor human

Luke inspires me to follow my comedy career. Even if all that's there is only a "friday night crowd in the palm of my hand". So ready to do what I love. Thanks LUKE!
Luke never makes a bad song
Damn...another #1

Lol what a sell out
🇺🇸ENTERTAINER OF THE YEAR🇺🇸
The first time I saw Luke Combs live was at a small state fair in Roswell, NM. It was the first time I ever heard of Luke Combs. There was maybe a crowd of 100 to 200  people, he still sang as if there were thousands. So this song is probably one of the most genuine things I have ever heard. I've been a fan of his ever since that day.
I wanna be like Luke Combs!!
Luke combs to fuckin good
Great song, great voice, as always! <3
Love Luke Combs music. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Loving this! Content and loving what I'm doing whether on a stage in front of millions or in a remote area where nobody knows my name!
Awesome video. Love his music!1
Luke Man your great don't let a record label change you or any one for matter you do you and don't apologize for something some one don't like just because you like it don't change where you came form or who you are
Wheres that rebal flag
God damn that voice 😍
Can’t stand this guy he’s a cry baby sell out
What about up church , that’s how I found Luke combes
I love Luke ,but the outlaw up church back lash pissed me off , I ll see him in pei Canada 2022 but shouldn’t have apologized for nothing he did wrong to please the industry
Why is Luke so good at pulling at your heart strings and making you reflect
Nice one .. Luke, love from Liberia 🤩🤩
Luke has a voice like no other, and has such good meaningful lyrics that just hit right every time. Never disappoints. Honestly one of the best singers of our time.
This is why you will be around for year and years
Such a great talent, too bad he’s a sellout.
👎👎👎👎👎doooooodoooooooo
Very good song luke. We always have to thank the people who help us achieve our dreams.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well to the person who said this guy wasn't interesting enough to make it in the music industry you can eat up them words. You go Luke because you're definitely on fire and one of my favorite country singers.🤩
I just want to give you a hug! Lol. I'm just so proud to be from the same state as you!
RHEC💯🇺🇸
To bad he sold out...
Interesting song. Especially after his latest video selling his sole to Mainstream Nashville. #sellout
Miss you everyday Kaitlin 🙇🏻‍♂️😔💔💔💔 until we see each other again I promise Our beautiful Daughter Will Be Fine ❤️💙 miss you every day every breath
My brother introduced me to country music and as soon as I hear "Forever after all" I knew this guy was amazing and this song just adds to my love for him
I'm not crying, you're crying!
Hello World, look us up.  Thanks🇺🇸
With Facebook and YouTube condoning and encouraging spam and scam, I believe it is time for a new spammed paradigm. Facebook no longer deletes spam accounts and comments, along with YouTube. YouTube also allows a scammer’s video to stay up—even against their terms and conditions. YOUTUBE EVEN ALLOWS THESE SCAMMERS MONETIZATION AND ADS FOR GODSSAKE! With YouTube removing the dislike button, now we won’t even be able to spot these scam videos and accounts that YouTube condones and advocates for. I know YouTube is a big part of our lives, but for Christ’s Sake even a two week boycott with a million users would be enough to make everyone in their offices poo their pants. So, please—unsubscribe to YouTube Premium for the month and spread the message. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk. I’m sorry to highjack your video, thank you for your content
It gives me a Daughtry vibe
Always gives credit where it's due. Just a good ass dude that's why I respect him.
I’m addicted to this song. I love this guy!!! Keep doing it Luke
I love how on upchurchs videos he shit talks you and in the comments it’s 5 y/o just saying your bad but your music is 10x better then his will ever be
If he wasn't doin' this he'd be a homicide detective.
Just love you Luke!!!!! Thank you for the blessings and joy you bring to this world!!! Congrats on #1 on ITunes!!!
So when are you gonna teach Upchurch how to sing ...haha atleast that's what your fans are saying...what a joke
Luke's songs just hit something deep in my heart and damn, I love it.
https://youtu.be/Uwnde6Sdweg
The lyrics... ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Luke one hits again 🤠
Another apologetic sellout..
Friends will AWAYS have your back, and this song most definitely brings that to light. Luke, thank you for such a inspiration
My favorite country artist of all time….
Country music needed him
Hits home for we musicians playing bars in no name towns.  "Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand"  oh yeah.
I love him and love his music!
Luke is hands down has to be a modern-day country legend that is humble of where he is now and where he will be in a couple years. Love this new song because it shows how humble he is and how he thanks people that helped him get where he is now. Another great song luke can't wait to see you live again.
Luke cannot miss - Another absolute banger!!
Luke is so wholesome, love him.  So relatable.
"If I wasn't a singer, I'd be a singer." Makes perfect sense. I guess this is the kind of music you make when you're a sell out.
Been alone for years but always so happy to see young happy couples with babies😥😀
Man I wish he'd do a Middle East tour!
I am still putting tips and the crowd in my hand for 42 years , so you can only believe how many times I've been asked the same question ,thank you Adam church , and thank you Luke 😎😎👍👍👍💥💥
Luke never disappoints!!! Another # 1.
🐐
Awesome song, instant banger.
Another banger! ❤️‍🔥
Likeeee🍓👌🏻🍓
Luke and Chris Stapleton were the only reason to watch CMA. The rest was garbage
🖤
By far the best song and thoughtful video made!
Please come to Massachusetts I love ❤️ all your music just a simple woman lovin Country Music
Best from the rest!!
Wow! What a great song! Love you Luke!! Congrats on your CMA Entertainer of the year award!!👏🏾👏🏾
I only know of luke combs through is songs and videos. I can only say he seems like a great human being himself. Thank you luke may God continued to bless you and all the people around you. Love from one of your biggest fans!
Sell out ..  where have the outlaws gone??   No where to be found .
There is not much left for 1410🔥 God willing, legends, with your support, we will deliver it as soon as possible, 😍 Your brother from. Jordan..........
Cant wait to go to one of his concerts 😩💕
This hits different for all the musicians out there. We all start somewhere.
So this is huge industry music . Hmmmm 2 full days and like combs huge start only has 24k. Wow . I seen Upchurch drawing do that in half a day. I seen Tom macdonald do 500k in 1 day. Day 2 over million. 1.2M no label no help no bull shit. Just True Fans .  In face I don't even think Upchurch lowest video likes possible in 2 or 3   days has done near as bad.  You should be well over 300 or 500 a day. Fuck in 5 days Upchurch. Tom macdonald. Jelly Roll. Now that's a singer. Like you should really take some box lessons from jelly roll. That dude is the best singer out here. Again independent no labels no marketing team. No editing crew to tell what or how write.  Just them and their fans.    Upchurch fuggin .  You all straight up battling and not doing very well with the real independent artist.  We the fans Call the shots We The fans decide who stays or goes home. We the fans will keep Upchurch and Tom macdonald and Adam Calhoun and jelly roll and burden fighting or doing better in music apps.   Your label can't keep up with 5 millions fans.   Oh yeah we decide if your label remains also. We don't but your label closes shop. Good luck. Stay in your lane do not come over to Upchurch side again. We moving fast over here. Youll get ran over in the real man's lane.  Real talk and facts.  Upchurch still climbing. You still hopping and praying they have your back like they said they do when all that stinky crap flows down hill.  Real crappy music from real crappy artist . That's should be the title of the cd
👧❤first time hearing this !
40 yr old aussie bloke sitting here bawlin my eyes out remembering my youth wishin i could change so much. but also realizing its made me the man i am thanks mr combs for keepin it real. it sucks when you are stuck in the city and all i want to do is go bush and just be myself
What happens to your song writing . Weird. You should take some lessons on how structure and have good songs again . Upchurch teach ya real good how play that guitar.  Your sorry? Damn we're sorry you forgot how write your first album almost every song great. Can't find one on this one. Guess that's what happens when someone Upchurch knows extremely close that writes and co writes alit country artist on the radio. Your one of them fuggin.  Noone wants to sing and eat 6 cheeseburgers like you fuggin.  Hey you wanna beer? No well alright I'll just drink yours to.  Fuggin.   Now tell your peeps stay in their lane. Noone over here in Upchurch camp thought about you since last time you made a song that gave you fans to turn around and plead to be taken off. You don't even stand by your own work.  Good luck with standing up with corporate shit music boxes.  We're over here making pure percentage we give none to someone else to help promote my stuff and help me write it.  Your a joke. You make real artist Look amazing.  Keep the jokes coming to Upchurch page . Your a funny comedian than a wait for your songs to be wrote to learn them lmao may e you should stop taking lessons and get back to your real self.  Weirdo .    R. H. E. C.
Keep doing it  man damn your  great keep it up 👍
Why his face do that? Lol
🔥WOW!🔥 NOW THAT'S A  POWERFUL & PASSIONATE VOICE!🎤🎶🤩  You have what it takes to reach millions of people with your incredible music, Luke! 😱I still get shivers when I  hear your 🤠🔥HOT country voice!🎤🔥
Como siempre, nunca falla una. Grande Luke!!!
Aye Luke Combs You The Best Ever 🔥 and I’m Black you made me love this genre of Music I know almost all your songs by heart you the GOAT
One of my dream is to be one of his crowds.
This is just another amazing song from the amazing Luke Combs!!!!!! Congratulations on entertainer of the year!!!! You definitely deserve it!!!!! Love 💕 everything you do!!!
LOVE
Wow Luke your Killin it out there making good music
this song makes me tear up you can just hear the emotion and feel it..... damn he is awe inspiring
I wish I can push the thumbs up a million times
Damn absolutely love this song I love all your music
Truly an honor to have my family and I be apart of this journey with ya buddy! I’ve got to see this dream start and continue to keep building! Some of the best times of my life were hanging out beside you on a barstool just jammin for the app state crowd! Much love to ya brotha, you deserve it all! I love ya man
NEVER. MISS.
I don't know if Like will ever see this but in addition to me being a HUGE fan, I am raising four of your biggest fans! We sing to all of your songs. We are fellow North Carolinians! My boys want to meet you so bad. Hopefully we can come to a show sometime. Keep up the good work man.
Never heard a Luke combs song not go number one
This dude is so woke, no way he is still country. He disrespected Upchurch for 1. Cried about not knowing what the rebel flag on his hat REALLY stood for. All you folks here can have him. He is a POP star!
I just now got extremely angry please punching things and stuff like that and I just listen to some of Luke’s music and I’m not as angry as I was I stopped punching things and relaxed thanks Luke if you are reading this
I LIKE LUKE BUT I HATE WHAT HE DID TO RYAN THATS NOT COOL NOT AT ALL WASNT COOL
Wow, just wow. I have no words. Luke you are a legend my friend
This some BS Luke. You know it's about the money or you wouldn't have sold out to the labels. Who wrote this song?
Like Upchurch said, Luke has some good writers.
Seek Jesus in these last days! Invite him into your heart as your Lord and savior! Jesus is the way, the truth and the life! He’s the ONLY way! REPENT for the kingdom is at hand! Take a look around the world and open the Bible and read and see for yourself it’s unfolding as we speak!
Hell of a thing
🇧🇷
We were there at The Rock. It was a concert of thankfulness to 32K of us. So happy to be a local in Boone.
I can't have 1 favorite song of his, he just keeps them coming hit after hit🥰
🚜🏴‍☠️🇺🇸🇲🇽
Great song Man.  That’s right, we shouldn’t be different around lights or cameras. Same old country boy putting God first. God bless brother.
RHEC
There is so much realness to this song! Love him ❤️❤️
A lot of success for you, I admire you very much, I'm from Brazil🇧🇷, Belo Horizonte Minas Gerais!
1st song I've heard from him and what a badass song!!!
Keep it up Luke! When are you coming to California? Thanks to you I listen to country music now.
This man can not make a bad song! Swear I've said this time and time too
Like Luke good guy and a great singer
Good video Luke. Go ahead.
Written for all of us that worked 25 years doing something that never felt like “work”.
Only here to see if he is going to start crying and apologize for something. #wannabeoutlaw
I can't stop listening to this track I love it
❤
I am not a fan of him anymore after he kissed Nashvilles ass when he did an apology for the rebel flag
Such an Amazing song. Keep them coming
Entertainer of the Year right here folks 🇺🇸
Who else was thinking he was going to name Upchurch?
Mr. Combs, thank you for saving Country Music from descending to the depths of hell.
Sitting in a airport bar in Dallas Fort Worth, listening to this for the first time. And wow, almost cried. Good shit.
When you gonna do European tour come to Scotland
I was at the Boone concert! Damn pretty cool making it into a music video and not even knowing it
Oooh That Hit Different !!!! Luke Did his Thang On this One , The Progression of Luke Combs Since When it Rains It Pours To this Song !!  Whoa total Country music Super Star Keep the Bangers coming Brother !!!
I'd say Luke has definitely sealed the deal as one of the artists in heavens band some day. Who else could welcome you home better than this guy. Knowing where you came from and staying humble is what makes you the best we've seen!
never disappoints 🤍🤍
Never disappointed you totally awesome amazing
Is Adam a friend ? What is the backstory?
I would LOVE to see him live!
I love that, not only is he extremely grateful to Eric Church, he verbalizes his gratitude in such a way you can truly feel the love and respect he has for him as a man, and artist ❤️
I graduated from App State in 1980 and retired back in Boone five years ago. Luke came back this summer and put on the best show I’ve ever seen. Now Eric Church needs to do the same.
This shits played out.  Next.
I love I didn’t deserve this but so glad I did for the CMA Intertaner of the year
Such a humble man. That show at APP was epic!!! So glad I was apart of it.
thIs man can't do a bad song. Wow
I’m not a fan of country music but Luke is a great artist
Absolutely AMAZING song!!!!!!!
THIS TUNE IS GOLD
No one has tapped into REAL life in country music like Luke has at this level since Garth.  Sure there have been other stars, but not someone who has connected to every corner of our country like Luke.  My god he is good.
"Can I get an outlaw" was better
Interviewer: "What would you be doing if you weren't doing this?"  Luke: *starts singing*  Interviewer: "Yeah, Luke, if you could just answer the question, that would be great."
Why is this dude trending?
👏👏👏👏👏 Brasil
What about upchurch he is the reason your here now !
This song is absolutely perfect right after he won his award :)
DAMN
Man, I'd love to have a beer and a bourbon with Luke! Just a down to earth good dude! The world needs more of these kinds of people! Cheers! 🥃 Be kind folks!
Country music's best artist.....
Congralations on your big night of winning a award you deserved it  this song is awesome. Love it. And love all your music

In my opinion he is the most talented singer around the world. Every song he drops becomes a lifelong memory for me to associate with important situations. <3

https://youtu.be/hDxQMr8tog0 Good music!
Lucky enough to have just seen him perform at the Grand Old Opry a couple weeks ago!! Love you Luke!!!
Come to Miami
Beautiful. Very talented!
He is masters a artist, this is probably my favorite song of his.
I’ve had the privilege of meeting that same man in a N.C. Hooters myself 😊 Adam Church! Are really solid good guy that’s lead me to my singing career here in Michigan, doing my best to be recognized but up here in the north we just do what we can… Like keep carrying us and making us up and comers a voice buddy! Love everything you do and I can say it carries me to be a better artist 😊
His Vladimir and Ivan vines! Classic
What’s your side of the story with upchurch.
I absolutely LOVE this song!!!!! Boone, NC, which is mentioned in this song, is my home turf. I grew up about twenty miles or so from there and some of my best memories are from there. It brings a smile to my face listening to this!!! Thanks, Luke and everyone else who had a hand in this to make it come alive. :)
got this mf on repeat
Amazing, this applies to so many things in life.  When you are doing what you are passionate about you would do it with or without mainstream “success”
Big fan would love to meet you and Eric church and all
My dream is to meet you Luke and just be able to hangout for one day oh the thing I would do and give up just to be able to hangout with you. You are my inspiration and truly make my days better hearing you sing
Dislike
This dude can’t make a bad record everything he sings about is so relatable love your music man!
You just don’t miss 💜
Yesssssssssiirrrrrr
Easily one of the best songs you have ever released. It just gives me this feeling that I can't explain. It feels so humble and true and raw. I will listen to this on repeat for a long time to come. I absolutely love it.
A hit as usual
Congratulations on your award.
Awesome!!! 🇺🇸
There you have it...in a song...a simple yet truly profound song!  Great stuff!
You rock!!! ♥
Only if he was president
Wow, love it man. Luke always comes through with a good one and so down to earth. Need more like him for sure
https://youtu.be/5PmLd_JEExQ
Brilliant... just brilliant.  🎵🎼
Great song man. I feel the same... it's just who we are.  Hell of a writer too he is this Adam Church
Can't nobody do it like Luke what a voice
Straight from the heart, like always. You are truly something special Luke...
Wait my wants to sing with you , you are the best
My dream is that I want to see you in person and I hope one day and my husband  sad that too
One hell of a song, so damn powerful, an instant classic!
Another absolute banger, this guy never ceases to amaze me
You're amazing, you're definitely a legend 👑👑👑🙏
I have the hat from this concert
He is no good. He is a sell out!
SO honored to be at that show in Boone! You are the best there is! Ilysm!
Rag n bone's brother?😁
He could sing the phone book and it would be #1
was at app state at the same time as luke in boone/grew up in NC, based on that area it's no surprise he's such a relatable ol boy.  keep doing your shit man.

I love your videos!! They are so amazing. Be safe out there everyone 🍒🙏🏾
😍😍😍
I'm speechless  ....... luke combs ❤🤌👌
Luke is the only modern “country radio” artist that I enjoy all of his songs. He’s got a sound to him that I enjoy. It’s a shame he sold out, I just hope his sound doesn’t change.
Love this Man, he's awesome ❤️
Love this song!! He just got a new fan
Such a passionate singer and songwriter! Thank you Luke Combs!
👌👌
Yeah' yeehaw.

Jesus loves you! ♥️ Do not give up on your life!  Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2
Nice song.
My man cannot miss
This song is so good
I’ll say again, Gordon Lightfoot! Brilliant!
Wasn't this song featured on Team America World Police 15 years ago?
Your humbleness is truly beautiful.
Luke is bottom fish , compared to ,  Aaron lewis ! The CMA WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE THE GREATEST , AARON LEWIS , FOLKS LISTEN TO HIS #1 SONG , AM I THE ONLY ONE ! HE IS A TRUE PATRIOT ! LUKE IS OK , BUT YOU  CANNOT COMPARE AARONS TALENTS TO LUKES ! HE WILL NEVER MEASURE UP ! LGB !!
Hi
This song is Freaking awesome
Another hit sang from the heart. I've been there along side you and Adam since day one. Way to never forget how it all began.❤️👍💪🙏
not one bad song made by him
Liberal Supporter 🤡
Old town road better
You are such a class act!! I am so glad you won entertainer of the year! SO well deserved!! You are well on your way to a king George career!! :)
Savin country one song at a time
I So love this!!!
🖤 https://youtu.be/L0rpkuk4WWU 🖤
I used to scale country songs according to Chris Stapleton, I say 50% Stapleton, 80% Stapleton. but, you are Luke Combs. such a companionate and warm voice
We gonna ask couple questions... simple ones... if you could be doing anything what you be doing if you wouldn't be doing this... Are you kidding me man?
Look at Tesla's share price crash! Ah! The US stock market bubble is easy  to burst. Cash out is your best choice! otherwise u have nothing!
Wow is all I can say.  Speaks to everyone who never got the chance but still does it because they love it.
The man!!!
The Best 💥🤎
💙💙💙💙
Good one! Thanks.
Why does every country singer’s voice sound exactly the same
This song will launch itself to #1 and will stay there for a while.

You did it again Luke!
All country music sounds the same
Killed it 🔥🔥🔥

average trump voter
That’s one hell of a song
Another Hit Luke! This is Awesome! 💯❤
I just don’t have words…this guy is absolutely amazing.
Love this guy hes amazing, all his songs are amazing and touch your heart strings ❤ ♥ 💖
Love this song, keep up the good work.
incredible
Extraordinary as always nothing but love from algeria ❤❤🇩🇿
lol ok YT
Such a stand up guy, that never forgets were he came from! An what a tribute to Adam Church also a stand up guy!
A rural noun, simple adjective.
HE DOES NOT MISS!!!!
Probably the best voice out now
Hell of a song
Wow! Sounds like all the other ones!
Knock it out the park love this song
Just another song to add to the list of reasons why LUKE COMBS is gonna be a name that gets said everytime people talk about the greats of country music
So good... that's all i got!!!
Awesome simple as that......
There's no future for a singer like Kane Brown.  Kane Brown is a disgrace to country singers like  Chris Stapleton, Blake Shelton, Luke Combs, Keith Urban, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.  Kane Brown sounds like a street singer begging for spare change in the street.   😃😃  That's why he can't carry anything on his own, he has to be part of a collaboration...I'm actually surprised anyone wants to work with him at all!  If truth be told, I'd bet Chris Young and Blackbear both were forced to do so.  No Kane Brown at CMA awards please.  He's gonna ruin the show again just like 3 years ago. 😃😃 😃😃 😃😃 He's terribly overrated and he's nothing but a loser!
Up church fan subscribed sorry brother. This song is me I’m doing the song not famous I’m you in my small town make that song.
😍😍😍😍💕
He could sing the phone book and it would sound good.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 LEGEND
Up church got to respect this  with his mouth bro much love
And people this will be a #1 song in no time.
Luke combs literally is sauce
This is top 3 songs you ever produced for sure!!
#AppState baby! Luke, simply, cannot make a bad song.
Another hit
My cousin killing it!! Love ya Adam! Can't believe you've made it so far I'm proud of you man!! Keep rocking it out y'all!! ❤️💯
this song touched me, and still wishing doing something else.... Luke Combs, thank you!! Greetings from Vienna, Austria, Europpe :)
Awesome as always man!!
I Love this song!!!
Who remembers watching Luke on Vine before he made it big???
But according to Upchurch he's a sell out....right??! ...I mean a guy who doesn't remember where he comes from and just forgets his buddies...I mean that's what Upchurch has been screaming right??...this just goes to show you that some people just talk for attention to themselves... Luke combs is the future of country music and next to Stapleton the most talented singer/song writer on the radio today! Or in the last ten years! Keep em coming Luke!
"God is real. God loves you. God wants the best for you. Believe that. I do."  Chris Pratt
Yeah Luke! YEEEE this is suck a damn good song
Last night I feel asleep to this song. My new favorite. Thank you for being the best insporation ever!
We are huge fans of yours and Carolina boys as well do your thing Luke
It took decades, but country music finally let its guard down about homosexual relationships. This is an important day.
Every time I watch this I find myself crying just a little...okay first time full on ugly cry. This is the best video and oh my gosh his voice. Kinda a different sound from him but fits him so well.
Nice
Go Neers.
Love it..Hes always amazing with his music.That voice thow..🙏🤘🤗✋✋✋🔥🔥
I must say u deserved ur award 🥇 m8 as u r the best country singer out there.thank you for this song ,stay safe keep ur wife safe to m8
🤗🎼🎶🎵🎵💯🥁🎹🎸🎵🎶🤗
He's one of the few modern country musicians I like and we went to the same college. The clips from the stadium and the area made me miss my days up there.
REPENT and live life like LORD JESUS CHRIST wholeheartedly and lifelong.  Love The LORD GOD with all your heart, mind, soul and strength and love your neighbor as yourself.  “Jesus replied, “‘You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. A second is equally important: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ The entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments.””Matthew‬ ‭22:37-40‬ ‭NLT‬‬
Gonna apologize some more?   Go cover red solo cup or something.
APP.......
Thank you, man!
Is there one bad song  from this man
Brought me to tears! BEAUTIFUL SONG! Your voice is amazing big dawg
Never listened to country in my life really, im  from London but found Luke during lockdown and havent switched off since. Every single song is a banger, blows my mind every time. Plus have also started loving country because of him and I know I am not the only one.
It ain't about fame, it ain't about the fortune, it ain't about your name, it ain't about your glory.   Say it louder.
Good work brother...love it.....man
this song is a masterpiece
Thanks to The Voice who rejected you
Simplest country singer
Love this song 😀 Luke you are great at doing this 👌🏻 definitely one of my favourite country artists.
hell man, you are pure gold! that power of your words is killing me!
it's literally impossible for him to have a bad son...
Gay.
Boone loves you & Adam! Thank you for staying true to who you are & remembering the people who helped you along the way. You've come a long way from playing at Legends.
Love all his music. He can sing anything and make it great.
One of the greatest voices in Country Music! Congratulations Entertainer of The Year 2021.
He is one great singer love all his music
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
you are the best, bro
The App State show was unmatched! Best night of my life.
I know its different but it reminds me of my husband and I. I dont know who is would be right now......when my husband met me I was a young single mom, living day to day without help, stressed, had no idea who I was. I didnt know what it was like to be loved or adored, I had nothing just my daughter and myself that's it. He made a better person, he loved me and made my daughter his and never turned back.
The Complete Wario Apparition-https://youtu.be/w6_uX74wjVo
Sound of country, feel of country, heart of country....I love it!
I used to be a fan but after hearing this Masterpiece I am a whole air conditioner😁❤️❤️❤️❤️
insane song
I just love country music so much Im from New York and i get made fun of alot for listening to country music especially by my friends and family(im a black girl)but its just something about country music that just has such a hold on me.
That friendship is true he’s not a friend that’s a brother I love this
I got teary with this song. This is raw. Just like Country supposed to be. Congrats on Entertainer of the year. This why you won.

Love this!!!! Looking forward to more! Love listening to you and can never get tired!
this man just can’t be stopped
Brought tears to my eyes for no reason lol
If you're not tearing up right now, you might wanna check to see if your heart is where it should be...
I Love Luke his voice is so unique and different from anyone else❤
His reaction last night as he was awarded entertainer of the year , is all you need to know about the man … Luke your music has literally carried me through some of the darkest days , thank you for pure country music 💪
Unliked it just so I could like it a second time
Beautiful!🙂
Incredible voice.. wish I had a talent like his..  I'm working in a dead end job just getting by.. but this song is brilliant
I really love this new bang from Luke. He's so inspirational explaining his journey through his career to make it to the top which makes it impossible to quit doing 'this' which is music. Very inspirational.
I love this song when I heard the second verse. That was me
I love Luke and this song so much!
Unbelievable, we are getting to witness a legend during his come up!
Luke combs never writes bad songs 🔥🔥
❤️👌🏻🔥👆🏻
Luke, man is this a song for Adam who served in the military?
Keep em coming with the bangers Luke 🔥🔥🔥
Relate to this song so much. What would I be doing, if I wasn’t doing this? I joined the military two years ago after dropping out of college, lost. Everyday I’m searching but heres to everyone lost! You will find your way.
Can u at least try to miss?
That damn rasp gives me chills!
No doubt Luke is probably the best country singer out there right now nothing but awesome!!
I'm not really a country music fan, but this song is awesome! Luke Combs is the real deal. He and Adam Church are products of App State and Boone, NC! :) Proud of you for winning last night Luke!! His daughter is adorable!
I just keep hitting replay.  So good!
I was at the concert in Boone. That night Luke, his band and friends were on fire. Keep up the great work Luke. Your music moves us.
OMG luke i love this, i dont know why but it really touched my heart
I didn’t expect that much power in your voice. Gave me chillybumps lol
9 years ago I found Luke through Adam's videos. I listened to every single one and said this guy is gonna be number 1 some day. It's humbling knowing that he is taking Adam with him on his journey.
I love your music, thanks Luke for this art
His voice is so pretend, he tries to sound country so bad. I don’t think it’s that good and never have. Maybe I can’t get passed that he is bleeding heart liberal
I really love the song man, you’re a huge inspiration
Goat of Country

Great video! Really made me miss our time at Appalachian. Glad to see you are still doing well man!
Adam and Anna were happy kids that were part of our church family when we at Foscoe. Philip and Delores were good parents.

SINGGG ITTTTTT
It’s so evident that he’s called to this. Dang man. Keep “doin thing.”
Saw this last night on the CMA's, but couldn't really hear it. The Grandkids had just showed up. So the house was a little loud. Damn good song.
He couldn't make a bad song if he tried. Hell, he couldn't even make just an average song if he tried. The dude is amazing!
Simply great👍 . Great shout out to a good buddy. Luke will go down as One of the best artists to ever make records
I love Luke combs so much best country wing
Love the video to❤💜⚘🍦⚘💚
Beautiful love it ❤💜⚘🍦⚘💚
Te amo Luke combs !!! You are the best singer in this planet.
Great Song. We have watched Adam sing a few time at woodlands BBQ in Blowing rock. always a good show for sure.
Love you Luke!!
One of my favorite songs!!!!!
This video and song gives me chills.  I went to App State while Luke and Adam would play on the bar stools in the corner of the bar.  Little did we know Luke would go on to be one of the biggest country artists of our time, and to be honest we slightly took it for granted.  What a great video to pay tribute to one of his best friends who was there from the beginning before his fame.
Another one. Cannot wait to see him live for the second time in London.
I am so happy you done so good last night. I was pulling for you. Good job. Love your voice
Said it once and I’ll say it again it’s not possible for this man to make a bad song!!!
Many great artist, but non add up to luke combs. And those legends better watch out. 🐐 moving his way up
PERFECT 🤠
Doin’ This (Lyrics)  Someone asked me once in an interview What was growing up like? Where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this? I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool  [Chorus] I’d have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin’ them same damn songs like I am now I’d be feelin’ on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin’ through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I’d still be doin’ this if I wasn’t doin’ this  [Verse 2] I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day Who was burnin' CD's just to give away Payin' his dues If I wasn't doin' this Five deep in a van, head full of steam Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true Livin' this life just like I was born to do   [Chorus] I’d have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin’ them same damn songs like I am now I’d be feelin’ on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin’ through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I’d still be doin’ this if I wasn’t doin’ this  [Bridge] It ain't about the fame It ain't about the fortune It ain't about the name It ain't about the glory I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about  [Chorus] Having a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin' them same damn songs like I am now I’d be feelin’ on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin’ through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I’d still be doin’ this if I wasn’t doin’ this  [Outro] Someone asked me once in an interview What was growing up like? Where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?
Que música fantástica, saudações do Brasil 🤠
Amazing song, amazing vocals, amazing person all around! Thank you for this song and for your incredible music!!!

Sometimes you hear a song from an artist and you just know that it's something amazing! This is that song! Bravo Luke Combs! You humbleness and heart shine through on this song and it's a beautiful thing!
Dude just can't miss. Entertainer of the year was well deserved
I had goosebumps watching this! We saw Luke in Chicago last week and this guys is very kind and down to earth. He deserves all the recognition because he is grounded and very thankful to everyone who helped him in his career.
Another great song, Luke. You are very best country singer!
This song gives me goosebumps and teary eyes. Don’t know why but dang it’s good!
Would love to see luke live from a scottish fan  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿👍

There isn’t a single song made my him that i don’t like 🥺
Adam!! How cool man! Great song Luke!
Artist that never misses man this is awesome!!
OMFG!! How the hell do you do this over and over again!!
This gave me chills, you are certainly an absolute Legend Luke ... keep doing this
I sing your music out loud in a little town called Southern Pines NC out on a little dirt road near the towns cemetery where my Abuelito (grandpa) lays. I grill something to eat just about every single day in my front yard at mamas house yeah I live with mama I'm Mexican and that's what we do. I slam down watermelon Steel Reserves and Blast your music on a 1,000 watt P.A and I always sing my heart out as loud as I can as best as I can and I ain't no singer and I don't know how to pick a cord but I have to say when I sing your music it feels like I'm you and you're me and we're both doing what we would be doing I can't explain it brother but your music just somehow has my soul in everything you sing. Also I can't ever not cry while singing "And I know there'll be that moment the good Lord calls one of us home and one won't have the other by their side but heaven knows that won't last to long" it ain't just about the ones we lost it's about love now and then and no matter what I'll always be right there by your side just as you'll always be here in my heart ❤️
When you relise the guy in the video is Adam Church! What a way to say thank you ♥
Good songs. Ryan upchurch dogged on your ass tho lol
The talent is in every little thing and that's why I love your music. Thanks for the emotion and passion🎶🇦🇷😍
He will go down as one of the best ever!!!!
Like Forest Gump and Lieutenant Dan 🤘
He did it again!
He can’t disappoint!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn Good Song Luke \m/, Big Fans....Were Hoping To See You In Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.... Soon!, Rock On Brother, Wish U All The Best\m/\m/
Great job Luke love your music
Luke just can’t make a bad song at all. I absolutely love this and the amazing storyteller that is Luke Combs. I felt every word of this song.
Modern Country music that's pleases my ears and also my mood.
Let’s all take a minute for all those artist who never “make it”.  Well done Luke!
just the emotion
I’m still surprised how consistently talented Luke combs is. Another great song added to the library thanks Luke 👍
Here before a million
Luke just thinks he's the star in this video. It's actually Adam's little girl. She's cute as a button!   Oh great song Luke! Gonna add it to my mix.
Absolute legend!
Wonderful song no words can describe how beautiful this is
How can you not make a bad song? Amazing sounds
How is this even possible for 1 human being, to be this talented, stunning
I smiled 🙂.  Loved it  this is healing
Absolutely amazing!!! This is definitely another chart topper!!! ❤
instant classic
This man always has me smiling or crying in a good way ! Can’t wait to see him
85k
Love your songs. They get me through life
https://youtu.be/oB4lyB8MkUk
I’m ( doin this ) as I’m watching another Luke combs legendary song and can’t wait to see you live in concert here in queensland australia
ANOTHER BANGER
It doesn't get any better than listening to this guy!
39 dislikes = 39 crumbs of humanity.
Great job, strong song, don’t forget your buddies after all
The modern day AJ...songs with meaning
God dammit why does this radio country show up on my feed? Sounds just like the rest of the shit "pop country."
Holy goosebumps. This is epic.
❤❤🔥🔥
Top...
Wow! That may be my new favorite
I really want to see this legend live! you need to tour the UK!! 🤠👍🇬🇧
Needs more Uk tours!
The man could sing a phone book & it would be perfect ❤
A Fair Dinkum fella for sure!
What a great song !!!
Reminds me of my guys and the road I am on doing this music thing full time. What a good song and badass video including a guy who was there by your side at the start of the ride. Class act man. Never forget opening for you and sharing a beer with ya a couple months before Hurricane hit hard!
Yessssss.
Every song is just so damn good!! Love mall your songs!
I love this new song 🥰
YEEEEEE YEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!
Awesome tune, nice work Luke.
How can you not love this guy? He's a tub of lard, and I mean that in a positive way, because he's closer to the average country music fan than the other singers who are trying to look like models or bodybuilders. No keto diet like Tim McGraw and his six-pack abs on TMZ, and no comments like Brad Paisley on your lack of "patriotism" if you choose not to get vaccinated -- as if that measures how patriotic somebody is. He writes his own music unlike Blake Shelton or Jason Aldean, who are singing somebody else's words (as good as they are). And everything he releases goes to #1!!!
Luke you don't miss
Fucking incredible
this is the best!!!!, my heart skips a beat, great, just perfect!!
When are you coming to Australia for a show?
this one is going to be a banger!
I love this song. Wonderful voice.
once he starts singing it’s unbelievable. I started loving country music ever since i heard one of his songs. It’s a different type of feeling when I listen to country 💓
I LOVE LUKE COMBS
my new favorite song of yours❤️❤️
"I’d have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand"   wwow!!! gives me chills.
Every song made us forget the old ones . Maan you're the best keep going.
My current favorite Country singer right beside Blake!
Gonna love every song on the next album as I did the previous ones.
Everything this guy sings is golden such a great song

Amazing!!
You made a lot of bootleggers happy tonight

Will forever love your music...
ANOTHER AMAZING LUKE COMBS SONG!!
It's common to see corruption along with fame and fortune, thank you for proving them wrong. Your fans are what seem to make you more genuine, that's one of my favorite attributes to my favorite artist. Hope to see you around MD one day, you are the reason I started to play and sing; try at all if you will, I love you man, keep it up! This song reminds me a lot of my ol' favorite song by you, "Dear Today", honesty at its purest, you haven't changed, that's the best part. :) (Idk if you'll ever read this but I hope it gets to you one day:)
I'm here in africa and luke combs is my favorite singer of all time all his songs have deep meaning each words you can feel them or relat with it

This is such a great song
this slaps.
Oof that voice boy 🔥🔥🔥 powerful
LUKE, I love this song. The music video is perfect. Everything is so raw and I love how humble you are despite the fact that you are one of the best if not the best, country ARTIST to exist right now. I got to see you in concert and all I did was cry because I couldn’t believe I was present in your very own show. Good job, LUKE. This will be such a hit!
Entertainer Of The Year🏆Congratulations🎼
Omg Luke combs I just watched the cma awards and I saw that you won entertainer of the year anything you could have won I was praying for you to win and at the end I kind of lost hope because Chris Stapleton won a lot of them but when I Heard them say your name I screamed I was so happy for you so I’m just saying good job on winning!!!!!! I want to add something. last year I was in forth grade and our Music teacher was going to have a talent show that you could perform with a friend or anybody and me and my cousin we’re going to perform 6 feet apart I love your music!!!!
Where are my Appstate people at?
If someone who never heard a country song ask me to play them a few im giving them some Luke combs
I was like wait, this came out an hour ago?! Perfect timing!
We saw him live for the 1st time a couple months ago. WOW!! Can’t wait to see him again!!
If you don’t go check out Adam Church after this did you even watch?
Bruh you sounded better then Stapleton and that’s saying something
Luke Combs is a class act for sure!
Man!!!!!! I have NEVER been disappointed with the music Luke makes!!! He is by far the best Country Singer out right now!!! Amazing voice!!!! Thank you for hits after hits!!
Thanks Luke.🇺🇸⚔️🍕🍺👍
Respect to Adam, and the thousands of other artists, that grind every week doing what they love and bringing joy to the faces of the people they play for. And respect to Luke for knowing where he came from, being grounded and lifting up those who helped raise him. It took me 34 years to find a music genre that actually spoke to me and these are the types of songs that really hit home. Stay humble. Much respect, from Australia 🇦🇺🇺🇲 🍻
Love this!!!
Very heartfelt, just listening to his songs and this very song here tells you he doesn’t just right songs to write them… everyone of them means something to him and everyone else
I hope I end up doing something I love like this
Dudes a hit machine facts!!!
Damn good song! Keep it up!
Absolutely love it! I'd do anything to go to one of your concerts, your voice and songs are just amazing and touching!!! Thank you for making and singing the music you do

Awesome song
November 10, 2021 CMA Awards. You sang this for the first time and I knew this would be onw of those songs that'll be played 10 years from now.
How can he make such amazing songs that hits home for everyone in all different situations.
Luke combs very makes a bad song
Man I love  this !!!!! Always so humble 🥰
amazing!! has been my favourite artist since early 2015 and i've been his 0.1% top listeners on Spotify since then. This march is the first time i'll ever be seeing him concert as he's doing a Canadian tour, Im so excited you don't understand. Im a man who's gonna cry when this guy comes stage, shows the power he has with his music!!.
as his wife, i think he makes the best albums
The Goat🐐
Love it!
This guy puts so much heart and soul into his music and that’s why he’s probably my favorite artist. I kept getting waves of nostalgia listening to this
Who’s still listening 2021?
If you don't know who Adam Church is today, you probably will by tomorrow.
I love it
He can’t make a bad song that brings every feeling out in me!
Who else thinks luke is the best country singer he's got the best music🔥🔥
"Insta-hit"
What a legend! I remember seeing him in little bars in Blue Ridge Ga.
Omgggg Lukeeeeee! I am obsessed with you. You are so unselfish and to sing such a beautiful song about your friend just warms my heart, this is on my replay list ❤️ loved watching you in Corpus! Worth the drive! 🎶
Why am i crying 😭
This man can’t make a bad song. Amazing stuff!!!
Wow! Best video yet!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Just Be Yosef Luke!! I love how you  and Adam Church still show love for Appalachian State University! Love the clips of your concert at Kidd Brewer Stadium and Woodlands BBQ (my favorite)!
Omg absolutely love this!!!! Love all your music saw you in corpus tx floor seats!!! All your music is AMAZING WE LOVE YOU LUKE COMBES!!!!!
to the person reading this I hope your having a wonderful day/night and stay healthy always
So much respect for keeping every song real home country. Can't not listen to every song he puts out.
Luke... this is amazing, my favourite yet!
Legend in the making, keep up the good work! I went to the Jacksonville fl concert and will never forget the experience
Let's not leave out Aaron with a stellar performance!
Just seen this on the CMA's hes gold money on everything
So inspiring!!! And way to go putting one of your best friends into the spot light. He is so deserving!! This video is a tear jerker for sure
Love this song and the video. Love that everyone of his songs holds a special meaning.
This is freaking AWESOME!!❤
Another number 1.
You got tears strolling down my face! Such a moving tribute to those who matter 💕
And my other fav https://youtu.be/uXyxFMbqKYA
He just keeps getting better, when you think he can't top his last song, BAM! He does, sincere and honest, let's see who else can do it👍👍 2 thumbs up because that's all I got to give 😀
Here before 10k at 8.1k
Don’t like this song but this one from 2 years ago still my fav https://youtu.be/7Lb9dq-JZFI
Once again Amazing Song. You continue to put out great songs.
Luke Combs is the best artist ever dude I swear. He is so genuine and humble. No other artist makes music for the fans if that makes sense. On songs like Without You or This Ones For You and now this one, he always mentions what makes him who he is today and he is the most real artist just because he always acknowledges the road to fame. Thank you Luke Combs for being such an amazing artist and person.

The guy has never written a bad song... ❤️❤️❤️
Someone asked me once in an interview What was growing up like? Where'd you go to school? And what would you do if you weren't doin' this? I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool [Chorus] I’d have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin’ them same damn songs like I am now I’d be feelin’ on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin’ through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I’d still be doin’ this if I wasn’t doin’ this I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day Who was burnin' CD's just to give away Payin' his dues if I wasn't doin' this Five deep in a van, head full of steam Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true Livin' this life just like I was born to do I’d have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band Singin’ them same damn songs like I am now I’d be feelin’ on fire on a hardwood stage Bright lights like lightning runnin’ through my veins At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town I’d still be doin’ this if I wasn’t doin’ this [Bridge] It ain't about the fame It ain't about the fortune It ain't about the name It ain't about the glory I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about
loveeeeeeee it sara if you see this i fucking love you
Schlong 👆🏻

Luke combs it’s nice to see there’s still a few real country music artists left your music reminds me of listening to Alan Jackson with my dad
You are precious Luke Combs, I hope you have a blessed life and continue to stay humble ❤ I'm thankful to be able to listen to authentic music from a genuine person. Great job!
This man just can’t make a bad song another great song
Absolutely love it.  💙💙
My daughter and I just watched this video. We can’t wait to go see him live next Tuesday for her first concert ever. She is in love with Luke.
Obsessed with him!
Thank you, again. Truly always appreciate your new music!
I love how Luke doesn’t give all the credit to himself. I love how the music video is about both of them and how far they have come this is why I love his music
❤🤠🎶 Haven't heard a Luke song I don't love!

Absolutely obsessed with Luke's music, his lyrics are amazing. Me and my partner are using his song beautiful crazy for our first dance at our wedding. Wish we had more of this type music over here in uk. Hopefully one day he tours over here, would be amazing to see him live
As a non American, this is how I picture every one of you is. I love it XD
❤ Every Song Luke Combs ❤
This guy is the total package...this song will be another #1 song on the charts!!
I absolutely love everything you have ever come out with so far.  Keep up the good work. It's amazing when your words can touch a person's soul like your words do.
There’s not one song that I don’t like by Luke Combs. Some of his songs put a lump in my throat because I can relate so much! 💙
Roll Neers
you could sing old mcdonald and STILL get number one Lol it's true
Fire 🎵🎶🎵🎶✍️✊🕺❤️
YES YES YES
This is the reason why you're my favorite country artist ❤️ this is also the reason why I say your my influence for playing my guitar and being a songwriter ❤️❤️
Damit Luke,  you did it again with an Amersing song,  love all of your songs
You know when someone gets it? Yeah... that
here in first 35 minutes
Other sings can learn from Luke. Like every song he has put out so far! Keep it coming!! Damn Just heard the steel guitar in this song. Miss that sound so much!
Always a hit song one after another! I always look forward to hearing each new song because I already know it's gonna be GOLD! Keep 'em comin! Love Luke's music!!
Ok this is the next number one for SUREEE dude u cant mess up I love ur music
Me: I've been crying for a moment because I saw something I shouldn't have seen about Luke ôn uebu.Me again: I only saw the dms, poor girlfriend
I'll admit..I jumped off the Luke train a while back after seeing him in concert.  Don't get me wrong..he sounded great and put on a good show, but I guess I was just expecting more authenticity. The whole show felt super scripted and over commercialized.  However, this song and him giving mad love to his buddy you can see him singing with in videos from almost 10 years ago... that's REAL.
Omg this song!!
Everything is beautiful, the voice, lyrics, video, and Luke's performance 😍😍  I'm glad to be a fan of Luke! LUKE COMBS FOREVER AFTER ALL!!
Love all the video clips of your old YouTube videos. You've come a long way buddy. Awesome song. Keep it going friend.
I've been inlove to country music because of this guy ❤️ Love from a fan faraway 🇵🇭🔥
Wow …I am speechless !
😍love this
Love it Luke! Come back to Australia soon!
Now THAT is REAL COUNTRY music 🎶 .  Keep it up Luke
Good on you Luke! You've come a hell of a long way from the I Don't Want This Night to End video to now, major props to being loyal to the ones that helped you along the way.
I was at the edge of me seat all day waiting for this to air! Just watched it on CMA’s. This man never disappoints
