Beat up a game Plant. Caleb plant was tough in 2021. This loss ended his rise. Canelo sent him down the path to his retirement less than 4 years later. After Plants latest loss he will retire. Canelo fights on. Both fighters always give us effort and drama-
The disrespect Canelo gets is ridiculous. The guy chases greatness. Fighting some big ass dudes.
We just want the highlights, not a commentary
.         766.                      !     66 6
In what universe does this video constitute "highlights"??
That shit was a massacre 🤣 goddamm
Benavidez you're next..
Fixed
Plant Hubiera peleado asi como.peleo Ayer contra Benavides! Al canelo se le venden los boxeadores!
Mexican monster is waiting
The hell is the point in this video? Delete it or rename it
Plant had no intention to knock out canelo.he didn't give a serious power shot.btw, he got his biggest pay day.
Dimitry Vibol
Can he beat Bivol in a rematch?
canelo isn't legit until he beats Jake Paul
Canelo is beast but loss to Bivol
Canelo doesn't  need footwork.
Lo que entendí del inglés es que  Canelo le saco la Xuxa😂😂
Why did you cut the video? We wanted to hear when the announcer said the words: "And the new undisputed super middleweight and STILL UNDEFEATED...." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Latino es Latino !! y con eso no se jode !! Gracias Canelo !!
Canalo is a robber
Boxing politics ruined GGG's legacy
GGG was robbed twice
Yessir
your highlights went from feeling out in round 1 to the 11th round stoppage
Teo is like a unified champion but the takeover got takeovered by kambosos 😂😂😂😂
Canelo walking like that is dangerously amazing at 1:34
lol at Usman wanting to box Canelo. He ko’s Journeyman Masvidal and Jabs Burns into tears and all of a sudden, Marty thinks he can beat Canelo.
Caleb Plant is a BUM.
Canelo es un payaso😂🤣😅😆😅🤣😂🤣😅😆
El problema de todos es que buscan  noquear a canelo en vez de usar la misma técnica de el pegar en brazos y cuerpo después a noquear
Great video, thank you! Canelo will not only become the greatest Mexican boxer of all time, but the greatest boxer of all time!!! Cheees
Canelo on roids
Im order to really get under a Mexicans skin you have to be white
5 belts!
Pa q gane el gringo q gane el latino. Eso sí no me explico cómo el canelo no noquiaba en 154 ni en 60 y en 168 si???
Pa q gane el gringo q gane el latino. Eso sí no me explico cómo el canelo no noquiaba en 154 ni en 60 y en 168 si???
lol at teo
3:16 Mike is there chewing shrooms.
you talk too much
Un-wise to anger Canelo. Plant got 'planted' for his indiscretion; silly boy.
Canelo humble boxer dont trashtalk like pakyaw
He bit off too much with Bivol just wait
Nice!
What do you mean canelo wants to be the greatest mexican fighter ??? HE ALREADY IS THE GREATEST PIRIOD ....
Floyd rematch
Canelo can't f*ck with anyone of that speed and defense but Plant doesn't have power. Mayweather is just a teacher
Simular mejor
Plant no supo similar es nocaut, tenía k esperar un buen golpe, kovalev lo hizo mejor supo similar
Dont mess with Canelo
Who has the IBO belt then?
Greatest Mexican fighter???he is probably one of the best in the WORLD
If I saw Canelo running at me like that I’ll just knock myself out
Showtime highlights are garbage
Crazy to think that GGG is the only fighter to go 24 rounds with canelo and, never got knocked down.
It looks like Plant's big mouth finally caught him... KO :)
Jake Paul Next.
God have mercy on u through Christ
CANELO A LION 🦁
Floyd is the best defensive fighter..  No one can beat him.   When i see Canelo i got a similar feeling of manny Pacquiao
Perfect timing getting Plant at the exact right time. Mans fought nobody and stood 11 rounds with Canelo and honestly.... did better than 99% of Canelos competition. Defense looked tremendous at one point and if he had a few more fights before hand. I gotta say it... his style is very anti Canelo just lack of experience.
its time to face Jake Paul!!
Estamos muy orgullosos de nuestro campeón 🇲🇽 !!! We love you Canelo!!
He’s already the best Mexican fighter of all time! Because he’s the best boxer in the world he wanted to be like Muhammad Ali he surpassed him long ago! And if you want to argue about that fine. Pull up every great fighters record and I will trump it with Saul Canelo Álvarez record. He’s the only boxer ever to hold the titles he has, he is in a league and a class of his own!
Andy Ruiz looking kinda salty  in the background they should keep a eye out on him
Canelo y sus  fans me la pelan
Qué amarga es la derrota y aún más cuando demuestras haber sido un bocazas..!!
Plant sucks
2:15 nmms le da un sape que huevos hahhahahahahahahahahahahah🤣🤣
This was no more than a payday for plant.
Why don't they show when plant dodged canelos punches in the earlier rounds
Canelo slowly broke him down, I honestly believe that if Plant would have traded with Canelo more openly he might have done even better or been KO’d faster. I guess thats why he chose to move and survive
canelo should slow down. makabu about to murk him.
Ya but he’s still afraid of jake Paul
Callum Smith deserves a rematch
He is the greatest Mexican fighter of all time name one and I'll tell you why not
arriba canelo.saludos desde peru
Plant kind of reminds me of when CM Punk got into MMA.
Eddy slaps Canelos head @2:15  Canelo looks back: who the f. ohh hello master Eddy: Get down here and congratulate  to your opponent
CANELO LOST TO FLOYD FLOYD SCHOOLED HIS ASS
Never gets old
Последний бой Коняло будет, когда он выйдет против Усика!
Canelo needs to move up in weight and he seems like can handle it just fine. Conquer up to cruiser weight at least
Canelo le dijo en que banco le hiba a depositar la ganancia de las apuestas 🤑cuando se abrazan al final 🤑🤑🤑🤑
Canelo  will destroy Floyd now
I'll tell you exactly why plant was knocked out and lost to Canelo.  It was his outfit, especially those trunks with the six inch white fringes.  Here's a bit trivia and a little known fact about plant.  His favorite song in the whole wide world is from a broadway musical and that song is, "Surrey With The Fringe On Top."  A rumor isn't a rumor that doesn't die.  That costume used to belong to Liberace!  Now you know.  Uncle Le😎
1:47
Jermall Charlo better than Canelo
This is not a highight video!!!
hard to beat a guy on STERIODS...
Canelo is the 🐐
GGG is to old for Canelo now. But it would of been another war...
2:15 is the only thing that hurt canelo.
The goat
All 10 seconds of highlights
plant did good
Revancha canelo vs jacobo
Jjust leaving this little piece of info cause some people think his name is Canelo when that is in fact a nickname. Canelo is an adjective in Mexican charreria used to describe sorrel-maned horses, which in turn comes from the word Canela (Cinammon). When brewed into tea, cinammon turns water a reddish-brownish color.
Canelo’s great but he was not caught once but twice taking banned substance.   We want to put him there on the very top but that instance is just bothersome
How about Canelo v Betrbiav next? 🙄
Canelo has Mike Tyson’s anger but he’s a better smarter fighter… scary
Canelo es el mejor libra x libra desde chile saludos y aguante México
Caleb did everything wrong . He abandon the jab . Stay on the ropes too long . Didn’t protect his body enough . 🤦‍♂️
Now we see why he was lifting weights:  Not to improve his boxing but to help him hold all of those belts.
Canelo doesn't need volume his accuracy and power makes up for it
Павел Силягин нокаутирует вашего Альвареса !))))
You guys really believe this false super hero.come on look at the opposition look at how his fights play out watch carefully how well put together they are without the sound and you will get a clear perspective
Prime Canelo beats prime mayweather
This shows how good Floyd mayweather is
🔥
Did you see the punch that turn Plant's bicep backwards? Man, Canelo really hurt him well
Highlight or you talking about Canelo for the whole video ?
Undisputed Cruiserweight Champ next!
2:27 "now that you felt it stfu, you my bish now"
Good video
Mexico 1-0 USA
Need a rematch against Kovalev , kovalev was destroying canelo then he stopped fighting....that was very weird.
😀
G p t cp
Not gonna lie Plant had him beat in the first few rounds. I’m glad Canelo won though he’s one of my favorite boxers, VIVA MEXICO CABRONEEESSSS!!! 🇲🇽
Cant find highlights anywhere else
Canelo is the best boxer  Palnt  is good at talking🤣😂🤣
Mayweather is not worthy in this conversation
how much Tyson was paid just to be there
Conelo beats one more big mouth ass .
You talk too much
Amazing by the great canelo
Boy would I love to see canelo put Mayweather on his ass
I doubt ggg goes up in weight he stayed at the same weight class his whole pro career fighting none elites  but canelo  and see how that went
The caption says Canelo/Plant highlights.Just play the full highlights .We don’t need to hear from you.
Such an obvious win. He’s a living legend
Caleb.... Faceplant
He ate his own words...Plant was not " Listo pa los chingasos!" 🤣
Canelo's trainer smacked him behind the head.
alternative title: Pathetic wannabe got schooled by mexican legend
Canelo no es humilde!
Man, i think GGG needs his rest..
He's got a good chin, hits hard. Kind of worried about him moving up to cruiserweight
Floyd would never get hit with what canelo got hit with.
Canelo Alavrez is a tough tough tough Super smart fighter
Will never be the TBE - that’s Floyd.  Who happens to be an American!
Congrats to Plant for fighting Canelo most American fighters play dodge ball
31 years Canelo will KO 31 years old Floyd..
Plant survived 11 rounds that is basically like wining when you are fighting Canelo.I thought he was going down in 5-th round max.
Shows may weather is a monster
👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
The greatest Mexican fighter of all time is Marcos Maidana
Greatest Mexican Fighter
He lost to mayweather amd tarnished his reputation could've been the goat but he couldn't win the big one, not impressed
Most people would say that getting into the ring and getting pinned up against Canelo is the fastest way to get to know god; and they aren’t wrong - you would be staring right at him.
Rounds till 4 you kept it for your mom or what,who is enjoying with 3 black men
lol, some guy keeps messaging me saying that plant and canelo was "tied" in the cards...until he got knocked out, so he didnt get rocked. Thats like saying I had as much money as Elon Musk until he started to earn money and got rich lol
M
there go that white narrative and donr nbody want to see that bs canelo n ggg.. gtfoh..dumb as narrative to cut out charlo and andrade benavidez.. you dont know nothing bout boxing nothing but  bitch boy stephen a  narrative talk
Es una bestia
Canelos power Is unreal
Mexico's future President .
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽💯💯💯💯💯🥊🥊🥊🥊
Canelo vs mike tyson
Benavides ain’t ready
Canelo!
Did that settle the beef?
Canelo vs Benadivez
plant suks as a boxer
Alvarez juices
Canelo looks like the whitest Mexican i have ever seen
Alvarez is true legend, so much buzz.
do you not know who Roberto Duran is?
Canelo 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽👊🏼👊🏼...
Again Plant could of won on points if he stuck to his boxing skills instead of trying to brawl inside with canelo. Very stupid decision. Canelo shouldn't give Plant a rematch cause I think Plant will stick to his strength which is his boxing skills and will beat Canelo on points.
how is this a highlight  video? you should 2 rounds? canelo had alot more good exchanges you could of shown
by the way Canelo also lost to GGG not officially but who cares about paper win
good job puto latinos numero uno
Time for a name change?  Not mma news only anymore.
That's how highlights should be like !!!
Alvarez will get revenge . Floyd is too old as a fighter. If they were the same age, Floyd would spank him every time.
No Mayweather ,Carnelo #2
Plant all talk Zzzzzz..zzzzzz.zzz
Mayweather give Canelo his rematch! Cmon Mayweather King Canelo deserves a rematch! He fought you when he was in his early 20's and is way better now then he was then. KING CANELO RULES SUPREME!!!
3:25 I need to put my hands on that jacket, idgaf how much it costs
wow Canelo 😱
F Canelo he got his ass beat by Triple G twice!
Teofimo isn’t even undisputed lmao
Canelo couldn't hit plant his defense kept canelo for being explosive all planted needed was more punching power i bet 3000 plant will beat him if they rematch
Canelo looks ripped
Pacquiao would wipe the floor with him right now.
👍
Plant is a fucking good fighter his talentet
Plant is a punk and got justifiably owned
What's the last Black fighter he has fought?
Canelo es "chingon"
Canelo lost twice to GGG
looks like early stoppage to me
the cockiness didn’t work out for the plant 🌱
yo this commentator is fire
How can canelo call himself a champion without having fought the GOAT himself - Charlie Z?
Canelo>>>>>>Mayweather
Team CANELO 🇩🇴🤝🇲🇽🥊💎👑
Plant must be boxing in womens league
How many people have already commented..."Canelo put a Plant in the dirt"?🤔 Or some kind of play on words? I didn't want to read through 1k of comments. Just wanted to know if there were any funny ones.
CANELO ALVAREZ VS DEVONTA DAVIS
Stop ducking Benevidez!
Le tocó una época donde los peleadores no ofrecen mucho y necesitan rebajarse en el pesaje y antes de la pelea para vender y generar morbo
Caleb plan wkwkwkwkkk
I’m starting to think Canelo might have a chance against Jake Paul
The best hit thrown was by his coach telling him to get down
So would he call himself a scottish mexican lol
A red headed mexican.......... who knew
I love how during th ko you can see Mike Tyson in the background with the light reflecting off his bald head. Like he is a mystical boxing god.
canelo is one of (if not the) best fighters i've viewed.  first off, he is past fighting the b league fighters.  every fighter he has fought in the 3 weight classes that he owns is a challenger.  i started watching boxing back in the old days with hagler, herns, leonard.  canelo is amazing.  his talents are off the charts.   canelo is stealing the race for best pound for pound fighter of all time.  keep up the dominance canelo.  well done!
Really good commentary. Thank you!
Where's all the Candelo haters now 😂😂
Another fake video smh
Rematch with may weather bro
2:15 the real highlight😶
Jangan bangunkan singa lagi tidur. Canelo is the best 👍
This aint highlights you peanut.
I would love to see GGG actually get the win.
Canelo The Boxing christ benwa
the real GMOAT
Canelo kept coming forward because he knew that plant’s jabs were not hurting him
plant looks more like a serial killer than a boxer!🤣🤣🤣
canelo is a good guy..he forgive caleb for insulting his mother..then wishes for goodluck career ..thats what we called respect and sportmaship ..big congrats and respect from the philiphines 🇵🇭🇵🇭
Gennady is the best!No grugs..like a canelo.but GGG trademark very similar 666🤔I think it`s perseestä,finnish language🤯
Canelo!the Beast
When Canelo is done he will be the 🐐
Jajaja canelo clown 🤡  keep paying to see this stupid fights
Let's see him in a rematch vs GGG....😏
I’m not talking shit because I am not a boxer but plant gave up and flopped. Boxing must be super tough the last rounds. Hats off to them both for stepping in the ring just simply pointing out what I saw.
just remember folks GGG beat cownelo Alvaroids TWICE jejejeje
Canelo is my favorite boxer
That sopapo 2:14
You rather see Canelo vs GGG, over Canelo vs Benavidez??
Canelo was incredible but you got to give credit to plant for surviving and having some amazing dodging dude was quick asf he just couldn’t keep the pressure or power on
Canelo being undisputed makes him the greatest Mexican fighter imo. He's fought everyone already. Charlo Benevides and 3G are not going to be able to keep up with Canelo. He's fighting every quarter.
GGG 3 OR BENAVIDEZ!!
Worst kind of highlights I’ve seen.
The referee is the star! He handle that contest  well.
not sure if hes better than juan m.m.
Canelo sigue siendo una farsa.. todas sus peleas son arregladas
Caleb Plant took a dive. He was forced to do it because too much money is at stake and canelo has to be at the top to keep boxing popular
Canelo vs ggg plss
I was pulling for plant. But I knew cannello had the advantage.
is it a fuckin belt shop?
Caleb gain so much respect from the fans on this day based on how he fought. He can definitely beat charlo and Benavidez, he beats both fighters and he can definitely ask for a rematch if he wants.
SHOW THE HIGHLIGHTS I DONT WANNA HEAR YOU TALK
A Andy Ruiz ni se emocionó cuando Canelo derriba en las dos ocasiones a Caleb. Digamos que le valió vrga!
The same people that give Canelo credit for being undisputed needs to give that same credit to Terence Crawford
Canelo Álvarez el mejor a dia de hoy, mis respetos 🥊🥇🥊🏆
If Canelo is the best for beating Caleb plant how can you not respect  caleb? Caleb must be respected
Canelo for Light heavyweight weight!!! Let's go!
Let me clean your swimming pool Canelo 😭 lol  jk
Técnica de boxeo sucio de Álvarez , golpeó sistematico a la ciática y recursos de golpes de conejo que el referee nunca penalizo , triste campeón mexicano , así las cosas en el box actual.
Jake Paul be like ' ohh shit ths monster gonna knock me out in a minute '
I'm a canelo fan didn't really like plant but tbh I was rooting for plant a little
I love Triple G but he’s way past his prime now, it’s going to be a beat down especially at 168.
2019 jUst after his win again kovalev he was in bali with his lovely girl and friends. Its my proud that i can help and assist him as his private tour guide while he n his friend in bali island for 4 days. He is my first client that pay the hotel bill with black amex card😂. But now no more tourist in bali island since covid,hope everyting will back to normal. Regrds frm bali island🙏
Mahihina naman ang pinapatos ni saul sana akyat sya ulit ng higher division para masubukan ang angas mo gayahin mo si pacquiao na akyat ng akyat ng division napakatunayan nya na. Kung gaano sya kagaling na boksingero db
Idk y u need to dictate what we can see
Plant felt that power it changed his whole demeanor after tko he had no power to stop canelo just kept coming at him u need alot of power and great boxing to stand a chance canelos chin should be on Mt Rushmore so don't feel bad caleb
GGG only fighter to get inside on Alveraz and truly put him to the test . Plant reminds me of Kessler style but soon as I seen plants feet going backwards more than forward it was only matter of time before it was curtains . I don't even think a prime mayweather boxing brain could beat Alvarez at this pinnacle. Alvarez certaintly isn't no cherry picker.
So high mental power
I'm sorry but as long as Canelo runs from Beterbiev, in my book he's just scared
If canelo goes up to light heavyweight and becomes undisputed he will be the greatest Mexican boxer of all time no questions asked
I like how Canelo makes boxers humbled after fighting him
Humble beast
He backs it up yet again.. well done Canelo
Canelo campeón de México
The only thing plant managed to do is piss off Canelo which made him more determined to give him the beating of his life.  All trash talking does is backfire.  Uncle Le😎
Those are not highlights
This videos trash
Canelo is a beast with intelligence....love from sikkim #
The menacing mexican
He needs to rematch Lara or GGG that would be a great test
Canelo a great fighter but his style is made to lose to Floyd...
If there ends up being a rat in Canelo team, it will come from Ruiz! Watch.
México por las nubes con este campeón.
Congratulations to Canelo! But if we’re talking GGG or Canelo, I’m picking GGG over him
Canelo beats Usman in the 1st round of a boxing match ( not an exhibition match full of clauses )  Usman beats Canelo in MMA if he wishes as well
Great video, but too much rapid talking
This was the worst boxing highlight video I have ever seen. Shut your mouth and show the footage
Canelo = marketing
56 1 2 ain't no way plant was going to win unless he stayed on the outside the whole time
And neeeeeeeeeew ... number 1 bullshit ..... Caaaaaaaleeeeeeb plaaaaaaaaaant
Mexico best boxer yall is pus
Canelo vs Tyson Fury
horrible accuracy by canelo
never beats Floyd Mayweather
1:58 He tip toes over and knocked his ass out 🚬👄
Que orgullo!!! Mexico beating the world
Canelo P4P BUM 💩
If he can faced Floyd now.....
I eat a lot of Mexican tacos to be like canelo
Why didn’t we ever get a Canelo vs GGG3?
Canelo looks like a Mc Canelo from from the highlands
JUST A RANDOM GIRL LOST IN COMMENT SECTION 🔞🔞🔞
Still funny to think how Floyd embarrassed Canelo
Fast talking hillbilly gets planted on his trailer park ass.
Mans a beast
People always forget when he got humbled by Mayweather and GGG
Canelo vs Crawford
I cant believe that little skinny guy tried Canelo...
Money talks. If they offered Floyd 250 million to come out of retirement believe you me he comin for that paper.
GGG should face charlo at 168. Then go after Canelo. Or benavidez. He can do it.  Canelo va Plant 2, Canelo vs GGG 3 , Canelo vs benavidez. Canelo vs charlo is all great fights for him.
Canelo top 15 All Time Already
If we could take canelo now vs prime floyd who you think  wins ?
Those steroids are finally kicking in hard....No respect for a boxer that got caught
Los pasitos de Canelo antes del KO pasarán a la historia..😂😂
I like the Respect at the End though
Αδιαφιλονίκητος
Floyd can still beat Canelo even at age 44
I bear witness that there is no god but God, alone, who has no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is God’s servant and messenger, sent by God to the world as a herald of Paradise and a warning of Hellfire.
30 seconds of highlights in a 5 minute video. For fucks sake.
GGG PLEASE
Canelo representante de latino América y todo México ahuevo perros
"whats next for Alverez"??    WE WANT TO SEE ALVAREZ vs.  DIAZ!!!!!    I would love to see that matchup.
dont talk about his fucking mom
Some have stated Canelo  avoiding african american boxers ,they are very skilled  and built different so this may be true but I also believe they are only looking to get paid and Canelo  won't respect that since it is his name that will bring in tickets sales and ppv
El resumen de la pelea dura un minuto, que mierda y defraudador es el Canelo.
Canelo>Floyd
Caleb plant was exposed vs Caleb traux Boxing is a money grab thanks Dana white
I was hoping the black whiteman would make me some money damn it!
can a Gervontay match happen?
Amazing how CANELO 🇲🇽💪🔝💪, tells the REF. To hold his 🤚 higher!!!!!!!
For a highlight reel, that was really underwhelming..
Greatest Mexican fighter of all time!! Is a white guy ;p your welcome.
One day this guy is going to be great!!
Canelo will beat the shit out of ggg
give credit to plant for surviving 11 rounds... a lot of people weren't expecting that.
First they're slapping, then pretending to be boxing. Where are Chavez, Marquez, Terrible, I mean the real Mexican fighters? Canelo is just a joke
Both good fighters.  Plant acts like a walking welfare check
ggg real chmp, but krt3l still undefeated 😂  boxing a lot of BIG DRAMA SHOW itS time to MMA era
Bro talked all that big boy talk the whole lead up and only thing plant did was got walked down and (planted) on the canvas 😅  glad they had a moment in the end tho that was dope cool match 😎
canelo hoy no tiene rival, es el mejor y va a ser el mejor estimo por muchos años mas
move up to light heavy weight 😤
Triple G one more time
Max was here
Canelo: "They came here for money, I came here to smesh, I cam here for legacy".
Terrible video
Plant survive that long because he's giving Canelo some troubles and Canelo having trouble cutting the ring well. Plant is frustrating him for at least 6 rounds. And Plant is not even as good as Lara. This should totally convince all those Canelo fans and Mayweather haters that a prime vs prime match up, there's no way Canelo will beat Floyd at 158 and down. Heck, I don't even see this supposedly prime Canelo beating 2015 Floyd Mayweather at 154.
All these Hypocrites who say "all Caleb needs to do is "box and move". Yet when Floyd did it with his style he's called a runner? They don't know nothing about the "Sweet science of boxing". Stick and move. And Plant is no Mayweather that's for sure. Canelo stop his noise. White boy down and out!
True champ.
He never fought Andrea Ward,his team never wanted to sign the contract,cause they knew Ward would kill him
Way early stoppage. Look at plants eyes when he's getting up from the second knockdown. He doesn't look dazed at all.
Mayweather whipped his little pink butt tho lollll
Bruh we dont want to hear your voice or commentary. just show the highlights and post the scorecards. And if the only highlights you got is from showtime official content. put it in thd title [re-upload].
🇲🇽💪🥊🏆
Candelo Alvarez #5 on Trending and the uploaded is an MMA channel 🤣
Canelo es la vestia del boxeo mi respeto para el canelo
Wow excelente ✌👌😍💪👍😁😘😘
Canelo is the real fighter😊
Porque Benito¡ y no Canelo
CANLOSER, IS A BIG DRUG CHEATER AND SILL CAN NOT BEAT KING MONEY MAYWEATHER, NOT EVEN IN IS DREAMES.
Plant looks funny standing there with his 1 belt 😂🤦🏾
Plant talks all that shit then gets dominated lmao what a joke nobody thought plant would win
Jesus you don’t shut up
Plant was very confident that night, he doesn’t know himself is playing with a lion
canelo didnt beat floyd so what can he do
why would people not like canelo
In boxing canelo has no match and kamaru usman wont even come close... So goes for the MMA.. canelo has no place in octagon against usman
Usman like to try!😂
BEST BOXERS  FIGHTING BEST BOXERS ..... IS BACK.    NO MORE GAYWEATHER TIME, DUCKING, RUNNING, PICKING, MASCOTTING, BANK ROBBING .
Camelot will never be better than Floyd
Boxing is doing great right now, best it's been since corrales castillo and young Pacquiao days.
Ligid pamore 😆
Floyd would lose
Viva México!
This guy describing the first two round and last few while the video shows totally different rounds
Canelo is going to achieve great heights in the future
Канелло легенда
Stop the trilogy talk.... Lets see him against Benavidez and Charlo
Canelo will defeat every man they put Infront of him
Educated
What highlights? Where? What minute? What was highlighted ? Was the knock out just the highlight?
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. 🎈
Plant……wigger……ridiculous…….respect to canelo🙏🏻👍🏻
Canelo is the best 👌
Canelo is a kickass beast man. Gotta hit god level to beat him 💪💪💪💪
It’s funny how everyone brings up the combo of RD 9 from Plant. Sure it landed but it was literally a shoe shine with nothing behind it.  I do love how Canelo used his stiff arm every time Plant would try to dip to the outside for control. He literally couldn’t throw anything back worth anything due to his positioning
2:16 Did eddy just hit canelo
Canelo is Supernatural! 🥊🥊
All to easy!!
Ref saved plants career.  Good fkn stoppage
Not gonna lie, Plant blocked and dodged a lot of those punches
Canelo turned plant into a plant....
Feels so good 😁😁😁😁😁
Why is there so many damn belts in boxing now
Canelo always gets punching bags on all his fights, Caleb is one of those
Le ponen a puro pichón al Canelo
¡VIVA MÉXICO! 🇲🇽💥🌟✨⚡🎆
Weak ass highlight reel
Who would want to see saunders vs plant?
Bro canelo is a beast just ran through the division he should be a middleweight again maybe a light middleweight and run through  the division
Eddy reynoso 🔥
And then Jake Paul comes into the room... *crickets* are heard from LA to Mexico
GGG is the only one on par with Canelo
no ggg
Caleb have skills but not Power to hurt canelo, canelo have skills and Power to hurt almost everybody.
Canelo  is great one of the best but lowkey i was pulling for Plant
i was married but got separated for 3years in my relationship, But After a spell consultation with Dr Wiseone? My relationship was restored.
Hmmmm Canelo has more beef with opponents recently....hmmmmm beef...BEEF 🍖 I wonder
GGG is too old for the Canelo now...
Lo más admirable de el Señor y campeón Caleb Plant es que el si dio pelea y no se dedicó a correr como otro invicto que prefirió retirarse invicto a darle la revancha al ahora Rey Cáñelo Álvarez. Bien dicen que el miedo no anda en burro y Floyd es un claro ejemplo!! Se tenía que decir y se dijo!!!
How wonderful, Canelo Alvarez, shutting up the mouths of the talkative gringos.
CANELO ALVAREZ 🥊 el orgullo de México 🇲🇽
As far as I see it rn it’s canelos time now
Al rato sale a pelear con su abuela  Como siempre le ponen peleadores q  no se sabe quien son Canelo is a clown
De tidos modos no lo queremos por güero jajaja.
enhanced by clenbuterol
I need that GGG rematch...
Bruh canelo is unbeatable
ggg trilogy but to get robbed a third time? no thanks
Loving that background music 🔥 good video
Who fights a plant...
GGG Triple G🥊🥊🥊🥊👑👑
Canelo vs Pacquaio would happen?
GGG Canelo @ 168 would be soo good
Please repent for your lord he will give you salvation and everlasting life in the kingdom he lives in for therefore nothing on this planet can replace what's in the kingdom of God he will save you from the sins you have committed and forgive you and restore your heart with his love and give you strength and happiness that you will never experience with things on earth WARNING! if you don't repent you will end up in hell a place where you don't want to be in no-man nor woman would ever want to experience such a place where you will be tortured for all eternity 🙏🏿❤
Triple G is too is only months away from 40! I think that ship has sailed, especially if you're asking him to move up - it's no longer a good fit...
All those who thought Duran was superior was superior to Canelo..and knocked out Saul don't know zilch about boxing..
Pan fo Pan
I love how all of Canelo's opponents talk shit and insult him and none of them back it up in the ring. Love to see Canelo kick their asses back to where they came from.
Where the highlights at bro a bunch of talking
Word is that canelos heavy bag has osmium inside and if hes able to punch a really heavy bag like he does i bet that when he hits his opponent their bodies feel like jello. Plus his blood type is AB positive (Aztec Blood)
Beating all bums. Floyd beat him up and was way past prime
1:30 Plant throws a 8 piece. Plant fans score card +8, everybody else has +2 haha
I must admit they're both great
Viva Mexico 💚🤍❤️
How the f..k did Floyd beat this guy
How did y’all have it scored?
Actual boxing from 1:20 to 2:10
Bible verse of the day to remember if you're feeling down: “The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.” ‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭40:8‬ ‭
Canelo is a TANK!
Canelo is not invincible but the fact someone like Caleb thought he could beat him is ridiculous. Tbh only reason Caleb lasted that long is because canelo let it happen and wanted to teach him a lesson. You should’ve seen canelos face at the end he looked barely scratched
I always said Canelo is the best pound by pound!!!
CANELO ALREADY GOAT!!
*CANELO'S POWER IN ACTION*
JUST A RANDOM GIRL LOST IN COMMENT SECTION 🔞🔞🔞
Who’s the dude at the end of the video w canelo holding all those belts?
If Canelo can do what Roy Jones JR did and move up a weight class and dominate it, he’ll easily solidify himself as the GOAT.
This was forgone conclusion
Yo people sleep on Canelo's hand speed my dude.  That hook was like a sling shot.
Would be nice to see him and Benavidez next
Some punches 🥊🥊
Both showed class at the end.....all's well that ends well.
What went wrong with  Plant? His unusual poor performance looks  suspicious.  Needs further investigation.
somebody get a flower pOt. we will need to plant mr. plant for he has been knocked off his stems! lol
Canelo is just unstoppable
Didn't mayweather squash this guy ?
All hail the legend King Canelo. Hell of a man, Hell of a fighter.
Canelo is slow trash and I lost all respect for his fighting skills when he lost to floyd.
Good
Him and tank has the same power
Gomovkin beats canelo
Canelo Alvarez needs to move up in weight class to get some more competition. He's on his way to GOAT territory.
I’m not a massive boxing nerd the only people I see as the greatest boxers I would say Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and looks like Canelo because he’s a god damn total badass
Canelo v Floyed will be 🤯
Crawford would dismantle Canelo
Es hora que canelo empieze a pelear con boxeadores de verdsd
God bless you Canelo❤🙏😀👍💪you are the best boxer!
Love how Canelos smiling on his walk out knowing he’s about to kick plants ass
Canelo is a BEAST!
What a beast canelo is, and respect to plant he lasted 11 rounds
I don’t wanna see no damn trilogy. We want charlo
You could tell plant was still kind of out of it when he was talking to canelo he probably don't even remember that s***
Wait,he’s Mexican??🤔things that make you go,hmmmm. Lol
boxing match-fixing sold out
Canelo  can now do wt Floyd did retire and say he’s the best
🔥🔥Davis Gervonta vs Canelo Álvarez 🔥🔥 Seria una verdadera pelea
If you know boxing then clearly you can tell plant took a dive for the 10mill
Lol the crown is so dumb
I mean who's next??? Benevidez shouldn't be fighting at 168 anymore, Charlo and Andrade are at 160. Id be shocked if Canelo moves up to 175, but it seems that's the only option...
People talking about how good plant did but forget that a dehydrated Danny Jacobs did way better than Plant and BJ combined... I wanna see that rematch at 168 forsure
Canelo is going to achieve great heights in the future he is in line to become the best mexican boxer to ever step in the ring. Its like his presence in the arena is a blessing
He's already the GREATEST Mexican fighter of all time ... lol .. Chavez Sr. fought bums ...  if you were to compare all 59 Canelo's fights ... they would top all of Chavez's fights
Que hermoso esta el canelo  muy bueno
Miky woodz 🤣
Plant fans??????👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎puro CANELO perrooooooosss!!!!
Canelo is breezing through a division with limited physical athletes. Some to lanky and flat footed, others with weak shots and to slow. No real complete fighter besides himself.
Plant will never be in the class of Canelo. He is like Mayweather; the type of boxer that pretends the hits from hard hitters like Canelo/Tyson don't hurt at all and think that all those cute, fancy arm jabs and shoulder shaking after a cute series of powder-puff jabs will be enough to intimidate top boxers like Canelo. It doesn't and didn't as he learned his lesson this night.  Canelo is a welterweight and he is boxing several weights above his normal class. That is why the current list of boxers he's faced are several inches taller and bigger than him. More credit to Canelo for boxing and winning in different weight classes.
Collecting the belts akin to thanos collecting the infinity gems.
I AM LOVING THE BURGER KING METALLIC CROWN !!!
Whear is the Ko ?? , it´s same stupid history as Kovalev
Dude is a beast, but just imagine how good Mayweather was to make him look like a amateur at that time. Passed the torch.
Respect to Caleb he actually showed more grit than BJS and Celeb’s chin was tested. Not too bad Caleb. But at the end of the day Canelo is Canelo and he did what he had to do!  Nobody stops Canelo anytime soon. This man fought several times in the span of 11 months! Who else has the cojones and passion like him right now??? Canelo will sit on his thrown for a long time.  Viva Mexico mofos!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️♥️ 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
GGG el único que le ha ganado clarsmente a canelo sobre el ring aparte del Correcaminos
UFC has surpassed boxing. Weak champions that talk their way out of tough fights. Over hyped champions that benefit from a corrupt organization.*yawn*
Prime canelo vs prime mayweather who would win?
Canelo es un dios en el ring mis respetos desde Puerto Rico 🇵🇷
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
damn canelo is only 31
GGG💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
First of all I don’t see how any of you say canelo won any of the first 5 rounds
I wanna see triple ggg come up to 168 for a trilogy.
Canelo is s beast!!!!!!period
Canelo never fights anybody
*Siendo argentino es un orgullo tener un representante latinoamericano en tan alto nivel boxistico* Gracias Canelo , gracias Mexico!
Stupid clickbait, thumb down!
1:31 “wtf did he just try to do”
That big ass neck on Canelo is what gives him that fkg titanium chin. His neck is as large as his head 😭😭💀
I can knock Canelo out..like it was nothing 😁
I can’t stop watching Canelo knocking him down 2
You can tell by Canelo's body language at the weigh in, he meant business, he wanted to hurt that man.  On anotha note, come on son, Canelo has a track record that is undisputed!!  Plant was hot but you have to respect Canelo's gangsta!
If not for Mayweather people would really think that Canelo is unbeatable.
I knew plant had no chance against the beast
GGG IS IRRELEVANT AT  THIS POINT. 🤦🏽
Yung iba hindi nakaka intindi ng boxing 🤣 alam niyo kung bakit tinatalo ni canelo mga undefeated ngayon? Bakit? Kasi pinapalakas niya sa training mga kamay niya at braso pati paa at stamina. Ngayon ang game plan ni canelo is kapag yung kalaban niya sa ring is e ba block mga suntok niya e babali-an niya gamit yung power punches niya hanggang sa bumagal at humina at mag quit or e TKO niya. Yan ang nangyari kay Plant 11th round TKO. King Canelo 👑🤴🦁 uses "Ultra Instinct"
Just imagine if Boxing wasn’t corrupt. GGG would be standing there with all the belts
if "Shouldn't have been  talkin Shit" was a person hahahah
Que pelee con Carlitos Colon para que Canelo pruebe la crema. Carlitos Colon ha sido 3,438,988,584,499 veces campeón universal...dime quien puede contra el?
My opinion from a Canelo fan GGG both the matches were very close should of been both a tie
Canelo is the biggest name in Mexico all respect to Chavez but he was never a worldwide name, mostly just in Mexico.
Man .. Canelo vs Floyd in their prime would have been awesome 2 Legends So much respect
GGG trilogy would be the war we all want to see for the 3rd time!
Great highlights, very nice quality, thank you MMA weekly. Wait.. is this boxing or MMA? lolz
Next opponent John Ryder 🤣
Ggg vs canelo.
tripple G for the 3rd time! I love Canelo!
💰🇺🇸🤝🇲🇽💰. Canelo Mayweathers Álvarez.
I wonder what the average age of commenters here is. Sounds like a bunch of teenagers who don't understand boxing,
He’s already the best Mexican boxer of al time Chavez wouldn’t last with Canelos opponents or move up like he’s done. Whoever disagrees must love watching tomato cans getting crushed by Chavez lol you clowns. Chávez was a disgrace once he faced top opponents. Look at De la Hoya and don’t say he was on a decline was he was the around the same age Canelo is rn. Canelo would destroy Chávez inside 3 rounds
Jake Paul next?? 😂😂
Eso se llama paliza, como a chola de paco, el asesino Canelo...
Reporter: Canelo’s beaten everyone in his path. Mayweather: Am I a figment of your imagination?
Canelo vs benavidez
ONLY BUSINESSES. !  PURO NEGOCIO !   PURE PIECE OF CAKE FOR CANELO.        EASY FIGHTS    FOR CANELO ALVAREZ.
Caleb listo pa los chingasos listo pa los chingasos lmao 😂😂💀🖕
1:33 😆
He gave Ls to all the champions that were holding those belts in less then a year that’s wild all of them were undefeated
Highlights with more talk and less action clip🤣
Canelo has already surpassed and is far better than Chavez ever was.
Next a benavides
Looks like that tainted Mexican meat really paid off!
Canelo P4P MONSTER
Caín Velásquez vs canelo
One of the worlds greatest pound for pound fighters of all time .
That looked like sparring for canelo
Those steroids is the reason he doesn't like caleb. Truth ain't going to stay a secret.
Just as Canelo said..."Yu ar in trobol mai fren".
Mayweather vs canelo
@2:11 My god one could only imagine the surge of every fucking good neurotransmitter firing at once. Must be impossible to sleep after this high.
Canelo haters: Yea he ain't fought Thanos yet so he aint that great
Canelo: hold one of these many belts please..
Congratz Canelo.
Para mi será recordado como el gran fraude del boxeo y no es su culpa si no de la gente que lo vende como el gran boxeador que no lo es .
El boxeo está en decadencia o esta lleno de corrupción si esto es lo mejor que tienen que ofrecer .
3 words I got to say about Canelo‘s legacy:  Floyd Money Mayweather
Ggg trilogy just feels right rn .
I'm british but I love this guy .. he's a weapon and boy he goes off well
pilipino is the mexican of asia.
This aint highlights, fk this channel
I think Mayweather style will not beat canelo right now I think GGG style will beat canelo right now
Canelo fez Plnat parecer um amador kkkkk
Boxing today is a joke....watching lambs being feed to wolves over and over again gets boring
Where is the sportsmanship? Geez, I swear all these fighters act like children
The best part at the end was they hopefully squashed the beef ...
Had to drop a dislike cuz its actually dumb that you tried to COMMENTATE a highlights video. Just play the highlights. You'd get way more views and less hate.
It breaks my heart we will never see prime conelo v prime mayweather. Don't even say whi would win for sure because we just don't know. It would be fkin epic that's for sure. 🥲
I SWEAR once a paisa learns English....
This version of Canelo kills prime Floyd.
Brah no boxer alive can beat Canelo.
Canelo vs Usyk dream match in cruiserweight!
Mexican bread to be a warrior while a white American boy bread to talk big!
Wooooo! Canelo is a beast man, one of the greatest fighters in the world
Canelo= Universum Boxer Level  Plant= Afrika Boxer Level
Dendam canelo pun trbalaskan!!  Stelah sebelumnya caleb plantong menghina ibu canello
You only need to see Canelos head movement to tell he is a hell of a boxer.
Anyway Usyk  the best
Puro Canelo!!!🙌🏽✊🏽 Plant Got Planted!!!
Floyd vs canelo would probably happened if Floyd runs out of money 😂
I love the sportsmanship
Stay humble
Na ggg na charlo or benavidez
2:16 why his coach gotta give him more head damage
Canelo got angry Cause Plant disrespected Canelos Mom.  Goodnight  Plant lol
Plant did the famous Forman vs Fraiser turn around back bunny hop hit @ the end... LOL.
JoD oR WHoT⚕️💠✨💥❣️
Canelo is a god.
Amazing Canelo alvarez
Canelo used the mike Tyson peekaboo and he did said he wanted to be like Mike!!!
so all belts are on the line? did i get it right?
Are people still gonna talk shit about canelo after this?
Canelo is running out of space for all those belts
Caleb! CALEB! ARE YOU OK?? WHAT YEAR IS IT??
*I know ONE Opponent Canelo could NEVER beat.......and that opponent is USADA.*
21wins only 12 KO . And u got balls to be an arrogant to canelo hahaha oh cmon
2:15 lmfao he slaps canelo on the back of the head 💀
Canelo has reached Super Saiyan 3 level now.
This shit was wack lol Man UFC was way better 😂
Next GGG
I'd hate for GGG to get finished after getting robbed twice
Canelo yg santun rendah hati.. A love full.. Canelo.. From. Indonesia
Amazing how Canelo still hitting so strongly at the 11th round!
What about David Benevedz?
Caleb is a great fighter with a big heart, he is gonna be big one day but cant beat the goat of the division.
So lets make canelo vs ggg 3
Mexico is undefeated 💯
🐐
La 2 con tripol G se la regalaron  al mexicano , todo está arreglado Con sus luces y música mexicana , es pura mafia
Right now there’s really no one at Canelo  level. But a match with charlo would be nice to watch
GGG
Rematch mayweather 🙏🏽
First ever boxer to unified all titles at super middle weight Get your info correct mma fanboy
All that talk to look stupid
Ohhhh..that look and embrace from both guys..how romantic...they lovers now?
What a stupid video talks about the rounds and shows video of a different round.
Nadie puede contra la furia Mexa. Es todo Canelo, partiendo madres a gringitos habladores.
Very good canelo u got the respect.
I wanna see him clean out 160 and shut up charlo, booboo, and GGG or Murata
I look up the highlights to watch them and it's a vid of this fool talking about them why would I want to hear him talk about them and not see the highlights myself, I hate b that  ppl make money by posting shit like this he didn't make anything or add anything at all just stealing others hard work
GOATED
Canelo v GGG 3
Plant was better than I expected, his defence, movement and counter punch was really good but Canelo is a different beast.
2:15 now it makes sense why all the 3 judges gave it to canelo . Let's see how do Canelo haters  respond to this lmao
When karma hits hahaa
Beat and humble that big mouth plant
Rip to all the plant fans that said plant would come out victorious
Plant got up in there
Would live to see ****** CANELO VS USYK @175LBS  LETS GO!!!!
Finally short simple and to the point  highlights!!!! Great contect dont like him but respect
Current Canelo vs prime Mayweather 🔥
He might be a beast, and a great champion, but he will always have that 1 loss 🥺🥺
He’s already the greatest boxer Of All Time
Got his ass kicked 😂😂
Mayweather will forever live rent-free in Canelo's head.
Lets be real, 3G won both fights. Not a GGG fan.
the more he wins, the more Floyd Mayweather get credited as the better fighter
if you are looking for the best face beterbiev !!!
Congrats to Canelo But the amount of disrespect his fanboys show to Plant is pathetic .
As expected haha
"you're not on my level, you'll feel something different" This cabron backs whatever the F he says. The best cat in the business. Caleb is legit boxer, but as Benavidez said, he is not strong.
And histroy has been made, Canelo certified GOAT
If canelo is as good as people says, why he chills when somebody says Golovkin? Canelo will never be on the top 10 of Mexican boxers. His rivals are always weaker than him.
Simply not impressed☝🏾
More fake than WWE so sad to see what boxing has become
Imagine a lamb getting lippy to a lion that's how canelo was feeling 😆
Triple G is wayyy past his prime now. He’s no where near the fighter he was when Canelo and him first fought.
Bro even full white Americans were going for Alvarez
Idk plant looks like hes going to come back harder. Probably the best timing in his  career to have a loss. To a Prime Canelo. While still at the blooming of your own.
2:15 did anyone see canelo get smack?😂
Plant tried to play like mayweather but canelo just perfectly has too much power
how the hell can you say Canelo did enough work in the 1st to in the round. He did absolutely nothing in the first round. It was the clarest and easiest round to score for plant. I know what site I aint subscribing to.
1:58 that little jog canelo does lol
the bum has been planted
Me caga el canelo , la neta yo le iba al gringo . Pero ni pedo ganó el mejor y aunque me caga es el mejor.
I full heartedly believe Canelo will be the best Mexican boxer and top 5 of all time , he’s only 31 and he got 4 fucking belts
Floyd better
Beat the brakes off plants ass 💪
I would be down for canelo vs ggg lll.
Canelo is a real champion from the beginning people wanted to say he wouldn’t make it look it him now after hard work and determination he got it done the sixth undisputed champion in the whole boxing history the first Mexican there’s so many great amazing accomplishments
Floyd maywher  is canleo rematch In roio
Checo Perez took the headlines here in Mexico!!
Hats off to the champ. Plant ran of gas and he was waiting for that. Only Mayweather can out box Canelo.
Man Canelo is such a beast. Honestly, I never used to be a fan of Canelo, let’s say up until ggg fights. After that, Canelo had been my favorite man. Definitely p4p right now. Will go down as one of the greatest imo.
Man if he gets a rematch with floyd, canelo will destroy him without a problem ! Never liked floyds style tbh
But can he beat Goku tho
game is rigged
Nobody today can stop Canelo ,that belt was always going to be his , Americans talked up plant so much plant thought he stood a chance, SMH, Billy Joe had the greatest chance of stopping Canelo but Canelo's stars had a different path for him,True greatness
that was so funny when Canelo's translater didn't wanna translate what he said at the end 🤣
Canelo beat the brakes of Mr Balla, Hip Hop tough-talking Thug Plant. Caleb is now meek as a 🐈 and eating Humble 🥧. Caleb got Planted. 😂
Lindering money for mencho, paying fighters so they Drop at some point, paying loads of cartel money so he can Win all fights and lundering money for papa mencho and its cartel cjng...
Still a drug cheat
Dude, don't need your commentary
The real from the FAKE! Ya dig
he should have his purse reduced by 50% for those pants
King Canelo💪
Fury would demolish him
GGG has never fought outside of middleweight, he's not going to try now. Canelo will end his career.
NHÌN GIỐNG ROANALDO THẾ
I don’t get what the big deal is, you just gotta hit him really hard to win, I mean how hard can this be?
It was plants destiny remember
Charlo not ready
Canelo still lost to maywheather
Plant got robbed
Errol Spence would beat tf out Canelo
Viva México cabrones.
La pelea estuvo pareja hasta que comenzó.
Canelo looks like a boxer on PEDs.   Look at his body habitus 6 yrs ago and compare to now.  Only he knows for sure.....b/c no one is checking.
I wonder where Andre ward was hiding  the whole night , I remember  he said plant was gonna stop canelo ha ha ha
give credit to plant for surviving 11 rounds... a lot of people weren't expecting that.
Andre Ward would still beat him easily
Beautiful performance
Don’t talk plz
DAVID BENAVIDEZ ES SUPERIOR"""
Lmao Andy Ruiz standing out like a sore thumb
I thought Canelo already is the greatest Mexican fighter of all time.
He's still a weird goofy little thing
Canelo will be 9_ division cham
Canelo never won a match since he was caught cheating. No respect
Canelo. Respect and love from Sweden ⚘
Woooooooo..🥶
He is the goat without doubt. what a fighter.
Plant lasted a long time honestly
CANELO VS GODZILLA !!.
I'm not familiar with Julio Chavez Sr, I think Canelo is the best all time greatest Mexican boxer. He almost unstoppable. Is Triple G Mexican? He's another elite boxer. I really want to see Triple G and Canelo. Crawford, Triple G, Canelo. Canelo, Mayweather's protege :) Goooooo Canelo. Huge congrats.
Whatever canelo can't beat Goku!
Don’t talk foo just play the highlights no one wants to hear you
Highlights-_-
Dude stop babbling and just show the highlights.
ryan garcia should retire boxing n start doing tiktok n youtube
Para cuando un connor vs canelo??
Is this wwe now or a movie show?
Worts highlights video I ever seen
Buen video
Not even a miracle could of saved plant from defeat
The jackets him and his trainer are wearing show that you can't buy taste.  That being said, he is a great boxer and one I enjoy watching.
Never seen Canelo so tired. Took him to the depths of hell.
Hes old and slow now
Ggg is 40 now
Pass the great Chavez not gonna happen!
Y ASÍ ES COMO YOU BECOME A LEGEND!!! Amen 🙏
Benevidaz wants that fade 🇲🇽 🇺🇸 🥊
nobody beating him right now
They always have to mention Mayweather don't they?
Infelizmente está muito tarde para GGG vs Alvarez.  Esportivamente falando.
Roids. Roids. ROIDS.
Steroid cheat
Most of him don’t like him the more he wins the greater Floyd becomes
I love how all of Canelo's opponents talk shit and insult him and none of them back it up in the ring. Love to see Canelo kick their asses back to where they came from.
Love canelo great fighter but he needs to step up to Charllo.
Id be so embarrassed
👊🏻
Canelo is a beast! He hits harder than a mule. He's got a chin like a Nokia 3310. Unbelievable. 🤫
Lmao
How is this a highlight vid
It's crazy how someone can be as fast as he is
I wanna see next canelo vs Charlo or benavidez 💯🙏 then beterbiev or bivol
Think plant owes Mike Tyson an apology for calling it like it is.
He shouldnt have beaten tripleG though
All Canelo haters: " he  ducking Benavidez, Charlo, Tyson Fury, Goku, Frieza,  Mike Tyson and Jesus"
Always good to see someone get their mouth shut
3G has got to get past Murata in December. Normally I would be like GGG is gonna win comfortably, but he’s getting up there in age and Murata is showing a resurgence. I think folks maybe surprised how close GGG and Murata can actually be
Canelo had a game plan and it was not to outbox plant and he did it
160-168 is lacking talent!!!!  Boxers seem to be avoiding each other so much in the last couple years, do you think the industry is also blocks talent from becoming relevant so their fighters have less competition and making them the most money?
Peleándo en una división de puro muertos. Bien hecho.  Quiere a cGGG, más viejo 😂
Wtf this ain't no highlights just say story time next time
You talked about round 1 then round 11?
ESTE MEQUETREFE MAFIOSO DE CANELO, QUE ELUDE A BOXEADORES ENORMES Y MUY PELIGROSOS, A ESTE MAFIOSO CANELO QUE ESCOGE A SUS RIVALES, EXCEPTUANDO DOS O TRES EN TODA SU CARRERA,  EL RESTO: DESCARADAMENTE SIN EXPERIENCIA, SIN PELIGRO DE KO, SIN NIVEL O PELEANDO CON VIEJOS, PERO ESO SI! HACIENDO SONAR TROMPETAS DE VICTORIA A TRAVES DE LOS CRETINOS "PERIODISTAS" UNOS QUE SOLO SIGUEN LA COMPARSA Y OTROS PAGADOS PARA ALABARLO Y HACER CREER QUE SE TRATA DE TRIUNFOS HISTORICOS!! NADA MAS LEJANO DE LA VERDAD * SORPRENDE QUE LE HAYA GANADO A CALEB PLANT? (UN ILUSTRE DESCONOCIDO), POR FAVOR!.
Canelo Alvarez what a champion,best super middleweight ever to dance on the canvas,no one is good enough to beat this awesome athlete, well done Canelo,😁👍👍👍
Where is Jake mouth now
Jake Paul: "Canelo your next" 😂
