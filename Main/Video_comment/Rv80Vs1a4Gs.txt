Girls in anime are for clapping if they are not the main protagonist.
Ngl ryuga was my fav I loved l drago evolution the most
Lowkey tho ryuga can beat every villain tbh
Put Ryuga on the Crashout hall of fame next to Sukuna, Kid Buu, Z Broly Madara and Doflamingo
His name is pronounced Reeyooga. Not Rai yooga.
7:57 them the mfs from baki during the pickle arc
Does anyone remember the OG first beyblade show?
Nah darkness lost ryuga still was the champion
He ain’t a goat. More like slop.
ryuga was a great warcriminal but a trash blade. my boy tyson could smash him into quarters without a bitbeast.
Bro needs to continue Ryuga’s dominance in Metal Masters
To be in the front row seat of a Beyblade Tournament you need to wear the suit from the Hurst Locker.
09.39 damians violation of julian is the worst violation actually
Who’s a better aura farmer, piccolo, sung Jin woo, mercenary Tao, or the goat ryuga
As someone who used to watch the show as a kid, I did not like Ryuga, so seeing him get defeated by Gingka felt satisfying. 😌
10:35 ref where my mfn call stop ts ref please
It.   Is.    Ethan.    Wats.   Up
Man was flexing that custom made Ap 😂😂 shii
Throughout all my life watching Beyblade and we watching the series back-and-forth, I never knew their age and finding out that Ryuga was just 14 years old doing this shit
We can’t forget about Damian with Hades Kerbecs. He was a menace. 🤣💯
11:51😂💀❗️ryuga crashout so funny
4:41😂💀
I haven’t even seen bayblade and you have me convinced this guys the goat
Would Ryuga solo Takao, Gingka and gangan galaxy, Valt, Aiga, Omega shiroboshi and Team persona? Or would he get his ass whooped?
Apex legend music is wild
10:08 - 10:45 I genuinely feel bad for Hikaru. He didn't have to do her like that man, she didn't deserve this. He crushed her soul, her dreams, and her mental state. Literally beat the dreams outta this poor girl. This is arguably worse than being sent to the shadow realm.
Please do Raoh from HNK
Moses parting the red sea with a beyblade is my new personal head canon
Please do a kai video too
1:03 we must be getting a kenpachi video still
God if this series came back with more life than ever before
This is ryuga speaking send me em matches boi
Bro “checkmate nig” got me laughing😂
6:45 they're just bent backwards 😭
Bro lose becouse of MCs plot armour
glaze me
According to this show, Jesus died for our spins.
Im confident Moses let it rip to part the sea.
Not to disrespect ryuga but I wish the real OG beyblad was talked about more the final fight Tyson Vs Kai was ridiculous xD
Woah woah. How is Slade only at an A? Man was a menace. Alright well how about doing comic book Deathstroke. It would take reading or watching some videos but it would be worth it. Deathstroke was a monster in the comics. I suggest checking out his solo runs and initial run involving the teen titans.
Hell fuckin yes
Anyone feel like seeing this man do a deep dive for Spectra from “Bakugan”? I think he’d fit in just right here.
I know he said it was a Galic Gun, but we aren't gonna stand here and ignore that Ryuga pulled off a Final Kamehameha before Vegito could
4:46 naw he sukk sukkin 😂
I already knew this...
To be fair his bey drives off of negative emotions so positive emotions would be a counter to it such as the power of friendship
"Naw im sayin tho-"
I said this before and Imma say it again plot armor or not ryuga's first lost it was bound to happen.
9:08 13:17 The six best bladers throughtout the Beyblade series' in my opinion are 1ST Aiger Akabane 2ND Ryuga Kishatu 3RD Gingka Hagane 4TH Valt Aoi 5TH Phi BBT 6TH Alexander Shakadera then it's 7TH Free De La Hoya 8TH Shu Kurenai 9TH Lui Shirosagi 10TH Xavier Bogard or Kristina Kuroda
Kyoya got the ace treatment
Election Day needs to be a national holiday then and a Federal law passed that requires employers to give a couple hours to go vote.
How is no1 talking ab how good cj's Ryuga voice is??
Season 1: I HATE RYUGA! Season 2: This dude is a Badass Season 3: Ryuga is a GOAT 🐐
Ryuga does the Big Bang Kamehameha that Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta used to end Dragon Ball GT.Thats how goated he is. Two hands charged up into one beam.
CJ reckon we can get a white flag table? A table of anime characters that got their assess kicked the worst Like season one Baki, Krillin, etc....
How did I get this after a year!?!?!?!
I need an accelerator trial from a certain magical index and railgun
We need ldrago and ryuga in a blade blade metal fusion reboot
Ryuga💯💪
gingka : What did you say Nigga got me 🤣
What's the music name for 17:09
Ryuga is the only person where holding an L is actually a good thing.
2:04 HOLD ON MOSES WAS IN BAYBLADE??
Nahhh I still have lightning L-drago and a rubber destructor L-drago somewhere around my house.   Earth Eagle the GOAT 🗣️🔥🔥
do genghis khan
Funniest shit I've watched 😂😂😂
Mamba Mentality 😂 love it!
WHERE IS KENPACHI ZARAKI
Pegasus absorb hope did you not no that
I still think keyoya deserved that win against him, since the person that beat him was the dark power, not ryuga. But ya after the second season, ryuga was the strongest.
what I love about the Beyblade anime is that the tops are shown as weapons of mass destruction
I find it funny that Moses’ staff is a bey launcher 😭
1:54 Nigga said Genghis kong 😂😂😂
"Dark Move Dragon Emperor Soaring bite strike!"
Wait til he finds out about phi
5:51  Ldrago: hold my wine
I like lighting Ldrago kinda wish i had  the bayblade just think of the wonder what this  little spining top can do if you can control its raw power if you had the willpower
RYUGOAT
But can he beat Chuck Norris?
Can you go to beyblade burst they got like three characters that should be judged for there spot in the table
Wait till he sees the Bakugan villains
Ngl bro needs to make a video about shu aiger and free or phi and hades cuz they were also beyblade crash outs fr
this is beta as fuck
It's amazing how I still find Ryuga's voice more hilarious than terrifying! I laugh my ass off every time he says "You're being COWARDLY!" 🤣At least he's got the skills to back him up!
I still wish Hikaru got her getback and became a great Beyblader again. Maybe as an adult Beyblader, proving that adults and even the elderly can have awesome Beyblade adventures.
Beyblade plastic gen and burst were more grounded METAL IS STRAIGHT UP MENACE

I literally still remember ryuya clapping both ginja n kyoya the 2 tuffest niggas in the whole damn show like it was nothing
The first 10 seconds already made me laugh so bad😂
I watched this show in Dutch language and I cannot believe that in dutch language, he shares the same voice as Boots the monkey from dora the explorers.
Kai better, fight me.
Ryuga is Him no doubt.🤌🏼🔥
6:15 Not Jiren’s theme from DBS😂
"Checkmate N****!" Best line 4 the Beyblade haters I've heard yet 😂❤♟🧩
Having dreidels fight is not that serious 🥀🥀🥀
I don't wanna be that "uhm acktually🤓☝️" guy but, if a bet spins counterclockwise, then it moves clockwise in the stadium. 4:31
Plus he voice by Kabia from Yu-Gi-Oh! in the Japanese dub. I guess this is why he likes dragons.
🙄 G.O.A.T? More like thieving cheating ass 😂
if MFB got rebooted, you'd absolutely rock the roles of Doji and Ryuga
11:30 Nappa dodge!!!
15:20 name of the scream I love it so much❤❤❤❤
aura farmer before jinwoo
I have l drago and it’s got some bodies💀
Thanks for uploading about ryuga
What I don't understand is how do you see that shit and not walk out of the stadium? Like ya'll want the fucking doomslayer to be your opponent? Doesn't matter how good you are I'd be running out of there, good day sir. They're really preparedd to loose their dignity and body parts over being the best top spinner.
He lame
Ryuga is so powerful that it took a god to beat him…………….let that sink in
0:43 isn't he 6'2??
😂😂😂😂😂 bro beyblade is my childhood back in those days ❤❤😅😅
Tatum better start tapping into that “Inner Mamba” more! New York, tryna feel success!
Ryuga gave Hikaru the 4kids equivalent to videl treatment
I don’t think I realized how much of this video just uses sonic riders zero gravity music
Gametheorist i saw youuu
Wait that guy from the training rejement give this man mutilation+1?
🐐🐐🐐
Actually when libra used inferno blast Madoka took that into the face also ryuga=booty warrior
By the way in the manga Stinkmeiner I mean ryuga is the reincarnation of the first Chinese emperor to wield ryuga
In the manga he's like a 150 year old slumbering god/demon/dragon emperor of some kind that was woken up by Doji js to cause chaos. Or sum like that.
Mind u Ryuga is 12
Fraud
9:23 Bro, his own demons are fighting him in his body. They be, like "LET ME OUT!" xD
Man post so inconsistent but videos to good he has 2 mil sub been watchen since 200k I think?? but damn you got blayblade trama
When is the Masquerade or Spectra video coming?
should do spectra from bakugan
Ref do something 10:33
Bro beyblade metal fusion is my favorite anime series ❤😮😮
0:20 intro to the ryuga trials  1:13 exhibit a : the emperors wrath  17:43 final results for part 1  Score : 161
Ryuga can't catch these hands though.
“WHOOP THAT TRICK!”
Ryuga owns the vamp anthem
I still have my dark wolf, and i still love it all this year's.
How much do they have to charge for tickets to make it with having him there! M
Bruh i ran into this channel yesterday n aint stopped watching it lmao
4:11 I recognize that sound from somewhere but I don’t remember where
as much as i love cj this video did irreparable damage to the beyblade community 💔💔
The battle with Hikaru was so bad that she retired from beyblading😭😭😭
The voice-overs of the characters and editing is sooo good and funny lmfao 😂
It seems like Ryuga could give the Ginger from Letterkenny a run for his money, and he fucked an ostrich… *ALLEGEDLY!!!!!!!!!*
This is lit🔥🔥 even tho I’m 1 year late
Iove your impersonations of the characters 😭🔥
Yeah, but somebody had to stop this man.Somebody gotta stop that man you know
7:57 We got Brad West and AJ Topper at home
Whats crazy is that this is a kids show💀💀💀💀
Can yall imagine if bay blades wasn’t about spinning tops and was just straight hands, or chakra, or super power type shit. God knows how dangerous this man would be if he was a Saiyan.
8:00 The Undisputed bit killed me💀💀💀💀
That negga was the goat
The Benkei Voice made me drop to the floor XD
R.I.P Ryuga
Dear god Ryuga is insane. It's just a game about spinning tops I assure you it's not that serious dawg!
In this universe, they prob. Killed jfk eith a beyblade.
Ayo when the Guts from berserk trial comin? PS: great ass video man no cap all love brotha.
Did my man say ghengis Kong is is it just me that heard it 😅
This is still beyblade right
Man i love this video and beyblade and ryuga especially
Made Hakaru a siiiiiide character
3:37 Piccolo levels of aura farming😭🙏
The goat
6:45-6:47 I don't think you're supposed to close-up on these scenes. Also, his leg is right there.
Thank you black jesus in that verse for creating beyblades   They better digimon and pokemon   Fight me   Cause i will let it rip  Ryugua is a menace
http://youtube.com/post/Ugkx-BdJ3-301hb6ubEXqF-NZYcnYLUwA2-J?si=Sg6Zp--txp7JHXNh
The mandatory requirements that the hero always wins pulled some balderdash with the MC in the end against the goat. Scriptwriters pulling nonsense out of the ether, one after another.
I aint here for ryuga no more. Bro u're sooo hilarious. 😂😂😂
Well I think Kyoya and Ryuga were at least 15 or 16. 13:16 Lightning L-Drago: The original booty warrior!!!! 15:07
1:28 ok relax cj dachamp mr.crabs is not so greedy he some redeeming qualities with his greed
Ryuga is so powerful & i like his L-Drago but my favourite one is Tyson the greatest & the hero of Beyblade original series. Dragoon is the strongest among 4 sacred bitbeasts & only bitbeasts who talked with its owner Tyson 👑🔥
Both Ryuga and Z Broly lost to complete plot armor
Ryuga ran so that Lui Shirosagi could run a little slower
Ryuga is just Gilgamesh from Fate.  The Arrogance screams Black Air Force Energy
The boi walked through this season like a catastrophe, but the next one is where he literally goes and just says "F*** IT, I AM BECOME DEATH"  Man, what he does to that city with its infinite motion bs, and how he literally has to DRAG Gingka through the hard parts to get his arse to do any kinda work, friggin bum.    Think I like the upcoming version of Ryuga better than the murderhobo one though.
How about doing Paul from the Pokémon anime
Everyone says he's HIM. Yet, dude used a tournament banned bey and no one batted an eye. Bet you all a thousand bucks he'd be a regular asshole without said demon bey.
You should do red eye next
9:48 Fun Fact……. CJ was the announcer
I Dont remeber bakugan at all but I remember some weird evil shit going on if u haven’t already done bakugan lol
2:59 5:38 6:07 6:21 13:58
Ryugo only lost to L drago and nemesis
Nah idc ryuga wins cuz its a 1v4 and thats interference the writers jus glazing
I will never understand how people even pay for the tickets to these matches - with their kids???
lui should be next ngl
what is beyblade even about now😭🙏
This was my childhood but i didnt fucking remenber ryuga was this better than ginka
Ryuga’s a goat and all, but damn did Free and Lui had way more black air force energy
Don't forget that Ryuga was about 15 in metal Fusion. He was even younger during Gingka's flashbacks. He was probably only 16 when he died.
You should do leosherosagie
Why is he saying RA-YUGA instead of REE - YUGA 😭😭😭😭 It's hurting my soul
Just love that this man is such a damn menace, he blew the stadium four separate times.
I love how many people watched this video, although the series is not even in trend anymore. It was my fckn childhood.
i hope people realize that  161 is just what we saw on the screen......think about that
Fun fact Ryuga has a 100% win rate in season 2
My Meteo L Drago is still undefeated!
U NEED TO DO THE WHOLE LEGACY OF RYUGA NOT JUST SEASON 1 MY MAN!
1.) ShoutsOut to RDC for the voiceover @ 4:41 😂💀😂💀  2.) 8:10 is a combo called: "The DuPort Vybe"😂😂
Is it just me, or is Ryuga hot in some moments. Lmao. I ain’t gay, but like…
Ryuga is the BeyBlade version of Yami Marik 😂
The Chad himself.
6:21 what song is the background here
Yo CJ I’m not sure if you know/ knew this but Ryuga for Battle Bladers he got his points last minute. Because Battle Bladers was supposed to be a build up for Gingka and his friends. If he got his point while the cart were they’d have no chance. Just another flex and at least a point idk
Ryuga might be the only anime rival to actually beat the main character twice and the main character never beating him.
5:03 thats violation 💀
2:09 this part is funny idk why.
The part I saw at 6:21 gives me a certain vibe of: CAN YOU STILL STAND?! CUZ I'M NOT FINISHED YET BRING IT ON!And When I saw the part at 12:44 it honestly looked like ryuga was controlling the dragons like they're a puppet on strings. And When I saw the scene at 13:23 to 13:24 to13:25, it looked like L-Drago came out of the shadows and was about to swallow ryuga in whole! Not to mention when I saw the scene at 13:28 where he said: play time's over! That part gets me every time! But when he said: SIT DOWN PORKY THE PIG! at 14:06, That had me going. 😂 And I love that at 15:44 how's CJ said them boys like they're friends even though they're not! And the part at 16:41: it gives you the vibe of: Your worst nightmare is close to eliminating you on the spot. BUT YOU AIN'T DYING HERE! COME ON GET UP!
"Ghengis Kong" 🤣🤣🤣
Anyone here in 2025 watching this wondering how CJ topping this and future how did he kick it off better or worse?
Hearing Raiyuga over and over and I still managed to laugh. CJ is just that damn funny
Nice
Bro u gotta do this but for beyblade burst they be going off I promise you😂
Burst would make him 7
6:45  Bro didn't have an arm but he definitely had his foot. And don't say that was his pants. That was his foot at a horrid angle. So no matter what he's loosing that foot because ain't no way bro has an intact and savable foot after getting boomed like that.
Ryuga got ROBBED in that last battle, L-Drago taking over and getting pissed off about this Team Seven Naruto BS is respectable to every counting degree, I would be pissed if my opponent started beating me with the power of friendship and teamwork, like WHAT? Nah, stop jumping and run the ones
4:41 😂
I need a Kyoya vid dude
9:21 What is the name of this song/theme
Ryuga is the Storm that is approaching 👿. Before Vergil he was my motivation.  Ryuga, rengoku, Vegeta, Vergil, Prince zuko and ryujino
Could u do ninja kamui
During ryuga's final moment, he spoke.. "Kenta-kun, atoha tanomimasu"
Bro earned my sub for this one. This shit is hilarious!
Bro beyblade is not that serious the first time i watched beyblade I thought it was just going to be spinning tops just hitting and bursting not people getting ended
Ryuga’s social media would totally be Tiktok and Twitter because he GREW his influence from negativity and rage bait… And loves blowing shit up. Does anyone remember that creepy ship between Ryuga and Hikaru? Dude literally gave her PTSD Wtf 😭 I love that you used “goat noises” when he’s the GOAT. That’s a joke I was hoping more people would make just because. Imagine if you voiced Ryuga instead of Melville 😂
This man got better voice acting than the actual show😭
6:10 “Don’t know who that guy was but damn he got COOKED” someone save his ankles😭😭😭😭”
5:05 WHAT DID YOU SAY NIGGA????
11:38 bro pulled a madara 😂
where did you get all the anime footage in such good quality bro
Let's get something right my boy ginga and Pegasus has over 200 bodies
Ryuga was my favorite character. I shed a tear when he died :(
Those  videos are so good 😂 I forgot the like
Ryuga should been the main character not that sissy ginga
I love his character as kid he is my hero Ldrago is my fav bey ❤
And kyoyahahah….. GYAHHHH AHHH AHHH AHHHH
rYUGA WAS USING GALICK GUN LEFT AND RIGHT NPOBDY WASSAFE
Absolutely LOVE your intro song. CJ, you're the undisputed GOAT
I named a dog after this mf, thats how much aura he has.
The meat riding is crazy
You are the one who will see the dark pit, the only one who is allowed the name of the most powerful is this Dragon Emperor, remember that!
This is most I laughed in years... I am on the floor 😂
I always wonder what if Ryuga from metal series compete with Kai from original series in their peak form. That will be a fight of the ages. Dranzer vs L- drago, that would be a epic   showdown
I'm sorry. They're playing with tops. There is no real badassery to be found here.
I only watched beyblade for ryuga 😂 even as a kid I had issue
12:35 what the hell is this game?
Lmao u should do a dragonball tournament edition with the ref glazin .. funniest shit ever
ghenkis kong
Yooo CJ can we get a Afro samurai video
NAH, BAYBLADE WAS NEVER THAT SERIOUS, HE MADE IT TURN INTO SOMETHING SERIOUS! HE PLAYED IT LIKE IT WAS A GAME OF LIFE OR DEATH, FOR WHAT?! TO TURN A SIMPLE GAME INTO A KILLER'S PARADISE?! THAT SICK [[bababoi]]...!
Put him up against the Belmonts specifically Julius because he’s the one to kill Dracula and seal the castle, he’s one of if not the strongest Belmont with his grand cross destroying parts of the castle, which is a living entity that draws power from chaos, in his battle with soma which keep in mind he was holding back but ,and this a why I think he can still take down homelander, in dawn of sorrow Soma has to use Seals to defeat bosses as without them they would just regen but Julius just kills the fucking bosses   And thrown in soma to for over kill because dark lord or not he defeated chaos which is the opposite being to god in lore
Doesn't that mean John F Kennedy was sniped by a fuckin beyblade?
Bruuh only u can make dis show uncringe
Bro definitely watches wwe
I love how when he said hatred, he showed stinkmeaner. Also, when will he pop up in a disrespectful vid?
I mean imo, it makes sense that Gingka would win with positive energy in opposition to L Drago's negative energy
Thank you,just thank you.
Nah gang now you gotta do one for masquerade from bakugan
Ok while I doubt they’ll be rated as high as the goat Ryuga. I kinda wanna petition for from the burst franchise my boi Free to get a spot. Only muffucka who can look at some of the best bladers in his series and be like nah I don’t need a launcher i’ma just toss my shit and does it consistently. That or Mr. Tear aka Aiger, the king of arrogance and the next beyblading super Saiyan.
OK to be fair is it really plot armor when the entire point of L Drago is that it feeds off of negativity? Realistically speaking. If that’s the case, it only makes sense that large amounts of positivity would counter it.
Can we just remember that these are teenagers doing this stuff
Moses parting the Red Sea with a Beyblade is still the most insane shit I've ever seen.
free is same level because bro turns fucking super sayian when he gets mad
9:56 song?
Ive never watched beyblade....but this is pretty heat ngl
Check mate nuga
Why do you say Is name wierd
Please do that silver haired dude with the melinemum ring from of Yu-Gi-Oh I think his name is bakura
The crazy thing is, bro has more subscribers than the creator of This gen of beyblade, Takafumi Adachi, himself. Thank You sooo much bro for giving recognition To MFB beyblade... not a lot of people know about this series. Also Love this Youtube Channel !!
1:21 “Fear, hatred, anger, and..”  Me: RACISM?!  “….Greed…”
This is the funniest thing I've seen on this platform, nicely done!  Phi from Beyblade Burst Turbo would fit in perfectly here.
Bro who gave these teens tops with the power to end earth?
4:40 That's totally something Kyoya would say! 😂
Ryan Ridges
He was really nearly murdering people with his bey
The wildest thing about this is that this dude was only a 13 yr older💀💀 and at the end of the show he was only 15.
beyblade is that serious

McCullough Union

Ryuga is the living embodiment of aura. He has so much aura that he can scare the crap out of anyone just by existing.
mfs in beyblade built different 😭
anyone who even comes close to beating ryuga can probably beat like godzilla or something
give some love to free de la hoya or lui bruh 😭

Ryuga: straight away said plot armour and kid show my @ss
Benkei is down glazing every seened his first defeat to kyoya
whats the name of this anime?
final flash not galick gun in 10:33 -- 10:37
Have you ever watched Jormungand? It's about a child soldier and is in similar vain to Black lagoon I think you'd like it
the beginning where he mentioned greed and showed mr Krabs has me dead 💀
Literally me irl i swear
Do the Tokyo revengers black dragon and tenjiku arc
11:41
honestly kyo fight was peak
1:47 matpat!!!!!
Bro is like broly 💀
9:43 my girl got done up so bad she retired before hitting her prime yall dont understand that ptsd aura ryuga had was DIABOLICALLY menacing
Roberta is last???
10:02 was that fucking olawoolo and super
I need part 2 NOW!!!
Kyoya biggest glazer Benkei
Dude just did final kamehameha
Beyblade is not this serious 😭🙏
The ryuga Impression is ON point 😭
Can we mention that L Drago literally strangled Storm Capricorn until the goat literally exploded in red goo?
My goat 🔥
0:32 The roundtable having an audience of Kangs is the most retrospectively funniest thing I've seen in a while, considering how hard the MCU is detouring. Great video, absolute GOAT of a menace!
If negative emotions empower him, then positive emotions should be its kryptonite.
Nah. Ryuga is the most glazed. Kyoya is the best blader. Didn't need a special bey like Ryuga and Gingka to be part of big 3 in the series
And all of this is from a over hyped game of tops
10:37 what’s the background song called?
Na that's a final gallic gun
Ryuga is 150 pounds of pure black air force energy
mind you this is an anime about spinning top fights
He just insane like that evil Paul.
bro has to watch Garo - Ryuga and do Jinga. bro will discover the baddest baddy ever.
Anyone remember Bakugan? More specifically when Masquerade literally used his old minions as cannon fodder in order to get even stronger? That was a supreme level of disrespect!
Yu at some point in Fusion was the number 2 best behind Ryuga and Ryuga is so powerful, Yu became his number 1 fan.
I wish I new this was out from the beginning. Ryuga is minimum top 5 of my favourite characters ever
“Why is Moses here” LMFAOOO
Did this man say Genghis Kong? It's Khan bruh 😂
enjoy retirement
This was only one show he was in two more💀
the nostalgia is crazy
What’s that music at 3:33?
when was beyblade this serious 😭😭
I loved Ryuga ever since Fusion. His character and development is so badass.
He isn't a goat at all.
Ryuga casually pulling a whole ass fucking hollow purple OVER A SPINNING TOP
Such a legend and goat character and the writers didnt give him the end that he deserves...
I’m waiting till he gets to Jackie chan adventures cause uncle Jackie was cooking in real and animated life
The not skip bayless bit was art
NAH BRO Keep Moses out of it
Bro u watch this then u watch the new beyblades u be wondering who the f made this
Doflamingo moment right there 15:01
9:26 what’s the song
Ryuga gives a child sukuna vibr😂😂
Please make a video on kenpachi
In the Japanese dub, he is voiced by the same va as Nanami in JJK.
The fact this is a kids show is crazy 💀
Low key more of a menace than sukuna and toji combined
6:22 This was also hilarious.
So Hitler losing to Truman in a Bey battle is canon right?
Bro said final Kamehameha
Assume does a thugs entrance 😭
Imagine being 5"8 couldn't be me, I'm 1"3
It’s nice to see CJ talk about one of my favorite childhood shows
Bro thinks he’s gogeta with that galink gun😭
MY PARLAY!!!😂😂
Oh man, you GOTTA do Grufus Da Bongo next!!!!
Damn bro. So ive watched your vids on and off and theyve all been great but im stingy asf ngl with the subs cause ive got too MANY lol but man you done reviewed a goat from one of my guiltiest pleasures and made it AMAZING per usual, yeah its easy to glaze up Madara, Majin Buu etc but a dude from a straight UP kids show? Dawg. Instant sub. Keep up the work my G #Respect
6:21 & 9:22 best
Every Walk Out This Nigga Ryuga Got A Bassed Out Trap Beat He Officially Got A Nigga Card😂😂😂
Im hoping we get bakugaun next they got some pretty strong people there
He did not  lose a 1v1 in that tournament
Argue with a wall kill count up to 40 😂😂😂😂😂
you know this is four months late but, despite all the power of friendship BS, we can’t forget that after beating LDrago Pegasus literally fucking _evaporated_  It took literally everything that thing had just to get one win on L Drago, and it didn’t even survive it while L drago did which is wild
Ok but srsly.                WHY IN THE CINNAMON TOAST FUCK WAS MOSES THERE
Black air force activity
I had a full metal Ldrago back in school. We used to have beyblade battles. I swear, i was whooping everybodies ass with my bey. Hands down, the best beyblade ever created. I still have it to this day but because of it being too old and beat up with all the battles, it's kinda lost that spin. And it's hard to find the parts.
Ryuga he is natsu version of beyblade series
Ryuga remind me natsu
CJ  dachamp you should watch beyblade shogun steel doji ain't dead in it he becomes a beyblade kinda himself
the prologue was Ryuga violating the main character bro oh my goodness
The Baki reference is crazy💀
Blayblade kills???
Nvm 😂
Aye what’s that track at 9:11 ???
4:30 I never got to watch metal fury how do I find. The 3 metal beyblade series also why does this guy keep sucking his d :D
You could have just used the Japanese hikari scream because that scream was of completely TERROR
This ending was ass Ryuga deserved victory!
Nah yujiro higher than sukuna Is wild💀💀
13:58 made me think it was really the show.
Maybe Beyblade was really that serious...
12:04 The Laugh is insane 😂
average carti fan
This man Ryuga does not get tired of property damage in this series and this man 1 vs 99 niggas. seeing that for the first time was instant favorite character.
Ryuga got robbed of a victory just as bad if not worse than Broly did in his first movie 😂😂😂
The best video of the channel
But he lost to Rago and Gingka
imagine being so Overpowerd that only the plot armour can defeat you
Bro this show was one of my first experiences with anime along with the original Bakugan and Pokemon.
18:03 song?
Dont think ive seen a funnier video this shit had me rollin, u jist earned a sub bro
You should do a whole video on Levi
bro metal fusion beys were fucking dangerous as shit bro if you dont got a bey consider yourself fucked
Would Tanya from saga of Tanya the evil make it to the table?
elephant testicles  was wild
This is true when the fathers are in the homes. When you keep the man out of the home, you lose the skill. So blame the  women who made bad choices with men and blame the men who didn't want to be their for their kids. These traits were passed down from fathers.
7:22 HOW?! This is easily the most badass feat of any blader ever! Though to be fair, I’ve only seen Burst so its only competition (which isn’t worth much for comparison) was when Phi from Turbo burst 6 beys at once.
Imagine ur walking down the street and u see a beyblade absolutely shred through a building and head straight towards u💀
9:11 what’s the song
all you had to say was ryuga was your fav character bruh
16:10 bro just pissed cause he has no friends
6:34 unless their in the bat family those guys are invincible
i grew up with the beyblade burst series although beyblade burst series is crazy this is unhinged
u gotta do bakugan
WHOOP THAT TRICK IS CRAZY
dam
Jesus Christ loves you all. All he wants us to do is to follow his commandments. And we need to accept that he died for us. Let us repent and pray for forgiveness to be saved by him. Just remember when things start to get out of reach. Jesus is always with you because he loves you
I know you said that Ryuga's loss to Gingka was just Ryuga being robbed by the plot but I think of it this way: even with said plot, it took a Genkidama of friendship and Pegasus's life to defeat him. And it might have killed Gingka if it didn't manifest as a solid flying horse with what was left of its life force. So even if the plot kicks in to rob in, no one is safe.
the way this guy uses the n-word for every person in this vid is funny af
Nah i remember this from my childhood
That’s crazy the whole vid is exhibit A💀💀💀
Aye yo Can we get CJ to do a video on Mashle? The absolute disrespect in that show is ridiculous. 🎉
Couldnt be my goat super vegito 😎
How are these attacks that effective and causing property damage and injuring every nigga and killing people and souls
Acnologia should join the round table
I'm sorry but it's just a long toy commercial for spinning tops.
Of course ryuga is the goat his japanese voice is Seto fricking Kaiba
CJ Dachamp you wrong.   This is my take on the season 1 fight between Gingka and Ryuga, which I believe is correct. And now I will explain why I think so. Warning! The quoted lines of the characters are not exactly identical to the original, but they still have the same meaning.   "Why didn't the season 1 fight between Gingka and Ryuga have plot armor. And the power of friendship had a reason for existence and an explanation"  I believe that the final battle of season 1 between Gingka and Ryuga had no plot armor and the power of friendship has an explanation and a reason to exist.   1) In the 1st episode of the 1st season, it was explained what the power of the bey is. Gingka's approximate quote: "True power of bey has nothing to do with attack power or stamina, he attacks using the feeling of the blader that is connected to him, as if all the power of the cosmos has been poured into him. You must put your heart as big as a star sky".   2) In episode 10 of season 1, the true essence of Beyblade is revealed. There was a battle of views between the then Kyoya, who only wanted to become the strongest on his own and thought only of strength and victory by destroying all opponents, and who believed that friendship was a useless thing, and Gingka, who wanted to show a true bay battle. He explains to Kyoya: "The point of Beyblade is not to defeat the opponent, even though I said that, but I still tried to surpass you in strength. I only thought about winning, but thanks to them (friends), I realized that this is not the case. In Beyblade, the strong they don't stand alone! Fighting with someone like you, you become stronger and strengthen your bond with the bey. And as long as my friends don't lose, show me what you can do anger, tenacity and feelings of Leone (Leone misses old Kyoya)!...(after that Pegasus accelerates from the wind of Leone's hurricanes)...When I take on everything you direct at me - I will become stronger!...(skip)…If you combine stars to form a constellation, so do bonds between beys. Bay battles should not be about destroying your opponent, but about creating friendly bonds." And even though Kyoya still resists and talks about the uselessness of bonds and his constant struggle alone, Gingka says, "You were not alone...I will help you regain your lost blader's spirit!". After Pegasus' special move, Leone loses, and Kyoya remembers that he always had his Leone with him. From this episode, you can understand that a blader never fights alone.   3) In season 1 episode 14, Ryo/Ryu (Gingka's father) says: "...The outcome of the match is decided by the bader's spirit! The bader's spirit, not anything else!" From points 1 and 3, we can understand how the battle system works in the steel saga: Bey, who is connected to the owner, uses his feelings and fighting spirit as a source of power.  4) In episode 48 of season 1, Rio/Ryu (Gingka's father) told Pegasus and L-Drago's past. They were created from a fragment of 2 different meteorites. The foundation of L-Drago absorbed the negative feelings of people and turned it into a dark power. Ryo/Ryu (Gingka's father) said that the dark power can only be defeated by the light of hope, when the ancestors of the Koma villagers found out about L-Drago they used a fragment of another meteorite to create a bey, which became the basis for today's beys. This bey carried the light of people's hope and could defeat L-Drago. This bey was Storm Pegasus. In parallel with the story, we were shown a flashback in which it was shown that in the past Pegasus won, and L-Drago fell into a crystal and was hidden in the village of Koma. Ryo/Ryu told Gingka and his friends that in order to defeat L-Drago's dark power, they must combine their pure, Beyblade-loving spirits/blader's spirits/spirit powers.   5) In season 1 episode 50, there was a battle between a bey who stole the powers of other beys and turned them into a dark power and a bey who becomes stronger from the strength of blader's spirit and hopes given by people, turning it into a light of hope. Saddened by the fate of his friends, Gingka himself sets out to go to the final battle. Ryuga fights him in the stadium. At the start of the fight, it's only Gingka and Pegasus facing Ryuga, with Gingka trying to overpower Ryuga at first, with the latter blocking two of his special moves. Because of this, Ginga's confidence was weakened and it made the blader's spirit weaker, especially since Pegasus was not yet strengthened, unlike L-Drago. But when Gingka's friends came, they started to encourage him, this not only made his spirit stronger, but also gave Pegasus himself strength, because support is the same Hope given to Pegasus. and then Pegasus was able to fight off L-Dargo, because people united their blader's spirits, even Ryuga was surprised that Gingka was able to resist his dark move. Next, L-Drago begins to absorb Ryuga himself, because he could no longer control so much dark power.   6) 51 episodes of the 1st season. Now L-Drago uses all his power and dominates the opponent's bey. Ryo/Ryu notes that Gingka is missing something to win and hopes he can find the answer. Ryo/Ryu said that the 2 beys have diverged greatly in their ways throughout the story, L-Drago being the dark and Pegasus the light. After all, the darkness in L-Drago is the result of the actions of people who were deceived by the great power of the meteorite fragment. It follows that bad people made L-Drago evil. Next, L-Drago sent his dark move "Dragon Emperor Soaring Destination" against Pegasus, the attack moving towards Gingka. And here, what was missing now came to his aid - the blader's spirits of defeated comrades who had not been united before: Hikaru, Tsubasa and Kyoya. They made Gingka understand what he lacked with the phrase: "If you fight force against force, you will not win." They strengthen Pegasus and now Gingka's goal is not to defeat Ryuga, but to save him from the dark power, because he was deceived by the accumulated dark power. And that's why, now, Gingka can use absolutely all the power. The finale of this battle was the victory of Pegasus and Gingka and getting rid of the darkness of L-Drago.  Conclusion: The battle "Gingka vs. Rayuga" did not have story armor, because it did not violate the established conditions of the battle system, the main idea and world building. Friendship in Beyblade has an explanation in the battle system and a reason for existence in the main idea, and it is also a norm and an important element of the essence of Beyblade itself, which should not be neglected.
Still remember moses during ginka was giving his dumbass sob story
Roberta gotta be an A+ atleast😭😭
Bro didn't even touch on the other seriee where bro has the spin absorption bey 😂
well now i need to see a Seto Kaiba Special
Ryuga’s run was basically 2018 Lebron lol, bro was a part of a team of bums and tore apart the comp to get to the finals and lose 😭
No way he said exhibit A😂
I have no idea if he covers anything other than anime. But Admiral Thrawne from Star Wars will be part of the table tbh.
You need to do the rest of the series for him I beg 😂😭
I never laughed so hard. Your commentary is something else man
OG beyblade was brutal yet the new beyblade was noticeably less brutal but a bit to much to show on a kid show
I'm telling you bruh ryuga was basically marick from yu gi oh
1:50 I think we know who’s under that X
God I loved Beyblade, my first anime when I was little and istg I was riding Kyoya's d man. He was my favorite character and my first anime crush 😭 I did my hair like him and when my mom told me to brush it I yelled "I want to be like Kyoya!" And ran off. My mom at that moment knew she had a weird ass child 😂
After watching this and getting nostalgic, I thought to my self is there anyone in Yu-Gi-Oh that could be on the round table. The only people I could think of for Yu-Gi-Oh could be Bakura or Yami Marik.
This is a strong character 🔥👍
Jesus loves us all ❤
God loves us all ❤
Ryuga lost too plot😢
No cap the part where you say is D riding all you do kilt me 😂😂😂
Ruyga simply wakes up every damn morning wanting smoke lmao
Song at 9:25 ?
Gotta do a round table trial on Masquerade from bakugan now. That mf had NO remorse.  Could also do Seto Kaiba if he not there already.
This the best Ryuga video 😂😂😂
Lets be honest here. When kyoya hikaru and tsubasa saved gingka, tsubasa and hikaru did jack shit. Kyoya was the only one contributing anything to that fight.
This man reminds me a LOT of Yami Marik
I was so young when In watched ALL OF THE EPISODES with all of my big brothers. Idk why I had a crush on RYUGA. I guess bc how he carried himself & how powerful he was. I wanna see this show again :D
Remember, its a kids show about kids spinning top toys
10:11 what song is playing on the background?
Everyone: "you can't make beyblade that overly serious." Writers and animators: "Hold my sake."
Don't forget the part where Ryuga didn't participate in the qualifiers at first just to give everyone else a head start.
7:30 what did I just Witness
Thank you for the kyoya respect as a die hard fan I was hyped to see bro gave him somewhat of a fight bro knew what he was walking into was warned multiple times and said "nah I ain't a b*tch he wants it he's gonna get it." 🫡
I'll never forget seeing moses parting the seas with a beyblade i f*cking lost it
Yea uh..nothing much to say but uh.. What's the title of the song in the part 11:40 ?
13:31 If you watch the Japanese version of the fight, L-Drago straight up says that they need Bladers Blood, not spirit. So L-Drago was literally out here siphoning blood from people.
Same shit that took Itachi out
Repent Jesus Christ is coming back soon
Jesus Christ loves you and he died on the cross for you and your sins
Don't say "omg" or "ong" or "holy s***"or "holy crap" or "godamm" or " what the hell" it's sin
9:27 ryuga in a nutshell
Love the content man 🔥   Anyone else agree he should review Lauxes (Fairytale) and Death the kid (Soul eater) for entry into the round table ❤👍🏽
if Raoh the Conqueror was in Beyblade, Ryuga would be him!!!!
You should do a video on Roman Reigns, the Undisputed Tribal Chief.
You need to repent man.Your just sinning and for what money, popularity and fame.Look all these can change.Nothing in society is worth losing your soul.So go God because he will always be infinite good, loving and can give you whatever you need.
My beyblade nostalgia hit so heard watching this
Still ain’t made a video on my hero academia though
Bro this Ryuga impression is spot on
"Argue with the wall" ಥ⁠‿⁠ಥ I'm starting to believe the real troll is dis dudeeee, not LD (Long Deek)
Thank you for not forgetting about the other seasons 🥹
Girl was so traumatised she never picked lil toy back up ever again
2:07 Moses has a beyblade to slipt the  red sea Amen
hold on what was the music just befoe the metal gear death screen? sound extremely familier.
Forget plot armor. They needed a plot AK to end this. He was killing too many to let this go
Bro is making me want to go watch beyblade again 😭
Bout time Cj did Beyblade you should also do burst as well
Ahh beyblade. The spinning tops that hold the spirits of mighty beasts withing them with all the force of tac nukes. Lets give them to children. That seems like a smart idea. Im suprised beyblade doesnt have a a higher bodycount. Hell I'm suprised a lot of children shows don't have a higher body count. Chief offenders: Pokemon, Bakugan, Monsuno, Beyblade (obviously) and Yu-Gi-Oh.
That beyblade caused 2020 to happen. 😢
he not better than Ronaldo 😂
What is the beat at 3:35?
Of All anime where history of a society revolves around a children's game. Beyblade is the most ridiculous.
Ngl... I forgot beyblade was an anime
I've found your channel yesterday and bro, your narration is like no other! Can't wait to see more Beyblade stuff, it'd be amazing lmao
🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐 #IMissRyuga
I'm sorry, coma? They got a coma after getting blasted through a stadium *pause
What show is this
I like the idea of everyone being bigger fans of the GOAT than Gingka.
I love the sonic riders race finish theme playing hahaha
Bro said ghengis Kong
Music Theme at 6:20?
_why do you have a Shannon impression_
You forgot to mention after cookig tsubasa ryuga also INFECTED tge man with the same dark power thats in ldrago
Lol come on now dawg. Those 3 at the bottom of the leaderboard have been TBD for how many years now
1.2 views over a ryuga video is crazy
bro's a menace with a side of fries💀
I need Marik or Bakura
The check mate bit got me
Nah nah honestly Ryuga robbed Leone, his L was deserved
Oh my
❤
Subasa reads as queer to me.
Dude you are making art.
Name of song at 11:40?
Ok so bros attack first started out as a galick gun, then became a double Sunday(raditz’s move), and then he fired it as a Tri beam Ok bro’s a dbz fan and I can’t blame him
Ehh yo cj we need a hiachi Mishima  video bro bring out d 🐐  bro gave his whole blood line p.t.s.d
Pls post another vid

FINALLY, A BEYBLADE CHARACTER ENTERS THE ROUND TABLE.  THIS SHIT GOES SO DEEP MY BROTHER LOVES IT
What’s the music at 12:30?
Bro I literally hicaru fly across the sky while I was in Cancún
Whoop that trick
bro, youve gotta do marik ishtar from yuhioh, that bitch got baf1 af
This is the OG goat.
he's one of those characters that's only weakness is plot armor (or character development)
What was that boondocks beat from 7:45
We know Majin Buu is first but Goku Black disrespect 😭😭 he had the cast saying third time is the charm
Bro please do a trial on Mr Krabs I’m begging you
I know you're doing it for the joke,but his foot isn't gone, it's just bent and drawn poorly,the boot is still there
Call goku
This video made me hype asf but you forgot to cover the matchup between Ryugu vs Yu.  I know  yu got cooked they just didn’t show the whole thing on screen
Tala was a better villain
well here we go again
I’m not gonna cap you need to do Reggie from battle bladers
Solo leveling
Hey I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart. If anyone tells you that Jesus isn’t the only way, they are lying to you and they don’t care about your future.
I swear this man is a definition of a nuclear warhead because I KEEP SEEING HIM CAUSING PROPERTY DAMAGE EVERY FIGHT💀
I think we need you to cover his successor and count him to Ryuga's score.
I see how you snuck LeBroskiis in on the background characters sir, well played
Ngl bro you gotta do Season 0 Yami Yugi
I was gonna say that but you did
most villains get fucked over by plot amor
Ryuga is kinda a fraud for using a Bey that could probably destroy earth but gingka is a fraud too so don’t feel left out
Bro ain’t fighting demons the demons fighting him
What is Hikaru’s animal beyblade
Sukuna wishes he was like Ryuga.
Bro is really the greatest
14:05 porky the pig is crazy 😭😭😭
8:46 anyone know the name of this sound?
That was not a galic gun that was a finale kamehameha gun
The Dark Dragon Emperor
Yo anyone know the fighting game 12:37
He's such a goat you had to make 2 vids for him
As long as no one uses the power of Friendship, Ryuga unironically solos all warriors. You name it, and Ryuga is the undisputable winner.
Nah if you wanna talk about balco air force energy just watch bay lade burst evolution because them mfs were theowing boulders as 10 year olds
Be fr😂😂
Beyblade is Jojo for kids
Can you do burst characters next there are alot of goated characters
How come Yami doesn't have a video when he's been on the table for a while?
Nah this new leader board better get a regrade on that boy Slade. We going off the Cartoons but that mfer might as well be S with his comic versions.
The only reason no one died was because it’s a kid show if it was given more room on the rating some scary shit would have happened
I actually thought that was ren if he ruled the earth Ren from bakugan season 3 by the way Speaking of which can you do bakugan?
I don't care what y'all say bayblade is NOT THAT SERIOUS ☠️☠️☠️😭😭😭
Ryuga was a sexist
10:06 is that Philly??
So broly isn’t on the leaderboard ?? I figure he would be S++
I don’t know what was funnier? The goat noises or the constant array of glazing this man.
Ryuga is Sukuna before Sukuna was a thing
Hi
Am I the only person who saw Hikaru, Tsubasa, and Kyoya at the final battle thought they were their ghosts?
Ryuga no diffs Rago in 2024!🗣️🗣️
Ayyyyeeee
5:06 That was cold.
Day 6 of requesting shadow from eminence in shadow
Funny how Ryuga does a final Kamehameha before dragon ball officially had it in the show.
Dude was literally a wallmart version of Kai Hiwatari from the original Beyblade series... Tyson,Kai,Ray and Max These 4 will always be my fav... G revolution was the last season i watched of Beyblade...Other series after that didn't really ineterest me...
Ryuga is the best villain/anti hero ever
Music @ 9:21 ?
What if you do a round table of black air force of Yu Gi Oh
LET 'ER RIP!!!
Can we see a reverse flash trial
Subbed, I love this shit.
Ryuga: BAH BAH BITCHES IM DA GOAT!
My dude u should do trial on superboy prime trust me
Iam gonna need the name of that background soundtrack trap at 3:32🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not the apex music
16:20 Is my favorite moment of this video. CJ is so pissed off that the G.O.A.T. is getting robbed.
I'd argue the foot at 6:45 is still there.. just that the leg angled in a unnatural way after it got BENT. his tibia shaped like the massive L he just took.
Why isn’t Tonya on that list?🧐
Hey cj my man. Mashle should be on the round table of bad assness. He is the muscle goat
He wields L drago but takes no Ls
Wait wait wait, MOSES IS IN THE SHOW!!!!!😧😧😧
Mosis split the red sea
Imagine making a fighting game for beyblade based off arc systems. With dramatic finishers and everything i would buy that shit in a heartbeat
Man said ghengis KONG 😂
I wish I could watch the rest of the metal saga sub since APPPEARANTLY, ryuuga called Gingka's dad a POS.
You should do a Batman one
What’s the music at 14:53?
What’s the beat at 3:33
Nah this needs a part 2 with metal masters, Ryuga’s run was legendary 😂😂😂🙏🏽
Ryuga waa definitely that guy. Even as a kid I respected this man. I swear bro the Hikaru violation was absolutely *raw* as fuck
—-_
I was obsessed with this show when I was little lol
Beyblade without any Yugioh villains at this table is not legit. I need Pegasus, Marek or Bakura inducted ASAP sir
We aint getting out of the stadium with this one bois
dawg i remember crying when gingka lost for the first time cuz this nigga was onna streak js to get bodied by ryuga
You forgot to mention the scene where ryuga THREW his blade and took out beyblade masters without letting it rip that was crazy😭
when cj said let it rip at Exhibit a was really cool lmao
Ryuga the goat + L drago who’s also the goat = the god-like goat
15:17 was brutal
The parlay joke killed me 11:35😂
The fact that L-Drago was able to stand up to the power of friendship and push it back really shows you the level of his black Air Force energy my goat really almost defeated plot armor itself
Ill be waiting for exhibits B and C
To all the haters, beyblade was in fact that serious
I request Seto Kiba from the Yu-Gi-Oh Seto is a prideful, Cold Hearted, intelligent, Savage, and badass dude
Boshiso brown
Where KING Bradly at CJ
how has he not made a video on garou
pull up give em hell leave
Never got into beyblade as a kid, do I need to lock in and watch it?
Beyblade was never that serious till he pulled up, he made it serious
This shit brings me back way back
That scene where Ryuga "Fights" Hikaru.... I AM DYING OF LAUGHTER 😂😂😂😂😂
Low tier god meme had me weak dawg
Finally my favorite character from my favorite childhood anime Ryuga was a menance, dude was always on demon timing, always ready to throw down and not once ever stopped being feared.  He’s the GOAT
Why can't it just be a jojo thing instead of spinning tops
He was the hater of all haters and tbh? My role model
Man ryuga gotta be my 3rd fav blader 1 jenga 2 kyoya
Your vids are fucking hilarious and  use of memes, goated!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fun fact:When L Drago posessed Ryuga, Ryugas voice didnt went deeper its L Drago and Ryuga talking at the same time,like Venom.
Best video fuckomg ever 🎉🎉🎉
They did my boy Tobio dirty
Cj you played sonic riders?
Legendary video
CJ DACHAMP GIVE ACCELERATOR A MAN WHO AHS KILLED 10,000 GIRLS JUST TO BECOME STRONGER A VIDEO NOW look I love ryuga and want more of him but cj accelerator is no goat no my man if he is he is a goat with wings iterally man jas angel wings
No no no no no no no…wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
I wonder when he will do Accelerator from a certain magical index.
I thought he was 5’11
ryuga is probably wanna of my favorite antagonist ever!
16:41 had me CRYIN BRUH😭
Season 1 was not even his peak💀
hisoka
2:04 crazy Moses is here in beyblade..
He killed so many people in that stadium 😂😂😂
Beyblade was such an odd (and awesome) show. LOL. Same as Yu-Gi-OH
😂😂😂👏🏾
I have been waiting for YEARS for this
Didn’t they blow up the moon
The moment I heard Rome built it's empire off a bayblade I suddenly like Bayblade.  I FUCKING LOVE ROME.
I still can’t believe that Moses canonically used a fucking beyblade to part the red god damn see in the beyblade universe
Imma say this. Dragoon was the better left spinning beyblade.
Guys , like this comment for the next Contestant for the round table: GABRIEL YULAW from THE ONE 📞💀💯🌬🌫🔥
Bro he actually doing Beyblade 😲🔥
Did i hear the Urban Reign results screen in this bih 😂
Bro his exhibit a was a whole fucking video. Was beyblade really that serious
Yo bro please make more videos in 2024. oh my gosh you are so funny it's killing me I can't focus on other things for your videos in the background.
This man was my favorite character in the anime and L-Drago was my first ever beyblade
Another menace in a similar period of anime is Rey dark from Inazuma eleven. If you haven’t seen that show, that man is STRAIGHT MURDERING OVER SOCCER!
We can’t forget the other 3 from the team ryego destroyed in the tournament
Man Hikaru getting *_violated_* is something I will always forever remember because he literally sent the girl to retirement with PTSD and watching that first hand was just so mind blowing you can't possibly forget it
CAN YOU DO ACCELERATOR NEXT?
i wasn't ready for the sonic riders music 😭😭 0:26
Cj do fist of the north star from 1980s
Came from trial 2 truly the Undisputed GOAT
Ryuga will never beat a Kai and Tyson fight the original Beyblade
Finally. One of the greatest characters, to ever exist in fiction. AND HE’S GETTING 2 PARTS!
Ok, why the F is Kahoot! music playing?
Gotta make my own timestamps real quick 😭 5:51
W video brudda🙌🏽
Ryuga is my favorite beyblade character without a doubt he is such a menace.
Y is he attacking the person and not the person
The power to instagate
Bruh I love that I was not the only one watching this show when I was younger and seeing how much YouTube has changed and finally seeing a bunch of people talk about it is amazing. Ryuga was definitely a top villain back in the day there was no stopping dude
This is making me want to rewatch the show. LMFAO
Kyoya vs ryuga was the original gojo vs sukuna
Stinkminer reincarnation
ryuga is also a terorist i think he organised 9/11(this is just a joke)
Baby Kia is Ryuga fav artist I’m convinced
Tf was gingka name gingka i swear its jenga
WHY CANT YOU LEAVE US ALONE GOD DAMN EVERYWHERE I GO YEARS LATER ITS 28-3 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The amount of times I laughed during this video is insane 😂 Get a like for me
Just commenting so more people get recommended "peak"
I’m finna glaze my shit
Legit I kinda want CJ to do a video on Megatron. If only to see which one he chooses.
2:50 That wasn’t no fight, that was a *_SWEEP!_*
Ryuga is the definition of “attack the trainer not the pokemon”
I own Ldrago
Beyblade was that serious
I love that their is a massive beyblade spike !
HELL YEA RYUGA IS THE BEST GOATED FR
i think i will rewatch beyblade
Does the list at 1:03  mean we will eventually be getting the Zaraki video?
HE PULLED UP IN THE CHOPPA WITH THE CHOPPA
*17:54* THAT WAS JUST EXHIBIT A?!!??
AY THIS MY CHILD HOOD
W-!
1 million video complete congrats cj  😊🥶⚡
I owned LDrago, and i never lost
Imagine how hard you gotta be to be able to kill in a child show ON CAMERA TOO
The parlay on ryuga never failed🤞
Ngl wen i was a li kid i had da biggest crush on hikaru i was crying at my tv wen i saw shawty get cooked like dat 😭
4:40 epic😂😂😂
I’m sorry what?????? I’m unsubscribing
We need a kenpachi vid
We need this boy in the round table
17:15 They had to power of friendship, THEN QUAD GANK this man, to get him ONE LOSS.
i know it was only one episode but he was so menacing, can you do a round table of future Danny
“Mamba Mentality”😭
This video need a mil
You should do one for Lelouch, man. He definitely gonna be high on this list
you should definitely do a marik ishtar black air force episode!! especially the sub yu-gi-oh over the dub 4kids ver
15:12 This shit had me weak😭
man i remember loving this show as a kid without remembering any of the characters or story.
But CJ, the spectators deserve it for bein that gung-ho. It's that easy
ninja kamui or solo leveling u must do pls cj pls
Need to see Vegeta and Mugen. When they get they chance. Also. When Shredder rolling up?
Even when he lost, he still take somebody’s life subscription
yo CJ you should do an honourable mention video for that snake beyblade dude. He made the other kids cry that was traumatic as a kid.
Even when the G.O.A.T loses he’s making sure that someone has to die
“My parlayy”😭😭11:32
Ryuga, the OG of Black Air Force energy! May that nigga rest in peace!
the kahoot music goes hard
The xenoverse soundtracks are tuff
Anime?😊
And remember everyone Beyblade Metal Fusion was a damn kid show. But the most goated Ryuga moment is when he sacrificed himself
2:08 I would've taken this line, if i was black!
Undisputed on ESPN is top tier tomfoolery.
That leaderboard needs change my man. Respect to Yujiro and Madara (even those aren't equals imo) but they nowhere near on Kid Buu level.
i didnt even notice this vid
you know el drago losing to the power of friendship makes sense. We know it gets stronger by absorbing negative emotions like anger and hatred which makes Ryuga a perfect power source for it because he's a psychopath but what happens if el drago is surrounded by a bunch of positive emotions. That massive crowd cheering on gingka would be producing a bunch of hope and trust and determination which would over power all the crazy fucker energy from Ryuga making el drago would weaken with nothing to feed on which gave Pegasus the chance to send him packing. You can say its plot but for once the power of friendship would actually hurt a villain for once by messing with their power source
Nostalgia man
That was no galick gun bro that was literally a final kamehameha movement and everything this mf thinks he’s vegito 💀💀💀
Ryuga (Beyblade), Yami Marik (Yu-Gi-Oh), and Masquerade (Bakugan), the three childhood villains
Por videos como estos decidí aprender der inglés jajajs, me facino
I can already see his greatest disappointment of how the writers fucked up about his defeat over some bullshit power of friendship out of nowhere
Im SHOCKED you did some videos on Beyblade, but man am I so damn happy. I grew up with beyblades and this anime series. Thank you for reminding me how insane Ryuga was.
I remember this show! God, one of the best shows ever
5:05 LTG 😂
Only A? OHH DIGGITY
He’s my favorite character
🔥🔥🔥
Yo where’s Tanya on the Leaderboard she at least the devil
why did i just get the notification that this video was posted rn 💀
Greatness all the way 😂
CJ WHY MY BOY TOMMY OLIVER FROM POWER RANGERS IN HIS PRIME NOT ON THE ROUND TABLE OF THE BLACK AIR FORCES
Martians point the Death beam at the earth you bet HES GONNA hit it, I WANT RYUGA
It’s next week, where you at?
Irs next week bro where you at
still waiting for disrespectful anime moments in history 8 😔
You gotta do a video on ninja kamui for the round table
Can u pls do marik from yugioh pls
I wonder when where going to hear about the vampire kids from the black lagoon 🤔🤔🤔

It’s been a week now produce that ass🤣
Part two any day now?
8:06 why man's nose look like a penis 😭💀    ight it's been 7 days where part 2
Me rewatching again waiting for the 2nd one episode to drop
How is slade below sukuna💀
We need exibit B so badly!...😢
Yea. I can’t help but admit that Ryuga was one of the main reasons I watched this series
Splitting the red sea with a beyblade is wild.
nah as soon as i heard the apex intro i knew those ngas was cooked
Bro you should add Jotaro Kujo
You're the first commentator that's actually mentioned how Ryuga literally ended Hikaru's career. I just hope that somehow we can get some respect put on the OG Beyblade, because they were destroying stadiums all the time and Kai woud be on straight Demon Time.
day 7 pay up
womp womp
Felt Sonic EXE appears there bro☠️
It’s been a week plz post the new video
Man, wonder if any Yu-Gi-Oh! Villains would make this list  Pretty sure Bakura would be a big contender  Saw his village being burned and smelted into making dark artifacts of mass destruction Possessed an ordinary kid through one said dark artifacts  Sends people to hell at a whim Sadistic and twisted - back-stabbing Comes back unexplained (mostly) despite thinking he has been defeated  Nearly destroyed the world by means of a game more than once (dark side of dimensions counts )
day 1 of asking for the Shredder from TMNT 2003 for the round table..... bro absolutely needs it
dang, we didnt vote hard enough
Cj I fw the series heavy and you should try to make videos on like anime arcs and rank them on like list and you pick some of your favorite and some of the best arcs
This is real 😈❤️🫶goat right there
Glad my boy is getting the respect he deserves
7:42 bro sounds like the DJ from Shogun Steel😂
Man, this was a crazy ass show I watched back in the day. I got Pegasus lying around somewhere.
bro you need to check ninja kamui ASAP
Yooooooooooo cj do a video on Ninja kamui
I remember watching an episode of Beyblade Burst and being shocked that the stadiums were normal sized, the evolutions were just them customizing their beys, and that they used actual physics to win battles instead of spiritual energy attacks. I was not prepared for realism in Beyblade.
Drop the video
They beypicks thing took me out bro 😭😭😭😭and its been a week bruh
Please make a part 2 for the goet ryuga
Man the nostalgia, Phoenix was my favourite character, Ryuga was 2nd
Is part 2 tonight or Tommorow
Hell Yeah!, HIM!
CJ we need Gilgamesh on the round table Fr🗣️💯
"So what y'all got cooked up for our show about spinning tops"
THAT WAS FUCKING EXHIBIT A?!??!? BROTHER!!!!!!!!
Yo I recommend solo leveling
Kenpachi Zaraki video please
Beyblade for real lolz
Nah you need to check out Adonis from the kingdom of ruin. That 🥷🏽 was something different
Ugh.... Nostalgia.
Ryuga only lost because of the plot
"Why is moses her" 😂😂😂
what if ginger ryuga and kioya repisent Japan team
I like the fact used stadium music in sword and shield
CJ PLEASE DO GOJOOOO
Multitude Of Power Ranger Villains should be considered in the RoundTable.
got me sounding like a mom on that comment'
how is this a kid show?????
Music at 2:50?
could you do a part 2 or the beyond scared straight jojo edition please? (also i love your vids!)
what's the track in 1:17–30 .... I wanna use it for a self introduction in tertiary class ,and look down on these negus.
9:25 Nah bro Ryuga didn’t even know the opening ceremony was happening This _ningen*_ just had Lil Pump blasting so loud he couldn’t hear the announcement  *Im white, so that’s the closest I dare step.
Nobody talks about in metal masters where he gets jumped by 100 thugs and throws drago at them and inhalates them
They even named his bey L’drago. So people can catch these L’s
I rember i got mad when he lost. Me and my cousins were watching this when it came out and they started to cheer. They had genki's pegasus and they always won when we duel. I got happy when he was winning because they always got sad. Then they had Ryuga lose and i never heard them be quiet about it untill he returned later on
It was only a matter of time before CJ the goat took a swing at ryuga
Somewhat entertaining but definitely too many n-word drops.
Can you make a video on yumeko jabami
Seto Kaiba gotta be next for a seat at the table
You forgot a point of misdemeanor when after ryuga beat up dojo, ryuga STEPPED on his glasses as a final "fuck you" before going to fight gingka.
Ldrago was whooping that ass😅
Cj please cover Captain Tsubasa the anime the og one btw not the new one (51 episodes… and it gets a little boring but I swear it’s worth it)
Ryuga vs Hikaru is basically every doujin of gyaru-oh and tomboy. Girl getting cooked
I hope that CJ realizes that, in every time Ryuga blew holes in the stadium, there were people sitting in the seats that got completely destroyed, meaning that all of those spectators are dead! I'm honestly surprised he didn't include that in the calculations! The anime cuts the out whenever the stadium sections get destroyed, but there is NO WAY they all cleared that area before they died!
He must not be named 1:49
2:58 what the fuck was mj doing
Curious to see if akashi will ever be mentioned in Black air force activities 🤔
That checkmate nihgga was to funny 😂
that shadow reference i put it in my songs
Can you do aiger next?
9:23  He Ain't In The Dark Fighting Demons  The Demons Are In The Dark Fighting Him  Ryuga Was Such A Menace That This Entire Video Was Just A Prologue And Exhibit A-
Bro, another thing with the Hikaru violation. In a blink and you'll miss it scene, Ryo admits that Hikaru had to go to therapy to be able to look at beyblades again.
BRO THIS MF BE GETTING GLAZED and ngl IM GLAZING HIM CUS IF THIS MF EVER GET IN TO OUT WORLD SHIIIII WE FU-
Dude your Ryuga impression is so fucking good.
im not even going to lie i remember originally watching the ryuga and kyoia fight and it has to be the most badass fight in the entirety of fusion
DOFFY VIDEO FINALLY COMING LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
4:55 Funniest shit ever
Wheres Part 2 CJ XD
Where that pt 2 at foee
IVE WAITED FOR A BEYBLADE VIDEO FOR SO LONG
part 2 hype!!
Ryuga sometimes makes me forget that this is a show about spinning tops LUL
To this day.. this is the best intro I’ve ever seen
Just found your channel 3 days ago... i've watched every video already 😅
I CANNOT wait when we get to the glory that is exhibit C and hearing, “ultime move!”
You should make video  about  doflamingo
Make one on Hao from shaman king pls
please do Garou next 🙏
When part 2
Hikaru got DESTROYEDDD
Men we need part 2 !!! Ryuga has so much more to show in the other seasons (love your work)
OMG I LOVE THIS VIDEO AND I AINT EVEN WATCHED IT YET CAUSE I KNOW YOU DELVER
bro i have been watching u for 3 years and u have yet to drop a ahh video W CJ
Damn Bayblade and Bakugan was literaly half of my elementary school
I need that beat at 3:33. It's not under songs in the description
rayooga
2 more days my friend you better pay up good or I'm coming for your ass
CJ WE NEED A JOKER VID
Part 2 please of beyblade❤❤❤I love your videos CJ
Do TMNT shrader ✌
Do seto kaiba or merik next🙏 Honestly there are a lot of old yugioh   Characters that can be chosen, even Pareo from season 0 is a danger to society
Cj does a perfect ryuga impression
I'm just casually playing Helldivers 2 when I see Cj upload and now im like "FUCK THE GAME LETS WATCH THIS VIDEO"
2:09   It's the little things like this tiny 3 second clip that get me roaring in laughter so hard, for NO reason. It's for some reason the funniest thing to me in the whole world.  It pretty much lives rent free in my mind.
“MY PARLAYYYY”😹😹😹
Watch ninja kamui non stop action
Beyblade went so hard fr all the gimmick kids toy anime had such good shit for no reason same with bakugan that had a hella good story
"Throughout the stadiums and tournaments, I alone am the dragon emperor."
This is kid buus younger son. It's a fcking kids game.
We need video on kenpachi
Bro such an opp he gettin a 3 parter 💀💀💀
Ryuga's only true loss was to a literal god
i love everyone suddenly started liking bayblade again and i couldnt be more happier about it
I never was into beyblade...😅
can you do Mashle: Muscles and Magic next?
Ryuga pulled a Madera before Madera even existed. 1v99, the 'oh you stopped the first one lets see you try again' line, and it was only the first exhibit. At this point Ryuga better be above Madara already. Z rank.
Underrated opinion but I believe Dartz from Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters should be in the round table for various reasons. He has more than few thousand counts of murder, has commited fraud, ruined the lives of random teenagers by either sending them to prison or killing everyone they love just so that he could force said teenagers to become self-destructive murders of a psychotic cult focused on a resurrecting an ancient god. Also Dartz has committed regicide (his wife the queen, his daughter the princess and his father who was the previous king of Atlantis), mass killings and has various acts of terrorism (Destroying Atlantis), neglect (abandoning the 99 thieves Yami sacrificed to make the millenium items). Impersonation (Gozaburo Kaiba) that led to him starting an effin war and supplying both sides with weapons to keep it on going. Getting advantage of desperate individuals like Mai, 2 Counts of attempting to Destroy The World by extinguishing all life (attempted genocide) and more...Dartz should definitely be in the round table next
Ey special shout-out to Genghis Kong, realest mf to ever dictate 🗣️🗣️🗣️
THANK YOUUUUUU
You should make a vid about Ragna crimson
Daaaaaaamn
No charecter can ever match his legacy in beyblade TRULY THE BESY WRITTEN BEYBLADE CHARECTER GOAT the dragon emperor
If the people in this show didn't had the collateral damage protection Ryuga would had more kill that Sukuna.  HE LITERALLY MAKES A MINI SHIBUYA ACCIDENT EVERY TIME HE PULLS UP!
8:08 after a while I thought he was finna break into a DMX verse!! 😂  "Theresa, Monica, Sharron, Nicki"
Yes sir another W vid
Zekko7 did this first go watch his shit
My boy Ryuga finally get the attention he deserves
You should definitely do one for Aizen, or Yhwach.
Top 3 children’s shoes fs
Reminding me of the good days of beyblade, Ryuga and Brooklyn def the 2 standin on business
This was the only version of Beyblade and so-called villain I really enjoyed, especially his death. To this day Ryuga is still on the list with Madara, Aizen and Sakuna and evil greats.
As a child, you root for Gingka. As an adult, you realize how much of an absolute GOAT and menace Ryuga is.
CJ you should make a video on blackbeard.
I know some people might disagree with me but cj should do lui shirusagi next
I cannot wait for part 2 jesus christ almighty. Ryuga loses TWICE in the whole series and I can't wait for it.
Yo yukio okumura from blue exorcist had his moment of black Air Force energy. Bro was insulting his brother while killing demons dual wheedling pistols with his eyes closed
Do free next
Berserk round table when?
Dawg, BeyBlade was never this serious, they for real got moses and universal level attacks from BEYBLADES.😭💀
We were robbed of Ryuga vs Julian. Hope you do Kyoya as well😂
We need more this man is a menace
9:21 What is the mane of this theme.
I got something with black Air Force energy meliodas the sin of wrath and he isn't on the round table
part 2 when?
Bro u gotta do bakugan next (Either Masquerade or Spectra Fantom)
THANK YOU CJ!!! IVE BEEN HOPING FOR HIM TO JOIN. Thank you for making this week better since I got fired earlier. Love ya man
PLEASE make one for Brooklyn from G-Rev.
Beyblade on my list of anime I won't watch but bro is making me wanna watch it now
i would love to eventually see kaiba getting a chance at the black air force energy table
He was turning into his inner KENTRELL at the end of
Do gilgamesh
Yo cj I was watching simba’s stream and heard it was your birthday 5 days ago happy belated birthday
?
Why did you cross out the picture of Ate all hitler
R.i.p the goat
Of all the age-restricting Black Air Force Actvity stuff, that CJ here can't put on here. . . Guts may very well be the most f-ed up.  I think what happened to Guts, is SO DISRESPECTFUL, that he's just. . . simply forbidden to enter the table-- much less, be judged?  Is that it?
Mah boy played that Nate Dogg
Tyson is still stronger
Bruh Hiei in Beyblade now?!?
Didn't Ryuga only lose twice over the entire series
Sweet.
My boyyy I was waiting for thisss for Soo long
I grew up on YuGiOh! instead of Beyblade, but holy shit I gotta watch this show now.
Ryuga got madara'd 💀☠️
Good day everyone 🍵
Ҝ|ᗪ丂 丂卄ㄖ山? 匚卂卩
Not gon lie bro was a role model for me as a kid,l
This is the funniest round table episode ever😂😂😂
Where’s Dio on the rankings 😞
CJ TO YOUR ETERNITY SEASON 2 VIDEO PLS
Yo could you put one punch man in the round table
All hail the Dragon Emperor Literally his name
This man is one of the best villain to antiheros in anime
INK DEMOM SHOUL BE IN THE ROUND TABLE. Let me tell u way...    Exhibite A: the feats of this guy is insane like he has infinite power and that's not all THE METELY SAID THIS IS 1/4 OF HIS POWER! THATS MEANS THAT HE CAN GO BEYOND INFINITY. Ok let me quick fire, can go through walls, milipulate ink,has a beast form,can reset the timeline,and kill om sight, and he's not slow bc I one of his kill animations he quickly when behind the player and kill them.   Ok now for.....  Exhibited B:  He's attitude to society is wild bc he kills on sight no matter who u are no matter what u are ur getting cooked like the ink demon saying:ima cook on sight even if ur a baby little (n words) gonna get cooked. Also he be worshiped by simp. AND IN THE END HE LITTERLY KILLS THE FINALL BOSS FOR U OBSORBESE U TO JUST GET THE REEL AND EVEN IF THE REEL IS SPUN UR GONNA GET OUT OF THE LOOP OR THE LOOP GONNA RESET. so like he has no weakness.    Now for Exhibit C:   NM bendy aka Morø's nightmares GOAT u think ink demon whoops nah this man on X-games mode fire form his hand we whoops NM sans morø nightmares one btw. He's strong to but iman not get involved in that he be whoops NM sans ass. So like he be get puffed he can teliport any where through portals fly and can turn into NM beast mode. And HE FOUGHTIN THE SUN WITH OUT A SWEAT! NAH AND HE DOSE THE UNO REVESE CARD TO NM SNAS FINISHER AND LIKE RYUGA HE GOT ROBBED BY PLOT....by exhausting him self and when back to normal BTW THE WAY BEOFRE HE WHEN BACK YO NORMALL HE F#CKED UP MARS AMD SPLIT THE MOON BREAKS THE SOLAR SYSTEM NEARLY CLAPED NM CUPHEAD BY ACCIDENT.AND HE CAN SEND YOU HIS MINI DOMAIN EXPANSION AND SUMMAND MINIONS. So like yeah.....NM bendy is more crazy. Don't believe me watch NM bendy vs NM sans         So like PUT HIM IN THE ROUND TABLE
This was on point man 🐐🤣🤣
Cj can you do kiba from Yu-Gi-Oh
Ragna when?
Whats the song during the ryuga vs tsubasa glazing called?
What’s good n-
Bro was an absolute menace. Just looking at him sent shivers down your spine.
The yugioh equivalent of ryuga is sora from arc v
All bro gotta do is not find out about 4D and ryguy is fine
pls do eminence in shadow
BRUH I STILL HAVE MY LDRAGO TO THIS DAY THANKS TO THE DAWG RYUGA
ahhhhh FUN GOOD OLD TIME ............
Beyblade definitely had cool villains and heroes
i love these bc it sounds like retelling a fight you witnessed at a 7/11
Welp, time to rewatch the whole metal series again
"Fear, Hatred, "WHAT'S GOOD NYUGA" 1:23
Totally agree but I think cj needs to bring my man makato shisho into the round table rn😊
Messi is the Gingka of soccer unfortunately, robbing games for the “plot” of FIFA😔 Ronaldo = Ryuga = GOATS🐐
I don't know if you will ever see this but budda from ROR needs to be in the round table
I love it ! 😂😂
I'd pay to see CJ do an abridged series of the whole Metal Saga. Maybe Shogun Steel too.
Bro do kenpatchi from bleach or lelouche from code geas or yami from black clover on the round table
CJ if u ever step out the cartoon and anime scene for this series, u should do a vid on Ms Trenchbull from the movie Matilda.
this shit was amazing, brought back memories
Don’t forget about Reiji. Bro literally popped up just for Battle Bladers, but nobody knew how he got 50k Beypoints because he never participated in ANY of the challenge matches leading up to Battle Bladers.  His first match was against Hyoma and at first he didn’t seem like shit cuz his Bey, Poison Serpent, wasn’t doing shit to Aries so everyone was bored af. But then- Hyoma started to tweak. Mf made this man huff some of that dank kush and made him hallucinate snakes tying his ass down. And all this paranoia gave Reiji the upper hand to start going on the attack. It turns out, since the beginning of the fight- bro had been chipping off bits of Aries’ Metal Wheel and poisoning it making it less effective in battle. And this is where he reveals his true desires…bro wasn’t there just to defeat Hyoma, he was there to ABSOLUTLEY BREAK BOTH HIM AND ARIES. And you wanna know how he finishes this dude off?? With a *DARK MOVE*. The same shit Ryouga uses for L Drago and absolutely WASHES Aries and destroys it with no mercy. He made Hyoma ball like little bitch and get on his knees.
Seto Kaiba next?????
Aw hell nawh
His Him
Not gonna lie i enjoyed this video and the beyblade metal series ryuga was one of my favorite characters in it w vid.
Sheesh seeing Beyblade makes me hope to see Inazuma eleven.
Yep. We still got two more anime to analyze!! This shit ain't over!! ❤
where are the rest of the exibits??
As someone who's never watched Beyblade, this video has the energy of the Oden flashback, but he's the villain instead of an anti-hero turned hero.
We need to see the 2003 shredder
bitch I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
I know the video don't make you watch anime and true anime is just bayblade but it skyrocket when ryuga appears on screen
Plot armour always win
W vid man can't wait to see the next one. A man you got to add some more women to the round table the Lagoon Baddies be needing more friends.
I'm sorry but the (not) skip and Shannon is fkn hilariousss
Bro i think i know this guy my friend in roblox had the same user not display name the other thing
He also, gave tsubasa schizophrenia, went toe to toe with a god of destruction, one shotted the final boss of season 2, violated Gingka in season 2, violated gingka and ryuga at the same time in season 3, and refused to help gingka's gang save the world just to fight nemesis himself. (And some more violations here and there)
Also can ya cj the man gimee One about Equality man mash
Which beyblade is this ?
Fire vid cj but can u do one on Hao from shaman king
i mean...if we are talking villans....the D reaper gotta show up soon right
Tho rip ryuga and L-Drago
You know that if had Ldrago as kid, you was The GOAT + some edgy ass personality.
Ryuga is the goat bro, L-Drago Destroctor ( final form of L- Drago i think) fell in a volcano filled with lava and the bey was not even scratched
Yo just want to give you an absolute powerful dudes 1. Yogiri Takutou 2. Rimuru Tempest 3. Wang Ling 4. Jin Mori 5. Veldanava And more tho I'm not bothered
i forgot how dark mfb was holy shit - if this was not a kids show, this would get WILD
MY GLORIOUS KING *Straight glazing*
Remember, this all rooted from teeny tiny little fucking BEYBLADES
man crazy this wasnt even all of ryugas beat downs. remember when he disrespected anubis and throttled him into a mountain lmao
He was the only character from the new series that was really interesting.
I was obsessed with this guy lmao, his maniacal screaming and laughter are iconic
as an Italian I can confirm the Roman Empire was in fact founded on the art of Beyblade Warfare. Marcus Aurillieus himself even had a whole chapter dedicated to Beyblades in his book Meditations.
If you're doing Ryuga, then I have to ask... WHERE IS the SETO KAIBA??
11:14 😂😂😂
You did azula… I need an iroh episode ❤❤
He was suppose to win but the writers were diks and let Pegasus win
“I will not lose even if my opponent is a god I will defeat anyone who stands in my way, my name is Ryuga I reign over this world as the strongest the dragon emperor 🐉 himself”
Dawg make a asylum vid on hisoka bro put him in there immediately
Always a good day when CJ uploads. Never thought he'd do a video on Beyblade. XD
Funny video. However, Skip and Shannon (before Shannon walked away) was on Fox Sports (FS1), not ESPN. 😅
Nah the Plot had to rob this man he ascended the tax bracket
Let's go do more, bro
BRO I’VE NEVER CLICKED SO FAST IN MY LIFE.
Yall, like the video lmao
Please, cover someone from Shaman King. It's only 52 episodes and good LAWD there are so many black air force moments. We could choose Hao Asakura using a BASIC technique turning the second strongest character's main weapon to ash. Using, and let me reiterate this, nothing but *oxygen*
CJ got the Kahoot! music lololo
Day 4😭
So glad I grew up watching the Beyblade metal series. This man Ryuga was no joke.
Bro I clicked this video expecting no hype all I can say well Holy shit (I still think kai from the original series was cool to but hey😂)
9:39 *Damian Vs. Julian:*
Not even five minutes in and I already know this is going to be fire. Also good in adoption on lightning Drago that damn Beyblade, is a menace.
Epic
i came here purely to say one thing without watching the video free de la hoya solos ryuga ok cya
I have been waiting since day one for this but was like "nah beyblade is too old he would nev-" *actually falls out of chair from whiplash*
Can’t wait for part two because he becomes more of a demon 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro please part 2 man❤
The ending wasnt a robbery, it was grand larceny
God damn, Beyblade off the chain.       Just wanna say Accelerator and Mujin Park absolutely deserve a spot at the round table, especially Mujin. Man's a straight up menace from chapter 1 all the way to the end.
That’s my goat
Bro, Beyblade?? BEYBLADE?? Ryuga from Beyblade Metal Fusion that aired on Cartoon Network is sitting at the round table, but not Reverse-Flash? Honestly... I guess if there was any one Cartoon Network character that deserved to get here, it would probably be him. But I'm still waiting for the CW Reverse-Flash video!
CJ can you check out Adam smasher the black air Force activity monster he is round table material
Tysm cj beyblade metal was the best beyblade series
Hey can you please make an asylum video about this psycho clown that is named joker?
Bro I’m dying
Please do Asakura Hao from Shaman King. That dude belongs here
Ryuga is the GOAT!!
with episode 115 metal fury show down at the tower of bable count how many people charged in when you see a eagle eye view of them runing to the tower as they entered take away the 14 we see leave including tsubasa and kenta  after ryuga destroyed the tower that plus 1 aka the guy at the top is howmany people he killed when the tower fell my count is 56-14+1=43 bodies/dead people
4:29 to 4:41, when I see  Traditional Chinese Architecture lol i just start glazing
Loved your take on ryuga my fav character pls make a part 2 🙏
TOKYO REVENGERS SEASON 2‼️😤
god damn, i think i need to watch this bay blade run
Bro Bay Blade is getting too serious it's making me take back my line "Bay Blade was never this serious" 😭
I watched the entirety of Beyblade metal fusion and the second season and Ryuga only loses once and it’s to jengka
Do janemba when you got time he is different
BRO WHEN IT WAS TAKEN OFF NETFLIX I WANTED TO KILL MYSELF I  WAS ONLY LIKE 4💀
I swear, Ryuga is one of yujiro's sons, the amount of disrespect is only explainable by blood relation
Diablo Nemesis violating L Drago was crazy.
Yo where tf is the video for guts? None of these bitches got shit on the struggler Fucking bayblade before the black swordsman

Do one video on ultra vegito
Finally someone who gets how strong ryuga truly is, my favorite character the in beyblade metal saga
I was waiting for this one beyblade is that serious
I think it’s time    *bring forth ganondorf*
RYUGA is the original "him"
Yoo CJ when are you gonna do Hisoka  from Hunter X Hunter
The fact I tried recreating the shit in this anime when I was young 💀
As a kid I actually had nightmares about ryuga
I loved just how ridiculous this guy was for a beyblade show.
Ryuga has to be one of the most underrated anime villains of all time. Blood stole an ancient powerful Bey, packed up the MC’s dad, ended the MC’s winning streak, defeated 40 trained masters at once, defeated 99 opponents at once, impaled Kiyo Ya, and destroyed the stadium, possibly with civilians inside. And it’s all happening in a kids show? This man is a menace!  Also, don’t rush with part 2, CJ. Take your time if you need to.
Look at mashle now
People finally finding out truly how much of a menace Ryuga really was. 😤🔥
Please put General Grievous from the 2003 clone wars on the round table
yeaaaah we need a part 2 we still got 2 more searies masters and fury
Y'all get ready for next week, it's finna be a banger.
7:43 Song name?
you should do an episode on mahs from mashle magic and muscles
This man is so cold we got an 18 minute video for a single exhibit 😭😭😭
You gonna do Itachi Uchiha next bro
CJ’s Ryuga impression is damn near spot on 😭
I love you covering the menaces but you may need to calculate and quantify the Power Of Friendship or what I like to call "The IchiGoku Syndrome" because main characters always seem to win with that BS power of friendship. That plot armor seems to save every protagonist anime hero.
Yo happy belated birthday to you my boy i just found so sorry
The dragon emperor oldest goat in history
Your Ryuga impression fills me with so much nostalgia
Another goat lost to power of friendship 😭🙏🏻
Could someone tell me the soundtrack that sounded alike creepy breathing
Is no one going to tell him about Spectra and Helios?
You better drop the other part. 😂
Ains Oal Goan overlord when?
15:20 didn’t know this was also yu-gi-oh
Do one of Yuuichi
At this point I'm looking forward to either Specter or Mascaraed to pop up soon. Bakugan had some menaces as antagonist. Loving season 3 of the roundtable
Me who hasn't watched Beyblade since the original: It's Beyblade, how dangerous could this guy be.  Ryuga: Goes Indiana Jones to get his Bey, leaves a man for dead in a volcano, mercs 40 elites, puts two bitches in a coma, impales a guy, blows up the stadium repeatedly as a flex, violates 8 bitches to fuel his Bey.  Since when did Beyblade of all things have a god damn body count?
My lil bro will never know the OG Beyblade. He thinks Beyblade: Burst is tough😭
3:31 Bro did the Sasuke entrance
L-Drago, the war crime top💀
Part 2 🙏
I love how cj can hype up anything even a short ass throwing spinning tops at ppl
Nah Ryuga a bitch he’d get bodied by 90% of the Black Air Force. He’ll give Revy or Yujiro 10 seconds with him, little todoroki lookin ass would be saw dust. Cool can your bayblade stop you from getting shot?
Cj we need a video made of the new anime (Nija Kamui)
Whoop dat trick! Salute!
I mean to be fair, if Ldrago feeds/becomes-stronger from negative emotions, why can’t Pegasus feed/get-stronger from positive emotions (which includes friendship).
250 wins, 2 losses, 0 draws, and 10 No Contests.
Why did hitler have a x on his face?
I hope he does another part for ryuga bc if I remember currently there more seasons with ryuga being a menace
10:48 analysis where does the crowd disappear
he needs to do one for fafnirs owner in burst i cant remember dudes name
4:11 So, we're not counting the 100 bey battle Jenga did at the beginning of the series or are you only counting main character interactions
NAPOLEON 1:56
Nominating Kazuya mishima for review in the table
I remember what this mad lad does next and if he’s already cooking in just the first video oh boy he’s about to flip the script with the exhibit B and C.
Ive seen so many of these ryuga vids inspired by cj, glad he saw em
Yes, this game is actually about spinning tops
Since you're doing Ryuga, it's be insane to one day see a Supreme King Zarc breakdown from YGO Arc-V, or even the Supreme King Judai from GX. I'll keep my hopes up for that fateful day that may never come lol
The only goat it’s Sacha in pokemon top tier I’m out and only goku can be a goat
I am wondering about how putting the SpongeBob music over the power of friendship moments made my previous comment apparently deleted. So I am making this new on to let people know.
the finals theme at 15:31 was a sublime touch.
RYGUU THE GOAT 🐉
All you have to do is upload an already easy video and you be dragging this shit like my nuts on your forehead 😂😂😂
Happy Belated Birthday fam...I remembered this anime
Kiyotaka Ayanokoji has to be invited to the table
If Ryuga can make it then so can and should Seto Kaiba. You look up "Disrespect" in the dictionary and find out Kaiba owns the whole book
Go ahead and release the next part now please
So ya "crazy" table plays wit bea blades 😂😂😂.  Holdnon mosses was there. Im watching
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Bro I can't wait for part 2 when you show him fucking hand spinning and winning
Honestly looking back, goddamn one of my favorite childhood shows is actually hardcore af 💀
A dragon that speaks like a goat 😂😂😂😂
They ain't got s*** on the original blade breakers
2:05 to 2:10 is just lord this man already cooking
Cj Dachamp is to anime what RussianBadger is to games, RussianBadger can make any game enjoyable to watch and Cj Dachamp can make any Anime enjoyable to watch
9:59 whoop that trick whoop that trick 😭🤣👏🏽 .
Thank you, these videos make my life bearable.
DEFINITELY need to do Marik after Ryuga
Bayblade MIGHT be that serious 😭😭🙏
You HAVE to make a part 2 this season was before ryuga learned not to lose himself to el drago. Bro got a MAJOR boost from that the series after the next one HE GETS EVEN STRONGER and he settles the score with jinga. Bro beat the mc and kept the record.
Finally the beyblade GOAT. when he died beyblade lost its touch. Also L drago speaking goatness😂
Ryuga put the “hood” in childhood.
HES THE GOAT
patch notes
Cj neighbors must be going crazy
ONLY EXIBIT 1 AYO WTF!!!!!!!
Bro I have a request could you do a video on senator Barbra from dr. Stone
If you guys really think about it Ryuga was really Madara before Madara. In the way he is presented power wise and how he's written out. Cuz he's written to be the most OP character only to die once basically a God Appears
Time to let this man cook woooo let go
I can’t wait for him to drop next
i bet the next video is title: ryuga: the GOAT strikes back/ the return of GOAT.
LETS PLAY A LITTLE GAME I MADE
Whoop that trick!!
Man's really said "WHERE'S THE REF" I'm sure He got blown off the finals arena platform to the floor below from that *PRESSURE*
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16 KJV  Jesus died for you sins and he loves you, turn from you sin and repent. To give your life to christ confess to him your sins and confess and belive in your heart that he died for your sins and came back to life.
Crazy how CJ boos Gingka for absorbing the power of others when Ryuga has been doing that the entire time.
Cj caring the black air force energy 😤
Honesty never understood this anime lol but it sure as hell was entertaining to watch as a kid ngl
Should probably do Terumi/Hazama next. Guy takes “trolling” to a different level. His powers literally work the same was as L-Drago💀
Finally bro covers bayblade 💀
RYUGA is the GOAT & Cj Dachamp is the GOAT!!!!! 🐐This video was hilarious 🤣
Finally a ryuga post bro that's my guy
Drop it soon, this just a fraction of his screen time. Let’s not forget how he went toe to toe with a fucking god
5:04 ALL GINGKA SEES IS RED!
there is a thing called " the blader's spirit", and that directly influences how strong you and your bey can be. so its not " the power of friendship" its more like a DBZ spirit bomb . they are literally sending their spirit to ginjka to make him stronger.
Me and my brother have this running gag of where he'd say a joke, and 5 years later it becomes a meme And honestly this tradition is still going strong
Great video
Cj I hope you see this but next video idea eg black air force energy characters Teen gohan and beast gohan
Can you do the 2003 tmnt shredder?
Cj dachamp can you do ulquiorra from bleach, he deserves to be on round table
we need junko enoshima the ultimate menace
we need junko enoshima the ultimate menace
we need junko enoshima the ultimate menace
we need junko enoshima the ultimate menace
THAT WAS ONLY A 😲
Ninja kamui for the round table
don’t mock Christianity 2:00God loves you all and He always will love God back
Cj this was a fire ass vid!!🔥🔥 You have to do eminence in shadow. That mc has some black air force activity as well !
Where the heck is Tyson when we need him most 😭😂
But could he beat tyson tho lol. blade breakers still goated team
Shadow from Eminence In Shadow next PLEASE. ShaDOW CAN COOK. Source: TRUST ME (The anime)
Watch the new season of Tokyo Revengers it been almost a year😱 and that list better dam not be finished bc I know sukuna is above Madara (no hate)
Ryuga is mentally unstable
YO CJ WE NEED A ONE PIECE OR FIRE FORCE VIDEO
Drago got rusty
I did not expect Beyblade to appear on this channel
Finally someone is speaking about the absolute MENEACE Ryuga is
Ryuga realized he got stuck with a partner named "L" Drago and proceded to make it everyone else's problem.
He got 173 bodies please put him in the first row
Yo Cj! We need Mash Burndead from Mashle Magic and Muscles on the roundtable! Mash is pure black airforce energy!
Bro I got like 50 different accounts and they all subscribed to you
yall maybe beyblade rly was that serious...
As soon as bro said exhibit A my jaw dropped

Cj where jin wuu from solo leveling at he a best he ez kill ryuga
Doffy gotta be S+++
To all the people who ain't seen Metal Masters or Metal Fury, lemme tell you something! Ya'll ain't seen half of the straight Black Air Force energy this dude exudes! He's HIM. He is the Toji Fushiguro of Beyblade!
Is guts ever going to come to the round table of black Air Force activities?
Wait till you see meteo L drago
Exhibit c will be legendary
Question why is Batman not on the black Air Force table
Christ bless you, bro is a menace
Lol
Do lui shirosagi , shu kuronai, or free de la Hoya 😅
Where are the parents
DO IT CJ I NEED MORE
Fun fact. In the sub, in order to provoke Ginga to anger, he says something to the effect of "Your father was a weak piece of shit so it's no surprise that you are too.
Hey Cj, ik this is really not like an anime but you should add another character to the table of black force energy.. Desmond from rdc
The fact this man said that was exhibit a 🤣🤣🤣🤣
God daym Beyblade was this savage, how could I forget, give this man Ryuga his Accolades he’s a Savage Legend!
the "Power of friendship" makes want to vomit not only my toe nails but myself inside out.
CJ is back!
Its funny how he said spoliers on a show that came out in like 2008
Bro I love all of these trials you do!!! Every single video got me cracking da F up 😂😂😂 Thanks CJ! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼

Ryuga was my favorite from the Beyblade metal series my boy was nothing but a menace the whole show and LDrago was hard
0:00 nah bro did a final Kamehameha

W video bro
Clearly this guy hasn't heard of Lord Shaggy he is the undisputed goat
22 on trending is crazy Good job CJ Kenpachi is going to tie Yujiro at least
We still waiting for another baki vud
The referees are dead lets be real  And WHERE THE DUCK WHEN THE CUCK AND LITTLE CHILDREN HAVE THE POWER TO COMMIT MASS MURDER U TELL THEM TO DO THERE HOMEWORK THEY RUN UR POKETS
Nah we need part 2 now😭
Half of the footage u used were from sonic unleashed and dragon ball xenoverse 1 or 2
One of the reasons I stopped watching Beyblade... The actual villains with power were inexplicably done in so dirty
oh man, i forgot how much AF1 energy this show had
I know cj’s gonna bring it up in the next video but I can’t be the only one that remembers when bro spun El Drago with his fingertips and still whooped everybody😂
I was not ready to be excited for a beyblade video today BUT IM HERE BITCH
this nigga getting better at comedic editing 😭 im dying out here
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"My Parlay "That shit had me dead.😂
Ryuga pulled a "Madara" fighting Subasa
Wake up babe cjdachamp jus dropped
Only watching cause of cj. Never got how watching tops bump each other, regardless of anmie magic sounds lame as hell.
What's going on in Beyblade, my man? Where's my boy Dranzer at?
Dang, I remember Beyblade! But I do not remember Ryuga.. is he like a new character or something?
Yoooooo I didn't know you watched the 2010  Beyblade Sirius
2 days have passed and you already got 105k+ likes 😮
Ryuga cool and all but we all forgetting the goat run Brooklyn went on in the OG series.
6:21 that voiceover line unironically goes hard
Cj i am convinced the announcer with the red bandana is a multiverse being since he was in the og and thats in a different universe!
17:31 He got jumped...
CJ Video idea Jiren dbs
Drop the next vid
It’s hilarious how gingka only has that one win over him. Like he lost every time the fought after and before. So when you think about it his only win against rhubarb was a fluke
This man is master violator no question about it.
5:01 is wild😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
yoooooooooooooooo, nice
Skip and shannon 😂😂
Cap 🧢 this is not going to be out in the next month
The Glock loading sound for putting Drago in the spinner needs to be added to every Beyblade scene ever
more beyblade plz
Man I miss this show mannnnnn it was my childhood
"Whoop that trick!"   That sent me 😂😂😂😂
Thank you for acknowledging Ryuga's greatness. 👍🏿
Gojo black Air Force erengy check please
Please can you make a video about Beyblade burst series?
It is a hot while that i dont hear about Ryuga, that man was a nightmare back then
Trick Williams reference??? Goated reference for a goated character. Goated video
This mf gotta do Shadow from The Eminence In Shadow😂
Make a Kyoya video the real general
I think acnologia needs a trial
White hair+Purple powers=Gojo’s son???
Ryuga da goat love respect gou put on his legacy but one of the best menaces reverse flash dont got a video yet
bay blade is not that deep😭😭💀
How is this sport still legal 🗿💀😂
I idolized Ryuga when I was a kid bro was that guy I always did that one thing he did with his jacket
Ryuga to Sukuna Hokore, Omae wa Tsuyoi.
ryuga deserves an s+++ teir, because he is the biggest GOAT in any kids frendly show. hes the rep of that area, like how kid buu is the most, and how aizen is the biggest brain of the black air force activity
If Beyblade characters are eligible then you have to do a video on Marik from the OG Yu-Gi-Oh!
Bro only went through the first season of this character
Can we do a TOKYO GHOUL episode
So hype for the masters and fury version of ryuga trial cus this man a straight demon
Cj you got a lot of sons that want to be you
Bro is so legendary that if ppl were to realize how atrocious beyblade was then he could’ve been like co president
CJ is the G.O.A.T and thanks for the videos man.
DUDE YES
he needs to get on masquerade ! stat hes on demon time to on a shounen anime ! lmao
1.58 , u can see napoleon wearing bey blade as honor badge on his cloth
I think I forgot just how destructive this shit was during my childhood. Once the words Let it rip were said you know shit gonna go down holy moly
I appreciate the Sonic Unleashed references with the soundtrack.
Ryuga was the original Sukuna😭
Who is waiting for ragna crimson video  👇
One of my childhood series had a character with black air force activity the whole time, I was not expecting that (also w8 what happens to ryuga in the metal masters and metal fury arcs)
Ryuga da type to eat da noodles without cookin em😭
Bro no cpp but when he blew through Ole girl my wifi stopped!!!!! .......yeah like plyboi said fnk on his thot up in canyon!!!! 😂😂😂
Ryuga always wanted the smoke , goated character
I know I'm late, but any chance we get a Seto Kaiba video? That man just radiates Black Air Force Activity.
6:21 The way he screamed “LET IT RIP” though was too perfect 🤣👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Great vid looking forward to the part 2. You should do an Air Gear video one day.
Mann wait till he get to metal masters😂
Absolute great video. I hope Pokémon get some representation there’s gotta some characters to join the table.
bro, Ryuga violated Hikaru so hard she became a receptionist
Remember its about bay blade's?💀
Brother, I can’t stress how many fucking memories you’ve brought back for me. In grade school, me and my friends would sneak beyblade stadiums and tops into school and duke it out as much as we could during recess. So the fact that you’re discussing the GOAT of the show and game feels a real special kind of way❤️
Cj u better drop ds dont b bs
lowkey you should do a blue lock video
You Should do kengan ashura kengan ashura
I still cannot believe that CANONICALLY Moses PARTED THE RED SEA with A FUCKING BEYBLADE.
Nah 100k likes in 2 days is crazy we need that part 2
666k view on this is crazy and well deserved for this case specifically.
This man Showed no mercy in this show But it was So Goood!
YO CJ WHEN WE GETTING A GRIFFITH VIDEO
666k 😮
666k views as of now
Is majin gonna dethroned?
Gotta do marik next
It’s been a while since I’ve seen Beyblade. So when I saw the thumbnail and title I went “oh cool it’s the guy from Beyblade.” And then I saw the opening clip of him blasting open an arena and had to ask myself “This is the guy from BEYBLADE right!?”
You should see Tokyo revengers season two and three the is a lot of air Force activity
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
You gotta do Gojo bro was on timing
Yes sir whoop that trick
23 on trending is crazy
Bro you gotta talk about the time ryuga fought a GOD at the end of the anime
He is an absolute menace 😈
The og sukuna
BeyBlade getting some love? You love to see it
Not 9:27 bro. Yoooo CJ going dumb with these. Never miss 😂😂😂🤘🏾
Hitler probably let it rip on the jews
Yoooo I didn’t know Beyblade went that hard
Low tier gods son right here
Bro we about to get a new leader for the roundhouse …
Can you do mash from mashle
Ryuga has the weirdest voice actor but best storyline
Since we adding bladers should we add phi and lui
The way I had a crush on this guy when I was younger
I remember watching this years ago
Yooo, one of the songs was not there, cj, the one where he blew up the building
yo do a shredder vid for the black air force table pls
My nigga Ryuga was beyond robbed at the end
Cj need to try and drop it tomorrow frfr this be fire af I love the news edit
Meanace to society.
He had it then went soft💀
I think L drago was standing on bidness
Bro always have da best edits for anything part of da videos never fails keep it up
I can't believe this is the only beybalde show I started watching and dropped because I couldn't stand the voice actor of the protagonist. Ryugga voice actor was perfect though. But ginka had that soft pussy voice. Nothing like the true 🐐 Tyson. To go from Tyson and Kai to Ginka Voice actor should be crime punishable by jail time.
Never in my wildest dreams did I think he'd hit beyblade. Bro please check out the other menaces, this show was one of my favorites I'm telling ya
Genghis Kong 😂
Yoo you gotta do the little girl from the dark gathering. She must be add to the BAET @cjdachamp
Bro is the reason why me and my brother ***BOTH*** have L-drago. Literally just because of this guy. He’s the only beyblade we didn’t disrespect.
When ryuga died I was so sad
Where hies seat at
Fuck u bro.. I gotta wait now.. your content is Crack lol. I watched madara 10x, escanor 12x and broly 6x... with others on multiple  views.. love yo content, cj truly dachamp
Great video! love your stuff!!! you should do cid kageno from the eminence in shadows!
14:51 naw he used the mutumbo
when you said that we weren't even close to done my jaw dropped irl ngl
kenta tops ryuga????
Lol 😂 Ryuga being the Ultimate Goat
Just to be clear ryuga didnt lose to gingka he was clapping the mc again and would have won again but the power of friendship got involved and because of that l drago took contol and beacuse of l dragos mindless rampage and destruction l drago lost to the power of friendship but in the end ryuga was clapping mc again when the battle involve just him and mc and when l drago lost ryuga was having none of that shit he trained he got rid of the dark power that was to weak and mindless and was getting in his way of cooking everybody and then became one with l drago and its true power and kept on clapping mc and everyone else every time he was around so yea nothing saved or can save gingka from the dragon emperor not ever mc plot armor because ryuga was him the goat the demonic menace the dragon emperor himself thats the deal
we are BLESSED with this video 😭
I Watched Beyblade: Metal Fusion/Masters And Fury!! As A Gen Z 1999 born and raised Male I Say absolute Yes!! I AM ABSOLUTELY HAPPY YOUR your covering The Greatest Black air force ENERGY menace OF BEYBLADE from my childhood: RYUGA!!  1:36 - 2:22 WOW I FORGOT THIS WAS A THING!!  5:50 - 6:50 OH HECKS NO I REMEMBER THIS HAPPENED AND I AM GLAD YOUR BRINGING IT UP.  7:07 - 7:37 I REMEMBER THIS TOO!!  9:35 - 10:45, 10:50 - 11:18 Not My Baby's Mother from childhood #1!!! From that day on until the last show/season of beyblade OG she Has PTSD. I NEVER knew she made her mother. A promise cause I didn't see that scene.  12:21 - 13:41 Ryuga Vs Kyouya!!  15:00 - 15:25 spoiler: Doji Fights Gingka's dad who came back from the grave like a Phoenix!! (his beyblade is a Phoenix based beyblade!
EXIBIT A😧 ?!
Do you think you can make a video on Shigaraki from MHA some day?
Me: Damn, the video gonna end soon, where's Exhibit B? "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes...Exhibit A." OH. I genuinley forgot that this was just the BEGINNING of the Metal Saga, and Ryuga damn near bodied the entire cast.
Now that I'm thinking about it. There are a few mfers in this series, specifically who need their own episodes. Damien is definitely one of em.
this guy thought i wouldn't notice thay he plays dbl because he said zenkai boost
I dont get a thing about beyblade in my childhood i thought it was cool as f back then but now looking back i was like mose split the red sea WITH WHAT
You gotta make a vid about hxh so many things to do
Dbz broly not being on the leaderboard is a crime 💀
The Parlay took me out LMAO
Was that bay blades?
OG MENACE RIGHT HERE, BRO RAN THE WHOLE SQUAD AND MORE
I love how we love to talk about ryuga but we ignore Lui from beyblade burst
I’m so glad people are talking about beyblade it’s warms my heart to see my childhood show get more recognition 😭
THIS ENTIRE THING WAS ONLY EXHBIT A?! NAH THERE HAS TO BE A PART 2 RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Even if its a kids show your parents are still going bye bye in anime
18:02 WERE NOT DONE?!!? BRO WHAT
Tyson and Dragoon would have put Ryuga to sleep.
Bro was really him u jus had to be there 🤷🏾‍♂️
6:36: Nigga be for real: T_T 7:22 THIS DUDE HAS A MVP!!!😨😨😨
Some of these beyblade battles really put niggas in a coma at some point.
that wasent a gailck gun it was a final kamehameha 💀
Not the Kawhi laugh, lmao!
Actually, it makes perfect sense that the power of friendship was able to beat that blade. You said it yourself, the thing feeds off of and grows stronger from negative emotions. Having that many people there giving out good vibes probably wrecked it harder than a taco buffet does to colons.
We need something hard asf.  . Bring back the  BladeBreakers and make them tag team partners   Ryuga vs Kai would be amazing.    Even more would be if Kai and Ryuga teamed up to fight Tyson & ginka
He's back heeeeees back
Beyblade is never this serious to the point your murdering people, snatching souls and commiting MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS OF TERRORISM
This anime was the shit growing up
tf happened to beyblade last time i watched was burst
Which I mean metal fury
Fucking script writers always saving the MC from catching that Eric fade
if i could like something twice I would
DO JUNKO ENOSHIMA
He was the goat until the final season Rip legend
I once missed school because I was too distracted watching Beyblade. No other anime has ever made me do that. That’s how you know this shit goes hard af.
That's crazy bro what about Tokyo revengers exhibit c
Ah yes the og bay blade and we’re talking about the very essence of black Air Force energy Ryuga now this is what I’ve been waiting for
This is the anime bout beyblades btw.
“LET IT RIP!!!!!”
YOOO U DID MY SUGGESTION THX
Next week gonna be LIT over here. Ryuga is RIDICULOUS, and I love that about him. Lol.
Yoga just is him he just that guy 😊
W BANGERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
AND THAT'S WHY HIS THE GOAT
yk u hyped when cj drop
Ryuga makes sukuna shit himself.
FINALLY PEOPLE ARE APPRECIATING HOW BADASS RYUGA IS
Exhibit B: Meteo L-Drago, let’s run the fades 🐉
What is bayblade on rn💀
Ima say this beyblade ain’t supposed to be that serious
Me: Damn, why is CJ taking forever to drop another video? CJ: Cause I'm out here giving y'all Hollywood type of editing, special effects, and voiceovers.
happy #23 on trending! (Currently don't flame me).
Day 2 of asking for a Bayonetta video
That part with not Skip Bayless and not Shannon Sharpe was peak comedy and you imitated everyone’s voices perfectly ❤😂
Sooooo that means bakugan might get a video right? 👀
PART 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fun fact: Did you know that Ryuga  has a BROTHER in the series? Yes, his name is Ryuto and he is seen in Metal Fury when he fights Gingka. This is in the manga though. In the anime they make it so that they aren’t brothers, so none of the characters comment on his similar he looks to Ryuga. He also wears a similar kind of outfit, and interestingly, the red highlight in his hair is on the right side, while Ryuga’s is on the left - symbolic of the direction each of their beyblades spin in.   Someone else pointed out that in the manga, Ryuga is actually hundreds of years old because he’s a reincarnation of the original dragon emperor which explains why he acts like a dragon and why he does strange stuff like teleportation and bringing out L-Drago all of the time.   Ryuto might be his descendant.   from the Dragon Clan, like Sakyo from Zero-G. Funnily enough, Ryuto works as a treasure hunter, so it’s not surprising that Ryuga would have the same skills and be able to steal L-Drago from the village.  Ryuga and Gingka beys both come from the same star fragment, but they landed in two different places. This is why Gingka and Ryuga seem to have a “sixth sense” for the presence of the other and why they’ll always be rivals, at least narratively speaking.
“RYUGA: The Undisputed GOAT”  G: Grimiest O: of A: All T: Time 😭😭😭😭😭
Come on CJ I know you doing a supply and demand thing, but bruh get some staff or something to get at least 2 a month... Plz..
me looking for the cage holding pickle un the round table
Keep up the great work cj
Make a black air force energy video on chuuya from bsd pls
And this is just him in Metal Fusion. This doesn’t involve his time in Metal Masters when he pulled up with a “Meteor shower” for his first battle in the series. His destroying a “FLOATING CITY” from land. Or his absolutely toying with his opponent in the world championship (seriously it’s the most viewed episode on YouTube “The Dragon Emperor descends”)
Ryuga straight up gave Hikaru and Tsubasa PTSD, especially with Tsubasa. I ain't spoiling what happened in Metal Masters, but iykyk
I’ve BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!
Never forget how he disrespected generic Hades Inc bladers by launching L-Drago with a f***ing hand
im sooo happy ur covering ryuga. i feel like everyone sleeps on him because no one remembers how good he was when they watched beyblade as a kid. BROS THE OG SUKUNA LIKE HES LIKE THAT
Theres like 8 bill in property damage
How is this guy not in jail
Ah, my childhood and the reason I love beyblade. Heck, I even have Lightning L-Drago in my collection.
When you gonna do HIM from Powerpuff Girls
17:51 my jaw dropped when he said this
Mfs who call ryuga da goat clearly ain’t watch the show 😂 there’s a dude that makes ryuga look like pocket change
Next season, He went onto to train Kenta which is weakest of all them but becomes stronger and more technical than them.
I'm still waiting for Mugen to get his trial
Oke oke i spoke to soon was still watching the vid yh he does appear again n again
10:01 I heard Codenamesuper, Olawoolo and Phillyonmars
Didnt he have volcanic LDrago??
Ryuga blowing up the city
The Dragon Emporer was the first Madara of beyblade i came too🤣🤣
Beyblade being put on trial was something i did not expect at all, but remembering all the hate crimes that Ryuga commited  during all the series made it really easy  to understand how much of a menace he was
I know it aint a anime character, but please make a video on randy orton in his prime
waiting for tr S2
How tf you make this series even better!!?!?!?!?!? The way my jaw dropped when exhibit B and C dropped
As I got older I just realized it was just dragon ball the whole time there are people getting PTSD from beyblade battles in the show
never thought the day is today that Cj cover Ryuga my first fictional crush lmao
Yooooo back in the day I actually had THE OG L-drago beyblade toy! And a BUNCH of others from the show
BROOOOOO Beyblade Metal Fusion *WAS.* *THE.* *SHIT!*
AOCJ how come you haven’t made shredder a trial I mean you done so much horrendous stuff. There ain’t no way that you can’t. Just ignore it not to mention the original version of him. We’re all menaces.
man i love cjs videos they are so good and well put together
Dawg ITS JUST SOME FUCKING TOYS HOW THEY DOIN THIS
No matter how much you hype him He's still a character in Beyblade 😂 for a spinning top will not conquer the world but will trip up your parents in the hallway
Why Ryuga Fanboys are so dick riding at this point chill out man the cartoon
No way you're posting a video Ryuga. You're my new favorite Youtuber.
I’m so glad people are putting some respect on my boy’s name
11:50 I can’t stop watching this this shit is to hilarious
Day five asking for a fuhrer ugly vid
More parts please also video about the Menga Events Evan crazier Bauch ginga and where rayuga whole other beasts in power
Ryuga just the best anime character oat ion care what anyway says cry me a river
bro got 2 more arcs and is already a menace
cant forget that time he cooked some mofos by spinning his bey with just his hand
9:22  the most menacing shit i’ve ever seen bro
I like how you all just steal each others videos and regurgitate it 24/7
He gets TWO videos? That's how you know he's a true menace.
Cannot wait to see the fate of that one artist bitch with the peacock that is one of the greatest violations in this series and the reason I still remember it fondly
W vid
Director be careful not to choke on your aspirations
Dio schould be on the leaderboard too. He made a mum eat her own child
Can't wait for pt 2 and pt 3.
Beyblade was a huge part of my childhood. So a video recognizing the true G.O.A.T feeds my soul.
Waiting on Kenpachis video
HES THE ORIGINAL CHILDRENHOOD MENACE!!!!
Is it just me, or does Hikaru's mom look like Tobias from the Pokemon anime?
Aye I appreciate you putting the respects to my man the dragon emperor Ryuga, I got to have the other parts so you better like the video.
Its just Beyblade Bro
I know they aren't nearly as Black Airforce as Ryuga but when I was a kid I compared him to Masquerade from Bakugan and Marik from Yugioh.
ay its this crazy MF!!
Can't believe I'm late to this (it's only by a day but still)
Bro was really on those Sonic OSTs! Zero Gravity's ost is underrated fr.
Don’t get our hopes up, but I hope you follow through with those TBDs Champ. Zaraki is a menace fr fr
What’s good nygga” got me dying 😭😭😭
CJ should have played Whoop that Trick and have Booker T in the background.
Love to see beyblade getting the love it deserves, grew up on this show
Ryuga has been glazed a lot now that I remember beyblade.
The best part ryuga is the strongest in the show besides a evil  god
Finaly i never expected you to make a video about the Goat from Blay blade Ryuga
Request for Most Disrespectful Moments in Anime History: Hades Kerbeks Vs Gravity Destroyer
I'd never thought I'd watch a bey blade video...
If Ryuga's score so High with just exhibit A, he may just be the Round Tables real MVP/Prime minister of Black Air force Energy!
F from alphabet lore Day 1
Pin this  There is a reason why I used to watch beyblade cuz of Ryuga.  Apparently he was set to come back in Shotgun Steel 2 as a main villain. Most badass thing is about the plot line of the story. Ryuga apparently was inherited by other dimensional being after his assumed death in anime. Then he came back with a bey called Snipe Ldrago and fcked all over Shotgun steel. Directors and writers were ready to do this but audience did not wanted it.
This was not that serious  that man has more black air force energy dare I say then yugiro
1:51 Good call to put a 'x' on Hit- i mean the autrian painter yea
you Have to do Gingka bro he 1v100
What’s the music background you use it sounded like Dragon ball
The Goat is also the funniest character as he did not give 2 shits to anyone. Like metal fusion tyuga was straight disrespecting people left and right.
nah fax happy people making beyblade vids now Ryuga was the goat RIP.
And here I thought this was a kids anime, but it was a series of "How-to Be A Menace to Society: Metal Tops Edition" educational videos.
Next part please! This was awesome!!!
FINALLY THE GOAT THE GREATEST TO DO IT
Nah where kobe at
Kratos do a kratos
Goat
Ryuga the fuckin Roast master cause he knows it boosts his blade called L-Drago😂😂
9:33 I legit forgot how dirty they did my girl after this.
Imagine Moses yelling "LET IT RIP" as he splits the Red Sea😂😂😂😂
Ryuga is one of the few examples of the "Invincible Villain" trope done right. Bro is OP, an absolute f**king menace and he KNOWS IT! Let's also not forget how he violated and traumatized Tsubasa so badly, the dude developed an entire split personality in the next season.   Bro is the best character of Beyblade Metal Fusion.
That was only exhibit A? Nah, Ryuga can't be...the...ULTIMATE HOOD NIZZA!? Can he?
this is the G.O.A.T THE MOFO G.O.A.T
The glazing is insane!
Do mash from mashle plz i beg😫😫😫
Ah yeah. I can see why people wanna see this guy fight Tai Lung in a Death Battle now.
I WATCHED THIS SHOW WHEN I WAS A BABY!!!
Ryuga is the best antihero turned full on legend character to ever exist animated fiction hands down, putting aside that his jap va is none other than Kenjiro Tsuda. Rayuga always been what Vegeta should have been in db series. Love you CJ keep it up homes Edit: Wait until Cj covers the rest of Ryugas achievements, this shit hype.
Considering that L Drago is basically made of pure black Air Force energy I feel like that says something about ryuga  doesn’t it. Great job on this video. I think I can speak for everybody that I look forward to the next part of this. I’ll be for real when I saw that this was just exhibit a i’m scared for the next part considering that I have watched this show and I know that ryuga  doesn’t play around so this is going to be something for me to look forward to
i dont see pickle in the leaderboard ?
What you couldn't get a picture of asura from asura's  wrath 1:26
i do appreciate the sonic unleashed music that games sound track is top tier
I don't know who my Beyblade GOAT is Ryuga or Brooklyn.  Brooklyn was out there sending dudes to the hospital without even training, he didn't decide to actually training until he took his first L.  Edit: Then again it might actually be Ryuga because he's one of the full people I've seen in an anime not get nerfed when he's no longer the final boss, he was still more powerful than the final boss when his time was up.
16:05, If you can call the writers making it a point that Ryuga’s beyblade is powered by negativity so that the main character can beat it using the literal power of friendship, then sure, he got robbed.  Still the fact that this is a beyblade character that’s not only fighting tournaments, but actually destroying stadiums multiple times is impressive.
L-Drago sounds like the name of a Mexican wrestler
Beyblade is not that serious 🔥🔥🔥😭😭😭 mfs are packing eachother up over spinning tops
Cj we need a part 2 NOW🤣🤣🤣
Ye this guy was a beast made me want to get L  drago for myself
🗿🗿
17:38 song ?
CJ PLEASE DO A TRIAL FOR MALWARE FROM BEN 10
This… was only… EXHIBIT A!
Bro your video is number 23 on trending right now!!
That skip and shannon was on point he always be hating😂
So, he's a Latina-Japanese baddie😎😏💥 because of EL drago 🤣
Well dang, the government really is listening to us. I said I like beyblade and this pops up 🗿
I especially like how he got the vegeta treatment in later seasons
Bro testosterone is made of black timberline
17:07 😂😂😂😂 CAN WE GET A TECH!!! BEY INTERFERENCE OR SOMETHING!!!
Bro the editing in this video was GOD TIER
omgggggg'
Maybe do Mashle next
FINALLYVMY GOAT RAYUGA IS FIBALLY ENTERING THE ROUND TABLE OF BLACK AIRFORCE ENERGY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ryuga losing to the power of friendship was like watching Vegeta get hoed in Dragon Ball, Madara getting stopped in Naruto, and Kai from Kung Fu Panda 3 losing. Bad scriptwriting and plot armor is what won the battle, because realistically, all those black air force menaces could’ve easily clapped their respective universes.
Ryuga vs tsubasa in metal fury was legit the most badass fight i have ever scene. His theme music literally gave me chills.
Finally you made a video about ryuga hes a fucking menace
Day one of asking for an Aku from samurai Jack video. I think he deserves a spot at the round table.
yokai watch,digimon,yugioh,bakugan next 👀 fire vid as always pin plz 🙏🏼
There's been a resurgence of the Beyblade Metal Series lately because of people bringing up the good ol days again, especially goated characters like Ryuga.  So to see CJ acknowledging him brings a smile in my face even more..
WHOOP THAT TRICK WHOOP THAT TRICK
Do an episode on mugen from samurai champloo 🙏
This mf is him bro he got every single energy  out there he is the goat but because of some dumb friendship is power knowledge he got defeated like bro what at least make it sense get the mc a power up in a better way then friendship is power bullshit 💀🤦‍♂️  All that aside this was a great video as always 🔥🔥🔥
Ryuga is top 3 best beybladers in the franchise n og
15:15
15:12
LETS GO
We need that exhibit B he the Goat 🐐 😎😎
Cartman should definitely be on the round table, that boy has done some heinous ass shit 💀
Bro, seeing Ryuga awakened a core memory in me. I'd love to see how this ends with him.  However, when you're done W this case CJ, I want you to investigate Lockdown and The Blackthorn: Dalinar Kholin. The latter might make you create The Black Timberlands Energy roundtable.
I knew it, ever since people started saying Beyblade was that serious I knew Ryuga would find a seat at the round table
Buu in his own league give him a different ranking
RYUGA THE GOAT YESSIR BEYBLADE METAL FUSION,MASTERS AND FURY
0:47 Ryuga's Height is 6'1 and Gingka is 5'4
Ryuga was the man with black air force energy before it was even a concept for every kid🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
:O
Cant wait for part 2 and 3 Metal masters and shogun steel is cooked
WOOO Yeah, baby, this is what I have been waiting for
I never watched this show but damn, he didn’t even step out the chopper😭 he's a menace
Great to see Bablayde get some luv
All of you burst fanatics, y'all now have a reason to watch metal saga: Tobio is the great-grandfather to all Kiyama.
Bro Ryuga would be the best goat ever if the writers didn’t gave Jenga plot
oh nothin just gonna spam ryuga's addition down in wacka's comments
Yeah, gon ahead & drop that part 2
Kid me watched this show just cuz of ryuga
beyblade is NOT that serious bro😭
HE FINALLY TOOK MY REQUEST. I LOVE YOU CJ
The voice overs are so accurate lowkey reminding me of my childhood
Unrelated to the trial but calling it now: if CJ ends up making Vegeta’s trial, Lanipator is gonna crash it
You thought he was cold ? That was only season 1 out of 3...
Excuse you. THAT WAS JUST EXHIBIT A?!?
Ngl i was kinda sad because its already sunday but then i see CJ uploaded and im instantly more cheerful
Let’s face it before every match ryuga blasts Bk hoping he gon kill somebody
17:41 That's the shadow the hedgehog result theme. Better minutes is I heard that
Naw i was witing for this dude to put this man on the round table bro went out his way merking people with a spin top bro😭😭😭😭😭
He is definitely black air force
Yo, congratulations on trending! Highly deserved
This was great boy is a menace fr,  but I need to see younger toguro or yhwach at some point 👀
Lol droppppp
This boy really said Shannon and skip 😂😂😂
Make one on Junko Enoshima from Danganronpa please 🙏
Sorry for asking do you want to do made from abyss
DRAGON EMPEROR LIFE DESTRUCTOR! I always loved that scene.
Your honor, I mean no disrespect to your judgement, however ROBERTA is ranked A!? Otherwise, im glad we talking about Ryuga
It's always a good day when CJ uploads 😁
By the end of S1 Jin Woo will be on this list. Iykyk
Love to see the new ranking system… but there better be an S or higher next to Escanor-Samada🔥🔥🔥 HE IS THE ONE WHO GETS TO DECIDE
W vid
I love how inconsistent Ryuga's win rate is in this video. 😅
Dont ever disrespect the mustash man
i dont care what you say ryuga is the BEST anti hero in anime
PERFECT example for "Hatred", it got me rolling on the ground from how unexpected it was.
6:43 YOUR DED
man when's seto kaiba's trail
Brooo I forgot about this series. Definitely brings back memories
9:28 Btw, anybody know what the name of the beat is in the background?
omg memoirs of a true goat with black air force nrg that makes most look like Nikes
Wait so your telling me that this was just EXHIBIT A??? HE WAS TWO MORE VIDEOS LEFT OMG LIL BRO'S A DEMON
Man he only did the original series 💀
Isn't it worrisome that stalin has murdered far more people than hitler but his face is x'ed out?
Only few people talks about Ryuga I personally love him his my favorite in metal furry he is just cool every time he makes an entrance or an exit meteors fall lightning strucks  Edit: I don’t get it why is he suddenly gotten talk about it’s more than 8 years
This video was fire gang❤❤
This video is the perfect example of how I was running 1’s in elementary school with my bey
Cj said like the video and ill drop it next week, and 89k of us said bet 😂
that think about musa was not funny it was offensive
8:12 WHERE IS RONALDO THE GOAT ???
Can we also talk about how cold his drip is? Easily the sauciest man in beyblade
BEEN WAITING ON TS SHOULD DO KYOYA
How about letting Kazuya Mishima join The round table? I mean..he has a DEVIL GENE,his baby Momma had to raise his son alone(Well.kazuya was thrown into a volcano).when he comes Back he keeps fighting his dad And Don. ..And he likes collecting sneakers
Ryuga coming out to “Whoop that trick!” chants has me crying too early in the morning.
Give old fighters like hank j from madness combat or as a joke frisk from undertale genocide route
Please mention L-Drago’s spin stealing in the next part
Yo this anime is underrated as crap
Who gonna win Ryuga or Tai Lung
Ayo CJ, PLEASE do Yu-Gi-Oh next man
I think ryuga forgot ur supposed to aim for the bey
CJ's voice acting is immaculate
y’know what i hate about this? L-Drago feeds off of negativity, so the power of friendship, as stupid as it sounds, is the perfect counter to it. as overused as it is, for this?? it makes _sense._
"Hey I know you're the main character but did you forget I smoked your daddy? Like he is dead as hell because of me lol"  -Ryuga to Gingka
Song at 2:45??? @2:45
Y’all gotta talk about Brooklyn from the OG beyblade , had one of the biggest crash outs i ever seen. he literally became a reality warping being over one loss
how tf a child up in here 😭  tf is beyblade even about
honestly i did not like ryouga during the first season (matal fusion i guess)...he was a standard villain...but his development during metal masters and fury is what made me think that he's the best character in the whole show
You sound like afrosenju
Jeez that original Apex legends music makes me wanna play again 😢
Hey CJ, can you do a BAF1 video on Dante from The Devil May Cry series?
6:50 you mean 41...     We don't know that Ginga's dad survived, yet. So at this point it's 40 elites plus him.
Bro glazing more than Dunkin doughnuts
we just need all 3 parts asap 😂
Bruh when the bad guy has a child sidekick you know damn well that mofo is a goat
FINNALY HE IS HERE!
All of his videos are the goat bro I am so happy that he is doing part 2 next week
Season 1 Ryuga is not important, that is not real Ryuga. S2 and S3 is the real deal. He is by far the strongest Beyblade character when it comes to own power. Nemesis stole the power from the whole world (including some of Ryuga's power) and Gingka also gained power from everyone at the end. Without any doubt, Ryuga is the strongest, he is one of those characters who eventually must lose to main character/villain for the sake of forced plot..
Nice
dont forget the time he gave tsubasa schizophrenia
I need to rewarch this show
Let me guess the instagram memes made you watch this
I think that at this point, stink Meaner is definitely the face of hatred
I have a new inductee for the round table of black air force energy, mash from mashle.
Ryuga was my boi i hate how he went out tho ❤
Imagine if hitler get it
Exhibit B. He didnt launch L Drago in the ring he casually threw it with a weak ass spin and still won
Cj you gotta do zaheer from avatar bro
I remember me and my brother go “Ooooooo” whenever he pops up cuz we need he’s about to f shit up.
Bro im so happy he did a video on one of my favorite character of all time
Ryuga is definitely Kenpachi son with out of pocket energy
My childhood looks back. 👍👏
This is a video that I never knew I needed till I saw tha title🫡
I fucking love this guy 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
Ryuga the GOAT 🐐 ❤❤️‍🔥
Power of Friendship is the most bullshit reason to win, imagine Gingka fighting 1,000,000 Ryugas and then Kenta goes "Gingka u can do it!!!!!" You know it's wraps for Team Ryuga
We need a part 2 rnnnnn
I know these don't really fit the black air force energy, but could you do videos on just pure evil characters like the ai from "I have no mouth, but I must scream" and other similar horrifying evil and sadistic characters? I'd like to see/hear a video with your touch describing them.
Wait was this only one cases of evidence
BEYBLADE NEVER THIS SERIOUS NGA💀💀💀
THIS IS BEYBLADE!
"CHECKMATE NYEEEGA!"    Bro learnt from   stinkmeaner😂😂😂
Cj:  legend says it  Feeds of off negativity   Stinkmeaner in hell:  WASSUP NYEIGAA!   Cj:  MAN SHUT THE FU
Is it just me or does the kid look like garou from OPM
when i was little i wanted to paint my hair like ryuga (the goat)
I wonder if masquerade from Bakugan with his hydranoid can beat this guy or any villain duelist from Yu-Gi-Oh even?
Let's go know time he on 😱🫣☠️🏃🔥👏💯😁🤨🤔😈
Greatest bey blade anime by far
Bro is a menace to society 💀
Rule number one of Beyblade: If someone called Ryuga is on screen, something (or someone) is getting blown up
and bro didnt even mention the fact that subasa got fcking schizophrenia after he got knocked out
make kenpachi
Ryuga is basically Beyblade Marik Ishtar aka Melvin from Yu-Gi-Oh 😂
PLEASE do light yagami
Crash out champion
16:48 wtf😂
I remember the good ole days of watching some beyblade 6:30 a.m. before i had to go to middle school, im glad you included my boy.   Ryuga, the crab guy , and 1 more were my favorites i just can't remember their names its been over a decade now lol
Even after his death the new generation of beyblade new ryuga was the goat
If this was tied with the OG series. Ryuga would have been fucked by the old beyblades. Those things were fucking alive and can do whatever they wanted. (If anyone remembered the Beyblade movie) the OGs would have beat his ass with ease.
4:42 kyoya would definitely say that hhhhhhhhhhhh ❤😂 this video made me scream
The goat sound got me dying
Omg I love Beyblade 😂😂😂❤ I’m actually rewatching it for the 1M times now and I’m freaking 24 😂 I’m so happy ppl are still talking about it. My fav childhood show forever ❤
Bruh I haven't seen this show in yearssss I trying to remember what happened to RYUGA Lol this was a nos show for me
Whenever this man posts a video YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A BANGER!!!!!!!😁😁😁😁😁
this man got me more flabbergasted than sukuna ong
yu a real nigga beyblade was my shit
Bro u know it’s about to get bad when a beyblader is ranked💀
You should do a video for Kratos, especially from God of War 3.
I thought you were dead or something
My nigga. You gotta do most disrespectful anime moments 6 by cj da champ with girls. That’d be dope.
When man appeared I was like what is Beyblade even about anymore!!
I'm just now realizing I never watched the rest of they metal series
Sum1 plug me with the tunes from the locker room
The Beyblade series I never finished. I loved Ryuga, he was just plain nuts. We went from Kai to that dude.
Stay coming with it, patches n aaaallll 🤩🤩😎
Bruh a bladeblade anime 😂
That's my boy this brings back memories from 2010
Bout time...
As someone who's been a fan of Beyblade ever since MFB days and still is. HELL YEAH I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR RYUGA TO BE ON THE BLACK AIRFORCE TABLE
11:01 She did, once in season 2.
do a vid on monster
Ryuga 🤝 madara: CAN YOU TANK THE SECOND ONE?
He gotta put cell on here
He is the Broly of Beyblade he only lost because the plot said he had to
Part 2 PLEASE 💯💯!!!!
FINALLY SOME BEYBLADE LOVE
RYUGA voice is spot-on lmao ……. ….. … .. . .. .. .. .. .. ..
Congrats on trending
CJ I love when you make these videos but a little side note your missing 2 more series. Beyblade Metal Masters and Beyblade Metal Fury
Do ash Inferape or greninja
I know the series ain't over, but you gotta do Mash Burnedead from Mashle, bro is wild from the first episode onward 😭
#7 on Trending? Hope you working on part 2 CJ 😈
CJ really ended old dudes careers at Sportcenter and ESPN
Why bruh ain’t made a video on how jiren beat up the z fighters yet😂
MY BOY FINALLY GOT RECOGNIZED 💯 I wish you would did the ronin dragoon
This character should not have been this crazy for a a series that I only watched watched because I saw gingka in an Argos catalog 💀
CJ, you made my week by posting this! I wasn't sure if you'd ever do a trial for Ryuga! Thanks so much! 🙏🏾 I can't wait for part two!
finally some beyblade content
I think it’s time to consider Fleetway Super Sonic in the hall of fame…I’m just saying
Cj my man please do Bakura from Yu-Gi-Oh he's actually a d-1 tormentor so disrespectful and vile I'm begging you
Give aizen his video 👩🏼‍🦲
Ryuga the GOAT
Need part and part 3 on ryuga metal masters
Higan/Joe Logan needs to be on the next episode of The Asylum
Bro just uses hollow purple.
complete props to the second goat kyoya. He was the only nigga without plot armor to stand toe to toe with Ryuga props
Nah, you didn't had to insert SpongeBob music to show just how ridiculous the power of friendship in treating The GOAT of Beyblade metal.  Anyway, looking forward for part 2. Thanks for a great watch.
Ryuga the hero
ryuga really was crazy i used to be lk scared of him
This nigga gonna make me go re watch beyblade cause i never seen these niggas i know Tyson and Kai
#7 On trending lets GOOOO! 💪🏾

Yes sir keep It good my brother love all your videos
10:24 that pack hit so goood
Bro imagine getting robbed in this universe.  You thinkin homie got a whole .45 but he got a beyblade .el drago 😭😭
👇👇All og bey blade metal fusion watchers
Bro lost like twice through THREE seasons. He’s my GOAT
GOAT
15:33 So like, now that I notice it, they decided to bust out Te-Mi-Ni-Gru from DMC3 as the *Last Stage* 😂 Considering how the Lore goes lol
Oh hell yeah. This is the video I was waiting for!!!
Okay but  He was also the only one to pull up on Hades and guve 0 f***s about how hig and bad he was. Ryuga KEPT that energy the whole time
Ryuga the ultimate troller
Love these videos!! Been waiting!!
U gotta do golgo 13
"WHOOP THAT TRICK" 😂
I actually still have his beyblade, L Drago was always my go to when I was younger.
Biggest menace from my childhood

Now a nigga juss waiting for Marik to make it to the Round Table
Do scar next!
Cj When Free De La Hoya one of the biggest menaces in evolution in my pov coming to the round table
Drained his soul is wild  Pause on that ⏸
CAN YOU A GOKU BLACK
Shoot. I forgot Beyblade was like that. Show was my childhood. I ended up missing most of the Metal series, so bring on part 2!

Ryuga is the goat when he was  villain until Ryuga got nerf
Cj dachamp + my childhood = perfect life💯
I owned a real LDROGO
Ryuga definitely listens to nba young boy.😂
Need bros older brother marik on this list
Don't forget about rago the god destruction
You lost me at Beyblade.   And no they aren’t dead and you know it. Shows with the “power of friendship” don’t mass slaughter people, and considering they’re anime characters and not real people let’s not pretend they couldn’t survive that.
We needa PT2 for Season 2, how he washed Juliann Concern
Pls do one on the pillar men 🙏
ay yes my fav president
I been waiting sooo long for this
BEYBLADE GETTING THE RESPECT IT DESERVES IS THE BEST THING TO EVER HAPPEN TO ME
You know what’s crazy, the fact that Ryuga gets so much stronger than the main cast (mainly in fury) where he put up a better fight against nemesis than all the legendary bladers combined
Bro when we gonna see a vs battle against Anyanokoji from cote and Yuichi Katagiri from Tomodachi game
This menace basically used a kids toy to vanquish his prey
Bro it's been a decade but if i remember right Ryuga lost Twice in his life.  This was the first and he didn't lose again until Diablo  but even that can't be be considered a loss because bro sacrificed himself and Ldrago to make sure Diablo losses
Could u do Tokyo revengers season 2 and 3
Isn’t that guy from bey blade bro
The parlay is insane 😭😭
same here
HOLY SHIT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG ASS WHILE, KEEP GOATIN' ON
Ay cuz drop that Ho next week current likes 80k I grew up on this shit ryuga was fuckinn goateed bruh had me thinking ginga was finna lose in season 1

Fire Vid Bro Keep Makin Em
BRIOOI PLS ADD ISSEI TO THE BLACK AIR FORCE ENRRGY RABLE THAT MF WENT OFFF BROOO PLSSSSSSS
Tobias is the Ryuga of Pokemon. Who is Tobias, you ask? Just a guy who *RAGDOLLED THE WHOLE SINNOH LEAGUE, CYNTHIA INCLUDED, BROKE ASH'S PLOT ARMOR, CAUSING ASH TO GO TO UNOVA, AND THEN JUST DIPS.* How did he break plot armor, you ask? A PAIR OF ARCEUS-DAMN LEGENDARIES. EVEN THE RANDOM BACKGROUND CHARACTER WITH A ARCEUS-DAMN HEATRAN.  So yeah, he doesn't need to try. And he could have more. That's right, we only saw his first 2 mons. So yeah, Tobias is a Pokemon flavored Ryuga. Mans just pulled an Exodia without breaking a sweat 🤜💠🤛
a pin for the one time?? i never had a comment pinned before
Aint no way the goat got defeated by the power of friendship
ryuga   is  the   goat   of   all    time 😜❤🤟👋
Why is everyone doing beyblade videos?

Finally!
Yo, I remember watching Beyblade a lot as a kid back then, and Ryuga was one of the biggest opps that I became accustomed to first.
Do one on goblin slayer

I’ve waited SO LONG for this!!! Finalt the goat is now where he belong, the Black Air Force round table the goat Ryuga 🗿
I have never gotten over the fact that Moses using a beyblade to split the sea is cannon in beyblade

This one kinda lame Ryuga didn’t really have black air force energy he was really was manipulated to do the things by that system upgrade you should’ve have did someone like Son woo Le Dragon was only bussed cause everyone else was weak asf fr

Ryuga wasn't someone who just coasted by on the power of his legendary artifact - He trained harder than anyone. He trained harder then the MC, he trained harder than Rock Lee, and by following his training, he got a side character to stand up to the MC.  Ryuga put in his blood, sweat, and tears, which is why he earned the title of THE GOAT.
Cj should do one of cid from eminence in shadow
Bro dropped a banger on my birthday❤❤
1:42 Beyblade got their own Assassins creed timeline for their history😂
Ryuga belongs right next to Brady and Gretski on the GOAT list
CJ I’m not gonna lie you should be a voice actor bro you should be
🍿🍿🍿
Bro, season 3 was the goat and I will die on that hill.
I can’t wait for you to do Damian from metal masters💀💀💀 he was on some. plus Ryuga comes back again😂
LETS GOOO😂
So there is this anime called G.A.T.E. And it is about a magic gate that opens in the middle of one of japans super metropolitains and all these fantasy/adventure soldiers from another world start attacking, and it asks the question “what if we brought guns and a millitary into a fantasy world.” And it gets CRAZY, wondering if anyone in that anime could qualify
bro Aizen is on the round table but no video hmmm like he cook half the anime and even cook Ichigo's life even before he was born
You should make a black air force video on Shinra from Fire Force. He has some badass moments that everyone just HAS to see to understand how much of an absolute GOAT he is.
Bro hit that bitch with the triple essence of darkness dragons 😭
Kaiba plz
Awesome video! Seeing Ryuga made me realize that we need Yami Marik from Yu-Gi-Oh to be on trial.
AYE DO PART 2 METAL MASTER
I have no idea who the fuck these mfers are or what they do but idc, as long as i see "CjDCHAMP" below the title
he's falling off and becoming cringe
goat
RYUGA HAVES THE STRONGEST LEFT SPINNING BAY 💯
11:34 “MY PARLAY!” Philly losing another parlay? Damn.
1:17 this intro is the nega version of avatar lmao
Less quality more vids bro
YESSSSSSSSS
Bro you’re trending
FINALLY! FINALLY IT'S HAPPENING!!!
Ryuga is the writers learning from Tala in the original Beyblade. Tala was the final boss that was defeated in season 1 that was nerfed in season 3. But Ryuga's power remained consistent and when he fought the antagonists of the follwing seasons, he crushed them. Only a literal God was able to defeat Ryuga 1v1. That is good consistent writing.
Beyblade was absolutely wild! Those toys went hard too. Used to whip that occasionally for years lol
Dj bro i never thought you would make a vidoe like this
7 th trending CJ da goat
I’ve been waiting for this
Maannn you aint even talk about season 2 ryuga. Even worse
I have a suggestion CJ, I know he isn’t anime or cartoon whatever, but I believe that TREVOR PHILLIPS belongs at the Black Air Force Table
Definitely want a Part 2!
The review for s2 and s3 rey go insane
Ryuga trained harder than the MC. Ryuga is quite literally the strongest blader ever seen. And on top of that... They nerfed my boy.
WHOOP THAT TRICK
“Another nigga another comma” is wild 😂😂
This made me rewatch the whole beyblade series and see Ryuga menace count and I am hype for part two
Man I’m so glad people have started talking about this anime legend (and Beyblade in general)
Majin Buu: "I am the one kwown as the Ultimate Menace! Fear me!"  Ryuga: "Hold my Beyblade, because you're going down pinkie!"
Durin dis beyblade trend I was waitin for dis nigga to do it
To this day Ryuga throwing Ldrago with his hand at the guards and spinning faster the more they hit it is cemented in my mind
Can we get a to your eternity part 2 for season 2 🙏🙏🙏
bro's upload schedule..at least you're back
holy shit i did not expect you to cover my childhood favouriate character let alone beyblade at all. Sick vid.
Bro wtf is there a ryuga trend goin on everyone been making a black Air Force video about him lately
Bruh the fact Ryuga is Taller than me 😭😭😭
Do the eminence in shadow
Ain’t NO WAY… THIS DUDE WITH A REALLY STRONG SPINTOP GOT T W O PARTS.
Iv never seen beyblade before and I thought it was just a wholesome anime of just kids battling it out with the beyblades. This video changed everything holy shit 💀
Kyoya and Lyon are W

Nah bro, does dudes good, they’re not regular people. Kenta, a little kid, was BENCHING 315 NO SPOTTER
Bro I aint never even watched this series. And you're making me like this. Your video covers of shows are legendary.
next weak damn it is want it rn
Cj react do devilman crybaby asap😂
Yo CJ a series you should check out that’s definitely worthy of having almost every character sit at the round table or lock up in the asylum   It’s called Record of Ragnarok
I know someone you can add to the round table Slick’s True form Godzilla Ultima
That man was a demon made flesh, a true raider and viking. He gave no fucks and bodied everyone...oh yeah fuck jinga because I my book that man was trash just like the main character from yu gi oh zexal.
CJ my dude you made me wannabe watch beyblade again and I was wondering when Ryuga was finna get a Black Air Force trial and now he needs a part two?! 👀, can’t fuckin wait
Ay CJ YOU GOT TOP 10 ON TRENDING IN A DAY
What's crazy is that this was the only time Gingka beat Ryuga😂 every time they fought after this bro lost.
If he’s doesn’t drop of next week we all will riot it’s pretty much inevitable
Bro gotta do mugen for black force energy
Pokémon xy n beyblade we’re goated Cartoon Network shows
We need Marik from yugioh!
Glaze me is crazy 💀
CJ MY MAN YOU’RE TRENDING 🔥 🔥 🔥
I swear, everytime a character named Ryuga pulls up on screen, they damn well became a straight menace and violated everyone on sight
I would love to see Ryuga versus Kai, they got too active in Beyblabe 😂
WAIT A MINUTE you going to talk about him but not Masquerade from Bakugan she was cool . And spectra
Worth the wait and the hype. This is my favorite video of yours😂🔥
Had a friend who got rid of all his beyblade stuff after Ryuga lost, ts was insanr
Nah, that writer's room for Hikaru had to be like:  "Lemme get this right? We're going to traumatize our recurring FEMALE beyblader, who we established dreams to be the best beyblader, to the point she DOESN'T EVER BEYBLADE AGAIN?"  "YEP."  "...Have ya'll seen Yugioh 5Ds?"  "Uh...no?"  "Right. Let's do this." *Types up the script* 😂😂😂😂😂😂
There’s a picture of fatass 10y/o me in a skin-tight ryuga Halloween costume, straight dripped, dyed hair and everything
Glad my childhood show is resurfacing once again for the masterpiece it is
"Bey on a launcher trynna get jiggy they had found that boi alive all of his beyblades parts were missing"  -Ryuga
THE MENACE HIMSELF FINALLY GETTING SOME RECOGNITION
Metal masters and metal fury ryuga was more menacing than the literal villains of the season cmon it deserves a video
That man Gingka was getting free throws over Ryuga like he’s a Laker 💀
Hey CJ do you believe in Jesus Christ or any other religion
He was such a demon mf had to be killed by a god at the age of 15 in the show
MOSES LMAO
CJ THANK YOU HE KID BUU LVL
When's the Kenpachi vid droppin' bruh? I seen him on the round table for hella time!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO I ASKED FOR THIS
Metal fusion: like  Burst: comment
LETS GOO NEW CJ AND ITS A MULTI-PART VIDEO ON THE ABSOLUTE GOAT OF MY CHILDHOOD 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ryuga should've been given another point on tsubasa because he cause mental trauma to that dude
I loved watching beyblade. Back then Ryuga was a menace
gotta love some BEYBLADE CONTENT!!!!!!
Show love on this fr this was phenomenal n funny as hell 😭😭
Beyblade Metal Fusion is the same show that people was dueling in the streets
Nah LET IT RIPPPPPP !😂
Oh nah, never expected a beyblade episode, but I'm *HERE FOR IT*
Appreciate that “Whoop that Trick” insert 🤌🏽🤌🏽👏👏👏😬😬😬
I have waited for YEARS for Ryuga to get a Black Air Force Activity Trial. That man was the biggest menace I knew from my childhood.
16:23 Yeah...about that...the real 28-3 comes at Ryuga's battle in the Metal Masters World Championships when he reps for team Japan. Trust me. Go watch it.
I was so invested on the video that I forgot we were only on exhibit A, when he said it was complete and there was more my jaw dropped, mf what you mean there’s more?!!
Nahh i gotta see more of Ryuga, that man CARRIED Beyblade
I need to see a Solo leveling video NOW
Never thought a bayblade character would be this much of a menace
Its about time CJ. We've been waiting.....
If you get a live action black airforce council you HAVE TO DO RANDY ORTON
Dang, Ryuga can use a person's anger as power
Wait wait wait. THAT WAS JUST EXHIBIT A!!!!???? OH HELL NAW!
Beyblade ruined plot armor for everyone else
I absolutely could not believe my eyes when I saw you made a Black Air Force trial with the absolute G.O.A.T Ryuga.  I literally remember finding him so cool, I tried to copy his fit for like 4 years.  I can't wait for him to cover the violation of Jack during the Metal Masters tournament.
L-Dragon took bro over like he sukuna
Im already excited for part 2
Finally bro posted thank you bro😭😭😭😭
This was hilarious lmao
You know an opp that should be mentioned is choso
Stop being Gay 🛑 be straight today. Revision edit correction
Another absolute BANGER CJ 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Nah! You bouta blue ball us like this? CJ, we love ya. But come on!
Song at 8:42? I remember it from some game but I don't know which one
Cj Dachamp I know damn well you ain't spending years on anime characters with black air force activity and not bringing one of the most diabolical beings of all time. ALL HAIL PLANKTON🦠
They did my boy ryuga so dirty in the end. May my man rest in peace
Ryuga was my childhood he was a legend the true goat and black air force
I am ryuga I am brown and Asian
The GOAT Ryuga will finally entered the Roundtable. LET'S GO! Everyone like the video because I'm trying to watch exhibit B next week.
Aye much respect to you Cj you did Ryuga big justice
Now CJ, if you see this, you know damn well there gotta be a part 2 lmaoo, especially what ryuga did to that bey orion😂😂
YEESSE
Every time I try to analyze a villain I have to subtract points from their score, because they simply aren't RYUGA, they aren't him
droppp
Tsubasa got cooked so bad he got taken over by Ldrago’s power and started tweakin😭
If you cover Beyblade, will you do Yu-Gi-Oh!'s Yami Marik and/or Yami Bakura or even Seto Kaiba?
Wai is beerus not at the round table of black air force
Can you do Shira from Blade of the immortal 2020
Respect the Sonic Riders theme in the beginning
Okay, I’m glad that you’re making a video on Ryuga, and I’m glad that you didn’t sugarcoat anything, but you did miss one of the most integral aspects of him: Barely anyone cheered him on because they admired him (at least in this part of the series).  Everybody was too afraid of him. He literally eats your soul if you are of no other use to him. Nobody wanted be in his train of thought or his line of sight because that’s just being one step closer to death.  Iirc, in the fight with Subasa (the guy that “got his soul sucked”), the ref was practically struggling to hold back his wimpers when Ryuga walked in.  Nobody in the Beyblade universe admired him (except for Yu, until he didn’t), they just feared him.
Yo that part at 10:00 to 10:08 and 11:30 to 11:36 had me weak 😭
Dawg, that show was my shit growing up. During metal masters, I wanted ryuga, ginka, tsubasa, and kyoya all be on one team.
OH idk if CJ will see this but in one fight he didn't even launch it with his launcher he tossed Ldrago and stole speed from his opponent and won the fight, if that's not the ultimate for BAFE idk what is...
You know I'd like to see one for Kojiro Hyuga from captain Tsubasa ngl
CJ i think i speak for THOUSANDS when i say you NEED to check into tokyo revengers, THAT SHIT IS CRAZY
Mr. CJ🧐. You guys are crazy😨. ✨The style I've seen, has inspired other channels, like Tybe, Blazen and such(probably). It probably originated from YOU 🤯/another creator. You've brought together a really loyal community of supporters, sharing their love for a character and memories😇. 💯W video and have a good one everyone😌♥. God bless🙏✨.
My favorite fights was when ever rock leon was on the field this man was on demon timing any time he hit the field my dude
I love this brother from another mother, his content hits my funny bone just right!
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO MAKE THIS, IVE SEEN OTHERS DO SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT YOU JUST HAVE A PLEASANT VIBE TO DOING THESE KINDS OF VIDEOS 💯💯
Now this is my CHILDHOOD Ryuga was my Vegeta
The fact this only season 1 😱
8:03 NOT THE ESPN MORNING SHOW 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eyyy, it's my boi!  It always makes me happy to see Ryuga hyped, cus he's legit one of my favorite characters in general. I am the dragon person, so I am contractually obligated to like him because L-Drago is a dragon. But he is also cool and actually does have a character arc, and like real character arcs, it's not super spelled out or blatant. Also Ryuga and L-Drago gets bonus points because L-Drago is a rare beyblade where one of its powers is a real thing. Spin stealing.   You can get the top and use it irl, and it will steal the spin from beys that don't also spin to the left.
YEeeees!!🎉 I’ve waited so long for cj to finally talk about ryuga i mean Beyblade just exploded as of recently on the internet and even cj wannabes talk about ryuga like cj because honestly this ryuga vid shoulda been made a long time ago but ay it’s finally here
5”8’? Ryuga is not helping the short violent men allegations
Cid Kaguno Eminence In Shadow
I need moree , rayuga the goattt
Pls do the part 2
And let's not forget that Ryuga spent the time skip between metal fusion and metal masters in dark power rehab, and did the impossible. He not only came back stronger than before (which is already an accomplishment for a recovering dark power addict AND a returning final villain of a first season), he tamed L-Drago so hard it evolved through sheer force of will
7:57 this your best bit. This was hilarious and your impressions were so accurate. Could listen to that forever
old beyblade is goated
Bro got two more 💀💀💀
SAITAMAAAAAA!!!!
Drop that part 2 and 3 YESTERDAY ‼️‼️‼️
Bro the part when he said "WhATs GoOd mY NigGa" on 1:26 made me forget how to breathe 😂
The voice actor of Ryuga was truly goated. Bro went from being so unserious in Metal Fusion (seriously, hear his “you’re being COWARDLY” line in his battle with Ginga”) to being the most serious dude in the room in the span of a few months.
yk today is a good day when its your birthday and Cj uploads
I swear there isnt a SINGLE person in media history who needs to be put on a list more than this mf right here
Bro why they do this to my GOAT😭😭
I didn't know the round table had DLC.
MY MAN GETTING THE RESPECT HE DESERVES FINALLY
Before Fafnir and Takara Tomy pumping out that same bey every gen, Ryuga was the first one doing the spin steal.
I never thought we’d get a Beyblade Black Air Force Energy on this channel, fills me with clout energy 😎
Ginga was 115 bays in. Remember he fought 100 beys and won
Just wait until exhibit C..
i need Tokyo revengers season 3
Cj my goat 🗣🙏🏾
Ryuga is HIM. He only lost to a power of friendship and a god who had not only stolen Ryuga own power but also had power of every single legendary blader and every single bey in existance and Ryuga still gave him a run for his money.  Long live the undisputed Dragon Emperor.
Despite having Ldrago he didn’t take any L’s
SIT DOWN PORKY THE PIG, had me laughing like crazy
Bro...that was just exibit A!!!??
I've been waiting for this 😅
WAIT HOLY SHIT. THIS ENTIRE VIDEO IS ONLY EXHIBIT *A?*
Are we not going to talk about how he gave tsubasa schizophrenia
OK if we're counting crimes Where's Rick's invitation to the table?
Check mate nikka
Adam from record of Ragnarok
Wait a damn minute!! All of that was just Exhibit A!!?
Im surprised you didn't say *DRAGON EMPEROR SOARING BITR STRIKE!* as aggressively as you can
Please do yami
Ayo if adding bayblade to the BAF-1 round table can we get Paul from pokemon on this bitch man was a straight menace. Either him or acnologia from fairy tail brother was a good few screws loose
Mannnn I need to rewatch this, I remember watching this in real time
Ryuga had to lost to plot armor to achieve SUPREME GOAT STATUS.
I’m so glad this menace was not forgotten in history😁😁😁
Bro Ryuga in masters was built so different they had to use him sparingly since if he was there he would literally end the show. Since he did in masters. Down right tragic what happens on metal fury
I need the greatest battle between a father and his son video now
Script writers had to try 2 times to pack him up in one arc which is crazy bro brushed of the 1st time the script writers tried to cuck him and 2nd time they said oh nah we gotta jump this man his black air forces are to strong and all this in metal fusion to ☠☠☠
I forgot how wild beyblade was 💀
Ryuga man's name have enough menace
I remember one of his most disrespect moments is that he doesn't even spin the bay blade he casually use his hand to throw it and it spin so fast annihilating his opponents
The title is true
With cj officially covering this, everyone will now have to recognize ryuga as the ORIGINAL DEMON
Holy shit I totally forgot how much DOG Ryuga had in him, he totally went and traumatized a chick from ever playing Beyblade, he was just that guy!
Let's go Part 2!!!
Ryuga, the dragon emporor (aka. The man who walked before Sukuna could run.
waiting for the next video!!
I been waiting for this 😍
I knew this was coming every since I saw ppl talk about beybladr again😊
Really off-topic, I don’t know when you plan to do Aizen’s video my man but I recommend you leave it until after the TYBW anime is fully finished. It would be way better to see the wild shit he does animated.
The true childhood menace
Whats funny is that the voice actor for doji in the japan dub is the same actor as dio So you're basically seeing dio riding ryuga throughout the whole of fusion
We  need to bring back beyblade we all have to like this vid
Can’t wait for part 2, Ryuga only got so much more badass as the show progressed. Man’s went from greatest villain in the show (cuz let’s be real hades inc and rago had nothing on him) to hands down most badass character the show had.
part 2 lets gooooooooooooooo
GOATED show, GOATED character, GOATED review!
Yessir we getting badass with this vid!!!
Point calculation with the Shadow the Hedgehog music is goated, I know he's a hero, but honestly Shadow's game with all the possibilities of his crimes would do for a Round Table member
Bro you gotta do the beyblade burst series bc they be going ssj, ssg, ssgss, like they be going hard. And they be talkin shit and stand on business
Being alive in the same generation when this man drops a video has to be the rarest thing ever
I remembered every time I saw Rayuga on screen I was always on the edge of my seat because I knew as soon as he showed up Someone was about to get violated
Oh fuck he actually made the video!
Season one was that heat fr 😂
Bro RYGUGA is that guy
17:01 - 17:08 Genuine question I haven't watched the series, so forgive me, but are you allowed to destroy the arena, blow up the stadium and kill people?   Because with all of the stuff Ryuga was doing, it feels a little petty to call the ref for Bey interference at this stage, I don't know. I'm confused.
The horror of a Beyblade the BLOODY GOES LEFT THE HORROR
i sbuscreebed :D
Maybe beyblade is that serious
Man, I started watching the show on YouTube to bring back memories from my childhood and I really couldn’t believe how much of a Menace Ryuga was. L-Drago is one Beyblade that radiates Black Air Force Activity
I thought beyblade was just a silly kids show…
Maybe beyblade was that serious
This man was the Toji of Beyblade bro was a straight MENACE
When cj said she was traumatise and couldnt take a blaybade MY JAW DROP THE STAIR
Kyoya trains like a strong man but ryuga training like a fucking monster.
PLEASE MAKE ONE ON KAI FROM THE OG SERIES
My childhood memories have just been triggered to another level
Wut that Freddy doin 😭
9:59 Whoop that trick chants is actually crazy😭💀💀😂
No wonder they had to make these beys weaker, these things were too damn powerful
PLEAAASE GIVE IT ASAP
WE WANT PART 222
FINALLY!!!!!!
Cj You always deliver.😂
All other beyblade antagonists got nothing on this man
Everyone doing vids on the metal series but forget G Revolution was the better series
All i need now is Masquerade from Bakugan Battle Brawlers
THAT WAS FUCKING EXHIBIT A!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yea ryuga can solo the verse
0:42 stats
This dude in Japanese is voiced by Kenjiro Tsuda who was Nanami, Seto Kaiba, and many other characters.
I had this nigga's meteo L-Drago at one point
I’ve beeen waiting soooooooooooooo long
omfg no way this man just reminded me of one of the fucking wildest menaces of my childhood. I literally had this man's exact same left-spinning LDrago Bey and Launcher too.
Philly in the crowd was wildin😭
Put my nigga dr egg man on this jkjk lmfao
rip ryuga
Wait till my nigga motor l drago come out
I was asking for this thank you
This show was actually my childhood and to make it better CJ putting him at the round table!
Damn no wonder it took you so long to post
Really got me emotional with how well you portrayed ryuga. Straight classic childhood memories
BRO if your going to do this then you gotta do masquerade from Bakugan bro
I didn't expect to see Ryuga, but BEYBLADE WAS THAT SERIES!!!!
Real
Yo CJ, After your videos on this MFing GOAT Ryuga, you absolutely *HAVE* to do a video on Raven from Zoids Chaotic Century/Guardian Force. Especially the Geno-Saurer Era. Dude is a straight-up menace, with one of the greatest, most goddamn menacing theme songs I've ever heard. The Geno-Saurer is an absolute BAMF. - Seriously, Raven+The Geno-Saurer took out entire military bases and armies for SPORT, alone, defeated the main character not once or twice but -consistently-, had surprising growth and depth as a character, and then evolved into an even STRONGER version of the Geno-Saurer that the combined military might of *two warring countries couldn't defeat.* - video links in reply below unless youtube's a bitch about it.
Bro you gotta do a solo leveling vid
Appreciate you dropping the tracklist. Alot of people don't, and it's always annoying.
Cj, we got another season of To your eternity, Part 2 please?
The fact that he was only 2 times defeated and he was him the seasons after
BRO YOU GOTTA GO OVER THE OTHER BEYBLADE SERIES TOO
Gets 67k likes in 15 hours . You better drop part 2 TOMORROW Nigga 😂😂😂
The next members should be all of the fighters from Record of Ragnarok (or at least the fighters from the first 2 season) or the fighters from Kengan Ashura
"For all it's worth, I'll take solace in the fact that it took a God of Destruction to kill me"  _Vegeta, Prince of all Saiyans_  (ik I misquoted but whatever)
9:59   NXTTTTTT WHOOP THAT TRICK FLASH BACK IS HITTIN
Dayum, gave that chick straight PTSD. Can't say I blame her though
WAIT IT SAYS DOFLAMINGO IS TBD, HE IS COMING FINALY!
yo watch samurai jack and put aku in the asylum it will make a funny vid and the show is fucking incredible
AND ALL OF THIS IS JUST *EXHIBIT A!!!*  I love you CJ, for giving this man the respect he deserves, not only by making a video on him, but by appropriately sectioning the legacy of this absolute menace into two, potentially three parts so that this man aura, presence, character, everything can be *properly and truly witnessed and appreciated.* You doing this man good, real good and I love you for that 🙏🏾❤️  *_Long live the Dragon Emperor🐉👑_*
To this day it still fucking wild that a beyblade parted the red sea in that universe lol
The fact that im 5,8 and 150 pounds just like Ryuga xd.
Subasa & Kiyoya had my heart . My god . 14 year old me was 🥰🥰
How he get first beyblade villan but Brooklyn wasn't or hades pluto
It’s called a galik gun not a garlic gun
Season 2 Ryuga was peak.
He really slid on a bunch of kids over some Japanese Dreidels.
How did I know
BADEBLADE.. [.How About Cartoon??.] THAT NOT EVEN THERE??
This made me SO DAMN HAPPY! HAHAHA! Beyblade getting a video from the GOATED CJDaChamp! This is the BEST FUCKIN' VIDEO I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
I mean why are people upset that a broken villain gets beaten by a broken trope? Like Ryuga had a forbidden Beyblade and he could literally do anything he wants with yall glazing tf out of him, him being beaten by something just as OP as him was gonna happen sooner or late yet yall get mad when it happens  This is exactly why I'm not into villains who's only relevancy just stems from having broken abilities because it always ends the same way and yall get surprised everytime how it ends, like at that point yall always set yourselves up for failure
Beyblade is what would happen if Pokémon and DBZ had a baby💀
Great as always BUT when r u gonna do DOFLAMINGO from op he’s A FOUNDING member fr
Me and my brother used to watch Beyblade & Bakugan before school in the morning . You boutta make me go back 😂🔥
Didn’t realize beyblade was this hype
Nah Kyoya really had that DAWG in him tho...not his fault he had to go up against the GOAT😭
The reason he lost to the mc is because nobody was angry or frustrated like the other matches.
People been doing commentaries on this show for a while and even this guy in particular but NOW WE GOT THE GOAT OF COMMENTARIES DOING IT LET'S GOOO😭😭
Send me the patch notes, as a developer, I need it to understand life
Aye that Shannon Sharpe impersonation was on point
CJ gotta be a Beyblade fan cus the voice impressions ARE *ON POINT!!!!* 💯🙏🏾🔥
When gon give my boy mugen a video cj
LET IT RIP!
*I AM SO HAPPY WTF* (Even tho i feel this is because of the rise in popularity cus of the memes but still) it took long enough BUT I'M GLAD MY GOAT IS FINALLY GETTING THE RECOGNITION HE DESERVES. THIS GUY IS LITERALLY BLACK AIR FORCE ENERGY PERSONIFIED!!!😭😭 *_LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOI!!!!!!_*
Ryuga literally only lost 2 and both times was basically the power of friendship just in different ways, gingka power of friendship then you look at the G O D that beat him cuz he took all the powers of gingkas friends 😂
THAT LET IT RIP WENT HARDD 6:22
😂😂😂😂
IS THIS REAL??? HE'S DONE IT?? HE FINALLY DID IT???? *_LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!_* 😭😭😭🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The more i watch these videos the more i love and wish to create characters like these
Man I almost forgot how insane Beyblade was Also you teased TMNT 2003s Shredder in your Anos VoldiGOAT video Wonder when that's coming out
We need pain from Naruto
CJ honestly goated
Glad to hear you make other parts allzu please cover the Menga lots different story bad equali if not more great  genga more stronger 2
How’d you get to Moses 😂
I'm guessing the reason for why Napoleon and Hitler failed to conquer Russia in this universe is cus their tops froze over so they couldn't spin but the Russian tops who's whole gimmick was ice and snow and everything winter related didn't have that problem.
Checkmating people with the moses argument is DIABLOLICAL... But also NOT HERETICAL. Well take it.
And that's only Season 1.
This man started the anime hood voice-over genere
6:05 shows they are elite because they somehow didn't hit each other with their beys lined up like that.
when is the next tokyo revengers video hapenning
Not good why u used mosa the prophet not good my boy
15:16 I'm surprised you didn't even say anything about his BEY BEING SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE 💀💀💀
did someone say beyblade ?
This needs to be a trilogy cause metal masters and metal fury are goated asf🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🙏🏾🙏🏾🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
Just remembering just how AWSOME Beyblade Metal fusion/Masters/fury was. Truly peak anime.
17:04  where is the ref!
need exhibit b soon
"Wow, impressive... let see if you can do that again." That voice over gave off the same vibe as Madara asking Ohnoki what will he do about the second one
Bro really does an episode on lighting L-dragos user, I respect it, cause I had that bey
Why Ryuga murked Kyoyoa. . .man that shit hurt lol
THE FACT YOU KNOW THIS ANIME MAKES ME SO HAPPY ITS MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD ANIMES EVER😭😭😭
beyblade may be that serious
Cj finally u drop this vid 🎉🎉🎉🎉
“Send her to cancun “ 😂😂😂😂😂
Ryuga was THAT mf in our childhoods
Gingka's friends were in the stands singing Whoop that trick
ryuga lost cuz of the plot, bro was ryomen sukuna before sukuna
Bro if you getting Beyblade characters now than judge Marik Ishtar from Yugioh that dude was on some serious demon timing if you see the sub
CJ you better drop it next week or imma have to show up wit L-Drago myself.
Gonna say this right now RIP the GOAT
We need back to back cf cj
Where tf you been the streets need you cj
Aint no nigga gon talk bout the fact that the guy looks like garou jr?
Ryuga was the first character of pure violence exposed to most kids
Sure has been an influx of Ryuga videos lately.
This the like 5th ryuga black Air Force video I’ve seen and damn right I’m watching this jawn too
So we gonna ignore at 10:05 Pops from regular show glazing also?
Oooo I was waiting for this one
200k likes, and you drop it on Monday
Not the Pokémon sword and shield music 😭
I am so happy someone besides me noticed Ryuga doing a final flash on his shit😂
CJ don't forget about Light Yamagmi from Death Note
I don't even remember seeing moses in bayblade
What about lui?
Reggie!
Do the booty warrior
Don’t let the swifties see that reference. 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
Ryuga was sukuna before sukuna and honestly more menacing. He finna be S+++ when this list is all said and done
In the sub they say go shoot instead of let it rip. And after this mf i understand cause like it might as well be a gun with how this mf was using it
Finally
Thank you
Damn took this mf a whole year to make one video
Ryuga was literally the goat, of beyblade's can't deny that
See I didnt really watch beyblade ever growing up but after this, im definitely gonna check it out! 1:03 bro i cannot wait till you do Doffi for the round table, cause he is a demon spawn from hell! Lmfao CJ you are God sent for the Anime community. Thank you for the amazing content my brother, keep it coming! 🙌
I swear Beyblade metal fusion was the best Beyblade series ever all this new shit is trash compared to the original Dookie water trash garbage compared to original Beyblade metal fusion is the best Beyblade series ever
this man have black force energy times 100
The new black airforce patch goes kinda hard
OMG THE GOAT FINALLY UPLOADED
ROBERTA IS AT LEAST S RANK!!!
Do donflamingo
I hope one day someone makes a fan fighting game that has all of the roundtable members, and makes it a Def Jam-like.
I own a ldrago myself
I guess beyblade really was THAT serious...
Beyblade along with Bakugan was my CHILDHOOD. Ryuga and Masquerade were some bomb ass villains.
We need a trail for Cid Kagenou this year..
Is it me, or are a lot of black creators talking about beyblade all of a sudden?
Just in time for Year of the Dragon
Roberta at A is a crime
I died when the side character said “is d*ck riding all you do” 😂
L-Drago for real said *”AH HELL NAH, Ryuga gimme the controller I’m bout to violate”*
Heh 332.069 likes
Did anyone else forget we were only on Exhibit A?
Let em rip!
9:25 He really is in his villan arc 😂
Cj fr the highlight of my life rn
there's more?! i thought he was done after that first fight when i was a kid
OMG HE GETTIN ON THE BLADERS NOW?! FRIGGIN BET!! I LOVE YOU NOW
I'll never forget the time Ryuga literally just DROPPED L-Drago from his hand AND STILL WON AGAINST TRAINED BLADERS!!! Truly the GOAT
Killed it with skip n Shannon
He’s FINALLY BACK YALL DONT KNOW HOW HAPPY I AM
We don't talk about how my glorious king got violated by Nemesis 💀😭😭
getting jumping Beyblade was kind of crazy 💀
I think beyblade is serious
Yooooo if you're gonna do more beyblade go the OG route and cover Kai now THAT guy was MY childhood(ik my age is showing 😅)
Ryuga was goated all the way from beginning to end in Metal Fury.
It’s about time we get ryuga in here
I think bey blade metal is getting a comeback
Ok, sonic riders zero gravity music i see you Cj
Actually, it makes perfect sense that the power of friendship was able to beat that blade. You said it yourself, the thing feeds off of and grows stronger from negative emotions. Having that many people there giving out good vibes probably wrecked it harder than a taco buffet does to colons.
Bruh I used to wear my jacket to school like Ryuga in the 5th grade bro I thought I was that nigga back den.  BRO IS HIM
No matter how strong you are you aint beating plot armor
So Nostalgic Beyblades was my first anime before I knew about anime
ryuga blowing the stadium up gave majin vegata vibes. great vid 👍🏻
Xenoverse music caught me off guard 😭🙏🏾
Beyblade is that serious
I might have to rewatch the anime
ABOUT TIME CJ I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
We still got beyblade metal masters and fury to go through
I fucking love Ryuga and El Drago! The fact he comes back as an even bigger menace on top of it shows that nit a songle person that used it prior knew how to properly bring out El Drago's power.
13:17  Fun fact: According to the manga, Ryuga is actually the original dragon emperor and the first wielder of L-Drago. The reason that he is still alive and a teen is because he pulled some Aang type shit and was frozen in ice until Doji or whatever he was called found him and unfroze him. So yeah, Ryuga is even more crazy than what you talked about. Especially since he's teqnically hundreds of years old and brutually beating up some teens for no apparent reason.  Edit: It turns out that I was lied to and that ryuga did not wield L-drago before pulling the Aang typ bs and only obtained it for the first time after stealing it with Doji after he came back from being frozen.
I loved this dude so much as a kid
Ryuga was such a goat
Song at 11:55
You can’t tell me he didn’t listen to baby Kia☠️
I wonder if cj can do Neo acarcia black Air Force energy.
Ayo where ya boi Alucard  cus
The anime where spinning tops could potentially cause mass destruction and casualties, but still have the audacity to let 12 year olds play while even younger folk spectate as bombs go off in front of them.  Everyone's goated, but Ryuga is THE goat
Menace to society number one you should try rago from metal fury next
make a video on ninja kamui
Finally, he’s posting
Hey CJ Dachamp can you do a round table Video about Mikazuki Agus from Mobile suit Gundam Iro Blooded orphans. Because damn is Mika a total Demon he wiped out entire PLATOONS of soldiers with no effort and he also molly wopped the best troops Gjallarhorn had to throw at him and to top it all off he is just as RUTHLESS as both TAYNA and RORBERTA
Let goo I want a part two
Raiyuga...
Tsubasa out here with the Fabius in the 2nd Punic War strat.
CJ Dachamp is COOKING. Ryuga is the sukuna of 2000's kids. And did I hear Sonic Riders OST?! The man know what he is doing. Top teir edits and the High Quality voice overs. Can't ask for more.
Imagine stinkmeaner with Ldrago
dude your metal masters is where ryuga became just BLACK AIR FORCE ENGERGY, he didn't even use a ripper anymore
Imagine only losing to a god and u was low key hangin wit him lol
YESSSSIR i just rewatched this ryugua (rip),  keyoya and jingka were goated
my child hood has been restored
PLZ KENPACHI VIDEO NEXT!!!!! He is in the round table he deserve it !!! s2
I remember this show omfd the memories fire vid bro🔥🔥💯
I NEED THED BEAT AT THE END 16:42
YESSSSS!!!!! Thank you so much for covering this man. He truly deserves it. He’s so great.
PLEASE DO DOFLAMINGO NEXT. HES BEEN A MENACE SINCE A KID
Just hate the fact they did him like Z broly to
man u missed his best parts in fury where he just pull up on ppl and screams his stomach out and dips sasuke style
Oh shit might have to start watching beyblade again
My man's putting that sonic sound track to work. Respect.
HE POSTED AGAIN
bro said ghengis kong
Wait if we doin ryuga where is marik from yugioh at
Does mashle have potential?
I am Happy
praying for Dophy's trial to not get a strike bc Toei
Wait that was all exhibit A damn
I actually enjoyed, when Ryuga put that bih into retirement
This is a classic IDC Put this trail in the H.O.F LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Frfr, he needs another trial because this isn't the end of beyblade, that's just metal fusion we have to talk about the other 2SEASONS
0:31 Is this the BGM of Sonic Riders majestically in my ears……. THANK YOU
Ok, let's be honest... Slade has that S in the name. Like... alright, he cartoon character, yeah, he was sending mofo's to do his daily bidding of being a menace to society... but like... He was affiliated with death of everyone on Earth. Burning of the entire planet. Traumatized multiple teens, because he could, manipulated couple more, just to fuck with the same teens he traumatized... And how he specifically did Robin, Beast Boy, Raven and that earth bending girl? Bruh... give him an S. He was a menace and successfully killed off an entire planet, then not only killed off a guardian of literal hell... He pretty much helped jumping Satan himself and got a critical hit on that mofo.
AH!! i remember it as a kid!
You should’ve tied Brooklyn from the original series for this
Need a majin vegeta vid Cj 🗣️
Ryuga has been the goat since day one, top 2 and it’s not 2, spun the block since day 1 and still going
This nigga so funny bruh 😂 also putting sonic riders/tekken music over this is a chefs kiss 🤌🏾
Wait until he find out about beyblade burst
Bro can you do a video on Kenta bc he got trained by Ryuga? could be fire
Bruh I used to love beyblade metal fusion so much😭😭 you just made my inner child cry
finaly yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssssss Aiger Akabane could clap
17:10 🤣🤣🤣🤣 tech 💯😮‍💨
16:23 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣💯
17:03 Now the rules apply?
I never really took Beyblade that seriously (especially after those toy commercials) Man was I wrong!
Can’t wait for DoflaminGOAT DonquiGOATe
CJ already making us wait for a full trial and also adding Patch notes? whats next? Loot boxes? we already have season 3 on this series of videos.
Am convinced blayblade can solo naruto and one peice
W Cj this vid was fire asf!
This one was so funny, i lost my shit 😂 on this. Thanks for bringing back the good old memories of the original beyblade show. Where's that second part at tho
I knew this couldn't be everything!! After all we didn't even go over the scene where this guy just hand spun his Beyblade and won a 3v1
😂😂😂😂 please react to Tra Rags.       " You're the FIRST guy to treat me right"
10:54 idk how her body still there 😭🤣💯
you need to do either an insane asylum video or round table vid on Maric Ishtar from Yu-Gi-Oh that mans was on a different type of timing.
cj finally posted after like 6 yrs😭
bro not another cliffhanger
I've waited for this for too long
Ryuga and El Drago were demonic. This nigga just throws the bet and it starts spinning on its own
This nga is truly Sukuna before Sukuna. He was running bare fades for no reason, making ngas retire and instilling fear where ever he roamed, just like Sukuna. Can't wait for the part two, sh*ts about to go down.
Ts shit bout funny asf but Cj you gotta watch ninja kamui
Bro do yogi yuu next
Fear : Darth Vader, Hatred : Stinkmeaner, Greed : Eugene Krabs...yeah that tracks.
10:10 bro so strong he has conquerors haki
I had a feeling da boi would be on this list eventually.
Where the patch notes at? I’m interested in them
WTF!!!!
Bro Beyblade metal fusion was my favorite show as a kid I mean I still am a kid but this is so nostalgic
Why no be talking about scissor seven fr
Nobody in Beyblade Burst can step to Him, I still want another sequel or at least a crossover event between metal and burst.
If I'm being honest ryugas bay was always gonna lose to plot....if your shit absorbs negativity in a anime you already packed up soon enjoy it while it lasts
LESSGOOOOOOO
2:05 naaaw even fucking Moses used this shit ☠
Cj watches nxt confirmed 😂
Omg I thought it would never see the day where I hear Ryuga name again at man was a monster back when I was still watching beybalde
Power of Friendship robs another GOAT 😞
CJ can you do my scar from primal is him
Love this video!!! Ty cj
We need that next parts🙏🏽
I saw the video noti but I didn’t watch it asoon as it dropped but now ima watch the video and drop another comment after this funny ass shit
LETS GOOOO, ANOTHER BANGER 🔥🚗🔥🚗🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🦅🦅🦅
Pls do a video about Accelerator from the Railgun series😁
I'll be dead honest, back in the glory days of CN mornings with anime, this and Pokemon cutting on was it and this man was always a dark horse name, the moment he arrived he was causing havoc.
And their beys were destroyed 14:28
THIS IS A CERTIFIED HOOD CLASSIC🗣️🔥
Sukuna only S++? That's based off the anime right because in the manga.. Sukuna is that dog up there with the top two.
I lowkey liked ryuga more than Jinga. That’s how cool he was.
“Glaze me!!!” is WILD
NGL we need a video of the minority hunter😂
Where is dio on the list
Did he say ali
Yay another cj upload
Beyblade is that serious indeed, they literally have an attack chopper filled with beyblades
Bro you need to make more videos
Let’s be honest a beyblade could probably beat goku
Beyblade got F**KING WIERD after I dropped off!
Ryuga is on top
Please do a video on phi in beyblade burst turbo
Please do a video on phi in beyblade burst turbo
Please do a video on phi in beyblade burst turbo
Please do a video on phi in beyblade burst turbo

BEYBLADE RERISING IN POPULARITY AND IM HERE FOR IT
Please do a video on phi in beyblade burst turbo
Now you
Does anyone realize how bayblade could powerscale to dbz?
These videos are Gas🔥🔥🔥
Why Beyblade of all things
I thought Ryuga was a brother for a while. Apparently some Asians has a slightly darker skin tone
Love seeing the beyblade streak on YT feed me, this series was too crazy
4:41 bro I laughed so hard which clip did he even used
Yes yes exibit b and c
If he got a forbidden beyblade HOW IS HE ALLOWED TO ENTER TOURNAMENTS 😭
Beyblade is not that serious: Children's dead bodies:
It has only been 10 minutes and this dude is cooking everybody like godd dammm
The funny thing is each season could be an exhibit for Ryuga because the DOG never wavered from the beginning to the end only ever losing to plot
Man i swear this man and syn share one brain when it comes to content
Next vid about marik ishtar from yu gi oh pleaseeeee
Im legit surprised i never noticed how crazy this show was sometimes.
Since Cj got talking about Beyblade of all things now, I'm kinda hoping he starts with Yu-Gi-Oh! and see what he can do with it, both anime and manga versions. Also, Ryuga still up there with my childhood antagonists not only because how wild this kid (and yeah, all these bladers are damn kids capable of destroying cities at the start) was, but my most memorable thing about him was that I was watching once an episode of him and just when his Special move landed my TV started malfunctioning. My kid self honestly thought "Did he just crashed up the TV!?"
The fact this was only season one and didn't even mention the DISRESPECT he pulled on jack is astounding and truly speaks to the dragon emperor's legacy
Poor Hikaru 😭
dayum like i said before what the hell is up beyblade videos popping up everywhere on youtube all of a sudden lmao
shii I need to watch beyblade again bro goddam
Thanks. I really wanted people to talk about him
10:00 bro really pulled out the whoop that trick chants for this man
No way I’ve finally began rewatching this show after a decade and CJ drops a vid about the GOAT of this show. I thought this joint was fake it was too good to be true.
We need part 2
Holy shit, why is everyone started to cover Beyblade all of a sudden?
AY LIKE THIS SHI I NEED THIS NXT WEEK
Eyjo can you make a video on Fabio from Pokémon (sinnoh league). Bro really destroyed everybody with a single Pokémon and even the mc could not defeat him (but he made him use his second Pokémon lol) He really just went in there, destroyed everybody and just left without any type of explanation
It gives me so much joy to see my favorite character from one of my favorite anime on here gotta clap it up👏👏👏👏 and u know part 2 is even more DEVIOUS
When i saw that that was only exibit A thats when i realized HE IS HIM
Ryuga ain't even the menace, the beyblade is the culprit. Ryuga is a fraud. Ldrago possessed this man. Ldrago need to meet truck-kun.
And people ask me why I prefer metalfusion over burst
Cj should do ninja kamui
genuine Ryuga voice there 6:20
Bro read my mind
My mans chose Ryuga over Kai Hiwatari OR Brooklyn (G-Revolution).... But, hey, I ain't gonna complain that Beyblade is getting attention 😂
still waiting for Spectra Phantom and Helios vid tho
Da a video on Lord Valdemort next my guy🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Bring accelerator in the trial
Can you do Naofumi next please
WELL SHIT! A BEYBLADE VIDEO BY CJDACHAMP
Yo cj when are you going to make the Saitama video?
Beyblade was NEVER THIS SERIOUS BRO 🙏😭
😞 gotta wait till next week to see my favorite match (Ryuga vs Jack) and then more time till we talk about all of Fury 😩
Vruhh this thing got patch notes this crazy!!!
Bruh I’m here for this beyblade resurgence this shi was always lit
I dont know why but i Was seeing this would be to nice and funny,and i know you would make a Video about this  op "put here the bad N word" 😂
you should cover free from beyblade burst
YOOOO LET IT RIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPP
Ryuga, Vegeta, Sasuke, the rival has always been my favorite and Ryuga came first. I was a ground zero Ryuga and L-Drago glazer. I thought it was so cool that L-Drago was the only bey ever to have left rotation. And that was only changed one time in the sequel show you'll be covering next. I cannot wait for this shit dawg.
Next week sounds like next month 🥲😂
In part 2 i wanna see the match between rayuga and peacock.......absolute masterpiece
God damn. Next to Ginka, fucking Ryuga really was the GOAT. The dude was motherfucking HIM before he even officially showed up.
Yoh bro,can you do SHANGRI-LA FRONTIER,that anime is peak and the animation is gonna be GOATED when season 1 ends.
That final fight was someone remembering that 'Hol up, this be a kid's show, the villain can't win no matter how much of a OP Legend we made him, throw in that thick ass plot armour, screw the rules. We need to 'fix' this before we have to answer to the execs!'
Why tf did all these mfs randomly start putting Ryuga on blast? Even as a toddler i knew his ass was a menace hut to be covered by this many channels is crazy, shout to my boy Kenta, ya heard, bros a god now cause of Ryuga.
My brother in christ what is your posting schedule 😭
I’m your 277,222 view please notice me
Dude beyblade back then was so extreme for absolutely no reason
Script writers always fucking shit up..
Finally u're back
Bro you the best to ever do it I would want the videos faster but you cant rush greatness
I’m surprised you didn’t add the sequels to this vid
Iam gonna say this once..Ryuga  IS THE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAT  Btw when are you making an Aizen video
Blud be posting once a month now, damn
At first I thought he was from yugioh lmaoo 😅
Cj needs to put a bunch of tekken characters on trial
Mannnnn one about metal fusion!!! You the goat fr for this!
Its a new day and a new vid by CJ ☕️ wake up and smell that mf coffee!! ❤
Holy shit this is definitely part of the Yu Gi Oh! School of making children’s games a global threat
He looks like your average run-of-the-mill overconfident background character, but no. This man is the combination of Gandalf, LeBron, Tyson, Messi. You could even call LDrago the holy bey like literal MOSES was using that junk.
🐐
We need an episode for my boy Mash
I love seeing people coming back to my childhood with the true goat of menaces. They done did Ryuga dirty in metal fury’s ending smh.
OMFG EXHIBIT A? I HAVE NEVER WATCHED THIS ANIME. I HAVE NEVER WANTED ANYTHING MORE. EXHIBIT B PLZ.
about time cj dachamp jumped on the beyblade track now we must call ryuga ryugoot
Do a Yami video pls
I've been waiting for this video
THE DRAGON EMPEROR SOLO'S EVERYONE
Marik Ishtar from yu gi oh that guy is something else Cj I mean it the level of mind games He uses makes him more creepy
All that being Exhibit A is fucking crazy😭
YES YES BRO I AINT EVEN WATCH YET Ryuga is just HIM
I am glad he finally made an episode on beyblade. I have watched so many "beyblade was not or was that serious" videos
Bro Ryuga is one of my favorite characters of all time, and to see him getting the respect he deserves brings me to joy
Bruh the RDC Lee Cameo ✊🏾😂🫡💯
now where tf is the kenpachi ep
This the best shit I've ever seen. Your commentary is GOAT status.
I knew one day this vid would come
Watch season 2 and 3. It gets worse😂
"Round table has patch notes" Damn. That means we can see some fall down a tier or two, if they slip up
hm, SpaceToon really sugar coated it for us huh?
Bruh ryuga was the original menace before madara was even a thing! Thanks for recognizing my favorite childhood show! 😊
My man Mugen still sittin in the corner as a founding memeber of the roundtable waiting for CJ to tell all those uncultured what a G he is!
Do one on byron love aka ahprodite
strange that CJ didn't make a "take this L" joke because of Ldragon
This anime is goated
E
I was about to say, no way exhibit A is over there’s more right *clicks on the vid to see the time* Me: no way it’s over
PLEASE DO A VIDEO ABOUT "MUZAN KIBUTSUJI"!!! 😱💔
I'm so looking forward to exhibit B because there Ryuga pulls one if the most disrespectful power moves I have ever witnessed in any show
Ryuga walked so sukuna could run      And sukuna still lightyears behind him
The last thing I was expecting at the RTOBAF : a Beyblade character lol But hey, you said it yourself : bro is running on negativity, so, of course, the PoF might weaken him somehow. So, his loss is KINDA justified... and we still have 2 exhibits to go, so, he might make a comeback ! Taking a L is one thing but getting stronger from it is another !
ryuga having to be taken out by plot and writers is point worthy cause if you are so strong the writers have to use the power of bullshit to beat you I say thats a bonus cause you caused the writers to have to say pause how the hell do we beat him and if not a point make that a half lose at least cause that still some bullshit and not a true win for gingka the plot armour abuser
Do you take requests?
PLS PLS do a muichiro videi
18:10 CONSISTENT CHRIS JACKSON DA CHAMP??
Bro cant make a bad video I'm convinced of that fact 10/10 beauty, Also I would love to see a Junko aslyum episode or to see cell on the round table that would be cool (I suggest you look at the dbz abridged version of cell too)
you missed a point as he destroyed property on his awakening and that was not his so it counts
Rlly bro? Beyblade? Kick this man from the table
Do you even have a discord?
Buddy got a Fortnite W against those 99 bay bladers 💀💀
Cj's consistency feels unnatural sometimes but fuck it, let's GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ryuga literally clapped Hikaru's cheeks so hard several seasons down the line she still had PTSD
Calm down its not that serious 😭
Beyblade was wildn.straight up murder. Reminds me of zoids
Ryuga theme song gotta be babykia or glokk40spazz that’s all i can see him listening too
And we can't forget how fire his theme music for L Drago Destructor is like goddamn everytime it plays Ryuga performs one of the most badass moments in the series
Finally the Toyverse of the early 2000s is getting some spotlight! Yu-gi-oh, Bakugan, and Beyblade!
Cj last year yu posted on my birthday December the 2nd can yu do it again this year
no way yujiro is above sukuna
Yes, a video about drip yuga!!!
Ryuga is personally my favorite villain in the whole series, he was actually a threat worh Ldrago at his side
why am i hearing Apex Legends Theme song ?
Reminder that this dude only lost 2 fights in the ENTIRE SHOW when he appeared. Yep Ginka never won against him ever again after that
WE NEED A PART TWO FROM THE OTHER TWO SERIES MASTERS AND FURRY
Ryuga was the first to pull out a hollow purple😂
My glorious king
Didn't he like assualt a lion at some point in the show?
this was exibit a?
Never thought blade blade could be this serious.
This man is a GOAT! 😆😁 Whileni don’t believe his fight against Jinga was a steal, this man is number 2 if not number 1 in his world for a reason. 😎😎😎 He OWNS every scene he’s in. ESPECIALLY after he evolved in to Meteor L Drago.
Man u think Hitler had L dragon in his back pocket
We making it out of the elementary school days with this one gang!!! 💯💯💯👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Fianllyyyy bro damnnn❤❤❤
Try ranking that Agnalogia from that anime Fairy Tail
I have to give you props for using Schwarzerblitz footage in the segment during the fight between Ryuga and Kyoya at 12:36.
I recognize that score screen. My man has played some battle tanx
Nice:)
You know  that shi aint coming next week
I just love how he LITERALLY Hollow purpled Hikaru so randomly 😭
BRO IS THE GOOOOOOAT!!!!
I would once again like to nominate Kiba and/or Jack Atlas for the round table.
have fun doing the other show in the metal series
YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT RYUGA FROM BEYBLADE METAL AND BEYBLADE METAL FURY
He can’t keep getting away with this
Ryuga is easily the best part of Beyblade.
I was just talkin about how if cj made a video on this guy it would be good (I CANT WAIT FOR THE METEOR DRAGON OOO BOI)
The fact that this whole video was only Exhibit A. Says a lot of bout dude 😭 none of the previous dudes had this much evidence on ONE exhibit 😂
hatred, - whats good  nyukkah!!!!
bro is it just me or there is so much beyblade metal saga videos
Just yesterday I thought about you making a ryuga video XD.
MAN I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I SAW THIS POP UP ON MY FEED . I LOVE RYUGA AND I WANTED HIM TO GET THE RECOGNITION HE DESERVED . I'M SAVING THIS VIDEO I WILL WATCH IT WITH KFC
I was literally hoping you would do this for the longest. Thank you.
Never thought I would see Baybladers in this. I could never get into the Show, but it has to have its Fans or it would not still be going almost as long as Pokemon. Never expected a show about Combat Dreidel to become this big.
BRO THE FACT THAT U DID RYUGA IS A SIGN FOR U TO DO REDEYE
Even CJ haven't escaped the nostalgia trip of Beyblade Metal series.
Hey Cj, Yk I don’t get to say it often enough but this sum good shi here. I’m still repping whenever a Yusei vid comes out
Guys where can I watch bey blade I’ve been hearing a lot about it
Before 24h mfs here👇🏽
😂
Ok
YES! YES! YES! YES! THE GOATTTT
Ryuga scales higher then dbs
babe wake up cj posted
Speaking of chracters i have one i would like to put in the asylum, Cid Kageno from Eminence in Shadow.
You know I never found myself actually wanting to watch beyblade before this video but I might actually check it out
Ryuga was my favorite Beyblade character growing up. It’s surreal to see him and the Beyblade Metal series getting attention nowadays
Knew exactly who this was😂, the daaaays. Hot blazing carribean sun with me my cousins and our metal beyblades. 👌🏾
Real ogs fw Tyson n Kai
the skip and shannon impressions were on point😭😭😭
WHEN HE SAID THERE ARE 2 MORE EXHIBITS IT MADE MY JAW DROP NGL
As somebody who never got into Beyblade, this shit is hilarious. Beyblade seems wilder than I expected.
BEYBLADE? W
The voice actor of Ryuga was truly goated. Bro went from being so unserious in Metal Fusion (seriously, hear his “you’re being COWARDLY” line in his battle with Ginga”) to being the *most* serious dude in the room in the span of a few months.
Yo CJ start posting on your gaming YouTube channel now
This man was the MEANCE OF BEYBLADE LETS NOT FORGOT WHAT HE DID TOO OTORI
the goat has returned.
11:06 that's the biggest oof in a anime
ryuga the goat
🔥🔥🔥🔥
AFTER HIS MONTHLY UPLOAD SCHEDULE. THE GOAT IS FINALLY BACK
Ain’t even watch the video yet and I know this goin be gas  😂 Rygu was a true menace
Btw the only other lose he took was against a  G O D 😮
Bro was so villainous the second I touched the video YouTube crashed
We not gonna talk about that crazy-ass snake sub-boss they had to run through to even get at Ryuga? That man was just actually fucking crazy and the ONLY part of Dark Nebula Ryuga didn't eat.
Ryuga is one of the kings of violation and property damage. I honestly don't how know his later entrances don't cause massive property damage.
That was just exhibit A??? 😂
Do yu from the boxer
When i was a kid I had L drago & the feeling was amazing trying to actually do the move on ur friends… THEN MY BOI METEOR L DRAGO WAS THE SHIT WHEN HE THROUGH THAT BEYBLADE
I hope everyone like the video we need that part 2 RYUGA and L-drago is a legend!!!
W Lebroskiis cameo
Ngl power of friendship is trash
I’ve ask for this
The dawg himself finally posted
Oh yes. The biggest HIM of my childhood joined the chat. *THE* goat himself, Ryuga
Bruh Ryuga tryna take Buu's place
Ryuga definition of monster thank you so much for showcasing him an giving him the proper recognition. Part 2 so stoked for it
If you look at LDrago in real life the only reason why it was so feared was because it spun counterclockwise
Man hit her wit a hollow purple😭🤦🏽‍♂️
YO CJ WELCOME BACK BRO!
I CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW HAPPY I AM TO SEE YOU DOING A VIDEO ON MY MAN RYUGOAT
seto kaiba should be on the list
1:25 this broke me  into laughing so much😭
Ryuga's track record so long exhibit A was a whole 18 minutes long! Imagine exhibits B and C🤣
I stopped watching beyblade after the early 00s I never knew it got serious af
SHIT FINALLY😈
IT bringing back memoris
This man doesn't deserve a seat... He deserves he's very own round table just for him
Upload more please😢
Cant wait for him to talk about his adventures in the wild Its my fav arc from beyblade both from the story writing perspective and character development of both Ryuga and the pipsqueak
4:47 AYO💀
SO HAPPY YOU DID RYUGA BRO REALLY DESERVES IT FOR ALL THE SHIT HE PUT PEOPLE THROUGH
Ayo
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOE THIS DAY  THIS LAD IS BUILT DIFFERENT
Can CJ do A kenpachi ZAkrki one that shi would be fire
Why this big bill looking ahh kid being a menace he’s name anit lil Johnny bro got them black ground forces 😂
We knew this was on the way 🤝🏾
Ryuuga IN THE WHOLE SHOW HAD LIK ONLY 2 L’S 1 was to the main character makes sense THE OTHER WAS TO THE GOD OF DESTRUCTION THAT WAS LITERALLY BORN FROM HIS POWER 😭 he was literally the strongest whole series and he was so strong that the REMNANTS of his power could turn a normal nigga lik kenta into a nigga dat can hang wit GOD😭💀
I swear, everytime a character named Ryuga pulls up on screen, they damn well became a straight menace and violated everyone on sight
Ryuga is one of my favorite character in beyblade.cj can you do about Johan liberty and Aizen pls🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
That’s the start
Please do bleach next
Was worried cj wasnt going to hit us with a black history month banger 😂
I do not see enough people talking about beyblade metal fusion it was so good for no reason
such a classic goat 😂😂 W video ong
We definitely need a Yusuke Video
My parlay 😂😂
Can you do inazuma eleven
Nah used to watch this shit all the time when I was younger
Cj now that you did beyblade you gotta do bakugan fr I gotta see the homie Masquerade or Spectra in the round table or from Each yugioh season there's Marik,Zane,Jack Atlas,Kite,Shun,and playmaker
I alr can,t wait for B and C dude
I would love to see a og trigun video because you are hilarious
Pls do 2012 shredder
Reverse Flash when?!
Part 2 plssssssss
Welcome back bro
The lights to bright had me rolling 😂😂😂
I am LITERALLY HAVING A MENTAL BREAKDOWN Because of this man.
Ryuga was an even bigger menace in the manga. (Yes! This show actually has a manga adaptation!) He was actively trying to kill ginga and everyone else in the stadium arena. His final battle against ginga was much more dire with everyone being injured and crying in pain begging for ginga to win.
Yeah!
No, scratch that you made my whole year
I'm glad people are finally catching on to the absurdity of beyblade metal fury. They are literally fighting gods at the end of the show.
Bro you don't understand how many of my classmates back in school LOVED L drago, Ryuga might as well be the main character because no one cared for Pegasus. It was always Ldrago or the side characters beys and that's it
BRO IS THE 🐐,RAYUGA Absolutely Destroyed the Table,I have watched the series 7 times in 1 years Niggas,don't come at i will make it painful
Been a while since I've seen the Metal Saga, probably the best trilogy from Beyblade.
Sooo when are we getting The Shredder at the trials?
10:03 Ayo is that Philly I hear!?😂
Not my boy Ryuga bro was a menace when it came to BB 💯
I was waiting for you to make a Ryuga video, if anybody deserves to be in the Coucil of Black Airforce Energy, it's definitely him.
Ruyga is damn strong and is  damn  GOAT ,what did she know, maybe in a future video you will make anime characters who survived/cooked truck-kun
i remebr when ginga laost it when that man ame face to face scarred me
Day one of removing vegeta off the round table
Ah man you just made my hole month thank you
i remember beyblade n damn was ryuga a menace. he was my fav character ngl
Anyone know the sound that played at 7:21 ?
Naw, the greatest violation in the show is what Hades did to Julian.
Forgot to add that sonic riders ost that too elite
Where can I watch dis
2:34 is my favourite part
Now I know CJ uses twitter, they were talking how Ryuga could bitchslap dragonball fighters.
Hell yeah
Beyblade video, I win today
As of this comment, you got 44K upvotes Cj; I'm expect that part 2 by next week my boy. While you at it too, how about bring up Kai from the OG series, he may have lost a few times but that man was the hardest MF in the og series, I mean do I need to bring up his fight with brooklyn? shit was heavy as fuck man! Tho I will say Ryuga vs GOD of all things was hype as hell, man put up a better fight by himself than everyone else together did, and it's been a damn decade since then man
The patch notes are fine, but you can at least buff Slade he should be at least one letter grade above Toji
A god vs a piece of plastic trapped in a crystal, who's gonna win?
I've been waiting for this moment. The ultimate beyblade menace has joined the round table ❤😂
Fuck blowing her back out he blew the back out of that building with a children’s toy
New video 😂 yaaaaayyyyyy
Dragon Emperor ✨
Ryuga is like what Goku Black was supposed to be but in beyblade form. Dude LIVES to fight and instigate in battle and then feeds off the anger to keep fighting more. NOT TO MENTION, he’s going out of his way to battle some of these niggas. Imagine if Goku went up to Piccolo and Kami or whoever in the world martial arts tournament in the semi final and said, “nah fuck all that waiting, these hands need the work now”
Beyblade metal series was the peak of beyblade imo
0:13 CJDACHAMP CAME BACK WHEN WE NEEDED HIM
I feel like the red just wanted the match to end so they didn’t do anything for the interference
Clarence dicklord the news reporter is back lol
Ain't no way you said Exhibit A done 12 seconds before the end of the vid
Metal Fusion was crazy, can't wait for Metal Masters.
Nah the writers wanted to glaze this man to the end but they were like both times. If you watched the show you know he gotta get cooked so the main character can shine. They must've been crying in 2009 the goats time is near animators crying and everything as well. Dang cartoon network ceo at the time was shedding a single tear.
Day light Robbery bruh ☠️
About dam time
Ladies and gentlemen the greatest robbery of all time
How about tekken eight video to 3 characters stood on business jin Kazama Kazuya Mishima Reina Mishima.
My favorite childhood anime sooooo underrated
Like the video for the dragon emperor 🐉
Aint no way
Can we get attack on titan Final chapter Levi😊please
wait that was only exhibit A!? bruh, who is this GOAT!?
not my face actual jaw droppin when bro said A
Watch this and the sequela as a kid, I stll remeber both, and they were such good childood show❤
Finally the goat is back!!!!!!
This man took a middle school physics class and brought the whole world to its knees with this knowledge.
LMAOOO , “ the light were brighter than expected “ 😂😂
FINALLY someone showing Ryuga love!!!
I think this was the best introduction yet
Why everybody back on Beyblade suddenly bro?😂
HE POSTED 😭
Double Sunday
8:17
The video we didn’t know we all needed. You’re one of a kind cj bringing my child hood memories back! Keep up the good work mane‼️🤘
cjdabestcommentator
I am absolutely LOVING that there has been a resurgence of interest in Beyblade in the past few weeks! It seems like several random things from our childhood have been periodically getting huge resurgences on Youtube and I LOVE it! First it was MLP:FIM and now Beyblade? I wonder what's next?  Also I cannot WAIT for him to cover Ryuga's mentor arc, that shit was some of my favorite moments he was involved in, so much so it stuck with me better and harder then his initial debut and arc as just "the villain Gingka" fights. Its what I remembered before the fact he used to just be the big bad so I (hope) CJ does Mentor Dragon Emperor JUSTICE!!
You look up aura in the dictionary and it was just a picture of him
It... can't be.... THE LEGEND CJ HAS RETURNED!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What is the name of the song at 9:21
wait i just realised that as all exhibit a XD
Dropppp that shitttttttt sooon bro that man is the goattttt g
I have vague recollections of watching this show *ages ago* when I was a kid, but I don't remember it being this *crazy* 💀
3:01 he gotta go to at least A teir just for this alone
I fuckin screamin you brought Ryuga in this bitch he was a fuckin menace period. He was afro's plug cause mans was packin mofo.. UP 🚬 😏
😂 Please do Chisato from Lycoris Recoil
This man dropped a nuke to get his 50K points for the tournament 😂😂
buu still more menacing and disrespectful
lmaooo W CJ vid obviously 😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
I ABSOLUTELY LOVED BEYBLADE I WATCHED AS A KID AND WHEN I REWATCHED IT i realized how trash the quality was but it still was awesome
That was only exhibit A 😮😮
Bayblade?
In all honesty I never thought I'd see Cj do a roundtable video with beyblade of all animes
This guy was more of a menace than I thought
Beyblade battle me i have meteo l drago
Ryuga this guy really sent a nigga to retirement Nah this man is a menace
Love yo content
Please do shredder
Part 2 gonna be straight heat 🔥 ..if this just exhibit A 😂😂😂
Bro ryuga is a menace to society!
Bro if CJ and Devonte did a video it would gain have a million cause there literally do the same thing and they both love anime and there my favorites I would cry
“Because Ryuga is a trollll” I ain’t never heard a more true statement than that 💀
I didn't remember beyblades being THAT intense 😧😦
Ryuga was the Dragon Emperor of Fades. A absolute Menace and a true GOAT!
ive realized whenever its a table about the round table i always have red beans and rice
finally this man posted 🙇🏾‍♂️🙇🏾‍♂️🙇🏾‍♂️
Can you do Kira from Death Note next?
I have waited for *YEARS* for Ryuga to get a Black Air Force Activity Trial. That man was the biggest menace I knew from my childhood.
12:36 I had a double take when seeing Schwarzerblitz in this video🤣🤣🤣 I wasn't expecting the Sambiong Vs Lazor ring out🤣
Yessssss, I have been waiting for you to do a vid on the best character in beyblade!!!
HE FINALLY DID IT!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ryuga wasn't someone who just coasted by on the power of his legendary artifact - He trained harder than anyone. He trained harder then the MC, he trained harder than Rock Lee, and by following his training, he got a side character to stand up to the MC.  Ryuga put in his blood, sweat, and tears, which is why he earned the title of THE GOAT.
bro ryuga the type of guy to violate the writers for f*ckin him up
Beylade brust video when? 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Bro Ryuga makes Sukana and Frieza look like frauds.
Still early, haven’t watched the vid yet, yet alone fuxking beyblade in years but I can already tell this shit Finna be funny
Ryuga is so broken that CJ had to make 1 exhibit per video. The BFA energy is off the charts with this one!!!
first 20 second clip had me thinking ain't this just beyblade??????
For Doflamingo, I know we won’t get a video, cause toei, but just to add something, that man banged a girl who’s memory he had fucked with, a girl who’s dad he had framed for murder. Dude is a demon
YOOOOO FINALLY. THE LONG AWAITED VIDEO
11:53 took me out 😂
Willing to bet Hitler used it before all things considered.  Lol
I have been waiting for this day to come for so long! THANK YOU CJ!!!
You might need to do a "Disrespectful Moments in Anime: Beyblade Edition" tbh. The amount of disrespect in metal series alone was insane.
AY YOSHIKAGE KIRA FOR THE ASYLUM SERIES PLZZZ
6:45 no cap, I’d live
i hope beyblade mfb blows up in MASSIVE  numbers so takaratomy can start producing mfb again, i mean, what kind of person doesnt want an authentic spin stealing meteo l drago?
U gotta do a pt2 for metal masters
For thousands of years I’ve waited for such a trial that I didn’t even ask for but was presented with we are truly blessed thank you CJDachamp
Nahhh this is overcooked food
I think traumatising people should be a point or two cause not many people do that in many shows at all
Yeahh buddy
How many likes we need?
Ryuga was that guy fr
And this is only the first season this fool ryuga has more menace fights like fighting a dark god by himself with no help
I haven’t watched this yet but seeing Moses with a bayblade is making me check out the series
Yes yesyesssssss🎉🎉🎉🎉 he did it
THATS WHY HE’S THE GOAT, THE GOAT 🗣️
APEX LEGENDS
You say he's the goat... but og beyblade has some DAWGS that you should check out for the disrespectful series
Ryuga deserves extra points for the way he disrespected Gingka and his dad the first time he fought Gingka. That speech was pure, unfiltered disrespect. He roasted him so bad that he gave him PTSD. This has to be one of the top 10 roasts in all of anime.  6:38 - These guys might be alive, because these guys are not human. Kenta (Gingka glazer #1) can rep 300+. Having a beyblade makes them superhuman, as we can see people jump off buildings and land just fine. Ryuga jumps 50 feet like it's nothing.
It's finally here, been check in daily waiting for the next video. Your videos always slap
LOL you got the best edits
What makes all of this worse is that he’s only 13😭
Rygua fr treated L drago like a nigga woth robux and a booster starter pack to level up faster 💀
LDrago is just disrespectful leave Cheinca alone bro
The goat.
Wait, isn't it pronounced ree-u-ga?
I'm waiting for the second part
I've been waiting for Ryuga to get involved with the Round Table!!!
you know someone's diabolical when they start killing characters in a kids show
Aight cj since ya doing Beyblade you better not leave out burst because it's a "kids show" some of the characters get upto some wiiiiiild shi.Banger video tho!!
U forgot that ryagu gave that dude Subasa schizophrenia
You cannot grasp how long I've waited for Beyblade to be noticed by this channel.
What’s up with all the beyblade stuff as of late? lol. Not complaining, just surprised
Yeeeaaaahhhh beyblade was always this serious
Editing is always peak
6:51 counterpoint - this is fiction, specifically anime.
CJ posting on my birthday??? I Alr know it’s boutta be lit
And haters thought bayblade was nothing but a bunch of spinning tops HELL NO people didn't know what they were missing.
Bro was a menace
I swear, metal fusion Ryuga’s theme song was Die Very Rough by Mario Judah, from the raw vibes he was putting out
I haven’t heard that name in so long. Nostalgia hit me like a truck
Man this entire show was goated when I was a kid. Now I gotta research the entire series
I don’t know why people just glazing bayblade out of no where 😂
The Boy is Goated🐐🐐🤯
Oh nah that kahoot music still hits till this day
FINALLY!!!!
Abraham Lincoln probably used LDrago to free the slaves. Think about it. If Moses used a BeyBlade to part the Red Sea and LDrago has been used by leaders across all time there’s a good chance Lincoln or someone else used it in the civil war in this verse. Prob not canon but the idea of it makes me happy in a way I can’t describe.
What is beyblade even about 💀
Cj dachamp a real w for making a video about Ryuga 💯
Ahh Zeref the dude who lost to the power of frie- wrong dragon dude my bad
Wtf was bayblade about bro...
THE DRAGON EMPEROR WILL FORVER LIVE ON
40K in the first 4 hours drop that shit sooner than a week lol.
His sheer awesomeness is the entire foundation of my childhood obsession with BeyBlade. Bro was him in every single way from start to finish and I’m glad we’re all coming together to appreciate it. Thank you Cj for doing the absolute GOAT justice. Rest in power big dawg Ryuga 🕊️ and congrats on 1.77m subs Cj.
do video games characters there are many things like tekkens kazuya
Bro I've started taking any Bay Blade conversation vastly more seriously after people start posting Bey Blade is not that series and I see people destroying asteroids, islands, children doing crazy weight training, destroying buildings, and literally killing people over a Bey Blade. Honestly my bad Bey Blade, it's been years and I wasn't familiar with your game.
RYUGA IS HIMMY UGA IN ALL OF BEYBLADE HISTORY 🤯🤯🤯🤯
1:49 cap... MOSES!? I'm damn done!!😂😂
Beyblade was my damn childhood so I can safely say that ryuga took the childrens game to the next level
Bro do Phi from burst next
Ryuga: Dark Move: Dragon Emperor Soring Bite Strike
10:34 Uh CJ my boy that is a Final flash not a Galick Gun.
1:37😮😮😮 oh bruh...
Ryuga is HIM. He only lost to a power of friendship and a god who had not only stolen Ryuga own power but also had power of every single legendary blader and every single bey in existance and Ryuga still gave him a run for his money.  Long live the undisputed Dragon Emperor.
Hold up! He's going to the TABLE!? I gotta check this out!! 😮
Yeah see theres something that should be counted as a Bonus point for certain characters and that is their JPN VAs and incase you didnt know, the Jpn VA for Ryuga is Kenjiro Tsuda. Some notiable roles aside from The GOAT of Beyblade is the GOAT of Blue Eyes Seto Kaiba/related characters, Mifune from SE, Bruford from JJBA pt 1, Monspeet from SDS, Overhaul from MHA, Joker from Fire Force, Jigen/Ishhiki from Boruto, Nanami in JJK and Kishibe from CSM. Like I am as straight as they come and even I question things when the man Speaks
Was that Leland at @4:42 ? lmao
beyblade? 😂 id bully this little dummy
Benkei walked so LeBron fans could run
This man only lost TWICE in the whole saga and it was only because of gingka plot armour
Finally after all these year my boy finally getting some recognition
Ryuga’s one of the most underrated characters in all fictional media, anime or otherwise.
Support comment to hope for parts 3 & 4 of Tokyo Revengers down the line.
gojo learned hallow purple from OG rauga
NEXT WEEK oh nahh I need the rest rn 😭😭😭
Ryuga also trained one of the MCs
Beyblades in real life: Ruins Mom's bathtub.  Beyblades in the anime: Obliterates multiple stadiums, parts the Red Sea, assists the ROMAN FRIGGING EMPIRE in conquest.
Shoutout ghengis kong
Seeing this got me watching my fav eps of beyblade with Brooklyn.
we need the second part of this, please!!!!
Ryuga >>> beyblade burst
My MAN RYUGGGA Glad as hell to see MF coverage
omg as a man of the OG beyblade gen seeing Ryuga get mentioned , I'm all here for it
:)
I was waiting for this specific character
Metal masters and metal fury ryuga was more menacing than the literal villains of the season cmon it deserves a video
L Drago was just so OP could have anyone moving different
Bro's use of music is EXQUISITE, im catching ALL the references
WOOOOOO YEEEAAAA BABBBYYYYYY THATS WAHT I'VE BEEN WAITNG FOR!!!!!!!!!!
YESSIR CJ GOT MY MY GLORIOUS GOAT THE DRAGON EMPEROR RYUGA 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
I remember watching Subasa vs Ryuga. That was epic
Right one of the true goats that lost to plot, he would have one everything if it wasn't a kids show but that's why I love this character
AYO we talking about beyblade now this definitely finna be a banger
HE'S MY GOATTTTTT 🗣💯💯💯💯💯
Another day
Welp see you next week because the dragon empire is coming back in blood!
Bro you gotta do YAMI Marik from Yu-Gi-Oh
DO AIZEN DUDE
Yo CJ when you gonna play poppy playtime chapter 3 on the other channel. 😅
FINALLY I BEEN WAITING FOR THESE LOL
Gotta love the OG Beyblade, pre-teens were catchin Straight Bodies!!!
Gon head and get that 2 Million CJ‼️
Finally someone putting  respect on beyblade. This Mf was raw. 😊
I’m glad MFB stood the test of time and damn has it aged WELL
I knew bro had to make video on this MF
The fact that moise splat the sea with a Beyblade in this universe is crazy 💀
Let’s fucking go. Been waiting for another round of the round table.
the menace of beyblade is someone that belongs at the table
Bro was literally z broly 🙏🏽😭‼️
Gingka vs Ryuga The greatest blader of today vs The greatest blader of history
I would do anything for metal fusion beys to hit shelves again. ANYTHING
mans got robbed o7
Can you do a video on Pokémon XYZ Semi-Finals/Finals or Ash vs Leon?
Glaze used in any since especially in this situation is just diabolical 😂 😂
He is gojo grandfather
Wait until we get to the Metal Fury comp
Holy fuck, I didn't think Beyblade was THIS serious
Patch notes man I hope my inf black force exp doesn’t get fixed
I'm glad Ryuga is getting the recognition he deserves he was on demon Timing 24/7
He has to mention ryuga spinning his bey WITH HIS HAND and beating like 20 people in exhibit b or c
Now he just got to cover his time in metal masters and fury as his only other loss was against a literal god of destruction
CJ Dachamp just brought back my childhood.
Man I'm glad that Beyblade is getting more recognition man cj you a goat for this
So in this universe Jesus created bayblade
Been waiting for a Beyblade video
If this is the case are other sports anime on the table? Is so, Akashi Seijuro would be fun to see here
It’s not plot it’s blader spirt
😂❤
WE NEED MORE BEYBLADE RELATED VIDEOS
What’s crazy is the only Ls he ever took were to plot alone.
Ryuga vs Yui would be such a cool fight
Damn Plot always being as inconsistent as Phuck when protecting the Mc at the end with Friendship nonsense
Rough is just like that guy from anos the one who got killed many times
Ryuga and le drago is literally me. Baison from sf
I was waiting for u to talk about Beyblade and Ryuga cuz he was THAT NIGGA😅🔥🔥🔥
weird episode lol I can't take this one seriously~IMO
12:11 he?
Man i was just thinking about ryuga and you making a video about him perfect timing
FINALLY CJDAGOAT HAS DROPPED!!!!
The apex edit was amazing 😂❤
After you do ryuga you should do marik from yu gi oh like this if you guys agree
Danggg bro we need this next week
Love it how a bunch of people are talking about the metal series more and more cause it was awesome watching that before school every day. I believe i still got my earth eagle somewhere.
1:03 u forgot alucard where did he go?
CJ we are long overdue for a GUTS vid. The leader of black air force energy.
New CJ just dropped get the pack weed
ryuga is the plot armor
2:04 wait nah now i'm actually lost 💀🙏
Sonic riders zero gravity music let's go
YEEEESSSSSSSSSS
beyblade man my goated childhood tv show
What’s craziest that he still has a better schedule than CoryxKenshin
LDrago, the master of delivering L's
HE DID ITTT I KNEW HE WOULD MAKE A VID ON BEYBLADE LETS GOOOO
You need to finish attack on titan. Eren isn’t done yet.
AYYYYEE CJ!!🔥🔥❤🔥❤✊🏽✊🏽
While you doing throwbacks I nominate Marik from YugiOh
When people think Yugioh is ridiculous with the world almost ending because of a children’s card game, here comes beyblade telling ya to hold their beer XD
Please tell me you're going to do Metal Masters as exhibit B cuz that's my favorite version of ryuga it felt like he was going for a Redemption Arc
I mean the fact is ryuga really was One of the greatest antagonists they had in this series of bayblade And the only time we actually seen him truly give up. Wasn't even a give up. He gave his power and passed it on. No one else truly stood a chance against him. And that power of friendship bullcrap in the plot was the only thing that saved The main character's butt
This edition of Beyblade was my shit as a kid! However, I was one of the few people representing Team Gingka/Pegasus (still do to this day). However, looking back on this, it blows my mind how much of a savage Ryuga was.
I can't wait for Zaraki Kenpachi's trial. After the TBYW is finished of course
Do Griffith
Man beyblade was lit back then🤣
Yo I can’t wait till your Eminence in Shadow video
guys i think beyblade is that serious
Beyblade was on some shi tsubasa had schizophrenia
Should do brooklyn from of beybalde
Ah yes finally the dragon emperor gets his trial
Cj really started this trend of people talking about anime like this bro really a pioneer💯
It’s crazy how he only lost twice the for all 3 of the beyblade shows 98% win rate😂
Please 🙏 do a video on inazuma 11
Happy Birthday to the Legend Cj Dachamp
Lets not forget where the beyblade gods had to left the betblade omniverses to make beyblade burst
Hikaru got bodied so badly because she was using a light wheel, so her bey was all plastic, if the bey was a lighter in the metal wheel area it was plastic, that’s why a lot of basic characters got bodied so badly, they fight evil meteor pieces with full plastic combos 😭
My guy got 161 Violations and was a meanace to society and he only took one loss. Plot armor be coming in clutch
Seriously? You dont give a guy a nuke and say hes the best at fighting. This guy is nothing without his special top.
This show aired every day at 6-7:30 am before school and was the only reason I as a 7 year old got up early
I liked this video so we better see pt 2 man LMFAO because Ryuga was the G.O.A.T hands down I was mad when I saw him get beat by nemesis
"MY PARLAYYYYY!!!" LMAO
Bro, I thought my men never watched bayblade, but it turns out he did, and he talks about the best character in the show 😂
Need a video on masquerade and hydranoid or spectra and Helios 🫡
Thanks cj
kids show don't hit like they use to. Low to no death, dark and mature theme practically nonexistent, and short run times.
What’s beyblade even about bruh 💀💀💀😭😭😭
The Goat
This is how I always thought beybalde as a kid looked liked, good times😊
gyatt
Put Dante from the Dante's inferno anime, based of the ea game, into the hall of menaces cj. All the exhibits required. 1. His wife made a bet with Satan that her husband would remain pure, and he committed all seven deadly sins. 2. Slaying prisoners of war cause he didn't want to watch over them then let his brother in law take the fall. 3. Boning an assassins wife. 4. Satan taking his wife and lying to his wife saying, nah man that aint me. 5. Fighting his way through hell to get his wife back. 6. Sending his wife to heaven and though he is deserving of hell, beat the shit out of Satan to beat his way into heaven.
Imagine wanting a run back so bad that you trained your op, so we wouldn’t get folded by a weaker version of himself.
Bro what hapend to normal beyblades
I NEED THAT DOFLAMINGO VIDEO ASAP!!!!
Cj Could u put bullet from one piece on the round table
We need the next part for Ryuga
Do a video on sung jin woo
YOOOO HES GOT BAYBLADE ON NOW LETS GO
Finally CJ dropped 😭😭
Mans was committing such atrocities that he literally had me forget that we were still in exhibit A
The I Got Love instrumental IS CRAZY WORK 😂😂😂
I'm so happy you did this
Didn't they start sprinting around a city mid battle in season 2
Nigga lost once then never lost again till the final episode of the last season lmao he really took that 1 L to heart 😭
My boy you gotta watch Ninja Kamui next it's on some next level shit
When we gonna get a KENPACHI trial?!?!?
Just as I'm getting into Beyblade. CJ is on straight TIMING!
Total G.O.A.T. masterpiece 🤘💀🔥
Bro I was a HUGE Ryuga fan in middle school
beyblaadee buuuuuuurst
Mosses got the largest K/D Ratio 💀💀💀
Xenoverse 2 music in the background
So given this new ranking system, where would Vegeta rank if he's still on the roundtable?
Can anyone tell me what the music from 9:54 is from?
Why the Beyblade push recently? Not mad just wondering
Finally My boy, The dragon emperor, is getting the recognition he deserves
Exhibit B is where ryuga is the goat, meteo l drago be cooking
He didn't lose to gingka he lose to plot
Small lebroskiis feature was bout the most unexpected shi in this vid
WE NEED PT 2
CJ please do a video on blue lock i beg PLEASE
He had the dawh in him
This is only season 1
This show brings back memories 😂😂😂
Need the link to that beat at 9:55
That man is like luishirosagi ON F*CKING STEROIDS
❤😂❤
❤😂❤
😂
Bro, I haven’t even started watching yet. Beyblade’s Metal Fight series was a big part of my childhood, Ryuga was my favorite. This shit gon be good.
First trial of the year put this man behind Bars forever it is that deep lmao  OK edit yea 👌 this was type outrageous for beyblades you cooked
RIPPING OFF A MANS BANDANA AND CLEANING YOUR BEYBLADE WITH IT IS FUCKING INSANE LMFAOOO
Ryuga is kaiba is kaiba was actually like that
*L-DRAGO TAKING OVER WAS CRAZY*
Also in the show there was a scene where he beat 3 random books, but he didn't use the rip cord or any other device. he just lazily spun it with his bare hands and ended up still kicking their asses from it stealing the momentum from their bayblades. Funnily enough that move works with the IRL toy version of ElDrago, since .
The worst part is that this only the first season of the anime 💀
Bro I watched some of this and do NOT remember bro being LIKE THAT.
Back when beyblade first released why it ain’t have this many videos on it but now it got lots of em
BRO I HAD TO CLICK ON THIS VID WHEN I SAW IT WAS BEYBLADE
All the beyblade hype got real as soon as CJ decided to drop a video
Out of all the beyblade sessions, metal one was one of the craziest  one's
Next week
Nah bro is an absolute demon in mortal form up there with Yujiro Hanma in this bish
DAMNNN i didnt know beyblade active like that
YOU MADE ME A FICKING ATAR I WAS SCREAMING FOR THAI SHIT GIVE ME MORE THIS MAN GOAT TO BOTXHINGHELL AND HEAVNE HE OBSESED WITH DEATH GIVE ME MORE BITCH MORE MORE MORE

CJ hopped on the beyblade train and I'm all for it lol idk why the fuck beyblade is going crazy for like the last 2 weeks but I'm here for it
I don't comment often on anything but I am so glad someone gave this man the respect he deserves.
Bro made a video on beyblade hes offically the goat
ronaldo better than messi
One of the few people I be happy as hell when they upload lmao on lunch too 😂🙏🏾
FINALLY A BEYBLADE VIDEO
beyblade MIGHT be this serious
Premium trash is WILD 😂
BOUT TIME YOU TOUCHED BEYBLADE HOMES. THIS SHIT WAS FR DEADLY  Imagine just tryna blade with your homies and some TEENAGER (yes, he is a teen) pulls up and fucks you up
THE KING RETURNS WITH A BANGER
Boondocks what did you say nigga!!! Always gets me 😅
I felt the same way when I watched DIO lose.
i was praying he would do Ryuga
Kahoot Music is crazy
Ryuga was him!
I’m so happy that you made a video for the beyblade series.
This ho should have been one vid. Love the content. Keep up the good work.
Doji came back as a ghost, that MF actually died.
Bro got his own trial?
Next video suggestion: The most disrespectful moments in anime history 8
Goddamn, Slade above Roberta scares the sh*t out of me. And yet I don’t see it as impossible.😳🤔
Can you do a vid on acnologia please
Ryuga, the only character I'd put over Kai and Tyson as my favourite beyblade character from how much of a savage he is.
Memories of Saturday morning are coming
Love the update im not gonna hold you
Man Ryuga is up there with Shao Khan, Frieza, and Yujiro. He's practically a force of nature.
2:04 goes hard asf
After watching this I wonder what Yu-Gi-Oh is even about.
Damian from metal masters needs a disrespectful moments video
Oh snap. He’s covering Beyblade.
HELL YEAH THE DRAGON EMPEROR IS HERE!  Also imagine. Ryuga has had only one L across three series (against Diablo Nemesis) and he literally *died* as a result. Every other match was a W or never finished.
Been waiting ages for the goat to get a trial hell yeah
ITS ABOUT TIME CJ
Ryuga.... I haven't heard that name in years literally a decade
I have a idea for THE MOST DISRESPECTFUL MOMENTS IN ANIME HISTORY you could talk about the time where Ash swept a man's team with his Krabby that he never used in battle before
Daaaamn, i don't remember beyblade being this serious
Things just keep getting better and better. Keep on going CJ you cooking
Beyblade was an insane and nonsensical show. But that’s what it so memorable and hilarious.
The GOAT has blessed us wit a BEYBLADE VID 😭😭😭🐐🐐🐐‼️
the best character in beyblade
Sukuna only being S++ is both an insult and an understatement to much shit he has done He f**ked half of Shibuya like it was nothing goddamnit💀💀
FINALLY, I’VE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS
People ask why Ryuga is the goat ...first off he is the Dragon Black Air Force Energy emperor so respect and 2 he so fucking cool!
I guess the writers said fuck them kids
Bro must be a sonic fan fr I’ve heard Sonic unleashed and Sonic riders songs in this
Thank you CJDC for this throwback. I got into Beyblade once as a child in pre-K and got back into it with Metal Storm, and Metal Fury and the sequel series I forgot the name of
LETSSS GOOOOO idk if you saw my comment about wanting ryuga IM STILL HAPPY YOU DID IT
Funny thing is ryuga only lost twice once to the main character, and the second to a god
When’s part 2 and 3?
Ah, i see you are a man of culture as well
I jus wanna say that Ian think u was ever gone think about this one ☝️
Next week???? You already at 30,000 likes in less than 3 hours you should go ahead and drop it NOW!!!!
FINALLY because lets really talk about it. Why was my nigga Ryuga so fucking Cold🧊💯
No way CJ did the goat
When did beyblade become so un serious like burst ruined everything (not bad tho)
YES MFS BEYBLADE IS THIS SERIOUS MFS DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO CUT A MFS BY LAUCHING A BEYBLADE AT A MFS FACE
The day he does Griffith from BEserk is the day I die happy.
Ryuga is the goat of goats
MORE MORE MROEE IQ WANT MORRRRRRRRRRRRRE
No this is crazy i swear i think im the main character some times because the second i go on Crunchyroll watching beyblade burst metal fusion i go to YouTube i see it also i finish season 1 4.4 hours baby!!
More. More more more
MORE
I deadass been waiting for this for months
Imagine Armageddon happening once every few weeks... because of a damn spinning top💀 That's basically how the verse is It's even worse than more than half of every anime I've seen
I was wondering how long it was gonna be till you got to this legend
This verse is worse than anything I've seen Because a spinning top literally opened the gates of hell itself in it(ps that is not a hyperbole. That is literally what happened💀)
requesting sun jin woo from solo leveling
I have never watched Beyblade and I can tell you that the violation I have seen from Ryuga is nearly Mahito level.
I'm telling y'all ryuga made the hollow purple. Gojo and so many characters was ripping off ryuga. We need that next part ASAP!
The goat vs team USA gotta be next that man humbled them
Damn...I forgot how hard Beyblade went.
unc
I only have 3 Beys, and the only one I have that I know the name of is Pirate Orochi.
Yeah y'all heard right non-fans This *ENTIRE* was just exhibit A
We need part 2 immediately god damn
Cj your editing skills are top tier
Accelerator is like the OG GOJO
I forgot about the Moses scene😂
Cj I liked so yu bets drop
My guy check out accelerator from A Certain Magical Index
There is no beating plot
bro this is heat😭😭😭
Ppl be saying I would want to be in beyblade meanwhile u got ryuga destroying cities out here
Man if this man uploaded more often he would over take the anime voice over/ abridge genre by storm
Pls do more of the demons of beyblade
Everyone loses there streak at some point(Undertaker)
This is sooo fireeeeeee😅😅😂
Bro
About time CJ showed us Ryuga, lets go
Ooooooh yuuuh thank you CJ!
It's so stupid I gotta watch it
Gotta do one for Shu or Lui next
On some real shit I was thinking someone would do this type of video but did not except you to do this, you made my day CJ
CJ Dachamp is goated asf. The voice overs, the  WWE refernces, the editing, the use of I got love's instrumental,  its all peak.
The moral of the story, Yeah...the Beyblade shows was that SERIOUS
He also has the *SICKEST* fucking name in the whole franchise. 🔥
You know, I'm surprised that this anime has his regained its recognition one more time  after literally 8 years, no one has talked about Bayblade in years nobody, until some random guy came talking about how Ryuga was a threat to society.   I still remember my first bay in 2013 it was "poison serpent"   And what about you, what was your first Bayblades before?
17:42 Giving Ryuga the Shadow game Results music… WAY TOO FITTING, and damn, here’s to hoping that SEGA don’t sue!
This drop better be legendary as your ass took two months from your last drop. That shit is unacceptable and don’t let that dingy as shit happen again. As dont make me slide for the comments
Let’s gooo
Bruh I been waiting a min for a video 😂
2:04 🤣🤣
I love this
We all know if this weren’t a kids show, Hikaru, Tsubasa, and Kyoya would be dead 💀
And lets not forget, this is jut FUSION.  Ryuga is just as much of a monster in Masters and Fury too.
You should do  Marik from yugioh
Finally. Ryuga is finally getting the respect he deserves
Was not expecting beyblade but hey, we here
You should of put an x in front of Stalin as well as he committed his own genocide which killed 9 million people but good video
Oh HELL YEAH MORE NEXT WEEK!!🤩
Part 2 os when Ryuga shows Hes really HIM. Didnt lose a SINGLE time
BETTER THEN MESSI
I'm shaking and crying right now cj my homeboi I always been ryuga fanboy when I was 12 years back in the day and now seeing a trial about him warm my heart.
In the BEYBLADE verse Moses really had a  BEYBLADE
Well dang this is actually happening
Niggas in beyblade were doing to much 💀💀💀
Can anyone identify the track that starts at 11:38? Because I tried to find it after it appeared in The Asylum #1 but have had no success.
I genuinely consider Beyblade my first anime. It’s cool to see that it still holds up and has hype.
Beyblade WAS that serious
Bro beyblade couldn’t have been this serious 😂
New to this channel. This video got you a sun and a like. Love the content and you are hilarious. Would love to se part 2 and part 3 cause I’ve watched it all haha
Ain’t no way CJ made a vid about beyblade. I mean I ain’t complaining
U TELLING ME THERES A PART 2?!?!?? Drop it
I'm glad to see hit almost at 2 mil bruh was gonna be heated otherwise.
Pls put aizen on the round table this year when Bleach part 2 comes out 🙏
Do Yami from Yu-Gi-Oh! Season 0
I do NOT remember Beyblade being this dramatic!! What a Friday night treat!! 😂😂
Season 1 Ryuga was a meance...I can't wait to see everything that'll be said in season 2 and 3. Tho I think those can fit in one video since he has less screen time in those seasons
Ryuga only lost to the power of friendship and a literal God of Destruction. Ryuga is really HIM
Finally
Bro trust me a lot of people have been glazing ryuga on youtube recently
Do Lui next
AYE CJ LEMME JUS LET U KNO NOW MY NIGGA RYUGA DIDNT DIE INA MANGA ONLY IN THE ANIME BCUZ THEY WAS PLANNIN ON BRINGIN HIM BACK BUT THE SHOW NEVER AIRED🙌🏾
CJ DACHAMP + BEYBLADE YEEEEEEEEEEES
How did this man not mention how he did Yuu. His biggest fan
Rhubarb is not playing with his food
I think I need to say this because of this vid but I think most of us can agree that we need a trial on masquerade from Bakugan battle brawlers cuz he was a problem either him or spectra from new vestroia.
Bro outta all the shows u could have pulled u pulled this shit nah 😂✌🏾
Loving the sonic riders zero gravity music in the background
“NAH NIGGA, I AINT DONE YET. LET IT RIP!” Has no business going that hard with those sound effects
You know I get that Beyblade, was ridiculous with Tyson and the OG crew back then, but wtf happened between then and now is astonishing
Amen to cj for talking about the goat of beyblade but you forgot when he ran the fade of the police
i really thought he only neededA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Man keeps shooting the final flash on them
Correction: the violation with Hikaru was the worst... that season. Yeah, as one would expect, Ryuga's reign of terror didn't stop at season 1, The one with Jack in the next season was probably worse  Basically, Jack spent a good time talking Ryuga but running away from the challenge cause he didn't have a Bey yet. So when Ryuga finds out Jack has a Bey and is about to fight Gingka, he pulls up to the stadium BY RIDING ON A F'ING METEOR with the sole purpose to not only fight this trash talker, but to publicly embarrassed him on global tv.   And um... boy, he accomplished that.  He essentially gives Jack 5 mins to try and knock L-Drago out like he claimed, and when he failed Ryuga did the bey battle equivalent of backhanding Jack so hard that he buried him in the very grave that Jack had been making to bury Ryuga in.  And then after that, he then one shotted an entire flying city out of the sky, but that's a whole mess in of itself
9:20 NAHHH WHY IS BRO SITTING THERE LIKE HE JUST GOT HIS HEART BROKEN BY A GIRL
The champ is back
Bet
Another day Another W video by cj
I didn't expect a video of my childhood classics so soon. H O L Y !
yknow what's crazy, this man is voiced by the one and only kenjiro tsuda thats right a 13 year old had the voice of (currently 52) 38 year old man and the voice still be hot
ive wachted these since 2020 for some reason i just dont know xd
Imagine if the president of black Air Force energy is cooler I feel like In some videos it’s hinted I would love to see it
Ryuga should have lost to Gingka when Gingka realized that he need to be in a calm state and accept all things instead of this friendship bullshit that writers always try to do
Black airforce activity detected bayblade of Black airforce
"Like the video I'll drop this hoe next week" gotta be the biggest lie of 2024😂😂😂
Cid Kagenou needs to join the round table
Better put Metal fury in exhibit B
Crazy I was just rewatching beyblade this werk
We already new a ryuga video was coming when beyblade started trending again!
Yall forgetting fury?
Blackbeard better get a trial because he would fit at the round table
I get through this masterpiece of a video without my head exploding from how GOATed Ryuga is. Then I find out This is only Exhibit A! CJ'S IN THE BACK CHARGING UP ANOTHER ONE!
We ripping beys this this place 🔥🔥
Beyblade video? LETS GOO
Been an month
FINNALLY HE DOING SOMEONE FROM BEYBLADE YESSIR
W
Lets not forget this dude ryuga is supposed to be 12-16 years old
I'm surprised DJ Noodle Barnacle didn't make an appearance 😂😂
Ryuga is the goat of Beyblade Metal Saga. Whether he was a villain or a neutral party. My guy was able to master a Forbidden Bey’s Dark Power, evolve it twice, and make one of the coolest Ultimate Moves of all time. *DRAGON EMPEROR LIFE DESTRUCTOR!!!*
Beyblade metal was literally godlike ryuga was a demon
Ryuga Is Him Like That 🔥🔥🔥
I literally searched you last night 😂 I watched your old videos to fall asleep to cause it's entertaining 😁
Wait we’re not done?! This was exhibit a???!!!
So what else are you going to do the hazbin ?
THE INSANE THING IS I WAS WATCHING THIS MAN FOLD EVERYONE LIKE A MONTH AGO.
Deadass started rewatching this series last month. Get outta my head
I love the Ryuga memes. This man is constantly tweaking, whooping ass and I’ve NEVER seen him lose unless it’s due to plot. They legit made him so strong that plot had to get in his way.
How is Cell not judged into the round table yet. He literally commits mass homocide in his first few minutes of traveling to the past, kills future trunks, and even kill an innocent man in front of piccolo
Another video of asking to male a guts video
I was just watching a few videos on how busted this kid is! 😮
YESSSS RYUGA Was the freaking dog in beyblade loved him🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉
YEEEESSS!!! FINALLY THE RYUGA VIDEO! THANK YOU CJ I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THE DAY! 🥲 And it's a multi part. Oh nah we EATIN today!
first time watching one of your videos where i dont know the anime :O
It was at the end of the vid when I realized this was just Exhibit A
BEYBLADE IS SO BACK RAHHHHHH
I'm going to suggest a round table member.  Enter *Kuroki "Motherfucking" Gensai* 1. Has zero introduction or even buildup, has a million jobber flags 2. Proceeds to not only beat the MC's rival/friend, but humiliates his ass and calls him a wimp 3. Defeats the MC's nemesis who's intrinsic to the story and nearly kills him 4. Sasuke-looking guy who's motivated by revenge for his father against Kuroki? Called a scrub, gets ribs caved in 5. Fights the reigning undefeated champion, STILL wins despite tough-ass fight 6. Washes the protagonist even with the power of friendship 7. Still too green according to himself 8. Notably, all of his foes got a powerup mid-fight and still caught the fade. Motherfucker is just different
Do valt, shu, or Phi from beyblade burst next
Hey CJ WILL YOU PLEASE WATCH TOKYO REVENGERS SEASON 3 AND DO BLACK AIRFORCE ENERGY
I’m not going to lie was watching this series and got to the point of him beating Jack and was like Dam cj should do this dude and an hour later here’s Ryuga!
God is great. CJ is great. RYUGA IS THE GOAT. I fanboyed so hard here
We need a Beyblade abridged series
I am still waiting for do flamingos
Yesss, I’ve been waiting for this vid 🔥🔥
16:16 - like dude said , L drago feeds on negative energy, so Pegasus feeeds on positive energy, so honestly plot had nun to do with it 😂& to ur other point L- drago took over nd subbed in so why can’t the souls of his friends
YES!!!!
Yay
Juggling his shit 💀💀💀
I kinda wanna see doflamingo next ngl
I think he can beat goku (don't tell the cartel please)
Beyblade as a gun is so crazy lmao
I just clicked on the video and I see some dude yelling DRAGON OF THE DARKNESS FLAME
BY THE WAY THIS IS JUST HIM IN SEASON ONE THERE ARE 2 OTHER SEASONS!
another banger
I would be so tight if I did all of that just for him to do it again
Post more videos and not once a month😊 I love you videos
Did you all know the original bay blade is based off its manga, yes there was a manga before the anime
I was waiting for someone to make a video on this dude.
I'm waiting for season 3 of JJK so you can add 3 more pluses on sukuna's ratings.
can someone please tell me what bayblade is even about 😭
Please do a part two and three on this guy. He deserves that if you can of course no need to rush
Holy Shasta! Ryugas actually getting interviewed for the black Air Force energy! Let’s goooooo!
Ryuga got that Yugi drip
Do more of these bayblade videos
Love your content CJ.
Ryuga only lost to power of friendship bs and to a primordial god. He put in more work than all of the legendary bladers combined. Truly worthy of the title "He's HIM".
about time
Beyblade was a different breed of chaos💀
YOU KNOW ITS A GOOD DAY WHEN DJ DACHMP UPLOADS🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊
I thought I heard Philly in one of these scenes, bro or am I tripping?
The metal series is making a major comback. Love your vids bro. Let this man cook!!!🔥
YOU COOKED🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hey cj you may want to look at this anime called Kingdom of ruins I don't know if it is long enough to be a part of the round table but most disrespectful moments fit just fine
This is just Part 1? Holy shit, Ryuga is built different
Yo CJ, when you going to do a video about Garou from one punch man? In season 2 this dude made not only 1 but 2 what i like to call *"A reverse jumping"* and in the manga this dude did some universal shit in terms of disrespect.
now THIS is quality cotnent
If you know you know this is childhood
AINT NO WAY YOU TELLING ME SAKUNA IS RANKED LOWER THAN YUJIRO AND MADARA (Majin buu i understand)
Ryuga beat Kyoya so badly he turned into a knockoff Vegeta
Bro that like to view ratio is crazy rn keep it up. 74k views 24k likes.
Thank u cj thank u for listening to me bro u the goat
As someone who grew up watching Beyblade and collected several of them during my childhood, everytime Ryuga popped on the scream was the biggedt indicator that things were about to get intense and man did this dude deliver. Knowing what happens after the first season has me very excited for part 2.
only here would you find a hype man that can make beyblade fights sound as lit as a dragon ball fight.
The Sukuna before Sukuna.
Hail to the Goat, the Dragon Emperor Himself is joining the round table. Im ngl this nigga was a menace as a kid and i loved him.  The way this man violated everyone and only lost twice in the entire series was just brutal. Heck i even love how he basically tells Ginka by the second season when he asks this man if hes using the dark power, man literally said bitch this is my power i conquered L-Drago and made him my bitch meanwhile your yee-yee protag ass can't even control the new Pegasus dog literally dumpsterd Ginka like Pikachu from pokemon got cleaned up by a level 5 Snivy
Had my boy Gingka quaking
Im so happy that even cj recognized this mans pure black air force energy
Always a fantastic day when the GOAT uploads a new one🎉
Can we have a part 2? The other season really showcase just how insane this man was
If you’re looking for perspective members of the black Air Force activity round table, may I put in my vote for maomao from the apothecary diaries
Ok but no joke, the chicks in this series lit a fire in me when I was little.
9:43 - hikaru was bae fr ❤i was damn why he do her like that
"the power of friendship" NAH 🤣🤣🤣
W video, my good man. Put some respect on the Metal Generation and the homies Kyoya, Kenta, and the OG, Ryuga.
Kai and Tyson must be rolling in their graves right now 😂
bruh thats just season 1
Cj talking bout me is crazy i will body more people hahahahahahahhaa
NO FUCKEN WAY I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU DID THIS BEYBLADE IS LITERALLY MY FUCKEN THING(and nah for real thank you bruh this just made my day)
Y7W3R
At least the 'Power of Friendship' had a legitimate reason to help in this. As others have noted, LDrago fed on Negative emotions, so positive ones would basically be poison to him. Hence, the bs plot armor trope of the 'Power of Friendship', but even with that, LDrago lived while Pegasus turned to dust. So technically, it's a draw if you look at it like this. LDrago may have stopped spinning, but Pegasus was dust in the shape of a spinning top at the end.
man this was bound to happen
Ryuga is like a villain from a whole ass shonen that wound up in a beyblade series, and was just fucking with them for shits and giggles
Aw yeah, new video. Been waiting for it CJ. Used to pray for times like these Lol 😂🤲🏿
This was all the first season mind you 🔥🔥🔥
Dude....Beyblade was my first anime before I even knew what anime was. This shit was my childhood. Ryuga was MY childhood bad guy. Before I knew Vegeta, I had Ryuga. CJ, you was already a GOAT when it came to anime on YouTube, now you are UNDISPUTED. THE #1.
Dragon, emperor, supreme goat!!
if you know abt LDrago YOU GOTTA KNW ABT DRAIN fAfNIR THAT Mf fREE WAS A MEANACE TOO
Was that sonic riders music in the beginning or am I tripping
Hopefully he gets to bakugan so we can see a video on masquerade, spectra, or barodias
I would actually watch this show with you as the va
YESSSS FINALLY MY GOAT RYUGAAAAAAAAAAA
“Oh you thought he was done? No no no” that caught me off guard lmao
😂😂😂 this is hilarious  Beyblade villains need to be studied
Can you do a Kiryu Kazuma Video. my goat needs to be at that Damm table.
That wasn't no galick gun bro hit him with a FINAL FLASH
YO MY BOY RYUGA. I never thought I'd see the day but metal fusion/masters had the black force energy on lock
Does the kill counter count if the person who died comes back to life? Because if so, you may want to add three points, because according to the Japanese dub, Ryuga actually killed Kyoya, Tsubasa, and Hikaru albeit be at the temporarily.
Put me in the round table
Let's go CJ made a ryuga vid W character
Ooooh the next 2 weeks gon' be GOOD
Was Beyblade really that serious?💀
beyblade metal series was a wild but very enjoyable and confusing ride
w vid
true
😂 I never thought in my life I should see CJ talking about my favorite character
Ryuga really harnessed his inner Yujiro Hanma 😂
cj you absolute goat these bois need to know who made hallow purple they need to know the original og of badasseray my nigga big dog ryuga ay we need a part 2 of my goat i take back my statement my goat ryuga will always be big dog
What’s even more crazy in the manga continuity storm Pegasus evolved into galaxy Pegasus during that battle so yeah plot armor is a bitch.
Ryuga was out here fighting literal Demons
I KNEW THIS WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN YESSIR DRAGON EMPEROR
He popped off after season 1. First season he was crazy but the next two he was controlled black Air Force activity
Great, now we have to wait for ryuga's trials in metal masters and fury
Idk if i would have slade above Roberta though that's just me
He really called out me team 😢 28-3
L drago would give you the l infinitity kill then he Gon laugh at your ass
23k likes in 2 hours. ye he deff dropin it next week
Goats back
The dragon emperor has reached Cj 🐉 🔥
you know its been so long that I forgot that even bay blade was full of ridiculous feats that would make most shonen proud.
Got to say I am loving the Beyblade trend I remember watching Beyblade ,Bakugan and Yo Gi H as a child all three  of them shows where goated
Ryuga in his first exhibit was such a menace literal PLOT ARMOR was the only thing stopping him, the fact that 3 of his victims had to pull in SPIRIT up to stop this shit says A LOT on how much of a dog as nigga he truly was  Long Live the GOAT RYUGA
Nice to see that my favorite show as a kid is getting some respect. Can't wait to see part 2!
This anime was super elite back then
Bro did the beyblade equivalent of doing a madara
You know that once CJdachamp said he is 5'8 some girls said "eewww!" And clicked off the vid💀😭
6:20 such a raw ass line
6:22 Love this man’s voice acting 🔥🔥
Bruh. This man was such a goat. Even the writers were calling Bs
BRO please mention him using his hand to launch L drago 😂
Bro was 152/1
Still love the content but come on man where is the doflamingo video
Cj Dachamp you right about the roman empire made beyblade
Aye! Shoutout to everyone who woke up at 6:00am every Saturday morning to watch. Good times.😊
What’s the like goal tho
goood god this man
so lit
Bro there’s no way CJ did it.  He did it. Bro, thank you for covering Ryuga the goat! The dragon emperor!!!! BeyBlade Metal series was my peak childhood🙏🙏
Bro I was not expecting my childhood and hobby to ever make an entrance here.
DID YOU REALLY JUST USE THE SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG END SCREEN?! CJ I LOVE YOU!
OH YEAHHHHH
Hands down best video of 2024 🔥🔥🔥
Random af but I am immensely happy that you chose to make this video.
The best part about him is immediately after his loss, in about a week immediately conquers the dark power entirely (something one of the main characters could only handle a fraction of) evolves Lightning L Drago into meteor L Drago, and then Ryuga is the strongest until the literal final boss dark god that literally had to use his power to be born. Literally every time he meets with Gingka afterwards he's left profoundly disappointed by him, always expecting something more only to then go "really you're the guy to get the win off of me you don't even understand how your own bey works!!!"
Yo which anime is this fr fr
This has to be the hardest I've ever laughed on a video that had to do with "BeyBlade." Looking forward to part 2.
Dragon emperor supreme flight!!! 😂wen I was I jit ryuga was the realest nigga you should do metal masters with meteor l drago he was really a menace
Ryuga: MENACE OF Beyblade
THANK THE HEAVENS HE HAS POSTED🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
YRS! You have no idea how much I’ve wanted this.  Also, the battle of the dogs, 100% best episode in the entire season dead ass
please do an eminence in shadow please big daddy cj
I was NOT expecting Ryuga to drop!
THE GOAT IS BACK!! 2 MINUTES INTO THIS VIDEO AND I HAD TO LEAVE TO GO GET SOME FOOD AND ENJOY THIS ONE
Kyoya was the og bakugo no contest🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣 Also this video reactivated like 12 core memories
He got the reporters from Baki
W first one of the first here
Finally he did it lol can’t wait for part 2 fun fact I’ve seen thing my child hood year and I’m 22 bout to be 23
oh goodness
We got Ryuga for BFA video, I think its plausible CJ do Douji for Asylum next that man's insanity and dick riding is on the next level
9:40 nah worst violation is ep 44 of metal fusion dat viper nlgga had my boy kenta in tears BEGGING like it deadass felt like child abuse inna kids show😂😂
Tbh I never thought ill hear beys ever again and funniest thing about I still got mine
Aye aye ayo CJ! Where da Shredder trial at cuh?
Bro and it's crazy because he didn't even touch on how he literally gave this man tsubasa schizophrenia. Or how he basically used conqueror's haki on a tiger. In the manga Ldrago had so many forms you would have thought it was part super Saiyan. In the manga Pegasus was destroyed 4 times and 2 of those times were by ryuga. Like the list goes on and on
This dude is somehow more threatening than Sukuna and Yujiro while being in a kid's show.
Not a chance none of those audience members ain't die
Ryuga truly was the OF menace to society
I was watching shows for a long time, a teen at that point but the show still managed to make me feel dred. Rayuga was terrifying.
Realizing the whole video is just exhibit 1 💀 yeah bro touching S+ minimum
Honey wake up cj posted
What anime is this
I wanna see Iris's Dragonite in the next Most Disrespectful Moments in Anime
If you're a supreme menace, expect to get robbed by plot sooner or later
nah we jus witnessed one of the greatest robberies known to man, plot armour robbery, its too common Geto should not have lost to yuta☠
so we’re doing Beyblade next week?   I challenge CJDaChamp to review Masquerade from Bakugan in March.
Babe wake up. New round table video is up
When Guts
CJ DO INAZUMA ELEVEN NEXT  AXEL BLAZE ❤❤
HE DID IT ❤❤❤
I like how we going into Beyblade now. It's been years since I watched metal fusion. This is amazing.
Bro, beublade metal was on another level, niggas were destroying mountains with bayblades wtf
Imagine just living you just got a nice house then a beyblade comes crashing through destroying your property taking your women and ya
Man rn as the video got 21k likes that 1/3 of the views so when dat part 2 at ?  Edit: 120k views and 33k likes still a W that's a rough 1/4 views to likes ratio still a W though part 2 ⏲️
I haven’t laughed this much is so damn long
Geeeeeeeeeeez another goat joins the table
I'm so happy you made this. Beyblade Metal is my childhood and Ryuga was a goat for sure.
Reminds me of Seto Kaiba
I've seen a lot of videos about this new beyblade lately
Streets needed this one🤌🏽😭
2:42 Goat noise 🐐😂😂 10:31 Garlick Kamehameha 😂
this show is my child hood
The God of Rizz is here to shower us in content! Also yes I know I’m late to the upload but I had work.
I just got back into beyblade and now this comes out thank you CJ. Also this is just metal fusion bro in metal masters was disrespectful and in fury confirmed why he was the GOAT Edit: Gingka defence pegasus does get its power from positive emotions basically being a bey that naturally has the power of friendship
Lmao glaze me is crazy i used to be such a big follower idk what happened 😂😂😂
Bruh really just said no to the extra 500k views by changing that Taylor Swift Thumbnail huh?. 💀
MY CHILDHOOD
This is honestly one of the first times I ever hated the Power of Friendship trope.
Yo what? I just barely saw a video about how cracked this series is and now CJ's doing a Roundtable on it? *The Algorithm Is getting Stronger.*
YESS!!! FINALLY A VID ABOUT THE DRAGON EMPEROR FROM CJ!!🐉👑🤴
So since CJ is talking about beyblade. we gonna mention pre-chozetsu Lui?
Saw it coming.
Well shit I haven’t watched Beyblade since I was in Elementary. After this I might give it a shot cuz damn didn’t think it was THIS intense
Please make a video about future diary
Thx cj
HE HIT THAT MF WIT A FINAL FLASH
Finally
Thx for reading my comment on this cuz dis guy is a menace non gon la
Love the scale. We need a kenpachi trial.
He ripped the shit out of that blade blade to make a whole dragon come out 🔥🔥🔥on that demon time😈
ngl the plot messed my boy ryuga up twice in the final season
Ryuga is da greatest of all time
Yo thx bro
He should review the eminence in Shadow  or the daily life of highschool God or something like that
OH WE GOT A BANGER RIGHT HERE YESSIRRR
yooo we need a part 2 but metal masters
For someone who remembers the Beyblade Metal Series, this is a win-win video right here!  Also yesterday was my birthday! 🎉🎁🎂🎊🎈!
Never thought my childhood TV show would have shown up in this channel
God! These memories 😀
Man my one friend talks shit about this series even though he's never seen it
Man, Ryuga is the goat yeah, but why did he have to do my girl like that? That was unnecessary.
You now its fr when he adds low tier god's voice onto a character 5:02
Ryuga was a different breed for this series
WHEN WILL WE HAVE DOFFY
Bro has a higher win count than Sukuna!
The fact that this isn’t even Metal Fury is CRAZY!! Ryuga still undefeated until the end where he goes out like a fuckin dawg
When are we gonna get some female representation on the Black Air Force round table?
Yo CJ, can you do Zoom from the flash CW next even though it's not a anime?
Once again, I request Blood Stalk from _Kamen Rider Build_ to be added to the Round Table.
Nominating Mikazuki from Gundam Iron blood orphans
U should do ryo from ippo
Hyped for part 2 and 3 CJ it's gonna be crazy
am i the only one that forgot this was only exhibit A
DANG BRO, I BEEN seeing Beyblade getting some clout slowly throughout the community....!
“My parley” 😂😂😂😂
This reawakened a part of my childhood that I remember so fondly of. Thank you CJ for allowing me to remember this cool part of my life.
Dabo finally made it into one of these vids 😆bro has the craziest facial expressions 💀
W VIDEO!!!!! Ryuga is a menance to society😂. After the part 2 you got do a video on another menace...Zaraki Kenpachi. He has been sitting at the round table since the beginning.
U listened to me😂
Bro wanted all The smoke
When bro said exhibit A was concluded my heart dropped
YOOO this is fire
Finally my boi Ryuga is in the black force round table
Bro, this Shit hits different when you grow up and know Ryuga was THE menace
Could someone tell me WHAT THIS SHOW IS ABOUT???
Hot Take but i think there should be a trial for the Generation of Miracles but if i could pick a single member it would be Akashi
Beyblade cant be this serious
Exhibit B boutta be even better. Ryuga launching his bey with his hand against those NPCs in the desert was cold af.
Beyblade was in fact that serious
10:02 Bro sound like he got personal beef or sm with her 🤡🤣
Can you do a video from Ren from Cardfight Vanguard. Man was an absolute menace in the original 1st season
He gots to do ryuga part 2 from metal masters
Damn beyblade really fell off just like Pokémon and Lego ninjago
This was a wave of nostalgia
THIS WAS ONLY EXHIBIT A!?!?
Can’t wait too see what you say bout Ryuga’s spin stealing 🔥 and other events in the Beyblade Metal series 🔥🔥
Ty now i know bey blade was rlly that deep🙏 sidenote: we gonna have to see more of that ranking list, do we  get an opinion on who ranks where or nah?🤔
Oh yeah this guy! The insane bastard.
i knew with all the beyblade vids coming out, i KNEW that cj was going to put Ryuga in the round table eventually.
Metal Series Forever bro, shogun steel was ass, beywheels was stupid as hell, burst is shit, Idk about X but god damn it gotta be bad if elon musk got his hands on it.
I forgot all about this crazy bastard lol now if you look back on it he reminds me of Grimmjow....which reminds me...why no Grimmjow video.
The goat has arrived
It would be cool if CJ Dachamp covers some Tekken. I could see one for Heihachi 🤣
Please do part 2 I need more!
I don't know wassup with all the beyblade talk but I'm loving it 💯💯💪🏾
even crazier was that when he was possessed MC had to call on Ryuga's soul as part of his power of friendship to "save him" meaning he helped himself lose by loaning his power to the MC as well meaning this L is ungodly technical
Cj lets get this straight Ronaldos the goat 🐐🇵🇹
all he gotta do is throw his beyblade and he'll steal ya shi
This video bout to be 🔥🔥 Cj will never fail to disappoint
Bro was so strong he lost to plot
Nah buu fr goes into T for top tier menace, because this man broke into heaven just to catch that babe, like you said man’s definitely going for T for Top, and this fucker Ryuga is fr a menace
LETS FFFLLLIIIPPPPIEEESS GOOOO!!! MY BROSKY FINNALLY DID ITT!!
The Metal beyblade series is wild, and Ryuga is absolutely baller, but for me the original beyblade series will always be the best. The music was better than we deserved, the animation although dated is still brimming with style. Tyson is a way better protagonist than Jinga and he has an awesome Grandpa to boot. The team dynamic is also way more balanced than the metal series. Instead of everyone being saved by Jinga christ everyone gets the spotlight in the original. Tyson also gets the humble pie when he deserves it. Kia is also an interesting foil to Tyson in the first episode he walks up to his subordante who just lost to Tyson and K.O.s him.
I’ve been waiting for this 😌
Why did bro lowkey sound like the beyblade announcer at the beginning
13:27 soon as the drago takes over ryuga kids all ran be like " oh hell naw "
I eagerly await your eventual Solo Leveling video
Also CJ has been watching too much WWE including NXT
i cant see him without hearing Baby Kia's Let's Play A Game
If I can make a nomination for someone who should be in the Black Air Force round table, it would be Yugi from Yu-Gi-Oh! Season 0  Here is why:  He puts people into penalty games, which mentally and psychologically destroys the ops mind  He tricked an escaped convict from death row into setting himself on fire and watched him die   He made his rival Kaiba brain dead and made him have to mentally put all the pieces back together   Blew up a guy in a game of table hockey  Electrocuted an entire gang   Poisoned a kid   Stole someone's soul and sealed it in a pot    Those are my reasons why he should be nominated but read the manga or watch the anime for season 0 because its nothing like the light hearted show we grew up with
The dude with the afro is captin capri with his bay capricorn and the scouter is so he can hit sniper shots with his bay
And he still got what he was doing in metal masters and metal fury😂
About Gingka’s W:L record, didn’t he actually lose against Libra? Or was that after the L Drago fight?
Hopefully we get a video on Kyoya too eventually.
ALLL THAT WAS EXIBIT A??
Nah that bey commentator was spot on
Bro we gotta get the Briarwoods in the round table, they emanate Black Air Force energy. Especially Sylas
Ryuga was pretty much a generation's introduction to a character being HIM.  The fact that this character only ever took 2 Ls in the entire series was astonishing for 8-year old me.
goat
Uncle ruckus hidden nephew
I was waiting for this one lol I've known since he fucked up hikaru, HE TRAUMATIZED HER, SHE NEVER BATTLED AGAIN
I would love a whitebeard or Blackbeard video
7:26 I think cj is done with Ryuga 😂
If someone like this can make the table, I wanna see some Seto Kaiba respect.
Let's remember this is just  metal fusion ryuga metal masters and metal fury is when shit gets really wild
awwww let me tell man, beyblade the metal series was straight lit fire back in my childhood.
Bro next Bakugan
Yesssiiirrrrrr
I never expected a Video about the Beyblade Goat himself
Speed made it to CJ videos 4:21 👏👏👏
Beyblade really is that serious😭
No because in the manga he was also a demon like bro literally destroys Pegasus by like chapter 5 of  the manga and then proceeds to say "Get your daddy to buy you a real beyblade, oh wait you don't have a dad anymore" like ryuga will always be my goat.
Anyone else wanna see Gilgamesh from the Fate series on the Round Table?
Oh my god, nostalgia just hit me like a bullet train  I LOVED THIS SHOW AS A KID!!
The long forgotten Beyblade seasons. Nostalgia, hype, and goosebumps. Glad you brought the Round Table back with this one.
Hey Cj can do a video on Todd MacFarlane spawn the animated series and saints of killers.   I think you’ll like spawn the animated series and I know that the saints of killers is  a comic book  character character and live action and as no animated appearance. But I think his feats make up for it like how he survived an atomic bomb and shoot and killed god and took his chair and became the new god of haven.
YOU KNOW ITS THE BEST FUCKING DAY WHEN CJ UPLOADS
Ho I can already see chavezz and skittensays face when he said "and that was exhibit A"
Ryuga made Madara proud❤‍🔥
YESSIRRR
Cj the definition of Quality over Quantity I remember watching this dudes stuff since the omni man video dropped and his videos have only gotten better since then
And thus we never seen any of the female beybladers in the future series ever again because of this menace
yo u should do zeref from fairytale
Beyblade is a wild show, Moses had a Beyblade and God probably created the heavens and the Earth and then created Beyblade and said let it rip and it ripped also taking out your ultimate Glazer is crazy
3:09 this mf is dissre-fucking-spectful
Cj you did ryuga justice.
That last fight was paid
can't wait man they did ldrago drity man
Bro’s done more damage to stadiums than Bane
Let’s make this video YouTube treating #1
Need that next part, this concussion got me like Hikaru’s mom
That was only part 1😨
THE KING HIMSELF PULLS UP LET'S FUCKING GO!!!!!!!
Ryuga the G.O.A.T, looking forward to the next part
Finally people are recognising and talking about The GOAT RYUGA  He is such a Menace and a well written character
Na i need them daily bangers
I fu**in hate the Power of Friendship trope. You're telling me since the mc got some friends to say "kick his a**", he can just suddenly somehow beat the villian's a**? Straight-up bs. It gets more annoying when the villian is blatantly stronger than the mc but still somehow loses since "the mc always comes out with the w" bs. Also, where tf were the refs when the mc's friends blocked the attack from Ryuga? Interference at its finest 😂. This is why I love animes like JJK so much. Sometimes the good guys win, while at other times, the bad guys win. It creates a great balance in the show and doesn't create a trope where the mc just dogsh**s on his entire verse without trying. Shows like JJK actually give their story high stakes (maybe even a little too high stakes). It follows logic and has a balanced power system.
Would love to see you do a record of Ragnarok video
spinning tops were not that serious 💀
Ryuga is like Mariks demonic little brother
You know, since LDrago feeds on negativity, the power of friendship was literally a PERFECT COUNTER to it
2:04 MOSES!? 😨
happy belated birthday bro 🎉🎉 Shoyo on top
Wait, exibit a was 1 video? Fucking hell, that's not a good sign for his opponents.
Impatiently waiting, homie.😂
Hold on. I had to check, the moment I heard "Cleopatra." She, also, is of Greek descent. Specifically, she is the daughter of Ptolemy. One of the four generals of Alexander the Great who took over after his rule. And the Greek ruler over the Egyptian area.
It's an egregious crime not to mention the time he was facing a team of bladers and decided to just throw El Drago at them instead of using the launcher.
He needs to do megatron or Optimus prime for his next video
He travels via meteors, not even Madara is this insane
If y'all actually think about it, the beys were basically scaled to be past planetary level. Pegasus was capable of circling the universe in under a minute, and used multiple special moves that were capable of evaporating the planet (which if u ask me is insanity for a spinning top bruh) the feats continue on bro, I'm not even playing
Never thought I’d see the day beyblade was here. Thank you bro.
Bruh, give us Mash Burndead
You forgot DIO
You cut your intro short
I miss old beyblade...
I was never really into Beyblade, but after watching this… I’m still not interested in Beyblade. Still, Ryuga is an absolute GOAT, I will admit.
CJ knows about the GOAT RYUGA?  You love to see it
You caught me off guard with this one.
Real bay blade would probably be more popular if it was just half as destructive as this
My favorite childhood menace! I’m so happy you’re covering him yo!!🤩🤩🤩 Beyblade is my childhood fr!!🤩
The parents the let their kids stay at these bey tournaments need to get some rankings. Cause how tf you ganna let your kid sit front row to a live mortar display.
beyblades are about silly children toys also Beyblades:
i saw the notif and said “no fucking way”
i remember how everyone used to glase tf out of left spins like damn they arent that cool (im left handed so it was me too)
Please put mugen from samurai champloo in there!
Ryuga vs Kenta was a VIOLATION of a century bro
Bro was gojo BEFORE THE GOJO 💀
ryuga v. goku
Let's go
This was all thanks to me when I posted that one comment
Of *COURSE* CJ makes a video on Ryuga. That man was a menace for a *LOT* of people's childhoods.
FINALLY 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🫡‼️‼️
1h gang
This anime is dookie
Wait, blowing up ring for a death match. Bro, is Toguro's son alright.
Yo I remember This guy was a menace 💀😭
Anyone else forget this was only exhibit A until the end
That man ryuga to menacing  to resist
Let’s fucking go the goat our glorious king CJ has returned
12:21 Kyoya ain't a bitch
You have to make another video on Tokyo revengers
Ryuga. The one man crazy enough to fight against the writers themselves in this franchise. Took the L and said fuck it. That shit ain't happenin again on my watch. The only one taking the L in LDrago is the dumbass across from me.
Well if we adding beybladers to the table, we need to see some yugioh players here, i can sense kaiba energy
You should do yor next, she is a fuckin beast
Finally the great ryuga gets the spot light
Aight now we talkin
Don’t forget the second series where Ryuga fucking ditched all the dark energy in Ldrago evolved it into meteor Ldrago and was stronger than he was in the first series by just using his own power
At this point, I'm *betting* that CJ wanted that Madara "LET IT RIP" excuse. This ep EXCEEDS expectations, ngl.
pause
Season 0 Yami Yugi next
There's another character from beyblade who flips his hair up along with his personality
when i saw the black air forces roundtable im like yessir we in for a banger
Or god of highschool 😂
Ai cuh u already at 16k likes so post the bih by tmrw
Ryuga is the strongest anime character in history
Hope alls been good chanp, thank you for the content I won't even give bayblade a glance ,but this made it sound like overlord 😂😂😂
Tylearned really put Beyblade commentary on the map
i LOVED this era of bayblade
He walked so Bakugo could be accepted by Society
Man is so damn serious about a game of spinning tops
Thank you again CJ for being the GOAT of YouTube! ALL YOU NEED TO DO AFTER THIS IS MAKE THE PUCCI VIDEO. THAT NIGGA IS TOO DISRESPECTFUL
It's time for some peak
bruh played WW so much he got into a Beyblade mindset (old WW mains know)
Finally, RYUGA: THE DRAGON EMPEROR IS HERE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LMFAOOOO CJ got the Pokemon gym music
Bro, for real taking me back to my childhood
I've been DYING to see this man on the roster. I'm a Beyblade fanatic and Ryuga is in my top 3 of the most savage creatures to ever touch down in the world of Beyblade. He had everything a menace needed: - Dripped out of his mind from his head down to his feet - Possesses the second most absurd Bey to ever be created (he recently got dethroned by Mirage Fafnir; wielded by Free De La Hoya) - Has an unfathomable amount of Ws to his name (I won't say bodies cause thankfully the Metal Fight saga wasn't THAT insane.....*foreshadowing Ryuga's fate*) - Has taken ZERO losses up until he started getting robbed by a literal spawn of Satan (and I guess the fade with Gingka at the end counts for something even though he literally couldn't do anything about L-Drago's crave for destruction) - Shattered every possible form of WTF moments throughout the entire saga - Learned from his mistakes in the past and not only mastered his Bey, but even made a friend along the way. Ryuga to me was like Tai Lung from Kung Fu Panda. A prodigy that ended getting robbed of eternal glory and grew hatred to society for it. RIP to this legend man. He was the ultimate menace in my eyes.  Edit: I actually forgot to add the most important trait this man actually has in his entire arsenal. You know what they say about niggas with white hair being absolute demons right? Well yeah, there you go. 🤣
The fact the video is only exhibit a is crazy.
CJ doing a Beyblade video this is crazy
To be fair on that loss at the end, LDrago is built off of pure negativity, and like any N-moment, it can be beaten by Peace + Hope...   Plus Ryuga was cheesed off at original LDrago for taking over his body all the time, so he kinda dipped so he could tell LDrago to Shove it XD
Damn that was just exhibit A in 1 video. Ryuga stays cooking.
Anyone know the song/ theme playing @7:45?
I'm backkkkkk
This is on my birthday holy fuck
We got the video for the legend, but we need someone else. The arrow of the Dragon Emperor, the inheritor of Ryuga’s star Fragment, and one of the only people to damage L-Drago: my boi Kenta! Man went through the craziest training arc of all time to become another GOAT.
The craziest part is that this is all only part 1. The Dragon Emperor got so much more disrespect, and black air force energy to give throughout the rest of the series. This man was screwed by the plot and then came back STRONGER. 🔥🔥🔥
Hoping for a part 2 because he went out like a boss, literally 1v1d a GOD
Wait till meteor el drago
Ryuga here getting the Marik treatment and drip, if you know what i'm talking about.
Please do anyone from the Yugioh series, please!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Ryuga was basically the Yujiro hanma of Beyblade he was an absolute demon.  If you had LDrago as a kid you were the coolest kid in school. I had a special Gold Meteo LDrago from a battle set.   Meteo LDrago was actually insane IRL as you could actually do Ryuga’s signature hand toss spin in real life and win thanks to the spin steal gimmick.
🔥🔥And here 🐉 👑 we go 🔥 🔥
I have given this vid a like
mf I was about to start working after hours of procrastinating, why did you upload now?
Tokyo revengers !!! Plz?😅
We NEED Accelerator from a certain magical index on the round table
That dude Ryuga be like if Kai when to the deep with black dranzer
I'm only subbing to see where ryuga goes that is literally my only reason
Bro you should do a video on TMNT 2003 shredder
I love Ryuga
Second i saw Ryuga in the thumbnail i was like: LETS GOOOOO  Man i haven't seen this show in a long time. Fun vid.
Im surprise that Cj champ and synsei didn't do yugioh
It’s talking to me 💀
That was just exhibit A..... WHAT ELSE HAS THIS MENACE DONE?!?!
you should do a black air force on Sung Jin-Woo when solo leveling finishes
The most unserious serious antagonist in anime history
beyblade was really that serious 😭
Kyoya vs Ryuga was Gojo vs Sukuna back in the day
bro finally ive been waiting
🎉🎉🎉
Hikaru retired in second season due to PTSD
Technically Jinga was 115-0 since he beat 100 beys in one battle and ryuga still hoed him 😭☠️
w vid
damn he got a continue lol
In the manga, the blue-haired girl actually died💀
Bro I was so hyped when I saw this 😭😭
So when we’re finally letting Seto Kaiba join the black force round table then, lol
YEEEES!!! RYUGA MADE IT!!! 😆😆
So does this make Yujiro the Speaker of the Table if Buu is President and Madara is Vice President?
....hell ya
Can you put Johan Liebert on the round table? Thanks and have a nice day.
CJ, when do you think you can consider Meruem from Hunter x Hunter?
Watched this all the way through, IM WAITING FOR BRO TO COOK AND SERVE
Ryuga kinda reminds me of Marik from Yugioh
Please drop it next week bruh
Ryuga is the definition of a edgelord, man can act like shadow and still talk the game 😂
I thought beyblade was about spinning tops for children to enjoy. THIS AINT WHAT I EXPECTED....... cant wait for part 2 tho
when he became one with L drago is really when he became a dawg
First
Never thought beyblade would be this crazy and utterly unhinged to the twelth degree
Three parter for this one man is madness😂
Ryugua is him he the  goat all the way king of blade blades
Spin again Spin again until you dizzy
CJ if we don’t get that damn YAMI vid, bro been sitting at the round table for a hot minute
I'm still waiting on the solo leveling. My boy gotta get on the round table
Doffy about to get 3 seasons
You know your a menace when the plot had to step to defeat you 💀
Bro, im soo glad beyblade is getting the recognition it deserves W vid CJ
Showing the Big Man Ryuga in his glory days is truly worth recognization. Respect CJ 🫡
16:48 This man is Violently Humping the AC at the speed of light! That's a hilarious gif right there! 😂
You know whats crazy? Half of the tyrants on that list did way more heinous things than the german guy but for some reason YouTube only cares about the latter.
This man Ryuga absolutely deserved to be on the throne. It's About Damn Time!
I was just talking about this nigga the other day 😂
FINNALY I am a bayblade fan and have been WAITING for this
Wake up babe. CJ just posted peak
Idk why never seen Beyblade but Ryuga reminds me of Yami Marik
Ok anyone agree masquerade deserves a seat at the round table.?
He ain't beat'in Goku
Of course madara,yujiro and buu are the top 3
Ok why is Moses here? Got me so bad I don’t know what to say 😂😂😂
Lmao 🤣 let's go that's crazy
LETS PLAY A LITTLE GAME I MADE, ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS PICK A CANDY BAR
Nah cj was glazing him more then jjk fan girls glazing gojo 😭
The amount of references in the video are insane😂😂
Day 1 of demanding Kaido be put at the round table. Man is a menace among menaces.
i had no idea this was a show i thought it was just a terrible toy that was released at one point lol
more than taylor is CRAZY
Ryuga was just so goated, you could literally feel the black air force energy radiate when he was on screen.
No wayyyyyy my favorite
my childhood
yo wtf, since when was beyblade this intense?   It caught me out of guard to see that they even added historical lore, moses of all people used a beyblade to split the sea?! looool
I can't wait to see the greatest violation of Ryuga whole life: when the ppl were after him n he threw his blade out by hand n let their beys kinetic energy fuel his blade😂😂😂
17:07 I mean gingka bey is the opposit of L drago L dragon gets power from evil shit pegasus gets power from good shit its how L dragon lost like 1000 years ago when you become the world top 1 enemy everyone is gonna like the dude who fights you
BRO I WAS LEGIT JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS CHANNEL TOO!
this ma is gonna get folded by a child I just know it
7:23😂
Did not expect a beyblade character but Ryuga was coooold 😤😤😤
He really did all that shit for a blayblade. Ryuga is a goddamn menace
That fact ruyga had to initiate plot armor to not lose to kyoya is crazzzyyy 💀
Yo w cj for the whoop that trick reference
i can see why sukuna not S+++ YET JUST WAIT FOR THE ANIME THE MANGA KILLIN IT
Honestly didn’t think we’d see Ryuga up here
Or shishio makoto
His top G but when he met nemesis, bro got humble 😂
Bro for me RYUGA should be one of the faces of the Founders of the Black Air Forces, although he toned down in later season's Ryuga is the best main threat in the Meal Fight series. He only lost to Plot and a Fucking GOD but other than that he could beat literally ANYONE and I'm SO glad your covering this character because besides Frieza he's probably my favorite villain
Can you do himura kenshin next
If P2 includes the Metal Fury aka The Goats Last Hurray then it BETTER mention how Ryuga bullied a kid into become a goat and dipped out the show giving him the remaining Goat Powers he had left, he will be missed 🫡
CJ when we getting one on the GOAT Seto Kaiba
This was fire
Bro ain’t no damn way that was only just exhibit A 😭
Bro what else did bro do next im going to see him pull a grithin
You gotta do a video on the goat Marik ishtar and/or bakura
Ryuga next  sukuna
SHOUT OUT TO ZEKKO7….he did it first!!!!!
Cj you are one of my myth⭐️
Yes sir the boy done did it a again ❤❤😂😂😂
Love the Messi shout-out my G
Bro is cold as hell
Ryuga is the Greek god of being disrespectful, Menacing, and just being negative.
Throughout the beys and the bladers, he alone is the dragon emperor
Can you do doflamingo next?
Bruh.
Finally a cj upload, its been ten thousand years.
Glad to see the Dragon Emperor getting the recognition he deserves. Though I don’t consider Ryuga the GOAT until Metal Masters with Meteo L-Drago. Hard to consider him the best while relying on the Dark Power
Ryuga was straight up sayian and namik saga vegeta  With the attitude of kaiba
Yooooo
bro i did not see this coming. I used to watch that show. I did seen the orignal series of bayblade.  Him & kai are op
Ryuga gives me marik energy from yugioh😂😂
I never thought this day would come
Like up the video for part 2 ❤
Ryuga is the only child at the round table
L DRAGO BE COOKING MY CHILDHOOD FR and ginga with his pegasus screaming his name during all time he about to lose And of COURSE ROCK LEON
You did beyblade’s biggest menace but please do Yu-gi-oh’s! The dragon lover Seto fucking Kaiba! And here’s just a few things that I think makes him deserve a trial: -Kidnapped/Beat up the elderly for a card -Killed/helped explode his dad when he tried taking over his body -Defied fate and sacrificed *GOD* to sum his favorite dragon -Made a jet to ride his said favorite dragon -Was willing to off himself to win a card game -*Invented time travel to run the fade one last time in the afterlife*
13k in 1 hour not bad he really did it
AMEN🙏
Bro you need to put Brooklyn from plastic gen on the round table
This made me happy
Been waiting a while for this one but CJ NEVER disappoints!!!
CJ this the only time imma disagree with you, cus ngl, burst actually had peeps going mad, making cults over one loss, breaking beys, ryuga may be the GOAT of metal but there’s some contenders
why does the three purple dragon heads look like the Doku Doku No Mi fruit from one piece a little?!
🐉🔥🔥🔥L-DRAGO🔥🔥🔥🐉
this jit had dat dawg in him fr
is new beyblade  good cuz im only a old bey fan
Music?  17:09
I've been saying this since 2021. If Beyblade wasn't marketed towards kids, Ryuga would be held in high regards with a lot of your favorite antagonists. He would be just like Oikawa, but for kids.
Ryuga is one of my favorite villains. I would watch a whole show to see episodes of him.
He had dat DAWG in him bro
Ryuga really told Gingka to go & get a better Bey from his "dead" father. Keep in mind, he was the main reason that Gingka's father "died."
I would rlly like a yusuke vid, bro has that mentality and true power of black air force energy than the rest of the others in the round table.
what the fuck are the odds, you post this as I just got my beyblades from my parents basement and I am currently in the middle of buying a ton of beyblades
Omg no way he did beyblade this is so fye
BEEN WAITING ON THIS FR
Let’s get that part 2 😤🤝
So how's it going
Indeed one of the best anime characters in history
🖐🏽👀🤚🏽
whats the song that plays during the scene ryuga takes on the 40 beyblades??
I remember him lol
peak posted
Hatred: What’s Good N$&&@😂 lmfao that was perfectly made. Boondocks ✊🏽
10:59 Bro…made her a whole side character. All her clout went out the window
Yes! We got ourselves a BFA Ranking system! Going to be fun to see the list when it is all set up properly to see just are the most absolute menaces (even though the Top 3 are pretty much locked in).
The more, the characters look like Yugioh rejects; I don't watch it.
Ryuga was a absolute goat he was ready to run anybody’s fade and l drago is a literal black airforce bey
I’ve been waiting for this moment! Ryuga’s synopsis was long overdue.
Finally CJ it took you long enough😂
Here we go 🍿😂
damn man only exibit A jeez ... you should do one on marek on yu gi oh first gen! always a pleasur to see your video man
Talk the about Beyblade demon
This boy is at least top 6 with the amount of stuff he does alone
The fact that that was exhibit a really tells hiw how much of a menace ryuga is
Ngl, I was waiting for this to come up in my recommendations.
Damn that's a memory unlocked
You absolute GOAT Ryuga on top
He didn’t but sukuna on S+++. He better give me a good explanation why not
I was just thinking when Cj Dachamp gonna upload again. Guess that got answered in a hour
YES!!!! I’ve seen other YouTubers talk about how much of a menace Ryuga was during our childhood 😨  We can finally see CJdachamp give Ryuga his seat to the round table of Black Air Force activity
I still have all my metal beyblades bro. the new beyblade burst the plastic ones that explode are ass. metal fusion was fire.
About damn time! Got me watching old videos like we were a couple that broke up. Sheesh!
Goku solos? Nah, fuck that, Ryuga Solos.
The fact that this man has only taken 2 L’s in the entire carrier
You gotta do phoenix
YESSS YESSS YESSS CJ NOW JUST 2003 shredder  YESSS. MY NIGGA CJ THE ACTUAL CHAMPION
U gotta do the og Beyblade revolution too. That nigga Brooklyn was opening dimensions to another world
He’s back with the vids. There fire
CJ I'm locked in I'm going to watch beyblade
I had a fairly rough day, been like that for a few but mannnn watching these videos...I cant stop fuckin laughin brooo. So thank you.
Ok I knew Hikaru got packed and put in retirement. BUT I ACTUALLY FORGOT SHE GAVE UP HER DREAM AND PROMISE TO HER MOTHER RYUGA STRAIGHT STOMPED HER SOUL OUT
I swear I was him in middle school I was taking everyone's fingers in class on god
What these kids today know about the MENACE known as ryuga
Ryuga is Vegeta. Started a pure villain, became the undisputed favorite.😂
He was so powerful he made a side character the main character, btw his irl bey was unique for having rubber reverse rotation that actually drained other beys, it was banned for a bit if I remember correctly
This dude is a monster in the middle of the society right now
Ryuga having a glaze master is the best 👌 part of the vid
Plot armour is a bitch 😒  but there's another anime where the mc can literally kill anyone just by saying "die" u should check it out fr
Shut up and take my likes!!
Can you do pyi from turbo
MY GOAT
You just awakened my childhood
Do a video on solo leveling pls
Nah we need PT 2 now ryuga was a goat bro Literally lost twice out of the whole series and that was to a literal god and he was technically cheating bro had every star fragment iykyk
Where is yujiro vs baki?
Ok Nani the fuck? I legit didn’t think you’d be making a video about this menace!   I don’t mind, but… OK! Guess we’re doing this.
Childhood menaces hit different.
Ryuga like im dat dawg
W vid
Finally You did a VIDEO ON THE GOAT THE DRAGON EMPEROR
Olay, so in the manga for Metal Fusion (Also known as Metal Fight), we got some spoilers:       Ryuga actually chills out after having to survive in the wild with Kenta whom he bonds with. By the time Ryuga DIES—he gives his energy to Kenta and helps him defeat Nemesis FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE. Kenta then becomes the GOAT.
Omg a vid dropped and so damn "early" too, good job
I WAS JUST FUCKING TALKING ABOUT THIS MF IN MY SCHOOL!!!!
The moment I heard the Skyrim music at the VERY beginning, I knew that all npc’s are good as dead ☠️
My glorious king Cj has uploaded😫
Beyblade wasn’t this serious 💀
People sleep on the chaos in the Beyblade franchise. Even back in the day WAAAAY before Metal Fusion there was some wild shit happening.
if u come into contect with this absolute DAWG, ur instantly picking a god and praying
He has to do masquerade from Bakugan
Ryuga looks like he listens to Yb 24/7
😂 God damn he really was the 🐐
Oh my god I thought I was the only one who remembered this show
I need you to put in that clip from Ilja Dragonouv's recent promo when he's saying he's coming for Melo's soul. Trust me, bro.
Bro we need Kyoya at the table. I don't care if I'm straight glazing him. It's Kyoya the most wild spinner to do it
She took a whole Galik gun... He caused property damage and she LIVED!!! NAW NAW NAW DHE BE 10FT UNDER
THAT WAS JUST EXHIBIT A?!
Ryuga got robbed bad at the end of S1, it's genuinely hilarious to watch the writers come up with BS to counter him to have an easy-to-sell ending.  Ryuga is probably the best character in Beyblade, in hindsight. He fit into a kids show while also killing, traumatising and injuring people left and right, and while his role in S1 may be to serve as an edgy villain, in season 2+3, imo, you really can't hate him.
The legend finally talks about Ryuga, I am very happy.
I SWEAR I HAVEN’T HEARD THAT NAME FOR SOOOOOOOO LONG THANK YOU CJ FOR BRINGING THIS OG MFER TO THE ROUND TABLE
I was bouta say bro, no way u ain’t including the time he damaged a fxxking floating city of beyenergy💀
bro was killing people over a game about spinning tops
LET'S FUCKING GO YOU MADE IT MY GUY!!!!!!!!
The Taylor, Skip, and Shannon reference 😂😂😂
Win or lose, Madoka is the ultimate winner because she's always making bank fixing beyblades.
I SCREAMED SO FUCKING LOUD WHEN I SAW THIS!!! The moment I saw this DOG going viral, I felt in my heart body mind and SPIRIT that you HAD to give this man - this GOAT a trial.  RYUGA FOR PRESIDENT ✊✊
Crazy how I've been just randomly having the urge to look at beyblade stuff this week too
I need part 2 ASAP
ayo off topic but why aint kaneki at the round table
Ryuga in metal masters really humbled jack and straight violated 😭😭😭
This was definitely the antagonist of my entire childhood.
Damian vs. Julian is the worst violation of the series bro but ryuga was a troll among trolls
Man that bring me back me and my brothers love Blade blade and the theme song God I got the song in my head now thanks to you can’t wait for part two 😊😎
Ryuga was a fuckin menace The goat!! My Childhood Hero 🙏🔥
Never in my life would I have thought anyone from the Beyblade universe would be worthy of a seat at the round table
Always sounding gay
I didn't watch Metal Fusion as much as the og trilogy but Dang, this is ASTRONOMICAL.
Ryuga was beyond ignorant 💀
It’s funny knowing people are gonna make ryuga reaction videos watching this video even though over 10-15 people already made a few ryuga menace videos. (If it sounds like I’m hating I’m not)
Dogi sound like zarbon from dragon Ball. Z
Don’t forgot the time where Ryuga threw his bey and still won bro like He’s the Goat
What does tbd mean
This is some hard core bla blades 😂😂😂        FYI pls don’t hate on I’ve never seen the show tho I am a noob low tier anime weeb 😅
Idk what to even say to this
16:13 sometimes ya just gotta apply this line to a lotta villains. (Also my god this vid got me tearing up ya too funny man XD)
Damn, Ryuga made Hikaru's fine ass a receptionist for the rest of the anime and gave her PTSD. And she was the only female blader at the time!
Let's play a little game I made 😈😈😈😈😈👺👺👹👹
It's been a hot minute since I've heard of this guy's name
Beyblade has gotten some hype recently & I love it
Crazy how beyblade blew up again that even cjdachamp made a vid on ryuga
RYUGAAAA
Had a feeling this crazy muthafucka was gonna be here eventually 😂
Huh, none of the 40 punching bags landed in the spike pit....kinda wasteful.
Any one else hear yo yo
The call it L-Drago because it be handing out Ls left and right.
Our childhood menaces
FINALLY! Been waiting for this one!
YESSIR
CJ when you gonna upload on your second chanel
I remember watching him in old Beyblade anime when I was 8
Give us that part 2 next week Cj
I don’t blame anyone for D1 meat riding Ryuga he is HIM
16:23  Cj wasnt even glazing no more  he had 22in of meat in every one of his holes for Ryuga
YES HIS BACK CJ IS BACKKKKKK🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ryuga unironically TERRIFIED me as a child.
Hell yeah, Ryuga was the biggest menace in the entire beyblade universe but one of the most disrespectful shits he ever did was the fucking hand spin
THATS HIM. THATS MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD VILLAIN
Unc back at it again
Jk
Bro finally did beyblade!!! I hope you do more beyblade videos!!!
I was waiting for this vid 😂 Ryuga is TOP TIER!
glad to see kyoya get some love😂💯
Let’s goooooo !!!!!!
Y’all can’t tell me living in this verse is a good idea. Imagine watching a spinning top match and the whole ref tells you to run away💀💀💀
Love for a shout out 🤞🏾💯
If beyblade wasn't market for kids, then  ryuga kill shots would have looked lethal
Brotha really making us wait
I cannot believe that I was just casually watching beyblade back then, and not when I see menaces in anime like Madara I just go "He mid fr, Ryuga would beat his ass in seconds."
When he debuted he had that dog in him
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! *LET IT RIP!*
Liked the video but what has been up with the Ryuga hype recently its been everywhere its crazy I don't dislike it sense beyblade is my goat kids cartoon but still
Will you ever do Yakuza series to see if kiryu or goro maijima have that black air force energy
Please repent of your sins and give your life to God. He deserves the praise. He wants you to come to Him. Amen. ❤
now I want yall to realize everything here is just SEASON 1 he does more crazy shit in later seasons
Anyone notice an odd increase in Beyblade content on Youtube lately?
Mans gave him self a better Update then fortnite's 💀
I really like how you use the sonic unleashed music in your videos likes seamlessly and it’s fun when I notice
is that philly?
What's crazy is Ryuga's W/D/L ratio (Win/Draw/Loss) This absolute Emperor had a record of 54/1/2 over the course of the metal ANIMATED series alone. Thats 54 Wins, 1 Draw, and 2 Losses. The wins become 55 if you count him beating Sakyo in the pretext of shogun steel. And the Draw was off screen in the show but included in the movie with Helios and Sol Blaze. Bro took 2 L's to plot, one the main character and the other being a literal God of darkness. Bro is the only Dragon Emperor for a reason.
imma need the captain yami one gang
Bro is 12 and is already doing property damage, destroying souls, going into death matches. Compared to him, my life suddenly feels so uneventful.
So 2003 Shedder when and Yami Kenpachi and Mugen when
Brudda u back?
sukuna better be above yujiro in them patch notes
I knew i recognized the music at around 15:30 its from Palworld lol
Never thought beyblade was gonna be serious
Okay seriously, we need a Vegeta trial, and a Moro trial.   Yes I know the latter isn’t animated and we don’t know when he will be, but that dude was an absolute menace. He’d kill planets for no reason other than he was hungry. This man was DBS equivalent of GALACTUS! Also he wiped the entire Z fighter team at the same time. Come on, this goat man needs a trial.   Also Vegeta because every time he’s shown up in one of these videos, he’s getting clapped and we need to acknowledge the times that he clapped his opponents, or even just did some really cool stuff.
In this mans life time i think he only lost 2 twice 😂
Ryuga stood on business since day 1
THIS IS ONLY EXIBHIT A OMGGGGG SDFÓDHIFGÓHF G LET THE GOAT COOK AGAIN
This man had it till death 100%
I've been waiting for the Dragon Emperor
Part one there’s three more
Noone messes with the dragkn emperor
THEY DONT KNOW A THING BOUT RYUGA, TELL THEM
Ryuga drago'd them nuts across the ops forehead😂
Ryuga had that dawg in him, first person to make us realize Beyblade was NOT gonna be all sunshine and rainbows 💀💀
He’s such a demon in the entire show. I know what happens to him tho. The plot kicked in and the writers wanted him out…
I was waiting for this
Bruh perfect timing I just finished rewatching the series last week
Bro could only lose to the plot. And they gave him Escnaor treatment too. Truly a real one
Ryuga was always the original menace to society, bro wanted all the smoke 😭
FINALLY, WE GET BEYBLADE ON THIS CHANNEL
bro took Beyblade WAY too serious
Im sorry but the lines said in this video were to wild to not have one pause, no homo, or Socks on
Fantastic video as always, I know he loses several times but you should do an episode on kaiba from Yu gi oh, that dude was INSANE
Sounds like a anime S rank but your still ranked low in S rank level
My CJDachamp senses were tingling. Had a feeling a vid was coming.
The goat himself is back ❤
When the world needed him the most he appears
Hey Cj I really love ❤️ your vids man    Pls pin 📌 me 😊❤
You have yet to do my main man Saitama I believe he should be put on trial
The fact he always had the high ground should be studied 😂
Roundtable has patch note lmao
Yessirr Ryuga really a Demon
Let's goooo W he's back and miss you 😊 and your videos and edits make me laugh ❤
He got the dog in him
Ryuga: I will not lose to scriptwriters! Me: Oh boy, do I have some bad news for you!
"Hands rated E for Everyone"
Nah imma wait for part 2 this N
Hikaru ain’t deserve that
Man this brought back memories and now I gotta figure out what Moses’s bey was
This Man Ryuga Stands on Business!
yooooooooooooo finally my goat gets a cj vid lets goooooooooooo
Thought I was losing my mind when I saw the goat Ryuga on the thumbnail... Then, after a second thought, it all made sense.
Well damn I’m early
Just wait until we get to when the goat decides to 1v1 a evil god
Fuckin BeyBlade!!!!!!!!!!
It's finally time I was waiting for this day
Hikaru got it worse than anyone, man.  Girl got her dream crushed, hit with MASSIVE PTSD, and effectively had her career ended in one swoop.  That alone should get Ryuga a fastpass…
DAMNN
Less than an hour early and ready for the BLACK AIR FORCE HEAT 🔥
Bruh ain't no fucking way...they taking Beyblade way too serious. 1 exhibit and already Ryuga looks to be 1 of the G.O.A.T.S of Black Air Force Energy.
This not even masters OR fury and he was still running fades in those two
When did Beyblade get so popular again
43 mins ago and alr poping up with 8.9k likes, (CJ IS LITERRLY DA CHAMP, GAWT DAT DWAGGGGGG IN HIMM)
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Hey Cj! You should do diavolo or pucci from jjba next or the last part of aot
Once again, CJ within another banger of a trial…AND THIS AIN’T EVEN OVER!
Since we're doing middle school game anime, look up yugioh characters like yami marek, yuri and zarc. There are some vile characters in yugioh
In the manga Hikaru supposedly died and they really jumped Ryuga
cj backkkk
Naggg
I’m so happy everyone is realizing how crazy beyblade was. This was the show I grew up on fav series till this day. Also Ryuga created hallow purple and dragon ball copied ultra instinct and much more. (Note the last one is a joke).
Lui from beyblade burst vs ryuga who is more of a menace
DAT DAWG IS DAWGIN FR
Moses, Literally Moses. HOW THE HAIL DO YOU EXPLAIN THE LORE OF THIS SHOW TO ANYONE WHILE KEEPING A STRAIGHT FACE.
I hope there's a second video about Ryuga. Specifically about what he did to that art nerd in Metal masters during the world tournament. That fight was what made me love his character more than ever.
I'm not hip to this show but after the energy attack I'm like how is this nigga not cheating like everyone else just playing with a toy this dude got magic how is this fair
that skip and shannon got me to comment, this vid is insane
Ryuga is actually him!
Ryuga low key reminds me of Yami Marik from Yu-Gi-Oh. Bruh just went around causing pain for the hell of it. Marik's deck was an immortal torture deck with more emphasis on torture in the manga 🙃. There was never a villain as cold as him in that show.
The goat has posted!💯🔥 been waiting for this😤
A 2 parter? Hell yeah
Yesssss
I haven't watched that Beyblade show in years but I just remember how little me was absolutely INTO this show. I even used to have the green lion Beyblade but I lost it :(
Never would I ever thought that this man would do a trial on the beyblade series!!!
Its funny i was watching his highlights last week and thought he would be a great person for you
Leave it to japan to make a spinning top game be this epic and destructive.
i knew he was mence sinces i was 10
This and bakugan were the shit back in the day
"He gets stronger from negativity". Ryuga is Yukki Terumi?
I miss you and olawoolo uploading constantly 😥
Ryuga been standing on business lately 😤
Bro turnd he into hollow from bleach
My nigga where you been dog
Bruh we need a part 2 for ryuga for metal masters and fury
I was wonder when CJ was gonna cover the biggest menace in beyblade history
Ain’t no way bye blade referenced Moses💀
Kyoya victim
This man just unlocked a hidden memory in the back of my brain I remeber coming home from school just to watch beyblade
I hope to see some yugioh and Pokémon characters. We need vector for zexal in one of these series.
Ryuga was my favourite character and the most iconic character in beyblade history. And it’s honestly amazing seeing that everyone is realising how much of a goat/menace he is. The fact that CJ made a whole vid about him and that whole vid is just based off exhibit A just says a lot about how crazy this character is. He really was sukuna before sukuna.
You Have to do Phi from Beyblade burst 💥 turbo next please 🙏
Finally someone sees what I see and that’s a DOG
4:40 Is that Leland?
START LIKIN WE GOTTA GET PART 2 ASAP‼️‼️🗣️🗣️
We was really in school playin beyblade not knowin how deep it was😂
you gotta talk about the russian team in og beyblade 😭😭
cj there is one person I need to see on your channel and that is the immortal king wang ling yhis dude is the DEFINITION OF PURE POWER!!!
*We cooking today with this one*
RYUGA IS THE GOAT FOREVER HE IS BLACK TIMMS
Yoooooo Beyblade was the shit
Knew by the thumbnail that this was a banger
HOLY SHIT I WASN'T EXPECTING THIS AND I LOVE IT
now do beyblade burst 🤑
So does this mean he has the n word pass
FINALLY IM SO HAPPY A YOUTUBER RECOGNIZED THIS CHILDHOOD OF A SHOW💯❤️😂👍🏽 IM WEAK ASF BEYBLADES ILL WATCH THAT JUMP RN AGAIN TF😂
HE FINALLY DID IT
Finally the menace is at the table
Bro was Unstoppable 💀
Hold up, I did not know Beyblades could do shit like that  I gotta watch this show
bro got that cory ass upload schedule
He listened to us to rank this man
Ryuga was my fav childhood villain fr
I been waiting for this moment! Honestly, Beyblade was my favorite anime when i was a kid. I was scared of Ryuga as a kid, and now i know why.
Not Ryuga hit em with the shadow wizard money gang
Any other 2000s kids just love all the love Bayblade is getting for how assertively awesome it was? Because my inner child is loving it!
Also if restricted for some reason I'd like to formally apologize and ask for me not to be. Please and thank you I really do enjoy your content. Please and thank you
The beyblade talk has reached even CJ Dachamp. This truly is the best timeline.
FINALLY!!! A CHARACTER FROM BEYBLADE GETS TO BE ADDED HERE!!! THIS IS SO AMAZING!!!"
bro caught doji lackin frfr
I wish there was a round table of anime ass pulls cause there is WAAAAAYYY too much characters that do not deserve the win they have been handed. Of course the supreme leader of that table would be none other than GOKU.
this is beyblade btw
love when i see a cj video early
He’s finally doing it
Nah doji was one of the biggest meat riders I’ve ever seen TO THIS DAY BRO went from glazing ryuga to nemesis frame 1
Ngas was destroying cities over beyblade beef ☠️.
I loved this my first beyblade was L drago
I love the bet blade revitalization rn from a bunch of different people
You left out the fact that Ryuga destroyed a crystal strong enough to hold L-Drago's destructive power by simply crushing it in his hands
Now that we got Ryuga imma need a trial for Masquerade.
Do eminence in shadow next
I love your vid ❤😂😊
Ryuga straight up THE MEANACE
Beyblade was crazy. Beyblade, Digimon, and Yugioh were the key to a great childhood.
Cj dropped?!?!! Time to glaze
Mans really did a Beyblade video, and also did a Degenerocity collab aswell. CJ doing side quests now.
When I saw beyblade I thought it was about people just battling with tops,.... this dude is literally shooting beams and taking bodies WTH?!?! This turned into a horror movie near the end. XD
YOOOO FUCK YEA!!! I been watching beyblade while high off my mind and it's been an EXPERIENCE
We would like to nominate garou from OPM into the hall
W cj
LET'S GOOOO
Bro ryuga dam used a hollow purple before it was even made 💀🔥
Yes he listened to me
We smoking on that ryuga pack
RYUGA THE ULTIMATE DAWG AMONG DAWG!!
Bro got the zero gravity music fire 🔥
Another Massive W by the Cg Dagoat
What about that one dude from Pokémon?, it’s ashes rival with the purple hair he got black Air Force energy
best day of the month
Exhibit B will kinda be his redemption arc from being ALL OUT EVIL in Exhibit A, but Exhibit C will be something else, fury and their writing had hyped bro up all the way to the end to a huge disappointment fr, was a crazy emotional coaster, can't wait!
Yes I knew you were gonna do it guess you might heard of beyblade being serious 👏👏👏👏👏👏
The fact that he only ever lost to either Plot or God is enough said
Beyblade... has always been that serious
Alright, now im not sure if this is accurate, but i heard in the manga, ryuga straight up killed that girl, no retirement necessary.
Yesss finally 🥹
father is finally back with the milk yall
RYUGA IS THE 4KIDS DEFINITION OF “HES *HIM* “
The most accurate ryuga impression
Finally another great video dropped, was missing these so bad I started rewatching all the previous black airforce energy videos today, especially my favorite on Madara
Ryuga was really that nigga man 💀
MY GLORIOUS KING THE ULTIMATE DRAGON EMPEROR RYUGA 🥛🥛🥛
17:09 what’s the soundtrack in the background ?
We gonna need reverse flash there soon
That fight with Ryuga is one of the reasons why these beyblade mofos can beat Goku
Rack up them likes yall. This vid had me rolling 💀
YOOOO, I was hoping you’d do one on Ryuga
I didn't see all of metal fusion due to only seeing it when I went to the US but good lord I will have to give it watch I did not know ryuga was that much of a menace
Wsg cj
WE FINALLY GOT MY BOY RYUGA HIS FUCKING RECOGNITION HE DESERVES IT 🗣️‼️
Ryuga the G.O.A.T x10
He should definitely have Kyoya on the round table    I mean this genuinely Ginga without any plot boost power ups is 4th strongest blader in the series after Nemis(god), Ryuga(the strongest for most of the series), Kyoya then Jinga
BRO METAL FURY AND METAL MASTERS EXHIBITS FINNA GO CRAZY
Ryuga has always been that nigga W vid
EXHIBIT A!?????
It's been so long since I seen anything Beyblade related. Thank you so much and I wish that I could watch it again.
A 161 off Exhibit a alone, yeah get the seat in the roundtable ready
This was beyblade of all things Beyblade!
Would it be possible to get Mecha sonic/metallix from super Mario bros Z. Because that man is a menace he might not do all that much but he violated everyone he came across.
Ryuga will always be my fav character he had that dawg in him frfr
yessir!!!
16:22 😅😅😅😅😅 or 33-0
Ryuga Is The Goat no questions asked🐐
Bring a whole new meaning to “Plotting on somebody”
Dam, back then I’ve always believed that was how beyblade was like, until you actually play the game 🥲
Ryuga was such a menace that they had to Madara treatment him with a bland & flat op villain with  zero personality with a op bey both descendents of a god to off him lol.
Growing up with this show was crazy and Ryuga made me lose my mind. He was made me realize “Oh wait this is no normal kid show…” this is only Fusion. Just wait till you see Masters and Fury.
ugh the power of friendship UUUGGGHHHH!
DACHAMP IS BACK! 🔥🔥🔥
When are we going to get doodle bob 😂
The Round Table having patch notes? 2024 is gonna be THAT year.
Yep definitely beyblade using moves that you wondering what show you watching
Dam beyblade really is that serious ryuga definitely  gonna be a top teir menace
Ay another banger video from the goat himself😎💥⚡️
Let's Goooooo!!!!!! Ryugaaaa!!!!

Ryuga video the day before my birthday is an awesome early birthday present by CJ 🎉❤😂😎
Finally posted😂
I need to see you do a video on yumeko in the  asylum pleaseeee 😭😭 I would die
I'm sorry, but I can't take a fuckin Beyblade anime seriously.. Is he a menace because he just throws the beyblades at people? And it hurts because they're like made of metal?
We need that part 2 ASAP!!!!!!!!
What?!
0:38 SONIC RACERS THEME!!!!!! Edit: 10:30 THAT AINT NO "GALICK GUN" THAT'S A FUCKING "DEATH CERTIFICATE DOUBLE GALICK GUN"!!! 😱😰
Yes SIR OUR GOATS AT THE ROUND TABLE
Beyblade was always that serious
ryuga deserves the black air force special edition, launcher and special edition l-drago
Lighting L drago the forbidden bey that destroys everything and yet THERES TWO EVOLUTION OF L DRAGO THAT ARW INSANE AND ONE OF THEM F**KED UP A GOD
I wonder when he’s gonna do a rimuru video rimuru is a menace
Bruh I recommend GulusGammamon from Ghost game, that Mf did alot fo characters dirty, even the protag, his partner, and the whole digital world
I don't get it, why are people suddenly glazing beyblade, this stuff been out my childhood, what's next someone glazing Yugioh villains next, cuz Marik needs to be at the Round table
You literally are goated for this one
30mins here
Do Marik from Yu-Gi-Oh
PLEASE 🙏🏾 do pain from Naruto 🟣 🔩🔩
16:08 the power of bullshit
common w
I was honestly scared of Ryuga growing up watching Beyblade. Bro was a menace in Metal Fusion, Masters, *and* Fury💀💀💀💀
there is a fake cj in the comments
That girl did not deserve to have her dreams and goals crushed like that, they did her dirty
Bruh there was a episode where the dude put a scope on his beyblade, THESE ARE KIDS TRYNA END OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES💀
I shocked that this is the fucking first exhibit
bro wanted all the smoke
First the undertakers streak and gong now trick Williams from NXTS Whoop That TRICK Whoop That TRICK is a good one
Man it suck when the writers have to step in to save the main protagonists ass
I was waiting for u to do this
Ima need that part 2 EXPEDITIOUSLY so ima send this to ma homies
Did this show have the audacity to have moses part the sea with a beyblade? They really have no shame...
Bro was kaido before kaido
OMFG YEESSSSS FINALLYY!!!!! MY BOI RYUGA ON THE REVIEW BOARD AT LAST! WHOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Been waiting for this 1. The king of spin
Ryuga be the final boss in a dark souls game 💀
Never thought I’d see the day.
No way that was all exibit A bro Gangsta 😂😭
Had to send a reminder for him to upload.
I remember my cousin buying the drago beyblade when we were kids and it was as deadly as it was in the anime
I can never forget the line your not an eagle your a chicken from when I first heard that as a kid to now that line lives in my head rent free
His back
Bro did my fav character from my childhood
Best video yet
Why is blud in space?
I NEED THIS NEXT WEEK
Aw yeah, Beyblade was one of my favorites growing up!
Finally!
I'm really early! 😮
1:14  ah yes a spoiler warning for a show that is almost 2 decades old at this point 😂
It’s out!
Never in my life have I ever needed something so much and never known untill I received it.
As someone who watched the Metal Seasons and Beywheels, this era of Beyblade was hype af but it's biggest issue is it pulled out the ass to make sure these villains get their comeuppance. That defeat for Ryuga was tropey as hell, ruined the hype he had.
IT S ONLY THE FIRST SERIES  i want the whole ryuga legacy and the episode 2 pls god
It's only been up for 30min and already 5k likes
The D1 Tweaker known as Ryuga finaly got a video W vid always
Damn CJ really cookin this year early❤
Yay im early
One of my few SS tier channels , the editing, narration and the jokes ,chif kiss
FINALLY!!!...............CJ'S BACK WITH ANOTHER VIDEOOOOOOO!!! 🤣☠️
WOOOOOOOOOOO A new video!!! slower than internet historian
LET HIM COOK 🗣🗣🗣
Now I know Ryuga oozes "I'm him" energy but what made everyone just suddenly talk about Beyblade now, especially him
Somebody did ryuga before him bro
Always a pleasure to see a cj upload in my notifications!
Do b-daman
Since we’re now including “kid shows” (in parentheses cause Beyblade is GOATED), I humbly petition that Transformers Prime Soundwave be added to The Round Table.
I'm still waiting on a video on Guts. The most Black Air Force character ever.
Just wait until he finds out about free day la Hoya
To everyone there is a fake cj in the comments
"The round table now has Patch Notes." How long till it becomes a battle royal/esport?
CJ doing a Beyblade video is something I never knew I needed😂
The 🐐 of my childhood ❤
FUCKKK EMM UP LDRAGO!
crazy shit
HE POSTED
Why does he suspiciously look like Background Character 758#?
Nah cause the way Ryuga smoked Hikaru was beyond disrespectful😭
lets go
Beyblade metal Fusion is PEAK  🔥
Finally someone is showing my boi Ryuga the true respect he deserves. He was an absolute GOAT and made the metal series awesome.
This MF is HIMOTHY
first ten seconds and we don't see a galick gun we see a FINAL KAMEHAMEHA
Ryuga popping a hollow purple for that lil ahh girl was so unnecsary
YES SIRR CJ DROP finally bro 🙌
A month or two late but he finally did it
Nga combined hollow purple + gallack gun and hado 99 😭😭😭
Finally cj gave us another peak video
I was not expecting the mad dawg Ryuga HIMself but there he is the fucking pack demon 🔥🔥🔥
bro i waited a month for a beyblade vid smh
Ryuga finally got his recognition
Ryuga is the original menace
Are you going to make another Tokyo revengers vid???
Man, I had no idea Beyblade actually went there  And here I thought Yugi-Oh was the only “kids” anime that went there
I'm still waiting for Griffith to join this roundtable...
4:46 MAJOR PAUSE!!!!!!
Coming back strong with this one! Maybe it's been a long time since I watched the Beyblade metal saga, but Hot damn, I didn't know it got this hard! And this only Part one? This is gonna be a good one!
Do a nother asylum
Nah, you gotta do all three seasons of Ryuga
the mf goat
CJ DID A BEYBLADE VID WE EATTTING GOOOOD
Was worried bro don't take off that long again😩
My childhood... hero..?
Yya another CJDACHAMP video
Yes, for those who never watched the show Cj's absolutely right All of that he said at the beginning *DID* in fact happen And the show was truly this serious
When the first round has a higher score than my I.Q
For those of you who don't know, part of what made LDrago so dangerous was the fact that it spun *left* when literally every other beyblade spun right.
Can you do a black air force video about Shadow the hedgehog.
O god
FINALLY
bro the beyblade universe was on crack😭 moses rlly said let it rip and split the sea
this demon
ryuga was the first sukana change my mind
Beyblade metal fusion was THEE BEST out of the series and toys idc wat nobody has to say. I was watching this shit everyday before school.
Let’s make part 2 happen guys like the video and get it up so that we can be ready for exhibit B and C next week.
Honestly, all of the Regional Bladers basically teaming-up to jump a guy earns some recognition as to how terrifying Ryuga is.  Also, RIP Hikaru. She came out the gates swinging with the fit and tenacity. Ended the series as a jobber with a 9 to 5, immense medical bills, and probably a restraining order for Gingka's dad.
Do rago
Yo this new beyblade hype is crazy
Can’t believe that exhibit A
Im dyin of laughter from cj's commentary!
Legit was just thinking damn he aint post in a while lemme check
Tyson or Kai would have gave Ryuga that work
Metal Fusion, my childhood
He is the sukuna of Beyblade
Menace to society
I was gonna say where is the peacock artist dude that he just violated, like arguably worse than the chick he put in a coma.
🤩 RYUGA, LET’S GO!!!! Ryuga’s an absolute menace throughout the Metal Series 🤩
HE'S BACKKKKKKK
Man, I forgot how Beyblade was goated, so I rewatch some old shows like Inazuma 11 and that’s also got it. Also watch Bakugan. The old one not the new one.
Yooo
Bro Meteo L Drago is the most unique as the orginal spin stealing beyblade and one of the strongestin that categories
It has always baffled me how people are hitting these devious actions, booming people, committing property damage, general atrocities, and many many more with just spinning tops.
Bro I’m only 17 seconds into this bitch and I’ve already been blasted with childhood ptsd. This bout to be a banger🖤🔥
Doesn't this just prove that he's trash he needed some dark beyblade or whatever it is to win if am wrong am wrong
10:58 Yeah this was absolutely true. In Metal Masters and onward, she is now the assistant to Gingka’s dad Ryo, and now prefers to work in the WBBA instead of beyblading. In fact, she literally has PTSD from fighting Ryuga.
I haven't even seen the full Beyblade series and I believe every single word you said, CJ. Also, how do you feel about Janemba?
He was the man that no one could make a beyblade like his. He truly was HIM. gone but not forgotten
can we get a sinbad video
This man got a whole ass episode just for exibit A put than man in a chair.
EARLY 🗣️🙏🏾
took you a while to talk about the menace above all menaces
Ryuga the predessor of Ryomen sukuna   The original trauma demon
Bro, thank you so much for this video. This show was my childhood man
Me: Bruh what is so special about beyblade??? *CJ answers question 5 secs later* Me: .... Well damn. Good looking out! So it's like Yu-Gi-Oh where children have access to something that could destroy the world 🤣
I like the Lebroskiis reference with them voicing the spectators
Honestly I don’t know shit about anime, but this mans vids are just hilarious even without any context
Us: Beyblade was never that serious Ryuga: L. Drago, wake up 1 sec we gotta talk to em
Ryuga ran so Sukuna could walk tbh
18:13 I knew we were going to get part 2 and 3, I mean, Ryuga in the Metal series was a menace. Even when he wasnt the main focus, that nigga presence would be known when he shows up  Also, Kyoya pushing Ryuga to his limits, focrcing him to using his Dark Nebula. (Kyoya got that dawg in him)
Bro the legendary beyblade menace in Ryuga!? to start my Friday night!? Let’s go cj! Keep up the fire, super funny and spectacular work as always! 💪🏼
Ryuga was such a menace, when I was a kid I had a dream he challenged me in a dark alley & all I saw was a Dragon coming at me while he laughed
Man didn't even go into metal masters where Ryuga had even more disrespect by literally throwing his beyblade from his hand and holding people
When we gone get our doflamingo Black af1
OH YOU BETTER DROP THAT SOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNN
big homie CJ IS BACK🎉😭
TO BE FAIR ryuga was getting amped by fear and negative feelings from the opponent so it’s valid that gingka gets buffed off friendship and love 🤷‍♂️
Is it really that serious
facts
Kira for the insane asylum.
Do Phi from beyblade burst turbo
Bro can beat Goku😂
Ladies and gentlemen he did it. Cjay uploaded. This is a day to be remembered
Just wait till exhibit B
Intro is a banger SSX Tricky
I'm not going to lie, I paused that list and I know it's not finished. But, if Slade is A, then Toji has to be S Tier lol.
Beyblade was neva this serious😭
THE GOAT HIM SELF, the first black Air Force demon I have ever seen
About fucking time, time for the real fun to begin
does cj have patreon?
Ryuga deserves ALL the glaze.
Ryuga was a monster back in the day
yk its crazy when a character gets a whole series to themselves. ryuga just different
anyone remember the scene where moses parts the sea with a bey?
The metal series was the G.O.A.T every other series was trash
I learned how to do his voice just because of how badass he was
Mans video edits got all the gems lo key.
king posts again.. god praise!
Lmmfao that Undisputed segment
Petition for Phi to be a candidate
Falcon fans DO NOT ATCH THIS VIDEO XD
Bayblade been about that lol
This video made me want to watch metal fusion again
Exhibit B gonna go crazy
1:46 farewell MatPat
How did someone from beyblade make it into this list
YOOO WTH I HAVENT WATCHED A CJ VIDEO IN SO LONG, AND THE FACT THAT HE’S EVEN MAKING A VIDEO ON RYUGA UNEXPECTEDLY JUST SHOW THIS MAN WAS THE GOAT FR 🐐😤
IVE BEEN WAITING ON A BEYBLADE VIDEO FOR SOME TIME! LETS GOOO💯💯🔥🔥
The sonic 06 sfx always got me rollin😭
Ryuga was my first crush 💀 ever since I watched when I was younger
Always great to see CJ.
I’m 790
‘Twas only a matter of time before Beyblade arrived on the table. Thank god we just finished building the new interdimensional arena, otherwise we’d have to remodel again. Even when he just walks you can hear his explosions for steps from the other side of the building! I’m honestly surprised Ryuga isn’t a founding member. And the other members? 1 - Yujiro gives this guy a nod every time he sees him. 2 - Alucard’s found a new sparring partner. 3 - Pickle yearns for the fade. 4 - Afro raises his glass of lemonade to him. 5 - We attendants avoid eye contact with him lest we get packed. 6 - Even Omni Man offered a handshake with him.  Anyone think Yugioh qualifies for this?
Ryuga really might just be that goat
Beyblade Ain't NO WAY
damn, dude got madara and Yujiro Hanma above Sukuna
Hey everyone stay blessed 🎉😅😅
18 minutes let’s gooo
Yes!!!! I was hoping you do a video on Ryuga!!!! I’m so happy there’s been a surge in Beyblade videos lately, this was my shit back in middle school 🐉 🐉 🐉
I love Cj's vids
Iv never been this early 😂🎉🎉
Never did I expect this man to talk about beyblade😭😭
It’s been so long since I’ve watched anything Bayblade related
If it pleases the court, I would like to once again and recommend Ulquiorra, black Air Force number 4 to the council
Iv never been this early 😂🎉🎉
IM HERE LET'S GO
New vid is out
This man Ryuga was a menace to the point he was literally stealing souls.
This particular character is *HIM*
W cj as usual
I really was hoping cj do it I’m so happy right now and doesn’t compare what he did in masters and fury
Ryuga might be the incarnation of ignorance
Yyyeeesss!!!
Ok so the US used those beyblade to destroy japan and made them surrender during WWII
Ryuga was one of the og's of Black Air Force energy.
RYUGAAAA!!!!
I remember watching this on CN
Me and my lover were waiting for this
If this guy is doing Beyblade then I think it’s safe to say that Phi should be on that list, that guy was an absolute menace. Or at least should be in the asylum.
The King is back . Like if you grew up with beyblade
HE catching bodys fr fr
Ryuga is pretty much the Rated E 10+ version of Shang Tsung but more dripped out.
Yasss!!!! He’s finally doing a Beyblade video!!! I’ve prayed for this day!!! Ryuga was him!! The G.O.A.T. He was Roman Reigns  before Roman Reigns
CJ, thank you for uploading! I've had a long day and now I can relax to one of your vids! LET'S GO!
upload on the second channel when
RYUGA WAS A THE BEST VILLAIN IN THE BAYBLADE SERIES THE FREAKING GOAT!!!
I shall once again throw in Hao Asakura from Shaman King. Not only was he a Menace in that anime but he actually won in the end too.

Ahh Yes
White hair, disrespectful, big ass ego, associated with the colour purple at least a few times Yeah, he was here before gojo If anything, gojo copied him
I honestly wanted to request him But even I knew how insane and questioning Beyblade was
6:30 oh nah, I know he got a whole fucken graveyard for the amount of bodies this man has
This man ryuga violated so many nigga it was crazy😤
I can’t wait for this man to talk abt Sung Jinwoo
The king finally shows up with his dradol
That random nigga with the Afro is named Tobio.
The Dragon Emperor is an Emperor for a reason
Been waiting for this one
Finally an upload in 2023
His? I mean 👀 looks feminine enough
YESSSSSSSS I WANTED THIS NEXT
Reminder: Ryuga pulled up to the very finals of the World Championship Tournament, not to help Red-Hair Blue-Horse Goku's team mind you, but PURELY so that he can run the fade at some psychotic Americans taking over the world and showing them _Who's. In. Charge._    Ryuga 👏 is 👏 Him 👏
The King is back
are you a god
Oh yeah I FW that show a ton back then.
I though this was beyblade. Not dragon ball
😭😭🙏🏾
What was this show bruh
damn im earlyyy
Bro the "Woop that Trick" line

Omg it's it's him CJ
I remember the time I beat an L Drago with a Gasher Bey during a class club.   Needless to say, I was the talk of the town…for about half an hour before losing to a Dark Orion.
1:59 i almost forgot moses was in beyblade
OMG daddy cj finally posted

10:03 Ayo Lebrowskiis plug!
Damn time you post

Yessir!
I was gonna commit about ryuga on the second sukuna video but he read my mind!
OH MY GOD CJ
HE'S BACK!!!!!
beyblade just randomly came out of no where and become popular again
Bro when you get a video about doflaming 😭😭😭
I wish he do the black Air Force energy on video games characters
Ehh, Brooklyn was better.
If you see this video at 8 minutes comment.
"Checkmate nyee" cant finish that one, had me dyin.
Reminder that this shit is literally all with toy tops  Also I know this is just a pipe dream but I do hope one day you get the chance to talk more about One Piece, your energy is peak and would mesh so well with the insanity of that series
I knew and have been waiting on CJ to drop a video on the Goat Ryuga ever since beyblade started blowing up all over YouTube again 🔥
YEEEES, YAAAAAH, hey did my childhood
4:40 my favorite d ride meme is “ bro got pregnant from all that 🍆riding”
6:21 That Was Cold!
UNCLE A WAS RIGHT
Let’s GOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! CJ uploaded
This mf scared me as a kid I’m so glad you did this
Ryuga is a S+++🔥🔥
Bro where have you been?
Bout time my nigga gets to shine
FINALLY!!!! Cj has joined the Beyblade Metal Series trend
No way bro finally talking about my childhood!🔥🔥🔥
I dont know half these characters but I stay watching and having a great time 😂
Ryuga has: tormented a 13 year old anime boy by murking his dad and giving him PTSD and several anger issues for years, has the body count in the thousands (massacred an entire village at minimum), got his demon soul dragon BS inside not one 1, not 2, _but 3 completely different kids,_ just to further fuck over the main protag, killed his former boss off of a whim cuz he was simply _beyond_ his dick-riding.  Man is LowTierGod with the actual skill to back every single thing he says.
We need a video with Vegeta please 🥺❤
Ay cj I have to ask will you ever induct a evil power ranger into the roundtable of black airforce energy
W BEYBLADE
I never knew Beyblade was this cracked 😂
Ryuga was him
I used to watch him and Ginka's final fight all the time. When my mom bought me el drago i felt like that nigga at school
About time you put this man Ryuga on the channel 🐐🐐
I WAS LITERALLY JUST CHECKING A FEW MINUTES AGO TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY NEW UPLOADS😭❤️
GOAT
We were here
bruh this is beyblade
LETS GOOOOOOOOO!!! FINALLY HES TALKING ABOUT THE G.O.A.T!!!!!!
i don't remember bayblade they like that
The Bayblade metal series was the best anime i watch when i was 6 At the way Ryuga and his bay la Drago was Crazy I'm glad that you made this video
This was the last person that I  expected CJ to do. But f*ck it, he cooked this video. 👍🏾
He finally posted
Ryuga has an max dawg in him
Man I remember watching Ryuga as a kid and I didn’t even know he had that type of Black Air Force DAWG in him lololol
Dragon emperor soaring bite strike  is the strongest anime attack ever, Tell me I’m wrong.
Cj Has Returned With The Roundtable Of Black Air Force Activity Once Again and with It Being the First Trial Of 2024 and Being The First Trial Of The Year
Ryuga is one of my favorite Beyblade characters
killing kids over a beyblade match is crazy
LET'S GOOO I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE!!
L-Drago is the best its the reason i have its logo
within 10 min gang  👇
ITS HIMMM
BEYBLADE WAS NEVER THIS SERIOUS 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔊🔊🔥🔥🔥
5 min gang
wow 4 minutes ago nice
RYUGA SHOULDA BEEN THE FIRST AT THE BLACK AIR FORCE TABLE 🚬😈 HES THE GOATT
Please make a video on Junko Enoshima From Daganronpa
LETS GOOO MY BOI RYUGA, i rewatched beyblade metal series so many times.the og beyblade is way to long for me to rewatch multiple times and the new burst was boring(both story and character designs) for me so the metal franchise shall be the only beyblade series i watched more then once fully.
5 mins 😫😭💃💣😔😱👍🏾😹🙅🏾‍♂️🙂🤯⚡️😀🇧🇷🤔🔥🛌🙏🏾🏴‍☠️🫡💫😫❤️🤷🏽‍♂️👀🕺👋😢🐺⁉️🖕
❤
Holy shit I’ve been waiting for this moment 😭😭😭 after saying ryuga’s name for like 12 videos , it finally happened 😭😭 been glazing this man from the beginning cuz that’s the goat . Finally the day has come
THIS IS THE DUDE FROM BEYBLADE HOLYSHIT I remember him in the anime when I was a kid lol, THIS MAN WAS AN ABSOLUTE MENACE TO THE PROTAG AND EVERYTHING AROUND HIM
a beyblade video?!?! I want more
yo this is a violation🥲🥲
Bayblade…Okay!
I'm glad Beyblade is becoming mainstream again.
AINT NO WAY HES BACK W BEYBLADE WAS ALWAYS THIS SERIOUS
I done know he had that dawg in him
I am so glad this man is finally getting some recognition because every time he appeared in the series you knew you were either going to see him disrespect the shit out of anyone he was fighting or flexing how much stronger he was than the main cast. Which is why when he fought Rago and was absolutely getting destroyed it broke me because that was the first person in the ENTIRE series who genuinely was beating his ass and he had no chance of winning.
My god I forgot how much of a menace this guy was.  Edit after finishing the episode: THAT WAS ALL JUST EXIBIT A?! OH GOD ALMIGHTY!
W
Bro cj pls do a video about shadow the hedgehog
Cj u should make a “im not him” moments video
THE DRAGON EMPEROR HIMSELFFFF 🔥🔥🐉🐉🐉
What's fucking crazy is I saw a beyblade video a few days ago about the crazy shit they did in the show and I said to myself "damn CJ should do this man ryuga because he's true black airforce activity" AND HERE WE ARE
Damn a Beyblade video from CJ?
Intro still go crazy after not watching for 2 years
CJ DACHAMP Theres tokyo revengers season 2 and 3  I bet you cant make a black airforce video of it
It was always that serious in Beyblade
I was not familiar with how serious this beyblade shit is
This beyblade shit is serious  Never forget that 😂
I have never watched beyblade before but umm…         Wish I did tho
❤😂
Was good Cj, i have a request. Can we get a trail of record of raknarok, i beg of you.
I didn't think Beyblade would get on to this channel. Also, I'm still waiting for a Kenpachi video
Let's goooo, the goat talking about the goat of beyblade 🔥🔥🔥
Heeee’s back
Moses was rippin that Beyblade
Finally, the menace from our childhoods
This man is wild
4 min ago what a pleasant surprise
HE POSTED🥹
Ryuga pulling up at the world tournament for a fade, and then saying gingka better not lose to the temu bladders(star breaker), and then leaving?! Demon mentality
470 comments in 2 minutes is crazy 💀where y’all camping the channel
CJ showing love to the beyblade this my dog  can't wait till  dread Phoenixfrom beyblade burst turbo joins The roundhouse for breaking blabe
not him finally posting 🤩💀
Can you do Bakugan. Mostly Spectra, man was crazy!
Fun Fact, L-Drago was MADE for Ryuga, it just was used and stored with Negative Powers to becone Lightning L-Drago, but if it was with Ryuga from the Start, it would've been Meteor L-Drago
IVE BEEN WATCHING YOU ALL DAY. AND THEN I CHECK MY PHONE TO SEE IM 3 MINUTES LATE? AND ITS ON A PEEK CHARACTER
3000+ views in 4 mins damn cj definitely the goat
Cj
i knew it was fucking coming! father ryuga is here
Bout time I was bout to snitch to toei
I knew it! The akuma of beyblade - Ryuga!  I'm pretty sure he has more exhibits
Bruh Beyblade, Yugioh & Bakugan really was THAT SERIOUS!!! WE WERE JUST TOO YOUNG TO REALIZE.
RYUGA IS NOT A MENACE BRO HE IS A DEMON
Wtf how 508 comments in 4 minutes
finally
ryuga was an actual menace to society, the fact he only lost to the main protagonist and the final boss is incredible.
My nigga is the best my  friend
I literally was going to comment that you should do one on him me and my buddy were talking yesterday how he should cover him and he did let's go
Hey CJ if you could I think that Light Yagami would be perfect for either one of your trials
Blud looks like Ren from Bakugan Gundalian Invaders!
I still wonder why beyblade was this serious
OK OK
LETS GO! FUCKING LOVE RYUGA!
He walked so Gojo, and Sukuna could fight. He had Sukuna's personality and Gojo's iconic Hollow Purple.
Ryuga always stood on bidness
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THIS MAN GOD DAMN!!!😂
Oh yeahhhhhhhhh!
Finally the real goat!!!!!
RYUGA WAS DIABOLICAL 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
W
Been waiting for this vid since the first roundtable this shit gorgeous
BRO FINALLY DID A BEYBLADE EPISODE 🎉🎉
YO RYUGA? 💀
Bruh I dead ass downloaded Disney Now just to rewatch Beyblade. Burst also has some fire moments.
This was such a silly show so I never watched it but great video though CJ!
Plug
YUJIRO GOT 3RD?
Eh yo, I never would have guessed he would added him but I'm not complaining.
Ryuga The himblayder
You have no idea how happy seeing this thumbnail made me.  I have wanted you to take about the man, the myth, the legend for _years_ and I can safely say that you absolutely delivered.   Glad to see CJ understand that Ryuga isn't just worthy of being a member of the Black Air Force Roundtable, but it's chairman.   _and this is just season 1 too_
Lol
Not better than CJ though!!! 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🗣️🔥
I called it
CJ ALWAYS WITH THE W VIDEOS
What's even crazier about Hikaru is that she didn't just retire, she got PTSD. She fell over when she saw Ryuga in a later season.
ITS HEREEEEE
Beyblade is my childhood show and this brings back memories 😂😂😂
caught a 1 minute Cj drop on accident
HES BACK
Let it rip this is it get a grip
1.2k in 2 mins is crazy
I USED TO PRAY FOR TIMES LIKE THIS
Ryuga won all of his battles his only lost was in the final episode of first season, the battle against the god of destruction didnt count that nigga was cheating
What we been waiting for
BROOO RYUGA?? I HAVE HONESTLY BEEN EXPECTING THIS ONE
Ryuga was the first character I’ve seen that made chill ever time he was on screen He was a true menace
