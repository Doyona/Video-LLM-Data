checo has never been same after this
5:25 This is the only time I remember Checo really fighting Max for position, because whenever they were on the track he would let him pass easily or at the start when he had the opportunity to pass him he would just do it, it even seemed like he was forbidden to do so but this time he rebelled because he really believed he could fight for the championship.
2:18 : well, Max will live up to that statement the whole season
Una pena para el campeonato que los red bull tuvieran tanta superioridad...
Wow 2 years later red bull is losing it ,what  disgrace for a team that win 21 /22 races in 2023 ! Arrogance can destroy everything  !
Max broke checo’s entire career after this race.
First day of asymmetric braking...
Frenada asimétrica
After this race checo never came back
Buenas así da gusto sin rival y su pepino con gato encerrado pero la pena fue para Aston Martin Super vergüenza
Cuando redbull daba miedo
I think this was the race that “broke” checo
max is playing f1 on ps on easy mode was cold as f 🥶
Farrari car should be sold in scrap
Quem está assistindo em 2025? 😂
The race where Max broke Checo
I feel like this race was where it began to fall down bad for Perez... literally everything going not so well after this race
Is this the race that got Sergio Paris fired from Red Bull?
Maybe Perez wins in Miami Grand Prix in 2025
great to see alonso fought through without a teammate
brazil GP 2024 and this one shows what verstappen is made of! absolute champion material
The downfall of Checo started here
Aquí empezó la trampa de Red Bull al auto de Max con la frenada asimetrica
I would die if I experience the same G's as Verstappen
6:24 For the life of me I can't figure out where Leclerc is from! I mean these commentators should atleast mention once where he's from.
The race that broke Sergio Perez...
Vamos aos fatos: Checo chegou para Miami lutando pela liderança do campeonato. Nas 4 corridas anteriores 2 vitorias dele e duas do Max. Checo ainda ganhou a Sprint Race em Baku. Checo deu entrevistas dizendo que Max não era imbatível e que ele tinha sim chances no campeonato. Em Miami, Checo fez a pole e Max largou do meio do grid. Em 2022 quando Checo precisava de pontos pra ficar em segundo Max não evitou de ultrapassá-lo no Brasil. Enfim, a relação deles estava ruim e Checo estava intimidando Max na pista e fora dela. Bom, se você está disposto a intimidar uma lenda, você deve estar disposto também a enfrentar as consequências disso. Lembram da rivalidade Hamilton x Rosberg? Rosberg venceu, mas foi tão desgastante e difícil que nem quis correr mais. Lembram de Senna x Prost? E de Hamilton x Max em 2021? Tivemos batalhas, revides, mas ambos saíram moralmente fortes. Então, fãs do Checo (e eu também tenho simpatia pelo Mexicano), sinto informar, mas somente lendas podem intimidar lendas. Bons pilotos vão acabar humilhados caso ousem. Em Miami e após Miami Max destruiu a dignidade de Sergio Perez.
Excellent race, now the Band needs to "fix" the image quality in the live broadcast, it's a SHAME...
The difference of McLaren from 2023 to 2024 😮‍💨
P17
Miami 2024 should be much more exciting... 💤 😴
Foregone Conclusion.  Yawn. Max (in the best car) wins every race.  Yawn.
Who's watching this in 2024
rewatching this in advance of the 2024 miami GP, monster performance from max on this one i almost forgot about. an absolute insane drive to go from P9 to P1 and keep on the hards for 45 laps only to come out 1 second behind your teammate. Not to mention the beautiful overtakes on kmag and charles and the fight with checo. Love him or hate him, max can be a super entertaining driver to watch as long as he starts outside of the top 5
Que raro, con el mismo auto, sabemos q Checo se defiende excelente y como es q Verstappen lo lo paso fácil y le saco 5 seg al terminar la carrera, Verstappen es rápido pero no me creo q solo fue por su rapidez.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Verstappen has earned my respect. I watched this twice because of him.
Lewis Hamilton 🌈 🌈 🏳️‍🌈
The day a monster was born
I have some campus passes for sale
"The Bulls are going wheel to wheel" he really loves using that line
And people have the nerve to call Leclerc on par with Verstappen ,just look at how much he struggled against Magnussen !
I always come back just to see this masterpiece @ 0:48
It's nothing... It's the Car for Max is fitted for the best
0:54 THROUGH GOES VERSTAPPEN
I vote for a new "Max Verstappen rule" for F1, Max has to start EVERY race 20th.
e foi aqui que o Peres quebrou, teve uma otima corrida, mas o mental não aguentou a derrota pro proprio companheiro
Max overtaking perez,proves its him and not the redbull only
How do I watch the highlights if I always get a unskippable ad
Gp de Miami de f1 en marcha Max ganó 2 veces
This race will now be looked at as the moment bitter Max haters before start that were given him the finger for minutes upon minutes got POSTERIZED watching them in the 1st podium imagine giving him the finger before start just to sit all that time and watch him at the top podium
Took charles 30 laps to realize if he waited till the next drs zone to pass kmag would not have been a issue
Y aqui Max sentencio el mundial...
When you go back and watch all these F1 highlights every single car lets Max through without even a fight! I wonder if they will race that SOFT this season against the drink company with too much caffeine and chinese corn syrup!
A question for the English, does this race appear with the comments in Spanish or English?
Irritating commentator
my fav team is mercedes team
The race that broke checo
The race where the hopes on a close championship fight just turned to dust.
Hamilton
The RB19s finished 20 seconds ahead of the rest of the field. Such a dominant car
9th most watched 2023 highlights.
Fantastic performance by max to go from p10 on the grid to a win!! Definitely a well worth Miami Grand Prix!!
F1 su+++ as redbull is favouring max put soft tyres on checcos car😢😢😢😢😢
Kalau tidak ada perubahan modifikasi body..... ferrari akan selalu jauh tertinggal sama team2 papan atas lainnya 😫
"But he will fight back another day" Yes but actually no
Max Verstappen is unbelievable
Looking back this was the day, the title was decided.
the drs gap is way smaller now than at the time of this race
sa
balapan f1
Im so happy redbull won since both of them got 1st and 2nd
Checo no skill perez
Max and Alonso👍👍
TF is happening with this channel, am I the only one that can not watch the highlights videos in here?
the race that won max the championship
🤯🤯🤯
Ver is just undefeatable oml
the beginning of maxs 10 win streak
4 months later, and this is the moment that broke checo
Uduri
Alfa, merz, Renault just cannot take ferrari down from F1 which indirectly explain why ferrari engine is the best and price so steep.... Against all the top engine, feerari stand up against mclaren
F1 is the rivalry BTW ferrari and mclaren..... Just like arsenal vs man utd
Max Verstappen 🏁👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Magnussen in a Redbull would be spicy.
Dutch commentary is making my ears bleed
This is the race where Checo thought he would win and take the first place in the overall standing. But it was Max who won from 9th place and after this race never looked back and won everything
"Perez, who had no answer to his teammate. But he will fight back another day" hahahaha as if thats ever going to happen
Even Max Verstpn start at P20 he will be the winner of the race.Such a nonsense F1 became everything is already decided.
top race, irritant commentaar.
Here it all began... 9 wins in a row soon...
anyone else here after the belgian presser? this was a mega drive by max. in 10 laps he put 5 seconds on his teammate in the same car... and they had 20-25 seconds on the AM, not much has changed for the bulls. as a newer fan really wild to see this dominance( started watching last year not a DTS guy netflix stinks podcast rule.) danny ric was on YMH last US gp maybe he will return
La carrera que le jodieron a checo!! Porque no largo con gomas duras?
tenenkrommend slecht commentaar
It’s too easy for Red Bill
KAEBARKKENRINMENFAFAI😅😊❤
how is max always winning from 9th place to first wow genius driver with monster car?
Ya Ferrari yano es primero desde que manejaba como chumajer relbu notiene rribal hese carro de detener subentaja noay carro que legane arelbu Ferrari ya paso laistoria sólo hay un carro para ver relbun heso notiene rribal para que asen heso
👏👏👏🪅🪅🪅🪅🪅
I hate verstapen
Can someone explain what drs
Congratulations 😊😄
this race may have been the mind breaker for checo....
This is historically gonna be the race that broke Checo. Emotionally. Mentally. Spiritually. As a race driver.
Two months later and Checo hasn't reached Q2 since. This is the race that showed him he doesnt belong in the Red Bull and that he should go back to a bench warmer team. He never recovered mentally from the humiliation.
British commentators are so biased towards verstappen
Gran carrera checo, lastima que no pudieras concretar la victoria. Saludos Desde Panamá.
This race will now be looked at as the moment Max broke Checo.

The most boring race of all time minimal overtakes terrible track and a win by about 15 years. almost fell asleep watching this the cars need to be the same and smaller because id rather watch paint dry than watch the same person win 7 times in a row again i mean its millions of dollars can't you make it exiting and free to watch you must get no advertising money. 1. make it free to watch. 2. make the cars smaller and all the same. 2 watch wec hypercar its just better. so there
S
My Request For The Next Race :  1. LECLERC  2. SAINZ  3. ALONSO  4. STROLL  5. MAGNUSSEN  6. BOTTAS  7. OCON  8. DE VRIES  9. GASLY  10. ZHOU
I also like helio castroneves.
El equipo de Perez se apuró mucho en cambiar los neumaticos, los dos con gomas nuevas lo más probable que Perez le gana al pedante de Max.
IT SHOULD BE 3 CARS PER TEAM
cooooooool
Dutch master and Red Bull smoked Leclerc on Ferrari and Kmag on Haas 🔥🙌
Pitstop ❤
So lame watching Verstappen car run circles around the rest of the field. He’s not that much better than all the other top racers. It’s so fixed so Hamilton can’t win 8th championship.
que corrida é  essa que os retardatários tem que  praticamente parar o carro eles também  estão  disputando antes não  era assim acaba logo essa porcaria eu éra  fã  e  o segundo segundo piloto tem que priorizar o primeiro acabou a emoção
A fórmula 1 é 10
Pathétique formule 1 !!!
Carro do max muito rápido....parece q tem algo q outros nao tem....
Verstappen 🥇
supermaxmaxsupersuper will win the championship, that Redbull car is even more ahead of the others than last year.
Hi
Ferary no gd👎
Bring back Crofty for these race highlights. This has F1 sim commentary vibes and has done all year.
20:00 + seconds clear of the rest of the field??? How are all other teams building such slower cars???
I love Miami Grand Prix.
Leclerc got bullied 🤣
Je veux voir Fernado Alonso conduire le Red Bull, il battra des records à coup sûr
Though I like Checo,  One must admit Max better than all F1 drivers.
Parece um monte de carrinho de controle remoto, graça nenhuma
😊
I just love it when max haters whine and cry 😂
F1 is Fixed
Put David Croft back in F1 commentator please 🙏🏼
Perfect face
The Miami F1 track impressed me.  Well designed and built/ modified.  I thought it was going to be one of those half-as% cobbled together 'street' courses that appear sometimes.  --Like I think Las Vegas? was or Long Beach?  --My memory's fuzzy on them, being unmemorable unsatisfactory temp tracks.   But well done Miami F1 !  I look forward to more.   And yay Max and Checo!  KMag did well today.
The red bull cars have got to have some secret cheating going on or something. They blow past everything like they have an extra 100hp and more downforce
Absolute Masterclass
I don't find it fun anymore in Formula one Max car can crush everyone on the track
I was a fan of Miami already last year I think it fits this new gen of cars great, despite that tight little S chicane section before the long back straight that has to somehow be dealt with and it could be a banger of a race every year. I'm very skeptical of Las Vegas, the track layout seems boring with top speed being the biggest advantage..it literally looks it's just going to be a flat out shoot out with a few low speed corners before massive straights..don't agree with it being the penultimate race I think Brazil should always either be the LAST race or atleast penultimate at minimum. Okay now onto the main takeaway from this season so far, Alonso has now shown consistently what that Aston is capable of and again Stroll is nowhere near Alonso, yes I get he's a 2 time champ but an aging champ at that yes he's performing great at his age but he's nowhere near his peak and Stroll is nowhere near him, it's just awful to see that he's holding a seat that will never give anyone else the opportunity to show they could prob thrive. As long as Lawrence owns most stake in Aston F1 Lance will never have to worry about his seat like everyone else on the grid and it shows he doesn't have that fire under him to perform it's just "Yeah, we got some bad luck today..Yeah it's fine" I'm sick of the lack luster demeanor "yeah" he has no personality whatsoever
tons of parity.
Ferari gak ada lagi wibawa nya, sama tim gurem aja keok dan mudah sekali di salip
Max and Perez are both so hungry!! Hamilton days are over...
There is no doubt RedBull has the better car, but this race just shows how Max drives it better. Perez vs Verstappen debate is finally over. Verstappen for the another World Champion 2023.
Who was it that made a complete fustercluck of waving the chequered flag?
2:16 Summarize this season 😢
There should be a sprint for spa
Die hard F1 fan for 20 years, understand being defensive about F1 but I’ve got to the point this season where you can see there’s no strategy, racecraft or even weather in any of the new tracks, when it is (because of no refuelling pits for plain tracks like these) are we gonna have any rogue changes in desert gp’s to do with the already limited tyres
CH643 星期三深夜 2:55
MaxXXXxxx & PerezZzzzz 🎉🎉🎉
Back on this track!! --fan.from.the.philippines
7u
What happened to Crofty? Why isn't his commentary featured on the official F1 socials anymore?
I will support Perez. Go Perez go.
I think Red Bull do not play fair at all, Max is a bully and doesn't drive clean at all, Chris Horner is a poor loser, takes no responsibility for anything, wins by doing shady stuff, when losing he tried to blame every other team for cheating meanwhile he did cheat and continues to cheat but plays the victim. He is a poor example of a loser and winner...if you can call him a winner when you don't play fair.  he also gossips and whines too much on Netflix F!...he should have no time on the show for season 6. ..yup I said it all and stand by it.
0:43 Imagine NTT IndyCar Series in Miami Gardens, Fla
America. The land of transgender everything.
Max is on another planet… if Red Bull can keep the performance like this I don’t see how max doesn’t break Lewis’ record
F1 has become so boring for me over the last two years all I do now is skip through these highlights every few weeks. I've finally given up.
I'm very proud of  Alonso making sure he gets a podium.
Is really Lewis Hamilton obsolete?
I miss Crofty
Max verstappen komt toch  Op het podium.  ❤"😂"🎉"😢"😮"😅"😊"
Crofty's please
To all the fans that listened to the blatant lie of Sky Sports saying during the broadcast that Checo did not get any race updates on the radio and Max did:  Check the full onboard radios (that are on youtube) and realize that it was all a LIE just to discredit Verstappen. Checo had ALL the info he needed.
Kinda miss Crofty's lights out spiel. Anyone care to explain why they are no longer the main commentaries for F1?
Sheesh
Yup
I WISH THAT VERSTAPPEN LETS CHECO WIN HIS FIRST CHAMPIONSHIP. LIKE PEREZ HELPED HIM TO WIN HIS FIRST CHAMPIONSHIP.
Am i the only one that's bored of seeing the same driver win?  I used to love F1. 2021 was awesome.  But watching the same driver win every race is Yawn,  Yawn, Yawn! Does it matter who claims 2nd or 3rd in the championship? I guess it does. Yawn .
Pre Miami GP : everyone roasts the venue  , Post Miami GP : what an awesome race ! hahaha
Great
Max with the fastest car just beat the other fastest car on track (which also started from P1) starting from P9. If that is not a statement that he is the best driver on the grid at the moment, I don't know what is. I see Lewis, Alonso and Lando doing the same given the same car but I doubt they can match Max's sheer aggression at this point. The man hit P2 in 15 laps lol
What happen to "lights out and away we go"?
Why isnt Hamilton winning now?
The red bull is so OP wow😂
sou do estado de são Paulo queria muito ver uma corrida dessa Al vivo
meu sonho e ver de perto um corrida dessa
the comments section looks sterile
This video should be titled: Verstappen overtakes everyone while Alonso watches TV
25 seg de RedBull sobre los demas en la parrilla es un cohete alo que tienen los demás
Ì
Posta em português br, narração da band é incrível
Super max🎉🎉🎉
If Ferrari wants to be winners again, they need to bring  Checo Perez in...!
fernando alonso the legend 🎉
Max always no 1 although start from behind😅😅😅😅
Anyone else not enjoying the commentary on this one?? Sounded like a never ending screech.
Hum
Alonso what a pilot can imagine if he had an red bull
Commentators are so disrespectful basically congratulating more the car on winning not one of the best young talents this sport has seen in it's whole history. Max beats Hamilton in the same car, I've always known this. Mercedes finally isn't' the best car for a like 6 years in a row and people now trying to pretend like Max is only winning because of the car lol. His results when redbull couldn't touch the Mercs was always a testament that all he needs is a proper set-up. F1 NEVER been just about the driver, it's ENGINEERING + Human driving, a teamsport. Max is pretty much the peak of driving skill atm and even when redbull wasn't fast, and now the engineering has caught up he is unstoppable.
Terrible presentator but Kalff ok 🙄
Max is very fast!😊
max owning them all! haters gone hate and i love it!
A next-level car paired with a next-level driver.
I Can't see this Ferrari that fight with Haas and not win. Where is the true Ferrari?
I want to try to get into F1, and this is the first time watching anything related to it. Can anyone explain why Verstappen and Perez were competing against each other even though they are on the same team?
Is it funny when Lewis Hamilton was winning every race he was very happy now the red bulls are winning he is complaining
Dear Formula 1, full race please
They should let us hear the cars more & lower the voices
Honda RB and Max once again proved himself to be a formidable force to be reckoned with at any start position kudos to him! I'm a NA V12 and V10 Bull Lambo myself!
È uno spettacolo indecoroso vedere una Formula uno cosi.... Red bull che fa' quello che gli pare.. Evade tranquillamente il  badget Cup, e di conseguenza ha una macchina che è in assoluto inarrivabile, e nessuno degli altri Tim ha il coraggio di farsi sentire e andarsi a lamentare. Vedere una formula uno cosi, fa' solo passare la voglia di continuare a vederla, e comprare i biglietti per andare a vederla!!  Un disastro totale!!! 😢😢
waarom dit slecht nederlands commentaar op deze video waar is de originele engels talig comentaar ?
Big up max for the well done work
how do you find the finish flag people?
Lotus?
🥱
First race highlight I’ve watched this season. Cars look like boats.
Pourquoi HAMILTON ne  finit   plus  premier
A ferrado esta uma merda esse ano.  Tomando baile de uma Aston martin e de uma Haas.. 😢😢
Checo debe saber que en carrera nunca va a pasar a Max por qué Max no deja esos espacios
I Watch everything and all races

We need Crofty commentary for these!
Where is piastri?😊
🔴Ferrari No.1 always
Still Max every race... unbeliveable dominated
Boring
Man, F1 is becoming a real snorefest.
🏎🏎🏎
Pra mim a Red Bull está claramente sabotando a potência de Peres para favorecer o verstapen jamais o verstapen ia conseguir tirar tantos tempo encima do Peres ainda mais com os pneus gastos só tem uma explicação a Red Bull cortou a potência do Peres.
Redbull gave me wings today I slept very late last night, and now watching this, great race
Great job Alonso !! The race was nice, everything else not so much
Zzzzz
Maxs car is unstoppable crazy fast
most impressive win since Senna.
Wat een slechte commentatoren…
the more boring redbull winning in future
Great that Max won that race the Miami Beaches are amazing and that weather out the field was amazing great win Max! You go you Dutch🇳🇱
boring
TIGHT RACE THERE
Lol Verstappen appears to be racing against 9 yo
Es  horrible en español, no me intersa verlo asi.  Siempre tengo que ir a verlo a otro sitio. Y dejo un no me gusta por forzarme a verlo como no quiero verlo.
😊Jhjvig
Hhhhhhuhjhhijijiukh9h
Guys can we just appreciate how FREAKIN' FAST the cars look this year zoomin' around the track compared to last year, (and even 2020/2021 since they were bigger and blockier), I'm kinda getting 2010/2013 vibes with how fast they looked on the circuits
Does the broadcaster even know what he’s reporting? Referring to miles per hour, when it clearly shows km/h.
Its clear that F1 is not a sport, there are other interests in play. Sad
1-2 DE RESPEITO DE VERSTAPPEN & PÉREZ! 🥇🥈🤝
Vreselijk commentaar 😢
Señores de la FIA, sino aclaran porque EN LA TELEMETRIA, el monoplaza de VERSTAPEN andaba 10 km//h mas en recta y el motor 300 RPM  mas que el monoplaza de Perez,  ESTO ES UNA VERGUENZA PARA la f1 y EL DEPORTE
Verstappen is a BEAST
Aston Martin is popping off this season jesus
Redbull gave Checo a different car, now they saying that the different was on the strategy of the tires. But the  telemetry shows something different.  Man Redbull is just a NASTY TEAM. They are just damaging this sport .
viva mexico cabrones!!!!!!!!!!checo should have been first
I just really don't like this guy
Ahh I really miss Sebastian vettel 😔
Unfortunately, there weren't really any highlights in Miami, unless it's these boring commentators.
If Alonso was driving one of them redbulls, the speed of light would be renamed to the speed of Alonso.
Kiko Perez tomou pau lindo...😂😂😂😂
Red Bull win 2023 already ! Boring! 😮‍💨
I think Max is almost unstoppable at the moment
Where is the english commentator? 😢
boring race but great sport
Yes, I agree that Verstappen and Perez are great drivers, but the difference in cars, particularly this year, is huge. I think that F1 would be much more entertaining if the FIA did something to make the cars more even in ability, as it would produce closer, more entertaining and more thrilling races. I also, think this would gain more followers for the sport.
😢how did perez lose this
What a humiliated defeat checo😂😂😂
F1 is really boring... the same people always win. overtaking is only on the long straight of the track. if you have the money you win, if you don't you drive around the track
Alonso making the move to Aston Martin is paying dividends, enjoying seeing him on the podium consistently!
Bit boring seeing one car miles faster than all the others, F1 need to sort this out.
Those red bull are so advanced, max doing 45 laps on hard is insane
Max was an absolute beast!! He was Like a Charging Bull
Ben ik de enige met Nederlands commentaar 😅😅
It is obvious Red Bull has got eyes for  1 driver, that's Max,Checo doesn't have the RB19 that had  last week in Azerbaiyán. We are clear on that.
get rid of viaplay   NOW! or we need olav moll back!!!! TREKT HELEMAAL NERGENS OP WAT THE FOK  SLECHTE STEM DONDER OP MAN FIGUUR. KUYT VIAPLAY  PLEE PLEE PLEE PLEE WEGWEZEN MET JULLIE TROEP
Please put Crofty back on commentary this commentator is just annoying
gold old days where ıs engıne sound ? :(
Super Max  10/10
Where is the engine sound?
BORING
Man its just the same as the Merc dominance was. No point watching this sport anymore. Let me know when we have actual battles for the wins.
When Redbull don't want Perez to finish in front of Max, they do everything in their power to ensure Max finish in P1. Great race for Alonso!
its kinda sad to see lewis getting team orders
I need “LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO!!” Nothing else hits the same.
F1 become boring since the days of hakkinen coultard shumacher now its 1 man ride no competition
With Lewis Hamilton losing podiums nearly all the time he may as well move to Aston Martin next season
I'm a Hamilton fan!! But I'm Not an !d!ot  CHECO HAS A DIFFERENT CAR  THAN  M A X !!  NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LAST CAR  WHEN HE WON FEW WEEKS AGO!!  THE TELEMETRY WAS WAY WAY DIFFERENT!! I HOPE RED BULL SH!+ GET CAUGHT  SOON!!!  IS DISGUSTING DOING it  OVER & OVER TO Their 2nd DRIVERS!! Just to Make  MAX LOOK LIKE THE MESSIAH OF F1... 🙏👌
Love it…
since when and why do we have the new commentator in F1? i liked the old one better ..
TODA AMERICA CON MAX CAMPEON DEL MUNDO❤
5 races all won by RedBull. It's just astounding that F1 still attracts huge crowds with such little competition for RedBull even with no rivalry between Checo and Max.
David Croft?!
how much of Max's performance down to the car? relative to his non-teammates?
Excelente resumen, pa que querés ver toda la carrera completa jajajaja
I miss the 'and it's lights out and away we go'
Max-terclass drive from Max. Well done mate. Absolutely loved it!
Is the Hamilton reign over or will he come back?
Y la version en ingles?!
Dutch version
Verstappen jouer seulement
That comment!!!! “Treating it like the F1 game on the PlayStation” 😂😂😂😂😂
Ferrari uses  bedford engine this days 😂
whats with the commentating on these highlights, where is crofty
Please, for spanish people we need Antonio Lobato’s voice
Bonjour, on en parle des commentateurs de cette vidéo? on vibre, on est dans le baquet... On sent l'énergie de la course...
Benz team is sinking?
Someone tell the camera guy that in the US you shoot video at 60fps instead of 50 .
This is a new commentator who has no clue whatsoever..this guy needs to be sacked on the spot......there are plenty of disabled commentators who are miles better than this disaster who should be given a job as commentator.....  what a mess...
Super Max😮😮😮😮
Ф1 розчаровує! Скільки грошей, скільки реформ. В осаді: потворні машини, дорого, немає боротьби за лідерство. Я ставлю 👎🏻
The race is very boring 💤
"It's lights out and away we go", I miss that.
F1 skysport is creating another fairy fake story about Checo not getting some information about the race... Those haters really are making this sport a clownfest.
The one who's waving the finishflag is not qualified for the job..... That's not waving....
Mclaren in quickly becoming a mediocre team like mentally, in the peoples consciousness. young people just dont have memories with mclaren being great. it's really sad. hope they don't go on the williams path.
Please bring back our usual commentators (David Croft ) please.......
Hamilton wins. British commentators: Great driving Lewis! What a skill! Max wins. British commentators: That car is phenomenal! Look at this rocket ship!
Why 50 fps? lol
Go go go Alonso....
Ferrari like underdog tim 😅
Max Vestarp o nosso tri campeao 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Never thought I'd say it, I want crofty back
This race was amazing live
What's hapenned with ferrari?
Super Max a lenda
Another red bull 1-2 yawnnn man total snooze fests
Alonso again top 3
Please add manufacturer points total to the end of the highlights.thank you
Blessings, John 3:16.  Jesus loves you.
Love this for Alanso
Ferari lemoooottttttt mobil paling ga stabil,drivernya memble
The only capable to beat max will be Hamilton and George after Imola
Another VER-PER-ALO in the books!
apa... me gusta que el resumen esté en español latino :D
👍🏾 REDBULL BABY❗️😎
MoooooD MAAAAX❗️👊🏾💥🔥👍🏾 CHECO better continue doing this ALL season and end up BEATING MAAAD MAX❗️👊🏾💥 redBULL BABY❗️😎
When Max did not have an accident at the start, I already knew then that the intrigue is over ))
why do i get the commentaries by a duo that doesn't know anything of F1 ??? this is terrible to watch and hear ...
Pongan los comentarios de f1 movistar de españa
🌝🍿Race Lap Congratulations On Win 🏆
Hammer Podium!!!! ich freue mich auch so für Alonso diese Saison
Wheres Crofty
Commentateur à bannir d'urgence...
We're getting sick of this wally winning.
At the end of the day Formula 1 is boring these days. Period.
Sandbagging “Redbull”
Well all had enough of Mercedes, now îs even worse, nobody stand a chance against Red Bull, Gj F1 regulation changes destroys completly this sport.
Hey! Where Yuki? Lap 51 overtaking!
Highlights? Most could predict the result. Such a shame f1 is where it is. Glad i wached senna, prost, Schumacher etc in the right era of the sport. Sad for new commers
Anyone else wishing Hamilton would crash!!!!!
Another deadly dull procession...  F1 seems on its last legs
Why do they no longer use Crofty as the voiceover for the Race Highlights? I much prefer his energy.
This year commentators are horrible.....🤐🤐🤐
MAX IS SO GREAT ❤ SENDING LOVE FROM THE UK 🇬🇧 WE HOPE YOU WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP AGAIN
I don't like the new voice, last year much better
@formula1 please bring back skysports casters....way way better
Best f1 race this season! 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
I didn't realise there was a highlights reel for this race!
Current tyres are a problem, there's no longer strategies since you can go with hard component and do fastest laps with 50 laps
Were is " Lights Out And Away We Go "
When you have Ferrari's "best" in a pitched battle with Haas....you know something is SERIOUSLY wrong at Ferrari.
Shame champion 2021🤣🤣🤣🤣 .... he's power full cause redbull machine not by skill like hamilton
BORING
Most boring 'racing' I've ever seen
07:13 most hesitant checkered flag ever, Verstappen wouldn`t even have seen it. My guess is some sponsors 5-year old assisted by his/her parent.
I think these absurd high ticket prices are a disgrace … so called “celebrities” ( none of them really interested in racing ) are getting free access, while true fans have to pay a fortune … maybe we should stop attending these races
87k likes and 4.2k dislikes on this video
they found 8 minutes 💀
uma corrida bem esquecível..
Red Bull 1-2 again bro when they gonna stop?
Now no fun watch f1. From last year only one person win. Even from being the grid. Is max 😂😂😂😂 no race or fight 🥱🥱🥱🥱
Red bull have full support to max more then Perez 😂😂. After all he’s red bull no 1 driver 😂😂😂
the voice is different. i dont love it.
That Redbull car is making the sport uncompetitive and dull, sadly.
"It's race on" 🤓 Bring the old commentator back
Alonso and Aston Martin are like f1 career mode in S3
Love seeing Alpine and Aston in the points.  Haas getting some.  Max is just the best driver at this point and in the best car.  A guy who doesn't have to start on the pole to dominate the field.  Very exciting to watch.
There are not even running flat out they are sand bagging
Gran Prix racing is now unwatchable it's so obvious who will be number 1 again boring
Boring
Checo Supporters in Baku: Checo Beat Max in Equal Machinery !!!!! Checo Supporters in Miami : RB gave Max get a better car !!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
why is charles leclerc so bad at the moment he looks like hes given up
Another great success for the poor loser from Montecarlo 😂
Max ma boyyy. What a drive!
What happened to crofty…..😢
Go Max 🔥
Alonso ❤❤❤
What is Ferrari doing? Too weak.
What's the point of this ,you have  guy with car much faster than the others, ridiculous
❤❤❤❤❤
Hamilton is done  for life 😂😂😂😂😂😂
yawnfest
F1 is such a borefest
I do kind of wish they would have a version with crofty for the highlights
As corridas não estão como nós 2 anos atrás, mais disputa perdeu a graça um pouco parece só a res Bull tem o controle da velocidade a cima.
boring
where is croft?
Max passing 3 wide reminds me of Senna doing the same on a qualifying lap. Can't remember the track
What's happen tô logan Sargeant
If shouting boo for Max by Latino's isn't racist, then booing Hamilton isnt racist either.
Any one going to comment on the different commentary
i dont think perez can hold max off
DRS has to go its making a farce out of this , its not racing if youre suddenly given an artificial advantage.. without  DRS Max may have never gotten past Checo.
Lets goooooooo max verstappen amazing car liverya db helmet livery
Ferrari tak ada guna la
Its almost as if max is driving a different car
Even the highlights were boring
Miami out One of the most emotionless tracks of the season.
F1 I have a single problem😐 Make that finish flag shaking how is worth for that driver... Please😑❤❤❤
Turu 😴
It’s easy you’ve got the fastest car 😂
5:25
The best driver won 👍🏻🐐
Max is gewoon de beste
Suiiiiiiiiiii😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀💀
Verstappen's magnificent race, perfect strategy and a fantastic defense of Fernando Alonso's position. Come on Fernando.  Magnífica carrera de Verstappen, estrategia perfecta y una defensa de la posición de Fernando Alonso fantástica. Vamos Fernando.
This really wasn't as dull as everyone said it was gonna be
Horrible to have the highlights in french, wow. I dont know how this happen
What strikes me is Redbull could of pitted Perez for soft tyres and gone for fastest lap as they have done often with Max.
Red bull is beyond everyone as was Mercedes before
It feels we can guess who is the world champion for this year. Not a competitive year again.
Max will be very difficult to beat this year. It will take divine intervention at this rate.
Mr. Max is flying.
If you delete all the parts with red bull, the race was nice to watch. When I saw Verstappen overtaking in easy mode I was totally bored. There isn't a race, the isn't a show. Pretty awful weekend.
Qué mal me cae Verstappen
I thought sainz gonna say he dont deserve the penalty again🤣
アロンソのポディウムが嬉しい！
I think driver of the day should have gone to the person editing this video and getting 8 minutes of highlights from this race.
It's funny, but I could have sworn that Russell passed Hamilton during this race.. Mustn't have happened as that would have been an important point in the proceedings.... wouldn't it?
The Vegas race in November should be amazing!!
My team Mercedes, please what happened????
Please, stop replacing my english best-of by that belgian frenchy video :(
Max simply the best. For all his haters: Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.
🤞🏻alanso and perez battle this year….Max showed why he will be 3e time 🍾
where's crofty? did he retire or something?
F1, please change the commentator. I beg you
it is a comedy. why dont you give him the title right now? RedBull-Verstappen and F1 must be cheating, it is not normal he has fastest laps on 40 laps old tyres. We dont need all the grand prixes, when it has all been bought by RedBull for Verstappen in 2020 (when they robbed Lewis in last race) and the goal is to have Verstappen and Redbull with at least 4 or 5 titles in order to get recognized the era when Liberty Media took over F1. In Checo's position, I would try to get to another team, as here he will never be a world champion.
Bef race Max mentioned "winning is not impossible" then proved it.
Boring
Il circuito piu bello in tutto del mondiale!!!
Where is Crofty and Brundle?
Hanya Redbul yg bisa meghentikan Redbul itu sendiri😥😮
I love how excited the commentators get.... even though the result is totally predictable   :o)
its so discusting to watch now a days f1 full of cheats! This is same as consol players with aim asist  pmsl! No real batles no more, nathing to do with drivers skills - there  is non left! All to do with extra gains and jumps whit legal cheats... Its all about to make show, not to show the skills and real race! All become ruled by the money! No more race, only the scripted show for the wievers (stpd wievers)
Honda is the winner not that idiot
Kmag kept a Ferrari behind in a Haas for 37 laps. Incredible stuff from the Viking
Max can start from 20th position and can win🤗. Ferrari can start from pole and still can end up without points 😜.  Ferrari's expected to compete with merc and bulls. But, they are struggling to compete with haas😂.LOL. Declare Max and Red bulls as champions. No need to race 😜
The new rules have failed. They have to do Red Bull like they did to Ferrari in 2005. Bring in a rule to stop them, otherwise it’s 5 years of afternoon naps
Verstappen is in the zone right now, so nice to see!
Impressive perfromance by Verstappen!
Alonso out drove verstappen all day - the only reason vercrashappen gets any where is because of the personalised car not his driving prowess
i HATE this new commentator
At this point F1 is a waste of resources.
max  Devil of the behind the wheel.44 laps going without change tyre.wow.first pistop 45 lap
Last race Max could not reduce 0.5 seg, here it reduces a 20 sec gap, cmon ita pure logic, it was a different car, period.
Wow! Spanish commentary?
Max is simply incredible.hes like a computer programme strategy and patient. When he start he was stay out of trouble stay behind attack one by one.hes the man cannot beat in this F1.perez had new tyre and max had 42 old lap tyre but he still going fastest lap of the race.max is max he's super max greatest max no doubt
F1 has a few real fans, the people saying this race was boring aren't one of them..
This is why I don't watch F1 as much as I used to. This has become a procession of the Redbulls just like it was a procession of the Mercs a few years ago.   Just like when Hamilton was at Merc, you know Max is going to win unless he retires because his car is some much better than the rest
Saben dónde están los comentaristas que hablaban en ingles
What happened to it's lights on and away we go
we need Crofty
You can say what you want, Max is better than Sergio.
"It's lights out and away we go!" I miss that line as the race starts.
LOL I guess if you ignore the redbulls its a very competitive season we are having
FERRARI MANAGEMENT FIRE THE WHOLE TEAM AND DRIVERS!! I AM A FERRARI FAN AND I HAVE NEVER SEEM SUCH A BAD OVERALL PERFORMANCE IT IS A PITTY FOR THE HISTORY OF THE TEAM!!
Where is lights out and away we go?
I would fire leclerc he cannot even pass mangnusen
DRS overtakes are boring af.
Lets go Alonso for championship podium!!
What a boring Race. F1 is boring again as every race is won by Max vestrappen
Just checking Max haters how they cry...
Porque no dejan de ganar a Hamilton??????
Glad there was a lot of action in this Miami GP and also a clean race
Crofty please
F1 is so boring now
Watching the race highlights this year I have realized I need to learn more languages
Bored.. it's just a power of RedBull.. nothing special 🤣🤣🤣
I don't get at all they didn't show Tsunoda's race... It was incredible race he did.
crofty and martin brundle are the best announcers for f1 i absolutely hate alex jakes, sorry.
Super Max! Can we now stop the Checo hype.  The only way Perez competes for the championship is if Max has multiple DNFs.
At this point even if red bull didn’t have drs they would still win all the races
Hamilton should retire his time is over
Gracias por los comentarios en español
What's the point of having DRS on a slow car🤣
I feel like Piastri might be regretting snubbing Alpine and going to McLaren…
Kmag scuffling with leclerc was super entertaining. Really showing how well he could do if only he had the equipment
K-Mag overtakes Leclerc while while being overtaken by Verstappen
How can be Ferrari so fast in qualy and so slow in race
VER PER ALO is getting comfortable
Zzz Zzz Zzz 🥱
I'd say highlight of the race was when Alonso asked what position Stroll was 😂
Kevin Magnussen to the Red Pranching Horse
Jkkkkg😅
Checo had pole position, Free/clean air, no dealing with backmarkers + a faster pits top by 0.9 vs Max and still loosing. Anyways this race is for all the Checolovers to stop talkin all the insanity and bs.  Well done Max 👍
So wanted Checo to win that one or Kevin
is it the car or driver that makes verstappen great?
Checo vs Red Bull .  Checo vs Max
"NOT AGAIN" 💀
The boy is born and raised to race. Extremely talented.   You know who i mean.
cade a desgraça dos highlights da transmissão brasileira
How come they didn't show Alonso commenting the Stroll overtake he saw on TV? That was the highlight of the season!
Nyck de mazepin
Ormai è più interessante guardare una partita di scacchi
It looks so easy for Redbull to take over every car in front of them. This season, no challenge. Just end the season and move to the next season. Give more time for other cars to improve better. So boring to watch just like Mercedes been dominant for the past few years ago. I'm waiting for Mercedes and Ferrairi to comeback this season and have a better competition but not yet I guess.
Hate or love him, but Max is an F1 beast
Lot of crying about red bull in the comments like F1 isn't supposed to be building a super fast car to the spec.
Great racing at a very lack luster track (parking lot). Kmag racing a Ferrari and Red Bull is probably the highlight of the year so far for me, wish it had happened at a more memorable track though.
Its so easy for honda to get ferarri
tbh we gotta appreciate max because this is greatness! at least in vettel RB era, he gave people a chance to think they stood a chance but max, when he is pushed against the wall, he dominates!
No sc no crash nothing p9 wins the race p1 finish p2 that tell you all about the teams bad strategies. They wanted max to win because checo is the only true driver that can defeat the champion checo made...twice at the end of the year max wins again. Max says I don't need checo to win we know what happened sabotage Perez
Was Perez told to keep to a lap time right from the start? Just watching the replay and it seemed he was holding steady for a very long time. I'd have thought they'd want to open a pit stop gap. Its pretty obvious they told Sergio to back up the field.
"Sergio, this is James"
Perez should have pushed harder on Max. And Gasly is too scared to fight Max, but isn't afraid to fight Russel smh
I know I cannot be the only one who slept the majority of the race.
A great race.. still 70 percent car and 30 percent driver compared to staright 50/50 in Indy. Just a non bias factoid. I like this track, and the venue, top marks.
outstanding bull sugar again 💤
Unbelievably boring race
boring
Driver eye view 😍🔥🔥
Miami is fun
the three red bulls you have first three places this time too...
For me this year champion will be the driver who gets the 3rd place. RBs are in separate league
The Red Bulls are incredibly quick this year, much better than the rest of the field.  Almost as if they spent more money designing their car than the other teams did. Almost.
max super max
I want all the Lewis fans that are shoving Max at every oppertunity to look at Lewis his 2011 season, his 5th season in F1 and then watch his 2012 season compilations. It is like watching Max Verstappen during his reckless years, and I loved Lewis for it, and I'm forever a die hard fan of both. There are so so many similarities between the 2 and other F1 legends.  Try to see the positive and enjoy the beauty of the sport, the 'its the car' and 'oh they cheat' have been yelled at every champion, every winner and at every possible controversy there have been. There is so much hate, venom and disgust in every F1 comment section since YouTube exists, we just dont need to be football hooligans about it. <3
It's not the same, people with racing passion, would recognize a "World Champion"  common guys can't $
in turn 1
I was there
How was Max able to change tires before the race when he didnt qualify outside the top 10?
Flying Dutchman.
Nunca dejan escuchar los autos, ni los  radios ni nada se la pasan hable y hable y hable y  hable! 😔😡
en el minuto 3:04 porque las personas que están ahí no se hacen a un lado   es para que no salga rápido el carro???
I am sure that Lewis is coming back strong. I know Checo will be the world champion and Sainz will be right behind. Vamos!
sainz: plz plz plz this 5 sec penalty totally worth it😂
This was actually a decent race
Over power car
I think the Redbulls are employing something else besides the DRS to outpace their rivals. It has to do with the downforce they generate under the car, which they do whilst at the same time having a rear wing which isn't as draggy as their rivals.  The FIA must know what's going on, but as we already know after the flexi floor debarcle, the FIA will let these shenanigans go until they are asked the right questions. There should be a cam under the car, trained on the Venturi tunnels.
que bien que ya pusieron el audio en español❤
Listening to F1 without Brundle and Crofty is just yuck.  If I lost those two I don't know if I would be able to keep watching, I'm really not a fan of the F1TV commentators.
Not quite master class. passed 8 cars. So  entertaining. LoL
Actually only passed 9? Not quite all of them though
Max have another car….
CHECOOOOO 🇲🇽❤️
Where are the king of the streets fans now 😂😂
This is sooo booooring!!!! MotoGP is way better.
I must say that the wHOLE commentators of SKY Sports are just commenting non-sense....  They are all AFRAID to say the TRUTH...... Jonny Herbert did that and he was put away and sidelined....  The other collectives, including David Courthard had joined the paid bandwagon of sycophants who wants a WHITE Champion...   I am of African decent, and I started watching F1 because I love Senna, Prost, Lauda and Mansell, Schumacher (ALL WHITE OR OF EUROPEAN DECENT) because they were TRUE CHAMPS... They all HAD THE SPIRIT OF F1.  They were not BLACKS, you should not love a sport because of SKIN COLOUR, it is something detestable.  For me, David Courthard, if he is listening, is a DISGRACE TO THIS SPIRIT: He has sold his SOUL TO LIBERTY MEDIA: It is a SHAME...  SCOTTS are actually fighters for what is TRUE. How true a Scotsman he is, needs to be analyzed...
No standings for constructors, only drivers?
👍
If Max drives with 3 tires he still beats the whole field. What a Dutch legend.
Super MAX!
Great race! Miami is a great circuit.
$18M later McLaren is is actually doing worse LOL
Who is this effeminate commentator? This voice is most annoying and full of artificial excitement.
Verstappen is just insane😮
Where is the other commentator? "Its lights out and ... U could feel the speed in his commentary
Menuda M de retransmisión...
The real winner is the guy who stretched this video to 8mins
Verstapen só perde se acontecer um problema com o carro
I saw this on tv
E uma besta nn ter  mais a  narração em português
Wow! red bull go go~
Max verstapen king leon 😍😍🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁🦁
The guys from Red Bull - You have found yourself not just a champion, but you have found yourself a gold mine, such people as Verstappen have no price at all, this is a brilliant great man, it is difficult for me to compare him with anyone.
Perez is sadly to bad against Verstappen..
Congrats to Max. I’m a RB fan but I want to see more than Max dominating week in and week out with some few exceptions here and there. Not sure if Perez or anyone for that matters can keep up with him.
5:07 imagine Perez stop was 3,1 and Verstappen was 2,2 sec. People would have gone mental😂😂
Give Stroll a car to compete and.... Oh wait...
Another absolute yawn fest
they always do perez bad
Boresd
Taylor Swift really liking Fernando even more now 😊🏁🏆
How can i listen to crafty in youtube ?
Bruh 7:12
SuperMax
That redbull iss rigged😂😂😂😂me as a Ferrari fan
I want checo to win this year.
Valió 🐭 Pérez
This is the best time for me to be able to get verstappan
Boring season ahead
Am I insane or the cars way to quiet and the announcers way to loud
Gracias por los comentarios es español
What happened with Crofty? Is he commentates F1 now?
RB cars are illegal.It's strange that FIA disn't inspect them yet after this F0 performance
By far the best race!!!
Lewis bir sürü pilot geçti, özette 2 defa gördük sadece. Bu kadar kötü özet olabilir ancak!!!
F1 is so much harder to watch with this commentator
"English, motherf%$ker, do you speak it"??
realmente la carrera fue un fiasco, todos corrieron para el nenito mimado que tiene todo comprado, y el auto yo lo haria revisar no puede haber tanta brecha en los coches
Max rocket'ing past Leclerc and KMag using the slipstream with DRS was wild. That Red Bull car is a monster with Max behind it.
At this point, no matters where the red bulls start, they will always end up on the podiums.  Congrats to the best non-RedBull Fernando ❤
In other words:  Great race for Alonso, medium race for Leclerc, and a boring win
Please sign Crofty and co. back! No one can replace the iconic "It's lights out and away we go!"
Was ist bloß mit Hamilton und dem Auto der soll Mal wieder alle vorne wegfahren
Bottas 😂
What commentary is this? Please don't ever do that again.
Red Bull cheats. Cars designed for Max. 2021 cheats. Overspend cheats 2022 & 23
Checo 💪🏾🇲🇽#1
I keep saying that Checo is a great second driver, he better settles with second place in championship ... he will never win the championship with Max beside him. Max simply showed who is boss. He is just the GOAT
How do I get back to English comment and not the Belgian voice over ?!
Формула 1 снова скатывается, в говно, за 5 гонок - ничего интересного не произошло.. Всё предсказуемо
Where is David croft? Please my man. Come back.😔
Why is it race on and not lights out?
Boring race
Why the F didn't I hear 'it's light out and away we go' ...... what is this
sainz not able to defend, even if he wanted to. iykyk
8-minute highlights of this boring race? Wow, props to the editor.
All the Max and RB haters… This is what Mercedes did for 7 years straight. This is what you get if you create a perfect car as a team
Haven't followed F1 for a while, why are the cars so much slower? 😂
And people call this race boring
and here comes THE DUTCH DOMINATOR with another victory! lewis fans look on begrudgingly.
Max Verstappen P9... Hold my beer  He is a legend.
Lewis P13 to P6 underated performance given how close the midfield is.
Great recovery from Max, but when we compare this with Brazil 2021...
Commentary having a really hard time trying to hype it up
No me agrada este resumen en español 🙄 extraño en versión Ingles
How boring can we make f1 FIA: Yes
how did you managed to collect 8 minutes of action?
Leclerc is a massive dissapointment, he does not seem to have the winning mentality. He costs Ferrari so much and they can't afford it anyway. They should get rid of him and bring Bottas.
The strategy won if for Max
Thanks YouTube for the highlights. I came here for racing. They can get a bit excited about the very brief Perez resistant, but this wasn't really racing was it. Confirms why f1 is so boring this season.
Sains should have left Ferrari, and he deserves Ferrari...
Red Bull gave race to Max. What a shame. Poor Checo
Even in same car this perez guy finished 5 sec behind , hoping to win championship, what a joke
alguém precisa informar ao narrador que a voz dele não ajuda muito para o tom que usa nas narrações nem nos excesso de entusiasmo. Sinto como se fosse um ataque de histeria e gritos exagerados.   someone needs to inform the narrator that his voice doesn't do much for the tone he uses in narrations or over-enthusiasm.  I feel like a hysteria attack and exaggerated screaming.
One of the most boring races in history 🥱 RedBulls are killing the sport (and I'm not a Merc fan)
Same thing week in and out. So boring. No need to even watch the full race.
Remove this race please
It would be nice if the video emphasized the sound of the cars a little more than it does. The engine sounds enhance the experience as s viewer, and they are somewhat lacking here.
Being a fan of Max, Lewis Hamilton must be appreciated for driving from p13 to p6
Perez vs Max
Max is an amazing driver
Sergio Perez will get back.....
Brig how many 3rds does alonso have?
So obvious what was gonna happen from when Max got into the top 6......
Only Max's haters can't see the harsh reality, Max is much better than Checo
Max and Fernando are from another level
Ferrari and Mercedes enginers: Ok, so... Fernando is faster than you. 🇪🇸🏆
2:19 video game much?
Where is David Crofty's voice??? The new one doesn't give any excitement..
boring boring boring
Ferrari! Manda Leclerc a lavorare la campagna 😂
We need an extended version of this race… said no one ever
F1 is so boring with these cars
Funny how they make Max overtaking Perez at the end look exciting haha. It was really just Max overtaking Perez.
Boring...it remembers me the years of schumacher...absolutely boring.
Idk if I’d call these highlights
Really hope Monaco suits the Aston Martin, I really want to see Fernando Alonso win this year.
max getting the number 1 driver treatment again with strategy and upgrades
Great to wha
Formula one should be renamed to Formula Max.
im sorry but why isnt the comentator David Crofty? he is 10x better (i know f1 wants to expand to the states and gain more money but this is unfair for David…
no competition here(( easy game for rb …
i miss the ''its light out and away we go''
Explain how Red Bull has such a huge advantage
This sport had 1 competitive year in 10 years. Needs some major fixing to make it more competitive. Boring and predictable
RB FTW 🦾
Zzzzzzzzz
Max shown once again why he’s world champ
Can we get a larger roster of commentators?
Shout out to Alonso & Gasly. (Two of my favourite drivers) You know the British broadcasters really don’t want a non British driver/team to win. They can’t even hide it. There is no enthusiasm during this highlight package whatsoever. I know that there can be a lack of true competition in F1 and the whole thing is more often than not a precession. (The qualification is arguably the most exciting aspect) What I find funny though is when it was Lewis Hamilton who had been winning by 20 seconds from Bottas for over 3 years running would have this huge uptick in volume as he crossed the line every time as if we were witnessing the most exciting thing in the world lol.
Max doesn’t even have to qualify to win!
Ferrari bitik
"Incroyable ça quand même !" Ben non c'est le DRS...
How can Alonso always keeping up with the top with his slowass aston martin car?
Chequered flag came too late
Do better, Alpin Renault! Hire me as a driver or something!
Come on F1, we need the radio beep for messages on mobile, Please?
Макс реальний красава!! Він то доказує
Just me thinking it was a really boring race ?
BOOOOORING
Who will be the last to break?
Imagine F1 with Crofty.. my ears would appreciate
People who say this was boring, don't know racing.
We miss the old host
So boring. When someone is so much quicker, this is no driver, it's a car.
Yeeeess this is un french let'ss goooo 🔥🔥🔥
🏆RB19
Sigh Ferrari
They should prohibit Red Bull from using DRS
Thats really hard to watch, why zoomed out coming out of turn 3 when it’s a most crucial turns from the grid run?
Who are these nasal voices commentating here? Bring back Crofty and Brundle
how is Perez 5+ seconds behind his teammate in the "same" car :o
Was nicht passt wird passend gemacht.
Boring
Anyone else want to see Alonso in a Red Bull?
Sergio Perez sacrifices his race for Max. Red Bulls policy was to favor Max not Perez.
Boring season
If it was f1 on PlayStation set to easy he would’ve jumped to 4th from launch 😂
They maded Checo's car slower... 5 second difference.. WTH.
👍🏻
Max is a legend
Verstappen, very resambles Senna at his best, like no other one.
Preferred the previous / regular commentators though...
Feels a bit like the Mercedes dominance again but now with Redbull
Verstappen playing a 9th to 1st with 0% ai race.
Can we please get a normal human being to wave the flag on this GP? I swear the flag would have moved more if I farted on it...
Max verstappen on charles and kmag was so ridiculous
F1 vs F 0.5
Its a highlight nd i still feel sleepy 😂😂
Bad commentary though :(
..and another boring F1 race 😴😴😴
Would like to know why red bull cars spark so much more than the others.
Does anyone know why Red Bull didn't pit Perez for softs with a few laps left, so he could go for an attempt on the fastest lap? They were ~20 seconds clear of Alonso with ~17 seconds needed for a pit stop.
Without DRS it could have been a 2005 Imola repeat. Sadly it didn't happen.
boring brits
Anyone know why it’s not Martin or Crofty commentating? The commentary is just.. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Anyone who grew up in 90s and 00s with real F1, knows this is reduced as joke of a sport. Delete DRS please, where the sense of artificial overtakes is?
Boring race👏🏻
Another snooz fest. And to think that the new regs were supposed to give us a better show... FAIL !!!
NO challenge for redbull… the car is too fast rather than other cars.. quite boring watching F1 now… better MOTOGP which is more challenging with other teams… 😊
Sadly another boring race, the podium was clear from around lap 20. The only mystery was why Red Bull didn't pit Perez for softs with a few laps to go so he could attempt getting the fastest lap.
Where’s David Croft 😢, this feels like F2 commentary
Boringggggggg
Si Checo hubiera ganado esta carrera, sería el líder. Tal parece que hay otros intereses dentro del equipo y lo siento por Pérez que ha venido haciendo las cosas bien, pero con un equipo donde prefieren que gane tu compañero, es difícil.
Max is better than Checo
Boring track
I don't know why there are so many people saying Perez can't bring a championship fight to Max this year (Unless they're all just Verstappen shaggers). Compared to his previous years at RedBull he has greatly improved his quali and race pace to the point where he's matching Max, and has genuinely held off Max in the races he's won.  Checo had some bad luck with the strategy in this race. I think it had to do with the track not being rubbered in (Because of the heavy rainfall the night prior) combined with the heavier fuel weight at this stage of the race is what made the mediums a poorer tyre to start with compared to the hards.
Man, that redbull speed is just unbelievable
Alonso's pace is something we can't explain
"Verstappen, who is treating this like the f1 game on the playstation, set to easy" 😭2:15
It would make sense if every driver had the same car.
After 30 odd years of watching f1, I've finally called it a day after this...Not even racing anymore, so dull.
Perez is an absolute joke.
Yawn. Same three guys again. Hey Lewis, Russell was 4th! Stop running your mouth about politics and drive the car!
Am I the only one who thinks that these cars overtake too easily?
poor commentary without crofty
Les commentaires en français so to vraiment nul..
get this commentator OUT PLEASE BRING BACK CROFTY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We need to reverse Max' steering wheel to make it more entertaining for us and more challenging for him lol
Please give David  croft sir commentary, it was festival to watch f1 race with David croft sir commentary. We r very big fan for his voice. It humble request, now also many times i am watching f1 highlights of old races of David croft sir commentary. Please change commentary in next race highlights of 7 minutes in YouTube and 30 minutes highlights in F1TV pro.
Ver, Per, Alo really is the new Ham, Bot, Ver
It's so great to see Fernando doing so well again!  Congrats!
Bro Red Bull is straight up OP
Kmag is W
Me on easy on PlayStation will find it hard to win it from 9th
Can we Crofty and Martin Brundle back as commentators!!!
Alonso on the other hand is just so entertaining to watch! As long as he is in it, I'll be interested in F1.
What a boring race
honestly, its just no fun watching the redbulls being so dominant. No matter who wins in the end and if you like them or not... its just boring that way.
Feels like f1 2020 looking at ferrari
These F1TV commentators are still such a turnoff. Please bring Crofty and Brundle back.
If Perez had started 9th, he would have probably been 4th or 5th by the end of the race. Even with an amazing car, he cant be aggressive enough to win the race.
Mercedes just cannot compete anymore.
⭐
Bring back Crofty
Aston 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Me : *sees Max Vs Perez* cool-  *feels flashback of Vettel Vs Weber*
The commentary really doesn’t help you get excited about the race, it’s like it’s been dubbed on afterwards and the commentator knows what’s about to happen.
The Ferrari team and Engineers should be embarrassed. It's been forever since they were truly competitive. Car after car and driver after driver and Ferrari is at a point, it struggles to pass the Haas cars and pull away. Ferrari are not even close to competing with Red Bull at this point. They can put together a nice qualifying lap every now and again but race speed is where it counts and it's not even a competition. Sad to see really.
Boring ahh race yet again. RedBull 100% winrate. The moat unbalanced sport in the history of sports.    PS: Please don't say "BuT MeRcEdEs DoMiNaTeD FoR 8 YeARs" because that is exactly the problem we switch from one to the other and its never an actual race.
Boring race as every single race this season. Nothing special, nothing exciting.. We are put all of our hope on Fernando for a decent championship, but the redbulls are just out of reach.
nice race, bad show. leave it classic.
this commentator is horrible
I have no idea why RB didn’t start both cars on hards. It’s so easy for them to pass - Checo could have easily waited a few laps if he lost a few places at the start.
Would love to see checo as world champion
Certo que os carros da RB são rápidos, mas os caras deixaram o holandês voador passar sem resistência 😅😅😅😂
There’s something dodgy about that red bull
Ferrari 😢😢😢
What happened to McLaren?
нет, это просто какой та читерство со стороный ребулла! каждый раз они первый и второй! это через чур! нах все не буду смотреть ф!
I remember an old rule in which the car coming from pit lane cannot cross the line to come on track. At 5:17 looked like max crossed the line. Or is it incorrect?
Overpower red bull, boring 🥱🥱
Even the Highlights are  boring!
지기네 막스
On se rend compte du talent de Julien Fébreau en écoutant les commentateurs de cette vidéo 😅
Why have a full season of races, just give Red Bull the prize and call it a day
When you engage DRS you reduce drag, but you also reduce downforce because you have less wing, and therefore your ride height increases slightly... So why is Max's car throwing out sparks from the underside, which indicates it is bottoming out, when he using DRS? The other drivers are saying that the RedBull is ridiculously fast when using DRS, I don't know if, or how, these two things are related, but it's certainly interesting.
Boringest race so far of the season
Max drive was just brilliant, excellent management
boring race, boring track, boring season!
Amazing drive by Magnusson
Ferrari ?
it doesnt feel the same as ITS LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO
We want Turkish Grand Prix 🇹🇷🇹🇷
Perez deserved the win.😢
Max is simply the best...he is a BEAST.
What's the poor commentary? Where's brundle
I had a nice nap during this race as usual. Don’t know why I keep watching f1, possibly for the nap.
Looks like another boring season ahead already .........
Hello mario here,   Great driving max , keep doing it 😅. Bye from mario
anyone missing crofty?😢
boooooooooooooring
who was the person "waving" the checkered flag? they completely missed Max and all they did was move the flag up and down.
Max was too quick 😑 what did they do to that car 😌
you can defend against everyone but not Verstappen.
Champ is a Champ 👏
Fernando still doing it 🙌
I keep forgetting it’s not Crofty in these highlights and I literally said ew when I heard this dudes voice.
What a freaking suprise when all of 20 Formula One drivers with their 20 Formula One cars crosses the finish line and even none of them retired from the race.
International comms pls
5 seconds time penalty makes me remember the most dramatic Australian Grand Prix and it's enough to make Ferrari didn't get any points at that time  I wonder if the safety car appears on the last lap
LeClerc in Ferrari struggling against Haas and just meekly giving up to an underperforming mercedes.. wth of going on ..
For all those people who allready declared Sergio the new world champion; now, after Miami, is the time that he needs your support more than ever.
It's painful how disappointing this season is unfolding
The cleanest race this season: no retirements Also impressive performance from Max Verstappen, from 9th to 1st Great weekend
i feel bad for leclerc on that one oof
Wow. Didnt realize Max fans were so hostile and toxic, but these comments really speak for themselves.
👏👏👏👍👍👍💙💙💙
Those who take POLE should lead the race, IN REDBULL. This is unfair.
I'm waiting for the day when Max would have a car trailing him with fresher tyres.
Where is perez.   !!!!
I noticed that at the end of lap 2 when they get on the straight there are parts falling onto the track from the pitwall info panels ( or whatever they are called that people inform their divers with ). How are those fallen bits handled ? Someone leans over the wall to grab them ? A pincher stick ? Just leave it there and hope it doesn't fly further onto the track ?
Hard to watch F1 anymore and not see it as fixed. Nice to see Haas, Alpine and Aston making a push this season though for what that's worth.
Goatstappen, let's go RB!
How tf is Verstappen so fast
Another boring battle. Sigh.
Ferrari ne zaman geri dönecek
removing Binotto has done miracles with the team. From close second they are far away third.
There were a lot of BEAUTIFUL overtakes. This was the best race of the season so far, really enjoyed it :D
Such an awesome race
Why isn't Crofty commentating these races man?
4:41 what is Hamilton doing
Congrats two hondas beast   machine. Redbullracing team.max&serg.brilliant riders
leclerec not gonna win wdc in his career, same case like ric. he has talent but he is missing something what makes ver, ham, and alo greatest of all time
I have about the same amount of enthusiasm for this season as the guy waving the flag
ferrari 🐓🐓🐓
Disponibiliza o áudio em português br!! 🇧🇷
F1 is so boring might as well just be max on his own it's so predictable
Why only Red Bull win all the races ?
congratulations 🎉max 👏💪
WAS ALONSO RACING ??? I DIDNT HERE FROM HIM AT ALL IN THIS "HIHGLIGHTS"
The respect both red bull drivers had shown to each other was master class
👍😍❤️❤️
Reporter: What's your secret, Christian? C. Horner: IDDQD, IDKFA.
Another boring race with max leading the whole race, yawn
ALONSO on MAX prediction on the podium: on lap 25 🙃 MAX on the podium position: on lap 14 🤣
43 lap on the same tyres!!! Cheat
Where is David Croft??
Hahahahaha soo many cry baby's in the comment section hahahha
Another Snoozefest….
Idk either Max's car has like 300hp more then the rest. Or the DRS takes all the fun out
fix race    f1 is boaring
Boring f1 now redbull car faster not drive skill
Kevin and Max overtaking Charles...  Charles: 'Am I a Musician to you?'
Not Mad Max again he is so boring
spanish comentaros from Spain are way better and experienced
The race was that boring my dad slept half way through the race💀💀💀
The World is seeing that budget cap is to be overpass. 2 teams did. The same teams that are leading. Thank you F1 it will be easy to bet. CONGRATULATIONS to all does that didn't surpass....
We need more tyres for leclerc
Checo man you're breaking my heart
Redbull sabotage Perez completely...😂😂😂
Great win for max but Miami was disappointing unfortunately we move imola should be exciting 🙌
Ferrari is a tractor this season
Por estranho que pareça.... 2 equipas reportadas ultrapassar o teto orçamental... são as mesmas 2 equipas que lideram o Mundial. Resumindo incumprimento de regras na F1 por orçamento compensa. Parabéns pela Grande diferença de velocidade entre essas 2 equipas e todas as outras. Parabéns F1. Vai ser fácil fazer apostas de vencedores. 😂🎉
Wow another podium for Alonso 💪🏻💪🏻 great to see!
Where tf is Crofty man
change commentators
Max is an absolute genius!
What is the point of watching races when you know who is going to win?
Los que hablan creo que son de Valladolid. Son inconfundibles.
Maxy ❤
Give the other drivers better cars so we can srart watching fi again..right now the real racers have better things doing.
Only way to have this race competitive if Perez and Verstappen start last
10 for Mag very nice.
just car
Looked like another boring race where max wins. Again
boring
Fi is losing ground..the fans are waiting to see some real racing.not what we are seeing now
F1 Not fun, Moto GP is even more fun. There are only the same winners, Moto GP, the second team can still beat the big team.
chequered flag was too late for MV crossing the line 😂 "you had one job"  7:09
Fi should be ashamed..the cars are not  even.make it a level playing field with the cars and we will all see some very different results
Ferrari imbarazzante
Great run for Alonzo
Por favor, poned a los comentaristas de DAZN
9th to the 1st place at ease…. Im started to feel bored every race
Max é bonito de ver esse cara pilotar, super arrojado, sem medo de  uma disputa. Principalmente quando larga atrás.
차가 문제가 아니라 샤를이 문제가 있네
Nice to see RedBull's woke livery for Miami race
Shame Tsunoda overtaking Albon (?) isn't in this highlight. KMag was amazing to watch, great race in general.
You left out my race highlights, basically Alonso on the radio. He's been in form this weekend.
Imma say it now...Max is for sure gonna be the next in history for the era 2020 and so forth...his team/car and skills is beyond capabilities, he currently has what L.Hamilton did during his prime years...I just wished the competition was fair...imagine allowing all the best drivers to swap teams with the best cars for the season....eg...alonso has n will always be Legend....imagine him in the redbull seat...im tempted to he would make max push even further during qualifying * race day no need mention cuz it's endurance and pure sustainability
MAX 🔥🔥💪💪 vs haters 💩💩💩and sky sports please change commetetor he has just 💩 voice
New title: Max's overtakes
Can you guys bring back Crofty? No disrespect to Alex but Crofty just way better
Alonso is giving 2012 Raikkonen vibes
Another boring race.
Home Boring Is modern f1?
wheres crofts commentary 🥲
Max's car is just too fast, its in a different league and its making it too easy for him to win and sadly the race is not as competitive and is getting boring. Its like four years ago with Hamilton having similar dominance with such a fast car.
Hamilton is not happy just driving regular not on the hustle any more 🤷‍♂️
Era pra ser carros iguais
The overtake by max on Charles and magnus was not even fun, I missed the last 2 races and well not much to see, it is just too much difference. As said in the comment, like play station on east….
Hamilton where are you ?
F1 red  bull os outros car popular
Get rid of the yank commentator
For every race, can you make a video with all overtakes?

worst commentary
Alonso 3rd and Stroll 12th. Lol
Considering unsubscribe from f1tv what a boring season.
I can't understand the American boos for Verstappen. Who do you think are the best drivers in the world, Michael Andretti and his ilk? don't make me laugh...
What's the point watching F1? Red Bull is mocking everyone
Alonso is a true master. Verstappen has only fast car
RBR insane... new dinasty...
Let Max start way back on the grid. He'd still win.
Perez so cautious on the inside when Max overtook him. Anyone else (cough, Russell, cough) will be in Max's sidepod already 😂
F1 is so boring now
So boring
That's not F1 that's DRS1
Why is David Croft not the commentator?🧐
Bull is flying high this season
Wow, even the race highlights are boring now.
Only watch Formula 1 to see Pérez. I can’t stand Verstappen.
Verstappen racing on peaceful mode
How is a drinks company able to embarrass OEMs like this? 😂
Max is monster 🏆🏆
This championship is a joke once again...
red bull too fast
You know what i would like to see. Hamilton move to Redbull. That woukd be so entertaining.
Highlight of the race: Alonso watching his teammate's overtake on the big screen and then talking about it on radio!
“Race Highlights” there weren’t any
Alonso is rossi in the f1(i think)
how tf does max gain a 5 second gap within 10 laps in the same car as checo
A Formula está uma PIADA -Totalmente sem GRAÇA - Pilotos Fracos seguindo ordens da equipe a corrida inteira JÁ ENTRA NA CORRIDA SABENDO QUEM VAI VENCER E FICAR ENTRE OS 6 PRIMEIROS. Não pode fazer nada dentro da corrida que é ilegal - Totalmente manipulado  (VOU ASSISTIR OS REPLAYS DO TEMPO DE SENNA E MANSELL lá sim havia pilotos e emoção de verdade mesmo com a FIA Tentando já manipular tudo como fez com PROST)
Ferarri f1team better close the team and start selling hotdog at every race track
Congrats MV....
He's treating this just like a video game 😂😂😂 yeah right Gaming is easy 😂😂😂
Expectation: Leclerc vs Verstappen vs Setsuna Yuki. Reality: Leclerc vs Magnussen.
Perez🤣🤣 if that was Max, he won't let him pass like that
K mag was magnificent yesterday
F1 and RedBull, The best cheating partners
Perez worldchampion?!  With all respect for Checo, starting from pole, and Max from 9th position . .. how he can lose? Sorry Checo but only in your dreams you can be worldchampion.
Now what checco perez??wrong choice of tire?hahah...you take hard!max takes medium!ahaha...you see the result?its a battle between max and checo....
@Formula1 please bring Crofty and Brundle back into these highlights - THEY are the voice of F1.
What if Alonso was on RedBull this year?
調子悪いよ
RED BULL HONDA 1🏁2🏁 The Power of Dreams
Jos was right he won't win often😂😂😂
I think Piastri will be rooing the day he left Alpine for McLaren. He is making the exact  same mistake as Ricciardo.
Seriously. Two unscippable 20sec advertisements? And a 15 second intermediate one?
Another race full of shocks and surprises
TOTO we went car racing
Am I the only one thinking F1 is boring?
Maximus Verstappen!
Its not even fun anymore. Vers starts 9th and wins by 5 seconds. F1 is broken
massive respect given by all drivers on track when racing this sunday, hard racing but no crashes
Why Perez did not use hard tires at the begining? He could be in 1st place.
Another race, another commentary without Crofty 😒😒😒😒😒
There could be a phone call from Ferrari to Haas .....
Seen better highlights at a funeral
If you don't believe the technical support and FIA mafia backing of MAX and his car from this race, i don't know how much you need
Another boring race nascar was wayyyyy better
Wow no safety car nearly bet on that yesterday
VIVA MEXICO , VIVA SERGIO PEREZ CABRONES , AJUA SIGUIENDO A CHECO DESDE MONTERREY MX.
Seriously, F1 guys, you shouldnt bother with these HIGHLIGHTS anymore.
Checo is the deserving one. Kudos
Perez has no chance against max
F1 sudah tidak seru lagi..yang menang kalau bukan verstapen pasti perez😢
Hamilton fighting lecler over 6 or 8 points, mans finished, finish him brooo 😂
So, max is racing with ai on 80?
Max drove too well on this one. So annoying lol
Kenapa dengan FERARI semakin hari semakin merosot tidak kompetitif
MaxV - the best of the pack.  M 🦘🏏😎
Fantastic performance of Verstappen
1:13 "Late on the brakes, the performance of that car is outstanding". What about the performance of the driver in that car, he doesn't count ???
Dude whenever Perez wins a race the next one he is like still hangover. We all knw Max is Max but for fxkkshake Checo give us something... Well unless RB tune his engine down😂
Formel Max
why does the commentator change every second
These commentators are so annoying .
Where did Crofty and Brundle go?? Laid off/transferred to another post???
Lewis after hearing not to hold up Russel behind him: "He can pass me but i'm not moving over". One lap later: *almost parks car in miami dolphins stadium to let Russel by*  I swear i could hear a hysteric laughter way behind him in one of the Alfa's🤔
Watched it on f1tv, it was painful to listen that American guy pronouncing drivers names.
Checo is a great consistent driver. But Max is in a different league. Only a DNF for max will make this title fight interesting.
Very boring and scripted
I love f1
How utterly boring...the championship will be done and dusted by mid season if not sooner. 9th to 1st and didn't even break sweat.
F1 is the most boring it’s ever been
Boring season when Reb Bull machines are so much faster  ahead of others...
There was a time when overtaking in F1 took real skill and bravery. Ever since DRS came in most overtakes just need the ability to press a button at the right time.
Am I the only one who watches less races now due to Red Bull being so clear from everyone else? The Mercedes’ Red Bull rivalry was great to watch because you always felt it was just a matter of time for Red Bull to figure it out and put in a proper challenge, even tho merc was dominating constructors cup and solo driver titles. Unless they change rules again drastically and bring the field closer together from a comp/ financial aspect. I don’t see verstappen losing a title for the next five years minimum.
another boring race - most boring season so far
Funny that American's need their own commentator so they have something to relate to.
"its lights out and away we goooo"  crofty on bein sport
Imagine paying those ticket prices to watch this slop.   F1 continues to be the biggest scam in motorsports.
F1 so boring , and no real drama these days !
Did max really finished? I didn't see the checkerd flag!!🤣🤣🤣
Max is scarily so much faster than everyone. It doesn’t even seem fair anymore, everyone might as well go home 😹
Jos was right checo is joke in f1
Checo must accept that max is boss
Ferrari absolute joke !!! LOL 😁😂
I can't tell now if Leclerc is the problem or if it's Ferrari. Sainz has been consistent, Charles is all over the place. Either way no one is touching Red Bull and Verstappen this year.
I never know where Charles Clerc is from? anyone know? I don't think they mention it every race.
Nice to not see much in the way of team orders, at least Perez got to race Verstappen a little bit.
The man who managed to extend this to 8 minutes deserves an award
There were highlights for this race?
Bring back the old commentator. The new one lets my ears bleed omfg
Commentator is awful, so dull
Max will be LEGENDARY in a few years time what a dude! 🥇 🥇
By far one of the most boring and disgusting track creating absolute boring races.
F1 has never been so boring, redbull redbull redbull. FIA must do something to bring back the old competition.
Boring.  Every race is the same.
Boring
Aucun charisme les commentateurs,
These American commentators 😭😭😭
The commenter is worse than Croft.
What happened to English commentary. Can't hear anything. 😳
Max is top G
The childish display at NASCAR - This is why we need to remove F1 from America. America doesn’t have the maturity for the professional F1 motorsport.
These commentators are commentating as though Commentator Game on Playstation set to easy.
Drs is pretty sad
perrari parahhh 😅😅😅👎
MVP🔥
Gigamax Chadstappen
Boring
When teds notebook is more fun than the races..
Yes guys the new era is there, he's going beat that 6 time world titles from Lewis easily..
Boring
WOW... Alonso is going guns blazing.. I'm so happy for him and Aston Martin. Amazing race from everyone.
ITS BEEN TWICE IN A WEEK THAT YOU PUT TWICE THE SAME VIDEO IN THE SAME LANGUAGE !! WHAT THE MATTER WITH THE ENGLISH VERSION ?
2:13-2:24 🤣😂  that was an awesome battle between charles & k mag rlly going wheel to wheel 👍
Miami, in fact all the Sepoland GP's are the most boring of the year. Even Monaco is more interesting. Typical Septic Tanks, fake Marina, like everything else Sepo, fake.
Poor Lando. He deserves way better than what he’s getting in that car
Ces commentateurs en Français sont à la F1 ce que Christian Jean-Pierre était au football…
Max is King!
It is incredible how passionate the english commentator is compared to other languages
"the superior performance of the Ferrari" 3:40  not sure what you are smoking man but Ferrari does not have superior  performance.   RB are on another level...but i think RB  have some sort of arrangement with FAI to hold Ferrari back. and it all started in 2019.. after Ferrari was caught cheating.. from that point on there is a cost cap, engine freeze and a heavy focus on aero first when we know Adrian Newey is pretty much untouchable aside from his actual apprentice in Aston Martin.. all the changes to the regs and all the restrictions only Favor RB and no one else.. especially the engine freeze, the only area where Ferrari and Merc would be able to get something done to challenge RB.. but no, we have a engine freeze during an era in F1 were Aero is king...
Incredible drive by the red bull team, also the boys keeping their distance whilst overtaking .
I want to know what kind of steroids they're feeding that Red Bull.
Race: Max versus himself and the others where there for the show. Mad MAx showing there are levels to levels........
Race on??
🥱
😴😴😴
From 9th to 1st in 21 spins please hello someone check out that team’s car . Redbull in the engine compartment or what?!…🤔🤔🤔👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👮🏾‍♀️👮👮👮👮👮
i don’t get those who were saying that this race is boring !!???  great battle between charles and kmeg hamilton recovery from p13 to p6 and russell p6 to p4  and king MAX from p9 to p1  what they want more honestly 😏
KOMENTATOR NYA BIKIN NGANTUK
The commentary sounds so rehearsed.
Perez started first and ended 2nd. While Verstappen managed to overtake everyone and take the race. What a potential difference between the two redbull drivers!!
Bring back the Crofty and Martin Brundle’s commentary
Zak brown gotta go
When you can't even fill eight minutes of highlights with exciting racing you have to understand how we are currently having the worst Formula 1 ever...
To easy pass please anyone to check redbull engine or dinamics! Smells like something going on ! The cake it’s been eaten between them 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Wow
Alonso  está  muy bien megusta   otro   podio  Aston  Martín
Lucky we still have real f1 races to see and no pole, stay 1st for the whole race, BOARING, Max better start 9th, than we see racing❤
NASCAR race was 10x better.
Is it just me or has the start to this season been bit bland.
Dont you think DRS option should be off as it gives too much advantage to a car having similar qualities just because it is behind.....if though then every car in DRS zone should have opportunity to use DRS instead of just the behind competitive car....
5:40 pretending to race
the driver presentation at the start was awful. No more please.
Is Verstappen past his prime? It took him 20 laps to reach the lead!
Boring
Enjoyed that one
Perez comes crashing down to earth with a thud.
Max getting fastest lap on hards while also going from 9th to 1st overtaking his teammate is masterclass
2:18 that's what happens when you make a million rules and regulations and expect it still to be competative
Why isnt the commentary on yt from crofty??   I miss his loud screaming on here.  During the race on sky he's great but why not on Youtube?
0:01 proper soi boi commentary 😅
Fantastic to see my old team 1/2 again👊
I hope Hamilton crashes hard 🙏
Snooze fest 😴
Anyone else noticed Hamilton throw something out of the car at 4:40?
Another rock bottom after azerbaijan
boring race
Just Random:  It‘s Light out and Away we go
its Mad F1 use the channel 4 comms team not the SkyF1 comms team for their highlight reels,
Masterclass from MAX. Period.
Thank you kmag and leclerc for the fun fights.
I’m glad I don’t watch this live anymore.
Drs ruining F1
Ferrar keep making spaghetti !
Who's the American guy on comms?
Guys this race is so interesting that I fell asleep after 1 lap.
these new cars spoiled formula 1. very big cars.
Max Verstappen 👏👍🤙
Boring
Even watching the Highlights makes me feel I'm loosing my time this season...
Why are the pictures so jittery? It is giving me a headache.
I'm really disappointed with the Formula 1 commentators. Their lack of expertise is painfully obvious, and they often miss important details and make mistakes that even casual viewers can spot. It's a shame, especially considering how great the Sky Sports team including Martin Brundle, David Croft, and Ted Kravitz, are at bringing the action to life and providing insightful commentary. They truly understand the nuances of Formula 1 and their enthusiasm is infectious. I really hope the pros at Sky Sports can take over as main commentators as they were before.
This was basically a max Verstappen compilation 😂
Red Bull Red Bull Red Bull Red Bull Red Bull Red Bull till 2025
Can we talk about Hamiltons performance today. 13th to 6th overtaking leclerc in the process. One of the better drives today
That RB is a spaceship, incredible job by Newey and his team. going to be the most dominant car ever created.
No more DRS
This show the world that..a better machinery>driver experience
Red bull are a joke, that was fixed for a max win, holding perez back on his second stint, getting boring now.
Ferraris are so sad
I love this kind of commentary. No bias!
French commentary 🥴🥴🥴💔💔
Perez is a yoke a yoke.Max is sooo better than this mediocre driver
max and checo are like vettel and webber days
you can almost say that Alonso has got unlucky again this year, third again and surely would've won a race by now if the two Red Bulls weren't on a different planet
Ves obviously better driver than Checo.  Probably the burning desire Ves greater than steady Checo.
Love to see how Max would compare in a Merc or Ferrari? Would he get more out of it then the other 4?
Gefeliciteerd Max  Red Bull is far far the best The rest just have to fight for third place Max is Champ and will probably again Just another Red Bull 1-2
The bias of the commentators and comments here are staggering. No doubt the RB is a rocket ship but people really love to make sure that they tell you it's the car not the driver. Jeez.
Just put Crofty back on, what is this?
Nice race, lots of spectacular overtakes. Miami <3
Hats off the redbull and Max but it’s a pretty disappointing there’s no real challenge. Perez is a great driver but no match for Max. I think all F1 fans wana see a title fight. This is the down side to rule shakeups. There’s always a high chance one team will get it far better than everyone else and dominate for the foreseeable future. I’d say this will be the norm for the next few years
What happened to Crofty?
Loved that race. One of the best victories I have seen from Max.
what happened with the catchphrase "lights out" ?
Am i the only one missing “It’s lights out and away we go”😢
Pourquoi les commentateurs sont maintenant en français 😭c’est horrible, tous les gp avant c’était en anglais c’était beaucoup mieux
Red Bull. DRS Champions of the World. 2 car Formula One continues
De vries bro… we all thought he would charge in like a monster only to be beaten so horrendously by a small Japanese swear machine
F1 Tv not adding user it is restricting existing users..
What max did with those Hard tires was amazing
legit kinda boring now just redbull always taking the w
Alonso  41 years old, the King
what happen with original commentary ?
There were highlights? I turned it off.
Unfortunately it’s getting boring again 😔
F1 looks so boring, most of the lap nothing happens then the DRS zone comes up n gives slower cars a boost. And then more nothingness.
leclerc continua a deludere
Max conduit une fusee..c est normal qu il gagne si tout le  monde conduisait la meme voiture  le resultat serait different..
The commentators are so bad
F1 wes kasih Red Bull saja juara dunianya 1🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
Why does Verstappen get the better car than Perez????????  !!!!!!
How do you find 8 minutes of highlights in that race ? That was so boring lol
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Borinnnngggggg
DRS DRS DRS. MUCH too powerful. Makes racing boring. They just sweep past. Just far too easy.
Boring what a way to ruin the sport
It's not Verstappen that should get paid 50 millions a year, it's the engineers that built this redbull
What happened to the commentary 🥴
How come this is in french? ^^
the worst racing ever : /
Why not available on mobile?
ZZZzzzzZZZZzzzzZZZZzzzz like always ... poor F1 championship :(
HAAS got a point! Lets go!
Max lebendige  🚀💪💪😅😅
Does anyone like this F1? I mean, even the Red Bull supporter. I wouldn't like to win so easyly, absolutely boring
Eski sunucu nerede?
Verstappen had to give all the Brazilians a dose of reality
Another boring year of F1
red bull being so dominant is making f1 boring to watch honestly 😰 the only action we seem to get is the red bulls racing each other
Max races f1 in easy mode 💀
A class of his own
Raungan mesin F1 kalah telak dengan suara anda sebagai pembawa acara...!!!
you can see the strategy favoured max today, even tho he started 9th i had no doubts he would win, i really want Perez to win but all my hopes have been destroyed after watching this today
Alonso is superb
Non è più motorsports questa F1. Chi ha seguito per 40 anni la F1 non vi segue più. Non è perché la Ferrari è una carretta ma per le regole assurde che sono state inventate durante gli ultimi 5 anni. Non c'è più competizione vera. Auguro alla F1 di trovare nuovi sostenitori paganti perché quelli vecchi non ci saranno più
😢no eight title for this year too for Lewis again pitty man
I feel sorry for Perez. Max is invincible, genius!
No one complaining for this orribile track, incredible…
Were McLaren even there?
Red Bull car to overpower and f1 become boring
Max is just something else
Qué  circuito se han inventado los yanquis. Más plano que una tabla.
Really Mad Max❤
Maxterclass by Verstappen. He sillenced all the Sky journalist and the Mexican fans.  Now the regular tracks come he will destroy Perez.
How both max and Perez have both cars but the ones for max is faster, I think they priotize max
Honda rules
Max ...sei un mostro! ... Ferrari... schiaffi da tutti prendete.
ok just curious whether is there any chance that Lewis Hamilton can win the Championship this season.
Saya sangat senang melihat Alonso kembali berjaya naik podium walaupun makvertaven terlalu tangguh
Sorry f1 but the french pronouncing is painful as a native french speaker…
Nice
It's a car
Why are the Red Bull cars so much better? Was it to do with exceeding the car budget?
That Red Bull DRS is either complete cheating or complete genius!
1st time in my life i have seen driver do 1st pit stop on lap 45 ..does anyone ever done like what max did?
Worst season ever.
F1 is boring
F1 2023 = NASCAR 2015
Boring race
The others had no involvement in the race.
I think when we closely examine the facts, we can discern that - if the two rbrs are actually equal, that the only difference, besides driver quality, is how and when they did their stints on which tires.  Checo started on Meds, Ver on Hards.  Now, this is when the car is heaviest, with a full tank.  As we saw, the Meds of Checo wore down immediately, suggesting that the extra weight was a real game changer.  The Hards, on the other hand, seemed to perform really well under load, and got progressively better in the later laps.  By the time of the switch (Checo to Meds, Ver to Med), the cars were extremly light, and the Meds were absolutely awesome under the light load, whereas the Hards did not "wear down" enough to be anywhere near competitive.  This seems to be the explanation for the ability of one car to be able to cover a 20s gap and then to pass the other.
BRAVO Honda Red Bull... luv you forever... End Of Mercedes...
Max monstro
Espetacular Parabéns f1❤
Is this really required? I mean... 8 minutes?  You're more funny stretching out this garbage for 8 minutes than MONTY PYTHON meeting RICKY JERVIOS in a pub with a REVEREND and a MAORI.
It’s so funny that hard tyres are faster than softs 😂 Only cheat Bull things I guess.
Its lights out and Verstappen wins!
Boring
The Verstappen highlight real. It's boring to hear only about this cry baby
The redbulls have no challenge
Congratulations to Alonso having his 4th race win this year.
I’ve started to stay up and watch the race live just to catch croftys commentary. I would prefer no commentary over this guy
surprised Ocon didn’t get a penalty when Leclerc was speeding in pits!
As usual, a hysterical and screamy commentary absolutely ruining every single race. It's like they only have one setting. Full hysterics.
Oh yuki.yuki.yuki  Why your P11 😮‍💨
Funny how they only talk about 'the Red bull' or 'that car' instead of great driving. In hindsight, redub all the 7 Hamilton seasons, and replace the 'great hamilton performance' to the 'great car'  .  I stopped watching F1 those days cause it was simply boring. And it looks like we we facing a few boring years again.
Max showed Checo what he needs to do to even think about becoming world champion.
leclerc il piu' scarso dei piloti!!!!!
Poor video
As a Max and Alonso fan, I do have to recognize the great drive Lewis had.  Edit: It's amazing that even though you say something positive about the rival driver, and still people feel the need to respond negatively...
Why is not any one talking about the battle between Kevin Magnessun and Charles. Man performance by Kevin was on next level with a car like that.
Ferrari fighting with Haas instead of redbull is just pain.... 😮‍💨
Proficiat alle drie.
People just talk about car performance but Max is actually insane when it comes to corners
Honestly! Is Max’s car unfairly OP or not? Perez was doing so well…
Great stuff Alonso!!
Have been watching f1 nearly 30 years and would like to congratulate Ferrari for putting the worst team ever in their entire history. From pilot to team head to strategist , they are all exclusively selected to lose. Well done! Enzo is flipped up side down in his grave!
kmag deserves a better team honestly
It was hilarious when the final flag was half heartedly shown AFTER max crossed the line.
Within five laps, LeClerc dropped down? What happened?
Verstappen thriller 👍🏻
DRS should be used only on half the tracks. Those which had the least amount of overtakes the previous season or something like that
Gosh, that was predictable.
Another boring one
Nui cinstita formula 1 ,deam de vrio 2 ani
W old commentator
Love how no one says "it's the car" when it's Christian's driver
hij is gewoon de beste................
when the DRS will be removed?
Redbull are surely cheating 😮
Martin Brundle muss be crying in a corner somewhere. The commentary in the beginning was all against Max from him. Hahahaha.
what is this commentary... bring back the race commentary, we ont need this highlight commentary it sounds so fake
Kmag defending leclerc for 37 LAPS is insane
Great drive from max! Hate the booing at the podium. Why?
角田はペレスにお願いしてナンバーを11にしよう。
I just want Alonso on the podium!
I hate this commentator
The DRS destroy all the fun in F1! Without DRS Max cant overtake Alonso even with a weak car.... that is a FACT! First title of Max is a tottal Robbery in last race, second is DRS power...    Cancel the DRS guys! Let the pure power of engine and driver skills to race, to make us smile in front of TV
That Hard to medium strategy was so much faster. Hamilton and Max were rapid at the end the others had no chance
Ce drs a vraiment tout flingué...
MAX LESSS GOOOOO
This race shows the only reason Checo wins over Max is when something goes horribly wrong. Like Russell torpedoing him and  the safety car last race and the red flag yesterday.  Anyways, I'm not complaining,  it makes F1 this year slightly more exciting.
Can  u please add subtitles and not keep showing the boring story of verstappen always winning?😂😂
Cheater red bull like cheater ducati in moto gp
This is the 5th red bull win of the season  And it’s 3 wins for max verstappen  2 wins for Sergio Perez
C'est Fabrice Luchini qui commenté en français ?! 🤣
Despite the Bulls having both hard tyres. It's just unreal to see Max pulling a gap in the first lap and while overtaking Leclerc and magnussen. It's very hard to believe that both checo and max has the same car. The commentator saying "max got the car" says it all.
The comments where people are claiming Max is bad and isn't even a world champion yet. Are more entertaining than most races this season.
Lewis should retire now . 2021 season was best for his retirement ...
$wagzilla 🦖
Highlights? What highlights, it was garbage.
Yawn . . . .
Why didn’t they give checo mediums too??
This shows how much better Verstappen is then Perez.
Why don't you use Crofty's commentary for these highlights. It's just not the same without his voice.......
There's nothing here about Lewis Hamilton and he made a lot of overtakings...
Where is the amazing part verstappen goes past 2 cars at once?
Verstapen's car is on Fuckng steroids.
What a driver K. Magnusen is - give him a fast car, and he will be WC!!
Redbull way too fast..all hype for this season has gone 🥱
Always Redbull,,, just Redbull...getting boring...
didn't watch it live but only interesting question is if Alonso got to the podium!
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOORIIIIING
Despite how brilliant redbull had been since start of the season, hopefully other teams can play catch up after major updates before spanish gp. 😢 close the gap between the drivers.
Commentators volume all the way up and cars volume all the way down, nice
Hands down this is the most boring championship I've ever seen. No way that red bull is legal.
Can we take a moment and appreciate how well Tsunoda has been doing this season? Dude is arguably driving the worst car on the grid and is always nearly finishing in the top 10
Chucky hello you in a FERRARI racing a HAAS 😑 I think you should give the seat to someone more deserving and go back to just being a rich kid like your brother Latifi 😊
This is getting boring… Verstappen shouldn’t get from 10th to 3rd in 14 laps.
What is powering that red bull car 😅 gg max
Worst Commentary i have ever heard.
The commentary are weak compared to before. Can they bring them back pls
Such a bore, it doesn't matter where Max is he slices through the field like they're standing still.
Chuck Leglec the monegays, 0 time WDC is already damaged goods who only got lucky becaus ex TP Ms. mattia bonita made a call based of emotions because he loved him romantically. I can’t believe he replaced Vettel and though he was actually gonna be something when he is just a poorer version of Lance stroll
I don't understand why stroll not taking red tyres to make lap record since he has the car for and not able to get on the points.
F1 absolute bore fest. What are odds on RB win every weekend? 1/20?? 😂
Watching this is as boring as hearing about Dutch colonists
les commentateurs sont franchement nulls
ferrari disastro
anyone notice how most of the highlights are about red bull
very boring f1😅😂
I’m amazed you managed to make the highlights 8 minutes long 😂
So happy for kmag that he got a point here although he deserved more than just a point
ALONSO is coming for that first place this year
I hate the new race start words
the minister of defence could not defend
where do they get these commentators !!!
watching the ferrari get passed like in a videogame is so frustrating.....
Let me guess, one of the redbull won. 3rd either Alonso, Ferrari or Meredes.
I would clap all of these guys. For real. I would have been gone.
Charles and Sainz dont deserve to Ferrari
Max is, well, Max ❤
Funny to hear all British commenters praising the performance of Max's car instead of Verstappen himself...
Just go's to show, overspending with basically no penalties can pay dividends, bit like the boring Mercedes days, F1 has definitely lost the appeal it used to have
Bring back crofty ffs
Worst english commentary ever...
Yet another boring race. This is getting worse
Maybe I missed a memo, but where did Crofty and Brundle go?
Man I want Croft back in the highlights commentary
Max will be another Sebastian ... May be he will win all World Championships till 2026. Too bad Hamilton might never get his 8th title, thanks to Michael Messy for his messy job!
Que desastre la f1 saquen el drs ya no es más carrera ya no son más pilotos
Lando should be in the second Aston Martin.
Where is the previous speaker? I feel like I'm watching formula 2
That was an amazing performance from Alonso at his age, Schumacher didn't manage that when he did part 2 of his career. Give Alonso a fast enough car and he will win .
Yawn......
Magnussen is such a great driver/fighter …. 😮
Max enjoyed with the DRS...
Another borin street circuit race
3:42 "superior performance of the Ferrari" 💀
😮
boring race in f1. next race is max,peres, alonso
buena estrategia de red bull para que gane max
Its like shelling peas!!!
Slightly a better race than last year but the track is still appalling and stand by when I say its the worst track F1 has ever raced on.
You could remove DRS for Max only and he’d probably still win😂
Max dont even need to go out in Q3 to be P1 or to beat Checo XD
Red Bull really hung Checo out to dry, insane favouritism here
Unlucky Perez. Booo Verstappen 👎
It's got boring again! No one can compete with the red bull at the moment; from 10th to 1st with relative ease..where's the fun, the drama, the excitement..🥱
Goodbye to Mercedes Benz, gone are the glory days!
I missed the race but it looks fun considering everyone finished the race
Does anybody know the top of speeed (without drs):of Ferrari? 282 kmh? Like Ford Mustang in Gran Turismo 3?
This commentary is so much better than Crofty on Sky. Even in this summary of highlights, telling me much more about what's going on (I didn't see the race)
I wouldn't believe it before, but now after watching the comments, I can see that Hamilton is clearly underrated. P13 to P6 in the 3rd or 4th fastest car, best driver alongside Max yesterday, he should've been DOTD. Just like Hungary last year, when Lewis recoveres nicely but in the same time Max doing it too so he steals DOTD from Lewis, AND he's doing it with a rocketship while Lewis carrying that shitbox.
boring
Goatalonso
boring F1...🥱how to help motorsport brand if the winner is energy drink brand?... 🙈🙉🙊
This sport is rigged, RED BULL way faster than other cars...
Ferraris look just miserable this season.
Ferrari's only gotten worse.Could barely pass a haas and just look at the speed max passed leclerc
boooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnng race
where does Alex Jacque's commentary broadcast live?
Macchina Sprecata con sainz stupido blasonato, c'è chi merita quella sedia al suo posto pilota di mezza classifica e loha dimostrato piu volte
Yuki : 1111101011
How any one can watch F1 at the moment and enjoy it is beyond me. These new regulations have done nothing to improve the racing. We get no racing what so ever. I know it’s Max’ fault, but this has got to be the most boring season in F1 in recent times. At least we actually had racing when Merc were on top. People seem to forget that. Right now it’s just red bull followed by the F2 cars. If the previous regulations are anything to go by, it will take around 4 seasons for the rest of the field to catch up before we even get something of a “race”
Max Verstappen wins again
Jó autó mindig a világbajnok .   Egyforma autó kellene
No ways this cant be just talent, they need to audit Max's Redbull there's just no way
Red Bull fly? Why?  And Strategi all time Verstappen
Great 🚥🏎️🏁🍀🍀🍀🍀👌
Ferrari's engine is so obviously detuned in the race it's embarrassing..
I am sorry to say.. this commentary is bad..
get crofty back
Jeez the red bull is freakin rapidd 😂😂
Its sad how no one care about p1 p2 and p3 and mostly care about p4-p10 just because a team decided to overspend and add a drs like onto the kit  so yeah thanks redbull for ruining the championship
Tim order red bull
Max using cheat codes / gameshark
Really enjoyed Kmag's driving today
Cmon man the red bull on drs is ridiculous. There’s no competition
Alonso performence more enjoy to watch then Verstappen
The Redbull's are what the Ducati's are in MotoGP and WSBK
Una bella noia
trash commentating by the way
This is the most boring year for F1
what is wrong with Ferrari? everyone was overtaking them with drs, they were the only one not  doing it... akward absolute no sense 34 laps to overtake haas
red bull  space shuttle
Aston Martin is amazing this Season
It’s getting boring now
How can people still say F1 is an entertaining sport? The difference between the Top mid and end grid it’s huge. Such a boring race and sport
That was again quite a boring race :(
Booooooooring 😴
Boring
we need vettel back in the aston martin in strolls place.
Max masterclass 🔥😍🧡
You can’t fault maxs drive, but literally everyone bar Perez- who was on 40 odd lap old tyres, everyone else just moved out of the way, gasly nearly completely drove off the track to let him by,what’s happened to battling for position, moving out of the way is not really racing, DRS is killing real racing!
Was cold.
Red bull seems to hav to much speed on everyone bout time it was looked at seems there cheating
Les commentaires français sont pathétiques et le résumé pert tout intérêt.....ces gens n'y connaissent rien
There’s GOT to be something  illegal with that Red Bull… there’s no way
Another boring artificial “race”
I didn't used to like the old Alonso but am loving him these days! He's still one of the best!!
Les commentaires français sont pathétiques et le résumé pert tout intérêt.....ces gens n'y connaissent rien
No me gusta la F1 ahora  siempre los azulitos ganando
MISS YOU CROFTY
Boring race.....
Shocking camera angles for this GP
The announcer not being Croft had me tripping for the last 8:03
Alsonso is just insane, keep it up g
yesssssssssssssssss get in there you . yessssss yesssssssssss yessssssssssssss  lucky she would of killed me for putting that much money on a sport i hate and bared it from my home its a sure thing i keep telling her boooom yess cya next race max and red bull . and they call this a sport in parts of the world i don't care what they call it as long as the funds keep rolling in
Les commentateurs les plus nuls que j'ai jamais entendu 😂
Les commentateurs sont nuls...
This is what’s wrong with f1 today
Le commentaire français est nul il est endormi
What another dull race. F1 surely there are some decent tracks in America? Honestly driving around a car park regardless of all the gliltz and glamour its still just driving around a car park. Sorry but the whole thing is naff. Proper naff.
Proof that drs is a complete joke. Fake racing.
brfore i look i bet  a 1/2 for red bull yesterday only max needs to come 1st out of the 2 to get my bet
Please never use that commentator again.
verstappen updated every second about checo's strategy, tyre management  and position  checo's only vocal  the whole gp : is verstappen struggling in front ? hahaha i love redbull's engineers
Verstappen starting near mid pack and coming through for the win again, unreal! Congrats to Red Bull, dominant 2023 season so far!
Imppressive from Lewis
Really miss croftie's commentary ngl
0:43 - how is this car legit?  What's that speed?
The RB19 is one fast car. Newey has designed a perfect race car.
Driver of the Day: Max. And, this highlight couldn't afford a single line to appreciate Max than keep ranting on RBR is a rocket ship! pathetic morons.
FERARI'nin bu rezillikten tez zamanda çıkması lazım. Poll pozisyonunu bile koruyamıyor.
Max Redbull DRS is so performant it makes the other cars feel like snails
Another great 2nd place for Rubens... sorry, I mean Sergio
Perez was too kind to Max, if max goes to the outside I’d definitely run him out wide, team mates or not, make it hard work for him.
The Redbull car is disproportionally faster.
Verstappens ease of making up places hurt F1 today, the entertainment sufferes with sich advantage, same with Hamilton beforehand
F1 becoming boring again bc verstappen is winning every race
Whats the point of racing if you're just gona let other cars pass you.
This year is going to be the same as 2016. Then you had a fight betwene rosberg and hamilton. This year it's verstappen and perez
If Perez is Verstappen's Rosberg, we would expect Max to be seriously endangered. Let's see at the end of the season. But until now; it looks like Max outpaces Perez in three seasons straight. The RB is the fastest car, but Max also is the best driver on the grid. Coming back to my Rosberg comment, that season showed LH was at par with a mediocre driver, but driving an awesome machine. Bottas was a step down from Rosberg, and it showed in the results for LH.
Frankly, I'm just happy to see Nando up on the podium
Haas on par with Ferrari, never thought I'd see the day
Red Bull won, but Alonso is the real champion here
Sad, stroll turn 1 overtake praise by alonso not include in highlight
FERARI 'nin Lecrec'le falan bir yere gidemeyeceği kesin. Yollayın gitsin. Bunun yerine gerçekten şüphe varsa gaza bas diyecek bir manyağa ihtiyacı var.
😴😴😴
“I don’t think verstappen can comeback to p2” sergio perez
Is this commentary for the highlights? As its not on the actual race talk
alonso still in F1 makes me happy,, this result surpass my expectation
Alpine, anothe ashaming gp...
Verstappen is an alien
Verstappens car is a cheat code
I reckon Yuki will give max a challenge if he is in the red bull next year
This is literally the most boring sport on the planet. I so wished something interesting would happen with this starting grid, but it took 15 laps to revert to the exact same thing as the last 20 races.
If Lewis had won from 9th people would have started talking smack in the comments section saying its the car the race was boring how dumb biased and toxic can max fans be?🤣🤣🤣
Verstappen is a machine. The way he is connected to the car and track, simple amazing. And what a car... Starting to believe what Hamilton said about Red Bulls cars are the fastest he have ever seen, and faster than his previous WC Merc car.
Perez needs to sack his race advisor
On peut dire que le championnat est déjà plié. Red Bull demandera à Perez de lever le pieds à chaque fois que Verstappen sera derrière lui.
How f1 make a highlight show 8 mins long is beyond me
CROFTY come back
LOL redbull drs is destroying the race... so boring..
Another borefest. It’s looks like RB are racing F2 cars they’re that far in front. Give MV the title now and fast forward to next year.

Rocket ship
Max showing Perez who the world champion is and will be.
ZzzZZZZZzzZzZzzzZzzZZz ...
Está bueno que se incluya el español pero los cortes están un poco por ahí ¿No? Medios por decir chotos de mar vio señora
Performance....max will go down as an all time great for sure.... He is touched.
red bull with drs have a 500hp boost
This video should not be 8mins long.  1.5 max. That’s all that’s needed
VAMOS ALONSO! It is great to see you on the podium, smiling and having hilarious moments but it is P1 race after race which we all are waiting for. Let's go!
Are those 2 Red Cars Ferrari or Fiat Panda? So slow in the straight and nothing special in the corners... DIsaster. I knew after baku that the 3rd place was not relevant due to the circuit
Without redbull it would be quite interesting f1 season
"Its race on"🤓
Looking through your side mirrors just to see Max pushing you must be scary.
I feel sorry for the commentators that have to try and sound excited about this 😂
Alonso sempre più grande sta facendo il massimo con una macchina inferiore ma che si sta dimostrando molto buona 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Max was lapping faster on his 40 odd lap old hards than Perez on the same tyre. Absolutely insane stuff.
Bado nasubir ushind wa Hamilton namtakia kila la heri
That Verstappen was miracle in miami 😎 i have nothing to say what masterclass that was.
Not even a single yellow flag 😴
Its nice that Alonso ist doing great, but the Rest is just boring …
Nobody is even close to Verstappen
Boooooooooooooooooooooring
Max is doing a Hakkinen and I'm all for it.
Why don't we get the Sky commentary on the highlights anymore? Who are these people?
Rather a boring race for the neutral fans.
All Red Bull year 👏🔥🔥
I'm not sure if both redbull cars have equal performance. It can't be just the drivers.
I don't understand why Perez didn't do exactly what Max did: start with the hards and stay ahead, creating a gap in clean air. Then pit the lap after Max pits. He'd have won the race. Strategic mistake on his part, honestly. Max was amazing but Perez had the advantage and then some (1 vs 9, clean air vs having to overtake...)
Alonso getting podiums again is such a great thing to see, finally a team that's giving him a car to compete, what a legend.
This race confirmed that this season is gonna be very boring with Max now confirming that Checo will not really put up that big a fight for the WC
Max, take a bow!
Max Verstappen for the win!!
Boring
If this was a boxing match between Perez and Verstappen, the referee would have had to step in and stop the fight
He gave up his entering line "It's GO" 👏
What a dull season
That’s what happens when you have the best race car.. when your faster on the hardest tyre. Bit like Lewis in the merc when he won his 7 wdc. It will be the same for max. I think they should all be in the same car then we can really see who’s the best driver 🤷🏼‍♂️
Even Mazepin and Latifi would get 1-2 in that Red Bull. This car is incredible. Max and Checo are unbeatable in that monster
Give Alo an equal machine and watch Verstappen throw tantrums like a baby for the entire calendar
If Max had the 2nd best car, F1 would be as interesting as it was in 21. He will somehow get the pole and then will keep the 1st position through skill and shenanigans. He is clearly ahead of the entire field especially in race pace.
It was a fun race
There were highlights? 😴
No David Croft and Martin Brundle?
We need those crucial and WORKING Mercedes updates/upgrades. Perez unfortunately against all the pre-weekend hype will not give us the competition now so sorely lacking in F1
Verstappen ist so unsympathisch geworden!
Another dull race.
Quiero ver el vídeo en inglés, pero siempre se me pone en español, no entiendo nada
Max horseface Verstappen
Le Grand Prix le plus ennuyeux de ma vie
If only KMag had a better car.
As always, the difference between these cars are ridiculous..
F1 controls the amount of power any given driver has through ers. Not a single driver can race to his full potential if they don't want him to. Give it 10 years until you learn I'm right and then remember my name.
I think it’s time to switch back to the original commentators. There just isn’t any excitement really in watching these anymore.
Fell asleep during the race so now I have to watch this. What a snoozefest
The RedBull is like on reels… Crashtappen is easily overtaking everyone because its DRS Performance….
Ma dov'è finita la formula 1 di un tempo? Capisco lo spettacolo ma gli americani sono veramente ridicoli. Meno spettacolo intorno alla formula 1 e più spettacolo in pista...
Just a faster car lol back to the Mercedes days 😂😂😂
He is one of the top drivers of all time. He is a pure driver 👌🏻
Easy when you've got the best car.
レッドブルフォードで、パワーバランス取れるわ
You should get back to the skysports commentary on this
Membosankan!
Simply Lovely
Lewis driving that Mercedes from 13th to 6th was phenomenal. They were 5th fastest, even behind Alpine this weekend. Great job from George too. 👏
Boring season all over again...
honestly boring with the same car winning every race. the other teams need to get their act together. not even this boring when hamilton won with merc, they werent 20-40 seconds ahead every race
Gongrats to f1 to make such emotional championship,every race a different winner!
It's pointless watching with red bull.  No competition. Boring, predictable every race. Nobody is close to them. Season over already. Something has to be done to create competition.
Just give this year’s title to Max. Shame on F1 for making the sport such one sided 🤦🏻‍♂️
A masterclasse? 😅😅😅😅ok
Boooooring
Whyd they get rid of the old commentary team?
Nice to see Alonso on the podium
Je ne suis plus la formule 1 aussi assidûment qu'avant mais j'ai l'impression que Ferrari c'est de pire en pire on dirait
can we have crofty back plz
F1 is now boring. It's so predictable. I think MotoGP is now the real deal. Very unpredictable with more talented riders than that for F1 with almost zero talent but faster cars. Talent is prominent more on engineering than on the drivers.
If redbull makes roads car.... Ferrari merchandising will ends!!!
When you know that a team is going to win from the start its boring
Only one guy have the best car..n then, his fan claim he unbeatable driver... Such a clown..
Gratulation Weltmeister verstappen
RB delaying Max’s pit stop 1 sec and putting him right behind Perez: 🔥
Its extremely boring when one car is sooo much better than every car on the grid
Who hates max here?
Max simply the best
F1 2023 has become the worst & the most boring season to watch...
Now hopefully papa Perez will stop whining. His son isn't a match for Max
What happened to 'Away we go'? It's 'Race on' nowdays? lol
Being a Ferrari fan means pain
Ferrari so slow 😂
Even the highlights are boring...
Ferrari Is a disaster...
That is not called a race, behind everything.......! all know.......
Kmag scuffling with leclerc was super entertaining. Really showing how well he could do if only he had the equipment
There’s literally nothing anyone can do if the RB has DRS. Nothing. None of the cars can reach the same speeds it’s insane.
Max is a savage
Not being rude  But does anyone know where Crofty us
Boring race
Red Bull Are Wayyyyy Too OP
Who would have thought the massive car / rule changes would have led to racing becoming such a snooze-fest so quickly.. they need to do something to save this season as it’s just terrible to watch
Verstappen is no medicine
Perez goiabada. Vá pra cima porra.
Alonso!
As an F1 fan, I must say, Red Bulls are on another league, the car is a rocketship, Max casually passing everyone, DRS is a cheat at this point. Sad to see Mclaren in this state...
I feel sorry for Sergio. It's obvious to us all that Red Bull will do whatever to make sure Max wins. But that's F1 for ya! This had nothing to do with tire management. All those guys can manage tires. This had to do with team tactics and who THEY WANT TO WIN!   If you think Max just out drove Checo your ignorant!
Did Max had any pitstop in Miami gp?
I been rooting for super Max this season and he just been top notch with his performances. The tussle between k-mag and leclerc was really a heated one. What a great performance from K-mag
Bro called Charles a Frenchmen
Red Bull should compete in another league 😂
How to ruin a motorsport:-  Bring it to US of A.
max verstappen show
That’s crazy Alonso is always up in the top 5. The old man still has it! There’s hope for us old guys yet. 😊
It's amazing how Verstappen move from strength to strength in these past 3 years.
What happened to the original commentators?
Borring for redbull
La Ferrari, in questo campionato necessita di un pilota ad hoc...altro aspetto bisogna dare impulso al motore....che, da un po' di fastidi...forza Ferrari.
Finally,                                                THROUGH GOES HAMILTON!                THROUGH GOES LECLERC!
Honestly seeing other drivers never fight against RB since they know that they can't do nothing give me sadness..
Alonso is a great driver ❤
Leclerc gonna check in to therapy after this race
레드불 엔진이나 스펙이 다른듯.. 조사 해봐라 반감 시키네
verstapen mi je odvratan kao osoba ali je nevjerojatno koliko kasno može kočiti bez ikakvih problema
man what a snoozefest
Remember when Montoya said the drivers just let Schumi pass like they didn't even try? Well 1:19 it's just sad bro. Give a little bit of battle just for the show man.
How do Red Bull car are so fast!!
Who’s this new commentator?? I miss Crofty… much lower energy and excitement… he didn’t even catch the cars going off in turn 1 on lap 1…
Max= Phenomenal His Car= Absolute Beast
F1 2016 season nostalgia 😮 2016-Rosberg Vs Hamilton 2023-Perez Vs Verstappen
It's so refreshing not to have to listen to David Croft anymore. Thank you!
DRS snoozefest as per usual
As soon as Ferrari sacks Leclerc, they'd have a 99.9% chance in the championship (driver and constructor) Max was in fault when he pitted in the 47th lap, crossing the white line when he exit.
Perez too slow! How you gonna have 5+ and end up getting caught up! Dude needs to get his game up!
Now even the Haas able to took over the Ferrari.
Les commentateurs français toujours plus monotones
Max is just on another level
F1 is boring... Max or perez win way too easy, redbull should take 1 week off, no touching to car. that would make things more interesting
To the Red Bull team the drivers are men let dem fight love the battle…👌
guy with the finish flag was taking a nap. 7:12
Why is it always a different commentator in those highlights? Why isn't it Crofty?
Is Crofty no longer the commentator?
Who is this commentator? Where is the old one?
İ miss croft 😢
Pathetic by Perez, the true definition of a number 2 driver
Why dont we get David Croft's commentary anymore?
marilah RAKAM bacaan Al-Quran dalam bahasa Inggeris Melayu Indonesia dll dengarlah berkali kali bersama keluarganya marilah memahami tafsir AL-QURAN dengan PENGASIH dan PENYAYANG Allahuallam
It's fun to read so many bitter comments, either saying the race was boring or lauding some driver who finished in the top-10. All just not to give credit to MV who's head and shoulders above the rest of the pack.
Aston Martin are getting amazing performance out of the Mercedes engine
I remember perez was saying @skysportsF1 that he never will see max and will do he's own race.     Hahahaha Max give him masterclass
Checo : "is max struggling?""  Christian : Nope
6:03 "The crowd are roaring". The cheers are getting less and less. That's what happens when a driver starts getting too dominant. It became the same with Schumacher and Hamilton.
This was an awesome race, also really liked the Miami racetrack and scene over all, can’t wait to see how Las Vegas will look
commentaires d'une banalité affligeante : "ouh la, la" " il faut faire attention" "Incroyable quand meme"... etc. Quelle est la valeur ajoutée de ce mec ?
Alonso 🎉🎉
The way max overtakes per to take the lead, i can assure he knows well per, that guy wont do anything aggresive to jeopardize team result. If perez really wants to be a world champ, he need to think more about himself rather than the team as a whole.   Max simply squeeze in as he comes into the corner knowing well per will slow down to avoid collision.   If it were Charles, Vettel, Schu, during their prime fighting for championship,  max probably would have spare more space on the inside, knowing well these guys dont simply give up their position or they may have collided.
Bring back the Sky Sports commentary team for the highlights video. Crofty and Brundle are excellent.
un grand merci pour la diffusion mais surtout en Francais
F1 is boring atm same team dominating Saturday and a Sunday given up watching it
So nice not having Crofty and Brundle lol
Better than I expected & also better than the inaugural race. Red Bull dominance at its best, but what a race for Mclaren. I counted they got screen time three times after the early pit stops. Soft as the start compound was a failed gamble, so nothing really went right for them. Leclerc’s struggle was weird. Perhaps Saturday’s errors had some impact on his driving. Tough for Sargeant to end up driving alone for most of his first home race.
This is the most boring f1 season since ferrari dominated with Schumacher
FIA: Close, competitive racing RB DRS: Nope. Frr tho, that thing is a rocket at this point. Your best bet against an RB is to keep it over a second behind
Why wasnt perez a minute up the road by the time max overtook 9 other cars? Told to play wingman or really that slow? Dissapointing would love to see him challenge
A race that desperately needed appearances by the safety car.
To think Perez thought he was in the same class as Verstappen. Max giving Checo a masterclass in driving.
Incredibly, incredibly boring race.
Max ❤️❤️❤️
Should bring someone else in the team to replace sainz...but dont know who will be that 🤦🏽🤦🏽🤦🏽🤡🤡🤡
Menunggu mercy bisa nyaingi RB😊😊 kyk 2020 rame banget
yawn
What a shet show!
F1 commentary in an American accent sounds so bad after listening to Crofty's magic of words
I hope rosberg vs hamilton also happened for verstapen vs checo, they crash eachother n lose points, then at the end of season alonso come out of nowhere becoming champ 🤣🤣🤣🤣
These commentators sounds very weak 😢
just let max over take you the bookies have him to win big pay out for us all. Boring race
Max play career mode 50%
Can someone explain me pls!  I watch f1 here and there and I remeber this L. HAMILTON being champion and being called the greatest-fastest, but today he was stuck in 13th position for so long?  So were those who said its only car right pls explain?
Verstappen: "EZ!"
Anyone like to see DRS banned
I miss Martin brundle & David croft
"What position is Lance now ?... Great move in turn 6 (or 16?)..."  Commentator: "How did he know....??!"  🤣🤣🤣 CMIIW
I wonder what can be done to make F1 interesting again.
From being the best car on the grid to fighting a Haas for the entire race, what was Ferrari doing in the winter break,Eating pizzas?
Nice to see Alonso back in Podium this season
Whoever's idea it was to host an F1 race in a car park needs sacking
Obviously Red Bull doesn't care about paying another measly $7m fine again... I'd imagine by the end of this season we learn about a new technology that will be banned next year.
My man Magnussen!
These British commentators are very vindictive to the driver that dethroned their Hamfisty or had comments on their Rusboy.
Ferrari has a very big work to do, the car is so slow and disappointing
阿龍嫂真的很猛啊！
I feel like some scandal is going to develop on the redbull cars being ridiculous fast. Something just doesn’t add up, so so soo much quicker
👍👍👍
not one yellow flag the whole race crazy!
Gila sih 🙃
i feel i came back to 2010's redbull
Yawn
What a boring race.....
HAAS 🔥🔥  Yess..!! Lewiss..!! Thank you
Defending anyone : close the inside   Defending Max : open the inside
The Red Bull is something else. The lack of defending against the RedBull is something else again! 🥱 💤
And another 1-2 for RB - boooooring!!!!
Max, the number 1 F1 pilot. He is by far the best pilot, he proves that again and again.
Wait, Lewis is in forth place in the championship? How?
such a boring sport! how on earth is entertaining one who has such a powerful car that wins even if he starts from his house?
F1 need to focus on racing again, and not bringing in money. More people should watch MotoGP. Redbull need to replace Checo with someone that can actually challenge Max. And McLaren need a reality check.
por que no salió con duros checo para terminar con medios, no entendi la estrategia de red bull
Max ...magic 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I may not like Crofty very much, but his lights out and away we go is iconic. He does hype up the race start really well and I would just love it if we could have that back. The new commentators are alright but nobody matches Crofty's energy during the race start!
The one horse race keeps going (boring) 40 seconds ahead at 40 lap. Pointless watching unless if you are a red bull supporter and even then the cameras are not waisting their time showing red bull circulating.
Yawn!!
Watched first 30ish laps. Was literally falling asleep on the sofa by lap 37. Went to bed, woke up fresh, checked phone and saw the exact top 5 I expected. This is akin to a board game where there's an obvious winner early on but "etiquette" says everyone else has to stick around to finish the game.
We swopped merc dominance for bull dominance. This is so boring.  You watch the first 15 laps and you know the rest of the race.
It's almost as if Max's redbull has some cheat codes enabled 😂😂
Boooorrrrinnng!
Kmag bullied charles
Boriiiing!!!!
Guys, where's Crofty???? Haven't heard him for races now...
These are getting dull. Who else is getting sick of Red Bull and Verstappen?
Man Albon what happened
This the most boring, it’s like there is no competition, max wins basically every race🫤
Hoy vi la carrera por Fox sports y este relator no era Quien comentaba la carrera.
Disappointment for Perez he didn't really give challenge to Max even with a lot of advantages
ZzzzzZzzZz
Ferrari nowhere, dissapointing.
2023.05.08.             7:28
Most expensive Motorsport and most boring.
Boooooooring
😎
😎😎😎😎👌👌👌👌
BORING as batsh*t
Nice 🥰🤩😎👍🏁🏁🏁 Congrats Alonso 😊👍
The sheer difference between money power, Verstappen's skill versus the rest of the field makes them just avoid any contact at all with Verstappen. No fighting at all.
Você é foda Alonso! Parabéns!!!!
Red Bull troppo superiori alle altre… di  conseguenza ogni gara è scontata, e ancora di più il mondiale.
Why did it take so long for Charles to get past mag ? 😂
bring back old commentary 😅😅
Really thought Checo would take Miami with Verstappen gearing off from P9!  Still hoping for Checo to win his first WC this year....
The rivalry we wait for: Charles vs Max The rivalry we get: Charles vs Kmag
Kenapa saya lebih suka suara presenter yang dulu dari pada yang sekarang.
What a fightback for Max Verstappen 👏 😄
Appreciation comment for Alonso and K-Mag. Brilliant drives ! P.s Max is coming close to what Sebastian used to do in RB
Redbull cheaters
If ferrari could do what rb did to them in 2019 , cuz that's the only way to slow rb down
Nice track.
Nice. But why F1 cars always has a big difference in terms of numbers of time in the final results??? Is it really normal???
F1 is fun if you dont care about drivers on P1 and P2
Leclerc is very disappointing
Wanna make F1 truly interesting? Put Leclerc in Perez's seat and give Alonso the Spare car.
La mejor narración ❤
Another boring race
Reality check for Perez 😂
this guy is painful to hear
Whats the excuse for 7 times champion?????? oh yeah must be the car again
Verstappen you amazing🎉🎉❤❤❤
Verstappen is out of this world....to keep up with his teammate on such old tires while Peres got new!!!! And Ferrari, listen what I tell you for years. Don't hire an Italian race director. Use a German/ Austrian or a British......
Exhausted from sky sports commentary. How can I get these gents
No wrecks?
MAD MAX 🎉
Well I used to like Charles but now I believe he is such an overrated driver
Please stop this unfair DRS, it is frustrating who is in front to see somebody overtake him with hands down! Ridiculous! Years 80/90 that was real F1 race where the engine power was dominating the scenario.
Another podium for SuperFernando.  I see a bright future for this young man.
BRING BACK CROFTY IN HIGHLIST
Ferrari should just pull out of f1 and continue on WEC
It’s crazy that max not only did 45 laps on the hard but managed to open the gap from 15.300 to 18.400 within 5 laps to secure his close pit exit behind Perez. Newey and Honda have really built a rocket ship.
this is what happens when the rules get changed to suit your car
Miss you seb
Drs rules needs a big change
Why can’t McLaren build a competitive car?
Let's we honest we all are happy because of Alonso on podium....
Budget CAP
Wow, who made this highlights to 8minutes long deserve an Oscar!
Done well to make this an 8 minute video.. awfully boring race.
I'm so excited to see Alonso finish in P2 very soon ! And if he gets 1 win, this will have made 2023 Alonso's year (even if hes not the champion)
Why is it on different languages
F1 should just stop wasting time and crown Max with the driver's championship. Exclude them from races, then we have an exciting season. Whoever has the most points wins the F1.5 driver's chip
They played Perez again. That RB is just a rocket ship, great drive by Max but it’s not like he had a choice but to drive past everyone
REDBBULL SHOWING FORMULA1 IS JOKE😂😂😅EVERY DRIVER IS A STANDING DUCK.. IS IT MAX QUALITY DRIVING OR..
Mclaren si not racing is only macking money
masterclass indeed
It’s so boring.
Boring
Honestly, its a rare sight to see no DNF at all
Miami 23 was a great race.
Congrats to Sergio and max amazing drive by max like come on 9th to 1st 🎉. Hamilton gains 6 places soo yay! The anticipation while watching Charles and kmag fighting for position was just too much but it was firee.
Y este título en español y también pusieron a Fernando tórnelo increíble
How boring was that. Verstrapon wins again and again.
Boring race again
BOOORING!
Solid finish for Alpine 🇫🇷
Zzzzzzz.
I dont like Verstappen but i have to admit...How he racing and overtake everybody its on another level...Doesnt matter from where he start the race still Winning !!!
I love it when he said “Like an F1 game on a playstation set to eassssyyyyy~~~” 😂
mclaren moment
So Miami is a great GP tbh. Pretty entertaining AND clean race. Hope this track is here to stay
Viva Alonso IDOL!
2:04 the redbull is insane!
Commentators really do need this practice setting. I suppose it's a plan to give new commentators are chance to develop their craft. It's really not working out guys. Please do that behind closed doors
What a performance by K MAG
Gooo honda
This is how a race should be, no DNF, no SC, no yellow flag, some nice overtakings (by Max) and an Alonso whos watching the race while driving in it
Felt as if we were watching an f2 race with max only with a f1 car 😂
And for al the Mecixans🖕🖕🖕, happy burrito day.
surely Max did what Lewis did in Brazil 2021. set engine mode higher to crush Perez's dreams but will take extra engine penalty later on in the season.
Glad that Alonso finally made a correct career move. Hope he wins again before retiring.
the red bulls just unfair now
Fall asleep……again. 😊
Max with Max 💯points!
Sergio can't dance with Max.
soooo boooring
How did they stretch this to 8 min…
Tbh it is getting less exciting race by race
Where are the english commentators ?
I'm not a Max fan. But atleast not a boring race.
Every time alonso get on podium this season is a win for F1 fans around the world
Quite an enjoyable race after baku
Aye it's ridiculous how fast Verstappen car is it was not a match for anyone. I dont think he needed to make a pit stop. Redbull the only ones that knows the cheat code.
Looks like another season of Red Bull dominance ahead.
Is it just me of Buxton's commentary is missed 😪
😴
Boring banget liat F1 REDBULL terlalu OP
Nice track, wide enough for overtakes. And then there Monaco(((
I fell asleep yesterday so i gotta watch the race today. Im prolly better off at Formula 2 ngl
This race had highlights?😮
In my opinion, I believe Hamilton should’ve got driver of the day. A lot of tricky overtakes with a less powerful car. Shame Leclerc got stuck in the midpack for some time.
Boring..
why is there no longer David Croft as a commentator?
Again Perez given wrong tires 😡😡😡😡
Imagine Alonso and Max in RB together
Perez and Hamilton need to leave their team
Why Leclerc is so slow 🥺🥺
Leclerc lost tow positions in one corner!!!
why don't we get the tv announcers anymore on these highlights?
Why does alonso keep getting penalties. Literally this year is just redbull winning
i rlly want to perez win the wdc cuz i hate max
2:16 Bro that commentary is crazy 💀
Where is Crofty?? 😢
Move out Norris! McLaren is such a disaster and not deserve you
Such a boring race, predictable one too. 😴🥱
What is DRS?
Max On HARDs Overtaking Everyone was just Amazing.  Class of his Own
Congrats to make this video 8 min long. You earned your promotion.
This is always the best-shot race of the year.  The camera crew does a great job.
Can’t wait for the next Netflix episode
The commentary is so bad!
Why nobody talking Max made fastest lap with hard tire?
let's not forget that there were no safety cars no DNF
Fernando Alonso giving a master class on racing! he is such a treat to watch battle on track! consistent performance and perhaps... maybe another world championship to his name?
Why don't you call it redbull highlights 😤😤??
la solita vecchia F1 ottima come soporifero... meno male che c'è la MotoGp!
Bull vs Bull ❤
didnt they ban standind up on the pitwall fence?
Boring
Its not max its the car
Nice teammates pass with the bulls
Wow Verstappen takes crazy risk. Overtakes Perez on the outside and gets away without Perez driving into the side of him. Russel  and his team mate should go have a word with Perez to find out how that works.
Verstappen the best there ever is and ever will be
Mclaren jus fell💀💀💀💀💀💀
Alonso's pace is something we can't explain
Honestly this is just absolutely junk
Whatever happened to the commentators we had the last few years? These new commentators dont have that same juice.
Ferrari lost power
The American commentator was nice, cancelled out some of the British bias and gave where credit was due.
This year, i will straight drag the highlight video to the last minute. I already know who is the winner.
ver-per-alo is the new ham-ver-bot
Max 💪💪
Experience counts for everything.  💫
Boring race
Well, at least we know that the PU in the Haas is very close to the same in the Ferrari.
GIVE alonso redbull car, he will gonna world champion for third
Max is not human
That commentating was lack-luster at best.
If i'm not mistaken, this is the 12th or 13th race in f1's history where there are no dnfs👏
I am VER fan but F1 is getting a tad boring and predictable, I would love to see more competition at the front of the grid.
Ferrari looks very easy to ovetake by another 😎😎
Boooooooorrrriiiinnngggggg
What's a bored race again ! Look a Redbull.
😴 fest
even the highlights are boring
Alonso deserves to win a race but barring a double red bull retirement it will be simply impossible, that car is racing in a league of its own
Max overtaking his teammate with the same car shows real talent on track and who is superior driver, max has literally shut down haters with whatever they say 🔥😷🏎️
Not even a Red Bull would beat Verstappen's Red Bull!
BRING CROFTY BACKKKKKKKKK!!!!!
yet another sorry day for Ferrari
Redbull cars are on another level. If alonso had the same car, max would find it very difficult to win
Sick of all these Alonso comments 🙄
Maxs car is much much quicker than any other car on the track. The exit speed it has from the corners compared to the rest is insane
Red bull car like rocket
The commentary is mixed too high. I can't hear the cars!
Over it. Max can start in 19th and still win. No doubt he's a great driver, but sport is supposed to be competitive...thats why we watch and get invested, but nothing competitive about F1 at the moment. Not even half way through the season and the most interesting discussion is who's gna finish second. Hard to buy that the RB is just that much faster
It is redbull this and redbull that.  "Oh that car is so dominant", why is it  that max is so much faster than checo???? It's the car, is it not?
Vamos Nanooo 🔥🇪🇸
Shljapa kakaja to
Nice looking track!
the only thing you missed was a great NASCAR race
I love F1 racing but hoenestly I think im about done watching. There needs to be changes its just not even fair. the same teams win every single race. There is no skill diference. my gram could get in a redbull car and win a race. there is just too much off a gap its a shame. gets boring watching a bunch of rich kids                  racing around a track when you dont even have to watch it to know whos going to win.
Who asked for this goofy american commentator, get rid of him
I really hope AM gives Alonso a championship challenging car next year. Yes it’s so great to see him be the best of the rest, but the way he’s driving, he deserves one last try at a third WDC. Also, who wouldn’t want a Max vs Nando championship battle?! That would be crazy.
Hello
Loka like max ready to sned it if checo block
bring back David Craft and Martin Bundle please. the current commentators are boring as F
so bored to watch Bring Back V10
How you’ve managed to get 8 minutes of highlights out of the most boring race in F1 is a miracle
Alonso ❤😊
Super impressed w/ K-Mag. Top stuff there. RBRs were in a different league to the rest, well deserved win for Max and Sergio.
The RB is so far ahead of the other cars it’s ridiculous. Doesn’t matter the conditions, that car is wicked fast. Both drivers also really seem to understand the car. Meanwhile Alonso is absolutely shutting down the haters. This guy is old enough to be everyone’s dad and is driving the Aston like its a RB.
Ham Bot Ver.            Now its Ver  Per Alo
3 Cars Redbull here, i mean 1 car Redbull watermelon in 3rd
I don’t Even Watch the race anymore Red Bull is just so much faster. Alonso gets my vote rn he’s so fun to watch
the commentators find it hard to talking up, probably need to do highlight of highlights to be exciting, and consider BOP to stop redbull p1 p2
Everybody who beat Hamilton must be transphobic for running (driving?) away from him…
F1 🥱😴
why this new commentary??
why do they look so slow
People like to overrate Charles just a little bit, Sir Lewis Hamilton started 6 places behind and dominated him and is still vastly superior even in a worse car..
Does Max choose newbie difficulty mode for every race?  Started at 8th
Essa foi a pior bandeirada de chegada q eu já vi...
This lets us see the hype around Perez is fake!! He has no chance against Max👋
Why dint Checo push his hard tyres??? Max had pushed his old hards enough to create a ~18secs advantage
Im happy for alonso
Better then a sleeping pill 😊
Best drive goes to K-Mag!! Fought like an animal. F1 needs to have a post season spec race for the WDC LOL. Or half the season is WCC and the other is WDC in spec cars.
DRS is making overtaking to easy.
We want crofty back
Anyone else wondering why no one can get close to RBR? It's becoming a bit of a joke sorry but the race was boring...again.
VER PER ALO is the new HAM BOT VER
Russel for a moment thought P2 was in his hands😂😂
I don’t like max, but you gotta respect him
Embarrassing.
They need to be more enthusiastic with the checkered flag. 🤓
VER PER ALO is the new HAM VER BOT
We see that nothing is working for Leclerc at the moment
What a Boring race.  Too Boring for my likening.
Awesome 18 more races to find out who comes in 3rd place for the season...
لما يوصل الفرق من اول اللفة ٣٠ ل لاكتر من ٢٥ ثانية يبقى دي ما بقتش سباق فورملا   بحس دايما انها لعبة موجهة  السنين اللي فاتت كانت عربيات مرسيدس   و حاليا ردبول  كأن معاهم عربيات اقوى ب ١٠٠ حصان على الاقل   ايه السهولة اللي بيريز و ماكس بيعدوا بيها اي عربية دي ؟؟
Not much cashes but still mildly entertaining
Has anyone heard about that guy Hamilton, who is paid too much, overhyped and still not a racer, but only able to win, when he's given an unbeatable car..?
Genuinely turned off half hour before the end and went to watch the btcc highlights.  What a boring track within a boring season.
WHERE IS CROFTY
Alonso 👏
That Red Bull must be dodgy? Just like their Championship the last 2 years! Winning at the cheating game? Hmmm
Bring back 🐐ifi
When you will bring David Croft's voice back?
Was great to see 😂 redbull race lol
The Redbulls are so strong it’s not even funny to watch. Way to easy for them…
Red bull is incompatible . Way poor performance of Ferrari is going on. One sided shows going on by only Red Bull & F1 become charmless.
You go to McLaren, then realize Alpine has a better car and karma serves you lol.
Mercedes is probably the biggest tractor even with the new supposedly upgrades..lewis must find a new team
Can someone decode whats happening to Ferrari's.. looks like even i can overtake them in my Maruthi Suzuki..less pace or poor tactics (as usual)..
Lewis was on fire 🔥🔥
Perez knows his place again lol
With the last decade or so of big team dominance P3 became the fans P1.
Fernando Alonso  is performing that Aston Martin like crazy.. people were doubting him , he shut them alright..
boring...
სვარკა 95%
IN THIS RACE: - A trio of Latinos get robbed on American soil. - Our hopes for a title fight get violently crushed. - And LL Cool J reminded us of his existence.
Perfect Alonso Wonderful Magnussen Poor Ferrari and Merc
Legend has it Leclerc still trying to get around that HAAS
MAX COSTCAPPEN LET'S GOOO!!
When people said they were tired of Mercedes dominating F1 I think they meant they wanted competitive racing, not just a different team dominating.
K Mag living his best life out there fighting with a Ferrari :))
DRS is not real racing.
Le sucrage de verstappen c’est trop la voiture lui permet c’est tout
Disappointing race RB cheats
It's race on?  Do you mean it's lights out???? 😢
FIA have to start looking at the RB that’s not all max look at Lewis useless car and driver can do nothing.
Other boring race, i still miss 2021
Not having same performance cars is why F1 now looks boring to watch except the redbullies  rivalry..
I am proud of myself that l didn't watch yesterday. Otherwise l can't sleep along all night. Why Red Bull is better than other teams? What is the problem for teams?
Both Red Bulls car are in different league then rest of the cars in main races
RB that car is defo not legal it has too much of an advantage in every way.
Doubtful sheer engine power of Honda magic
Vamos los relatos latinos 🎉
MAX VERSTAPPEN.
Alonso ❤
Air Max Verstappen..from 9th to 1st place.Congrats Max Verstappen,Sergio Perez and Red Bull Honda.Amazing race.
AI level at 50
Why Christian why do you have to know what Honda has inside of the engine when they are giving you championship every year. I just don’t understand
Max that was an INSANE one of your best WINS well done! Sending you a big HUG for that one you are the world Champion!
I don’t know why you need to know what Honda has inside of the engine when your doing so great
죽어라 좀 막스
Bring back refueling. Thatll spice things back up again in this sport. Last season was boring, this one is boring. Even though perez is putting up a fight we all know horner will not let him win.
Who couldn’t win with a car 1 second faster than anyone else 🙄
Alonso podium again, go Legend, Miss you podium number 1 💪
Verstapen car is like a cheat haha
Its like he is playing F1 on a Playstatio and the difficulty is 20
The leading team has so much pace and speed gap between it and the next one again (after Mercedes 2014-2020). Formula 1 has failed again.
Qué linda voz tiene Fernando Tornello. Es muy icónico
Still asking my selfe what happend to lights out and away we go....
WHY NO CROFTY??
I miss old F1 when F1 driver push to the limit to overtake, like Montoya did, now they just push the DRS button
For a dry race, it was pretty dull Had Max qualified top 3 this race would have been over after 5 laps instead of 21
Wyścig
Is there point of watching Red Bull this season ?
Ferrari is back to where they were... Top 6 performance once again... Disappointing and seeing how Leclerc struggle to get past Magnussen, our cars need some work...
Boring F1
For someone who has been watching F1 forever.  I do not like the way they are trying to make it more American.  Who cares about the celebrities that show up.  The drivers and the teams are the celebrities.  Miami is my least favorite race to watch.
Kenapa ferrari x laju sekarang
Pretty sure it'll be a 1 - 2 finish for RedBull till the end of the season. Really CAN'T see any other competitors matching their pace.
Pueden eliminar este circuito del calendario es demasiado aburrido la peor carrera 😴😴
Hanya nonton sampai 3 laps saja, karena mata nya sangat mengantuk, untuk wilayah indonesia, balapan di mulai jam 3 subuh
Easy to win for verstapen 😂
F1 isn't even fun to watch.  It's obvious that the cars are all not even close to eachother.
f1 is so boring  😭😭😭😭😥😥
Gotten to the point where no one even attempts to fight the Red Bulls. Makes more sense for every other car to save battery/tires
I used to love max, not anymore
Until unless Checo is within 0.15s from Ver, Checo cannot win the grand prix. This week the diff was huge
Ya me canse de ver la formula 1, ya no tiene sentido verla, si hasta los comentaristas ya dicen quienes van a ganar, y mas aun ver una gran escuderia como Ferrari hacer tantos errores y a sus pilotos haciendo lo mismo igual que mercedes, quitan la emocion de ver lo que hacia a uno quedarse despierto para ver lo que era antes grandes batallas ..........
Phenomenal performance from Super Max. That double overtake and P9 to P2 runs were as perfect as they can get. Alonso was amazing in non-redbull category.
bro bring back crofty commentry mate
Haas battling Ferrari was such a wholesome moment!
Max 👍👏
when theres a boring race because of a boring track theres verstappen to show us a clean 9-10 to first so we got at least some content
Amazing the years 2023 for Fernando Alonso and Team Aston Martin in the best the Challenge 💫💫💫
If i remember correctly checo wasn't told about Max laptimes but Max was given all the info. Just hope they give checo a chance
White Dog Max…..  u will be this👨‍🦽🧑🏻‍🦽👩‍🦽after next race
Maxxxxxxxx ❤❤❤
Haa f1 postala sranje
Even the highlights bore me
Win or Lose, Mercedes and Petronas always in my heart.
Redbull with Honda engine is crazy
Semua nya hanya pengulangan dengan pemeranbyg berbeda itu saja, balapan ttp boring ujung ujungnya, sdh bisa dibtebak sapa juara 1,2,3 nya
The performance of the drivers was beyond formula 1 , but the performance of the commentator was under formula 3
Ferrari 💔
Ferrari getting more slower evey year amazing......
Ferrari who? Used to be a big fan during Schumacher era, now they are a laughing stock team. Unbelievable poor performance
Congrats to Max, Perez you gave Max to much respect - You should have trusted your pace more and not saved so much, and Lewis... If the potential is there, you WILL make a difference. Mega work today.
Amazing Max And Checo
Max just put Checo in his place.
F1 have become so boring
I'm starting to see a pattern here
For such a poor weekend leading up to the race, George and Lewis really had a great day — definitely the best results we could have hoped for considering the circumstances. Fantastic strategy from George and his team and a masterful recovery drive from 13th for Lewis.
Boring commentary🥱
DRS
is going to be crazyyyyyy! 20s gap
Take away of the race -  Alonso drive fabulously as always but end up +20sec behind RedBull bc of monstrous car.  Lewis Hamiliton overtaked Leclare 🫡😎
RB19 is too fast... F1 on cheat code
Would of been great if all cars could actually race each other, and we’d have different winners each week. Would make the title race much, much more exciting than watching this…
Ohh... where're all the Max haters gone? After the previous race, all them cave dwellers came out in droves. It's funny that some even suggest Checo is better than Max. He got all the time out in front and Max need to go pass traffic. YET, Max able to pass him to win the race.
Alonso for WC 2023
Just remember that Ferrari dropped Vettel in favour of Leclerc.........
Alonso ！ 🎉
Vasp psp mode W in a 1-2 Red bull dominance again..😭
Just wonder, why Perez did not pit for a fastest lap point which he has nothing to lose coz Alonzo more than 20 seconds behind.
where are Princess Crymilton fans?
Same result, boring game, don't waste ur time
COST CAP CHAMPIONS!!!
Super max.
gg Red Bull. GR
What a boring season. Regulation change have made it extremely boring and predictable. Almost no wheel to wheel racing.
Max Verstappen is Amazing,start p9 finish p1
At this point Just force Verstappen start 20 for interest of racing
Still not okay with this guy commentating the race ....
What a disappointing race from Mclaren. It seemed like both drivers did not have any motivation or hunger at all
snoozefest
On croirais que L'analyste étais au golf la semaine dernière. Je pourrais m'endormir à l écouter. Au Québec on as un commentateur de hockey qui fait la F1. IMPOSSIBLE DE S'ENDORMIR.
this is why i prefer this commentary over crofty, hes just so much more animated! even though the one making actions isnt a british driver 🤗🤗🤗
Max is the best driver in tha world superb..
❤
Redbull is op as f
Awkward and boring. Stop the circus and put your money elsewhere. This is the end of Formula 1, now Formula E is better.
Ferrari and Mercedes struggle with dame problems
WHERE IS CROFTYYYY 😭😭😭😭
Mighty Max
Now we just saw that new world driver championship no one can win😭
i think F1 is better across city streets like Baku Monako. why they biuld sach a massive place for F1 when they could eide through Miami streets.
There is no f1 race completed without a crash... atleast one i expected
This is getting ridiculous…
You should’ve watch the nascar Kansas race so much better then this
0:50 "You came like a torpedo..." 😏😝
Wow alonso moving back up nice
Max is driving in Easy Mode In F1 Now
I miss the old announcer, he was much better
F1 TV commentary is so terrible compared to Crofty
Alonso best driver always
Ferrari sould retire F1 IT IS SAME FULL TO SEE HOW THEY CANT WIN ANEY MORE
I guess Daniel R. Wasn't the problem...
Q le metan los dedos a otro, pero Red Bull le acomodo todo a Verstapen..... sabotaje total
this commentator is so bad, no passion at all
Ferrari should sell their cars to any other teams, no fighting at race
So F1 has reached new levels of boring - last 10 years have been 1 sided but this is like putting 2008 Barcelona in the championship and expecting anything interesting to happen. Something has to change or I'm done caring
What can they do to make the cars more even? So many years it looks like 75% is the car with the rest the driver and strategy.
Es increíble la estrategia q le dieron a Checo... me fuma dijo numa
Personally i prefer it in english, idk why its french now, the english commentator is much more interesting to hear
Another very exciting race!
Man McLaren is so bad this year
I just want Sky Sports commentators
Where is Crofty
This just goes to show you that Lewis Hamilton is not a true world champion. Russell is making him look like an amateur.
Please get rid of DRS!!! The cars have shown they can overtake without DRS, at this point it makes the sport look completely artificial.
Boooorriiiiiinnggg😢😢😢
Giler laju Max...well done for not crashing ur team mate 😊
It's just that the new rule favours red bull
Máx está  en otra liga,, por lo visto hoy con ese nivel Pérez no le podrá competir.
Most boring season
Strange how a year ago we were wondering what the Miami gp would be like  And we've had 2 already
F1 2023 👎
Chepo casi lo logra vencer, tendrá cuidado en las curvas para rebasar
KMag definitely deserves better than 10th. Great aggressive driving!
Why verstapen car more fastest than the other?
US commentators are really ruining the otherwise excellent racing experience... 😢
Should be every race in French too
Give him the World Championship already
Boring and again boring
The MAX Force.
Perez showing that he is indeed #2 driver
Checo was too slow on the Hards...he should have pushed much more and reduced the gap to Verstappen. Even with the better tyres he is not able to catch Max...forget catching him with worse.
The next engines Ferrari deliver to Haas are gonna be made of paper mache
F1 is back! To boring...
If you cant appreciate Max' superb driving, you dont understand Formula 1 and you are just bitter supporters. Even the rest of the grid can acknowledge his talent
Great class from Max congratulation MAX from 9Th to the TOP
It's becoming a cliche now. Max P1, Checo P2, Fernando P3
Feels like the old days, when there were 2 races happened in the same track. One is the battle between two leading drivers from the same team, the other race is between other drivers
Perez is a joke compare to Max.... very sad to see.
hadeuh berharap ada perlawanan dari tim lain malah makin jauh tertinggal
It's hurt to be Mclaren fan right now. Their inconcistency is beyond help now. Audi should enter through Mclaren.
MV is on a league of his own. Literally the best driver of this Generation
Boring
Big ups K Mag
Check-hard, Max-medium, why?
Alonso already having more points than his whole year at Alpine last season lol
\MAX/\MAX/\MAX/
Bring back Crofty and Brundle, pleasee!!!!
Loved the kmag and charles battle..... but Red bull just makes Ferrari look like a tractor than a race car.
Bruh really said verstappen was playing the PlayStation game
Alonso has been the best veteran driver after he left Alpine.
As a sport it’s far too easy, no false, to over take.
Just give the championships to Redbull at this point 😴
Hamilton warra driver
f1 does not need drs anymore
I guess Mercedes is out of competition again for this year huh? I'm a Mercedes fan but.. well gotta face the facts.
Surprise, another 1,2. Zzzzzzzz.
Poor commentator I’ll take Croft’s over this
Perez is far too passive to be driving a Redbull. Losing to his team mate who started 9th is terrible. Out paced on the hards, out paced on the mediums.
This trio was happy celebrating together and i happy for them but I did want to see others new on podium. I miss to hear the nostalgic moments of screaming😆Nando could be that when he drive to 1st position. "What have you do, we have we done”!! but that Gasly😁KMAG drive was fire👌🏻
It was boring when it was Mercedes and it's boring with Redbull, happy for alonso though. The RedBull is just on another level on the straights the engineers of that car are amazing,
Who is this B squad of commentators. Where did crafty go in all these recaps
Such a nice feeling to see Hamilton out of the podium. All those years morons thinking he was the main reason and not the car that was doing the winning.
RB and Aston are sharing data and it's a low-key shady British backdoor deal
Max gonna to stroll to the title again this season. Driver and car performing at a very high level
Every race it gets more boring
Well, Time for Lance to quit F1... No even a # 2 can  be that far. The kit is not a bad person but this is enough. And I am Canadian.
Will alonso fight for 2023 secound place?
I mean it’s just boring. Max didn’t need to hard race anyone, breezes past with so much more speed. Zzz
Vettel is watching this and he is saying "I quit to early"
Where’s Crofty?
Red Bull is still unbeatable again  and will be  rest of this year
Verstapen DRS is so performant compared to all other drivers, even compared to his team mate, weird….
I was hoping Red Bull's special livery curse would get them again only for them to get another 1-2
Wow the same team winning... again... Indycar is 100% better than this trash.
Back to back to back to back to back podiums for Alonso!!! What a party. Well done.
Verstappen, Checco and Alonso... this is how the who season is going to go
If Max comes from P10 to P1 , why can't Perez just pull away from being P1 at the start? Someone explain please
How yall not find this boring?
what a dull race
How many races before people concede that Ricciardo wasn't the problem at McLaren
Much rather Crofty on these highlights
Just remove drs already, this is pathetic
It really is sad to watch teams like McLaren and Ferrari struggle and max start 9th and effectively run away with the GP f1 has kind of become boring, although fair play to alonso he's defying all olds
Commentary is bad
Sergio 🤐🤐🤐
1:15 if it was Hamilton Your lines would be What a driver what a talent
Hamilton putting in a strong performance going from 13th to 5th. Making sure that Mercedes can still make a run at it if they get things figured out. Imagine Verstapen and Hamilton shooting it out in evenly matched cars!

New rule f1 ..redbull start when he begin use helmet
Man that battle between Kmag and Leclerc. And crazy performance by both Verstappen and Redbull. And I'm so happy Alonso also is back on podium .
Borring
🙏  Congratulations to Max Verstappen , Sergio Perez ( Redbull F1 Team ) & Fernando Alonso  ( Aston Martin F1 GP Team ) for taking the Podium Positions in this Miami F1 GP 2023 Race!  🎉🌷🌿🌍💜🕊
Çane m'intéresse plus à la prochaine je finis avec indy car
Yuki is best beast🐻🦊
Piastri regretting jumping into F1 right about now... Maybe he should have kept the Alpine contract to be somewhere remotely near P10
Lulu the fraud embarrassing himself again 😊
Oscar Piastri lookin' at those Alpines and thinking "I could've touched that Top 10"
On hards😂
Please.. This announcer is so bad I can't watch. Sounds like f2. I don't know the names of those other guys but bring them back.
What a legend Fernando Alonso is..
give Alonso a bull, and he will rule
what is this commentating
Not excited every weekend..boring f1 right now
Aaaand P11 for Tsunoda becoming a constant lol
Acho que Alonso ganha 1 em 2023
Si RedBull está encontrar mexicano está encontra de 160 millones de mexicanos
I fell asleep during this race once max went into first place
It's so rare that Max and Perez emerge simultaneously in one monitor , Max is so fast that he always  makes long distance from 2nd position driver.
RedBull productos tóxicos
RedBull productos tóxicos
RedBull productos tóxicos
Perfectly summed up... he was like playing the F1 Game on Easy difficulty.. I mean.. How..
Max 💪💪🔥🔥
Do Redbull need Alonso?
Another boring race 👎🏼
I'm Happy for Alonso he raced with the legends In the past 🎉🍾🍾
Alonso fan here.
I wonder why checo wasn't called in before or after Max to get soft tires. 🤔 Alonso was more than 15 soconds behind and he would have had a chance to battle Max.
RBs with DRS is so OP, they look like there playing F1 manager with those double overtakes
Alpine surprisingly decent today 😮
I'm beginning to think F1 is now staged, what a boring race apart from Alonso being on podium.
What a boring race again
drs in this track just makes it hard to run away
Same car… one with 30+ lap old hards and the other with brand new ones and DRS…  How do people still think he’s anything but what he’s signed as… a second driver.
I miss when the commentators used to say "it's lights out and away we go"
Red Bull’s DRS and brake performance is just a whole other level than the rest of the field. It suits Max’s driving style perfectly. I feel for Checo, he is competing with a car that isn’t built for him and he is giving Max a run!
Please bring Martin Brundle back. F1 commentary just isn't it without his energy. Right now it feels like watching a boring random cars driving around while some boring guys are just talking about it. It lacks the voice, the punch, the feel.
whats wrong with mercedes lately :(
I like both max n checo🔥
Mate people thinking Perez has a chance has to be the funniest thing. 9th to 1st and Perez still can’t win. It’s a joke
Boring
Too bad perez didn't get lucky today
This Miami GP was one of a few F1 races where all the drivers finished the race without one retired, a safety car didn't show up all (also happened on Bahrain GP) due to no accidents and we didn't ever see some yellow flag during the race.  That's gonna be a rare moment to see it again in the next Grand Prix's
We were watching 2 GP at the same time. Red Bulls was running in F1 while remaining of the field were running in F1.5🥸
Lets go Perez. You will pass max
Outstanding Austrian Power😊
Felt bad for Checo, I was hoping he'd finished P1 but it is never easy going against Max and the best driver wins at the end.
Charles will see Kevin in his nightmares.
This is what happens when you allow redbull to exceed cost cap.  We have literally gotten Verstappen and Perez 1–2 every race.
Thanks to Leclerc crash in qualifying to make the race a bit entertaining. Else it would have been Baku repeat. F1 needs drama this year to sustain fans interest. Pure racing is not there this season.
Mercedes, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Renault and McLaren........Honda is kicking your Butts again.
play playstation put easy mode for Max .. easy win for him ..
La formula 🥱 aburrida y estos comentaristas ni hambre dan
Buenas noches! Donde puedo ver las transmisiones con su relato Sr,Tornello? Soy de argentina. Muchas gracias.
Just like before but it was Ham and Mercs, now since 2021 (new decade) it's all Max and RB, thanks to them (FIA/FOM) I'm getting richer and richer.
Why different commentators?
It's mad that red bull.
2 dull races in a row…. Great
Well done Max and Lewis. Great drivers for a reason.
Needs to bring back crofty
The RedBull is absolutely brutal 26 second ahead of the next team behind
You know what, Perez is the perfect fit for Red Bull. He's fast enough so the gap to Max is not that embarrassing, and he's mature enough so he won't succumb to peer pressure and just focus on doing his thing, he's great
Ferrari are finished mate. Clear the whole roster and start again.  Embarrassing.
Why RACE ON…. it’s lights out…
Glad to see 70% of the highlights is Max.....
Really 8 min to resume this race?, you should have replaced the narrator with a song like Walking in the Sunshine and fit the resume in the songs length and done.
can we plz have croftyyyyyyy  in commentary
Really not a fan of the DRS
Getting boring.
One of the most boring races ever.
F1 haters: “It’s so boring, there’s no passing.” Max: “Hold my Red Bull.”
Boring…
Boring race
I just came to say that that was so boring. 98% no real action
Is Redbull still using 100 percent pure Honda engine ?
Those RB cars are simply on another level. Add in two excellent drivers, one of which is clearly the best driver in F1 and the other is probably the best at defending, and its honestly surprising when they DONT go 1 and 2.
For Max It's just like playing F1 game on easy mod
Masterclass of performance?????? lololololol.  This is like kindergarten vs Varsity.   Red Bulls have no competition.  F1 = boring.   We know who will win every race.  Yawn.
No more street tracks, boring, I fell asleep. The only highlight was Jackie Stewart showing he gave no 🤬 to that security guard and forcing Roger Federer by the arm to Martin Brundle😂😂😂
🥱
So boring 😢
Not interested in watching one guy make overtakes. World Champions in 13th place, skinny tracks, huge cars.. Nothing about this version of F1 was why I fell in love with the sport originally. Needs a major overhaul in rules and regs.
Verstappen Rules.
Super Max!! 🤴 🏆 🦁
Whatta drive by max
Paia
Congratulations Fernando Alonso you are great F1 Driver
K-Mag overtakes Leclerc while while being overtaken by Verstappen
Are they other cars don't have Drs like Redball or what???
Red bull sabotaged Checo they  r just pure evil somethings I want to say I'll just leave it alone the devil is a liar
Boring red bull winning again what a shocker 🙄
I couldn't watch the race but from what I heard the most interesting part was Alonso looking at that screen so I'm not that fussed
Another predictable result. Yawn.
Boring
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
KMag battling with Leclerc was something… Ferrari’s supposed to be superior right?
We went from the Era of Mercedes to the Era of Red Bull. Seeing how the Merceds era lasted 7 years, i guess it be until 2028 until someone else stops Red Bull
Que diran ahora los loversperez que ?
Hamilton looks like he's lost the hunger
Redbull should be paid not to use DRS.
sorta hate the sweeping camera shots
F1 Fans: "Crofty is so annoying! I wish for a new person to call the action!" Monkey's paw: "Okay."
Una carrera que estuvo muy tranquilo, felicidades por otro podio para Alonso ❤🎉😊
Well done 👏 red bull 🎉🎉
DRS becoming ridiculous and monotony
Why are the F1 highlights with these awful announcers? Where’s the Brundle/Kravitz commentary
This season is not about who wins the driver champ
If Verstappen and Checo had had the same Tire from the beginning at the end, the Real Fight would be seen, but Verstappen with those Tires at the end, I think it was more than obvious that he was going to pass it to Checo, we already know that the mechanical bosses and Redbull favor with the strategies to Verstappen and not to Sergio.
Perez should not have given the pas to Max. Perez is the better driver. Politics
I am from India and I am glad I didn't stay late at night to witness yet another Ferrari nightmare .... No team even Perez(teammate) has an answer to Vestappen's car.
Charles in today's GP was only raced with KMAG.. magnussen was minister of defense today
I really think they tuned down perez car to give it to max
Max was on fire.. wasn't even close...
ZZZ ZZZ 😴😴😴😴 Miami GP
I couldn't watch the race. Was it as drab as these highlights?
Save yourself 8 minutes.  It was a Red Bull snooze fest.  Changed 1 dominant team for another.
MORE STATIC CAMERAS
big lock up into turn 1, commentator: 😐
YUKI AGAIN FANTASTIC JOB P11
this was a decent race 7/10. a solid f1 race. hamilton showing his class climbing back up the field
Where's the old announcer?
Red Bull doesn't want the Mexican to win.
Stop using this announcer for highlights they are so bad at it. Use the actual race commentators.
Alonso has been the best performing driver this year so far. Just look at his teammate with the same car… he has really getting the best out of what he was given
The papayas were never featured in the highlight until the standings.
Easy max easy 😎
It is hard to be ferrari fan
It is hard to be ferrari fan
boring
With Alonso in third, he is being the best rear gunner for Redbulls.
That redbull is ridiculously quick. Other cars have no chance. It’s boring
Well done Mag!
KMAG vs Leclerc Show 0:33 1:50 3:35 4:25
It was great to see Lewis gain around 6 places from where he started with that car.. Max & Perez was great🎉
Awesome performance Max
Perass can't even win from pole in the rocketship 💀
Let me guess, Max wins…..oh how fantastically boring!
Honestly this years pirelli tyres are not up to the mark.
One hit wonder nick is done after this season
I can't believe Max's pace on the hards for 40 laps... that was the difference. Checo couldn't make a distance with the medium. At the end, it was better for Max starting from behind allowing him to adopt the Hard - Medium Strategy, that was the best tyre selection for this race.
Redbull sandbag. Really fun to watch a race where they let redbulls to what they want and spend what they want on the research. Now there you have a 1 2 always from redbull. This is fun to watch.. or not!!
have to say i thought the track was going to make it to at least a safety car but ti was actually one of the best races this season for me. Clean Driving, great camera work, all of it!
+20s gap both RH with rest of grid was crazy
The F1 race is getting  boring with Red Bull winning every races. I guess Max can withdraw his qualification round and relax himself in his chair coz whatever position he is in, he will still wins the race. The rest of the drivers are just accompanying him forr the show.
Max is a demon I’m keep saying this he will be the one who will break the 7 Champ boys and girls
Come onnnn That is formula 1 Wheel to wheel  Side by side  Comeee onnnnn Bring it onnnnn
Booring max terus
Whats with the Ferrari's,  is it the car or the drivers.  Such poor performance
Porqué no hacen la Formula Red Bull para que sea más interesante?? Una verguenza esta formula 1, la peor de la historia.
Eu parei de assistir! Tá prosa demais! Emoção zero! 👍🏽
It's sad being a Lando fan right now :(
I have said since they built that track in Texas and Miami i wanted to put it on my bucket list but after watching Alpine and Aston Martin ahead of Mercedes nothing against those teams but what is going on its kinda like Peugeot racing a top fuel dragster come on might as well turn it into NASCAR 😮😢😢😢😢😢
Formula 1 cada vez mais sem graça 😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂
Bring back crofty. Ffs 😭
Why didn’t they cheat that much for Logan Sargeant? It is home race. Like come on I care it’s kinda rude that they like didn’t care
A boring race
Seems so fake. The commentators trying to add a sense of drama fail miserably.
Max Verstapen e a Red Bull.  Melhor piloto  e Melhor equipe no momento atual na  minha opinião. 😊
Same old story for the fallen red giant..are they still favourite in challenging titles? Nahhhhhh this season is a relaxing vacation around the world
McLaren: Wasted Alonso in his prime. Wasted Ricciardo. Wasting Norris. Piastri next talent (supposedly) to get the McLaren treatment? 💀
Cette red bull est beaucoup trop rapide il va falloir que les autres écuries trouvent une solution parce que là c'est trop facile pour eux et ça n'a rien a voir avec les pilotes vous mettez Alonso ou Hamilton sur cette Redbull ils feront pareil voir même mieux que Verstapen .
Que genial es escuchar a Fernando Tornello en los "Mejores Momentos" del GP. Excelente!!
too easy. it's not fun.
Ferrari needs to get their act together. So frustrating watching the back slide.
Max is insane. 5,3s gap in 10s after taking the lead.
Imagine if Red Bull was on the same level this year as Ferrari Mercedes and Aston. And then imagine if Alpine or McLaren was closer to those teams. We could see 8 race winners in a season. Hopefully the cost cap lessens the gap in the next few year and the new regs pay off
Vuelta 47 a la caza del Checo
Go Alonso, GO!
Switch the commentary to brundle
what a nice clean race
Red Bull unfair advantage, faster car, more development
I want to see Checo win the whole thing. It would be insane to have joint champions on the same racing team.
Yaaaawn....
Why does Max even bother qualifying
I missed the race this weekend but if this was the best of the highlights, it looked like a very boring race :/ Great race by Max though
Max is clearly amazing, but RB did everything possible to ruin Checos race…telling him to lift and coast for oil consumption, limited radio info vs telling Max push and constant lap lap times
Red bull DRS is so strong the only car able to defend against them passing on the straight is the other red bull… this is racing?
Please share the highlights with Crofty as the commentator, not these people
Max is the new Schumacher. If Checo ends up winning a world title against him. Then I would change my mind. I feel the only person who can beat him is Charles, but in similar machinery. Ferarri need to get Alonso  back like what they did with Kimi. Maybe that would motivate Charles even more. Even get Seb back?
แม็คผู้ไม่เคยยอมใคร สุดยอดจิงๆ
👈🏻👀🏁🏎 To motorsport lovers and pretty girls.  👩🏻‍🦰👱🏻‍♀️🇺🇲
Even start from Hawaii, Max can still win this race....
To think about last year and then see Max DOUBLE pass Charles and KMag was just ... wow lol  It's wild how much better Red Bull got the regs compared to everyone else.
I wish I could hear these commentators instead of those biased sky sports ones.
que asco de carrera la plena no se que le pasa a la ferrari que no da pelea
Checo team should have call him to boxes to change the tyres Hard ones for the Medium even before Verstappen went to boxes, in that way he could really fight for the first place in the last laps of the race...
It is a problem when Red bull climbs the fence at the finish line, but never was for Mercedes.
Lewis, since you didn't researched what the Parents Act was about and told a bunch of bs, you're not my favorite anymore.  Lets go Max!!!!!!!
레드불 스피드 대단합니다. 놀라운 머신성능...
Max is definitely on another level
Verstappen on his prime
Sergio Pérez com pneu duro colocava 2 volta no vespa mas equipe não quis.
alonso on the box and a haas in the points. would like to see more of the other teams getting in the midfield fight. sargent needs to get some pace by the years end. summer break is coming and he is nowhere near albon
Max fans are so boring. I like the guy, but jesus christ these aren't even races.
over power verstapen & perez, ferarri oh no!!!
Yawn!!  No surprise,  reb bull wins again!
Petition to make one championship for the bulls and another for everyone else
Max jembooooot
Wonder what cheats the red bull are hiding
Great to see Alonso ❤
Whoever they had waving the chequered flag at the end of the race nearly missed Max crossing the line and then waved the flag like they were trying to carefully dry it.
LA F1 MURIÓ JUNTO A AYRTON SENNA! YA NO EXISTE!
bring back crofty as a commentator ffs
Dude imagine if Alonso was in a redbull
Est-ce que les commentateurs sont en télétravail dans leur chambre à coucher.  Aucune émotions, d'interminables silences, une description digne d'un débutant. Comme vous pouvez le voir, j'aime vraiment pas 😡.
Checo should give his car to Alonso. That would be quite a season.
Did martin brundle retired or something? I miss his voice
*_Every Grand Prix is an Repeating Scenario without any sign of competition..._* *_Formula 1 is boring motorsport..._* 🤦‍♂️👎
H0NDA  sedang terpuruk di motoGP ,  tapi berjaya di Formula-1
Why have they stopped uploading the highlights with crofty's commentary? The new commentary is like walmart crofty
When Max goes all Mortal Kombat and does a fatality on Checo's hopes and dreams!
de 8vo a 1ero, y aun asi piensan que checo puede ganarle a verstapen, con ventaja y ni le pudo sacar diferencia para mantenerlo atras
Never been this bored by F1 and I watched Schumacher, Vettel and Hamilton all dominate this sport. It's rarely been this wide a margin from the top car to the rest, there's no competition here and their number 1 driver has 100% team support over Checo. It's suspenseful in the back and boring af in the front while the other way round would be ideal.  Why would I spend hours watching the same race happening over and over?
I swear riccardo says "gp2 engine...gp2" and laughs that he is not the one who need to drive this williams or something
Performa mobil yang tidak seimbang, max lucky
Well done max 🧡🦁
Way to go Lewis ❤❤🎉🎉🎉 well from 13th to 6th
Imagine bulls crashing
Boring .. make the cars the same speed
Back to 2004......Michael Verstapen
Boring race
Perez es un seguidista pagado para la gloria d3 max
Red Bull are having as close to a perfect season, as we’ve seen in a while.  They’ve won every race, 4/5 have been 1-2 finishes.
Sleeper zzzz, Red Bull's car just too strong. Fair play to the mechanics but not much the drivers can do with Max is barreling down behind them
I kinda want David Croft back 😢
That's a redbull 1 2 3
Red bull wins again. How exciting
Boring
At this point just put verstappen randomly in quali
go red goo
2do lugar para   Checo sabe a derrota pero Max tuvo una carrera extraordinaria.
Change the commentator
Boring race. How is the Red Bull that much faster? It’s embarrassing how much extra pace that car has. Hamilton looks finished.
Man I feel for Legg. He deserves much better. Hes out there with Max when it comes to pure talent.
Can someone stop Horner from cheating on Checo's car? He did it again!
Wheres Crofty?
You can tell checo perez let him win soooo rigged
Russell needs a better support driver.
Lord help us for Las Vegas.
Max champion 8x 2021,2022,2023,2024,2025,2026,2027,2028
Great job Max!!! You are awesome 👍🏻🇺🇸❤️💙
Max..wow
Se nota el favoritismo de estos comentaristas hacia verstapen
Kmag had an amazing drive
I’m sorry but are red bull using a 2.0 turbo cause there ain’t no way a clever wing does that. Not even when Mercedes had there “2.0”😂
No way Maxx is that fast. Both the Red Bull cars are the same. There seems to be something illegal going on here
Como asi subieron el resumen en español??!
happy global nightmare planet warming... we are destroying our habitat... bravo humans
leclerc if he want to be champions, left that team
20-22km/h difference in pace was insanely massive.
Next season aston martin need to put there own powertrain and creat better car of Alonso then he can win the race ❤️ every single time
Can't say I'm surprised by the results. Literally only watching with hopes that Alonso may win a race ir two this year
Tracks wack
i can watch this all day
HAM is a perfect example of Go Woke Go Broke 😂I am just waiting for HAM to pull out a racist card 😂
why dont perez use hard from the start too? to help max win?
45 Laps on hard. That is very risky
Leclerc needs to defend more
Súper Max demostrsndo la diferencia entre un top y un segundon
Boring
just award the championship to RedBull. so boring.
Wow, no DNF!
Another fantastic Formula 1 race... to get bored and fall asleep (which I did).
its a boring competition. every single week we already know that red bull team will be the winner. so no need to watch it anymore
Just me or red bull car can even go more faster than I thought
The hype train has reached its final station 🚉
Now THAT was racing!😊
Wonder why they replaced crofty voice with this loser!
Modern day Ferraris are useless donkeys 😂
how is that reb bull so strong. Rocket car
If checo use a medium tyre i think he's gonna win this race
Max is absolute monster. What a drive
Dang it, cry baby wins again...
The championship is finished. I will not see F1 until 2024
Red Bull cars even in its dominant days before used to be high downforce draggy cars with low speeds, notably in the days of Vettel and also prior to 2021. Vettel got pole in Monza with top speed of only 327kph. Today the combination of downforce and straight line speed is scary.
Too easy for redbulls
Redbull vs Redbull 🫤🫤🫤  Glad alonzo take 3rd place
Perez should’ve gone medium tire, maybe then he would’ve had 1st place? Coaching error?
So boring this Formula bull season.
Second race that put me to sleep this season
Sad to call this racing kinda scripted my opinion not fun when you know who’s gonna win instead of anybody being able to win
First 3 mins: Max overtake compilation
McLaren are lost.
I was waiting and grinding my teeth just to see Verstappen and Perez battle, it was fun for a bit, i just hope we get to see more of Max vs Checo in the upcoming races (im rooting for Perez)
Redbull is too fast, the race yet became more predicted and boring.
AVISEM O CARA DA BANDEIRADA QUE O VESTAPPEN JA PASSOU KKKKK,,,,NEM VIU
Verstappen is in a different class altogether.
Borefest season. No competition. 🥱
Aburrida y se noto la orden de equipo por parte de redbull. La F1 es desde Alonso para atrás
Not much of racecraft. Newey really did his magic this year.
would love to see onboards with Kmag and Charles from the entire race, there didn’t seem to be much coverage of their battle during the live race
Not a Max fan but he undeniably crushed that.
You can't stop Max Verstappen in Miami, can you?
Que trabalho top,largou atrás e com o carro melhor,porém com pneus duros,acelerou e no fim colocou pneus médios e novos e trouxe a vitória no sapatinho,fim de semana bom também pro Lewis,e o Alonso incrível.
3 WDC right there
Everyone let max go through like nahhh he talk to much better dont fight it..not worth it..hahaha
Mexican , Spaniard hope Italian would come up to F1 and able to win in top 3.  Then all of them could speak and understand. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When does Williams get relegated
What’s the point of watching when u almost know the result of the race
Weird to hear that commentators
Que diferencia tiene hamilton teniendo un auto a nivel que los demás.  al tener el mejor auto de la parrilla, sin límite presupuestario  hasta strol es campeón del mundo.
Not a lot of radio communication for Perez while Max has every information given to him
i miss crofty’s commentary
Checo is a joke. No way max should have been able to catch him
No one wants to say it but there is something not right about the red bull cars! Yes I don't like red bull!
F1 has slowly borded me with max and Sergio always winning
what's wrong with Hamilton?
Red Bull again  and again *yawn* This just isn’t an interesting season for us casual viewers ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Always fun in the USA. Americans know how to make a show. Got to give it to them.
def better old commentators!
Que es este comentarista 😂 por dios 😂👎
Ferrari e seus pilotos são umas porcarias
Max fenômeno das pistas 🦁🦁🦁🦁
Max outperformed everybody in this race!
What happened to crofty? I know that he still commentates on SkySport but why are the highlights different now?
the only way for alonso to win the race is by two red bulls retire their cars...those cars are absolute monster
Fernando's miracle !
On to the next, let’s see if Sergio can pull out something for Imola. I feel this is only the beginning while everyone seems to be counting Checo out already
McLaren didn't even make the highlight reel! so sad.......
tak tengok pun dah tau redbull yang akan conquer😂
LOL Mercs drivers & fans crying so much!
Ferrari is worst car on this year..only say next year
We didnt like the commentators
Miami es muuuuy aburrida!! Boring Miami !!
Oh wow Ocon didnt crash into Max   AMR is off their pace this time
I thought Baku was boring...This one takes the cake! Zzzzzzzzzzzzz
Que aburrido este campeonato. Redbull contra redbull
It's really insane and no point watching as someone from the mid and back of the grid to win by 5+ seconds.
The most boring F1 GP ever.
I think perez need to improve his confidence. That's the only way he'd won the championship
Redbull Equals 🟰 illegal car
F1 now is sooo boring..i am not redbull haters..but when the time lewis hamilton always winning the race and became world champ,that was the haters word..just eat it!!!hahahaha
Embarrassing Ferrari performance, yet again. Vasseur is just another big disappointment.
Bendita carrera de un solo carro andando  verdaderamente como un F1, Venga GP Miami!!1
Seems like all the cars finished the race. Haven’t seen that in quite a while
You could put max 20th every race and he would probably still win most of the time. Checo's tyre strategy lost him the race today though
Verstappen is just relentless
Bravo Alonso!!!!!
like playing a video game with easy settings. why redbull can be like that
Love him or hate him Max is built different. From 9th all the way through 1st even his own teammate in the same car... ooft Terrible weekend for Leclerc
I think if Checo had any delusions of beating Max this season, they were dashed today.
I haven't watched a lap this season. I know who wins before even watching. Sort it out. Its the same race, weekend after weekend, year after year.
La peor f1 de la historia....muy aburrido , desesperante una basura ...
When Mercedes were genuinely dominant all and sundry were calling for parity in order that the racing be improved. Oh how silent Sky and these here at F1 have become. They who were so vocal about the Hamilton dominant years and they who claimed it is the car oh how they are so welcoming of  ac ar which i my opinion does not look legal according to the rules. Where has Red Bull got all that performance in such a short space of time? Are Honda testing and developing secretly in Japan? Were they lying all those years when F1 and the FIA foolishly allowed them extra testing and development time? The am=nswer is blowing in the wind.
These new YouTube commentators are absolute skudbooks man get them in the bin
Boring 1.
This season is damaging the integrity of the sport
Max is so fast!  The other drivers are turtles 🐢 ( they can start the race Friday) Max is a road runner! Beep, beep!!!
Formula 1 virou um esporte sem graça vc já sabe quem vai ganhar quem tem o melhor carro , não perco mais o meu tempo assistindo ..
i could watch kmag overtaking leclerc all day
So why did Perez put on hard tyres....like are you kidding
Monza 2022: DeVries is much better than Latifi Miami 2023: DeVries is much worst than Latifi
zzzzz
It's really too bad that one manufacturer wins all of the races that's not racing I do love formula one I've been following it all my life but this is ridiculous none of the other teams can even win a race
Leclerc got Zontad
What has happened to Ferrari man 😭
Wonder what odds I would get for this finishing order for every remaining grand prix this year ?
Podia ser um especial só do Verstappen! Foi uma das melhores corridas da carreira dele, na minha opinião.
Don't know what's this comparison all about . All drivers want to win , and similarly Max who is backed by RB completely and responds to that with those incredible wins and  Checo who has to fight on his own ..
Amigos de America bienvenidos al Premio de la Ciudad de Miami por favor tener siempre el resumen en español tambien seria un detalle
respect to the social media team for finding 8 minutes of interesting content from today's race
I'm sick of this boring sport. Even if Max starts from last position would not mean a thing because he can surpass anyone with his advantage, the car. IndyCar is much more exciting and fair. No need for F1 in America, pure cheap marketing trick will die out soon
Alonso carrying F1 this year. 💪🏼I went from full year sub to monthly to free youtube highlights. 😆 Basically paying to watch who's third. 😅 I love F1 don't get me wrong but in the current stage highlights will do. 👌🏼🫶
Staged.
This race was better than Baku but that is a really really really low bar to cross 😭😭😭
F1 Red bull cup 😂
the gap between RB and F1 is huge ...
Adrian Newey is winning these races before they start.  Amazing skill set that person has acquired.  Max and Checo do their part, but as in the days of the dominance of that Merc engine, the driver is there to keep the machine on track. I am not meaning to denigrate the skills of any player, but those RBs are just a class unto themselves.  Max has a great feel for the car apparently, but the car, what a wisp!
L Track Bring back Sepang!
Typically American .. the driver introduction. Wasn’t needed and over the top. Then again it was probably the only entertaining thing about this snooze fest of a race. Another boring street circuit
REDBULL are OP make for boring racing
f1 hAs NEVeR beEn morE coMpETITiVE ThAn IT HAS Been NOw  🤡
Just give Red Bull the trophies now, and send them off on holiday. At least the rest of the season would be interesting.
It’s race on doesn’t have the same ring to it as it’s lights out and away we go
Not even fun to watch anymore! F1 is a joke, they are just making rules around 1 team! No competition in f1 at all!
Red bull what a car
I know people like to hate on this track and Redbull dominance. But this race wasn't actually 2 bad
Lets go verstomen I knew he was going to win
Verstappen is outbreaking everyone on the track...
Today Horner strategy was in place . He and mArko will sleep happily 😂
What is up with the commentary ?
Boring championship season...1 team already win... Boring to watch.
One day I’ll be able to attend the Miami Grand Prix in person.
There are rumors that before the race Jos was fiddling around Perez's car 😂
Devries ruining Landos race before turn 1, dude should not be in F1.
Congrats to Max, he really won today.
USA deserves much better venues than Miami
When luck runs out, Talent comes ahead (and wins). Happy to see max on top podium.
No competitve, no chance for other times, no grace F1 2023.
really wanted Perez to win this one! Hope we see him close the gap to Max to keep this season interesting
Boring
Ferrari no fun to watch anymore....Bad to worst.....Horse with a broken leg....
Verstappen is on another level that was amazing.
what a boring race terrible
McLaren where they belong
"Highlights"
Red bulls are too strong for another teams like ducati in motto gp
Semua kata terbaik yang ada di dunia ini, tertuju kepada max Verstappen
At this point, if max ever starts down the order again, the best strategy for the other teams is to bolt on whatever tyres Verstappen is on and mirror him.
Nobody even slightly tries to defend against max. “It’s not your race” maybe it would be if everyone didn’t let him have the racing line as he zooms past.
redbull set difficulty to 20%
At this stage, red bull might as well give either driver a quick holiday. Their 3rd driver will still continue to deliver the points. Their car, or team rather, just outclasses the competition.
And David Croft.. miss him????
Hmmm.... Look back on yesterday's event ... Just as i told you Checko...you have to enjoy all rhe bits  of ur pole  settings hecause the true Bull will hunt you down on rhe Race day.... Cheers to that
Where's Crofty
From 10 to  1 sorry he's absolutely the best right now 🎉
F1 is so fookin boring no competition at every level off the sport
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
Red bull ... awesome car not driver
Not a race, but more a parade.
where's crofty and brundle? and this race was boring af
snooze fest
another boring result
Crofty/Brundle qre the voice of F1. No disrespect to other commentators, but official highlights should feature them.
checo hype over again, totally schooled by Verstappen
better car wins, as per usual..
Max is a total beast. Merciless.
typical result i even called it . this the state of this "sport" for past 13 years . long gone the mad 4 title contenders that we saw between 2007 and 2010 no its the same boring car with the same boring pilot winning the same boring race i have seen better entertainment on kart racing and video games
9th to 1st.......How can Red Bull legally be that better than anyone else. What's the point of even racing, it's like Benz-Hamilton all over again. How boring.
Q aburrida las carreras del f1
I’m glad I didn’t stay up late at night for this
Max’s car is a cheat code.
Red bull have delivered a car like they did for Sebastian Vettel years ago, can't see anyone stopping them, but also them over spending has helped a lot 😂
Max defeated the king of the street circuit, from 9th place.  Max is on another race.
Where’s crofty?
lol what happened to these new cars will make racing much closer and tighter ?
Bummed for Checo. He needs to dig really, really deep to beat Max.
This is going to be the most boring year since Vettel
Vamos checo perez 🔥🦅
Perez is no match to max
Last race, F1 is boring, nobody can pass. This race, everybody passing everybody but Max.
what happened to mclaren - norris and piastri deserve a better car than what they have , i thought they were slowly improving with previous races, but now its seems the bottom fell out again
I really don't feel this commentator.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for ditching the biased Sky F1 clown commentary!!
Two great finishes today one in Miami and the other in Kansas
Max shattering any confidence Checo might've had. He's just got another gear compared to the rest of the field.
Great Race Max..🎉🎉🎉
Pior corrida da f1.f1 já era.
2020 vibes
Honda is unstoppable in terms of engine power and quality
F max
Most amazing part of this race is that you managed to 6 minutes of highlights
f1 is so boring right now
there's no competitiveness,   they just drive and don't even try.   no intense moments,  no eye catching crashes,  no passion and no soul.   f1 blows...
can Mercedes change back to silver so i can tell them apart from Aston Martin ffs
Orang gila
Boriing !!!;
great race max and checo
Max make its easy like playstation
he didn't say its lights out and away we go...it just doesn't feel right.
GET RID OF THESE COMMENTATORS!!! Just use the race commentary from Crofty and Martin
One of if not the worst track on the calendar,,alonso watching TV for 57 laps....
Verstappen on lap 47 ; “Adios chiflado muchacho”  😂. Back to being #2.
Is there a place where I can bet on F1. I know who's going to win every race before it starts...
That Red Bull livery tho
Another snore fest.  At least Mag kept a little entertainment up
Alonso 🥳
Kmag🙏
this is the worst racing,  sooo boring,  bunch of spoiled no talent millionaire brats.
Boring..
Boring cheats at it again
Max shoud have a -5 grid handicap every race to make things exciting.
Max Verstappen is a absolute beast! Best driver F1 has ever seen! 🎉
No no no we need crofty back 😢😢😢
where's Crofty?
olha a diferença da narração brasileira. a gringa muito melhor
Go Alonso Go
This commentary is so cringe... Is it the American commentary ?? Where is the Crofty goodness?
Word of advice to LEWIS HAMILTON, next time you come to Florida, stay out of local polotics and concentrate on your job.  Would not be so bad if you knew what you were talking about.
boring..
The American accent on F1 commentary just ruins it. Cringe-worthy!
So boring TBH. Red Bull every race...
O melhor carro sim, mais aqui tem o melhor piloto do grid, aqui pura raça e melhor piloto no braço, sem DRS ou com, que comece o mimi e os choros dos invejosos, cadê o Perez? Aqui é Max !!!!
Max, Sergio, Alonso me favorite drivers. Ferrari needs to it up and so does Stroll.
Upnormal cars of max
This race should convince anyone that Lewis will not transfer to Ferrari 😂  Edit: props to Kevin Mag great drive
Did they change commentators? I prefer the previous ones😭
It's a waste of time watching f1 anymore u could put both those red bulls at back of pack in every race and they would still win so much for new rules making things more competitive
Starting to get real repetitive. Just give the title to crybaby already. Seesh
F1 now more bored than last year. Redbull again and again 😑
Everybody needs the same engine then we see what’s what
These announcers are boring
What highlights? Nothing happened.
Es muchiisima la diferencia entre Red Bulls y los demas autos asi como de Max a Checo ,la F1 deberia hacer algo para equilibrar las carreras y sean que mas interesantes y entretenidas.
Redbull: we're tired of thinking strategies, let's just make our drivers race each other, guaranteed redbull 1 2
Today’s race just confirmed that barring injury or accident, it’s all but a formality at this point for Verstappen to get his 3rd F1 championship. 9th to 1st is crazy! SMH… The way things are going at this point, the only way other drivers have a chance to beat Max is by racing him on the F1 video game. 😆
boring.
Honestly such a boring race
poor checo sabotaged again ...
Motor Honda é inter estelar.
Mag vs Lec battle was beautiful, more of that pls
This season is much more boring than when the Mercs where dominant
How Alonso turned around sainz and Ferrari’s  upper hand is insane
It was a crazy race in the fact there was basically no flags and all cars finished.
Thank you for these highlights ive been missing F1 for the last 2 years and just to find out they had a race in Miami i would have taken a flight to go see it!
Esse carro do Max tem uma turbina a mais. Porque anda demais.
Boring Circuit. Alonso is the only reason to watch.
No need to race 😂 . Just give the title to Max .. 😅
Red bull again and again
Baku is just a fluke, the 2nd fastest car still the AMR
I'm speechless...he did it again..
Highlight of the day - Jackie Stewart evading security and busting into the VIP area
Everybody saying boring but max vs checo and kmag vs lecrerc was great, russel also great overtake on sainz
Public Service Announcement:  If you take the 'i' out of Piastry, you're left with Pastry.
Nobody defended against max, at least alonso put up a fight, maxs fight, already a RB 1,2 next year
Ferrraris are thrash, better stop competing now, make research, annoavation and comeback,
As a Merc fan, That is the BORING race that I have watched so far.
Boring
You've already heard of HAM-BOT-VER  Now get ready for VER-PER-ALO  Also masterclass defense from KMag
Wow! Glad I didn't waste time watching this live. Those races are becoming just repeats.
Mercedes really need to work on their cars
Race highlights = max verstappen show 😂
I don’t watch a lot of F1, I don’t understand how years ago, Lewis…unstoppable, and now he’s terrible and the Red Bulls can’t be stopped. Is their car better or is the driver better? I feel like there should be some standards in terms of equality for the car set up.
Ferrari fighting with Haas all throught the race is just embarassing...
If the redbull cars didnt exsist well be looking at a 40 year old world champion im guessing
Miami gp is just a dayclub with f1 as the bonus event. My guess Las Vegas gp is going to be an actual nightclub party where no one is interested in the race.
Max needs to raise his AI difficulty
Boring season…. Thanks we have Alonso.
Re aburridas las carreras, mucho auto tiene red Bull, encima arriba esta Max.
Who is this new announcer? He sounds so annoying.
Ferrari cars looks slow and heavy... what is wrong with these guys....
Max Verstappen who won again was very boring. for some reason I am no longer interested in the F1 race which is too clear to dominate if this continues it will be able to reduce the interest in the F1 audience
Aston Martin next year the car championship.
So boring.. only redbull
same people win every race. whats the point, its rigged
BORING SEASON
ჩემპიონია ფერსტაპენი
Well, another RB 1-2 3 years of dominance left
Alonso. Ok I got your attention. Max is the best and schhhh the rest. Get over it 😉
A yank commentating on the elite global motor sport, now that’s scraping the barrel😂😂😂😂
Red Bull got the best car ever  Just the 2023 gets boring enough.
Perez, crónicas de un perdedor.
😂😂😂 ma stiamo scherzando?? Non c'è storia fra la Red bull con le altre macchine. Di fatto non guarderò più la formula 1 .. non c'è più gusto
The new Gen of cars started off so well, but it's already turned into Merc with the last Gen. So instead of 2 teams battling for a win like Ferrari and Merc and Merc and RB did, we now just get to watch max win every race.
This was a great race.
Max put something engineer to win 🤯
Yawn....
Very competitive season, Red Bull vs Red Bull.
I don’t see anyone talking about that absolute amazing driving by Kmag, he did brilliant this race against Leclerc
Well that's the last race I watch this season. F1 has had some boring periods over the years buy never this bad. 1 team is 30% better than the rest, never has there been such a large gap.
I'm cheering for Alonso and KMag this season
The first race with no yellow flag of the season isn't it?  Also the Bahrain podium for alonso here at miami
This is not the best or an awesome race, but a solid race. No SC, red flag, and other controversial moments. What it should be you need to win in F1 is a pure performance(Both a car and driver) and fair battles.
Leclerc fighting with Haas make it look like fighting with another RedBull😅
What highlights?
This commentator is not IR
No matter where verstapen start, he will always win
I miss Martin and Crofty
What a race Max and Checo where fast …. Tones of over takes KMag and Charles L what racing back and forth … Lance and Ocon at the end
I missed the old commentator
Alonso is the main character
When Max wins : It's just fastest car 🤣 Looks like Max work hard with RB crew with sharing continuous feedback on improvement. Today Max was into rocket
boring af
All that American cringe fest for a boring snooze fest race
Boring race
Max el tata de todos
Perez 21 seconds ahead of Alonso, and Max easily caught him from 8th. How far ahead could he have been if he started pole? These Bulls are more dominant than the Mercs were.
Give a RB to Alonso and he will show us what he dord
Depois que a red bull ganhou aquela velocidade acho que alguem da f1 está apoiando a red bull. Pq é impossivel que a equipe tenha uma velocidade assim. Se fosse eu no lugar mandaria fazer redução na potencia pq a f1 ta chata. Desculpe falar mas é a verdade. Critico sim mas isso ai já é demais
Max was outstanding, simply lovely, Checo only wins when others have badluck ! But i like checo hope he and max will fight to the end !
Bring back Crofty, the new commentators voice is very annoying and he cuts in on Coultard. Is he the pretender from the Woke Drive to Survive?
🥱
Race on? It's LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO!
A Formula One race should start with "Lights out and away we go!".  Change my mind.
What happened to the old commentators
Los unicos buenos momentos que veo es que max tiene un auto que nadie alcanza,a si haya estado en el ultimo pasa a todos y llega en primero algo no cuadra .
clean move by max againt checo
I miss David Croft
Max is on fire
Red bull & Verstappen are ruining my love for this sport.
レッドブルが強すぎておもん無い
Yawn
Another boring race.
I keep watching F-1 ,...& i love auto-racing,..but this is getting boring watching Max win every race,...I don't understand why he is always the fastest car...seems like it's all rigged..!!!
There was highlights?
Red Bull again... really very boring 😅
It's mad that rivals don't even try to fight Red Bull as they come through.
Totally bossed by Max!
Put Verstappen 20th and he will still win.
Congratulations Max i really love your driving your confidence and your loyalty with your team May Allah success you in All circumstances ameen
Max : Mech ,Mech my brakes isn't working Mech : Sorry Max you are driving a rocket 😂
Toujours les mêmes qui gagnes, sa deviens intéressant et lassant...
poor charles
Uhhhh, again... the sport will die!! RB dominance is boring
Se vio muy mamon Max!!
Max destroyed Perez with older tires.
its ridiculous that nobody even wants to give a hard time to max when is is passign them, see how gasly let him through and in the event also let others through.. I understand Max is not their race but how come their competitive instincts not even on show?
The monegasque driver
Wow , F1 has got so boring now! Even the commentators are boring. The overtakes with DRS are just so pedestrian now.
Nice for verstappen
When all driving F1 car ,Max does it with rocket ❤️😍
All Right One Two Finish for Max and Sergio Of Red Bull Racing Honda RBPT. And Third Place Finish for Fernando Of Aston Martin Aeramo Mercedes.
Its lights out and away we go!- miss that.
i dont know why they changed these highlights from crofty
Il pourrait faire des effort sur le doublage franchement ce n’est que des « ouaaah il attaque c fou » ou « ha la la c’est incroyable il va très vite ». Ce serait bien un peu de technique et de tonalité la c’est plat et on nous explique rien même pas un mot sur le DRS
今回のドライバーオブザデイはマグヌッセンd=(^o^)=b 最高のドライビングで熱かった＼(^o^)／
It’s like they give checo a 2 cycle Honda engine compared to max
マックスが勝つの見飽きたな
Demostrando quién tiene el 1, locura lo de max
Boring race.
Why did checo have to pit early with H tires on?
Red bull is way to fast there is something up with that car and it doesn't sit right with me. How come every one got the same budget and still red bull is leading.
I don't think the red bull cars perform equally, Max verstappen came from nine grid and won the race against his teammate who's on pole and they use the same engine.🤔
Well, that was pretty pathetic.
The opening ceremony was terrible, this racing or a pagent? It was embarrassing to watch
NASCAR>>>>>>
give us crofty back
Amazing performance of max
Why did Perez go with hard tires on his pit stop?
Thank you. Five minutes is enough..
Hi❤️‍🔥💚❣️
Recently got into F1 in the last few years but I’m realizing it’s a sport where there’s always an expected outcome because one team dominates. DRS is supposed to make things more exciting but it just allows the faster cars a free pass through the field. Not very entertaining when you know the outcome before the race in my opinion.
I hope we can see more of max and checo fighting, it would be awesome.
The king max ..
I nearly fell asleep watching the race 😴
verstappen is a beast, from 9th place taking the win
They managed to get 8 minutes of highlights for this?
Bad commentary
Max es mucho para Checo!!!
I'm really disappointed by the difference between Red Bull and the other teams, mostly due to the fact that this difference is the result of not respecting the rules with practically no consequences, really humiliating, it takes away the joy and fun that one could have from seeing a competitive and equal race... if it were an advantage born from making better use of the same means then I would only have admiration but unfortunately it is not so
I been rooting for Alonso this season! He aint disappointing at all! Great drive for k-mag as well
2:27 3:15
What awful commentary where is Croft
Sergio had it to win, was it a coincidence that he let it pass or did they give him the order to pass it to him? Because Sergio would have won the easy race.    🏎️💨
Very disappointing race, it's as if Ferrari was trying to let the other cars through.
Remember when we all laughed at Honda?
Easy dispute by Perez and Crashstappen hmmm the contract dictating positions
Checo put back in his place
Man verstappen is a great frickin driver
The highlight should be longer and more details
Poxa Theco ai fica difícil. Sem vencer o Max na pista não dá pra exigir muito da equipe.
Max is just phenomenal he cut Perez like butter
Boring 😂😂😂
I sat and watch the Ferrari/Schumacher dominance of 2002 onwards  And I watched the Hamilton Mercedes dominance of the 2010s And I think we can safely say now 2023 will be Max’s Congrats to him, hopefully next season will be closer for Aston, Mercedes’ and Ferrari
Max showed who is the goat
That part where Verstappen overtakes Perez, you can cut it out. Actually, just cut out Red Bulls.  It's rather boring watching their part. It is true the Red Bulls got the car that belongs to a different league, and it is also true watching them is boring.
Max just showed them how no one is even close to his level
The Red Bull is so much quicker than every car its not even fun to watch. Doesn't matter who's driving it when it goes 1 sec a lap quicker than the rest. Boring snoozefest that F1 is turning into
Bring back the old commentator!
HOW THE F***, HOW THE F***
Was worried Agent 47 would make an appearance
how did they get 8 minutes of highlights out of this race 🥱
HAM fans are melting down, this comment section is acidic like orange juice in a metal cup! VER bad, RB bad/cheaters/sabotaging PER, ALO washed/green RB "its only the car" "F1 is a joke"  man oh man you guys got short memories!
Ferrari fighting Haas is the main event
Maxterclass..!!
>yawn<  Whenever will there be a _contest?_
🐖🐖🐖🐖🐖🐷
Its race on? What happened to lights out and away we go?
That redbull is in a world of its own right now
Can someone tell me why this guy is commentating and not the ones on sky sports
Could not care less about F1 this season
What’s going on with Ferrari
I can't stand MV but that's some drive is that! Fair play 👌
Is boring F1.  Nowadays
Can we stop "Americanising" F1? This sport has been damaged enough by Liberty Media & and the FIA
It should be new meta on f1 because I see that no one likes to watch f1 anymore. Give them all the teams at least equal cars then maybe can be fun. Always questioning if if if.
Long straight, dive bomb overtake, repeat. Miami once again proved dull as dishwater.
RB19 DRS is insane. He blew past 2 cars in one tow and one DRS like it was nothing.
4:11 Track limits
Two hass drivers are next level  Missing with every one on the grid  Two old school drivers
I pray for Haas to win one race in my lifetime
面白くなーい。 どこかのチームがぶっちぎるのは 力が拮抗してないとファンは確実に 減るだろうよ
Este ano pelo jeito vai ser RBR vs RBR as outras equipes ainda nao engrenaram na temporada.
why are the highlights without Crofty and Brundle?
Its Verstappen highlights
What a boring race
I feel so bad for McLaren, getting beaten by everyone pretty much
1st time new season no accident on race?
What is the point of that DRS thing? We want driver skill not driver aids making it easy!👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Max power 😮😮😮
I think if you look at Aston, Ferrari, Mercedes and Alpine it really depends on the driver. Those cars are really close to eachother so they can all battle for third. Alonse comes out on top because of experience. It is not only the sunday race. You have to setup your car 2 days before.
Imagine Alonso with a Redbull
Max unbeatable, Alonso amazing, ferrari disaster, regular F1 weekend.
Ferrari is just a comic this season.
No one is talking about Hamilton coming from 13th to finish in 6th, AND HES DRIVING A BOAT.
I get the DRS is a big performance boost but the RB going 10% faster than the AM is embarrassing. At this point you may as well create two divisions. The RBs and everyone else
give Alonso a Red Bull please make things easier
No spins, no bumps, no crash, all pure race
Bro said PlayStation game set to easy 😭
Boooooooooooooooooooooring
One take all  and a share for red bull D M X.
Redbull needs to at least start putting Checo and max on the same strategy so we can have some racing
Stroll 😩
Laughable sport right now
“It’s race on”? That’s not how you’re meant to start the race 😢
Hideous commentators
what a boring race
Red Bull hung Checo out to dry
most boring race i've since to date!
Honda F1 ❤  but Honda Motogp 🥱
Max showing why he's the champion. Alonzo on the podium. OG getting it done.
Bring crofty back
So Perez and his fans landed back on earth i gues. 😂
commentaire canal+ >>>>>>>
Looks like today Leclare was in very happy mood… allowed a easy pass to others
From 8th to 1st without a real pass.... another proof that the DRS should be banned to bring back some real racing in F1
It couldn't be more obvious which driver red bull likes more😂
An hour and a half NICE KAR personality garbage before the race did CHAT GPT suggest that?
Whether you like Max or not, you can't deny he's a beast at managing his tyres
There is something strange with the Red Bull, there is cheating that the Formula management must investigate, because the races are decided from now on
Boring race …
this was a total bore fest
United States 🇺🇲
Armado
🙂
Max's double overtake ✨
Boring
Thanks red bull for make f1 so boring
Perez gave it we know for sure! Put Checo to Aston, Mercedes or Ferrari and hundred percent he will beat Max!
FERNANDO!!!
Redbull is destroying Checo with fake strategies only to keep helping Crystaphen win. Shame on you all.
Magnussen v Leclerc ❤‍🔥
Kmag pulled a Petrov on Leclerc
Boring race. Everyone just let Max through 🙄
How boring this Grand Prix is, how RedBull makes it even more boring.
Red Bull’s DRS is very powerful, up to 20 km more than other teams achieve when they open it. The FIA must verify that it is correct, in addition it has to copy some things of IndyCar as use only 2 tire compounds and remove the heaters, otherwise the races become boring
Snoozefest
Yeźzzzz
Magnussen Hass something against Leclerc.   😂
Bro where’s crofty, this commentator’s voice is just bad
Thank you Honda for giving us a reliable engine on todays race👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
What the heck is wrong at McLaren?? Too much Jack Daniels??
Wack voice over instead of crofty
Wheels strategy efective.💪💯🏆🎉
Lame race we Need Rain Every Race
Alonso best driver on grid
Red Bull is just way too OP this season so far! Imagine if Alonso is in one, he would be world champ for sure! Hopefully the season upgrades/updates would make the others come close to RB.
Congratulations Red Bull podium 1/2 Miami  🙏🏆🇲🇽❤
verstappen isnt the best driver but def has the best car
Yawn Verstappen show os not impressive. It's a embarrassment. F1 lie nothing changes other than the amount lies they talk. Anyone familiar with racing Perez let Verstappen by it was a clear order by RB. Cut there spending for 2 season and it would become close f1 is rotten.
This video is basically Max overtaking and Magnussen fighting Charles
garbage
Perez too slow he dosent have the skill to be a top driver.
What on earth is going on with Ferrari. So Red Bull just made a car that is 20% better than everyone else?
I know the Mercedes were overly fast last era but at least the were evenly matched enough to fight the Red Bulls are not
Even the highlights are boring… 😅
Let's get show on the MIA in Formula One  Miami Grand Prix.
Oscar Piastri doing worse than Ricciardo
What a fantastic grand prix, awesome to see Max win here in the states again!
Lance should be replaced, Fernando would need some one of his caliber for the team's sake.
Lol Ferrari battling a haas
What was that chequered flag?
Boooooring
from the qualifying gags to the RB MAX combos, it's been amazing.
DRS makes this race boring. Change my mind
if you miss crofty, you can watch hightlights in bein sports they have highlights also
Why aren't the normal announcers on this highlight reel?
Chris Horner be like  "its coming now guys, after all these years, the multi 21"
When was David Coulthard going to learn to speak English?
Max made a statement with this win and especially the pass on Checo. Reminded him who the number one driver at Red Bull is.
The fact that they were able to do a 8 min video of this race amazes me
Man max is another level, on Perez best day and maxs worst Perez wins by 2 seconds, while max can fall to 10th and on 40 lap on hards match Perez time with Perez on lighter fuel and 15 lap old hards. Max will break every f1 record if he stays around till 38
I'm really questioning whether 3 compounds are really the best choice rn seeing as the hardest (and usually *slowest*) compound outperformed the other tyres by quite a margin...
No refuel, engines with the sound of a Prius and this DRS rules are making F1 each time more a predictable and boring sport.
DRS is a Joke....it makes overtaking so easy it takes away all the tension of Racing. 👎👎👎👎  GT Racing is much better there the Drivers have to use Slipstream and break later and not just press a Boost Button.
I fell asleep...
Amazing how boring F1 has gotten
ridiculous pace of redbulls. i thought i had seen enough with 2020 mercs. but this year redbull might be strongest car i have ever seen in f1
😴😴😴
Somehow im sick of ver always winning. Hmm
We need Crofty's commentary in these highlights man
this has turned into the World "Redbull easily overtaking everyone without any effort" Championship
That’s crazy that Ferrari is having to fight with a customer team… they really have things wrong
Once again Fernando on the podium. It would be fantastic for a veteran like him to finish the races on top 👍. With this car compare with his teamate it’s an upset in which race Very impressed
Boring F1 same old same old.
man this is not right. the red bulls are plainly mechanically faster than the field, and by a lot. it's not fun to watch as a neutral fan.
i don't wanna hear any more smack about miami, this was a great race!
Dreadful race, dreadful circuit, why can’t we invest in a real racing circuit like Watkins Glen and have F1 back there instead of this joke of a track around a stadium.
Hasta contra el coche de Sergio se ve la diferencia del coche de verstappen😪😪😪
Yuki has done a great job today
How the mighty have fallen. Leclerc taking 37 laps to pass a Haas. Wow.
レッドブルホンダのみ別のカテゴリーの如く、ダントツで速い‼︎ 一時期のメルセデスを思い浮かべる😊
So don’t like Verstappen
Max pilotou demais! 43 voltas em ritmo altíssimo com pneu duro! Incrível! 👏👏👏👏👏👏
I know it's impossible but I hope Perez takes the championship
There needs to be a drinking game for how many times "Monegasque" is said in a race.
I honestly felt like alonso could always be 3rd on the podium since he has the 2nd or 3rd best team car on the grid but the stars just didnt aligned in baku
Max is just a different beast. I’d really like to see him in the cars that other drivers are claiming is slow!
🥱
Paravens Perez pela sua incompetência 👏👏👏
Magnussen🥶 vs Leclerc
Crofty?
Kevin and Yuki! So much fun to watch tme today.
VER🐒🐒🐒
AMAZING HONDA PERFECTO ✊
If not for Alonso, this was another snorefest.
zzzzzzzz
No hate but can someone explain me whats the point in watching F1? They all drive in a circle and the driver with the best car wins. Where is the excitement?
Below average races so far this season and one-pitstop strategies make them more boring. It seems the hard compound lasts way too long. Plus RedBull so dominant, they are going for 23 out of 23.
Que pereza ver competir a red bull contra red bull
Max genial!!!
verstappen head and shoulders above very very lucky perez
Lewis, Mercedes????????? Y
C. Leclerc is not even a driver :D
Do people forget Hamilton had the best car on the track for 7 years aha? MV is a driving machine, its the same with his performances on the sim and even e-racing
All fixed
It’s hard to call out everything happening as it’s going on because it happens so dang fast
Technically its Miami Gardens. An FYI when in Miami Gardens keep the car door locked and your head on a swivel because you might lose both😢. I like the Sonic in the Gardens i highly recommend the the Chicago Dog😊.
Amazing job By Perez to secure RedBull 1-2.
formula redbull
This race was actually decent
this is so boring. can the FIA just force everyone to use the same car so that we see who’s actually the best racer, instead of who has the best car
Ferrari makin lama makin lemah
Why is max flying?
This was one of the races ever.
Max is beast 😅
I just ask myself how did you make 8 min video out of this race. Such a boring race with Alonso being the only entertaining part of it…
K. Mag was insane for holding off a Ferrari with a tractor
Checo needs Max to have a few DNF's to have any chance in this championship
Booooooring.
You know that idea Bernie Ecclestone had where the more wins you had the more pit stops you had to take? Not sounding too bad right about now.
What a max !
Red bull is the new Mercedes
Just boring formula 1
Russel can learn from 5:59
ferrari are the new jordan of formula 1😂😂
Who was the genius with the finish flag ? 😡
Nothing like redbull telling max every lap what he needs to bet Checo. While Checo only gets told 4 times.  Such Bs.
Campeão 2023
Verstappen overtaking everyone from P9 to P2 in 15 laps, while on the hard tires, was crazy to watch. That redbull is really something as well
So happy to see Fernando on the podium again...   That pre-race driver announcement show was funny.....  What a waste...
Seriously, I hope F1 gets rid of the DRS, this year has shown so many example of why it is bad and boring for the sport. Remember when making a comeback like Max did meant the driver fought tooth and nail to make a pass proper? Cause I do, and what I saw today was boring and predictable. Drivers who have great defensive skills are basically sitting ducks unless the car passing them mess-up in a bigway.
What a tedious season already, david croft getting excited over a redbull 1-2 again
Checko is just one DNF away from Max
I know max great ..but I wanna fair race like schumi era...all machine equal
what happen again to Mercedes..poor performance..Keep pushing
Grande Fernando the best.
Entrega a taça pro Max, campeonato tá ganho
That Max double overtake looked like the car was going 40mph faster. He blew past them!
Muy dominante Redbull, Verstapen y Perez, no se van a querer bajar nunca del podio.
Max Verstappen has the championship sewn up if he can keep the car out of a wreck.
Alonso pushing Aston Martin on the front while Stroll ,,,,...
We want crofty
This commentator is way better than Crofty.
I really hoped for some technical issues for Max. You can really see that he is #1 for Red Bull and that all their strategy is fixed to his advantage.
People complained about Hamilton winning every race, but won't complain about Max winning all of the time? 😂. But Perez vs Verstappen was pretty fun to watch! The midfield is more exciting than the front. Alonso and Yuki were on fire today.
Leclerc: best qualifier… average racer?
Yet another boring and predictable grand prix :(
Have to say I think I prefer the F1tv guys to the Sky Sports guys
Miami 2023: “wow what an amazing stint he’s such an amazing driver” Brazil 2021: “Hamilton has a superior car to everyone that’s why he overtook everyone”
It's like if all the engineers say's "don't fight Max... Let pass"... The Red Bull it's a beast 😮
Congratulations to Alonso for P1 in the F1 Non-RedBull division !
FERRARI KUDANYA MODOL
Alonso bravo
Please increase duration to 20 minutes atleast..
This podium is officially the new HAM BOT VER
not liking this season so far red bull was supposed to do no upgrades as a penalty 4 this season but yet they had 2 major upgrades on
It's quite clear: RedBull hates Sergio Perez!!!!
Outro sena.da gosto ver arrojo dele
I am Team Checo but Verstappen definitely drives like playing a video game
Red Bull  and Max 🥱 🥱.  Too fast making it a boring sport 🥱🥱.
i miss crofty so bad😢
Honestly I was amazed there were no DNFs or red cars in this race. Some great driving and overtakes. Hamilton and Verstappen were beasts on the track.
I hope perez will keep challenging verstappen. That is the only way f1 2023 championship will be exciting
Stick alonso in one of them redbull and it would be already game over for the rest lol 😅
A que Pérez fallaste teniendo la pol no entiendo esta raro, ojala y su equipo no empieze a poner preferencias, ojala aiga ganado bien... El llorón je.
I hoped a revenge from ferrari, nothing, i hoped a battle Alonso-Vertappen for the title (old vs young generation of champion), i honnestly don't believe anymore, and i thought maybe we could have some interresting battle for title between Perez and Verstappen as was Rosberg Hamilton, but i fool myself : put Vertappen in the last grid start place and he win. This season will be the same as the last one, we already know who will become the champion...
so boring
Fast race, but very very boring, just like Azerbaijan……F1 is getting far to predictable 😮😂😂
Why can't the highlights be with Crofty's commentary?
Why are they not using Sky F1's stream for the highlights? Crofty is on a league of his own when it comes to F1 commentary
This is the most boring of motorsports.
I wouldn't mind giving Redbull and verstappen the championship , dont let them race for this season and it would be more interesting racing . I know it not realistic but i said it when it in mercedes's dominant era .  I think with this massive gap , knowing who will be 1 and 2 take away party of the fun
All Cars could finish well, Wow it's fantastic race,  Congrats Max, Checo, Alonso, RedBull is so overpower,
Let’s take some time to appreciate Ferrari’s race now. Once again proving they have no idea what they are doing
I don't know what they did with the cameras this race but the cars look so much faster, That Verstappen double overtake into T1 had me screaming
Yuki is p11 again
guys im starting to think this redbull team might have a decent car
This race was Epic... this season is really an exciting one for the fan!!! Amazing job again by both Max and Perze... Max is untouchable... love the battle between both Max and Perze!!! Excellent job by Alonso, Hamilton did a great job as well... Magnussen and both Alpine drivers did an awesome job on the tracks too. The fans get to see some epic battles... love how this season going so far...💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥
At this rate, the season is close to being over. Nobody can even come close to the red bulls. So sad
???for red bull cars something is not right with way max flies by everyone, when everyone is equal battle....something smells fishy
Booooooooring!
How is this longer than 4 seconds?
theses races are legit so boring now who gona win the race red bull like  theres legit no chance for anyone else
I bet if max started 20th he would have still won it 😂. What a legend
Nobody has anything for the Red Bull team this year
PSA: better highlights (and crofty) are on Bein sports channel.
When RB give 100% their engine potent to max and only give 90% to perez due to his position.... 🤦. That is unfair. Perez still the winner
With DRL, overtakes appear fake, arranged. Almost no emotion. It's artificial. Unfair with who is in front.
fell asleep about midway through the race. didn't think it could be less interesting than baku, but here we are. hard tires prob shouldn't last 45 laps.
Yawn
Fia should investigate what red bull did to max car????why his car so fast is not fair even his teammates car look so slow compared mac car😊
Just one investagation will ruin RB just like they did to ferrari
Banyak duit, juara sulit, target juara, menang aja susah bobrok, rombak squad
boring
Max......Maxx......the absolute Maximum Maxxxxxx
Who calls this BS a sport?? Real sports require skill, not whoever has the best car. Gonna stop watching this.
Not even the commentators are excited.
F1 is such a joke. Give them all the same car so we can truly see who’s the best.
Well this championship race is rapidly becoming a snooze fest. Time to go with that performance weight penalty just to shake everything up a bit.
Boring season
Very boring race as a Ferrari Fan 😣😭
the red bulls are so ridiculous it makes watching the battle for the lower positions the best part of the season
페레즈가 우승해야지 미디움으로 35바퀴  가능할듯
Those bulls are crazy fast
WOW Red Bulls first and second again.... so unpredictable! XD HAHA This is the most boring championship ever!
Great drive by Alonso 👏👏, I hope he wins the next race 💚💚 and that big screen moment was super fun 😂😂
Ferrari bobrok
Ненавижу Ферстапена
Max win
The really impressive thing here is getting over 8 minutes of highlights out of one of the most boring races in history.
사인츠는 애들 장난하나 추월을 너무 쉽게 내줘
What a legend
Worst intro to a race ever
try hards overly produced noobs
Red bull is doing what mercedez was doing in 6 seasons.. now is their turn of dominance which make the sports kinda boring
Verstappen = The Alien / Perez = The "Sancho Panza" / Alonso = The Professor   .............   And Leclerc = The Brat (overvalued driver) xD!!
😎❤️❤️❤️❤️
Redbull and redbull again. Boring😅
👎
The most boring F1 season I have ever seen. 1 team is outperform everyone. FIA must do something with all those focking regulations, which, I’m sure that Red Bull tricks somehow.
Painful GP to watch. Last two have been absolutely boring.
Booooooriiiiing
Boring. Anyone can win with the Redbull. Massively OP. I'm seriously not fussed about watching any more of this season already
Max is the best !
Perez
max's red bull is legal
Honda
Simplemente perez corrió para ser segundo 😅
big cars an tyres 40 laps... zzzzz
Consistency is key, especially for Yuki😂 it's a shame that he was again p11, i think he is more matured driver and he deserve better car
Sains nunca.sera mejor que Leclerc ni peres mejor que max hay que verlo con la cabeza y no con el corazón
Even the highlights are boring. What's fun about a race where you already know the finish line? I find it more fun to watch the paint dry on the wall.
No wonder Red Bull did that little BS with the halt of the engine development for everybody since they were "taking over" Hondas f1 yet they didn't.. that essentially gave Red Bull a one-year head start on an engine that was already great.. boy they cant win normally through hard work and effort they have to cheat to win.. pretty spinless
SUPER MAX!
Cringe and boring is all I can say.
In before Carlos says something about he couldn’t get the right feeling in the car
Red bull set up Ver : 90% Checo : 75%
These races are boring now
Sering² podium Alonso
Max fandom frolicking in a pool of duchue with knowing it’s their playground.
Hats off to Lewis and max today … 7 and 8 overtakes respectively..with messes up quails for both
Sering² podium Alonso
One of the most boring races I have EVER seen 😣😣
F1 is so boring these days
max the goat
Not fair race boring
I hope Alonso keeps racing for awhile. I think most folks/fans come to see him as much as Hamilton. He draws a crowd, with his talent
3 Red Bulls on the podium yet again.
The First *EVER* Full-House FIA Formula One World Championship Race Without Using Country Name As A Official Grand Prix Name (Probably).   08/05/2023 05:57.
REDBULL telling Perez to let Max go b4 the race even started 😂
" its race on " my ears are bleeding !!!!!!!!!
McLaren absolutely no where again.
Who won the most races starting out of the top 5?
If I was Pérez I would make the luggage and going home.
Zak needs to consider a career change
Red Bulls can start from the back row and still win all the races... boring championship with no history. They have at least 1 second advantage over everyone.
bizarre redbull drs
Boring
So disappointed on Checo 😪
It's too easy for max hahaha. Anyways awesome race especially kevin and charles battle.
F1 is getting even more boring.
I imagine that the verstapen Engines óptimos are close to blow out, was Clear a that hi has a more agresive RPM Map.
the fact that no one retired is amazing
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
😎✌💯💯
is there really any point in watching F1 anymore! Let me guess, RedBull 1 and 2
I missed the Magnussen and Verstappen overtake at the same time on Leclerc
im started to hate Max for his..dominion in this..industry..like schumacher n hamilton had done in previous season..i hate this..unfight race season..
i hope Sergio wins in Mexico
The only thing PER was said to be better than VER was at managing tires. Today that has been proven wrong too.
That stint by Max on those old tyres **chefs kiss**
Verstappen is like the 2nd coming.
Are people still watching this ?
Calling these "highlights" is a bit of a stretch
What a let down Formula One was. I spent wayyy too much money and so a lousy race. Live and learn. Won’t be doing that again.
So refreshing not to hear Crofts unnecessary screaming
That's one of the top 3 best races of verstappen's career 🔥🔥🔥
Ferrari 😂
A Very Boring Race.
Verstapen no le gana a nadie sin DRS
8 minutes of highlights?? Max would have been like 2mibs cause literally nothing happened the whole race. Most boring thing I've watched prolly ever
pfff so booooring.  whre is f1 fighting and racing with teams and racers??
Verstappen isn't human!
That last overtake at 5:55 by Max Verstappen was actually very nice.
1-2 for Red Bull 🐂 Racing Honda, ganbatte! 🏎🏁
Podrían terminar el mundial porque solo ganan los mismos como puede haber tantísima diferencia de coches este mundial no tiene gracia
What happens when Checo becomes World Champion?  He turns of his playstation and goes to bed😂
Ta ficando chata pra krl a F1 so tem Redbull não tem mais ngm pra ganhar
Must have lowered the Miami ticket prices.
another boring F1 race!
Not seeing Hamilton win hurts my soul
This time was just ridiculous the power difference that redbull engine has over the other teams. Other cars are like moving chicanes. Verstappen overtakes 2 cars at the begining of a straight. I'm tired of this one sided seasons that keep showing up. 1 or 2 competitive seasons and here we go again😩
there were highlights!!!???
lap 57: Ver -> Per + 5 sec -> Alo + 20 sec. exciting racing but an even more exciting championship. i wonder which team will win in Monaco
IMHO,  one of the best races I have seen in a long time, no safety cars,  no dnf,  no machanicals,.... boring maybe,  but great race !
I said it yesthat max going to win today and he would drive leave all of them. And he did. Imagine if he started the race in 1 2 pole position.  . Well done max
Max is cringe. Sergio and Fernando are based.
And the little baby wins again most arrogant man ever
Still believe in you Lewis
Maxs car is just in easy mode
This track is so boring
These Mercedes “upgrades” better be worth the hype - because these red bulls are running farther and farther away. They’re untouchable
Boring ahh race
I think within the next 2 seasons without any drastic rule changes we gonna have some crazy competition
Here comes the "boring race" comments just because Red Bull won again
Great comeback by Lewis 💯💯
What's with the commentators of these highlights being different to the official F1 commentators?
Boring
Someone please explain how max is faster than checo in similar car. Max p9 to p1
Absolute class driving from verstapen phenomenal, reminds me of the days when Hamilton dominated for many years with the best car.
We miss crofty
Alonso is the dark horse! 😎
The NASCAR race was so much better than this snoozefest. Barely any passing, cars separated by 10+ seconds, typical F1 race.
I don’t think Red Bull was trying their hardest to help Perez win.
Why you are not using Martins’s narration??
como siempre FERRARI es un desastre.
it is so obvios that Verstappen's car is faster that Checo Perez's car I don't think is fear.
Checo will need to learn how to beat Max fair and square
Verstappen's performance is too dominant. Amazing race and happy for Alonso. On the whole this season might still be easier on the Mercedes fan compared to the Ferrari fan
Mucha, muchísima velocidad del RB de verstapen, a la hora de rebase. Rebasa a cualquier carro con muchísima facilidad. Buen piloto? Sin duda lo es.  TRAMPOSO: sin duda, también lo es.  Repito: muchísima velocidad.  Los otros monoplazas, son demasiados lento, o qué pasa?
Why not already hand over the championship to RBR and Verstappen? As if there will be any sudden surprises? RBR will 1-2 every race till the end  and driving away with ease from the rest of the field. RBR will have 20 months advantage in development time simply due to the fact every other team wasn't allowed to correct their cars within a season since 2022. And RBR only incrementally needs to improve to stay ahead until 2026. To win every single race and leave no chance to any team simply as the regulations forbid teams from improving to an extend they can catch up to RBR. closing 20 months in just a few weeks during winter is impossible with little resources, and its simply not realistic to pretend any team other than RBR stand the slightest of chance to win eve a race if RBR and their drivers doesn't make a mistake?
What's the difference between George Russell and a brick wall?  A brick wall has more personality.
Max has unfair advantage. His car is simply faster than the rest. They should an experiment and one day let him drive one of the other team's cars and see how he does.
Why didn’t Perez stick to mediums considering they were faster than hards? Very strange that they essentially changed tires and positions
F1 has really become boring again, i wish the other teams were closer to Red Bulls pace to at least make the race interesting
well. that's it. not going to watch F1 anymore😅
Ricciardo happiest man in F1 right now? I'm glad he is sitting this season out, driving that McLaren tractor must be soul-crushing.
This sport is so dull now.
In between LEC crashes and SAI penaltis Ferrari doesn't need rivals at all.
8 mins of highlight, How?
“The superior power of the ferrari” imagine losing to a haas
Pérez no tiene talento para ser campeón, triste. Arriba México y fuerza a Lord Max!!
Glad i dont waste my time anymore with this.  Spain 96 Spa 98 or Estoril 85 are way better than this.  -U10
How have they managed to strech the highlights to 8 mins, nothing happened
Never watching this years' formula one, but some last year. Always been a Ferrari fan 🔥
2 races in a row where lewis was basically doing things but wasn't noticed 😂
Red bull over power
Bruh Ferrari 🤣😂 Always 🤡  Alonso better Ferrari 🤣🤣
If anybody needed confirmation that Adrian Newey is the most important person in F1…
Is it a crime to bring back "lights AWAY WE GO" 😢 idc who does it they just got to nail it
If the highlights are any indication, Miami was a snoozefest.
RBR 1-2 then Alonso, rinse and repeat
As an American. Curious how the wrest of the world feels about F1 Moana? Do you guys like the track and vibes? 🍻
most boring sport the world.
What a snooze fest
That RB DRS is no joke!
Si cambiará el carácter me gustaría más tiempo una cara de pesao.y de rencor  odio no se pero que pesao.tio estoy hablando de vertapen.
I swear, if I don't hear "it's lights-out and away we go" next time I watch this highlights, I'm going to flip lol Lack of Crofty is really ruining my experience.
So painful this voice.... Where are you Martin and croft?
Boring!!!!!!
Vien por El equipo RB   max y checo   excellentes pilotos👍
F1 is BOORING
Boring 😴
This edit are just bland. Not a single Race Control/ Steward message shown. Even the radio communication between pilot & engineer not included.
another cheating display by red bull
Phenomenal race from Yuki and Kmag
Jajajaja lo de Pérez ya es de risa!!!
Wish I could dislike this video without it ruining my algorithm
Leclerc out
Boring race, slight entertainment to see hamilton climb the positions a bit but very boring race.
GO HAAS
Verstappen owned that race
Bored; bored!!!!
Where is crofty?😢
The Max and RB combo are too OP it’s getting boring.
Ver and Ham had great days for sure but Yuki was my driver of the day, he was cooking in that AT
Nice to see ferrari doing well again though fair play
Alonso should replace Sainz to challenge Redbull. Charles bottling it continuously. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Tbh this season is pretty boring season red bull is the only team winning
yawn did i miss something 🥱
no one but perez tried to held verstappen, not even a little. a champ with no rivals its not a champ
bored
Most boring race ever because no cars got DNFs. But do you what? This race is so far the cleanest race ever.
"Say goodbye to the Red Bull.."  gotta love that comment :-) ! Max Masterclass once again...
What a miserably boring season
Verstappen is an absolute animal.
Алонсо Чемпіон.
Max campeão 2023!
Redbull wins again and it's not even close. This is getting really boring.
To think Piastri burned all bridges to get himself into that McLaren...
max use aliens car? what a jet
All Drivers No DNF's in Miami.
i love to see Alonso still keeping up with the red bulls.. anyone could win in a red bull
you have to give credit where its due, what a race by the world champion!
The redbull looks beautiful
This season is so boring just give redbull the title now
Claro
I'm Dutch but I absolutely love the fact that Alonso is shaming team Mercedes with the same engine.  Go Fernando! He is still the new champion standard.
Tired of max already. Check more deserving
Nice highlights of paint drying
Where is David Croft??
Pirelli seem to have made the hard tyre too hard/durable.  It making the racing dull that drivers can go so long on one set if tyres.
It's lovely to read all the comments, no Verstappen haters here 😂
Viva méxico 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 team checo
Borefest viewer numbers gonna tumble by race 10
Is this the slowest track??
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Boring.
After watching how easily Max breezed through the field, can there be any doubt that Red Bull is again being allowed to run a ch…***LAWYER ALERT*** …  that the Red Bull cars enjoy a strong technical advantage?
Shame the race wasn’t a few hours later as it would have been a great way of sending me to sleep. These races get more and more boring with each week. F1 in a bit of trouble.
Fun fact: Alonso has beaten both Alpines every single race since they let him go
The fine for the cost cap worked very well.
F1 is so boring with these RB cars 😴
Video not available?
Holly s... this is boring af
Max just handing out Ls to everyone. Hes like that Expert AI you can never beat. His car is just wow.
of course
I cant stand Miami, De Santis, and those racist illegal Cubans!!! 🇲🇽🇷🇺
Don't think ill bother watching the rest of the season. We know whos going to win, Ver or Per, cant see anyone else winning a race.
Boring… one team always dominates in F1. Americans are used to much higher levels of competition in NASCAR and Indy Car.
Even the 8 minutes of highlights was boring, I cant imagine sitting through that entire race.
at this point F1 is just a waste of resources
Don't think ill bother watching the rest of the season. We know whos going to win, Ver or Per, cant see anyone else winning a race.
missing the lights out and away we go, overall horrible commentators. Also you can easily make the highlights better and longer by focusing on all the overtakes including the lower order drivers,
Why all the hate towards Max? what is this noncense.......in 1:18 in and every time Max does something , the coment blantely states it's all CAR........You sad sad people.......
Formula 1 racing (if you can still call it that) is getting Sooooo boring. I just left the TV on and went and vacuumed the house. Might as well have mailed in the results.
Hamelton get lost
F1 is becoming boring to watch with one team being so dominant
That was some of the worst checkered flag waving I have ever seen
Unreal casting for the rb battle
Please tell us how these commentators and crew arent Verstappen/Reb Bull FAN BOYS without tellin us. Great job of mixing up the highlights guys! 😂👌🏾
The best race this season 😊 ... Hard truth
🤦🏻‍♂️I think we had enough of Leclerc and sainz in Ferrari 🤷🏻‍♂️ like really? Battling with Haas became the highlight of this race🤣 what’s wrong with Ferrari these days 🫠
Think it just shows how next level the Redbulls are compared to everyone else..
Para la próxima temporada Red Bull debería traer a alguien que en verdad le haga batalla a Max
Red Bull vs Red Bull
I think this race showed what to expect for the rest of the season. If he still keeps winning while being compromised in some way there is now way Checo can keep this up for the full season, both wins Checo got benefitted from Max problems and a safety car. The longer the seasons goes to rule out these outliers the more it will show how far ahead Max really is.  The rest of the grid is so much fun to watch, having RB on there level would make for one of the best seasons I could remember. But like this it just changed from one era of dominance to the next.
Excellent work on the highlights, Dominic Smith!
WHERE IS CROFT
I should start gambling with the consistency of the podium this season.
where is crofty?
Fantastic Bulls😍
Please shut that guy up
Great race by KMAG on of my current top 5 drivers on the grid!
That was exciting !!!
Golpe de autoridad de MV... Demostrando quién y por qué es Campeón del Mundo...👍🏻
Another boring race.. like the Hamilton/Bottas Mercedez era.:
This race just proves how much of an advantage redbull have after cheating In development last year yet the FIA did nothing and will do nothing ridiculous
1k downvotes from some salty mafos 🤣🤣
Ver again ver again. Borring
This race was one of Verstappens best ever! Undeniable talented 🥇
Remind me why Formula 1 isn't boycotting the US? They have no problem virtue-signaling when they are boycotting Russia. Last I check it wasn't Russia who invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, destroyed Syria, Libya, Cuba, Venezuela.... I think it was "the beacon of freedom & democracy" United States of America behind all those wars. Wait, I get it now. It's not about what's right or wrong, it's about supporting "the current thing".
Absolute professionalism from Perez, you could tell he wanted to be more aggressive on the defense but it's not worth risking a 1-2 finish for RB.
Checo La Tortuga Perez siempre a la sombra de Max Verstappen
Thats exactly what F1 is these days. Play Station game set on easy....
Were or the "borring" comments
who is this commentator?? he has no emotion in his voice. bring back brundle and crofty.
Drs is boring
verstappen will be the new hamilton, the history will reapeat anyways, and everyone will hate him at the end like always
Great driving bull's 👏👏👏👏
I wish Alex Albon could get some points
こんなのただのフェルスタッペン無双じゃないか
When you have a car so much faster than everyone else like RedBull does DRS is just not fair. Verstappen was going past the rest as if they were driving toy cars.
i am ashamed to see ferrari...
Why is there no commentary from David Croft?
This race was the worst for entertainment this year . Just happens a little too often in f1
Why isnt crofty on here anymore?
Ferry is sleeping😴
Super max🥳🥳🥳🥳
It’s impressive they squeezed a 8 minute video
Great Alonso
I want what this announcer is smoking lol
Mclaren is just depression
Clearly red bull have a fast car and a really fast car! Red bull prefer max winning! Come on merc sort it out, you have the greatest driver ever and future legend In struggling cars! Can’t stand another max championship, would of been ok with Perez winning it but that won’t be allowed
first time lulu been given a team order
And i was hopefull there was going to be a title fight, if checo cant win with max starting from 9th, then he's just not it
what happened to stroll?
Se los dije Max verstappen iba a ganar la carrera xq tenía mejor ritmo y más rápido q todos pero bien checo esto se puso bno
Hey look Mercedes are only 33 seconds behind Redbull…
En Red Bull están claras las órdenes de equipo otro mundial para Max . O por algún acierto de los demás equipos le presionen a Red Bull
What a highlight !! very well edit, thanks alot
Sergio Pérez el barrichelo del 2023
Max is built different. He starts p9 when his team mate is on pole and wins, with no safety car and no rain
The pre-race announcer was terrible, just like last year. Danica Patrick looked awful. She needs a new wardrobe person, and definitely a new hair dresser. Max goes from ninth to first. There you have it.
What I love the most about Red Bulls success this season is they are doing it with sanctions for exceeding the cap limit lol  All the whiner' and cry babies that said 2 mill was such a big difference  Great race Max you did what your fans already knew about you. You are dedicated determined
The overtakes were so nice to watch especially between kmag and charles
what happened to sargeant?
Ngl without alo, 2023 would be kinda boring
Another redbull 123😂
Sad all the passing is done with DRS. The new cars are a bit of a let down.
Sry but it’s quite hard to watch verstappen overtook literally everyone except Perez with the hard compound of tire while everyone else uses the Medium ones. The Red Bull This Year is from another world compared to the rest of the grid. 🥵
That Red Bull is FAST! So fast that it overtook two of them in one go!
Verstappen podia salir ultimo ... Igual terminaba primero...
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Redbull dominating once more. Loving it! 😄
Formula 1 today is a boring sport.
0:46 that just shows how brutal Red Bull's DRS is, absolutely insane
Aero Dinamis nya  Ferrai dan Mercedes  paling jelek di 2023
2023 season:  Max win Perez win  Repeat   Bonus Alonso 3rd
Totally "VERSTAPPEN!! 🏴‍☠
I REMEMBER WHEN IN 2018 FERRARI WAS SO NOTORIOUSLY OVERPOWERED AND FIA INVESTIGATE THE CAR DEEPLY AND NERFD THE CAR, WHY IS NO ONE SAYING NOTHING ABOUT THE REDBULL??? MAX PASSES CARS LIKE IF HE IS RACING ANOTHER CATEGORY, EVERYONE IS ON F2. FIA IS KILLING THE SPORT!!!
Max does it again
Great Commentary as usual Alex,DC and james!
Lol leclerc never expected to be racing kmag all afternoon
we'll get him next time CHECO!
These commentators are awful.
Redbull to much op
We're back to the nightmare of 2019-2020
f1 in miami is such a vibe
Феррари больше не буду болеть
Checo has a chance for the title!
F1 parking lot GP!
I can’t believe that all the teams have got it soooo wrong… they could race with only 3 wheels and still give 10 seconds to the 3rd…
Redbull is clear this year such a great car just wowowow really
F1 the yawn in sport dominated by a horrible team and driver
Max passing everyone on the grid like Mary Poppins did on her carousel horse against those race horses 😪 this dominance needs to be challenged next season, lets hope the teams can close that gap cos its going to be boring for the foreseeable. Would love to see a McLaren challenge again
ME ACUERDO CUANDO EN 2018 O 2019 INVESTIGARON A FERRARI POR SER NOTORIAMENTE OVERPOWERED Y BANEARON SU MEJORA. PORQUE AHORA CON REDBULL NADIE DICE NADA??? MAX PASA A TODOS COMO SI ESTUVIERA EN OTRA CATEGORIA, ESTAN MATANDO EL ESPECTACULO.
HAM BOT VER became VER PER ALO
Mclaren just keep delivering,  and it's brilliant to wacth, keep punching Zak Brown.
Somebody please put Leclerc in the second red bull. We need someone capable of taking the fight to Verstappen!!!
Not one comment appreciating max‘s performance…why everyone so bitter…
What's up with these late race gains Hamilton is taking advantage of
Leclerc will never be a wdc. So inconsistent.
CONGRATULATION TO HONDA ENGINE. CONGRATS CHECO FOR WINNING THE RACE IN MIAMI...
I swear that red bull are cheating
I just can't enjoy F1 without David Croft's voice.
Can we have 1 season without a dominating team please? I think the standartization (?) of carparts hasn't gone far enough.
WOWZA MAX WON AGAIN!?!?!?! 😴🥱😴🥱😴
boring
f1 is a borefest
verstappen everytime when he overtakes inside is like "you don't want to crash? then i have to overtake" that's why i don't like him
So tired of vercrapin this vercrapin that.  He is a sore winner and sore loser!
Now next time going to Las Vegas!
Indeed, boring race
Max V. is leaving no doubt. What a drive!
No "lights out & away we go"?
How tf did Alonso even knew stroll had made an overtake in the back of the field 😂😂
Masterclass Max 🎉
Yippee Red Bull won, who would have expected it. 🥱
Nothing can stop that Honda engine.  Just in a galaxy all its own.
Max making sure everybody knows who’s really the #1 driver
Max is from another world.
What a race what a start I can’t believe it without safety car
After this Race im Still trying to figure out Why F1 Races Here.
Should be illegal what red bull are doing
great drive for Ham. F1 is getting better and better, but its still not like the days of Ferrari and Shumi
Car on another level. Driver on another level. Product garbage.  1 year in the last decade has been exciting. 1.
That’s so unfair to Perez with the hard tyres all the way towards the end. Red Bull have built an easy championship winning car this year. Cheat-code enabled.
Why no Crofty and Brundle on the highlights anymore??
Cadê o narrador antigo ?? Esse tem uma voz de pato
SuperMAX😎🔥
Joke of a season. One car has been allowed to bend the rules without any severe punishment. What a joke.
If you can ignore the cringe money fest that came along with this weekend, it was a decent race
6:09 - don’t know why I bothered watching 🙄
It’s lights out ???????
Big shoutout to the great camerawork. Often comes out overlooked.
where  is crofty ?
7:11  The organization of formula 1 needs to stop with this mania for retired athletes to give the final flag of the races. It is completely emotionless. Hire a professional.
Boring and predictable.
PEREZ ROBBED
Phenomenal race by Max! Literally showing them who the nr. 1 driver on the grid is when he got out of the car 😂 What a boss.
Alonso is the only entertaining factor this season. Ferrari and Mercedes miles away.  F1 had and has a big problem with same cars dominating over several seasons in a row.  Same story repeats over and over again. Its just boring
Ferrari is dying after Shumi.
Para qué lo abuchean 😂
Fisrt!
Fernando really is showing great form in the battle of the rest of the grid.
Verstappen highlight- miami 2023 😂
Lalalaala Max verstapen !!!¡!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🍾🔥
Sergio Pérez being so soft on the grid when it’s time to fight with max 😏
Did well to get 8 minutes of highlights out of the race
And the Perez sabotage begins ...
The difference beetwen redbull and the rest of grid is amazing
Nerf redbull
I love that the f1 community is always so nice in the comments, everyone rooting for everyone
🥱🥱🥱😴😴💤
Amazing Max n Alonso🤭🤭
This was the most mid-race in hsotory, no safety no nothing. If it wasn't for Ver and Checo battle, it would have been close to Azerbaijan Race…
YET another boring parade 1-2 for RB.
So glad we got a straight fight between the Red Bulls. On very different strategies, obviously, but on the track is where we want to see the action.
My wife caught me snoring.  No honey ... I'm watching!
A masterclass from Verstappen! Truly gifted with an instinctive, competitive intelligence , The f€@ktards ‘s in sky F1 seem to miss this.
this seasons a snoozefest
Great job from Piastri, really pushing Lando....   😂
Hamilton the Goat... hahahah never. He always had the best car and is a decent consistent driver but compared to senna or schumacher he lacks.
Yeay
MAX is like Man City , you know that they are gonna win, so boring
A FERRARI STRUGGLING TO PASS A HAAS CAR. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH FERRARI
What a boring chequered flag without any mechanics cheering
The commentary is so bland these days.
Amazing how less people note that the hard was the better tyre today. It was luck for Max to start on 9th, otherwise he would have started on medium as well
I'm always amazed at this channel's ability to stretch such boring GPs into 8 to 10 minutes "highlights".
Alonso flexing on his team, with the nice stroll overtake. Charles was nowhere. Max schooled checo. And Lewis with the far superior strategy couldn’t beat george
Suprisingly little drama this race
Where's tsunoda's overtake that was a beauty
Boring 🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱….
Did I hear Crofty correctly, 30 Thousand 'fans' there today trackside? If so Miami don't deserve a race.
Yeahhh...
They gave a decent car to Alonso, hes showing whos the boss.
ELON MUSK & MAX VERSTAPPEN TEM O MESMO FOGUETE 🚀
REDBULL IMBATÍVEL NESSA CORRIDA 🏎️🏁😎🙏 SEM PALAVRAS
Its a joke how far ahead RedBull developed their cars, gambling with what turned out to be a joke of a cost-cap penalty and now they can just push a button and drive away from anyone, no matter who is driving the energy drink cars. Its not like anyone can say "what a drive!" because they just have more power than anyone.
8 mins for this garbage race?
Get rid of Miami, please.
Yo soy mexicano y Sergio Pérez es un piloto para ser segundo. En esta carrera se comprueba que mad max es el campeón y merecidamente. Checo no tiene lo que se necesita para  ganar. Un piloto de segunda y su trabajo es complementar a max. No tiene para más. Le faltaron producto de gallina
C de pires en pire le championnat est déjà fini c de la merde 😂😂😂😂😂
Ridiculous how easily Red Bull just flew past the others with drs. Absolutely 0% chance to fight against them with that kind of speed difference.
This was a boring race.
I feel so sorry for Perez the way Redbull treats him.
Max Verstappen  he is the fake champion  2021 Sir Lewis been robbed, If you put sir Lewis in the same car with max ( red bull ) And  you can see who the best  😁😁😁
Losing all hope that there'll be a fight first 1st. Was kinda sad to see Perez only being 3-4 sec ahead of Verstappen after he had to pass 8 cars.
Anyone else notice Max didn't pass a single car without DRS ... 9th to 1st is nice.. but there is another driver who passed more cars and climbed more spots on the finishing grid (sadly also mostly with DRS). Driver is skill is irrelevant as long as DRS remains in the sport.
boring
ÕNNITLEN, RED BULL ON IKKAGI KÕIGE VÕIMSAM, SUPER😄🤩🤩
This was Max showing enough is enough to Checo! Max gave an uppercut to Checo! Winning when starting from P9 and Checo P1 without a safetycar or anything. Perez was lucky a number of races but today Max showed why he is a 2 time WC and will become a 3rd time WC this year!
Lec needs to go
this race needs an extended highlights
Perez who?
Happy for alonso!
magnussen trolling leclerc
No one is talking about Kmag in a customer team casually holding off LeCrash for 90% of the race?    Ive lost everything for leclerc now, Russell and the others are 100% better, well maybe not in qualifying but yeah.
How times have changed, now that a Ferrari is battling a Haas 😮
Horner is very happy with todays race results.
Lewis was incredible! Like the Lewis of old, he's still got it and some🙌
Alonso, Maestro.
I dont like Verstappen, but every one must admit he is most likely the fastest driver ever in F1 history.
Someone wake me up when F1 is interesting again 🥱
Yea, its getting a bit predictable. I just hope Perez can put up a fight.
I'm here to remind Perez fans who #1 is!
The gulf in car quality is so big verstappen would still win if he started from the pits on Monday morning. Boring.
結局、今年の定番のレッドブルの二台だけがぶっちぎり、3位が誰になるかだけ。フェラーリ頑張ろうね。
Ferrari 🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮
Corre muito. Talento a flor da pele!
Is there even a point to this year’s race? Redbull will always win
Another snooze fest
Max’s double overtake was 👌
Nice to see no team orders for checo when max came up. Kept it respectful and clean
Boring
Max car illegal
Why Ferrari? 😢
Ferari gak ada pembalapnya bernyali
Sky F1 commentators: “Well Verstappen, show us what you’ve got to impress us and win from P9”… Verstappen: “Hold my RedBull”…  😂
Redbull car on diff level
The Track is hard to overtake Vestappen: Can I try
What do you know, that was actually an interesting race without the need of any safety car surprises to mix things up. Probably thanks to the funny starting grid tbh, but overtaking also seemed not as difficult as many people seemed to fear.
I heard Lewis didn't sign contract for next year.   It would be some brave mind for Toto if he decide to add KMag to his team. 😃😃
I was expecting Alonso P1 but bulls are just freaking fast.  Adrian, you freaking genius.
Alonso is the GOAT
Piastri up 6 places in the first few corners had me going but not to be.
What happen to FERRARI TEAM...
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Maxs hunt... man on target
Those Redbulls are like F16
Perez is absolutely Embarrassing…  Once, twice, three times four time  No coincidence….   With that car he should find pace unlike his absurd interview response..
I think checo could have won that if he did what max did with the tire change. Tye grip difference between hards and mediums is just ridiculous.  But other then that they both had an awesome race.
Alonso absolute genius))
We are living in Max Verstappen's era. He is inevitbale.
Verstappen, is amazing. What a drive.
It's OVER THIS YEAR FOR EVERYONE   VERSTAPPEN IS A MONSTER
Boring race tbh
At least alonso is back to his 3rd place ways we just need to see a win now
I'm sure Hamilton celebrated with a Bud Light
VAMOS ALONSO 🇪🇦😊
The medium tires ruined Checos chances at the end of the race. Either way great fight for the championship so far
Checo last week: I am a super power and can beat Max!!!! Vamos carájo que éste es MI año cabrónes!!! Max this week starting from 9th: let me show you what I can do with 48 laps old hards versus your 15 laps old mediums..... MASTERCLASS.....🙄  And HEY! Let´s not forget about ¨old Alonso¨......That man is KING with what he achieves in that AM.
Aca el que venga a decir que checho es mejor que verstappen dejame decirle que no sabe ni mierda de F1.
Ini semua sudah dirancang…makin bosan F1 kali ini…
This was an amazing race with so much action to thrill all F1 fans .......... but ....... for some unexplained reason, your editing staff did to edit most of the action out. Please ask your video editors to reflect an impartial, but exciting edited version in future. Thanks
getting bored to see Red Bull 1, 2 again
Again and again . The one two position between Max and Sergio . Who can stop them ? . We also wached brilian performance of Alonso . So far , what he has done is fantastic .
Max holding off hard tyres for like 45 laps and still doing fast lap before switching to med tyres.
Who else fell asleep watching this? 🤡
Corridinha chata, do meio pro final eu já estava dormindo.
DRS needs to go
Verstappen and Perez will finish the season 1-2. Ferrari needs to get rid of Leclerc, useless in races.
Max just wants the record for most wins from different grid positions. He’s now equaled most (1,2,3,4,7,9,10 and14)
Well at least the battle with the Ferrari and Haas kept things a little interesting.
Starting to get real boring in 2023
Red bull fan or not, this race was dull as dishwater.
Perez on new hard tires slower hen Max on very old hard ti res! the reporter doesn`t even mention it!
i wish we could have seen max and checo on the same tire strat
Congrats 🎉🎉🎉 Outstanding Honda not only 🏁Verstappen !!
Painfully boring race. The Leclerc-Magnussen battles were really the only highlight. The Redbull pace is so fast that it's unfunny.
Very lucky max vertappen 😂
I love Formula 1 and Soccer soooo much!!!!!
Not interested RedBull to over pover. FIA must changes regulation
0:48 - Max pulled a "THROUGH GOES HAMILTON!" Well played, Max.
Whoever got 8 minutes out of this race deserves a Trophy
Another Master Class Weekend for Oracle Red Bull.  Unreal driving by Max, unreal strategy by the team.
Boredom again, the red bulls won
can anyone say why max  verstappen has so many DRS
we all know who will win. stop the race. give him the crown instead
Pretty boring race, as practically always.
Ferrari looks awful....
That was a nice nap
Max isn’t from this plannet
Verstappen Shocked me on those Old Hard Tyres ( Tires)
This is getting boring.  When Mercedes was blowing people away the rules got changed to make it more competitive.  Maybe F1 need to do that again.  I’m really wondering how many more races I want to watch this year given we know what is going to happen already.
boring 🥱🥱🥱
This season makes me miss Mercedes dominance era
Absolute monster opening from Verstappen. Passed everyone while on the hards. Then finished it off on the mediums. The Redbulls are just on another level. Checo finished 5 seconds behind Max, Alonso finished 20 seconds behind Checo. Who needs wind tunnel time, when your car is destroying everyone anyway?
I watched the race but fell asleep for most of it, now catching up again.
F1 🤝🏼 becoming boring again
Terrible commentary.
Verstappen showing class and racing prowess coming from 9th. Well Done !!!
If only Stroll was a half decent driver, this season could have been more interesting.
Shapin up to be another boring season at the top. Red bull is unstoppable and vestseppn especially is just in another league entirely. To start that far back and so effortlessly take over so quick, just so far beyond the capabilities of the rest of em
carlos sainz cant catch a break this year man. poor guy
I no doubt love f1, but to see the same guys at the top every single time is getting really old and boring to see.
Congratulations Max! Nobody does it better.
Great drive by Max. To come through the field and then keep up the pace on those tyres showed just how much pace he had. 🤘🤘
It not been ham reeb is the 2 year 😢
I would love a Max and Checo rivalry like Nico and Lewis. They should go at it. Checo should give him the best he's got and see where it goes. I don't think anybody is a threat to the Bulls this season.
Clear the red bull's tyre strategy  to benefit max.
Oeps Max did it again
Could you not show some of the other drivers rather than a Max fest ???
Snooze fest.
Dull with the Red Bulls so dominant and Perez under orders  ...
Question, has Verstappen actually been overtaken this season yet? We see all these clips of him overtaking, but has he been overtaken?
Red Bull are too strong
This is unfair, Red Bull winning every race
That red bull is so obscenely fast it's making a mockery of the new car changes.
Well, what do you expect, the redbull cars are over developed, b/c they went over the allowed budget last year.
So next round we can assume another 1-2 Red Bull lol.  Becoming quite boring watching the same 2 cars pull away from everyone else.  Like Watching F2 vs F1.
Impossible to justify the difference between the two red bulls!!! Must be something set inside the team...
since 2010 this sport is dominated by the 2 same teams, you come in this long time this hasn’t changed
La basura de vuelta a su lugar 2°
Red bull looking after max again. Any questioning it, listen to the radio or lack of it for perez
Nice to sleep
Charles can't overtake Kevin most part of race. Its not only Ferrari but their drivers are also becoming disappointing. Sainz overspeed in pit lane, a rookie mistake.
Those stint on the hards by Verstappen is unreal. Checo must really dig deep for this fight  Edit: Imo if the Rb has so much pace over the other team checo should had made a gap on clear air, which in turn give him more gap as verstappen pit or max not catching checo on first stint.
THE WORST SEASON EVER
They changed the Rules to make it more interesting...And now its boring like it was from 2017 to 2020. 2016 was Great cause two Mercedes really fought for the win. Perez never seems to fight for anything
Where is crofty
What’s the point of even watching if you know that 95% of the time, the same car dominates the field
K Mag is always fun to watch!
Maxy fue increible! Eres el mejor piloto, del mundo. Charles me encantaria, volver a verte en el podio pronto. Lestappen por siempre. Saludos desde 🇨🇱
Sergio "Lucky" Perez Fernando "Third place" Alonso Charles "Lefraud" Leclerc Carlos "5 seconds" Sainz George "Princess" Russell Lewis "Exposed" Hamilton
Brilliant drive from Max.
My lord these are up quick
Dumb
This season is so close. Well deserved win Kovalainen. Heidfeld's second place also insane. Alonso still third.... Ou wait..
0:51 Jesus Christ
Max's car still has more power than checo's. It was not only about tires!
Another snooze fest 😴. Such predictable outcomes. These Red Bulls could start anyone on the grid and easily win.
great weekend!!
Not a safety car of any kind --- truly remarkable. It really changes the race dynamic.
That was a great race IMO, kinda surprising. Nothing new in the top 3 of course, but entertaining overall.
unstopable
Bring back crofty please! Like if you agree
Max is levels ahead of everyone in the grid. It's not just the car...
Perez's first stint messed it up for him
Well done Kevin.  Checo.... Come on bro. He started 9th.
Perez has had a shocker today.
how was kmag not driver of the day? he must be in leclerc’s head rent free after todays drive. Amazing
Poor Charles, the car was so slow today. Even with DRS open he was struggling to overtake Magnussen!
Great efforts from LH as expected, his racecraft never dissapoint.
such a joke this year championship
Perez big mouth😂
As close to a perfect race as you can get for Verstappen ;)
Co to za gówno na to się nie da patrzeć
Why are the FIA not making rules so red bull is slower f red bull 😭😭😥😢😰
Highlights of what ?
Right or wrong, this is why Hamilton has no respect for Perez.
Aston need a real no2
We're about to see another 7 time champ cause just like the last 10 year only the car matters so till the next car revamp RB and Max will win every time. It's sad.
Shockingly bad image quality together with another substandard race highlights...somehow you can't get this right
Hamilton from p13 to p6 was great
Lekker bezig Max.
2:15 BEST COMMENT!  Like the F1 game on the PlayStation set to EASY!!!!!🤣
Boooooooooooring
Mexican fans hate to see it 😢🥺 Maxterclass driving😈 Also these commentators sounds like F3🫠😬
its astonishing they made an 8 min highlight real out of this slog
Max
Red Bull only win boring races
at times it seems like RedBull are the only one with DRS on the grid, others dont even care putting up a fight for positions.... F1 is boring right now
Ah another boring season. Nice.
Max got lucky with the hard, which was quicker than the medium in the first half probably because the track was green? Otherwise it would have been Checo for sure.
Max having fastest lap on hard tires when everyone around him is on the medium is insane
Checo saved way too much the tires 😂😂
Checo: gonna be the new Wold Champion  Max: Hold my beer 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Also ferarri is just embarrassing themselves
The Red Bulls are so much better than everyone else that it seems like their only competition is one another.  It might be prudent to start them both from the back just to give the rest of the grid a sporting chance.
Race so boring even Alonso had time to look at the screen
Love him or hate him you have to say well done Max. He is just in a different league these days. Perez didn't let him through, the were genuinely fighting for position.
what race from MAX outstanding
Remember last year when we all thought the new car would mean more competition? 🤣

Max driving today like he wanted to end Checo's career. Absolute savage 🥶
Well done commentator!  Thanks to your nonstop chin. We could not hear engine sound even a little bit.
I’m so happy to be witness of something like this..Max Verstappen and Red Bull are the reason why F1 is more and more back to TOP….
Max is truly unstoppable
Red bull is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo lucky with their car design if not it would've been a close race
Alonso shows that car is not everything. You have to had some talent tho.
So there is no need to watch any of f1 races when red bull is winning every race,so boring.
Double overtake on a hard compound and immensely faster than the other Red Bull. There has to be fowl play here, there simply isn't another explanation.
Mid race
8 minutes of highlights but nothing happened, let's not go back to Miami in 2024. I'm so glad I didn't renew my F1TV Pro subscription, this season is a massive L.
Please explain this to me... King Charles or King Charl? Charles LeClerc or Charl LeClerc? Why can non of the commentators ever get the poor guys name right?
Another Verstappen masterclass. Out of this world. What a drive.
Max is just on another level, gotta admit
It’s just fantastic to see Alonso absolutely enjoying his driving.
Max - the greatest F1 driver in history. It's quite a pleasure to be a fan
Not particularly thrilling to watch when the car is that better than everyone else’s
Fernando Alonso is the only reason  I'm watching f1 now,man keeps on entertaining 💪win coming sooner or later but for sure.. 🔥
Eres grande "Checo"!!Felicidades por el 2o lugar. 🎉
#44 😏
Schumacher, Hamilton, Verstappen. 2 decades. Joke.
a boring race, they should do something like all the cars start with the same type of neomatics to make the race more interesting, today was definitely the most boring race 🥱, I hope they change the rules.
Insane...
KMag was killing it
yawn
I have a proposal, bin all of the current regulations except safety ones. And make F1 like LMH regs. Limit on downforce number, power output, weight etc. And a cost cap. Then it would be actually fun.
Time to get rid of DRS !
i am very thankfull to you guys not spoiling in the headline anymore ! Thank you Formula 1
Please bring back David Croft and Martin Brundle's commentary
I feel like they should bring back the Q2 tire rule given how bad the soft compound seems to be in races. Might add a bit more excitement in the races
Is "Lights out and away we go!" retired?
He really threw on the British accent this race. Not even lights out
The point to the #1 🥶👑
It's not fair fam
New hard tyre  perez can't faster old hard tyre max 😂😂 @20 laps more
Same guy wins every time. Who watches this pretentious garbage?
Boring,predictable, not worth the watch any more.
Masterclass Max! 🫶🇳🇱
Another boring race!
Dude has hard tyres and is still faster than everyone on mediums. GG game guys
People hating on Red Bull bc they have build a great car and are performing in every aspect is such a typical thing for the internet. Y'all should hate on Ferrari and Mercedes for being the bigger teams with the lesser car
Verstappen started 9th lost a place in the beginning, finished first by over 5 seconds who started on pole and set the fastest lap - all on a track where its hard to overtake. Yeah, Max is a different breed compared to Checo.
The can't be 8 minutes long.
Another F1 snooze-fest.
F1 has really destroyed the competition with the new car. I thought it was to make the racing better?
DRS is farcical, F1 is as dull as dishwater, I keep watching it in the hope it’ll provide some excitement but no, week on week it’s a snooze fest.
The superior performance of the Ferrari?  This when the Haas is shutting it down repeatedly.  Eventually the Ferrari did prevail but it shouldn't have taken that long.  Hats off to Magnussen for a great drive.
Just what I needed to help me get off to sleep. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Not to be rude.... I don't enjoy this new commentator (Canadian or American?). He doesn't add much :/
How'd yall find 8 minutes of highlights
The silence is deafening. That dream didn’t last long 😄
Anyone who thinks Perez didn't get team orders is to not beat Verstappen is dreaming. Perez knows he's the backup. We all know he's the 2nd driver.
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Chris J 1 second ago Not fun to watch anymore. No competition anymore just redbull out for a Sunday stroll
What a Snoozefest 😴
i miss "it's light out and away we go"
8 minutes of "highlights"! That's more impressive than the race itself!
What's going on with Max's car?  Like others aren't even driving on the same track.
So glad I watched the BTCC today then this snoozefest!!! Only thing exciting was Alonso in third and the midfield!!!
Great race! Excellent Max verstappen.🇳🇱🇳🇱🏁🆒💯
That's a pretty clear statement to all those people claiming the fight for the championship was on between Checo and Max. I almost felt sorry for Checo.
Checo seems to just give up easily if things are not in his favour. That final gap of 5+ seconds speaks for how competitive Max can be regardless of where he starts from or ends at.
No one talking about Ham performance 🤣
3:05 the Ferrari mechanic
Common Alonso W
There are two things unstoppable right now: Erling Haaland and Max Verstappen!
RedBull played a nice game on Checo to remind him to not get deluded thinking he can lead let alone becoming a World champion
Kevin vs Charles is the highlight of the today
Crofty ?
Boring
This was nowhere near as bad as people claim it was
max  red bull and honda      best in the world
Para todos los mexicanos que decían que Verstapen no le podía ganar en pista, amigo, Max esta a otro nivel, simplemente nació para correr, una bestia, competitivo en todo. No tiene chance ni con el mismo auto el Checo, igualmente es un piloto fantastico. Y va a ser bastante aburrido este año, red bull es un cohete.
Ya da pena ajena ver cómo le roban a un piloto que hace todo perfecto como checo Pérez ya deberían hacer algo aburren con esas carreras donde se beneficia a Max robó verstappen
wow this was such a great race. Honestly the action did not let up through the entire race. Baku was beyond boring and it should really learn from Miami. Baku gives street circuits a bad name and Miami gives street circuits a great reputation.
Just a normal day of Max’s podcast an Austria National Anthem as F1 outro
8 minutes of Highlights Why?
Ferrari won’t win even if you put both Max and Hamilton in their cars  Leclerc is starting to meltdown just like Alonso & Vettel did!!
Taking a break from F1 racing until the cars at the top get more competetive.  Last years' car changes are an unmitgated disaster.  No ifs, ands or buts about it.
This track is just slightly better than Valencia. And we all know how bad that one was.
miami looks dystopian
Future stars Alonso is on another level
With all the rules changing throughout the years to make F1 "more exciting" we got the most boring consecutive seasons in a row.
I fell asleep TBH, but kudos to Max and Checo for 1-2. Alonso amazing as well 🕶🕶
He passed all of them 😂❤
Yawn…
What a bust MacLaren is
Hamilton nao faz nada de diferente? Piloto espetacular faz algo diferente nas adversidades. Entao era somente o carro? It is only the car Hamilton?
In terms of racing this was the best race of the season. Australia had more drama but it was more because of the FIA's actions
Ferrari were shambles. My boi Charles had a rough day at the office
Another boring race... and counting.
Yuki was absolutely cooking today. Wish broadcast showed more of his superb driving.
Jesus another snooze fest.... Uneventful, unfortunately.... The only thing that made things "interesting" was watching Max overtaking everyone in front of him with EASE...   It's sad to see this kind of performance gap in F1. Glad to see Alonso on Podium again.
Carstappen so boring season what a shame !
Boring. You can put Verstappen on 20th place and he would win every race. That is even worse than the years before, Hamilton winning all the time.
The Red Bull is in Formula 1 and the rest is Formula 2...
And the crowd went mild
As dutch person i wonder what de vries is doing in f1. At alpha tauri. Think there are better people in waiting for a seat in f1.
Verstappen may have won but he didn't get to see the chequered flag 😕
Max Verstappen is the best driver to have ever competed in F1. No discussion.
should make the background noise a little higher, its too low and makes the commentary a little boring and lonely. more noise from them cars and engines pls.
get rid of this commentator already he’s not cool unlike Crofty
People in fantasy at this point Fernando 1-4 will get a win at 1 race this season i promise...........also Vmax is a dawg that boy went 40 laps on same tire overtook and beat pace smh all dawg
K-Mag 🐐
Hamilton's great recovery is underrated 🙌
2022 and 2023 have been some of the most boring seasons in the last years.
The fact Verstappen managed to extend the gap from 15.7 seconds to 18.3 seconds on lap 43 with hard tires that were 20 laps older than Checo's shows his absolute talent.  Let's not forget Checo is a truly talented driver as well but what Max showed here today was on another level. To get to second place in 15 laps on harder tires after falling back to tenth. Then to continuously drive fastest laps on much older tires. And on top of that to drive a 1.29 at the 56th lap like its nothing.  Of course they have the fastest car but even compared to his teammate he showed everyone how its done when you make a mistake. Stay calm and keep your pace. Phenomenal.   Big credits to Alonso and Checo as well. They gave it all. Hamilton fought himself back very nicely as well!
Max was consistenly matching Perez's lap-times on 40 lap old tires while Perez was on 15 lap old tires. Insane.
Alonso is GOAT.
It’s like Verstappen is racing with cheat codes…
Can't wait for Mercedes to dominate P1 in the next race!
Max is so impressive fast. Unbelievable
The English reporters! "The performance of that car is outstanding!" At the end of the race Perez! What performance? English reporters and their bias!
These new street circuits are just dreadful. Enough already.
What a car Redbull just made 🏎
Think it’s time for DRS to go
What a stinker of a race.
I really hope alonso will stay in at least 3rd position in championship. He deserves ecery point he got and much more.
Hope Perez wife and kids weren’t watching him embarrass them today 😂
Easy for max
Boooooorrrriiinnnggggg
Boring again, tho I have to question where max's car gets the performance advantage over everyone else? He's certainly not the best/experienced driver out there, so how is his car so much better? 🤔
Alonso pressed the entertainment button on his wheel and saw Stroll's move in Turn 1, Magic Alonso..
🥱😴
When’s is this guy gonna let someone else win. Driver of the day for me is Lewis.
8 min 3 seconds is the exact time I was awake in the race!
The Ferraris are overtaken as easily as if they were Fiat 500s.
That car is wasted on stroll
im not hating on RB but the gap they have against the rest of the grid is too big surely maFIA will have to look into it no doubt closer to the end of the season when CC and WDC are decided
Ferrari delet F1 pls
Magnussen holding off Leclerc's Ferrari for half the race and having qualified 4th....what a madlad
This race really showcased Max's superior driving to Checo's. Thought it might be a boring race but proved to be so far the better Miami GP
Leclerc really had to put up a fight with magnussen. I am gutted.
In order for Red Bull not to win every race this season, we need 10 lap sprint races with RBs starting 19th and 20th. Maybe someone else wins 1 race by the end of the season. Maaaybe.
Enough of this shortening of drs zones. It only makes the races more boring
Red Bull🇦🇹HONDA🇯🇵今季５勝目おめでとう❗️マックス・フェルスタッペン🇳🇱今季３勝目本当におめでとう❗️セルジオ・ペレス🇲🇽２位表彰台おめでとう❗️次戦エミリア・ロマーニャGP🇮🇹も優勝を期待しています❗️ホンダ🇯🇵🗾がんばれ❗️
Most boring race of the year so far.
i've read a few people call Stroll a "driver of the future" or "future champion" but I don't see it. He's never competitive alongside his teammate, so where do they get this?
We though Baku was boring...
Pérez should have won this, he had 15+ laps to pull away.  He's throwing away perfect opportunities.  I'm happy Max won, but Pérez really needs to show that extra step to prove he's worthy of fighting for this all the way to the last race.
Genuine solid performance from hamilton when his whole weekend has looked down he got up love it
👏👏👏👏👏👏
No contest for Super Max.
When are they going to investigate those red bull f1?
It's more about the car than driver's skill to win
🥱
Max is playing on 0 AI
45:second lap 4 how did verstappen go so fast 🏎️
Mercedes very curious about what Aston Martin has done 😂
I don’t know what happened to the old commentators but the current ones are horrible. It’s really difficult to listen to them.
max is fearless..
Croft is so irritating.
Every time Alonso steps on the podium it feels like a race win.
that redbull drs feels illegal lol
🥱It’s getting pretty boring now, it’s not even remotely competitive! You have drivers simply letting Max pass because they know it’s not a fair drive ☠️☠️
Nah, that red bull is a different league, This is lmh vs Lmp3 levels😭😭😭
And with that Max haters keep crying more and more... 😂
Judging by these races i feel even Monaco would be more fun to watch 😂
The presentation before the start of the race was pure class!
Oh boy. Another boring Red Bull wins race.
get rid of this yank commentator
Lewis is unmotivated 😢
Man that was exciting .. 2 hours of pure boredom. F1 has become a Tour de France leg. . Such a snooze fest. Call me when theres anything exciting happening
Mix is on a different level for real.
I really love how all the drive to survive fans are complaining about a borig race. I think it was pretty decent, saw some nice action today.
Hats off to whoever stretched this to 8 minutes
What a boring race, they need to get rid of the Miami Grand Prix or change it. I am Aston Martin fan (not because of Fernando Alonso and was one before he joined the team) so I'm not just angry because my team did bad.
That RedBull is SO INSANELY fast
bring back croft and brundle for the yt channel. why tf did they get rid of em
the commentary is awful
Perez e uma vergonha
Just Bored of F1 Now. To Indycar I go
Somehow managed to squeeze out 8 mins of content huh
Kinda embarrassing for Checo how Max was making the gap bigger with old tyres.
WHOSE THE BIGGER "USED TO BE", CRISTIANO OR SIR LEWI ?
You just simply can not deny the skill max has, also great too see alonso back on the podiums if only vattle held out for another season would have been even better Aston Martin
You just simply can not deny the skill max has, also great too see alonso back on the podiums if only vattle held out for another season would have been even better Aston Martin
Boring
Some delicious humble pie for Checo 😆
leclerc fignting with magnussen is the ultimate highlight of miami
Boring RB dominance tbh. Boring race.
Tsunoda P11  Traditions
Boring
45 laps hard tyres very interesting 😂
I absolutely love Alex jacques Commentary
Hamilton is spent, wasting a seat
Another podium for Fernando i’m sure he will be 3rd in championship
Zzzzzzzz…gooodnight 😴
The guy who squeezed out 8 minutes of highlights from this snoozefest deserves a raise
Formula Red Bull
0:48 Wait that's not Hakkinen vs Schumacher with Zonta in the middle.
Its quite apparent having watched the etire race that RB definitely favour MV. At least Checo knows what radio silence is now.
Ferrari seems to be in great form ................................................  . . . . .  in pit stop
Checo will win a few on street circuits but on a track/hybrid Max will dominate
Alonso the Best wow.
Why is there an American commentator? The accent is annoying.
Max is unstoppable 😮
Flags were pink Flags were blue Another boring race Red Bull 1-2
Max is on his way of becoming one of the GOATs of F1 history. With the car he has I can see him getting 7 World Championships just like Hamilton and Schumacher did.
Everyone excited for the mixed up grid until max showed 2% of his and the red bulls power 🤣
Might as well be a race to 3rd at this point.
Solid race from Lewis. Looks like hems having to work harder than he ever has
People complaining the racing is boring because of the Red Bulls are all Mercedes fans.
This was the first F1 race I got to attend, it was such a fun experience!
What I'd do for a F1 season where more than 1 team had a chance to win the race.
Hamilton is such an excellent wingman for Russell.
Magnificent Max, grande Fernando.
Happy to see checo fighting back,i hope those two will keep fighting till the end since there is no real competition between other manufacturers
Alonso was so bored that he was looking at the race for his pants.
Brawo Max 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  I tak trzymaj do końca sezonu
this was actually quite  a nice race with a decent amount of overtakes
This race would have been even more exciting if the course was still flooded like last week.
Shocking! Every faster one ended up in front of the next slower one?
Pls bring crofty commentary for the race hl again
Max on 🔥🔥🔥🔥
it is hard to be a mclaren fan these days 😢
The most unenthusiastic commentary ever… the racing is already boring, at least try and make it sound somewhat exciting!
Que aburrida que esta la fórmula 1, siempre gana el mismo, solo Red Bull tiene un buen auto, los demás tienen autos regulares que les hace imposible competir contra ellos, no importa si parten desde el último lugar, en cuestión de un par de vueltas ya están en primero y segundo lugar.
Max is a beast.
Fantastic drive from Kmag but a shame he got a poor start. He deserved more than a 10th place after that drive keeping the Ferrari at bay for so long.
I hate the new commentator bro ,we want the old one back ,I stopped watching f1 because of the new commentator
Tenía que ganar checooooooooo 😭
Dull race... No atmosphere in Miami, just like Baku.
result did not disappoint
Noia
Thank you for not saying it’s lights out and away we go
The commentators are terribly wrong...
F1 needs to nerf verstappen
Zzz
There is levels to this sport  Max stands on his own in that regard
Maxxxxxx
Perez needs everyone help to win
Max Verstappen showed who the King is 👑
I miss Murray!  What a waste of a race weekend, so many better circuits in US that could be used.
No DNFs today!
14 years .....2 teams......well done.....I am thrilled.....
What Highlights?
2 Things That Don't Surprise Me 1: Verstappen Winning 2: Alonso 3rd
Super Max!
Boring.
38 laps to get by Kmag, great for Hass and Kmag, but appalling for Ferrari.
SUPER MAXXXXXX🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
Max just schooled Sergio. The natural order has been regained.
Another boring Verstappen drive
0 dnf 🧐
I think I need crofty and I also deserve him
How they managed to make 8 minutes out of these highlights is beyond me
First
..... well that is what I get for being a Ferrari fan...
F1 since 2014- not counting 2016 and 2021 went downhill. There is no battles for championship. No other winners. Just same person
Rember when there used to be a driver in F1 called Lewis Hamilton?
kmag vs leclerc was the most interesting part
Red bull should be copied by the whole grid 😡😡😡😡😡😡
Verstappen drove 45 laps on hard compound that’s insane
The people responsible for getting these highlights out this quickly deserve a raise!
Fernando oh Fernando what could have been if your teams you had werent giving you a bad car,great to see him still going strong,great race from Max,also Barrichello 2.0 showing why he never was a nr1 driver.
You Gave Me Nightmares Max! 👎😡👎
Why the f*** does crofty not commentate the YouTube highlights anymore
This is a challenge:  How many doozefests in a row can we get?
proud of kmag. he did a great job
lets go mercedes
Max on a 45-lap stint with hards 🤯
Please bring back Martin and Crofty commentary. No offense to the F1 network crew but it's not even close.
Max raced his demons there
I miss "Lights Out And Away We Go.."
Why...just Why any of the others bother...turning up 🤦🤔
Whoever stretched this highlight to 8 minutes deserves a raise.
what is this buffalo voice commentator which herd did they bring him from
Press 1 to skip this season. Just give Verstappen the trophy already
Yup this will be my last f1 race watching this season cheers yall
Charles had probably the worst weekend of his career since Shanghai 2018
Boring... a super boring race.
Vetted with alonso would be dope
Kinda overshadowed but, Yuki from p17 to p11! really consistent with only p10 or p11 finishes
Miami highlights: Verstappen vs gp2 engines
Another podium for Godlonso!
Hamilton and Max are the drivers of the day, it was expected from Max, but was not expected from Hamilton who drove that tractor brilliantly.
Champ Alonso❤
Max has shown his class today and that he is on a different level compared to Checo.  A real champion's drive from Super Max.
Perez has no excuse
Mercedes.ordinary team now!!!
I feel like Alonso is carrying entertainment this season
What another exciting week of Red Bull's fighter jets providing a very competitive and close race
Congrats Red Bull for Constructors Championship. Such Boring 😠😤
Verstappen🔥
Tsunoda's results so far  p11 p11 p10 p10 p11
This was absolutely dominant by max. I don’t see Perez having this kind of performances.
congrats to max for his 2023 title, perez is too slow this race proves it
Perez is a KWAB
2:20 "The F1 game on the PlayStation." How many F1 racing video games are on the PlayStation? Have the commentators played F1 on PlayStation before?
What a boring race. What's the point of anyone else even trying?
Why did F1 youtube stop using the Sky Sports commentary for the highlights?
TAYLOR SWIFT
Rb car is a cheat. But i wonder why fia is not looking in it. Maybe the fix is in
Ferrari are red Williams are blue Watch out people Verstappens past you
F1 is boring now. Ridiculous
Pirelli need to sort out the tyres. These one stop races aren’t helping at all. Some strategy could probably make better races
Perez wants to be champ but unfortunately he's a mediocre driver
They really found 8 minutes of Highlights, that's the most surprising thing that happened today
Notice how Max left Checo room to drive even when overtaking? George Russell take note.
I feel that Verstappen and Perez would pull a Spain 2016 or Baku  2018 later this season, just sayin’
Magnussen toying with Leclerc made this race tolerable- from a McLaren fan
Big REDBULL giving the worst strategy to the first in the game
Great race, congratulations to Max and Checo
Happy with Hamilton in 6th not too bad a performance. Plus George in 4th is nice. Can't believe Alonso made the podium again. 😅
Corrida sólida do patrão
I liked that double overtake on Leclerc and Magnussen from Max, what a phenomenal pace he had on the hards
Yesterday, Christian Horner bought a SpaceX engine and put it in Max's RBR, I saw it..
One of the most boring races I’ve ever seen
Max Verstappen was amazing today
Its not easy being a Ferrari fan 🥺
simply limit this DRS trash to 3x per race and give those in front a reason to defend. it is so boring. almost zero racing.
Whoever turned that absolute snooze-fest into 8 whole minutes of “highlights” needs a pay rise 😂
Max can start from pit lane and he will win again
Checo is a fraud and nowhere near max level. Give that seat to someone else!
Papa Nando showed the class again 💪
Fernando great as always! Hopefully someone can catch Red Bull this season...they seem unbeatable.
Yes F1 is getting better than before... Less excitement
Could have started Max in Baku and he still would have won.
1. Max 2. Checo 3. Alonso  S - stability
Magnussen exposing Leclerc for half the race, Hamilton’s comeback on the mediums, and Max dominating Checo from p9. Fun race. Way better than Baku last week.
What a drive!!!  What a car, what a team and what an exceptional talented race driver.  Amazing Max 👏 🏎️🏁🇳🇱💯
Sergio robbed of a victory. Team didn’t talk to him all race but had constant communication with Max. Even the commentators recognized the discrepancy.
what 👏a 👏 boring 👏 gp   and before any DTS kid comes to say anything, yes, I am a redbull fan, but it doesn't have to do anything with the boring gp that just happened
How is it posssible to get 8 minutes highlights out of this race

Shoutout to the intern for the quick upload
Is Perez slowly becoming second fiddle?
I'm starting to hate DRS
0:51 1:04 1:29 2:14 2:34 3:55 5:57
Rebull is ruining this sport and costing F1 a lot of money none of these races have been remotely interesting
Quite surprised to see that many overtakes I'm definitely not complaining though, this race was epic
Absolute masterclass from Danny Ric by not driving this season to avoid the cringe fest of the driver's introduction.
Not even a single yellow flag is the most impressive thing about this race
RB shouldn’t even bother qualifying. It makes Zero difference where they qualify.. this is insane.
Other Boring race, red bull and Pirelli 😴😴😴
I just want Crofty back
How is this video 8 minutes long??😮
Drive to survivers out in force to call the race boring
This video should have been 3 min tops. I don't like to complain about races, but this one was boring AF.
Another F1 snooze fest. If F1 really is the pinnacle of motorsport, why do I see more overtakes on my morning commute than a 2 hour race?
I think the season is over. Doubt Perez can do something about it.
F1 2023 in a nutshell: verperalo
max is unstoppable 🤯
Not a verstappen fan but credit where it's due, he killed it this race.
Another boring race. Predictable outcome.
No one forgot how Checo's fastest lap in quali yesterday was slower than maxes in q2.. or did some people have hopes? there's no way right? Vamos for number 2 in championship
Let's have a moment of silence for all the Checo fans who thought Max and Checo are equal 🌹🤡  ￼
Phenomenal race by Max!
Rediculous DRS performance from the Red Bull.
Alonso looking on the big screen to see Lance’s overtake while racing is the most Alonso thing ever
Verstappen is on difficulty 20 on F1 2023
Props to George russell, since no one else gives him props. 👏.
Red Bull will win every race this season
I dont like these commentators. Bring back the skysports commentators please.
Masterclass by Max. Solid drive by Alonso. Great comeback from Hamilton. These 3 are truly something different. Leclerc is just not at their level.
Welp, at least qualifying was fun for the weekend 🥴
💤💤💤💤
When I clicked this video I was the 499th person watching, before I opened the video I was the 1,999th person  F1, the speed resonates even on YouTube.
Boring race RB needs to stop winning every race
Where crofty
The Miami GP was on??? Been asleep since Baku
From P9 to finishing P1 5 seconds ahead. That should shut all Perez fanboys up
This is starting to be so boring. The difference bewtween Red Bull and the others is abysmal.
We need to admit that these reg changes have been a disaster
The fact this is probably the best race this year is shocking 😭
The results I expected 😊
Incredibly dull, amazed you got anything from this.
Erling Vertsappen, hes not human,  what a mockery he made of the whole grid...
Max verstappen gênio ❤
Driver of the day is definitely the man who managed to make 8min of highlights. And Max Verstappen of course
Underrated drive from Lewis. Maximised the car fully to finish P6
Okay but why was this race so boring
Alonso getting so bored over there he gains more interest in his teammate's race. Give that man a challenge already
What a snooze Fest
George and Hamilton have done seriously well considering how **** their car is
They need a new commentator
'I am inevitable.' -t. Max Verstappen
I'm bored of the season already
F1 gotta have a whole department for stretching the highlights.
"Who needs competition when you have two Red Bulls battling it out for first place?"
I fell asleep during the worst part! So it wasn’t too bad. 👍
VER,PER,ALO is the new HAM,BOT,VER.
First
Max and checo definitely fighting it out for the rest of the reason
max overtaking drivers faster than me leaving questions in examination
Finally!
In my opinion this was the most boring race since the new era of cars
life changed
these races have been boring recently! only fights at the front are within the red bull team!
I quit F1 for endurance and Indycar
Incredible dominance by both the red bull cars and max verstappen. Incredible
Kmag vs Leclerc was some of the most entertaining racing I've seen all season. If only the Redbulls werent in a league of their own, this season would be such a thriller!
Was there ever a doupt ?🔥🦁🦁
Faast
"Kudos to Kevin Magnussen for a brilliant drive, and hats off to both Alpine racers for their impressive performances."
