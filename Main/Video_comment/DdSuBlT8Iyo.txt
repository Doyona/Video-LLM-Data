NOTIFICATION SQUAD: Where would you like to see us walk across in a day next? LET us know below! It's great to get back to Youtube having spent the last few weeks hidden away in a room, wrapping up the Abroad in Japan book. Expect to hear more details soon, but for now enjoy the video! And cheers to Pete for coming along for the ride.
To me, the station looks inspired by Amsterdam's train station. Wonder if it actually is, considering they have several buildings inspired by our architecture and even some copies haha
GiGO is still Sega, just underwent a poorly-received rebrand.
17:28 6 7 🗣️
Pete and Natsuki are by far my favourite guests on your show. They are always so upbeat and positive ❤.
I can totally understand why Pete loves just walking among the bland office buildings. Walkable cities are few and far between in America and it's been shown to actually be better for people's mental health and sense of community.
This is just called "missing the last train" as far as I'm concerned...
Pete is amazing vibes
19:34 I recognise this place from ghostwire Tokyo lol. I feel so lame haha. It’s a good game though!
20:44 That. Is the cutest face I've ever seen Pete pull.
Thats bear claw is a back scratchers.
Idk but this guy does not have  respect for the Japanese culture.
25:00 was hilarious
24:32 At a certain age, I realized that backscratchers are pretty awesome. I have multiple retractable ones like that bear claw in the car, office, etc.
That was so wholesome 8:08
The extendable bear hand is a back scratcher. I bought one in Japan and use it frequently
"Extendable bear hand?!?!?"  My dude, those are backscratchers and they are awesome!  🤣
Hilarious they didn't realize the extendable bear claw was a back scratcher.
8:44  I really the saying in the T-shirt 😅 "I am not strong at boose, but I like it😅"(Sake wa yowai ga daisuki❤) How about the Ska-jan for your trip? (Ska-jan started to produce for soldiers in Yokosuka Navy Port of the United States, ("Ska" for The city "Yokosuka", "jan" is for "jumper") When you visit Akihaba again, (if you haven't enjoyed) why not go to "Maid Kissa" Special beautiful Maid will be waiting to serve you🥰
Unfortunately the chicken eating zone was demolished and there’s signs everywhere saying you cat eat anywhere. 04/22/25
20:50 I love that shot so much. I’m not even mad it’s reused so many times in this video. Hopefully I’ll get to capture that angle some day
1:36 to whoever is going to senso-ji, go at sunset. The shops are closed but the art on their metal shutters are so cool. Not a lot of people are there and when you make it to the shrine it's all lit up and you can still pray and buy the fortune if you wanted. I have amazing pictures from there.
The section between Roppongi and Shibuya being boring is perfect. I would walk from Roppongi to revisit the place I lived at in Azabu-Juban. Then walk past the National Azabu supermarket to Hiro-o and to Ebisu from there. Then walk to Shibuya after that. Makes for a way nicer walk :) Personal preference of course.   Best tip in any case is to walk through parts of Tokyo as much as you can. It’s such a cool city to explore on foot!
On Tokyo Station, "5000 commuters passing through every day."  I dunno Mr. Abroad, I think you might be underselling that a bit. 😂
wow being called mr mime would definitely leave scars
Please do a vlog on how safe it is to walk in Tokyo … or any security issues on going around the city
That’s how you gonna get to know a new place — by walking 🎉
"Let the addiction begin."
After everything they ate, I can't understand how in T.F. they could possibly eat a pizza at the end!
4000 trains daily and 5000 commuters daily? Those numbers dont seem right....
The manji in the incense burner caught me off guard 3:00
24:29 it’s a back scratcher
Don;t want to spoil it, but according to google maps, inputting all the stops you made along the way, it is about 15,5 kilometers from Asakusa to Shibuya....
FYI: @ 23:49 .....I have an extendable ZOMBIE HAND... aka a backscratcher... so... me, yo... I'd enjoy an "Extendable bear hand"  for sure!
You could hatch so many eggs doing this with Pokemon go
Extendable Bear Hand is actually a great Ball scratcher. Yes im speaking from experience
Anyone know the name of the Shimbashi street shown in that atmospheric night shot with the train going overhead in the background? Asking for a friend 😂
One of my favorite Abroad in Japan vids
Super Potatoe. Why the hell are you two suddenly wearing face diapers?
i got lost under tokyo station after not sleeping on my flight. sleep deprived and overwhelmed just trying to find the surface was possibly the scariest thing ever
Extended bear claw? that's just a back scratcher, people don't buy them cus they're bored lol
Pete, I believe you should have left your backpack at home so soon after a surgery. You know Chris is a total arse.
Anyone know the song at 26:50?
Why do you look like Malcom in the Middle on you Thumbnail?
i wish i could do this.maybe nextym we visit tokyo.i think walking is worth the time.instead of transferring train which also involves almost the same number of walking steps.
Heh, I bought one of those extendable bear hands at a pharmacy so I could scratch my back at work.
I’m planning a trip to Japan. Would love to do this walk can I get the map?
Sure hope Pete is good natured. You are not that nice . Good luck Pete after just having surgery
Get in the Gaming Oasis, Shinji!
I scratched my back with the extension bear hand while watching this, yes I bought one.
Only like 7 seconds into the video and I had to the convert km to miles.
“I can barely string together a sentence” *strings together a Charles Dickens-level sentence*
Do they know the extendable bear claw is a back scratcher?
I have 3 of those bear claws, they are back scratchers
such a shame about the nakagin capsule tower, it would be nice if they built something that resembled it, to pay homage somehow. <3
They’ve never seen a backscratcher before??
Chris is a great actor, because everything he does seems genuine. Pete on the other hand is an obvious actor.
Time to pick up from where I left off.
I walked across Madrid, specifically from one tip to the other of the Metro line 10. I didn't stop at anything except traffic lights and drinking my water and some snacks. 36.5 km.
I was wondering why they were calling that back scratcher "extendable bear hand" but thats exactly what it says on the box lmao. no mention of back scratching capabilities
8:09 oh my god lol thats not only the cutest thing I've seen in awhile, but the coolest thing i've seen too lmao
The extendable bear hand is actually a back scratcher so that you can scratch your itchy back or any part of your body yourself (unreachable by your hand), without the need to ask someone to help. 😅
Such an amazing video! Thank you for showing us such amazing sights and good looking corners around Tokyo!!!
I want to go ti Japan, but i have not Money, pipipipipi.
@sorathetroll was here  29:05, stream
I once missed the last train from roppongi so we did a night walk from roppongi to our hotel in Taito city over 15 KM. you did even more so I'm impressed.
Was just recently in Japan and visited Ishibashiinari shrine! It was one of my favorites I visited in Tokyo.
Man pete is so funny
Loving your videos. I have been to Japan twice before and am planning a trip with some good mates in October. This and your Yamanote line video are reminding me of so many sights I loved in Japan.
There are more walking trails in Tokyo. I used to do them when I lived there. Thank you for the video. So much has changed since I lived there more than 14yrs ago.
Just saw game and watch in Super Potato. Nostalgia!
So I live in rural Maine and recently had to buy a birthday gift for a 9-year-old boy - my two grandkids picked out that EXACT EXTENDABLE BEAR HAND back-scratcher as one of the gifts. There is a customer for anything, right? (Coming to Japan in 2025!)
was watching again , then you want to eat . "taiwan flat fried chicken ' . , did a rewind :-)   My go to place in Taipei NTD 99 , might finish before I got to my hotel :-)   Nice slab of crispy chicken , I went for extra spicey .
Im an American, I literally live in LA but after listening to Chris and his accent so often, hearing another American on this channel was uncomfortable for my ears
Tokymino
Can I be your guys friend's please?
how to blow casino, wow  just wow lol
SEGA was gone... Love Live was also gone and replaced by Genshin
26:07 Iki (apologies for spelling) Has the most London accent and mannerisms possible! 😂😂
22:18 sam sulek???
damn tokyo station almost feels dutch
12:52 the noise scared me
BOSSジャンパー
the duo we never knew we needed
Finally making my way to Japan. Thanks for all you have shared over the years. all that time I've spent watching your channel is finally paying off 😂
Am I correct in thinking Pete has been on the NHK TV show Cool Japan?
NICE ! power overwhelming ! ha go pete
I just watched your convenient store video, I actually woke me up because I though somebody was rapping. Then I thought it was a bit. So I watched it over and realized it wasn’t. Then I watched another video of you climbing Mount Fuji and realized it again that you sound so poetic when you speak! You make all of your sentences rhyme and structure like a poem. Is that intentional?
Tokyo, the city that never sleeps. Been there 😍
“You bought your lame sh- I’m buying video games” he is literally me.
any muslims here,  which can tell me if there is helal food at those common spots?
19:48 "Philippine Night Pub" I didn't knew that exists but in Japan especially in that area it's not out of the extraordinary.
Just got back from my first trip to Japan and I went to try the areas in the video and nothing disappointed. Definitely loved the big chicken in Asakusa and can’t wait to go back again and learn of other places to visit in future videos.
Did this like 6 times , with variations, just because I wanted to explore the city.
Yesterday, thanks to this video, I got to enjoy Marishiten Tokudaiji Temple and Yakatori whiskey bar. I have walked past that temple twice failing to look up.
"squeeze on my little gorrila sack"....im in bits.....
25Km? 30,000 Steps and only 1500 calories? I feel so guilty watching this, Overweight, bloated, at work on my computer in the middle of the Night. Man I need to get out more!
OMG!! You two are a blast!!  I couldn’t stop laughing! 🤣 Totally enjoyed this video to the max!!  Thanks a bunch for making this absolute brilliant video with full of great information! We’d be in Japan in less than 4 weeks and counting! Staying in Asakusa for the first 4 days. We might do the walk you two just did!  I’m so excited! Thanks a  million for this super fun video!!❤
its so chill to watch those videos
Extendable bear hand was worth whole trip.
awesome❤
My favourite one of those wish tablet things I've seen at a shrine was someone who just drew a logo for Half Life 3 xD
12:40 is word for word why I want to live in japan
Love the dynamic between you guys. You seem to feed off each other. Love it.
Fun episode but why say not scripted and then do that completely scripted “hey Pete I know a great little taco restaurant” bit
Eiffel Tower old world, Tokyo Tower new world  Equal beauty
Does anyone know if they ever made it to Mordor?
This sounds like a cool activity when in japan, if you have plenty of time
Pete's great. That looked like an awesome day
The walk from Ueno to Akihabara is an interesting and enjoyable one. At night (early evening in Dec) it has fantastic colours for photography. Just before Akihabara there is Aki-Oka Artisan market. Got a beautiful handmade Inarii mask gachapon there.
The next step would be to hike across the whole metropolitan area.
Not bad! Last October I had enough time left before a planned teamLab visit to walk from Akihabara to Toyosu in about 2 hours. It gives a basic idea about how big Tokyo actually is
Is this the first ever advert in one of these videos?  Still great Video, love the quick overview of all the regions.
New challenge.  Get drunk on sake kit-kats.
Ima make that walk
1983!!! I'm totally with you!
is that $450 yen? for a cheep squisshy ggoglie eye junk? C'mon Man!
The extendable hand at 24:23 is a back scratcher. Kind of like the shower brush to wash your back.
This was fun. I actually like Chris's videos with Pete more  than those with his Japanese buddies. Just an IMHO...
Thank you enjoy the video
37 Mil live in Tokyo, 36 Mil live in All of Canada. lol
1983 baby too 🎉
extendable bear claw seems like a good weapon. Crazy pete at it again, classic
Crazy how Chris scripted the pigeon to harass them in Asakusa
Man Sensoji is lovely. I went there with my ex girlfriend last year for NYE. We were piss drunk when we prayed at like 3am
You know, I've done this walk before but in two parts. I live in Shinjuku and occasionally walk up towards Asakusa and rarely to Shibuya. I don't have much time to do it all in one go but it's such a fun walk.
I’ve really come to like Pete, he’s funny & just such an interesting character lol
Pete is the dude!
I want pete's vest. I fucking love craft boss !!
Seeing what became of the SEGA building must give the same feeling as seeing what became of the original Nickelodeon Studios building
worry about stepping on birds, while munching down on one. There's a degree of cognitive dissonance going on here.
"24 seasons of One Piece" False. Anime has no seasons. It's something for the stupid westerners to understand. It has episodes, it has arcs. There are no reasons. Stop being wrong.
I legit have this bear claw scratcher, it works really well if you don't have long nails and extendable arms 24.24
I enjoyed walking the Yamanote Line over the course of several trips to Tokyo. You could probably do the whole thing in a day if you really hoofed it, but I enjoyed just taking my time and absorbing the various districts and neighborhoods I found myself in. Each station really does have its own unique vibe.  My favorite segment was probably between Nippori and Uguisudani stations, where I spent some time getting lost in a giant, maze-like cemetery.
You should be able to make that walk in 5-6 hours. You’re stopping too much. Next time run when the camera is off 🤣
why is pete always high
i would want chris and pete to make a new video where they do the same thing take a walk around tokyo, finding diffrent places and stores :) they should make a series chris and pete´s walk around japan series :D
Pete’s cool he’s just happy to be alive
DID HE SAY "WERE IN ARASAKA??"
what the fuck is this videogame during this movie?
The extendable Bear Claw looks like a back scratcher.
Hi Chris, I've been meaning to thank you for your hard work and content. My wife and I finally went to Japan on our year long planned honeymoon, of which we've always wanted to visit, and your videos made it more easier for us to decide on what to explore. 17 long walking days through Tokyo, Mishima, Hakone, Kyoto, Osaka and Nara, from where we will always cherish our memories from our experiences and the hospitality of the people... Needless to say, we are already saving up for our next trip back!  Anyway, heres a place I dont think you have been to yet and may be of interest: Mishima Sky Walk, towards the Lake Ashi in Hakone.  Cheers!
Chris, this was your most helpful video ever. I recreated this walk (using trains to save my legs), and it was an amazing was to see tokyo in just one day.
??? I thought you hated his guts?
More Pete please
pete has such a good smile
This video is the first video I watched after I turned 53 years old.  Today is my birthday.  My birthday is 10-12-70.  Chris, I always like watching your videos.  I wish I had money and a US Passport for me to visit Japan.  You have been awesome.
"stop scaring the locals, what the fuck" -Chris Broad
tax reasons " HIS mney"
❤️👌⛩️
both of funney guys enjoying everywhere u going.
Come for the walk, stay for the failed attempt to sip a pint at the end.
I plan to repeat this when I go in November!
This video gets a like for Mr. Mime.
Chris has prime "Dad saying you can't get a second toy at the tourist trap" vibes.
The "extendable bear hand" is a back scratcher
Guys if you've ever watched Connors streams/VODs with Chris you would know its in the moment. Often they have places to go planned and a general idea of what theyre doing in place, but once there whatever happens happens, its just Chris' great voiceover work and editing that makes it seem very structured.   Amazing videos as always Chris, keep it up my guy we all notice the amazing effort you put in ❤
I really enjoyed this.
Amazing video. Great chemistry between you and Pete. Some lovely cinematography and the production was on-point. This  is a return to form Chris. Keep it up! Japan ftw!⛩
日本のビルは耐震性が強くないといけないからね
30:40 okay.... that location has my favorite english beer Hobgoblin!
Not to expensive? That's around 8,000 yen for two bowls of ramen. That is utterly insane compared to what you get in Japan.
26:00 most british person I've seen
With how much fried chicken you eat, you're basically an American my friend. Welcome to the land of the free!
For those who want to do this without the boring part between Roppongi and Shibuya, you can skip Tokyo Tower and Roppongi, and take a nicer walk from Tokyo Station via the Imperial Palace, Akasaka and Omotesando/Harajuku.   Really loved the video :)
13:52 bro funny as hell
GiGO? I gotta go
13:52 Pete going off on Chris about his “stupid shit”. Love it
I like how the guy who likes Pete's Jacket at 26"40-odd is possibly the most British sounding person ever!
The sake kitkats have been around for awhile. A great gift from Japan - I wish I bought more. 😂 They truly taste like sake. The first time I purchased them was from a Don Quijote (Donki) in 2018.
Excellent video, we are very lucky to have you making such quality productions.
I HAVE BEEN THERE. IT WAS SOOO COOL
I will never understand how the bloody hell US became Japans best friend in the world after fucking nuking it????????? They should be mortal enemies!
How did i not know about pete? Hes so fun to watch! 🥰
あなたの一日はどうでした？
1983 here
I don't know why a 6 month old video was recommended to me suddenly, but it was fun going on adventure with you both.  I was in japan for the first time a year ago.  I miss it so much.  I want to come back and stay there!
I love the mister mimes randomly through out
Walk across Tokyo?  After two beers and whiskey...  How could you walk anywhere?
13:24 can anyone translate that sign for me?
After much consideration, I think I am the female equivalent of Pete. I'm even a fan of Mr Mime. What am I doing with my life
Board squad!
9:18 it's a mega pint
m8... we did the same walk across 3 days, haha. Never in our lives have we walked so much. But we explored all of Tokyo this last time we visited. Loved it.
And my coworkers thought I overdid it in 28,000 steps in one day...
This video didn't make sense to me until I moved to Tokyo 4 months ago!
You know you are watching too much Abroad in Japan if you already recognize Risottoro from behind  (takes sneaked in from 1:45)
1:59 what the hecc is happening there? Is a guy lunging at someone?
I can see a future where humans can only go on holiday, no longer all at once. Prob do it by name sake. love the video.
@16:50 5000 commuters a day on 4000 trains? I'm assuming he meant 5 Million. I've never been really captivated by Tokyo, but this does make me want to go have a walk before I take the Shinkansen to go get some Aomori Ringo.
ALRIGHT! I waited 5 months so I could have a back log of videos. Almost can't believe how many video's you got out, i've been keeping up with the other channels. But time for the main coarse!
Not scripted but pretty over exaggerating lol
This mf pete look like Neds Declassified
Pete is such fun !!! More Pete with you. I can’t wait to visit next year 🤞🏾
Anyone else think it was frustrating how they didn't pick the trash up at the end?
I like Pete, he seems like a really nice, genuine, humble, funny guy
This is actually a really fun challenge!
in like 3 years when im a bigger streamer imma do a charity cycling thing (definitely original and not stolen from you or connor mhm 10000%) but im gonna go to every tourist place in tokyo and adventure around each place in the span of 7 days what personally i think is a good idea :)
ご自身の国を紹介なさらないのですか。
"4000 trains arriving and departing daily and 5000 comuters passing through every single day."  Must have some very empty trains...
first time i'ce seen shibuya hogoblin that packed ^^
Hi chris. Would just like to say keep up the good work with your videos. I think your videos are half the inspiration to visit japan. Today is my first day in japan. Time to explore tokyo. Im thinking doing your walk would be a good first day. Thxfor the inspiration
At 6:11. Hmmm...where is 金龍山? (Golden dragon mountain.) Also 雷門, what a mighty name for an entrance!  "Thunder gate," ahoy!
My one and only time in Japan, I hadn't learned any Chinese. Nada, zilch, zip. Now that I have some Chinese under my belt, it's exciting to see all these signs in Japanese kanji. I can read some of them!  Including the sign behind Chris at 4:18. "Taiwan Chinatown something, something" right behind Chris's head, with "fried chicken" written above.
I don't think you realize how many people would watch you walk 8+ hours across Tokyo. No commentary needed.
"Abundance of..." :,D You are so *ready* for Japan Today documenting.
a really nice video guys,  i felt like i was there haha
Traveling to Japan with my son in October for the first time. One of the best videos I’ve seen. 👌👌AND, booked hotel  in Ueno.   I considered getting a tour guide for a day but….after this, I think I would rather spend that money ($300 ish for 6 hours🙄🙃), elsewhere.   Point is, this video makes me realize that one doesn’t actually **need** a tour guide, right?    If I have my google maps, translator apps, cash, (or suica card) etc, I would be fine.   I would love your thoughts on this. Anyone reading this, please. THANK YOU! 😊🙏
2:00 the girl on the right is the main character
AWESOME MUCH RESPECT AND RESPECT TO SNK KOF KYO KUSANAGI TERRY BOGARD.   YOUR SHOW AWESOME AND I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS.  WHERE THE LADYS🗺🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌
I did almost the same thing when I was in Japan in March! I went from Ryogkoku to Akihabara, Asakusa, Tokyo Station, Minato-ku and then ended up at the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of modern arts hahaha I loved walking 20km daily in Tokyo, you can get most of your travel on foot!
Amsterdam Central Station
This makes me think of Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne :D I know, it seems to make no sense, but a large portion of the game takes place around here and that's where I've heard the name of many of these locations first.
testing 234 comment 233
It is a very nice video.
it is a very nice video.!!!
why do you pronounce akihabara like that?
I own that exact extendable bear hand. Best back scratcher ever.
Pete is so entertaining, I could watch him all day. His enthusiasm is brilliant.
I spent a lazy Sunday walking about 30kms around Tokyo a few years back and it is still one of my fondest memories. I had only one set objective but everything else was flexible and it was really a wonderful experience. All inspired by the opening line from "Doesn’t Remind Me" by Audioslave. It was really fun to watch your experiences doing it (with far more local knowledge than I have) and see just how different the experience was but the occasional similarity as well.
Luv Pete always so ernergetic and entertsining. Good choice,CB.
God I'm like 10 years younger than Pete...  94. At that moment I for the first time felt young in my late 20s
The extendable bear claw is a back scratcher :D
dont like japanese
20:30 Where can I get this Coffee Boss jacket?!
Why if it’s Akihabara it’s always Potato or Mandarake. My advice don’t go in this tourist traps. Try to find little shops it’s way cheaper.
Pete is friggin awesome!!
Imagine going to college to learn how many fucking bricks they laid in the making of a building 💀💀
Geese Howard..... Double Repuken!!!
umm... a lot of us have run the entire yamanote line in one day... 25km isn't really that much.
Ueno, Asakusa, Shimbashi. Nice! Aside from Shinjuku 2-chome you almost nailed your Unintentional Tokyo Gay Bar District Combo Trip there.
First of all, thank you for saying Asak’sa and not AsakUsa!:))))
Pete is so cute with how positive he is, like a puppy
I would love to see this worldwide. Walking across London, Paris, Sydney, Petoria, Copenhagen etc
I think the bear hand is supposed to be a back scratcher 😂 Honestly I’m kinda surprised Pete didn’t recognize them, I feel like I see those in every souvenir shop in America
Up video. Thanks!
I love how after 10 years in Japan. Chris still uses English pronunciations for all the names of locations he goes too.
A long time ago someone told me it takes a month to fully explore Tokyo, and at least a year to properly explore the rest of Japan. I need to either win the lottery or come up with a mobile money making scheme
Walking across Tokyo and you showed your ugly faces in the camera most of the time. Disgusting.
Those back scratchers are very handy
My stupid brain thought he’s walking across Japan in a single day.  Obviously not but it could be interesting to see him walk across Japan at its narrowest point and see how long it takes him
that bear claw is for you to scratch your back with😅
At least the GiGO arcade is Namco now, from what I've heard. That's a proper Japanese gaming name.
goofsadqwu
Have you done a video of Korea Town in Tokyo?
butt scratcher....
extendable bear hand is a back scratcher
The extendable bear claw is actually the most useful thing you guys purchased. It is for scratching your back in places you can't reach.
Those extendable bear claws are actually back scratchers. Fun video.
that bear claw is a back scratcher XD
15 miles? Between work and life without a car I easily do that in a day in Philadelphia
There's no way Chris and I are the same age. How has he got his life together? Do I need to start teaching in a place I don't speak the language of so I can find my calling in life too? Teach me, Senpai
めっちゃ面白いし東京散歩するときの参考になる
props to these two for making this video way more fun than it should have been
Man has a Boss Coffee jacket, I need that.
Great video Chris, you guys know the Bear paw is a back scratcher right?
I hitch hiked a very desolate highway, a truck driver picked me up and said I was a little over 40km from where I left. I seen a wolf and ran a bit as it was getting dark. It took me 6 or 7 hours.
I wouldn't have minded seeing the boring places too
the extendable bear hand is a back scratcher
YO WE LOVE PETE!  WE NEED MORE PETE ❤❤❤
Common Pete W
I had been to Japan in December 2019, and I remember buying those kit kats and taking them home, they were a fun little treat, before the fire nation attacked
If you are from The Philippines, Gigo kinda sounds Gago HAHAHAHA
The StarCraft reference made me nostalgic af!
damn.. I visited Japan many years ago and stayed at a hotel new Ueno street.  It just felt like I was in an anime episode.  I remember the SEGA building and Ropongi good times.  This time I'm visiting Osaka and I hope it's a good visit as well.
chris couldve have 2 backpack and split the weight but he decided to let pete carry everything lol what the..
Thats a chicken milanesa if I ever seen one
These houses are amazing, id be interested to see what types of Akiya may be locally avaliable though where it would be more upfront to renovate but hopefully much less on the monthly expenses, although im sure those Tokyo taxes add up 😂
This is a great idea for a video and for a way to take in a lot of Tokyo in an interesting way - though maybe it would be best to split the 15 mile journey up across a few days.
pete's energy is so infectious, you found yourself a lot of great travel buddies!
I’m an ‘83 baby, it was a great year for sure! 😂❤
13:46 freaking gold lol
This is going to sound weird, but I’m going to Tokyo with my son for a boys trip to your city in July and this series of videos has been invaluable.
The thumbnail is a lie, Frankie Muniz doesn't appear in this video at all.
Dudes, u two cracked me up for sure after the long day today! The chemistry they made was damn fantasic !
Those extendable bear claws are a godsend for back itches. I have the exact same ones myself!
A very entertaining trek across Tokyo.  Quite challenging to accomplish going the distance in one day.  Congratulations,
One of the best channels on YouTube across all subjects Chris, my current favourite, superb mate!
During my trip to Japan, I walked on average 20k steps a day and still managed to gain weight. 😅
Tokyo stations desgin reminds of the amsterdam central stration. Very similar u shape type design
what about the most efficient/ time saving itenerary for 3night stay ..most ideal order so you can visit the typical or a must visit places in tokyo
The bear paw is a back scratcher! Lols!
I find it so funny that Pete look exactly like the personification of an american from Ryu Ga Gotoku series. The way he looks, the way he acts, all of it 😂
good show
The extendable bear hand is a backscratcher! I have one I got in America haha! I never saw it advertised as a bear hand though, just a scratcher!
The jacket kicks ass👌👍🏻✊🏻😁
God I miss Tokyo so much. Been almost three years since I went, just before the pandemic, and it seems like it's back to being as bustling as it ever was.  And don't think I didn't catch that StarCraft reference, Pete. Based video game taste.
As soon as the yank spoke I turned it off…
Would love more vids like this.
OmG you eat sooo much, no wonder you are overweight😂
Feature caption is the wrong person
@ 8:20  Uh..."yoko" 横 doesn't mean "market" but "side" as in "横町 (Yokochô)" and "横浜 (Yokohama)"
Good watch. Lots of banter n great social vibe.
so doing this walk when I'm japan later in the year.
iam to born 1983 :)
❤❤❤
So, I have to say boys, this video came in very helpful during our trip to Japan! We actually went to Ueno and Senso-ji just from what you guys showed and LOVED IT, Let alone it is how we learned about Super Potato!
1983 represent 😎
Those are cat paw back scratchers. I’ve got 2 of them.
How did you not get an Godzilla merch!!
I love how intelligent you and your friend are about Japan, that is when you're not bashing one another 😴😴😴💤💤💤💤💤
I like the reference to starwars, but obi wan sounds far more British 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Stylish indeed😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chris gets better looking with age❤
Wait wait wait.. Pete is 40???? He seems to be so young-!! I would've guessed late 20's.. wow that blew my mind
Your video encouraged me to explore Tokyo more, still lots of fun deserved to be enjoyed
I love how it’s an almost identical trip to when Ryotoro was with Chris.
for outsiders like me. Why is Shibubya so busy at night, also Roppogi. But inbetween it isn't? Outsider missing the inside story....
what the actual f.... how the h..... PETE IS 40?????
Anyone notice that almost every single person that walked by them were staring at them in some kinda way? 👀🤣
True purpose of the bear claw is to shake Japanese hands 😅😅
39pete
17:20 the polite stranger that shuffles out of the shot with his partner out of respect. This is why i love Japan. So polite.
hahaha the bear claw is for scratching your back 😂
I already live here in Japan, but your videos makes me explore more about Japan.
Extendible bear claw! Love it… scratchy the back with it!
That looked like fun,good food,good drinks...doable.
Dude, your gonna have to give your third favorite american friend an all expense paid weekend at “soapland” or something.
I hope they know the bear claw is a back scratcher lol. I have one and I love it.
Extendable bear hand is actually a back scratcher, for people unable to reach their back with their own hand
Back in 2018 I didn’t like the sake Kit Kats purchased at the airport… I was traveling with my mother but our seats were separated. So I used the Kit Kats as a way to persuade someone to trade seats with me on my flight back to America 😆
Eyyyyy Kof Geese lol
4:49 ARCHOOOOOOOOONN
I can't stop thinking that Pete's smile reminds me of Jack Nicholson's smile😂 Just me?
where can we get Pete's Boss jacket?
it's the guy they meet again in connor's stream lol
Loved this!
the synthwave bgm in this one is FIRE
"Where Chris?" "Here's right here Bro!" "What do you mean?" LOL  P.S. The sound effects for Mr.Mime really make the video.
thought i saw Ryotaro at 1:45...
You can spend it where ever you want... But that also goes into the 🎒   Ehh I'd definitely do that with my favorite Japanese Brit. But I'd start with buying a large bag with wheels
pete is becoming 30 next year nice
“Is this his friend??” Big bite of the fried chicken
❤I love that guys❤
Damn, I would love to walk across Tokyo in a day.  No matter what the weather is like, i'd love to see it
26:10 Dude was about to reveal that he was an imperial Japanese soldier 🤣
I can't believe there is a Koikatsu ad on the street
1983 crew checkin' in!
This was a lit video, very rewatachable
Pete represents the US well. He is charming and personable! (By the way, you did realize the extendable bear paw is actually a back scratcher, right?  😉)
put the time in next time. great video!
Chris has definitely lost lots of weight! Sheesh
Darn it! I'm 1982 XD
im not into being a master or whatever but i would love to see what it ould be like to go to a maid cafe
Wrong place to post I know but formes anyone know where I can get an English subtitled "Wine Road of the Samurai"?
4000 trains a day and only 5000 commuters? Huh? 16:40
It's AKIHABRA not AKI- HAB-ARA
Peter is cute!
I am so ❤❤❤ with Pete! ❤  The extendable bear claw is a backscratcher btw...
Hive of scum and villainy indeed. The Mitsuboshi colors gang operates out of there. They hit you with extra virgin olive oil punches as well.
What’s the name of that 80s synth pop track at 28:44? It’s awsome, perfect choice!
Merci icijapon pour l'idée
What was that? Must have been the wind
My heart does want to go extra mile across Tokyo but my feet throws the towel after 10 km. 😁
We need more Pete
That’s silly about the kit Kat and alcohol. A burger ban or a ripe banana have the same amount of alcohol if only slightly more. That kind of amount of alcohol is practically zero
When the video started, I wanted to know where Pete got that jacket. Im glad it was answered
He got Mr. Mime!!!
Extendable bear claw is for scratch your back, old men.
thought he was gonna take the yen into pachinko ><
thought GIGO = Garbage in Garbage out
Ahaha you two are so fun together, such a great video! i didn't know about the SEGA building tho.. that's so sad
The bear claw is a back scratcher lol
Sorry for the late comment, but this reminds me of a similar personal experience in Tokyo. I was on our highschool's senior trip in Tokyo and the very first night there we went night clubbing. To make a long story short, I ended up alone on foot somewhere in Tokyo and very very drunk. And it was midnight.   I spent the next 4-5 hours wandering the city and asking people, in English, to please point me to Tokyo Ginza. Only one old business dude type refused to respond to me. It was amazing though, in that just about every other person I asked, including police, helped me out by pointing the general direction. I remember when I finally got back to the hotel around 5am-ish, the group were going to breakfast and I asked to skip it as I'd been out wandering my way back the whole night. My request was granted lol. This was back in 1976.
Does anyone know the address of that standing Super Whiskey place they visited? I'm trying to pre-plan and I wanna find that place when I go :)
Rock Howard > Geese
Hello, I really liked your video and I'm going to start following it more, I think it's very intuitive and explanatory, I'm Portuguese and I live abroad and I already find the difference a lot. Keep going because I'll watch all your videos... Good Luck.
I can do more, i walk from Portland to Eugene, Or in a day
Pete has bombastic personality. Youre lucky Chris 😆
Don Quijote is vertical Costco. It’s insane, I love it.
I was also wondering where you got that boss coffee jacket! Lol.
Thanks mates, I'm a long time subscriber finally going to Tokyo on Tuesday 3/7. If you spot you guys... I'll try not to geek out like the rest xD
got a picture of the shimbashi alley I could use as a wallpaper?
more walking videos pls! do sendai or kyoto next!
mega highball after fried chicken...breakfast of champions
Ja
Love your videos..I know this u tuber from oki nawa bwatch your videos too kit zakimi
Drinking after an appendicitis, Pete my boy that’s not recommended.😂
Everyone: CHRIS BROAD... No one: And Pete...
16:06 genshin impact player  *leonardo dicaprio pointing meme*
17:21 right on, they dont have a modern architecture, everything is literally a box
I did that walk in reverse because we were drunk and didn’t realize what times the trains stopped😂😂😂
I Wish I can Visit Also Tokyo Soon! ;)
Tech geek note: the sorry building that replaced SEGA, GiGO,  plays on the English software engineering phrase: GIGO- "garbage in, garbage out", which is a phrase to describe when technology goes wrong because of poor programming.  Can't tell if that's a poke at SEGA, self-deprecation, or complete coincidence.
2:12, "The fuck are these gaijins doing?" the way they look
Funny thing about those bear hands. In where I live in the states they used to be sold in souvenir shops. My aunt bought one for each family member so my house had three of those things. They are also just stylized back scratchers.
kit kat lush meow
Tell pete the bear paw is actually a back scratcher lol! 💕🙃
Reminds me of a walk my friends and I did in 2019 where we were out in Nakano, missed the last train and decided to walk to our hostel at Hirai station.
don't know if its been said already but  Pete is a proud owner of a bear back scratcher
Pete’s mannerisms totally remain me of the old school actor Chris Farley in Beverly Hills Ninja and Tommy boy 😄😃  so funny.
pete is like the kindest American I met.
Yeah, even before he mentioned it I thought “Why is Chris eating that Kit Kat like a psycho?”
I'll be in Tokyo in a month (hopefully) so this is really helpful as an outline for my trip!
Wait, Ameyoko Market means Ame Market Market?
He doesn't love you Pete! You deserve better. Also, I've heard that he's engaged, so this relationship can only go wrong for you. 😜   In all seriousness, it's great to see American Pete along for the journey. I love his sense of humor and getting his perspective on the areas. 😄
Pete's a good sport 😄
Réponse C la Tour Eiffel ❤ Quelle question ?! Very nice vid as always. Congrats on the engagement 💍
Isn’t Chris part chicken by now? How does vegan Sharla deal? 😆
"when would anyone ever want an extendable bear hand?"  *me with cronic back itch* "ME! NOW! ALL THE TIME! GIMME GIMME GIMME!!!!!!"
That subtle "paid in full" reference. Nice xD
Went to Tokyo, Japan back in 2018 and seeing all the places I went too, thru you brings me so many good memories! ❤️
Did anyone know the bear claw was a back scratcher ? LuL
Tokyo has a bigger population than my entire country 😐
I've done something similar to this. Not from Asakusa to Shibuya but from Oshiage (Sky tree) -> Asakusa -> Ueno -> Akihabara -> Tokyo Dome. Wasn't too long (only took half a day) but it was beautiful and nice.
extendable bear claw is probably a back scratcher xD
aww americsn friend is adorable. we all need an amerian friend like him. like best reliable pokemon aleays on your team heeee hee
I walked from my hotel in Asakusa close  to Sensou-ji all the way to the Eastern Gardens of the Imperial Palace, walked around that (Amazing location, highly recommend, completely free) and then walked back to my hotel. Amazing walk... Everyone should do it. It was only about 12 km round trip, but very very enjoyable
I love that they just call the backscratcher “an extendable bear hand” as if they don’t know what a backscratcher is lol
I love Pete man. I save these videos for when I'm feeling a little depressed and out of it, and the videos with Pete always cheer me up.  He's such a happy genuine person. I hope he's as happy inside as he is outside.
東京の人はよく歩く、車を全く使わない
16:45 Did Chris mean to say "50,000 commuters passing through everyday?" I can't imagine only 5,000 in Tokyo station.
Just a quick note, if you walk next to the train line from Ueno to Akihabara there’s still lots of shops and restaurants so it’s actually pretty interesting.
what no connor??? but ahhh you are engaged.  no more real adventure for you.
When I lived in Japan in 2020 I used to do these walks between 2 points of the Yamanote Line because I only had money for the train back
15:35 ofc it has to be love live ahahaha
Gaijin often misunderstand about making offerings and buying amulets at different temples. The Japanese go to one temple, and one temple only. Doing otherwise suggests that you don’t believe that Temple A will see you through the year.
次は船清の屋形船all you can drink and eat! It’s the best! Book this yakatabune now for 夏に隅田川花火大会！今bookしないと売り切れる！my hubby and I try to do it for every summer if we can and leave the kids with my parents!
Hey Chris! I love your show and I watch it with my hubby and kids all the time! I’m watching this episode right as I comment. 浅草に行くなら行く店間違えてるよ〜私は下町っ子だから言わせてもらうけど、浅草雷門に行くならまず人形焼でしょう！それに小さいキビ団子の店に焼きたて煎餅ぬれ煎餅にあの有名なメロンパンでしょう！大きい台湾フライドチキンはNewかもだけどtraditionを載せなきゃ意味ないじゃん😂浅草行ったら天国に行ってホットケーキ🥞にコーヒー食べなくちゃ❤だって甘太郎のドラマにでたでしょう。😁👍🏼今度東京に来たら行ってみてね〜 Keep doing the fun stuff!! Maybe next time do the awesome (can’t do mediocre ramen, gotta research amazing ramen places !) ramen ranking through out Japan, Hokkaido to Okinawa! 😉 We’re super foodies, when we go back to Japan every summer we find a hole in a wall great food places! ❤️💜❤️💜
you and Sharla are made for each other, you both don't split kitkats :')
Pete stop saying you are old! :D I was born in '83 too, if you are old, I am too, and I feel nowhere close to that, so you're not allowed either :D
Chris you’re looking fine as fuck! All the best from Germany. Love your content
29:05 this looks like a scene in call of the night
The bird is suicidal..walking around hundreds of people😂😂
Paid in full
That tunnel at 29:00...I hate that tunnel every bit as much as you did. I used to commute to work through it on bike, the street felt like a deathtrap on bike and the raised walking paths were so narrow you could barely get a bike on it much less pass a pedestrian.  This whole video made me impossibly nostalgic for my time there regardless.
Chris mentioning One piece just made my day lmao!
neither sharla nor chris split their kitkats in recent videos. truly that's kismet
the route they took was only 15km something haha
i fucking love your content, chris. - long time fan
Walk across nagasaki
Such a good vid
Chris drinking his beer like a monkey at the end of the video indicates he has been hanging around Connor too much
My man Pete is a king of fighters fan?! Let's goo
In germany train station are pretty much all the same: dirty, full of pigeons, lots of junkies, way too many beggars and people trying to steal your wallet. +a lot of them look decrepit. The only good looking ones are in major cities like cologne and frankfurt. And even those have the same problems as every other one
Great video Chris, also you are looking really healthy good for you. Keep up the good work 😃
Maybe life is about the journey that we made along the way
PETE
he appears vaccinated
Great Video, this was a good idea inviting him!👍🏼
That extensible bear hand is a back scratcher.  Works great for those of use who lost the manual dexterity tom reach behind.
CN Tower is the best
Burning 1500 calories is actually a lot. Like you need a daily intake of calories. So it wouldn't be good to burn all the calories you ate that day 😂
That really puts into perspective how huge Tokyo is. You can walk  across Paris from north to south in just around 2h.
paid in full huh... did he have ¥200 in change Mr. Mime cost ¥2200 or is there a lot of haggling there to?
Walking Across Japan
just wanted to say this might be your best video yet Chris. Thanks for pushing what you can do with your content and making these dope videos
Love to see some stories about the underwater coasts of Japan sea life if you ever could figure out how to film that well. Underwater technology is ever evolving and it's getting much easier to film some great stuff under the surface
2:11 u will see a pair of eyes :D
I saw Ryotaro's back at Asakzuka!
Not me logging onto my phone to tell Peter I'm also a Boar scum of america. 28 never looked so tired.
I love my extendable bear hand.  I don't understand British values!  Seriously, it is great for scratching places you can't reach.   Also it doesn't take up much room.
26:17 That guy's more British than Chris
PETE!  How 'bout those ________________!!!
that guy is a total tool
Chris broke out the chad chin in this video
Wait, there is a video of it being dismantled? Anyone knows the name of that video?
And you should definitely visit teamlabs tokyo, it's an amazing audiovisual museum like no other.
Great video. Tokyo station architecture is actually based on Amsterdam Central Station in the Netherlands, so the Western look comment is correct.
8+hrs of walk and Pete still slayin it till the end.Go Pete Go🙌🙌💖💖💖🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wonder if we will see any more videos about nagano? one of my fave prefectures :')
English guy getting annoyed by goofiness and fun lol borderline cliche. The American guy was super funny
American fans please don’t hate me! I’m not the biggest fan of most things American but “American Pete” ALWAYS puts a smile on my face, he never fails, podcast or YouTube, he’s just a great guy. And Pete, I was also born in 1983, let’s go!!
What a wonderful awesome film boys!
Just about the route I used to skate when I visited in 2012!
This is actually a cool itinerary for people that wants to visits tokyo.
6:27 that's some serious auto-focus right there. I want that camera 📸 what is it?
Looking forward to the Stag do Abroad!
This makes me wanna visit Japan so much more! I’m not even a huge fan of the city life but being able to experience all of this at least once would be amazing. Hopefully we get to see you guys check out other cities that aren’t as popular to us foreigners!
Please put subtitles!!!😭I need them!!! Please don't automate subtitles, it sucks. Otherwise great work.👍
25:03 just make me think of the movie Hackers.
Good news, though. In the average grown man, JUST EXSISTING costs about 1000 calories a day!
I actually have one of the extendable bear hand, i got it for a back scratcher but it kinda sucks...
8:06 love how the other women got surprised that she said lets Go!
Before i die i have to make it to Tokyo once.... even though i'm an Ex Air Trooper who is scared of flying all that way in a commercial jet, maybe one day lol.
With Japan’s awesome technology, why aren’t their newer tall buildings not more artistically built 😟
24:25 Can't believe a man of Chris's age has never seen a back scratcher before!
for those pondering about express, don't. they've been purchased by a malware developer
It's a back scratcher
Fun fact: Tokyo Station was actually modeled after the central station of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
I have the extendable bear hand (came with a skeleton version and a normal hand version) no I’ve never been happier. You won’t find a better back scratcher that folds up into your pocket in all the land!
I felt bad for Pete at min 15:00 as he's uncomfortable for a good part of the video (until about min 19:20) after you said he kinda looked like the cartoon they poked fun at him with when was a kid. Protecc that man pls lol he's making your fanbase grow even larger
Wow great effort, 8 hours of walking sounds like a marathon. Good video, it was entertaining 👍
American Pete has really grown on me. I enjoy his appearances a lot. Now if he could just get rid of that pommy git.
i have one of those bear claws, it's a back scratcher. And honestly, it's amazing.
Looking fantastic, Chris.
The extendable bear claw is a back scratcher I reckon 😂 love the video this is a really cool concept hope to see u do it again!  :)
Something about Pete makes me uncomfortable, am I alone in this? There a quiet desperation behind his eyes and he carried himself with poorly feigned humility. Anyways, good vid! Enjoyed it!
I'm coming back to Tokyo for a visit next year. I hope I bump into you!
Pete is so funny we need him in more videos!
I wanna visit japan so fucking muchhh
Pete has quite the resemblance with Theo Katzman. I'm just expecting him to break into song
I need a playlist with those synthwave tracks
hahah love pete
I think it would have been a much nicer route if after Akiba you had walked through Jimbocho, the old castle area, then towards Roppongi Hills and then either straight to Shibuya or make a short detour via Ebisu. It would have been shorter and I think there would have been more to see.
Always love Pete, event exploring haunted places Pete is the man to bring
1983 represent!
29:19 The fuck is that poster dude.
Hey don’t knock the extendable bear claw back scratcher guys! I legit got one!😂
adorable
1984, year of the rat, let’s gooooo!! 😅
Love!
Pete gas gotta be the only guy within a 5000 kilometre radius wearing a Pom Pom tuque. Hey Pete, did you think you guys were in Fargo or something? 😂😂😂   25:06 Hey those extendable bear claws are actually back scratchers. I know, I own one. Bought it in Kingsville, ON., Canada. Use it all the time and it’s fantastic.   (I’m actually surprised that  “extendable bear claw” was what came to mind for you guys. I thought it was pretty obvious. But then again, my upper back was as itchy as flannel sheets in allergy season when I came across it singing “Sweeet Caroline, da da da…good times”— you get the picture.
Well done boys, you two are the quintessential flâneur ie. a figure who understands the sheer enjoyability of the modern city – the exhilaration, and display, of promenading to see and be seen, which is all part of the urban character. Thank you, a lot of fun.
Conveniently ignores the wish the Terminator drawn on it
The extendable bear claw is a back scratcher used to have one 😅
Our man's went and got a bloody jawline!
5000 Commuters per day in Tokyo Mainstation? Zurich Mainstation has over a million per day, so that can't be true. Switzerland is tiny.
8:06 Let’s Go
4 thousand trains a day and 5 thousand passengers a day almost a train each 😂😂 just saying
The Bear Claw back scratcher is the best!!!!! I LOVE mine!! AHAHAHA
Was that £10 for six strawberries!!!!!??
"most busiest"??
2000 yen is more like US$15 only
Really enjoyed this one! I want more videos of you two walk in other cities 🌆
Chris never fails to capture the mood and everything I love about Japan with his music choices. It's just the perfect combination.
I respect that highball.  Pete is truly a man of class.
I was there literally at the same time only for a few days and i thought it was impossible to see it all in one day.. well... Got proven wrong.
21:46 A rip-off is not better than the original thing.
Pete is living the dream.
PETE, PETE, PETE, PETE, PEEEEEEEETE.
HELLO FELLOW KING OF FIGHTERS FAN!!  (Since I'm a Terry main... *shakes fist* GEESE!!)
WHERE DID HE HET THAT BOSS COFFEE JACKET????
Don't swear!
Good to se ya Chris in a good shape! What about your girl?
The thing about ‘we walked all day and a single meal was more calories than we burned’ is what makes me feel like the only way not to get fat is to never leave the house 😅
i like pete
The extendable bear arm is a back scratcher
Ji pie is Taiwan staple (big fry chicken)
Love to see Pete again! Thanks for the tour and the laughs
ボスジャン着てるじゃん！☕🧥
If Pete has his own youtube channel, I'd definitely subscribe
Who wants an extendable bear hand? Short people with high shelves. ;)
The bear hands are back scratchers. 😄 24:44
Everyone got an history Leson here lol ...
Crazy Pete !
Everyone knows that Joey is Chris favorite child 😂🤣
That bear claw would be an amazing back scratcher 😂
Pete has to be one of the most naturally funny and laidback dudes on the interwebs
Dude. 40 is still young. Kind of. Maybe not in Japan.
I love your channel Chris! Can’t wait to see more!
29:07 that worked way too well with the music, considering how weird it was lol
Lovely cybereske Tokyo video :D Love to see you gaving a good time with you pal Pete!
Not Chris getting his broke-est friend to walk with him ... However Pete was the best choice cause Joey will get a taxi with his money and Connor will just buy random stuff while berating Chris every single step
Pete my fellow 1983!
I saw your recommendation of the sake flavored kitkat, and when I went to japan bought it. It’s fanfuckingtastic, I love it ❤
Those sake kitkats are the worst, I'm convinced you were faking the reaction
the stretch gorilla face at the end. lol This was great. i love pete. he is a beautiful soul.
good lord the gorilla looked so fucked up
FYI - The extendable bear claw is actually a back scratcher!
Was that an asian with a british accent? You dont see that everyday
Have you heard of Ultraman? I have never met anyone who has visited or lived in Japan for anytime that has ever heard of Ultraman. Am I crazy? Soooo, on that note, have you ever been to Soshigaya Street in Setagaya City? Toho Studios is a 15-minute walk from the train station for Godzilla fans. A little bit on Ultraman, Kamen Rider and all the ranger stuff might be a fun cultural bit to do. If tokusatsu nerdery isn't your brand, please forget I mentioned it. Love your channel!  P.S. Pete is a great, BTW.
gay.
This is probably one of my favorite videos of you, for sure! It was funny, interesting, and even your sour humour was really nice balance to this video! Your guest is also super fun! I'm gonna watch the other videos with him too! It reminded me of when my cousins from other cities would come by São Paulo and we'd walk all over town! I know you said that it's a big walk, but it also reminded me that some parts could def be those walk around streams, very chill, but probably tiring to make yes? I hope I get more money this month bc I'm curious to get the full version from patreon now!
The bear claw is to scratch your back...
I love seeing pete in chris' videos. Oh the positive vibes he brings 👌🏽
Pete is one of the better representations of us Americans.  He's proof not all of us are the absolute worst!
This video was so well done and one of my favorite videos that you did. So happy you got Pete on here I can tell from the comments a lot of the viewers were loving him too! ☺️
Im pretty sure its been said but its 5yen
Jojo Stone Ocean promo at 29:27
how do people watch this channel?  honestly, why? its so god damn bad.
Funny Americain friend lol😂
Absolutely beautifull video
The extendable bear claw would make a great back scratcher.
Great video again Chris, does anyone know if Pete has his own channel?
‘It’s just us walking, it’s quite boring’ when there’s a whole ass market on YouTube for several hour long walking videos in Tokyo 😂
Happy Pete knows Power Overwhelming. Bet he knows operation cwal. Hope he sees this. 🙏🏼
Brilliant video until Chris ate a kit kat
Oh my goodness your mate is so cute 😭❤️  And your in your own league Chris 😘
first time here...this reminds me of an old british car show i used to watch. i like it. 🤣
Maid Cafe! YES! YES! I AM INTO THAT!
Absolutely loved Pete, he’s likes a ray of sunshine! ☀️ Both of your personalities bounce off each other so nicely as well. Mr. Mine was a great addition as well. Haha
yall act like you've never seen a back scratcher before
I have the SAME back scratcher!!
Nice.
when you getting a GF my man?
This is my favourite way of seeing Tokyo or any city. The stuff you find along the way is always better than the tourist spots you plan on visiting
That's pretty cool I guess.
16:43 So 4,000 trains arriving and departing daily, and 5,000 commuters passing through it every single day?  Does that mean that all the trains hold a little more than a single person per train?
I have that extendable bear claw!! It's a back scratcher and it's great haha. Loved the video, its so cool to see how walkable Tokyo is
I was in Japan 2018 and was there for 18 days, managed to clock in 310km walking. But that wasn't all the travelling, trains, buses, etc. Loved it, woke up with stiff legs ( i'm older) but nothing like a good walk to loosen them up.
Caesar salad and french fries is looking pretty tasty right now 🤤
Pete is such a delight to have! xD im loving seeing him more and more on streams and videos
Pete calling out on chris bs...lol love pete ♥
Abroad in Japan the upcoming Netflix documentary
30:58 Still very clean, considering cities that shan't be named (cough cough Toulouse 🇫🇷 cough cough) where, for some reason, I keep finding 💩 and smashed 💩 scattered all over the sidewalks.
27:14 Made me spit out my tea! Hilarious! :D
Is that the official city limits or prefecture? I walked 15 miles a day average in 2019  for 5 days and I felt  I didn't scratch the very thinnest layer of the city .
Im not saying I would, but walking through Tokyo high as a kite off the Mary Jane would be wild. Mainly cause I'd probably get literally lost in the culture. Which totally isn't panic inducing at all. 7/11 is fire in Japan anyway
1:28 you're face says "he thinks I'm joking"
your face gains are fantastic btw
Is it As-suck-sa? Or A-sa-ku-sa?
i eat full 4 stick kitkats like that too... just bite into it... no need to break it apart, i aint sharing.
Japan should be paying you cuz it seems you bring in a lot of tourists now.  one day i'll make it there... probably when im too old to fully enjoy it all.
Ginza Line minus the ¥200 fare 😅
Lookin like a sexy British man
For 2023. For this channel: 1) I love to see this walking series continue 2) A series with Pete (both Pete if possible) Tales of Two Pete/ Pete vs Pete(?) Two Pete exploring Japan and doing challenges and eating delicious food.  3) A series with Garnt (Taken for Garnt-ed)
Tokyo is such a beautiful and awesome city. I hope one day to go there myself. I know I will, its just a matter of making the time for it.
I have done many walks like this, and I think it absolutely is the best thing about Tokyo.
I miss Japan. Just got back from my 2nd time there and feeling extra depressed. Just Tokyo alone, everything is within an easy distance of each other, and the convenience alone is just amazing. Already want to go back.   But judging by this video, def missed that rain that was coming in on my way out.
Pete is so cute
I too would be the extendable bear claw it would make a brilliant back scratcher 😁
taiwan big fried chicken without bubble milk tea is fcking incomplete
🍺🍺🍺
When Pete asked for other '83 boars,  I wanted to reply 'me!' Except I was born in January '83, so technically I'm a dog.  Still thrilled to learn someone in the Abroad in Japan circle is, in fact, my age though!
Just 20?  I did 30+ in one day,  Western Itabashi Ward to Ike to Shinjuku to Roppongi to DT Tokyo to Ueno back to Ike and then home.  Man, my nips and feet were sore as hell after that walk.
Pete the GOAT~!
Elon Musk?
Heyyy!!! Was that Nobita from "The Japan Reporter" at 04:30 ?! 🤔😄
Reminds me of my first day visiting Tokyo in 2019. Walked 25k steps. Was quite tired at the end of the day 😅
This was so amazing!!  Learned so much!!  Once again, thanks for all the amazing adventure content!!  And thanks for including Pete!
I want Pete to have all the best life can offer. What a chill dude.
Watching Chris and Pete make fun of whoever bought the bear hand back scratcher knowing that it's secretly my favorite stocking stuffer gift from my wife is absurdly funny 🤣 Chris, I'm the guy who'd buy it damnit!
Brings back some great memories.  I will never walk between Shibuya and Rappongi ever again.  😂
You can literally count the wrinkles on your face in the intro, there's so many
I like pete (hope I spell the name right)
Pete used the wrong cheat code, it's not Power overwhelming, it's Show me the money
The bear hand is for scratching your back Pete
Isn’t the extendable bear claw just a back scratcher?
Hiroshima has been one of the most charming places I've walked in, especially at dusk
no disrespect, but having very similar looking buildings simply looks spectacularly clean.
JFC Chris' videos are great advertising for Japan Just walking around a city looks so interesting
Very nice - you really caught some athmosphere!
Chris spilling his beer at the end is pure gold hahahahahhaha
4:48 ¥2000 turned Pete into an archon
You really stuck it out and made it the whole way!
2000 yen is now $15 dollars lmao.
Just got back from Tokyo and my feet are numb from the amount of walking I did.
Indeed, this is the best way to experience Tokyo! From Japanontology
You should have just gone to the pub with everyone at that point when they recognised you 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Should give the giga highball a go
That is not a real bird. It is a sky-rat. They ruin every area they populate.
Pete was an artist at some point? That 20 dlls excitement reminds me when I used to be a busker XD
Man this video was amazing. Can’t wait to watch it again.
great video. always love a Pete feature
Alright. Tired of being humiliated. Which camera app is best for taking QR codes ON AN ANDROID
One of my favourite episodes! Really made me miss Tokyo!!
Bingewatching the last 12 mothns of videos, this is going to be something 🔥.
I don't know if its just the American side of me, but Pete is my favorite person you travel with.
4000 trains a day, and 5000 commuters a day... Or is that just 5000 commuters during rush hour?
That wasn't a bird. It was a pigeon.  They are flying rats.
I like that you made the video length a bit longer now, always thought your videos ended a bit too quickly at times.
28:06 that makes no sense. Bananas has around that amount of ethanol in them. Kids can buy them no problem 😂
Couldn't Ame just be the transliteration of America?
that dark at 05 pm? wow
Please tell me someone told them that was a back scratcher......
My wife and I did a similar journey around Toronto Canada, but we did just over 28k steps. If we hadn't taken a cablecar we probably would have hit 30k steps as well.
I would honestly watch a tv show where Chris is a travel guide around Japan
I love Pete 🥺
Pete is so cute
My household has multiple extended bear 🐻 hands (although we call them raccoon 🦝 hands). They make fantastic back scratchers! Also a good stocking-stuffer gift.
The Boss Coffee jacket Is pretty sick
Sad to see Sega building go. Shows Nintendo game 10/10 would be sad again
SO EXCITED FOR THIS!! :D
neither Chris nor Sharla snap their kitkats in half. Truly a match made in heaven
Been in Japan for the last 5 days. I can proudly say I've been to all these places
The tokyo tower has been my phone background since I visited 3.5 years ago. It just looks so damn good at night. Also I love towers and skyscrapers
I think Japan is the only place I would feel comfortable walking in back alleys
00:19 a girl eating and walking. Thought this was a murder sentence in Japan!
Let me guess. It's Chris eating chicken skewers again.
pete is amazing holy shit
I'm with you, Pete. 1983! Best year!
Congestion... contact... contamination.... Alas! What a shithole, big flied chicken notwithstanding.
26:33 haha i was thinking how cool is that jacket too coz i love boss coffee! 😂
you could start a series like "Samurai Gourmet" walking around Tokyo or any other cities in Japan like Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, etc looking for new places to eat. 🤩
Squeeze my gorilla sack,  my new favourite quote, couldn't stop laughing. Great video. 🤣
15:20 that voice change all of a sudden. :D
American Pete is way too happy to be American. You sure he’s not Canadian?
Pete looked so happy to be on this trip. Like a child when he got that 2000 yen pocket money. Loved it
This is a good way to burn those excess fats.
Imagine they do this with pewdiepie
Japan is still leading the technological front as far as gaming is concerned. No other company comes close to Nintendo and Sony when it comes to sales.
25 : 6 = 4km/hour 12 hours = 2km/hour  don't forget you also burn 1800 cal passively but since you walked that much you probably burned more passively.. you probably burned 4000cal that day if not more i honestly have no idea. your phone app doesn't tell you everything.
Can you do one for OSAKA and KYOTO?
Chris looks too healthy these days.
Hello Chris, so nice to see that you are in such a great shape, congrats!!! Great video as usual 😊
Psh rookie numbers, I do this all over Asia on the daily  haaa, just giving you a hard time, its cool to see Japan has side walks, thats a HUGE plus, im normally 4x4 though G-d knows what to get some where that isn't Here(At the moment)
The golden retriever vibes paired with the grouchy chihuahua vibes are immaculate     ….You know who’s who
The extendable bear claw is a back scratcher.
I love pete’s overwatch reference
Your thirt best american friend is an asset to your channel. He is very funny and I love the contrast between you two; the British guy and the american guy. I love to watch the adventures you share together. Great stuff.
The bear claw is a back scratcher! Not just a weird extendable hand. Lol they work great! Pete is such a treasure.
I miss Japan so much!
Japanese cities are very safe. One night I walked home from work for a few hours instead of taking the train. It was refreshing.
I just noticed how many American Foreigners are in the background of this video
I have one of those extendable bear claws.  It makes a great back scratcher.
A friend of mine recently walked along the Yamanote Line over night. He's kind of an idiot 😂
Pete is such an awkward cutie. Please show more of him. He's very lovely
Wait- so Tokyo station has 4000 trains/day but just 5000 commuters daily? Perhaps you meant 500 000? lol Cool video, love to see that wacky Pete guy! xD
The extendable bear claw is a back scratcher FYI. :)
Dont usually comment on anything. But i Just want to say i love the dynamic between you and pete all time such a pleasure to watch thanks
Im with ya, Pete!! 1983! Great video as always, Chris.
The shot at 19:40 is so aesthetic to me
Is Pete ok? He seems depressed 😅
killing a bird that would be a really bad start for the video... two minutes later, they eat two
First video in a new series?  Would be good though, to see different areas of Tokyo along the various lines!
"Tokyo feels like several cities wrapped into one" Thats because it well it basically is. exactly that :'D
27:06 - It's [Tokyo Tower] the tallest building in Tokyo  Tokyo Skytree: Am I a joke to you?
Oh noooo Chris has fallen for the ExpressVPN gang :(
The most I walked in Tokyo  in one day was 32km
If only I would have money to afford a journey to Japan….
Good video!
Well excuse me mister! The extended bear hand is a very functional back scratcher!! :D  No but for real, I have long hair and so often I have hair inside my sweater somewhere along the back. It is sooo frikking nice to just extend the claw and give the back a good scratch in those hard to reach places. Lovely thing :) Good that Pete had some sense and got it ;)
Loved this video! So soothing and interesting! Would love to visit Tokyo at some point!
90s kid would know what “power overwhelming” does. 😂
Chris and Pete are such opposite personalities, I love Pete's energy and humor!!!
ANOTHER BOAR!! idk it made me excited 😂 gang gang (1997)
YEAR OF THE BOAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don’t know how you did it.. but you made a walking trip around most of Tokyo’s most familiar spots so refreshingly interesting! Must be the magic of Mr Mime! 😝
Pete and Mr. Affable have done it again. You know when Pete shows up it will be a good time.
The positivity from the video was contagious... one of the best videos I've seen recently
i thoroughly enjoyed watching this <3 anyone else love their friendship dynamic? :)
25:00 LOVED THAT hahahaha Pete you'd make a perfect hippie haha.
''Cum-pie'' Ohh noooo X,D
Yo you guys really did not get that the "extended bear paw" is a back scratcher? :D And I absolutely would have got one for myself aswell since I am quite the bear and back always itches :D
Journey Across Japan: Short Edition
I recognize so many of these places after living here for 3 years. I'm pretty sure I know the exact Hobgoblin you ended up at, from the sign and the seating arrangements XD
U Guys Fkn Awesome ! Respect & Love < Toronto, Canada > Ehh
30:41 what a fkn waste
Really loved this video!! Also loved Pete's jacket too XD
"Stop killing the birds" - Proceeds to order chicken xD
My dad has that extendable bear hand ~
"I watch your videos!" "NOW YOU'RE IN A VIDEO!" lmaoo
Pete gives such golden retriever energy, I love how upbeat and positive he always is
1983 Club! Let's Go!
Pete is my favourite Guest-Star! Chris and Pete Show = The Dream Team! 💪🏻
Walking across Japan???
CHRIS, the Extendable Bear Hand is.......... a Back Scratcher!!   I had one. LOL
Wait that High Ball drink cost $15+??
I’ve done this route before. It’s tiring but super rewarding indeed
I had to rewind this because I thought I heard something weird but it’s just that one song from one piece that everywhere
Psst, hey chris... You're looking good man! the effort you put in really has shown
Not sure why there's such a calm aesthetic to this video, the music, or the lightly overcast weather, but the vibe feels very different and I like it.
my man with the sake flavored kitkats! so good
The worst thing about Chris's videos is that I end up wanting to eat what he was eating (except for the non-American food like bears or horses).  The karaage, katsu, ramen, onigiri and musubi, yakitori, soba, Ghengis Khan, gyoza, yasai, kudamono, mochi, etc. -- it all looks so inviting.  How are any of us subscribers supposed to stay fit?
I'm still freaking out about how Chris mistreated the poor kitkat.
Dunno what it is but Chris is looking real skinny now? At least his face has definitely lost some of the chub.
This was a lot of fun, I'd love to meet Pete. I'm definitely gonna check out his twice channel as well. He's a chill guy. Also, he's American, so SUPPIRT OUR BRO!!   It's funny how much of the journey reminds me of how it looks here in New York, how Shibuya looks like Times Square, how the walk through Roppongi looks like the alleyways in Brooklyn and the Tokyo Station looks like a location in Manhattan on 14th street or the Midtown station where you get the Amtrack train. I've always wanted to go to Japan, and after seeing all this, I NEED to go there now.
The end was the best with that back scratcher! I'm sad that the Sega building has been rebranded. I'll have to treasure the pictures I have with me in front of it when it said Sega back in 1994.
Chris mentioned that crossing without any sort of irony. Where am I?
Jesus Christ, Japan is expensive
I could watch multiple seasons of this
I'm watching the video waiting for one of them to acknowledge that the bear claw is a freakin back scratcher.
I loved it when Pete cracked in Akihabara! :) Done with Chris’s bullshit!!
25:40 aren't casinos ilegal in japan? Can someone explain?
This video definitely fills that void in my heart when I can't travel to Japan yet, thank you Chris 🥹🥹
Come to Kobe!
83! me too!
Extendable bear claw is a back scratcher.
Pete is so funny hahaha i love seeing him on your videos!
As a AiJ sub for a few years, I don’t think Chris is a shill for advertising but glad he’s now using his solid fan base to finally get the return on investment
Just great fun.  The music, the sights, the fun you guys had -- well done, and we want more!  Thanks for another fun time.
Every episode with Pete is such a blast. XD
i love how chris just ate the strawberry in a bite😂
"Power overwhelming!" That man plays starcraft
Your third favorite American makes for my #1 favorite co-host. Excellent work! One day I hope to visit these places ❤❤
Hey, Pete. Who is your main KOF team?
I just love Pete. He brings so much positivity and joy to the table.. people really need someone like him in their lives
Glad to see Pete brought this Chris fellow along for the ride... hope he features him in his next videos
Great video, I’m visiting Japan in March, including Tokyo, so great to see some of the different areas of the city 😁🇯🇵
I ❤ Tokyo at night
Pete was an amazing host. Wow.
Are you sure that Tokyo Station is on the Ginza Line? I think you had one too many highballs.
24:25 our boys not knowing what a backscratcher is XD i really did love this so much though. The personal look at so many places i've only seen in tv/anime/games is SO great. I'm terrified of crowds but i still want to go to Asakusa. XD
24:32 that was a back scratcher. But with pointy claws they're probably made for the backs of your enemies than your own.
Man, I love your videos. It's helped inspire me to visit the world despite my fears and so I'm putting money aside to take a trip maybe next year. I'm happy to know theres so much more out there to see
1984 here almost lol I love to get some of that big chicken 🐔
I want a Love Booze Weak t-shirt.
Petes energy is so infectious. You can tell he expresses such love for Japan the way he talks about it
Love this! New series but needs to be with Pete akin to wacky weekend with Connor. "Chris and Pete: Unstoppable Feet"
Pete is super fun guy to hang out with
Lovely vid, great companion to have too. You burnt more than 1500 cal. Your body is still burning as it recovers, for a good 4-5 hours after so you're looking at close to a woman's rec calorie intake. I know this only cos I would always lose a shitload of weight every holiday, despite the mass calorific consumption of food. And a personal trainer gave me the lodown as to why. And that is your useless bit of info for the day.
@25:00 was the best bit. Loved this video!
I actually own one of those extendable bear hands. They're backscratchers!
Bro you have a lump on the right side of your  throat you should have looked at by a doctor
"big fried chicken"? Where I come from we call the "milanesa'
I enjoy how the video captures you from the begining! The niaration from Chris is spot on and captivates you just like any 3xA movie would. I think that is one of the amazing secrets why this channel is so good. That and ofc Natsuki.
There is nothing about this video i dont find perfect.
I think  i saw ryotoro in the video
Stop calorie counting you donut - look up ketosis, do a bit of fasting, regular exercise not random exercise then binge. You look good anyway BTW, western normal size.
Woow, it was just 30k steps? I would have thought more, but this sounds really manageable.
Oh my god there's actually someone [roughly] my age on the internet!?! Awesome!!
How can he hate mr mime, I love him.
I would love to do something like this with a good mate! Cool stuff.
Incredible video. Alot of fun to watch. I wanna know the background music too please 🙏  @29:00
Incredible video. Alot of fun to watch. I wanna know the background music too please 🙏  @29:00
A revelation about this very large human hive of a city.  Loved it.
Greatest video in the last months! Ty
ARGH…pissed I didn’t hit up the Taiwanese chicken place when I was in Asakusa last October…next time.
Do they not know thats a back scratcher?
0:39 there's New genesis playing in the background. I guess Ado is huge in Japan right now.
Hey Chris, you ever thought about picking up a hobby like Geocaching? I feel like with how explorative and outgoing you are, it would be something really up your alley
13:05 U a real one if you know :(
22:58 Tim Allen moment
The bear hand is a back scratcher
that was a great video
Wonderfull video - hope its not another...what like 7 months till your next one
Great Video⛩️🗼, thank you!
I need to know where Pete got that jacket
squeeze on my gorilla sack hahaha
I appreciate knowing Pete is a StarCraft nerd from one silly joke 😂 Loved this video. This is how I like to experience a city I'm in for the first time. Always feels like a better way to get the local experience than being in a cab all the time.
oof man where did the years go, you look so old
Walk through the lunar year festival
Cool idea Chris!^_^🚶‍♂️
4:02 Pete's spirit animal won't leave 🤣
Pete is so energetic and positive
I'm glad you highlighted that people feel that KitKat eating method is monsterous... Because it hurt my soul😂
Awesome video! Pete in the videos are always good!
I have that exact same Bear Claw extendable back scratcher that I bought in Ueno in 2014. Best scratcher ever.
That extendable bear claw is a back scratcher!
What’s great duo. More of these please always a pleasure
I always regret getting the big fried chicken about half way though 😕
At least there is a lot to look at. It is further than that for me to get into the city where I live and the same the entire way.
I did something similar in 2019 but in Kyoto.37000 steps which was about 17km.That night I slept like a log and it was hard to get outta bed next day
I've just come directly from your first few videos, the production quality you've achieved now is phenomenal!
As a loyal patron, WE NEED MORE PETE!
21:14  A train on top of a building?! How do people live there without going insane?  I mean I have lived near a church, but after a few days your brain edits out the half-hourly bells and you simply don't notice them anymore.  But how can you not notice a train on your roof?
Never thought about how big Tokyo is. The logistics and maintenance gotta be a nightmare
28:14 cant help noticing the PDA at the back 😆
I walked 16 Kilometres in Tokio at night. That was a magical experience.
This video retreads a surprising bit of the city I'm familiar with.  I love it.  And Pete is such a joy.  Thank you for sharing such a lovely walk.  That's a lot of distance.  What a cool day!
Mr mime needs to go with for all future city walks vids
wish i could scroll down and read some interesting comments, instead of endless dudes going "omg this video gives me the most delectable slice of sugoi japanese culture before my already booked trip later in the year" i dont want to say sheep but goddamn have a personality
Chris looking goood
"Where would you like to see us walk across in a day next?" - Japan ... just do it!
Great content. Thanks!
Your videos get way too many views.
The extended bear claw is a BACK SCRATCHER duh...
@9:36 “assorted dried food.”  I’m game.
Having Pete around in a video is delightful to behold
I have been watching for years and I have seen the ups and downs. But Chris, I gotta say, you look great. You set a goal for yourself and achieved it. You say you want to lose weight because people say you have put on a few pounds, but I say I wish I had teeth that are white like yours.   Coffee is not my friend.
The bear hand is a back scratcher
🤣👍👍 a thumbs up for each of you 🤣.
I'm you realized the next morning that the extending bear claw is a back scratcher. Have used mine for years.
This walk should be developed into a whole series. Very entertaining
It's incredible seeing how much you've changed in just a year. Honestly you might have to rebrand to Aslim in Japan now.
More videos with pete!
Chris, please bring Pete on more. I never comment but he’s the best and I just had to let you know 😂
real-talk: those bear brand backscratchers are legit. I buy them in bulk as stocking stuffers/last minute gifts for everyone, and I've gotten nothing but positive feedback!  also dope video.
I'm not blowing any kind of dragon.
chris and connor made me realise how much i wanted a english man
the bear hand is a back scratcher xD
Holy crap dude you look 15 years younger than you looked when I first start watching you. No shitting for reals.
do they realize that the "bear claw" is actually a back scratcher?
You guys are so awesome together!
This rekindled my plan to visit Tokyo after the last few years since everything that’s been going on. This is a lesson in not attempting it in one day!
Great content!!  I am so jealous you get to do this sort of adventure.
Your friend for a guy that says he can't string more than 2 sentences together he has an offal lot to say even when he's not talking he has his voice as a voiceover.
As a fried chicken loving American, I am totally going to get 2 Big Fried Chickens the next timeI go to Asakusa.
I was literally planning on doing this and here is a video of it
Ive done it best way to see tokyo
Mine is an extendible chicken leg and it scratches my back efficiently :)  Great video-concept.
You forgot Blackpool Tower. We all know that's the greatest tower in the world 🌎 🤣
Do a version with the night and day parts reversed, so maybe walk it backwards? Also, would love to see a loop, maybe over a week. Also maybe an interesting architecture one by broad era: Traditional, modern, etc. Or Juxtapose super busy spot next to meditative quiet spot next door.
I wish for boobs.
Pete the protoss archon
Did yall see saburo arasaka?
Looking good mate! Like a lean , mean, chicken eating machine.
that bear claw will become an indispensable item for scratching yourself. but is a little sharp for some areas ;)
i am inspired to do this when i next come to Japan. Well done guys. I always look forward to your vids.
Do more with Pete
Lookin' slimmer Chris!
🥴🥴 they walked 25km and they think that its much 🤦🤦🙄🙄😒😒  dude try a 12+ hour walking ( over 50 km )and eating stream that most small vtubers do nowadays
Your special guest premiertwo was the best cohost you’ve ever had. He’s personable, funny, and not awkward like some of the others.  Definitely bring him back!
This is a really cool video format. I really hope you do more of these. Appreciate the work you put into this!
Sexpat day
Thank god I visited Tokyo some years ago and was still able to play in the Sega building.
Chris you look the healthiest you've ever been
The extendable bear claw is actually a back scratcher. Ive had one for years and its heaven
The busiest train station in all of japan by train trafic with 4000 trains arriving and departing daily and 5000 commuters passing through it every single day 16:38  Did Chris make a mistake or does every train only average 1.25 commuters per day?
The telescopic hand is for scratching your back.
I love those backstreest ... very Blade Runner-esque. The Tokyo Tower illuminating the low cloud was a magnificent shot.
This is the day when the Japanese will always remember the day when captain Jack Sparrow walked across Tokyo.
The 'extendable bear hand" is actually a retractable back-scratcher and is quite practical
Blackpool Tower > all other towers
Chris, I love your stuff, but you eat kitkats like a goddam barbarian.
nothing but love for this channel
That last clip 😂🐻
Something something Japan, something something algorithm
chris: my goal for this year is to really focus on my health after that bad report also chris: b i g   f r i e d   c h i c k e n
Pete has great energy. This was a great video
I was really  disappointed that you didn't bring along Natsuki. Did you forget his birthday again?
Where do I get that coffee boss jacket from as that looks so cool?
Japan seems like a cool place to walk around and explore many different areas!
That's not just a pigeon, thats a Japanese Samari Pidgeon. And he will have vengeance on Pete for stepping on him.
OMG please please do this for Kyoto & Osaka!! I watched this video probably about 10x! Tysm because I'm going on a study abroad trip in May!
Absolutely loved it. Could watch this all day if I didn’t have a baby… and a job…
That mr mime is awesome
Those alleys look very cyberpunk
lol at the hobgoblin beer sign on the closing shot
That's cute souvenir from Asakusa.
Year of the Boar boys stand UP!
You should do more videos with Pete, he's such a fun guy, he makes every video better, and he can use the exposure.
Interestingly quaint adventure compared to all the other bombastic ideas from the channel, but Chris really knows how to give it the bravado of something like Journey across Japan for even the smallest ideas. Also can't get enough of Chris and Pete, these two are the perfect adventure duo
Great video! I agree with Pete's statement. The ability to go from one place to another just by walking without needing to get in a car and drive is fantastic.
coolest american.
Im with you Pete! Boar Brothers! :D
nice video! but if you think thats busy you aint been to Hong Kong lol
i wonder if someone has that SEGA sign.
Pete is quite an entertaining dude
I don’t know why but in your thumbnail you look very young. 🤷‍♂️ almost like a teenager
Regarding the urban walkability of Japan in general and Tokyo specifically, a good channel to watch that explains this urban planning phenomenon is NotJustBikes. North Americans really were swindled out of a future that was already built before the end of WW2, when motor vehicle companies complete captured the US government/state apparatus.
Gotta say, I love all of the guests, but Pete is always a blast when he's on.   Maybe it's the big goofy American in me, but y'alls chemistry is a pleasure to watch.
So funny😂😂and informing too Thk you for sharing💖
I feel like if you brought Connor, he would've tried to game the system to buy less than 2000 yen worth so he could save it for the next stop and buy something over 10000 yen in the end.
I suspect those pigeons where stream snipers.
How can Tokyo station have 4000 trains for just 5000 commuters?
I had the best turkish kebab ever from a stall in Asukusa.  No reason for this comment but thought you'd all like to know. Thanks, have a nice day :)
Was that risottero walking around in the first part with the stripy shirt? 1:45
Considering that your brain consumes the most amount of calories, I'd say that with all the chitchat and visual stimulation all the calories you consumed that day were covered <3
its Pete video. more of him and you arguing while in famous busy places pls. 😅
Loved it.  Pete is awesome! He brings so much energy to the videos.
Mr affable
One of your best vids in a while I love pete 😂
i love pete man
Pretty nice and cool walk of 25km of Exporing City of Tokyo 😁😎
I just realized that I just bought the exact same jacket Chris is wearing. Should I be worried that his style is rubbing off on me? XD
"Gigo", (sigh) if only Japan weren't so subtle.
Always a pleasure to see Pete!
This is great! Now walk North to South across Japan!
Yea
Those extendable bear paws are backscratcher.
This was a joy to watch! It was funny and informative.
Chris reusing old footage with risotoro at the temple in beginning. Got you there !
more of this please, and more of this duo
935
How do you stop for a plate of fries and a salad in the most cyberpunk looking street ever at night?? You SHOULD HAVE gotten a big bowl of ramen!!
Pete is a treasure - happy to see him every single time, loved this video
Those Boss jackets are worth some money outside of Japan, all the JDM car guys buy them.
My country's entire length (mainland) is 26 Km...... so this is very weird for me heh
Pete is such a wonderful bundle of joy and fun <3
Ryotaro cameo???
Strava it or it didn´t happen. (^_____^)v   How about you do a Zwift ride on Makuri Island, especially Neokyo and tell us how you like it there.
16:42 4000 trains and only 5000 passengers? The trains must be really empty then!
Butt-scratherrrrrrrrrr! Butt-scratherrrrrrrrrr? Butt-scratherrrrrrrrrr! (anyone get the reference?)
Now I know the context for those two guys who mentioned meeting Chris at Tokyo Tower. Forget which VOD it was in.
Awesome content, some of the best you've created.
is that Jack Black?
I kinda wish it was longer and more like a livestream. Making it a livestream is obviously dangerous but I would really like to just see you guys just walking around amazing cities and exploring it like a video game.
An episode with Pete is always a blast! His humor and personality always makes my day.
Can't believe pete's 39 I thought he was in his mid 20s he look so young
Anyone notice the ado at 0:38?
In a walking tour around Tokyo station they told me that the Tokyo station building was designed after the Amsterdam central station. So the Western influence is correct!
"...five thousand commuters passing through it every day..." - definitely not the Tokyo Station I remember
I loved it! You two made a great atmosphere in the video, and the idea alone is cool! More please!
You should do an amazing race sort of thing with the trash taste boys and their gfs across japan
One of the best Abroad in Japan videos
My wife order something and with it was a free bear scratch claw😂
I really don’t understand whats so nice with Japan, Im over here thinking America got it all while these Americans walk through Tokyo saying its so good.
American calls it fried potato, Brit calls it French fries. Oh how the tables have turned
Sick vid Chris
Yeah the same thing is happening in Switzerland all the awesome old Swiss style houses are being replaced by apartment blocks (emphasis on the block”
16:46 4000 trains passing by daily, and 5000 commuters passing through it every single day. 🤣🤣 That's almost 1.25 person per train!
Only 50 seconds into the video and I'm already very intrigued, 0:46 is a beautiful shot!, you have a great eye for composition, I appreciate your hard work in putting these vids together
I recently walked a little over 20 km by necessity, and I was BEAT after that day was over.  Then I ended up walking the next day, and the next, and eventually I just crashed, and had to spend like two days doing nothing.
Tokyo Station, Tokyo Tower and Roppongi - aren't on the Ginza line (although admittedly probably more interesting than Nihonbashi, Toranomon, Akasaka and Omote-Sando and more likely to meet viewers)
Premier who?
I miss living in Ueno so much,everyday after School I went to Asakusa and at least three times a week to akiba
Man I love Pete
You've outdone yourself this time, Chris! I love that sense of adventure this invokes. The little trivias and banter with Pete were quite enjoyable. I realize this was physically taxing but I can't help to look forward for more of this.
the first time my gf and i where in tokyo we kinda got lost and at the end of the day we walked 39km across tokyo... lets just say we needed some rest after this vacation
I want my chubby Chris back :D
You without a beard, having exercised so much look about 10 years younger! I was about to tell you to regain all your weight because you looked old as hell 😂
I really like how Tokyo is super walkable! When I was there I was averaging 40k steps per day and was able to explore the majority of the city within a week. Sure some stretches between cities (like the straight road between Shibuya and Roppongi) aren't the most exciting, but you can make it more interesting by adding a few detours to shrines or parks along the way.
Pete is the Duncan Trussell to Chris' Rogan.
Thumbnail Chris Broad looks young
But where was that taco place in Akihabara…
Seeing the Sega building gone is just tragic.  I'm glad I got to go once before closing down
01:48 is that Ryotoro? His back? I saw the next shot following him and i thought...maybe he is the guide? or Christ just drag another buddy on the trip
I think the bear claw is meant to be a back scratcher, my mom has one!
Glad to see Pete in another video. It was already said but would absolutely love to see this as a series on other cities in Japan. On my first trip to Tokyo (in 2019 for the Rugby World Cup) my partner and I walked from Nippori to Yanaka Ginza and then to Ueno and finally made it to Akihabara to watch the opening game in a Hub Pub 🙄. We were not in shape at all and I could barely walk for the rest of our trip after that. The heat didn't help but safe to say we are going to utilize trains a bit more this time around 😁. Good job Chris for doing this big walk 💪.
Chris looks good holy
Loved this.
great video and i hope this become a series in the future where you goes walking in another town of Japan, maybe you could do Osaka or Hiroshima
A walk to abondoned villages in the mountains would be good. Challenge yourself and hike around bear country in North Japan.. But with full preparation to ward of bear in case you see on upclose and personal.
I decide to go to osaka after seeing your video lol
My dad has that same extendable bear hand back home. Actually, I may have one too, somewhere. I think he gave me one, lol.
When Pete said "you want it, they got it," I thought "hah, absurd. What I want is an extendable bear hand."  Imagine my utter shock.
extendible bear hand is a backscratcher fyi
What a great video!!!
I'm always glad to see Pete
somehow chris suddenly looks visibly older?
I'm with you Pete. Also born in 83 year  the year of boar.
pete being a kof fan is a surprise to me,hell yeah pete!
9:27 - The guy vaping in the background lol
PETE IS 40?? bro doesn't look a day over 30
Man this was amazing thank you!
I bought two extendable bear hand, it's a great back scratcher... until it broke, now I can't find more of those.
Great new series!
I got the bear hand :(
Vladimir stop talking to them,press the red button and you won’t hear from them any more !!!!!!!
I know he said Senso-ji temple, but I swear it sounded like sense orgy... Which would kinda make sense, since there's so many sights, sounds and smells, etc
Wow you lost a ton of fat since I last watched you!
30:44 Monkey and mime
How far would it be to walk to the Ghibli museum? Or Kijijoji? Btw, the "extendable bear claw" is a back scratcher.
The extendable bear hand is a back scratcher.
Please replace Connor with Pete for your weekends away!
Has Chris been losing more weight since he was in LA? Maybe it's just me, but Chris seems to be looking slimmer. Good for you, Chris - hard work is paying off!!
kinda wish you time coded the time you reached each area, like what time did you start and what time did you finish?
lol Pete is great
That sounded like a bad Christian Slater impression, which to be fair sounds like a bad Jack Nicholson impression. Love ya thou Pete!
Pete! Seriously you need to get アレン・スナイダー rather than Geese. Long story - he may be named for me. 14:10
Pete & Chris need to walk Santa Monica. It has a decent British Pub & the best sushi in Los Angeles. 12:50
When you come across a fan, they might be in Japan because of your channel.
I hope you guys realise, that extendable bear hand is basically a back scratcher. I love them!!
I just realize how thin Chris has become!
Hey looking trim and healthy
I absolutely love this video where the emphasis has been put back on Japan rather than the antics you can get up to. I don't know what it is but a lot of the more recent videos felt off. Like scripted vlogs rather than spontaneously adventuring in Japan.
Would be good if you blur out peoples faces for privacy. Like your videos but fkn hate being recorded by randoms.
playing pokemon while watching this. fate smiled on me as i threw out my mime. jr right as pete bought his mr.mime lmao
Oh man i can't wait for the day i get to walk across Japan
Chris surrounds himself with the best human beings! Gotta love the positivity these guys spread wherever they go.
I noticed genshin impact on Gigo so they have my full support <3
its pretty amazing how they travelled 20 kms and visited absolute beautiful and unique places and the best you can do here in America (walking/driving the same distance) is visit the next McDonald's!
Pete, you are hilarious! I would love to have a beer with you!
Don't underestimate the bear claw back scratcher! I've had one for years and it always does the job!
When I was a study abroad student in Tokyo, I remember doing the 9km walk with some of my share house mates from Roppongi to Honancho station after a night out when the trains would shut down after midnight. This whole video was like a trip down memory lane. Thanks for the content Chris!!
Dang Chris is looking really sharp!!!  congratulations chriiis on all the workout and dedidication!!
We were there this weekend too. Will be back next weekend. I suggest, for retro games, go to Mandrake not Super Potato - it's half the price. Also, it would be totally awesome if you did a video like this in Kamakura, by where I live! It's an ancient town where the ruling seat used to be - great food and temples. Also they have a Shiba Inu and cat cafe..
All this walking and eating - where bathroom visits?
Chris seems to have lost some weight since I last saw him! Looking good!
Pete’s jacket is awesome, Chris’ method for eating KitKats is applaudable.
Interesting how you finished at Hobgoblin, the most famous Gaijin bar in western Tokyo.  Good for drinks but that rotten and sticky wood interior needs a facelift.
I still looooooove your work!🎖🎖🎖💖💖💖😎😎😎
I hear the best place to view Tokyo from a skyscraper is the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building. A tour guide made a few points to me that first of all, it's free to go to the observation decks. And second, structures like the SkyTree and Tokyo Tower are structures you'd probably want a view of than a view from.
This was a really good video thanks! Now I have some ideas for when I visit!
Not a beard hand😂 its a back scratcher haha
How about a tour of the small gardens (teien) in Japan?
Not to be critical but did Chris reuse some old footage at 01:45 with the man in the striped shirt? Lookes like Ryotoro in an earlier video to me!
Plus the empty neighborhood streets are so ingrained in Anime! Ghosts are going to pop out from the lightposts!
What's it like getting a hair cut in japan? Was it hard to find a barber at first?
Great video. Was not expecting to see my back scratcher here. I have the exact same one and it works good!
Ah, Chris...A man after my own heart! We share an affinity for Umeshu!(Plum Wine) It's my absolute favorite!
I live in the center of Tokyo but in your video Tokyo seems very attractive. I should try these touristy things.
yo chris is lookin good af. congrats on getting in shape my dude.
I actually want that boss jacket too. :P
Love this video!
I'm sure Rambalac is proud.
Did Chris ask Joey to carry his bag _just_ because he hates his whole cap that much? Absolutely. That level of pettiness is not even rare among English people.
Pete's jacket goes hard tf
Get off work get high drink some beers.. this stuff is entertaining Did enjoy the journey the sidekick was sick ...he killed it
Do they know the "extendable bear claw" is a back scratcher....?
I was in Japan in October, and realized one of my dreams - I walked the entire route of the Yamanote line, Shimbashi to Shimbashi. Took all day, not much time for sight-seeing, but why not?
Amazing video
What was the wish with Terminator drawn in it? at 12:05
Gonna be honest, I own an extendable bear hand, its a back scratcher
Hello 👋 from UK, love the video x
I'm so jealous of how walkable Tokyo is. If you tried this in Texas you'd bump into an uncrossable highway, or find a bridge that had no pedestrian access, or just notice the utter lack of sidewalks in so many places.
Pete's so fun and fine. Very charming indeed. Thanks for taking us along for this fun day trip.
The Nishinari slum in Osaka. Recommended by Sabbatical.
Hmmm first stop being a station first shot being a bus at new locations hmmm, how was the chicken?
hey Chris, just a note, at 16:46 it's over 500 thousand, not 5 thousand commuters daily.
Twenty bucks for six strawberries and a crappy key ring! Woah Right There Bald Eagle!😲
He's like Mr. Beast but in Japan
Wait, Pete's 40? I thought he was like, 27.
Petition for Pete to be in the next Journey Across Japan! Absolutely hilarious and colorful.
16:39 They modelled Tokyo station after Amsterdam Central Station. Same style of red brick building. The resemblance is uncanny, if you're familiar with Amsterdam.
Yeah.. me and my partner went to Sensoji for new year during hatsumode. It took 5 hours to walk nakamise and into the temple, the food stalls were so crowded that it was off limits, yet it was beautiful to see the crowd from above at the end of the walk and also all of the beautiful kimono people wore! I couldn’t do it again though lol my feet hurt.
wait was it always akihabara?
when i was in Tokyo 2015 i walked 35km each day, did realise it after 5 days, when the body felt a bit tired.
One of these days Chris is gonna take Garnt around the world
4000 trains and 5000 commuters? That seems wasteful xD Jk.
I enjoyed this bc this is prob what I would do if I ever got the money to fly to Japan
Cool that you pay some random hobo to carry your baggage. At least he always looks like one.
Awesome video.  I was impressed by your trek from Ueno to Shibuya.  Too bad you couldn’t walk through the Imperial palace!
I like American Pete. Please have him on more
Those are literally my wife and my backscratchers.  They work AWESOMELY.
The soundtrack to this video is slamming! Love it
This reminds me of an amazing show my roommates and I used to watch called Somewhere Street on NHK. It was clearly low-budget and the dubbing was terrible, but we found it so entertaining. This is a big upgrade, and I hope to see more!
Fuck it. Just walk across the county.
People there really love to walk , even in a big street full of people, no vehicle or anything meddling to a crowded strewt
What are the girls at 13:24 advertising? Rent a girlfriend type stuff or good ol maid caffes? Or some alabama family bonding , im confused
"It's far more precise to always express distance in femto-angstroms." ---Albert Einstein
Walking through Tokyo sounds really fun ! I’d like to try it some time as I have walked through small joints in Tennessee and South Carolina. (Though i might have to take a break at the literal 20 minute mark 😭)
Sometimes pete's voice reminds me of Sean Evans.
This brings be back to both Tokyo and Taiwan with the fried chicken. Tokyo is definitely the most walkable city I've been to, I walked at least 10km per day when I was there.
This video had a cool hangout vibe.  I loved the details of the journey.  Looking forward to more videos of this style.
Sega gone 😲 😢
Pete would make an excellent villain, should he ever get super powers. He has all the poses down.
Lol I walked 45,000 steps on my first day in Tokyo
I really thought that was Ryotaro at the start in the black and white striped t-shirt.
Top vlog, Chris! And Pete was a great companion! I love Tokyo, and I feel it has been a while since you have done a comprehensive video around neighborhoods in Tokyo like this. I was thoroughly entertained and would love to see more like this format! And hopefully you bring Pete along again!
This was the shot of serotonin that I need today! Thank you for another fantastic video!! ❤️❤️
Anybody else spy Japanese copies of "The Settlers of Catan" over Pete's shoulder in the Don Quijote store?
props to Pete for Super Potato. that's one of the first things i wanna do when i go to Akiba
Its actually amazing. I basically did this exact walk, by accident when I was there years ago. Its nostalgic to see you walk through familiar streets.
I'm only 30 seconds in and I already have to comment on how fucking great you look. Whatever you're doing, it's working perfectly and I'm immensely impressed. Not that I wasn't impressed by your stellar content and ability to entertain me for what feels like 10 years now (in a good way) already but I'm specifically impressed with your physical transformation and I hope with all of my heart that you feel as good as you look. Let your sense of self-worth be permanently boosted by all that success. Now, excuse me while I have 30 minutes of Pog content to watch :D
Pete really warms my heart with his kindness! I love the combo with Pete and Chris!
The bear claw is a back scratcher and it is amazing
There is something for my bucket list!
Such a great episode. Simple but showed so much. AND it is a dope jacket 🙌🏽
The Japanese are racist too.They hate immigrants.
Hey Chris, nice video and thanks for the great impressions of Tokyo. can you do walk across Kyoto next? I will visit Japan in November and that would be badass if you would show us more from Kyoto
What about do a cool travel video with one of your viewers/fans who is cool, interesting and funny?
Absolutely loved this! I always make sure to do just this whenever I visit a new city. Pick a start and an end point and just walk the whole day. Great way to experience a new pl
Could you do an episode where you go through Shizuoka and all the hidden gems it has!
Tokyo tower is the only one that matters.
1983 gang 👍
Nice... I did that in Osaka once.... many many years ago and also in New York when the twin towers still existed!
I have an extendable bear hand. It's marketed as a back scratcher here in the states and it works great for that purpose.
More American Peta please!
I live for these videos. It’s so amazing to see the city lights at night I’d love to go one day
I like him , you should bring him to more of your adventures !! An idea, he should bring all the things he buys to everywhere he goes :D
Squeeze on my little gorilla sack got me lol
If this isn't a great advertisement for the walkability of Japan, well at least the greater Tokyo area, Idk what is.
Pete is the most authentic, lovable, awesome person. What a great companion for a journey
pete is such a good addition to the chris aboard universe!
Pete reminds me of Charlie from its always sunny
Chris: At what point somebody thinks - I want an extendable bear hand. Me: Damn, I want it (thinking about all the times something fallen under a couch or behind a bookshelf and I wished I had an extendable bear had)
Great video excellent, What a good video I liked it.
Honestly, this would have been a great time to put out a 16h uncut video of you just walking through Tokyo. It might seem boring to you, but all the mundane sights and ambient sounds are the most immersive feelings about traveling, but no one posts them because they seem boring. Everyone wants to travel right now, but not everyone can afford it. Playing a walk through Tokyo in the background while I wfh or do my taxes would be relaxing.
That fried chicken looks like an italian "Cotoletta"!
24:27 the bear hand is to scratch your back.
O my gosh Chris you look so good congratulations on your fitness journey. It is really paying off 😊 congrats 🥳
the extendable bear arm is a back scratch-er lol
id love a second channel upload where we can see some conversation during the walks like a podcast
That bit between Roppongi and Shibuya really is creepy. I walked through it with some friends back when I was an exchange student and it was probably one of the few times I thought I might actually get mugged here lol
Thanks for all you do, We head to Japan this coming Sat Feb 4th. We will be in Kyoto, Osaka, Matsuyama, Yokohama area
Chris Pete combo too good
Tokyo Station’s architecture was inspired by Amsterdam Central Station, just in case anybody wants to know 😀
Pete is the true golden retriever energy
every video of your is one step for me getting to japan haha
This is the content I want to see. This and responding with British edginess to rude comments 😤
Not gonna lie, thought that was Ryotaro at 1:51
Thanks very much for this Chris! My family and I are visiting Japan for the first time on the first week of April. We are staying at the Asakusa View Hotel and I was wondering what walking around and south towards Akihabara and beyond was going to be like! Can't wait! Much love health and happiness to you from sunny (not really) New Jersey, USA!
Chris you're looking amazing! Neck definition from every angle! You've inspired me and my partner to do the 3 peaks challenge in the UK this year
Though an extendable bear hand sounds super useful in general, it's a back scratcher.  I don't think I could sleep at night if you missed out on the wonders of having a metal bear paw scratch your back for you, lol.  Great video!
Tried walking 25km ? Is that supposed to be hard? The average human walks between 4 and 5 km/h, so 5-6 hours and done... I though you were in shape Chris.
oh no. don't tell me you deleted the footage of you walking through Tokyo... there are literally channels dedicated to filming while walking (with no talking though)
9:41 lmaoooooo Pete is funny
Roppongi is fine as long as you keep your wits about you.
Yo just wanted to say you're looking great, Chris.
And I'm sitting here trying to figure out how to get 25km out of this route. I can only see 13km on Google Maps.
Hmm, I wonder if I missed anything. How come Pete is now the third best American friend? Lol
Brilliant. Well done.
i love the videos of you with connor and pete and you 3 together is just legendary XD
Idk if it's just his fitness routine showing results or just Chris being himself but he's way less Cynical than before. Maybe Cynical Chris(you do see it in some parts in this video but it's become noticeably sparse) is just a persona for his more scripted (read as well written) videos or maybe improving his health has given him a better outlook but ngl I kinda like this more casual Chris
I can't get over how good you look. Congratulations man, must feel great!
I always walked around tokyo when i visited japan. A lot of people though i was crazy because why walk when you can take the subway or train. But you discover so much more and as an added benefit food tastes absolutely amazing after 20km.
Pete is such an amazing human, every single time he's in a video it just makes it 1000% better. No offense to Connor or any of the other boys, but i'm part of the Pete gang.
24:26 thats a back scratcher XD i know because i own one edit: it also doubles as a bottle opener
0:39 i hear uta there :3
I loved the night time cinematography!
the more content i see of japan the less i wanna go there, most overrated country and asians hate europeans, why would i go there
Just saw this video was 30min. Didn't even notice. Just  enjoyed watching you.
Chris: "These videos aren't scripted." Peter: " *_I--simply--cannot--wait---to--eat--this--strawberry--stick--I--am--purchasing--of--my--own--free--will!_* "
Such a charming  video. Love you guys!
If you like walking in Tokyo, there's a really good book called Tokyo Maze: 42 Walks in and Around the Japanese Capital. I did a few of the walks back in 2019 and it was really fun! I have a really soft spot for Asakusa because it's where I've stayed so many times in cheap hostels. I know the streets well.
End part, pete" Take ma strong hand", 🤣
I love Asakusa, if nothing else, for the incredible dichotomy of having an old, traditional temple in the middle of the world's largest, most populated mega city. It's like something out of a cyberpunk world
Peter really gives me voice actor vibes!
Aww Pete is a pig!! :) My brother and mother are too.. they are both sweety pies with a soft heart.
[ 24:25 ] -  It's a back scratcher. I have one here on my desk. Mine has a human hand though. I wish I had the bear version 😁
Third best friend?
Premier Who? Lol love Pete!
Extendable Bear Paw is for hard to reach itches, such as your back.
It's like Keezi Walks but with commentary. Im liking this
idk what pete is complaining about, with his appendix out he's now lighter and faster! Pete SL!!!
16:42 Wow I can't believe they run 4000 trains for 5000 people!
Congrats guys. You walked longer than a 1/2 marathon.
Sending a crisp high-five from the middle of the Midwest to Pete. Glad he's ripping our home city in Japan~
I can't believe he chose a Mega Highball when there were world class whiskeys right in front of him...
Damn Chris, you're looking super skinny. The fried chicken is deserved! ;)
I dunno what you guys are on about, I saw the Bear Claw at a Giant Tiger (Canadian discount shop) like ten years ago and I've been using it ever since! It's the best cure for bra strap itch for sure.
Pete is cool, have him in more videos.
I always look forward to your videos and somehow I missed this one by two days😭... I laughed and I thank you for that💁‍♂️🙌👏🙌👏
I use that back scratcher and its great!
Pete found his twin at 14:52 😂
Pete becomes the hero we need!
Fellow boar here, we pay in full! Awesome video, really cool just seeing what's around. Sharing it with American Pete is a bonus. I agree with Pete on the walking over cars, here we don't even have sidewalks we have to drive everywhere.
I loved this Chris! I miss Tokyo so living it through your eyes is great.
I've just gotten into walking around my own city, we just moved somewhere that shops are actually walking distance, so this is perfect timing! You should totally keep this up as a series
Hi Chris , I’m planning on a trip to Japan for a month long trip wonder what time of the year you would recommend, also do you think it’s worth hiring a personal translator for the trip? Love your content thank you
Damn I used to walk a similar route sometimes from Shibuya back to Ueno when the trains weren't running anymore, brings some memories back. Love your videos!
3:00 Excuse me??? Look at that symbol they have on these things.
great video!
good stuff as always, pete is cool.
Japan is a quite environment conscientious country, but then all of y'all support one of the worst companies in the world Nestle by buying millions of stupidly flavored kitkats. Sigh
Isn't the big fried chicken just a Schnitzel?
Connor let's go to a love hotel ryotaro let's go to a hot springs natsuki let's go to the beach joey let's go to sea  Pete let's go for a walk I wonder if Chris will ask garn to go with him to a cemetery what a great idea lol
Aaaah Pete is back!! He's my fav side character in your channel so far!
26:39 lol that handshake and the bow ather that :)
I absolutely loved this video.  I lived in Tokyo for a year back in 2009-2010 and loved it so much.  Just seeing you walking the streets was so nostalgic.  And I'm glad to see Ameyoko!  I feel like it's often overlooked but was always one of my favorite places to visit.
I remember your shinjuki kitkat sushi video, it has the same vibes
Isnt it cold in japan at this time off year?
chriss just saying to continue your fitness journey because you looking thin and good
haha the catch 22 here's $20 everywhere  but you have to carry it haha
I have the extendable bear claw and it is a splendid back scratcher!
Pete is too Jack Black and that is why you two skipped posh streets of Aoyama and Harajuku straight to Shibuya
Wonderful seeing fans who've watched for so long. If I could afford a trip over you better believe me I'm gonna find you too! Hahaha 😎👍😇
Loving this video and agree with others that this would make a great series. I also have to say the bear claw back scratcher is a good choice haha 😂 you will always be able to scratch that unreachable itch 🐻 always enjoy watching videos with Pete in 😁
I would love more of these "Walking Across..." videos. I think it would be cool too see some of the boring walking to tie it all together. Without it, the "walking" part feels missing.
1983 Pete!! 👏
When I was there, I also walked 26km. So much to see! Love Tokyo
Pete rules.
Loved this video! And more Pete please!
This was pretty cool!! And Pete is a good partner in crime lol
My first comment after years of subscription. The background music in this video is amazing!
the Gorilla is something for Connor....his reaction would be funny :D
i really enjoyed this video make more   and can´t you make like maybe a series where you visit diffrent abandoned building places around japan, i think that would be really interessting :)
Wasn't the first guy at the temple with the stripes Ryotaro? At 1:46
1983 too! We will turn 40 this year Pete🙏
The bear claw is a back scratcher, I have one and felt personally attacked by the ridicule I faced
Sigh. In the old days in the US Army, from 1960 or so until MRE's came in, the C-ration was king. And among its many delights were disks of chocolate, with little bits of crunchy nougat in. They were actually pretty good, and known as "John Wayne Bars" for some reason, as they were not bars, but disks. And the rest of the story is, the chocolate was the very exact same as the chocolate in original Kit-Kats. So when you bite into an original Kit-Kat, you are literally tasting the US military-industrial complex.
Pete has become Chris's butler.
Fun Fact: The guy pictured in the Boss logo is none other than William Faulkner, noted American writer. No shit.
The bear hand is a back scratcher! Haha
27:15 this is really funny to me cause I went on my first date with the girl I'm dating in this spot. We held hands right there and then went to the park that's down below and made out when no one was looking 😂😂😂
spending my first visit in japan with pete's looks fun, hoping i can meet him on my first visit
I've done that exact walk... miss Tokyo
I love this ❤❤❤❤ Chanel
1983 represent!
GIGO, garbage in garbage out
GIGO is, of course, old programmer-speak for "Garbage In, Garbage Out" this dates back to the days of huge hulking IBM mainframes.
Is this a new series wacky walking with the other guy
i used to ride a bike pretty much following that exact route (asakusu to shinjuku) back and forth every day and i didnt lose any weight at all  lol
Definitely need to do this again!
Pete's got awesome energy. I'd spend a day with him any time >_<
Waiting for the fanart of Pete and his Mr. Mime to roll in.
You gotta do Osaka next. I did a long walk a few years ago from Machida to Tokyo Station. Took all day, but I made it. This video is basically a walking journey of the stops I take during the week. My jobs office is right in front of the tallest the tallest building in Japan ( in the Roppongi Azabu-dai area ). Nice that the video ends in Hobgoblin, where many people end up in Shibuya.
This has been an absolute cracker of a video. 1st, Pete is the most lively ever. Clearly previous videos have hidden his talent. 2nd, It reminds me a lot of the aimless, on foot exploration I'd do in a previous life when I travelled a lot for work (inc Tokyo).  Agree with another commentator that this would make a great series. A good juxtaposition against the wacky weekend series. "Setting the pace with Pete"? "Pavement pounding with Pete"? Something like that.  Also, just an observation, but you are taking to fans/visitors a lot differently (more positive) than you used to. The video during Hokkaido Ice Sculpture festival comes to mind. Maybe you are just generally happier and this is a result of that. In any case, great to see you enjoying yourself still after all this time on YT
Where can I listen to the music you played in this video? Great walking music!
Next video:  Walk to the 3D cat
Think we need an ongoing series like Wacky Weekend (and Taken For Garnted when it happens). Call it For Pete's Sake or something
Brilliant video!
Kind of sad that I didn't see you. I head back to Australia tomorrow, and I was probably in Tokyo at the same time you were filming this.  Would have been cool to see you after watching you for what, ten years, now? Anyway, good job on the walk across Tokyo 💪
I have the extendable bear claw sitting at my desk and also one at my work desk in the office, they are excellent back scratchers, I highly recommend them.
weak rabbit man from rabbit people island HAHAHA!
24:36 I actually have one of those "extendable bear hands" and it's the best back scratcher I've ever owned.
You should have called it journey across Tokyo
Both of you be looking SUAVE~
I need to try Sake Kitkats now.
GIGO literally means Garbage In Garbage Out 🤣
That's a  real slim shady if I ever saw one.
i enjoy watching pete in your videos! i hope to see more of him as well ❤
the chemistry between these 2 is impeccable, a grumpy cat and a golden retriever
Should gigo go died though.. Bring back Seeegggaaaa
You know the funny thing? BLOW is actually a chain of “casinos” you would have found one in Shibuya too 😂
Gross nestle products in japan strokes me the wrong way… One of the most refined and clever cultures when it come to food chooses to eat this absolute cancer causing, land ruining garbage… And I further hate westerners having an influence on Japan when it comes to food…
"Maybe a bit too big" - being in a relationship has changed him 😥
I once walked from Adachi all the way to the Yotsuya area of Chiyoda as a personal challenge. I think it took me around 3 - 4 hours. Pretty fun but it was soo fun ngl
Praise be! The drought of new content has ended! Let us give thanks!
has this been rereleased?
i get to be your pack mule?!?  a stylish pack mule!
Great video Chris! It’s really cool to see exactly how close everything in Tokyo is. Pete was a phenomenal addition. Loved all his antics on figuring out how to spend “his” money.
Now walk through Detroit.
Next time bring a backpack that is closable in the front. Destributes the weight more evenly. Easier to carry. Better for your health too, but who cares about health
and that is how you spent 2000 Yen in Asakusa 😂😂
Okay but Pete is so cute ❤
04:50 Nice StarCraft reference my dude! 21:50 Also Tokyo tower is of course a 1000x better than the Eiffel tower. A lot less beggars, robbers, scammers, French...
16:01 yohoho he took a bite of Gum Gum.
You sound like you are imitating Alan Whicker and Whickers Workd!
As a german 3:01 is very sus
0:46 looks like a film set. Absolutely amazing.
I walked once though Barcelona 28km in one day, whish I could have recorded the whole thing.
I would _definitely_ be up for pancakes with Pete in a maid outfit.
i bought one of those 8 bear hands...
The Extendu Bear Claw is a back scratcher. I have something similar and it's great, I can scratch my back anywhere all day. Sometimes I do. The emails from HR are starting to pile up though.
Elon Musk?
This was just pure enjoyment! Thank you Chris for the video and the other twitch streamer (jk Pete is da best). Videos like these with more people would be sick!
When showing the point of where the Sega building was. Footage of Nintendos Mario appears. 🤔. Regardless one of the best "Visting Tokoyo" and "Aboard in Japan" videos. Informative, funny as always with 3rd best mate American mate Peter!
27:14 It's nice to know Connor was able to meet up with them in Roppongi
Glad to see there is another proud owner of a ''Bearclaw' around. Although mine was bought in Australia....lol.. 😜
Reasonably funny ! 📹
As a fellow 1983/year of the Boar kid I am with you Pete!  Really enjoyed the video :D
These unscripted videos really give you a sense of actually being there.  Another great video Chris.
25km please, did 34km in San Francisco
25:24 it's a back scratcher.
Chris, you looked younger on the thumbnail. I thought this was an old video
Yay my favorite YouTube presenter is back!
Haha I did this aswell when I was there with my mate, we just wanted to see what you would miss if you just take the metro everywhere. We had a blast walking across all these niche little things that you would have missed otherwise
Hey, I have that bear hand back scratcher! It came as a bonus gift with something else I bought on Amazon, but it works great. 😁
Just came home from Tokyo and it is such a bad city for my adhd bc I was walking for HOURS bc I kept getting sidetracked and kept walking and then it was dark and I had to walk back to Nezu 🙄✋️
Great journey but u didn't Climb over hills or Run thru forests with temples on the way...
Kitkat Sake are ❤
I need Pete's jacket. Links of anyone knows
I love anything with Premier Pete (and Chris) in it, but I'm in the minority on this one.  I was hoping they would maybe go to a lesser known route / areas through Tokyo. Asakusa, Akihabara, Shibuya etc has been done to death by youtubers and the horse is well flogged (but I loved seeing Shimbashi as I feel it's an under rated part of Tokyo. I stayed there a few months back and it was awesome!) I know Chris just as much as anyone tries for people to get out and see the real suburbs and towns, but between TC, every other J-Vlogger and first time visitor to Tokyo there must be at least 8 million vids on those suburbs. Chuo Line would've been cool from Kichijoji to Shinjuku...I would love to see a walk between you guys somewhere like maybe Nagoya (which isn't a boring city at all lol). P.S. where do I get that sick BOSS jacket!?
I would pay good money to have dinner with Pete while he wore a maid outfit!! LOL
I do like the way Chris skimped out and didn't give Pete his 20k Yen @ Tokyo station Also I want one of those bear claw back scratches.
Apart from the swearing, it was a pretty cool journey.
where did the extra 10 km come from? totally not stalking you
GIGO = Garbage In Garbage Out
The hand at the end was hilarious 😄
After learning Pete's age and seeing how he is as a person and how he behaves, my life goal is to be so happy and positive at that age because i certainly aint close that happy now
Loved this hope to see more !! I just wished it was longer and less edited and more relaxed~ i love watching these types of videos where people walk around and explore their surroundings its so peaceful to me and cozy. I honestly wouldnt mind if it was even an hour i just hope to see more ❤❤
18:55 holy, I hadn't realized how much more fit you have become in such a short time.
Peter is more affable than the man himself
"👍EASY UP👍"....Pete's now has a new catchphrase. Make the t-shirt. 😉
😂💙👏
That bear claw might be a back scracher. Hence the extensibility.
I have one of those bear paw back scratchers and it's amazing. No shame
I once walked from Ueno to Harajaku
Hey. I'm planning to Visit Japan in April(during Cherry blossom season? But now since COVID cases are increasing, I'm a bit skeptical. Could you please let me know the real situation of COVID there and also please suggest if it is safe for tourists to visit Japan now. Thanks in Advance
Someone tell him thats a back scratcher!!!! (The extendable bear claw)
Brings back memories.
16:47 5000 commuters per day seems... quite low does it not?
I was born in '95 which is still the year of the Boar if, I am correct so... Woo!! Boar squad!
I think was the first time I ever heard Chris be verbally kind to a friend when he called Pete awesome, it’s usually just insults. It actually melted my heart a bit to hear!
Love this video. Thanks for introducing the whisky stall at Ameyoko, that was not there when I was in Ameyoko in 2020. Also the Boss jacket is a must until this day. The auction prices are crazy
Fried chicken and then sugar-covered strawberry. You guys are so unhealthy
I can't wait to save up to visit Japan.
IT'S A BEAR PAW BACK SCRATCHER!
Can you tell me why there's no trash cans in Tokyo
Did you visit the orange Temple yet
I am an old Korean lady aged at 67  who went to Japan to study in 1978 ~ .   Traveled other regions in Japan many times but Tokyo. Last July to August when  stepping on the land, felt something unexplained about Tokyo. I couldn't visit  much places to where I had been 44 years ago because  the COVID 19. I will definitely revisit some other time. Thanks for this video.
What is it May 4th boys day when everyone goes on vacation visits temples
Have you run across PewDiePie yet
pete is great! more videos with pete!
15:36 imagine getting rid of Love Live girls...
Have done that walk previously, staying in Ginza so did it over 2 days
Pete has the distant profile of Pedro Pascal and the smile of Christian Bale
love pete
Thought you were walking behind Ryotaro for a moment there at @1:45
A walk to remember
I did a similar route once. I started from the Sky Tree, and went Asakusa, Ueno, Akiba, Kanda, Tokyo Station, Ginza and lastly Tokyo Tower, back in 2017. Some streets were so empty, while the parallel streets were crowded. It was interesting. Walking around like that, you can always meet interesting people, and you don't need to  be a famous youtuber. ;)
I loved this video! It's amazing to see how different Tokyo is compared to American cities, especially in terms of walkability. I would love to see you make a series out of this type of content :D Please keep up the amazing work!
20:55 Oh hey that guy looks like- oh...
I'm with you Pete, '83 boars ftw!
Chris says f*ck at 27:21
Pete why are you wearing JEANS or better yet HOW 😂
Pretty sure the bear claw is to help you scratch your back
Asakusa is a tourist trap all right 😅 undeniably impressive looking but I prefer the quieter places with less people.
Adventures with American Pete!
25:50 I really love Japanglish 🤣
So glad to finally see Chris back. Was missing out on the content so much.
Fun Fact: The guys at 22:25 appeared again in Connor's stream with Pete, Robcdee, and Garnt but no one believed that Pete had seen them before.
Who's gonna tell him the extendable bear claw is a back scratcher
This was fun!
You didn't find the male bra at Don Quixote! Nooo!!!
Damn that area in shinbashi you guys went to look sick at night
The extendable bear claw is a back scratcher. Lol. They sell like crazy in the southeast region of the US.
Your nighttime footage is beautiful 📷
I want to see a video of you on the beach this summer! - at least for a segment. "Best Beach In Japan". Enter a sandcastle building competition. Get right drunk. Something beach related.
Yup thats definetly ryoutaro in 1:45 confirmed in 6:15 same shirt
One of my favorite videos to date! This video had such a nice vibe. The music was on point as well!
Ok is it me or is this 1:47 definetly ryoutaro the hairline the way he walks why does it look so much like ryoutaro
A great idea for walking around Tokyo. Back when I was living in Tokyo for the first time, I used underground train so much that I lost the bearing. So, one day me and my mate started walking from shinjuku to shibuya. very satisfying that I can see it all connected. I would love to see more of this series. and there should be uncut version just to see the 'on the ground' atmosphere of typical japanese street and shop.  anyway, I like the ending shot. Pete, apparently non-scripted, happened to buy 2 very appropriate things representing himself (mr.mind) and a grumpy gorilla LOL.
Lolz, guys… the bear claw is a back scratcher
Who is this skinny dude hosting Abroad In Japan now???
This video makes me so happy. I am coming to Tokyo in a few weeks and hope to duplicate similar walking trips many times over 🎉 there’s nothing like a konbini beer and a nighttime walk through Tokyo with your buds
The bear hand is a back scratcher. It extends so you can get those hard-to-reach spots lol
Scripted! Those birds are paid actors. Fantastic video, love Japan~
0:23 GENSHIN Impact! :D
1:45 is that a Ryotaro I see... XD
I wanna have friends like Pete and Chris. 🥰
Chris you’re looking healthy as fuck, looks good on you 🎉
You know there was also a trio of kids that also walked around Tokyo…
Love Pete and the Who Wants To Be a Millionaire edit!
A wretched hove of scum and villainy🤣🤣🤣 gotta love pete for petes sale also.
"typical japanese dinner" 🤣
The bear claw is a back scratcher.
Does anyone know which street it is at @20:52
Man I want to visit Japan so badly
Chris, fantastic cinematography, as always!
THE BEAR PAW! It's a back scratcher!! I have one and it's the best back scratcher I've ever tried 😂
God I adore American Pete. Always a great episode with his inclusion
ピーターさん好き
Pete’s ultimate nemesis: pigeons that he accidentally nearly killed
めっちや面白かったー！ 次作まってます！
Pete's great haha
You need to meet up with @StrayBob if you like walking adventures!!!
This was a really fun video! From the giant fried chicken breakfast to the bear claw, enjoyable all the way, and the 2,000-yen gimmick was brilliant. Did think we'd see nichome, but you can't have everything.
This just makes me want to get back to Japan so badly.
Hey Chris. With a fitness series you would easily get another 2 mio subscribers 😁. Keep on rocking/walking .👍🍻🏋️
Did you know you can save more by switching to GiGO?
"when you come here, you feel a mixture of emotions-" *Pete scratches Chris' head with a bear scratcher*
Oh, the hobgoblin lol! The lamest pub from the zero years
Wow! You have lost a tonne of weight Chris. I can see your chiseled and rugged good looks now 🙂
lol the extendable bear claw is a back scratcher. Walmart gets them at Christmas time as a stocking stuffer? Coworker gift? I honestly don't know
No more Nakagin Capsule Tower :(
No more SEGA building in Akihabara :(
Wow! that was a great video!
Pete the American
I like Pete better than Connor. Please do more videos with him.
I thought you died of cardiac arrest after the chess box fight , or something. Good to see you , champ.
16:40, Fivehundred thousand, surely? :D
Congratulations to Ironmouse in Japan for losing weight and staying healthy
Chris looks good these days
Yes this is what I wanted for viewing tonight.  The random videos are always the best! Also..get another drinking stream om the go with pete and connor and natski lol
13:24 what does the sign, this girl holds say?
Pete knows what's up with KOF
I agree with Pete. I love how walkable Tokyo streets are. Thanks for another nice video!
That part in the end was so cute though
I dont usually comment on videoes but this is one of the better ones I have watched by you lately! Theres a charm to the spontanity that happens when you travel, and you captured it in a great way in this video!
Lol I bought that extendable bear claw in Florida and used it all the time
I walked Rome in a day and it was bloody fantastic!!
Pete is awesome. Always look forward to seeing him with Connor and Chris
The Bear Hand is for scratching your own back btw 🤣
One of my favorite memories from any of my trips to Tokyo was going down to Meguro River park for the blossoms and then walking all the way back up to Shinjuku.  Didn't realize we were in the Shibuya Crossing until the actual crossing started.
Chris fans only come out at night 😂
You do know that bear claw is a back scratcher, right?  .... *they know it's a back scratcher right?*...
I know that you had to edit it to make it a cohesive video, but man, i would've loved an 8-hour slow walk through Tokyo too.
Used to walk all over Tokyo all the time back in the 80s... That's without any gadgets... Just a rough yamanote sen map and the generosity of Japanese people. Even in sweltering summer...  Honestly, I have no idea how I did it.
ahhh man ive walked all over those streets in just 3 months when i studied abroad. best time ever takes me back! i would just walk to save on train fares and play pokemon go and explore ahhhh i wish i could go back!!
Walking around aimlessly in Tokyo is one of the best experiences you can have there, especially when you do so at nighttime.
I think I'm in love with Pete
Super fun, laidback vibe to this one. And no less informative as a result! Banger vid, Chris.
After all the content you've made lately taking us (and yourself) outside the usual comfort zone, this was really nice to see retouching on some touristy things. I know you've covered many times prior but always nice to see them re-visited.   Makes me really excited to get back to Japan at the end of this year after nearly 4 years since my last trip & I can't wait :D
i'm so happy you featured me in your video at 15:37 chris, it's a big honour
Really enjoyed this video! idk just something about the vibe I really dig.
This pete guy, sux
Ryotaro cameo at 01:45 👍😂  Pete is 40 this year ??😲
Yes please make this a series chris! Several walking challenges throughout the year culminating in the ULTIMATE walking challenge of the 88 temple pilgrimage of Shikoku. That one takes over a month to do. Do it all on foot and get your stamps at every temple!! Would absolutely love to see that and then turn that into a blue ray film you can sell! Would definitely buy!
This was awesome! You two crack me up! Very fun to watch! 🤣😆👍🏻
What actually is a Japanese Salary man. What is the definition
PETE!!!!!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, instant favourite guest Pete the Archon
its only been a few years (5) since i last went to japan and Sega has turned into GiGO...sad
Ain't no time for kanpai, Pete!
Any video with Pete in it is an instant W !
The Bear Hand is a Back Scratcher
When Bill Murray said 'It's Suntory time', I don't think he meant from a tankard on a busy street
I lived in Japan for several years as a kid (military kid) and I can tell you the street food is delicious. We rarely went to Tokyo but even the smaller cities and festivals had wonderful food. Really miss the sweet potatoes and warm chestnuts from the carts on a cold winter day. I just miss Japan in general tho I’m sure it’s changed a lot since the great 70s !
I have one of those extendable bear hands, bought it in the Smokey Mountains, which are known for their black bears.
Someone's lost some weight! Looking good man 👍
Can we have a video with suggestions for families with kids (8-14) regarding what to visit in Japan? Maybe the best adventure parks? Our family is planning to travel to Japan for a few weeks and would love to see if you have any special advice for families. Thank you, we love your show!
I enjoy the walk, great job guys!
Going to need a walkthrough of Kyoto next! (Bonus points for a Nara follow-up.)
I’d like to see them do a golden mile. One pint of beer in 12 different bars. 😂
I loved king of fighter thought out of the old one 97 was the best
Fun fact - if you run, you could have covered those 25k in ~3 hours. I am also wondering if Pete is going to use gorilla hand back scratcher during his twitch streams...
I was lucky enough to get into the country the day after tourist visas weren't required.  First time I've seen one of these videos feature a place I've seen in person.  We had a hotel less than 5 minute's walk from Sensoji temple and I'd give a lot to relive those days.
As someone who's travelling to Japan in April, this video is exactly what I needed to get pumped up for my trip.
Pete should DM me :)
I actually did this (or atleast most of it) when I was on holiday in Japan and then got a foot massage after and it was magestical.
Pete is wonderfully wholesome.
Who wouldn't pay 100$ for a day with Pete, the American Friend we don't deserve?! I watched lots of Tanuki, bottlehead/relit, Yoshimi to also appreciate the efforts of IRL streamers, walking for 6h through Ikebukero, Akiba, Shibuya, Ueno etc (and they carry their own backpack XD). Tokyo is freaking vaste.  And I'd say Yay! to a city walking series where Pete can spend 2000¥ 'freely' at each stop
I just watched the whole video while walking on the treadmill. What a journey!🗼
Who is this slim handsome man? And where is Chris?
The "Includes paid promotion" won't leave the top left corner of my screen, does anyone else have the same problem?
Wow! Another boring video!
The extendable bear claw is a back scratcher and they’re found in like every souvenir shop in Canada😅
can't believe Pete would do that to Connor 27:16
Great Video. Posh Brit meets mad yank. Want to live in Tokyo even more than ever.  👍
16:46 "...And 5000 commuters passing through it..." Something tells me he meant to say 5-million.
Pete's always got crazy good charisma! Nice going boys !
Mr. MIIIIME!
Extendable Bear Claw = Weird but ultimate back scratcher
Been watching you for years and can honestly say this is one of your best videos, ever !
The side-eye at 2:12 is hilarious 😂
Pete and Chris, the dream team! More of these please 👌
Something you missed in your walk, between Ueno and Akihabara, there is a huge street dedicated to kitchen/chef supplies. If you love cooking it is a 100% must go area.
PETE !!!
Be honest, you just needed a reason so you can eat all day long.
Chris is the first person i see taking such a big walk to burn calories while at the same time consuming the double amount of calories he burned. Cheers for that cholesterol! Nice video as always
I loved the wasabi kitkats. I dream about them. Great video Chris!
16:46 5k commuters everyday? Isn't that bit too few?
If someone takes Chris for a walk is it "Walking Abroad in Japan"?
pete blink twice if chris has a knife on him
would u consider a video where you walk across the entire world? pogchamp?
anyone else notice the swastikas on the incense sticks at the urn??
I'd love to make that trip especially with the 2000 yen district spending. Bit of walking and getting hungry so you get to eat and drink constantly!
Suntory Whiskey reminds me of something!! 😆😂🤣
Last time I was in Japan, my friends and I were in Harajuku on the weekend before Halloween. We decided to walk from Harajuku to Shibuya to check out the festivities if any.  It was fun seeing all the shops along the way and how it slowly showed more and more people that were dressed up for Halloween.
Wow that other dude is so irritating
Oh hell yeah
I put this video off cause I thought it was an older video lol. Chris looks younger in the thumbnail
Is Pete okay? Is he sleeping well?
Thank you! I relived my stay in Tokyo. I miss Tokyo.
2k Yen is $15.35. Pete got ripped lollllllllllllllll
I own one of the eight extendable bear-hand back scratchers. Word of warning to Pete - it hurts. The claws are so sharp, it can draw blood. Be warned.
It is amazing how charismatic Pete is
To be very genuine with you, Japan has been truly on my list to visit, but mainly experience the incredible and inspiring culture. So being able to experience a bit of Japan, at least like this, makes the time shorter. I already started making plans for how to make this work. A big thank you is because of your videos, which have been a great aspiration to finally start making these steps towards it. Thank you again and sending you much love.
Large US cities do have something that Japanese cities appear to lack---lots of garbage.
I hate when chris talks about calories
2k yen is only 20$?
Great idea for a series! Would love to see one about Kyoto!
Very good video and video idea! Please do this more
Damn Chris looks thinner in the thumbnail
Don't worry Pete, you've got some 1983 backup!
Please do another one on Kyoto and Osaka
Pete such a GIGACHAD
Great video! Also, it's quite impressive to walk 25km in a day.
wish you put some time stamps so we know what time it is
I remember doing an evening walk from Shinagawa all the way to Shinjuku on the last night I was in Tokyo for a trip and it's gotta one of my favorite moments just being able to walk around tight little neighborhoods, grab a beer, walk some more, check out cool photography spots. Tokyo is a wonderful place to walk around at night.
Only 5000 commuters a day in tokyo station? That doesn't seem right, especially not for 4000 trains.
Did you get a black diffusion filter for your camera lens? If so, the haze around lights look very nice during the night.
Back alleys are the greatest thing about Japanese cities.
Arigatouuuu chris and pete
power overwhelming Cx
PETE!!!!! YESS more PETE!! Guaranteed view and like for me.
The bear claw is a macho back-scatcher!
Could Pete get any sweeter? What a cutie.
More Pete in your videos please!!!!!! 💜💜💜💜
I LOVE PETE SO MUCH!!! i've been laughing for the entire video so far. thank you
Loved this man! Honestly, when I visited Japan walking was the BEST way for me to see things. That, and my skateboard which I both recommend and don't recommend depending on how much you value your life.
More videos like this! Absolutely fantastic.
Really enjoyed this 👍
Love u, Chris  great content, man  KEEP GOING
From a distance, Tokyo Station looks more like a university than a train station.
Is that a lil' Waveshaper's "CRT Days" I'm hearing at 21:58? Good video, good choice in music, and American Pete seems like an utter delight!
I wonder if they know the bear claw is a back scratcher 😂
Nice haircut! You look 50% less twat now 😉
Everyone needs a Pete in their lives
The kitkat hurt and then you called me out.
You get a like just for eating the Kit-Kats whole. The rest of the video was great too.
CDAWG - Here's 500 dollars for crane games in this tiny building, most of which you will waste on failure.  Chris - Here's 20 bucks for an entire section of the biggest city on earth, now carry my camera equipment!
1:50 Is that Ryotoro? The black and white striped T- shirt guy?????
おかえり, hope you had a good time!
Chris seemed so annoyed at the fan at the start lol
Pete is delightful with a good demeanor. Bring him back with a better job next time. 😸✌🏻
Yes, now walk around Tokyo on a rainy day.
Thanks, i just did part of this walk, from Asakusa to Roppongi just tonight.
16:28 isn't that the old station? Or am I confusing it with something else (or is the footage just old)
Did this everyday when I was in Tokyo for two weeks loved walking around the city, will say he was pretty slow lol.
An impressive day's worth of exploring! This looked like a tiring but fun time.
Another awesome video, Chris! And I'm not fooled...Pete's dad may have been burning incense, but he was smoking something with it. Nice one, Pete's Dad!  FYI: extendable "claws" are for back scratching. you're welcome.😁😇
"What's up? today we are gonna be walking around... IN JAPAN?!?!?"
Every video Pete is in, I love him even more. He's such a natural force of happiness and he's always funny.
Loved the video and seeing you go through places I was able to visit and walk through last November; I can't wait to return to Japan!
As a haikyuu stan, i gotta say... the best towers in tokyo is the transmission towers
Very awesome video! It was a Unique and fun way to see part of Japan like this and you guys are too funny 👍🏻❤️🇯🇵
i loooooove these kind of touring video, the riding across or walk across series make me feel like me myslf really touring with you guys
I love Pete's energy 🙏
Been watching a lot of cat videos on Tiktok involving this bear hand thing as a scratcher recently :)
I Miss Tokyo :(
You look better Chris, not so fat anymore
2000 yen every time he enters a district!? Call him Mr.Least
Is it me or does Chris's face seem more defined
dont insult the extendable bear claw that makes a great back scratcher lmao
I think I can live with death, misfortune and disappointment 👐
my grandparents live in greater tokyo
those are back scratcher
Walk across Japan. Has a nice ring to it. I would wait until it warms up in Japan but that would be great.
Tokyo is so beautiful. One of my dreams is to visit this city like Chris does but I guess it will remain as a dream only.
Great inspiration for my trip this year😊 how about Sendai next? Then Osaka and further on? 😊
Pete is precious. Protect Pete at all costs.  Paid in full.
i have been waiting for over a month now  to watch a traditional Abrod in japan video and here it is and i m very thankful for the content, hope we will see more of it ( by the way i think you should stop eating that much in one vid, just kidding😁)
Finally another video love the vids keep it up
you look visibly slimmer, looking great chris.
I'm in Tokyo now (back after 39 months of COVID exile 😩). Let's see if I bump into Mr Affable himself.
I must say mr mime is rather chatty 😊
They guy they met in Roppongi sounds more English than Chris! Oh my dayzz!
Pffft walk hachioji to katsushika  Not even close dude
I am usually really good at guessing peoples ages but no way in hell would i have guess Pete were 40.
that "bear claw" you found in don Quixote is a back scratcher... i actually own one lol.
more like this please
I think what he keeps implying people saying the series is scripted is the way Chris likes to dramatize his expressions and acting his intros etc. Not neccesesarily the what's happening in the vidoes, but just the performance he plays on screen.  I think a good example is the vcontrast between how he acts on stream and on video, seeing as Chris is such a performer, he plays it up for the videos but lays back on stream.
The extending fingers you found at DQ is supposed to be used to scratch your itchy back lol
When I was extremely poor I walked 30km for my birth certificate at 3am 💀 I don’t think my feet have recovered 5 years later
1:46 Is that...! Ryotaro??? The mythical Japanese being that almost never show up on a video but it is always there somehow?! The mighty ghost samurai that inspired the Ghost of Tsushima (still to be verified)?  The most beloved Japanese character (aside Natsuki of course), that Chris says is hideous, that actually has a YTChannel that many know but say they don't just to not piss Chris?  NAH!!! It can't be!... Could it?
how long did it take!
My boyfriend has that same exact bear hand he got it in Ocean City Maryland and he uses it as a backscratcher
Hey! Don't knock my extendable bear hands. It's my favorite possession. I have one within arm's reach at all times. How else would I keep my back satisfyingly scratched?
Love a video of chris and PremiereWho? :P  Also cool to see the guys that were talked about in Cdawgs night out XD
That designated fried chicken zone with artificial grass looks like a chicken pen full of people pecking on a piece of fried chicken. Such a mindfuck 🤯🤡
Japan is crazy expensive. Strawberries on a stick and a plastic novelty
you should walk around japan. that would be very funny
That bear claw is a great back scratcher they sell them in America too lol
Pete is great
If you wanted to trigger French peoples with the Eiffel Tower comparison well gg you got me :p Great video tho!
It's the intercourse between Chris and Pete that makes these video special
holy s*** he have lost so much weight you look great
Ah, grumpy cat and Doug from Up goes to Tokyo 😅 This should be a series!
I'm going to Japan next month and I actually really wanted to know about the taco place in Akihabara...
22:35 pov: two western men have lived in the east so long, they don't know what a back scratcher is
Nice
Pete looks like Bradley cooper. I'm not the first to say this right?
Shimbashi looks like it may have served as inspiration for the city setting in the game "stray"
Asakusa to Shibuya isn't even a three hours walk.
Cheating! the mr.mime plush was there in the walk-in film
guys pls XD it's a back scratcher
Tokyo-Yokohama is the world's largest city by surface area. Also, did this guy get demoted to third best American friend?
I saw Ryotoro
The bear thing was a back scratcher mostly.
Love that Pete is showing up more and more in chris and conners videos
This two might be the most charismatic people on Youtube
My feet screamed out in protest just on the 6th day of the week walking all over tokyo and my suica parched dry from the trains  Totally worth it
I used to live in Tokyo and this video is one of the best representations of how it feels to be there! Thank you guys for sharing your walking experience! I’d like to see you exploring Shinjuku and Ikebukuro someday ❤
What's the music used through this video? If this is royalty free it's surprisingly good.
24:25 🙋ME! I would 100% buy an extendable bear hand. It's a back scratcher if you didn't know
Nice content! Laughed a lot. Thanks!
Everything to do with Pete is such a treat. What a wonderful guy the man is
I simply must inform you that the bear claw is just a stylized back scratcher 😭
One of my favourite videos that you've ever made. Simple concept, so it's very immersive, but with slick editing and voice-overs to add info and context about the locations. I'd love to see an episode for every major city.  American Pete is great too.
MR. mime compliments Pete very well!
American Pete is my favourite American.
Pete shaking hands with a back scratcher lolol
The extendable bear claw is a back scratcher! We have like 6 of them in our house
I am in love with Pete… I want him in every video. He is soo adorable and funny. Marry me Pete
Wait, Pete is 40yo? I thought he's early 30s or something 😮
Hey I’m in Tokyo too!
I have one of thouse extendable bear claw back scratchers, it came free with my head massager.
I'm with you Pete my year of the boar brother. I'll be in Japan in April, will have to track down that shrine
Wow you just basically walked my day trip from a few tears ago
Peter seems like the stereotypical energetic foreigner, the exact opposite of the British Chris Abroad. The yin of the yang.
Having just finished a 120hr Persona 5 playthrough I felt like I actually had a little bit of a sense of direction watching this video. What a great concept, Pete always brightens up videos too, hope to see some more videos like this.
Power overwhelming lol StarCraft reference anyone??
This was actually one of my favorite videos from this channel
Hol up, are we just gonna ignore that Ryotaro is in the picture at 1:50?
24:33 those are used to scratch your back, effective for that spot you can't reach
Give us more of Pete! His positivity is contagious.
God dam Chris you looking gooood 😮❤❤
Bro I've been in shibuya/akihabara for the last week and if this was filmed while I was here I'm gonna cry (It probably wasn't but I can dream)
Love the Suntory BOSS jacket
I absolutely love the choice of music on this video.
Absolutely loved this! I always make sure to do just this whenever I visit a new city. Pick a start and an end point and just walk the whole day. Great way to experience a new place and get a more authentic feel of the city compared to zipping around public transportation between tourist attractions. Would love to see this as a series, thank you for all of the great content!
I knew you end the journey at ALDGATE, one of the best British-styled Pubs in TOKYO.  Great WALKING to the two of you!
What a coincidence! For the past month I have been in Japan and have been in Tokyo for the past couple of weeks travelling up and down the Ginza line myself as I'm staying there myself! Seeing this I am checking to see if I'm in the background or not hahaha! :D
The bear hand is for scratching your back btw
If I ever travel to Tokio..you must be the guide...😁👍
25:32 'satisfied with his donkey hole' according to the subtitles. 🤣
I love Pete he's so entertaining to watch
man this guy chris is starting to look so fit and thin that he looks like he's about to pull a "Night School" in that thumbnail 😂
god i love Pete so much lmao
Nice. But.... a simple map with the stops marked would have helped me as a viewer understand the video better
Pete's a natural entertainer
For Spanish speakers who liked this type of video, you might also enjoy KiraSensei's Tour Remoto series
God Pete is hilarious. Best travel guest ever!
When I went to back to Japan back in December. I finally got to experience akibahara and did not realize that GIGO was the SEGA building. Or that the retro gaming store was so close to there. Looks like my next trip I need to revisit akibahara
Really loved this video Chris! The fact you had no specific itinerary in between stops is an amazing way to discover cool places. Also love Pete too! He brings his own vibe onto your videos. Would love to see Kyoto next since we are visiting next year! 🙌🏻
4:07  The most stylish family on the planet
Pete's right, that Boss Coffee windbreaker is dope AF 🔥🔥🔥 Very good vintage cop!
I love Shimbashi at night. Absolutely one of my favourite places in Tokyo.
Taiwanese Ji Pai is super famous at night markets, glad it's popular in Japan too, and that you guys got to try it
you can definitly break those kitkats in half fine. you just want to jam the whole thing into that gob of yours
I wanted to say, I know you've been working on your figure. The steps you've been taking are incredible. Keep it up! You've got this! Also, I've been a fan of your videos for a while. I love that you show us some of the incredible places within Japan. The Fukushima power plant video taught me a lot while showing the charm of a society left to the hands of mother nature.
Pete and Chris in a maid cafe… we need this video lol
Watch as a British man and a American survive one day across Tokyo. But in all seriousness i love Pete man he should be in more videos
you’re safe with the streetfood there, unlike in my country.
Great video.
my apendix also got remove 10weeks ago
PS it's great to have you back making more video content.  I've kept up on the podcast, which is another great way to consume your content.
I'm curious, on those last scenes did you just grab someone walking by to film you on the street and the bar? Wow, Japanese really are polite....
Hope you have good shoes on!
Exellent video but I would have loved to see more of the walking in between, maybe as a timelaps or so.
I am definitely using this video as a tip when i go to tokyo. Still dreaming i can go there. I have a long long list of what i want to do and go there.
Great video Chris and Pete, please do more like this and more Pete too.
The quality of these videos are easily the best on YouTube. I think it must be the best you can get without a TV Studio behind you.
Sticking to the core of Tokyo is a good start. The full walk across Tokyo would be something more akin to walking from Adachi to Setagaya.
I did that walk once.  Backwards.  Went to a hedgehog cafe.  They're not huggable.
I know the likelihood of getting Ken Watanabe a second time is nearly zero, but a walk across Kesennuma in a day with him would be beyond excellent.
This video is such a flex to American cities
now I want an extendable bear claw back scratcher
5000 commuters a day hey? Seems quiet 😁
Fantastic stuff! Since my visit to Tokyo I thought 20-30,000 steps was a normal daily average, guess not then! (I did want to see as much as possible) I wonder if walking the whole loop of the Yamanote circle line will have enough to see, or if it will be too short?
Woah dude! You look young on this tumbnail!
The station looks very very similar to the Amsterdam central station in the Netherlands. The style is Dutch without question, which makes sense given the Dutch Japanese historical relationship
Is there any chance you could do shorts on how to edit videos?
This is really trippy , I walked almost exactly the reverse route with my homie a month ago
Would love to see you continue this series in other places like Osaka, Kyoto or more in the countryside like Izu or Morioka! Also a great way to collaborate with other creators like Norm from Tokyo Lens...
pete is a man of rizz
OMG, 24:36 They have Siedler of Catan Boardgame. 😍
chris you look amazing your health journey really showing :) keep it up. ah also the video is fire <3
I remember Connor showing Mouse the temple on his IRL tour of Tokyo stream for her and how empty/weird it was seeing it empty compared to this video. Good to see the crowds coming and helping local businesses there.
wowowowow
Literally staying in Asakusa right now!
Pete seems like a great guy :)
This is the first thing you’ve done that I want to do too! Well that and visiting the “grave” ? of … Jesus …. Ok maybe questionable choices
I walk 16 miles (25.75km) every week in LA.  Come at me, bro.
Bear Claw is a back scratcher 😊
30:37 Pete put his beer below Chris'! Pete has respected his senior very well. The Japanese would be proud.
Holy...the difference on Shibuya and the road from Roppongi to Shibuya is HUGE
If you walk across Kyoto, you should try a path from Fushimi-inari (or Kiyomizu for a shorter walk) - to - Arashiyama and try to hit up as many shrines and temples along the way as possible.
In Tokyo right now I went to all. Of these places.
i seriously would love this is @JunkFoodJapan, ive loved Chris and Nic team ups before and would love to see more!
How nice of chris to give his grandson some pocket money for lifting the weight.
We pay IN FULL
16:45 5,000 a day? There's no way that's all it is.
again, almost unliked bcs i wanted to like it twice lol
Havent watched abroad in japan in a while, and damn, chris looking good and healthy. Well done man
"The squeeze for the stress you have caused me" 😂
That one kid named Casino:
Another great video Pete. Who is the other guy in this video, he seems alright. it’s nice Pete sort of lets him take the lead, so he feels like he’s doing something.
I knew when Pete got that Bear Claw it was going to be used to mess with Chris lol.
Another good video…I like the idea of walking videos…you need to do some more.
2000 Yen is only 20$ ?? No doubt this f*ckers are going all around the world complaning how tough their life is !!
Fun video. DEAD LINKS- stabilized camera and Indoor lens.
surely the guys know the bear claw is a back scratcher right?
2000 JPY = 15.37 USD
Absolute blast going on the trip and I have NO DOUBT that my services have elevated me back to best American friend— right? ……. what do you FIFTH?
Really liked this video Chris, great work!
Oh hey look it's me. Lmao although I cut my hair.
Do they still fly hot air ships around Tokyo? they did this 2005 and again on my second visit in 2007, is this still a thing?
Looking really healthy there man! Face is looking lean.
Heya! Did the math, and Pete should be celebrating his 40th this year!!! 🎉🍻 Woohoo! 🥳
The "bear claw" looks like a back scratcher , haha
big fried chicken, or big flat pigeon?! 🤣🤣🤣
This video looked like y'all had a blast, almost no typical British negativity from Chris. I wonder if it's due to Pete
Just in case you didn't know, the extendable bear hand is a back scratcher😂
Love the video! Nice to see you healthy Chris! 🎉
Looking good, for an Englishman. Just kidding, I'm half English too but much more handsome. Thanks for your consideration.
I did this exact walk in 2019. It took me about 4 hours and it equaled about 49k steps and about 30km. When I went to a bar in the evening the local Japanese business men thought I was absolutely crazy for walking it.
Nighttime photography perfect - sounds kinda like something Natsuki would say. I guess living in Japan leaves it's mark
We love Pete!!!
We pay in full.
Great video!
Lol I know the Ameyoko temple from playing Persona 5 Royal. 🤣
American Pete is the biggest star in this video
16:50 5,000? Seems like it should be 500,000 or 5 million
I've been watching you for YEARS. it is finally my time to go to Japan in less than a month. I am so Excited!!!
Tokyo is only biggest by population not land area.
I used to take long walks with my then best friend around Shinjuku-Shibuya-Meguro area usually starting from Shinookubo. The goal was always to find cool drinking spots but it also helped keep me in shape.
The best things are the outtakes! Please sir. Can i have more!?
What Do you think about the vice documentary about the schoolgirl/prostitution going on in Japan and especially tokio?   Did you watch it?
I did this in Yokohama one time. Which is to say I missed the last train home.
Pete is honestly the best companion
Watch all your videos, love the content, you funny, sarcastic, super smart documentary film maker you,. Makes me want to visit Japan.
1:46 I saw a wild Ryotaro in this shot
20km sounds like much but then you remember that your average walking speed is 5km/h that makes it just 4 hours of walking
16:40 Busiest station with 4000 trains and 5000 commuters every day? Those must be some empty trains, or you missed a few zeros.
Please please please we need this as a series! Next up: Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima,  Nara....
More Pete!!!
Love this idea!
Pete if you see this, you're awesome and entertaining to watch
OOPS.  16:49  Tokyo Station has a lot more than 5000 commuters a day.  Try 500,000
Pete!! I love the extendable bear hand XD - it's useful for scratching your back!
08:42 LOVE BOOZE WEAK!
12:39 Thank you Pete for perfectly explaining why often us Americans love Tokyo.
Seems like the perfect series to do with Garnt
Did almost the same walk but started in Koto (where my hotel was) > Tokyo tower > Roppongi > Shinjuku > Shibuya. I miss Tokyo.
You'd have found a bit more life between Roppongi and Shibuya if you had cut across to Aoyama Dori (Route 246 is it?) and gone along to Shibuya past the Omotesando station. But what were you doing in Roppongi in the first place - it's not on the Ginza-sen at all. Ginza sen goes through Akasaka Mitsuke and Aoyama Itchome to Shibuya. It's been nearly thirty years since I commuted along that route every day, and I can still remember it.
Sorry Chris I love your channel and I sorta Love you You are straight laced and a touch conservative But Having Natski, Pete and the Aussie Joel?  Is a Masterstroke, Contrasting Crazy personalities Lifts your channel into the Stratosphere Keep up the Great work.
Pete funny asl
Lol I did something similar on Christmas 2018, when I first found out trains in Tokyo end a midnight, and I walked 8km back to my hotel. Actually quite a nice peaceful walk. Also found out salarymen apparently sleep in Dennys?
He’s back! Chris, I nearly stole tour MrJelly fridge magnet at Neko Neko Inn. But I felt bad and the Japanese would frown upon it I’m sure.
YOOO LETS GOOOO
High quality bullying :P
I'm hoping the whole time they realize the bear claw is an extendable back scratcher lol
I live in Tokyo but  I'm not there...
need u to do this in the capital of every prefecture 🫶
cycling to walking, let him cook.
i loved nakagin tower as well. so beautiful and conceptually great even if the execution was shit
I'm currently staying in Shibuya, I woke up this morning watching this video. I then decided to go to Senso-ji temple. Not disappointed. Thanks.
I know Pete is your friend, but we would also love some content without him.
What's the name of the music at 12:55 Akihabra
This was so cool, I really hope it becomes a series or this idea gets revisited again in the future! Pete was right, it's so cool how walkable tokyo is ( coming from someone who lives in Washington)
We all know that bear paw is a backscratcher right? Good, just checking. Great video as always <3
can you up the brightness on your videos
Look at Pete man so inspirational
Watching this after finishing studying for a test I have for tomorrow. The kind of heartwarming video I needed.  Nice video, Pete! You and that sidekick of yours actually make a great team! Hoping to see you both together more!
How does Chris look younger here
common chris and pete banger
scripted or not your videos are entertaining chris! i found your channel last november and i've binge watch everything~ hope u make another series!
24:26 a nice telescoping portable back scratcher 👍
Would a livestream walk be difficult to do?
another abroad in japan video to brighten up your day btw you lookin good chris
I have that extendable bear hand. Backscratcher.
Love Chris' architectural commentary. I've noticed from his past vids and podcast episodes that he has keen architectural observations.
Pete wasn’t lying when he met that long haired guy again at connor’s irl stream.
Looking forward to reading your book. Great video and well done
Pete is literally comedic gold
Pete's comedic timing is truly phenomenal 😂 I love his sense of humor
広島で歩くのビデオを見たい！ 原爆ドームや広島のお城や平和の美術館など紹介してください。
THE SAME DAMN VIDEO OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
I love this video idea! Such a good way to show some key spots in Tokyo ❤
This is like a normal siteseeing day for me
This is such perfect timing. I'm heading to Tokyo for the first time in 10 years and I'm taking my brother who has never been! It is a good way to get an updated view of everything while giving my brother a bit of an insight!
Pete is such a lovely person to hang out with
Walking around Tokyo is a vibe.
Mr Mime was the MVP of this video
Thanks for making this video. Its much more enjoyable than watching just raw footage of a 4 hour livestream. Glad you're getting rewarded with a sponsorship.
he is baaaack
Chris YOU DONT DESERVE PETE!! He’s such a sweetheart.
Looks like Black Pigeon Speaks wanted to guest star in this video. Cannot wait to go to Japan and see this first hand.
If the bird is too stupid to move away from giant predators, it deserve to die.
It was a fun video
Thanks Chris, great content.
you two are fun to watch and listen....enjoyed the video - thanks
Great video Chris, Pete’s also awesome. Careful with using similar looking thumbnails, I almost thought this was an old video until I saw the upload date.
Tokyo is infinitely bigger than that.
I just wanna say Chris looks so much better than he did a year ago
pete = jack black
LOL the way he goes back to that quote at 8:15 was so funny to me.
You should have downloaded Aglet for your walk!
The bear claw is ment to be a back scratcher...
Idk why Chris looks like a hobbit in the thumbnail 🤣🤣🤣
クリス、ありがとう、家族と一緒にあなたのことを見始めて以来、私は日本語を練習して、上手になったと思う ありがとう :)
The extendable bear claw is a back scratcher by the way :)
The Shimbashi  district is so, Blade Runner-ish. For a moment I thought a flying hoover craft would approach from above.
The Shimbashi  district is so, Blade Runner-ish. Looks amazing
Hi Chris, I had a take a break from your channel, busy at work. Happily, you have only polished your craft, since I last watched your channel. AIJ is still the best channel about Japan on YouTube.  Please, accept my contribution for legal expense, when American Pete assaults someone...Cheers Chris.
a new series, jogging japan.
Perfect thing to wake up too! Great watch 👍🏻
If you want to keep up the fitness thing, why don't you try Sumo or karate or judo? Would make a good video
I know Don Qiote from the Yakuza game series. That's cool, I thought it was made up 😁
That extendable bear claw is a back scratcher. Very satisfying. 😊
You forgot Blackpool Tower guys... 🗼👀
pete: dont talk to me or my son (mr mime) ever again
There's a GIGO right outside my window. Didn't even notice that is stopped being a Sega! WTF?! They got my by not changing the color scheme. The game center itself hasn't changed even one other aspect, though. But, yeah, for the connection to my childhood, I'm wishing it was still a Sega. GIGO... Get Into the Game Oasis? Pffft!
Cherry Blossom Season, gotta follow the Meguro river on a walk. Maybe take Sharla on a nice long walking date.  Then meet up with the crew for a a big ol' hanami.
I tried doing this around the Yamanote line... didn't quite make it
Comment
24:59 u cant escape us
I'd buy the extendu bear hand to scratchu my back
Would it be possible to get the route you took posted somewhere so we fans could potentially follow in your footsteps?
20:49
Great idea for a series. Those shots of walking through the city gave me wander lust.
Great tour! Love the unscripted random fun no script and good editing brings out in this video, Chris. The image quality is also high enough quality for nighttime filming, too. I hear new phones are excellent at night. What did you use to shoot with?
Is that thumbnail suppose to be Chris when he was like 14 yrs old 😆
shirt says "love beer weak!" ..... week?
Love this video! This is almost my every day when I get to travel in Japan, just like when I got the chance to go to Osaka and Kyoto last week! I spend about 20+ km walking every day just to make sure I make the most out of the trip!
Chris and Pete was halerious as always! Great job!
I was in Japan a month ago. My trip went by so fast 😢
I'll be visiting Tokyo next month.  I think I'll do this walk!
That's a pretty good concept here. As a pretty good walker myself I should try visiting places this way. One thing I also wanted to do was England on a bike.
10:32 – "The shops have a grittiness to them..." [sound of person hacking up a lung in the background] 😂
Seems like Pete keeps getting demoted each time in the ranks of best American friend.  Anyway, good video, for both first timers to Japan as well as those who have been multiple times but either haven't done this route or been to all these locations.
10:03 – What, that's not straight whisky is it? In such a massive serve? Is it some kind of premixed whisky blend?  EDIT: Never mind, I googled it: "A convenient and crisp combination of Japanese Kakubin whisky and soda, our canned Kaku Highball goes well with any meal. Lemon spirits are added to whisky and soda to enhance the refreshing taste".
love to see pete again
yay! this is a "We pay it in full" Peter episode! I recognize so much of these streets from binging Tokyo Len's videos XD I'm a year of the boar too, Pete. It's so interesting to see the rings of history in Tokyo though.  I am thoroughly jealous of your Boss Jacket. TnT
Chris, you look absolutely fantastic with the weight loss. I thoroughly enjoyed this video, Pete is always a treat, and just the general vibe of your videos always catch me from start to end. If there's one wish I have in this new year in regards to your content, it's more of your documentary-style videos, like you did with Fukushima. Those, along with your winter videos, are some of my personal favorites amongst your high quality content.  All of that being said, I wish you the best in this new year, and I hope to see you as inspiring as always.
16:42 4k trains and 5k people a day huh? IDK about that one chief
Love Pete! He's always such a joy 🥰🥰
the bear hand is a back scratcher btw....
1:44 – Wait, is that guy in the black and white striped top Ryotaro? Is that older footage spliced in?  EDIT: Oh wait yeah it is, spotted him later in the Asakusa video extract.
Lmao Pete’s surfer dude accent took me out
That's what I call Steppuku.
the bear hand is great to scratch your back! :D
The bear claw petting Chris's hair at the end is perfection! 😂
Sounds like a great way to get plantar fasciitis
15:33 Oh, the Italians would love that building... "Sega" ...   is their national pastime .
Going to be in Tokyo with my friend in two weeks and seriously considering replicating this journey
the perfect gift for an american, money XD
Extendable Bear hand - had to laugh - looked over to my right and there is my extendable bear hand exact same one - good back scratcher - all the best from New Zealand
can i rent your pack mule next time my family's in tokyo? 😆
Really liked this. You should do this as a regular series, but don't have to go so far. Do shorter walks and more stores/ food.
Omg I was short on Abroad in Japan vids that I went watch your old vids again and now before the end of January 2023, we finally have a vid and a very unique one where Tokyo is really a walkable city like no other capital cities are. Thanks for the content and of course with Pete as well.
As someone who has been living in East Asia for ten years, I know exactly what you mean when you say the last few years have been dire. Sure, it was dire for everyone but being on the other side of the world, isolated from your family when the whole world seems to be going insane isn't fun. Glad you made it back to England and things in Japan are on the up. I am hoping to swing by Japan in April before I call time on East Asia and return to England (probably a terrible decision). Looking forward to seeing more city walks.
Where's Natsuki??
If you make this a series, bring back Pete!
That's pretty pathetic to walk that slow on a 15 mile trip.
Love seeing you and Pete out doing things like this.

15:36 Yeeeeee Love Live cameooooooooo
24:25 its a back scratcher you uncultured swine LOLOLOL
This video was so fun, I really like video editing of Chris's videos they feel unique to his channel
Awesome video and great concept!! Even though Tokyo is always talked about by tourists, the way you displayed it shows the city's quirks 😁 Also, just a suggestion- would've been great to see the time when you and Pete arrived at the labeled locations. Then we could gauge/take note of what it's like, and it would detail the vibe a bit more (in my opinion) 👏
Man this guy has milked japan dry, how much more can he do?
ok start Shinagawa, going through Shirogane Platinum Street Teien Museum to Daikanyama to Shibuya. Look at the cafes, embassies, and end Midori Sushi.
come on now chris  . .  how did pete got bumped down to the third best american friend  .  the best hype man in cycling , the best corner man in chess boxing ,  the 1/3 of the van gang . he failed in full ! ! !
Pete: That's awesome Chris: No, you're awesome Pete: YOU'RE awesome  My heart, I can't. 💙
Someone’s inspired by Craig Mod’s recent newsletter eh? Love the Abroad in Japan take on walking Tokyo! More please!
Honestly I have one of those claws and they make excellent back scratchers.
8:10 UNFATHOMABLE AMOUNT OF RIZZ FROM PETE
that was fun
Chris you look fitter than ever
Thank you so much for the laughs, and still managing to bring us some real street tour info. My brother and I are planning our trip out to Japan. I may just follow your steps.....
Wait...  There's a MASSIVE Kotobukiya store in Akihabara....?!?!?!??!?!
yamanote beer a thon. grab a beer at each station conbini as you walk the line. (stop for lunch and dinner) takes about 10-14 hours depending on the group
I have one of those bear claws. . .they're to scratch your back
Did they really not figure out that the bear hand is a back scratch?
16:48 5 thousand commuters every day? sounds kinda low chrissss
Nice video, my favorite so far in the channel :)
i need that bear hand for my back scratches..
2:25 Pete can barely string together a sentence? Oh, come on Pete, surly your better that the currant American President, old bumbling Joe.
I did that exact same walk also starting at Asakusa following the Ginza line  20 years ago.
Did I miss what pete got at Tokyo Station???
Incredible job. 👏👏👏👏👏Thank you for sharing your trek across Tokyo.  Very entertaining and informative.  Stay well. 👍🙏😎
16:40 I think you mean five HUNDRED thousand :D
14:00 - CHAD! AF
what happened to the people who owned and lived in the Nakagin Tower? breaks my heart,  I enjoyed seeing your episodes about the building.
I would love to watch the raw version of this video. Just to get a real feel of Tokyo.
The bear hand back scratcher is a good find for cat fosterers when you can't touch the cat yet bc they're too spicy :'3
Pete has made this video so much more enjoyable!😂
Chris and Pete have become an iconic pair to me now.
12:51 Angry Japanese judging Pete's noise.
Meanwhile, Garnt still waiting for his episode of 'Taken for Garnted':
has abroad in japan covered the pet industry in japan might be a cool thing to cover
Please walk the nakasendo! That would be an amazing video
Nice.
I’m so glad your exploring  again
Yes pete yass
Did you guys complain about getting a fried chicken that was too big just to go to the next neighbourhood and order yakitori?😂😂😂😂
Extendable bear claw = 'Bear Ass Scratcher'  Of course!
The bear hand is a back scratcher, and it works really well!
A wretched hive of scum and villainy!
IT'S A BACK-SCRATCHER YO
12:30 Pete's based and orange pilled?
16:45 : was that meant to be 500k, not 5k?
One thing I've noticed is how little you can tell what is and isn't accessible in Japan.
This was great fun Chris, great to see you back to making your own videos, I think Pete deserves " back pay" for Tokyo Station, Tokyo Tower, and Rhippongi or "payback" for wasting your money on junk, all of which I seriously enjoyed. Keep up the nonsense. Cheers, Muffy from Oz
That shot at 0:10... my goodness. I flew drones for years and got a license as a hobbyist, edited videos, and have been around the block, but everything about this channel continues to blow my mind. Chris, thank you for lending your extensive talents to the world.
Dude I can't believe it you lose a lot of weight. Congrats.
I loved your companion on this video! You need to do more with him, he’s got a really cool funny funky vibe about him and you two seem to mesh well.
Hey Pete, 1983 here too man!
Chris is becoming the mr.beast of japan lol
back scratchers lol i know because i had one lol
I think Chris saying sake KitKats are good is a bit lmao. It has to be
Pete and Chris lets gooooooo!!
I was born in 1983 tooo...hahaha
man, Walkable Cities are so cool! especially when you have Pete to goof around & be amazed by everything
Dude grew a whole beard with walking all that distance.
That was a super awesome video. I enjoyed it a lot! Please more of those, also an awesome way to see more about Tokyo!
4:01 That bird is out for Pete’s blood
'Your awesome'
Oh wow...I know in Japan you do a lot of walking but I didn't realize how close some of those places were to each other.  No clue if I would be able to walk that much though...probably not until I get in shape. Sad that walking that much only burnt 1,500 calories.
Nice vid - good chemistry between you two and Pete is a ripper! Do more please
Where is the Akihabara taco spot...?
Man Chris is turning into slender man, we need to search for the pages he left around Japan
1983 boars represent
19:47 Why is there a Filipino themed club in Japan? Is it because of the filipino girls there?
That stretchy gorilla is going to haunt my nightmares. Aside from that - a FANTASTIC video! You two, as always, are so fun together.
💕😺😺😺💫
You look like a young lad in the thumbnail
KOF! K' or Kula and Athena always!!!
Pete has the Mr. Mime on his backpack before going into super potato to get it.
Would love to see more of walking around some other cities!
Well done gents!
if you kill the 🐦 that is your next meal 😆
that bear claw is a back scratcher
Guys, the "extendable bear hand" is your standard Telescoping Back Scratcher, sold at lots of places here in the U.S.  The fact that it it's extendable means you can fold it down and put it in your travel pack or your purse. Have you guys really never seen one before? My grandmother used to have one because arthritis and mobility issues made it difficult for her to just reach back and scratch whenever she had an itch, and the telescoping feature meant she could shorten it when needed unlike the traditional plastic or bamboo back scratchers.  Given Japan's rapidly aging population, I would imagine this is a very useful tool there.
This video is such a flex from Chris, showing lots of old footage and images from before he started getting fit.
Sake kit kat are honestly the best
Mr. Mime speaks for all of us. Cheers from Edmonton Alberta.
Affable Chris and Endearing Pete in a fantastic video with some of the best shots I've seen in an Abroad in Japan episode!
"We walk from Asakusa to Shibuya"  I mean yeah, that is doable.  'Starts walking North from Kaminarimon'  ... Okay you lost me. That is not the easiest way to go but I hope you had fun!
love pete
Skytree is my favourite... Tokyo Tower is pretty average
26:40 Pete miss out on "Thank you BEARy much" 😄
Honestly the last part where it was empty was my favorite, so much cypherpunk dystopian ahah
I may be the only one that'd like to see it. But I'd love to see a tour of the Tokyo Tower Records store. I used to love going to Tower Records in the US and spent so much money buying stuff I couldn't find anywhere else.
Was this filmed during autumn or winter? (coz at 5PM it was already dark) I'm considering hours with light for my itinerary in autumn :)
Respects to Pete for being a King of Fighters fan. Terry Bogard and Leona are my mains all the way. Also someone once won a tournament with Mr. Mime in competitive Pokemon. (Doubt Pete will ever see this.)
Awesome as always.
Strolling across Japan : Tokyo edition
I recently bought the same bear claw. Glad to know someone else is making the same choice. Carrying backpacks makes your back itchy.
wish you live-streamed this walk, that would've been amazing content to watch in the background while working on something like the cyclathon
Wait , I thought Blade Runner was your favorite Film ?
if you walk nonstop for 5 hours youll make it 25 kilometers easy lol
You're looking really healthy and happy. Brilliant video idea.
I don't normally comment on videos but I just wanted to say that you're looking good Chris! The consistency and fitness journey is really paying off, well done mate
Chris looking good!
bruh thats a back scratcher....
Ehmmmm, 30.000 steps and 25 km, something doesn't add up...😅
0:43 DESUWA
24:59 fkn golden. >.<
Looking lean 👍🏻
Keeping up with the Fitness journey. We gonna see a new series soon? Walking around Japan where you walk on different cities for a day?
I so hope you’re wearing those bike shorts in this video. Your butt looks so good I’m sorry lol
Chris the bear claw back scratcher is an amazing device!
Haven’t they ‘modernised’ Tokyo Station too?
4000 trains for 5000 commuters a day? Seems inefficient... 🤣
EXCELLENT VIDEO!! Perfect combination of planning and spontaneity, thank you very much Chris and Pete!  We all get a realistic experience of Tokyo city.  And it’s relatable! Every tourist who comes to Japan will walk around like this and pick up trinkets and snacks. If I could add anything it’d be some jidōhanbaiki, aways a bit of fun. chuck em in and .. chef’s kiss!  Next vid Shin-Ōsaka to Tengachaya! 🙌
This was a good and refreshing video.  Like the others you do, but fun to see you guys just walk around. as simple as that seems... feel like it could be a break from all the hard thinking and create some fun videos and also help people discover towns we don't know about.  Tokyo down, now time for cities all over Japan...  Give your mind a break from all the out of the box videos you've been doing the past several years.  2023, year Chris walks all through Japan.
The bear claw is an extendeable back scratcher
The "yeah?" from Pete made me feel bad for him... only for a second though dude seemed like he enjoyed himself 😉👍
you can actually see a lot. when i first went to japan (alone) i walked everyday after taking the subway to a destination of my choice. i would walk the whole day and feel so tired by the time i got back to my accommodation, but it was such a relaxing way of exploring the city
I believe the extendible bear claw is more than likely a collapsible back scratcher
Asakusa is a great place, but out side of the temple Tokyo is very boring. Akihabara is overrated to be honest. Osaka is definitely more enjoyable and Dotombori is more fun with more to do 😐
This video was so much fun! Hope you do more like it.
Chris is teaching Pete the British term , " Dogsbody"
Man, I fucking love Japan. One day I'll eat a giant fried chicken too
take our pete to somewhere beautiful, he deserves it chris., new boyfriend?.
Hi Chris , I have traveled to Japan in the past just to visit Odaiba Oedo Onsen Monogatari. But since its closed down could you recommend another place to visit close to tokyo that has the same all in one experience as Odaiba Oedo Onsen Monogatari did. im finding it hard to research places since i can't read japanese. Thanks for the video :)
lol at 00:39 you can hear Shin Jidai by Ado from One Piece FILM Red playing in Ameyoko
Man im in too deep down the J-vlogger rabbit hole, im starting to recognise places in Tokyo.  I picked the roof top shrine just from the store under it
Admit it Chris, this is an idea you got from ChatGPT
See, as a Pokemon fan now all I can think about is what Pokemon Chris, Sharla, Natsuki, and Ryotaro would use (Pete obviously gets Mr. Mime)
That’s not an “extendable bear hand!” It’s a back scratcher of course. (And it’s bear paw 🐾, or claw?)
0:23 Genshen Impact 15:31
What cameras can capture at night these days is nothing short of amazing. Your night time shots or Tokyo are just beautiful.
The bear hand is a back scratcher lol
i love this vid. here’s to hoping we get the taken for garnted episode soon!!
That giant fried chicken had me thinking: is Japan a country that values leftovers? Like would someone save part of that for later, or  a meal they saved? Is it pretty standard across Japan or does it vary depending upon region or person?
My max on a city was Amsterdam, I walked 16km so I can see how 25k can be very hard
I know it may have been said, but Pete, that's a bear claw back scratcher!
People commute from Ibaraki and Tochigi to Tokyo but those areas are not considered greater Tokyo, yet southern Chiba which is nowhere near Tokyo and Yokohama a total other city are somehow considered part of greater Tokyo weird
At this point you should just attempt walking to Kyoto via Tokaido
Wish I could do this but I broke my ankle 3 months ago in Kyoto and only recovered 60% The fracture is a non-union so it's quite painful to walk long distances + it gets very swollen
not to boost his ego more, but pete is getting better and better in these videos
Great video! I would love to see a series of this.
American Pete wins most handsome friend award 🥇
i’m born in 1983. can confirm. i feel like an old man 🤣
Don't you also lose calories just by being awake? So adding onto the 1500 calories burnt you've actually lost more calories?
as great as this video is, i'm utterly flabbergasted that neither of you knew that the 'extendable bear claw' is a back scratcher
Ive been in Japan for 45 days via Ice Poseidon's subathon stream, im really tired
1:42 this back looks so familiar🤔
This is great motivation! In March I‘m going to walk the entire Nakasendo from Kyoto to Tokyo in 3 weeks, which requires about ~30 km of walking per day. This definitely gives me something to look forward to!
Thank you for not wearing muzzles!!!!!!! Cheers
Man, its just such a good video. Thank you for eating huge chicken and showing us the sights.
You live in Japan and speak Japanese.  Don't you think it's about time you suppressed the British part of you that actively goes out of its way to mispronounce foreign words?
Did about the same walk a few times some months ago. Pretty easy but nice stroll
We stayed in Shinjuku, well, atleast in takadanobaba (Somewhere) and we went out every single day early morning, still couldn't conquor Tokyo.
That big chicken looks tasty!
The bear claw is a back scratcher. That’s why it extends, so you can reach your back.
you and connor uploading at the same time .thank you for the content
I used to work im the British pub in the last scene. Glad they made it through covid.
I love Pete, he must be protected 🥺 he sometimes seems like he’s a little sad inside 🥺🥺 only happiness for Pete !!!!!
Gonna be living in Tokyo for a year starting this Fall. Fucking pumped
Those calorie things are bullshit. The amount of calories your body will use to repair all the muscles you've damaged will be intense over the next few days.
I enjoy just going to a place start in one area and just walk around and see what I find. So this video is right up my alley. I even sometimes do this in my own city because even living here my entire life still don't know all parts of it and there is always something new to discover. Grew up quite poor and my mom used to do this occasionally on the weekends with me. Just get into public transport then switch to a different line and see where it leads us and we would eat somewhere that looked good to us. Was a good way to have fun for a relatively low cost.
learning IRL streaming without streaming
Love Pete!  He's such a great and inspiring guy! ^____^
What' the correct statistic for Tokyo station? 5000 people per day seems very low.
Well, now I have a dream to repeat this walk one day.
Great one. Thanks for sharing this epic mini pilgrimage across Tokyo. Would love to do this one and you guys did it and shared it so even thou watching it not the same a experiencing it will do for now. I am saving this locations on my Google maps. Will have them ready for whenever I travel to Japan and fulfill on my my dreams. Tokyo looks epic. An EV scooter or unicycle will be epic to travel all across Tokyo and other destinations. TO take an EV is on my plan.... NIce one and lets go Japan and Abroad in Japan
My daughter and I walked from  Asakua to Tokyo Skytree on a very nice afternoon. It was quite pleasant. We just kept our destination in sight and were there in little while.  I would like to spend more days just walking around Tokyo.
YouTube algo showed me your channel, can't get enough. Great videos
literally own the same bear claw back scratcher-
Chris just suggests to buy drinks and snacks and Pete finds the real loot.
Which taco restaurant were you going to recommend in Akihabara? I'm always looking for a new place to try on my way to school.
Nah roppongi is seedy af. Went on vacation in Japan before covid hit and you couldn't walk two seconds without these guys walking up to you asking you to come inside to a strip club (which i've heard some shady stuff about). Definitely wouldn't recommend. Also that "extendable bear hand" is a back scratcher I'm pretty sure
“Oh my days!!” That dude was as British as you get 😂😂😂
Honestly one of my favorite videos in awhile from you! so fun!!!
I want to say when I start walking across a city I walk forever. I can walk endlessly in a city. I would love to do so in Tokyo.
4:49 was that a SC2: Legacy of the Void reference?
Nice to see how you react to fans versus Connor's hard take on anyone approaching him now. Everything is a "stream sniper" to him now. Had a friend pass up meeting him for fear of him being negative about it.
13:45 Chris got violated HARD.
Chris, wth you look younger now, especially in that Thumbnail clickbait picture. Looking like 28ish. Good for you.
Coming in 2024 Journey Across Japan: The Walking Tour!
The endless walk of despair.
oh man when did you film this? i was just there, i wonder if i walked by you and didn't even notice
I dont break kit kats either lol
I fucking love these videos
Not sure if it's a joke but its a back scratcher
All of your travel challenges that need physical exertion from you are so cool to watch but why do you keep doing this to your body...
Just for reference.... the bear hands are back scratchers and I have one myself. They work well.
Yay Pete! Love his enthusiasm!
Me and the missus went to a miad cafe once out of curiosity. It was very weird and creepy and something everyone should do only once.
Ryotaro at 1:44
You definitely can't walk much around Santa Monica
I demand more Pete. Chris is optional.
This video was very bustling
you underestimate how many people would watch a 12 hour video of you and pete walking across tokyo
I walked 35km across Tokyo in the august heat to Disney land to get an overnight coach to Sendai and absolutely STANK by the time I got there. I had to change my clothes in the Disney bathroom before boarding 😂
Man you guys are both looking so good! Glad to have you back uploading, hope you got a great rest over the holidays!
Why would they demolish Nakajin tower? So iconic, last vestige of unique modern architecture
Poor Pete is like the emotionally abused friend who's just happy to get attention lol
I see Chris? I click! I see Chris AND American Pete? Well I click even harder of course!
This is really cool. I would honestly love a little more b-roll of those quieter in-between places as well.
That was good fun!
Loved this video so much. Great to have your videos back Chris! Pete is such a sweet soul xx
Fun video as always. Hope you two had a great holiday! I'd love to VS Pete at some KOF. I am not the greatest player, but was told I am seasoned enough to offer challenge. Me and Andy Bogard are a dangerous combo! Glad you had fun,Chris. that's the most important part of a journey isn't it, Not the destination. Look forward to more content from yourself and others you bring along for the ride. always a good time.
ok, dumb question. can we get an exact google map spot for that alleyway in shimbashi with the train behind?
blackpool tower is the best tower
0:02 "most busiest"? nice english chris
Pls make this in a series. Awesome video!
Christ is doing half meraton as camouflage for his fitness journey...
Mr Mime creating a continuity nightmare
Pete always makes me smile, he comes across as such a lovely and genuine person. Chris you're alright too. 😘
We better see pete in all these walk videos from now on
ANY VIDEO WITH PETE!!  IS INSTANTLY AMAZING! this man just brings so much comfort and happiness in whatever he does! Just seeing him makes me smile. Truly the best companion to have on a 20km walk
Absolutely love this series please keep these coming. Would love to see an episode that includes all of the trash taste boys, Pete, ryotoro and of course the shining star of the entire channel Natsuki! That would be chaos in the best way. I gotta say Pete is really coming into his own. He's always been funny but his camera presence and timing is great and I think he deserves some props (his twitch channel is PremierTwo.) Chris you seemingly never run out of creative ideas for videos and shining light on Japan in a cinematic, interesting and sometimes hilarious way and your personality always shines through in the videos and in the style of editing and cinematography. You guys are top tier content.
This is great back to the old of videos that can help you me plan my Japan trip!
I have one of those bear paws! One of the best back scratchers I've ever had.
Wait a minute.....4000 trains but only 5000 commuters? Did I hear that right? Probably at least 50,000 commuters...
2000 Yen for six half strawberries on a stick and a cheap plastic toy. Awesome. ^^°
I love the simplicity of videos with shopping in foreign (to me) markets or stores. Just seeing prices and the similarities or differences is always fascinating.
A series of Pete and Chris walking around Japan would be dope. It's a different perspective than Journey Across Japan that I think is going to do really well. Maybe I'm biased because I do enjoy those POV 3 hour long videos of some guy walking in literally any city in Japan.
I was washing dishes while watching the show, then burst out laughing when Pete offered his "Gorilla Sack" to those stressed, you really can't put those on a script! Awesome video as always!
You call that a tower?Try the sears tower friend😂
28:16 I eat Kitkats the same way. I even eat the full size ones like a normal candy bar. Partly because I kinda enjoy making anyone who sees me do this deeply uncomfortable. Hell I don’t eat them often so quite often when i eat a full size kitkat bar, I’ll take a bite down the middle and send pics to my friends. Make them question why they’re friends with me and in the case of my girlfriend, question why she loves me… then again she has a thing for Evil and I have a thing for crazy. Gomez and  Morticia, eating Kitkats wrong together.
Thank you both for the awesome video~ It's always a good time when Pete is involved, Not a clue where to point you on the next walk but I know it will be fun whatever you choose to do, Thank you for taking us around Tokyo and building some muscle at the same time... Mr Calfable grows stronger!!! Thank you all for your hard work, Keep it up m(_ _)m I hope everyone is having a lovely day, Have a wonderful rest of your week, Be safe and Take care out there wherever you are (^=W=^)7
Hey man... eff you for getting sexier while the rest of us poor schmucks continue having to get by with not wanting to better ourselves physically. You're a menace
Chris you look and sound great. I also like how your accent is a little thicker while you're walking around on foot pointing things out
Who wouldn't want to hang with pete, such a joker🤣 love that you did the walk together😊
Man haven’t been to Tokyo since 2014.  My past trip to Japan I skipped Tokyo for Kyoto and Osaka.
I love how Pete managed to elect a response from just casual passerbys. Something that vexed Chris as a challenge in one of the earlier Across Japan trips. Natural MC energy.
Shopping with Pete would be a great series.
I challenge Tokyo as the largest city in the world since Camden to Palm Beach Sydney NSW Australia is 120km in distance vs your 20km Chris....
Fantastic video! I'm really happy to see you continue the fitness/health-related videos Chris. Keep it up!
Best guest 🙏
I love Sake KitKat they're very difficult to get in Canada though. I'd probably buy an extra suitcase just for those if I ever visit
The whole adventure was extremely fun and I'm glad you were able to share so many neat locations with us! Definitely taking notes for my trip to Tokyo at the end of this year!
As someone who walked thirty something kilometers (with a serious backpack and on very little sleep), this video made me feel good about myself by comparison...
GIGO is the acronym for 'Garbage in, garbage out.' someone really needs to re-think that business name!
sublime watch as always chris
Great to see you back! Is there any chance you might do a video about Go culture, particularly the salons, if such a thing is still a thing? It's always intrigued me but there's very little to find, besides Hikaru no go 🙂
I actually bought one of those bear paws, a handy back scratcher. As always, a thoroughly enjoyable video
Thoroughly enjoyed this walk through of Tokyo.  The extendable bear claw is a back scratcher!
More Pete! Love seeing him in these videos. He brings such a great energy with him!
That Eki geezer in Roppongi deffo went boarding school in England; that accent and rocking the Barbour? I’d bet money on it! 😂
Great video. Please do a live video walk about. 👍🥰
I thoroughly enjoyed this post. Seems like such a good laugh just exploring the Tokyo with a mate. 👍🏻 I enjoy living vicariously through you Chris. 👑
A video with Pete is always a major treat.
I would love to go to Japan one day. Just need to get over my mental issues
Next video, walk along the Yamanote? 😂😂
I am with u Pete 1983 as well bro u are the best
Please do more together with pete! And I love that unscriptet content
More Pete, please! He is hilarious and awesome! Yup, more compliments for him 😉
the bear hands are called Grizzly, they're back scratchers! I've got a big version and I ADORE it
pete on painkillers is my new fav guest
The bear claw is to scratch your back
7:38 I love Mitsuboshi Colors a cute girls doing cute things anime. I love it so much that I watched it twice and seeing Ueno in real life was super awesome. The anime takes place in that particular district when I saw the sign, the temple, the marketplace, the park, etc, I was just shock how faithful that the anime is to the location.  Going to be on my list of place to make a pilgrimage in for sure.
3:00 why th is there a nazi sign on the stick? lol
That jacket is dope AF.
I recently moved to Tokyo and it's been overwhelming but super fun! I do need more friends here and it's tough because I only speak basic Japanese
I'm always happy to see Peter <3
I love you two guys together, please make more videos together!!!
my sincerest congratulations to pete for walking the entirety of tokyo in a day. we're all so proud of you bud
can you tell Joey and Aki and your gf that we can see the sniff sniff in the vids lmao
Would love to just see a timelapse of the walk itself done in a irl stream style
I love how Abroad in Japan turned into lowkey Chris' fitness flex
Where’s your boyfriend, Chris?
screaming in neurodivergency bc I just realized something in this video 😂
1983 representin
Surprised, neither of them knew the bear claw was a back scratcher.
NOTHING WRONG WITH JAPANESE SKYSCRAPERS!
Chris, you look great!
I feel sad that the sega logo has been replaced by Genshin Impact
As noted in the video, Pete's jacket is just amazing. Need one for myself!
UMMM JAPAN IS STILL LEADING THE TECHNOLOGICAL FRONT FOOL!
Beautifully shot. Lots of great scenery and imagery.
16:40 - Surely that was meant to say 500,000 commuters, not 5,000, yeah?
I was waiting for "we need to get some food" - didn't wait long, hahahah!
Im so proud of this chonky boy getting fitter and fitter every video.
Pete is only your 3rd best American friend?  Ludwig had better not be 1st or 2nd. That would be an insult to an honest man like Pete.
Best YouTube channel by a long stretch TBH! Great episode!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whenever I see PremiereTwo Pete in a video I get as excited as his ADHD makes him. It must be contagious.
Pete used to be a bit much for me but I've really come around on his, uh, energetic personality. The glasses thing where he offers a squeeze on his gorilla sack had me dying
Chris is smart.  He started with Journey Across Japan, and as he's a bit older it's Journey Across (city name).  When he's 40 it will be Journey Across The Street followed by @50, Journey Across The Living-room. In all seriousness though Chris, I love your videos for the content, humour and production quality.  Cheers  p.s.  I'm not sure Pete is American.  His self deprecating humour is more English or Canadian.  WHichever, he's fun to have along.
Favorite American Maid. 😆  Half way: THAT’s IT?!!!! 😆😆😆  Thoroughly enjoyed The Chris & Pete Show. More collabs, please!
Hi Chris. This was such a good idea! Love Tokyo! And good to see Pete again 😁. Maybe next time you could walk through Kyoto...or Nara? Keep up the amazing work!
The extendable bear claw is a great back scratcher.
I thought Risotaro was there too, in a white shirt.
What? No Spider Trash merch? Oh well, great video! Love seeing fellow fly-over state American Pete!
24:50 among us!
Damn Chris, I haven't watched your stuff in a while so I was taken aback by how well you're looking! Good on you!
Hang on. Tokyo station. 4,000 trains per day. 5,000 people per day. That doesn't sound right.  5,000 per hour, maybe.
Yeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeah 😎💪🙏
This is fun keep up the series.
There is hardly anything in life I want more than to explore Tokyo (or Japan in general) at night. I hope I can one day.
It is good to see you back in Japan and great to have tourists and fans meeting you guys. Really brings back the old vibes ❤️
Pete why DID YOU BUY MR MIME when you said your reason for hating it, should have gotten a pikachu
Another great video! Loved learning how to blow cassino!
I fricken love Pete
I too love Ameyoko Market, for the reasons you've just stated.  p.s A very entertaining video
I actually own that exact bear claw back scratcher
Eiffel Tower is SO much better than Tokyo Tower... I'll have to take it up with Mr Mime
And for the second day: Imperial Palace, Tokyo Dome, Ikebukuro, Shinjuku
Aehm, Chris .. While Tokyo Station is busy and in the top 10 list but Shinjuku Station is the busiest
Pete's such a good sport on camera! He's got the golden combination of stage presence to be funny, and humility to keep things professional! Thanks for bringing him along Chris!
4000 trains and 5000 commuters? I think they could reduce the number of trains
This was a fun video, glad to see you getting right back on the grind after a holiday and the like. Plus a good choice to feature one of my favorite guests you know in Pete.
This is exactly how I see my one and only visit to Japan happening. I was lucky enough to visit Paris on a 'study trip' with uni, our course, ceramics was an add on to the fashion and textiles course trip. I ditched my classmates on the first morning because all they wanted to do was cram as many museums and galleries in as possible for a 3 day trip. I decided that was epically stupid and took my trusty 3 day metro ticket and explored the city. Zero regrets, except Notre Dame, that was just a glorified church and BORING AF. I walked up the Eiffel Tower because the q for the lift was LONG. But all in all I had the funnest first experiences of Paris ever. There was literally ONE museum/gallery I wanted to see and it was open for 3hrs a day, Brancusi's Workshop. I saw it, and spent nearly 3hrs just soaking in a master's studio workshop. I Saw the Louvre from the Eiffel and decided that was enough. I saw the Arc De Triumph from La Defence and thought 'cool, seen that then' and just went on enjoying La Defence which is a stupendous space for remarkable buildings. Exploring is awesome. Thankyou for this video
I like this new format. It keeps a nice pace, goes through multiple places and there's some interesting characters. Pete, of course is always a joy to have. The trio (Pete, conner and Chris) are some of the best best trio irl stuff I've ever seen so this, by extension brings me similar levels of joy.
:)
You went for the Highball when Hibiki 21 was sitting there?
Some of my favorite memories from my trip to Japan in 2019 are just walking around the streets and seeing the sights of Tokyo with my best friend. Theres so much i did and so much i still want to do to. Ill be back one day and hopefully i can run into chris or someone while im at it.  P.S. does anyone know how to get a hold of one of those boss coffee jackets? I NEED one
"Love Booze Weak"....priceless  Can either you Mr. Broad  or Pete advise where can one get figurines either from gaming or anime?  Thank you for letting me know about Super Potato.
That Mr. Mine sound is the cutest thing ever 😍😂
LOVE this video concept. It would be awesome if you did more like this!
16:06 Tokyo Station is actually modeled after Amsterdam Central Station. That's why it looks so "western"; it's because it IS.
Safest, best, interesting, clean, fun, value, culinary city to walk in the free world. Nothing come close.
Felt like promo video for the old videos .Glad that finally more then 30mins long!
Wow, I could do that walk in 7 to 8 hours. But you guys stopped a lot.
7:15 if your password is 1234, you deserve to get hacked xD
Why not Kayak across Tokyo, there's planty waterways.
Man I love Pete in your videos. I wish he uploaded some videos himself or at least stream highlights
Chris should write Pete into his inheritence as a son, dude has rizz
GIGO. 15 minuites could save you 15% or more on car insurance.
“Stressed? Squeeze on my little gorilla sack” got me good man w that accent.
So I legitimately have one of those extendable bear hand back scratcher things, there's at least one customer out there, even if I got it off Amazon rather than such a mad store.
Loved this video, really felt like a brief vacation out of everyday life! Also it's always so fun to see Pete in your videos!
i played ghostwire toyko recently. a decent game, but this tour brought home actually where the game took place.
5000 commuters passing through it per WHAT?
Um… 16.48 only 5,000 commuters a day on 4,000 trains? Them’s some empty trains! Or the trains are veeeery small…
Really fantastic video guys. I sincerely wish I'd get to experience travelling there someday.
thumbnail is heavily edited to make Chris thin . this toxic
Is it just me or is Mr. Broad looking very good and healthy lately the guy looks a lot younger than he did a few vedios ago
Pete is an underrated character, it's about time he got his screen time
Love the video and thrilled it had Pete in it.  You two today are perfectly balanced comedy!
If i asked a taxi driver to take me to Akihabara, I'd be worried that I'd misspronouned when I ended  up in Aokigahara.
Osaka next please!
That extendable bear hand is the best backscratcher I have ever owned!
What was the piece of music on the last section called?
Really Nice video! Enjoyed it very much. I got hyped to do something similar!
God I love Pete. He's one hell of a ray of positivity
Chris, you're looking good.
like for fried chicken
Ah a 20k walk, or 12.4 miles. Easy peazy.
Woooo new video! Great start to the week! 🙌
I'm pretty sure you swapped the camera or lens this time. Looks awesome and was an enjoyable video to watch. These video theme/type you should definitely keep up with!
I've done at least 15km everyday since i landed Wednesday
Awesome vid 👏🏽
we just got back from japan and watching this video brings back such awsome time together with my wife, thank yo chris keep up the good job
It feels weird watching your channel after having lived in Japan for a few months as an exchange student. Before, when I watched your channel everything was like a detached feeling of splendor and wonder, but now, I have context. I've been in these places, I understand them, I know where they are and how to get there via train or subway or walking, what the vibes are, and what it's like to really be there. So, if watching your videos before gave me a sense of unknown wonder, now it's like a warm sense of familiarity. Not sure what I want to say with this comment, but thanks for your videos Chris, they're always a treat!
My toxic trait is looking at a map and going "I can walk that" multiple times per day, culminating in a 27km walk across parts of osaka in one day.
i know chris said not to do the part between roppongi and shibuya but i might do this entire walk, it sounds really fun. might spread it over a few days
I definitely want to do this now that I have not travel back to Japan for long time next time I visit! Thank you for another awesome video~
Tokyo station is inspired by Dutch architecture 😉
Tokyo Explorer is like "I do this every day!"
10 bucks for strawberry on a stick? no, thanks
The extendable bear paw was the real highlight
I absolutely loved this video man. Just felt like such a chill hang out session. Little slice of life action. Really great stuff. I think we all enjoy seeing you as a person instead of just a host. And American Pete is a great dude.
Nah the videos are clearly scripted! How much are you paying that actor at 2:46 ???
Chris...Pete is worth more than being your Sherpa, especially at $20... You could at least do what ever other rich white guys do when scaling mt everest... Pay a local
"Just squeeze my gorilla sack" -Pete, 2023 LMAO oh Pete...
What a great video! Pete was the perfect compagnion. Love him!
Finally! An episode! Took you long enough.
Pete pays in full
hes gonna need a lot more than 2000 yen for Akihabara.
Never underestimate the value of an extendable back scratcher.
I wonder if they ever figured out the bear claws are back scratchers? Lol
today i learned: pete is turning 40 this year mans literally looks 25
22:25 is this the guy on connor stream? That Pete talked to at the Nordic bar...
Next STEP: Journey across Japan, a brisk walk
Wonderful.
YES!!!! more pete content
13:43 LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wait... Pete's... 40?
This was an absolute delight. 100 percent made me want to visit Tokyo at night. The photos alone would be worth it.
I loved this! Maybe you could walk the Kyoto temple stretch one day if you haven't already!
brb going to japan to get an extendable bear claw
this was a great way to keep the essence of the abroad in japan channel while incorporating fitness! this has inspired me to drag my friends across tokyo when we visit lol
typo, 3.6 million use Tokyo Station each day! :)
I enjoyed watching this video.
This is such a good idea: I am an "explore-on-foot" kinda person myself and find that tourist guides that have you hopping from subway to subway make me miss out on so much inbetween. Especially on all the food 😁
I was born '86 the year of the Tiger, I wonder if there are any shrines with the Tiger.... This looked like a blast but also super exhausting!
When American Pete is on the main channel, that's always a good video. And this walking/exploring concept is really nice.
SEGA IS GONE WHAT????
Loved the video!! 🤧
Gonna see some of this for myself in May! Thanks for the video Chris!
It’s still funny (in a good way) to see foreigners in Japan up to the same antics we all did over 20 years ago.  My friends and I would scheme ideas, themes, challenges or stupid human tricks every time we headed down to Tokyo or Osaka from Iwate where we lived.  We had theme parties like Spies and Disguise, 70s, Video Games, Aliens and then hit the town in costume.  Just a normal day for us 😁 Hapoy to say I’ve been everywhere you guys went in the video
I absolutely love American Pete, instant like from me
18:16  The Architect was studying in England when Queen Anne Style was new and popular (Scotland Yard as an example) so I believe he was inspired by Queen Anne style in the Uk.   I studied this building for my Architectural history paper in my last year of Uni :)
Yep, you can tell Chris is getting some… he’s uncharacteristically happy
@25:00 Pete is awesome hahaha
I love Pete, he's so kind no matter how shitty others talk to him. I like Chris, and Connor, and the like, but I don't know if they make it as a joke, as a pre-planned thing, or for real: they're not the nicest to Peter. During the biking/fund-raising Pete was so good at encouraging them and funny, and silly, but they shit on him one too many times. Like I need a video where Pete tells us if it's for real or they're doing it part of the script. When I heard the story of how he grew up, and the school stuff, I was like 'man, just give him a break!'. You know what video I'd like to see? Chris and Pete getting custom tailored suits. And then pretend they're business men and take all props pics in public, I'm thinking desk, scanner, landline phone, business cards, in the park. Like award/embarrassed in public but make it elegant.
I’m so happy Chris is finally collabing with his idol, PremierTwo
27:14 now kiss
Chris is looking more affable the more i watch him
19:44 Shimbashi really reminds me of Yakuza games, is the game based on it?
NOOO PETE HOW COULD YOU IGNORE THE AMONG US
I once walked from Harajuku to Shibuya lemme tell you, it was a whole bunch of nothing lmao
Blow Casino? But I barely know Casino. Can Casino at least buy me dinner first?
Too much Big Fried Chicken!?  B.  F.  C.  too much chicken!  too much chicken.
5000 commuters are passing through Tokyo main station? I assume thats a mistake and its actually like 500.000, right?
Great episode!
wait; when you say you got a Mr.Mine staring at you over the Camera 17:39 Were you talking about the stylish pack mule (Pac-mule) with the *Hat* or *Bariyado* (original name)
Always a good day when Abroad In Japan has an upload 👌
Hot take: The Tokyo station area looks so cool because of the contrast between the station itself with the crystal towers of modern architecture. I honestly think it would not be as cool without the new Tokyo around it.
Your videos are always so good!! Keep it up!!
I have a bear hand back scratchier
Ueno has a zoo too. Make a video of Pete at a Hostess bar. Lol Terrible that they replaced the Sega building. What is GiGO? I used to go to a hip hop club in Roppongi back in the 90s but it got shut down. There used to be a lot of よぱらい fighting on the streets in Roppongi.
The SEGA building now looks like a knockoff that would be used in anime to avoid copyright infringement 😂
😅 yooo Peter I'm boar too 😍
This channel really has become my comfort channel whenever I feel a bit down, it always brightens up my day, thank you for everything Chris !
This video was fun
30000 steps is fuckin brutal...
Thank you for doing this. I’m preparing for trip to Japan and it’s difficult to really understand distances or cost only from Google.
25kms is suppose to take like 3-5hrs max but i guess you did take a lot of stops and breaks and sight seeing
RIP SEGA building I hardly knew thee 😭
1.2 commuters per train?
The Gigo building just feels like watching an anime where people have a Sany tv.
You look really slim!! Keep up the pace on you self improvement!!
Your extendable bear claw is a back scratcher
YOU ARE FANTASTIC ❤
i think that i kinda love pete
30:41 really, Chris? Did living that long in the nihon make you lose your britishness?
Did you know there is a Tanuki shrine on the perimeter of Sensoji?
How is Pete 10 years older than me but looks the same age 🤔
I cant believe they made the store from yakuza in real life😰
only 4k trains and 5k commuters in tokyo station? That appears to be too low a number o3o
You need to do this more!!
fantastic video! great to see you walk across Tokyo, great way to experience any place :)
I'm finally making my dream trip to Japan on September.  Starting in Tokyo right across to Hiroshima for 2 weeks stopping at Takayama, kyoto, osaka, and some other stops. Pretty nervous but can't wait.
Didn’t know Conner was in the video
Hilarious seeing the extendable bear claw mentioned as I extend my extendable rake to scratch my back with.  (I would much rather have a bear claw, but apparently Canadian odds and ends don't have the same degree of character.  But it is, most certainly, a back scratcher.)
He is like a skinny Chris Farley.
I am so happy you are back!!! Hope you had an amazing vacation.
Can someone tell me what is that jacket Chris is wearing? I know it's some type of bomber jacket but I can't find anything that looks similar to that fabric.
Ame here means America not candy. They trade American goods, canned foods and cigarettes after WWII.
How can Pete be attractive even though he dresses like a 13 year old
Absolutely loved this one! Pete is a treasure!
I have that exact extendable bear hand back scratcher from @24:37, let me tell you it's worth it to have around!
great music and pacing, thanks for the awesome vid
nice f
Awesome video! Thank you Chris and Pete! :)
Wait, I recognize that symbol on the incense stick at 3:01 🤔
Why does chris look like a schoolboy in the thumbnail lol
I’ve just gone back to Chris’s first video of ten years ago to compare the production values and his Japanese experiences. It’s interesting to go back.
I like Pete. I wish we could see more of him.
What absolute dipshit said Mr. Mime was the worst Pokemon?
Glad you are back
Saw a comment like “this could be a series” as I started watching this, was doubtful but now ending this video, man I need a series, different guest, different areas, different experiences. We need this series!
Great video
Fantastic idea for a video!
😆 Poor Peat, every time we see him he has dropped a place in Chrises best American friend list. I actually have that same bear claw back scratcher, is really nice to have on your desk for when you get an itch
Going to Japan on Feb 9th and am so excited. Thanks for sharing so much of this intricate culture. I'll be arriving in Tokyo, but will actually be staying in Sendai. Maybe I'll see you around Chris ;).
Here in Honolulu, I do my grocery shopping at Don Quijote.
haha i knew i saw ryotaro at the start .. some reused footage? haha very nice vid antway, as always..
Absolutely love how after all the talk, and effort of getting into shape, the first video of 2023 has Chris eating Fried Chicken and demanding snacks within the first 5 minutes. Never change Broad.
Damn Chris you are looking fine, you are really getting at that healthier lifestyle! kudos!!
Amazing video thank you Chris
The eastern district near Tokyo Station used to be a residence of Jan Joosten, a Dutch adventurer served as a translator and consultant for Tokugawa Shogun in Edo period. That's why it's believed that Tokyo Station is made to resemble Dutch architecture :)
Great video! What fun! Definitely will try to take this route if/when I ever make it to Japan.
I actually have an extendable bear hand. It is a really good back scratcher.
24:26 that is a backscratcher, so yeah I would've been one of those 8 people that would have bought a bear hand.
That Mr Mime is adorable.
The Boss jacket caught my eye to be fair! Need to get one of those! Was addicted to that stuff when I was over there...  Great Vid lads!
Only 5,000 commuters passing through Tokyo station? I think you wanted to say 500,000.
I enjoyed this. Instead of the normal humor with riotoro or anyone else you guys just talked and had good conversation while explaining things. Liked this format. Ofc there was humor but it felt more natural
19:38 is a shot that looks so incredibly familiar and I just can't really place why. It reminds me of cyberpunk (the genre, not the game), just "Japan" and also it's somehow very soothing, despite how "busy" it looks?  It's stuff like that that reminds me how Chris is actually pretty damn good with a camera.
God this makes me want to come back to Japan so bad. I went there with my sister and my mom on 2020 (before COVID got serious) for 30 days, we travelled across the whole country and averaged like 20km. walked per day! I think just walking is one of the best things you can do in Japan. We enjoyed it so much and got some of our best memories there. Best trip of my life.
I remember when people were freaking out about Tim Tams because someone realised they have a tiny amount of alcohol in them as a preservative or whatever. You'd have to eat your bodyweight every hour for a day to get drunk so I doubt the biscuits will put you over the line.
Adorable.
Not sure about others, but I am subscribed to this channel, but it does not appear in my subscription tab... I would not have known Chris put out a new video, but it popped up in my home page when I refreshed.
So in Ameyoko you can get Johnny Depp's famous Mega Pint?
I'm always impressed by how well the Japanese rebuilt Tokyo after Godzilla destroyed it multiple times.
How about Ueno to Jūjō?
Is this the first time his done a sponsorship? Like I never see a video with a sponsorship segment
One of my favorites. Great scriptwriting!
Loved watching this!!
I see pete i like as simple as that
Does anyone know the name of the song played during the Tokyo Tower section??
You've got to give Pete a big trip this year, poor sods about to have the birthday we all dread, not sure on which City to pick next, maybe do a pull a name out of a hat?
This is probably my favorite Abroad in Japan video. I would have loved to have gone on the walk with you, and it would be a blast to spend the day with Pete... And the big fried chicken...
Chris says that there are 4000 trains that arrive every day at the train station, with over 5000 commuters passing through daily. So if my math's is right, that's 1.25 people per train.
Pete!!
Just landed yesterday. Needed this video Chris
Really reaally enjoyed this video. And Pete! What a guy! I’d want to be friends with him!😁 Thanks for the fun video Chris🎉
As an american peter is my favorite, right up there with natsuki and his english wisdom
Chris is looking great! Keep up the good work man!
Pete turning 40 this year. i wish i have that outlook on life when i reach it. God bless you Pete
9:19 not just a mega highball, that's a - that's THE - mega pint!
Fantastic video as always! Damn, that Suntory Whisky stand in Ameyoko looks amazing. I got a nice Yamazaki 12 year and Hibiki Harmony on the shelf here at home in the States, but it's hard to find and soooo expensive. This was a great whirlwind way to experience the city and one I how to embark on sometime in the not too distant future.   Happy New Year Chris and looking forward to another year of fantastic content!
Hey Chris, do a deep dive into the fabulous specialty coffee bars of Tokyo. Also Japanese listening bars!
I’m kind of glad you’ve accepted a sponsorship. Your content tends to be really high quality so if you can monetize it (aside from the standard YouTube monetization), go for it. You definitely deserve it.
Great video, as usual, but can I just say Chris looks better and leaner in recent days/weeks? For anyone who has given him hate/nonsense in prior videos, I like how he's basically giving a middle finger to them looking good.  Also going out of my way to get that fried chicken next time I'm in Tokyo.
Me and my son walked just over 30 miles on our first day in Tokyo. Averaged around 20 miles a day for the rest of the trip. So much to see and do.
You do know the extendable bear claw is a back scratcher right? Or you just pretending not to know? 😂
Extendable bear hand?... you mean the back scratcher? I've got one here, very handy.
15 miles that is quite the walk... ~
And the commercial that YouTube placed at the end of Chris's video.... a Chick-fil-A sandwich ad. How apropos.
This needs to be a series, different cities different guests and keeping the ¥2000 buying random things from each area 💕
Hopefully one day I'll get to experience Tokyo, Japan. One can dream. Great video Chris! :)
Lmao you know the Big Fried Chicken is big, when they have a designated eating area for it 😂
I've been to Askas Market. And Senhoji Temple before. I thought they looked familiar. The way you pronounce Askas sounds VERY DIFFERENT than the way my mother pronounces it. I didn't know what you said at first. I wished Pete purchased the love sunnies! They were awesome! NO CHICKEN IN THE END MEAL? WOT?
3:35 "Stop killing the birds" while queueing for fried chicken lol
Loved the video and im a little bit sad that Chris aged so much over the years 😭 (and therefore us too)
one of your best video's yet
Pete is just the best
'83 gang,  rise up!
That viewer you guys met in Roppongi is so british ‘oh my days’ ‘I can’t lie’ 😭
The bear claw is a backscratcher
Hey Chris, love this video. Has a lot of potential to be a series. Would be cool if you did an IRL stream of this while shooting on Pete’s twitch and then a bite sized video for your channel. I’m sure I’m not alone when I say it’d be entertaining to see you and Pete just walk for hours.
Why does Chris look like a kid in the thumbnail and like a 50yo in the actual video
Such a shame that the Sega building was rebranded. It was iconic
I loved this new series and I can't wait to see where you're going next 😊
Always puts a smile on my face when I see a new AiJ video
I can’t tell if they know that the bear claw thing is a back scratcher lol
those cyberpunk shots from Shimbashi makes me want go play CP77 now
30k steps is like 3 miles right?
No CN Tower love, sadge.
So much care went into the editing of this video, and it had such a great payoff! I just started learning how to edit, and I feel like this video is so impressive
I own an extendable bear claw, its a back scratcher - no regrets
Wake up babe! New Abroad in Japan video dropped!
This might just be the greatest video ever uploaded on this channel!!! And this comes from someone who has watched most of the videos at least a half a dozen times so far lol.
I love Pete, such a nice wholesome dude.
Fun fact.  Tokyo is about 40 square km in size and has 37 million people. Canada is almost 10 million square km in size with just less population. It took Chris 12ish hrs to walk part of Tokyo, where it would take 16-18 months to walk from the west coast of Canada to the east coast. That's over 13,000 hrs. of just walking, no breaks, over 5,500 km. And he had food stalls every few blocks... Not so in Canada.  LOL, Take care.
I'm heading to Japan this May. Going to spend 2 complete days in Tokyo before heading to Kyoto to hike the Nakasendo Way, back to Tokyo. I plan to walk everywhere in Tokyo and this video has given me some ideas - thanks!
This was fun. More please 👍
At 12:40 , he made a good point there. Tokyo is more accessible and liveable than US cities.
1983 "old man" - and I took that personally...
Sure it’s a back scratcher 😂
More videos with Pete, I love this guy
2:46 sumimasen Pigeon-san!
Pete's got drip.... drip coffee!   I'll see myself out.
Pete is amazing! Always genuine and fun! Joey and Connor used to be fun but nowadays they come across as full of themselves..  hope they go back to being genuine and fun
Omfg that bear claw back scratcher is sitting on my coffee table rn 🤣🤦‍♀️
Chris does not realize that the extensible bear claw is a back scratcher because he hires people for that sort of thing.
So did you really manage to add an extra 10km of walking around at each location you filmed?  That is a lot to add on to a 15km walk.
My Favourite Part? When Chris spilled his hard earned beer in the outro 😂🌊
The bear hands are back scratchers if you didn't know. They are great :)
Best use of money in Nakamise St is the curry agemanju!
I would be so happy to meet these two.  Chris has deepened my appreciation for Japan, and Pete has been one of the best dopamine dealers around, making me laugh so hard.  Thanks for the video, really enjoyed it!
This is the best video I've seen so far this year, thank you for this Chris & Pete! :) I'm looking forward to do this exact same route as well one day when I get to visit Tokyo.
3:01 hehe the funny symbol
This dude is like a Golden Retriever, in the most positive way possible.
Um.... 3:02
not gonna lie, i would love watching you walk from point to point in realtime fully unedited
Great video, but yes, you eat KitKats like a psychopath
Does Pete play World of Warcraft? @4:50 he says "POWER OVERWHELMING"
As the proud(??) owner of an extendable bear hand - they are rather good at getting those hard to reach spots on your back for a scratch. Loved the video! ❤
30:44 wth did that monke go through...
Very nice. I'm somewhat of a walker myself.
"Pause for a moment and enjoy the sheer beauty of the temple" while looking what looks like the back of Ryotaro's head. Chris inadvertently complimenting his handsome foe 😂
Oh man, it's a shame the Pete lost his Mr Mime during the video and had to purchase another one :p hehe
LOVE how he flipped the cheeky mean british sh*t "SCREW UR TACOS" lmfao. Also completely agree about the appeal of walkable cities
man when i get to japan i want to find that boss coffee jacket
Love the subtle cameo by ryotaro at 1:49 !
well you can see they had a great day and thank you for showing tokio by foot and i really did not think tokio was THAT large
American Pete is endlessly entertaining!
I think you should walk other routes in Tokyo, was good
The petting at the end 😂😂😂 (it's supposed to be a back scratcher btw)
Bro the extendable bear hand is a back scratcher 💀
Very cool journey through Tokyo!!!  Very Very Cool!!!
Hell, I'd gladly accompany you walking across Tokyo, seemed like so much fun!
I remember taking the bicycle from Asakusa to Akihabara and Ueno Park during my time in Tokyo. I felt incredibly safe when riding in the evening. There were little shops on the way where I could stop and take a look, got some nice cutlery from Kappabashi and found a cute bakery with Anpan from "The Wind Rises".
Did Chris and Pete not realize the "extendible bear claw" was a backscratcher?
Love and respect
31:21 / 31:21
Damn. David's looking good for 38/39. Still looks like he's in his early 30s. I assumed he was a good 10-20 years younger than Chris.
Actually got one of those extendable bear paws in my Christmas stocking
I have the extendable bear paw, great for back scritches I can't reach! 😅
24:16 "You name it, they got it"  My brain: It's just like, it's just like, a mini mall
What is a gigo :/
Pete is 40??? He ages very well
I hope they finally realize the bear claw is a back scratcher
checked in to rewatch some of your old videos this morning and u posted LFGGG
Very natural, wholesome, homoerotic; keep it up.
Chris: This video is not scripted. Also Chris: *keeps giving Pete money and telling him how to spend it*
Loved this so much, and i love Pete too! Would love to see this again with Connor, Kaho, Natsuki and other people you hang out with tbh
Would you stop constantly misrepresenting how many people Tokyo is? It's big enough without the exaggeration.
@16:43 surely there are more than 5000 commuters on those 4000 trains
Pete brings a certain fun and innocence, to these videos. Maybe it's his constant upbeat attitude that seems in such contrast to Chris, who plays the serious man, but the combination cannot be denied - it's great fun!
I Had to Laugh at the shot with the Giant building behind tokyo tower just makig it seem tiny even tho it isnt.
An appearance from Ryotoro! And love the BOSS coffee jacket
Hahah Pete please marry me your literally my soul mate 🤣❤️
Nooo. you missed out on one of the best experiences ever...That gorilla hand is a back scratcher and they are soo satisfying getting to that itch you cant just quite reach. I've got one but it's boring and just looks like a fork, that one is awesome.
Just went to Tokyo station today for the first time! Hooters Ginza!
Good thing CDawgVA wasn't in this video. Those fans showing up would have ended differently.
At least Chris is _paying_ Pete to be his pack mule! Probably a very LOW pay for the amount of work, but it's something...
how were your feet after
Chris just refreshed his British accent I think
Horray a new vid! Sunday is not shit today.
At 16:45 you said that 5000 passengers depart every day from tokyo station, I'm assuming you meant something like 500 000?  edit: I looked it up and yeah, about half a million people use tokyo station each day, which, assuming every hour of the day is equally busy (I guess it's busier during the day?), would mean that at any hour, 20 000 people are passing through the station, with 347 people leaving and arriving each minute on average.
The thing with the Skyscrapers is that the Companies designed them and made them, and they really all share a common look everywhere on the planet so the fact there is nothing original to it is just really because its been made by Companies and not Japan Government or somone else, Sure some companies are exceptions but most arent.
Please more videos like this !!!!!
Blackpool Tower is the best tower
Fried Chicken and Whiskey, no better way to start the day
1:50 it cracks me up that Chris is like "admire the sheer beauty of the temple" and you have Risottoro in the shot 🤣
16:45 Sorry to be the buzzkill, Chris, but I'd guess those 4,000 trains bring in 5,000,000 people (instead of 5,000)
Pete in a hippie glasses was fucking hilarious.
BRUH I HAVEN'T WATCHED YOUR VIDEOS FOR A FEW MONTHS WHAT IS THIS YOU LOST SO MUCH WEIGHT JESUS CONGRADS
Another great video Chris. Lots of interesting suggestions of places to visit,  especially the whole concept of doing them on foot rather than relying on public transport. As for ideas for future walks, how bout a bar/pub crawl through Tokyo during the course of a day, meeting up with various friends/ fellow YouTube creators, who could introduce you to their favoute pub/bar/nightclub drink? As the night progresses you go from daytime drinking in pubs to early morning nightclub? Would be worth watching of only to see the state of you at the end. OH, Only pub snacks allowed ie roast peanuts & stale crisps!
an adventure would love to take on one day
lol, you say 20km, write 25km on screen, and google maps plotted along your shown route says about 15km.
I saw a guy biking 100km making a circle around Tokyo. This was fun as well.  And pretty much doable, considering your previous history with biking around Japan.
Not going to lie, I read the title as walking across Japan.😉😁😉  🤜🏻🤛🏻
Pete just lights up every room he is in. Love him and love this new concept for a series.
Having a Mega Pint.
Chris, you do a great job filming, are these trips as fun as you make them look? It looks really fun
An interesting fact for you, the skyscrapers are so similar to each other as they are build for earthquakes and typhoons. I was in one once there when a typhoon hit!
Extendable Bear Claw = back scratcher... I have two of those exact items from a trade show in Canada.
Man that is just amazing the only place I ever goes fun the park🙂🙂🎇🎆✨️✨️✨️🎆 oh and I'm playing Super Smash Bros
Wow, you're such a youtube chris!
I have that bear hand as a back scratcher.
3:14 Where can I get one of those Boss Coffee jackets?!?! Much want!
WE PAY IN FULL
Fortune and a coin with a hole - In Japanese the character for 'hole' can be traced back to the character that was used to represent - Sunya in Sanskrit - Meaning potential, the void, emptiness...
Yay Pete, Gang of 83!
Watching this right now, in Ginza loooooool
Honestly that's basically roman military march
After a LONG wait i'm finally coming to japan in April! Can't wait to get lost in Tokyo for a day.
Great fun! I loved the Super Potato store, I was in my 30s during the 1980s, living in NYC, and Japanese stuff was everything: Japanese film festivals, restaurants, arts festivals, anime, games, etc. I had a Japanese friend who explained stuff to me, it was great. The store brought it all back. Wasn't a big Pete fan before (he's a bit too American for this American), but this video turned that around. How about a walk around Kyoto?
YouTube stopped recommending you. Had to dig to find this gem. Ready for 2023!
Hey Chris. Loved the video. I've started my own fitness journey, though I have a lot further to go as a very obese American man. Even so, it's inspiring to see you become so active to stay in good health. I feel a little more compelled to do the same.
9 AM start is so late lol
Looking good chris. Keep up the good work
I like this Pete guy.
Ay Pete! '83 here with you!
Omg this was hilarious! More walking videos with American Pete please!
im only a year behind pete! 1982! lets go!
I really do live vicariously through these videos, always something new and interesting to learn from you guys. Hope to see many more videos in the future!
Chris looks noticeably slimmer here! Great job!
Holy Chris, its not just the lighting and camera angle anymore you're looking a lot better! Keep up the gains 💪💪💪
Pete, 1983....best year....I am with ya, old man! 💪🏻😉
4000 trains per day in Tokyo Station? And 5000 commuters per day? Really? 😀
Is Yuji Naka still in jail?
That extendable bear hand is a back scratcher! I own one and it’s so clutch. Actually now that I realize it, I don’t know where mine is. Damn. Feeling kind of itchy right now.
I see a lot of foreign and tourist people walking down on the city. A thought that Japan was still close to foreigners due to the Covid.  I'm glad it's not like this anymore!
What a great video! So good to see you back in Tokyo!
Will Japan ever get back to a normal life? I.e.: stop wearing face diapers?
Enjoyed this very much, thanks for the great video Chris and Pete!
today im gonna starve myself
26:47 i really want to know the name of this song/soundtrack. if anyone knows pls help ^^
I like how Pete's always just happy to be there.
Chris looking very trim. Chancing it eating Big Chicken like that. Bear hand is a back scratcher.
This series is fucking brilliant mate! Please do make a it a series with american pete :)
How do I like 👍🏻 like a video now. Is that feature gone, in a different place?
This is a great idea and I look forward to seeing which other places you feature.
Need more adventures with Pete. Taken for Granted can wait lol
Chris, the "extendable bear hand" is actually a back scratcher noob. I have one and it's brilliant, for itchy back.
Well done chris, great content
Chris, wanted to say that you really broke through what needed to be done to get where you are in health and weight. Now the hardest part is to come. Keeping those habits and lifestyle in check to maintain it ❤️. Keep it going!
Being able to cover so much ground simply by walking (especially in the cool late-winter weather) is why Tokyo is my favourite travel destination. I'm looking forward to visiting it again in the near future.
I would have thought that Tokyo station serves more than 5000 people a day…
I would love if you and pete traveled together outside Japan and did this as a series
That was really fun. I really want to check out Shimbashi at night now! More videos with Pete please :)
Chris you should try that giant Melon-pan place there. We were recently in Asakusa and really enjoyed our time there and trying some of the food vendors.
Yay, Chris you look happy and healthy! Keep it up friend!
lol great video
Pete is spot on about just how nice it is to be available to walk places versus having very little within walking distance here in America unless you're in a big city. It's very isolating so I spent most of my vacation in Tokyo just walking the streets because I had the freedom to do so.
I've yet to visit Japan, and now I'm quite saddened that by the time I do visit, the Sega Building will have been long-gone. There goes one of my bucket-list items...
Thanks for another great video!
Pete is such a fun dude to do a urban journey with, you legends (both of you) should do more journeys together.. BTW,  Is it odd that the back of Ryotaro's head has become so recognizable I spotted him at 1:42? Thinking of starting up a FB page for "The back of Ryotaro's head."
when I was a student, I was walking 20 km everydays
I was in Tokyo over Christmas and it was a mistake to walk to akihabara from shibuya and back. Its like 8 miles each way but very fun and interesting along the way and also got the chance to streamsnipe Tokyo lens
I would love to see a series of this
Awesome video man I really really wanna go there sometime
I have one of those ‘bear claws’ they’re back scratchers and very good!
GREAT Video guy's, this should be a new series.... Pete was a GREAT choice for this but it'd been good with any of the guy's, and each wouldve been different, love to see more chap! Nothing makes me want to visit Japan more than your vids !👍👏🤙🖖🤘✌👌😊
so beautiful
'King of Fighters' a man of class
25k flat? Most people can run that in 2:30 hours... It's like a 5h walk... What's the challenge?
A dude with long hair, beard, a beanie and a pokemon plushie strapped to his backpack. For the locals that must look like a walking cliche of a western tourist.  Very nice video, I hope I can visit Japan finally this year.
When Pete references his birth year, immediately gets called an old man... and you were born the year before that ☠
What a day!
Love this format. More please!  Now I miss Tokyo even more...
Wow adventure island in super potato
Great video! Looks like you guys had an awesome time! I did a short walk around Tokyo when meaning to walk from my hotel to Asakusabashi to Akihabara, I took a wrong turn, and got lost, wandering around Yanagabashi for about 45 minutes before finally making it to Akihabara. Still I got to see part of the city I might not have seen otherwise.
Welcome back! Looking forward to what you have in store.
As someone that was born in 83, I was surprised when Pete said he was as well. Happy 40th Pete! You are still looking great.
What a journey! It was neat seeing all the different street markets. Thank you for making the trek to share with us :)
How has Pete became the third???
28:15  CHRIS OMG STOP. I CANT WATCH THIS WTFFFFFFFFFFF
Finally… best videos on YouTube. Thank you for making my day 😊 Faboulousssssssss❤
24:40 I have that exact Bear Claw and it make the best back scratcher ever
So excited to go to japan for my first time this summer
The extendable bear claw is a back scratcher 😂
Chris looks so fit, truly a Ripped in Japan moment
January: I tried walking across tokyo in a day  September: I tried walking across Japan in a month
W video chris 🙌🙌
"Squeeze on my little gorilla-sack" sounds like a Natsuki-ism more than a Pete-ism
Pete  is the friend everyone needs.
i must say the B roll shots of Ameyoko Market and Shimbashi where really my favourite. I would love to see a longer video of just B roll style video. just that atmosfeer is magical.
8:21 that's either someone walking with her daddy, or someone walking with her ''daddy''...
I have many of those bear claw back scratchers, and my dad has em too bahahaha so there you go. They rock by the way.
How about a day (or a trip to) Ghibli Park?
i think Pete is your most optimistic and happy guest. then comes Natsuki, then Joey, and then it's a tie between Connor and Ryotoro for...something other than most happy and optimistic.
I like Pete reminds of this guy I went to highschool with everyone enjoyed his company friends with everyone but outside of school no one talked to him.
So much soy
Really fun watching this! :)
Big up 1983, I'm with you Pete! :)
The Boss Coffee jacket is some serious drip ☕
I actually tried this a few years ago.  Of course, I picked the day of a typhoon.  Your way's much better, Chris.
Pete is better than Connar
My walk would start from Takarazuka Sky Stage to the Cup Noodle museum in Ikeda, to Tsubaki Ryokan on route 171 where Lord Asano Naganori stayed every year from 1697 to 1701 when he offed himself, on to Umeda Sky building for a nice view, then across the Yodogawa to Shinsaibashisuji, Dotonbori and Namba. Amerikamura has a wonderful guitar shop called 2nd Street near the outdoor stage, and on the other side of the intersection is a sweet shop called Ikki Kasuteira where you can get a nice ice cream sundae.
didnt knew Chris is actually Mr Beast
Leave it to Chris to take a video premise pioneered by the live streamers and turn it into an epic YouTube offering. If Connor's live stream walkabout recaps don't start emulating this level of editing, then really, what is he doing with his life.
Wonderful content as always Cris! 🫶 Love seeing Pete again in your videos.  Also, is this guy 22:21 the one in Connor's IRL stream in one of the bars they went to?
That "extendable bear claw" is a back scratcher 😂 so it's actually pretty useful!
16:49 - "5000 commuters a day" - surely you mean an hour? I've read that Toyko Station has over a million passengers per day, which is 41000 per hour!
Nice of Chris to take his large American son out to spend his pocket money
I'm with you! 1983 right here
I don't know if its just my eyes or what, but nin the beginning when Chris and Pete are walking through the streets, just after the intro, I am seeing a lot of ghosting in the video footage... was there moisture on the lens of the camera that you were using? Were you using a GoPro and, if so, which GoPro were you using? What about a DJI? have you looked into those?
You can complain about trash, or pick it up and dispose of it, they both take about the same effort.
83 line in the house! We're both old, Pete. Great video,  Chris! Looking forward to the rest of the series.
If this wasn't inspired by Craig Mod's work, Chris and everyone watching this should check out Craig's work
Pete is an absolute golden retriever
There's nothing better than an Abroad in Japan video perfectly timed for lunch.
More videos with Pete please! His charisma is off the charts and its always a pleasure to see you two interact!!
I cannot like this video more. Where is the ultra like button.
I was so excited to see this posted this morning! Thanks again Chris!
Seeing videos like this always makes me miss walking around Japan.
22:28 ey thats the paid actor from the CDAWGVA stream that Pete totally recognized haha
Pete is such an amazing company
American Pete's enthusiasm is infectious (in the best way). I've really come to appreciate his energy. Really enjoyed the video, Chris. All the best.
Has Chris always had engorged spaghetti veins in his neck or did he start TRT? 😂
Love booze weak
Nice windcheater, Pete!
Lol Daniel from Daniel and yuka walked the entire yamanote line while live stream with a gimbal on one hand and an iPad on other hand to read the chats (the prism that day was broke so he had to read the chats from his iPad)   It took him 15 hours!  Not to discredit your walk chris and Co.
Pete is funny. Gotta see more of him!
Even though the video is 30 mins long, I enjoyed it every bit. The videos are becoming more and more entertaining and funny. Cheers to Pete for keeping up with Chris.
The great thing is that you could spend all day in any one of these places and still have a full day.
5k commuters a day?  Isn't it more?
Back in the late 90s one of my favourite ways to spend a Sunday was to start early at Ebisu station and see how far around the yamanote line I could walk before i was exhausted or the day ended.   One day I'll make it all the way round
Personally I'd love to see one of these videos on Osaka, but if there's any city you consider to be underrated I'd like to see that too.
I liked that Peter quoted the Protoss Archon from the original Starcraft when he received 2000 Yen.
16:46 is a mistake. It should be 500,000.
It really shows now that Chris has gotten healthier. Not only has he lost weight his skin looks better and.. is it just me or does he look happier?
So... Chris eats KitKats the same way I do.
This was great. Nice 2023 kickoff.
Suntory Whisky for relaxing times. Pete knows megadrinks. SEGA buildings are now GiGo. Good that Peter kept his head and bought something from Akihabara! Extendable bear is good when you need to retrieve something from difficult location (and you can customize it with magnet). There is something in Pete's action and manners, which make me smile!
My legs started to hurt watching this
I think going to a mountain area and walking to an onsen would be pretty cool
i'm 1982, a doggo
Looking great Mr. Affable!
People say it’s scripted because you’re both actually far more articulate and quick witted than the average bears. Take it as a compliment . Great vid guys keep up the good work
i am very happy pete is helping these small content creators like chris and connor.
Ngl, this is way cooler than it seems, I would love to walk across tokyo
"Heres an american to accompany me!" Literally 30 seconds later *A wild risotoro appears*
You boys look really fresh after "walking" all day.  Who does your makeup ?
The guy next to Pete seems cool.
Holy shit u look like a different man in the thumbnail props to you
Chris knew better than to invite Risottorō to accompany him across Tōkyō... There would be ninja plotting death strikes around every last corner of the entire city!
1:45 - I thought the man in the striped white t-shirt was Ryotaro EDIT: that was indeed Ryotaro, Chris was reusing an old clip for this video
Chris you're looking amazing keep up the hard work
Love this video style, always love Pete's excitable cheerful character that tried too hard to be cynic, snide, and complaining Brit. Tokyo station area (Nihonbashi, Kyobashi, Yaesu, Marunouchi) - where I work and where I stayed. The station itself is Meiji Japan building, the Marunouchi is simply Manhattan or Milton Keynes-like, very bland, very corporatey of early 2000s. But everything interesting like most of Tokyo's old area, are underground.
I actually have some of those 'claw' back scratchers.  I decided I was getting old when I ordered them, but MAN it's great for giving an odd spot on your back a good scratchin'.
Oh dude, id never guess he's older than me, but only barely. 1984 here. Still about half the life of the planet less than risottoro.
I like a good walk! 😎✌️
28:33 xD
Loved the video Chris! The scenery was amazing. It makes me want to try doing it too. This definitely deserves to expanded upon in a future series!
Chris you're looking great, man. Hard work is clearly paying off!
Chris embracing his ancestral roots
Pete, the glasses were fabulous o/
Chris Broadstein strikes again 🍻
I could have sworn I saw Ryotaro at the beginning of the video.  Great vid as always!
favorite video to date because I love walking around cities!
Cool video, fantastic picture quality and very Blade Runnerian(?)vistas. Beautiful. I am also as old as that other dude....absolutely horrible that his bear is showing some grey already. Good god.
Is it me, or does Chris looks 15 years younger in this video? It's like he's 35 again!
THANKS CHRIS, this is what I needed...  I hope  itbecomes a series!!
Planning to go around Kyushu in March so if you could walk around there before I arrive it would be much appreciated 😜 Great video as always Chris
*Look where that got you plays in the intro* The one thing that was missed
𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐥𝐨𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐭 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞😂😂😂😂
Pete is going down on the best american friends list every time XD
Respect to Pete for wanting a KOF figure. A great series. Also sad about the Sega building, first it was NeoGeo land then Anata no Warehouse. Also the Gigo arcade(building 4 in Akihabara) is closed as well. It's a shame.
Lol. I'd love to have seen Charla on this adventure, but clearly an American pack mule was the superior choice
this reminds me of me and my friends walking one edge of the city to other in highschool. It had started as a joke but ended up something we do at least once a year. it was around 45km in total and would took us like 10 hours or smt. This video encourages me to get back to that old habit lol.
17:27 Japanese modern architecture is probably the most exciting and radical example. But you’d be forgiven for if you only saw corporate towers in Metro Tokyo. Omotesando is mostly high end corp brands, but thats where the architects get to play.
"Oh really? Well I don't give a shit"  Hilarious seeing someone do Chris like that
I’m with the 1983 crowd, not old Chris!
Pete is so entertaining! I hope to see him in more videos 😊
Extendable bear hand... Sweeties, those are back scratchers. It's okay, patpat, I'm sure you were both delirious with fatigue by that point lol.
is it me or does chris have a neck sheathed with love marks
The gorilla and Mr. Mime just reminds me of Cdawgva and Ironmouse, who were friends along for the ride, just like the cycling special across Hokkaido
Such an awesome video format! It reminded me of my trip; last year I went with my friends to a few European capital cities and as poor students, we decided to see everything on foot, just taking trains when we needed to go to the airports. Walking 12-14 hours a day is not an easy task but it's surprising how much you can see and especially I love the small things that you would easily miss if you were to take a bus or a train. Best way to discover a city!
Pete on main let’s goooo!
Love you guys,loving the narration Chris!slick 😎
Love the videos, please never stop making them!
Bet the birds are also scripted.
Great video again chris I love your channel its the best and makes it better that Pete is in this one
I hope you will have a chance to explore Taiwan in the future Chris!! Loads of amazing food and pretty scenery <3
What brand of shoe do you wear for that much walking? Trying to find a good pair for my trip to Japan later this year
The little hand at the end 😂
bro showed screenshot of 31 seasons of One Piece and said 24 seasons 💀
Who the hell is this fit looking guy? I came here to watch Chris Broad.
RIP to your feet.
We walked a ton in Kyoto and Kobe last time, but I specifically remember not remembering anything about the streets between Akihabara and Ueno because there's absolutely nothing worth remembering there. It's still cool that so much is basically walkable.
fantastic guest :) thankyou :) I wish I could go Japan
I can really see how much Shimbashi influenced the design of Chris's studio.
if pig is your animal~ that mean you are turning 40? lol
Chris Is looking fit in this video you can tell he's been putting in the work trying to get in shape.go on Chris!
I have one of those extendable bear hands.
full walk as an unlisted video or something next time? "but it's boring" isn't the greatest argument against it, some people might want to see more of the trip (although i'm not sure how the logistics of the batteries would work out, it's a lot to record)
8:46 seeing that same exact shark toy at my dollar tree I work it is really bizarre and unexpected I must admit.
Also amazingly is that Pete meet the fans again in Connor irl stream. Small (Tokyo) World
Japan is a vibe cyberpunk night city in real life I have to travel to Japan this is a great video
Lol that pidgeon was relentless
In my humble opinion, Pete is HOT. I think it's a combination of a handsome face with an infectious puppy dog personality.
That funny part when the dude @ 1:48 looks like Ryotaro, and then Chris references a video later on with Ryotaro in Asakusa wearing the EXACT SAME SHIRT. 🤔
Plushie cute AF
one of my younger sisters was born in 83.. I'll leave it at that
It's Mister Broad! Just what I needed today ! Lovely :)
This is such a good concept for a video.  Instant click.
RUN.
That poor poor building 🥺 it's like erasing history 😐
This is when you release the entire walk. I'd just watch it to see everything as you're walking.
Isn't this the first time Chris has done an ad read in a video?
Pete is amazing and so generous
Pete talking about why he likes the boring side streets is peak "American discovers how a first world city should be" :D
Pete getting the full japanese company worker experience
I bought one of those extendable bear hands many years ago 😢
If I don't bump into Chris during my April visit, then the entire trip is ruined!
1983!!! Let's Go!!!
What a great hike.. loved every minute. 🗼
1:48-1:51 in the white and black striped shirt, Risottoro is that you????
Sega building still the same tho, just no logo lol
Wonderful!  Glad to see Pete getting more exposure and recognition and the Pete/Chris combo is excellent (Emma/Chris is 2nd). A series of this with guests would be fantastic.  Nick for food or fitness opportunities would be fun.  And of course Sharla.
Been having Mr. Affable withdrawals lately so this was a treat.
isnt that Ryotoro? 1:50
I’m just wondering when you’re both going to realize that that is a back scratcher
I never split my kit kats either. Favorite Japanese kit kat flavor I've tried so far is ocean, but salted lemon is a close second. ☺
I can't unsee that; Pete dressed up as a maid serving pancakes😄
year of the boar rise up lol
That California accent at 24:50 was pretty damn good
When I lived in Seoul I did the same thing, walked all the way from the north end across the Han River and down to the south side.
I’ve never walked that far across Tokyo but I would be surprised when my friends and I explored Tokyo while we studied abroad there, we would be surprised how we ended up in different sections of Tokyo when we began at a different one. I have been to a good majority of these places you visited in this video which brought up some great nostalgic memories. Loved the video! 💜
Awesome job chris
So its now p2w good 4u
If they had actually replace the Sega bilduing with Giger, that could have been interesting.
Chris's videos are like my spiritual medicine   Always cheers me up seeing his contents, wishing I was there with him in the beautiful world of Japan  keep up the good work Chris
The extendable bear claw looks like a back scratcher 🤣
I actually love doing this kinda thing when I'm in a new place/city. Last year I did a quick trip to Switzerland and according to Google, I walked ~60km in 3 days. I find it's the best way to know the place.
Only a few months to go, and I will be (hopefully) back in Japan. Can't wait!
Love the content Chris, always bringing us the best of japan!!!
Why is Tokyo Tower superiour to Eiffel Tower? Because it doesn't have a stupid copyright/trademark thing for its night-time lighting.
dave in japan
What is the camera or phone used to film this?  Superb
what a great way to show Tokyo :) realy nice video
Pete's a great man!
My friend and I averaged 20km a day of walking for the 14 days we visited.. we certainly didn't watch what we ate, but I ended up losing weight on the trip.   We ended up seeing a good chunk of each city between fukuoka and Tokyo. Fun times.
The extendable bear hand is an item found in America. It is a back scratcher.
I really enjoy you and Pete together. Would love to see more videos like this.
5000 commuters/day for 4000 trains?
12:35 What Pete forgot to mention is that walking in streets like that will get you stabbed by a junkie in America
You're eating spicy fried chicken- what were the odds LOL
TV quality, we want this.
new challenge: how long can you walk across new york before getting stabbed.
You look way thinner but also way older
That looked like a fun walk, and it was nice to see Pete and you having a nice time. I'd actually like to see you spend a day in old style village, just exploring the area.
Such a great tour
I spent a month in Hashimoto between November and December this year on my first japan trip, and I must say that one of the best things about Japan is just how walkable it is. Even in a small town like that. I still remember walking almost 5km from where I was staying to get some ファミチキ。The beauty of the scenery on the long journey to get the most 5/10 fried chicken made it all worth while.
My first choice and second choice is Chris and Pete choosing what content is best. Well done lads.
Another exercise based vid sans Gnatski-Reactski, who I now fear must be somewhere - probably sedentary / plonked down by a river somewhere contemplating life with beer & cig in hand, turning into even more of a puddin'. Bring the Gnatski along for a hike through Tat Town! also; not having a scripted vid is not necessarily something to be proud of xD
Subarashii omoide ❤  After 3 years of being away from Japan we got to visit Shibuya crossing in exactly the same spot you guys filmed, on December 25th. We then walked over to Shibuya Hikarie to find a strawberry cake, there weren’t many left. Thanks for pointing out how Tokyo is constantly changing, Sega tower, Nakagin capsule building, our favourite hotel in Gotanda also disappeared during the pandemic, so we stayed in Osaki instead. I hope to run into you on the next trip to Tokyo, your videos always bring me great memories of teaching English for a year in Osaka 2012/2013.
Love pete he’s so much fun to watch
Pete seems so "full of life" and i think with chris together it makes for such an interesting and enjoyable contrast that gives the videos a certain charm. you made my evening a very pleasant one, thank you for that!
13:46 the moment Pete turned from sidekick to main character
Welcome back!!!
Lived in Tokyo for over a decade. 20 km daily walks were commonplace. Tokyo is one of the world’s most walking and biking-friendly cities and the vast majority of it is flat with the occasional river, small hill, forest or ravine. BTW: Asakusa is a far better walk at night, especially after it rains.
Dude I don't know how to thank you  I'll probably not going to see Japan ever but because of your videos is like is  I've been there  THANK YOU
THE BEAR CLAW IS A BACK SCRATCHER! I used to have one and it was awesome 😆
Where did Pete get that sweet Coffee Boss jacket?
Now that you lost weight you look less afable, but amazing as always.
Nothing like a 25 km walking adventure to burn off copious amounts of alcohol and fried chicken!
Looking sharp! Chris looks so much better having lost some weight. Good on you mate, keep it up.
That bear hand gadget is actually a back scratcher. Allthough its not a bear shaped one, I have 2 at home ^_^
"Stop killing the birds Pete!" while standing in line for fried dead birds 🤣
Loved this video!! More like this please!
Extendable bear hand is a back scratcher and i have one. It’s fantastic.
First video of this year😍(I think) it’s been soo long. What a fun video
I like the linking up the previous videos into one simple one.
Great video again Chris and Pete :)
Haven’t been back to Japan since 2018. Watching your videos always give me a sense of nostalgia and make me want to go back sooner than later- always a great job- aaaaaaaand- I want Pete’s jacket!!!
It still amazes me that the little tuber talking about the crazy Japanese stuff he experienced as a teacher is now closing in on 3 million subs and is THE tuber in Japan despite the biggest youtuber ever now living there. Cheers Chris, also you looking a bit slimmer.
2nd time I see this idea of video, after the French youtuber Tev - Ici Japon
Pete is such a sweetheart, we want more of him!
Excellent video! Loved every bit of this! You should walk around Osaka or Nagoya!! Fukuoka is also nice, the sea is close by.
born 1983 reporting in!
PMSL. I've got one of those bear claws. My handle is purple but it's the same claw
your not alone @PremierTwo  ! Sept 1983! lets go turning 40...lol
25km a day isnt that hard in japan since everything feels so nice and satisfying (as a tourist) kinda reminds me of last autumn trip to japan, i walked 30k steps a day. it was nice and fulfilling.
Buttscratcher ?
Walking Gaijin challenge
Back on the attack and a long video at that...blessed day
thank you for this video :3 i love walking 20-30 km a day :3
that bear paw looks like a good back scratcher, ngl
Chris looks so good man!  Like this dude is actually affable
i love these videos. puts me in a happy place mentally.
The bear claw is a back scratcher
He seriously looks younger doing all this training xD
Pete seems like an absolute joy to hang out with lmao the glasses bit in Don Quijote would have had me dying, this video as a whole was a very fun one and a great first video back from break!
Good one boys, very interesting
Do a collab with GeoWizard :)
I voted this video down. Boooooooooooooo
Amazing video guys. I'm currently pondering with the idea to come over. All the best from London.
Honestly, you could do this in all the big cities in Japan and I would love it. It's like a Quick Guide to see the most important places in a city in just one day.
the strawberry on a stick, i have to know... what was it coated in?
Tokyo looks awsome even on a rainy day.
Pete acting like Chris didn’t drive him all the way up to Wakanai for a mug that Natsuki didn’t even buy there lmao
Sorry, Blackpool Tower is the best 😂
I wonder what he would have chosen to buy.
18:03 Ah, so Pete was a Japanese history miner? Excavating Japanese history, with a trusty pickaxe! 👍
The bear claw looks like a back scratcher
will be in Japan on March! this is sooo helpful! ;)
@3:46. behind Chris, dude's living the anime dating episode. Hope he complemented her look when they met at the station. 🤣
Wholesome trip! I gotta try sake kitkat now!
Yaay! So happy to see your videos again!
The goat is back!
Me watching Akihabara stuff from YouTube : omg wow 🤩 Me visiting Akihabara for real : tf is this place, even Pyongyang is less boring than this place 💀
Mr mime is bariyado? I just assumed  Pokemon were the Same across the world. Pronunciation may differ but the word was the same. Does that mean that every Pokemon is redubbed for other languages considering they say their own name
Pete's so corny he's substituted by the US government
Chris your jawline looks chisseled as fudge now. Your fitness goals are being met i see. Gratz!
There needs to be a chicken counter in the corner as the journey continues. Love Pete's backpack progressively getting more and more odd. This would be a really enjoyable series to watch if you decide to keep walking around cities in a day. Pete's always great for hyping you up! Lovely video.
I loved walking around Tokiyo, in the right areas you get really interesting side streets that are fun to explore. I especially miss Ueno.
The Tokyo station is exactly how I would describe it. Influence of the west but that Japanese aesthetic, I think why it does is because of how clean and kept it looks compared the dirty, partly grungy gothic look it can get in western countries.
Fun fact I bought a 5 pack of those bear claw back scratchers online because I had just started a new job and they had put us up in an apartment for a few weeks and my back got super itchy, and so I drove around to about 3 shops looking for a back scratcher and none had them, and the 5 pack of them was as cheap as one normal back scratcher.
Tokyo station has only 5000 commuters per day? That's probably the number per minute lol.
I am one of those people who buys the bear hand. I can get those spots on my back that might get itchy. 10/10 purchase, will buy again
That gorilla! We had one (but bigger) we called "stretchy Gordon" that was my kids absolute favourite toy until it popped. Nice to see stretchy Gordon is having fun in Japan.
Those back scratchers are the best!
3:00 swastika thingies in the bowl where they breathe in the smoke. Funny to see other places on earth still using it as good luck charm.
Loved the format, please keep doing them!!!
Pete! Let's go 1984!!! 😁👍
Pete should definitely go up the ranks as best friend 😸
if you gave the mr mime a hat it would be pete
I’m an ‘83 baby!!
I tried walking across the isle of Sheppey for a day. I was traumatised.
Pete seems like he'd be a great DnD DM
Pete's personality is so infectious lol "Let's go!" 😂
5k commuters? More like 5m right?
that boss coffee jacket is seriously cool
I was just wondering yesterday when your next video was going to drop!  Happy days!
1983, oh what a young little loud boy 😂 Yes, Don Quijote is the best store in the world! When I lived in Tokyo I used to walk 12.6 km (2 hours 40 min) at least once a week. In the beginning, I was using Google maps all the time but after just a few times I recognize al the streets and houses along the way, good memories.
The extendable bear claw is just a back scratcher. VERY useful.
15:45 Eh... what do you mean the Sega building is gone? That's the same exact building you're showing, isn't it? A building's ownership changing, doesn't mean it isn't still the same exact building. Sega are gone from the building, but the building is still there.
Chris, haven't watched one of your vids in a few months, but caught up now. You are looking svelt, sir.
the buildings around Tokyo Station look basically identical to the office buildings of midtown Manhattan. probably the same types of businesses there.
Fabulous!  So many memories of Tokyo were revived by your video!  Kampai Chris-san!
The extendable bear claw is a back scratcher.
If you keep walking on the train does it count as walking across Tokyo?
I want to see another wacky weekend! and do another love hotel episode those are the best imo! :)
it's THE Pete "Premiere" Two. Nice to have him featured finally
I have that bear claw back scratcher lol
Don't mock the bear claw scratcher!  Best back scratcher in the world!
I cannot express how much I loved this video. It's an indie adventure in a super interesting setting with high production value and very likable presenters. What more would you need?
I love how Chris doesn’t get Pete’s appreciation to being able to walk somewhere and not have to drive. In North America you have to drive absolutely everywhere. Even somewhere 3 minutes away requires a car, it’s a pretty uniquely North American problem.
So, When will the uncut version be released ? 😀
Tokyo Station 4000 trains a day and 5000 commuters passing through it daily... So like 1-2 people per train?
Looking lean Chris. All that hard work has been paying off.
Why Chris looking like a kid in the thumbnail? lol
In this video Mr. Affable enslaves a man that is recovering from surgery, perpetuates the suffering of flightless birds, complains about destruction of derelict architecture, is accosted by peasants, and ruins his chessboxing figure with alcohol and pizza.
You're saying "don't do this" but it's literally what I do with every major city I go to. First or second day I get there, just start walking and don't stop until you've seen the big important sights from street level.  Although with Tokyo that might be a bit hard since it's so massive and all xD
Sorry Chris, but I bought one of those  extendable bear hands :D
you lost lots of weight you can see it at the neck a lot ! good job
Pete is such a gem ❤️ I was smiling and laughing throughout the video thanks to you two
Honestly I only want to go to Japan for the KitKats.
Holy crap I don't recognize this Chris! Looking good! I saw saké KitKat at a store, I'm going to try it next time based on the glowing reviews.
14:00 PREDICTABO
Always so much fun to see your videos Chris & company included!💯
all gigo is missing is a talking gecko..... oh wait that gieco! 😂😂
american pete has to be one of my favourite guests, hope to see a lot more of him (and possibly interacting with a bunch of the other past guests?). great video as always chris!
We Pete in full
pete is the fucn goat
I have watched your video adventures for years...I don't know why, but this one has to be one of my favorites.  I am typing this from across the pond in a very BORING state called...Indiana.  From a 59 year old fan....keep up the good videoing.  (That is not an actual word...buy hey, I am 59 years old so I can make shit up if I want).
Ngl Chris's looks 20 yrs younger good going pro boxer
what is the music you use in the backgrounds and where can we listen to it ?
I have an extendable bear hand. great back scratcher!
Listen here Mr. Mime the CN tower is arguably the best tower in the modern world ;) its not because I'm Canadian or anything lol I'm not bias or anything lol
Amazing video Chris and Pete! 👏🏽 Informative and entertaining to watch! I will definitely use the information for my trip (hopefully and finally) this year! Please do more episodes like this 🔥
Absolutely great video, Pete always brings such energy ❤️
I agree with eki. Petes jacket is kick ass!
chris you look handsome and nice hair
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!!
Heheh, Pete's hippie glasses from Donki really suited him.   (Also those extendey hands, and I guess paws,  are often magnetic  and can make pretty good parts-retrievers if you work on cars and such.  That one may be a back-scratcher, though.  :) )
Nah, these videos aren't scripted. Well, some of the videos are clearly fully scripted, but many are semi-scripted, with plenty of not strictly planed (and thus somewhat improvised) acting ...and the occasional bit of genuine natural reactions/interactions. I have no problem, with any of that, BTW.
Those bear hands are great cheap cat toys. I have tons as cat toys.
Year of the boar clan! I too will be 40 this year.
Did... did... did Pete just reference starcraft ( 4:48 ) ?! This man is a box of surprises.
Great video. I love your channel. Hopefully one day I'll be able to travel to Japan.
I basically did that amount of walking every single day when i visited japan for 6 weeks. dropped 8 kg hah. very good video, would watch again.
I would not try this in Chicago, I did so years ago and got really scared when I started to get into South Chicago.  boarded up buildings everywhere, and the native population was eyeing me like I was a bunny entering a wolf den.
Love this ! Pete is hilarious - you two are a great combo.
why does Pete look like a homeless American?
16:48 just 5000 commuters passing through?
Nice Video.... 👍  WE PAY IN FULL! 😉
I also represent 1983, American Pete, you're not alone.
Ryotaro?!?!
Is that Petter THE Premier Two Pete? He's like the best Vampire survivor and he PAYS IN FULL!
PETE!!!!!
Extendable bear hand is a back scratcher 😁
lol wasnt that the guy that was in  Connors live stream with Pete where the guy started doing Dolphin noises
wow, Chris actually looks like he lost enough weights for me to notice the difference. looking good and very enjoyable video as always!
Yay new content!! Love this channel!
Looking good
5,000 commuters a day in Tokyo Station? I'd guess more like 5 million?
Mr. Affable is back!!!!!!!!
Hope you enjoyed your time off Mr Affable!
BIG FRIED CHICKEN  Needs to be a t-shirt...
extendible bear claw = back scratcher
5:29 too scared to say 'friend' ay. 🙁🙁
nice haircut chris
I was actually thinking about this recently, as I really enjoyed walking across the city. I think when I go back I'm definitely going to trek it.
That's a back scratcher, guys.
Wow, Pete's 40? Doesn't look it!
Awesome video and one of the best you've done in a while. You do your best work when you do it unscripted. Keep those videos coming.
Is this Chris' very first AD? It seems like someone needs more fried chicken
My first thought was "only 20 km in a day?" but then I saw you packed the day with all kinds of activities so that sounds fair. And navigating the crowds must be incredibly frustrating if you're trying to keep up a brisk pace.
seeing a German Boardgame (the Settlers of Catan) in the Japanese Version xD looks funny to me
I'm gonna say it again but it's much harder for Japan to have more "interesting" architecture especially for skyscrapers due to earthquake.
Whooooo!!!! LEZZ GOOOO PETE!!!! Honestly Pete is such a treat to watch such a ball of good vibes and energy
I’ve tried this many times but I get too distracted and never make it to the end 😂
This looks so fun. More walking adventures please!! :D
New Abroad in Japan vid! Let's go!
24:42 it's a back scratcher
I tried the sake kit kat. I’m incredibly sensitive to alcohol for no discernible reason and those literally fucked my stomach up I was surprised that such a small amount still made my stomach feel terrible. They do taste good though lol
The moon has a better chance of being cheese than three ABJ videos in a month.
How does he make himself look so much younger in his thumbnails That's amazing
I love videos like this so much! I'm disabled and really cannot walk far at all which means I'd never be able to do something like this but I absolutely love exploring and adventure so getting to live through it through videos like this is really special, hopefully one day I'll make it to Japan for a trip and be able to experience it in a way accessible to myself! Cheers for the amazing vid as always 🫶🏼
Never thought I’d see the day where Chris says there’s too much fried chicken 😱
The extendable bear hands is for you to scratch your back with.
Actually needed this I'll be in Tokyo soon and well I'm scared of walking around alone especially if I get lost since my Japanese is next to 0%
Pete really came into his own on this video! Brilliant tour through such a diverse city!
Always nice to see Pete in a video. Btw, I've had the luck to try the sake Kit-Kats and they are amazing. These videos are always top notch.
Pete knows that bear claw is a backscratcher right lol
The Tokyo Station is inspired by Central Station in Amsterdam, Netherlands! Love to see it. Great video!
awesome video
HE'S BACK!
wonderful video, as always. I love how pete has now found his 'style' and sort of a 'groove' while on camera. It is nice seeing someone get more used to being on camera.
love you guys! :)
Great broadcast indeed! Btw, I've those Sake Kitkat candies/bisquits here in Helsinki, Finland!
I love the little details in editing, like using the minecraft eating sound when he eats the kitkats. Awesome video, thank you!
Another inspiring and motivating workout video.... except for the fried chicken of course 🤤
So many of your shots remind me of games and films i've seen. Thx :)
I haven’t finish the video but I know this needs to be  a series !
Pete has reached peak coolness
this is the closest I can ever get to Japan. ty Chris <3
Asakusa to Shibuya, doesn't even count as walking across the Special Wards, much less walking across Tokyo. The video title, and claim in the video, is a lie. (and it's hardly seeing how much of Tokyo you can see in a day, when you have stops, for anything other than to eat) I wouldn't mind a video walking this route, if it wasn't accompanied with those lies.
KitKat saki .... didn't see that coming.
In America you would have also gotten a giant bun to go with the giant chicken.
1983 gang right here, Pete
I'd forgotten how much I hate the way Chris eats kit kats.
16:42 - 4000 trains and 5000 commuters.  Am I missing something here? Does he mean 5 Million?
AYO! It's Pete! Pete ask us to do this!
Man, it's so damn hard not to love all of Chris's friends.
I’m going back to Japan end of September and beginning of October for 15 days. This video is very timely!!!
That thumbnail makes Chris look so young and skinny that I momentarily mistook him for a kid.
You have such infectious good humor, Chris.
caesar salad and french fries 😂
Chris has such a great character
I own an extending bear hand, Its a great back scratcher.
19:00 Call of the night youtube edition starts here
On my very first trip to Japan I walked from my hotel in Shinjuku to Tokyo Station at night. Why? To get to the Pokemon Center, of course. 😆
You and Pete have a great dynamic and  sense of humor. I was laughing so much! This video reminded me of my time in Japan and brought back great memories.
yes my day just got better!
83 here as well Pete. You’re not that old buddy!
Welcome back
That Yakitori in the thumbnail will sustain him through this massive walk
For the algorithm and beer spilling. 🔥🔥🔥
The bear paw is a back scratcher XD I only know cause I have one
Petes stomping on a bird. Don't worry it's a good luck thing. 😁 His happy face with all this baller money proves me right. 😂😂
There is a hotel called Dormy Inn right on the edge of Ameyokocho and Akihabara if anyone wants a solid place to stay in Tokyo.
I love how Pete slowly sinks in the ranking of "american friends" as Chris aquires new ones.
Awesome video. Loved to see you put the viewers on the video as well.
its Pete!
we pay in full
Great video man. All the hard work put into making great content and editing it into something that's not only fun and entertaining,  but easy to watch and digest, doesn't go unnoticed. Keep up the great work. Can't wait to hear more about the book. Maybe Pete Donaldson can read some of it on the AbroadinJapan podcast lol.
Pete is a great sidekick, wingman, and friend with infinite good humour. Always glad to see him on this channel.
It's nice to see all the stuff I've seen before live, pre-pandemic, and couldn't revisit for so long. Maybe this/next year.
“Let’s go” dolphinately became passé after Tom Brady used it in a recent Hertz advert 🙈🖖
The days of the king has returned🙌🏽
Something about ad rolls in your videos feels really off. I can't say I blame you because I mean ya gotta do what ya gotta do, a man's gotta grind. But man it really caught me off guard
16:48 i think more than 5000 commuters pass through tokyo station everyday, am i missing something?
9:30 the whiskey brand from Lost in Translation.
Pete's has that energy 🔥
Chris, is that picture of yours in the thumbnail from 10 years ago? You look nothing like that
24:41 back/butt scratcher
loved this one! thanks chris
Ayy you’re back!
Everyone needs a pack mule like Pete, especially a fashionable one.
pete reminds me of jack black, love the energy
Europeans: Walking amongst old buildings is so pedestrian. Americans: Exactly! It’s wonderful!
As an American with no second language, can I just point at stuff and shout FISHY, FISHY, FISHY! and probably get food?
i love watching your videos like this one, i’m walking 73 miles in the summer and stuff like this really helps me stay motivated!
I was wondering if maid cafés are really a thing like they are made out to be. Cos in some anime I seen recently (Komi, kaguya) they do they maid cafe thing and it's taken really seriously,  I know that's a school event imitating a maid café but still don't think I've seen a video of a real maid cafe it actually happens or not like "sit down master" ect ect
When ISNT Pete happy??!? He is something to aspire to be or have as a friend! Damn he brings the vibes.
Did you drink 100 vending machine beverages while walking around? If not I don't want to watch. William Ossman changed what a Japan vlog should be. (seriously though great video! 😂👌)
That looked like such a fun night.. glad you brought Pete along!
Genuine question Pete, HOW DO YOU HAVE THAT MUCH ENERGY AFTER THAT WALK?
Pete's not just a stylish pack mule, he's a stylish pack mile that also owes him a ps5
Glad to see you back, hope your vacation was nice!
Probably should be Across Japan instead of Abroad in Japan since he seems to have mastered crossing portions of Japan.
16:45 Only 5,000 commuters a day, sounds really low. Mistake?
Great video, Chris! Were in these places last week and now I'm wanting to go back after watching this lol. Didn't even see some of these so thanks! Looking forward to the next one💪
I think the bear hand is a back scratcher  ;)
Pete's The Shining Sake Chocolate improv... 🤣🤣
Finally! A new video! Glad he’s back!
the king is back
A
This is a really cool idea, love to see it.
Shesh
Do a 2h walk like video but with ur usual voice over
The "Mr Mime" sound effects throughout the video was a really nice touch.
Welcome back champ!
Great video. I love Pete so much! He's very entertaining
Who finishes a big fried chicken and immediately thinks I know what I need - yakitori skewers!
I miss you!!!❤🎉😂
Extendable Bear Hands... Make great back scratchers. I know from experience... :)
Great video!! Also love the little fun fact graphics near the end
I read (chris: i walked across tokyo)  I see his hand.  I: Oh ok. 💋💋💝💝💕💕💘💘💞💞👹👹👺👺🎌🎌🎌🎌👺👺👹👹💞💞💘💘💕💕💝💝💋💋.
The Sake Kitkat is a gulity pleasure of mine too. I once bought a box in Japan meaning for a friend but i plowed through them in one sitting. Had to search Kyoto for another 3 boxes.
You must not like your viewers to recommend one piece that’s literal endless horror
Took a weekend trip to Tokyo last month and went up to the top of Sky Tree and Tokyo Tower in the same day. Both are nice, but I definitely enjoyed Tokyo Tower more (especially at night!).
American Pete sounds like he gets a little bit peanut butter and jealous
What amazing citie's walk,i adore so much Tokyo!!!
"This video isn't scripted". Two minutes later nearly kills a bird. I believe you.
day has been made
Nothing special this, when I visited Tokyo I found their underground confusing and ended up walking over 28 miles in one day and averaged over 20 miles on all the others too 😂
A classic!
HOW ABOUT  BE IN A BOAT IN A DAY ????  CHRIS / I GOT SEA SICK
Bloody love this guy. Love every single bit of content he has made.
Awesome concept and follow-through as usual Chris! Good to see Pete "Mr. Mime" Bariyadou in yet another vid as well. Thank for the experience!
Love Pete's energy!
every time i see chris eating a kitkat i get so sad, you gotta break them in half😭
Hey chris shootout to you. Your vidoes helped me focus ny trip planning. I've been planning ot go to japan for close to 14 years now. And now I'm finally heading over in july of this year. And to culminate the trip I intend to climb fuji while im there.
I love tokyo!! love this videos!
Well Chris there goes the diet.
Awesome video.
Next up, Mr Affable walks the entirety of Japan for "Walk Across Japan"?
Tbh I think this has the potential to become a really cool series. Something like walking around citys in a day, you could start in like Osaka and just walk around and tour for a day, and go through all the other major citys
Haven’t watched yet but will after work. Next time I visit Japan I’m absolutely doing this.
1:44 Ryotaro jumpscare
Hellooo from Australia! Headed to japan in May! Finally after missing out in 2020. I have been rewatching your videos this week just building on my excitement. Thank you for doing what you do!
Yoo, it's always nice to see Mr Affable uploads a new video
This reminds me so much of walking Yonge street (until 1999, the longest street in the world) in Toronto! Scale is obviously toned down but the districts and the vibes are *very* similar.
Designated chicken eating zone is a fantastic idea
I always enjoy your humour, Chris, and having Pete's humour as well, he's a classic,...I really enjoyed this video.
Rented an AirBnB from Ian back in 2017 with some friends and spent most of our time trekking across Tokyo like this. It was such a fun time. Looking forward to visiting again this Spring hopefully, but maybe this time spend a little time in Kyoto. Cheers Chris! Appreciate the videos!
Wait, Pete got knocked down to 3rd best American friend? Who took his spot? Hahaha
Ha did it first I'm just not a famous YouTuber so it's not interesting if I did it 🤣.. Loved the video
0 Hour gang for the long awaited new video 😂🎉
Are you still hiring pigeon actors? (kidding)
Pete seems like the kind of guy that would give his money away if someone asked for it
its ya boi chris he's back nice
Straight line across japan next? Collab with geowizard? 🤣
30 min video about walking, stops 3 min in to the video to eat fried chicken, never change Chris.
Chris, you look great. Your face looks slimmer, and your skin is even glowing. I hope you’re proud of yourself, and keep up the fantastic work regarding working on your health!
Who is that young, shaved and handsome guy on the thumbnail? New friend of Chris? 🤔
I'm going to Tokyo from end of march until beginning of april, and seeing this video gives me tons of ideas of what I should do in there. Such an inspiration. Thank you Chris! 👏💜✨
Pete getting an allowance from his dad, how cute
i love pete. "It reminds me of my dads old apartment."
How anime is that "young girl in school uniform leaning against a post with her head down with that background" at 2 minute mark
Pretty nice I'd love to see videos like this but in Okinawa. It's probably my fav place in Japan.
I’ve always wanted to do do this, this episode is gold
It's always a good day when Chris uploads a new video!
Wow, you are such a hustler!
Im going to tokyo this summer so this is a welcome video! I can't wait to have my own adventure like this!
Man, Chris, you sure look good. Keep it up!
I could have sworn I'd seen Ryotoro at the start of the video
Damn. If he played Pokémon go, he would be hatching so many eggs
Chris you and Pete (the Donaldson one) joked about it on the podcast, but I think you should really let and AI write one of your video. No matter how absurd or cliche the subject of the script, would be funny to see you go for it.
Chris you look so young in the thumbnail, I thought this was an older video 👀
I've actually done this a few times. Nice walk, I felt like I earned my dinner afterwards.
This feels like such a Chris thing to do * cough cough * cycling across Japan * cough *   Jokes aside, this is a pretty creative way to keep the content flowing. Especially considering a seasoned, tourism promoting, veteran like Chris has probably already been to most places in Japan.  I look forward to seeing what comes next!
As an American, I find Pete incredibly annoying...I sincerely hope that we don't all come across like him to the international community.
Chris, I can tell you lost quite a bit of weight. looking good!
Haven't finished the video but great video as always! 👍👍👍
Will watch when I get home but welcome back Mr. Affable. We're so proud of you!
Brilliant stuff!
Having walked to Yamanote Line in a day I can only recommend people to walk train routes, the routes go through the places they do for a reason. Always fun stuff to see. I just hope that shimbashi isn't going to be overrun with AIJ viewers now that you showed off its nightlife ;) it is my favorite place in Tokyo for drinks with kaishain.
1:25 getting a compliment for his outfit from Mister Affable himself should've been reason enough for his 3rd best American friend to get on this trip alone.
Pete, you are not alone. Fellow 1983 born right here! 🎂
Whoa finally a new video
Someone who was born in 1993 being called old hits me hard
recycled material alert :D i spotted rizzotoro in the early part of the video
Test
I had to double take, I thought that “Designated chicken eating zone” was an actual sign 😂
Good grief. What happened to your audio? Get a better pop shield Christopher! Those blasts hurt my ears I may be over sensitive). Interesting video tho... not sure I could walk that far at my age.
Just want to say congrats mate!!! Your health and lifestyle changes are having a huge noticeable effect, well done!!!
Your videos bring my life what little joy I have left.
Seems like this is bigger than a Kpop comeback. Tokyo sure has a lot of fascinating things to offer.
Great video Chris, as always!
when I was in tokyo i walked from hirai station to the skytree, from there to the asakusa shrine, then to the tokyo tower and at the evening i was at a random park in western tokyo, all together more than 43km and it wasnt really that hard. best day i ever had
Im so happy you uploaded today because I’ve been having the worst day with a lot of tears already and this is exactly what I need right now to make me smile and make my day a bit better so thank you for doing that
1:45 swear I saw risotoro
For a minute there I thought it had taken you so long to walk across Tokyo that you grew a beard.
I'm going to Japan in March. This made me even more excited!
yolo.
Woah Chris isnt fat anymore
oh boy the 23 ward width-wise walk; tried Kichijoji to Shinagawa before, sure is a walk
Has Pete been demoted?? I thought he was at least 2nd best American friend?? REFEREE!!
3:32 "Stop killing the birds!"  *continues to order a dead bird*
I've always wanted to watch this. Should be fun!
I actually did something similar to this back in 2019!  I took the train to Akihabara, and from there, I walked back to my airbnb in Setagaya. It was around 27km because I took a detour to Ebisu on the way hahaha. Was super fun to just walk and see everything along the way and I would love to do it again one day!
Chris did you say video game store?
Did Chris downgrade Pete to his third American best friend😂 he was second previously
Journey across Japan: Walking
Let GOOOOO
Seriously, never been more excited for a Chris' upload, looks like a lot of fun!!
It's just the European thing to do.
Up for 9 in the morning? New Year, New Chris.
People who love Japan use this comment as a like button.
The affable champ has returned
Holy Shit You're so thin now. I almost couldn't recognize you!
damn chris, looking good! i can see you lost some weight
People who love haven't been to Tokyo use this as a like button.
Get milet to walk with you, then your life goal is completed.
In terms of area wasn't it a Chinese city that was the largest while Tokyo being the most populated city??? Idk... either way these videos are like mini JAJ to me and it's good to see you doing these types of videos again...
With all these fitness related videos I am wondering when Chris will finally attempt to win ninja warrior
Long time no see 😉
Premier Who and Dave in Japan walk Kamakura and Enoshima would work
高尾山、井の頭恩賜公園、皇居もおすすめだよ。Mount Takao, Inokashira Park, and Imperial Palace(Edo Castle) are also recommended.
When 'Walking Across Japan'?
Love your videos!! 🍡🍡
Sup chris
Mega City Mega Calf this is Chris secret exercise for that exquisite calf, walk across your nearest city everyday for better result.
Welcome back 🎉 Happy new year Mr. Affable
I’ve never been this early for one of Chris’s videos Chris you are my second favorite YouTuber Felix is my favorite though
I'd love to do this, do you have a walking map available?
If I ever go to Tokyo I'm following this video to a t :D
About time !!
challenge: try walking across konbini without buying fried chicken
But couldn't you just get the eagles to take you??
Thank you for coming back to us hope you enjoyed your time off! Now lets hit that 3 milli soon 😈 😂
FINALLY, a video. If Sharla is keeping you distracted with all the love she's giving, I will make sure she loses her resident card. 🤣 Get back to work. 🤣  Great video, I love American Pete.
Legend❤️‍🔥
Wahooo new video! Hope you and Sharla had a fantastic holiday.
You look really slim in the thumbnail, Chris. A very fit start to the year.
I LOVE YOU CHRIS BROAD
Hi chris, would an aircraft mechanic have good prospects in japan?
Pete really draw the shortest straw for the friendship category... being a pack mule
Thumbnail Chris looks like a younger version of adult Frankie Muniz.
Dammit we were just there Saturday, I was secretly hoping I'd be able to see you
For a second I misread the title as "I tried walking across Japan" xd
I was just wandering whether Chris will upload a new video or not, so urged am I that I read the two articles from Chris' twitter, then I saw a new video. OwO
Chris loves taking a journey
👍
This video marks the last time Pete PremierTwo was seen outside before he met his final fate..... Vampire Survivors 😪
Yey Chris is back
Hey Chris. Just wanted to give you a shout out for always making your vids available for Download. I live in South Africa and we're currently going on 17 years with rolling blackout.   Talking upwards of 12 hours a day because of our corrupt government.   So it means a hell of a lot that I can download and keep up with you during that.   Love the content man and appreciate you
It absolutely is possible, but my heck you are tired afterwards  Source; My time living in Japan x) my friend was not fond cuz i said nah its not that far o-o
I just wanna visit Japan so bad!
Yaaayy!!! And you're back :")
This is Chris's preparation for a marathon, just wait
YES! First video of the year!
I gota get to japan some day
19 sec ago
I was literally just thinking I hadn't seen a video from Chris in a minute lol creepy timing. Made a depressing sunday a little more fun.
PETE!!!!!!!
Nice haircut Chris.
Sapporo would be really cool to walk around in a day
yaaah
I'm going to Tokyo in April so this timing could not be better! Planning my 9 day trip now, a tough challenge
Poggers UwU
CHRIS!!! PETE!!! Yeah!
Videos are back! Woot! Happy New Year Chris!
it's been long time mate! welcomeback. . . .
This would have been the perfect opportunity to use a Segway.
hi chris

Yeah bruh !
Finally iv'e been looking forward to a nice vid. 😊
Maybe the best Tokyo experience is the one we made along the way
Yayy new video
Yo mr affable

NOTIFICATION SQUAD: Where would you like to see us walk across in a day next? LET us know below!
