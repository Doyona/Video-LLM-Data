She needs to come out with her own makeup brand
She is so beautiful. I aspire to be like Liv when I grow up 🌷💟
Anyone know the name of the mascara? I can't find it on the list.

Dios bendiga a mujeres buenas y caritativas con poder que ayudan a mujeres maltratadas y a la gente marginada económicamente 🙏🏼 Son las mas bellas 🙏🏼🙌🏼 Repartir la bondad y calidad de vida para todo hermana y hermano en la tierra 🙏🏼 Dios of bendiga 🙏🏼

My favorite vogue video
i love her, i feel like she's my best friend but  she don't know me
She is always beautiful even without makeup ❤❤
Olivia whats your mbti personality tip
Olivia and Taylor Swift are my absolute favorite celebrities! I hope that Olivia continues to blossom and become one of Gen Z's icons, because there really could not be any sweeter person to fill that role.
i   like   it,
She is such a teenager here, so adorable! Surprisingly made me miss my teenage years too
"Eyeliners are sisters not twins" I felt that olivia. I felt that. She's so cheerful and friendly Watching her talk is just so wholesome.
she had that pink lipstick on already?!
PLEASE, we need a video with Taylor Swift's Beauty secrets
Ok she is so beautiful this is a fact❤
I do it to😊
@elifsujewelrry 2:03
She is the most sweetest teenager I have ever seen! She was really being herself and it made her so amazing
She is SO PRETTY!! Even without any makeup she just wakes up and looks like a literal model omg😩💓😤

Olivia es muy hermosa

i thimk everyone actually uses their serum like that
1:37
Maquillandose para ir a robar canciones por ahí
shes so pretty
She doesn't even need make up! She has a natural beauty.
i love how she complemented billie eilish
That “eehe” 😂😂😂😂
I can't lie, the application is shite. But somehow it looks great at the end?  It lowkey bothers me bc if I put on bb cream, cream concealer and no powder, then in with powder bronzer (without setting the bb cream first), it would go so patchy???? It's like you get famous and suddenly powders don't mess with liquid products. what is this
I wanna be like her when i grow up, shes so nice, happy and genuine that i just love her, she’s an inspiration for me
Her voice sounds so different when she isn’t singing
I love Olivia Rodrigo like I think is a super kind girl and I love it,Olivia if you reed this you need to know that you are my favorite singer and I love your music and follow your dreams,I can watch this video for hours,have a nice day Olivia and vogue ❤
I would let her use my face as her toilet bowl to sit on
My fave❤
The hehe with the skin care bag was so sweet
She’s so pretty
I love her confidence!! ☺️
i love you
shes such an angel
What brand was the Dry shampoo?
She is so pretty I like the way she talks ❤
I love you Olivia
She's so adorable
Name of type of serum?
I love your songs so much
Queen
Amoo
Te amo liv

The laugh after " I know it's there " Got my heart
The fact she is now in her 20's just is crazy to me

I love you Olivia Rodrigo ❤️❤️
“Eyeliner are sister not twins” THATS Inspiration for me<3

❤My life has changed so dramatically since i listen song, "Driver license"❤
I Love You Olivia Rodrigo She's a Angel Deuva Vu

finally someone to relate to!
Olivia rodrigo jenna ortega🇵🇭💚😢🥀
When she mentioned her weakness in terms of confidence and her skin with break outs etc, this is a true definition of a humble person, her parents raised her well. As my pumpkin
so do most people not use water when they wash their face and only use a rag to wipe it off?
Yr beautiful just in the way u are Happy New Year 🎉🎈yr so amazing 🌸
Which serum is that by the ordinary?
Taehyung's sister ooooo ~
She is very honest which shocks me. Im proud of her for being herself and being honest about acne and her life. Also the drive through story was funny
Now i understand that i want to earn money before everything :')
A maior que temos
Tá aí a menina que traiu o namorado, ele foi lá e terminou com ela. Ele acabou namorando com outra pessoa, enquanto a lunática aí ficou p*ta com o cara dizendo que tava com ele e a outra enquanto tava com ela. Olha o tipo de pessoa que vocês dão ibope.

Who is this
I dont LOVE her music but I LOVE her
she is so gorgeous
my tips for olivia: don’t apply the ordinary serum like that, its better to first apply it on your hand and put it all over ur face get a moisturizer pleasee!! its so important, i recommend the first aid beauty ultra repair cream its soo good please start applying sunscreen it is the most important part of a skincare routine, i recommend the first aid beauty mineral sunscreen  thats all anyway ily olivia <3
OMG OMG I LOVE HER HAIR SHES SO PRETTY MANNNNNN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT HAIRCUT THATS CALLED PLS 😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
🤔✔️📝🐓🍆🐔🥒🥚🥚🥚🥚🐔🥦🍉🐙🦐🍹🎂🏩👌👍😂😂😂🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭

Just watched the interview with Billie Eilish and I love how simple they keep jt. They have a natural beauty and don't over do the make up and I think it bc she wears foundation/ concealer that actually matches her skin tone, instead of using it to change her whole face. It's how she said, make up should only accentuate your beauty
4:31
I always put hairspray on my eyebrow brush 😂😂😂
We love you
i love olivias personality sm <3 one of my comfort vids for sure.
her smile>>>>>
Watching this video made me create some skin cream of my own, if you know what I mean :)
She looks so amazing without makeup like exactly the same.
Love love love love you 😍😍

傻B驴，不让你们玩游戏居然跑去做假游戏欺骗我粉丝？让她感觉无论我怎么赢游戏局都不让走，不让她见我们的人。让她一次次抱有希望、一次次希望破灭、直到感到绝望，意志被瓦解，精神被打败，放弃我放弃阳光，主动离开游戏为止！你们还派内鬼去造谣吓唬她，说游戏局有人被腐蚀了，这游戏永远不会停止直到她主动放弃为止。你们知道骗不了我、打败不了我精神、无法催眠我弄伤自己玩游戏，就转移火力去骗我的粉丝、动摇她意志、想打败她精神，让她自己放弃希望选择离开，真他妈的贱！你们不止作假说我和很多人正在玩，还把她关小黑屋或者小热屋，甚至还拿毒品和鬼吓唬她，还放些假流氓、混混虚张声势，让她精神动摇、害怕，更加难受，容易放弃，真他妈的娘娘腔、精神病！看谁好欺负攻击谁！偷鸡摸狗，下流无耻！！！除了尝试让我失去男子汉特征，容易精神放弃让你们占我的人便宜、甚至拐走的没屌鱼，还有什么小鱼卖吗？！不要攻击我的人，有事报警，找法院、政府要赔偿，我们是无辜的、不该长期受黑恶攻击，不玩啦！再说毒品攻击对我没啥作用。  这么低级下流的招式也想骗我？！喝多少打警察没事儿口味假酒？赶紧把人给我放了，把大疯屎冲走厕所拆了。说了多少次不准欺负我粉丝，她们是无辜的？有本事冲我来呀？！再欺负我粉丝砍你们二十几刀，伤口塞上蒜泥、盐，拿绷带包上腌好了，再把你们前后两面用搓澡巾擦出一层嘎巴儿，送给非洲食人族做早餐去！
i love that she eats lip scrubs
Song stealer is all I got to say! And many other things
My dad and I have the same problem when we were required to wear masks. Me and my dad broke out like crazy but we used special cream and wipes to help and everything is gone but a few ones that im working on.
I love  your  song  you  r so  pretty
Quero ser atriz e estilista e uma modelo<3
Everybody's talking about her confidence and how genuine she is but also look at her LIPS!!! What on earth is she ...he lips o m y god😍😍😍
Ew
rose和BLACKPINK已经被我隔离保护了，游戏局请不要总播放她们的画面，尤其是别人假扮她们的画面。请不要在未100%确认的情况下让她们在游戏休息室等候，请不要让她们参与任何和游戏中我的粉丝的互动活动，请不要拿特权引诱她们参与外围游戏活动，请不要欺骗、催眠我说rose自己愿意参与游戏救人或者打击黑恶魔鬼势力，把她强行拉到游戏休息室等候，长期惊吓她们。请不要剥夺我在有人偷袭情况下加游戏点数保护她们的权利！谢谢！！！请不要让对手派间谍制造假安全感，欺骗她们自己走向危险活动区域。请不要展示深藏不良动机的她们的假视频，趁我没仔细研究造谣说我输了然后把黑道、精神病才容易看懂的恶意报复视频变成现实、变成伤人事件攻击她们。rose和BLACKPINK已经离开游戏了，请不尽量不要再提起她们！更不要让魔鬼提起她们！！！（我愿意付钱。）请不要以rose出现为条件把其他游戏者再拉回游戏攻击她们，也不要以缩短可以放出他们期限为条件让对手在短时间内加强攻击我引出rose。请不要在被我识破的情况下退还给对手一定游戏点数，让她们可以改规则转向攻击其他人！请看住疯狂的游戏者别让她们派流氓骚扰到rose她们。请不要以远离游戏为条件，使她们在短期内日子过的难受！请不要搞的我们这么危险，公然放魔鬼出来操控我，稍微一念之差我们就全部暴露在危险之中，这不公平！！！请不要造谣说我对她们已经不敢兴趣了，甚至希望她们让位离开，以这种低级方式报复她们让她们伤心！！！  rose and blackpink is left, they can never show up, please forget about them for short term.谢谢大家的爱和理解！！！！！！！！！！！

HELP WHY IS SHE SO PRETTY 😩

So happy she’s real about acne and stuff, I’m her age and I feel like I’m always self conscious about my acne, but that’s what happens! I’m a teenager, I have acne!
I have the same style haircut, a kind of grown out curtain bang and I always hated it but seeing Olivia have the same style gives me confidence ❤
I love your makeup!

oww, she is so kind, I love her, i started to see her because my besti is a big fan and now I understand the love that the fans have to her<3
Why I am watching this ☹️, I am a boy and I have test tomorrow 😭
"eyeliner's are sisters, not twins" best thing I've ever heard
"Nobody's face is actually symmetrical’' Her face:*symmetrical*
Kyuutt 🥺
95 cometares
"in makeup less is more, just accentuating your natural features is always the move" well said Olivia, finally someone agreed that makeup is not always about covering up your face with foundation and eye shadows. I think for me also it's a way to enhance your already present beauty. Love this girl about this. Also love her songs. Fighting! Olivia. 💙💙
She does not need makeup
UR GORGEOUS
I like your few songs
I don’t need to do anything to my eyebrows because the are thicker 😂
Can someone link the BB cream?? pls
she's beautiful and i like her laugh, it's funny=))))

She is so natural and she looked like clean? Her make up iş so clean. i loved it.

I love how her beauty products were affordable by most teenagers like her. Sleek and chic.
She's so relatable! She genuinely talks about teenage problems like acne and oily hair and doesn't just pretend she's some perfect person with the perfect features.
Ultra pro max legends are watching this after 2022 grammy's lmaoo**
love love love love love you
So appreciate her and her love for her skin and age appropriate makeup ( in the sense she’s not packing it on to look older just embracing her features!) Bravo
She is LOVELY ♡♡
I lover her, she's amazing and I needed her on Vogue videos
No te intendi ni mierda mi amor pero aun asi te amo
She has that red ring on!!
Olivia you are like the best
in all honesty.. that much make up is a downfall.. just keep true.. and beautiful.. no amount of make up will make you as gorgeous as ypu already are
She’s so pretty, i dont feel bored watching this until the end without skip
She looks kind of like Catriona Gray
what kind of serum did she use?
"jiji"
Her skin is perfect like her music. My favorite is jealous, jealous.  KEEP IT UP OLIVIA😁😄😀
Girl!! Where is your moisturiser and your SUNSCREEN?!?!?!?!?!
she really did have on tm blush at the grammys😭😭she still looked amazing
Why doesn't vogue support nicki Minaj ? No 57 question interview...no metgala dress up video not even those slow red carpet videos that everyone gets to do ?  Why why why it's been over 10 years what's wrong   Why don't you support her !!!!!!!
me watching this now to get stared by the Kim Taehyung
SHE SOOO GORGEOUS!!!!
Me:"This IS OLIVIAS REAL FACE SHE LOOKS LIKE A  KPOP IDOL?!"
I can’t believe she doesn’t need moisturiser! How does she have such beautiful skin without it!?
I love Olivia!!
Wtf when I startt listening her voice I can't skip but go on . Did her voice has a power
Wait she's 18??? I thought she was in her 20s

Eyeliners are sisters not twins - so tru
she's so pretty, just natural and herself💕
You are so pretty 😍  I love  you songs 🎵
Prettiest Woman
She’s obsessed with glossier
I looove love 💕 Olivia
Olivia: The biggest thing I've learned in makeup is "less is more".  Yeah sis but I don't got skin like yours where I have big pores, dark spots, acne blemishes, and dull skin. Like, I really wanna go out without makeup or do natural makeup like her but I still need to sometimes cover my face up in a big event 😔
Tell how many times she said "when I was younger" 😂
one word to explain her : perfect
Stop because she’s so pretty I live watching celebrities do their makeup
The fact that she didn't even put eyeshadow and she still looks perfectly gorgeous and beautiful is making my self esteem just crazy skdbdkdbdsk
You look beautiful
Shes so beautiful. Can be a movie star too
I have a question did that actually happen to u?
That's me fav song
And traitor
I love ur songs♥️
No one can compare to anyone with BILLIE EILISH
What was the "ordinary" serum's name???
I love how she is so like honest and loving. ❤️❤️❤️
I love herrr
Honestly shes a fake, stealing peoples covers, music and asthetic. In 2050 shes litrally gonna be writing abt that heartbreak. The way she wrote and album and a single abt two people but when they get death threats she does nothing. She’s actually. Really rude
She's so fun and cheerful 🤩🤩 she radiates a good vibe
she looks really pretty and i like how she is all natural and super genuine.
I  cant believe she's 18 i thought she's 25 omg
her natural lip color is so pretty omg
her energy tho...too much sugar
i love the fact that she looks *real.* like, she's a teenagers and i'm a teenager, it's refreshing to see that people in your age looking real and not photoshopped or anything.
She's definitely me and I'm definitely her❤❤❤❤❤
wild guess but i think she likes glossier 🤨?
I really surprise when she says she is 18 ,so young meanwhile me watching cartoons all day😂
she's so sweet
<3
I love you 💕
i love her vibes
Loved it... Very real and genuine beauty routine for sure. But I'd like to see *skincare routine* of her too.
I love how natural, honest, genuine and dow to earth she is
SHE SO CUTE 💟
Filipino blood 🇵🇭
eyeliners are sisters not twins LMAO I LOVE HER
The ringgggggg
I need iris apatow and Leslie mann
She is so pretty😭
can we talk about  her amazing  hair  i am jealous
She looks beautiful with  or without makeup!
I love how raw her face is
WHY IS SHE SOO PRETTY WITHOUT MAKEUP
Ich gucke dieses Video jetzt schon zum dritten Mal . Weiß nicht warum.😁😅
Katriona gray eres tú?
Love her!!!
What bronzer did she use?
This girl is so pretty god
Cringe
im olivia's age, and we have similar tone skins, hair, and features. i've only recently started to get into make up, and it's been really hard to not go overboard with it! i have strong facial features and it's really notorious if i have any type of make up that it's not natural or soft, so it's been hard to find a routine to help me with it, but olivia's routine has been of so much help!!! i'll check out the products she uses, because she looks so pretty and natural with them (more than usual, at least)!! thank you vogue for having her :D
hermosaaaaaaaaaaaa
I love tutorial vogue is Nice
o inglês dela é bem fácil de entender pra gente que não é nativo da língua inglesa, as palavras parecem já saírem traduzidas
I have legit the rosiest checks ever so I don’t need blush, I only need bronzer and I luv it
Her jawline is everything
no one: absolutely no one: olivia every 5 seconds: "when I was younger..."  love u tho
she gives me mbb vibes
So, the first thing I do is... be 18.
I feel like she doesn't need make up at all
I love your songs
I love that she loves her birth mark
The most relatable video I have seen /realistic well to normal people
She's so pretty
she’s so cute and genuine. one of my favorite people
Y'all supporting these young kids seriously ppl should stan some mature artists too seriously must
olivia actually reminds me a lot of conan
Sh edoesn't need makeup
Is it me or did anyone else notice the Love ring that Taylor gave her here? She's wearing it!!
I love you
5:20 “its very subtle but i know it’s there”- perfect example to show that women wear make up for themselves
Her vibe is just so nice <3333
Olivia: less is more when it comes to skin care Me: tell Madelaine petsch that Btw I love them both ahahaha
She's pretty inside and outside
no you are glowing and perfect
I love how she is so honest and original and she is still so iconic.
Honestly, I have a lot of respect for Olivia. A lot of people, celebs or not, always feel the need to cover everything up. While Olivia enhances her features. There is a big difference. She has natural beauty, and the light and glowy look is amazing on her. It shows that she really doesn't care about other people's opinions on her looks. She seems comfortable with her looks and I love that as a celeb, we have people like her to look up to.
I rlly forgot the vibe she gives off and missed em
i looove how minimal her skin care routine is
i feel like she would be such a kind supportive friend
I miss her so bad!! I need more Olivia's content
Ember is my name I’m on a different account tho and I love how it’s her favorite lipstick.
Olivia is such a cool, positive and talented person!
To be honest, at the beggining is was not a fan of Olivia R. But she has such a fun and nice personality!!!
Pretty
Olivia is a queen 👸 ✨ 😍
omg ima big fan 🤩
Her with her eyeliner 👌me with mine😱
She is sooo pretty!!!!

DISTRACTING MUSIC

I love this girl, we need to protect her
Olivia is so pretty with or without makeup
olivia is such a genuine person i love her so much
i have the same milk mascara and i LOVE IT so much, definitely recommend
I just don't know what is the makeup's job here because she looks so beautiful without it though
You are so beautiful and I love your music 🎵
Oliiviaaaaaaa loveeee youuu alotttttttttt
She is lovely omgggg I love her
She so beautiful and charming. I hope she never gets plastic surgery. I mean it's fine but almost every beautiful person we see in Hollywood has had procedure done.   So I think it's healthy if we also see and consider someone who's never had surgery, beautiful.
I HAVE THE SAME LIP BALM AS OLIVIA RODRIGO
which ordinary serum did she use?
I can't believe people are comparing this girl to Britney Spears......not even on the same planet as Britney. This girl will be passé in no time.
Olivia Rodrigo is gorgeous <3
Shes so young but she look a bit older..
You look like a princess
its done
i also pretend im doing one of these when I do my skin care
I love she talks and raves about the stretch concealer but then she opens it and it’s got all the product in it and looks like she’s using it for the first time 🤣
Honestly tho, she is amazing, beautiful, smart, adorable, funny, and I love her ❤️ she is an icon, she is a legend, and she is the moment
oliviaaa use sunscreen
why didn't I know that Olivia was Asian? :)
We want to see black pink makeup routine
Didn't didn't you play in high School musical the series??
ok but olivia is so cute😭💞💞
i use serum the same way….straight on the face gang
Did she use any Glossier products?
She is so beautiful in and out😢😢💓💓💓 Love you Olivia💓💓
does anyone know which The Ordinary serum is she using? ☺
Not Vogue putting Sabrina Carpenter as the next up recommended video 💀💀
LOVE that she didn’t use any eyeshadow!! Am I the only one that thinks everyone looks better without it??
OMG you are so pretty
I didn’t know much about her as a person, but I really enjoy her personality, she’s adorable! Love this type of makeup look.
ok. For the glossier beauty bag.... does it actually come with the skincare or is it just a bag??
Ficou horrível
She is naturally beautiful
She inspires me so much I love her :) she’s so accepting and humble
Oh my gosh I love her so much ❤️❤️✨
Not her saying "maskAraaAa" and me thinking "ohh she's got a good voice" and then remember "she's fricking Olivia Rodrigo" lollllll
the loml
she’s a brunet barbie
This is why i like Olivia bcz she is a celebrity with an expanded vocabulary you can tell the girl went to school
I love your skin care routine
Shes so Pretty like what❤️-
Olivia: "nobody's face is actually symmetrical" girls on tik tok under the sound Deja Vu
She’s so perfect omg and her eyes are dreamy I keep staring at it
Aim high Pinay!
“Eyeliners are not twins, theyre just sisters” 🤣
I can see that her parents could be Izzie Stevens and Alex Karev omg
the more I look at Olivia thee more I see that she kinda looks like Catriona Gray
Böylelerini ünlü yapıyorlar ya Ne özelliği var Allah aşkına sesi de güzel değil ayrıca
She's not even have eye bags😭
I just love Olivia Rodrigo  So much!
01:52 I prefer purple color too 💜💜💜
Idk why but i love her... 🌼🧡
MAscArAaAaaA
girl your skin is amazing! don't ever give up on what your doing!
She's wearing taylor's ring🥺
can someone tell me if her bangs are natural or she got them done? thanks
i love how she gives a shoutout to billie
i love you so much your my fav i love you
she's literally a girl version of Conan 🥰
Where can I get the hair clips she used for her makeup?!!🤍🤍🤍
"eyeliners are sisters not twins"
Glossier should sponsor Liv
nice glossier ad
she's so cute I love her
'Eyeliners are sisters not twins' the queen has spoken.
Girl you don’t need makeup your are beauty just the way you are
I love how She doesn’t cake her face with foundation and concealer like lots of other ppl. You can barely tell the difference with and without makeup, so you can tell she is so naturally beautiful
She looks like 2018 miss universe, Catriona grey
You can totally see that gua sha’s effect right after she used it
Why do make up you are all ready beautiful! <3
🤑😗☺💕
Effortless right, you still got to shower.
She is just so freaking adorable
One thing that I have learned was  I LOVE THIS GIRLLLLLL😭❤️💅🏻💖💓💕💞💝
I love how beautiful and yet so refreshingly down to earth she is 💜💜💜
I love how she doesn’t shave her armpits and shows them like that, “natural”
that "hehe" made my day
Cantik sekali ❤😍
her personality is just so relatable, no one has perfect skin, and she doesn't try to look perfect. she is so wholesome
so down to earth, authentic, and well-spoken. im literally praying that she'll keep this beautiful personality and the music industry wont be a negative influence for her
Wow I loved the makeup 😩🦋.
I love her sm
I love her she’s so sweet 🥺
Olivia is so sweet and radiates such positive energy❤️ Also, please tell me I'm not the only one who just found out that she is only 18!?😭
She's so friendly with us OMG I LOVE HER 🥰
She really doesn’t do anything because she knows she doesn’t need anything
Words green dollhouse perfect picture please don’t let guess I better wash my mouth out with soap and she’s conect with her baby your skin is warm like a oven your kiss is candy cane I’m going back I’m not be happy for you, you’re it’s bad with my and I’m te odio say my name sorry she’s getting on my nerves you don’t love her I’m do it but she’s…you don’t believe in my and you son smoking cannabis

Olivia Rodrigo reminds me of Billie Eilish
My favorite thing abt her makeup routine is that she doesn’t go crazy with the makeup and especially with the mascara she didnt go crazy with it, she kept it simple and it ended up looking amazing!
I love Olivia she’s literally one of my fave rate singers I loveee her music! <3
she is  not a show off or a oh im so perfect kinda gurl she is just herself and real olivia:im not perfect  me:BRH UR THE DEF OF PERFECT LITARY SOO PRETTY GOOD SIING AND BESTTT SONGS AND ALSO BESTEST HAIRRR
4:45- That's so contagious lol
she is so sweet
She’s so young & genuine, I hope the world doesn’t destroy her.
I think Guasha is a Japanese product and sounds Japanese. Well, as matter of fact Olivia is half Asian on her father's side specifically Filipino and her mother has German and Irish ancestry. I mean her dad is Filipino American or Asian American as they call it in America and her mom is white or Caucasian American.
I think I'm falling for her
She's beautiful and her songs are good
Even her hands and nails are beautiful lol
I hate you Olivia Rodrigo your fans Attacked Sabrina carpenter  and Joshua   bassett  your fan Almost killed Joshua

I love youuu
My heart went oops when she said “Billie Eilish’s makeup, it’s so glowy and perfect”
Idk why but she always stunnes me

Is it just me or does she really look like the Korean actress Lee Se Young
3 months later and I just realized it was a sponsored video. To me it makes it less genuine now. No wonder the first time I've watched this it feels so sponsor-ey the way she talks about each glossier products, even showing us the bag for it. It was odd but now I know.

Honestly, she is just such a gorgeous woman.
What ordinary serum is she using nicinamide or vitamin c?
I'm 31 yo and she's my current new muse. I'm genuinely impressed with Olivia's talent and personality and girls like Billie Eillish, Willow Smith and Angela Aguilar. The ladies aren't even 20 and they are setting a wonderful example for the generations to come<3
Your 18?! Your like an young adult❤
This girl is SOOO beautiful!!! And she is really really sweet and seems super friendly! Like who could ever hate her! 🥰🥰😊😊❤️❤️

I feel like if they redid the movie Twilight, she should *definitely* play bella. Light skin, dark hair and dark eyes, she's short!  I think she'd be perfect for the part. 😊
I'm falling in love with her songs, personality, beauty etc. and I can't help myself :)
i really wondering how Billie Eilish does her make up routine
that thumnail tho, looks like she's like .     .                                                                    👄
i can watch her all day long
PLEASE how do you eat those things....I literally gag
her skin care is called being 18 lmao
She’s acting like she’s a 30 when she says when she was a kid. You’re 18. Still too young.
she is a freakin kid.
She sucks😕😑
i love her so much
Shes 18 :o she too good for 18
No offense but she looks way better with out makeup
Love U🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Oh my gosh Olivia is the best singer ever I listen to everyday and I'm the same age as her I never got to go to a concert but when I'm old enough I'm going to meet Lee go to a concert my favourite song that's ever sang is probably driver's license
omg she is so sweet <33
She is totally perfect💝
Remember when Olivia rodrego was in Bizaardvark

i like her but one thing about her which i dont like is her attitude no offense for fans but for army the thing is recently she has realeased an album which crossed bts butter at that time she advertised for song by giving caption which really made me hate her a lot by being her fan the caption was : good 4 u which has crossed the butter i mean the meaning was this but i cant remember the sentence soo... yeaa i would love her if she changes that rude attitude of her which really hurt bts and army iam telling this becuz iam an army r there any army's here who too suffered in this situation pls comment me ....... *NOTE : I HAVE NO HATE ON OLIVIA *

Made a cover of Oliva's amazing song Drivers License. It would mean the world if you would check it out <3 :)
this is the girl who doesnt use auto tune in their songs and always stays beautiful in the inside and the outside <3
I wonder if she's heard of the Olive Oil Road Dry Go comment memes 💀✋🏻
Why would people despise her? She is incredibly sweet and has a nice sense of humor.
She’s so pretty 😭
EXCELLENT ADVICE!! Less is more. Accentuate what you have. But my absolute favorite was when she DIDN’T put that stupid highlight on the end of her nose that the herd of followers are doing, even though it looks like a stupid lightbulb and clownish. And she applied her brow to the NATURAL SHAPE already there. Again NOT following the herd and drawing on those ridicules looking squared off eyebrows all the followers are doing. SHE IS HERSELF!! And that makes her absolutely beautiful.
she’s so lovely
“okay cool”
I just can’t she’s way too perfect
ARMY PURPLE U ALL ARMY💜

*american up-and-coming celebrities tend to be very.. dull? I suppose good looks is the chief criteria the industry sets. Also by her demeanour I can tell her managers are definitely in control of her choices and money.*

I really love her! She's so relatable and down to earth. I wish I would've been that kind of person when I was a teenager. Also, she's so pretty.  But still, she's like "I'm only 18, so my skin isn't perfect" and I'm like "I'm nearly 26 and my skin is a lot more looking like a teenager's than yours probably ever has" 😭😭😭
she's so sweet
Jesus loves you ❤🙏🏽

Wait... "SORRY", i got some "deja vu"
wow she doesn’t have on lipstick
i hate her i like her at first but she is mean
She's already beautiful without makeup
I feel so comfortable listening to her... I mean, sometimes I think they tend to just show their routines and just that... But with Olivia, I feel a lot closer! She talks about her life too and says things about herself. I feel so relaxed.
Listening to Drivers License made me a fan of her. I totally don't know her yet that time and was shocked when I learned that she's only 18. Then De Javu came in, I wonder why her songs are painful. It'll take you to the mood that even if your not heartbroken or stuff like that you can't help but to put it on repeat.  Then SOUR was out. I just love all the songs. There's beauty with her voice, the lyrics, and the way she sings that made me listen to her songs every day. In other words, I love her!
ok so her nose is everything
where did u get the hairclip? its cute!
She’s beautiful ✨

She looks like my Maya dd
I love how she is naturally herself
when you realize shes not even wearing lipstick, her lips are just naturally that red
Why does this video have so many dislikes compared to likes? Unless I'm reading the numbers wrong!  Edit: My bad i read them wrong. I for some dumbass reason thought 3.1K meant 3.1 million lmao

Her lips are such a nice colour

If you told me she was 23 I wouldn't bat an eye
she is absolutely stunning and effortlessly beautiful even without makeup ❤️

She is not a teenager now she is an adult
why does she act like she’s a minor , she’s 18 like sis ☠️
I should really get that
I hope Olivia, Conan, Troye, etc. lead this generation back to unique, real, fresh-faced beauty. Not the Kardashian/Jenner bold-is-best, homogenous,  bratz doll look.
Guys idk but I think she likes glossier
I love the "hehe" 1:28
She's so calm and kind
I love how she loves everything
people told her to get rid of the birth mark on her face.   Olivia: "no. I just like it."  Toxic beauty standards destroyed in a second!

I was just watching her on Bizaardvark

Oh no girl , you’re not using a. Sunscreen?? Then nothing will have any impact to your skin 💀 please , i love her but if there is spf in a product it’s there , it’s better , but that doesn’t makes up for an spf cream which should be applied the last
I'm a guy but I watched this all the way, and I can honestly say that her makeup is only the second best thing in this video, the first one is her personality
Her teeth are so perfect 😍
She seems really mature and fun to be around, i like these type of celebs.

I love this girl❤️she is so pretty🥺
I love listening to her speaking voice sm...Anddd Olivia plsss stop mentioning your age..it just reminded me how old I am,and uh a living avocadoooo😭💜
U try to act so innocent 😇 yet u write a song 👿 attacking Sabrina then lie about it not being about her. She got death threats bec of u and that’s just rude. That’s selfish of u. U can write a song about Joshua B all u want but just leave Sabrina alone. Why r u coming for her.
She’s literally only a celeb bc of 1. Disney and 2. Writing a song and attacking Sabrina just bc a guy doesn’t like her. Ik u wouldn’t like getting death threats either so leave her ALONE.
Stop ✋ bringing Sabrina  into the drama. Ur being selfish, if u wanna write songs about Joshua Basset go ahead but leave Sabrina out of this. She’s getting death threats bec of u. Like leave her alone. What’s wrong with u.
The reason she’s more popular is cause we understand her more than any other actress & singer and she’s so happy and humble too
My cheeks are most of the time are hella red  (almost purple lmao) so I hate blush and I tried to cover them but she looks amazing with that blush tho
yooo when she said that's the natural color of her lips 😭😭😭
She named billie eilish 😪😪😪😪
she’s soo naturally pretty
ok am i the only one who did not think she's 18?????? 😳
i love her vibe
New crush unlocked 💖
Que natural ... Que hermosa ya sea por el makeup y también por su actitud
She reminds me of Millie Bobby Brown.  Adorable 💗
Her skin is perfect! Natural makeup look is also a trend nowadays because it does not require too much effort..
I'm about to turn 18 in a few months...her life is so much more together than mine, I mean holy-
I am a teenager, I'm 18" OLIVIA, UR AN ADULT!
"I have the most oily hair" *puts hair oil in her hair"  Lmao I love her but I do the same thing bc my roots are always naturally oily and the rest is frizzy

**natural twerking**
She looks the same with or without makeup
I don't understand how people can let down their hair while doing makeup and skincare....i need all that hair to go up otherwise I can't move or see at all
Will anyone talk about the fact that she does not change a lot?  What I mean that she does not lose her essence. She is a Goddess ❤️
I love her so much, she’s so precious <33
Out of curiosity, is she sponsored by Glossier or anything like that?
this was better than dixie's 24hr vid lmao
The fallacious weather exclusively bat because rake occasionally want concerning a acrid net. damaged, exultant brass
Is it just me thinking this, she kind'a looks like Catriona Gray.

Olivia is so pretty! can vouge like my comemnt?✨ even though I’m late.
She is so perfect and well-spoken. It is so refreshing to see a young person, who speaks so open and candidly. As a 19-year-old girl, I feel it is so easy to get wrapped up in social media's perception of perfect, beautiful women. Olivia, you are a natural, kind beauty, thank you <3
She's relatable... Except for that She's so beautiful...and wise...
she looks a lot like catriona gray which isn’t surprising because both are filipino
Totally obsessed with her

Olivia Rodrigo I LOVE YOUR SONGS
this video could have been a 5 second vine and she would still be beautiful
I really like the way she speaks and her mannerisms are so adorable. She is naturally so beautiful. Just a reminder girls and guys wear an actual sunscreen because you use little amount of bb creams and their spfs aren’t enough!!
Just here to keep falling in love

i need that dry shampoo
We can see that you're introverted by your video love you sm 🥰🥰❤
I wish I was friends with her 😭💗
no hate Olivia dear just a reminder but I'm sure you've heard of this at some point, but yeah it's not really advisable to put the dropper directly on the face cuz that allows the bacteria on your face to further be in contact with the dropper, so it's better truly to put it on your hands then put it on your face! God bless!
GUYS WHY DOES SHE LOOK LIKE BLACKPINK ROSÉ??!!? 😭😭🥺
Olivia Rodrigo's songs are the kind I was dying to hear for a long time She is the perfect angel, a dream girl and has the sweetest voice I love her moon and back ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
she’s so gorgeous and pretty it hurts 🥺😩
Ikr anyone else who can make a unibrow look beautiful
Why is a teeeeeeeen putting on serum. Goodness.
Only the OG’s of Olivia Rodrigo remember or know Bizardvark.

THATS MY FAV GIRL
She has the prettiest lips

I love this hairstyle
So beautiful olivia
she’s such a beautiful soul
ディズニーチャンネルでずっと見てたから年上かと思ってたら同い年やったの！？！
3:40 Is that--- Harry's clips 😱😌🖐️ Like Nobody talk to me 😂🙏
Am I falling in love with her?  Lol
Sometimes i forgot she's 18 :))
Cant believe I watched 10 minutes of glossier ad
i love this
she is so beautiful
She is such an inspiration
I just love her😍😍😍🥰💖
She can pass as Miss Universe 2018’s little sister! 😍 she resembles Catriona at some point💗
Olivia really looks like catriona gray
She’s so pretty stop
her clips😭😭
She’s so pretty.
do y’all know what blush she used? it’s so pretty
I’ve been waitin foe this one!
I just really love the way she speaks? She looks comfortable in front of camera. She is also soooooo pretty and i loved her makeup
anya taylor joy NEEDS to do this
which bb cream did she use!
she looks so much like Catriona Gray!!!
Girl where's the moisturizer and SPF? It's the most important step
she was like... when I was younger...XD
do dua lipaaa
I'm seeing Catriona gray on her
She's wearing the ring Taylor gave her 😭
Thai makeup is nice 👍🏽
HOW IS SHE SO PRETTY WITHOUT MAKEUP-
I was watching this video and suddenly my mom came to my room. She saw you and now she keeps telling me that '' how beautiful she is?'' '' who is she?'' she's like kinda obsessed with ya.
i’m so proud of this girl. she is loved by the masses because of who she is: how well spoken she is, how kind and genuine, how talented in many aspects, etc. A LOT of people get famous for random things these days and then get completely turned on once they get a large amount of following bc people don’t like that they did nothing (or very little) for fame but olivia will probably continue to have such a loving and supporting fan base because she is genuinely talented and a wonderful person on top of it all.
I don't use make-up, i'm here because i have nothing to do.
taambem sofro disto, meus lábios racham muito
Yo: like  Yo: no entiendo pero me encanta 💖
What's Olivia's Hair, Eye, & Skin Color/Tone?
What's Olivia's Birthday & Birthplace?
1.What's Olivia's Ethnicity, Race, & Nationality?  2.What's Olivia's Parents, Grandparents, & Siblings?  3.What's Olivia's First, Middle, & Last Name?
She's. Only. 18.wait..... let. That. Sink.  In. 😳
She's so prettyyyy
I just love how real she presents herself. Like gurl she exposed herself for having skin breakouts and oily hair. Sis is really genuine.
how does it feel to be god's absolute favorite ; -;
isn’t this the girl that keeps on making the same song well not the same song but same guy in the song?
Why does she pronounce her last name as Rod-rigo and not Ro-drigo?
she is the type of girl my mom would be impressed by :D
does anyone know what BB cream she uses
In the middle of Bizaardvark I was thinking if one of them were actually gonna be singers and trying to picture what they would look like but my imagination was way worse than what they really look like now
So nobody is gonna talk about how much she looks like Jessica Alba...
is this 🐰🚫
shes so so beautiful jesus
Olivia's Skin is flawless she honestly doesn't need makeup <333
We love you
Why is she like the most down to earth/amazing person ever 🥺
OMG SO MUCH FUN ILOVEIT🤩
We need kaia gerber
Shes already beautiful without full make up...naturally beautiful
introvert my foot.
I DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS 18 WTF?!
being an 18 year old has been  effortless beauty already =))) said Millennials
The way she talks sounds like Bella Thorne
i've never watched one of her interviews but this has just made me love her more
When you have loved Olivia since bizardvark/Disney
She is so pretty.
She said she's an introvert right?
1 weeks ago omg Hi Bye!
she´s so likeable 🥺
She is so pretty even without make up.
_I actually enjoyed this video_
Wait do u have to apply face wash when ur skin is dry? I always do face wash when my face is wet.
So she was born on 2003?
there's something about her that makes me love her
the natural beuty thooo
Her face and voice have matured. She doesn’t look like a teenager anymore~
She looks like Catriona Gray
Love liv 💘
UMMMM BUT WOW SHE IS GORGEOUS!
NO WAY I LITERALLY DO THE SPOOLY HAIRPRAY THING
she looks so alike to Miss Universe, Catriona Gray
I like how they didn’t even disclose that this was a sponsorship with glossier but o k (check the desc. “Produced by Vogue with Glossier” and the only products in the “shop this beauty routine” section are glossier products although the ordinary and fab are used too 🤷)
kinda look like Millie Bobby Brown
you're so pretty
“Eyeliners are sisters not twins”
i just love her <3
Okay but what mascara did she use because WOW
Plss we wont to know what olivia Rodrigo outfit wears in a week 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
W or w/ makeup she is so pretty 😍❤️
i am actually obsessed with her omg
Such a beauty, inside and out ❤️
Such a beautiful young lady
love her
omg how is she soooooo pretty!!? 😵😵
Love her <3
I used to dislike her for some unknown reason and went against listening to her music and videos, but she’s honestly so beautiful and her music is amazing, and she’s grown on me.
I really like the message she is promoting about makeup being used to accentuate ones features! She’s good at it too! 💖
Let’s just appreciate the fact that Olivia’s programs are totally free, accessible and helped so many people around the world 😊🤚👏
Ok, I'll stan her now.
What a lovely girl. She is that rare female beloved by both men and women.
You look sooo beautiful with or without makeup💕 your a natural beauty ♥️♥️😘

Finally a bathroom that is not the size of my house
don't use burt's bees chapstick!!!! there's a lot of brands like carmex, chapstick, EOS that all dry out your lips bc they contain benzocaine/menthol & so u feel like u have to use more chapstick (aka more $$$ for those companies)
1:51 "purple" maybeeee...army?💜
@skinbyhyram
step 1: vaseline | step 2: ur done      ez money

It's the second time I saw her talked about Billie Eilish like PLEASE DO A COLLAB✨✨✨
Burts Bees products have broken my mother's skin out and actually caused sores on her lips. My mother and I have sensitive skin. I am saying this because I saw that you used Burts Bees brand lip gloss.
the heck your 18 im about to cry
idk why i just love this girl
I already hear Hyram screaming WHERE'S THE MOISTURIZER!? WHERE'S THE SUNSCREEN!?
I thought vogues was for A list celebrity’s 🧐 guess they’d take anyone
so pure
"eyelines are sisters not twins" this made me feel better about my eyeliner
I just realized that Olivia Rodrigo played Grace in the american girl doll movie 😮😮😮😮
she’s beautiful
Do they go to a set or does every celebrity’s bathroom look like this
Omg what she doing in Vogues Channel ?
She is literally sooo pretty! Natural beauty!
I loved her since HSTMTS and I am really proud she is getting enough attention now
kim said the same thing about blush making u look awake n happy! omg ly
OMIGOD THE KYLIE CLIPS-
https://youtu.be/MkX4irHI7oQ
She is so beautiful
Use my code on TikTok: J9608808
She says Billie's makeup is perfect i would call hers beyond perfect     But seriously she doesn't need makeup like she beautiful already
I TAKE THE SAME GUMMIES AS HER LMAOO
I love that she talks kind of fast. <3
when you say your hair is oily but you put more oil on it xDDD (no hate ily so much!!)
She's a sweetheart but OLIVIA SWEETIE PUT ON SUNSCREEN!!!!
woww
She is sooo pretty, I love her
BEAUTIFUL
I could watch her speak for hours
OMG- I REMEMBER JUST WATCHING HER ON BIZARDVARK- SHES GROWN SO MUCH- 😫🤚
https://youtu.be/TIzChkkvBVw
Bro u literally just create song about Joshua B like are u that obsessed he’s moved on so go and cry about it and leave him and Sabrina alone. Obviously he likes her better
She has this CATRIONA GRAY aura!!!! Right???
God, she is so gorgeous ☺️ I cannot but keep staring at her smile and eyes 👀  such a rare combination of a pure talent and beauty, both inside and outside
<3
Olivia proved that she doesn't need makeup!
I love a good simple skincare/beauty routine💕 one thing though, it’s not good to use the dropper to apply products on your face because it’s not sanitary and  can cause more problems than good. It’s okay if your not actually touching it to your face and your just dropping the product onto it. What’s trendy might not be exactly what’s good for you. I know too that everyone’s got their preferences, just try to be safe about it. 😉😉
im so sorry you are so beautiful BUT WHERE IS THE SUNSCREEN
this guy has the best job ever
Awesome
I love her 😭
I think she is very beautiful and she doesn't need anything. Just her personality makes her glow.
when she said her lips aren't chapped but just peel all the time *i felt that* 😭😭😭
if anyone is looking for the lip scrub you can find it at sephora- Agave+ Weekly vegan lip scrub
Ella es tan linda por dentro y por fuera !!!!!  Me encanto todos los productos  que uso, en especial el Labial con Hidratante , esos productos se pueden conseguir por estos lares ?
1:28 that "hehe" she's so cute lol
can someone at vogue tell her not to put the dropper on her skin bc then bacteria gets in the bottle, also if its hyaluronic acid she needs to put on a little water since it absorbs it :)
She looks like Catriona Gray ngl. Both are Filipinas <3
With or without make-up, she's absolutely beautiful!  🥰
She kinda looks like Catriona And Julia Barreto😅
She sounds like Noah Centineo if he was a teenage girl
is she mixed? because i can see asian in her 😂
i agree with everything she said
Usando a vogue para fazer publi
I LOVE YOU LIVVVY🥺
she talks soo much but she is soo pretty
@Hyram pls react!!
She's actually gorgeous even without make-up
olivia is literally making me so happy. like, the way she's such an honest, natural & vibrant person.
Even without makeup, she still looks perfect 😒❤❤❤❤❤❤😭😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
She's so perfect 😭😍😍😍 !
Pretty girl. Vogue is for empty people.
*her doing her makeup is almost like the perfect example of a “full beat” makeup on the Philippines, simple, but makes a beautiful difference.*
she kinda looks like Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray☺️❤️
ilove the way olivia said hehe when showings us her make up bag😅❤
"my🥺cute🥺little🥺glossier🥺bag🥺hehe😌"
Oh, I thought it would be kajal mascara and tears

“Eyeliners are sisters not twins” twins have been ejected.  twins were the imposters.
she’s incredible and has a biiig future
Plssss get zendaya and Lily rose im BEGGING
When Olivia said she pretended to do the same thing in her bath room... I know all of us can relate-
I love her, she's so kind and I really feel identified with her
Wtff I was showering last night and was thinking that omg it would be so nice if Olivia did the vogue beauty video( i didn't know about this video btw) and now I see this omgg I am soo shocked its soo creepy! My phone recommended it after I talked about it!! My phones listening to me- omggg kinda creepyy😱🤯😭😩😂🤔🤨

Predicting that she’s gonna have a glossier collection in the future
Today I'm just watching all new liv interviews
She like catriona gray
is it just me or she kinda looks like julia barretto and a bit of andrea brillantes??
She is so beautiful just the way she is 💖 zero makeup .... She is beautiful😊✨☺
“symmetrical face”? “that’s very important”? HEATHER MACNAMARA?!

i love her but she sometimes looks like aerodactyl 😭 I'm sorry
can anyone tells me the name of all the products? thanks so much
She's really a pretty girl
what a lovely personality.
I don’t really like her tbh
i don’t get why some people talk abt her , she seems so down to earth . she seems happy . her songs be a lil sad to me but i love dem but it’s good to know she’s not a sad person . i love herrrrr
im calling out hyram..
I eat those gummies 😩 they are so good
shes very lively..i think the fame is helping her..she really deserves way better than josua
Bro, this girl is so pure! God bless u and protect u young girl ❤️🙏🏽
literally keep pretending in front of the mirror that I am doing a vogue video or is it just me 😌
Was this a glossier brand deal???
literalmente o melhor vídeo de Beauty Secrets da Vogue, amo esse quadro.
A Liv é tão linda tanto de maquiagem, quanto com a pele natural.
I wish i had a gf this humble like her :(
When lana??
🥺❤️
mirip maudy ayunda deeh
do ariana grande have one of these ? i wanna watch
Hey girl! Love ya, your music is amazing! 💖
Ugh i hate her
LIV. WHERES THE SUNSCREEN?!
🛐🛐
I want to know the background music. She's very pretty
olivia is the best friend we all need :]
She is so natural
How people can love this girl? She is trash. World need more artist like Sabrina Carpenter, she is a real singer, not like Olivia whatever say
overall i liked the tutorial, but i hate the saying “less is more” with makeup. if that’s your own personal preference that’s fine, but don’t act like that’s case for everyone, and like everyone should have to cater to that as well.
Get right with God  Yeshua will come soon  Repent
Shes so pretty , she is the only celebrity that made me feel like shes really 18 like me , like yea same i do that too , shes just so nice i love her
4:46 that's adorable
How dare her use products that are not cruelty free
I dunno this is like, so refreshing to watch her's is the most minimal i've watched so far  edit: and she's so pretty like, man.
am i the one who think she looks like catriona gray?
BYEE OMG I HAVE THE SAME PINK HAIRCLIPS AS OLIVIA NSHSVSAGGSG🤩💅💅💅💅💅
한복은 한국의 고유 전통 의상 입니다. 역사를 왜곡 하는 보그는 전통 도 역사도 없는 잡지사 인가요?  조사 하고 기사 넣으셨어요?
SHE IS SUCH A QUEEN😭
*this is so cute. I feel like I’m on FaceTime with her.*
Why is she suddenly popping up everywhere
This skincare is actually doable
I'm really passionate about your mission statement to :) Thanks For making this Olivia!!!
i love how youtube put sabrina's vogue makeup routine on autoplay
me in my bathroom pretending im in a youtube video:
YOU'RE ONLY 18? :O
am i the only one who always look at her teeth like theyre PERFECT
She is legitimately the most well~adjusted young woman✨
shes so gorgeous and sweet
WAIT! IT’S NOT TOO LATE TO REPENT, BUT SOON IT WILL BE. YOU’RE NOT PROMISED TOMORROW, REPENT AND ACCEPT JESUS AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR. DON’T DIE WITHOUT JESUS, IT’S A FEARFUL THING TO ENTER A “CHRIST-LESS” ETERNITY. GOD IS GOOD!🥰
Omg she's so positive and effortlessly beautiful with the simplest skincare and makeup routine
How could anyone ever hate her she is literally the most adorable person ever

Hey guys i hope you are all doing well. I'm gonna need your help today if you want to help.

amacina ulasti resmen taylor ustunden oyle bir prim kasti ki iki uc aylik primiyle bir dunya stari kadar populer oldu taylor olmadan bir hic ve butun ununu ona borclu millet daha once hsm’de oynadi diyor e kimse neden adini duymadi o zaman.. hsm donemindeki sarkilarinin dinlenmeleri de cok az.. cok iyi bir strateji uyguladi unlu olmak isteyen varsa bts, taylor veya blackpink’i kullanabilir.
omg i love her sm
ok i see her wearing the ring that taylor swift gave her
The asian brows tho

Is it just me or Olivia looks like Millie Bobbie Brown? 🤔
I actually thought she was 25+, no offence tho!
I’m the same age as her and Mommy kills me if she ever k ones I have put makeup on , she thinks I’m too young to put makeup on 😂

I liked the old pop up better. The size of the  font is literally so annoying . Bring back the minimal font

Ok!! Olivia’s the cutest!! I love the way she does her makeup she was just so chill and natural about the whole tutorial 💜💜💛💛
She’s so incredibly wise for an 18 year old, I could listen to her speak for hours
Hermosa Olivia Rodrigo eres una diosa, tan bella y encantadora
no moisturizer or sunscreen? okay...
i love the quiet confidence she gives off. she doesn't try to be "perfect" and instead she just loves her imperfections. what a sweet and pretty girl she deserves all the success coming her way ♥️♥️

"eyelines are sisters and not twins" - Olivia Rodrigo, 2021
https://youtu.be/GBa1SWRiegE
Omg she is gorgeous! I love that she knows how naturally beautiful she is & doesn't gob on tons of makeup. She excentuated her features & it looks magnificent! Less is more like she said. I wish my natural lip color was like hers! Ugh she's such a beautiful & talented young woman. & she's going to age like fine wine if she's already got a great skincare regimen & uses a gua sha! Get it girl!
I like how she’s really confident with her birth mark
moisturizer? spf????
Que adorable esssssss🥺❤️

I feel like instead of Olivia being a celeb she feels like a friend or cousin that I can talk to
is it just me or is she becoming hippie??

"wHiTe aNd cRuStY" brOwS

she is beautiful inside and out!!
Why does Olivia rodrigeo looks like Sydney Serena
omg she is sooooo pretty without make up beautyyy
Oh good grief. What is she, 18?! Come back in 40 years chick.
I’m so happy I’m not the only one who used to hairspray their eyebrows
What’s the name of the vitamin ?
« Less is more » yes hun, I wish more people knew that. For instance I personally can’t stand lip liner, it makes people look so fake and not pretty in my opinion 🙇‍♀️
Omg i love her so much😩❤️ Olivia supremacy 🛐
Olivia seems like such a nice person. She seems like she would be so fun to hang around and be with. She seems like an amazing friend!
How those people became a famous so fast I luv Her💓
I need a phone am using my mom's phone and dam I don't have the money for it 😢😭😭😭
For those that have ears let them hear our father God is coming back with his son Jesus that died on the cross years back and I’m not going to force you to worship but just know that Jesus will love you till the days John 3:15 l
nojao dest
she look like catriona gray omggg
Looks like Catriona Gray
She actually got the joke on how unsymmetrical faces are, cuz ppl on tiktok are using her song for the inverted effect 😂
Olivia and Catriona Gray could really passed as sisters 💙♥️
I’d love to be her friend
ok but I love her bathroom
uggh olivia your so gorgeous 😍
I’m so happy she shares my birthday 🥳
she gives me hailee steinfeld vibes, and I'm here for it
Soo pretty Olivia💚💚💚
ARIANA GRANDE NEXT ❕❕😩🥰
she looks like catriona
She is so pretty! She has a hint of Miss Philippines Catriona Gray!!! And crazy because she is well-spoken just like her! And they are of both white and Austronesian (Filipino) descent.
no hate but didn’t she have one big song and now she’s on vogue?
Does anybody know what blush she is using?
at this point,  they're just making these for Hyram to react to !!
Is it just me or does it look like every single celebrity has the same bathroom?😅
She's so naturally gorgeous
She's so naturally gorgeous
She's sooo sweet🥺🥺
In... I-Introvert?
i don't see much difference between olivia with make up and olivia without makeup.
Her voice always reminds me of my childhood. When I was watching "Grace stirs up success". The way she just talks make me feel nostalgic! ❤️
She feels familiar. She feels like a friend, and we're watching her doing her make up
Her hair makes me anxious when she's doing her routine, use a hair tie 😭😂
She's so real with herself and others that's a big thing.
omg her lashes are so long 🥺 i love it so much
I miss paige olvera 😩😩😩😩 u go olivia
She's so relatable love her.
she gave good make up tips  i also love how confident she is and how she reassures herself as well as how she loves to embrace her birthmark like leaving it on and not covering it with makeup ✨
she looks so kind
She's so prettyyy
Am I the only one who thinks she looks like Millie Bobby Brown in Enola Holmes and Catriona Gray?
PAGE I5 THAT YOU? WHERES FRANKY?!
She doesn't even need makeup...ur gorgeous
i'm just waiting for hyram to react to this
"when I was younger" BABY, YOU ARE STILL YOUNG
Some people say that she looks like Julia Baretto but I don't want Olivia to be compared to a snake. Olivia is prettier than her.
fad
i want a Conan Gray one plz
“Nobodys face is actually symmetrical” ironically people uses her song for that one tiktok challenge about being symmetrical 😂
The way she spoke screams ✨E D U C A T E D✨
It’s soooooo irritating when they don’t clip their hair and it’s all over the place
oh my God i fell in love with her- she's so calm and fun and like she doesn't give off the "popular girl" or "popular celebrity" vibes. She acts like she's just an ordinary teenager with normal skincare and makeup routine no one should be obsessed about ❤️ fyi i'm at the same age as her and i think she would be everyone's best friend just the way she isss 🥰
She look like Miss Universe Catriona Gray🥰
Wish I could be her friend 🥺
I love her whole vibe❤
Olivia rodrigo reminds me of miss universe catriona gray ✨
does anyone know what mascara she used??
she’s my wife btw😛
she looks a little like catriona gray
She is so adorable cute. Luv ur honesty ❤️❤️🎁💕💕💕🏠. Lol
So, Filipinos... Asannnn naaaaa kayooooooo??! Una si Miss Universe Catriona Gray, sunod si No. 1 sa Billboard for a lifetime na si Olivia Rodrigo? How proud are we??
Is it just me, or does she really look like Catriona ?
Ok I'm gonna say it .... olivia looks like catriona idk if its just me but wuteva🤷‍♀️💖
I love Olivia but baby u need ur sunscreen.
can we talk about how she's super pretty 🧚‍♀️
When is ariana’s turn
She looks like a mix of Catriona Gray and Dakota Johnson.
Olivia really looks like the nicest person that i honestly would really like to be friends with and she looks like she would help you with any problem and i love how she is so humble and is not afraid to be herself and express how she feels :) i love her sm
She’s so beautiful omg
Filipina beauty ❤🇵🇭
You're so pretty without make up 😍
She kinda look like Catriona in some angles
Her laugh reminds me of timothée chalamet
they should make one with billie eilish
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. (John 3:16-18)  Whoever is reading this, Jesus loves you. Yes you. He loves you with all your faults and all your brokenness. He wants a relationship with you. He wants to heal you and redeem you. He wants to save you. He not only loves you, but died for you and took your punishment and mine upon himself. A death he didn’t deserve but we did. If you have not given your life to him and accepted him into your heart and repent of your sins, I sincerely hope you make the decision to do so soon. We are not promised tomorrow. “Come close to God, and God will come close to you.” (James 4:8) God bless. ♥️
It’s the way she’s so beautiful with or without makeup
bro Sabrina Carpenter’s skincare video is right under thiss for me lol
Why olivia is talking to me like I was her bestfriend that she called on zoom
She's so gorgeous! How bout millie bobby brown?
Girlll 18 is treating you right!!! I thought you were older but in a good way 😂 you’re beautiful
LOVEEE YOUUYY
she's so nice 💗
She is so refreshing
So neka
18 but u look like 24
She sounds like such a sweet person 🥺🥺
she looks the same with and without make up
It’s interesting that she pronounces her name ROD-RIGO rather than ROD-DRI-GO  someone please relate to this lmfao
Her smiling is something i didn’t know i needed
If you want your hair to look less greasy you should put the hair oil on when your hair is wet
You can spend all day on a swing eating a baguette but why do boring things like that when there’s the internet
I love her and think that she’s so beautiful but she low key looks like Jodi Arias she could play her in a movie
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
HYRAM GOTTA REACT TO THIS
Petitions for Hyram to react🙋🏽‍♀️ 👇
She's so overrated
Olivia is never taking that golden ring off that Taylor Swift gave her
Acne is not just a teenage issue.. sorry to break it to you lol
She is such a sweetheart.  Hope she remembers to stay this way no matter what crap showbiz throws her way.
She’s so but so gorgeous! Oh my god!
please invite kaia gerber
She’s one of those people that says ur not fat ur perfect just the way u are 😂
When the Tik Tok symmetrical face trend is to her song 😂
finally vogue shows us someone we actually want to see
im obsessed with her eyebrows
she’s so pure 🥺😭💖 I love her
I can't believe that's olivia that i used to watch when i was 8 or 9 years old in bizardvark she actually had become so successful
Am I the only one who wants Jessica Alba and Olivia Rodrigo to be a mother daughter dou?
Olivia is so pretty! 💛
everyone here wanna be like her but i want her necklace
1:28 she really said   ✨h e e   h e e✨
she’s quite lovely, thanks for letting us hang out with olivia
She is so simple!!! Love that!!
Why isn’t she doing it in the car?
she has this like natural beauty/glow idkkk
how is she so pretty though.
No matter how many times I try I literally cannot do winged eyeliner to save my life 🤯 Her's is perfection 😩
Sabrina carpenters routine was right in the recommended. You ain’t slick Vogue
Ma un baffetto ed una pulita alle sopracciglia?
Eu eu acho que eles tem que ir pra um banehiro específico pra gravar isso pq todos sao iguais
omg please put more oil on your face before you use a gua sha tool!!! i physically can see you pulling your skinnn
she's literally the cutest. so genuine
She forgot bb cream around her mouth.
she's so beautiful 💖
Amo a Olivia Rodrigo
Is anyone gonna talk about her BANGSS!! GORGEOUS
Taylor really raised her daughter well
LOOL, NEXT.
Get Lily-Rose-Depp to do this!
"when i was younger" bro chill

WAIT SO SHES JUST NATURALLY THAT PRETTY?! 😃🤚 I LITTERALLY NEED SO MANY THINGS TO DO MY MAKE UP AND IM HORRIBLE AT EYELINER 👁👄👁
Which ordinary serum is that ?
“nobody’s face is actually symmetrical” as people made her song a trend for symmetrical faces. love her so much
🤢🤢
Omg someone get her a moisturizer ASAP!!
Waaaait shes STUNNING
She's so cute 🥺
WOOO
I already know that when Hyram reacts to this he’ll be shook that there wasn’t moisturizer or sunscreen included 😂
she’s so cute
ahh olivia 🥺🥺
She’s so genuine her energy radiates kindness❤️
I love it how she giggles /laughs she kinda sounds like lily rose Depp
Am I the only one who thinks she’s Kristen Stewart’s twin???
When she's an adult but still says she's a kid 😂
Does anyone else get Catriona Gray vibes?
why was this sponsored, if you aren't going to share the actual routine, no point in doing these videos. yall  didn't even mention any of the non glossier products
One of the simplest make-up routines!
you can see the ring taylor gifted her 😭😭😭😭so cute
my favorite 18 year old
it’s good to take ur rings off while doing ur skin routine, it can tug , tear, and scratch your skin! just a pro tip!
She's sooo cute 🥺❤ Love her, love her music.
Okay but her personality is so bubbly and cute 🥰
So cut
I so obsessed with Olivia
That's my baby
She is so beautiful
Girl yes 😱 I thought I was the only one with super peely lips even though they aren’t chapped.
Does anyone know the song playing in the beginning?
i just got my curtain bangs yesterday because of this girl. the *influence* that she holds.
i honestly can't believe that one of today's biggest stars are in my age.
kiss me
Beautiful makeup, Olivia!
stop she’s literally so pretty i can’t
Through out whole video I was just watching her mouth ..don't know may her voice
Where is the sunscreen???????
ariana grande x catriona gray!
She’s so pretty
i really feel like Morphe 2 would have been way smarter to partner w someone like Olivia. shes so well spoken and natural really is her look. i hope they can collab in the future
I m waiting for Hyram s video
She is so beautiful! She doesn’t need a beauty routine 👸🏻
Idk why but I think she is the girl named grace in the American girl doll movie.
lily rose depp pls
Does anyone know what bronzer she used?
Does anyone know what Ordinary serum she was using?
Please bring Billie eilish next
She should know that putting the serum tube directly on the face can infect the tube with bacteria which will then infect the rest of the serum
pov: you’re watching this video and the next recommended is sabrina carpenter’s video
i love how natural she is!
wait her lips are naturally so pink wtf!!
anyone else feels like this is sponsored by glossier ?????????
Someone who's into this stuff please tell me what a gua sha is/does
she has amazing lips!
3:47 LMFAOOOOO Billie was asked what highlighter do she use and she was like, nothing it’s just my skin😂
please feature indya moore soon 🥺
wow 18 years old ! she looks so beautiful
I feel bad for those who've sacrificed a lot to be a singer yet hasn't got the recognition they deserve, while some people just get taken to every single channel for a viral moment 🙏🏽 No hate to Olivia ❣️
I love how my next recommendation is sabrina's vogue video lmao 😭
She’s 18?!! Wow man! She’s so pretty w/wo makeup 😍
stop i love her
I don’t have any facial / makeup / beauty / skin routine but I still watch that and was it just me or did you guys just love the “heheh”
i love you so
Catrionaaa
Wow, we're sooo similar personality-wise, especially the way she awkwardly laughs while talking - I feel like we would totally get along!
https://youtu.be/bA2JtP3JMFs
ok but which the ordinary serum did she use
I always watch these like... if I looked like that and had that skin I would never bother with makeup and I'd do the most minimal amount of skincare
Her birthmark is so cute.
OLIVIA PLEASE WEAR SUNSCREEN
she’s literally so beautiful
Coowol
Am I the only one that puts their hair up when doing skincare bc I’m terrified of getting it in my hair
shes so genuine
“Eyes are sisters not twins” thanks I really needed to hear that today :)
Just notice her natural red lips.😍😍😍
Olivia: doing a skin care routine    Me: eating cold 🍕
Being a genetically mutilatedcorganism will not be beautiful.  Let me explain...  1.  The mRNA vax is a patented material.  Someone owns that patent.     Think of monsanto corn.  Its gene sequence is owned.   The dna was patented after genetic alterations were made.  If a non Monsanto crop is tainted by monsanto pollen, monsanto lays a royalty claim on the non monsanto crop because it was pollenated with tainted monsanto dna.  They lay claim of ownership because of what they did to in the gene sequence of the corn.  2.  Things of Nature cannot be claimed by patent.   However, things of nature that have been genetically altered are ownable.   Like corn.   Like you.  3.  The change the vax will make in you will make you ownable by the state.   Vaccinated people are GMO. Genetically Mutilated Organisms.  4.  Once you vax, they literally will lay claim of ownership on you in the same way they do corn.  5.  That is if they give you a vax that lets you live.   Either way, once your dna is marked, they think they own you. And if you consent, well you asked for it.  Yeah.  It is that fuc ked up.
she is so stunning 🥺
my new crush❤️
i just found out that SHE IS 18!!!!!
She should be on a cover up magazine
I keep forgetting Olivia could have her own house. Considering she’s 18
I love this she is so relatable and cute 🥺
hyram is freaking out cause she wears no spf 😂😂
Why? She Got only 1 boring song Which is popular and she's in Vogue!
My first video, hope u like it 😊 https://youtu.be/-jpZzj0FXnw
Who Want Olivia to do Daily Vlogs? 😎
Filipina beauty💘
She's just so natural and honest. Gonna support this girl forever!!!
Her sweet and bubbly personality makes me wanna be her BFF!!!!
at this point every video that has 'Olivia Rodrigo' will just get a million views. Yeah the power she holds.
the hihi 🥺💕
Effortlessly beautiful
STUNNING AS ALWAYSS 😌😌😌
🐍🐍🐍
is it just me cause ever since its posted until now i keep repeating this video and i already watch thi 5times im obsessed lol
Ariana please
I CANT DESCRIBE HOW MUCH I HATE HERRR
lol when she said she pretends to be doing a makeup Tutorial by herself in her mirror I do that exact same thing lmao
She looks exactly like Claudia Sulewski
I used to get dermatitis really bad as well I’m glad I’m not alone cause I used to see celebrities with perfect skin and no dermatitis and it made me feel like I’m the only one
eyeliners r sisters not twins, it doesn’t have to be perfect, nobody’ face is actually symmetrical HAHAAHHAA
can’t believe she’s the same age as me wtf 😭
so simple.. sooo prettyy.. ☺ ♥
“I am 18” oh girl, we know
She's 18?!!
She has a very cute personality.. she seems like a happy person. And she is beautiful.
The way she said *like Billie Eilish's makeup, she always just looks like she's glowing and perfect* melt my heart🥰
She is SO cute!
She is so so gorgeous<3 I've ever seen
Who else just looked at her bathroom the whole time.😆
She’s so naturally pretty and seems so down to earth 🙌🏽✨
No moisturizer or sunscreen? Hyram is about to SCREAM 😂
She's so pretty
love her
i love her
ah, it's so good to hear that I'm not the only one breaking out around the chin / nose area. Wearing masks definitely made me break out more... and btw. I do the same with serums, I just put the drops on my face directly 😍
Glossier does a really lovely sunscreen that sits under make up and smells good. Shame they didn’t make sure it was included in this, or vogue given the recent shitstorm over goopy
Hyram’s going to lose his mind at the dropper on the skin 🥺
i can watch her talk all day 🥺
She’s so pretty 🤩
Idk if this is weird but my cat was playing and I played this video he came to me sat next to me and fell asleep!!!!! This is so cute
i could never use the gua sha thingy because it would hurt because of my acne 😭
Can someone tell me which The Ordinary product she use?
Is she sponsored by Glossier by any chance? 🤣
01:27 Thats hee hee was adorable🥺🥺🥺💖
When I was 18, my skin was my enemy :')
she is so likeable
Her laugh is so cute. ✨
Perfect 💕✨ Wonderful🤩
i see catriona in her❤
what was the other things she used besides glossier? lol.
She doesn't even look like she's putting makeup she's so gorgeous✨
Filipina's effortless beauty. We're just normally beautiful. All people are just normally beautiful, y'all!!💕
Yasss girl drop that skin care routine
I love Olivia 😭😭
Literally absoulety gorgues and she speaks so naturally
Ok, but where’s the moisturizer and spf?
If she’s not sponsored by Glossier she TOTALLY should be!!! Anyone else ready for an Olivia Rodrigo Collection?!?
Loved her super simple basic makeup look 😍
Wala jud siyay buot ay
She's wearing the Red ring given to her by Taylor Swift.
now this is the content i wanna see
She’s that girl of the school who compliments you randomly to make your day ❤️
"I love alone time".  same Olivia
Beauty begins the moment you decided to be yourself. Falling in love with yourself first doesn't make you vain or selfish. It makes you indestructible.  #thanksgoogle
She's naturally beautiful huhu
Catriona Gray? Is that you? Just kidding 😅
GAL GADOT NEXT PLZ????
Kinda have similarities with Catriona Gray ❤
Can we please have a Priyanka Chopra everyday makeup routine pleaseeee
1:53 I thought its a hair clip im so sorry😭😭
when using the gua shaw (sorry if i misspelled) she needs to put a oil otherwise she’s pulling her skin making it more dry and it’s even worse since she has dermatitis
Why did i think the gua sha was a hair clip
And ik we werent perfect but ive never felt this is way for no one
Sooo pretty
The new “ High school musical the musical” S. 2 is soon here yayyyy
She’s such an ESFJ 😭 no way she’s an introvert
why  do i see catriona???????
People watching this like: - in bed - not in a full screen - reading comments
I wish I am as pretty as you, Olivia and you have the prettiest hair too. Gosh, I'm so insecure about myself 😩
How can a human be so perfekt?! 😍 I just started my own channel, i would be really honored if you would like to check it out! ❤️❤️

_SuNScreen!!!!!!!!!!!??????_ _huh_
there's so many young, new and rising artists but for some reason I really like her! one of the few i've been following. she seems very grounded and genuine
She's looks like the mother of Tris in Divergent....ok u can sleep.
watching olivia rodrigo IS self care& skincare
all those girls are so beautiful ....
Ayy the intro is jontha links!
This woman needs ZERO makeup. Absolutely gorgeous without.  I say skip the makeup.
Devon Lee Carlson beauty routine plsssssss 🥺🥺🥺
This is my favorite one!❤️I love her vibe!!!!
Eyes really are just sisters many people have uneven eyes one is big other is small
the fact that she mentioned bil makes me love her even more literally my whole channel is based on billie
Funny how she says she’s an introvert here but in a previous interview she said the pandemic made her realize she is not an introvert
https://youtu.be/kd399au4_T0
that lip scrub is good, immediately reddens her lips 🥺👌✨♥️
She look like catriona and julia at the same time
As someone with actual curly hair, it made me laugh when she said her hair (which barely has a wave to it) was a bit curly. 🤭
AAAAAAAH MORE OLIVIA RODRIGO CONTENT PLS
side view she kinda looks like julia baretto
Beautiful
She gives me Déjà vu
she's only 18? whut?

Her natural lip color is amazing... <3 and she's so pretty with natural makeup.
Catriona Gray and Olivia could literally pass as sisters
pls wear sunscreen
Cool check out mine
don’t put the applicator to your face!! you’re putting bacteria on your when when you do that & make sure there is slip when u use that stone thing because if you stretch your skin you’re pre maturing it! + add a spf moisturizer! protect your skin
Prettiest girl ever seen

Am I the only person that thinks Olivia looks like Miss Universe Catriona Grey ???
she is so beautiful
the music in the background of the video makes it so hard for my brain to comprehend what she’s saying
YOHANAN(JOHN/JUAN) 14:6 "I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME" "YO SOY EL CAMINO Y LA VERDAD Y LA VIDA. NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR MI".......

I swear Vogue let’s ANYONE on here now a days :/

Her hair is so beautiful
She is so cute !!

Skincare by hyram fans here✌🏽 when she put the serum on her face and not on her hands😲 WHERES THE MOISTURIZER  THE SUNSCREEN IS IN THE BB CREAM

Love how she knows how to accentuate her natural beauty instead of pilling 2 pounds of makeup on.
Girl where is your moisturizer and sunscreen?😭
Her lips are such a nice color naturally
holdddd up is the ultra lip new?!!
Who is she??
Oh to be young and ignorant about skin care. Didn't even mention sunscreen or moisturizer.

"eyeliner are sisters not twins" AHHH thank you olivia
I love her voice ☺️
We need one of Nikki Reed!

sup bizaardvark
ela fazendo sotaque britanico q nem na serieeee
why do i feel like we are bffs on a facetime call getting ready 🥺
This looks like a Glossier sponsorship ad
https://youtu.be/GOnqeKJeZWs
hyram...
im so glad shes slowly rising and gaining more attention and fame. she really deserves it
Bro she can get IT any time idc idc💯
I hope she wouldnt do any surgery on her face, I havent seen natural faces for a long time
Effortlessly beautiful
She is awesome and seems supper smart and sweet
Is she using a new glossier product on her lips?? Glossier doesn’t have a hydrating lip product in the shade apricot.... if so I’m excited 😊
I love her ao much 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Which mascara was that?
Adorable ❤️
alanis morissette junior
She's so precious 🥰
I appreciate that she reassures herself about her insecurities in a v. calm way & acts her age 🙂 It's not unusual for teenagers to present an image that's mature/cool/sophisticated to match up to trends that are culturally appealing or idealized in society, especially in the world of entertainment & showbiz where they are scrutinized publicly. Actually, people of all ages place themselves under immense pressure & can be very harsh & unforgiving towards their own faults. It's nice to watch someone who within 1 minute of this video calmly acknowledges that "I am a teenager so I can't expect to have perfect skin all the time. But it's pretty good all things considered although I have my moments with acne." She'll let her makeup artist know _not_ to cover her smudge-like birthmark because she likes it. She reassures herself that her eyeliner should be like sisters, not twins. To bear with her if she has to do it all over again. All in a very relaxing, non-frustrated way. A good habit to develop, and a trend I've seen gaining momentum which is nice 🥲
She is such a beautiful person
She just seems like a beautiful person inside and out ❤️❤️
Olivia look's like Catriona Gray, hmmmn
She’s literally don’t have to wear any makeup...🍂she’s 100% a natural beauty😍
Perfect facelift, don’t even know who the last person is impersonating you. She seems more beautiful
"less is more" SO TRUE BESTIE OMG HMM
Nsñs km
The reason why I like her a lot is because she is very young and she is very honest like everyone has pretended they've done  one of these on their own and we talk about our favorite artists and she is like that.
I love her!!!
Now this is someone who actually deserves to be on VOUGUE 👏
so when are they gonna tell her that sabrina did vogue too?
this girl get famous for write a music for being cheated for a blonde girl? pls vogue i dont want see a superficial girl
Margot Robbie should do a beauty secret routine 😩
Of course Sabrinas Is under this vid Loll
i think she likes glossier
oh she's delightful
I don't like her tbh. Her song created hate for Sabrina. Great singer though.
We need mbb
Hyram is gonna be PISSED
cutie❤
i love her so much
This is my first video watching her and I can say, she is so down to earth!!
wonder how long it takes for her unibrow to grow fully
Wait ✋ she's 18????!!!!! I'm also 18 why do i look like a young trash?
Her face reminds me of Eiza González
WHERE'S THE SUNSCREEN p.s. I love you olivia
So much product in one place
The ring😍 love that she never takes it off
We have such a similar skin care routine 😩😩😩
so excited to hear about ultralip!
i am obsessed with her
such a sweet girl, loved this!!
I'm waiting for Hyram's reaction
My wife
she could shoot me and i’d apologize
I feel like she was on the disney show called Bizzarbark.
Her and Maddie ziegler should be friends they have extremely similar personalities
it's insane how this girl was insecure of sabrina when she look soooo freaking gorgeous. she has that type of beauty that won't make you feel intimidated it's hard to explain.
I’m quite literally obsessed with her
Would love to see more people who have gone through at least three life crisis’.  18?  Your skin care routine is waking up and being poreless/wide eyed/full of hope.  Give me some divircée beauty, some barely making-ends meet makeup, some best just-lost-a-parent routines... Ready for the Real!
73 questions with Olivia Rodrigo pleeease🥺🥺
wait...shes 18 whatttt
why all celebrities have the same bathroom
Totally basic ordinary not so over dramatic with numerous product which is over ur head. Just like my daily routine ❤️👌
Who??
You look beautiful as always
I SAY THATS MY BABY AND IM PROUD
jeez she´s so likeable
Don't make Olivia a role model pleasee <3 she is so young , we as fans should just let her be #BeOlivia
#
OH GOD SHE IS SO PRETTY!
Okay who else thought Olivia was a lot older than 18!?
Cutie 😍❤️❤️
her lips are so naturally red
Mid, one song and all the fake depressed 13 year old TikTokers go crazy
"Making decisions for yourself and by yourself" yes.
She's so cute
Beautiful
Omggg does anybody not know how much grown up she’s gotten
what is the bronzer,blush,and highlight she uses?
I’ve never listened to her songs but i wanna be her bff
she is so stunning.
i just realised she was in the 'my american girl doll- grace' movie
Such a natural beauty
I love that every step is her favorite. We stan a positive young queen
Am I the only one who thinks Olivia was one of those girls in school who wasn’t popular and was very introverted and just complemented people just to make their day
She seems so lovely and down to earth omg 🥺
I wanna be friends with her
Till now, she's the most relatable vogue makeup video
DO YOU GET DEJA VUUUU WHEN SHES WITH YOU
She's so down-to-earth tho :3
she's incredibly sweet and pretty, a true pisces🌸✨
Her fave very similar with the miss universe frim filipino
she is so perfect, omg. 😭😍🛐
she had such a mature personality omg
For some reason i feel like she looks like miss universe catriona gray? I dont know i just saw it?
Olivia: "Eyeliner are sisters not twins" Me: My Eyeliner not being even remotely related -_-
She's cute ❤️

https://youtu.be/Qh6ghjXpkCM
every Hyram fan will be like:  WAIT,  WhEre´S tHe SunScReeN?!
love her!!!
So absolutely fun and cool to watch. And i need to try that concealer! Love that you said you were an introvert thats when i thumbs up the vid.
For anyone who was wondering (like I was) the Glossier Ultra Lip that she used hasn't been released yet
really olivia???
She looks like the love child of Catriona Gray and Olivia Munn
She looks like Catriona Gray, they look like they could be sisters. Pinay Beauties 🇵🇭
how can she felt me like she's my best friend even if she doesn't know me
When Liv said "the biggest thing with liquid eyeliner for me.." it reminded me of when Taylor Swift always answered interview questions with "I think for me..." im crying..
shes so pretty
When you're 18, everything is efortless...
How do these celebs do their skincare with their hair down? Wtfk?
her "before" is better than my "after" 😭 girl has skin clearer than a summer sky
4:46
Oh god she's so gorgeous
She seems so sweet and down to earth!
I love how the FIRST recommended video in the tab for this video is Sabrina Carpenter’s beauty routine video for Vogue 🤣😂
Why does she remind me of a hyper version of Kristen Stewart
Her lips are so naturally red
where is the moisturiser and sunscreen ??????? :((((((((
I’ve been waiting for this!
finally someone who deserves her take on this
She sounds like she would be such a great person to be friends with! 🥰
She doesn’t even NEED to wear makeup bc she looks beautiful without it 💖
She is so beautiful
so y'all really want her as taylor swift's replacement?
.
ok the subtle mention of a new glossier lip product i see......
she really looks like claudia sulewski here
Is she half filipino.? Her attitude is so pinoy...
Can someone tell me, where do you get the hair pins?
perfect, omg
3:14 wait so she wasn't already wearing makeup????
Queen is finally on vogue
She's sooo pretty😍❤
when she said dry shampoo is very important to me I thought she said Joshua is very important lol bc she said it so fast
Hyram NEEDS to react to this
Face look like Taylor Swift Asian version. No 🧢
olivia: nobody's face is symmetrical deja vu on tiktok: *cough cough* (if u know what i mean lmao)
This night be weird but she has the prettiest hands,... ya know?
Olivia Rodrigo’s beauty routine:  1. Wake up and be Olivia Rodrigo ✔️ 2. Done ✔️
How hard is it to not get taylor swift to do this ugh PLEASE VOGUE
i need pt2 ajajaja
I love you 🥲😘
New glossier lip product 👀👀
It feels like they  all use the same bathroom
OMG OLIVVAAA HAS GRACED THE EARTH THANK YOU GOD
who is she?!
You are still a child, don't worry..!
Finally the queen is here😘😘
i hate this
i wanna be friends with her so bad
Love this makeup !! ❤️❤️
غول
typical
Love her ❤️❤️ so sweet
She looks like sydney serena.. yeah she does
1. Please do not apply the serum directly to your skin using the applicator. You will ruin the rest of the serum inside of the bottle. 2. Moisturiser is very important. 3. Sunscreen is very important 4. Skincare is simple, like she said, less is better. Hence the og steps, cleansing-moisturising-sunscreen.
finally.
I hope you’re reading these comments because girl you need to use moisturiser and spf! Protect your youthful face!!
https://youtu.be/DHfuJd-yEr8
OLIVIA is so pretty✨💗
The official Little Mix video with Saweetie titled "Confetti" is available, make sure you watch it because the girl is acting as a man. Their beauty, visuals, choreography, style are badass  https://youtu.be/15-vLIZ_2mU
she lowkey seems like the female version of timothee chalamet
hyram should react!!!
i dont understand the way they used their hands while wearing those rings. i know its clean but yeah
my little flex: I have a birthmark on my checkbone  too.
I actually love this woman
Great
her Filipina genes are poppin off
THE BLOODY SPF where is it. Hyram please tell her
I love u twenty one pilots
"She's always so glowy and perfect "  Stan billie stans
With the way she looks you would think she doesn't even wear make up
Hyram: where's the sunscreen??????????????????????????
gosh she’s perfect
Yeah if I had clear skin
Love that she doesn’t pile on the makeup! Perfect amount to enhance her already perfect beautiful features and face. She’s lovely.
Maybe i'm only the one who noticing it but i she resembles Catriona Gray... They are both beautifulll
The fact that people can just rub makeup in with their hands and be done..... my cystic/hormonal red skin says ✨no✨ I need a dampened beauty blender with super warm water to make my makeup not look cakey🥲🥲😛😛😔
★☆★
She is so sweet and sounds like Kristen Stewart
Nobody: Olivia: eyeliners are sisters, not twins. It doesn't have to be perfect, nobody's face is actually symmetrical.
She don't need a lipstick
The fact that she's 18 years old and says "when i was younger" makes ME feel like a grandma completely!
What products is she using?
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡😕😕😖
g m ad m slld s ll d mmmmsl
🧟‍♀️🧟‍♀️🧟‍♀️🧟‍♀️🧟‍♀️🧟‍♀️🧟‍♀️🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾

A pretty and normal girl you can related to finally 😍😍
She is like the female version of Timothee Chalamet
she's so gorgeous even without makeup omg
I don't get it when she says "masks definitely don't help with acne", I thought they are actually helpful
she’s selling glossier so good, thinking rn to actually get me some products
OH MY GOD SCREAMING
She looks so gooood
Doca
What's she eating at the start? Are those gummy bears?
So beautiful! Yes, that Glossier beauty bag is my fav. ❤
I WANT TAYLOR SWIFT'S ROUTINE NEXT😭❤️ Love this video ❤️❤️
She's so chipper it's adorable ❤️
She looks alike Catriona Gray, Miss Universe 2018 A LOT!!!
She is the cutest i love her so Much
She's so nice but where's her sunscreen??
when she said that she used to do over the top makeup when she was 14 and her mom never let her out...that was literally me too ...she is so relatable
she booked and busy lately.
her natural lip colour is what im most jealous of. 🥲 mine is dark and pale at the same time. Its colourless.
She is so normal and I love her for that. The best thing is she doesn't even try to be normal. She is just normal and that is really refreshing to see everyday.
Me playing Hyram's comments in my head....❤️
https://youtu.be/zR_uK1R943U
why does i feel like every celebrity have the same bathroom😭
Uhh is it just me but she looks like if Ariana grande and Addison Rae had a baby like is that just me??
wow i love it)
When I was younger ... 😂
I want a Billie Ellish Skin care and Beauty routine. Vogue, you hear me, right?
PLEASE DO A VOGUE X BILLIE EILLISH
Glossier sales after this video 📈📈📈
I like women that take care of themselves, its attractive and everyone has their own unique style which is cool.     as a man I appreciate Vogue for keeping the ladies fly
Nooo she has those kinds of eyes where you can die early if you have it!
Finally a talented person not some talentless tiktoker...
heather
It’s so fun  to touch the dropper on your skin when it can catch bacteria ? What a idiot lol
She is very much a "sunshine person". Super soft, sweet, happy, and very down to Earth.
just waiting for hyram to react to this
https://youtu.be/xXCHb364YUQ
She looks so much like Catriona Gray 🥰😍
How is someone literally this gorgeous just naturally
Olivia reminds me of my aunt jsjsjs
Is 18 year old still considered as teenager? Please someone tell me.
i love olivia and selena so much
She's so beautiful with or without makeup. Even at the start of the vid I am stunned by her beauty
This is a man
who tf cares was this 12 y/o puts on her face, her skin looks like that because she is 12 not because of her 'skin care'....
POV: you’re scrolling through the comments while watching this
She really looks like Catriona Gray 🥵🤍
You've already had Madison Beer here, now it's time for Cindy Kimberly's Routine, Please Vogue!

The way she tells them not to cover her birthmark makes me happy. I dunno why people think spots on the skin are a bad thing, I'm glad she doesn't ✨
I love her🥺❤️

i feel like she'd make such a great friend with her personality
She is so wholesome-ly talking to us like we're her friends
Why is she so perfect 💖💖💖 my fav
Girll use sunscreen please 🥺❤️❤️
she's the only person that doesn't make me nervous when they curl their lashes i feel like most people are so aggressive
Is it just me or anyone else doesnt like doing skin care and makeup with hair on face . I so badly want to tie up and put those hair behind her ears 😆
watching olivia do her makeup feels like i'm watching a friend or the girl next door do it, she doesn't feel like a celeb and i think that's her charm
God I love her
There's no way she's 18, no f wayyyy
i see her everywhere and i'm not complaining! just so proud 🥺💜
сулушка 😘🇰🇬
PSA to those that r saying she missed the sunscreen and moisturizer, she used First Aid Ultra Repair Tinted Moisturizer SPF 30. Since it’s obviously a glossier ad, the other products were not highlighted ☺️
I lovee when she said i pretend doing one of these at the end
WE NEED JENNİFER ANISTON, COURTNEY COX AND MEGAN FOX

I love how she said she has really "oily hair", and thats whys she proceeds to add dry shampoo to it. Then, not even a second later adds oil to her hair.
even when she hasn't done her makeup, she still looks so beautiful.
Catriona Gray
Luv her
waiting for hyram to react to this like...
she’s literally everywhere oh my god so annoying
Absolutely stunning! 😩✨
I don’t know if I’m the only one who think she looks like Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray!?
She so cute inside and out she don’t even make up, that’s a true woman
trust me her jawline is not even
Step 1: Have good genetics Step 2: Be young Step 3: Don’t be old
I aspire to be as beautiful, talented, and well-spoken as her omg
she laughs like timothee chalamet omg
Baby swift!! God she's so nice and well spoken

Olivia at 18: Successful and an amazing singer releasing hit songs Me: MoM I'M HuNgRy WhErE'S mY SnAcKs  I honestly can't believe I'm the same age as her lol
she speaks so eloquently i love her
I love her... she is my idol.. the person who I look up to the most especially when it comes to music. And just reflecting on her life and how I my life to be they are so different however we have many things in common. And even through her hard times she is so bright and just the light I need to crawl my way out of the darkness.
Another cool bathroom😩
OMGGGG I BEEN WAITING
I love her
The fact that I didn’t start doing a skincare routine till like 30
What age you stop being a teenager? I'm confused, I always thought it was 18, even docters say people stop growing at that age
https://youtu.be/5V3YdWxe-rE
Es demasiado linda en todo sentido la escucharía hablar horas
her lip color is so pretty, i'd buy a lipstick in that shade
I really want to see a video for billie Eilish here
i love her!! i was definitely disappointed that because of the vogue’s glossier partnership we didn’t get to really see what she actually uses (which is supposed to be the point of these videos), but she did a great job at making it seem like she was just a big glossier fan. but check oliviarodrigocloset on ig for the other stuff that vogue didn’t link 😒; she’s super good at finding everything.
I Love her, she’s so beautiful and such an amazing person ❤️❤️❤️
Hey i watched on girl meets world as a kid
idk 'bout u guys but she looks like Catriona Gray

At eighteen I was lucky if I could get my hands on some Suave shampoo/conditioner and a little deodorant... what a talent she is and so lovely.
I also drip serums down my face it like satisfys my soul and it just works so much better
she is such a lil ANGEL!!! she must be protected at all costs
I love you Olivia 🇳🇵❤️

Olivia: Blush: why am I turning my face red,  I'm trynna take redness of my face.  Me: I'm getting Deja Vu
this felt more like a glossier sponsorship lol
im learning  makeup but im not that good
aw olivia is so naturally pretty and she seems like she has a lovely personality :) <3
She seems like the sweetest, genuine person! I loved watching this!
We should hangout in my car
Did anyone else think that she advertised Glossier or is it just me?🤷‍♀️
Tf she's pretty !!!!!!!
ahhhhh i love her
Yesss finally
When Hyram reacts to this he's gonna be like "WHERE'S THE SUNSCREEN?"
She knows she doesn’t really need a lot of makeup to put on because she’s naturally beautiful 🤩
I’ve been waiting for this one
She is literally glowing.
She's so adorable 💖✨
she sounds like a youtuber who makes tutorials/vlogs
queen didn't use moisturizer?
She really looks like Catriona Gray 💗
guys i love HER but in case there´s any impressionable teen around here: if you want to buy any product that has a dropper DON´T PUT IT DIRECTLY ON YOUR SKIN, it´ll contaminate the product and create more bacteria!
Olivia, you're really telling us you're not wearing lipstick? my god. the most beautiful lips Ive ever seen
these past few days we are getting Olivia Rodrigo content and I'm not complaining <3 give us more
Yessss
yayyyyy finallyyy
Love those gummies too
What is the brand of the mascara? I couldn't see it 🥺🥺
She reminds me so much of ashley graham
makes a whole lot more sense than a "singer" or a "dancer'
She seems like someone I’d want to be friends with🥰🦋🦄
i just love her
she has the beauty she's pretty and flawless... she's STUNNING.....
🏜️ why she did not tie her hairrrrr
So  fresh ,so simple n so real n natural unlike the other 18yr girls with tooo much make up
Can't believe there isn't a comment mentioning hyram to react to this
What Ordinary serum is she using ?
young people nowadays are so well spoken, when i was 18 i was like... ...like.. :(
guys I think he likes glossier?? not 100% sure!!
honestly She looks so amazing without  Makeup!
Wtf 😳 vogue where is little mix????!
She's cute.
I'm obsessed with way she speaks!
No way this is awesome!!!
please do taylor swift's routine next that would be incredible
I actually love that no one is saying anything negative about her unibrow! I hope this is the start of acceptance of women with perfectly normal hair on their face. We need to stop pretending that it doesn’t exist.
Love her confidence
She’s so naturally beautiful too🤍
Did she not even use a moisturizer after the serum and her skin looks like that?! Effortless beauty right there
Vogue needs to get the mian twins on here
Love her but when she used the gua sha on dry skin I died a lil

whole video sponsored by glossier
OMG I GASPED WHEN I SAW THIS
Olivia who? I only know Paige...
I think she is my twin, everything she has said and done is exactly what i do. Olivia if you see this comment please contact me! :) You're absolutely amazing!

She is beyond boringn
I love her so much I get deja vu ✨😭

PROUD PINAY♥️ sa lahat ng PINOY PRESENT?????🤣
Yesss!! Love her
now we all know that she's a fan of billie .... i loved her more tbh
Shes so blessed with perfect skin and natural beauty i could never
Shout out to her publicist!
i love her
A bit sneaky to not disclose this is sponsored by Glossier
Is there gonna be a new Glossier lip product!? Omg... Cuz she didn't say generation g lipstick... And the one she used looked pink packaged!!!!!!
Olivia.. heeeyy..
I’ve been a fan since buzzardvark
I feel like every time she said "when I was younger" i got a year older
She is so cute,
Who is paying to lift this girl's career? She´s everywhere! She's very beautiful tho.
THE OLLY GUMMIES ARE SO GOOD OMFG
She didn’t set her concealer Me: how? 👁👄👁
Love how they only mention Glossier products. Like the stila highlighter is “highlighter” but the concealer was “stretch concealer”.
Omg someone please tell her to use a facial oil with the gua sha 😭😭 it’s supposed to glide over the skin
“Eyeliners are sisters not twins” I loved that.
She is such a sweetheart!
i was waiting for this one
She. Is. Stunning.
don’t let hyram watch this video
Masks are for sure one of the reasons why I break out😭
I've been waiting soo long for Olivia to get a  Vogue video!
Please no
I like how she speaks so rapidly... It just strikes me as really genuine
She seems so sweet 💖 Milly Bobby Brown vibes, I love it.
I though  was  Eiza Gonzales
I'm curious. Is she american or is there mix of some other nationality in her blood?   Like Latin America or Asian. She is beautiful.
She’s so pretty and bubbly ❤️❤️
Please ask Taylor Swift :)
Wait what did she use for blush and stuffs? She used more than just Glossier products... lol
Glossier Ultra Lip?????
She does her serum just like I do
when i watched her music video i kept thinking to myself how she's so perfect, but seeing her up close and personal like this definitely humanized her image for me. (-:
Love her
she said her hair is curly lmao where
she’s so famous now wth 😭😭
So fresh, fun and beautiful!
I totally agree with what she said that in skincare less is more
Hyram would be proud
Yay Olivia
She's so pretty 😊❤️
She seems so sweet and genuine🥺
Guys, what is a BB cream?Cause I usually see girls/people put on foundation in the step that she applied the bb cream
This isn’t even trying to hide the fact that it’s an ad for Glossier
https://youtu.be/HHJhKXPYR7Y
Where is the sunscreen?
“less is more” so many celebs should listen this.
she's so natural but beautiful i love her so much
She kinda looks like Catriona Gray's little sister 😁
😍
I was hoping for a good personality...but she's like every other girl nowadays
TAYLOR SWIFT NEXT
WE NEED TAYLOR SWIFT
I'm surprised she didn't mention tswift once
i can't believe how pretty someone can be
Where is hyram at
sis already effortlessly beautiful without even trying
OMG!OMG!OMG
Wait thats a new glossier lipstick. I'm intrigued.
She looks so alike Eiza González
i can literally listen to her for hours, love her
aaaww she's so sweet!!!! but please wear sunscreen :)
Me to my younger self: sunscreen is missing but, you so fine babygirl.
You think Glossier made her bathroom too?
MARGOT ROBBIE next
But she's a kid
i NNNNEEEEEDDDDD Hyram to review this lol
Yay!!
This was obviously sponsored by glossier😆
WTFFF OMG SO UNEXPECTED
anyone know what the clips are called?
Shes the best
Love hee
honestly? she has more knowledge about skin care and not using makeup brushes\beauty bleander that's not been cleaned in weeks than most LA beauty gurus LOLLL also-totally SAME on the vitamins!
swear! She haves the simplest yet very realistic skin care and make up routine.
She's so naturally gorgeous I just love her sm 😍😍
she just makes me so happy
prettiest girl so proud of liv <3
WEIIII PORFAA PONGAN SUBAN EL VIDEO DE OLIVIA RODRIGO SUBTITULADO PORFAA AAA 🛐😩✋

AGH IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE TURN IT UP
I hate Vogue so much for putting tiktokers in here but for Olivia I’ll stay
I love her
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ONE ☝️
“nobody’s face is actually symmetrical”  all I thought of was “dO YOU GET DÉJÀ VUUUUUUUUUU” on tiktok
She is so perfect!! Ily 4 ever 💘💘💘
5:19 she so cute hahahaa
Why does this remind me of "Save Ralph" :|
does anyone know what bb cream that Is, I can't make it out
You know you made it when Vogue ask you to do one of these.........☺️
Loved this glossier commercial
Very fitting how she said “it’s ok, no one’s symmetrical” while the inverted trend is happening with her song déjà vu haha
Who remember Paige and Frankie
I love that her brand is basically less is more. Driver's License, Her make-up, skincare routine and her personality is just universally liked.   Basically simply expressive :)
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSS
Can anyone list the non glossier products? I wish I knew what hair oil and blush she used :/
She's so humble love her

Not YouTube recommending Sabrina’s video to watch next 💀🤡
I love her so much and she is so genuine. But when she said she was 18 a part of me died inside because I’m 20.
She's so mature and well beyond her years
I feel so sleepy. This video is so satisfying.

AAAGHHHH PRETTY !!!
gurl what are u doing-
wait...i literally have the same exact routine, same makeup, lip balm, face serum.... that’s insane lol
Me loving her but at the same time...  Ahhhh the dropper is touching her face no hygienic. Also that Gua sha tool is fine to use however she is tugging her skin, there should be an oil or something lubricating her skin while doing so.  & where is the sunscreen :(   She is so sweet!
She's so pretty!! i can't wait for the album
She has the most gorgeous natural lip colour ever!!!
She is pure natural beauty
this is what we want VOGUE REAL CELEBS not dIxE d'AmLiEo and aDdIsOn rAe 💀✋

She didn't show the bronzer or the blush. It's clear that Glossier paid Olivia -_-
She's so soft i love her
Okay, but her natural lip colour is so stunning 😍
She should try making more videos like this. She has the best personality ever i would love to see more of her life like vlogs and grwm videos
So gorgeous
Wow she is so gorgeous !!  The only thing missing is sunscreen  You can not miss out on that 🥺
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT HER💗💕

i wish this was out a year ago when i was on the hunt for how she did her makeup! lol glad it’s here now!
Yes Vogue these are the kinda people we wanna see on your channel, not those annoying tik tokers.
Crazy to think about that we are the same age. Here I am looking up to a girl who is a few months older then me. Life is so crazy honestly
since when did glossier have an ultra lip in their product line?
This is the second Billie Eillish Easter eggs she's given us
She's so wholesome :)
At 18 all I did was face packs and basic eye makeup and sunscreen and moisturiser and face wash
She is so pretty and gorgeous :). I'm glad she's getting the recognition she deserves
She's very right about the less is more with skincare. My dermatologist said the same. Just washing my face no serums no oils no scrubs
the most beautiful human ever
she is effortlessly beautiful 🤩 love her natural make up and she is REAL!!
she’s so down to earth, it’s like she’s just having a chat with her best friends 🥺

Brought to you by Glossier.
they need to do Taylor swift vogue now or Ariana grande vogue
She’s the most relatable celebrity I’ve ever seen!
I love her
Okay but this is my routine when I can afford anything lol
@Vogue @Bobbi Brown's Maui illuminating bronzing powder is the ultimate naturally sunkissed blush + highlight ...  waiting for these celebs to discover it!
Get Josephine Langford on here 😫
I’ve always wanted vogue to get miss rodrigo on here doing her makeup so they must’ve read my mind!!
I just love how she looks like her age really simple and beautiful
Am I crazy or is that Glossier Ultra Lip a new product?? I’ve never seen anything about it but it looks great!
She is half Filipino btw
Ariana Grande next please ❤️
oh MY GOD
When watching peaceful skin care videos: Someone: Oh cool, I should try that out. Me: "No, WHY DID YOU DO THAT!!", the aftermath of watching Hyram.
I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE! TURN IT UP
She kinda looks like Eiza Gonzalez Very pretty 💕
Everytime I see her , all I can think is Bizaardvark
She is like so cmfortable talking to the camera i love that
LITERALLY SO CUTE
Her: Glossy-A Me: Gloss-ear My sister: Glossy-ear
I LOVE SEEING HER IN MY FAV CHANNELS
Her song Drivers license is actually awesome, but she is a mean/bad person tbh.
Love Olivia Rodrigo! She's my idol!💜💜
YESEESSSSWSWS
* sponsored by glossier* lol jk
Where do i get that lip? I can’t find it at all
never thought this day would come!! I love her
Hyram needs to react to this
I remember first seeing her on bizzardvark and I’m so proud of her for getting this far she deserves all this and also she’s so ✨stunning✨ even without makeup AHHH JSHSHS😭😭
shes the definition of natural beauty
she looks like eiza gonzalez
What even is dry shampoo
Woah only 18? I am 22 and thought i look 18. 😂

John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”
kween
Just olivia talking about how oily her hair is , then putting a hand full of hair oil on her hair
AAA I LOVE HERRRRRRR
I love Olivia 😍
U GET DEJA VUUUUUUUUUU
ooh ugg
her hair is so gorgeous
ugh such a b so dumb complaining about boys in every single song then when a good song comes out like obsessed everyone's saying it's dumb it's literally a song about self love this b just be complaining ugh this is what humanity is
She reminds me so much of Kate Beckinsale, like she has her whole face. She's a stunner.
She is too relatable.
🌷🌷🌷vogue calls Millie Bobby Brown to show her the skin routine and how she puts on makeup. please🌷🌷🌷
olivia seems so down to earth and such a nice person!
zendaya next time please!!!!
beautiful olivia <3 love your music
She’s incredibly beautiful ❤️
I love her too much
She is the MOMENT
an effortless queen
@Vogue
she is so sweet!! i love her positivity and the way she mentions make up is meant to enhance our features and raise our confidence for ourselves. xx
Which ordinary serum did she use?
I LOVE how she isn’t using all these boujee products and they are just so simple and plain just like my skincare
she owns my hearttt khghjfgl
When I tell you I clicked fast... I MEAN IT! love her so much
why is no one talking about the little 'hee hee' in the beginning 😛 and the "unintentionally" eating her lip scrub she literally just feels like she's my best friend
Hyram would not approve no sunscreen in this routine though.
she’s annoying
Her lip color is naturally so beautiful!
I love this girl so much bro 😭
I LOVE HER SM MY BB
FINALLY SOMEONE THAT ACTUALLY DESERVES TO BE IN VOGUE !!! TALENTED PEOPLE
next all i need is Billie Eilish's and Taylor Swifts's routines  These videos are so calming to watch when the people in it aren't problematic, stuck-up celebrities
OMGG YESSSS
The fact that she's 18 years old and says "when i was younger" makes ME feel like a grandma
I need sofia Carson's routine
her talking about Billie when putting on her foundation suddenly made me realise how cool having Billie do one of these would be, I'M WAITING 😌👍
Do with Deepika Padukone please @vogue
Hyram is gonna have a panic attack at this honestly
omg yasss 🥰🥰
Thank you for using an inexperienced teenager to finally out the fact these videos have always been just adverts.
she reminds me speaking touch of mili bobby brown vogue u should do video with her
Why do I think its sponsored by glossier😐😂
Amazing video. 💓 I wanna see Lily rose depp here.
yessss
she's so cute omg
MY BAAABBBYYYYY
She’s 17 I do not need to see young girls that have barely lived giving us advice about skin etc Thanks
I love how she’s so real, like I feel like she’s facetiming us and not acting fake and “perfect” like a lot of celebs
I love her makeup and skincare mantra. I agree that less is more!
i wish these wouldnt be called guides bc many things these people do in the videos are things you should not take as advice and do yourself. bc they arent professionals, and they can also use things wrong etc. people should realize it but especially people like her who have a young audience, the fans might not realize that things should be taken with a grain of salt and not follow these celebs routines bc they also dont know what they are doing sometimes..
please dont do guasha like she did. you can see her skin isnt slippery enough so the tool isnt sliding smoothly on the skin. the serum alone especially with such a small amount isnt enoguh to give a good base for guasha
Olivia is so pretty ,and soft how can someone be so prefect 😭😱❤.
The 1st time I saw her was in the American girl movie
Hol up..she’s 18??!
she’s so pretty and well spoken! love her personality 🥺 can’t wait for the album
We GET THIS AND BILLIES NEW SONG. Best days ever!
Absolute stunner 🌈🦋✨🧸
Her teeths are more white than the white part of her eyes and mine are more yellow than my skin
im sorry but umm no moisturizer and no spf?!!
Love this Olivia!!
She is so pretty. Omg. Omg. She also looks older than me even though she's younger. I'm a literal baby.
“I was wearing masks and sunglasses and the person still recognised me.. maybe it was my hair” gurl it was ur angelic voice take several seats.
She's got that serene look and smile ,very unique beauty.
🤩🤩🤩🤩
sometimes i forget that she’s the huge star she is, she’s just so dang relatable... love this girly 💜

She's literally so amazing ❤️

I don't mean to be annoying here. But why are you only featuring 16 to 25yr olds for skincare routines on here? I want to know the skincare routine of a 45yr old who looks 30yrs old. Vogue has turned into Cosmo Girl.
Olivia is so Pretty 💖
Yes Olivia!!!!
I’ve been wanting to know for so long what lip color she uses and now I know!😭thx Vogue
wait..... she's only 18 ????
I love how she’s just like the rest of us 1.pretending to do vogue tutorials  2. Trying to get the eyeliner right but just reminding herself that nothings perfect 3. The crazy makeup when she was younger Really down to earth and not like the drama that the media is making her her out to be x

POV: You are looking at the future successor of Taylor Swift
Olivia I love you!!! But honey, like HYRAM would say " where's the moisturiser?"& " where's the sunscreen?"
hehe
loved this
I could honestly hear her talk for hours and not get tired- she’s so soft spoken
i dont know why but i am imagining if they are doing in it in my toilet, there will be a lot of things hanging and dangling behind the door ie jeans, used bras etc
"my hair is very oily" *puts hair oil *
DANG SHAWTYYYYYY

I want a friend like her😊

olivia has such a fresh and natural face !! it’s refreshing to look at her
im crying the hehe was so cute
I can already see Hyram yelling about sunscreen
she's pretty
JAKSAKKS me da risa como pronuncia "Rodrigo"
Olivia and Catriona Gray really resemble a lot. The vibes, the figure of the face, and the shape of the eyes.
i’m not a huge fan of olivia but this is exactly what vogue should do to attract gen z audience, bring actual celebrities and talented people not tiktokers who do nothing.
she’s so pretty and talented i can’t. 😫
This video is so perfect in a way that her explanations are not boring, and since this video is about Glossier products I like how she doesn't sound fake complimenting the products she used, she has cute back stories to it and really makes me feel like she's endorsing the brand because she genuinely likes the products and actually uses them.
We’re Living for her. We’re Livies 💜
I would love to see BLACKPINK here. Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé n Lisa, any of the girls 🖤💗👑👑👑👑
been waiting for queen to do a beauty secrets with vogue and here it is YES
That bb cream is NOT  her shade, like okay James Charles
She's naturally beautiful and her skin is just flawless God why is Olivia Rodrigo so perfect in every thing?! Singing, beauty, personality everything
Olivia you have beautiful skin and I know you are young and in the moment, but use SPF!!!!
SHE SHOULD DEFINITELY TRY RAREBEAUTY OMG!!

"eyeliners are sister not twins" I LOVE THIS BAHSHABSHBASHB
She's so pretty
She should use a moisturiser also applying serum like that is very unhygienic
Finally a celebrity and not a TiKtoKeR
Bb❤️
It gives me anxiety when she’s doing skincare with her hair down
ME WATCHING: PLEASE DO NOT MENTION TAYLOR'S NAME.
107k views in a hour woah
Do Billie Eilish next!
Fact : She's the only celebrity who used less makeup among all the other celebrities who did their makeup routine at Vogue.
OLIVIA😩😍
Can we have lana del rey ?? Is that too much to ask ? 😭
😍😍😍
@skincarebyhyram
She really represent alot of us: talking in front of the mirror while doing our skincare/make up routine pretending that we're in vogue 😁
when is emma watson gonna be on here😭😭
when she said "i'm 18" i had this weird feeling cuz here's a 18 year old like her and i'm the same age and have done nothing of value in my life and still waiting for that post-puberty beauty glow up
Its impossible to not love her !💕
she just seems like super nice and chill person you just want to be friends with her
Love her
even tho idc about this i just really enjoy hearing her talk cuz she really seems like a very approachable friendly person who gets along with everyone and anyone.
I love you Olivia
Omg one hour ago, so iconic
She is the cutest
Hyaluronic acid is for older women so when I got the ordinary my mom explained that I can’t use it because young kids already have a bunch of hyaluronic acid in their skin, so it would be bad to add more
Sis, where's your moisturizer and sunscreen! 🥺😔😭😭😭
YAASS GIIRRLL🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
i remember a few years ago she was in that terrible disney channel show with jake Paul
SHE IS SO GORGEOUS
I also apply that exact same serum (by ordinary) that exact same way. Hahaha
Everything’s great but where is the sunscreen ?
I never watch these but this was super interesting
shes so chill and perfect and i admire that about her
Ooop
I have my cute little glossier bag "hi hi"  It was so funny and cute
olivia is the tipe of person i always want by my side
7:42 "eyeliners are sisters not twins" 😂💓 I love her and also what she said about symmetrical faces, which has been one insecurity that I had lately. Her personality is everything!
She’s the sweetest 🙃
*OLIVIA* *RODRIGO~* 💖
im actually kinda happy?? to see that olivia's make up style is almost identical to mine :,))  i just adore her so much and she's also one of my biggest inspirations at the moment
Her skin looks so soft! I always wanted to know how she got it that way and this helped a ton!!!

She has the prettiest lips
Ahhh finally

You are a model😍
Everyone's debut should be like her
i love how her brows aren't freshly done. makes the look so much more natural. not a fan of her music but I think she'd be a super cool and chill person to hang out with.
Idk why but the way she speaks is an attractive mix of jessie eisenburg and kritsen stewart.  I'm weird.
BILLIE EILISH COLLAB PLS
FINALLY she’s on vogue
I love her acknowledging she is a teenager, she's 18, she's not going to have perfect skin. There is a lot of messaging out there in beauty and fashion that pushes young girls to be fully grown women, and I appreciate her resisting that and fully embracing her youth.
IM SO EXCITED FOR HER
