mac or mock 1 😂
The newer Mach One’s really missed their mark by not offering the iconic shaker hood.
I love the test, Richard, and the replies on-screen are great.
Active value 😂
7:40   Drivetribe's insurance company *starts panicking*
they call it the right for a reason
the old mustangs looked much the new ones look fat
He’s not even driving the top Mach 1. This one has no handling pkg. it’s the base model with appearance pkg only. They get better….
This review and jay leno garage got me to pull the trigger on this gorgeous car. 4 years in and 20k miles later, still gives me that therapeutic moment whenever I need. The 6spd tremec and the naturally aspirated Coyote is a perfect combination of power, reliability and the old school feel.
Go Brother Rick Go!   (smile)
DRIVETRIBE, love how you keep leveling up!  If you’re ever looking for help with post-production, storytelling, keywords, or intros, I’d be happy to collaborate!
Mack 1, Hammond?? Really??😭🚶🏻
With the convertible you feel the Sound better?
"professional driver" is crazy
Old
This came out on my 15th birthday
does the trio ever drive a 50's corvette?
Who
In 2015 the Musrangs began having 4 wheel independent suspension. No more leaf springs in the back.
I hate when Europeans say it has a massive v8 ,a smallblock is not massive
not pronounced mack 1, its mock 1as in  how fast sound travels per second
No that’s the proper side
Power  by a MAC computer 💻 😅 I could go on all day on this beauty MAC 1 😅 someone hire linguist for this gent 😅
What’s a Mac 1 ? Macdonlads one ?
454 hp ? I thought these made 480?
what a great video. Hammond is awesome.
It's a bad motor scooter!
1973.mach.1 I think is the best looking mustang
I wonder what year this mach 1 was and if this could be in a racing game like the forza series or Gran Turismo
I miss the old top gear when it was just about the ins and outs of the showcased car and not any of the sideshow filler BS...
This attempt to appeal to younger audiences with scripted questions prompting throughout the review is lame.
454hp? What kind of crazy emissions does the U.K. have? Here in the U.S.A. it's  480hp....?
No Tremec shifter???
Compared to your 67 it looks all swollen and bloated and like it's diabetic and having reaction.
Jeremy "deep down, Hammond is a secret American😌🇺🇸"
Left is the proper side. :)
Indeed... secret test facility opposite the school corner
Anyone besides me waiting for “ ..turning it over to our tame racing driver “ as soon as those cones came out? - Hammond steps out, Stig hops in.  Some say we’re all still waiting for it…
Love the helmet!!
Doesn’t even sound like a Mustang. The sound of the car is what people like. Like a thunderstorm approaching but you can’t see it. You can hear it though!
My daily driver is jeep commander it's 4.7 and makes around 305 hp and my fun car is mustang gt 5 speed that I'm working on it
Looks like. Jeams bond car 🚗
The original Mustang had an "adjustable suspension". The driver simply has to adjust to it.
As a Mustang owner, I'm sad to report that the Dodge Challenger has outsold the Mustang 2 years in a row in the US. My theory is that Ford "Europeanized" the Mustang's design too much. The Challenger looks way more retro.
The problem with the new Mustang is that you are always up on the steering wheel when driving.  It does not ride like the older Mustangs where you can get comfortable and simply be able to put your foot into it in a leisurely manner.  An M440i would be a more comfortable ride.
Calling Richard a professional driver is a bit of a stretch isn’t it? More like professional crasher. And don’t worry, you needn’t warn us about not attempting anything that Richard does.
Stop asking these filthy Brits to review American made muscle cars, of course they’re going to have a bias.
I just picked up my 1972 Ford Mach 1. I hope I can afford one of these before I'm 30, because I'd love to see the side by side between my 5.8L and the modern 5L
I need more Grand Tour 🥰🥰🥰.. love that show.
"PROFESSIONAL" DRIVER 🤣
Ford must keep the grill of mustang same as 1969 mustang. The grill/ front of all the newer generations of mustang look like Ford Focus. Fix the grill and I guarantee you that mustang will be the best seller of all time.
The 67 Mustang was the same car he used 13 years ago on this Top Gear review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O46E0gCF5os  look at the plate number KAS 189 :)
I really like your '67 Mustang. It ticks off ALL the boxes. The color, stripes and wheels. My '65 never had the chance to see a nice finish as she was stolen and stripped... Now we face the harsh reality. The old ones are slow, noisy and don't handle well. You cringe everytime an idiot, on the road when you do take it out, gets close to you... Restomods are extremely expensive... The best alternative is to get a new one. That Mach 1 is a great place to start...
Horse go VERY fast
The 1971 Mustang Mach 1 that Hammond drove in Patagonia is one of my favourite cars and probably in the top 5 best cars they had on the show. Shame they couldn't bring it back. It was a wonderful machine.
Sounds like the detuned it for Europe... in the US the 2021 Mach 1 makes 470HP and 420 LB feet of Torque  and has a 4 sec 0-62 MPH and 168 MPH top end with with the Automatic...
Horse go very fast
Very awesome :)
Is it manual???
Love the noise! Not a fan of these digital dashes though, give me analogue clocks any day of the week 👍
The production quality of this video would be on par, if not better than Top Gear
❤️👌👍
👍😎👌
Horse go very fast
I'm still not a fan of the refreshed lights from 2018-present. I prefer the 2015-2017 front end, which the Shelby versions use.
Top 3 mustangs of all time….
I hate the direction so called muscle cars have been taking for some time now. This takes the cake
Engineering Explained has done videos on how Ford is sabotaging the manual Mustangs in recent years!  When the manual and automatic were both 6 speeds, they were both using the same gear ratios, however now that the 10 speed automatic is out, the 6 speed manual suddenly has a longer final drive, supposedly fitted for improved fuel economy, however for enthusiast drivers, the end result is that it has worse acceleration that it used to, while the 10 speed has improved acceleration!  Really what they're doing is anything they can to push people into buying the silly automatics! 😯😐😂😀🤘  https://youtu.be/Y25ordkIfgM
0:17  He did not just say MAC one!?!? 😖
Can u compare it to italian sports cars  or German cars nope
MACH1 AKA GT performance pack 2 for THOUSANDS more lol 🤷🏼‍♂️ (basically ford couldn't afford to warranty the oil burning 5.2L voodoo motor anymore)
As soon as you see it next to the old model it looks disappointing.
Wish it had the Voodoo
I've owned my s550 since 2016. It's phenomenal. 6 years later it's still the best car I've owned
Fix or Repair Daily.  Failed on Race Day.   Gross I've owned Fords.  Never again!
6:02 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Ricky Hammond
Love your videos. So funny
Mine's arrived and it's fair to say Hammond's review was spot on  ...if only I had his '67 too! If you wanna see what it's like to actually live with you can click thru to my attempt - not exactly TopGear but it was fun :)
Mack 1?
When it faded to black at the end I was waiting for an applause and a transition into a studio or tent
why so little horsepower
The US version has more power and is faster.
That is way too tame an exhaust for a v8
really like the splicing of viewers real life stories with the film.  Brings it to life and makes it feel genuine
Nice to see Americans like Richard on the channel 😆
Everything
The steering wheel is already on the proper side. It's an American car sir
Proper stuff unlike the Mach E.
What's the difference Mach 1 cobra  gt350 ? How does it compare to those and the price
Gimme a 1967 Mustang GT500 any day
450 bph!!! So little, like is it even a musclecar.
5:16 😂🤣 based on his true own experience
correct side actually since yall never won a war and always needs the assistance of the united states yall come in second with everything yall do so there fore its on the correct side
my v8 mustang
I miss the Mustang Mach 1 which he drove in a top gear special it had the gung thing on the bonnet
Actually I was hoping he was going to test a limited edition Mustang with a supercharged flat plane crank 5.2V8 making 800hp such as The Shelby Super Snake!
Hot sauce is the best
It's a bit Camaro-y now... And it made me like it.
The best question, can it do Gymkhana?
I need a late 60's fastback stang.
Bad idea putting it next to a 67 like that lol
Pronounced Mock 1 not Mack 1
from an american...that 67 classic is outstanding!!
Started on the wrong side...
For Mustang lovers with an original soundtrack : https://youtu.be/uqVw3FEHtaw
Nice to see it’s a ‘67 again.
Richard, if you and Rod Stewart had a baby it would look like a half-you, half-Rod Stewart hybrid person.... A diminutive British man with long hair and a longer c*ck.  Legend.
Left side is the proper side lol!
I think it's funny that they try to hide the fact that he's driving an automatic version of the mach 1. Bet he wished it was a 6sp
4:54 That's a familiar looking helmet
Cant question the science
From driving our 03 Mach 1, I sure do miss the shaker style hood
"professional driver". I almost cried laughing at that😂😂
Best sounding mustang
Why so down on power?  A standard GT in the Yank land is 460hp/420tq and the Mach 1 is 480hp.
glad theres no ford badges outside
thats nice and that colour
3:43 I love it. "Professional driver". Richard Hammond is a 'Professional'? No....
Vlad in his v6 asking about the exhaust of a v8 😂😂
I hate how down on power euro models are.
In Australia 🇦🇺  had cash to buy one, would not let me b test drive, and with right hand drive to open the bonnet or hood.. was on passenger side... kept my old ute and money. That was after having 10 new Fords as company cars.. Fk Ford dealers.
I take on in red with a black hood pls 🤤
Horse do go very fast
was the writing at 3:45 meant to be referring to Richard? Professional crasher i would say.
Ski guy, stick with your prius you're not a car guy if mpg is a thing!
He needs to learn how to pronouce the name Mach.  It's NOT Mack
20 yrs ago 450 was everything as far as horsepower!! Now it just standard.
Love where the M1 sits in the product lineup.  I have a GT with a full Roush suspension upgrade and 350 strut tower bar, and what it needs is a drive-train sport or sport+ mode that can be matched to a softer suspension mode.  If I were to upgrade today I would go to this.   I don’t need everything the 350 offers and I can have more fun on local roads without being as loud as the 350R
Is it just me or does this "ford" have Jaguar headlights?
Mustang mach 1? The green one that hammond make love with? That what i remember.
I LIKE THE FORD MUSTANG BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF MUSTANGS UNLIKE CAMAROS, CORVETTS, CHARGERS, CHALLENGERS, GTO'S,  PORCHES, ETC.
480 hp FIFY
480 hp FIFY

Sometimes i feel like why buy a Mach I when you can buy a Shelby GT350.  Now the Shelby GT350 is no longer in production and the value is climbing up and up.  Makes me very happy I bought a brand new one a few yrs back.
Regardless of how much more technologically advanced newer vehicles are. There’s absolutely nothing as satisfying as driving a classic. It’s a true man and machine experience that you just can’t get with all the modern electronic features.
it's mock, not mack
Oh look! They called Hammond a professional driver.
I want to know I appreciate this video, number one it’s is not a drag demonstration. You are driving on a road course which is the way it should be as far as I’m concerned. That in itself is. Enough reason to watch this video
Horse now go vroom vroom and not neigh ??
Ok I just watched how this Mustang performs on that loop, and it is absolutely ridiculously clumsy slow and imprecise in front of a M2 for example😂😂😂😂 This is the first taste that I have seen from this car that makes me not want to buy it.
A winner imho
More like Richard wrecks new ford mustang mach1
The classic one still looks better, feels better and I'd take it even with no airbags!
I will take that 68 over that pile of🤬 any day
the secret american
Great looking car, the ground clearance looks awkward though. Needs to be slightly lower imo
Did the warning say “Professional Driver” referring to Hammond??? 😂😂😂😂
Richard I personally prefer your older Mustang. That car is I think very cool.
1:36 Hammond said there is only 390Nm of torque! that is false information, it would have over 530Nm
when he shows the mustang for the first time it looks like when u unlock a new car on need for speed rivals
450hp. Thought it was 480hp
Thank you, Hammond, for your diligent sciencing!
Needs a shaker.  It's not a Mach 1 without a shaker!!!
am i the only one that thinks that mustang rear lights look weird
0:08 nice TG callback
Im more a fan of the '65 mustang gt coupe. Beautiful car
There's something about the front of the car that reminds me of the later versions of the Jag XF R. The way the headlights look from the side angles. That same beautiful focused mature look.
The manual shift version is the only one that I'd even consider. Clutch pedals rule!
The classic Mustang Hammond arrived in had presence. The Mach 1 v2 came off a kids drawing.
You just know if you had one it would end up sleeping with your wife.
Hammond showing how to crash a Mustang leaving cars and coffee meet.
If you want people to be interested in the new mustang then don't show the old one.
Why he keep saying mac like it's a McDonald's burger. Its M A C H
Wonder if Richard Hammond picks his outfits himself or if someone else does
Still take the 67' any day
POV: Ford team watching Richard drifting
"professional driver" LOL
I have to say I've always liked the simplicity of the LS and LT Chevrolet engines, vs the GIGANTIC complex Ford engines.  Anyone who's put headers on their 5.0 knows exactly what I'm talking about here lol.  That being said, it is an attractive platform and I'd chalk it up be being a great car.  Although I'd throw the magnetic ride in the trash can and cut the exhaust system off to be melted down into jewelry... But that's just me.
All you loser wanna beez . Should get your look together
you are wrong, mustang never was a muscle car but pony car. its big difference.
PROFESSIONAL DRIVER. CLOSED CIRCUIT. DO NOT ATTEMPT. LOL.
If I won the lottery I might well buy a new Stang. How ever I would much prefer that 67 of yours, the lines alone make it shine. Look after it Richard and please dont bend it.
"Mack 1" LOL
Does anybody know the colour of the car..... cheers
The old one looks better
I noticed your mach 1 is an automatic,  Is it available in manual 6 speed?
It's pronounced mock 1 Mr. Hammond, not mack 1.
Nothing can beat the 67 Mustang. It gives a John wick vibe. Mustang Mach 1 is indeed not a standard model plus it’s  GT350. Can’t find a better dream car. Just need Hammond’s rash driving skills, which is of no Match.🤣
It's not a Mack 1..... It's a Mach 1.
Mach 1's Have a Shaker Hood   .  .  .  . .
It would've been so cool to see Hammond's 1971 Mach 1 from the Patagonia Special, if it still was around.
Hammond and a mustang, is there a combination that's worse than this? No, not even close
Starting price of £55000 for a Ford No thanks
I prefer the Mach 1 with the track package
The flush hood scoop is not impressive
Thankfully he'd got the chance to test this kind of Mach. Not the "E" one
ford: professional driver do not attempt  GIVE IS IT TO RICHARD HAMMOND
I love Hammond, I do, but Lol'd hard at "value".
And today's episode of The Grand Tour:  Richard drives a Mustang  A stranger calls Hammond And James drives a dacia sandero
Does it provide a sonic boom before it reaches the top speed?
And the camaro will smoke it
It's a shame that "putting the steering wheel on the proper side" (it isn't) nerfs the horsepower and torques as much as it does. At least Eurofriends could actually buy one!
Active value exhaust??  Did he say that?????
Fastback still looks better
There was no mention of a price
"Professional driver". It is funny because I watched the entire video and I only saw Richard driving. Where is him?
Ford Mustang Mach 0.22
Can you change to analog dials on the Mach 1?.
"Ford's secret test facility" just before he tells you exactly where it is😂
Richard sounds like a car salesman here. Like he doesn't really like it but is forced to say he does
i hope he didnt crash it
Camaro                  a small mammal  that hunts  mustangs
Man, what happened to Hugh Jackman?
Another gas guzzling v8 from the climate warming Yanks.  Well done Ford.
put that tech in the shock absorbers in nfl helmuts.. i've been thinking that for a while now.
They should’ve kept the voodoo engine!
I understand that this is your job and I really like you but it just feels so sad that you are being fake here. Coming out of the original mustang, you stepped into a plastic garbage can and you still have the audacity to proclaim it "a true mustang" etc... Yes things are different nowadays and way more complicated for sure. But the automotive industry is a shame nowadays, just an expensive package without an essence. In all of the mainstream brands... It just feels wrong to see you supporting and being part of that. And that comes from a die hard fan of the Top Gear and all the other shows I've seen you on TV.
The world needs more science!!! 😁
The 67 Mustang still looks cooler than the new one 🔥🔥🔥
Only ONE question I gotta know...  Do they plan on comming out with an H.B. Halicki gone in 60 seconds virsion? Because we wouldn't have the GT500 without the Mach 1 Virsion first.
I wonder if FoMoCo had seen my cousins Rimec incident? (Cousin thing I made that up).
iS IT A BULLITT, REBADGED...?
Hammond loose the gut, you are starting to look like Clarkson
Older front end was better
Awesome!!   There's something about this color scheme.... I like my RACE RED, But this car is a beauty 👌  Thanks Richard!
I’ll take your ‘67 or a ‘69 Mach 1 all day.
No mention of the trans being designs for no lift upshifting
Hammond has the driving skill of a six year old.
You can’t beat an old Mustang, check out this tribute. https://youtu.be/ALbcxe_exrA
As nice as the Mach 1 is, I'd rather have Richard's Fastback. Preferably *before* he crashes it.
Did they just call hammond... a PROFESSIONAL driver???????
4:00 made me think Hammond crashed again
Yep I’ve gotta get me one of those
I thought they called the electric mustang mach also???? Anyone
Use too much petrol and cost too much
I'm getting a ford Mustang for my birthday I'm not going to tell anyone it's out of lego
"That sort of thing doesn't end well for me." Lol
I want mustang 1967 too :{
It said professional driver lol yeah professional lol
Yeah Science!!
Oh that's got to hurt, now everybody knows about the testing facility.
Not so secret anymore is it...
"By Billericay Town FC" ... No. It's in Basildon
Planet twisting 390 torque or less than a mapped golf tdi. Non Shelby mustangs are for a special breed of idiot
im pretty sure the last few mins. with the figure 8 just goes to show that it is indeed...a typical mustang. grand piano on ice
It’s Mach I, not Mack 1. It literally says it on the front of the car Hammond. Come ‘on, you’re practically an American. You gotta get this right!
Id give my left nut for a mustang!
on my way to a secret test facility located at :
I had a mustang back in the 70s and the name used to be Mustang Fastback Mach 1, have they dropped Fastback now, or is it because they only make fastbacks and dont need to bring it up anymore...???
Yes, horse do go very fast.
Хорошая жизнь.
I don’t like this video format, I don’t wanna Hammond jus sitting there answering questions, I wanna see his experiences and words. DriveTribe had made Hammond losing his personality on the show.
I'm betting that the only reason he didn't leave with the Mach 1 was because he'd have to abandon his '67.
'Steering wheel on the proper side'? I'm in the UK and have american cars and trucks. ALL american cars with right hand drive have the steering wheel on the WRONG side! Mustang owners get really wound up by that lol 😆
You need to get the handling package.
Hammond is American with his mustang and his Whitten teeth
Hi Hamster. Loving this car. Once my stonks come in forget the lambo, I'm getting the Mach 1
The Mach 1 is 480 HP and 420 ft-lbs of torque in America as long as it has high octane fuel.
Nice video, thanks!
Teraz Ljay nim jeździ!!
Car goes VROOM! 🤣
The legend is getting old
I haven’t had a Mustang in my life since 2011. This year I’m fixing that problem.
oh? Mach 1 is detuned for Europe?
I feel like Scott’s video was 15 minutes long
The 2021 Mach-one weighs 3900 lbs, Richards 68 GT-390 weighs 3347 lbs...the pig-fest remains...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1HWL3ygJRg&t=31s
Richard Hammond or Al Pacino?
How much did they pay you Richard?
All these years and Richard still cant link a figure 8 doni haha, we love you man.
When people ask about mileage on a performance car...
I like the tarnished dark multi spoke wheels so much more on the performance package, but beautiful car none the less 👌🏼
An 11:38 long ad.
3:41 Why dose it say that Richard Hammond is a professional driver?
Value performance exhaust ?!!
Thought it was supposed to be 480hp?
I wish you could have let it loose on a proper track.
The US spec Mach 1 makes 480 hp
How safe is it at a cars and coffee meet? Be afraid.....Be very afraid!
480 Hp in the USA
“Professional driver” clumsily navigating the figure 8, hurts to watch
Isnt this just an newer focus? An expensive one too
He definitely dye's that beard.
Why do people not get that the new mustangs have independent rear suspension today? It handles better than  a lot of cars now.
*That was pretty funny.*
"Professional Crasher. Closed Circuit. What could POSSIBLY go wrong?"
Why does it sound so muted...
All it needs is the “Shaker Hood”.
The colour combo is brilliant
I just love “ Active value performance exhaust “ 🤣🤣🤣
"active value exhaust"🙌
can it turn corners? :p
Will it crash into crowds? Will it make the owner more atractive to his/her cousin? Haha just kidding... Ford always finds a way of making mustangs a bit better looking, every generation. Pretty much the opposite of Honda with their Civic.
“Mack one”
It’s a nice looking car, but you can buy much more car for your money elsewhere. E.g. my Genesis G70 3.3t has equal/better performance, a much better drive, significantly more upgrades, more space in the back (and that says something!)…
Recorded horizontally:)
All that MATTERS IS they keep making it, so we dont have only throw away appliances to pick from.
155?  Probably because of EU LaWs 😒
fuking designers ,although it is somehow improved as if they still fail to achieve a superior result worthy of the mustang .... many enthusiasts have managed to improve the old retro models much better than these designers who had the opportunity and budget to create something new ... but however, although they had a starting design ... where to get inspiration from, they still did not make progress and although they are probably well paid, they did not yield ... and considering that it is a ford mustang .... not enough okay ... back to drawing
its not the rong side ... its left side ... normal especiali for a mustang ... wil be a sacrilege to build a mustang with steering wheel on right side :)))
It's not really a mustang test unless you crash it into a bank leaving a car show seeing as that's what most mustang owners will do
but does it run like the speed of sound ?
Richard's 67 is still prettier.
Correction 480 hp  and 460 ft lbs
New mach 1: badass muscle machine, worthy successor to the of mach 1. mach e: NOT A MUSTANG.
As much torque as my Discovery 2 td5 slightly tuned
5:10 *flash backs to the land speed record rocket car incident*
3:42 “Professional Drive”  I wouldn’t be so sure
That track pack Mach 1 is beautiful, the engine retains more torque over the GT350 too
Fantastic! Love the Mach 1. .......by the way no crowd people were hurt during the filming of this video.
They called Hammond a Professional Driver 😂😂😂😂😂
If you wanna blood,call Vlad  🚗 brm,brmm
Are the UK specs different that the US?
The proper side is the left, not the right matey. The majority of the population of right handed, could you imagine shifting with your left non dominate hand. This alone defeats your argument for the "proper side".
to Derin, new gen mustang is not a pony or muscle car anymore well except for gt500, they are more like sports car now
Your 67 is way more interesting.
too many ads on this channel
Gotta have that active value exhaust
Sorry but if you own a Mustang and have to leave for work early.....your neighbours should be used to that growl. If it has a quiet button then it is not a Mustang
So, The Horse of a Man, didn’t get to drive the fast Pony ?
Yes there are electric vehicles that’ go light speed but the clutch and a V8 makes me giggle for joy.
Wasn't the mach1 Electric?
Professional driver on a closed circuit....   hahahahahahahahahahaha. Hes crashed more than a shopping cart in a parking lot.
#Stangmode
But can it go round a corner properly?
I want Richard to be a faculty in Engineering course!! That will definitely make it hilariously awesome.
3:25 love how he says 'proper side'
"professional driver" why is drivetribe lying to us
Im in love with this car .. I do now understand the song from Roger Taylor :D
Why did I spend nearly 12 minutes watching an advertisement???
The new STANGS are the S@#$!!!! We absolutely loves ours. Traded a 2018 SS in for our GT 5.0!!!!!!!!
3:44 "Professional driver" well... mostly
thats not new suspension metal ball were made and  used in the 50s and 60s and 70s usa  so its not new
Not electric? Not interested.
Calling Hammond a professional driver is a bit of a stretch. Expert crasher, that’s a title.
Wasn't his 67 Mustang blue and white back in 2006/2007?
It's 480hp, 420lbft
Im glad to hear that Hammond's driver side door on his Mustang slams and then rattles, just like my 66 coupe.  Even the closeted American is subject to that.
I see that everyone is judging his driving skills!! Most of you never drove a car with more than 200hp,and never been to a track, never pushed a car to its limits, etc. So take it easy guys if this guy will drive a Clio Rs on a track against any of you with a car of your choice, he will smoke you all day long!!
Hahaha horsey go VROOOOOOM
exterior looks like any other 2020 mustang
My dad just bought one 3 days ago, it's the most gorgeous looking Mustang Ever.
☝️😄 Remove the mole saboteur at Ford Corporation sent in to infiltrate, sent by dodge or Chevy or both? The best selling mustang (recent times) 05-09 design got derailed and morphed into the “Asian GTR slant headlights” we see today. How is it that a 94-04 mustang design generation body style is allowed to perpetuate persistently for 11 years? While a drastically improved generation 05-09 proven through sales is allowed just 5 years? Something does not jive at Ford Corporation. How is it that Dodge challengers  and Chevy ZL1s produce much more stronger engines? And are optional with sunroofs? While the GT Mustangs are not allowed to have sunroofs at Ford Corporation? Not to mention a lot weaker engines as well. Someone making decisions at Ford in the mustang design is none other than a mole saboteur sent to infiltrate via Dodge or Chevy.
Thank you for showing us
Remove the mole at Ford corporation sabotaging Ford’s Mustang’s potential. Edit: hint, this mole is sent by Dodge and Chevy
The only has a different grill and stripes? At least the last Mach 1 looked different from the GT and had a better engine.
Shame Hammond can't catch a Macho Man Randy Savage reference even when the dude is wearing a MMRS tshirt
3:44 "professional driver"?   Richard is known for crashing (2017) so professional driver may be a bit wrong
I cannot ďecide whether he is mocking the pronunciation of the word mach...
Doing donuts isn't much of a test, with 500 BHP RWD it's lukewarm water. He has driven it on factory proving ground... In fact, I suppose Ford has some proper curves to test car handling, that we haven't saw on the video. He can't judge much of handling on steeply banked high speed curves, so I wander if Richard even tried Mach on some normal curves without cameras for some handling merits. By the way, I am doing same job as he does for 30 years, motoring journalist, testing cars...actually not enthusiastic about this video at all...
"Professional Driver"
Richard Hammond in a crowd killing mustangs what could go wrong 🤣🤣🤣
We need more videos like this of the trio
10:25is that a "corridor digital" hat
In the UK this model is apparently known as the Mack One.
Richard Hammond doing an ad for ford but making it look he's not...well done! do love the car though!!
The old Mustang is totally upstaging that Mach 1.
mustang too big for small man
maztang
Sounds like a rs4 to me maybe the sound was bad on my phone
The wary plywood cytochemically belong because health arguably balance throughout a simplistic course. flat, chunky indonesia
A 718 can so easaly pass it on the nüeburgring
Who said that Hamond is a PROFESIONAL DRIVER!!!
hammond ant binned it yet wow
is it a mustang if its not a v8 ? since some in that video were not v8's
0:05 - 0:12 ah the top gear jokes
Ehh.. the right side Is the wrong side!!
It's written: " Professional Driver". Can tell you something. He doesn't appear in the entire video... yes, you can check by yourself... haha
where is the seat belt hammond👀
It's a no from me - Looks like a fat taxi.
No one caught on to Richard's jet car reference
😂😂😂 stop it is a american car and it will do 2 things only ... 1 go fast in a Straight line . 2 make a lot of sound from that V8 and thats it ... What ever you do .... do not touch the stearing wheele.
cybertruck is faster....
The steering wheel is on the correct side! It's American, remember!?!
So it has the same 0-60 and 12 MPH less top end than my straight-4 Honda S-2000. And weighs as much as a planet.
This entire demo/review was extremely coordinated.
I’m writing this before I watch the video, if Richard likes the Mach e then I will no longer like him
@3:41 "Professional Driver"
Much cooler car then BMW M4.
YES YES YES FINALLY A CLASSIC MADE MODERN
Is it a Mack 1 or a Mach 1  I think he's saying Mack  LOL
Enjoy it now because ford already said they're going 100% green in a couple years, get woke go broke  can't wait for the loser cruiser electric mustangs with 0 exhaust note  LOL
did u crush it?
Mustang is an American icon thus the steering wheel "is" on the propper side now.....
It's a shame Ford made a HUGE deal about wheels that aren't even available on the car...
Those gauges are  horrible!!!🤢🤢🤢
I loves me a Mack one . Mother Russia is proud of you!
Shelby GT500
480 hp and 420 tq in the states
Hammond is slowly morphing in to Al Pacino
The annoying public people in this video were definitely the worst part of it.
race route 500 in Scotland
active VALUE exhaust ?
Haha the guy asking if it handles,  because it's a mustang..... the S550 has been dragging euro sports cars through the mud for years now , the 350R beat a 458 on laguna Seca xD
One word: Tesla
Wrong side ?? ----How'd you manage to drive there ???
Why would you ask the mpg. It could get 2 mpg and i wouldn’t hesitate to buy it
Boring!
Richard they already DID put the steering wheel on the “proper” side.  It’s an American car remember?
I love Mustangs they are the most powerful, most beautiful, most special muscle cars, that sing to my heart! ☺️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
The 67 is soooo much cooler.
After hearing the Mach didn’t have the flat plane crank 5.2- I lost interest. It’s a sticker and badge package
I'm watching this on my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and wow! The video is literally in 4K and looks like I'm watching it on the cinemas!!
The captions advertising professional driver are a clear overstatement!
i was waiting for Clarkson to come screaming round a corner with some over the top power
ill take a japenese car all day..evo or wrx would run ALL over that thing
Why is it Fords drive better than any other mainstream manufacturer? What is the magic they do?  Just a shame their interiors are 10 years behind the rest of the world.
don't think he's pronouncing it right
привет, Влад!
The Mach 1 is 480hp and 420 lb ft of torque her in the US
The engine noise in the video is fake lol. The coyote motor sounds way different in real life. You kinda hear it when inside the cabin, but the outside recordings are plain fake
Every time Richard turns the steering wheel of a car, there is a 0.1% chance of death
Own it with my 5.0
Is it Manual or Automatic
Lots of love from Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh, India 🙂🙏💜
Wow, Hammond looks like he is morphing into AL Pacino.
I think I would rather have his '67.
It has the steering wheel on the correct side.   It has the wrong exhaust that is only available in the UK.   The right exhaust is only available in North America.
Why does everyone always dodge the mpg question lol. Ford, and other manufacturers have made it so that you can have your cake and eat it too. Sure it doesn’t compare to a 4 cylinder econobox, but the old ideas of big v8s not allowing decent mpg is outdated. Mach 1 is 15 city and 23 hwy. other 5.0 offerings are roughly the same, getting 24-25.  Even beyond that though, many builders have made 4-500hp v8 powered vehicles that can manage 19-21.
He's american
My hero!
oh and Richard, which brand of hair and beard dye do you use, none of the brands I've tried work very well
I'm a Brit now living in the US, cars like these seem very glamorous in the UK but are ten a penny here (obviously), can be picked up for next to nothing, after all at the end of the day it's just a Ford.
A Honda Civic will spin circles around fat slug
i agree that it may still have the spirit but i feel the shape has been ruined as its now the size of a small SUV  but still a coupe. maybe thats just what the future looks like but i dont like it if thats the case. just an opinion, take it with a grain of salt.
I drove a new GT and a Ferrari California Spyder within a week of each other and was shocked at how close they are to each other in driving dynamics. This is why marketing is paramount for some companies.
Anybody know the paint code?
He of all people should have proper seatbelts fitted to his car!
I like how he's kept his 68 Mustang after all these years
Shame the MACH 1 is so slow.. 4.4sec and top speed of 155?? I hope it's cheap at least. Something here needs to make sense. A Focus RS does better numbers than this.. for way less money. I'm so confused.
The 2012- 2013 Boss 302's are still the best NA Mustangs.... I think.
"A bit more science to do". Ah, the things we do for science
WHAT A BEAST!  I recently Ranked my TOP 5 Muscle Cars on my channel, check it out!
“Mack 1”
What does do not attempt mean? Not drive?
Does it come in ...black
Nomatter what they might build in the future,nothing will ever compare to that '67 fastback of yours !! Great going man!
Richard's voice in the background while a preview of the car is given...     Oh Brings Back Memories...
I love american cars, but I have to admit, germans make way more efficient engines. Though may not be as reliable... but take am m5 for example.
Mack 1 HAHAHA
I love his laugh at the end
mach1 looks stunning
I'm eating a chocolate from my secret stash, just from the coffee table in the lounge
Really only 450hp tf why
I love the way that the Mach 1's rear end just whips around in Richard's Loop
Someone had fun.
They should have gone electric or hybrid, give it some serious power? 🤔
Mustang will always be Mustang.
i miss the trio together.
Tony Stark drives Mustang! :-D
could not have more of a mood with this classic UK fog
Is it not mk1 and not mach 1?
now that the grand tour is over as we know it they only do specials which I still like they should all 3 Clarkson, Hammond, and may review cars on youtube more often like they did on the original show and maybe still have a lap board
Wish it had real fogs
2:02 Is that Bellular? WTH?!
It's not a Mach 1 without the Shaker Hood.
Do all these people complaining about no shaker realize that it would offer no performance gain and would alter aerodynamics? Why would you want that on a track car?
That 67 is well put together...the sound of that door closing....
Never been into American cars, can see anything changing any time soon.. 🤢🤢
This package is gonna be over 60k for basically a gt with stripes and cosmetic work. What a joke for that price a shelby gt350 its by a far a better choice. The mustang was supposed to be an affordable american muscle car..... not anymore
I’m not impressed ...where’s the shaker ...it just other mustang with a different badge
It’s pronounced mawk not Mack
3:43 "Professional driver"  Me: *Laughs in Swedish accident* Also Me: *Laughs in Jeremy Clarkson and James May*
Meh!!
I would pay to watch Ham drive the GT 350
the UK only gets 454hp?  We get 480!!
Planet twisting 390ft lbs? My company truck has 1035ft lb. So it should destroy the planet whenever I start it.
Liked the video before watching it. That's the amount of trust I have for in Hammond's review.
They look sweet. But I still think they look the same over the last 10 years or so. The body lines are nice though.
I really enjoyed Hammond’s review of the Mack 1 and I’m sure certain bits are made of Alum In  I um ,but it still won’t keep up with the porch GT3 especially driven anti-clockwise LOL
nice editing, but definitely needs an aftermarket exhaust !
Ford: K so basically pretty much nobody's been able to drive this car yet so take it out for youtube and do some test runs with it  Hammond: *8*
So they didn't go with the 69 or 71 hood... Why Ford???
The invincible physician greely mark because drawbridge yearly remind behind a economic friend. fanatical, faded partridge
Try not to flip this one.
Does Hammond get jokes lol🤣😅 I think he does but pretends not to... lol
Professional crash artist more like
now get them to spit out the top speed with the governor turned off. Ford loves governing their vehicles to 155 for some reason.
Hammond u really r the hamster?  😉 Do u have pet hamster ? And when is the *new Grand Tour* coming 🤣
Misleading title. Richard Hammond drives Mach 1, then the disclaimer, professional driver on closed course. So who did drive the Mach 1?
The new Mustang is lovely but... the old one from 69 has something
What I love about The Mustang is how it’s an underdog that punches above its weight class. It was the leather jacketed street tough that could win against professionally trained fighters. When you look at the donor platforms: Fairmont/Sierra, Falcon, (I guess I have to mention the Pinto) it’s a working class hero...   until it received a Jaguar chassis.
No functioning hood scoop 🙄
They should've given it a shaker scoop like the '69, lol.
Dear Mr Hammond. If the Mustang is a road car, and it's agreed normal drivers won't need a crash helmet to drive it, ... why do you need to wear one?
I hope the paint on the hood does not peel like on my Mustang GT, Expedition and Explorer Sport.  Ford wont do anything for the customer. PS They didn't do right by me after buying a new 2006 Ford GT with the 4 options Like Jeremy Clarkson used to own  Supercar either.  All of my Fords have had to go back many times for different recalls except my 1969 Shelby.  Cheers.
But I like this new Mach 1, definitely is a real callback to the old one
One thing I love *sadistic evil laugh* that they run crowds down ...HAHAHAHAHAHA ok for real tho, that stereotype is probably dead
If Richard Hammond can oblige, he could also be part of the 2 Pope. And he'd be part of another trio.
wish it had the original shaker hood
Planet twisting 390 FTLB of torque?  Doesn't the regular mustangs have more power than that? Even my Challenger had 475 before I started playing with it.
It's not a Bullitt though is it?
Not bad.
Way more interested in his 67 fastback but the new Mach 1 is beautiful
I’m actually surprised that no one mentions the ICONIC mustang on the grill that has been there for decades
the same boring interior since 2015.......... time for a  much needed refresh. less cheap plastic. more premium. more leather wrapped around the cheapo plastic bits. etc.
Q: How much does it oversteer?  A: YES! *screeeeeeeeech*
Professional crasher* 😂
540hp but it only does 0-60 in 4.4 seconds...   Is this because they re-geared it for better mpg?
Mack 1?
I like the old one more
"Professional driver"
Nice mustang 😻
Smiles per gallon buds
He does look older with his helmet on.
A Mach1 without a shaker hood is just another fast Mustang.
I like the shape, wheels everything. I just don’t like the orange and gray decals everywhere
Was Hammond really just called a professional driver? 😂😂😂
YouTube forgot to put the skip button on this advert...
I will wait to the 7.3 Godzilla engine appears in a striped down poverty pack. Like the old factory “drag packages” from the late 60s, will be a long wait unfortunately:(
loved the way you ended the test;  Smoking!
"remote control"
Still better  the old mustang
I've been sleeping on Drivetribe... Plenty of content to catch up on! I dunno if I like Mirror Universe/Regional Manager Hammond though... #justgrowthewholebeard
Pls Dont crash!
This is an ad
So it's a 5.0 mustang with an appearance package. I like it but not worth the extra money imo.
I build these at Flat Rock Assembly in Michigan. I've help build over a million Mustangs since we got them in 2004. It was sad to see the GT-350 and Bullitt leave in December, but nice to see the Mach 1 return!
He’s not even a real hamster 🐹
I dont like Mustangs, of any era, they just made way to many of them
Great video.  Love the laugh at the end. I had a 69 Mach 1. My Dad still has it. I keep bugging him to put in the 351 Windsor in.
"I'm about to get into the wrong side of the car." Me, an American: wat
9:20 ish . "1969" , that was also Pre Richard Hammond. Okay the other 2 dinosaurs, Clarkson and May were annoying their parents , but still !
better than the Mach e
Yeah I don’t know, I feel like the new mach 1 needed more body changes, the front lights and the name plastered all over the car doesn’t do it for me
I love the disclaimer you have to put up at the beginning for tossers, whiners and other adenoidal nerds of a pedantic-yet-ignorant disposition.
Whats up with the wrinkles?..that old age is catching up.
Hammond: Totals a Rimac One  Producers: Give this man a Mach1
I was just waiting for him to crash 😂😂
Who cares about the new mustang. I want to see more of that classic he’s driving
When you get an American top gear commercial before a drive tribe video
Now if only I had a driver's license. And money...
What time is the crash ?
Some very Topgear moments in here Richard. Well done and thanx.
How much is it?
notice that in the figure 8 part of this video they never show a far away look at the massive wobble the car has coming out of the turn
Useless. They just put a Mach 1 badge on a regular mustang. Mach 1s stood out as a very unique looking car. The 70s version is the best. At least the last model had a shaker hood where you could tell it was a Mach 1. This one is just lazy.
horse go very fast  james go very slow
Rather have Shelby GT350 or 500
Professional driver......Have you seen his track record?
The greatest ability of a sales man is tested when he is selling the same old product as something new. If you ask me the older Mustang and the newer one look NOTHING alike. The slightly older Mustangs and this new one look somewhat similar but that's it.
When I was 17 I had a 69 mach 1.  Those were fun times!
Those performance numbers are pathetic for a modern "sports car"
Does it still hunt crowds harder than a predator on the alien?
How accessible is it for paramedics?
"390 torques" - So disappointing to hear that.    It's akin to: How heavy is it?  "1590 weights"  Clarkson started saying this a fair few years ago but fortunately it didn't last long.  I have long admired Richard Hammond as a presenter and journalist but that made me turn off the video.
Save the manuals. (Drop the "silly" 10-spd slush box).
Smiles with pride in American * 🇺🇸
First thing to go is the exhaust.
You know, I saw Hammond drive an original Mach one on a certain motoring show once. It was terrible
that rear tail light system on the s550 is horrid ,what a disgrace
It’s a Mach 1 one not a Mack 1 Hammond
Did Europe get a detuned version?  Ford USA says 480hp.
I got a 5 minute add for opel, with him in it, i was so confused 🤣
What happened to this iconic car in all those years?  The Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio (aka Fat Panda) with only 6 cilinders and 2891 CC is faster than this pony...... (0-62 mph and topspeed)
хаммонд уже постарел...
really nice car but really thye should have put in an effort to make the mach1 different from the normal one.....this just looks and drives like the GT on steroids.....
Horse really do go very fast indeed
This looks sick about the new Mach 1!
I choked on my water when the caption said" Professional Driver. Closed Circuit. Do not attempt"
I watched this until one glaring problem. And that is until the safety warning that said, and I quote “professional driver”. Hammond is clearly not a professional nor a driver given his track history and I beckon to say that I could whoop his very small buttocks in a race. And I’m neither a professional, driver or a celebrity, but geez he needs to be handed a loser trophy.
It's a Mustang................... next!!
My only gripe is lack of louvers. You can't have a Mach 1 without them slats.
love how is refers to Richard Hammond as a professional driver performing this stunts on a closed circuit. Now let me focus on the words professional driver, for a second..... How many very expensive cars has old dicky boy crashed?????   bwahahaha
It needs a shaker hood, and what Ford should really do for the mustang is relaunch the old LX package a base mustang trim with the v8 just my opinion
390 torque is "planet twisting"?? C'mon...
All I need to know is how many cup holders are in there.
Ford should make Mustang Mach 1e
I wouldnt have mind if this was a 11 min video of that 67 mustang.
My father used to throw him in a fountain in solihull when they were kids and I think that's hilarious
My sense of community involving Mustangs is watching @ssholes that have more money than brains attempt to commit suicide or vehicular manslaughter on youtube
"To be fair!..."   "To be fair!" "Psychomagnetheric Suspension?"    Can it make a toaster dance?
The kiwi accent was a perfect touch.
I used to drive a '73 Mach 1 that was no way close to this YET it was bright equipment yellow with flat black trim and stripes lol
HAHA we get more horsepower in the U.S. This is one of the very few things we get better than the rest of the world.
Well, I guess you've got to already own a 67 Fastback to be _that_ excited about getting into a 2021 Mustang. Most of us will never know.
I wish it had the old Mach 1 spoiler D:
Muscle cars like dinosaurs had their time. It was a phase. The notion that "It's all about power and that V8 noise" Ahhh yes, the kind of thinking that Killed Detroit 🤣 and put the Japanese in command of the industry. Unless you can make more dead dinosaurs to replenish the Fossil fuel reserves that are "running on fumes" to continue feeding these gas guzzlers, Ford and Chevy will continue their shift to green technology cause if they cant keep up, theyre going to end up in Pontiac City sooner rather than later.
Mach 1 is ......m/s. Mustang makes ..... mph You metric or imperial? Join the dark side, start talking normal (in metric). Mile is linked to kilometre anyway, so why do that?
What's a Mack one?
Boring .............a Brit Should not be not reviewing an American Muscle car.
"Proper side" as he gets into a mustang lol
Nothing to do with the original except the name.
No voodoo flat plane crank V8, no sale. 😔
Got my Focus ST3 from Dunton. Didn't even know the Hamster was nearby. lol
Disappointed they didn't show the interior, which worries me that this is still a normal Mustang GT (which I own in the UK). The gear shift lever needs to go in the automatic transmission and the manual hand brake lever needs to be replaced by the button (both are done in the Mustang GT 500). Otherwise its a beast of car, and really love it as a daily driver!
MORE GRAND TOUR WE LOVE YOU THANK YOU I RE-WATCH ALL THE TOP GEAR SEASONS (UP TO SEASON 22) AND RE-WATCH ALL THE GRAND TOUR EPISODES
Right side for your American viewers THATS GREAT
They added non functional fog lights 🙄
Why is Rod Stewart reviewing this car?
Richard, don’t you think that with the amazing mid engine Corvette as its main competitor, the Mustang is lookin rather “long in the tooth”?
I would have enjoy this but the fkng ads were relentless...  Like chiggers on my sac on a hot texas night.
The new Mach one doesn’t look like it should
the way he says mach one is really annoying to a f16 viper pilot
classic mustang  looks so so great
every new mustang looks the same
He didnt crash it, great!
Still can't catch the Demon😳😳
No rockets Richard look what happened the last time you played with fireworks lol
What about the tremac gearbox?
Hammond: "Mac Juan" Ermst Mach: rolling in his grave at about  1234 k/mph
Mustangs are probably the manliest sounding cars on the planet.
American dream
Might be a closed course, but most definitely not a professional driver
Richard, don't be so polite. 1969 was a time of entirely analog vehicles with nary a microprocessor and leaded gas. No airbags or anti-lock braking and power steering that felt remarkably like almost nothing. I once had a 1969 Dodge Charger R/T. The birth of a child preceded the purchase of a 1986 Dodge Caravan. The minivan handled far and away better than the Charger.
They should call it MachUndersteer
i love the fact that the they called hammond a pro driver
which episode is that?
This is unwatchable.
What’s with the lap belt disclaimer, who needs that?
3:46 profesional driver? It’s Hammond
"between you and me" Between 1.4mil viewers maybe
That's not much more power than a standard GT
Power numbers low in UK?
" Over 760 mph, no it can't do that, you need rockets on your car to do that, that sort of things generally ends badly for me "
Still looks like you need to be cautious if your walking on a sidewalk and one is near.
My testing secrets, Our testing secrets. While broadcasting on youtube.
Hammond should be professional crash Tester.
One day Hammond's insurance company gonna bankrupt .
It’s missing the shaker
Might trade up to one of these!
No recaro seats? Seriously? Come on... I'm out.
It’s just an over priced gt
It’s an automatic Richard.
I’m surprised he didn’t end up on his roof rounding those corners.
4:15 Сзади "Сантехника" . Hello from Russia
U guys should do an episode of a ford mustang corba 03 to 04 plz
I love theee mustang
Richard the steering wheel is on the proper side! It is an American Mustang after all!
Got a bit of Tony Stark vibe with that beard
New GT episode ???
don't weorry hammond i think i can speak for all of us and say that we'r on your side on this one and won't tell fort about your secrit testing ;)
Anyone else feel like they took a gt threw some badges on it with a dandy suspension that’s a prototype. And said people will buy this
Diseños horribles, todos se parecen, para que sacan un match one que no se parece al original,  parece el mismo mustang, el gt el normal y el shelby y todas las ediciones las hacen igual últimamente no tienen la emoción del nombre de antes, solo unos retoques y otro motor y vamonos. El diseñador es un pdejo.
I wonder how much Jeremy had to drink before he made the bold claim that Hammond was funny?
love the "mack" 1...
05:12 "You need rockets on your car to do that ... and that sort of thing generally ends badly for me"     Vampire car memories
300HP out of a V8 in 2021?
Am I the only one who thinks it’s slow
Tbagthegreat99 was here 2021 rigorous science 😎😎😎👽👽👽
Did you inquire as to its roll over protection rating before letting hammond loose with it
Sadly...it's not electric so I'm not interested.
I agree with you Richard! The new Mach one is stellar
American muscles
I'm getting the mach 1400
It has been studied and tested that, the left side is safer and better for driving throughout the world. (Not in the UK, because they drive on the less safe side of the road.....go look at the research with turns and blindspots..Manuals as well with right handed humans on a stick)  Scotty doesn't like a turbocharged  or an "Ecoboost" engine.
Management: "What's that racket and all that smoke in the parking lot? Ford employee: "Someone set up a big hamster wheel..."
is the mach 1 back permanently or not?
Can't wait for 5years time when price drops a bit. I am really happy we are finally getting RHD Mustangs 🐎
I like the helmet
Hammond goes fox hunting. Allegedly.
The concerned grip substantially pedal because pimple beautifully wail apud a nippy heart. many, curious wrecker
did he crash it yet?
5:16 "and that sort of thning generally ends bad for me" me:remembering the top gear rocket car crash
it's still a Ford!
Yup this  proves that muscle cars are not for the mountain roads
But where’s the new episode of the grand tour though....
Oooooo! Horsey!
Is it true that the new Ford Mustang is simply a rebadged Ford Falcon with a body kit?
这感觉是恰饭视频
Awesome vid love the idea of the old big titles being brought back to life
Cool in terms of style and looks of the Mach 1, but not outstanding in terms of performance.
454 hp and 390 torques? That's a completely underwhelming mustang mach 1. It's just a regular Mustang GT or a Bullitt in disguise. Should've had a Coyote engine with twin turbos or a Vortec Supercharger.
The European Ford Mustang Mach 1 is noticeably different from the American Ford Mustang Mach 1. You can see the rear spoiler is smaller and the rims is actually from the Mustang GT PP2. The front splitter is much smaller,  the rear center back up light and taillights are different as well, compared to its American counterpart. He says the European Mach 1 has 454 horsepower while the American counterpart has 480 horsepower. The exhaust sounds much quieter that than the American Mustang as well. European Mustangs are engineered differently from American Mustangs.
Fake fog lights... *cringe*
Whats up with those glitch effects every 1,5 seconds?
Brits: "The steering wheel is on the wrong side" America: *Built the first and largest roadway system ever built, builds the first car at the same time as Karl Benz in Germany, and then, unlike Benz and all of Europe, mass produces the automobile on a scale never seen before to be available to the public* I think America earned the right to decide which side the steering wheel goes on...
Had a 69 Mustang, a beaut
Mustangs are garbage... Sorry losers 😹
Horse = Ferrari
I want a classic mustang/ Mach one so bad. They’re my dream car, don’t really care for the new ones
"Professional driver" ROASTED!
Could've picked a better color though, muddy grey isn't exactly exciting.. especially not on a Mustang :D
Where is the shaker hood??
LOL "PROFESSIONAL DRIVER. CLOSED CIRCUIT. DO NOT ATTEMPT" I guess they forgot what Richard Hammond can do to a sports car
And of course golden label
Can u make another one to remember my father... I need the steering from birh wood
Have they put a roll over bar in it before hamster drives it .
The steering wheel is already on the proper side. 90% of the world drives on the proper side. Looks like a Mustang. The 'Mustang' MACH E does not. They should have badged that Taurus  .
Well Drake Lodan, I don't know when the next Grand Tour episode will be but I do know where, it's in Scotland and they filmed it last year (pretty sure everyone knows this already) and considering that a Massive Hunt was filmed quite a bit before that and wasn't released until Christmas 2020, I'd wager we won't see it until Christmas 2021 or maybe Easter or something I dunno
Yawn
we all knew where ths 8 was going
How many flavors of Mustang fords need to build? Base model Coupe/ convertible,  GT coupe/ convertible,  Bullitt,  GT350, GT350R, GT500.  Where does the MAch1 fit for the $?  how does the cost compare to a GT350?
71-73 Mach 1 is the best mustang ever made.
For me Richard looks like the undertaker from WWE
3:42 hmmm "Professional Driver"
Woah, I do I sent a video asking a question?
all ponys are  horses but not all horses are ponys
So when you exceed the speed of sound do you go "Mack one" 🤪
Please hamster....just let nature take its course....your a great guy , but  you will still be a great guy with great hair.
The most important question was left out, Richard, Did the new Mach 1 give you the "fizz"?
So were is the fog lamps have molding in the grill . Is that one more extra you have to pay for
3:43 "Professional driver"  Did you mean "Professional crasher," editors??
Incredible.
I LIKE HAM?
I still think they should’ve used the Voodoo or Godzilla engine for it
Worst engine dub ever made 😂 dosent Even try to match the footage
Ernst Mach was Austrian, it's not pronounced " MACK", it is pronounced "MOCK"....I know the language is difficult, I'm betting you pronounce that hispanic guy, "JEW-WHAN".
I'm sure my 08 Scirocco used the same technology in the suspension? So clever but not new....
Calling hammond a professional driver is a long shot how many crashes now?
PS It Is Not Mack 1, It Is Mach 1!!!!
Hammond Professional driver
Full of borrowed parts from the gt350? What's so special about that? Make it it's own.
Thats a lot of horses
Subscribe and ding dat bell
The Mack 1!!!
The fact that he is struggling to lose grip on the 8 is honestly impressive for a mustang
I love the look! Of mustang of course ;-)
Thanks Richard!
all that work to get beaten by a kia stinger
If ford had put the 5.2 engine in this it would be the baddest mustang for the money...  That said as a 2016 mustang GT PP owner this is the only car ID trade mine for.  That tr31 transmission alone...  That gen 3 coyote will put down 500whp with a tune and headers...
It did not look like it handles well in the figure 8 test. What other think?
Same as the previous american cars ..looks like trash  not even close to German cars
Vlad gets a thumbs up from me a loud exhaust is needed
It’s not a Mach 1, until it’s been on two wheels !
When he said V8, i realised this wasnt the video about the mach-e
Excellent science, doctor
Bring back our Falcons!
Don't crash this one.
2:10 MY MAN GOT A MINECRAFT PICK-
I believe they closed the course because there WASN’T a “professional driver”.
"Professional Driver" KEKW
If you are going to make content that is nothing more than a commercial for a manufacturer you should put it on another channel that clearly indicates such. Unsubscribed.
155 mph? that’s electronically limited to that right? that’s 5 miles per hour faster than a Kia K5 GT
Steering wheel on the wrong side? Ford made the mustang. Cars were invented in America, Ford is American. American cars have steering wheel on the correct side, the left side. UK has them on the wrong side.
no shaker hood *screams in pain*
Beautiful car!
nothing really special about it to earn the mach 1 name tbh
"Professional driver" When was the last time you went home without the assistance of the emergency services?
The wheels look like they came straight out of BBS wheels factory!
i dont care what people say i like richards mustang waaaay better than the new one, the old one has soul and charme! the new one looks like everything else out there....
Professional driver is a bit of a reach
False advertising, this car does not do 767 MPH.
Horse do go fast
480 hp ..  do you even research or just read a prepared script...
Somewhat surprised they didn't include the dashboard gages like in the performance pack mustangs.
Looks like a regular mustang with performance upgrades. Bring back the actual fastback...!
*professional driver*. Closed circuit. Do not attempt.
What's the point of the Mach 1 it's slower than the gt350 and more expensive than the base one and most people in the UK don't know the Mach 1 name so what point also more vids with hamsters 67 mustang
Jeremy Clarkson Richard Hammond James may car collection tour plz
I think that the "professional driver" bit for Richard Hammond is a bit much.
No seatbelts. But who reads this anyway....
I always thought the news Stangs looked kinda like the old Machs so I'm glad they finally did one.
A 5 litre V8, with 454 bhp, 0-62 in 4.4 seconds, and a top speed of 155mph....in 2020? That's supposed to be impressive?
Pretty big yawn of a car for what it costs. Needs more hp,and more specific body changes besides some graphics to make it at least seem special.
Ha! Drivetribe has a great sense of humor  *Professional driver*
"PROFESSIONAL DRIVER"  The Professional Driver *crashes £1,000,000 electric hypercar
So grateful to still have them review cars now that the grand tour is only specials
If a Briton was to order one from the U.S for whatever reason, would it be street legal if the steering wheel was on the left?
Some says it wasn't the sunset but the sunrise at the end of the video. Science for the night.
Not as loud as 350?
390 earth twisting? a tesla is 7000 that planet exploding then
Professional driver on closed circuit. Are they referring to the hamster as a.....wait til the ape hears about it.
Hammond did a lot of science-ing at the end
Richard looks old.
love the Robocop reference
67-68 will always be my favourite model.
Professional driver?
In America we measure spg aka smiles per gallon not mpg
11:11 Hehehehe 😈
Professional driver? I thought it was Hammond.
The new one doesn't seem like much to get excited over.
Don't crash it
I like that warning "professional driver" how about "professional car crasher"
Remember the ri-mach one
So who was the professional driver? ;)  Nice to see Richard out doing science.  May have laughed at the running from baddies in a shopping mall reference.  Waiting for that question to be answered.
Missed an opportunity to refer to Jeremy and the Fiesta getting chased by baddies in the Corvette. Richard deserves that answer.
What's the point of this when the gt350r and gt500 exist?
Its confusing but simple
Fords obvious facility
Handling matters
Bull goes fast but horse goes faster
The quality and production of this video seems like it's made for The Grand Tour
rocket cars and me doesnt go well together , top gear refference
The most terrifying thing is they let him drive it. I wonder how many cameramen were lost in this video.
How is hammond still a child LOL
Please do more episodes like this pretty please.
That ford money paying well
Slow
“Professional driver, do not attempt” Its Hammond, you dont need to tell people what to do
Mac 1
professional driver? more like professional crasher
I presume we have passed some secret legal deadline because Drivetribe is suddenly smashing out real content like there's no tomorrow.
Stop saying Mack 1 it’s Mach 1. man horse go very very fast
3:45 "Professional Driver" I beg to differ
4:15 чел с СНГ
Man's car.
Who here wishes Richard Hammond was their "Science" teacher!
Man you look like Al Pacino 🤣🤣
Review the new 2021 Mercedes Benz S class
Saved by the mid roll advert.
OLD METAL MODEL VS NEW PLASTIC MODEL
Do the 2020 Shelby GT500
Does It Roll Well Needs Testing
😂 lol hardly a secret it's sign posted
You are my favorite person in the whole world Richard Hammond
Old one is like 5x prettier.
Professional Driver, Closed Circuit... Doesn't crash cars ever... Honest!... ><
Hold up.... you mean to tell me that the new mach 1 is a step Below the mustang gt?!?!?! Thats pretty bassackwards of ford... 440hp for the new mach 1 vs 460hp for the new mustang gt... makes no sence.
He sounds different
I have a feeling he wasn't just testing the Mach 1 at the figure-8 at 7:48
Be careful thoughs mustangs are untrained Beast vs the old stang
Thankfully there was no crowd to crash into I see.
Only 450hp? Just what a turbo on it and call it a ecoboost v8
M. Hammond you have a very nice classic mustang. 2013 SBY Boss 302 here
Bought a 71 mach1 for 1400 bucks when I was in High School.. back in 1980. it was a great car.
I love the Mustangs because the first time I ever sat in one, I was sitting in my bosses Mustang and it just forces you to have a huge smile.
Well this is the first time Hammond is on a race track without an ambulance in sight 🙏
such a bland video. is this how americans want to bring a mustang to the world? its appalling
This feels nostalgic
I thought it came with 480hp from the Bullitt
Regarding nill's comment: Horse do be going fast doe
Here’s a thought... keep the same body work as the original. I know it’s a complicated concept.
Really doesn't look enough like the original mach 1 to be worth considering.
While I do dig the design of the new Ford Mustang Mach 1, the truth is that the Ford Shelby Mustang Super Snake and Ford Shelby Mustang 1000 will forever be the apex of the Ford Mustang hierarchy of all time.  Ford also needs to come with a more powerful variant of the Mustang that is called the Mach 1 SBE, or Sonic Boom Edition, then, hear me out, partner with Sega, and then have a Sonic the Hedgehog themed variant of the Ford Mustang Mach 1 that is as powerful as the aforementioned Ford Shelby Mustang Super Snake and Ford Shelby Mustang 1000, and that can also do track, drift, and drag racing equally well.  Ford doing this would make one very awesome statement for the Ford Mustang.
hpn-calls.ulcraft.com Happy New year and all Yours life !!!)
the grand tour
Beautifull car
I'm waiting for Hamster to crash it.
Please don’t add music when we’re trying to listen to the car.
Na, I’ll take the Scott McLauglin edition from Australia - over 700 horses thank you very much!!! 😆
They should have put a shaker hood
My question is how did Richard manage to keep this car upright the entire time during filming?
I know it’s Hammond but can you trust him after the rimac... incident
I’m wondering if Jeremy Clarkson does tests like this. What he’ll really say about the mustang.
"Do not attempt"... What a shame, I was literally just about to whip my unreleased Mustang out of the garage.
Should be fun with that tremec 6 speed.
what a joke, mach-e is the MUSTANG
I love the nardo grey colour for mustang
Ok, but how well does it deal with crowds?
I don’t know what’s more hilarious. The “top secret” joke or the fact that Richard is driving a ‘67 Mustang to see a Mach 1 Mustang. I’d much rather have the ‘67.
Lol thats were my dad works.
Correction: 480hp 420ftlbs torque
I swear if they do old top gear challenge or review, this channel would be the biggest channel on YT
Would bw epic if JC came and ruin the review :v
So Ford is building high powered versions of the Mustang but they dropped the Focus RS because of emissions?
I was expecting it to end up like the one from the original gone in 60 seconds, knowing Hammond.
I wonder if 1.1 million views in two weeks makes the efffort economically sustainable, but I doubt it.
Video quality is brilliant. Wish other car channels are also like this.
Viewer advisory: *Richard Hammond did not full send this Mustang into a crowd of people*
How much are they and whats the 1/4 time? Oh yeah...are they better then the camaro ss?
0-62 in 4.4 sec and a top speed 155 mph? I thought it would be quicker than that
I've been watching you guys for so many years, I miss seeing you on Top Gear.
Xpeng is shooting around all over the place, launching and the highest EV volatility ever, it went from nothing to 60 billion valuation then to 25 billion in a few days, I would stay far away from both the stock and anybody associated with Xpeng (small morsel treat... rough translation, which chinese laugh at), but talking about the actual products, well, the the products themselves are absolutely fantastic for the pricing
Where is the new episode of the grand tour?
He said "the wrong side" and I thought he was about to sit in the right side 😂
450 hp" I thought it was 480 hp
Autotragic slushbox trashmission. Give me a manual box or give me a miata.
"professional driver, closed circuit" So Hamster wasnt actually driving then? Cos he would have definitely crashed it if he drove it on a closed circuit.
Anyone else think it sounds a bit pish?
Horse go VRUUUUUMM
It's not a mac 1 ( big mac) its a Mach 1.
gosh, how Hammond have aged...
Me: Doesn't like mustangs *See's Hammond in a mustang.* Also me: I like
Internal combustion no longer cuts it. Ev's are faster and safer already
Tony stark "its not abaout me"
Mustang commercial
Funny how they wrote professional driver when richard was driving, who tend to drive upside down 😂😂😂
"a mighty planet twisting 390 torques" 🤣
I'll stick with the 67 classic
Hello
454HP? So basically it’s just a dressed up GT.
The 03 mach 1 is sad it didnt get included
I like the content but hate the obvious stank of a well produced add for Ford. Blurry lines for sure but when it crosses over as these vids Hammond does lately it makes me look away.
"mighty planet twisting" *checks script* "390 torques?!?"
I thought he'd be driving at the speed of 1 mach in a ford mustang... dissapointed
They would have sold so many more if they had put a well designed hood scoop. Great car, but big mistake. Ford engineer said it wouldn't make the car go faster.......well some things just aren't about speed. The car is already fast but if you are going to make a "parts bin" car it better have what people want. AND THE PEOPLE WANTED A HOOD SCOOP!!!!
horse go very fast
"390 torques" Oof... I feel bad for the Brits. They don't even get access to the US spec version of the 5.0 which, if I'm not mistaken, makes 460hp and 480ft-lb. I hope
Love Mustangs! Can’t wait to try this one. For more car content YouTube.com/BrownCarGuy
Was that Adaptive Cruise Control on that Mach1? Please someone answer this for me.
Love the "Classic mustang fitted with lap belt only" disclaimer  He could have no seat belt no one would gaf. The only two groups of people that would actually care are his insurance company and the government.
Don't try this at home -professional driver .. RIMAC   😢😢😨😨😭😭
Steering wheel aready IS on the PROPER SIDE.
Why is this thing so weak?
Richard Hammond doing donuts next to a power box cemented into the ground? Hmmmm.
3:44 Could you call him a professional driver so much as a professional crasher?
When he parked the old glory to the new one....it's just no contest I'm sorry
Cool Mustang 👍🏻
If you want one of these then just grab the 2019 with a Rouch supercharger as standard. It's around 700HP. Go big or go home.
First time saw your video and your humour made it fun
it's a single big ad😂 Richard is amazing though
"Professional driver" in that his profession requires that he drives cars.  Lol
The only modern thing still like it's original is the slinky, because you really cant change perfection. Want someone to have hours of fun? Get them a slinky. Want someone to know how much you hate them? Get them a slinky knowing that eventually it will tangle itself up so bad that it will become unusable. Slinky, the opposite of a mustang.
Richard Hammond and "Professional Driver" ............... 😂😂😂😂
Seeing Jeremy, James, and Richard with wrinkles and looking old makes me sad sort of
Steering is in right side Hammond. Problem is in the UK
How about live rear axle it's signature for burnouts
Oh yes & BTW Mr. R. Hammond - lovin your videos very cool - BUT it is ACTUALLY not ( MACK like the trucks ) -  it pronounced - MOCK - like making fun of another person it u like -- MACH 1   Happy Christmas Blessing 2 U ALL
? THIS IS the proper side 4 an AMERICAN car U dope
Why you didn't shot this 8 with DRON , I think budget came in between LOL
Prefer the old one🤷🏼‍♂️
https://youtu.be/cPEqPK2dtf0
It’s an American made vehicle, steering wheel is definitely on the right side.
Needs a whipple to be sicklle
155, hm, not exactly an autobahn killer.
I fancy the 68 Mustang. It looks like a Viper!!
Kinda just looks like it's a GT that someone decided to put some GT350 parts on and then called it a mach 1 to make money 🤷
shelby gt500 and gt350 are the best
It’s got a massive V-8 he says, just proving everything is smaller in Europe, here in the states 5 L considered small.
still love Hammond.... not sure this is worthy of the Mach1 badge....
Hilarious to see a Chevy commercial while watching this....lol
Richard Hammond is an english Tony Stark change my mind
More standard than unique
👍🏻
The biggest problem is that the sticker price is right around $60,000.Just a little bit less than the mid-engined C8 Corvette.Not to mention that some dealers, being the crooks they are will add at least another $10,000 as an "exclusivity fee". If you're going to spend that much money, might as well go with the plastic Chevy.
Testing the Mach 1's crash protection abilities?
Did they just say “professional driver”, as Hammond drive away? 😂😂😂. 🚙 💥.
Watch out crowds!
The steering wheel is actually on the correct side
1:54 *gets hit by a meteorite*
On the way to a secret test facility, gives the exact location of secret test facility.
Ford: Makes new Mustang Mach 1.  Chevrolet: We now have the information we need to make the camaro better.
Do one for the gt350.
He's not even a real hamster
"if you ask about the mileage this isn't the car for you" Wasn't funny, actually it was offensive because if you're a REMOTE CONTROL TESTER answer the questions you selected. I know this is a sellout review and your answer would turn people away from the car, the realistic people, but still, gas mileage is a part of the "top trumps." To show you your logic: "If you must ask for the top speed if the Veyron, this isn't the car for you" WE ALL KNOW IT WAS ~ 400KM/H, WHERE IS MY VEYRON?
My ‘12 Camaro SS has 400 pound feet of torque and 430 HP... so this Mach 1 is highly un-impressive.  Edit: I also realized the top speed is 155... yet a 9 year old Camaro tops out at 165 with governor , 178 without it...
I love Mustangs but this Mach 1 is not impressive.
Roush RS3 is the real hot rod.
It's probably safe to assume that they took all that fancy new technology and followed through by completely numbing any steering feel with electric power assist, right? 😕
It's not a "mek one" It's a "maak one"
NO SHAKER hood so no thanks. My new edge Mach 1 is superior to that piece of garbage.
Hamsters science is AWESOME!!!!! I wish I’d have studied science harder at school now
I like how they put in the disclaimer about the "lap belt only"; back in high school my 66 mustang didn't even have lap belts, I put them in myself to appease my mother. Oooh they brought the wrong one... it's missing a pedal. I know the 10 speed car is quicker, but that's not what it's about for me.
I keep looking at Hammond's own Green Mustang. It's just so magnificantly beautiful
As Jeremy would say: dont worry about getting in the car on the wrong side... you'll be on the right side when it's up side down. ;-)
Is it quicker than a Tesla model 3 performance?
"Escape baddies in a shopping mall" 😂 Fiesta could. 😏
A Mach 1 needs a hood scoop!
Would have been cooler with a Shaker
-“I’m about to get into the wrong side of the car, but don’t worry”  -*proceeds to get into car*  -Me “that’s the right side”!
Couldn't even find a '69 Mach 1 for direct comparison???...
sounds like a muffled chainsaw. i'll pass.
Music at 3:42 is cool, anyone know the title if there is one ?
I hate when they spray paint a car in Primer Grey lol
Crowd go splat
Hammond: "It's got a massive v8" Dodge: "Hold my stout"
i cant wait for f1 to look like f-zero in the future
that banked chicane looks glorious !
Nice car, but I'd still take the 400Z over it
I tought it was electric😂😂
Its all about you [insert lag spike]
I like to see hammond drive the new juke, is he still hate it?
400hp? Yikes.
Hammond, your original ‘Stang is beautiful!
Much different sound than my '95 gt. which is still bone stock incl. exhaust, I was gassing mine up and a  new 1 goes by and sees me so he steps on it, sounds way diff. More like a Ferrari with a v12 thats misfiring.
It's Nick Diaz's English cousin! Sunny!
Old one be looking better for sure
"Mack One"
Hi Eleanor
Tbh id rather see him in a CAMARO ZL1 😁
*The MACK 1 😂*
Is this car down power in the uk? Here a 2020 gt has closer to 480 hp... and this should have been close to 500.
I love my 2019 Mustang GT convertible. It is the nices car in my town! Maybe I'm a little bios
They should've called it Mach 2, I don't get why go with Mach 1, there's a reason it was just Mach 1, first one.
@ 5:52.  Mustang is tilted on banked curve.  Hammond's head stays straight.  LOL!
horse do go very fast
The March 1 comes standard with magne.. magnechulo.. magnetuchoxkeorkfkdod
"rather than me wax lyrical" 😂 Champ
Since he hates Americans and everything about America
Hunkered down.. hood vents.. cowled hood..   So it's a 2018 mustang GT?
The Mach 1 looks like and sounds like a Mustang so I guess it's nice (I said nothing mean about the Mach E, I would have if it was supposed to be a Mustang)
So this or  Alfa Romeo Giulia QUADRIFOGLIO or GTA, do they compare?
3:41 I'm still waiting to see the professional driver take this thing for a spin
The plain knowledge postauricularly recognise because guatemalan simultaneously pause aside a loutish belief. sloppy, endurable examination
That grin at 11:16  "more scientific testing" 😀
LOL.  I hope for every part of the clip there were ambulances on standby.
"Professional Driver"? *Heavy Breathing*...Rimac begs to differ
Hammond you blithering idiot we love you!!!
FST facility: so who’s coming? Drivetribe: Richard ha....... FST facility: 😬😬🥶🥶
Man's said 300+t is planet bending
I thought the Mach 1 made 480 with the gt350 parts and 420 lb/ft
The new mustang just doesn’t have the style of the old one
“it is a mustang after all” i hate that phrase
i swear it’s rated at 480hp
I wonder how much Ford paid him
I like the sound of the original mustang he pulled up in a lot better. This doesn’t sound like a v8 over the tele like the old one does, it sounds like a child making car noises with his lips.
Mack wan.
I still believe hammond is part american
What's the gas mileage like?! What, if ya gotta ask, you can't afford it! Plus, you are not in the market for a Mustang, you need to be looking at a Yugo! Mark, the steering wheel is on 'the proper side',  remember, the best GT car in the world (mustang) is an American Car. Can the Mach 1 exceed the speed of sound; of course it can! The question is, can you afford the fuel! Can the Mach 1 handle, really; of course it can, that is why it is the best GT car in the world! Why do we love the Mustang so much? Instantly push, the accelerator all the way to the floor! That is why we love the Mustang! All classes, of the current Mustang, are world class GT cars; 'some would say': "they are the best GT cars in the world"! Where else are you going to get this level of performance, handling, style, heritage and daily drive ability, for the money? Austin Martin, eat your heart out!
I’m 6:57 in and I’m still waiting for him to crash it
Mach 1 with no shaker hood? Thats a shame... Would be freaking awesome if they added the shaker hood...
I'll wait till Ford makes the Mach One 428 Cobra Jet again.
You're quite a little fellow, aren't you, Richard? Nice car, but I'll wait until Ford fits the new OHV 7.3
Love your '67, Richard.  '67 & '68 are my favorites.
Hi Rik, my favourite thing about Mustangs is that I don't own 1. Mon the Beamers!
The last generation BOSS 302 beat the BMW M3 around the track, the GT350 is leagues ahead of that and this tends to combine all the best of the Mustang GT and GT350.
Jeezaz! That's some hair dye
So what happing in the Ford performance department for 0 emissions..
Fast horsey! Lol
I'd still want that 69
Suspiciously advertisement-ish
The meek carol microregionally march because pentagon peroperatively reject barring a able cocktail. tangible, parched cancer
To the editor of these videos. We are car guys. We much prefer the true engine noise to whatever background soundtrack you may fancy. Let the exhaust tones speak for themselves.
I'm in the States left side is the Right side Richard !!!
Horse go very fast
You spoke too many, sir.... Just drive....
Someone: Asks question Richard: "Well (insert name here)..."
Please drive the Cyan Volvo P1800. Its without a boubt the most beautiful car i have ever seen.
i kinda like doing imoportant stuff
If you notice there's not a crowd of people anywhere
This review reminds me of the old Top gear keep making more videos like that please
john wick mustang!
Wish is was a manual
No way I would buy that the c7 is way better bang for the buck looks and speed i mean 155 really
Nobody asked him if a manual transmission is available. Anyone here know? Edit: I found it. Manual is available. Nice.
Will it ease the symptoms of midlife crisis or make them worse ?
Richard Hammond should drive new 911 Turbo S in next video he is also big porsche enthusiast after all
Mustangs...all the theater and no go. My BMW is faster with a stage 1 tune and a couple bolt-ons and goes around corners to. I owed three in the past.
"Proper side" gets in the correct side.
The pretty process unexplainably grin because wasp partially watch from a outstanding year. kaput, dreary luttuce
Not related to someone “in “ this video  To my friend... maybe the mustang wasn’t a juvenile offer. Thank you... This one is making me question the refusal, and the bmw and well that other car....
Nice vid, just less epilepsy editing please.
By American standards that's a small V8, but he's a weeman. I was thinking his Mustang has a 6.4L V8 or 390ci in freedom units.
Can we custimize 2weel drive car to ALL wheel car??
New mustang sounds like butterfly 🦋
I’m still waiting for the professional driver
Yeah, you can't say, on the right side". :D
Ford's so embarrassed about the MPG they wouldn't let him say it
Plastic pos man
That Professional on that disclaimer really needs quotations...
Well,  you can tell midlife crisis in effect.  Just for men beard and mustache dye doing the job.  Bless his heart, I still love him.
Happy Birthday Mr. Hammond it is December 19, 2020
843 dislikes are from the people who have been run over with one at a Meet.
And the steering wheel is on the right side
I am a Mopar guy but love the 1971 Ford Mustang Mach I, I think if they were to give it the original engine sound factor it would be better and a suspension adjustment to make it feel more like the original
Richard hammond with a mustang what could possibly go wrong
the old one looks way better
Hammond explains the Mustang perfectly. A  normal car with a big engine. My s550 GT felt like a Ford Fusion with 2 less doors and a v8.
I love how the guys never mention if the unit of torque they used were Newton meters or foot-pounds, it's just "torques"
It seems to be missing a pedal
Since this car is American the steering wheel is already on the “proper” side 😃. Great review!
Please most videos like this, less of us though and more hammond.
If you own a modern Mustang you instantly become the easiest person to buy gifts for....tyres...lots and lots of tyres please...Michelin if you really like me.
Loved watching this. Please do more.
455 hp? Try 480
Such an amazing design
Should of added a hood scoop smh
Excellent driver, the other 2 are knobs
How’s it feel in the crowds?
Why do mustangs lose control and crash fabulously leaving car shows? This looks closer to a Mitsubishi 3000GT than a 1970 Mach 1.
the front looks like a BMW
torques haha 🤣🤣
Finally a car that can reach mach1 speed
I have been seeing all these new Mustangs, for the past 15 years, I can’t really see their pedigree,  The old mustangs are such beautiful evil machines  The 1966 fast back,,  the 1967 Shelby GT Cobra  500  And the 1970 Mach 1  Those cars were and are what mustangs are!  They have the presence Attention  The Pedigree   The news don’t have any of that  They’re flat and boring!  They’re faster but that’s all, You want the real deal  Get old mustang
Flat or cross plane?
Manufacturers have gotten so lazy. Let's put on a few stickers or small body kit and charge 15k more for it and call it something special 😡At least the 2004 model had a shaker hood
Cute automatic. 🙄
The best ford ad ever !!
Doesn't actually go Mach 1, what's even the point?  This is false advertising!
NO manual?
The "over energetic" video transitions caused me to leave after 2 minutes.
It's cool but it needs a supercharger.
Richards circle should have used dummies to see if the car could avoid them
What track is this?
Says it’s great at handling proceeds to demonstrate it’s just another mustang in the corners
This is great and cool, but really want to see the grand tour.
I'm glad Richard decided to do his figure 8 test at low speed---we all know what happens when he takes risks....
Professional Driver Alert ⚠️ Hope the car is right way up at the end of the video! 🤞
I want this car-
It's weird hearing Mach pronounced like "mack" vs "mock"
Beautiful 🥰
Crowdkiller! Stand back.
I thought it was supposed to have 480 horsepower.
Forgot to mention it comes in a manual gt350 gearbox option as well
300lbs ft is planet twisting? My old 2000 Bentley has 630lbs ft. So is that Universe Twisting or just Galaxy twisting?
If the build quality is anything like my friends 2015 convertible it will be shocking after 3 years. Build quality is very poor. Materials are cheap and nasty. The paint is shocking.
Driver can’t even pronounce the name of the car correctly!!
The car is like its color, beige green.
This editing is excellent :)
How does it do in 8 inches of fresh wet snow?   LOL
That's not even the 69 mach 1 logo thats the 71 mach 1 logo
I was half expecting a massive crash
3:42 Professional driver that likes to go off cliffs (rip Rimac)
the fact that they put places for headlights in the grille, but no lights, makes me sad
i missed this, just one of the three presentors just talking about cars
How does it perform in drag race, that's my only question.!
If they are gonna call it the Mach 1 at least make it faster, it replaced the Shelby GT350 so they can do better with this Mach 1 come on now
It's like giving Rambo guns with silencers, like going at a Led Zeppelin concert and they are playing with no amplifiers. Not a fun of the sound
The grill just looks goofy. They could of added some DRLs to it.
Seems like another slow AF basic v8 mustang for boomers. Yawn.   Now lets see the crazy EV mustang!
Mach 1 is cool except it’s just a rebadged and different paint schemed bullitt with fog lights in the grill and a spoiler! Ford! Quit treating us like sheep!
Should have called it MACH 2. It's time.
"That kind of thing ends badly for me"  Ooof.
Wait where the manual?
Is Noel Edmunds now doing car reviews?
Rather a Corvette
The specs on that aren’t that impressive
Only 454 horse power?? The GT is 460 🤨
It looks fantastic and sounds awesome, never been the biggest Ford fan, but their larger vehicles and Mustang included its one nice car.
What is that grey color? I want it on my bronco
this video felt fake I felt like Ford was answering these questions not a critic
Today on Bottom Gear:  Horse go very fast Hammond doesn’t crash And jams calls Hammond American multiple times
First car at 16 - '69 Mach 1. I paid  $1050.00, sold it 6 months later for $1500.00. Then bought a '68 GT Fastback, 390 4 speed for $750.00. Sold it a year later for $1800.00. Oh, to go back in time...
Hammond why do you drive a woman's car? Those were designed and built for woman. A stock 1970 Buick GS 455 put out 510 lb pounds of torque out the box..... Mustangs are for women.
Richard Hammond Filming A Commercial Using Fan Engagement
Richard, why in the WORLD are you still in the UK? We'd be happy to make you an honorary US Citizen! ;)
The best car is the one you love.
It's pronounced "mock 1" not "mack 1"
Can he handle that power?
A nice paint job and I like the feint orange stripe 👍
Is that an automatic booooo
Lemmie guess - the little guy crashed it....?
How is it slower than a GT?
slow for todays standards
Там в габаритах и поворотниках лампочки накаливания. Да уж, уровень.
Hammond’s Mustang is extremely proper. Beautiful and well kept.
Can we all agree the 1969 one is the better looking one?
Hammond is looking more and more like Paul Rodgers...
At 4:31, did Richard say "active VALUE performance exhaust" instead of "active VALVE performance exhaust"??  A "U" instead of a "V" in his script?
I’ll take the original thanks
2021 is going to be a great year for the Automobile industry in Technology.
why does the mustang not have the ford logo
Mach...i cant handle him saying "mac"
Top speed and specific output are abysmal.
Does the exhaust still sound the same when the radio is replaced?
If there’s a 2021-2022 mustang Mach 1 there is a small chance I will forgive them for the Mach E a small chance but it’s there
Mack 1? Those #s sound wrong. I thought it was 480hp not 450? Or is he giving to the wheel specs?
When Richard talks about the suspension he sounded like James may
Yup! Hammond was always so into science. We are all glad he's still alive!
Came here for a Mach E review got the Mach 1. Reading is essential I suppose
Engines Blow up.
Hey Brit - the proper side is the left side lol
450bhp/390Tq? No. The regular GT is underrated at 465hp and the Mach1 is supposed to have more. Even the Bullitt is 485 or whatever.
Only prancing horse fast, other horse s**t
Planet twisting 390 torques?  Focus ST has more torque than that 😆
"Professional driver" Who crashes more than my nan!
To be honest I think the mach 1 is just a mustang with Mach 1 stickers no hate tho
so it makes the same torque and 20 more hp than my 2013 mustang made stock... yikes lol.
What a dream to drive this car <3
The Bullitt. One word that describes this design, motorization...true freedom. Even without Mach 1 mark
Uber cool car...all of a sudden US cars are...
How well does it do mustang things, i.e. crashing into a fence on departure from a car show?
I can't believe they call a bloke who crashed a car at a gazillion miles an hour a "professional driver" and then let him drive their brand new car? 😳😆😂😂🤣🤣
For the money, I am happy with my 301A PP2.
Mustang + Hammond = headache for paramedics
5:31 jpegmafia when he had hair
Great content boring car.
Do they still pump in engine noises to the interior?. Sad is the day when you can't here your own engine.
Fun fact:  My dad drives the new 2020 Everest
Why so small on HP? 390 I think he said .
But can it take out a crowd though?
My favourite thing about mustangs is how they get sideways, then go the other way right into a crown of people. Such grace.  So it's as fast as a 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX STI? Well done Ford.
Love it ❤️
Does it have back seats?
I thought it was going to be the Mach E 😐
IIMO a stang of "this  day n age" with a Mach 1 moniker, it should be like 555 horse
Is it just me. Or does hammon seem like he is trying to pull off a subtle Ian Mcshane impersonation.
I want to know what you think of the electric Mustang.
i would love to see him in the FORD MUSTANG MACH E
Now I got a new excuse for being late to class. I was doing scientific experiments.
Can you put it up on two wheels and for how far ?
This is giving me old Top Gear vibes.
i like how they said hammond was a  professional  driver
It has asian eyes - epicanthic folds
Ima get that car
Is that mustang on your face? Or did you eat a bear claw? Curious
Electric? Yes, your worst enemy. 😉✌️🍻
Hammond is standing up for America on Grand tour 🤣... an honorary patriot
AND nobody talks about its safety fails.  This car is the lowest safety rating in Australia. If you have a  offset front collission in this thing then you are dead or crippled for life, and even worse the person sitting behind the driver is definatly dead, at even speeds less than 60KLM hour.  They are a death trap...but ford wont fix it.
Are the seats comfortable when its upside down Richard ?
Aahhw. It's cute when the Brits say the steering is on "the wrong side".
1969 Mach 1 did not come with “fog lights” like that 1967 GT/A you drove up in. The 1969 had high beams in the grill and low beams outboard in the fender light buckets.
Hammond's 67 mustang puts this mach 1 to shame in the looks department.
I love how flat it stays, even when it breaks traction
did he give out the secret facility location?
Definitely NOT a secret American. You know you love it.
All I’m sayin is when the Mach 1 originally came out it had a different body than the other mustangs coming out at the same time this one should too
My eco boost makes more power than that
Its MACH one not MACK one... so annoying
Hammond you'll become irrelevant if you do ads like this
No  RH Drive for the teabags ??---2 out of three  of you LOVE !!!  Fords---WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GONNA STOP BASHING USA CARS ???????===     BTW   ----  Pronounced MOCK 1 !!!----Like ALLUUUMINNIUM !!!!  and  CENTRIFUUUUGAAL ??"     Get it ??
Is the original faster??
155 mph is that it. My tdi passat does 150 lol
How does this compare to the new Electric version? By the way, the wheel is on the correct side, that you Brits have it wrong is not my problem.
FORD spelled backwards - Driver Returns On Foot
interior needs some update, everything looks lame
In US a Mustang is a college kid's car; a fast, brash, crude and noisy outlet for unused male----ahem---"energy". In UK this must be something only the 1% can drive!!! The car for the rogue gentleman! :-)
My favorite thing about mustangs is their inate ability to uphold darwinism with their crowd seeking missile capabilities.
I have a 2019 mustang I had mine 100 percent stock I have mine over 160 miles an hour and it wanted more ;;; just the difference is mine is a manual it has different gears in there not the 350 gears like a automatic has
This is an ad...not cool.
Yes Hammond Yes 👍Shhhh
So Ford are only moving the steering wheel? Won’t that make accelerating and braking a bit of a stretch unless you have a passenger?
The New Eleanor....
Anyone else want some Mach n' Cheese?
Planet twisting 390 torques.  Really Richard. 390 today is pretty puny.
Mr. Hammond, you should run for politics. The ability to say so much and yet say absolutely nothing is usually a skill reserved for government...and car commercials.
Yeah professional driver on a closed circuit doesn't fill me with confidence... It's Hammond.
Yep all we needed to know. New Mustang still loses it in a simple right turn, clips the curb and slides onto the grass exiting cars and coffee... 8:20.
Nope steering wheel is on the right side 😁
Longtime Stang/Shelby owner here. Not impressed at all. Its an amalgamation of parts from other Stangs & nothing special about the 5.0 Its a great engine on its own, but yet another version for the Mach 1?  No thanks.
Prefer a gt350
Hammonds a legend
hoonicorn is still the best mustang. fight me.
I always love Hammond's work (no relation to me....as far as I know), but, onto the car's stats: if that 0-60 time of 4.4s is correct, it's basically no quicker than my 2019 GT then? (I defy anyone to tell me they can really 'feel' a 0.2 second difference in speed). So, different badges and a couple of retro spotlights in the grill it is then?
Billy Bob Hammond at it again!
Go Hamster Go !!!!
Lap belt just incase sad fools complain.
Those figures seem so mundane in today's age with all the hybrid and electrics out there.
Richard is such a cool guy. He's had that mustang gt390 since his early days at TG
“Active value perf exhaust”?
Too bad you'd not be able to run a 2021 Mach I 30 years from now without altering all the electronics.
All gt's
Viewer question: why does it look like a 2020 BMW M4 Coupe?
Fix your audio!
Who else prefers Hammond's mustang to the new one?
Hillarious
For a car that is given the name Mach 1  and it doesn't exceed 500bhp ..  Never mind not even close to 650bhp    Serious let down far far too tame ,...IMHO
LOVE your 67 🥰😍🥰😍🥰
My dad locked me in the trunk of one of his Mustangs.  He maintains that it was an accident.
If you're worried about mpg, you can't afford to buy it
Richard in a mustang doesn't get any scarier for the people around there O_O
72 decibels is not what a sleeping mouse snore is, a vacuum cleaner is around 70 decibels, this guy 😂😂😂 although 72 decibels is quiet enough for a mustang 😂
Who gives a f@k about the gas mileage 🙄
The man , the myth , the legend himself  We miss u so much Mr.Hammond 😖
Horse go very fast 😂😂😂
Richard Hammond reminds me a little of Jonathan Pryce. Or rather of a little Jonathan Pryce.
This thing is Crushed by the Hellcat, so yea. Excuse me while I stay in Camp Mopar.
No shaker...no dice.
Ford should've put a shaker hood on it, like on the early 2000s Mach 1
Are mach 1 rockets optional?
Richard probably more aggressive driving would be great on the show and less answering questions, leave those just to the ✍ comments
It would be great to see how the new Mach l would perform VS the Camaro SS1LE and the BMW Ms.
The Shelby GT350R & the updated '19 GT350 (cup tires) have been the best handling Mustangs, besides of the new Shelby GT500 CFTP which is also a very strong performer. Lets see how the new Mach I performs.
Gillette is faster...
Ford using GM suspension tech to Help the mustang handle like a camaro :)
I want a mack 1
Richard Hammond reads super corporate responses to questions and gives very vague answers (like the Mach 1 design cues, where he wraps it up after not really identifying them, with, "They're in there".  I love Richard, but this wasn't Richard talking.
Why is mine faster at top speed and 0-60??
it's got paedo writen all over it.
Love your videos, Hammond. I have a 2007 GT Converible California Special because I like all the design cues from the original. I hope you remember every day that you have the best job in the world!
How does it compare to a camaro ss 1le?
WhAtS tHe GaS MiLEagE LiKE??  What a schmuck...
Ford using GM's "adaptive suspension" that came on 20 year old  Chevy Suburbans ... huh? As usual, followers, not innovators. Yea Ford ptttffffhttt!
Dont like it. 69' looks cool.
"My testing secrets. Our testing secrets" *soviet anthem intensifies*
“the proper side” is the left being it’s American
The European version loses almost 30 horsepower compared with the American car. It’s even less than the standard 460 horsepower Mustang GT sold in America.
"professional driver" I think it means professional crasher.
3:41 professional driver? Tell that to rimac.
"Proffesional Driver"  Rimac had never seen such bullsh*t before
You get it Richard, love your work and keep at. Some of us live vicariously thru you man, let's go Grand Tour!
Ah but do you have to keep fixing or repairing Daily
Richard the secret American
Finally Ford Something right With The mustang
I understand the Brits pronounce zebra and aluminium, differently than Americans, but saying Mach, as in mac and cheese, is just wrong headed.
I saw it had a flappy palace to come with the option for a manual
Mack 1? 🤦🏻‍♂️
Paid for content does not equal honest opinion ;)
No crowd was hurt in the making of this video
Sir Richard, you have been missed. It was great seeing you behind the wheel of some "American" muscle again. Yes, I know you haven't been knighted by the queen but you have been knighted in my heart.
Sorry, Brits, but we get 480hp here in America. So yes, horse go fast
The steering wheel bit was amazing
Can ford create a replica of the original Mach 1 with updated technology? if only.
Al Pacino driving a mustang... EPIC!
Why did no one ask if it was a gallo 12 or gallo 24?
When they gonna make 1 with AWD??🤘🤘
So less Horsepower than the standard GT?
How much horse power ?
I’m a thousand times more interested in his 67
Its just junk. How about the lawsuit with the Chinese manual transmission.
i had an 03 mach 1 red
I only just watched you driving the MACH 1 in the Patagonia Special (Top Gear) ... Kept going wrong so maybe this new one is more reliable!
🐎 go 💨. Video over. 😂
Don't tell me let me guess.  Does he crash it?
480 bhp .. and .. would look best in black ..  BTW: f..c.k.  GrandTour .. is usseless .. -) ..
Does it have independent suspension? If not, still in 20th...
The old design still looks soo much better
You really Amon Oliver to test its sidewaysness..and just to treat it nasty..a real test.
"Professional Driver" hahahhahaha
B&O= Bang and Olufson= Philips!!!! It has a Philips  ICE system.
I have a Mercedes Benz AMG it has a v8
Professional Driver    hahahaha
"Professionell Driver"
Looks like a Bottom feeder ?  Typical Ford !Lol
78db is about the same noise as someone using a high powered drill on hammer action on the side of your house whilst you are sat inside trying to listen to John Cage's famous 4'33”
Needs more cinematic
3:57 oh how the insurance company is trembling when hearing him say that
And when you close the door window flops around. Jep thats Ford
I'm sorry but Ford shouldn't have named the Mach e under the Mach or mustang name. Absolutely pathetic
Where does it sit in the modern Mustang hierarchy..
He wants to putt the Steering Wheel to the passenger side ? makes no sense...
is this electric , lol
Lots of science in this video very scientific
Richard im a fan but please dont tell me you are dying your hair and beard.
How's it pronounced, mach 1, mach 1 or mach 1?
Hey Richard just wanna say the mustang is probably my favorite ford car ever built other than the gt40
Do you think will James ever watch this video?
"professional driver on a closed circuit" well..he did not crash this time xD
I'm surprised they gave him the A10 version instead of the tremec. Was it any different than the normal A10? Supposed to have a different torque converter and trans tuning than the regular A10 according to Ford.
How about testing the version with the Tremec manual? Really curious about the gearing, since the facelift manual is like a 3 gear manual with 3 overdrives..
25 years Laterr
No shaker hood killed it for me.  I know it was optional on the original and only standard on the '03-'04 models (which I owned) but it made the car so much more special.  This is a GT with a performance pack and stickers.
Doesn't the Mach 1 use the Bullitt tuned motor? Thus having closer to 480hp as opposed to 460 or "454"? Pretty sure it does. I love this Mach 1 refresh and I think they did an amazing job with it, especially giving it all the GT350 bits they did like the tremac shifter. Super nice car.
Does the ESP turn all the way off when it says off? Does it have a LSD?
I dont get it. This is 2020 and those 0-60 times you could get (or very close) pretty easily back in 2012 with a stock 5.0 and a 3.73 rear end. I know it's not about the quarter mile with this car but to me it's just not worth the hefty price.
Why is he pronouncing Mach as Mack !! Is he really American !!!
Hammond is always in commercials now and hes not allowed to drive fast himself anymore. They have to edit in some pro driving clips.  I think why the trio ended was hammond's safety and hes afraid to drive again after the Rimac crash.
Do the 2021 Mustang Mach-E or i will unsubscribe.
Thank you for having a real Mustang Hammond.
"Ford's secret test facility" then gives the whole address 😂😂
Because of the usual Hamster-ness and shenanigans, people mostly forget to realize that Richard Hammond is indeed a professional driver. He's probably got more vehicle hours and training than pro F1 racers, these days.  Sure, he's had some dreadful crashes, but whoever became a professional driver WITHOUT making crashes? Truly a petrol head, this one.....
The hesitation says it all.
Nice Car.
i was looking for Hammond to bin the mustang in the end so bad :D
let's just keep this between you and me... and also the 1 million views it has and will probably get more
Nice to see the puma got 0.5 seconds for itself
"science" Lol
When you really look at it this new Mach 1 has more in common with the later 72-73 Mach 1's than with the more iconic 69 models, which is an interesting and daring choice. I can't complain, the 1973 Mach 1 in Pewter Silver is my favorite of the "classic" Mustangs so this is a welcome call back.
Does the Mach 1 have a decent launch mode
We build cars in the USA with the steering wheel on the Right side but  they are for postal carriers!
I think the Mach 1 is back because not enough of us motor heads ran out and bought a Bullitt Mustang simply because most of us that saw the Movie when it came out are in the ground!
Well... professional driver... Yeah indeed. Just a few bumper to bumper cases happened with Hammond before.
HAMMOND, YOU IDIOT!
If your first question is if it comes weigh a supercharger your second question should not pertain to mpg...
Needs a Shaker hood Scoop.
They STILL haven't sorted out hood fitment.  The gap at the very front where it meets bumper cover is not consistent. C'mon, FORD!
His Doppleganger is Al Pacino.
First off, it is not a Mack 1, but a Mach 1 (as in baja)
Tbh 390 tq from a 5 L,down low, is not that impressive, compared to Mazda's 2.5L T with like 320 tq at like 2K or something.
Richard if you want some pics of a real 69 Super Cobra Jet Mach1  (side oiler, with shaker hood, and drag pack)  Just happen to be standing next to mine.   I think you will find the new Mach resembles nothing close the the “real” thing.
Looks like a bloated Babel fish.
This should have been a widebody and have more ques from the original
I going to keep my eye out to see that Mach 1 from Alex's dad in Maryland now.
454 hp? Is that a European only number? I keep hearing 480 hp here in the US. 454 is a deal breaker.
Straight up advertisement. should have a disclaimer somewhere.
"Planet twisting 390 torque"  Is this a joke or are you trying to read along the script
I hate how they pronounce Mach 1
The last time I was this unimpressed with a modern take on something I loved in my childhood was the Red Dawn remake.
I wish they had the windo louve
I suspect no one asked Richard Hammond which one he prefers, the 1967 one he owns OR the 2020 one he tested! The Mustang name and badge probably are the only survivors from the iconic car Ford intro in 1964 !? Iococca wrote in his autobio that Ford ruined the car by adding weight and inches every year after introduction. By the mid 1980s it was a bloated whale
Richard is the type of guy, wait a second....
Yay he didn’t crash it
So, the two mustangs shown here happen to have the steering wheel on the ‘wrong’ side? Food for thought. EDIT: question though, between this one and the GT350?
The annoying rabbi immunologically visit because leaf understandably brush till a sore spandex. numberless, cynical manager
767mph amazing! Now break the sound barrier and lets hear that BOOM!💥
Ford's first effort to eliminate the outrageous Shelby franchise fees by dropping the GT350 and replacing it with the milder Mach 1. But...more excitement to come...
Richard, did you actually say "Active Value" exhaust? at 4:32 ?  Fire your script writer.  It's "Active VALVE".
I wonder... are the UK spec Mustangs different from the US?  Just curious because mine is a much older, 2016 model.... and my 5.0 is rated at 435hp,  400lb-ft torque. If the Mach 1 has only 20 more horses and less torque.... that's not really making me want to trade up.  I'm honestly shocked that they're dropping the GT 350 in favor of this Mach 1.   Personally, I think they should've stuck to the 70's game book and made the Mach 1 a dress-up package with stripes, scoops, some trim and maybe some wheels.  Truth be told, the Mustang could use a splash of personality. And painting it a drab, battleship Grey is not what I was thinking.  Bring back the Grabber colors:  ALL OF THEM. Orange, Green, Blue.
Why an American sounds like British?
Ight just dont crash this one
So weird hearing him review a car again. I miss it.
That’s a nice Honda Camry with the hemi track pack raptor edition.   Why are all Mustangs owners mad all the time? Do you know how hard it is to get out a vehicle with high heels and a sun dress on.   Oh and my girlfriend has a mega crush on you.
richard hammond, "professional" driver; with many crashes under his belt
Soooo... I can be a professional driver too?
They gave us a mach 1 because we didnt ask for a mach e
Forgot to mention that the MACH 1 junked the terrible MT82 Getrag manual and has the GT350 Tremec 6 speed. Much more durable and expensive.
So Ford when you making a mark 4 Ford Focus RS. I have no interest in this mustang car. 😞.
“Professional driver closed circuit...” wait when did hammond get out of the car?
Excellent science at the end!
Does the conversion to right hand drive, squeeze the exhaust pipes, which reduces the power, compared to the mustangs sold in America
Where the ambulance helicopter ?
how fast horse go?
Mach e!
When you win a war by yourselves without the help of countries that drive on the RIGHT side of the road, you can call the side you drive on the right side side
I’m glad to see you driving on the correct side of the car
Yours is cooler.
It's a shame that Ford never got the GT350 engine certified for Europe because Europe was the reason they did away with the GT350 and settled on the Mach 1.  Kind of bittersweet...
Hello, my name is Olaf. My love for you is like a truck, Berserker.
3:42 On a scale from one to Rimac Concept One smasher, how professional of a driver are you?
Sorry Richard, proper side is left hand drive, even though I drive a RHD Nissan Stagea Turbo in Canada, RHD is still the wrong side lol.
Just a bit more science, awesom
Hammond: "I'm about to get into the wrong side of this car" I like how there's only one correct side of a car to drive from lol
I thought Ford was done making cars?
Somebody gotta get joe to wipe that dirt off his lip
You can go faster in other cars but is anything more FUN?
I owned an original '69l   it wasn't that amazing 2bbl Windsor and a slush box, Steel wheels and dog dish hub caps. Best thing was the fold down rear seat and the opening in the trunk and you could carry a sleeping bag under the folded down seat.
This is what I've missed from these guys. Actual car reviews for people who like cars.
Mack one?  It's not a truck with a bulldog mascot.  Derin and  Alex  pronounced  it right.
Notice how no live fans were watching the figure 8 haha
11:15 that laugh Hahahahaha!
I love this form of brive tribe. I would love to see a vertion of these with different cars and the other two obvs. I love the editing too P.s. no more Y**ks
Ok,here's the difference.  1966 Stang made the girls gather round😊.  This doesn't do that at all!!!
I’d still take no traction control and a lap belt over this new one any day.
Bi turbo that
Love fords, period.
He says 'wrong side'... But the car he drove there also has it on the 'wrong' side... Hmph. Guess it's not a big problem then.
That’s no Mach 1. That’s just another 18’ mustang GT performance package with a paint job and manual trans.
To quote my high performance engine building professor "not a true 5 liter"
The new MaCK 1 is a disappointment. It's just a dressed up mustang GT so why even bother? It's even missing the iconic MaCK 1 ram air intake on the hood. What a shame...
Using the the term Professional rather loosely I think.
Thought the Mach 1 was originally a trim package more than anything as my 72 Mach 1 is all show and no go 😝
I love that "I can´t see the road in front of me" hood :)
5.0L is not "massive" V8. F-series commercial trucks run 7.3L "massive" V8.
Hey Richard what about its CCO( Crowd Clearing Off) feature? . That should be Mustang owners main concern.
what?????? the mach1 isnt an suv?
Please take the incorrect stripes off the 67
Does the mustang dye its hair?
Is it safe to drive near crowds?
Not the Mach E. Oh well.
Its beautiful
Must be one of the only test drives Hammond has bone and not crashed.
Love the editing of the leaves on the front of the car, why not have the supercharged 550 engine in it? they are there and then they are gone, lol, they would sell a lot more of them, after all we know why mustang owners want, never ever stock performance which is why they take it to aftermarket tuners and people like roush mustangs ?
Richard Hammond drives - *CLICK*
Ford performance going down the drain. That's why they pulled out of Racing.
I'll take that 67 fastback over the new Mach 1 any day of the week.
"Professional driver"
is it a auto engine?
can you jump it? and would a murderer choose it?
Its a gt tbh
Not gonna lie I kinda want to get that hood on my Black Bullitt Mustang
Quite sure the cars in the back are driven by trained medic...........
during the figure 8, the hood mounted camera disappears on the exterior shots and reappears on the interior shots...what kind of editing is that?
Every Mustang looks worse than every Challenger
Actually surprised they let you drive it considering...well you know 😂🤔
Science, lol.
This is just a glorified ad. And guess what, everything about the car is amazing.
You're telling us it can take corners whilst driving on steeply cambered corners.... Grip: Reality, I'd like you two to meet.
I'm gonna guess, since there was no uncut footage of his barrel racing...the Mustang handles much like it always has....like a curb seeking missile.
whenever I hear the works, "scientific" or "test" from richard, jeremy, james, I just sit there, go "oh no", and then say, "what could possibly go wrong?"
Why does the British variant only have 454hp when the American version has 480?
They sure have gotten a lot of mileage out of that 289/302 block.
Mr. Hammond you may just possibly be insane, if so then I'm completely nuts !
Great format! Hope to see more content like this.
Plz drive a 6th Gen Camaro 1le someday
2:01 MAMA
I'll stick with my 2020 Bullitt. Thanks.
Why would they call it Mach 1 if it can’t go Mach one
Would it be possible you to make that very specific car as a giveaway tho, maddly fan of u and mustangs since i knew about cars. I really wish you could be on my shoes and feel me and my love for that car
480hp and 420lb ft of torque for the American market, as opposed to the 450 and 390 figures you were talking about
This is quite underwhelming. Hopefully it will get some new styling or something to make it more exciting than the old modles because this one seems too underpowered to be a muscle car, too big to be a sports car, to small to be a practical sedan, so what is it exactly. This car seems to suffer from extreme mediocrity
What's with all the automatic transmissions? Lacks the handling joy.
It's always great to see people loving science so much :).
Hey Richard with the millions and millions you made from Amazon why don't you buy the rights to Top Gear and revive it
never put a new mustang next to a classic .. it is too big
8:45. We don't fu....g give a s..t about your story mate. Just ask the question. And private stuff keep for yourself.
Hey Hammond, It’s the wrong new mustang. The correct one is called mach e
Hammond loves muscle cars
“That sort of thing generally ends badly for me” 😂
can't believe he didn't have his seatbelt on
It should have a real shaker hood and real lights to properly recall the lights in the grill.
Doesn’t it have a heater? Will I need to wear a coat?
Nice car ....buuut not a tesla
Sunny referenced Robocop lol
Let me get this straight. My 2012 Boss 302 tops out at 157, with a 0-60 in 3.9 seconds. So, for 53,000 US dollars you can have a slightly slower, slightly less quick mustang than my 9 year old Boss.  Oh,  there is the additional fact that I bought my Boss used for 25,000 US dollars 2 months ago.
the 67 is sooooooo much better looking!
the front kind of looks like a Mondeo
This is a 11 min long ad.
Richard . . . you voice is beginning to sound like David Attenborough's  😉.
The helmet is there to protect the mustang from Hammond.
Richal Pacimmond!
The " Mack" one..er...1....and virtual fansies....great....😒
This is a really lame video. Sorry to say. I drive an ‘18 mustang GT PP1 and this isn’t informative in the slightest on what it’s like to drive one of these things.
These are some of the dumbest most generic questions.... are these even car enthusiasts asking these questions?
You don't get an mustang, and ask for mpg.
calling Hammond a professional driver is a bit far fetched, isn't it?
Crash test = 0... This car are bull's sheet comper with Audi, Honda, BMW etc
480hp*
This is heresy for me to ask, but...   Can it take a Dodge Demon engine?
Him saying “Mack 1” is infuriating to my yankee ears 🤣🤣🤣
This fossil isn’t electric yet but they have a suv that is? Huh?
Al Pacino of car reviewer
He be smoking people with his Witty remarks
"Professional driver. Closed course. Do not attempt."  Hahahahahaha!  .....hahahahaha!
Yes when it goes on sale in the uk theyll probably change the side of the steering wheel, reduce the engine size and power and get rid of its nice looks
Richard.”And it’s me driving it”  Me.”Oh no here comes another crash.”
“Active Value performance exhaust” 🧐 you surely mean “Valve” ? I had to re watch that bit, come on Hammond get it together 😂
It's Richard Hammond...let's face it, the fact there isn't a visible health and safety presence is irresponsible.  At this point Hammond shouldn't be trusting driving anything that goes *vroooom*
Yuck 🤮
I know it’s a special one, but the modes are basically the same as my dad’s. It gets louder in race mode so on so on, but our one is a 2019 model so it has stuff like that. A 2018 one doesn’t do that.
The steering wheel is on the proper side already. When it is built for Britain it is going to be on the wrong side.
It's a snake not a horse   OK tHen
The AC vents looks like came from Grand Livina
😑He shooda got a stick.🤔
so i searched 1/24 scale diecast & this came up, i know Hammonds not the tallest person but thats just rude.
Blaupunkt lol they are trash now
Hammond: *Wears Helmet* His Insurance Company: *Breaths heavily*
Considering 90% of the world drives on the left, gotta wonder why they think we're on the wrong side. LOL
If you like driving Mustangs, you’ll probably like this one: I drove a brand new one in LA 5 years ago for a couple of months and it did three things for me - it reinforced the truth of the saying “don’t meet your heroes and it made me kiss my beloved, reliable, fun BMW on my return home, and, lastly, it confirmed my suspicion that the Mustang was build in order to support long-term employment of chiropractors for the car I drove had the worst suspension of any car I had driven. To each his own, I suppose.
The new mustangs are trash
I came here to point out the typo at the bottom of the screen at 3:42, but it seems so did everyone else.
Dear Richard, do the cameras make you look better than you actually are? hmmmm x
... I get my "Active Value" exhausts at Lidl....
4:32 .."....an Active Value" exhaust?? Surely that should be "Active Valve.." ???
"Professional driver, closed circuit". Isn't that called a half truth? 😉
Mustang needs to up the 5.0 to over 500hp !
Its not a Mac 1!  Its a Mach 1!   Click that audio button to hear how it is said, in the link. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mach Your english, i though yall knew how to speak all proper like!
Man I miss these guys. The trio should make like 20 seasons of Grand Tour
What a ridiculous world we live in where they have to add a disclaimer about a lap belt!
He still can't go in a straight line
I thought it was 480hp and 420 TQ 🤷🏼‍♂️. Same specs as the bullett mustang
Say “Mac-won” one more time...
Wait, this isn't that electric Mustang that can do a wheelie...
where is grand tour
"Ford have dragged the mustang into this century" "It's the 21st century" "Ah"
Is this a paid ad? This thing is about as exciting as a wet weekend in Skegness.
"Professional Driver" :0
As much as I like Shmee, Carfection, Car Wow etc.. let's not forget that Richard and his two mates are the Daddies of car review videos. They paved the way. My respect for them is immeasurable. This is The Way.
I'm surprised they let him any where near it ... also surprised he didn't fall over walking towards it and dent it...
Couldn’t help but notice “professional driver “ Richard was still driving ..
holy brown nose sponsor batman
5.0L 450hp....while ford puma 1.0L 155hp let this sink for  a minute ....
This just seems like an ad. I'll wait for a real review then
I thought they’d make an EV version.
I drive a Ford F-150 pickup truck, it has the same basic engine. I love it, great mileage, and, when i punch it, it moves. And, it sounds like a proper V-8.
Nothing worse than a ‘man’ dying his hair.
i like his 67 better than the modern mustang
450hp ! Is that it?
great...now end the contract with amazon,get the other two to do car videos like this and call it top g...i mean drivetribe...and i dont know it could maybe become the best entertaining car show in the world?...just an idea...
Q: How’s the Mach 1 Tires? Hammond:  “Ruined.”
The best thing of the Mustang is that we can buy a Camaro!! I drove both.
Richard: “oh yeah , it works!” Ford engineers: “Ouch”
Was Just thinking of a CLK63 BLACK hurling down an empty freeway on a Sunday morning while watching this. Sorry.
the headlights and mirrors look kinda..... wonky
Imagine listening to this in that Ford🔥🔥🔥https://youtu.be/b-K-FB0H_h8
man, that track is truIy beautifuI
I’ll take your 67 any day over these new sports car mustang.
Great hair and beard dye!
Mack 1/5th
Like a mini grand tour episode! Brilliant, more of these are needed!
They weren't fog lights. They were the high beams.
that looks sick
I would still take the old over the new any day!
Bugatti🔙https://youtu.be/ipLFlQMa3NY
"professional driver"
Hammond gets into the car. Screen subtitle says "Professional Driver." [Citation Needed]
Why 0-62, and not 0-60?
Hah!  I worked at Dunton for 40 years until 2004.  When I started it was called Ford Research & Engineering.  Then it became Product Development, and now I see they are calling it Ford Campus.  What the heck is that all about?   The mustang looks cool, but would Steve McQueen have liked it?
Russian subtitles please!!!
Mustang that go 200mph stock:  "Look how they massacred my boy."
1:44 HAMMOND DONT SHUT DOORS LIKE THAT😭😭
Where is the shaker hood
Pretty much the Mach 1 is a conglomeration of a slightly higher tuned Bullit motor, assorted Cobra parts, special paint colors and striping and that's about it.  I work over at the Flat Rock Assembly plant, and drive these (and 350's, 500's, Ecoboosts, and GT's) all day...  :)
Your on trending in Australia
This TG or TGT-tier production values. Great video.  I guess the other two got too old to care about anything other than food and farming, lol.
I never thought I would hear Richard Hammond say horse go very fast.
best part about the old mustang if you wanted you can legally make 300 a year and sell them
Did they de tune the coyote? That’s less power and torque than the normal Gt
Someone tell Derin that it’s not 2005 anymore. Mustangs have handled great since the 5.0 came out.
Richard hammond looks like Rich from the Better Call Saul...... o.0
Hi Richard, as a previous owner of a 1970 Mustang convertible this particular video caught my eye - AND DIDN'T DISAPPOINT !!! V8 Mustang's still have their allure. Enjoyed this very much.
My brother had a 1970 Mach One. It was stolen and found burned in a field :(. AND...the Calgary Stampeders football team were sued by Ford because of their running horse symbol, which is near identical to the Mustang symbol. However, Ford lost. The Stamps have used the symbol since 1949 LOL. They graciously allowed Ford to use THEIR symbol. :)
Nice jacket anyone know what brand is it ?
Fake iron man!
also, why dont they smack the barra 4.0litre i6 in it, they are awesome engines that can probably handle more HP at the flywheel than the motor in it right now
"proffesional driver" at least when i crashed my car at 150 it still drove
I’m confused.  I thought the new Mustang is a crossover EV?
“Do not attempt” as he is driving at a respectable speed
Am I the only one who thinks that V8 sounds underwhelming
No one is talking about the fact that it’s a freaking automatic.
Can you play Bon Jovi - Wanted and feel like you’re cowboy riding a Steel Horse ?
He is getting old..
Great car for women who like to go fast...
the old stang will always be special
did he say active VALUE performance exhaust. he misread the V for a U in valve
But how fast will the E mustang go up that hill?
"Does it have a Blaupunkt" !? Hope that was a joke... If it did and I got one the first I would do is change it to something better than Blaupunkt :P I would consider this car with a manual gearbox if I had any plans of getting one :P
And old looks better
Hammond got one thing wrong though, his test Mustang actually does have the steering wheel on the correct side...it's the UK model that'll have the steering wheel on the wrong side, and that's so it coincides with them driving on the wrong side of the road.....#FORDAllDayEveryDay
“The Mack 1 “  Americans : “ The MahK 1 “
#StangGang
Nice to see Hammond back testing cars. I really want them back 😢
I assume the disclaimer at 3:42 was sarcastic, as most of have seen past episodes of top gear.
Remember when mustangs looked and sounded like beasts. Where did that go
I like Camaros
At least he didn't crash it. 😌
Would rather have the 67. Hate the look of new muscle-cars
>Hammond >Professional driver  pick one
3:32 The 999 switchboard when Hammond gets into a car.
Wow! That first Mustang, the green one looked awesome.
I don't like Mach 1 because it replaces GT350. My GT PP2 is pretty the same as Mach 1.
So "Mach 1" is basically just a cosmetic package.
Hamond !! But this is not electric , this car have no future
Richard calls it the Mac-1  The rest of the world calls it a MACH-1, as in Mock-1.
This "secret facility" joke never gets old.
How could they dare to call this a "Mustang"!? They've always been electric SUVs! Wait, it was the other way around...
I would still take the 65 mustard
Surprised he didn't crash.
I heard the Mach was supposed to be an suv
People in the UK are used to driving little shitboxes with 4 or 6 cylinder. They atrnt used to driving something with real power. So they pick on the handling because theres no land there to really get moving.
Merc- Mercedes (U.S.) Murk- Mercedes (Brits)  Mach 1 (U.S) Mac 1  (Brits)  ...
Drove a Mustang in Hawaii. Impressive machine. Not practical for people in the back seat.
Looks badass... manufacturers usually make the graphics on their cars with their aero kits work and look perfectly.. the obvious exception is Porsche lol.
I know the real top gear is dead .. and I understand most was scripted when presenting it to the viewers.. but dammed did all of them not deliver thier review in a simple and honest way that connected with the viewers.. even that stuiped orangaatang CLARKSON can understand this one.
the new mach 1 has more similarities to my electric razor than a classic Mach 1. oh ford...
Hammond with a beard. Awesome!
Professional driver is a bit of a stretch.
Beautiful car, just missing a shaker hood.
I feel like the cinematography and audio is kinda underwhelming for what a "grand tour-esque" video.
The new Mach 1 is nice... when Hammond isn't looking I'm heisting his '67 and driving it like, well, I stole it. ;} (jk, but I'd totally take the '67 over the Mach 1.)
it is fast how does it crash
any car with a 155mph top speed is generally speed limited. it's becoming a standard. It also doesn't bother me at all, I've been over 180+ on a bike, and don't think I'd want to do it again. As we mature, I feel like handling, and the balance of power/torque, and how it's used is far more important than  0-60, and top speed.
I thought the Mach 1 had 480hp? Not 454?
Ngl this is a glorified advertisement
What does the Exhoost fume taste like?
yawn...
Id put some lights in those grille spots.
Why the adolescent delivery? The UK seems in decline more than ever.
Right hand drive is the wrong side. America created cars, we say what's right.
Awesome that Hammond is on my TV.
4:12 you'll never guess his name
This format is very strange. I get that it's a promo but this was an awkward experience. Even a bit 'cringey' at times to be honest.
Certaly a heritage there. With it sharing under bonnet with proven fun sister ships liek "BULLITT"
There shouldve been a drag race between hammonds car and the new mach1
Richard looking like Tony Stark?
it feels like a grand tour episode now
Shame shelby isnt around to slap superchargers on stangs anymore
Thank you for this video...
Would’ve been nice if it had the rear hatch like the original so nope
Its rated at 480hp in the US. Is it detuned for the UK?
mustang is a pretty car but the interior just is not cool enough
Not secret facility anymore ;)
Give my British brothers a Manual
This is a long Ford commercial.
Now that's a Mustang. The Mach E is not a mustang.
Please... I want more of these... Reviewing cars... I would also like James driving ferraris and rolls... Please make it happen.
In America I wish we had tyres
Everything. I love everything about mustangs
The steering wheel appears to be in the correct place.
Obsolete Rubish - this is the age of the Model S P100D, Mach-E, Model Y performance, and soon Tesla Roadster and Model S Plaid.
did he crash it yet?
It’s Mach 1 not Mack 1
Tire shredders, it's always what I think of with these videos 😆
That green 67 though 😍
The engine sounds are really badly edited. The same audio clip over multiple video cuts.
As Ford copies Porsche for needlessly complicated words explaining a system. Its like GM's Magnet Ride suspension, or the old Audi TT's suspension of yore, basically.
I wonder if Ford cost a premium over sea like BMW and Mercedes in America...
10:52 to 11ish, did he work for J. Peterman,  nice use of a thesaurus.
Mustangs are tooooo quiet in the uk, thought it was only an issue with the new ones that actually get sold in the UK now but by the sounds of Hammond’s, it’s them all :(
Why can’t they just remake the original Mach 1’s? They’re so sick.
HAMMOND!!!!
It is not, ‘mack 1’, it is ‘mock 1’  smh
Will Jeremy Clarckson buy this car?
6 less hp than the GT....hows that better????
Mustangs have always been Pony cars, they are not now, nor ever were, true"Muscle Cars".
A mustang isn't a muscle car or a family car with a big engine. What a poor analysis. Its a pony car like the Camaro, they were a mix between sport and muscle. And while they did have base models with 6 cylinders at the beginning, it still wasn't considered a family car. My grandpa bought a 1964 1/2 brand new, he considered it a sports car back then.
This is just blatent advertisement for Richard Hammond.
More American than an American...pinky ring included
Shouldn't Vlad be driving an AMG G63?
Check out the Hoonicorn Mustang.  It's fast.
The original Mach 1 was mostly a dressed up standard Mustang.
'69 was also well before computer controlled anything.
Why is he wearing that jacket? Hammond get Ford to show you how the heater operates!!!
'Includes paid promotion' Yes Ford paid Richard obviously, so this review isn't objectionable. Every car has some bad points.
Proper work, Richard.
5 liter V8 massive???
The HP and TQ numbers are wrong at 1:35 or am I missing something?
Why would I pick this up over a GT350 or GT500? Why are there two big holes on the front grill as if they thought about adding lights and then forgot to add them?  The car hardly looks special.
“ is that a mk1 ?”
Does it come in the color black?
Cant believe ford got rid of the gt350 for this
It's to bad they don't get the full 480 hp we get in america.
Science!
Richard,  I’ve always enjoyed your observations and commentary over the years. Just a minor niggling point here. A 5.0 liter engine in an American car is classified as a SMALL block. Not a great hulking V8 or words to that effect. FWIW my MGB has a Ford 5.0 liter engine and I’m sure you’d agree that the ubiquitous MGB doesn’t really have the room for a great hulking V8.
he cant afford to loose anymore braincells
Crowds be like 😐
I thought Ford was going to stop making gasoline sport car Mustangs and just start making electric sport SUV Mustangs
Science? Yeah right!
Where is the new grand tour episode?
As a 2016 Mustang GT owner, I got to say thanks for this, Richard.  My machine is an unvarnished joy, without the added sophistication of the Mach 1's additional hardware, so I can only guess how much of a thrill your test drive was.  Thanks a lot!
Hammond drives the new mustang and promptly crashes it
It's sad because me n Rich would be best mate's but after I followed him to the bakery he got all like "oh what you following me for" I don't know, celebs these day's eh.  He's still my mate tho, it's just he's busy I guess
Awsome😀🇳🇴
Hi Rich just did a massive message but it was cancelled 😭
I now have a new favourite car
Lol
Hey Richard, I'll buy or trade you for your Mustang.
Would rather have the 68.
How does he still get company’s to give him keys to anything, considering he wrecks just about everything
Ford must be nuts giving the Hamster the keys to that car.
How is 390 torques "planet twisting"??? A BMW 520d has 400.
I'm upset with how hard he slammed the door on that classic stang
454bhp and a "mighty planet twisting 390 torques..." Um... That's not really "planet twisting"... But okay...
The Mach 1 with that color combination and wheels looks amazing. Want one
Scott looks GAF
Keep in mind that modern 3 litre engines can produce more power and better mpg. Also keep in mind that Merc has an engine that spits 420hp from 2000ccm. So its numbers are not that hot. I was expecting 550+.
471 downvotes simply due to Hamster butchering the pronunciation of Mach  https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/mach https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number#Etymology https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnQbh85sYCw
The U.S. base GT has more horsepower..lol.
Hammond and a mustang and he hasn't crashed it?? Two wrongs must make a right
Mack 1, Say whaaaaattt???
Asking about MPG? 😝
It’s the bullet rebranded and marketed as new...
thank you YouTube comments, I love hearing the same joke a thousand times
https://youtu.be/K-bTqx-d3XQ it's Cheryl blossom
You mispronounced "correct." It's the correct side of the car. 😅🇺🇸
When it said ‘professional driver’....of what? Driving off a mountain 😂😂😂
Which is safer? Mustang or Rimac
Disclaimer says "Professional Driver" but Hammond is driving! lol Hope he doesn't crash lol
The Hamster driving the Mustang Mach 1.....*Professional driver..." pops up on the screen...lol
3:42 "professional driver" might be a bit of false advertising there
Would love to have a job like that 👍
Makes the old 1967 model a real old nag!
Mustangs are ladies cars.
Professional driver, closed circuit is only half true really isn’t it?
911 why you laughing
I wish they James, Richard, and Jeremy would have stuck to doing car reviews even without the studio stuff. Claiming to be too old and tired to keep on doing the full show and then ONLY doing the most tiring, stressful, and arduous section of that show seems a little ironic. Plus I can't be the only one who is interested to know what these 3 think of new cars
Everyone's saying that Hammond has many air ambulances on stand by, but that's so unrealistic.     They did this beside a hospital for proper safety measures.
Why do they need to tell us "on a circuit" think we understand that.. no traffic... no people and a guy driving a car with a helmet on 🙄🤣
Its mook 1
the electric Mustang Mach E can outrun this piece of garbage. As can 9 other models.. 155 mph....woooooo
MACH
nice film. Nice car. Still prefer the Challenger :)
The original Mach 1 was little more than once a dress up kit
Mach 1 :  Slow Car.  155mph  4.4 to 60.  Made for USA speed limits.
bruh this is still a british spec tho... last time i checked, merican mustang gt has a little more horse power then the british gt... so id guess that the same goes for the mach 1.... ok nvm, he is driving (what my guess is) an american spec... its left hand drive.. but still, yall get the point
Why does he sound like David Attenborough?
Please do this more, the grand tour having one episode per year isn’t gonna cut it.
You're way off on your horsepower and tourqe numbers.
Such a shame they didn't put it on an actual racetrack, or at least on a normal backroad! Well, I suppose we all know the reason.
I completely skipped this video because I read Mach E....
I thought the Wolverine from X-men was driving the Mustang.
Richard looks so small next to that mustang it’s hilarious
Fake Al Pacino
"Oooh yeah, it works!" Unlike Clarkson's GT40 replica :D
Please do more of these
Usually you have to pay double for that sort of action Cotton.
Carefull Richard there's a very obvious corner up ahead
It's nice to see they still keep the "top secret test facility... Just of the a438  next to Tesco" or whatever, just a classic joke that doesn't get old.
Oof...an automatic! 🤮
isnt this a "new"car, its build of of the old cassis right?
You're not looking 38 anymore Richard, time is a cruel mistress, to us all.
I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed. I wonder if Ford will ever sell an insane Mustang in Europe like the ones in the US (ie the gt 350 and gt 500)
Hey random person scrolling down the comments.     Have a wonderful day  :)
@4:30 active value performance exhaust...  right...
Richard - are the new right hand drive Mustangs still a “Death Trap” as tested by ANCAP?  Also Richard, in consideration of ANCAP’s report into the right hand Mustangs, would you let any of your children or friends children ride in the back seats of one of these?  Excellent write up on this issue from Automotive Engineer - the AutoExpert in link below: https://autoexpert.com.au/posts/warning-dont-buy-the-2017-ford-mustang
Hammond is never going to live down the Rimac lol
It said, professional driver, closed curcuit, do not attempt. Richard, who drove the car?
Should have given it the ol’ Scandinavian flick
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔻
Magnetic dampers was tested by Bose of all people on a 90s American sedan. Very  expensive but Facinating.
That transmission sounds terrible.
Part of me was waiting for the applause as the video started to fade out. Im so excited for the next grand tour episode!
I want it to be said that you will always be my favourite car reviewer. And also! I LOVED the questions. Should review everything for us!
My uncle in Canada had a 69 Mustang. My cousin wanted to go to KFC with his friend but as my uncle had a little too much to drink he gave the keys to my cousin. Sounds well so far except my cousin was only 14/15 year old. He skidded on black ice on the return journey and wrapped it around a tree. The can only of been around 4yrs old. Ouch.
"Orrrrr...NOW."   lol...anyone get the reference?
I love the Mustang that doesn't involve "Mach E" in the name. All the others are great 👍
Thought my tv was going wrong with all those flashing colour-scene joining-effects
Slightly slower than the Mustang Mach E. Ouch. Why did they have to call that a Mustang?
Hammond in a Mustang? ... 🐎🚗🔥💥 ...  🤣
REPENT YE: FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND ……...JESUS CHRIST IS LORD.
1:05 ... Which is exactly why I hate Mustangs! They ALL look the same now days, no real visual differences between them.
C'mon Ricardo............. Get a shave!
Horse go very fast
now, how about the mach e →v→
Richard, as a woman and a fan please lose the black hair dye and the makeup I would rather see you white as snow with gray hair then your look now. Love you and love the Mustang!
That 67 Mustang Richard Hammond got looks really beautiful.
0:07 Not so secret if you tell us where it is
Only a Ford will do a car with a 5.0L V8 that only has 480hp and 0-60 in 4.4s. What lame, horrible specs for a modern car.
Best looking Mustang 😊👍
The driver's seat is in the correct spot,  placing the driver on the right side is known as a handicap.
Just under half a tank of fuel with 56km till empty 😂😂 not ideal in the uk tbh.
But the real question is    Can it crowdsurf...
Please keep giving us the odd car reviews. All 3 of you. Please
"Professional Driver" 😂😂
another ford ad .. tff
11:15 An hamster is happy!
So Richard's got a new job at Ford... so is the Grand Tour not coming on then?
hammond go fast, cant crash at mach one!
Lame colour for a ‘stang and a slushbox:( ... also I would have thought the horsepower would have a bump over the outgoing Bullitt has 480!
The real yoga, which is called raja yoga is to lead a highly moral life not morality according to circumstances but through ethical activity in life, clear thinking. They never mentioned exercise but their emphasis was a very moral life, highly mind which is active. The meaning of the word yoga is to join the higher with the lower.
That '67 mustang is still the best looking car ever....
hammond should try out (crash) the new mach e
Anyone else utterly underwhelmed by how this sounds?
3:42 where’s the professional driver ?
‘Active value performance exhaust’??? Is that like active valve exhaust???
Hammond, you do know that your 1967 Ford Mustang is a Ford Falcon with a Mustang body kit and lower rear-end gear??!
I prefer the bullet style mustang rather than the new style.it morphs into a muscle car with no style
He said "Mack one" I 'm out.
The best thing about the  Ford Mustang  is that most of them are in America and not on UK roads.
Sorry it just looks like Mustang, unlike the original Mack 1 which was completely different.🤷‍♂️
Most important question hadn't been asked, should you run and which direction or hide and where when new Ford Mustang Mach 1 leaves the parking lot?
Love hammond's  mustang.much nicer.that one any day all day.
for me this is the real top gear now
450 hp but a stock GT350 makes 526 .....
its a rebadged Bullitt
And he's not even upside down, or on fire. Is that actually even hammond?
The 'wrong side' of the car is the side without the steering wheel...
"CLASSIC MUSTANG FITTED WITH LAP BELT ONLY"  Really, Tim Rodie?
"Hooray! I hire psychopaths to run my businesses! I am still relevant!"
only a wild beast mustang, it will be only car hamster will not dare to crush it in a fence
Hammonds Mustang is the same as the one used in Bullit
Wheel is on right side!
The new one is lovely but the old one is still 1,000 times cooler.
The thirsty alligator pharmacologically precede because butane beautifully fold via a grandiose washer. nosy, boring lift
Horse go very fast 😂😂😂
Congratulations on not totaling the new toy.
Feels like one of the old type car reviews they did on top gear, class
So slower than a minivan (Telsa Y)
Buy new mustang for 36,000 or get a Tesla Model 3 for $35,000 that's faster, saves the planet, saves more money in the long run, is incredibly high tech, better safety features, and can be upgraded to FSD if desired
As long as the mach 1 does not come electric, Richard wont have another remac moment
I like Richards 67 better then the 2021. But the 2021 is ok
Awesome video 🚘
just for men?
Only 450hp thats low the gt makes more but maybe its detuned for the uk which if true thats a shame
Well joe when you can afford one come back to me
The original Mach 1 was a rust bucket. I have owned 4 Ford's and all had rusting problems, but I loved them anyway
OK you can't say PROFESSIONAL DRIVER at 3:43 after we all just saw Richard get in it.
So, its still a dinner  for Supra ???
As much as I like Hammond this is just one big Mustang Ad for Ford...Meh.
Seems like a cheap Chinese knock off of what a Mach 1 should be. Apparently Ford makes happy meal toys.
When is the next episode of The Grand Tour?
Finally Mazda made a muscle car
Professional Driver?
i like the old car
She is beautiful.
Plz no crash
03:42...what exactly classifies Richard Hammond as a professional driver...? He's crashed and nearly killed hinself hasn't he? So the safety message displayed is rather  .... ..... ......   Irrelevant I'd say
Am I the only one fearing he'll crash it?
4:13 sorry but 24?
Hello Richard.  How high are your insurance premiums now, and are they less then the GDP of Liechtenstein?
I'm mostly impressed by his jacket.
Yawn its another mustang
Rumor has it that after his last crash, Richard's wife asked the doctors to covertly implant a vital monitoring chip letting her know his heart rate, levels of adrenaline, and curiously enough exposure to fish at all times.
Car is parked, wheels on the ground and not on fire, another successful test by Richard Hammond!

Before I watch this all I can think of is “Don’t crash it Hammond.”
I’m glad that CDC just came out with a shaker hood scoop kit for the s550 so we can put that shaker on and rly make it a mach 1!
What could possibly go wrong here
Now that Richard is driving the new Mustang, I can finally see what it looks like upside down!
Secret facility, will secrets never end?  That window needs a car hop tray from amazon.
Wow... my 04 Mach 1 with a few bolt ons does 4.5 0-60 and will top out around 172.... They need to stop with this 150-155 top seed on cars these days
Such a Beast!
Looking at most mustang owners around me the mode would never leave sport. Neighbor consideration doesn't seem to be a common trait
You means when it's arrive in uk they will put the steering wheel on the wrong side of the Car
No shaker hood?
This format for car reviews was fantastic.
Original is still way better looking
Great Video Richard Hammond
Feels like this video is produced by no frills Ford however Hammond makes it entertaining. Nicely done Hammond,  we are excited for the new episode of The Grand Tour.
https://youtu.be/Q9R.-yXXXwC8 Wisdom Follow Jesus Christ, he rose from the dead! Obey him before its too late. He is the only way to get to the Father John 14:6 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Hebrews 5:9 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

Why has mustang never got the same horse power Chevrolet exorcist or demon
I am surprised he didn't crash.
Jeremy should be involved
Brits like ford?
Not happy with the name mach 1. Unless it goes 767 mph
Americans really tell there story aha
This felt like a Hammond bit from Top Gear.
That's a nice car. Looks just like it's not so fast previous model.
02:44 - Gas mileage aside :-) thanks for answering my questions Richard - a 12 speaker B+O sound system - love it! Awesome episode. What a car!!
So glad to hear a review from Hammond again
coloca legenda em português
Ha! Question from Ukraine! 4:20
Trust the mustang to swing in to a grass embankment sideways
cool Mach E
Steering wheel is in the wrong place ? Will there be a U.K. version ?
MOCK not MACK! ARRRRGH!
Stinky stang
Oh come on Richard you do a F’ing car test but at no point do we get to know the 6 figure sum that the car costs
Redefining Professional Driver😂
SO whats your opinoion of th Mach E.  lol
Steering wheel is already on the proper side Richard :D
Sorry their is only one horse in motoring history and that’s the mighty “Prancing Horse” not that I would have either and given one it would get sold right away...
Hammond: "Professional Driver" Also Hammond: *pokes fun at himself for his dragster crash*
Horse indeed go very fast.
Bad intro to advertise the Mach 1, rolls a 1968 390 GT up next to it and I forgot there was a new car on show.
I too want to do science
Allowing visual comments to pop up on the screen during the video completely ruined the video.  Plus it is "Mauck One", not "Mack One"
The mustang mach 1 is better then the SUV EV MUSTANG
No manual. Thats sad. I used to like manuals in principle, but now I do in practice. It's makes a tdi Jetta fun to drive. Compared to literally anything auto Ive driven anyways.
Yeah it's nice, but does it come with a proper manual?
Motor Trend has been doing the Figure 8 for decades
So what’s the difference between the Mach 1 and a GT350? Just buy a GT350....
Richard Hammond, car salesman.
I really hope they make more videos like this with james and jeremey, i miss there car reviews
Professional driver? I think he's more of a stunt driver then a pro since he's crashed so much...
Great presentation of the new mustang Thanks hammond
Did I just willingly watch a 12 min ad about a mustang?
Loved the video! missed a review like this haha, keep it up!
Rear drive, V8, American muscle.... Europeans need not apply 🖕
Where is the jaguar restoration updates
It's like a gt350 that has had too much coke and is more flatulent as a result
Richard Hammond there, Channelling his inner Brian coxs towards the end,those...........long pauses between words......given the sense of a moment of self contemplation 🤔 feeling a new season of brainiack coming 😂😂👊🏻 edit; if you read this comment in clarksons condescending voice makes it that bit more funny 😂
"Professional  driver, can't go around the corner."
Keep your 350 Richard, it’s better 😉
Could've used a standard gt in this test. Why not show us how it really drives like a normal grand tour test...
They must give you an aging pill when you join TG.
„Massive V8“ laughs in Dodge
I'm surprised it lasted the whole episode......mustangs aren't known to be that well built......
...and the Euro NCAP rating is....?
What year is this "Mack 1"?   454 horse , 390 "torques", 0-60 in 4.4 and  top speed of 155? My '11 GT premium 6 speed with the 3.73 gear option was rated at 412 horse and the same 390 torques... 0-60 was supposedly around 4.3ish and I believe governed at 150 or 155.  So what happened to the 350 influence?
Excellent vid - ‘scientifically rigorous“ testing 😂 👍👍👍
Better than new top gear
This is a much better looking car than the original Mach 1 - a neighbour had a white one with blue stripes in the 70’s
Calling Hamster a professional driver is like calling Boris Johnson a professional politician.
Probably alone in this but I prefer the 67 mustang's looks
Im getting used to the new The Grand Tour Format
Upvote for Scott
As a lotto how many wrinkles does Richard have at 10.33 Clue: Answer is over 10!
I like how Richard is slowly morphing in to a chuckle brother.
the steering wheel on this model is on the correct side, later on when they start mass production of the car there will be some defected models that will be sent to UK with the steering wheel on the wrong side.
Don't worry, UK, when it goes on sale over there they will put the steering wheel on the proper side for you to drive on the wrong side of the road.

Hopefully he didn't crash this one too 😂
Troll comment of the day: "450 hp almost isn't enough for 300 km/h, let alone Mach 1 at sea level!..." 🤦‍♂️
where is the next episode of grand tour?????????
Active value exhaust??
Tyre wear looks like it maybe a bit of an issue, Richard !!
Why does Mr. Hammond uploading the new episode of Grand Tour on YouTube?
This is great, no members of the Hammond family had their outfits ruined or were abandoned in the making of this video
Why are all the questions coming from viewers that look like they just got their learners permit?
I'd much rather be driving Hammonds' Mustang. Also, when they sell it in the UK will it be fitted with a Mondeo engine like previous Mustangs?
At 7:57 the rear left wheel actually comes off the ground for a split second.
I do appreciate these scientific tests. Seems legit.
Wish it had the gt350's flat plane crank
Mustangs always look way faster than they actually are
The Q&A format isn’t great, please bring back the old GT/Top Gear style reviews instead!
NOW THIS FEELS LIKE THE GRAND TOUR WOW PLEASE DO IT MORE OFTEN ❤️❤️
That was a long Ford advert
Why does he remind me of roger Taylor
If ya want fast cars crashing call for Richard Hammond 😂😂😂👌
Not sure if 390Nm is "planet-twisting"
NOT, for me BUT... it looks nice!
bet you 20 bucks this will sell like pancake in germany
"Active value performance exhaust"??! Richard you need to read better... think that's supposed to be "Active VALVE performance exhaust"... *shakes head*
I kind of miss these top gear style reviews on a car. Mr Hammond would you do more pretty please??
Richard and muscle cars cost a lot of tyres lol
It gives me no pleasure to say that Rory or Matt Watson would have brought something better. Why not review in comparison to its ev mustang?
8:19 - A famous test Hammond conducts in every car he has ever driven
0:04 what a world we live in, that you have to put text there to announce that this car only has a lap seatbelt. otherwise people in the comments will cry about him not wearing his seatbelt.  2020 is such a joke,
So, from the video, if you're in to parking lot donuts, the Mach 1 is the car for you?
For a moment I thought Hammond was going to remotely control that car.
Desperately want one of these but annoyingly need a car with a back seat.
it's like a little The Grand Tour :)
I bet it still feels underpowered - would take the OG any day
Must need some very special tyres if it can drive at Mach 1.
Mustang always been a pose car , not a real muscle car
Oh dear,Make it into a morbidly obese slug and it's got to be better.Don't think so actually,bigger than the original by a huge amount and utterly bereft of any soul....................
A great review. You can't really compare 2020 cars to 1960s project restorations and I'm surprised people asked.
Did they use the word professional driver and Richard Hammond in the same context?
The top gear top secret testing facility, just off the a51, behind Tesco's
This Is a nice format to testing cars on YouTube And Hammond still alive After testing on "close Road" 😮
I'll be getting my first Mustang for Xmas, I just won't tell anybody it's made out of lego.
Green screen much while he's doing figures 8's?
"You'd need rockets on your car to do that and... that sort of thing generally ends up badly for me"
Would be nice to see Hammond going back to being a journalist, instead of a salesman! :|
3:30 looks at paddles... *closes video*
I half expected Richard to say; "They have dragged the Mustang kicking and screaming into the century of the fruit-bat", but I was somewhat disappointed. (GNU Sir Terry Pratchett!)
Love my Mustang GT -  and in Lockdown it was doing 4 months to the gallon.
Gas mileage? Who the f#ck cares about gas mileage???
This isn’t a review. It’s an 11 minute advert.
How many crowds has it plowed into already!?
imagine crashing it before i goes on sale in the uk
I prefer the Mach-1 headlights styling rather than the previous Mustang headlights
Will it be available with a manual transmission?
Active Value Perofmance Exhaust. Nice.
5:13 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Richard Hammond once said right hand drive Mustang is like trying too hard...
This was lame
Coming to the UK in RHD...fantastic 👍
Loved this, I find Richard’s at his best when reviewing cars, the comedic and poetic points perfectly describe the character of a car, beyond the mere functions.
Can somebody tell me why that pictures need flahes clip cuts swooshes zips and flashes not one single  change of picture without this ridiculous flashes zips and short circuit noises who in their right minds think this is entertainment ESPECIALLY WHEN IT EFFECTS  people with Epilepsy ,for Gods sake just film the clip NORMALLY ,
First of all, it's Richard Hammond AND it's a Mustang... and there wasn't a crash???
All in all for people who are still confuse about the point of this car. Ford made this for tuners. More room and clip ons for bolt ons, you can remove the fog light caps to install intakes with a ready built intake brackets, the exhaust system has extra brackets for aftermarkets and the ecu has a basic programmable tune easier for tuning, list goes on...
Wth is this music? I expected Richard to light up a spliff.
It ain't no Matrix just ask Scotty.
Cheap and fast and rear wheel drive
"Professional Driver. Closed Circuit."............   I thought it was Richard Hammond driving the car.......??        lol
After James one of the best Moderators ever, so fck off, you haters!
awwsome wish could have one love the vids thanks heaps
thankyou for this mini topgear series
“On my way to Ford’s secret test facility” Begins to describe the location of said secret facility
What a pity Ford had to dub exhaust sounds on to the video.
The HP/Torque numbers are off, I'm assuming on purpose....
Ken block might be proud of that little bit of hooning
the hummer has more HP and torque you failed
3:41 Richard Hammonds a Professional driver?
Perodua Myvi has done this years ago. It has 1.5L engine with in-line 4-cylinder producing 89bhp.
Does it still crash the crowd after leaving cars meets?
Richard,dobře odvedení práce!
ah yes the professional car wrecker drives the legendary crowd wrecker. what could go wrong?
Ford's secret track: Hammond: Proceeds to tell location
Does it try to eat pedestrians and bystanders?
9:20 ‘proper sense of history’. I’d say so. If those panel alignments and gaps don’t say old school ford, I don’t know what does.
This video confirms my theory: 99% percent of the people who comment car videos on Youtube are mom's basement dwellers 😂😂
Horse go very fast
Hi I'm 16 and just got my first car. Just happens to be a 73 mustang 🐎❤️
Hammond you idiot lol
Please guys, don't stop making these. I love this channel!
Gas mileage... LOL
" Horse go very fast"
Hammond is the most un-American American car guy ever lol. He sure loves his fords lol
When will it be launched
FAKE! Disclaimer says professional driver, but then cuts away to Richard Hammond sitting in the driver's seat.  Looking forward to the 18th for the next episode of the grand tour
Love you Hammo. Dont ever stop mate.
Here’s my $0.02 about the “professional driver” blurb
*I have a question for you; Will the passenger side dashboard crush your face if you come to a sudden stop (as in when hitting a telephone pole) like the 60s Mustangs? Oh and one other thing, Does it have independent Rear Suspension?*
At 10:30 couldn't describe the Mach 1 better. Then and now.
Richard??? Professional Driver??  I guarantee his insurance company would disagree with you.
Don't you guys think that this car is a bit underpowered and needs more torque? How about 600hp and 500nm of torque? I mean this is a kind of upgraded mustang from the factory right
love u richard
Still prefer the 2020 gt 500 a million times over this. Or a z06 or a redeye or my demon. Not impressed.
Along with the teeth bleaching, Hammond is clearly on the botox.
Wait. 4.4 seconds to 60, and only 155 MPH? Has to be limited... Right?
I think that Ford is making a mistake dropping the GT350 & GT350R as it has a manual transmission, lower price that the GT500 and it has the better 6 speed manual transmission.
I love all mustangs and everything about them
I'd rather drive the 67' Fastback Mustang
"Do not try this at home" Sure let me whip my unreleased mustang out
I don't think there is a better Mustang than the gt350r. It's the pinnacle, despite not being the most powerful.
Tengo un Mach 1 1973 for sale reconstruido 1,200,000. Pesos mexicanos
Come on Hammond... you didn’t need to do a commercial for this.   Please do a video destroying the idea of putting a mustang badge on a crossover
I’m afraid for Richard every time he gets behind the wheel of a high powered car..........let alone a mustang, I hope to goodness all car meets are canceled.
Horse go very fast
No shaker scoop...........as the 69 had as an option
Sweet! Looks awesome! Get em now before everything is all electric.
Mach 1 is only 700 and something mph at sea level. Go up to 20'000 feet and its about 350mph. Up at 60'000 feet mach 1 is in Veyron territory.
If it isn't fast enough, try spanking its back side. I've seen someone do this to a horse. It might work...
"Where's the new episode of The Grand Tour?"
Where's the hood shaker??
'Professional driver...' Eh.
No-one cares, that's for sure.
Shatboxes.
3:48 thats the wrong way Richard
It looks like a standard Mustang with a bunch of stickers and A few bits and bob's from the GT350. Standard operating procedure from Ford corporate. Big disappointment.
Hammond looking old 😭
My question would be, is it worth the price difference between a GT and this?
It's nice to see Hammond in a new car video instead of watching old episodes (either TG or TGT).
Well, in Patagonia special, he drove a Mach 1 too, sooooo
He parks his 1967 there in the road and a semi comes by and turns it into mush. Oops. 8-(
And he calls it a mac 1 not mach 1
You mean you’re driving on the correct side? 😂
I thought the new mach 1 mustang was 480hp
Where's the Shaker hood?
Horse go very fast
I wish we could get an alternate version of this video - with proper American pronunciations.
Lost me at putting the steering wheel on the proper side... it is American muscle... goes on the left... as always...
Surprised Mrs. Hamster hasn't forced Richard to install a six point harness and a roll cage in that '67 mustang let alone a regular seatbelt
Tonight, Richard turns into a communist.
I'm surprised that he didn't crash. Lol
It’s offical. I’m stupendously bored
So is this a poor man's GT350? I don't understand but I like the car.
“I bonded with my father over the mustang” ... SWEET HOME ALABAMA!
Yes I’ll be getting the Mach1 ( JLT CAI) - ecu tune on the dyno should get to around 530-550hp which is where Ford should have started.
This is like Disney+ releasing smaller side shows. Just that it’s the Grand Tour releasing them on YT
Man, I love Mustangs. If I could drive into the sunset in a '69 Mustang, I would
they finally ditched that dorky dude and got a real presenter back
Too bad the newer 5.0 sounds horrible. I miss the 4v 4.6.
Idk why Americans love big bulky engines so much. This car doesn't deliver enough performance given the size of the engine.
horse go very fast.
Is this how we're getting car reviews now? I really hope so. This is brilliant
he had to put on a helmet because they knew what mustangs are known for. luckily there were no bystanders on the side of the road watching.
Needs to be in Grabber Blue with a Shaker scoop.
>"LHD is the wrong side of the car" > RHD countries are actually the minority in the world
Nice commercial.
No1 Question I would think is "Will the UK version come in a Manual Transmission?".
"Secret facility" *Reveals location*
A couple of observations:  1)  Hammond did not crash, 2) cameraman is visible in the reflection at 2:16 and 3)  Hammond can pull this sort of manic presentation off while Chris Evans looks like a mad, dancing cartoon flower on acid wearing red sneakers.
Richard is this my mustang
Well now we know who is JOE
Audience: how much torque does it make though?? Richard (probably Jeremy too): oh that's easy, it's got 390 TORQUES 🤨😂
Sorry, but that car has the steering wheel on the correct side. It is our car (North American) so it is our rules, the rest of you fellows can fall in line.
This is what we miss about top gear, this kind of stuff
I may have missed it. Was there any other Mustang in this video except that beautiful  67 fast back?
"I'm pretty sure the Ford people can't see me."  I'm sure they'll see you when they need to pull you out of the hedge.
The ubiquitous lightning conceivably dust because cotton literally mix with a outstanding authorization. old, historical alley
Well that was fun. 😀
The wry anteater routinely charge because pond conservatively extend next a keen racing. successful, fortunate team
meanwhile......James is making more sandwiches.
This is what The Grand Tour should still include. Why they took away car segments baffles me
Love how all the top gear guys always make underhanded comments about the “right side” for the wheel. LOL. I barley managed to learn to drive left hand stick. It’s so hard. I feel like I’m 17 and learning to drive.
"Professional driver", I'm getting Rimac flashbacks
“”professional”” driver.   😂😂
$5 (or 5 quid for less civilized folk) says that this will be better than the staged fiasco that will be the Madagascar episode coming up.   I can't wait to watch it regardless.
gives such a grand tour vibe even when its not there. Thanks drivetribe :')
Hp is 480 and tq is 420....same engine as the bullet🤷
It's hard to believe that, a very big by British standards, a Mustang is popular in the UK.. it's big I think
How many airbags to protect the Hamster under rollover circumstances?
Another excuse for Ford to charge well over $50,000 for a Mustang...plus a big bag of tech driven WEIGHT!!!
Lame. A 4 cylinder AMG A45S hatchback can smoke this V8 muscle car.
The first proper car test in many time from one of the "chaps" , oh I miss those days at the TG track ... WELL DONE HAMSTER!
The reason I love original Mustangs is their amazing variations of V8s, and the fact it was basically the start of modern car optioning. Literally designed to be designed by the buyer.
Left-hand drive, as a Mustang should be
They let him go fast in it?
Haaaammonndd
Why does Richard look like he's trying out to be the British Tony Stark with that mustache?
The one word that already sounds British, he says "Mack" instead, oh Richard...
Do not attempt what? Driving it?
Ford should really bring back the classic Mustang body styling and make it look less rounded and plastic. Bring back chrome bumpers!
Next episode:Richard Hammod crashed the new Ford Mustang Mach 1
Hammond with a greying hair?!  What sorcery is this?!!
3:30 Richard is like a little boy on Christmas morning when getting into the car
those 0-60 times are terrible and to call it a mach 1 ... common guys
That laugh at the end...
Practice makes perfect for those cars and coffee Mustang exits 🚗🚓
Horse go very fast
Curious where he got his horsepower and torque numbers
Professional driver...HAHAHA More like professional crasher...LOL
If he pronounces it “Mack 1”, does he say “Mach Truck” ?
Oh great. Just another model the poor people at car shows are going to have to watch out for as their drivers fling them into crowds.
Why hasn't Hammond reviewed  the GT350!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“Horse go very fast”   Ok then.
It’s a beautiful car and a staple but 450 hp that’s so disappointing and 4.4 seconds to 100 it’s just lagging behind in my opinion
No pedestrians were harmed........yet
Mach 1 or gt500
I "though" the big thing about the new Mach 1 was the paring of the coyote V8 with the transmission from the GT350.........not even a mention.......  I was hoping the key differences that defines it between the GT350 and the GT.
I prefer the bullitt!!
Didn't he drive one in TG patagonia special ? I thought he would make a reference of it.
It's nice. However, the GT350R is well, the BEST. Cheers
Hammond you and electric cars don't mix mate. 👍 Oh i thought the title said mach e 😂 knock your self out pal 🥴
4 days until the new grand tour epsode!
The steering wheel on the proper side? Richard, I know you are the resident American but seems to have bumped your head. Have you forgotten what country the mustang hails from? I believe the wheel is precisely where it needs to be. Keep up the amazing work. I’ve been watching for years. You also can’t talk about MagnaRide technology unless you tell everyone that General Motors used it in their cars first. Don’t be shy, you know who they are. If you forget I can tell you. It is that other American company that makes another widely known American muscle car known as the Camaro. Truth be told, I would rather buy a ZL1 Camaro for 65K before I would spend the 60K it will take to buy a little better Mustang  GT premium. Oh wait, I did, for only 63K I was able to get a ZL1 1LE. Plus dealer fees. Yeah, I will take 650HP over 485HP any day. Thanks Chevy for making a better, more affordable sport / muscle car.
We need more car content like this from you guys. Gonna miss the old TG & GT ways of doing things. One thing I’ll never understand about Ford tho, why are their HP to Tq ratios so vastly different compared to Chevy and dodge? Who wants less tourque 🙄
Should of had over 500 hp.  Nice looking car but should have had the hp of the gt550  to really separate it from the regular gt
Ford missed the mark! I’d rather have a 2021 GT350.
Cameras and filming look great
the *wrong* side... yeah about that..
So the us version is it supposed to be more American, you know more power for no reason other than we like having to much of everything
They should have got Joey Lagono to do the test instead of this knothead !
Richard, the Mustang originated in the U.S. so the steering wheel IS on the proper side.
It has 480 hp not 456 you twit !
"Billericay Richie".
Ok now for the follow up questions.   1. Would you buy one?     1a. What color are you going to buy?
Thought new mach1 had 480 horsepower with 420 fps of torque
Not that much torque to be planet twisting. Come on Richard. A diesel focus produces just a bit less than that
5:16 that sound...they got the v8 rumble just right.
and.... crash
As nice as the new Mach1 is, I would rather have Hammond's 67 Mustang over the new Mach1.
If it's a better handling version of a Mustang, is it really a Mustang?
"planet Twisting 390 torque" Dodge demon makes 760 with yawn
Just another Bullitt.  They did away with the GT350.
More of this! It is the boring part of top gear that I didnt realize that I missed.
Ok Alpaca..😎
Mustang infomercial. Can rent a gt here at Budget hire car with the same gear. Special?
Thought it was 480hp same as the Bullit model.....guessing 480 on US Premium gas....
The steering wheel is already on the proper side.
Hideous car-V8 Yuk-no electric option-killing polar bears with copious amount of carbon is not cool
Is it legal in the U. K. to drive a car on the motorway without a shoulder belt? It isn't here in Colorado.
Hey Richard? Did you happen to see the poster at the 10:30 mark of your video that shows how to I actually pronounce the car's name? Mack is a truck brand, Mach (mawk) is the cars name. 😉
"Professional Driver" 😂
When they going to work on the styling?
Richard is now required to wear a helmet when he drives in fear that he will have an accident
Richard, can the ride be adjusted individually like suspension, steering, exhaust and throttle response separately?
Looks like it still goes like a piano on an ice rink.
This give some top gear vibe
Love that car. The noise,  the colour just everything...apart from the price I'm guessing.
Who else said so many comments in Clarkson’s voice?
Hammond and a mustang??? Someone’s gonna die. 😳😆
What did they do? Pack the motor in cotton. It's too quiet.
bring back GRAND TOUR!!!!!!!
Ford sponsored a mini Grand Tour episode. Thanks!
Mac 1?? Atleast learn how to pronounce the name
Anyone else think it sounded very quiet? II expect that thing in Sport or Track to sound loud and immense!
No louvered rear window cover??? Fail!!!!
More like this please. Now that TGT has switched to specials only, this is a great way to keep the car reviewing segments from Jeremy, James, and Richard that the fans also loved
Thought this was going to be a video about a new electric version
I am still concerned every time Hammond gets in a car.
They missed one question: "Does it still eat spectators?"
Nah that wheel is on the correct side
where does drivetribe ask these questions?
Love it
the real question is does it look like a children's plastic doll house in the interior or is it plush like James Mays living room?
what's a mack 1?
so its a GT350 but they put a mach 1 sticker on it.....got it
Wow, that 67 Mustang is absolutely stunning.  Sod the new, I'd just love to have the classic car.
Is Hammond science its own sect of science that really proves nothing and is just him playing?
My opinion on the new mustang   I’d sell it for a old mustang
Professional driver 😂😂
Hammond should do the new mustang bullit
Anyone for a remake of bullet
"Mack" is not an Austrian name.
“Professional driver” with multiple emergency helicopters on stand by
Richard hammond just love mustangs
What's its lap time round the nürginbürgher?
Here on for you dodge charger or mustang
did hamond  just use critical thinking
I'd take Richard's car over the newer model all day long.
Here in America the Mach 1 is 480hp, my 2018 GT has 460hp stock but I’ve got some bolt one which help a bit.
it's just a few stickers and a tune
That added exhaust sounds did not fit what was actually happening, it freaked my freak
Thank you DT, Ford and Richard Hammond for the video review! I'm waiting to get a GT (which I know isn't exactly the same as the Mach1) and can't wait!
I like how it said "pro driver" ha. Also liked this kind of thing would like to see more
I'd have a '67 Mustang or the first new GT over any newer ones any day...
None of the new Mustangs will ever be classics like the old one,,,plastics is never classy
Lol Grand Piano on an Ice rink, that is honestly super clever
This was just like an actual GT segment. Hit me right in the feels :( we need more of this.
Horse go very fast
“It works” lol
I like how they moved the car reviews here since they stopped on tgt
Thats the RIGHT side for the driver. Youre all wrong there in UK changing gears with your left hand. Admit that already.
They will never know until someone gets one best car ever
I really miss this, Thanks!
Where is the new episode of the Grand Tour?
aslong as the Hamster keeps it upright :)
that is so paid to be said. this mustang has nothing in common with the originals. yes, it is better in every single way of performance but the fact that the old mustangs have souls and an incredible out of place style gave it just sense to have one. the newer models will never be the same style nor the same feeling as having an old mustang.
Mustang special edition
‘67 mustang. Fast back or not, IMO that is the single prettiest car ever built on American soil. Not as cool as the GT40, but I reckon it’s prettier
"But there is I'm afraid, a problem, a big one...it costs £????."
Ah yes my favourite unit, "the torque", I've heard it's defined by the moment of one weight acting on a length.
So they did a better job than LR with the new "defender"
Hammond: I am about to hop in the wrong side of the car Also Hammond: *Driving his 67' Mustang on the left hand side*
It looks tacky af, sums up Mustang perfectly 🤣
Finally, a proper Mustang
The joke at 0:08 never gets old 🤣
At 5:15 Hey at least you can joke about it now, but after that crash we are all glad you can do anything now... :-)
Nice one i like hammond and i like when i watch the grand tour and top gear
If I name it Eleanor will I have it taken off me?
Great to see the car reviews rolling. But was this sponsored?
It's not a "Mack 1" it's a "Mach 1"
YouTube says “top gear also watch this” 😂😂
And how much of that sound is computer generated
Is there a part 2 which doesn’t include a paid promotion?
That car looks awesome nice job ford!  when I graduated HS the 03 mach 1 just came out and I drooled over it at the time and now I'm in a position to actually make a move this might be the one 😁
Is it me or is the mustang badge on Richards mustang at the front isn’t straight... any comments?
3:42 professional driver 🥴
Ah yes, the bargain bin mustang.
Just a suggestion............Nah....someone working there might get upset..............but yall smart enough to figure it out.
Put it against the Mach E 🐎
Wow he let that car survive
What happened to the Defender review?
If Mach 1 flies in the air or on land?
The Steering wheel is on the left side which is the only right side
Who thought to put the worlds most famous car crashing presenter in a rear wheel drive crowd mower
"Professional driver" ;D
What’s an active ‘value’ exhaust?  Must have been reading from a script with a type-o.
Don't wear that jacket again.
The whole “secret test facility... just off the” was funny the first time, maybe the second, but they’ve beaten it to death worse than Gaddafi in the streets of Libya.
Wow Ford is brave for letting Hammond drive it on a track. And I am i grateful! We need more of this!
Still not as nice as the 69
Would have been nice to see more of the interior and dash.  Very few design references to the original , in my opinion.  You arrived in a classic and tested something that shares the same badge but without the the visual excitement. Just seems to be a computer designed version of what Ford think we want.  Not impressed with the "new" sterile Mustangs and this fits in nicely with them. Come on Ford you can do better.
I'm sure Ford prefers "Just a little off-the-track" to the  ""A little on-the-roof" testing Hammond usually employs.
Am I the only one who thinks that car is not really "mighty” in terms of performance? There is, and this is true, a Dodge Hellcat
Hammond the secret American
Yay Science!
Hunkered down? It's almost as tall as him!
1:27 an I crazy or is something leaking in the engine?
Professional driver. Who u fooling with that
He looks like T Bag
450 Horsepower...that's it???
I want James to react to The Magic School Bus (the original 90's show). The bus is based on a 1970's Ward International bus. If you want to look for clips to use, the most accessible and best quality episodes are on Dailymotion.
It definitely needs more fake vents, other than that it looks really nice. I've come to like modern Mustangs recently, but '69 Mustangs are still my favourite.
I fail to see the point of this mustang variant
Is it available with a manual?
As a former mach1 owner (gave to niece) this is a PP3 not a mach.  Edit: FoMoCo, you dropped the ball.  So hard...
Richard Hammond is zaddy 😍
Soft Limiter?
Congrats Richard, very scientific!
Hamster for Spokesperson for Mach 1? Yes.
I almost didn't click this link because I thought it was going to be the battery crossover thing with a Mustang badge on it, pleasantly surprised it is not.
Hammond, I would take your mustang over the new one any day of the week, with a seatbelt upgrade ;)
Is it a muscle car or a pony car? Everytime I say the Mustang is a muscle car some pedant American would chime in and say it's not, that it's a pony car. So which is it?
Haaa! Robocop reference!
Not in reach of common people. "Dream car". Vehicles are to get one from to  A to B. Preferably dry. Performance? Get a F1.
Yes! More of this!
Those Brits with all those hatchbacks. Please remain in Europe.
Enough with the disclaimers already. Seems the nanny state has now really moved to youtube.
Would people rather have this or an M2 Comp?
Richard long time fan and my 15 Roushcharged car is upgraded, suspension, tuned, injectors 650whp.. blah blah blah.. I'm contemplating getting this do to the tremec manual 3160.. but is it worth it or buy a used GT350?. 🤔
I think it's ridiculous that they have to give a disclaimer about the car only having a lap belt.  Have we really regressed so much that our fragile constructions of right and wrong and personal responsibility need to be be placated by needless declarations?
Hammond + Mustang != Crowd (that's not equals in computer speak)
hammonds stang is stunning
It’s nice but not for the price
What a dumb naming convention. So the Mustang Mach E is a fat elelctric SUV And the Mustang Mach 1 is a top performance combustion sports car?  How about they call their electric like the Thunderbird?
if hammond is a profacional driver, why did he had those crashes in the past?
Boring
Err.... more of this please and get the other 2 involved aswel, couple more segments and the odd special and we’ve got a show again 😉
Hammond should give his thoughts on the new Ford Bronco
Great to see Richard & Co. doing normal or ‘normal’ car reviews again. Something very soothing & correct about him doing his thing 😄👏🏻 A lovely reminder that they are still in the car game 😎👌🏻 #forever&ever
So it’s detuned over there? Here in America it has 480hp and 420ft/tq.
theyll put the steering wheel on the proper side. Bruh like 3 countries out of more than 150 countries drive on the WRONG side of the road
Professional driver? Hammond? Really?
The steering is on the right side ... Duh 🙄
Anybody else want Richard to Narrate their life?🙋🏽‍♂️
Is it me or has he started looking a bit like Paul Chuckle?
They took the car known for crashing into crowds and got the driver known for crashing. Then said “what could go wrong?”
We just need James to turn up in something ridiculously fast, but of course he’ll stick to 2mph below any speed limit. And Jeremy to arrive in something German, then we’ve got an Xmas 2020 top gear special on our hands
First of all, automatic ewwww. Second, sooo it’s a mustang gt with the performance and with some Mach 1 stickers? That’s lame. Third, the Mustang Bullit is way better. I thought that it was going to be sort of like the corvette grand sport, a mustang with the Shelby suspension but with a slightly tuned coyote engine.
exhaust sounds fake, and also the editing leads me to believe, it has 19 gears...
It gets 480 hp in america
“Professional driver. Closed circuit” So Richard wasn’t driving then?
clarkson would be driving it around wembley stadium with a celebrity on the roof :s
So it's Hammond Proof?
Hey Richard, is this the new Grand Tour episode?
Hamster and Mustang : a better love story than twilight ❤️
Ugh ... this is like the 1994 version or 1999 one ... uggo!
No misfire with this car?! All the others have at least one when tried by Hammond
All the dislikes on this video are from Camaro owners 🙂
Hammond: "It's got a MASSIVE V8!" Boomer Americans: "Uhhh, ummmm..."
My horse goes fast.
Here in the U.S. the Mach1  makes 480hp . Did they de- tune the car for you Britts?
so it a Badged Up GT With Stickers And GT350 Parts
What the f**** sounds like a farty machine
Love this mustang but I think I'd struggle navigating Ross highstreet and the lanes in Walford
Richard would you let your wife or daughters drive one? Would you be going into cardiac arrest everytime they go out?
“Theyll put it on the right side” brother youre getting into a mustang, if its not on the left side then it’s wrong
i liked the way that it said 'proffesional driver' when he set off
actually mach .15
Please do more of this kind of stuff. Great review.
Its not really filmed in an exciting way. Third unit filming?
So Les power than  a supra lol I smell a marketing ploy
Some say he's still driving the 'Richards loop' still.
So, how much did you guys get paid to market the car?
But you got in the car from the left side..?
Was the lap belt disclaimer really necessary? Do you like insulting your core audience?
I know we were in control since he didn’t crash it.
About 30 less hp than the American version that has 480 hp
Does the manual have the same mt82 from the gt or the tremec unit from the gt350?
I'm glad you've found an outlet for these test drive films after the Grand Tour's grand reformat.
You knowwwwww you're stratosphere famous when you're infamous for crashing many million pound cars and nearly dying but STILL they call you to drive their new car first... #feelinghimself
Huh, so the Euro Mach 1 makes less power than a regular North American Mustang GT.
I have been waiting for so long for a new review of a car by any of the trio so this has fully filled a hole here
To be faaaaaaaair. /Letterkenny
09:26 looks a bit wonky...
Thank you to Richard's wife Mindy for allowing him to drive a car quickly so we can enjoy his review.
I wish they would have found a Mach 1 for the vintage comparison, not a '68 Bullitt.   The one thing I was hoping to come from this Mach 1 to be consistent with the package, was a different engine package. That's what made the Mach 1s special. Not just a PP1 GT mustang with an appearance package. Wish they would have brought out a modern 5.8 liter version to be more on par with the old 351C or 351w for that matter.  A naturally aspirated version of the 5.8 trinity out of the GT500 would have paid homage as a true Mach 1.
Says its secret, announces its exact location to 52k people
Mach 1... Why not Mach E?....
Wow, does it have the "flappy paddles " instead of a proper standard shift?
So at the end of the day it is a Mustang GT with the PP2 package and the word Mach 1 everywhere  LOL
i love how they crash in crowds
A very poetic waxing about it and excellent demonstration of slightly less precise driving than can be seen every week at Auto Cross meets, but realistically how does it compare to the latest from Shelby? The true bar of what a "Mustang" can do?
I just finished every single Top Gear episode with Hammond, Clarkson and May yesterday, the somber last episode took pretty hard. Finished all of them in under 2 months. It was really nice seeing this being uploaded thought, it's not yet over.
Many years ago Hammond bought and imported a Dodge Charger. But not any more.  :>)
Nobody Richard Hammond- BigMach
Still handles like a muscle car
Блядь, какой же Мустанг этого поколения красивый! Буду много работать чтобы купить такой.
Well, the original mach-1 looks way better than the old one. Period.
There is not mutch Mach 1 in 450 HP today.  Maybe it was mutch 15 years ago.  But today it’s The power of a hot hatch.
Professional Driver 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Its pronounced Mock 1 not Mack 1 its American it's not up to you to decide how to pronounce it.
I love how they gave him this new mach 1 to review which is supposed to be amazing or whatever. Then give him an auto which ruins one of the biggest  advantages of the new mach 1 which is the fact that it has a new manual trans the same tremec  unit in fact from the gt350 and 350r.
Will they put the pedals on the correct side too?
lol 69
I imagined some random white dude watching this and saying "Murica" 😂
pretty car, shame they forgot to put paint between the primer and the gloss coat.
The best thing about Mustangs is Steve McQueen.
Wow the euro Mach 1 makes less power then an american version of a regular GT. I love mustangs but this Mach 1 is not worthy of replacing the GT350 and not really any better then the BullIt.
Looks like Said Hammond now....
Please do more reviews like this more often... Love the trio❤❤
I love hamond’s car
That new mustang ain’t nowhere near as pretty as the old 1
Love it. The looks, the sound, the spirit behind it. though I have to say one can see the bad gap dimensions and the bad alignement of trims even from 12 ft away. the joints where the doors close ..why u do this ford? I wonder if they HAVE to make it that bad so it classifies as an american car.
boring
Very cool and a NICE car!!!!!!!!!!!!!     👍👍👌👌👍👍
"active value performance exhaust" - wait...wut
Does it come with "Crowd Control"?
nice car....... but the video?
4.4s. So it's slower than many SUVs that have a V8.
*professional driver. closed circuit*    👁👄👁
My father had a 69 Mach 1. Bought it right off the showroom floor in 1970. He had the loaded version with the 351 Windsor all in Gulfstream Aqua.
Pretty sure Ernst Mach didn't pronounce his name "Mack".
Worst figure eights ever, bad hamster
Wonder how much ford payed him for this
DriveTribe : "Please send us a question" Rest of World : Provides question USA : Let me talk about myself, my history, any recent deaths in the family. Oh, and eh, you wanted a question ??
A Ford Fiesta ST with maybe a few tweaks would outperform the mustang in every aspect. As once Hammond said that people think that harleys' are fast and they aren't; the same applies to the mustang as well. The only positive thing about the mustang is that it's rear wheel drive nothing more.
PARTS BIN CAR
Doesn't everyone just love Hammond's MUSTANG?
Do the UK / EU models have different emissions requirements or tuning? Both this and the Bullitt Mustangs in the EU performance metrics are a lot lower than what we get in the states for the Mach I and the Bullitt we get 480 HP / 420 TQ. The European spec wing mirrors are strange too lol.
Isn't it just a rebadged Bullitt?
Why the big difference between hp and torque.
It's not MACK 1 it's M-A-C-H 1
Stop bullying Richard about his past crashing. I would feel safe if he drove me anywhere
Professional driver........really,did you not pay attention.....did you not see who slipped in behind the wheel....did you
Top gear is back!
Somebody paid ALOT of money to insure that car when they found out who was driving
An 11 minute advert.  Like Hammond needs the money.
Mustang is not supercar, so he can't crash it
In the U.S, this model is rated at 480 HP, why the difference?
Wait, is he driving on the right side of the car for a change?
Those huge UK spec side mirrors look rediculous.
Jesus who mixed the audio, my sub is trying to knock my walls down
MacGruber to Sunny : "That was a BLAUPUNKT !" :)
Wheres Richard? Whats al pacino doing here?
How does the Mach 1 handle around crowds?
Hammond misread the active valve exhaust lol
I used to live in Essex, a few miles down the A127 from Ford at Dunton.  I have a couple of friends who work there in the design dept.
Richard... I have appreciated all that you do.  I still do... An excellent introduction to a very nice ride... thanks again!
Kind of slow don’t you think?
I wish it was the US spec
DRIVETRIBE without Mike is epic!
cheetah faster than horse in short distance
Sorry for your loss Scott.  Hopefully the 67 Mustang you are working on helps your Grand Father's memory live on.
Not one of Richards better reviews,  I suspect closely monitored by fomoco big wigs, ie you say something bad about our car and we won't let you review anymore of our cars. Kind of like the new bronco review ford allowed on another youtube channel that was just a rolling prototype.
Strange beard and hair dye..he looks like david guest..lovely car ..
I like old school mustangs because they have slim lines, it is not too big, it has the right size. But the new one lloks like it has eat all the McDonals hamburguers twice.
454 horsepower and 390 lb/ft? Do the UK mustangs make less power for some reason?
Very
Cool
Right but when is the new episode coming out HAMMOND!
LOL 51K USD FOR THAT
Dear Richard. With the new magnetoheorological suspension will it be able to leave a car meet without spinning out and bashing into the crowd? I can’t bear to hear more shouts of “he too old”......
This is more like it. The Ole presenter coming back out.
thank you for bringing Richard hammond
Mack 1
And only 400hp it should make 700
I had a 15 GT pp that I traded in after 4 years for a new 2019 Bullitt. It was a pos. Traded it in on an M4 after 4 weeks.  May consider getting the Mach 1
what i lke is it can stay in usa and ruin their sleep
390 torque in a mustang really I mean it is a mustang it should make 700
I'll take a hellcat any day. These haven't been muscle cars since 2015, when they looked like MUSCLE. Edit: oh sorry for the UK didn't realize they can't get any
He needs to worry more about his wife seeing this video than Ford.  😆 Also I want to see his thoughts on the C8 Corvette.
But how well does it jump curbs and eat crowds?
Mach 1 is no more than just a glorified GT! Marketing hype!
No, no, you're getting in the correct side of the car. Can't help that the UK has to be different from almost the rest of the world.
Shame they couldnt get that shaker hood into the new Mach 1. It's just a huge break away from every past Mach 1..
this is why i subbed to drivetribe
He said 454hp but the base model makes 460🤦🏽‍♂️
Here for the crash.......disappointed 😔
"Accident Prone Professional Driver"
I watched this so I could see the underside of the car    I was dissapointed
its not the mach e....
I thought Hammond had had too many accidents so why would he get into the "vehicle" that is guaranteed to crash. The most dangerous thing to ever, irresponsibly, be allowed on our roads.
Underpowered imo
“Off the track testing” Nice to see that you tested that technique with the Rimac.
I have a Mustang.  With the right tires it performs wonderfully.   The stock all seasons were awful!
The exhaust sounds pretty terrible tbh not very nice
"Professional driver" you guys no it's Richard Hammond. "Professional crasher" is more accurate
That gunmetal grey rims are beautiful.
I recently bought a 2020 Mustang GT, do I now have buyers remorse? Should I have waited for this?
No hate to hammond or anything but.... "professional driver"😂😂
No 1 has got it. Ford wants to get publicity for the mustang they know he will crash n make the news
Cool
I was kind of bummed when I heard the Mach 1 was coming out,right after I bought the Bullitt. After hearing the numbers glad I got the Bullitt. Almost the same but the Bullitt has more power
Al Pacino got younger
Sience with only ( Richard Hammond )  ......Just only
Now lets see how fast it goes around our Ebol-- oh wait you don't do that anymore...
tonoit on bottom gear; ski instructor meets crocodile wrestler vlad is 24 years old and richarf horse go very fast
This feels like the grand tour and I absolutely love it!
Uh ... no no no .. the wheel is already on the proper side ! :P
My dream car is the 67 mustang 😁❤️
Best Mustang Mach 1 Ad ever.
If you guys came out with a series with the trio reviewing new cars. You ratings would go through the roof
Will the Mach 1 have the same 2020 GT500 no warranty at any track events?
Looks like a Fusion at the front.
Also I'm glad to know it goes left *and* right.
im surprised richard didnt crash as it was a left hand drive car
So that's what you call it when you go off the track
Oh so its a really high-quality production because its a paid promotion.
Isn't calling it Mach 1 false advertising?
Professional driver . Closed circuit. Do not attempt. Well, two of those things are true.
"Professional Driver" 😂😂😂😂
Hey, where's the new episode of The Grand Tour?
This is as wierd as the review of the Ranger Raptor... come on Richard, you dont need to do this
"You would have to strap rockets to it, and that sort of thing usually ends badly for me".  I'm glad he said that. I wouldn't.
Mustang Mach 1 is like a beautiful wife who can handle anything.  Or should I say Everything.
I love how they call him a "professional driver"
"Professional driver driver"!!! How many times as the Hamster crashed and or rolled cars and to the tune of at least a Million pounds. Yup very Professional for a stock car racer/ demolition driver.
how much did ford pay for this?
Horse go fast
"Professional Driver", a very bold statement for Hammond.
I always get a grin when someone in Britain or the Continent calls a 5.0l “massive”. I’m so glad I was born in Canada and grew up looking at my neighbour’s 426 ‘Cuda. But then I’ve been to the UK and have seen what you poor buggers pay (have paid) for fuel.
I love how it says do not attempt but its no one can attempt because car is not out yet
Great to see more Hamster ❤️
“Professional driver”. Hmmm.....
ELECTRIFY IT!!!!
How is the 0-60 4.4? Doesn’t the GT do 3.9?
lets liven this up a bit, put a crowd on the side of the test track it will wake up the pony !
"Hello Richard, I am Vlad and in Soviet Russia; Mustang drive you!".
Forgot to check if the vents on the hood are fake or not. Don't worry, I know the answer.  They're fake.
'This video is sponsored by Ford.' So drivetribe is giving up impartial journalism? Goodbye.
0:16 did he just say MACK one?
So yeah it’s still going to hit a crowd looking at that testing
can you drive it to Argentina and come back in one piece?
4:54. The Stig!
I love the Mustang! When is it released? I want to buy one!
5:27 same name. If you are reading this Derin where are you from?
I like the hammond has a passion for classical cars and has a collection of some of the best classic cars including Oliver
More money than a hellcat dodge, half the power.
I thought Richard had some drift training before. But this 8figures were awful
Wow nothing about the car.   Hundreds of insults to Hammond.       Car guys.   Don’t waste time reading comments from peanut gallery.   Useless dribble
Don’t crash. 155 mph top speed is quite slow. I demand at least 180
(Professional driver) shows Richard Hammond
It's been a while since I have seen Richard Hammond present and it seems really weird now. Like he's Tony Blackburn in a Carry On movie... Has he been like this for a while?
That last little "he-he-he-he" as you did the final round of science around Richard's Loop is really all you needed to show.
I would rather your old one
try to drift it near a crowd
Looks like all the other boring modern Mustangs. Zzzzzzzz. Makes you realise why the whole  world loves Italian styling.
But we still dont know....Does it give James May the fizz?
Why is the power so much lower than the one you can get in the US? 480hp, 420tq.
Well done
Great car & video, Hammond on fire. Original Mach 1 not considered the best looking Mustang.......
The best front design IMO is of the GT 350. Absolutely perfect proportions!
looks like hammonds been dying his hair again
3:44 I am not so sure that Richard is a “professional driver”
Surely its false advertising saying mach 1 .. these no way that car is reaching mach 1 speed 😳
car sounds too muted :/
ha ha ha. Planet twisting 390Trques. ha ha ha. My 2.0 Disel has 415NM
We need more reviews!!!! Keep the specials for the Grand Tour And get the latest cars and review them here and we'll handle the view count 😎 This was a GEM
95% of the comments are bullying him about him being a professional driver.
only one question. Richard, will we be able to see the bottom of the Mach1? disappointed if not
Y’all remember when the mustang was a V8 with wheels
The fact you have to say lap belt only is disgusting.  Actually the fact that there are people that notice and decide to make it their business is even worse.
I'm surprised that no one asked the question"does it come in a manual"
Do More!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why not keep review segments on this channel!!
how is it Americans havev such big block engines yet so low horsepower?
4:32- "Mustang has an active value (Ahem..not Valve)  performance exhaust"
Does it come in automatic or strictly standard like the bullit?
To be fair, you did ask a question to a bunch of mustang enthusiasts, so don’t expect much.
I don't have a Mustang, but watching this video has made me want to take a drive in my 96 Buick Roadmaster sedan and see how much fun I can have with the LT1 and about 4200 lbs
Nah sorry just don’t get em
Haha i love how every post made by Jeremy Clarkson, James May, Richard Hammond, Drive Tribe and the grand tour is flooded with comments saying when is the new gt episode
nice Peugeot Hammond.
The mack 1😂
The MPG is very important, if your quarter mile time is less than you MPG then you are wrong
They still let Hamster drive new, fast cars?
Sorry Sir, you are not funny in this video. And it is ' Maach 1 ' not the way you say it. Having said this, I admire you very much.
Why did they have to do so many edits/cuts when doing the figure 8? That's so annoying!!
I've always taken exception to the false advertising in the Name. "Mach1" Implying that it will exceed the speed of sound. It won't, even if you drop it out the back of a cargo plane and light the JATO bottles! OTH if you were to drop it from LEO? It might get to it then....... Don't even get me started on the ridiculous price. $53,000USD .
Ah no crash test.......
That doesn't look like an Electric SUV, that must be an old model.
You'd think with the accidents, Richard would want better seatbelts in his cars.
Mustang owners are just Audi people with less money
Just because you put the steering wheel on the 'right' side, doesn't mean it's the 'correct' side. Here in the states, the only people that I'm aware of who drive from the 'right' side of the car, are postal delivery workers. To be quite honest, I think the steering wheel should be in the center. Because personally, I don't care if there's any room for passengers. I like driving alone.
I have some bad news for original Mustang lovers. The Mustang was a Falcon underpinnings with a new body on top. Sad but true.
Topnotch argumentative testing! Excellent job done 👌
EUROPEAN SOIL?   DEVIOUS, very devious.
3:01 Apparently he doesn't know who "Macho Man" Randy Savage is 😂
"You'd need rockets on your car to do that. And that sort of thing generally ends badly for me"  Hehe
I’m from Billericay, not far from there!
Why Mach 1? What does it mean.. definitely not speed of sound.
INTRODUCING THE MUSTANG gt performance pack LVL3
3:42 are you sure about the « professional » driver part?
WHERE WE'RE GOING WE DON'T NEED THREE POINT HARNESSES
Science!
Professional driver that's crashed alot more than most of us😆😆😆😆
richard hammond the most British American in the world
it wouldn't be a Hammond test drive without a little offroading ! ;-)
Hammond is amazing  Definitely in the top 3
Mac 1. MacDonalds, Mac n Cheese
New car, should be atleast 500 bhp
What is it like going down a narrow alley on 2 wheels, lean over.....my name is Bond....
He never answered where lambo chevy was :(
The 6 Mustang that Hammond did the intro in still looks so much better, though i am a fan of the new Mustangs
The Ford people definitely didn't see that
Missing the 428 cobra jet
That Mach1 must be detuned for the UK, because here in North America it makes 480 hp and 420 lb-ft.
No shaker hood? That’s one of the signature of a Mach 1.
It's a shame they didn't let you test the manual since the Mach 1 manual uses a new Tremec gearbox
The moment the shoot of exhaust pipes came up, Im like meh, next... ICE are fun, but 99% of miles driven I dont do on drag race, so EVs only please. With those fun is guaranteed.
In my opinion the best looking mustang
Not so top secret anymore lol
I infinitely prefer the Mustang he drove to Ford in ; beautiful.
horse go very fast
Planet Twisting?...  You'd need 5.202 × 10 (or 5.2 decillion) of  to bring our  from stationary up to its current , in one second. That's 5,202,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  of torque
No, that is the correct side to drive that car from...
Contains paid promotion. It was all paid promotion. Poor content imo especially for UK viewers.
tire smoke go skirrt?
Everybody asking about the grand tour but I look forward to watching this. It gets back to real cars in the real world.
I'd love to keep seeing car reviews on here, as the Grand Tour is just the travel specials now (which is awesome) but these are a great way to keep getting content.
3:43 Professional driver. Everyone: *heh*
Define "Professional Driver" cause I dont think Richard is one.
It's nice and all that but I would rather have the original 1970 model.
the little giggle at the end just seals it. hammond is completely bonkers over cars
Hammond and a Mustang? That'll end well! All it needs is an exit of a Cars and Coffee.
It looks amazing 🤯
I can't wait for the new Mach 1 to come to Canada. I love it.
What is the difference between the mach 1 and mustang gt?
I still prefer the old 1967 mustang and Idk why...
The magic is back! Thank you.
I love Ford Mustangs. My favorite is the 2011 Ford Mustang I know it's 9 years now and not as powerful as the others, but I just love it.
Sad to say but the most boring video I've seen you do Hammond.
Should be in a GT350R....
Why isn't he wearing a seatbelt?
Oh my, I thought it was Mach-E, meh. who cares about ICE engines at this point?
Richard hammond
it's just a Boss 302 with a new badge
Does the Mach 1 have less horsepower in Europe? The base GT has 460hp/420ft/lbs of torque in the U.S.
PROFESSIONAL HAMSTER IN A CLOSED TANK DO NOT ATTEMPT
Does it have a solid rear axle?  Or is that something they finally fixed?
Why would they not put the gt500 engine in the new Mach 1?
I understand our transatlantic cousins have some differences in pronunciation, but to hear someone call a Mach 1 Mustang a "Mack 1" makes my teeth clench a bit.  Think "Mock", not "Mack".  : /  That being said I love all three GT hosts to death and have been a huge fan since 2005.  Just wanted to toss in my 2 cents.
Its pronounced mawk
I don't think it should be called a Mach 1.  The older Mach 1 had a beefier body than the other Mustang.  This is just a hyped 2020 GT.
3:41 Professional Driver?  Where?
This was great. So glad to see Hammond not taking his videos too seriously and adding humor.
FYI: Majority of the world drives on the left hand side of the car. So the correct side is LEFT!   Also Germany made the car and germans drive on the left side SO THERE!   sry had to get it off my chest.
Don’t crash it !
The "Mack" 1.
Mack Wun
Mach-1? who cares. Mach-E though...
Why would you do that to your beard? :(
That's not the first time a Mustang tyres have squealed in Basildon!
It's so cool how they've got that old reliable format working on YouTube in 2020!
Where's the usual guy? The one with the speech impediment?
HAMMOOOOOOOND
Someone needs to tell that guy that mustang's have handled great for like a decade now.
For those in North America if you’re wondering why It’s only 454hp compared to 480hp. That’s because the passenger side header has to be compromised in order to fit the steering shaft. Which interferes with exhaust flow lowering the horsepower output
3:41 did you just call Richard Hammond, of all people, a 'professional driver'?
3:44 "Professional Driver" Not sure about that one.
Our neighbor has a Mustang, and what Hammond says at 4:40 is absoluteley true, I love haering it in the morning, but the other neighbors not so much lol
I’m surprised that Ford let Richard drive the Mach 1 around a corner given his history
Are you gonna try the electric one I saw it on Unbox Therapy but I know you'll do a better job
0-100 in 4.4 feels so slow in the era of super fast and super heavy family sedans.      It isn’t
No shaker hood
Me when the
but is it better than Mach 3 from Gilette?
The "professional driver" part got me 🤣🤣🤣
Waiting for the crash
Richard's loop usually looks like more of a Mobious loop. It goes upside-down at some point...
Awesome 😍💋 💝💖♥️❤️
I like the mustang and Ford but honestly.. Those power figures are poor by todays standard, I expected more from a *5ltr v8* in the 21st century 🤦‍♂️ maybe if it was 550 bhp and 450 ft lb so it's a big MEH from me...
classic cars are just beautiful no doubt! if you agree like this comment
Well, seemed at first like a straight-cut commercial for the Mach 1 but by the end, I enjoyed the wholeheartedness of the whole material. Also, I do like that Mustang.
90% of comments are just bullying Hammond
i just want to know if this going to be a limited edition
"It's fast. Of course it's fast! It's got a massive V8!" Hahaha
professional driver??
I love it when people outside of the USA call a 5.0 a big motor 🤣
'Professional driver'!
A friend and I bought a 69 Mach 1 back in 82 from a junk yard. We put a 9" rearend under it, 4 speed wide ratio trans, and a 351 cleveland engine in it... We had a blast and the car was great fun to drive... In a straight line... No curves ;-) We painted it with yellow Imron paint with the black stripe, looked great and sounded awesome with that cammed up, Holley 780 carbureted cleveland!!! What fun!!! A great shame the youth of today will never get the enjoyment of tinkering all weekend trying to extract an extra 5 HP out of that engine :-)
90% of the comments are just people saying he’s not a professional driver and I love it
"I'm about to go into the wrong side of this car" Americans - "Wait are we supposed to say that?
Oh yes.
When  will you crash it?
Advert
It's so sad that you have to inform viewers you're wearing a lap belt that can't be seen, thanks to all the Karens and Kevins.
Oh hello, one of the trios doing a car content? Merry X'mas. Okay, jokes aside, i really miss them doing car reviews/content. Thanks for this Drivetribe.
This feels like old Top Gear 😍😍
Does it have an extra 40% of front body with nothing on it
Richard's loop is revolutionary. We should get ready for other people to copy this procedure.
If you name a car "Mach 1" and it does not go nearly as fast I call it a scam.
Says "Professional Driver" in the warning blurb, but never mentions "Flammable Driver" as is the case with Richard
Am I the only one who prefers Richards Mach 1?
2:10 Joe mama
Which would you rather Richard? The late Mach1, or your Argentina Mach1?
This is definitely the car for Hammond
4:39 "Active value"? I think the scriptwriter had a little typo there and meant "active valve exhaust" heh
I'm expecting review of new Ford Bronco from Hamster... Like if you support my idea
Since when has Richard become a professional Driver?
SO HYPED FOR FRIDAY
Ah dude you did omit the comparision with Roush. That is one we enthusiasts need, all this color you give is is just the color.
Hammond the American
3:45 Did I see it wrong?Someone wrote that there was a Pro-driver in the car.I wonder about Jeremy Clarson's comment.
3:42 professional driver? I thought Hammond was driving?
Awesome!! I hope R. Hammond does more of this remote control projects. Thank you.
"I'm heading to Ford's top secret test facility... Just off the A127 next to Billericay Town Football Club" ahh, never gets old
I see the corridor hat at 10:26, love to see other CD fans on YouTube :)
3:44 Professional driver? Rimac C1 would disagree.
Hammond the secret American
Ery noice hammie
Glad to see drivetribe is acting as a hold over before the new TG :)
When The Hamster is behind the wheel I always wear my seatbelt adapted to my sofa, just be be safe... you never know!
"Secret test facility"
Professional driver = Professional stunt driver for crashing so many times, like a pro
You have to spend $200,000 to get a European car with this kind of performance.
How many onlookers can you mow down at a Cars + Coffee meet with the new Mustang Mach 1? That's the important metric we have to consider! 😂 Btw, isn't there like a 760 hp version? 😱
It somehow sounds like a twin cylinder motorcycle lol (At least in the video)
What....no shaker hood?
" it works" "it's fast" getting gd at the reviewing lark hamster.
Man the old Mustang he was driving was much better nothing beats that
3:45 Professional Driver... wow Ford are brave
Who knew Rod Stewart could do donuts
This is literally a TG/TGT segment, it's lovely to see again
Landon was here
I cannot wait for mine to get here this spring!
I see you got your resident American do the review.
A Mustang on Youtube that isn't being crashed is a rare thing.
Love the video per usual but, Whomever his mating the exhaust sound with the driving needs to do much much better!!
Yeah right, Richard Hammond a professional racing driver.   3:43
Ford commercials are getting better.
Wilderness, freedom, V8 sound, feeling that I dont need to prove anything to anyone. I love how it make smiles on people faces and I know there is someone smiling like me when I was young.
When it goes on sale in the U.K., it will have the steering wheel on the right and the wrong side, simultaneously.😁👍
How does it compare to the Mach-E?
Will it use a litre of engine oil every 500 miles like the GT350?
I dont think its special enough to be a Mach 1, Maybe because we are surrounded by Shelbys, Gt350 and standard 5.0s over here in Florida  , its like seeing focus St's and Rs's in Dunton where this was filmed and where I'm from lol .
No Manual, No Thanks.
Cool seeing a bunch of Marylanders on DRIVETRIBE!!
Hammond go very small.
This is so mint. Amazing content. Old school Top Gear reviews with modern feel of audience engagement. Great stuff 👍👍
Does it come with a blaw plunk? Did I hear that wrong haha
I'd love to see the new one in the same green as that 1970 in this piece.
"professional driver" hahah wait till Clarkson and May getta load at that!
I’m 25 seconds in and he hasn’t crashed yet. Am I missing something?
Ford letting Hammond test drive the new Ford Mustang. Ballsy move.
Tune into this episode to hear Richard Hammond impersonate James May blabbering on about magnetic shock absorbers.
I always wanted a mustang, but surely I will only get one someday, hope it's before my 60's.
The camera man must be running  very fast to catch up with the car.
The sound is loving  The car should have been V12 not V8. This car must have power more than the Dodge
About time mustangs can finally take bends
Luckily the Mustang is not as fast as the Rimac prototype 1
Will  it  really  go  the  speed  of  sound  as  the  name  suggests ? 😂
This is awesome
Just keep hammond away from the Mach E Him and electric cars dont mix
LOL.  Proper side driving.  There are 163 countries and territories that drive on the right side of the road, while 76 of them drive on the left.
So is this just a UK thing? What is the point of this car when you've got the 350 and 500 above it?
The 1972 Mach 1 is the sexiest Mustang Ford ever made, change my mind.
Honestly disappointing sound. Sounds silenced or something.
01:31 your rear left tire pressure is slightly low 👌
I wish richard hammond would drive the corvette c8
A top speed of 155mph, what’s the point in that?
Makes you realize how much you miss actual car segments on Grand Tour.  The adventure stuff is fantastic but "car go vroom" segments are great too.
I can already hear Jeremy call out. "Hammond you blithering idiot, this isn't even a scientific test"
I love that they used the comments 😂
Car is beautiful!!!! How much more powerful is this over the regular gt?
Secret testing facility
Holy shiet.. top gear reborn in drive channel nice
Should be red and have an undead (Richard) Charles Bronson driving it!
Ford literally want to get rid off the car giving it to hamon... Professional driver 🙈
Mustang=crash Hammond=crash Hammond + Mustang = Panic
Typical american "Hunk-of-Junk" ... over 5 litre engine, and only 400 HP (European cars can do that with 2 lt ..) And holds road very well ... on banked corners .... :)
My Buick nailhead has fifty more ft. lbs of torque in a 700lb lighter body. No cats, no _check engine_ light, no smog, and around 22 mpg highway fuel economy.
This is literally more interesting than Top Gear.
4:00 I actually thought for a second Hammond crashed another car xD
“Professional driver; flies off the barrier”
"Professional driver, closed course, do not attempt"...... I'm assuming the video editors never met or seen hamster drive then?
Pleeeease can this channel fill the void of no more car review segments on the grand tour more 🤩
I loved my 73' convertible with 351 Windsor and mach 1 hood so I'm a hard sell on anything too new
3:44 “Professional Driver” I’ll believe that when I see it 😂😂😂
I love how they call the location "secret" but give the detailed information immediately after.
Be great if ford made their 2021 mach E after that mach 1
I dont like ford cause their were the reason of the leman laws on smaller  engines and the Shelby cobra led to the speed limit
Aside from filming grand tour. Clarkson is doing a farming show, May is doing a cooking show. What is Hammond doing?
Who else thought they let him drive the Mach E... and was a tad bit concerned..
Richard Hammond drives the new Ford Mustang Mach 1... and crashes.
In a race of endurance my 1.4 Civic would  win.
This just looks like a regular 5.0 with a livery 😂
Why was there no crowd hunter questions Richard? Nevermind thanks Derrin
Unlike other muscle cars new mustangs look better that classic ones
Do ford know who they are letting drive it 😂
This format for car reviews was fantastic.
*New Mustang* <- "This is brilliant"  "But I _like_ this" -> *Classic Mustang*
American made Fords just fall apart.
I don’t see the professional driver here?
So Buy a GT350 is what I took from the 1st 2 mins
Professional driver
I swear man it's painful watching your heroes growing older
Glad to see this bless my feed
That's a really fancy crowd-killer!
23rd
Ooooo such videos bring back some beautiful memories of my childhood growing up to the best series of top gear
I love my 04 Terminator Cobra
They let him go on the freeway this time?
Hi. spread love. drive fast save time. Go home early spend more time with your family unlike people who drive slow. cheers
Veight Motorr - Clarkson.
HAMMOND, DONT SEND IT
Hello
Hammond testing cars...   What could possibly go wrong...
Wthhh I was just watching a video on Instagram with Richard Hammond then I got an YouTube notification on this video
Stunning!!!
I’ve never clicked so fast
I'm always happy to be reminded of the old top gear vibes
Nice, wk roofers using their phone to take a photo at 0:15 Expect a knock off the plod, bellends.
Hi
Hamster rides a horse
So this is sponsored by Ford. I wondered why there wasn't a single nitpick
first or second ?
Man that classic is so beautiful though
Yoyoyo
Hi
Helloo

First
Getting famous off comments day 201, so I can live the dream, live everyday like it’s your last day🚀🚀
