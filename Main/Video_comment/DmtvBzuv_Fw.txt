We need to see the stock chevy spark run the quarter for a baseline measurement against crouton!!
Need more mopar stuff.
Honestly looks like they took that money and just totally reinvested in the company. Its grown so much. Hope the new building improves things even more.
I just watched a 30 minute ad, and I enjoyed *EVERY* minute of it!
Thanks for the great entertainment.
Cool
A tremendous business deal. Well done on bringing this together.
Ya can't go wrong with Haas Automation...!
Wanna send my project pics I'm disabled I have one hand and can't ride anymore and not rich lol so it's a ratbike so I can ride again just wanna finish her up God's will soon tho love you guys keep ripping brother
Always need afew extra hose layin around
Is all the stuff that motion sells strictly race car stuff or do they sell stuff for stock applications for LS
So fukin proud of this bloke and the crew
I know this videos old now but I remembered it and I’m looking for info on a packaging machine like they use for the vacuum sealed packaging!
My God!! That was baddest donuts I've ever seen! Freaking epic!
Being a certified CNC machinist myself for the last 12 years, this is awesome that you guys invested in this American company. I would love to work for these guys.
I always thought Cleetus was a dizzy Youtube kid, spending daddies money making silly videos. Boy was I wrong. Huge amount of respect, for all you guys have accomplished on the strip, the amazing team you have assembled, the VERY smart business decisions you have made. My humblest apologies, you guys are incredible. Rock on, cant wait to see where you go next!
OH wait, this was a year ago? I just submitted an email lmao
9:20 brother please make this into a shirt lol
We use pretty much all HAAS CNC machines for all of our Goodwin University Advanced Manufacturing programs for hands on instruction. We have the Northeast regional HAAS office 15 minutes from our university facitities.  We are SO fortunate here in central Connecticut to have a very large number of global scale companies that need folks with skills in the sort of high level CNC, material science, quality assurance using CMM’s, and high level scanning and 3D print prototyping along with production all these companies engage in. Our programs are literally filled to capacity every semester now and we are now consistently getting inquiries from all around the country from companies just like Motion looking for highly qualified entry level employee candidates. It’s just awesome seeing the growth of this sort of advanced manufacturing here in the US destined for the US markets that reaches far beyond just the aerospace and medical industries who are making highly expensive products outside of the consumer markets.  The amount of consistently steady growth in consumer level manufacturing coming back to our shores here in the US to create and solidify a separation of the dependence on Chinese manufacturing is so damn satisfying to see happening. We see it growing so steady from the most important indicator which is the demand and search for properly educated/skilled employees. A lot of folks don’t realize how many of these success stories like Cleetus is creating for himself all get started while working in a productive environment where a great idea is inspired and the person finds the motivation to go for it and take the leap to make your own company.  Successful partnerships like this can offer SO much creative satisfaction as well as a lot of terrific solutions. Congrats Cleetus for taking that next step up!! It’s great seeing you share the ride along with all the ups and downs. It really is a great motivator detailing the realities of the whole ride and not just the feel good stuff. I’m really enjoying it along with an obviously HUGE number of other folks. Great stuff!! 👍🏻😎👍🏻
Helllllll yeahhhh brother
That Machinist looks like Joseph Joiner LOL
Chip Girls lmao it's The ChipAnDales
Congrats brother's making your future fun !!!
We need a jack stand range
Love, Love, Love !!
Most of these parts are better die cast, forged, stamped, or drawn. Especially that valve cover will weigh MUCH less being drawn from a thin sheet of aluminum. Also much cheaper to produce that way. The US has fallen in love with milling but in most cases it is just a way to sell overpriced fancy looking parts. If you are making more than a few prototypes there are much better ways to make most of things and only machine the finishing steps on a few of them. Better look into production machines instead of overpriced Haas prototyping mills for everything. You spend more on milling cutters in a month than a 500 Ton press costs.
Fuckyeah
1:04 🇺🇸💣💪😎
Just needs a promo code!!!
twin inlet intakes in different styles
Very good move and i really happy for your succes sir
The head machinist looks like Seth rogen LOL

I am Logan Mia from Mississippi am a member of the Illuminati  which have been a part of since 2010 ...Would you be interested in joining our organization too gain financial freedom and safety from the government and its games Wanted too share an insight of our organization the Illuminati we are currently open for new membership
Sad where already going into the last year before his accident 😞
Whats the kind of machine shown at 21:56min ? Thank you
Cleetus looks so different, lol..
Congrats guys, fantastic too see you guys take the next step in your partnership. I've been watching for a few years now, since your First stick shift GM in the 7's in the world achievement. And about that time I started watching the Boosted Bois, another YT channel thats grown leaps and bounds along with PFI speed.  Which reminds me, it might be in your new business ventures best interest to promote signing the RPM act, as I've recently seen a few of my favourite YT channels that the EPA has ruthlessly come after company's selling performance parts.  And they are fining for every part sold which in a company like Motives, that would be crippling... As they are saying any vehicle sold with a VIN is not legally allowed to be modified, even for 'race only' components. Which considering a lot of cars were built under homologation rules to be eligible to be used for touring cars and one make racing, so I don't get how they can make such draconian rulings. But its the U.S. Government, screwing over the little guy having a crack at making a better future is kinda there thing, as thats what happens when corporations donate to both parties like they're individual citizens, especially when every industry is heavily monopolised these days.  I honestly wish Garrett, James and the Motive team nothing but the best of luck and hope to see more great things.  I know it looks like you guys just have fun and get paid, but I know how long and hard you guys must work behind the scenes, so you deserve the success as far as I'm concerned.  Take care guys, and hope to see you at our next Summernats, it'll be my very first and hopefully as an entrant. Would love to let you take my car for a skid, would be wicked as!  Anyway guys, stay safe, and keep the beacon of freedom that is Cleetus shining bright.  From Brisbane, Australia.  Much love.  Jay
Talk about one long infomercial, lol…thanks dale, lol..
Imagine how much they must of spent,and make from YouTube..some ppl just getting lucky with hard work..
This video is too damn funny, I love Cleeter's sense of humor.
I'm a CNC Programmer, I'd love to work with yall.
The blue looks cool but that branded black covers are clean man so happy to see you guys moving up
Gee I wonder why the EPA is going after off roaders modify ing cars
27:43 IOWA!?! wOOt!
thats pretty cool man
Really hope there’s some 5.3 parts on there so I can put some of the fruits of your labor into my own truck. Looking forward to it fellas👍
Hope the EPA don’t shut down this operation
I need parts for a ford 302 plz haha  Old foxbody rocks on
Love what you guys do! It's so awesome to see how far you guys have come. It's gotta be so great to be able to have so many great partners and then be able to buy into them, that's just awesome!
1600 parts available and only 1/4 is made in house?
🦅🦅🦅
Thats how its done. A1
Good burnout.
Watching the vacuum seal was so satisfying lol
Oh those are Ford parts , nevermind  Hahaha best part lol
Congratulations Man
Niiiiiicely done, you petrolheads ! Only one really serious question remains : Imperial or metric system ^^
Those are some amazing Haas cnc machines.
Congrats to you guys love to see the deal worked out!
Theres an untapped market for mopar stuff. Theres hardly any support for hotrodding dodge its definetly something people would buy
I have a discontinued s10 chromoly trans crossmember. Is it worth anything??
Those elbows would be a good candidate for additive manufacturing, ie 3d printed and sintered or laser layer printed.
Should do the amurica valley and valve covers too
whats with all the Bots commenting the SAME thing with different accounts?🤔
Congratulation!!! Congratulations!!! Very good move. Made in the USA!!!!! Yeah brother we need to start back the "Made in the USA" movement.
I want a boxer so bad
I like Cletus McFarland just as much as the next guy. But there's no effing way I would put his name on my valve cover
No Mopar stuff?
Hell yeah Brother  🤘🇺🇲
Do stuff for miatas
Hell yeah Brothers congratulations on this wonderful Endeavor in a huge way.
F! The epa and let's all go catless
The intro gave me goosebumps and I shed a single tear. 🇺🇸
Freakin' awesome
Sold out of all the gen 4 ls stuff.  Good for you bad for me.!!!!!
"can I stare at it" lol 12:30
Well done legend!! Keep killing it!!!!
1320 fan please help me out with some merchandise
Chip girls 😂
It makes me so incredibly proud to watch the YouTubers that I grew up with becomes so incredibly successful
That was a good burnout.
Brother those bad boy heatwaves are z87 safety glass, you don’t need those clear boi safety glasses
Motion can get bent. Mopar or Nocar baby.
Where are your masks ☺️
Amazing job guys....  Please get motion to start developing GMT400 (obs) parts. Even more on gen 1 small block parts.
I literally live like 45 minutes from there! Omg I wish I would have known u were coming
Meh. Just looked at the site. NOTHING for Mitsubishi, Nissan or Honda.  PASS.
I'll take a job. Master mech and Jack of all
Congrats.
Congratulations! This is such a amazing journey , been a fan as everybody here since day 1.   Incredible how you guys are able to keep on captivating us fans.
It's smart to invest in what you love!
I’m looking for forged pistons
Your life is a dream come true.  So jealous!
Do they have their own Anodizing facility on site? Can you get hard anodized parts or no?
Could paid me to be your programmer, setup operator!
Can they make parts for my Viggen??
Sorry, but I'll be dammed if I'm buying a part from motion that says "hell yeah brother" or some cringe cleetus saying. I'll gladly take my money elsewhere.
No freaking way, DeWitt is my hometown! I had to replay that part like 5 times. Out of all places, my small town of ~5,000 people. 😂
Hell Yeah brother!
That’s awesome brother good luck ! There a lot of room to grow there are so many vehicles that people start with low budget that they don’t make parts for at all just something to look at i had a 4.0 ranger and completely custom machined lifters and cradles for it I would have mad a killing if I could have made more sets for others at the time so many more motors that you could make custom performance parts for pretty sick next truck gonna get a set of anodized blue valve covers for sure
in Australia we call it smoko time
The head machinist is Seth Rogen in disguise.
That's a win win for everybody
Should offer red white and blue
That's awesome! Happy for you guys!!
Dude I got freakin cold chills! This is badass! Hell yea brother! What a move! I'm damn near speechless!
I'm really happy for y'all. Hell yeah, brother. Hell yeah.
Brother cleet you are the American dream incarnate
You guys need to design some adjustable lower and upper control arms for s10 or blazer chassis they already have an extreme in the shop too build off of it’s perfect the s10 or what I know a lot of us 4.3 vortec guys need is a intake to run LS style injectors if you made one I know at least 50 people who would buy on the spot
Awesome guys, congrats! How about making some high flow coyote heads... we’ve been neglected by the after market. Something that flows 400 to 450 cfm for the old dog...
I'm absolutely certain that's the first time I ALMOST teared up at a burnout. You guys work hard. That intro was something else. Congratulations.
Hell yeah, Brother 🇺🇸
Why not a red left valve cover, white valley cover and blue right valve cover? Cleatus
Good on yeh guys, best of luck to yall! Helll yeeaaahhhh brother
All those people and not one mask what a surprise
Now that’s a burnout!
Congrats on the partnership...
I’ve literally been here since the very beginning and it’s unreal to believe how far you’ve come in such a short time, really happy for you no one deserves as much as you do. Your hard work never goes unnoticed we appreciate everything you do for us and thank you for the month of freedom💙 hell yeah brother! Do it for Dale, and do it for Ed!!
👋🏻34222☀️🌴🇺🇸” Congrats 🍾
Congrats Bossman, well deserved!
heck yea! MADE IN THE USA!
Sweet! Machining is where power starts. Are you hiring cnc programmers or machinists?
Thanks for making it easy for me to pick where to shop for parts for our LS fleet.
You know what you probably already have a great name for the merger, but I like "Cleetus in Motion" Gratz guys!!
HELL YEA BROTHER!
That nitrous explosion in the beginning was hilarious
YES!
Definitely spending my hard working money on USA made parts, fantastic work of art!
Holding out for the cleetus edition low rise manifold steam line kit!
So proud to see this channel grow and be as successful as it is!  Truly enjoy watching every video!
And that's why I don't spend a penny on this guy. Lame talking about investing millions. Like we can relate lol Jesus rich people are dumb.
Ford blue valve covers for my LS swapped ford. Well played. Very nice!
@ Cleetus McFarland promote Dogecoin and y'all will blow up even more....Motion Raceworks accepts Dogecoin for payment via Bitpay, and BOOM
Shot-out to Hass American F1 race team! ✊✊
Nuclear explosion of Branding here
Cleetus, just hit me how cool it would be to do a burnout at your track with a Blackhawk hovering above! Smoke swirls would be epic!
someone unironically named you cleetus i hope it’s just the channel name and not real that’s unfortunate
Vote all demoRat left wingnuts out! ASAP! Vote all demoRat left wingnuts out! ASAP! Veteran-U.S. NAVY SEABEE!
now thats what you need to do if  you come down and do summernats again???
If you need a parts manager, car enthusiast and dreamer hit me up. I'm 39 years old and have wanted to live in Florida for most of it.
Sweet baby Jesus that burnout was killer
Dang man, first a race track now a partial owner of a major parts company?! What you’re doing is amazing and it’s so awesome to see how far you’ve come since your days at 1320, congrats man!
2 minutes in and I've already teared up AND belly laughed. So much love guys, been with you from the start ❤
That was pretty stupid to toss a 10lb chunk of aluminum in the air expecting someone to catch it...
What about Diesel parts like Cummins
oil dipsticks that lock so oil cant shot out of the block when u are in high rpm
Puts it in 3rd and floors it  "Wow he must be Australian"
The new merch is go fast parts lol #huge
I'm not crying you're crying
Man...just man Happy for you cats  Great job
I'll definitely give the guys credit. James and cleetus...living life, doing what they want to do and love to do. Living life on their terms. Great to see
Very cool guys. Congratulations
Man that blue w the flag looks so good an clean. Now if i only had a race car I'd order some
If a business is kicking ass and making money, why would you sell 20% of it?
Let’s gooooo
Time to "re-tire" them burnout shoes 🤣
Proud of you guys thats a big move keep the parts moving god bless guys keep it up
Congratulations guys. Pretty cool
That burnout would get an a+ from an Ausie
Hell yeah that’s awesome y’all living the American dream 🇺🇸
I wish I lived in the USA and could meet and rip cars with these guys but no I live in the shitty uk haha keep up the good work guys
You just gonna forget about Texas speed like that
Yeah baby part made in the USA ! Woohoo 🎉
That has to be the most Australian looking burnout done by a American all of Australia approvers of that good luck with your business venture
All I can i say as usual yeaaah budddy
Offering black instead of blue is a great start. What if I want your badass parts, but I don’t want your name written on everything!?
How would someone click on this then dislike it? I wish you and your crew all the best what a journey. I was happy with you finding Leroy. Lots of love from Australia come back some time and visit Melbourne you can see my Fugly 1960 F100.
DAMN! Jackstand stackin' some dimes there! Nice weld brother!
Additive Manufacturing is what you should be researching
Please make some American flag valve covers 🤞🏼🤞🏼
The dogs are cheap labor too huh they take a couple bones as payment 😂
Now you've gotta buy into Texas speed, and summit racing. Cover the whole market with your freedom
Anybody know the song playing the the background
Tha Aussies taught you welll
Congratulations Fellas.
That’s respect, crazy how far this man has come. I remember watching him on 1320 for the first time with the drag Camaro. Keep her pushin brother!! 🇺🇸
HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!  Man this makes me so genuinely happy. From the days of try to hit 9s and then 8s, and then 7s to this. You've come a long way and we are all so proud of you. Keep those bald eagles screeching! 🤘🤘
pretty darn cool, do wish there was more   bolt on's out there for the Cadillac 2.8L (Don't laugh) its what we got, and  out here  its  working with what we have  not what we wish we had......
Idk how I missed this upload. I first saw this channel because I wanted to know what would happen if I pulled my electric parking brake while driving. Then you went on to do something amazing by adopting a salvage corvette. And kept growing untill you literally bought a freakin race track. Now this. Congrats man. You are the only automotive youtuber that I never got tired of.
Sure know how to make a grown man cry during a burnout... God bless, love you guys! HELL YEAH BROTHER, THE "DO IT FOR DALE" PARTS TO COME!
Buying ruby and telling her story = the most rapid growth this channel has ever seen, the viewers loved that content and the story behind it. I got nothing but support for you guys, y’all are always on the quest for more freedom and knowing/seeing it come to reality just makes it all the more better. It really would be a dream come true to work under you and Jeremy and just wrench to my little hearts content.
HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!!!!!! MAKING MOVES AND WINNING
Haas machines are very nice
We want kdm parts lol
Why do you keep saying "Motion Raceworks"?   "Because they pay me every time I do. It's a really good way to make money. If you were soo smart, why didn't you know that?"
CH3NO2 the secret?
Did this really start from a Drag tour 69 Camaro? “One thing, I wanna make clear is this thing was built in America, and so was I”. God bless you Garrett, always a pleasure to watch your videos and even more so to have a chance to chat in person. Cant wait for the next LS fest brother! Good luck on the future
This is brother material !! Do you make mk2 golf parts 😂
Fuck yeah boys.
What would really change your career is saying the N word on youtube, don’t get offended it’s a joke
Most people shake hands to close a business deal, but not Florida Man.
I hate to rain on y'all's parade but that Dr Pepper machine in the breakroom is a definite red flag!
ah so i see Subaru sponsors the canine dept in the shop.
Haas machines too. One of the last American CNCs
When the peice fell off when he was trying to weld it, I woke my kids up I was laughing so hard,  oh boy!! 🤣  classic.  dude the absolute best move you could of ever made.
absolute unit dude! NEVER CHANGE CHAMP!
Got goosebumps watching that intro
Congratulations to all involved!
Congrats!
Public Service Announcement:  HAAS is last in formula 1 because of their machining errors and inability to coach talent.  HAAS CNC  machines might be a one way ticket to bankruptcy, invest with caution.
Pray for Cleetus, for he has installed HAAS components on his normally functioning automobile.
love to have taken the journey yall have created for yourselves while doing it right and being realy yall inspire alot of people to do things out of there comfort zone as well as me taking a leap to start my own shop (when i can afford a building just in the garage for now but all great merica businesses start there ( ill get there) i do vinyl color-change  wraps,hydrographic(hydrodipping), and custom fiberglassing audio systems, and basic mechanical repair thanks and congrats on further  improving yourselfs and your familys as well as eveyone who watchs yall keep it up and let them bald eagles fly  SNAPCHAT-@HIGHOCTANEWRAPZ E-MAIL- REBELSTEEL2311@YAHOO.COM
I can't believe there are no comments about that skid.... dude is getting so good at those now. Your next Summernats people better watch out
For life!
2:06
Smart move thinking like grown men I'm sure u guys will have some good input on future parts. Great video great content 👌.  Primo
I'm so happy for you guys, well done
Cleetus “neverlift” McFarland
Can you make a catch can that looks like a can of mtn dew??
Instead of a "sell out", you've become a "buy in"! Rock on, brothers!
Well, if the car parts don't sell, you can contract with the military to lay down smoke screens on beach landings but you need bigger flags and waaaay thicker tires.
I used to work at Walmart for SFS shit man put me in coach, I can definitely dust ol homeboy in packing😤😤🔥VTEC will kick in
Dirty jobs feat cletus 😂😂🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
God dam that burnout gonna make me cry, so loud like omg that would have been nuts! Awesome!

Mans building an empire! Congratulations!
This is great to see...I have a bigger want list
This is the future of manufacturing. :)
Awesome!!! 🇺🇸💪🏼 I run a 5 axis CNC machine everyday and love it! Nothing like making cool stuff!
Can I recycle ur aluminum chips
Awesome! Motion Raceworks is in DeWitt, IA. Just 20 minutes north of where I live in Davenport.
Need to offer a package with a 1 red valve cover, a white valley cover and 1 blue valve cover.
Hell yeah brother congratulations
Most people when they say “big announcement!” or “something big is happening!!!” Is usually a new line of merch, or something not many people would take notice of. But this is one hell of an announcement
Hail yes....
id do alot of cool things and help people if i had money too... your not special
nice to be born in a wealthy family
Now this is content
Some of the realest shit cleet ever wrote
So sick. You guys are the best
Wow, I'm going to have to get something with an LS setup just so I can get cleetus parts...
Hell yeah brudda!
I guess I have been spoiled by the usual video quality
Hell yeah brother
You need to help @goonzquad’s new build
So happy for you man. Come so far. Living so many of our dreams daily.
Loved the way our nations flag looked during the burn out and smoke . Ready for war and battle!!!! 😍🤩
Hell yea brother
Glad to see you’re part of motion i got my steering shaft and wheel and joints from them can’t believe how light the shaft is
As a welder that part where cleetus tries to tig weld had me dying lol
As a machinist myself, this made my day
Congrats and god bless!
Hell yea brother. America! F@&k yea!!
From an American to another thank you for investing in an American company. I am a Tool and Die maker and Machinist. I lost my job 15 years ago to a company overseas and took my several years to get another. Thank you for honorably doing this.
You guy need to buy 50+ brand new car/truck chassis. 50+ big block. and make the 1st freedom factory production car ...cant say its modified and illegal if its from the factory!! and get going with the resin injection molding work so you can make mix of aluminum and exotic material like carbon fiber/kevlar. Keep pushing the limits!!!
Great video congratulations
I have not subscribed yet but I drop in on respect for the yeye”
HELL YEAH BROTHER
Hell....Yeah....Brother...
Is cooper not part of the gang nomo?
i hope jack stand doesn't leave this channel. looking like they were 50/50 partners in this deal.
I live in Bettendorf it’s about 15 minutes from Dewitt this is so cool, we need a Quad Cities Cleetus and cars!
Could you do a video where you explain who owns what (cleetus,ff,..) and who works for whom? Or is it just a group of muricans and floridamen enjoying their freedom?
Hemi parts please…….
does the burnout count as the "biggest move"? 😅
Nicee
please make metal intake manifold 05 to 2011 police  crown vic and other stuff
Welcome to DeWitt IA.
Horrible shipping rates to Canada. $37 USD for a $18 shirt.........um no.
HELL YEA BROTHER!
Does this mean Cleetus will blow up more things now that he an unlimited parts???  Awesome partnership.

It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die.  This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true:  Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said,  "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery  already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said  "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying,  thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten  Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or  guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not  God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son  to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that,  while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the  dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who  confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do  that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a  wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God  will never let you down.Visit NeedGod.com.
Amazing decision and bright future ahead for you all gents 🙏❤️💯 Bald eagles all the way send from Quebec much love to you all 💪💪🚀
I just saw cooper pouting in the corner with a sign...."please watch my channel"
I'm glad you've decided to do this. I'll sell your stuff.
Hell yeah make us IA boys proud!
13:00 You gotta smack it and say "That's not goin' anywhere"
HELL YEAH BROTHER
Who'd a thunk it. Great work. Doing good stuff made in America.
Ok, is it me or does the head machinist at 5:54 look like a ginger seth rogan?
Take that rig to summernats that was a good burn out
Finally an American who can do a decent burnout
i have a feeling this summer is going to be crazy
Sucks the views are dying and I'm Sure your not making all the aussies happy cause they think their the mecca of car parts
Pause @7:19 Ol Cleetus explaining to the ginger version of Seth Rogan how this is going to go.
@14:00 you showed every scraper where to go find endless supplies of chipped up aluminum man... I think you just lost your 20% of the business right there, but then that blur that can be corrected afterwards to see the part, I won't say what it is for now but you have to pay me to keep it hush hush man! It isn't personal, just business man.
Hell yea brother!  That's awesome! Watching a local channel take off has been awesome. All your guys hard work is paying off you totally deserve this! #madeintheUSA #BALDEAGLES
The welding hahaha
That’s living the dream right there. Happy for you guys
I wonder if cooper ever wish he stayed with you guys
Do a cloverleaf in a burnout that was the thing in the day up here...
I do not own a race car but I do own a Harley. Any chance you will make a few items for the guys on two wheels?
Encouraging to see dreams manifest! Let’s get this party started!  This will motivate a lot people to make the next step and git er done
Am so excited for you guys. Followed you since 1320 and day one on your channel and watched you grow. So proud of you guys. Best wishes from South Africa.
that elbow is over 500 usd. damn
First adam LZ sponsoring himself with his own company and now good ol' cleet here now owns a piece of a company, well dang, hell yeah!!!

I just don't get it you think buying 20% of this company is bigger than buying an entire race track? I think buying the drag strip next to the track would have been a bigger automotive decision, you can get parts for free from sponsors.
i ll be dipped!! old Cleeter is getting serious on the hot rodding and fast cars
Man I’m so happy for you guys Iv been following since the beginning and seeing every step
Seth Rogan is there head machinist??
Holly shit great burnout!
I’m glad y’all are doing so well and making generational wealth by opening and partnering with businesses
Very cool. Many freedoms, much America.
Shout to working class bowhunter eric hamann hard at work! Fuck yea!
please make barra turbo parts for all us australians 😫😫
You and motion should do tools call them tools of freedom
Congratulations guys! Ya'll keep pushing forward. 👍
I had a good friend that pass away and he was a lot like Cletus. Cletus reminds me of him a lot
Congrats you 2 meat heads. Couldn't be happier. Big love from DOWN UNDER 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
This is cool
Yall will be the greatest research and development team known to man testing your own parts on your own equipment.
When does the dr.pepper machine get swapped out for a "skeet" machine. Brand loyalty son.
Those billet 90° elbows must be insanely expensive.
@lunkerstv out here working for motion, securing that bag
I imagine, that constantly being "Cletus" is exhausting. Furthermore I doubt most of his audience knows that he's playing a character. The constant, "Hell yeah brother!" Would break my spirit.
Why does this remind me of dirty jobs lmao
Great job on the big deal! BUT aussies will always do a better burnout 🤭😉
Would be cool if Cleet just walked around and signed random product packaging.
i think it a good move you have been working with them for years
I would love a nitrous plate kit that would be amazing
You guys should do a video on what you're going to need to go turbo
You just like the comments coming from Youtubers, I bet they didn’t do anything for you to help you be where you are, but it’s ok, hope you don’t loose your ground, hope this coments makes you Pay attention to your fans, the ones who spend 💰 to make all this real.
That’s F’n AWESOME Garret and James!! Congratulations!!!
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BILLET SUNGLASSES
Holy jesus how tall is cleetus?
Congratulations guys. Nice move!!
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iscO9yxp9wI&t=6s
MENGA MINT!!!🔥💯💎😎
James needs a mic i can’t ever hear his mono tone voice.
HAAS!!!!! There making Formula 1 parts Guenther is the man!
Can’t hit the like button enough !!!!!!!!!
Glad cooper left.. he looked like the little brother who got picked on.. he’d be wishing he stayed. Why did he leave?
From a bit he created for a 1320 video to owning a part of one of the biggest race car part manufacturers in the country.
How much for the pupper doggo?
these guys aint messing about !!!!! who feels like buying new throttle bodys after that !!!
Really guys $600 valve covers lmao
Cars and trucks and house's way past due to be flying the world ages behind so do the mind as it turns faster than the mind rotateing
Have no idea what you’re talking about but good one
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Nice
@cleetus check out Scorpion Racing Products. Made in the U.S.A.  Located in Ocala,Fl
Holy shit that's awesome. Don't worry about those tires, they'll buff out
Congratulations
This is honestly the best thing I have seen. Congratulations you guys!! I have a great idea for somthing. I actually am wanting to do it to my daily. I drive a 2004 infinity g35x awd. I want to TTLS swap it and keep the awd. So mounts, the plate for the motor to the trans to run the stock trans and even plug and play stand alones with your branding. Mabye with a partnership with another company. You can now create anything of your dreams. As well as your audience.  You inspire me so much Garrett. Thank you for all of your videos. I would love them to be longer. But I appreciate everything you all do. I have started my channel. I only have two videos so far. I would love to one day be as successful as your channel.  Thank you for reading. God bless 🙌🙏❤
Brilliant advertisement Cleetus, love your channel as always!
Funny jokes about exploiting the working class guys you got. Too bad they don't have all this hard earned youtube money 😒
Motion Racewerks just need to get their FFL 07 to make some really cool stuff.
Cleetus working in the shipping department is priceless... This guy is the real deal.
Billet bald eagle key chains!!!!
Cleetus Mcfarland is a FREAKIN LEGEND!
Congratulations
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I got an idea but not willing to share with public
I have some warehousing space if you need some!
This what I love about American automotive manufacturers they go big or they go home. The end product are Awesome, looks to die for on the car or motor. If you see them you want them.
chills man....
Let er rip tater chips!!
Motion Raceworks should add a full lineup of parts for the 2014-2018 Silverado's. Thanks! I'm building a prerunner 2015 Silverado and would like all American made parts for my build. The L83 bullshit motors have very few parts available and you would bring in many new customers. IF this becomes a thing you are more than welcome to test these parts on my truck. Thank you, Andrew Martino. Racine Wisconsin. btw check out my old C7 build on my YouTube channel. I think you'll like how outrageous it was lol
Congrats you guys this is huge! and may have sold me on a direct parts hookup for future projects keep up the good work and god bless!!
where are the labcoats?
Boys out here doing BIG things. Congrats guys!
dude im not fucking crying you are. holy shit that shit was spicy dawggggggg
Wow! Great news mcfarland fab X motion raceworks ❤️
So proud of you guys!
Next they need to do a white vally cover and red and blue valve cover. Sell it as the cleetus freedom set.
you (FINALLY) fired every liberal there - bout damn time 👍🏼
America 🇺🇸 🇺🇲
Hell yeah brother
I love lucas
Fire me up!!!💪
Congrats!!!     i need a Cleetus Pontiac Motor for my 65 GTO...  :)
This video reminds me of being at work and I dont like it lol.  But seriously congrats guys on making the moves most of us are to scared or lazy to make.
Low key disappointed y’all didn’t buy the state of Florida, but super stoked for this!! Fire me up!!!
12:17 True salesman, well done. I like the Don’t need it buy it anyway tactic.
The proud result arthroscopically rejoice because clock strangely spell pace a neighborly plain. relieved, selfish bengal
Motion raceworks is expensive as hell. Please find a way to bring the cost down, this is ridiculous.
NEEDS MOAR FORCED PERFORMANCE TURBSKIES!
It would be nice if someone can build some parts aftermarket for the 496 8.1 very very slim on them pickings
This is a Full Send. No concerns. We're with you. GO BABY!
Murica!!!! Baby
Cleetus said "coyot... oh thats Ford parts never mind"
I'm happy for you guys, but driving an import makes it sad for me. No parts for this guy 😢👍
ohhh man 14:55 had me cracking up!!! so happy for you guys! congrats on all the new blessings!!!
https://youtu.be/wI0_4pfpf8s 👍👍👍👍👍
Officer, I swear, i was just waving my flag. I couldn’t help it if it was attached to my car.
Motion, something tells me you're about to get a SURGE of requests
Had no idea motion was 20 min from my house  Surprised cleetus and James didn’t reach out . Could have given them the extra bedroom for the night
You should produce McFarland branded tractor exhaust flaps
wait so to doug are race cars tax write offs asking for a friend of course lol
TRENDING!!!
I live 1hr and an 1/2 from there. That's awesome
I would love to see them in red too
I see why it's so expensive to buy these parts now lol. High quality shit
Derek got his license in el toro
YOU GOT TO ADD SOME TRANSPARINT VALVE COVERS AND OIL PAN AND CACH CAN
I hope all these freedom parts come with a dog stamp of approval.
Cleetus voted for Biden
Just picked up my frenchie puppy in DeWitt only 2 hours from were I live nice
Wow next you'll have OK GO on making tunes with CNC machines and pianos round the freedom factory!  amazed
From a business perspective for y'all, that's awesome news. For the lil guy like me, all that means is the price of parts are more expensive because it has your name on it now. I'll stick with ebay parts and save tons of money. Won't have your name on my motor, but I think I'll live without it last time I checked 😆. I love y'all and mean no disrespect btw
25:02 thirty people laugh 😅
Cleetus, ENGINE ROOM!
American made parts will get my money every time. It’s awesome to see parts manufactured here , by a company that’s completely American owned! For the longest time I thought only Tim Mcamis cared , I’m glad to see another successful company.
Time to get a contract going with bunker branding
0:00 You're becoming a manufacturer, building your own chassis, short blocks, turbskis, and trans?
You could make the Ford 8.8 diff cover with burn rubber hell yeah brother on it
Been a long time watcher. Admire what you are doing..... please tell them to give those boxers some good protein and fats, like you do for your retrievers
boxers are the best dogs. please dont let them near the welders. they dont know to look away
So 😎
I swear cleetus has some Aussie in him after seeing that burnout
Shop guys having to act like these 2 are relevant. You two put the why in Y axis.
*over a million views in 1 day*  *AINT NUTHIN UT A COUPLEA FUCKING KINGS OUCHEA IN THE SHCREETS DOING THE PEOPLES WERK, ON GOD, ON MUTHER FUCKING GANG YALL*  *KEEP PUSHING AND KEEP MUTHA FUCKIN MOVING FORWARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*  *GOD BLESS AND GOD SPEED TO YALL KINGS*
Lettttsss goooo!
I seriously love the comments on this video! Facebook about the video is nothing but negativity... to where here, it’s nothing but positivity and love! Hell yeah Brother! Keep trucking!
Hell yeah brother!!!!
This is cool and all but they don't make a single Mopar product.
Absolutely AWESOME!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!
“That’s leroys engine” so hyped
Anodized aluminum Cleetus flag logos on flex fit hats and staw hats
HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!!!....us fans are proud of you and the crew for the accomplishment!!!!....
as a machinist myself. these guys have their ducks in a row when it comes to efficient machining. I wish i worked in that shop
Number 25 trending video today I would say regardless that’s a good investment
Intro makes me proud to be a machinist. I dont work for Motion Raceworks but seeing people like me get a slight spotlight feels good
I love the cleet who curses 😅 "can we get a video of James just squirting shit?"
Need an angle kit for my 1980 z28.
America Fuck yea
Is it possible to heat the aluminum to liquid form then you're able to pour it into a mold..
Love the header flappers and dogs.
I am so jealous right now well best of luck in the automotive parts wishing you the best. now i just slink off and die quietly in the corner.
👍🏼
Cleetus breaks so many parts it was cheaper to just buy the factory.
So rad! Happy for yall and I can't wait to order some parts!.. I need a limited edition Cleetus shift knob or hydro handle
Jesus HELL that kid can drive.
get rid of the haas' and get a good machine.
Is Lucas related to Dr. Tune Em All?
Too bad their using haas
Keep it American baby
Loved that INSANE burnout!!
A waste of rubber, fuel, time and pollutes the air.
Make some stuff to support the 8.1l crowd! But seriously this is awesome!
HELL YEAH BROTHER!!  SUPER SUPER STOKED FOR YOU GUYS! SOOOOOOOOOOO AWESOME! 🤘😝🤘
HELL YEAH BROTHER 👏. The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit 👍
How many parts do yall think they stuffed in there pockets before they left?🤣
Awesome.
Are you guys Scientology?
I was hoping for a full on Mountain Dew sponsorship deal.
heres an idea take a fork lift put a straight cut dog box in it and let it rip
Dear Cleetus, congrats on your new venture. Its going to be awesome... I don't want to make a big deal out of this however I just wanted to share that @1:02, you've shown a massive explosion... I only needed to see that few seconds to remember it myself... well... because I was there, I saw it and had the windows of my apartment blow up in my face (Check the first video on my youtube channel for proof - Tianjin Explosion). I was injured, hospitalized and it completely destroyed my apartment complex and surrounding 5km radius. It changed my life forever. I am all good now and life is better, however, all I ask is that you when you want to grab some random footage off youtube for funny stuff (the NOS explosion is a nice effect) to just check what it was about first before using the footage, as many people died and lost their livelihoods in that explosion, so for those who were effected, its not really a laughing matter - From a long time subscriber. PS: looking forward to more mullet videos!
"stretch me out James" "My box looks horrible" "How'd he get his hose in?" What kinda channel are we running here fellas??    Lmao
I need a job at motion race works
This is so dope. I love the partnership, very smart to think of the future.
Need to add parts for 92-00 5.2 V8 Magnum from Dodge/Jeep! Not too many places that could offer a 5 star built part for these 318’s but would definitely run parts if you guys make something someday! Awesome
Congratulations 👏
It’s all about the drop in now. 😂 cool burnout   Well done on the move 😎👍
Hell yeah!
This are just freedom water droplets 💦 🥲 move along
When I saw the big sticker on mullet last vid I knew what was up, Congratulations. Next time you come to Tennessee (GODS Country) I'll show you the best spot to let your hair down with the jet boats. Good luck with the Drag week!
Very Cool!!😎
Cleet welding was the funniest thing i've seen today! 😂😂
Congratulations
H E  L L  Y A  B R O T H E R ! !   GET'EM CLEETUS!! WOO HOO!!
"omg my box looks horrible, how'd he get his hose in? "
One big commercial...
I really want one of those ball caps ur wearing. I need a new hat lol
HEY ITS THAT DOUG SCHMIDT GUY FROM THE @WCB PODCAST
Welp I guess it’s LZMFG vs Motion Raceworks
In light of the coming EPA regulations, this is easily, and by far, the DUMBEST thing Cleetus ever did!
HELL YEA BROTHER!!!!  Congratulations!!
"do I get any guidance on this or do I just put it in and press this green button" 🤣🤣🤣
That dog looked hella fucking skinny
Now you need to do some events in IOWA!!!!!!!!
So corny how you put your name on everything . Those freedom parts you have actually look nice but what man wants another dudes name all over his car? Sheeesh
So happy for you guys, from  asking to help with 1620 videos to this , God Bless you, you are there for now , but you can own that business if you want to,  sky is the limit , love you guys whole heartedly 💯👍👍🙏🙏✌
So glad to see seth rogen running the machine shop
big respect bro, love the friendship you and jack stand has have
Better vote Braindead BIDEN out or all this be for nothing eventually in "GOING GREEN" agenda. 🤨 We true motorsport people need real power over electric 💪🤨👍
The INTRO
I run some cnc Swiss machines for a living it’s some badass shit
Wow cleeter is makin moves 👌👌👌🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Hass machines 🤘🏼😎
Cleetus wants to make that BIG BOY money. He doesn’t wanna just make millions, but he wants to make MILLIONS. He will become a very very wealthy individual. Not saying he isn’t already; but owning multiple businesses, real estate.... he has a very diverse portfolio and I’m sure it will  only continue to grow. He’ll be worth 40-50 million by the time he’s 40 guaranteed.
Ad?
I love boxers
I just love how YouTube auto generated sub titles call the brap braps from the race cars applause.
Congratulations Cleetus, you've all come along way in the past few years.  Great to see you investing in another American enterprise.  Hell yeah brother and keep on freedoming.
So happy for you guys you have worked so hard for this i hope this is just of many big things
when did Seth Rogen become a machinist!
I'd love to see you guys build a 4 banger drift s10. I know 4 bangers arnt your style but, the way you guys build, you can take it to the moon with motion raceworks!! #freedom
Great products by great people! Here in Murica! 🇺🇲🦅🇺🇸🦅🇺🇲🦅🇺🇲🦅🇺🇲
That 3 piece v band is so sick!
To think from Cleetus and his 3000hp camaro, to quitting school to be a full time Florida man, buying the Freedom Factory, now working with Motion Raceworks having his own line of car parts. Next year he’s going to have his own line of 427s at Texas Speed 😂
the packaging machine reminded me of Hillsborough county jail when your belongings are sealed up 😑
This is the stuff I like to see!  A smart business move!
I though when the monalog started James was gonna leave like Cooper.
There is zero chance I will ever buy any part from you. Investment lost. But trying to buy into gasoline parts is like the lost dodo.
Make racing part for lawnmowers. Like intake mounts.
Congrats .... long time fan. Glad to see you're growing and getting better...
Much freedom so eagles! Graz from Finland!
Proudly made in USA 🇺🇸.  Hell yeah brother 🙏🙏
Ehhh, I’m a fan of the channel, but think that deal should’ve been made privately. A YouTuber with self branded swag is one thing. Branded parts from a otherwise legit company cheapens said company in my opinion. I’m sure he’ll make a buck, but it won’t be from anyone serious.
Congrats man, it’s so cool watching you grow and develop... keep up the awesome work and one day I hope to be able to meet ya guys.
wow go freedom for freedom. thanks for your time
Made in America 🇺🇸 man, I love to hear that! Hell yeah brother well done! 🦅
so happy for y'all guys this is soo cool
That's so MERICA!
Sick!!!
This is amazing ! But when this man tried to weld and it just fell right off 🤣🤣🤣🤣
CLEETER PLEASE HELP ME OUT ,I HAVE A 2017 TERRAIL (daily) GOT a fresh set of wheels and some other basic things and I CANNOT find drop springs for it not even a damn intake..is there anyway yall can help me out with any of these atleast  the springs?
I need parts for an f22b1. I would gladly pay good money
Merica!
Lucas looking like Seth rogan lil brother lol
Good Job. Keep up the Merica!
You just turned yourself into a freaking shopping channel. May your soul rest in peace. But seriously : good move.
Buddy came up to Iowa, I knew my corn senses were tingling don't ya know
Update ur race parts to CM engineering. More better
Will you start making parts for Crown Vics? Those cars are becoming more popular and their values are rising. I know other Crown Vic enthusiasts including myself would be thrilled to have more stuff out there for these old cars!
all i gotta say to this is hell yeah brother
Don’t forget to drink your ovaltiene 🙄
Congratulations To all of you folks, Cleetus, James, Freedom Factory folks and of course The Motion Raceworks folks!! Such an awesome venture! Wish you all the absolute best and look forward to great things from this merger. Keep up the good work, all ! You folks are an inspiration!
Really cool, all the best.
HELL YEAH BROTHER!!! This is what the month of freedom is supposed to be.  Hella proud to be fans on both sides of this business deal.  Best parts on the world and best Florida man on the world coming together.
Amazing cletus brought back good memories
Need some jack stand parts also
Omg.. A million views in less than 24 hrs.. Hell yeah brother.. 😂
Congrats cleet!! Proud of y'all! You guys went from nothing to absolutely fantastic! Keep up the freaking work bruh'z you and Jack stand!
Damn.. Is that the car  wizard brother?
Yo cleet, " HELL YEAH BROTHER " and " FULL SEND " life jackets for pets
love it bro. congrats!
Because of this channel I have bought some motion raceworks products and they are very nice! Plus they are only like 4 hours away from me so I usually get my parts next business day haha!
🤣  the eagle scream when he put his glass on
i`m an Iowan i never knew motion raceworks was from here.
Congrats cleetus and jackstand you've been using their parts for a long time
This is starting to feel like the race car version of LinusTechTips. Starting in garage then growing big and diversifying.
Hate it summit is were you came from 🤷🤷
Omg to funny at 15.00 minute
It went from being a kid in a candy shop to being an kid in his own candy shop still getting excited about being in a candy shop
Those breathers are really nice.
Aight!
Any chance of getting Ly7 parts
Are you fench? Because you keep saying WE when its just you and US when it's just you, don't make it look like you share the money from the channel or the 20% ownership of motion raceware
When you say we signed with motion raceware that really means YOU are 20% owner not anyone else on this channel. I just like clarity and the truth, keep it real
Been here for your adventures in garages since I think 100ish subscribers, am getting emotional thinking of how far you and your team and family have come, stay happy and live long my friend!  Never let the burns stop!
Shit wish I had white money like this🥺
This makes me so happy and good inside. I have followed you from the OG sick seconds video. You have risen from nothing to one of the most followed people in the automotive industry. And have gone above and beyond to make sure your fans can interact with you as much as possible. Congrats to you my friend.
Idk about everyone else but, @ 2:53.... damn near teared up.
Corn Cob was fantastic! Give that man a raise!
If James is here for the long run and stays with you I think the logo should get redesigned and include something with James in the logo
Awesome. Glad you guys are making moves.  Been watching you for a few years now from Michigan. I'm in Florida for the week so I'll be at the drift night.
I can’t wait for the day that a true American like Cleetus runs for president!
Congratulations man you are awesome
Congratulations Hell Yeah Brother
I assume james is in charge of tech customer service with automated responses. Question: What AN fitting on breather?  James reply: Add more nitrous
American Dream
Kill billet.......and who would want to have the word 'cleetus' printed on their engine????????Or any one else's name for that matter....keep it clean
HELL YEAH BROTHER 😎 🤙
As a Cleetus fan with 15 years of machining experience I gotta ask:  Y'all hiring?
Dont run yourself thin or over invest. Things have a way of falling out from under people...
Are y’all gonna make parts for diesel trucks Cummins and duramax.
That’s a scary move during a time of proposed legislation to keep engines and ancillary equipment stock. Good luck
The boxers are reason enough to go with Motion!
Hell yea brother! Can't wait to build a cletus shitbox special!
CONGRATS! I see some big things in the future...keep er up brothers!
This is what I wanna do when I grow up. Just build badass cars and car parts
😉👍
Sweet! Making it happen. Literally. Well wishes on this amazing new venture. Cool full send burn out too. ✨✅✨
"Boxers are pretty much running the entire company." Sold, I don't even have my project car yet but I'm buying something to go on the wall before in a car! Hand picked by boxer mafia lol
Till our owners make gasoline engines illegal.... FREEDOM baby...
What about Hemi Truck parts?
What a waste. Wouldn’t pouring the elbow be a lot cheaper?
Can you guys please make a intercooler system for the second generation Chevy Cruze Lt. I really need one and I can't find anybody that makes a kit so if I can't find one I'm just going to have to make it all myself but if you got sold one I would just buy it instead of making it myself
If you can get james, or both of you into cnc machining. Being able to understand how the parts can be changed through revisions is a great tool to be had. Pretty dang cool none the less
Need that line up of Dodge parts 😉🇺🇸🇺🇸
I’d say that burnout was “Full grown sent!” .
Best of luck on the new venture👍👍
Hell ya this is what america needs!!! More racecar parts made in the usa to help stop these assholes from banning our race cars!!!
This explains the large motion raceworks sticker on mullet
Be sure to drink your Ovaltine...... a crummy commercial.
Pay for the sodas. It'll be appreciated.
What about us diesel guys can a brother get a y intake for my 6.7 powerstroke? Just saying we want motion too ya know?
I found out yesterday that the Cleeter team will be at Edgewater. I live 20 minutes from there and I can't get off work to go see them.
😭 so happy for you guys.
Company slogan should totally be Motion Raceworks , The Motion of Freedom 🇺🇸
chain-wife-kids-end
One of the most humble men I watch on YouTube
Best burn out on the tube
good luck...I ran from automotive sector....
Dang it brother. Had a guy nervous. This is way better than what I thought you were doing. I thought motor trend or producers......
Coop would be spewing ay
God dang Cleeter, all American Florida man doing it big. Now to just acquire something worthy of some motion raceworks parts
Right on, Cleetus!
Why does that guy look so much like seth rogan lol...
That's Seth Rogen, everybody. Don't be deceived.
This is awesome buddy next you need to buy BMP from Victor
Motion Raceworks lost one of their best customers when you bought the company. Lmfao. sales are gonna go down now
Congratulations guy's
when you at the track you always us floor jacks and axle stands, could you imagine james the jack stands branded jacks and of course jack stands
SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!
Been with you since you started with 1320 an have rode this journey with you the whole way ....can't imagine the feeling of accomplishment y'all have right now... congratulations on believing in yourself an achieving you goals 🇺🇸🇺🇸💪🏻💪🏻
Ole Cleeter is like the next Richard Rowlings.  Next thing, he'll be selling his own Tequila (The Cleeta Tequila) and opening his own restaurant (The Cleeta Eata).
were  is leroy at
That's an Australian level burnout right there.
I work at H and W global in blairsville pa , would love to get with you for your anodizing needs
I don't think burnouts are cool. I also don't like nationalism...
Anybody else thing the parachute handles should say  woah there brother
This is very inspirational
FFIIRREE MMEE UUPP
You two have made me very proud keep up the great work fellas. Can't wait to see more
Anything made locally is the best.
How do you own and sell parts when you own 20% and call them your own? Something just sounds wrong and cringy about that. You guys could do SO much more by starting your own 100% owned and created by you, and your team.
Love it! Investing in America !
Great move to keep growing the brand.
Bro Dougy’s prolly thinkin bout the ways he can make his nova go 6s now that Ol Cleeter has mullet lol
Did anyone in the rumor mill guess this? I'll bet you all feel stupid now. Congrats to you Garrett
Why anodize when it reduces fatigue life, u just get a worse part
motion raceworks ipo when?? i want me STONKS!
America!
Don’t matter your race or gender if that intro don’t get ya pumped your crazy HELL YEA BROTHER!!!!!!!!!
You got my bussiness brother great products made even better people
tegridy!
Security team doggo has been following y’all to make sure y’all don’t vacuum seal your hands.
Nice little Easter egg in the last vid when Kevin said "how much did it cost them to get that sticker on the car"
He said o Ford parts those don't break we will just put that back
That's awesome.  Wish you guys success!
Congratulations, Bois. And thanks for all the stoke along the way
No chinese junk here
The product placement of that elbow tho
Hell Yeah! Brother!
Proud of you Cleet. You've come along way from pulling engines out of scrappers.
You didnt feel like you had enough on your plate hahaha when do you sleep.  Cant wait to see what comes of this
Congrats brothers!!! keep doing amazing things guys
The american way  Happy for these guys,   the negative comments here are just the people who will never do anything on their own just exist of someone elses dream and determination.
So its simple merchandise or what?
Is James also part owner? Or just along for the ride
Congratulations boys! I think we are witnessing the beginning of an empire.🇺🇲 Florida man wakes up behind dumpster after canceling all breaks for employees.
Big congrats to you guys!
When that plate fell off xD
you is realy going up in the world now bro!!! have they got a 3d printer if so can you get them to make a model of the elcomino+trailor in raceweek mode.they would be sick man+i would love to buy 1 and im sure the wholr world would love one or even better a romote control one that would be supercool not that you arent allready supercool but you might be the cooles thing in the galaxy,cant say in the universe cos im sure youll do something even cooler nextweek.you could do awhole range of remote vehicles leroy ruby toast and aremote jetboat on a trailor. that way we lesser mortals can live vicariously in miniture through them,so cool that would be.sorry going on a bit here. i dont usualy coment on anything but well but well you are the man!!! im not even American,hope you dont hold that against me. im Scottish,well British realy cos lived most of my life in England. ive pretty much just been watching youtube stuff mostly ondragracing,alex taylor and dennis,tom bailey the outlaw race scene,big chief,boosted gt murder nova,to many to mention .at this point in the message i fell asleap and woke up with a full screen off 3s wondering what the hell was going on.ok just woke up and reread what i said in a less than clear headed frame of mind but the jist of it all is wright but spelling needs help but hey dislexia what can you do..anyway waflin again anyway Keep Cool Stay Fast And Take over the World!!!! Peace out. sorry one more thing love your two golden retrivers,i grew up with 2 and actualy learned to walk holding on to the back of one of them so they hold a dear place in my heart and they alone tell me you must be a good man!!! peace love out.
Do they have a part to fit a 2007 hyundai sonata  Lol
Bad call. 3 yrs down the road when an employee who you have no clue about does something wrong at the factory you are now tied to it. "Cleetus McFarland Co owner of  Motion Racworks says he had no idea one his employees were running a child porn site." You are now tied forever to anything bad that occurs there.
Well that is neat. Bolt in Roll cages. Injector hats. ?? Fuel cells. ECUs  alloy butterfly components.  The sky is the limit. 😉👍🤑
I would like to buy 0.001%
Awesome to see you put your money into a great American  made  company! I wish you guys nothing  but  success!
And here I was thinking Cleet got himself a big ole Bardle Skeet sponsorship
Good job on the investment smart move
Florida man making America great again
R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R-T-O-D-R-I-N-K-Y-O-U-R-O-V-A-L-T-I-N-E  🤣🤣🤣

I May be the first to say this here and I think you will get it after the burnout HELL YEAH STRALIA/MERICA.old boy cleeter moving In the right direction.FUNK YEAH.
Iskanderian, Edelbrock, Mickey Thompson.....Cleetus....yeah nah... ;)
Now I know whats going in my xbody, congrats boys!
Keep up the great work brother 👍 you deserve it all your team so sic solid fleet  and family
You guys should also add polished or bare aluminum with a black cleetus logo, as an option for parts finish.
Awesome guys. Looking forward to some badass parts!
Hell yeh brother!! Congratulations on the new venture. ✌️✌️✌️👏👏👏
Bad ass for the rest of your life
Well done yanks 🇦🇺 this really is the example the world should see not the political shit, this guy stayed away from bunker branding to help the small guy who help him from the start, the list goes on from there, well done mother fuckers well done 🇦🇺🇦🇺
What's James stake in cleatus?
OH F-YEAH, BROTHER!!! Bald Regal with Florida's certified HEAVIEST RIGHT FOOT in the drivers' seat. Ever need to farm out some machining...between my old man, 2 uncles, & myself about 125+ years G-pa started it in '78; all I've ever done. IN FACT, if cut I leak blue coolant
Congratulations on the new investment. It would be nice to see some more gen 3 hemi parts. Intakes throttle bodies  valve covers mds delete kits. There isn’t very much aftermarket support for the hemi like the Ls or coyote engines.
Start a line of parts called 'Cleeter Bits'
Appreciate the contribution and innovation you have bought to the automotive community in the u.s.a and also appreciate you all sharing it with the world via YouTube,Not to forget Coopers efforts from the get go, although he has parted ways since.
Fuck yeah!!!!!🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺👍👍👍lets go from down under👍
And here I thought it would be to introduce 2 new dew flavors Bald Eagle FF  and Jackstand N20 Energy Juice.
Most sensible thing you have ever done ✅
Cleetus McFarland LCAC-10 is my boat out here in Japan man that's cool
That's what u had cooking with all that smoke?  🚙💭😤🙈 Keep elevating yourself  I'm taking notes 👨‍🏫
Hope you guys come back to iowa!
Congrats Cleet n crew. All the best in this massive step forward
Hell yeah Brother
Thanks for sharing!!!
Im a little upset i was hoping it was your own drag strip
#fckunlegends! CONGRATULATIONS CLEETUS AND CREW! I have watched every video since the inception of cleetus McFarland and I couldn't be happier for you!!!!!
Great to see your investing in your future,
I was wondering why James and others have been wearing the shirts and I've seen a lot of motion raceworks in ya last few videos being shirts stickers etc.
My first thought seeing the 5 axis mill is billet blocks for the whole fleet !! 🔥
I wonder what kind of Aluminum is used? I don't think its from Aluminum cans right? Melted ect. probably high density aluminum . What brought me to this comment is I recently started collecting aluminum cans and in my line of work I am able to collect thousands of cans a month and recycle them. made 150$ yesterday for just one month of collecting .  Any ways , keep rockin boys!! Love ya, Mean it!
Dude super proud of you to put into some thing that you love so much. You have allways worked hard to give us some thing back and you have now gone beyond my imagination! Keep the freedoms growing and can't wait to see what you and motion race works come up with. Or should i say freedom race works
Was the sticker scene in the last vid with Kevin a hint?
Cleet you need to start manufacturing  plug and play turbokits for Crown Vics, so we can all have bald eagle freedom in our lives.
seems they'd benefit from having most parts custom cast and just cleaning the castings up, vs. starting with raw blocks. then again, that's what everyone else does, then they get lazy and push the machining out also. before you know it poor quality castings and sloppy machining starts spitting out low quality parts. sadly, it's about the only way to compete and stay afloat
Dude.. Yes what a move. Congratulations Cleet that's insane. 👌👍
At first, I thought they bought Texas Speed but Motion Raceworks is just as good
Business idea ! similar to high end cars would be super cool if you had a little tag that came with every piece that was made in house with the name of the guy of machines ! nothing fancy just a piece of paper saying “made by Andy” or something like that
We’re taking this ! Turning it into that ! Which goes into this ! 😂😂😂
I’m a motor cross racer and also not into cars but you have me wanting to buy parts just to put on the shelf!! Which is also my input of new products seeing you guys have all the CNC capabilities! What if you guys made Motion Raceworks motorcycle parts? Eg, clutch covers, Magnito covers, power valve cover, front sprocket/ rear sprocket guards etc? That would be sick to see two world combine!! Hell yeah brother!!!
Why not do a build for a subscriber useing thos parts I have bn working on my 86 corvette for a while if u wanna finish it lol if you was to do something like that an pick me I'd give you a 86 camaro z28 to show gratitude     Just a thought lol.  Love the fact that I can get parts ur are a part of lol
Strong move for both parties!  #YeeYee 🇺🇸
1601st part is an electric blower kit!!!
I’d love to run this brand on my 2021 Camry , however they don’t make parts for my type of car. 😒
Sworf girls.
14:54 had me ROLLING, Had to of laughed for a good 20 minutes
same way it was done years ago, parts designed and built racers themselves, whom were also machinists, engineers, farmers and more! but there's not much left of any of them now days, most are hollowed out shell companies with nothing left but the dying brand names, which have been milked to death of equity and all production pushed to China/Mexico/India/other with the cheapest dirty metallurgy and poor quality
Congrats.
I was gunna say Z1motorsports but I think I'm on the wrong page
I work in the inspection department of a machine shop very similar to what you guys are doing. Our shop is just bigger and we run a variety of different parts. USA made parts also. I love watching other machine shops operate.
Talked it up way too much
sweet honey barbecue
It's a HAAS machine. It probably is the same type of machine that makes parts for the HAAS F1 team
any plans for jet boat parts?
Congratulations cleet and Jack stand
Yeah fucking right. Some people are just born with a different hand of cards i will never be anything like
Wow guys! You never cease to amaze me! Absolutely epic
You should also come out with a line of products that are just raw billet aluminum with the Cleetus American flag logo on them
How about a billet samurai sword looking e-brake handle
So if I understand this change correctly, they're taking steps to ensure that they'll be financial secure enough to keep entertaining the living CRAP out of us FOREVER hahahahaha!!!  No pressure... OMG THEY CAN START MAKING CORVETTE TRANSAXLES!!! BEST. DAY. EVER! Oh God... I need a life 🤣 *Fantastic news, great decision, totally explains the size of Mullet's decal too.  I'm glad we cleared that up!!*
This is awesome! Congratulations. 👍👍🤘🤘
How about a turbo kit where one turbo spins the opposite direction and is completely mirrored to the other turbo-four twin-turbo setup so you can have it symmetrical and clean
I'm proud of you cleeter, for what it is worth.
Almost 1 million in less than 24hrs
So cool to see you two and Motion Raceworks all coming together
Congrats guys, fantastic news.  👍👌💪
Zalinsky:"I make car parts for the American working man, because that's what I am, and that's who I care about."
Congratulations
Need that hell yeah brother hydro handbrake
Proud of you guys!!!!
soon to be 3million subscribers, bought his own race track, bought 20% in motionraceworks. cleet and CO got som real flow.
Need a billet "oh shit" handle. I feel it's gonna be a hot seller
Ginger seth rogen needs to be featured more
making bankk
Why are you puttung the trimmings in a skip cleetus  thats alot ov money getting poured down the drain buy a fernise and reclaim that money i garantee you will make more money as the liqud could be made in to other things like wheels   exhausts ect think about it
Hook me up with a job.
Hey USA guys, do you have the L98 LS engine over there? Always here about the LS1, LS2 and so on.. cheers mate form Australia 🤙🤙🤙
YouTube Fcukd Up-h
Short throw shifter for a 09-15 ctsv! There's only 2 other companies making them and they're always out of stock
I didn't see that coming but hell ya cant wait to buy the cleetus line of parts
Make some billet fuel rails
Congrats Cleet andd James!!! This is huge!!!
I am amazed how Americans work on their car themselves. Being a citizen of a developing country, we have cheap labour here. We love cars but can make someone else work for us. Really f+*ked up shit here. Love from Pakistan P. S support for local manufacturers is the most patriotic thing that one can do. Bravo
Fricken hell yeah brother!!
Time to open a motion raceworks warehouse/ store at FF.
I think the Motion machine shop crew needs custom clear Pit Viper safety glasses! Mullets not recommend around heavy machinery.
Wait wait a second,, I fallow formula 1 and nascar, and I just seen HAAS MACHINES in here ???????
Well Pfizer me up! Congrats on your success!
I really thought it was something to do with summit racing
Far us preferably parts it's your tx
Between the FF and Motion, he's insulated himself against the EPA crackdown of modified cars. He has his own track and can invite people to legally drive their modified cars there. Then when they want a bigger build, he can sell them the parts to do so. Then he films the whole thing for us to watch online. Income at every angle. At this point it might actually be financially beneficial to team Cleetus if the EPA actually does crack down on modded cars.
Congratulations 🎉 smart move
congrats and good luck guys, cool te see the haas logo on a machine in action, i only know it from the f1 team
Use to run a HAAS VF2 before I went in to IT administration, one hell of a good machine tool!
Congrats that’s awesome
jamesnwith the drills is gold😆😆😆
24:20 first time hearing him say shit lol
the red haired guy looks like seth rogan
Awesome mate,loving the investment,
Now the big sticker on the mullet make sense
Well when someone orders those parts and it come in a mess they know who packaged it. 😂😂
From LS motors to the drag strip to destruction derbys , and now co-owning a business you love. This is by far the most American youtube channel EVER.  Bald Eagles all day way, Baby!
When Cleetus said “shit” I physically gasped! I didn’t even think he knew what cus words were!
The real life Tommy boy
Smart move! Great way to diversify your investments, build another income stream and expand your brand. Plus....kick ass car parts brother!
Great work man! I’ve been here since the start but sadly can’t financially afford to show my support and love but y’all keep it up!
Thought he was going to say Texas speed.
This is great, I was so scared this was I'm going to cable announcement, even though he  said it wasn't.
I'm less than 3 minutes into the video and all I can say is........... Fantastic! 🗽 You guys are the perfect people to jump into something like this.  You're down to earth and people respect you for promoting and encouraging pride in America. You're like none other just simply the name freedom factory tells who you are. Big thumbs up I seen the parts that company has made for you and what they can do and I'm way, way impressed.   I was getting scared thinking maybe you were going to run for office or something like that.  You had a big great person to run for office because you care about the American people I'm glad that's not what you did  😁😁😁
MURIKAAAAA!!!!!!!!
Now you just need to build out a Motion Raceworks factory onsite at the track :)
0:58 Sooo... Is James still buying a Nitrous factory though??   Great guys, great channel. Wish you all the best for the future form the UK.
I came for the announcement. I stayed for the boxers. Congrats guys. Good to see you are thinking of the future
"it blew up it blew up it blew up. Im out, peace"  ROFL  For real - what you have achieved is amazing and I am utterly in awe of it all. I cant wait for covid to be over so I can come over and visit you guys from Australia.
When did Cleet become Albino?
And here is me thinking the big announcement is that you bought Bradenton, this is bigger congrats on your investment.
Well shit, I honestly thought Cleetus was going to tell all of us that him and Maddy were expecting their first child.
been here before cleet grew the mullet shoot I remember James first day
Freaking HUUUGE news guys! That's a Big fire me up from the community ❤️❤️
Thought he was going to say summit
Boys, this is HUGE!
Motion race works should invest into the equipment to cast there parts, it would save them so much on materials
Nice one bud only way is up bud  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Congratulations guys. HELL YA BROTHER
I've never trusted any company more than when I saw all those boxers walking around. Best dogs there are
HAAS cncs are so freakin amazing. Like the complete opposite of their F1 Cars.
If My billet parts dont ride in something like this before its shipped to me i dont want it
Cleetus needs to have his right hand man brain James say a few words next time.
Congratulations Garret! Unbelievable what you all have pulled off.  You guys are working the American Dream, doing what you love. I would love to Chat with you, So many great inspirations seen in this video, I am starting to bring my own American made invention to the masses. DigiDizzy
IM NOT CRYING YOU ARE !! HELL YEAH BROTHER GOOD FOR YOU AND THE TEAM !! <3
Would you guys ever consider stocking up on, or even making some billet parts, for imports?
Is james a boss too?
Before watching the video I was scared for one second he was signing Motortrend. Happy it turned out to be the Motion company!
Effin a right. Thats great guys. Happy for ya.
Congratulations guys!
Learning how to do a burn out but should sound like the devil more. It's why everyone love's blowen car's.
if we dont get more hovercraft content im gonna riot!!!!
Might as well team up with Seimens SolidWorks and a Powder Bed Prototyping System while you're at it?
Next comes texas speed...
I wound where this idea came from I think the rod shop boys and warbird 🇦🇺
At this point it's a war between LZ and Cleetus in who can spend the most money.
Well if theirs one thing your good at, its breaking and testing and breaking and testing, if it works for you, 99% of us wont even put it near the limit, and just speaking from what my father of many many years always tells me, the older stuff lasted as it was made with slide rulers with a 3% extra of what it needed metal wise vs the modern stuff where its within half a percent, so if you need to really beef it up, tell them to go 2.5% over what they think a part should be machined with when it comes to steel to make it last  and that's coming straight from an engineer of, well, lets say well over 25 years of experience.
Fantastic move. Well done and keep up the great work.
I hope they ship out cleets package
Don't forget to be talking about those stupid laws they're trying to past blocking people from working on their cars and racing and also the product to use
FUCK YES CLETUS LETS GO!!!!!
Tell me Luke isn't the spitting image Seth Rogen... It's not possible!
I reckon what would be awesome is if Cleetus signs a handful of random packages before they get shipped out to the customers.
I used to run a HASS C.N.C. machine at a shop I worked at.
Well played team Cleetus, well played!
The dynasty begins...
HELL  YEAH  BROTHER!!!!
It seems like a slight inefficiency to need to wrap all the parts in a grip piece of fried chicken with the list of shipments for the day so the dogs can find all the parts to ship
Round table with you, Sandy, and Jay.
Soooo side by side parts?!?
It weighs 18 pounds when started and comes out to .9.......uhhhhh that ain’t good cleetus lol you just used up a huge of aluminum lol! The cleetus name is a free pass for yall to make some parts that are useful and needed and make sense but like....not really lmao good move
Hell ya brother!
I like how they use a propeller as their last tool to blow the parts off in their machines. I worked at a shop that used model airplane propellers to blow the parts off way back like 20yrs ago. It's pretty common now.
Man, I wish Cooper was still hangin with you guys. Nice business move. Onward and upward.
Meanwhile, Cooper buys 20% of a wrecking yard in Toledo.
I was originally freaking out thinking James went on his own or something!!  Congrats on the new business adventure guys!!
4:30 in and all I can say is FUCK YES! I can’t believe I can finally buy a 0% AR15 receiver!!!! Looks like a quality block of aluminum. When is the cleetus desk sized CNC with preloaded GCode to insert said aluminum and spit out a 100% receiver??? I already designed and built my own but I would love a cleetus version!!! Maybe you need to own the designs for one cough cough
So is this a 10%cleet and 10% James split or cleetus got all 20% 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Looks like a great company to invest in, id never buy anything, more a toyota offroader person but can respect the quality of machining.
HELL YEAH BROTHER
Congrats on new chapter hell yeah brother
Huuuge congratulations! This is so wicked awesome!!
What u blurred out was the valve spring tester....we already know motion raceworks has made them and releasing them....
I am happy for ya! Keep the great content coming. Thanks ❤️
The tire smoke made my eyes water.
Good for you Cleetus!
Congratulations cleter
make more flag stuff
I want the “Doggoh” organizer at my house.
Great business step..well  done. Hell yeah brother.......
But can box boy even drive a stick
Congratulations on the buy!!!
If you guys don't make a "James" edition toolbox I'm gonna be so sad.
Hands down. Best channel on youtube.
We need baby billet cleetus keychain turbos
24:31 - That's what She said 💎💎 💎
All the bald eagle props to ya! Real Deal Curb Appeal on those parts, Soo purty! Please keep doing whatcha doing, you inspire others to adapt to a changing world. Here’s another great Idea.., use a monopod when camerawork requires following you around to increase stability & shot-to-shot quality of your content.

Longest commercial on YouTube 🇺🇸
https://youtu.be/KvpScmJ0LXc
Since you mentioned getting ideas for parts, how about expanding to the GM 3.6L in the availability of performance parts? There are a handful of guys in Pontiac g8's, camaro v6's, cadillacs cts, etc... looking to upgrade their engines. You could start a brand new niche market in that there are no other local companies with such parts, unless they go international (Australia, etc). Maybe do some research and bring the V6 communities into their own group. Especially when working on a budget or not able to attain the V8 counterparts of their vehicles. I hope you guys consider this idea. Thanks.
The big old motion sticker on mullet makes alot of sense now! Well done cleeter, big moves big rewards
Absolute congratulations! What a big big deal. Super excited for this
Do they sell a ls kit for 4wd s10 blazer?
Vice ribbed
Congrats to you guys man. You guys rock and Dougie fresh
Not me thinking the announcement was gonna be that his missus is prego
What about stuff for a 1979 vette
Anyone else notice all the machines are all haas branded?
1. The only ship that won't sail is a partnership.  Good luck fellas! 2 Cleet: "how do we alienate 1/3 of our viewership?  Ford?  Yeah, F them!" Lovely.
Backing AMERICAN MADE! I am going to the Motion Raceworks page right now to buy something!!
I wish they will start some honda parts
Can't even put it words other than a Hell yeah brother! It's awesome stuff and congrats
Grats Cleet!
Hell yea guys that’s awesome!! Can you gues make a full turbo kit for a Miata?!
The Cletus McFarland edition catch can, valve cover and valley plate in Old Glory red.
Hell yeah brother
@16:15 they got hose!!
Would y’all consider making shifter knobs for like trucks ?!
Hell yeah I thought this would happen at some point
Total success story, congrats guys !!!
If you guys have the say in the company how about sending some love my way and having me produce the minerals in order to create those parts I know where there's a lots of iron, gold, platinum, silver aluminum copper basically every single material that can be made or melded into a alloy oh and I forgot Mercury that one's not very common though where I'm at though. Oh and tin is not very common either
I am surprised no red, white and blue kits
Looks like i gotta buy from motion now.
Cleetus McFarland  Show some love in the diesel world and I would gladly buy the parts! Awesome move! Hopefully it works out for a lifetime as well as your children’s lifetime!
Is it me or by the end of the video did Garretts eyes look like he was turning into an albino???
I sit and and laugh, last video he and Kevin talking about the decals and Kevin asks "how much did they pay" for  that large of a sticker and Cleeter says oh Nothin.. we're just representing.... To think I was thinking you were gonna say you bought Six Second.....
So now you are sponsoring yourselves. LOL
Congrats lads!!! Well done!
Doubt Anything will  come from this comment , but I wish MRW made stuff for diesel engines.
Next step. Mt dew.
Congrtas bro , hell yeah brother!🔥💪🏾
This is fucking awesome 🇺🇲🇺🇲
A happy little bald eagle just dripped from my eye
Cleeter you are never going to stop winning!
It would be awesome to have some Hell Yeah Brother Headers with All the Bald Eagles and Some Bad Ass Zoomie's.   Congrats on the Big Move that's one Hella Good Company  to partner up with.  You guys can't go nowhere but up.  Freakin Awesome 👌
you know its a good shop when they got ginger seth rogan working there.
1600 parts available but only 400 are made by motion? Wow
This is great news and great for rhe industry.
I'm going to need something from Motion Raceworks that can make my 2005 S197 3v Mustang GT fast!  It will require something called "Magic"?   Let me know...
Probably just did this to get free parts
You need to look up a CNC company in Kentucky...They build 6 second capable machines. Those Haas’s are cute but way slow. Maybe 10.50’s
Grats Team Cleetus
I can already envision a Tommy Boy style video where you and JH Diesel travel the country in Ruby trying to sell Cleeterhan speed parts.
Awesome
Can I get a hell yeah brother?!?!?!
🥱
KEEP BUILDING SHIT! Great job 👏👍
dude just got paid because a million people just watched a half hour infomercial for his side business
atleast make the 7mgte engine be there too
cleetus in 2035 racing pro mods
I'm glad you r an investing American badass. Smart man, smart man. I think this is gonna take you to the next level. I'm happy for ya. Cheers!
Damn imagine being a moar guy Pain 🥲
Buys a nascar car
Thats awesome brother!!!! Super proud of where you've been going!!! Keep it up!!
Like who are the ones who dislike cleetus's videos? Like why?
If you want to help grow the company I’d branch out into the import world of parts support!!! Big money from both sides of the street!
Ok, we got parts coming in now, surely old Cleeter has gotta buy a stake in  KSR now, the best fab wizard out there! Congrats dude!! Youre making grown men cry!!
Those boxers didn’t approve of both your shipping.  They had that look.  Come one bro.
32 minute infomercial.  Great!
Motion race works has the hoes. 😂😂
Does anyone else remember watching the late night sales guys showing knives and all the pieces that come in the set? Clearly Cleetus does , here on the Cleetus shopping network lol. Grats on the purchase guys
Obviously good guys because they love fast stuff and boxers
🤘🤘
Should hook up Kyle from boosted Boiz with one of those catch cans for the Roudesy...😂🤙🏼
@2:22 you shoulda said “the u.s. of a” idk it sounded better in my head
CNC is fucking rad.  I love making the machines dance.  Good on ya for getting in on some proper manufacturing.
Congrats on new adventure ! Does Motion make a angled permanent install oil fill tube for a LT1 2020 Camaro and I have a 2015 6.2L Silverado ?  Hate spilling oil all over running down the engine when doing oil changes.
You guys came a long way 👍👍👍
Where did coop go
Didn’t know Seth rogan was the head machinest
Texas speed standing in the background* "Wtf bro??"
I wish Cooper would have been apart of this 😔😔
Some YouTubers sell out when they start getting big.  Cleeter BUYS out.
Very cool. Congratulations man. Well deserved.
Hell yeah brother!
So is jack-stand still employee or partner??
Next investment will be Holley. Hahaha 😂
The decals on the cars are more than “helpin a buddy” now!! 👌
8:34 🤣🤣
Congratulations 🎈🎉🍾🎊 on the new adventure and I hope that you guys have an amazing run with your new company
as much as I enjoyed the Jet Boat models... a bikini clad machinist would make a statement.
Just gotta get rid of Biden or we wont be allowed to race cars.
Kind of disappointing that the “Cleetus” edition parachute handles don’t say “Whoa Brother!!!”
congrats been with you guys since day one!
if i didnt know you were an american with that burnout i would of sworn you were an aussie nice
What a great team.   True Americans working together. 👍😎
14:52 haha
Is coop pissed at this point?
1:00 and I'm already grinning like an idiot lmao, James' face is so priceless
Best part about this move is....Made In The USA!  The Bald Regal burnout seals the deal and now Cleet will be re-investing in his own Corp. with all the builds!  Doug, Cleetus and James are a natural partnership from the git-go so it's going to boost the Motion brand you can bet yer sweet bippy!
Garrett and James, you two are the foundation of making the racing world a better place. Developing your own dreams into a reality. Trying to give back to the racing community! Not just making content for own wealth, but for your viewers that love you and the Cleetus community. Thank you for being the inspiration of many! Hell Yeah Brother!!!!!
Brother yall should build a sponsor car there in the parking lot from just MR parts!!
An American making American parts so Americans can Murica everyday. Sniff  who cutting onions!
Hell yea brother god bless made in America 🇺🇸
Happy Pride month to you too 🏳️‍🌈
Congrats!
🤣🤣🤣🤷🏼‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ I was wondering why u put them huge ugly dog shit stickers on mullet!🤮 looks horrible
Congratulations guys, and Thank You!!  I think this venture is going to be a good thing for all of us..
Normal Boss, screws up things and walks away.   Congratulations on you next adventure.
Seems like every month is a month of freedom :D
Haven’t even watch the video yet and I liked it
Youtube is certainly funding your great life.....and investments and racetracks and cars and boats and trucks and toys.....good luck to ya I suppose.
Cleetus at first official owners meeting, "so cleet what do you think about our ford line of parts?" Cleet: "wait, what? We sell ford parts?  Well we should drop the ford line and focus on hovercraft parts."
Congratulations guys where to go USA
Hell ya brother
Great stuff :-)
This is my favorite place ever!  I got my boxer laying on my lap right now.
💯💯The Buick runs 💯💯that's great you guys got a  machine shop
FIRE ME UP!!!!
I was a machine operator for a long time...  Some of the hardest workers in America...  Then I started writing the G-Code for all the CNC machines, That became my love and passion...
You can get a good look at a t-bone by sticking your head up a bulls ass, but i'll take the butchers word for it. "tommy boy" Good luck guys
As a mechanic and a machinist, I approve all of this!! ❤️🤘
Congratulations guys!!!! Love your channel and cant wait to see what the future brings!! Big hi from Sydney Australia!
Will the special edition wheels come crooked? 😛😲
Congratulations brother. I'll just leave it at that
Yes! Just yes! Congrats brother!
Cleetus to overtake Motor Trend
I love you guys and your content.... Its scary though because I loved roadkill the same way and when they went corporate they left YouTube, went pay to watch then died out in my opinion. I'd be heartbroken for that happen to you guys. Anyway, take care and cheers from Liz and Jay, Morehead Kentucky
cool infomercial, its almost like you sold out.
I know everyone wants to do their own thing and get ahead in life but I feel bad for Cooper. He is missing out big time. Cleetus is a freaking legend!
Where is the merch
Congratulation man you guys have work your ass for it👏👏👏
I think a 2jz line would be dope they’d probably kill it too
hell yeah brother congrats man im proud of yall you have came such a long way since you worked for 1320 keep it up brother
So here's an idea but I think an expensive one, how about customer wire harnesses for different vehicle with manufacturer specific connectors?
Why isn't it a red, white and blue kit 1ea for valve covers, and valley or 90*
Congratulations Cleet and Jack stand Jimmy!!
Stoked for you guys 🤘
Thanks Cleetus. I appreciate what you do
Seth Rogen is your head machinist? That's cool!
Congratulations
Congratulations, that is awesome!
30 minute infomercial? What next, a 10% stake in Flex Seal? LOL
Love motion tech tips and products.  Congratulations
Unexpected and soooo badass
I can see Freedom Factory branded crate engines coming in the not too distant future.
Haha, a solid business decision, but kinda weak youtube Go To.
Sounds like he has afew days to live
Seth Rogan
How is this at all good for the channel? It’s just a personal investment and will only result in more shameless plugs for MR stuff.    I don’t see why any of us should care one bit.    I get you are excited to invest and diversify but you don’t make videos about your 401k investments because no one cares.
The blue valve covers look nasty on Donny.
If there was a love button id hit that shit hell yeah brother I did a burn out just for you after this video!!!! Hell yeah brother support your passion!!!!
welcome to Iowa. lot of good business here.
u should open up a motion race works at the freedom factory
I think old clet has been packing my amazon packages also.
I think we all aspire for cleetus’s level of chill, also between this and the lz “farm” its cool to see some of the chillest humble youtubers making it. Goals af.
is it bad that I kinda want to buy a corvette for the sole purpose of having something to put cleetus branded valve covers on?
What about parts for Audi!  I wish they make Audi parts more available so it's cheap like Chevy and Honda.
Motion race works is in iowa? YOU WERE IN IOWA??!? I’m such a huge fan but live in a small town in iowa and want to meet you so badly someday, you’re a huge inspiration to me and I wanna do things you do someday but have no idea how. P.S. it would mean so much if you were to reply to this comment just saying lol
He must have sold a lot of freedom factory  dirt . for that investment lol.  Next year .motion race works . alloy shavings and a hat for $300
You need to open a shop in 🇦🇺 mate
Congrats brothers!!! Hard work constantly paying off!!!
Congratulations mate. You deserve all the success this industry can offer, big love from down under 👌🏽
so this is why he went to visit the shop a few months ago, now it all makes sense (^:
So... does this mean we will get a chance to see you race near iowa now?
Welcome to the swamp of CNC !  It has a few highs however it has very deep LOOOOOOWS !
Good job cleeter and james and gys
Ford is still in business?
Some very cool stuff Cleetus and looks like a good investment. Good luck to you and Jack Stand.
Bro love its a ford and chevy all shop its awesome
he called the billet a block, come on man, you know the jargon, you own 25% of a parts company, use the right words.
What sunglasses does old jack stand wear?
HELL YEAH, BROTHER!!!  Now I have an excuse to build a turbo kit for my car! Too bad it’s a German car and they probably won’t have a kit Also, any part that Cleetus or Jackstand personally make should definitely be signed
buys part of motion raceworks and immediately makes 32 minute ad for motion race works.
Be in Florida in Feb or March hopefully get to me y'all my son runs around everywhere say heck yeah brother your on the YouTube lol he's 4 lol and I wanna send yall some of our shirts
Good Move Cleet
Congratulations. Love the pups, got 2 boxers my self.
I so glad for y'all
Long live Florida man ✊🤘🏎💨🇺🇸🦅
This is cool. My guess was Cleetus Jr is otw.
im guessing him and James are biz partners , from the freedom factory ? and now this ?
Those old guys in whigs gave us the opportunity to do what you’ve enjoyed. They signed that Declaration of American freedom knowing that King George was coming after them. Our Constitution has lasted 230 yrs where worldwide the average lifespan of 17yrs! American exceptionalism is not bragging or arrogant, it’s fact. I celebrate your success. Thank you for your outstanding sportsmanship and humor. You and James are good partners. Do it for Dale! Hell Yeah Brother!
I got a idea for a trans cooler with my design you never burn a transmission down no matter how long you stand on the chip. I'll try to reach out to motion race works and I'll give Doug my design. Should be a easy fit to modify a product he sells already
You could build a whole fox body from motion, it might cost you $1M...
reminds me of the guy talking at the beginning of the dukes of hazard when they just the bridge
14:00 they the chip chicks
Okay ok ok. We need to see the McFarland LCAC beach in a cloud of smoke that is Cleetus on board/deck the LCAC in one of the burn out machines letting it rip. Then the door comes down on the LCAC and Cleetus lets it rip off the LCAC onto land while the jet boats spray rooster tails everywhere. That would be epic but what do I know I'm STONEDay.
I don’t own a car but need a set of the valve covers and a catch can just cause
Ole Cleet started saying the s word. 🤭
Could you develop upgrades for Leeroy to go faster?
bring back the camo hoodie
Heck yeah!
Awesome!
Me: babe, Garrett bought 20% of Motion Raceworks!   Babe: him and James look like Beavis and Butthead right now 31:40
awesome! congratulations@@@@@@@@@@
Hell yeah brother
This Lucas fella looks short but he is probably 5'10. James and Garrett made me feel short at 6'0 in person
You guys are the gosh dang dream team. Such good guys! Congrats, can’t wait to see what is to come
Dude that is so awesome
👍
Suddely i need parts for my stock gmc sierra... I wonder why lol
Smart as he** guys
Thinks he's still in Australia doing brunouts
Boxer's running the whole place, a boxer as a boss, where do I put in a app!
It's so  cool  to see, and continually watch your growth as both an icon, and a person. Congratulations on all of your continued success. I've been cheering you on for several years now, and enjoying the ride!
I remember when McFarland fab was a joke, so excited for this
Freedom 😎
Congrats
You never fail to surprise us.
DUDE BRO..... That is so Regal I just bald!!!  Hit the boys up at Mountain Mafia when you come through North Idaho. It's pure Havoc Racing! Last right before you hit Canada on 95. Seriously. Havoc breaking parts. The sweetest honey BBQ.
Awd burnout car or truck that's what you guy's should build
Yeah I figured either motion raceworks or Texas Speed happy to see its motion raceworks those guys are the best
Bet cooper feels really dumb now for leaving lol
That burnout gave me chills! So freaking epic!
Excellent choice investing in the future🤘
Mans it’s bad ass I was just forming some parts up for motion raceworks today at work!
Hopefully soon Motion starts making stuff for mopar vehicles, I know a couple of guys who watch the channel that drive some suped up Dakotas that would love to buy some Cleetus branded stuff
King of YouTube
James, you can say "we" instead of "they" now!
Pay last months parts bill, na we will just buy 20% of your company!!! Lol
Ole Cleeter really in his bag💰💰
Is someone who's been following your channel almost since the very beginning, I'm so proud of you guys. This is a perfect matchup and I can't wait to see what this big move does for you. Thanks for bringing us along the journey. Hell yeah brothers
I think the line should be named Cleeter Built Parts 😎👍🇺🇸🦅🦒
So happy to see the money moves. This is big for motion too. I know they’ll get a lot more sales from me just knowing you partially own them
Day 1 of asking cleeter to buy a car and build it with strictly motion parts
SOOOO pumped for you guys!  What an awesome adventure of a life you live!
MOVING ON UP MR. CLEETUS.  GOOD FOR YOU.  I CONCUR WITH EVERYONE ELSE ON THE BUSINESS MOVE.
Congrats to you all for such an epic step forward. Keep in mind all the new rules coming in that are going to mess up your rights to modify your vehicles. It's a good thing Cleetus is part Lawyer, you're going to need it. EV's are going to happen regardless, but it's your right to race whatever you want on the track. Don't let the fun police stop you. I'd suggest running for local office and work your way up, but why not just go big and run for President? I only hope I'm in the USA when you do. That would be a fun election. Hell Yeah Brother.
fell like i just watched a 32 min infomericial
Nelk making their own booze and cleet with car parts on the same week now , big week for the YouTube boys
BOXER LOVER TOO. HAD ONE FOR 12 YRS.GREAT FAMILY DOG. BOXER RESCUE IS THE BEST!
I'm surprised you haven't made this move before. I'm all on board and will be buying and plugging. Excellent job guys!!!!!!!
Its Freedom Month
The biggest move of our burnout career ever
Hell yea cleeter, jackstand, u guys are doing big moves. Been watching around the time of Leroy after two months of u getting it. Sooooo pumped for u guys and Matty
Good god I just want to come work and do shit for dale
The 652 at the time of me making this comment, can I ask why, Cleetus is the most loving guy I've ever seen and he is nothing less than the most American person I've ever met (sadly more than our own president) but beside that he represents every American proudly please change that to a thumbs up!!!
Can we get a shot of James just squirting shit 😂😂😂😂omg I died
Let’s Goooo
Any company with that many Boxers has my seal of approval! AND MotionRaceworks use Fedex which makes life awesome for buying stuff from Australia, My Fedex guy is almost family now!
Success and nothing less, best of luck to you guys🤘🤘
great step huge possibilitys.
Congratulations
Congrats dudes can't wait to see what you guys all end up making. Definitely gonna purchase soon
I’ve been here since you filmed everything in Jeremy’s garage at his house. It’s been a blast watching you grow. In a world full of negativity your channel is just what a bunch of people need when they get home. Good on you man, congrats, keep the cool vids coming. Thanks for what you give us.
I’ll have to pick up a throttle body for my coffee table
I've got a buddy who recently bought the shop he's spent the better part of over a decade at located in the midwest.. small shop, they make plastic injection mold dies. If you guys are lookin for another partner to help produce parts I believe he wants to get his foot in the parts production arena, located in the midwest. Food for thought for future made in the us of a parts!
Hell yeah, Iowa represent. Dewitt IOWA WOOT WOOT
I’m a CNC Machinist and I run Haas machines daily. Everything in your video I’m familiar with. Pretty Rad. 👍🏻
glad i skipped to the end
Your packaging solutions are great, a piece of cardboard and a thin sheet a plastic thats all, not 5 lbs of thick plastic that requires a gas torch to open, small things like this will make a difference when it comes to waste. Bravo motion race works, more should follow your lead.
HELL YEA BROTHER!!!! AMERICA FUCK YEA lol
After a day of hard work I was so excited to watch this video I tried taking my pants off before my work boots witch caused even more delayed time from me being able to watch this video. 🤣
Is that Seth Rogan ??
Congrats bro from ur virgin islands follower
We are so proud of you brother. Thank you for everything you do for us and everything you've done for yourself. All the big victories you've been able to make happen feel like little ones that we have all had the honor of taking part in. Keep up the great work brother. And thank you for staying off motortrend lol.
You should of signed some ordered parts !
I know you guys probably don't give a dang  but I'm so freaking proud of yall
Ok I get it. Buy parts from motion raceworks
Big boy toys need big boy moves congratulations gentlemen
Hellll yeeeaa brother!!!! Congrats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So uuuuuuuh I can't wait to see ol cleeter skeeter racing Travis Pastrana in his rally subi vs cleetus in a corvette
Commercial BS ruining good videos. Your off my list.
Seen very few sealed boxers! Very nice dogs
They are going to grow much bigger together as long as Cleetus doesn't touch anything in the production line lol
Hell Ya Brother!!
Motion Raceworks please make Miata parts. I mean everyone loves miatas and does all kinds of swaps into them.
hell yeah brother ! enjoy the fruits of your labor while putting smiles on our faces through your videos and merch. when i move to Florida i will be visiting Freedom Factory. with my old civic from high school which i still have lolol
Hell yeah brother I can't wait to put some of motion race works stuff on my future build
@13:56 Uh, I think you were supposed to lift that hopper-bin into the dumpster, and dump those shavings in the back of the dumpster... Now there's a factory where it doesn't suck to work.  All those guys probably have good attitudes because they all probably are racers, and know that they're providing a really cool service to the racing/enthusiast community!
You can build a car with all that stuff
The absolute most wholesome channel on the YouTube!, Keep chasing those dreams fellas!, Never stop!
So happy for you guys cleetus, I've been watching for years upon years and it's nuts how far the channel and you have come.
I am a HAAS tech. You need some pallet changers on those mills for maximum bald eagles!
Would yall consider fabricating long tubes and mid pipes for  mopars?
a biggole fire me up
MATCHING BLUE CLEETUS INTAKE BY MOTION RACEWORKS
You are legendary. Big props💪🏽.
Now all he needs is a tire sponsor.
Stoked for you guys! Let’s 3D print some metal parts!
Congratulations you guys great match with motion
holy shit
😭brother this brings a tear to the ole eye
Look out people no one can stop cleetus now!!!...racing content like u wouldn't believe.. Hell Yeah Brother!!!

Bro I got cold chills man I can't wait to be apart of this journey you guys are about to go on hell yeah brother 🤘🤘
I never hit the like button on videos but today I made an exception. I fully support this and can't wait to see what happens next.
James needs his own logo for his parts!! 🤘🏼💯🔥
Congrats Brothers!!!
Life changing???  Wait til you have kids!!
Mullet eagle stickers...........I want thayat
Awesome job cleeter and James!!!   Cant wait for more! 🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸
You should make parts for a 1992 Ford truck
Would be cool if Cleet just walked around and signed random product packaging.
Yeah cleetus
Need diesel products!!!
A direct investment into an American company making American parts. That’s a solid month of freedom power play.
Going to be one hell of a season for fleet and the boys! Let’s break world records boys
So whens a guy gunna do some Vice Grip collabs?
Do you make any parts for a Ford Focus RS? If you do I'll buy everything from you guys.
Congrats guys! Love your hustle!
Wait... last year you bought the freedom factory, this year you buy motion raceworks life is good for cleeter.
Smart man! You now have unlimited access to ripping at it’s finest! I’m jealous, so very jealous. Props man. It’s a win win for you and Motion Raceworks. Living the AMERICAN DREAM!! 🇺🇸
Congratulations brother you guys have been making such great and wise moves. Hell with asking Marcum I'm asking Cleetus and James lmfaoooo
I swear I thought he bought a nascar before watching
Also just realized you are in Iowa. Live in Norwalk!
Congrats!
Buys 10% of nitto tires
15 years from now, "I've purchased 15% of mountain dew"
I just graduated Lincoln tech for CNC programming and have been working on St20 HAAS Lathes and VF1 and VF2 HAAS Mills for the past 3 months It would be A dream to work for you
Ahh makes sense with the big motion sticker now on mullet and kevin saying how much did they pay you for that
SOO pumped for you guys... To infinite and beyond!!
Never knew motion did so many other things. Definitely going to start purchasing from them vs the bigger names.
Nice I know where I'm going for my tow rig and sierra build parts
So McFarland fab is an actual thing now?
Congratulations!!!
Motion Raceworks going off road?1
That's awesome! CNC machines are great! That's what I'm currently doing and want to end my career with.
Great investment 👍
And still dumbing down Americans by using a Hawk screech......and he says "I love Bald Eagles".....lol
For the chute handles, you should have an option to get 'Holy Sh*t' machined in. Will give a new meaning to a holy shit handle.
.....................................so can i get sidekick parts now because the tracker existed?
Looks like Cleetus approached Motion about setting up his own line of parts through them and they said they needed more space to do that so Cleet went ahead and bought them the space
Heh 😏 would be Doin it for Dale, if Cleetus and motion race works could help me get what I need to get my ls swap on my Camaro back on track, owned the car 13 years since I was 16 o.O really need some help getting what I need would love to hit up ls fest next year and then do the Texas mile 🥺
That intro..... gets a standing ovation!!!
Haas CNC 🤔 hmm, maybe future Formula Cleetus?
So hyped for ya cleet, had a feeling something like this was comin after the last vid ya did up there.  Cant wait to see whats in store for the future
Is it only domestic vehicle parts?
Haas makes good stuff, same kind I work on!
To bad that I wouldn't get a chance to buy anything from motion race works.. they don't make parts that I need to boost my application.. but awesome cleetus for joining them in quest of making awesome parts
Barra products please
Explains the comment to Kevin about the sticker on mullet 😂👍
Man...yall hiring? Lol but low-key not
21:43 all the rock auto magnets...automatic turn off for me if their mechanics rely on that shit company
Dang Cleet, I started watching you a year before the FF. And to see how far you have came make me happy for you and the whole family. God Bless brother. Never stop reaching higher.
Wow, congratulations guys !  Loving the factory tour, that was awesome.  You guys should definitely start a marine division of Motion Race Works !
Name it mcfarland fab
Wondering why he had such a BIG Motion Race Works sticker on the side of Mullet..
I have a question anyone is free to answer, it seems that they cut off majority of aluminum during the milling process, do they end up melting the shavings down and reusing the metal? and couldn't that be a easy spot to get imperfections in the metal?
Cleetus can you make a mopar m1 intake for the 360 magnum motor nobody makes them anymore
Congrats cleeter!! That's really awesome news brother!!
The first video im not watching. But congrats to you guys.
Congratulations! Next up: having a Motion Raceworks outlet on the Freedom Factory property for easy access to parts on race day. :) #monthoffreedom #hellyeahbrother
HELL YEAH BROTHER!  living the AMERICAN DREAM
Haas? Let's jump to ridiculous conclusions and say Formula 1 is in their future. Of course that's not how they roll, but it is what wishfully came to mind
Before i even try to watch, it better be a brand deal with Mountain dew!
Congratulations American Made ❤️
Cooper is punching the air right now
Congratulations to some really good people right here and true red blooded American proud men. Continued success in all you do Cleet fam!!
McFarland fabrication just took a huge leap
I feel like Coop fu**ed up….
Congratulations 🎊
Well done guys 🤓❤️
So you invested in a kick ass company to make it more kick ass? Sounds like a good investment.
Well done brother, I’m so pumped for you and loving watch you grow. I love everything you do mate
Check the camera parts falling down everywhere I'm missing a part
Congratulations!
awesome  congrats
Thank goodness it wasn't Motor Trend
Man, this is sooooooo epic!!! Really happy for everyone involved. But....don’t mean to be all doom and gloom, but what happens if that new asinine bill gets passed that is going after aftermarket car modification parts?
Im kinda disappointed🤣🤣🤣
I want to get a racecar now just so I can order from motion race works.  I wonder if their website is gonna crash now from so many people going on it haha
De Witt Iowa???   LOL  I haul them fiberglass swimming pools that are built just down the street from Motion race works. I never even realized i go right past the place a few times a week!
Congratulations!
So dang Pumped to see another big race car company in America getting major support! FREEDOM BABY!! That is spelled with made in the USA!! I will back an American made company before any other, and we all should show support by doing the same brothers and sisters! Lets Get it!! You can never have enough of Lock Tight, My cars name! Looking to support Motionworks , I need Volvo 4 cylinder exhaust flanges, 16 v and 8 v, engine torque plate for a b230, some oil fittings for a turbo swap I am doing currently, and a couple catch cans. How's that Volvo parts line coming along?!!
I like James,but he legit looks like a deer in the headlights on this one. I would too brother. I’d imagine it’s all like a dizzy dream.
“Yep” .. walks away from welder 😂
Waiting to see honda parts starting to be built for boosted boiz
Pretty rad Cleetus has included James.
So proud of you brother!!
Congratulations Garrett and James.
Hell yeah brother 💪🏻 follow your dreams boys. Use this as inspiration
Probably should have valve covers that say "Caution Bald Eagles Inside" or to that effect.   The set for the 4.3 in my van can say "caution, one tired wheezing bald eagle inside"
Good luck guys
Cooper Cooper if you had just stayed with the Boys :( .
Hell yeah brother 💪🏻 follow your dreams boys. Use this as inspiration
I’ll have a quick release in my lifted Toyota if y’all come out with a steering wheel
Cleet this is my life and career is engineering and then setting up the CNc machines to do stuff like this
Guess the Summit Racing is coming down.... LOL
Congrats you guys. Very happy for you.
So happy you guys are able to do what you want to do and live life to the fullest.
So many bald eagles that the light was about to die out and it just started. Back up when I saw the fluffy cloud 2:45
Wow, the way you guys are going it won’t be long till you are major stakeholders in Chevrolet!   Awesome stuff
Man I don’t even have a LS yet and I WANT that valley cover 💪🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
All I can say is. Cooper made a bad choice.
E90 Sedan LS SWAP kit???!?
Multiple flows!!!!!--
Now that is the best way possible to help the people geeter done and keep doing it for Dale
So no mountain dew sponsorship yet
Hell ya. Congrats man.
Mcfarland racing =MR Motion Racework = MR A coincidence ? Didn’t think so!!!
Gat dang infomercial!   But wait, there's more!
I legit thought he had actually bought Bradenton Motor Sports! But this is so awesome too!
Up next Texas speed shop right on site at the freedom factory
Holy shit
Hell yeah brother congrats
Yep definitely gonna be getting some cleetus parts when I start building my ls427 mini cooper
Building race cars always proceeded by driving them.  Maybe Cleetus can try his hand at solidworks and can deliver us some cool homemade pieces.
Time to build a fast Ford with all those great motion race works parts! Can't even pretend that their's a more reliable car in the fleet than neighbor!
Can we get James a mic now? Can barely hear a word he says most of the time
Wonder how much that ran him
Congratulations Guys it’s Cool to know one of your First Companies that helped you is Now a Part of your Future
Hell Yeah Brother!
Hell yeah guys. Take care of eachother first and above all.
Make some Merica theme   spark plugs wires
Good on you man, using your resources to keep a lifestyle alive👍🏼 keep on keepin’ on
Looks like we will be seeing a lot less part failures boys lol
this is going to be AWESOME!! great plan
Congrats, boys! You guys deserve all the awesomeness. There aren't any other cats working this hard and making videos at the same time.
Cleetus you bring tears to my eye a yanky that can do a burnout just like a Aussie.....  :)  .....
OK OK we get yall have parts
Thats a big move congratulations man can't wait too see more of you and motion rave works working together
BUY USA-Made!
NGL...I teared up a little watching this. So fuckin' awesome mate!!
The best way to make a small fortune in racing is to start with a large one.
HELL YA!! Super Proud of you guys just killing it! Best R&D channel on the YouTubes
now this is badass
Did i just thumbs up a half hour infomercial?🤔  Yep, guess so.
you can't cut these hands, bud
2 thumbs up guys
this video was pretty funny, with some tom foolery. I liked that
Good on you.    Interested to see what you bring to the table with them.    Happy to see what this does to the levels of the racecars.
the DOGS pack the order?! that is not legal!! Animal abuse!!
Productivity down 20% on the day of filming hahaha well done boys going to be good, be great to give feedback on new parts.
Congratulations Cleetus, living the dream brother!
I freaking love the YouTube Motorsport community going on right now; 1320 Video, Emilio's World, Cooper Bogetti, Boostedboiz, PFI Speed, Dr.Tune em all, JH Diesel, Angel Motorsports, Cleetus Mcfarland, Motion Racerworks, HOONIGAN, AllMotorPhong, Tom Bailey! I know I'm missing some but you all know who you are!!! Thank you so much for the amazing content and for giving us that awesome sense of community. You all gave us hope when times seemed bleak. You had our backs, and we will definitely have yours!  Aloha from Hawaii.
Yep..
Congratulations can't wait to see new developed parts we know they will be tested thoroughly now
What up homies
Well I don't think that counts as a sellout so I take back my concern. Think big, go big or go home.
Boy, howdy..that burnout  puts a whole new meaning to the term smoke the tires. fire me up cleetus.
Congratulations! Best wishes for a long and prosperous partnership!
Congratulations
Yeee haw lol
I think it's a great investment. It's not like these parts are not needed. All Y'All need this stuff and now you're associated with them and will be promoting MRW it'll soar even more!
When cleeter had a go at the welding an it fell off.. I haven't laughed that hard in a long time " I got this " 😂😂😂
Best part is Made in USA.
Cooper Spaghetti shoulda stuck around.....
What kinda cool big block dodge shit do they have? Most of the stuff I've seen is small block ford and ls
Extended lunch break for the guy wearing the Cleetus shirt... lmfao
McFarland race parts is next ! And jaxstand nos! Lol coming up! James is gonna have his name on nitrous bottles and blowing engines and making fast ass passes with a smile on his face when he’s not even there! Congrats big guys I wish I was living the race lives you guys are !
Please make 2jz parts, make na parts, make na-t parts, make tt parts, make just GTE parts please the 2jz market sucks and to have someone with your standard they would be so sought after
Good job guys!!!
since James joined the squad, cleeter has just kept going up!
You guys sell eBay turbos a fmu and PVC piping? Maybe a wideband?
I bet copper is wishing he stayed on unless he is in the back round ?.?.?..
So does this mean the Bald Eagle Cam will be coming to MRW now???
Any motion mopar parts to come? 👀👀
Ya guys know what your doing screw the government rn I'm tryna find a nice job for a bit an live my own life. An start a business easy kinda definitely would take a bit to start you guys did it tho so that's sick
How rad is it that this guy not only made it doing what he loves, but he brought his friends along with him. That’s a real hell yeah brother there. I’d be happy to come help out with a project one of these days or take you on another flight cleetus, get some of your boys up in the air too.
Hell yeah brother. This is that good stuff.
Hell yeah brother
Are we gonna have parts with James name on them
Meanwhile I'm trying to diagnose why I'm still getting P0327 and P0332 codes when I JUST replaced knock sensors on my 5.3
I wondered when you put those massive Motion stickers on Mullet in yesterday's vid
U should feature the workers not the machines.
Motion works needs diversity
Congratulations ceeltus and Jack stand
The sound when that vacuum seal plastic hit then parts! Hhaha
Congratulation cleetus and James you guys partnered up with a great company God Bless America from Scott in Norwich Connecticut
Black is the new blue
Congratulations guys. Makin big moves boys, BIG MOVES 🤘🤘
I would really love for you guys to start offering stuff for the gen 3 hemi guys would definitely help not only me but a lot of other people out too
Looks like cleeter sold some amc!
Dude I’m so fuckn proud and happy for u dawg.  Let er eat, let er rip tater chip, bald eagles are shouting with joy n approval
Good job guys I'm happy for both of you.
HAAS, #1 in machining, #19/#20 F1
Every big step forward the cleetergang takes.. The big leap it feels for the future of car culture.
Do not let the typical machine shop drama or shenanigans happen to you.
Hell yeah brother!! That’s freakin awesome!
Nice!! Looks like a great investment... :-) Seems like a great company... :-)
HELL YEAH BROTHA!!!! congrats guys!!
How many thought it was Mountain Dew he got cleetus signed on 🤷🏼‍♂️🤔
If there is one thing in this world Cleetus hates its tires!
I need VW parts 🤣
I guess the Motion Raceworks sticker on the side of the el camino isn't "too big" anymore lol
Congrat Cletus and James its so good to see that you and Motion Raceworks are doing great things together.
We need Motion Gen3 Hemi parts !
Awhile back, I got a recommendation to watch a video of a guy bidding on a Corvette, winning it, and bringing it home. What a wild ride it has been since then! Congratulations guys!!! Hard work with a little fun, pays off!!!
Congrats guys!
DUDE YOU TOUCHED EVERYTHING!!!  i bet it took hours to clean up after hurricane Cleetus
Heck yeah bro congrats
Wowww you really hyped us up for a shill...
“We’ve gone ahead and shorten lunch breaks to five minutes” I’m dead
Please support the RPM act or this will be a bad deal.
wow! congrats you two! ive been using motion on all my build including a few youtube video on my channel but how can anyone sit there are hit the thumbs down? unbelievable, they could only dream of being part of such a great company! keep it going broz!
I hope James has a percentage of motion and not the company he works for.
Cleeter is great at a few things, one is knowing who is good at something and delegating duties accordingly. Another is coming up with good content. He also has a great following of simple minded fans.  However unless the video is just a skit, he is very hillbilly on the engineering & manufacturing side, so pour the money in and promote, but keep the hands out for quality's concern.
@5:46 didn’t know Seth Rogan worked there!
I now know what HAAS makes :) supporting f1 and drag racing
Fookin Awesome!!  Congrats!
I’m surprised you’re machining some of those parts from solid billet. That’s one of the most expensive ways to make a product. You could have those angles cast for 1/4 of the price and still have the strength required. You should have someone that knows what they’re doing come through and show you other options for production. Of course a guy that loves CNC will want to CNC absolutely everything. 😂 I love CNC but business is business and there is no need to chip some of those parts from billet.
That was the loss prevention unit following James and Cleet, casting no aspersions, just keeping the inventory honest.(22:49)
Ahhh..... What about the clean Air act?  When they pass laws about no aftermarket parts on cars in the US & no more racing factory cars???  You and the Summit Racing guys will be selling stock Crown Vic valve covers with "Hell No Brother" on them!!
I’m not going to lie, this video actually got me a little emotional. Been with you guys from the start and it makes the fans feel like we’re a part of it and along for the ride. Congratulations and much success 🇺🇸
Is. . is this the first time that Cleetus has cursed in one of his videos? I feel like it is.
Does James have any ownership when it comes to this or is he just on your payroll?
Flange falls off before he can even get a tack on it.. "Ehhhhh.... Yep." *gets up and leaves
Congratulations brother !!!! Helll yeahhh !!!
So does this mean boat parts are in the future?
Congratulations, it’s awesome to see young family come together and make big moves. I hope you guys have all the success you could ever dream of. I love seeing good thing happen to good people.
Congrats bro this is huge
Genius
Be honest I like them even more because they have a Dr Pepper Skin on The soda machine
Man, I wish the shop I work at had that much space. I think we've got nearly as many machines, and half the space.
Deff love these guys there just like me and you just cooler 😂 and JH the fun with tht guy is unreal these guys are my superstar fuck Tom Brady let talk about my boys jh garza Cletus jackstand Tom Bailey 💪👍🤞👌👉🏁🏁🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
bad ass news happy for you cleeter
Thats so freaking awesome
As a manual machininst i love this yall are truly living my dream!!!
Motions shop reminds me a lot of when I worked at Wiseco/JE Piston. All you hear all day is the machines howling away. I miss it sometimes.
Big moves Big Bug Moves...!
This right here, my friends, is what Mr. Jefferson thought of, when he wrote those famous words "The right to Bald Eagles, Freedom, and the Pursuit of Happiness" Well done, boys, I'm so proud of you all! Congratulations Cleeter, James, Doug, et. al.
Hell yeah brother congratulations to you and James the fucking awesome
Dude been following you from the beginning and your doing it all perfectly. Congrats on the big decision and you'll never regret it. Best of luck!!!!!!
You just made a deal what's a shop that makes materials for fast cars they are funnier than you just saying brother good job that's a great company to work with peace brother I'm out
How did Nelk release their own seltzer and the Cletus with the car parts on the same day. It’s like Christmas
Wasn’t expecting Seth Rogan to show up
Living the dream dude
Man proud of you went from a  dam duck calls on blow of valve to this,hell yea brother keep it up man
You have come a long way since shredbull buddy. It is truely amazing what you have achieved just doing what you love to do. You have an infectious personality and you truely are just a great human. Keep the great content coming and let the bald eagles fly brother.
Aren't they trying to do away with modifying cars and going all electric?
Hell yeah brotha
I can see you selling out but James.....very upsetting...
Oh boy…. When you build the actual race team, it’s going to be like a full bald eagle colony
Amazing man seeing your journey to this level from homebrew hooligan stuff to full blown racing legend
I know your both Chevy guys, but I would be pretty cool to see a line of Ford parts too
Are they only available in drive by cable?  That's all I've seen so far...
i am not  going to lie i new before you even said it was motion raceworks, but in my heart i was hoping something like texas speed or blueprint engines
The "Science, dude" at 7:16 killed me 😂
I’m really exited for you guys and exited for the business in general, i feel like this is gonna go big big, I’m personally interested in a lot of their products, well your products now aswell so let’s go, wish the best for you guys 🙏🙏🙏
Congrats to BOTH parties involved. Looks to be a great deal for all
Congrats !! You'll make a great team with them !
Does MRW have any plans to get into the import market?
Ticker symbol MCFD coming 2023
That's a very grown up and awesome decision.
Que lástima que no hablo inglés , quisiera saber todo lo que dices😏😏😂🤘
McFarland Raceworks!!! Congrats to everyone involved.
Lucas looks like bald eagle Seth Rogan
14:52 The look on his face when it drooped.
Made up for you guys what you have achieved is what dreams are made of freaking awesome much love from the U.K.🇬🇧
Hell yea brother nothing but freedom
I’m a machinist. And I love cars.. now we talking
Wow such big news! I figured there was something behind the giant sticker on Mullet!! Exciting! Congratulations everyone!! Edit: Just came to me that Doug put Derek from VGG in the drivers seat of El Toro and now all this is even more exciting!!
Congratulations! Cartrepeneur!
Jack stands laugh at @6:57 🤣🤣 god I love him!!
In comes sinister diesel, did you say blue?
2JZ parts please!
I see the machines are made by Haas Automation. I guess you will have to hook up with Stewart-Haas Racing now. If Tony has the time I'm sure you guys could have some fun.
My dude do it for dale
Doin big things! Bring manufacturing back to bradenton!
Let’s go!!!
This legit made me cry, so happy for you guys, from turbo whistles and breast implants into turbo fans etc, to this, helllllll heahhhhhhh broootthherrrrrrr
Thats an Ad #southpark
I love how the first comment spoiled the whole video
Congrats guys. I've worked in machine shops for most my life. It's hard work, but it's rewarding. The real joy comes from the problem solving and making beautiful parts.
When the student becomes the master!!  Hell yeah brother!
Hell yeah brother!  This is awesome I'm so stoked for the future of the channel.
can we get sum bmw e46 /e36 parts please guysssss
Congrats
I cannot wait to get my engine bay Built by “Cleetus McFarland” LSSWAPTHEWORLD
Congrats!
Unrelated but, I just watched a 32 advertisement for motion raceworks and I didn’t even mind lol
Congrats dude.
This dude doesn't say anything about the EPA for 4 months and then gets 20% of motion raceworks what a F****** SELFISH CLOWN!!!!!
It is fantastic you have put yourself in a position like this, investing in something you love to do.  What concerns me is the post made about a week ago on the other channel "EPA vs. Motorsports - RPM Act".  It seems risky to me to invest in something that the government is pushing to snuff out.
Hell yeah brother!!!!!
Wow Impressive 👊
Not gonna lie, it takes a LOT of bald eagles to buy that much debt BUT, I see where you're at and what you and the channel bring to their ability to reach their market. I knew this was lucrative. I mean, OBVIOUSLY. Surely, this isn't a personal investment but one made on behalf of Cleetus, Inc/FF, llc/none-of-my-business business, instead. I can't believe you'd sign a contract that left you personally liable. RIGHT?! ;)  I'm sorry. I meant to start this with "Congratulations! Way to GO!"
congratulations.
Congratulations, you're living the dream guys, and I'm not even jealous, cause I know you appreciate the fans, and what you've got, very inspiring 👍🏁🇨🇦
Hell yeah brother, amazing news! Happy for y'all!
Quick question Cleetus I'm fixing up a old truck and was wondering if a Edelbroc carburetor was better than a Holley carburetor?
It' a huge step forward!
Nice 👌
My next tattoo " you cant cut these hands, bud"
Don't forget where u come from.
From literally day one. Garrett has just been a business man, just doing business. He has done it very well too.
Please tell me there's going to be a raceweek upload today😬
You better be making a James edition  set of jack stands 😂
I would've bet my last dollar that he bought the drag strip next door to the freedom factory wouldn't of thought of this lol
This is sick
Lets go Jackstand and Cleeter!
Wondering what James has planned for the Motion Raceworks Nitrous division
Can y’all make me a Subaru flat six that revs to 9K and makes 400 horse?? Thanks in advance!
Hope you gpna ship parts to canada that be freaking siick!!
ZERO things happening on the buildings addition until Cleet opened the door to the outside. THEN Drills start drilling and machines start beeping! LMAO
Imagine having a $2000 motion gift card
make an air filter that looks like an eagles head for your turbo
I was hoping that you were gonna be introducing a top fuel team....
I just sat through an infomercial and I’m not even mad. Hell yeah brother
shit james
Much excitement! I freakin love it dudes!
As now,574 ppl dislike this video🤔 574 ppl who are not true fans,574 haters ..how can you dislike a video when you see someone growing up in business and making his dreams come true? Maybe same ppl who dislike the video of the opening of freedom factory 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ keep it going cleetus and james ,sky is the limit
Very cool news! Things have been turned up a notch! I thought maybe you guys were going to team up with Tom Bailey or with Vaughn and Chelsea  on some crazy projects or making another big purchase! I got the purchase part right just wrong team! So cool guys congrats!!
Hell yeah brother 🤘🏻 congrats man. Y’all truly deserve this. Wishing you great things to come on this new journey 🙏🏻
88-98 parts would be badass like parachute kits, steering columns s
And of course all of those special freedom edition parts have an extra 50 horsepower for each special part that you mount..... hell yeah brother !!!🤣😎
Get some
I’m currently learning CNC work and seeing this video is some good motivation. This is awesome!
Rad boys!! but 1 question....how does this effect your Summit Sponsorship?  I didnt even know they sold atv parts. I loooove Summit Racing now!
Cleetus figures he will make his investment back just in money saved on parts.....GENIUS
You do realize the saying "You use so much X, you should buy shares" is meant to be a joke right?  Awesome announcement.
Cleetus for 2024 election 🇺🇸
HOT. DIGGITY. DOG!!!!!
Congrats guys that's exciting news!
havent seen cooper in the videos in a while, i guess this is why lol
We all gonna ignore them using a harbor freight  quinn digital torque wrench  ?
Congrats kudos to you guys
Cooper should be a part of this as well, I dont like not seeing him at that table. He was there day one when all others were not
Ya need a new sign.... Freedom Factory\Motion RaceWorks Testing Grounds
Congratulations Team Cleatus .. awesome power moves  . Hint . .new import part .. turbo muffler delete.. VW .Audi .. .and some Honda parts .. Yeeee Yeee
great job boys!!
Diversify, diversify, diversify.
Motion McFarland Racing ! MMR
Definitely gunna throw some cleetus parts on my LS build. Big moves!! Love watching the evolution of the Cleetus McFarland channel. Been following since Leroy got the LSA blower and haven’t missed a video since!
thank they have s10 stuff yay starting my 95 s10 stick
Shout out to Doug from Motion Raceworks!
we got your whistlin bungholes, your spleen splitters, whiskey biscuits, honkey lighters, hoosker doos, hoosker donts, cherry bombs, nipsy daisers, with or without the scooter stick and a whistlin kitty chaser. we got it all
Thank you cleetus for supporting a U.S. business
Wtf dude money grub

14:40 another part on the way to Cooper....
I'll take you to the candy shop.   Congrats guys
Good for you can’t believe you went from turbo whistles on the Ram 1500 to this hell ya brother!
Where’s the Honda stuff?
I'm so happy to be a part of this and to be here seeing you grow from duck calls in the C7 exhaust to being the baddest car YouTuber out there. Absolutely epic. Love yall keep it up!
What do they do with all the aluminum chips from those machines? Send the back to the foundry?
Fortune favors the bold  Y’all are rolling
Super pumped for ya guys Garrett and James 💪🏻. Keep on hustlin!
Freaking eh Boys! Good for you man!
I think Cleeter will reverse engineer the Warbird engine he bought and start ma$$ producing it.
THATS A BIG FIRE ME UP!! GO CLEET!!!
Congrats guys! I am so happy for you! 🇺🇸☺👍🇺🇸
Congrats men ! 🇺🇸🇺🇸💪🏼
Congratulations
Yes yes yes....this is awesome beyond belief. My builds have just been stepped up since this merger. Possiblitys are endless now. Hell yea brother....
What a life you've made for yourself cleet! Couldn't be happier for you man can't wait for the content to just get better this is probably as huge as the freedom factory purchase!!
I meant to live my life the way you have.
Long time race mechanic and CNC programmer! Where do I apply??
Congratulations
"hefty blur on everything behind it" Everyone: <<10sec
HAAS  I seen that in Formula 1   DO THEY MAKE PARTS FOR HAAS??
hell yeah brother
Congrats on your investment!!
Not only do they support an American brand in MW, but, Haas CNC machines is also made in the USA, and has a Formula 1 team! This is amaze’balls!
Help with more import parts!
Cleetus is looking more and more like Joe Exotic.
They're definitely moving in 😂
guess who building a fresh unit for my 81 ford f250
Making big moves doesn't come close to describing this. Its freakin AMAZING the things a "youtuber" can accomplish when they're some extremely hard working people! Friendly reminder to all of cleeter fans, we NEED to make sure our representivives get our signed RPM act letters. Motion Auto Works and every company like them must survive for years to come!!!
Congratulations y’all this is freedom amazing!!!!
Congratulations guys your hard work is paying off.
I always said McFarland Racing was going to be a household name. Can you put McFarlane Racing on some of them it looks more professional. 🇺🇲🤘🇺🇲🤘🇺🇲🤘🇺🇲🤘🇺🇲
Ed would be so proud that his neighbor now owns a race track and 20% of a race company. The channel has evolved incredibly quickly since back then. You're killing it James and Garrett.
This video gave me chills man.
Why not own some of the parts company you use👍
I just moved back to Michigan from Denver Colorado to Michigan. I missed drag week last year now I'll miss it this year but thank you for your channel Cleetes. 1320 video boosted boys. KSR fasterproms. Making the day when I can race again. Freedom factory I lived by years ago.
But I drive a inline 5 VW
you can't box something up faster than a boxer that's just plain science
Ok James needs his own LOGO to add to the product line who agrees
Strong Tegridy Farms vibes 👨‍🌾
I wish you good luck man!
Excellent brother!   I am very very happy to hear this fantastic news. You guys are the best excellent team. I never miss Sn episode. Congratulations!!!
Big moves Cleetus
Retread or RESHREAD them tires???
Great news boys! Now we want a deep dive on machining all these parts!  Maybe a Motion Raceworks channel kind of like Kevin's KSR videos of the Mullet build.
I don't know if you guys have looked into this, but you can avoid hogging out a lot of these parts by starting with investment castings. The casting gets you 90% of the way, and then you just have to machine and finish the final touches. You can also make some crazy geometry pumps/chassis to minimize the assembled components at the machined level. Wall thicknesses can get down to .060 for some of the elbows you showed while including multiple bends in one part.
It's so cool watching this dude building his wealth the past few years.
My first guess was Holley, then Motion.
Gah dang. What I would do to get to work in that machine shop. I work in manufacturing machining but my heart is in cars. Motion Raceworks for the win!!
I hope my parts come w those classic McFarland welds boys and girls.    Congrats boys
I have a feeling there are going to be some intelligent designed new parts down the road with James' brain
Way To go!
Awesome news! Congrats!
Hell yeah brother! It’s awesome how far you guys have come, from goofy duck call videos to building a fleet of legitimate cars and a freakin racetrack and now this partnership. Keep it up !!
Best  move you guys could have ever made good ole Cleeter looking way into the future !!!!! And now James can go to the candy store when ever needed !!! Congrats on partnership boys I’m proud 🤗🤗🤗🔥🔥🔥
So proud of you cleet been watching the channel for almost 6 years I love the content and always will. Your a hero to me man
Suck that's you guys don't have a Mopar line of products, doesn't look like there's anything for me but still happy for you guys!! Dale would be proud
I know that if Cleetus has made it and tested it all himself I think that, anything you buy from him will be  the best parts you’ve ever bought
It’s just great to see how far you guys have come I have been watching your videos since before the duckcalls but that video was just awesome I been watching every video since so happy for you all and thank you for what you do the videos are never dull
Hell yeah brother!
Now he has something to cover his huge white canvas hauler!
Congrats good move guys !!!!!
Hell yeah
Sweet! Now, get into the diesel game! Need some McFarland Fab on my rig
Day #25 asking for a random subscriber to be picked to race in the Freedom500!
I didn't see that coming but that's  awesome . Congratulations Garrett  and James  on becoming a part of Motion Raceworks .
What happens with the aluminum waste? Does it get recycled?
6:00 no offense but this person and the way he moved kept reminding me of someone then it hit me. Seth Rogen!
Let's take a moment to appreciate James reppin the dead set LEGENDS at Clapd Out 😍  #YCSYPIYN
Dang coop really left before all the good stuff, bummer.
Do they have parts for hemi as well
You can only keep going up from here lets go brother let them damn bald eagles screech 🦅🦅🦅
American made.
Where are those cncs made?
Well hot damn
super stoked for you guys! but please dont show to much of this kinda thing
Whooooooooooooooeeeeeeee
Wow, don’t just take the money and play! You wisely are investing in your and James family. This is why I watch you. I’m proud to say I watch! Keep it up brother!
Very cool that you guys can have your logo on your vehicle's parts but . . . why would I want your name on my car?
Congratulations. Lucky those parts were labeled.
Burnout started like Cleetuskhana
This is some freakin awesome news! I am so pumped for yall!
Good for you. Awesome opportunity. Really taking things to the next level, which you always seem to do...Nice to see stuff being made in America again. Good luck 🍀👍🏻
it’s crazy to see this channel grow and cleetus becomin who he is. pretty awesome
Great video and congrats on the investment in motion raceworks just another addition to your empire....next stop a foundry/steel works so they can have there own brand of forged ali blocks etc and maybe some shares in HASS. Keep up the hard work and this is good motivation for us who struggle day to day to not give up
congrats guys, great move
Who’s D’avis????
Now that big sticker covering 20% of Mullet makes sense! - Best wishes for a successful partnership 😂
I like where this is going..
I'm now a member. Don't ever waver my American brother. Stay real
I am so stoked about this! I am a Service tech for the Haas CNC machines they had, would love to make it into that shop one day!!!! Much love for the Cleetus crew!!!!!! Can't wait to see what the future holds for you guys!!!!
Congrats in the acquisition! So awesome to see. Now waiting on the 20% buyout of Texas Speed!
If someone only knew how much that 5 axis machine cost to motion race works.
He gives me big Brad Leone vibes in this video
Nice merger of both. The guys will be a great pair. They will be able to stress test it all
Atlest James does know what a uggaduggah  measurement device looks like now lol
Headline Next Month: Cleetus purchases 25% of Texas Speed
I wonder if Cleeters going public on the NYSE soon, Im in.
Ole Cleet should have autographed that parts box. Just a simple "Packaged by Cleetus" or similar would have been epic. :D
I friggin love you Cleeter! This is such a great moment, I'm glad you are sharing it with all of us and the motorsports community as a whole, I think I shed a tear watching this. Keep up the hard work and great videos and as always, HELL YEAH BROTHER!
Cleetus and AdamLz.  Two Motorsport giants in the making as well as brilliant entrepreneurs.
From one entrepreneur to another, Kudos!!
Impressive move brother.....Should take some pressure off the R&D Budget at Freedom Factory!
Need to buy a portion of Goodyear Eagles, so at the end of a burnout you got some "Bald Eagles"
I don't know your situation with Cooper but if y'all are still friends, please sponsor him
GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!! FUCK YEAH BOYS!
Those dogs skinny , y’all needs to feed them
Damn I should’ve seen this coming
Awesome announcement and development for you guys., I’m looking forward to mid west drag week El Camino victory
Freedom one set to get freedom factory, motion raceworks, mountain dew and cleetus wrap. Rollin down the interstates promoting his wares. Everyone would know who it is. Great things come to those who work. Love the moves, always great to watch.
Woooooooooooooooooooo all the way from northern Canada. You all deserve this Big Timmeee!
If only motion raceworks built parts for mopar...
This is Amazing! Congrats guys!
Barra and Rb parts needed for supply in Australia 👌👌
Makes me miss my Duece , 16 year old boxer twin we had as our first family dog , they’re amazing pups man, definitely must of been the swing vote on letting Cleeter haha , Congratulations, I’m sure Motion is stoked Having you bring the hype
Ol cleetus got to spend a day with Seth Rogan’s little brother big steps keep it up
When sumptin breaks...im calling yall!
Yes! Was guessing this was happening
I was gonna go with Texas Speed
It's a great day when you can take a walk through your own race parts fabrication warehouse! Congrats!!
Good for you man! Smart investment!
When will he tell the world his big announcement that he's bisexuality .
The broad worm fortuitously tow because oboe computationally scare through a aberrant bite. periodic, brash baker
THIS IS AWESOME! Im looking at building a new project car, something odd, planning to make it a drag week competitor as that has been a goal of mine for going on a decade. Motion is going to be getting a lot of emails from me in the near future. Now I feel even better about giving them my money........ idk if its a good thing, but I think it is lol
GREATEST NEWS EVER! CONGRATS GUYS!
Congratulations guys! I love to see you investing in the future.
Dewitt!?!?!?!!?!?!? Thats 20 minutes from me! No way!!!!
So, do they re-smelter all the shavings so they use most everything?
Freedom Factory purchase was the biggest move
Congrats!
Smart people make smart and risky decisions.... and it has paid off. Congrats gents!
Making money moves for real
Congrats guys, but what happens? if the EPA screw you over?
I haven't joined yet but now my American brother I am.
That is not the news I was expecting but that’s freakin AWESOME!! They seem like a pretty good group of guys and I think you made a great choice for business partners. Your welding skills are next level too Cleetus! Lmao that clip was hilarious. Great video!!
Yessss let's go!
Wish you the best  It’s gonna be the best or worst move you ever made. God bless
That intro gave mad tegridy farm vibes
I’m so excited for you guys this is amazing, hell yea brother McFarland fab becoming reality.
Freedom Raceworks
Those blue anodized freedom parts are lookin pretty sleek 👀
Congratulation!! I had no clue motion race works was only 20 minutes away from where I live lol I figured they were a company from somewhere in Florida
Congrats man
Look at those burn out marks he just barley missed those parked cars lol
God Bless America! You boys just keep makin me proud!!
Hell yea!!!!! I couldn't help but notice there is a "HAAS" name on that machine. Does MOTIONRACEWORKS & CLEETUS have a soon to be announced F1 contract? That would be sick!!!!!
So glad for your guys progress! One note. On those parachute handles maybe in a version 2 flip the hell yeah brother over because most of those handles are mounted hanging from the roof and the words will be upside down.
And in other news, Cleetus McFarland has been nominated as the presidential candidate for the "Hell yeah brother party".
cool
13:06 😂
Is this today's video?
Wait!  Everyone disappeared into a cloud of smoke!  Was that supposed to happen?
Congratulations guys yal deserve it. Honestly yal are one of the only reasons I even watch youtube
well I know where I'm getting my car parts now
Never thought I'd see a slick 90° machined ........ Das nice
Can’t breathe. Too awesome.
Cleetus where can I get the exact same hat you are wearing? I really like it and can't find it anywhere on your merch.
Next week on Sharktank....
Ole Cleet is smart. He is investing in his future. I could tell by the FF that he was doing something long term that will keep him going in this world. very smart. take notes. this is how you build an empire and invest in the future.
I see your dislike list keeps getting bigger with each video....wants going on...?
Walking around like you own the joint lol
I'm so happy for yall. I've been watching yall for years and this brought freedom tears to my eyes 💯💯 keep up the great and amazing work!!
“I’m not a businessman, I’m a business, man.” -Cleetur McSkeetur, probably
Sell out with me....
From the thumbnail I thought you signing a contract with street outlaws
You guys should do some sort of giveaway, Where every racetrack you go to, You pick someone out that is wearing Motion Raceworks Merch, or something along those lines & give them something cool. That will help the Merch sales take off for sure... Congrats fellas! Happy For you all...
Congrats guys
HELL YEAH BROTHER.... CONGRATULATIONS BRO. You have worked hard for this. YOU deserve it.
when James reached into that aluminum chip bin, i let out a gasp. if you work in a machine shop, you know that's a horrible idea. 🤣
I mean, this is epic - but I'm a little dissapointed that the news wasn't "Kevin is joining the channel fulltime".
So motion parts with cleetus logo basically  lol aight
Not gunna lie though.   Military hovercraft would have been pretty freakin sweet too.    Congrats guys!
Woot! You came a long way cleetus, still remember that video of you riding that lsx jeep, congrat mah man
I almost cried!   okay I did...   Hell Yeah Brother!!!
Congrats brother, seeing from where it started to where you guys are at is Murica asf.. 🦅🦅🦅
Felt myself tear up. So happy for you and the motion raceworks family. Love yall, keep kicking ass brother
I get more of a team feeling watching the videos over the past 2 years, is this really the Cleetus McFarland channel or the McFarland Racing channel. Rebrand would be super cool or another channel
#merica
Cleetus eyes look dodgy when back in Florida.
Are we gonna see any love for the Mopar Crew?
I think motion raceoworks are the real winners in the deal. Tons more exposure and all they gotta do is slap his logo on their parts 🤷‍♂️
Dang I was really hoping you and Maddie were having a little future racer after James doing that gender reveal can't remember whose channel that was on and then you said you were having a big announcement that was going to change a lot of stuff
Man, when I guessed you bought a shop, i wasn't expecting a cnc machine shop!!! Btw Lucas is a damn legend with a hard stare and "cant cut these hands" 😂🤘
Sheeew! Firts of All, you dudes rock My world on the scene of YouTube!  Second of all,  James  and Gerret you just keep on hammering! Maaan i love what you are doing.  Bedst wishes from Bornholm.  A small Island in Great  Denmark ❤
Congratulations on your investment/ Accusation but the whole Cleater vibe makes you look like a tool. I know it's how you roll and what started your channel but I felt like  I was watching a flex-seal infomercial with the old Cleater at the wheel. If I owned Motion Raceworks and had millions of dollars just tied up in Haas equipment I would want everyone including you to be a bit more serious about the products being machined. Your the man I love your channel...ya just got to stay in your lane sometimes brother.
Congratulations to you guys for taking all the steps you keep taking!!
**MUCH BETTER INVESTMENT THAN A DUNE BUGGY OR A MINI JET BOAT!!!** **WTG JAMES & GARRETT = SUPER COMPANY = MOTION RACEWORKS!!!**
congrats guy such an epic move for the channel keen to see more
Congratulations Guys!!!! Simply Amazing!!!! All from putting whistles in an exhaust pipe!!!!!!
These guys are making investment after investment. Regardless if they are good investments they are all very long term.  Buy motion while the "stock" is high Freedom factory. So expensive that it will take forever to make the money back Regardless how many people watch. But they will make it back. Then there are the cars and whatever whatever whatever.  All of these investments will play out well but they add up
What's the best engine to build entirely from McFarland Fabrication?
You know you are too emotionally invested in a Youtube channel when....I didn't even want to click on this video. All the comments yesterday about Motortrend had me worried. I clicked and quickly scrolled down so I could see the Like/Dislikes and was happy to see 50k likes to a few hundred dislikes, my stomach immediately settled, my fellow Freedom Followers let me know it was going to be just fine. Congrats on the new venture, hopefully it finds as much success as the channel has.
He said, "we can "rethread" those".... Oh man i cringed for a second haha.
Congratulations Cleetus and James Keep picking winners
In racing every day is "Training Day"!!
*cleetus buys 1/5 of motion raceworks*  "No more breaks guys"  Employees= 0_0
I WAS RIGHT HE GOT AN LCAC
So motion has a product already and cleetus puts a flag on ?🤯 makes no sense
Next up, Cleetus investment will introduce laser sintered additive material parts, instead of turning an 18 pound piece of aluminum to 0.9 pounds, 0.9 pounds of powder to 0.9 of product...guaranteed.
I was so worried you signed up for a tv deal. Good choice.
Horay that he didn't do a motor trend
10:13 you know the machinist had an heart attack lmao
The nutritious disease ideally remove because semicolon potentially guarantee of a legal keyboarding. modern, psychotic input
Hell Yeah Brother!!! CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU BOTH👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💪🏼🔥
Crazy, i remember how i clicked on that exhaust whistle corvette video on my yt start page, began to love your channel, then leroy, ruby, freedom factory, drift stuff, first ppv, the big racecar drivers at the events, the hovercrafts, mudtrucks and now mullet is finished and you own 20% of motion raceworks....CRAZY! Love your content, the freedom and your positive mindset no matter what❤️
Make Honda shit
Cleetus it would be awesome for those valve covers to come in more colors. Some red ones would look awesome with either your logo white or black. I’d definitely put a set on my C6z!
Shocker when all there stickers started showing up on there cars
I was worried, but now I'm proud of you......
I wouldn't have accepted anyone but Motion. I'm really glad you didn't sell out.
Congrats to you guys on the new ownership and partnership.   Best of luck in the future
Boxer dogs in the warehouse yea I trust this company
So does Cleetus have a camera man/editor now? He told the camera man to blur out that part, so just wondering lol.
Hater pipes were clapping he didn’t need no applause
DUDE that's freaking sweet! about time you started making your own parts!
Super cool Cleet and Jackstand!  Guess it makes sense why in the previous video he noted he was just representing on the elco, no pay for the giant MR sticker on the side... I wondered why he hesitated to respond to the question about it
That's a frigging  smoke show rite there 🤘
Welcome to Iowa boys!
That’s huge congratulations to you guys!!!!!
Sbf stuff?
So does that mean a possibly cleetus and cars in IA? Or mn? (8
Let’s go congratulations
About time you teamed up with a solid company and got some custom parts sold. Sounds like a great business move for you guys and customers. Id pay extra just for a murican flag, eagles and a cleetus logo on em.
Outstanding!!!
Congratulations on the new venture guys.👏👏
So that's why the texas speed american flag valve covers came off.
M.A precision, U.K,  for all your race part needs, le man, moto gp, race winners
Welcome to the machining world Cleetus! This and design have been my world for 45 years! Congrats on your partnership! Love your channel!
What’s the part # on the dogo. I looked all over the web site and I can’t find it lmao . Con grats to Doug you and Garrett . Glad to see good people coming together to make things bigger
Half a mil in 6 hours. Lets gooo       *Made in the usa
as a union machinist & aerospace worker... 12:48 is far too often the truth
Yep!
Better redo that sticker on the elcamino. Got to represent even harder now, lol. No bubbles!
Motion and Cleetus!  I extremely impressed.  But I now TOTALLY understand the Motion sticker on the ELCO!
H U G E !
Bring me one of those turbskis when you come to Idaho and ill take you to catch a 7' sturgeon. Ha
Congratulations guys! From Canada.. Freakin' Awesome!
Shocker more great stuff for cleatus 🤮
Damn dude, congrats.
So when does the Jackstand Jimmy branded nitrous stuff come out?
Holley
Common vf2, vf4 are great but the 5x is a monster. The hardest part is the setup  if you have to change things. Im sure they run the part day after day is ease to do an adjustment!  Great work and HAASE  makes great machines
Jackstand rocking the double sunglasses
I am disappointed that Cleetus was not blasted in the face with nitrous from James during this ENTIRE merch drop.......
I need some McFarland Racing billet shift knobs
Cleeter is a real deal businessman. Whoever is in his corner helping with investments is A1. Congrats to you guys!
Congratulations guys! You’ve come such a long way. You guys help keep people dreams alive
"Can we get a video of James just squirting shit" LMFAO
CONGRATS 🇺🇸
Who are the 518 anti American freedom haters who disliked this video?
This is probably my favourite YouTube channel at this point. I'm so happy for you guys with this big move. Although, I hope that not every video is essentially a 30 min advertisement 😅. "We'll be talking about this alot more in future" (MRW website), had me a bit worried.
God Bless America!!! Congrats Gentleman.
Makes me wanna buy an LS🦅🦅🦅🦅
Why Raceworks starving that one dog. I see his ribs! Lol 😂🤣 They working them dogs too hard!
I use a wire nut to hold my air cleaner on. Do you guys have them in chrome? All I can find is the red or yellow plastic ones.
That blue color is awesome
Anrky wheels are made by HRE
Congrats guys!  Sounds like a great decision.  Access to lots of custom manufacturing and great promotion for their products. Everyone shares in the profits. Win-Win.
Congratulations you have come so far amazing all the years watching you thank you for all the content and amazing things you do
This is a huge deal.  Congrats guys.  All I can think of at this moment has to be sung in a LilJon voice “Parts! Parts! Parts! Parts! Parts! Parts! Everybody!”
You are criminally under subscribed for the huge moves you make. Huge congrats on the buy!
Yup bet Cooper wishes he was still part of the all star team
Theres definitely gonna be movies made about cleetus someday
nice to see youtubers buy in rather then sell out
Not that I wouldn't have shopped at MRW before... but I have no choice now but to go spend all my money there in celebration of this move. And cause racecur
Absolutely Awsome Lads, congratulations superb. I honestly am Chuffed for you Lads I love it when good people have good things and lots of Love in their lives.
32:32 long ass commercial! ✌😎🏴‍☠️
Liquid nitrogen cooled inter cooler please and thank you
I really enjoy how far this channel has come over the past three years like Leroy  going from a ten second car to a mid seven car to the freedom factory and now this. I went to my first Cletus and Cars last year with my father in law which was fantastic!  Y’all have come a long way and have always been for the viewer. Can’t wait to see Leroy ripping again
Hell yes brother!!!! Makes me genuinely happy man.
Garrett, I have to say that even though we have never met but I have to say that I am super impressed and super proud of you all. I live here in FL and I really need to make it a point to come visit. What you have done is nothing short of amazing. I cannot wait to see what the future brings.
Congrats guys, great move!
HELL YA BROTHER!!
16:12 they got hoes.
I’m so glad he did this. James and him are absolutely the perfect people to be putting that money forth to have that stake in the company. He and James have never been shady or not upfront. I just really hope that if a product they promote has a known issue they will be open about it and acknowledge the given issue. I am confident that they will stay humble and do right by us fans and the customers who choose to spend there money at motion raceworks. Perfect guys for the job I’d say
That just took the do it for Dale saying to new heights. You invest into the automotive culture... Truly doing it for Dale and America 🦅🤘
It works both ways too great investment clet.
Wow!! Congratulations Cleeter!!! Glad to see someone taking full advantage of the American Dream!!  YouTubers all across YouTube should pay attention and try to emulate just how far you've taken your YouTube channel in such a short amount of time. Seems like just yesterday you guys were testing electric turbskis, novelty items and As Seen On TV junk just for laughs.  Who has seen the videos of teenage Cleeter running his RC boat in the pond and trying to go faster???  Now look at what this has turned in to!!! I do want to see you guys revisit that electric turbo that actually worked and see how far y'all can take it!
From Australia Cleetus "Aussie as f**k" McFarland.
Made in the USA as well as made in Iowa!
The Bald rEagle sounded awesome!
I absolutely f*cking love the passion you and the team put into everything you do and it has always paid off. I know this will be no different.
Nice move boys Congrats! And that 20% share cash influx should just about cover Motions insurance policy premium increase after they see the burnout in the parking lot.  😁
you just need money and us
who else kept hearing, YEEEEEEEEE HAWWWWWWW when that machine went off after cleet did that haha, no doubt the boys there will be hearing cleet in their head yee hawing for a while lol
Motion race works should make race gun parts haha
Heaven nah sister
We need Crown Vic parts 😂😂😂
My friends grandpa started his company in his garage making engine blocks and heads and just sold it a few years ago maybe you heard of it? Dart Machinery
Am I the only one that said America and MURICA out loud watching this
Best company ever for having boxers in the shipping department. You know things is legit
Next Level is Cleetus buying into a Nascar team🧐😮 Or making his own? Who knows
90 deg elbow machined from billet? Expensive and no better than a cast  and machine finished one. Is it me or have so many lost the plot?
Okay new product idea ..... Mt. Dew© ONLY drink holders
Wow that burn out had so many bald eagles I couldn't even see. Congrats you freaking lations on buying 20% of motion race works car parts that is so awesome. I am so happy for you guys. Keeping the manufacturing process in the United States of freaking America let's go! This channel is so awesome you guys seem like some of the best guys and girls on this planet.

Congratulations gentlemen! Well done!
Congratulations! All the hard work paid off.
Congrats on your success. It's been awesome watching you guys have fun and enjoying what you do.

WOW.... a 32 minute ad.
Not even my company and I’m excited for you to join the team lmfao
You should buy Milan dragway
Could someone that works in a machine shop tell me what is done with the shavings ans scraps from the aluminum that is shaved away? Is it just scrapped and throw away?
we need a 2-3 hour video, I could watch parts being made all day
Congratulations. It great to see people get to do what they love
I like it Cleetus is even cussing more I love it!
Can't wait for the off-center 'Ruby' edition steering wheel. 🤣
Awesome guys,  ill definitely shop here when I get a new car to play with 🤙👍🍻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Ngl you have enough stuff to be doing! No need to be making parts it’s going to ruin the channel if all we see is car parts being made
Well dang at first i thought ol cleet baught a machine shop to make his own parts and i was like shooot.  But even better partnered with the best.  Great job cleet
cant wait to buy a Cleetus VALLEY COVER BOYZ!
I hope you bought 20% because VGG. Is buying another 20 and it will be a 5 owner company.
You HAVE to make James branded billet and anodized jack stands!
1:01 Lmaooo
Freakin Cleetus was in Iowa and I didn't get a chance to meet him, Crap dude!!
Do they have a motor plate for a 60s 331 Desoto Hemi  to Power glide 🤷‍♂️🤔 Bet they dont with that old-style bellhousing on the motor.  Actually it would be a adapter plate, cause u need a clutch flywheel to mount converter to then the glide
Oh man sounds good just can't wait to see who's ego gets bigger and conflicts the relationship AKA I'm the leader of the band
About time hahah!!
Well done guys good idea make the most of it you all are a great bunch of chaps keep up the great content 👍
Bringing Freedom back, one burnout at a time!!!
I honestly thought he was gonna get sponsored by mountaindew and they were gonna build a funnycar for ol Cleetus
You guys doing valve covers for the Gen V LT?
Need a chip pucker
Hell yeah, I’ve watched since the beginning. So happy to see y’all branching out to sustain the channel and your lifestyle
"Oh God my box looks horrible"...... keep it PG mate
So proud that you've grown I've been watching since young
Congratulations guys
You guys are such an inspiration. #Merica
Hell Yeah Brother!! That's awesome news, keep up the grind
That’s awesome bro.
So much freedom in the air!
That's a good move!
F#@! YEAH CLEETER AND JIMMY!! Im proud to say I have watched from the beginning and Its fantastic that you're moving along so greatly... Hell yeah brother, I can't wait to buy some parts!
Someone needs to add a J to those Ames carts so James owns all the carts
haven't been broke in a minute
So motion doesn't carry any mopar stuff?
Hell yah dude, this is awesome  I now know why the motion race works sticker on the elco is so big😂😂
hell yeah👍🏼
Would love to see some Mustang EcoBoost parts from Motion.  I know it’s a Ford and a 4 cylinder at that, but the platform has a pretty large following.
I'm a Iowan resident and couldn't be any happier to hear this news!! I love watching how you guys are changing up the automotive world theses days! Congrats on the next chapter!
McFarland Private Equity now? Hell yeah, this is a huge leap!
"We are all in"  "We went in 100%!"...                            Well...                  at least 20%.
IOWA.  where the coolest stuff really happens.
Well,,,that's ONE WAY to get a 20% discount on all your purchases from a great company.  Glad it's happening though and especially glad James is part of it all. Much better having James as a partner than as an employee.
James part owner too? He deserves it for sure!
Poor Motion Raceworks, gonna have a whole lot of Cleetus to be dealing with now lol
Congratulations
“Cleetus” is one of the most impressive young entrepreneurs in the US today. He’s at a whole different level among you tubers doing automotive content. The next step is for “McFarland Enterprises” to go public on NASDAQ
Watched it for a min hell yeah brother I hope to get some soon
Cool Beans.
I can I get some wit out cleettus name
Jackstand needs to have his own logo on some of those parts
Will never understand why you call it month of freedom in May
Needed a Drone for that Burnout..  cmon man step up the videoography eh
If the motion race works dogs are running the show maybe you should send up Holley as  the 20%
Hell yea congratulations
Hell yeah brother, that's awesome, huge congrats on the wise business move Cleetus and James
I would ABSOLUTELY buy your products. But there's no way in hell I'd want the word "Cleetus" on my parts.  I don't know why.  I can't explain it.  But, I just don't want that.
Hey is there anyway you guys could do some Mopar stuff. Old school LA small block and RB big block stuff. Hell even new Mopar stuff. Not trash talking in anyway. I have old school Mopar car/trucks. Kinda limited on what I could buy from y’all. Just an idea not complaining. Everything looks to be of great quality on the website. Good luck on your new adventure.
Such a big fire me up. Cant like this enough!! Good luck, from Australia 🤙🤙
Licensing! Where the real money of the movie is made!
I'm that friend that puts annoying shit in my friends pockets.
Congratulations Cleetus and James. You two have definitely taken it to the next level.  Now I know why you have "MotionRaceWorks" on the sides of Mullet. I am really happy for the both of you. It's a great company and now it's even better.
"Can we get a video of James just, squirting shit?" Lol
It would be amazing if you could use Toast as a model to build parts off of for us.  I have a 3rd generation Camaro that has gone from a 2.8 to a 5.7 and finding conversion parts for aftermarket stuff was an adventure to say the lest.
Hope it works out
Watching this with a broke rib 1:01 had me howling laughter and pain at the same time! Thanks!
You should make a discount code
That’s awesome! Congratulations!
Man this move is really gonna put you in motion.         Lol
Awesome , happy for you guys , Thanks CM & Friends
AlSO, Nice Haas Machinery that shop has. I know they have a Formula 1 Team. Could we possibly see Cleetus in a F1 car? Or maybe even becoming apart of Haas???? The Sky is the Limit my friend, Congrats again.
This is 1320 Video's fault     and I love it!
Congratulation. I wish you all the best for the future, from Jan in Norway
Been machining with a passion for 11 years.  Nice to see some related content.
Congratulations boys securing the future
Well done Lad 👏 I'm happy For yous 👌🤙💯🇮🇪☘ Hell yeah Brother 🤙💯💙💚💙💚
Dude Cleetus is taking over
I thought he was going to say he got someone that new how to build a engine.peace
I’ve been with you since the good ole days. It’s amazing to see this! I’ll see ya in Houston!
King of burnouts right here folks
Cleetus James, slowly step away from the machinery before you get hurt, move towards the marketing and promotions department. They didn't let you guys in for your machining skills. Your pretty faces, public relation and driving skills along with your stable of race cars and other go fast toys is what will help Motion grow! Congratulations to yourself James  and Motion for partnering up, I wish you all nothing but success !!
Hell Yeah Brother! Good to see Good People getting together. 🦅🇺🇸🦅
Hey Cleetus I looked on their website and I didnt see job listings. I just graduated from tech school in mechatronics, which is industrial maintenance specializing in manufacturing equipment and robotics. I was wondering if they had any maintenance positions open
As a 30 year old man and having been here since right around the beginning of Leroy I'm absolutely unashamed to say this got me a little teary eyed and idk why, it's not the first time either, Leroy hitting that 7 for the first time got me as well, you guys are a testament to the American dream, ain't dead yet mfers! From salvage titles to 7 second quarter miles, From nothing to something! God bless you boys, God bless America and do it for dale brother.
This is extremely exciting to see one of my favorite YouTuber building y'all brand and partnering with such a high quality company I can't wait till I'm in the position to start buy parts from motion raceworks and using y'all's parts
Yesssssssssssssasss yeeeeeeeesssssssssss fucking hell yea brother!!!! This is bad ass!
Awesome
Congrats Cleet! I'm excited to see the next five years for Cleet and his Fleet. Nice job guys, way to invest the money for all the right reasons!
Go ahead and go public so I can buy up all the shares and go to the moon.
From exhaust whistles to a race track and a performance company.
Motion need some Cletus branded billet 10mm sockets.
I’m sure u won’t see this and I no it doesn’t mean anything but I’m sincerely proud of you
the intro gave me shivers
Garrett and James are natural pitch men.... congrats on your venture.  Now, sell me a racecar to go with those valve covers!
Congrats!!  You seem a bit excited about the partnership!!:P  You had a smile for most of the video!  Good luck!!
Motion Raceworks Exec:  “Yes we’re going to sell 20% of the company to a guy that used to do fidget spinner and whistle in the exhaust videos on YouTube - but he’s a Florida-man so it’s all good.”  Deal done.
congrats! i thought you guys bought the drag strip though.
Mate....that burnout was proper! Ozzy style! 🇦🇺
Good luck brothers
This guy is nonstop! It's fucking amazing someone can go so hard and has his hands in so much stuff.Trust me I run a crew of guys and take care of a bunch of customers and it's draining so I can imagine his workload and stress
Should have signed the box with a little thank you.
Iv been waiting for this to happen!!
Hell yeah brother! Good for 6ou Cleetand James. Dude put in work delivering this much quality content
Amazing to think I've been here since he was pitting turbo whistles in his exhaust, and now he's doing it big. This is just so awesome.
Wow, the amount of debt Garrett is taking on is giving me anxiety ...  No pain no gain brother!
Congratulations
How can I press the like button 67 times!!?!?
Man I'm so glad you didn't buy a Tesla
Motion needs to start dipping their toes Into the Barra world, with Barra's becoming popular in the states its basically an untapped resource at the moment 🤷‍♂️
"Head machinist" everyone knows that's Seth Rogen
I heard about Motion Raceworks through this channel and have purchased from them several times. Once the product got damaged during shipping and with a 2 minute phone call it was all solved. They sent me a new one. Their stuff has amazing quality hands down.
ALL THESE FOOLS THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO MOTORTREND CHANNEL. DONT WORRY THEY AINT RICH ENOUGH
Prediction:  A battle by Sentinel Capital Partners and Industrial Opportunity Partners to buy Motion Raceworks and maybe even a piece of FF/McFarlands operations.   The Clients, Followers, Fans and future growth and income potential CANNOT be purchased any other way.  No company can organically grow this type of business model. I feel the wheels turning and people crunching numbers out there right now. In fact, I bet someone has already made the phone calls and and invites into the big boys club.
All right Cletus is invested everybody subscribe to the motion race works channel as well
Please start making crown Vic parts! First on the list is the piece that goes in the stock rear air bags to run your own air line.
those headers on the cutty are sick lol
Now maybe you can make a decent turbo key chain lol jk This is a MASSIVE fire me UP!!
buying into motion raceworks kind of tips cleets hand on how much money he really has. :P
Hellll yeah brothers!!!!
Mmmm That would really go well with Turbosmart blue...
2:06 :)
I was thinking one red valve cover a white intake and the other valve cover blue
Cleetus moving up in the world. And Boostedboiz hit 1mil subs...  Good week...  👍
Congrats this is awesome always raising the bar.
Badass!
You guys are absolutely killing it.
Super cool.. and how the rich get richer.. takes money to make money.. yup im jealous
Love it!
🥲
I don’t need any parts right now but I’m buying a shirt just to support the new partnership!  This is going to be great!
I love the bald regal. More cars need 8 tractor flappers.
It’s a brave route with the EPA wanting to completely eliminate the modifying of vehicles which is WHY WE HAVE TO FIGHT THIS ANTI-ENGINE MODIFYING epa bull! It’s BULL SHIT and something we as Americans who LOVE FREEDOM ,...which includes the freedom to MODIFY our cars for fun and profession. Fight this BS and let’s all support the opportunity to modify our vehicles and for companies the modify cars or provide parts to exist.
infomercial come on  Cleet.
i was thinking if you did open a store you could have some employees to help with people not having jobs
Congrats.
I live just down the road from them!
Next year: We purchased 20% of Texas speed
Where's all the haters giving him PRE father advice or the ones saying that they were going to leave because he was going to Motor trend
are you going to open a parts store near you or at the track
You guys own 20% of motion raceworks?
Does motion stock H1 axles? Lol
Anyone else notice the Haas lathe? From F1 to mass production car parts
So stoked. James seems to have been the catalyst for Cleetus to start making leaps and exponential growth.
EUGE Moves! Congrats guys!
Thats a big fire me up!  Congrats boys.  Love the boxer shop dogs  i have one also.  Keep it up team 👍
Wow.... that’s all I can say. This is beyond of anything I thought. Congrats man, truly awesome to see!
Cleetus is quite possibly the best salesman I have ever encountered.
Should have bought the drag strip to many partners not good
Umm... gonna need you guys to get some GEN 3 Coyote parts...
Happy for ya brother. Just don’t make this channel a tool to sell your new brand. Congrats on the new business venture. You guys rock
God bless America!;)
GJ boys couldnt be happier for you even if im hella jealous. Need someone to sweep the shops?
When will Motion Raceworks jet boat parts be available?
I think you need to stick with what you know and do best (Not manufacturing or assembly) stick with testing.  It’s much more fun too.
When the first comment you see spoils the video
Ive asked on 20+ videos in the comment section. Wtf happened to copper?
Made in the good ole USA. Murica. good stuff
What happened to Cooper? Seems to have dropped off the face of the channel?
When's IPO? 😁
I was realy scared he signed for discovery or something. oof
I definitely want some jackstand jimmy tools
I wish I needed a cleetus parachute handle
The parachute handles definitely need to say "slow down brother"
7:03 wat da fokk
Well, not what I was expecting, but I see where the doubt is coming from. Best of luck brother, here's to hoping the best, and also hoping  the powers that be don't ruin the industry. Probably should link that petition to congress in EVERY video from now on till the legislation is dead.
Turn those eagles loose!
So cool! Well done to you all.
I had a sweet faun-with-a-black-mask Boxer for 15 years. He was my best friend. Every time I see some Boxer babies it reminds me of him, and what perfect dogs they are.
This is awesome but wow way out from what I was thinking lol but hell yeah brother congrats
Hey Cleet are you gonna have a hand in the design and development of these parts?
Too bad coop missed this chance of a life time
thank god its not a baby.....
Every burnout should have an aftermath bit so we can see the carnage!!! I wanna see how dark them peels are and the wheels after and how hot the engine is!! COME ON CLEET!
Congratulations!
Biden says "GO GREEN" LOL
I’m so excited about this! This is fucking awesome 😎❤️ Hell yeah brother!
Congratulations guys !! That's so freaking Awesome . I wish you guys nothing but the best in your new venture .
CONGRATS
Cooper is like dam why did i leave
I’m so excited
Damn cleet you know how to make 11’s!
8:35 "Can we just get a video of James squirting shit?" 😂
The CNC guy is a redhead Seth Rogan
Congrats man!
I love how the auto captions labeled the burnout in the beginning as Music 👌🤣
Am I the only one who thinks that it sucks that there making those poor dogs work so many hours 😪 😕 😔
That's sick & the fact the shop is dog friendly.... That's a match made in heaven! Congrats boys!!
you can tell they are having so much fun lol
And then ol cooper is sitting by watching the all these opportunities he passed up lol
Looking to the future, and Great Venture for you all!!!
I prefer Doosan.
What if you did custom designs on some items? Like design your own valve cover
Now that you have an unlimited supply to parts we want a coyote build
Nice work cleeter 🤙🏼
from now on i will only buy motion raceworks parts welded by cleetus.
This is awesome congrats on the big move
I need some duramax parts on that site before I can support you.  A billet y-bridge that replaces the stock would be a plus.
Spark plug wire holders made from scratch something that can last longer.
Holy cow that's a big step in the right direction. Best burnout I've ever seen frick yeah
This wont live if you don't.you can just make so many vids. Go for it.
good luck guys!
now you have to worry about the RPM ACT. and the democrats. good luck
This is like a 30 minute commercial 😂
Congrats! Happy for you both!
Congrats guys ! Best of luck with your new business !
They make anything for 2010 wrx?
"I got this"... lol
every month is month of freedom at this point.
I just made a big move today, let's go brother!!
Isn't it a risky time for automotive aftermarket with EPA's bullshit?
shoulda labeled the parachute as "too much sauce"
Sign me up for some billet jack stands brother   Big moves! Now let’s get some Mullet content!
Parachute pull should say "hell whoa brother"
This is the beginning of leroys new quest to be a 6 second stick car!
Literally is just monopolizing on viewers to make money off of the people that watch these videos
Low key was hoping for another abandoned track but this will do
Wonder why there’s no adds? Is it because Cleeter said “shit” 3 times? I know ol YT is getting pretty heavy on the feelings these days.
Man you Garrett and James all of you really good guys
Seeing all this HAAS CNC machines makes me think of the HAAS F1 team and how I'd like to see them see some success in the 2022 season.
Do they ship to Australia? I'll take a Cleeter 6 speed shifter knob please.
The new business is a long time comin'.   Fantastic joy...ha
Does motion motor sports make a set of 1”3/4” or 1”7/8” tube style headers that will fit a 1969 Chevy 1Ton 4x4 with a manual tranny running a hydraulic clutch set up that won’t hit the leaf spring hangers and that have a decent amount of room for the plug wires?? I’ve ordered two different sets of headers from hockey headers and neither one will fit!! I’ve built a 700hp 421 sbc with the dart block and the AFR aluminum heads with the angled plugs!! If anyone can help a guy out that would be greatly appreciated??????
Sell out!! Just to get a 50% discount on parts
jegs, summit, and now motion race cleeter
Pure 'Murican capitalism...  I love it.
That's freaking awesome!!!! I've always loved motion raceworks and their products. I'm starting a 3rd gen camaro ls build so I'm eyeing parts already
Cleetus IV been following the channel since the good ol days I know you hear this alot. But brother....I'm so proud of you bro 🤘 your are kicking butt and taking names brother always making big moves and always grinding man! SO PROUD BROTHER 🤘💪
So will there be a motion/cleetus commemorative t shirt? This is monumentive.
Sick can't wait to see this pay out
Purchasing me a set of ls freeze plug brackets 💪🏽 https://www.motionraceworks.com/products/motion-raceworks-ls1-frost-plug-brackets-set-of-4
I’d love to see a weld on throttle body plate so we can adapt other intakes to an ls throttle body.
Holy blond hair cleetus. Went from dark one second to bright blond wasnt expecting that lol. Congrats to both of you guys for the huge life changing move. You both deserve it and I cant wait to see what you come up with next. I thought freedom factory was huge now this. You do some amazing things.
Awesome Move!
You can see how much he respects the people that work there.
Hell yeah!
Motion Cleet-Works!
so worth the wait! congrats dude!
Oh boy Donnie’s getting a upgrade!!!!🎉
well, McFarland fab just graduated hahaha congrats man! awesome stuff!
Super congrats guys. You’ve come a long way since you were putting whistles on the C7. You guy deserve the best for all of your hard work. LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM. 👍😎👍
It's a good thing you and James jumped on this opportunity because Summit Racing was knocking on the door. Congrats!
Hell Ya Brother congrats on your new venture
Hell ya brother!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Congrats
How could you think anyone would be upset about this at least that's what I think Cletus said I think this is absolutely awesome if anybody deserves a shot in the arm and a boost and some help it's motion race works once again Cletus steps up to the plate swings and hits a home run
I just realized that motion raceworks is only like an hour from my house
Wow good news
i will always ponder who actually dislikes videos like this, one of the greatest moments of one of the greatest youtube channels of our time. i couldnt be happier of them, the only thing that would make this any better is if they were as close to us as it feels. congrats guys! look forward to the future (:
I want my truck to have a motor it just sits in my drive way
Iowa, oof…….. Y’all meet any meth addicts? That’s what I remember about Iowa. 😂
Anybody think of them movie Tommy Boy watching this video🤔🤣
So glad to see James in on this deal. I can’t wait to spend some of my money at Motion👍
Absolutely dope man!
Come on don't knock Ford you're all in it for the money we know neighbor was true and tested
Oh yeah this is a partnership made in heaven lol
That is awesome!! Congrats!!
Man I’ve seen all that new throttle body and the billet Y tube that they also make on a twin turbo LS. This shit is legit. Big $$$$.
You should build a high quality steering wheel knob that has a good method of holding it firmly onto the wheel.
need cleetus branded small block chevy parts... would bring my ol red white and blue race car right around.
Hell yea, brother!  This is amazing.  You're the definition of a great American.  Keep doing great things!
Frickin A! Awesome guys! Congratulations!!
getting too big for me bud
Now I understand Kevin’s how much you  pay for that/they pay you question on mullets sticker.  Congratulations on that solid investment in the Boiz
they should do a swivel 90 bend for the TB's like the swivel water necks you can get. congrats on the new venture mate!
War bird has been real quiet since that burnout!
Living the dream!
And here's what happens when you buy the "other guy's brake pads"
Murica Raceworks
Congrats! I wonder how james is involved in this deal and also in the Cleetus McFarland brand. Anyone kowledge about that?
This is legendary! Your guys rise is movie inspiring.
product idea for you. make an angle kit for the corvette, but its like the one you have on donnie, and under 1k dollars. sell them like hot cakes guarenteed.
Cleetus makin moves!
Hell Yeah Brother, so cool! Congrats guys, love you all....
Congrats bro!   Also seeing you wear a clip on mic had me talking to myself saying "Finally!"  lol
i just hope that one day hemi platforms will get some love
Don't hate on Ford lol neighbor doesn't let u down
"I make car parts for the American working man, because that's what I am, and that's who I care about."
LETS GO BOYS!!!!
Awesome bro.
it's time to RELEASE THE BALD EAGLES!!! Good luck on your new venture.
If possible pls make truck parts for the bog deepers🇺🇸
Come on Cleet!!! My mans COOKED you on the packaging!!! Lol but forreal congrats to you and ol Jackstand for the big move!!!
Congratulations you guys! My god, y'all are doing things! What's next to come? 😎 Awesome
Nice. Congrats, looking forward to the future content Parts in merch. CMYTC!
I thought that guy was sitting down next to Cleetus  lol
Literally doesn't matter what part it is, y'all will test it to its limit and that right there is why this is going to be epically successful.
Why aren’t the American flag hats available anymore
Good job guys.
You guys are king of breaking parts so you might as well make your own and if they survive you they should Last forever for normal gear heads. Congratulations on making your dreams happen and taking us along for the ride. 🤟
Should invest in a puck maker takes all them shavings and packs them into pucks saves space and increases scrap pay
Hell yes. 110% support from me
Congratulations Cleet, James, All Motion and crew!!! Absolutely stoked!!
who woulda thought a 30 minute merch plug would get so many likes hahaha... Congrats Cleet you're in the big leagues now.
Hell ya  I’m so proud to b a customer
Cleetus is amazing him welding and the piece of metal falls off. I laughed forever
I looked at the prices of the cleetus motion race works products and I was honestly surprised how reasonably priced it was. Especially made in America and made of billet aluminum. I will be purchasing soon
Congratulations,  has James got shares in the freedom factory and the Cleetus McFarland chanel as well as motion raceworks? He seems very invested in everything you do but don't want him up and walking to do his own thing anytime soon! I am tipping once Cooper left to do his own thing it would have been a bit of a shock to you cleetus but has turned out to be for the best which in my opinion he would be somewhat regretting!
You have to have a cleetus and cars near motion raceworks headquarters!!!
Congrats cleetus
Love these guys,hell ya brother
Hell Yeah!
Congratulations!!!
Day 71 of becoming the most subscribed YouTube channel with zero video’s so I can live the life. 💪🏼🙎🏼‍♂️🤙🏼.  Hell yeah brother. So freaking sick.
Bald Eagle hood ornaments
Cleetus and Motion Raceworks - A marriage made in 'Murica
You could’ve just made an onlyfans and just bought the whole company after about a year....
You guys deserve it man happy for the whole crew!!!!
Nice
Ehen you seen how big the sticker is on ol mullet it was pretty mug a given.  I thought he had a spotify deal like joe rogan
Be careful.... tough business to be in.
Motion has to make crate engines
Thank goodness, I was a little worried about the hotrod network offering you something to take you off youtube. LIVE ON FREE BROTHER
Congrats
This is amazing you guys I is so cool to see yall truly living the American dream. We all get to live this through your content. I am a fan for life. As for parts suggestions I would be stoked for anything g body or more small block/big block stuff. Great job!
Hell yeah brother! Big move! Congratulations!
Firstly, congratulations on the big move. Secondly, how do you guys do burnouts in the Reagle for fun, that thing is unbelievably loud, like holy crap how do you not go deaf?
You guys are going to need to get an IR camera to record burnouts.
That’s awesome congrats
Congratulations. Really pleased for you all.
Congrats 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
The McFarland guys officially have *almost* everything they need. It'll always be that way but at least this time they got a lotta bit closer.
Woo!!!  I guessed correctly last video!!!
Will there be boat part's built?
It be cool to get some budget build series where they build a car with MRW parts then sell  “kits” on MRW’s site so if I want a 9second fox body I can order the cleetus kit and get the same setup
I'm happy for all you guys.. Love Motion Raceworks and the McFarland family!!
💪🏼🎯
Many congratulations, fabulously well done from the uk 👍
Can Motion go back to gushers now?
Hell yea brother!
Awesome 1st day of racing in Ohio Cleet! I had the info made in comment section, but deleted it to not ruin future content!
Sooo. Will you stop taking free stuff from Texas speed now?
Heck yeah brother
I will 100% buy a cleetus turbo kit
Awesome news , Congrats to you and MW .
Congratulations
Best thing to happen ever
So the motion race works sticker on the Elco wasn’t really “ just because” he’ll ya brother, congrats
Glad to see James becoming part of the business and not just an employee
Proud to be America right there !
We need the Motion Raceworks Boxer dog montage!!!
Congrats guys
Congrats guys! It's awesome to see members of the community coming together to do big things! Skies the limit!
You guys need colored burn strips in your tires to create colored burn out smoke.
HELL YEAH IOWA MADE LOCAL TO ME
So when does WhistlinDiesel come on as head of Quality Control?
Love working with Haas machines!
HELL YEAH BROTHER just when im gonna start a ls s10 build
Hope rogan/Neil de gasse Tyson arent right about everyone driving self driven electric cars in near future and having to go to tracks to drive actual cars
Never saw that one coming
The welding was priceless😂😂😂
best dogs in the world . boxers rules
I thought he bought the rights to SCAT😅
Hire me up! Would love to come work designing and 3d modeling parts for yall :) First job is to model billet bald eagle hood ornaments 😂  Did you have to sign a "non compete clause" disbanding McFarland Fab?!?!
Hahahahaha that weld fail!! Yup lmao
I thought you were about to say James was leaving the channel at first lol
“There’s one of these machines that really Let’s off a howl, yeeeeee haawwww” 😂
Now all I need is a project car to buy parts. STI for the heavy rain in Georgia
awesome stuff man machining is cool AF. i run hass machines at my job making boat lift parts.
now it's time to broker a deal to merge motion raceworks and precision turbo & engine xD
Hell ya brother 😎
Clicked the vid expecting to see you sell out, instead I see you pushing your chips in and from me, nothing but respect. I think I can speak for everybody in saying congrats on your investment! The future seems bright for you!
make j30a5 turbo manifold
Congratulations everyone! It would be so cool to work there, looks like a great workplace atmosphere!
So what other Florida man bought the Milan strip....
Congratulations Gazza 🇦🇺 please get all your workers and yourself hearing protection  I noticed no one was wearing any
made in the usa ...damn straight!
I really thought he was gonna buy the dragstrip next to freedom factory (hey, then he wouldnt have to rent "test nights" anymore).
This is awesome! Congrats cleetus and jackstand
Fastest trip to Florida ever
Awesome news guys congratulations!👊🤘
You all deserve it!  Dream BIG! I'll be buying some bald eagles soon. #BET
All I can say is, HELL YEAH BROTHER!
I bet Cleetus would whoop corn cob in the 1/4 tho
Instead of buying shares... With that money, you can buy a CNC machien yourself and do it yourself. What you did is just a waist of money 😂
I couldn't be happier for you guys. You continue to make sharp moves and from the track to cleetus and cars to this you're going to be in the game for a long time. Congrats!!
Wish I could like this twice 🙂 I'm stoked for you guys. Great job
Wow!!  Hell yeah Brutha!!!  This is awesome!!   Best of luck to all of you!   🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
Hell yeah brother love it
I knew those Big Ass MRW stickers on Mullet weren’t for nothin’😜
8:16 the machine switching nozzles was pretty cool
THIS IS SICKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!
Next episode...we buy the city of Bradenton!
Honestly thought motion was in Florida
Cooper Bogetti has left the chat...
jackstand jimmy line?
Now hopefully they stay in Iowa and expand out from there. Love motion raceworks
Break room with 2 casting couches 👍🏻👍🏻
Intro needs to be an official motion raceworks commercial made me want to buy something
Congratulations Cleetus. that's awesome on another note you forgot to put the sucker inside your package
Nothing like taking money saved an diversity. Money into YouTube  channel, track, parts manufacturer. Like you said perfect way to set yourself up to have work for the rest of your life.
That’s bad ass
That's awesome
👍🏾 America First 🇺🇸
Be fun to watch you try and build a car in the carpark using mostly there stuff
Get you a boxer Cleeter, they are the best dogs!  Congrats btw!
Man, this channel is run by Kings.  Just when you think it can't get any cooler.
Man you had me worried.  Awesome news.
Time to see if motion has things for euro cars
I bet the site crashed right after this video aired because of all the people trying to buy stuff
This is just a tegridy add
You should send a parachute handle to Tom Bailey!
Some people sign deals in signatures, Cleetus signs them in burnout
Is it me or does Doug look like LunkersTV? Maybe just a little?
Huge Congrats!! Awesome move guys!!!  Bald Eagle's for everyone!
Why would 418 people dislike this, it's a great move. To get as far as these guys have they aren't stupid.
Crazy crazy stuff better strap in and get ready to be busy 24/8 453 days a week lol living the life
This is definitely the right move cant wait to see where this takes you guys
Your just an all around entertainer born and raised in the greatest country known to man now he’s gonna be makin my car parts can life get any better thank cleet sincerely’ big joe
Pretty rad dude’s. Way to take thing’s to the next level.
I thought he bought the drag strip at Bradenton yesterday but this is a great way to ensure longevity.
And now McFarland Machining can have their very own line of Motion Raceworks Freedom Parts. Congrats, Cleeter and Jackstand!
Congratulations guys!!
If they are looking for a scrapper to "puck"er to smelter worker I'm your guy. Plus have had at least 1000 hours on a cnc machine haha
Congratz! But is James allright? He looks a bit overworked like Cooper when you released the news about freedom factory.
Is Doug lunkertvs brother ?? They look so much alike 👀👀
Awesome seeing this cause I program and operate cnc mills and lathes daily
To be honest, this is anything but surprising.  Seems like a pretty obvious collaboration
Thank god it wasn't Motor Trend.
Only problem is that prices are outrageous 599 for valve covers, most people that want to get into racing doesn’t have that kind of money or have a YouTube channel with a million followers, i used to like how things were done with junkyard 5.3 and do it your self builds now everything is 10k crate motors and stuff thats not possible for the average viewers
Never clicked so fast in my life
Now the question is, will you have parts for crown vics?
I'm more convinced Cleetus just made a business decision that James and Him were spending more money on parts from Motion Raceworks that they just decided it was cheaper to buy a chunk of the Company instead.
Holy Toledo on the parachute handle
Congratulations guys
Welcome to Iowa! Hope you like corn and Humidity LOL!
what does this mean for summit?
That harbor freight torque wrench tho!! 👀 love the product the looks the whole shabangabang!
What’s up with all the haas symbols everywhere?
Is the new Cleetus steering wheel indexed so it’s always crooked?
Congratulations guys you guys work hard you deserve it keep up the good vids dreams do come true
Way2go Cleetus
Hell yeah brother that is some very great news and keep up the great work and love watching every video
Cleetus/Jackstand 2024!
I could watch hours of that vacuum wrapper
This tells you how much he loves drag racing.  He just did a video on how the epa is trying to stop the upgrading of street cars. Now he's part owner of motion race works. Congrats!!
Hopefully not paradise by the dashboard lights.
We need a Cleetus crown Vic nitrous kit
Congrats Cleetus and James.
Jackstand be looking high at😂😂😂
Two great passes for mullet today!! Hell yeah brother!
Gentlemen Congratulations on your new endeavors. It’s truly a née and scary endeavor. But make it a string and a carrot for people that want to support the channel. My meaning give viewer participation for wins at the end of the month for your new products. Beta users that actually race and have them test and show results. Use the channel or your secondary to show results. Have give aways, but with a twist with a well thought out comments but have a how and why and thanks with customers.  Your ocean is as great as your imagination let it flow.  Just some thoughts but seriously Guys well done I think I speak for all of us couldn’t be happier for a good group of guys. Keep it up your imagination is your keeper... KG
Wait they have hoes? Oh hose, I guess that make makes more sense.
Congratulations!  I wish you both the best with this investment.  Good idea thinking of the future. Those puppies look too skinny.
What year was Motion race works started ?
YYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats guys 👏👏👏
Typical millionaire investors, spends a couple dollars and then comes in and acts like he knows how to do everyone’s job
This dude makes me proud to be an American!!
Let’s just hope your channel doesn’t turn into a huge advertisement. Hopefully he plugs it in either at the beginning or end and keep the videos the same. Seen so many channels get money hungry and switch content just to make more money. Either way congrats it’s always a good thing to invest your money.
Cleetus steering wheels, quick I need one
Congrats Cheetos and Jack Stand  This is something to be proud of  Good Luck
That’s amazing, holy shit from buying a race track and now making their own parts, Cleeter really hitting the big leagues. This channel has come a long way.
Cooper just crying in the corner right now
Not what I expected but Motion makes great products, so it’s a great partnership.
Well damn now I wanna see the dogs work
This feels like a "Simple Rick" commercial
"McFarland Fabrication" is now actually a legit thing.
😲❤ surprised by this news...but then again not really since you guys have been basically sponsored by Motion anyway!! But a definite congratulations is deserved, and....the always handy....POB (Pat On the Back) good job, good job, good job! Now....about the support from people you mentioned at the end of the video....I know a place in the Honda realm that has almost absolutely Zero support in, and thats with the F series and H series engines (BoostedBois Kyle and PFI Brent would love this comment btw) and the Accord/Prelude platforms. Currently building a F22A1 for my 1993 Accord Coupe and starting to find a lot of stuff is going to have to be fabricated because of the small support of the platform.....would love to possibly see some Motion parts that would work on my build down the road, and I'm somewhat local in the area (about 45 minutes from DeWitt in Davenport).
The news about buying the freedom factory was more exciting than this to be honest..
Just started a new job working with CNC machines best job i have ever had look forward to making my way to a machine shop like this
GG old cleet  sweet mouve
“can we get a video of james just squirting shit”😂😂😂
I KNEW IT! DANG i wish I woulda called this one yesterday! 🤦‍♂️
Congratulations
Hell Ya Brother!
Question is though.. catch cans work on lfx v6 camaro motor? If so that's a game changer cause tracy lewis has our stuff monopolized..
Why don’t they melt the shavings and reuse it
Hopefully this means you’ll be in Iowa more often!
Get em' Cleetus!!!!!!!      FREEDOM
Congratulations guys, best news ever !!
That's a BIG HELL YEAH BROTHER right there
It’d be nice to see a set of “Hell Yeah Brother” billet valve covers for my Hemi!?!?  Just saying.
Damn I thought it was a helicopter for sure.
Hell yeah brother!! 3v Ford valve covers
The evasive liver centrally wait because baboon splenomegaly fool towards a lowly downtown. eight, jumbled border
Ive been worried since last night about the big news, so glad it was this.
Kinda like a 30 min ad if this place. Posting this was probably part of the deal to get more % without directly paying for it
That’s freaking awesome
Killing it fellas!
As awesome as this is, i think I was expecting some bigger news.
That explains the big stickers on Mullet & the nova ..
Dr. Spray Em All logo nitrous kits need to be a thing.
Awesome cars for maybe the next 15 years until they go full electric if the Democrats get there way.
Please make parts for Ford 5.43v
Big congrats and a BIG HELL YEAH BROTHER, will done mate from Australia
Can we get a Northstar supercharger to gen 3 LS adapter . Please please please
"We bought a 20% share of motion raceworx" My face...... (Pikachu wow face)
Time to start adding "Florida man tested and approved" to the boxes
14:55 LMAO!!
Love this
now yall gotta build a mrw motor from scratch on a budget so we can do it to
MERICA💪
HELL YEAH BROTHER
I wanna chill with Lucas
I'm really happy for everyone involved there's just one person missing from this equation and I just don't fully understand it and it's none of my business I was just thinking
TOTALLY up for this sick move! congrats you guys!
I love the smell of burning rubber! It smells like VICTORY! I wanna work where the dogs go to work tooooo!!!!!! Completely awesome!
Too bad cooper isn't a part of this any more . The channel has been on  a steep upward climb for ever now. Nothing but up from here.
I find the welding part hilarious when it just falls off and cleetus walks away like nothing happened.
Went from being sponsored to being a partner damn proud of you Cleet!!! Hell yeah brothers!!!!
well i didnt see that coming, congrats, now i just need to buy a dragcar to surport my brothers from merica
Cooper must be feeling like hes left Guns N Roses just before they went big....
HELLLLLL YYYYYEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH BRRROOOOTTTHHHHEERRRRRRR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
After yesterday's video I knew it had to do with something with motion raceworks but I thought it was the other way around
I support this 100%! Motion started with like 1 shop… and now they have grown to this.. they have done nothing but dump money back into the company instead of gettin paid and I love that… with Cleetus apart of the team… this is a rocket ship takin off brother helllll yeaaa!!!
LOVE to see success and growth...all the best into the future
Tractor flaps make all open Headers better.
When the Doctor asks “do you drink or smoke?”  Cleet: “Umm...smoke.” Doc: “how much do you smoke per day?” Cleet: “A set a day on average” Doc: 🤔
Motion Autoworks, is equal to "Cletus Mcfarland" as "Go Powersports" to Cars & Camera's. If you don't know who "Cars & Camera's" is, they build awesome Go-Carts and Muni Bikes! Check them out People!!!
Literally a 32 minute commercial AND..... I loved it!!!! 🤯  Congrats guys....
I haven’t been here from the beginning but I haven’t missed a video in years. I’ll be here for every video to come!!! Keep on rippin brother! Your frickin doin it! Hell yeah brother!! Do it for dale!
Nothing but upwards now, and it won't just be Bald Eagle replica cars..  Genuine Cleeter Parts
I'm over the moon excited about this. Love seeing good things happen.
Stock parts for the focus st and rs platforms. Eco boost turbos from pte, fuel rails, all the stuff
do you own a part of texas speed too?
Damn it would be so sick to start seeing Cleetus' name on car parts around the world.🤯
Congrats
Overhyped... bit of a let down...
Congratulations guys, awesome move 👏
Hell ya!! I’ve been a tool and die maker 31 years, running cnc’s for 20 . That’s my home away from home. Congratulations
Congratulations yall are killing it!
This put the BIGGEST smile on my face so proud of you guys its been so cool to see you progress through the years this is gonna be awesome cant wait for many many more years of automotive awesomeness.
if i were you guys, offer custom engraving on valve covers and colors, they will sell like candy
That engine was applauding that spectacular  burnout.. grats on the investment and may it yield a better outcome than military hovercraft or a nitrous factory.
thats great! now turn jackstand lose on a 20 second commercial and splice in the cars that are talked about, please.
Wow !
I'm so proud to see people making American parts.
I was hoping you bought Florida, but this is cool too I guess.
“Somebody check its vibe” lmaoooo. From sticking whistles in your exhaust and blowing up turbo keychains, to being co-owners of a full-on fab shop, I’m proud to say I’ve been there every step of the way. Proud of how far you and the entire team have come Cleet. ❤️ Do it for Dale, do it for Ed, and never stop being ambitious. 🦅
Watch out jeff bezos, old cleet is in your mirrors, I reckon, he’s goinaa past you!!
the best 32 minute commercial I've ever seen...way to go Booyyssss...
Shark Tanked it
Who knew, ginger Seth rogan makes car parts.
Great Team to associate "Freedom Factory" & "Cletus & Cars" with!
Restock the hats bro
Sweet
machining these days is probably the least impressive thing that goes on in a shop like this, once a cnc is set up with the cad files, its just load, press go, and unload. the time and effort that goes into making the cad design, testing the machining of that part, going back, tweak the design, test the machining again, testing the finished product, going back to the drawing board because it is not working as planned, testing the machining again, testing the part again to finally end up with a well machined and functioning part, that is where the magic is these days.
This is awesome, always wish you all the best!
Great guys and a great company!!!  I fully support this move and will continue to use Motion Raceworks in all my builds!!!!
Congrats brother...... Ive been buying parts for the Monte from Motion
I'm just not gonna buy car parts with some guys name on it because I like his youtube channel. like this shits for fan boys.
Next, Cleetus buys a Bald Eagle reserve.
Texas speed is gonna get a lil jelly..   better include big brother in the hoohaa or they gonna throw a hissy..  and a texas sized hissy aint nothin to joke about
You guys should make a Cleetus McFarland 5.9/6.7 Cummins valve cover in red white and blue if y’all do that I will 100% be the first person to buy one.
its aluminium not aloominum  :P
I wish y’all gave more incite on what you will be doing within motion, are y’all research and development guys or just promoting the brand? What do y’all bring to the table?
Now we know what the everyday videos are paying for!
That’s too cool. You all make a fantastic team. If it can survive a beating from ole cleetus  and Jack stand jimmy you know it’s good
Hell yeah garret! Small town proud, keep supporting your fellow entrepreneur/company. That’s wicked.
What about the bathrooms??
Those valve covers are sickkkkk
First time I heard cleeter cuss
I just thought you were buying a bigger Blackstone grill....
I’m so happy for y’all! Congratulations on reaching another level! God bless y’all!
Congratulations James, Cleetus and Motion Raceworks! Now if your parts don’t arrive on time you can only blame the shipping company👍🇺🇸
Freedom Factory needs to take the title for flying the largest American flag!  the current record: In Gastonia, North Carolina, the town lays claim to having the largest flying American flag. Just outside the Crowder’s Mountains, the flag is 114 feet wide by 65 feet tall, totaling 7,410 square feet. Each stripe on the flag is five feet tall,  For it to fly, it is attached to a pole that is over 225 feet tall and has a diameter of five feet. The pole itself weighs about 80,000 pounds, about the same as a fire truck.  But on a good day, the flag can be spotted from over 30 miles away. HELL YEAH BROTHER
NODBODY IN AMERICA DOES A BETTER BURNOUT THAN OL' CLEET!!!!!!!!! LET FREAKIN GO DUDE CONGRATS!!!!
Now if only MRW had stuff for Jeeps...  I'll volunteer my JK if y'all wanna prototype an LS swap kit (just sayin 😏)
Congratulations, guys! This should make life easier, too!  Coming soon to Florida...
I'm so happy for you guys congratulations guys hell yeah
Will this affect your relationship with Texas Speed or Summit Racing?
you should do one valve cover red and the other blue and the intake white!!
What it's all really about: *Made in U.S.A.*
Congrats, its been pretty incredible to see how far this channel has come, i subd back when you first bought leroy and have been watching every video since, its been quite the journey and i must say you guys are living the dream. Keep it up
Should have used the money to move workshop including Jeremy (rent free) to freedom factory. He helped you where you are... bring back Jeremy
I know Motion Raceworks mainly does LS engine stuff, but is there any chance we can get some more 5.0 parts? Maybe some badass billet valve covers or something
When does the Motion line of jet boat parts hit the shelves?
Hell yeah brother love seeing people invest in America made businesses
Bruh shout out to motion for putting in all that work
Good move to you all. Your only going up from here. . Can’t wait to see what comes out of this hopefully you will make it bigger again
Should try get some of the parts stocked local in Australia I’ve always liked motion parts but being only in America (from what I’ve seen) makes it rather expensive to order maybe the rod shop could do distribution?
We all need to come together now and stop this effort to kill our Hobby and Life styles by the government.
Hell yeah I called it on fb 😂 I seen mullet with "motion raceworks" and said "how cool if Cleetus bought a share of motion" and fb lovely security removed my.comment for going against community guidelines. Fuck Mark
Well that explains the huge MotionRaceworks stickers on mullet 😁
Did we just watch the world  longest commercial?
Hell Ya Cleet! I’m so happy for you and your team. You have seriously kicked so much ass! ! ! All your hard work & long hours are paying off. I mean it already has but wow this is next level. Really happy for you guys, and I’m sure millions of others are as well. Can’t wait to see motions new products with your name on it. straight killin it!!
I knew Motion was the best when I saw the boxers running the place!
Plz make a jackstand branded jackstand!!
The cnc machine doesn't go yeehaw it goes...freeeeeeeeedom.
Well, the stickers make since now... hopefully this doesn't turn into motion race worx channel
😎👍🏼🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💯
Man I'm happy for you I hope It really work out for u guys
Let's gooooo
Great, machining and designing is awesome, looking forward boys.
Hell yeah brother. Keep it coming
interested new venture,  now that the leftists want to end racing,  gas powered vehicles,  good luck
I swear i could smell that burnout.... 😉
Motion ship to Australia super quick
Man that valley cover and valve covers in a chevy orange would be sick.
Really had me thinking the dogs actually fetched the parts for the orders 🤦🏻‍♂️
Congratulations on the new business venture! Love the welding goof!!
This *SHOULD* be where most intelligent folks get off the fun ride that has been the Cleetus Experiment. Absolutely nothing they have ever done or said should in any way make you think them investing in a part company is good for anyone but them, but I'm sure morons are gonna flock to buy his soon-to-be-overpriced parts.SMFH
Mr.Clett anything with HAAS , on the Machinery , is all MERICA , BUY IT ....................
Congrats, guys! This is such a big deal and I understand the hype! Cant wait to see what else is to come for you in the future!
Can’t wait for that cleetur bald eagle turbo kit
Do the recycle the shavings …?
You and Jackstand is like peas and carrots. I hope for all our sakes that y'all never screw that up! In an era where hardly anything on tv interests me, I look forward to every freedom lovin', eagle flyin' video you drop!
Could you get them to make 4 point and 6 point roll cages kits for all generations of the miata?
That’s so cool good luck hell ya brother
That's rad. But those prices aren't.
Holy Shit
Made in the USA  Hell yeah brother
Congratulations guys,  I know your insight and involvement will being Motion Works to a new level, cant wait to see what y'all come with!?!?!  😜😎
Damn. That catch can would look sick in my Jetstream blue GS. Anyone wanna buy a mighty mouse catch can?
Next up cleetus big block crate motor 😎
Congrats!
So it’s called “McFarland Raceworks” you  say? 🦅
Never thought I would shed a tear over a car parts announcement. Yet......here I am. God bless the USA, and god bless what yall are doing here. HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!!
AAAAHMUUUUUUURICAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
Motion Raceworks is literally my favorite part shop in the world
I'm not sure how this changes anything for you or for viewers like me... guess it just means you have a new stream of income.
I’d say time to start getting Ls swap kits for obs trucks
6.1 Chrysler stuff please 😂😂
https://youtu.be/qf22bddvLnc
I assume Doug didn't sell his portion?
Dreams do come true 🤘🏽
All my orders will now be through motion ...  Cleeter got me interested  , Boxers sold me !
Congrats guys y’all have been running their parts and testing them to the limits glad to see the partnership move up
This video gave me The Office vibes and I loved every bit of it.
Nice job guys, great move🤘🤠🤘
If Cleetus doesn't have a financial advisor I am even more impressed. What a solid move that should really pay dividends.
Remember when Coop was too big time for Cletus?  He could have been part of this.  Dumbass
EWWWW CLEETUS SAID SHIT!
Congrats now go out and tear it up
Congrats buddy!!!! What’s next for jack stand jimmy??
wow I was thinking holly
Hit up the goonsquad guys. They just got a LS car!
Garrett man, you have gotten so good at this YouTube stuff the way you speak so passionately I damn near shed a tear of passion from how genuinely devoted you guys are to providing the people with the best of everything. Everything you do truly has been for the people but you also get to pleasure yourself along the ride, you never fail to make us feel included, ive been watching for a couple years now and I gotta say you’re the only energy I’ve felt consistently confident with knowing I’d get the best and most Wholesome passion driven content anyone could offer. Although I love you, I hate you, I can’t find Anything as good to watch, when month of freedom is gone I’m gonna be distraught 🙃
Dude congrats !!!!!
The head machinest is basically Seth rogen
Good to see you guys in the machining game... to bad your using Haas
Congratulations!!! Great to see you guys making big moves!!  🤘🤘🔥🔥
At least someone sees my long time dream and is living my dream. Congrats guys.
Good luck with your new venture, I’m sure Motion Race Work and the Bald Eagles are going to have an incredible working relationship. You’ve come along way from buying a race track, doing it up, holding races and now as well as building cars you are going to be developing and using parts you have a vested interest in, well done and good luck for the future for the both of you and Motion Race Works. 🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎
Not bad for a law school drop out.  Wonder how many times you heard you will never get anywhere just playing with those damn cars. Congrats!
I guess telling us that they didn't pay for the sticker to be on the El Camino was a hint huh😅, oh now I see why it's big 😁😂❕
This is what the young YouTubers need to learn more of, putting the fame towards a lasting goal that can be productive and profitable.
What’s the benefit?
Ahhh now that giant sticker on the Elco makes sense! 😂
I haven’t been this excited since somebody stuffed a banana down my pants and turned a monkey loose.
Right on guys Congrats
Cleetus is literally just living the GTA life, buying all the various businesses
I wore the exact long sleeve shirt today! Lettttssssss goooooooo!!!
Awesome! Glad that you have taken the opportunity to get together with M.R.Works to continue to grow and to step up your game. This is a major thing and I'm sure they are glad to have you guys onboard with them, and the people who watch your content will definitely give them more business than they have already! 🦅🇺🇲✌️👍🏁 Time to let it rip tater chip! Hell Yeah Brother! Freedom at it's Finest! Congrats on your next step on your way to a great plan for the future!🏁🇺🇲🦅 From Fultondale, Al. Been a long time fan. Peace and blessings to you all. Me and my GSD love to see what you have in store for us next!
Never forget, Garret was planning to be a lawyer.  He’s FREAKING SHARP AS HECK!  Not only that, he’s backed by smart parents/friends.   Sky is the limit!
Cleet on his way to being an industrial leader.... couldn't think of a better company to team up with... congrats buddy, very proud of you..❤️🔥🔥🔥🇦🇺👍
Motion race works if you were wondering and didn’t want to watch the WHOLE video. 20% ownership in company
nice deal fits the channel definetely  maibe you can do a special deal on the motionworks website for orders over a certain cost getting a free cleetus t shirt , could give youre youtube channel a little boost too for those not familiar with it  they might allso be able to do keychains medallions with motion raceworks on one side and the cleetus mc farland logo on the other  the parachute handles should say whoaaaah brother if they make brake calipers you could do the same inscription
CONGRATULATIONS BLOKE WELL DONE !!!!!!
Can't wait to see where this goes! The bald eagle gang just got bigger!
As a machinist i loved this episode.  and motion has some nice machines. Hass Is American assembled, just not there f1 team.
I hope James is a signed partner too.  He is Cleetus not just Garrett.
Manz says in bio everything u need ....but don't have crown vic 4.6 parts😢
Will it mostly be GM parts that they offer?
FUCK YEA!!!!!!!! LETSSSS GGGGOOOOOOOO!!!! That’s amazing! Let’s get it! MISSON FREEDOM BALD EAGLE IS UNDERWAY!!! Keep up the amazing content, work, whatever it is! Super excited!
tldr: cleetus and fam bought 20% of motion raceworks.
Those machines are so much fun to use
If you ever want to have an awesome machinist just contact my husband who has 37 years of cnc machining experience.
Gotta put “slow down brother” on the parachute handles
Best merch plug ever!
Guess I'll have to buy everything mrw now! 🤷🏻‍♂️
Next partnership is with Yard Mastery and Allyn Hayne :)
YES!!
To anyone who thinks race parts are too expensive, now you know why. Quality takes time.
This is so awesome. Congrats guy you have earned it for sure. There is a great Future ahead of you can’t wait to see it
congratulations guys, you all deserve it the most!
You still in ohio?
Shhheeeeeessshhh
„Aluminum“ 😂😂
Hell yes!! Proud of you all!
Congrats gentlemen!
Nothing more MURICA than made in America and burnouts.  CONGRATS on your new venture.
You know M.R is badass when they got Haas stuff
Congratulations cleet cant wait to see the many parts you'll be coming out with
It’s great you & motion get on so well, but no offence Cleetus, but why would anyone want your name on their car why they can get the same product without it.  Drag racing & street cars is about making your own unique machine.   However I really like the branding, I like the oil catch cans, they look awesome
How about offering Mountain Dew green as another anodizing color choice
Now that is some solid long term planning! Good luck with it. Congratulations.
Lol 600$ for valve covers 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍🏻👍🏻
God Bless 🇺🇸!!!!
Congrats guys enjoye it 👍👌
The truth behind the Motion race works decal on Mullet. 🇺🇸🦅
Congratulations brother. Y'all will do well with Motion Raceworks. Great people making great products in America...that gets me fired up and best believe that I've already ordered some things for my Whipple Supercharged 2021 Silverado TrailBoss. Can I get a Hell Yeah Brother?
"where every part is freedom tested"
This is awesome gunna definitely be buying some Cleetus valve covers for my truck.
Cool to see them using f1 teams old machinery you know those machines are top notch
Congratulations to Cletus and Motion.  A match made in heaven. All those Haas machines (made in the USA) making freedom!
So you're in with mcfarland racing or are you both in as a person?
Holy Hell!  DeWitt, IA??  I live 30 min from DeWitt!!  Maybe I'll get a chance to meet Cleet and Jackstand sometime.  =)
I knew it was motion raceworks when I seen the sticker on the car. And Kevin asked about it, just seemed staged to me.
We going zoom now bois
That's worth a "HELL YEAH BROTHER'"  Congrats!  Actually..I need a 3 1/2 inch 90  about a foot and half long or so
Are the billet products available without being anodized?
The giant stickers on the El Camino are now 100% justified. Congrats Cleet!
This is insane when i think you cant surprise me any more you go ahead and raise the bar
did I just watch, and enjoy, the longest ad in history ? why yes, yes I did.  Not only that, I would frickin' LOVE a more detailed tour like a per-part episode that shows the process for metal block/blank to part. watching metal machining is great.
That's a big addition to store some twizzlers
itd be cool if you guys ventured in a 4.3l v6
Congratulations y'all. Hell yeah brother's. So happy for the both of you. God bless y'all and your family's.
This was just a 32 minute long motion advertisement and I’m not mad about it. Hell yeah brother
Do they make stuff for anything other than LS motors?
It’s the obvious next step. Congratulations 🎉
Too much, Too soon.  Focus on the FF.  Start a weekly race series.  Just my two cents from Central FL.
Hey Cleet...thanks for representing Freedom. You guys are killing it.  Good luck on all your future endeavors.
Incredibly happy for you fellas!!!!
No clue what I'm looking at but it's badass!!!!
Cleetus now gets a 20% discount on all Motion parts
I had a feeling this happened because of the mention of the motionraceworks sticker on Mullet... figured it was an Easter egg...
Congrats cleeter!!
Hell yeah brother, wish you all the best
Honestly excited for this. Hopefully this can turn into Cleetus and motion raceworks sponsoring someone like Taylor Ray to compete in pro spec and eventually formula drift.
Lesson of the day... Don't be cooper.... be a team player. Woooooo let's go boyzzzz
Mother Effin' Hell Yea Brother!
We need some ford love. Not only because Neighbor is the power house of the fleet lol. But now you guys really stepped up with a great company. Congratulations on the new journey
WEll shoot heres my shot then. Always wanted to be apart of racing. Wish i had me own LS platform to build. Becuase im broke back in VA i cant afford but would love to make a channel and document my journey. Call me "Cleeter Cub" or "Cubs" if it sparks a charity idea from the fam.  Much love, Royce.
Still sad that Coop’s not a part of the channel
Parts for a 09 caliber SRT-4
Dr Pepper machine needs to be changed immediately!! Mt dew 4 life 😊
You guys have been motivating me to build my dreams since the beginning, I wish you guys all the success in the world. Keep fighting for our racing rights and freedoms. Love from Canada, p.s. help us lol
Man I love it but man is it gonna suck if someday james and cleeter have disagreements. Gonna hurt everyone real bad
Need to make me some custom bike parts!
Cleets the only guy who can tip in like an Aussie I swear
I still want a 1/18 scale diecast of Leroy and Ruby.  Now I want one of Mullet too.  Partner up with someone to make that happen!
good idea for " exponential freedom '
i said dont worry it wasn't going to be that big of an announcement
God Bless you all!
Yes. Congratulations y’all. 👍👍
that blue damn near matches the paint on my s10 gonna have to get those blue valve covers
Now thats a burnouut CONGRATZ @Cleetus McFarland
I don’t mind your logo but I don’t want your name on my engine. Can you get them without the name or possibly a custom logo.
Can’t wait to start seeing “freedom glitter” in my next order!
sugar coat a profit scheme
Just sayin’ if motion happened to get a couple different generations of the Chevy luv and made steering columns there would be a crazy market buying them. I looked for a good 2 months trying to find one for my old luv
Great choice I love it congratulations to cleatus James and Maddie
Didnt know seth rogan worked in motionraceworks
At least they own Haas machines
Nice one, dude
CONGRATULATIONS JAMES AND CLEETUS!!!!  We need some " Jackstand" stuff too!!!
I’ll buy it
Yeye onya cleet
MR. Clett , So proud of U & MR. JJ / James ,  Count me In , Hell Yell Brother , Back U GOOD Ole Boy's 100 % / 200 % 10-4
Big BiG Moves Guys HELLLLL Yeahhh 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
hey congrats guys makin big moves love the vid as well keep it up
I’m happy for the US guys and girls, I’m just hoping this doesn’t become a ‘sales in the US’ deal, you have fans all over the world. Don’t forget us, we love you too!  Have to admit, I suspected something with MRW when I saw the big ass stickers on Mullet.  Congratulations on the deal, it’s a perfect partnership.
You gonna buy some of texas speed next?
Congratulations 😀 Made in America 😎
McFarland fabrication is REAL
I work for a company that machines all stock transmission rings for most all American cars
*Who else loves James as much as Cleet?*
Me: I'd like to get a CNC plasma table Cleetus: Imma throw down on a machine shop
Day 1 of asking Cleetus to teach me how to drift at the freedom factory on June 5th!  Also super stoked to see the new addition to McFarland Racing! Keep it up!
Congrats! Mr Cleet is letttin the BALD REGAL EAT SON!  #HELLYEABROTHER #DOITFORDALE #MOTIONRACEWORKS
Am I the only one that had to do a double take when Cleet said "squirtin shit"? Hell yeah , spicy words 🤘.
👍🏽👍🏽
The Chip N Dales!!!!HAHAHAHAHA!!
ok i was far off, i figured u was buying a bunch of equipment to do ur own parts but buying part of a company that already has the machines so much better idea.
Awesome job Cletus. So proud of what you have become.
Congrats you guys are killing it. Cant wait to buy some parts.
WOW that’s the last thing that crossed my mind, BUT I’M SO PROUD AND HAPPY! Congrats bro, you killed it once again!
Congrats   Couldn’t happen to better crew
man I'd love to work with yall..yall have alot of fun and make great content
Yall need to make parts for 80-86 ford trucks
Congrats you guys good for you
That car is so loud, the fluorescent lights were flickering
Coming out with any motion turbskies and S/Cs kit universal and car specific?
As a manual and CNC machinist as well as a CNC technician, this would be a dream job to work for you guys.
Now we need jackstand Jimmy edition stuff!!
Best move ever, best wishes from Germany.... well done!
I think you missed the R&D CAD and design department.
put a compass in a burnout car and you’ll never get turned around again!
Big boy moves 💰
McFarland fab really shot up in the world 💪
What good are modded car parts if the government is trying to take away our right to make modded cars? I sure hope we the people can stop the government from doing this.
I’m so envious and happy for Cleetus. We kept saying this year is terrible but look at this man. He’s an inspiration to all to not let your dreams just stay dreams but to go out there and make them a reality. I’m so proud to be apart of this family. Hell Yeah Brother!!!!
Hell Yeah Brother!!!! Congratulations fella's!!!
“James, stretch me out dude” hahahahahahahha
This guys wearing a cleet shirt he’s gets an extended lunch break 😂
Anodized harmonicas
Okay..... I haven’t finished the video yet but i was wondering what they did with the left over shavings
This is perfect. Good job guys.
Cleetus what an awesome move for you and the channel! so inspiring to see you guys reaching  and dreams you had. Keep up the great work man, love the content!!!
322 dislikes...REALLY!?  You gotta be a real _______ (fill in the blank) to dislike this video!
Dear diary,
When you come to the realization it’s cheaper to buy the speed parts manufacturer. Yeah it’s big brain time! I feel like every other video now saying congratulations, you guys are grinding and it and it shows! Hell yeah brother!
I was fooled by your previous thumbnail that you bougt 6 seconds 😂 this is way better. Better build than bought.
Hell yeah brother this is so so awesome you guys are still growing so Ig this means that my favorite channel on YouTube will never end
That would explain the massive sticker on mullet…well played well played indeed
this is awesome cleet. maybe it will motivate some people into the industry. but machining is really cool, you need your own parts shop now, Mcfarland Marine And Machine R+D AKA DEW WORKS for the top secret stuff, i can also come help if you need it hehehe
I think i just heard an eagle screaming outside my window while watching this
Great move in investing into companies  that can provide long term income. Start looking for your next investment and the next.
This is the real heaven
Finalllyyyyy, my doggg. So proud of you guys. Keep on keepin on. Big love from Australia <3
yeet!
I guess this is why Mullet has a huge Motion Raceworks sticker. Better be able to out run the MR Nova
What great news, you both deserve it so much, keep up this same momentum for the future. Congrats Garret and Jim
Best sales pitch ever, " you couldn't do that with a canoe "
Congrats from your home state. Killin it!
Okay I'll buy the rest of my parts from there from now on because they have boxers they got the right dog 🐕
Congratulations Guys 🙏
Freaking awesome!!! So excited and proud for and of you guys!
congrats brothers
One day Cleet welding wont be your enemy.
Appreciate your building your empire..but shit video...
Damn i was close! I thought you were buying Dougy's Nova.
That flag pole needs red white and blue leds
WOW   !!!   So happy for you dude .
So happy for you guys in this new step in your adventure! Proof that you can be successful doing the things you want
That's a BIG fire me up! Hell yeah, Brother and congrats from your biggest Canadian fan!
Didn’t know that Seth Rogen works at motionraceworks
Not gonna lie I was scared and thought yall signed to a TV show. TV shows really seem to kill channels we loved so much. However this news is fantastic and I'm happy for you guys.
Well I think it is a great move for you guys. I mean damn you are so good at breaking stuff that your input is invaluable. If you guys don't kill a part, then no one can. It is good for both sides of the businesses in my opinion. Plus in the end you guys are so good at breaking things that your ideas will help MRW in the end. I sure hope it works out for all of you guys, great luck!!!!!!
So happy for you Garrett and James. Been watching cleetus since day 1 . I'm a huge fan from UK, you ALWAYS make my day better watching your videos. Keep up the awesome work guys, from your biggest fan this side of the pond
Congratulations! A very savvy business move to diversify your success. YT can be unpredictable. Now I gotta find me some merch and parts at Motion. My new fave auto parts place. Get some!
Gotta admit....ol Cleet came through the overhead door with the burnout A LOT better than Matt from DemolitionRanch did with the elChromino!
So at the Motion Raceworks HQ Lobby there better be Life-Sized wax replicas of Cleetus & JackStand that welcome you to Motion Raceworks right?....LoL!!
Damn brother. You started a YouTubes channel. Done quite well. Bought a racetrack. Doing well. Now bought into Motion Raceworks. Good for you my man. I've never been proud of a complete stranger before. It kind of feels weird but, I'm proud of ya buddy. Good on you Garrett. 👍👏
I will have to go on the website to see if I need any of their parts . I prefer to support American workers as much as possible .
Would it be rude to ask if James name is on much? I feel like he deserves his name on everything 😊
I need a steering wheel for my camaro hook it up Cleet
“Jackstand buys 20% of Cleetus”
Dude!!! This is the SHIT!!!!!!  Hell yeah brother!
Congratulations you guys this is an amazing thing what a great idea I can’t wait to see all the ideas and all the great things you guys are going to produce together
I cried exactly 5 freedom tears
Man this is awesome super pumped for you guys
Congrats!!!! I was worried to did something dumb like sign with discovery lol
So when do they release the Cleetus special duck-call blow-off valve?
As a machinist, this video was one of my favorites. I've been watching since the beginning of Leroy. I've watched this channel grow and its been awesome! Thank you Cleetus and James!
That shelf of fixtures makes me really...uhm...excited.
Congratulations!! Awesome Young Men!!
I never expected to see ol #Cleeter doing a half hour long #Infomercial...
we should have known after he was talking to kevin about the motion raceworks sticker on the car!
Congratulations guys good luck. 👍
What about James's famous 100 shot nitrous kits freedom editions
congrats man you juggle so much with this channel and the track along with racing taking that step towards manufacturing is awesome keep it up (so should hvae went with james idea with the nitrous factory)
Congrats guys. That’s awesome. Doug and all the guys at Motion all seem like Great  guys. The big ass Motion sticker on the side of Mullet should’ve given it away. Can’t wait to see what the Cleetus team brings to the table for Motion!
That’s why the MotionRaceWorks stickers are so large on Mullet!!!
How long ago did you shoot this video ? That back room was finished in vice grips video lol
Pretty freaking sweet Garrett great thing that you did, you did mention that you were doing r&d in one of you previous episodes. Kinda felt like that something was in the makings, then pow you step in 20% invested in Motion Raceworks awesome. You're becoming a great ontrapanour.
Hey, y'all need a journeyman CNC machinist?
Give the people mirrored turbos at an affordable price!
Well I know who I'm buying car parts from
HELL YEAH BROTHER
How can I thumbs up more than once?
They need to have motion part stand at the freedom factory
He'll yeah brother congratulations 👏 I wish I could work for cleetus some how someway
More f body parts please
Is James an owner ? Or just cleetus ?
Ya know super excited for y’all but Ik your racing mullet I was hoping for a little taste
Doug looks and sounds like LunkersTV's long lost brother
What do you do with all the scrap shavings and everything else let me buy it
Danggggggg!!! That 5-Axis can make you a new V10 SMX/481X based 2000hp pump gas block. Once you have that, the skies the limit!!!
Id be curious to see sales numbers after this video lolol
This is so awesome guys! Motion works race team here we go!
Congratulations Guys!! What an awesome team you have built and continue to build!!
Cleetus bro you should try and mod a cruze turbo diesel I have seen nothing on it would be interesting
Congratulations
Congress
👍  Congrats cleeter 👌💯🔥
hell yeah brother!!
If Motion Raceworks is valued at 10 million(just a guess), that’s a 2 million buy in from ol Cleeter, he’s making moves.
Glad to see the freedom factory was a financial win, keep it up
“You see this noggin here, full of great ideas?” Anything to do with james and im like HELL YEAH
Yewwww
That’s awesome you helped them stay in business in these tough times👍👊
If you know cleetus he’ll take care of those guys
hell ya brother
Hell ya brother so stoked for you guys what a wicked move for the channel and your careers
Sweet congrats dude.
Proof right here if you work hard you can make it. And the United States is THE best place on Earth to do it!
honest opinion to help sales,  a very professional McFarland Fabrication logo would look a lot better than a cleetus logo that looks like a 10 year old signed it. the parts are fantastic,  the logos i can't see people building professional looking cars wanting that logo on it often
Great video guys , maybe put some thought into parts for electric cars because as much as I hate to say it I think that’s what most of our cars will be in the next 5-10 years , I’ve already seen a huge shift in thought here in Australia , they are also relatively cheap and super fast , I prefer petrol cars but just don’t think they will be around in main stream life in the next ten years
that intro and burnout was a BIG fire me up!!!
Congratulations!!! Don't forget about us old school blown alcohol big block guys! Hell Ya Brother!!
Can you make some sweet stuff for my Mazdaspeed 3. Plzzz haha
Holy shit $500USD for one of those elbows! Ouch.
Love it
my dudes! congrats! we need more americans to start further american industries like this!!
Freaking awesome man.  Doug an the dudes at motion are perfect for y'all to join up with. Amazing
Way to go Cleeter and Jackstand you boys are doing big moves so proud of where you started to where you are now. Keep it up!!
You had me with made in the USA !!!
I think it would be cool if you guys could make old school gen1 SBC parts. Like engine dress up kits, carb spacers, the list could go on.
“Guaranteed” 18:23
Congratulations guys !
So is motion raceworks going to develop a alternator Mount that will keep the belt from coming off
So great you guys! Well done! From Jet Boats, to partnerships, to drag strips, to Burnouts, The Cleetus McFarland Channel is just killing it!!! Well done you guys, well done!
Congratulations Cleetus and the team!!!! This is so badass and its all American made thats the best part!!!
Squish face when you going to use youtube money to fix that nasal issue?
Cleetus and Jackstand I wish y'all coupled with Motion Raceworks would fully sponsor SRC garage. They are a genuine tight knit family of racers and they sure could use the support. I'm sure you have met them before, but it would be nice to see them sponsored.
Hell yeah brother so so so proud of the whole team ❤💯🤘
Well dang I guess I gotta ditch my Rotary and swap in a LS engine so I can be apart of all this freedom!
😲😲😲😱
Hell yea brother
Wish they had mopar parts but that is awesome congrats guys!
“Can we get a video of James, just like, squirtin’ shit?”  -Cleetus, ‘21
Where are those made?
McFarland race works
Cleetus packing on Motion Raceworks*  Cleetus loosing: “It’s all about the love”
All this from Youtube videos, holy shit!!!!
Sad thing is they don't sell anything for 3rd gen hemis
🥰🥰🥰well that certainly explains the big sticker on the side of mullet
ID BE CUTING THERE PAYS MAKES PARTS CHEAPPER HAHAHAHAHAH I LOOKED THRU ALL THAT DIDNT SEE CHEAP AZZ CHINA TURBO WTH
This entire video was just an ad lmao
I was wondering why all of a sudden you guys started wearing MR gear a lot. Now it all makes sense.
Where can I apply!
Congrats brother! Forget dogecoin going to the moon, cleetus McFarland enterprises to the moon!!!! Was hoping to see yall out in Norwalk Ohio that’s where my union hall is, so awesome to see the moves your Makin and awesome to see you take your friends along to see them succeed just as much as you. Hell yeah brother, do it for dale
No fu@kin way, congrats doesn’t suffice man but till I find the right words congratulations my dude I’m so souped for you guys
well shoot, just one thing to say, HELL YEAH BROTHER!
Congratulations guys a huge move but a very good one I think
Nice, love those made in USA parts need more.
Do they have motion lotion? 🚬💣👽💩🚲🎣🇺🇸
Inb4 Cleeter becomes the new Bezos, but you know.. probably not a giant piece of shit.
Going to have to add a little motion race to the intro! You are literally writing race car history. So excited to see what the future holds for yous!
Congrats man
Spectacular
😎
More 5th gen Camaro parts please!
This is great! They're even funnier when they're not holding their own cameras! I see some type of TV show hosting gig in cleets future!
Sorry Im dumb but could I put one of those catch cans on my Stinger?
🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲LOL Cleetus sounds like he's doing a Pepperidge Farms commercial in the beginning!! 🇺🇲🇺🇸 Hell Yeeeaaah brother, Congratulations!! I can't wait to get my Cleetus valve covers, Freedom Blue of course!🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Congrats on the HUGE move!!!
Congratulations brother!

Fantastic video cleet intro was spot on! And some excellent news for the next level of freedoms
Congratulations Garret and family / friends  . I know where i will be spending my money !!!!
So amazed on how far you guys have gotten and still achieving levels tht show honestly how great & motivated The Freedom Factory is! Always thinking about your fan Family out here !  DO IT FOR DALE Brother!!🤣🤙🏼
you guys need to make a collaboration t shirt
Fucking awesome   Just awesome    Can i say it again awsome
Whos going back to yesterdays video and making fun of all those that were wrong?
Seems like they could be a little more efficient on those machined parts. 95% wasted material in chips in that billet elbow?
Bruuuhhhhh let’s goooo
Mans gonna start his own car company in 2024 🤣
I love james laugh
Gotta make digital displays that read “Do it for Dale” when you start your car
So awesome smart business moves!
Congratulations guys
Congratulations man!
Absolute Legends!
Would be cool is you did a meet and greet at Motion race works shop
Honestly buying a Stake into this company....Probably the most American thing Ol Cleet has ever done! 🇺🇲🦅🔥🙏
So proud of you guys!! LET FREEDOM RING BROTHERS!!!
Congrats boys well done!
That three part clamp, I dunno if they’ve thought about titanium pins because I mean... they might not wear well... but I mean, I dunno. Just a thought.
Good move since our country is becoming unfree and the constitution is going down the toilet with Biden flushing it.... Won't be long before YouTube sensors this channel due to loving America to much!
I need your face laser etched on some rocker arms
Congratulations guys! One day I will get my dream car like toast and will be buying from motion !!
Yall ain't here to take part, you're here to take over! This is so rad, congrats boys
Billet cleetus logo for on desk?!
A move like this could potentially save the automotive/racing industry! American companies hiring Americans making their products here! LOVE IT! 😍🇺🇸🇺🇸👏🏻👏🏻
Cleetus and friends, continually pushing the boundaries of what achieving the dream means This is beyond amazing
Cooper punching air rn
Awesome news and I think it was a no brainer for y'all to do.
The break room needs a Mountain Dew soda machine.
Hell yea guys!! Proud of y’all!! Hope all the best!!
Congratulations!!!!!!
Wheres Cooper been?
Congratulations!! No wonder there was no sponsor money for putting the name on Mullet. I will be a future customer of Motion Raceworks. Hell yeah brother.
Did these CNC machines come from the haas F1 team?
You should name your share McFarland Fab
Hell yeah brother happy for you man good choice my man
Congratulations you guys! Awesome tour of Motion! Sweet!!
Atta boys
AvE would be just like Jackstand Jimmy in that shop.
Awesome ! Congrats on your new business partnership.  Check out  Tight360 tool and machine In Jonesburg Mo.   It's veteran owned.
Well done boys.. .got your grown up pants on now
I was expecting a pole barn with car lifts and air conditioning. Congratulations!
Hey if Motion trusts the Harbor Freight Quinn torque wrench then so do I :)
Hell yeah brother this Southwest Missourian approves congrats bro!!
Hell yea brother
really happy for you and James..you'll deserve it brother
The Cleetus steering wheel comes pre crooked lmao . Congratulations on the new venture.
go team!
Boxers do all the packaging for shipping of course.
Lol as a machinist I'm very happy about this, but it's also funny seeing Cleetus explain machining.  I would love to see the occasional machining video.
He said he had big new not yuuuge news! Daaaamn son, that’s so rad. Congrats boys.
I forget that he used to be a law student.
New line of mopar??
Congrats guys. Glad to see yall stepping out into the parts field. Now if you ever get the itch to make a set of small block ford cleetus valve covers with a catch can id be the first to buy a set.
A meth nozzle port can be added into those 90's during the cnc process, boosting the value of the part as well.
Extended lunch break 🤣🤣
I just looked up motion race works on the map it looks like they're in God's racing country. Couple of little towns surrounded by a whole bunch of open roads
How does Summit feel about it?
Congrats what a great company to invest in!
Damn Cleetus and the NELK boys makin BIG BOI moves. I’m so proud 🥲
Motion makes some amazing parts! HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!!!!!!!!
You've come a long way Baby!
Congrats your making so many big moves owning a racetrack and now owning part of Motion Raceworks. Wow
wow this is exciting
All glory to God!
Hell yeah ,need the recycling machine for the wasted materials and so on  ad that to the process extra bald eagles
Buying a NASCAR next? I know a guy
I mean, I seen your girls’ bottom end light up on the quarter... might be a thing to keep an eye on... the inconel thing I mean... 🤙🤙🤙 (and Leroy...)
Hell yea brother! To be honest you scared the shit out of me yesterday!! So proud you are growing y'alls self! Listen America, these guys are great!!!!
Hell ya bud
Great job! You couldn't have made a better move!
Hefty blur on those units
Next video, "We now own 30% of Texas Speed "
Kevin: How much they pay you to put those stickers on?  Cleet: Nothing... ish.
Awesome news! I'll be honest i didn't see this one but it is great news! Hell yea brother!
When the useless EPA is trying to kill the industry, Cleet doubles down and buys a huge chunk of one of the top performance parts distributors. Respect.
Just a heads up; past few months inconel printing has been picking up steam out west... so, I mean, inconel is super heat resistant, I dunno manifolds, stuff... something that’s out there...
Love the “Ford parts we don’t need any of that” comment that’s because neighbor is the most reliable car in the fleet and the motor never breaks 😂
It’s so cool you made James a part of this partnership. James is the wrench behind this channel. Without James you may not be where you are today. I have a lifelong friend in my life and I will include him in every business deal I can. James will have your back when nobody else will. Investing in you future is always a great idea. If YouTube goes away you can still build race car parts... Congratulations Cleetus & Jack Stand.... You both deserve this.
Congratulations
6:30 James has a poker face and cleeter is just laughing his head off, great pair!!!!
What’s behind the blur??? 😂
I saw it coming!!!
You guys are patriotic, genuine, original, humble, respectful, down to earth, and dedicated to your fans. You Garrett are a true American automotive hero, and a worldwide inspiration. Thank you for producing kid friendly content for me and my son to enjoy together, and congratulations on the motion deal
Explaines the giant Motion Race Works sticker on the side of Mullet
Hell yeah Cleetus! Gotta find something of special editions to buy, even if I can't use it! This is so sweet, y'all are killing it man, congratulations!
Burnout view would b nice with a drone not going to lie
Watching it as a mechanical engineer this makes me very happy, good move!
Oooooh. So this is what friendships are s'pose to evolve to. Way to lead by example. Good job boys.
Dope!!
Nice one and I was thinking you where ending the channel 😰 love the video updates keeps me going from week to week
In before motion race works turbos blow up one of cletus's cars.
The Bald Eagles totally took over your body
Had me a little nervous for this video today. Last video you said dont panic,  ut also seen someone on the FF Facebook page say the sign was gone one the gate at the FF. Was thinking he sold it and bought another track closer to his family in Nebradka
Congrats my guy!!! Ill be looking foward for Ls Swap 88 to 99 obs silverado kits!
I'd love to see a mustang/ford drag car build using a bunch of the motion raceworks ford/coyote parts as a little bit of a change from the LS and crown vic content
This is an awesome move! I've loved watching the constant growth throughout the years and this is just another cool adventure. I feel like the timing is right for you guys annnd for me since I'm about to finally grow a pair of freedom nuggets and start on my first LM7 build 😅. Congrats guys!!! 💪🙏
So when are you gonna develop a new manual trans for Leroy?
You guys need to build your own motors,and call them.the baldeagles lol
20% shareholder now!      You're a ripper!!!!
Loved my 1/4 mile track Racing days !!! 😁😀😄 I built, raced my Fox body into the low 10's when I was in my mid- late 20's too... 😁🤗😃😄 Then I was the GUY who NEVER LOST my Wild Penis syndrome !!! ----> couple g/f's,------> steady girl ------> WIFE -----> (5) KIDS later !!! 😁 Well that expensive WEEKLY/monthly /EXPENSIVE hobby dried up, Quick, Fast, and in a hurry😫😪 !!! If James has any more kids... He'll get the MESSAGE real QUICK !!!🤔😫😟 Especially if SHE'S 1 of those, Who's got a nice A$$, knows HOW TO USE IT, in her 20's, who then MORPH'S into & the gal who then play's she's home all day, alone, taking care of the KIDS,  CARD !!! While your out with YOUR "Having fun car racing" spending money EVERY weekend, ALL the time, TYPE WIFE !!! 🙃😖😲 Good Luck James !!! Make that money while you still can brother !!! 😎😩😢🤣
Just watched a 32 minute infomercial, and I'm not upset about it... lol.
I am so happy and proud. You all deserve all the success in the world, good luck boys and girls.
Good luck. Your starting to grow up and looking to the future.
Congratulations bro 👏👏👏👏
So happy for all you guys patterning up ! Motion race works is just as happy to Partner with you!!! Now you gotta have extra everything! No excuses! Lol
Hell yeah Brotha, been watching from the very beginning with the whistles in the exhaust, keep it up, this is awesome
Remember when welding masks didn’t auto darken? Lol
Congratulations from pei
Kids pour in here, they want every performance part he’s got and they pay cash!!!
The crew came to Iowa and you didn't let us know?!?  You got to let us know next time.
Been watching since the beginning and I’m so excited for what the future holds. Keep makin power moves and never stop dreaming big brother! 🤘🏼
As a resident of Iowa and a proud user of motion race works parts so freaking excited
The group of boxers and the group of the golden retrievers is the video everyone wants to see
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Jeez new owners know nothing ;)
Would love to see some Jackstand Jimmy Jackstands and a line of tools I.e   an wrenches and things like that
Go figure the 5 axis HAAS is being worked on, typical
Before you know it, the sign out front is gonna read McFarland Raceworks.   The parachute levers should say Woah Now Brother.  LOL
1:02 has me dead 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Congratulations... its crazy too see just how far you guys (the channel) has come in such short amount of time... KEEP UP HARD WORK BOYS/GIRLS...
Congrats cleet. Thats so cool having your name on your parts.
I usually avoid merch and plugs from YouTubers, but something makes me EXCITED to support cleet. I don't even own an LS and I want those valve covers!
You want to see this motion raceworks thing blow up big time. All it would take is all of us who subscribed to Cletus around two million each buy something that at the very minimum makes a dollar prophet. Even if you don't have an LS oil cap for 1. Suddenly Cletus will be 25% of 2 million dollars richer and motion will be able to make more American jobs....merica!
Congratulations !
Hell yeah brother! Awesome!
Smart move James and Garrett, YouTube might not be for ever. Congratulations !
We still need another Coyote swap
As a car guy who also has done CNC work, I wanna work here. lol That 5 axis!
This is so incredibly BADASS.. Congrats boys, onto a whole new level of freedom!! May the future bring success, happy customers and MORE BURNOUTS!!
Speculation was rampant yesterday, and NO-BODY guessed this! Step 2 of Cleetus motor sports domination is official.
I thought that was Seth Rogen at first
Your living my dream I've literally had a idea like this
We NEED a jackstand jimmy jackstand!!!
I'm here for it all! Keep on keeping.
Wow! Congratulations guys. I’m sure this partnership will be beneficial to Motion, Cleetus and James. The parts look fantastic and I’m sure the quality control will be top notch. 😁🥂🎉🇨🇦
Garret, gimme a job, i'll mop your floors if that's what it takes to get to America 😄
I shed a real tear. Y’all are killing it!!!
Congrats guys
So proud of you guys, fan for life
I’m sure 2025 video is gona be like “Big surprise we bought our own city” freedom town lol 😂 good job fellas it’s nice to see cleetus and friends doing so well keep up the good content and don’t forget where you started
Amazing company with amazing people making amazing products! Absolutely perfect fit for the MotionRaceworks family. Can’t wait!!
Now I understand the jab at the sticker size yesterday.
DUDE im a machinist in Iowa!
Seth Rogen works for motion raceworks!? 😂
This is one channel I will doing anything I can to support. From buying t-shirts to ppv's. Congrats on the big deal. Ex
Congrats !!!
The fact that this is way more significant to him than buying a freaking racetrack is saying something
.9 pounds...  Is America the only developed country to not adopt the metric system into schools yet?
this is amazing news. So happy for the team. WE THANK YOUUUUUUU. Hell yeah
Congratulations guys that's badass
Congratulations Cleeter! And jackstand James!! Like the Valve Covers! Would love a Set on my LS3!  GEN 5 CAMARO SS. Best of Luck with the Move guys!
I dunno what to say... so.
What a Great Team!! That was a real smart move Garret and James!
Congratulations Garrett, such a inspiration you are Sir, don’t forget about God giving you these blessings in life.
Cleetus McFarland do they make the 90 that hooks directly to the throttle body so v band clamp on both sides
Congratulations!! Now I just need something with a LS……
Congrats! Quality stuff coming from those guys,  When you going to make some MkII Supra parts?
Hell Yeah! I’m happy my Camaro is still stock! Definitely gonna be buying from Motion now. 2012 Camaro 2SS
Will Motion raceworks make the same stuff for Small Block Chevys that they do for the ls engines???
Dude this is freaking sick.
Guess now we know why the logo is so big on Mullet :) Nice job man, best wishes
Next on Cleetus , We are also buying in Texas Speed
Some say James is still at Motion trying to figure out how to put nitrous on the 5-axis.
Hell Yeah Brother!!!!! 😎🇺🇸🦅🏁
Watery happy eyes
So, will there be motion raceworks parts for sale in the merch store at the freedom factory?
motion even has seth rogen working for them
Hell yeah brother! I’m watching this on my lunch break at a similar machine shop in AZ.
Damn congrats man
I used to build those bendtech dragons.. the guy that designed it (my cousin)  also is the guy that designed JGS Precision waste gates and BOVs
Cleetus is like the Mr.Beast of the car world
Badass move!!
HELL! YEAH! BROTHER!
I can't believe you own how many t56 cars and not capitalizing on shifter balls t handles like a 1 2 3 hell yeah 4 spicy 5 bald eagle 6th lol
Hell Yeah Brother!
This was the longest commercial I’ve ever seen 😂😂
Now I understand the awkwardness when Kevin said how much they pay You for the sticker. Lmao
Way to go dudes. 🤙🤙🤙
Does all the shavings get melted into blocks again?
The stickers on Mullet were the giveaway! Congratulations guys.
I feel like an idiot. I design parts for racing and some hot rod type stuff. I never thought of buying into a company and bringing my stuff to the table. I thought I would have to just keep producing at my comparatively slow pace until I somehow made it. Mad respect man.
Wow I've been watching this channel for a long time.   Awesome job guys hard work does pay off!!!
This is awesome news !!!
With the Ford Godzilla gaining popularity as more and more people do the swap, what the market really needs right now is an intake that is similar to the old Cobra intake with the long runners that can fit under the hood of most cars so we can run em on the street without a massive cowl.
Lovin' my guys, watch em grow😀
Congratulations guys! This is gonna be Great! It’s you all putting life back into our sport!👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
So thats why them stickers were so damn big. Good call boys. Diversify.
Do we have the Elon Musk of the Motoring world  😁 Congratulations king cleet n crew
Now that's a burnout!!
This is so sick congrats to you all!!!
Congrats on this awesome deal with those guys at Motion Raceworks, Cleetus.  You seriously deserve the deal, dawg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hell yea thats awesome 👌
Being a machinist myself this is awesome stuff to see, I hope to machine car parts eventually.
Come back to Australia for the summer nats next year
Lol, "how many axis' is this one?" (when you can just look at it and see). Bell Helicopter would CAN me if I asked that! If you see this, I'm just givin' ya a hard time brother. Love the show......
Congratulations bro. Hell ya.  Loving my straw hat
looks a little lite on mopar stuff 😜
Greatest channel on youtube right here.
Spend more money yaaaa

HUGE MOVE CLEETUS!!!!!! So excited to see where this takes you! This household is lifetime fans. We love everything you do bro.
Hell to the Yeah, frikin brother!
Only way to go is up!!!
Hell yea definitely a big money/ financial move and a perfect company to partner with
I saw you on this past Friday coming back from your road trip boating. I was heading north.
Imagine that, only the freedom factory can theoretically...have someone in a stock car, mod to go fast, race, crash and go home all in one roof!
After this video I'm sure motion raceworks sees at least a 20% increase in sales.
Well done. Investing in yourselves and America. All the best!
You guys are making some very smart decisions.
So stoked for you guys!! Wish you guys all best of the next leg of the insane life you have. Much love from the UK 💥💥
Hell yea brothers ........big move, great move..... proud to hear this!!
Hell ueah brother!!!! That is awesome that you guys did that with motion works
Soo do you recycle the shavings and re melt them down?
The key to keeping costumers happy is free company sticker with every order. Plus it’s free advertising on their ride or tool box. I know I hate it when I don’t get a sticker
James needs a toolbox and jackstand line so I can keep my truck in the driveway longer
Waiting for the day I can invest in motion race works. Don’t have a race car but I’d definitely invest in this brand
Lucas looks like a Irish Seth rogan and I can’t unsee it lol
Awesome 👍
Congratulations boys!  Ideas can now come to fruition.  I have a feeling you two are the new  R&D guys
Automatic like. No choice other than automatic like button.
where is Cooper??
Way to go
Hahaha HELL YEA BROTHER!!! Congrats! I hope I’m half as cool as you when I get older! I loved the packing competition! I’m a packer at Amazon right now and you guys suck! 🤣🤣 jkjk much love!!
Congratulations!  So awesome 🤟

Congratulations! You get out what you put in, hard work pays off!
You took “Diversify Your Portfolio” to a whole nother level🤣
Looking forward to the KSR 9" rear end housing setup for leaf spring cars.
You start making turbos.
Does this mean you get 20% off now?
Congrats guys

28:20  coulda really used a WaterJet Channel approved "lick test"
Congratulations to both of y'all, big plays brings big pay. I will have to say you had me scared,  thought you were going to a pay to watch, like road kill did,  I would be devastated to lose your content and your channel.  Your the best on YouTube as far as I am concerned.
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one

Congrats! I'll look into getting some Motion parts for my 81 vette build.
CLEET IS THE DEFINITION OF A CERTIFIED AMERICAN!
Congratulations Amigos

I never saw a hefty blur but I did see a good amount of side by sides 👀
McFarland fab going teal
OMG I god dame love this, he'll yea brother 🙌
Making moves, taking people with, and holding hands with all those who helped along way.  Legend.  Never lose your humility and humble nature; though you are becoming a living legend.  Hell yeah brother!  So proud and happy for you.  Hey, be true to yourself… see your friends, see yourself… blah blah blah.  Im really excited for you and your team!
The only timing Cleetus checks is his 60 ft and quarter-mile time!
I think we just witnessed the start of something amazing
Are you guys hiring?
Talk about the ultimate hell yea brother announcement yall definitely living the American dream life
HELL YEAH BROTHA!!!!
Fucking awesome!!!! Will order the first cleetus and james part that will fit on my hotrod!!!
When you watch his “tune in tomorrow for our biggest announcement ever” in the morning and after work that video is here 👍🏻👏🏻
LETTSSS GOOOOO
How much money has YouTube given him to get to be a 20% shareholder?????
Holy TOLEDO, bud!  This is AWESOME!!!
I laughed I cried I cheered. This should be a big screen feature. Oscar nod for the intro McFarland manufacturing go getcha sum!!
Lol, vette parts, yay
Sponsor a series for chrisfix so he can do a full swap with motionworks parts !
Congrats! Would love to see a meetup/open house at Motion Raceworks sometime. Just so happens to be very close to home!
Hey cleet
1420
As corny as it sounds, I feel like I am a part of this. I remember the first video I watched was Cleetus putting the whistles on the vette... how times have changed. James was such a nice addition, ill never forget the comments at first as they werent sure about him, but he has quickly become one of the many bright spots on the channel. I wish you continued success.
Yeah... Not a Florida man. Thats literally an ausie burn out car
Hahahaha the edit in the beginning of James with the nitrous bottle was the best part of this video.
Ya'll are some cool dudes 🤘
Do you make gen 1  sbc stuff for my baby mullet
I don't think they have enough but 6apl should stock black sheep industry waste Gates
Living the American dream. Congratulations brother 🇺🇸 🦅
Oh shoot, they got hose?
OMG !!!! Its about damn time you guys used a lavalier microphone for once ...
This isn’t big , this is absolutely HUGE!!! Congratulations
Iowa, or some shit
Congrats!  Beyond excited for y’all. Well deserved.
Congrats to Cleeter and Jackstand. This is a huge step but this will take everything to the next level. I'm not sure but is looks like they are mostly US brand oriented. But I hope they will get into Honda stuff for the Boosted Boiz and kits for LS swapping both for JDM cars and Euro cars. Like swapkits to swap an LS into a BMW. I believe Jimmy O got his adapterplate from Poland for Brians E46. It was a nice machined billet plate, I bet Motion Raceworks could do it even better. Lots of succes in this great step forward. And I expect to see the MR products being available too on the Bald Eagle website. Way to go brothers, deep respect and so cool Motion Raceworks is joining forces with you guys. Since they also do Ford stuff, RTR might be interested in hooking up in this deal.
Hell yea brother
James... A Florida man, you aren't.
Full ls miata swap kit would be sick
Didn't hear anything about Mopar parts but congrats to all of you
The best freaking option possible!
1420, sold them out
Congratulations!!! Do you guys makes a efi kit for my 340 mopar?
You've come a long way from rubber chickens and turbo key chains. Congrats guys, now go out and turn 6's.
Ahh yes James, who is literally a Floridam. You ain't. You. Are from Iowa.
As a make-believe board member of Cleetus McFarland......I approve......and congrats
That's awesome guys!
Hell yes! Congrats Jack Stand and Cleetus!
Hell yeah brother
Fire me up!!!
really hope that the steering wheel is a chrome bald eagle!
Congrats proud of you guys...
We need a year of freedom!!! Lol would be sick ;)

Someone in a reply said we need Jackstand Jimmy jackstands. Honestly I can’t find any jackstands to buy since they all seem crap quality. I’d definitely buy 4 if motion started making and machining them.

BTW, my wife shed a tear watching your proposal.  Thanks for the video that I could show my wife so that she understands how awesome your channel is... Now she knows about the greatest American video producers!

Awesome deal. Next up Texas Speed. I mean you invest where spend most your money right?
Hell yea brother!
Let’s goooo that’s a huge move. Congrats to all of you.
I don’t want my valve covers to say Cleetus on them, so can I get mine to say goober?
Full send burnout!!!  Ah-la Aussie style!
Man, I would like to congradulate you on your newest venture. And wish you the best of luck.
This made me shed a tear of pure freedom 🦅🦅🦅
Diversifying your investments is always good. Youtube, merch, race track, PPV, now parts manufacturing, good job.
you need to build aircraft hanger garages around the freedom factory and rent them they will pay for maintenance especially if you make a small runway that you can race on and land planes
Bald Eagle Emblem for Mercedes! F that Mercedes emblem I want a Bald Eagle!
So just fuck Texas speed tight? Damn didn’t see that one coming.
Years ago I originally watched this channel and knew it was for me never did I imagine the things I would see and experience cleetus n cars....hell I even own a small peice of the freedom factory. Truly thank you for all the amazing content its so awesome to see your success and the journey has been a frickin blast. Hell yeah brother dont stop now were all hooked.
Congratulations Guys much success in the future.
Congrats! Love seeing investment in my state. They seem like a bunch of cool dudes that truly care about there parts and there customers
I'm not crying, you are.
Pneumatic heads?
Congratulations Garret! Other influencers  need to be taking notes on how to maximize their channel! You’ve done it both for the creativity and now for the long term income
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🙏💚
someone HAS to figure out how to make a GEN3 coyote valve cover to fix what ford messed up when they changed it from what the GEN2 looked like to the GEN3 mess!! get on it guys, ill but the first one you make!
LETS GOOOOO!
HELL YEAH BROTHER. Also day 18, chief need a Barra
So proud of you Jackstand Jamie and Cleet.    Please continue to look out for each other and grow your lives.
Hell yeah brother👍
Once I get a unit of a car I’m buying some parts
Congratulations 🎊🍾
The "AWESOMENESS" just keeps getting "BETTER"... Congratulations 🍾🎉🎊🎈
Suddenly the giant decals on Mullet make sense
you need a vacuum molding machine to package your parts. its the ultimate way to ship wrap the part in foam then shrink wrap it in thick plastic
👍🏽
Need more parts for gen 5 trucks
Sheeeeeesh. Now I need to become a V8 guy. Can't rock a Turbo 4 with all these sick v8 parts comming out.
Jet boat parts commin in HAWWT!!!??!
Hope you boys keep rippin it and don’t turn into full-time businessmen! There’s a lot of boring time consuming shit involved with being a large stakeholder of a company lol. But in all seriousness, congratulations. Glad you could make a great investment in something that aligns with your personal interests.
Brooo that's sick asf
When golden floofs team up with boxer pops
This is so freakin cool guys
Congratulations, I should YOLO some of my GME YOLO money int MRW. They do stuff I like.
Congratulations
You deserve it fellas. May it never stop!
You guys need to get them to make those parts all in red, white, and blue. A murica theme LS in my swapped 84 Celica gt would really piss the ricers off. Also if anyone has any suggestions on how I can get the car to stop popping it's windshield on hard launch's it'd be a lot of help. It already has a full cage but the body tweaks it's windshield out a lot. It gets expensive.
YouTube keeps trying to get me to join a patreon for the channel and I can't even afford a day to day life but he out here buying hummers to run through dam's retired racetracks to make a play field spending hundreds of thousands on shit and buying stocks in big companies? The world's fucked no wonder the rich get richer! And we're supposed to support this lavish life?  Wish I could afford food to eat on a fortnightly basis.
I use to works For Franks International(formerly Franks casing crew) and we had an Okuma 9 Axis that had a platform close 9 feet off the ground to be able to operate the computer and see the machine cutting. We would put 11,000 lbs of raw material into it and doing everything from horizontal lathe work to drilling and threading! We had 4 Mazak 5 axis and had a wild 3 axis lathe that somehow was capable of even engraving on the part but the entire machine was set up like a traditional lathe
Cleetus: I got this Also Cleetus: *cuts the end he's welding off* My work here is done
Cleetus you keep saying "They make" this and that, but shouldn't it be "We make"
Now you have to represent the Ford products on Neighbor! More FoMoCo content. 😁😂
Been a machinist for 12 years and run my own shop making medical devices here. Watching these goofs walk around a cnc shop was the highlight of my day.  One thing they didn't say is those haas cnc mills are made in the USA.
Can you talk about how they’re associated with haas f1?
Hell yeah dude!!! Start makin parts for the Crown Vic! And 4th gen RAM 1500
I'm happy for you all!
The parachute handle should say “whoa yeah brother”
Arnt you guys worried about the government ruining motor sports with their bullshit emissions bill that will ban any modifications on any cars??
Be the first company to make a lowering kit for a dajiban
GM A-Body LS swap kits. Make those. Please!  Specifically for a 1967 GTO/Tempest/LeMans
The possibility too own a car part, future designed and made by clettus is epic. Im sure he wants too learn the coding for the machines already 🤣
That big motion race works sticker on the elco and making a whole lot more sense haha, this is awesome.
Bro I’ve been watching since Leroy had the LSA supercharged LS1 and seeing your world with race cars collide with mine in a machine shop is like a dream come true. I’ve always wanted to make racing parts in a machine shop environment. Shoutout to motion raceworks for having a badass machine shop
Made in America by Americans, such a refreshing sight to see!
Living the American dream.  God bless you Guys!!!
Sometimes ya just gotta bog deep and let er eat!!  Just realized this place was about and hour and 15 minutes away from where I live.
Oh aye brother only thing you are missing now is to own a drag strip.... bradenton motorsports perhaps?? Who knows, anyway i can probably speak for everyone who is subscribed by sayin a big congratulations to you and james aka the nitrous whisper and we eish you every success. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
That's what im talking about ole Cleeter!!!! Honestly... i hate to say it but, i cant help but think Cooper has seriously regrets about leaving the team. They have absolutely blown up since he left.
Awesome..  Congratulations.  I can't breathe because the smoke..
Y'all hiring? I've been a machinist in New England for 7 years and just wanna move somewhere to enjoy some freedom. 😆
Just like hair club for men. Cleeter is not only an owner he’s is also a customer. My man is making moves and taking his boys with him. Cleeter tested and approved.
my gmc envoy 4.2 identifies as a racecar... you got parts for it? :P
Motion race works circle track parts for sbc and gbodys that would be awesome
Congrats on this big step. This is gonna take you guys to a whole other level!!!🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
This wasn't the move I expect but turns out to be so much cooler that what I thought!
this is awesome man! well, I know where I'll be buying my future performance parts💯 it's cool to be a part of this channel💯
Dude. Huge congratulations on this move. This will be something that remains forever. Keep this name going forever. Proud of the team so much !!!!!! Let’s goooooooo
Congrats guys this is amazing news!!!
I don't understand how someone doesn't like your videos
Thats why you have a big sticker on mullet from them 🤣 Couple vids back “help us pay for the racetrack renovations” now “we bought 20% off automotive “ 😒hypocrite much ? Maybe give back to the once’s you helped out 🤷🏼‍♂️
I hope James has some skin in the game.
Diversifying. Smart man. Or shall I say men. Good move!
Wow, ok how many people think Cooper is kicking himself every day for splitting up from the cleetus crew?  Myself I wish I knew what really went down for that to happen. They seem to get along great then came the notice Cooper was leaving.  Cooper was treated more as an employee where as James now seems to be treated as a co owner. Am I wrong feeling like this?
Motion Raceworks = Cleetus Tested Tough!
I figured once the sticker was huge on the el co 😂
Thought you were going to buy the drag strip next door to the freedom factory.
Cleetus from motion raceworks kinda has a nice ring to it
Coop back home watching this punching the air
Pretty sure...Fan certified... ⚙🪂 Nothin more MuriCAN than this right here !!! 😁🦾🦅
Best news I have heard all day! Congrats to all involved (especially to us for the content we are yet to receive!)
Nice!!
Who ever the F@%# disliked this video...you have no life🤣  Thumbs up from Cape Town South Africa, keep them content coming Cleet. I'd love me a Mcfarland Raceworks turbskie
Real happy to see an American Business employing Americans.
I thought he was going to say they were moving to Austin...
With a burnout like that you would make warbird jealous. This was a great decision, congratulations!
All I can say is if the R&D is done by cleetus and james you best believe your getting top notch tried and tested all American car parts
Hell yeah brothers! Congrats
TBH, im surprised you didnt buy a mill/lathe already
Congrats guys!
Come on guy u made this deal for part discounts lol jk love to see this deal
Dammmmm hell yeah brother . Really proud you guys can’t wait to meet y’all someday
Not gonna lie, I was curious why you  put two freaking big Motion stickers on Mullet.
*Cleetus causes Motions first recordable injury of the year by tossing 25lbs or billet to Lucas…*
Congratulations!
Hell yeah brother .. making moves
So cool to see this grow. Can’t wait for more
Hell yeah brother!
Poor coop, he should of stayed aboard
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!
Congrats on not just wanting to be youtube rich.  You guys have made moves, and you are moving up in the racing world.  keep it up!
Motion is involved, i like 👏
HELL YEA BROTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cleetus your packaging skills are Amazon level. You gotta step up your game man!
8:31 - "... squirtin' shit" - Is that an official duty that Jack-Stand performs?
Now the irony in Kevin and Cleetus talking about the motion raceworks sticker on mullet yesterday is very clear🤣
Captions is still in 2020 ...
To all yall thinking this was a baby announcement, in the next vid, Cleet Jr. will be CNC'd from pure Billet Bald Eage titanium
I genuinely thought Cleetus was going to announce that he was a dad.
Should have put OH SHIT on the parachute handle, because if your going fast enough to use it it really is the Oh Shit handle.
Congrats ! MADE IN AMERICA
Hell yeah brother 🤙🏼🇺🇸
Living the American dream.....
Congrats guys!
Freaken do it for Dale brother
hell ya brother! what a adventure you're getting into!
HELL YEAH BROTHER!
"can we get a video of James just like squirtin shit"🤣
Hell. Yeah. BROTHER!!!!
Congrats Cleat and James!!!
So cool! And even in my home state.
Welp here’s my sign to buy a motion raceworks steering wheel
Turbo manifold for crown Vic
That guy looks like Seth Rogan!
Peep that haas logo on that machine
Hell yea brother, congrats dude 🇺🇸😄🎉🎉
Wait, who's sponsored by who now?
Hence the “free” advertisement on Mulllet!  It’s all making sense now! 😆 Congratulations!
Congratulations hell yeah boys
Doing big things congratulations
Congrats guys!! ....but what about the baby?!! LOL
UNLIMITED POWER
Wow! I didn't know Seth Rogan knew his way around a machine shop! Congratulations guys!
Welding at 14:55 had me rollin
I woke up too late
Didnt see this one coming !!!!!!! Congratulations guys!!!
Huge Congrats to you both!
Damnit Cleetus and co. You're a better example to my boys than I am  😆 wish I could support motion raceworks with my custom but I'm guessing there isn't an $800 Honda Shitbox section in their catalogue. Good luck with your new venture..
With Boostedboiz hitting a million and you joining up with Motion Raceworks it has been an amazing couple days! Also that Tig display was the funniest thing had me hootin and hollerin.
We will probably be talking about it more.... obviously it's in your contract
Jackstand looks like a 13 year old boy that has just walked into Hooters for the first time
That's awesome guys ! I wish Y'all were buyin Tom Baileys 1.0 though!!! Lol
Are we going to see a Motion Raceworks warehouse in Florida now too?
Yesterday, Kevin asked how much did motion pay for the stickers on mullet......cleet paid them!
You magnificent bastards
It never dawned on me until today that the “Motion” 40 minutes from my home are THE Motion Raceworks. Congrats to all involved🦅🇺🇸 Cleet, you continue to make life changing moves. The racing world has nothing but respect for you
dam this gave me chills
Business giraffe?
This is the anti-sellout. Investing in American innovation and industry, partnering with the best in the business, and that's reciprocal as Garrett and his team is the best at what they do and likewise for Doug and co.   Incredible stuff. Going to buy calls on Alcoa and other aluminum suppliers...
So awesome watching you and James making moves!
Going back years with vlogs coming out of the house garage shoving stuff up his exhaust to where you are now and what you've built for your future is absolutely awesome, such a good drive. Hope all the best for you both.
HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!!!!
Congrats brotherrrrr!
You got to do some jackstan covers. As well
Hoping the EPA woman leaves everyone alone. But if we be Outlaws then let it be millions of Hotrod Outlaws! God Bless All!!!
Can we get a green one
Looking at doing some work to an old 96 dakota I have, aftermarket performance parts aren’t easy to find, I’d love to see some more R&D in that area
So happy for you both!! I know James will get his own Nitrous bottle company in the near future. Congratulations and Hell Yeah Brothers
💯🔥🤟🏼
Hell Yeahh BRotherrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Great work guys! True testament to the American dream!
I feel like I felt something like this comming!!!!!!!!!!! Motion race works babyyyy
Holy cow, cleetus and crew are making it big time now! Hell yea brother!!!!!!
Awesome news guys! Super excited to see where this goes. One question... Can we get some parts and support for other engine platforms? There is no denying that Modern LS, LT, and Coyote platforms are far superior in performance and durability when compared to older model power plants. But there is a huge market there with the bygone engines as well for guys building old school stuff. I'd love to put some Motion parts on my Pontiac 400 or 455. Obviously this creates a lot of logistical problems and the LS market is insanely huge. Keep up the good work!
Hell yeah brother
I predict that within 10 years Cleetus wiil have a net worth over $300 MILLION!!!
“To infinity and beyond”.
Very glad I didn’t have to wait to see this video!
EVERY THING THAT DAY SOLD OUT QUICKLY FROM THAT DAY NO ONE NEW WHY SOME SAY GETING A PART FROM A Giraffe IS GOOD LUCK. ALSO THINGS TO MAKE Giraffe JACK STAND Giraffe TURBO Giraffe SPOTED FREEDOM  ENGINE  HEADS
Strong move! “Insert eagle screech here”
Congrats yall
So happy for you guys, really liking "Made in America!!"
The first 4 minutes should be the commercial
suddenly a lot of things are making sense. The regale being around for so long, doug bringing his nova around for cleetus and cars
Congratulations!
Holy hell man. I remember stumbling on this channel when you first started. To see this type of growth to your channel and brand is amazing. hats off to ole cleeter
I would love to come work with you guys! I have a skill set that would fit in perfectly and I would also share my patent ideas if you were interested in developing and producing them to add to the product line.
Imagine if they add a printing section to the company lmao, make all there motion and cleet merch snd do a lot of local stuff
LETS FREAKING GO!!!!!!!
new phrase should be “Do it with Doug”
Question. Will they start making blower parts?
Very cool!
When does the motion/cleetus mashup merch come out
No frickin way!! Wow dude congrats!!!
Awesome 😎 hey one question from the start of the video ....would that be a tip out instead of a tip in ??
The best in the game hands down !!!
Mcfarland Fab comes to life...
You had me at MADE IN USA! 🇺🇸
So glad this wasn’t an announcement they are going to a TV channel. Congrats
It would be nice to see a collapsible version of the steering columns, so you don't have to worry about being impaled in an accident.  Usually this is done by cutting a checkerboard pattern of holes in the column, so it deforms uniformly, then using a double D collapsible shaft or a collapsible spline.
Great video!!  👏👏💪💪  CONGRATULATIONS on the merge!!  And all the best to all if you.   Hope I can make the drive north sometime - maybe you all can give me a tour.
Wonder how this will affect the Holley and Summit sponsorships
I swear cleetus is always thinking hmmm I could do a burn out rn. Because he is always doing a burnout at some point
Motion race works is located maybe 20 minutes from me.
Back on them big jobs🤘
Cleetus the business man!
It’s like that time the plant manager came to work drunk 🥴
You should do a parachute handle with  LETER RIPP!!    Congrats guys
Brother not gonna lie you had me worried for a second there thought you might go all roadkill bullshit monthly subscription on us !!! So happy that that’s not the case ! Big moves for a big man !
I was hoping for a Mt. Dew endorsement and a busch light endorsement for jack stand Jimmy but this works too
Looks like the old rally Camaro is going to see some Motion products in the near future!  Good work fellas!
Gotta say that I am underwhelmed by this announcement, I had hoped it was that you were starting a weekly race program at the FF .
Holy shit... Hell fucking yeah guys!!!!!!!
Now THERE'S a shed skid!
I wouldn't worry about just branding parts, just because it has a different badge on it, doesn't make it any different then anyone else. if motion race works is designing and manufacturing, they might aswell just put their name on it. and call it a day. what's the fun in buying the same part as many already make? should check out the car audio community, that's full of rebranded stuff mostly made by 1 manufacturer. if you yourself are not bringing anything revolutionary to the table, it's kinda pointless.
Lucas reminds me of a shorter Seth Rogen.
The American dream is alive. Cleetus you started as a teenager working with 1320 and now here you are. Inspiring to us all that the American dream is still out there and you just need to put in hard work to achieve it.
Hell f’n yeah brother
Hell yeah brother way to go congratulations to you and Jack stand you guys are doing amazing things
5 years these guys are the next hendrix/ Penske race team !  With style ! Calling it now !
awesomeness get shipping discount to big island? lol
If your not making money while your sleeping you ain't living brother 🤟 setting up the future for the next generation 💯
Deep breath*  "Yepp..."  🤣🤣🤣
🤘
Let them bald eagles free son!!!! Hope you are making Ford parts plz plz plz plz I’m about to start building a bad ass f150!!!
Save your money
Here me out what if you got a helicopter to hover over the car while your burning out
Eagle head shift levers
Congratulations!!! Keep kicking ass man.
This has made my day happy as for yous
😃
As a network engineer. I approve of this message.
The intro made me laugh and wanna cry at the same time!!   I'm glad I've been apart of this community for over 3 years now! 💪💪💪
Congratulations brother this is huge🙏
Y’all should definitely sponsor the haas f1 team just imagineeee
So frickin cool. Cleeters and jack stand are doing big things boys
Sorry cooper.
As someone who was inspired by you all to buy my own crown Vic, and as you all have a massive fleet of vics, please look into making stuff for them! Motion raceworks already has stuff for the ford 4.6 too!
Haha I guessed right, great move mate
He'll be a host on shark tank before we know it.
Ford parts: Nevermind!
Nice job guys!!!  Here's to your successful future with MotionRaceworks!  May you fly with the Eagles!!  Much respect.
Very risky doing business with friends
Congrats!! If y'all need a machinist I'll gladly come help. Just pay me in car parts LOL
Congrats guys.  The best You Tube channel is getting bigger and better.  This so amazing.  Cant wait for more of the future.  You all prove hard work and dedication will make dreams come true.   🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🦅
...'Murica
that explains the massive motion raceworks stickers on mullet, haha
Cleet... Import. Please. Not a LS guy, cant afford it.
Lz buys a 50 acre compound, cleetus buys a large stake in a company. The boys are getting after it 🔥
Congratulations fellas. That’s super awesome. 👍🏻👍🏻
I am waiting for the video that announces Cleetus is buying 20% of GM! Guess all his investments are paying off well.
He forgot to tell us how much horses the freedom addition adds!!
So McFarland Machining and Fab merged with Motion Raceworks?! Sounds like a solid partnership.
Congratulations. You make some of the best content on YouTube. Anytime I show anyone your channel I always describe it as "any car guy's dream." Keep up the great work and keep on motivating us all to follow our dreams.   Hell yeah brother
HELL YEAH BROTHER! that's bad friggin ass man 🤘 congrats!
Can we get a Cleetus and Cars in Iowa now?  please... 😁
Just ordered all your parts! Lol
Next up, cleetus buys haas f1 team.
we take this, we put it in that, that makes this which goes into here... Science
I'm so freaking pumped brother let's go!!!!! Congratulations!!!!
Boostedboiz soon too release their branded Gatorade catch cans!!
Aye cleet I sent you a email talking bout north star engine parts 👀😁
The Next Day Motion Race works  has a for sale sign up..  lol
Woooooohoooooooo it’s just getting started y’all!!!!!
Yeah changing the parts the easy part, it’s all the programming and cad design plus building and machining the fixtures that’s the amazing part of machining! I know James has the ability and mental know how to have been a amazing machinist had he wanted to be for sure
I admit when I'm wrong ... and yesterdays comment about the Motion Raceworks decals was wrong. That said, could I get partial credit for being in the ballpark? P.S. I know giving parts away for free is not how to secure your future, but I really think there is a Camaro out there that should defiantly get a complementary "Hell Yeah Brother" parachute lever. Just sayin'
Awesome! Congratulations. It's a dream realized. I'm excited for you guys.
Congrats. Now James just needs his own channel to make it all complete.
would have been hilarious if Cleetus had tried to exhale into that CO2 tank to pre-fill it for a customer! Congrats guys! Glad to see that you are thinking about the future!
THAT MACHINE SHOP... i wish i worked in a shop that nice. As a machinist i need this
Congrats 🎊
This is awesome!! But I feel like eventually we'll see Cleetus buy a NASCAR team lol 🦅🇺🇸
Motion Raceworks drift angle kits when?
Of all the guesses and speculation... Did not see this coming 😳 Congratulations!
And everyone was running around panicking crying "motortrend, oh no they're going to motortrend" with their poop chute puckered so tight they gotta waddle like a duck. Anywho, proud to see how much growth you guys have accomplished. Since watching the lsa supercharger build in Leroy to owning not only a racetrack but now partners on an established manufacturing company
Help a brother out,Buy a Ammo Company
Dude hell yea brother !!! Big moves !!!
Nothing but potential from that deal.  Well done.
Congratulations Garrett & James from the land down under! 🇦🇺🦘 What a massive year so far for you in particular Garrett... an engagement, new business partnership, new drag car, plus The Freedom Factory.... and its only half way through the year! So happy for you guys and your families and excited too watch what the future holds!  "Thats a big Fire Me Up!"
Not bad, y'know, for a college drop-out ;) :D
Welcome to Iowa, Cleetus. Looks like a great company to be working with.
McFarland racing and motion race works same initials why didn’t I see it coming
Is "we" you or you and James?
Thats whats im talking about made in the usa word we barely hear anymore.
You have got to learn how to spell CLEETUS with tire rubber
I thought they were going to buy a state.  Or a country.  Haha
Congrats guys on the move you guys deserve it !!!!!
Big tig weld guy
I love that you put Motion Raceworks on Mullet.  That was a good way to get it out there.
Yea buddy! 🦅
Cleetus rocked the internet when he bought a racetrack, then the toter car hauling unit now motion raceworks owners. What will we see next i cant wait. Congrats to all your success now and in the future. Ill be here watching. James you are one hell of a mechanic brother.
Whoot!!! Murica!!!!! Get yourself some MotionRaceWorks!!!! So great to watch you fellas keep growing your brands and growing the fans!
Well hell yeah!
Congratulations brother!!!!! 🤘🏼 🦅
I have the same exact fork truck as them they could be twins mine is just as trashed But it never fails
Congrats! I'm sure he is, but all I can think is - I hope James is getting PAID PAID. Awesome move guys.
Cleetus has them alien eyes towards the end of the video.
Hell yeah. Congrats guy's 👏 👏🤘
Congratulations guys!  No words to speak about the success and positivity Cleetus McFarland brands is achieving!
I thought for sure Cleet was buying Bradenton Motorsports Park!
Great to see you invest in a great company here in my home state of Iowa!  Hopeing they start some development on 2011 and up Dodge parts!
So happy for you guys - for some reason this video made me a little emotional. You're living the dream, brother. And we are living it vicariously through you. That's a bummer there's no hemi parts at Motion Raceworks, though... not gonna lie.
I want to congratulate all of you guys! Also wow never saw this coming! Glad for all you guys keep up the great work all of you!
So does this mean that you now sponsor yourself since you own a quarter of the company
All those CNC machines but Haas still can't perform in formula one.
BILLET HONDA PARTS..!!!   #boostedboiz
Made in the USA still means something!!!🤙
Yaaas Cleetus turbos I am in
Cleetus is perfect frontman for these guys
After Cleet said that machine went YeeeEEEE HAAAAaaaa. It was the yeehaa machine after that. Every time I heard it my brain was like YeeeEEEHAAAaaa.
Congratulations
I really thought Cletus bought Florida.
14:55 I’m cackling haha
Congrats on this new phase of the business.  We wish you every success!
Making some serious moves! Never miss an opportunity like this.
I knew this was coming! I've been watching for years, and it's finally come to fruition. You are the most deserving YouTuber out there! You've done things that I can only imagine!! I just wish that Coop would have hung out a little bit longer. HELL YEAH BROTHER!! I'm so excited to see what's next! 👍👍👍👍✌✌✌✌👏👏👏👏
@1:42  So, that explains the rather large MotionRaceWorks logo on Mullet......
Now I just need to take out a second mortgage to afford anything from Motion
Why did he buy 20 percent instead of just advertise for them will never understand
love this i know they make a bunch of stuff for gas cars but want about diesels like they need to sell second gen manifolds and turbo and etc..
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Where's the HEMI love, not everyone runs an LS. Congrats to you and James.
Congrats guys!! Awesome content ahead.
What dreams are made of! Congrats guys can’t wait to see what’s in store for the future! Here’s a  Hell yeah brother to that!
every time I heard you say "foxbody" I couldn't but think "sponsor me" LOL
This really ups the stakes on the government threatening to ruin racing with environmental regulatory BS.
Famous last words I got this lol 😂
Longest infomercial I've ever watched
Can I get a big hell yeah brother
Cleeter said fuck a sponsorship, I’ll just buy ya out.
More power baby
Burn outs for years to come. Sounds good to me.
Sweet beans! Chuffed for you both, a great move; best of luck!
CAN WE GET A HELL YEAH BROTHER 🤘🏼🦅
Hell yeah, Congrats bros!  Can’t wait to see what else the future holds!
Hell yeah bois wicket to hear

In the beginning I thought you were talking about texas speed
this is so much more then expected, hell yeah brother!
I was so scared at the beginning of the video that you were going to say James is leaving to go work at Motion to help develop parts specifically for Freedom Factory stuff. Congratulations on the expansion you guys!
Everything you need... unless your a mopar owner lmfao
As a CNC machine shop owner and car enthusiast, I say congrats to you, and hang on. It's a wild ride.
Sweeet! 🤩
Best haas machines going..
LETS GO MY GUY
Congratulations  cleetus and James build you'll s brands as a team .

Man, I'm way behind in life!  Congrats to all.
This is awesome man. Happy for you and excited to see your continue to move forward!
Giraffe tested, dog approved
Congrats! Yall really doing it for dale!
Here's a comment to people promote the video.
So proud of these guys good to see that there work is paying off
Any company with Boxers in the building, is a solid company to me
Man Cleetus make a disabled mans life and you guys work on my truck so it will have.power to do burn out and smoking doughnuts you would make my life lite up bro love what you do
“Can I stare at it”? 😂

Congratulations!
Radical and awesome move guys...✨👍  Didn't see it coming...👀 Good luck in this new venture...🏁 Damn proud of ya'll...🏆 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Doing it for MURICA...🇺🇲  Should have worn the lab coats in the video...😅👍
📈📈📈 Motion Raceworks stonks to the MOON!!!! 📈📈📈
Engineer motion race work  rims for drag racing .
I admit I was a bit scared with yesterdays video.  Was he going to put up a paywall for certain content?  Get some big sponsor that would limit what he could build/make.  Nope. He invests his money from his channel into a company that builds parts that support what he does... That deserves a "HELL YA BROTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Cleeter.. you honestly NEVER cease to amaze me. Seems like every vid he just keeps turning the quality, the honesty, and the energy up. Hell yeah
Congratulations!!!!
Hell Yeah Brother
Really good job to all of you that's put in work for this channel and it's not just y'all it's also been y'all's collaborations and the way you've helped their channels and they've helped yours you have done an amazing thing here all of y'all just keep up y'all's work y'all been grinding real hard getting everything going y'all just keep doing what y'all are doing
When are we gonna hear Donnie run
We all know this place will be to small in a couple of months.
The official and complete American dream brother. From race car to track,and now parts manufacturer wow!!.
What do I want to order from Motion Raceworks? Stocks.
Steeeep prices but definitely maybe! lol
The Cleetus logo is way too big on the valve covers. Sell freedom, not Cleetus.
Congrats guys!! 👏🏻  I've watched every video for the last 4 years & it's been great to watch your journey! Been watching ever since I saw you in @Dankwheelie video.
"Can we get a video... of james just squirting shit"   lmao
Living the dream!!!!!!! So awesome. Congrats to all involved.
You can write off blown engines as R&D on your taxes now!
Nice Move bro! Hey do they also ship to Europe????
Congrats! thats huge news
Hey brother y’all making hemi parts ? Or just LS stuff? Congratulations Cleetus!!! I been watching you since the very beginning with your rental home and the the c7 it’s hard to believe where you are now !!!
Do they offer the parachute handle in blue?
Now it makes sense that mullet has that billboard Motion Raceworks on the side of it.
Sweet! Happy for yall. Also glad to see the VGG collaboration. Surely more great content ahead. Thanks
Ole Cleetus Partnering with the Iowa boys!! Hell yeah
those vacuum sealers are great, until you need to get the parts out...lol.
Sooo sick Guys!!!
You forgot to mention the second to non customer service!
Nice!  Good to see an American company grow!
Congratulations McFarland engineering 🔥🔥🔥
Congrats! Making it happen!
Those valve covers are sick! Need some for my gen 3 hemi😁
Does this mean Motion Raceworks is now an arm of McFarland Fabrications? Hahahaha. Congrats guys, that's a huge move. As a runner of Dorito engines I don't think they make anything for me, but really cool none the less.
Kind of explains the BIG ASS sticker on the side of Mullet  LOL  hehe
This is so awesome! Congratulations boys this is a huge move for you guys and the furthering of this incredibly awesome channel!!!
Yeeeeeeee yeeeeeeeee soo freakin proud of you brother
A BIG HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!!!!
SUPER FUCKING STOKED FOR YOU CLEET KEEP IT GOING BROTHERRRR
It’s still unbelievable to me that cleetus hasn’t gotten sponsored by Mountain Dew yet like what the fuck he’s perfect for them
Live in Europe, but feel a bit American since I subscribed to this channel... Wierd. Also, this channel made my opinion about American people a lot more positive! +1
Glad to see this !!!! But I thought you were gonna say texas speed
MADE IN THE USA!
And to think: I came here because some guy bought a red auction Corvette with a truck motor in it. And now? Cleetus basically has his own empire!  I'll probably never own another hot rod; heck, probably won't even get to drive one again. But I can at least get close to it here! Congrats, Mr Cleet, wish y'all all the best!
Hell yah brother!
Damn, got the cars, the track, the house, the best companionship money can't buy and now part ownership in a successful parts manufacturer? The man has single handedly become the American dream. Congrats.
That is awesome. Happy for ya. Now do a compound turbo on something please.
Love the channel been watching since you got Leroy and discovered the nameplate I find so much joy in watching you guys continue to push the limits congratulations guys
Never met any of you yet I'm as proud of you guys as I was of my daughter singinf a solo in a huge concert in school....  Maybe I'm a terrible father...
Did I just get tricked into watching a half hour commercial about car parts? No regrets.
Hell yeah brother!!! I love it
well done guys cant wait to see your steering wheel i want one for my build
I’m all about this move
That was Badass! Merica 🇺🇸🤘
More dodge ram parts 3rd gen 💯

Sponsored by Haas F1 Team
Looks like I need some valve covers lol
Now I need to buy an LS car
Cleetus is starting an OnlyFans
Seth Rogans twin brother over here working under cover
I had no idea motion raceworks was here in Iowa!  No wonder why they are the best
That burnout make me giggle and brought a tear to my eye, well done brother
Better than I thought, but not Compound level huge. You guys going to expand into import stuff?
new heights thats what its all bout faster and stronger everyday
Hell Yeah Brother!
The Month of Freedom is brought to you by the Northern Idaho Tourism Coalition to Bring Motion Raceworks Cleetus and Jackstand to beautiful Coeur d’Alene Idaho!! And BRING THE BOATS OUR MOTTO: if you come, we’ll change the name to Motion Ocean
Man I really want to watch this at work but. I really should be sitting for this...
Maybe you guys should make the Cleetus  flags red white and blue
START MAKING PARTS FOR THE HEMI ENGINES. YOU WILL KILL IT WITH SALES.
Absolutely unbelievable!! Major congratulations to you guys! Hell yea brother!
Mcfarland Fab moves to the next level! Good luck guy's!
F1 Team HAAS!!!
" Oh it's Ford parts, nevermind " - Cleetus 2021
Hell yeah brother
"Chip girls"... more like chip n dale rescue rangers ...
God I love the fact that I’ve been here since the beginning of Leroy and I tear up sometimes watching ur progress
Please for the love of GOD start producing some parts for Coyotes and Ford fans. I have a love for LS engines as well but the coyote needs some love in the aftermarket parts scheme.
Hell YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LET THEM EAGLES FLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
awesome!!!
That's awesome news Cleetuss. Wishing you guys the best
So so happy for you buddy all the way from London!!
Hell yeah
Iowa represent!
I'm really happy to hear this! When you said there would be a big announcement today, I was concerned that a big brand, like Summit, or something, had bought into your brand, which never goes well. This is really cool news!
If anything I build needs a part and Motion Raceworks supplies it you can bet your bald eagles I’ll buy it from them🤟🏻🇺🇸
UPGRADESSSSSSSSSSS
I'm still in the beginning of the video, at the start of the burn-out to be exact, but i gotta say big respect to you guys and what you've build in this past few years is amazing!! And it is well deserved and i am really happy for you guys and your family's and friends, who will all benefit from this, that's the amazing thing you have build here old Cleet! Nice job!! Much love and respect from Peter from the Netherlands. Lets Go!!!!!!!!!!
Unreal boys.... jack stand is the man
Congratulations👍👍
So this means you get 20% OFF by default 🤔 😁🇺🇲
Feels like Tegridy Farms
That explains the giant sticker on the El Camino, not complaining but I knew it wasn’t random.
This is gonna be dope i hope yall produce ls parts like mad testing and tuning
Upsided headers with rain caps is the way to go
The giant Motion Raceworks stickers on the side of Mullet make more sense now. I wonder if Kevin knew when he said something about them?
Congrats to you all! Lots of hard work paying off for sure!
Congrats
Fire me up
Hell yeah brotha!!! This is great!!
Cleet you have to find out how big the largest American Flag is and get one bigger of the Freedom Factory just seems fitting 💪🏼🇺🇸
Congratulations, You guys need red, white, and blue colors for freedom..
So the big annoncement was a 32 minutes ad? I'm happy for you but a litle disapointed content wise.
Congrats, you now have a race track, and a race car parts company.  You just need to buy out that old drag strip next to you oval track and name the whole place Cleetus World, Happiest place on four wheels... just two hours from Disney World. :) lol
Best Part is MADE IN USA 💪
Congratulations from Canada 🇨🇦
my dream job is use these cnc things  :D
As a CNC machinist myself primarily mills I'm sorry you guys have haas machines. They are what im stuck with. Blew up 2 power supplies so far this year. I get it they are made in the USA but the DMG MORI are significantly better. Best machines I've ever had the pleasure of using. Our haas machines spend more time down then getting ran.
For no reason whatsoever, this video is hilarious
How about beefier turbos for a 3.5 EcoBoost ford, and catch can.
This man is a marketing genius. Holy crap.
This makes the giant motion race works sticker on the El Camino make more sense 🤣
Guy why there is so much hate to cooper
Wouldn't have guessed. Dude. I'm excited! If y'all can make any 2006 Chrysler 3.5L parts, I'd even modify my highway cruiser with your parts!
American made... with Chinese steel :D
Very Good fine Sir!  Congratulations on ownership!
Take my money!!
McFarland Fab just went Pro
It seems that you should invest in a tire factory as well!
Fire me up!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
😂🤣🤘🏼🤘🏼 hell yeah!! That’s awesome. In one of your previous videos you made a big deal out of the huge motion raceworks sticker on the elcamino. Haha
Wow...  when I saw the motion on the side of the car, I had a weird feeling about this..
CONGRATULATIONS! HOOAH!♥️♥️
Great, now every video will be sponsored by MRW...
Motion raceworks! 20 mins from my front door! Nice!!
What happened to Cooper
Anyway i can help lmk. Ill invest
Kind of underwhelming. This was overhyped 😂
I’m assuming the epa throttled back on their ambitious legislation.
Took to the camera like a champ and haven't looked back, one day my son and I will make to the Freedom Factory and shall bask in all its glory.
I think others are thinking this too...Cooper jumped ship too fast.
Nice burnout! Was nice to hear the engine roar instead of always bouncing off a rev limiter👍🏻
HELL YEAH BROTHER turbo blankets
Outstanding
now THAT is a FLEX!!!!!
Congratulations.
Investment in security of the future is always a solid move. And when it's something you love It's like never working a day. Very intelligent move guys
Smart man planning for the long game.
Please Cleetus, buy Sweden and make it better!!
I was just about to spend around $2,300 at summit and found everything I needed and then some for $2,000 this is awesome I’ve been sleeping on Motion race works 🇺🇸 🤷🏻‍♂️
Congrats!!!!!
Damn Id put those valve covers on my stock 6.0 in my work truck just to say I have them 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
PLEASE make a MTN DEW catch can!
LOVE it when Cleet puts his glasses on and you hear the eagle lol.
So happy for you guys!! Means a lot because I am a CNC Machinist.
McFarland Fab was just a joke at first at the shop now look at them!! Big moves big moves congrats
UNBELIEVABLE PROUD OF YOU BOYS. KUDOS, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA 🇺🇸
Congrats, this is one heck of a move! Wish you guys ALL the best! Hellyeah!  And looking back at the last months, I kinda noticed that the guys from MotionRaceworks started featuring more and more in the videos and that you guys seemed to get closer and closer, so I guess we could've seen something like this coming :D  Also, my first suggestion for the parts: Don't just offer them in blue or black, but also red or white, so that we can have red, white and blue engine bays and stuff :D
Way to go Cleeter and Jackstand
That shop is a dream
Ive followed Doug since one of those raceweeks as he is just a gd nice fellah. If i had one guy to pick to partner with professionally or race with: It'd be him.
Wow. I caught a "shit" in there.
Congratulations Cleetus, James and everyone working at Motion RaceWorks, this made me smile all the way through, I’m retired now but the best job I ever had was managing a machine shop, there is no better feeling than seeing a lump of metal being turned into a component for a living, breathing machine that in turn delivers big smiles made by a super skilled team. Good luck to you all.
Congratulations Guys. Your sheer exuberance and thrive to succeed in everything you guys is so addictive. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for you guys in your business ventures and your own race shop at the Freedom Factory. Congratulations again and now let’s get to the live action! HELL YEAH BROTHER!
Well Motion is going to absolutely blow up even more now. Awesome company and I love running their products!
I need cleeter clamps and  a couple of jackstand's... well jackstands
you buying part of motion race works will also allow them to make new parts. but that said happy for you man. and lets see them bring over the cars to torture test their parts at the freedom factory ;)
Congrats brother. I look forward to many many years of watching the channel
Falk yeah bro....God has set forth your trail and you guys a blazing down it. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💯

Proud of ya'll!! Congrats and on to many more burnouts!!  🇺🇸  -Murph
cleetus making money the right way. hard work. thankyou for not leaving youtube SIRs.
That was a rollercoaster dude... From Tugging at the heartstrings at the beginning to comments like "science" and "yeeeee haw" at Motion...love it. You know how to make it real my friend...thats why i keep comming back. ;)
Wait what.... they are out for DeWitt IA that is like a suburb of my home town PS they need to do a Cleetus and Cars at Cordova Raceway
Congrats yall. That's awesome.
Sweet
Need to work with PFI speed and develop an import side to Motion.  Low hanging fruit for some much needed parts for the J series Honda... if it makes you feel better... The J-series engine was designed in the United States by Honda engineers. It is built at Honda's Anna, Ohio, and Lincoln, Alabama, engine plants
Motion Race Works retail outlet @ the Freedom Factory
That big move is a unit. No doubt
Favorite part “can we get a shot of James just like squirting shit” ~cleetus 2021
My anodized billet LS valve covers came in a few days ago on the 27th, they’re freaking awesome! They even sent me some goodies in the package, can’t say enough good stuff about Motion Raceworks, even more now that you’re on their team! I have a few pictures of them on my insta @vbskiddles 😁
Looked up the trans cooler as soon as I saw you mention it. Ordering asap
That bin was a scrapper's paradise.
My boy makin big moves!!!!  Congrats buddy!!
Wow congrats you guys..makin moves!    Next up partial ownership in texas speed lol!
Dood is pumped about the vacuum sealer.  Lol.
Proud of you guys giving back to the community and to those who made it all happen
Hell yeah brother. Look g forward to buyi g parts from yall when I LS swap my Jeep
Well done Brothers!!!
Called it
Holy shit, you're living youre best life and I'm jealous as shit.
Just when you think, what else can old Cleeter do to top what he's already up to, he goes and releases this!  Huge congrats to you, James and the whole crew man, mad respect! 👍👏
James needs a logo
Does motion make intake elbows that bolt to 4150 and 4500 intake manifolds?
4:21 ..... is that a haas logo i see?
I can't imagine doing that in France .... Put a french flag, on a french car, doing car parts saying out loud "it's made in FRANCE!". People we call you a rascit , fascist, and all kind of nice words.
lol you know you're a fan when you wait to go through the comments to not spoil the surprise
Between your Golden Retrievers and their Boxers you have the perfect 4-legged order fulfillment crew.
Hell's yea brother! This is kick ass!!  Constantly stepping it up. That's Merica!
Boss moves.
You all, matt from demo ranch, evan and the BRCC crew all demonstrate what American freedom is all about
dang son! And tell me why cooper didnt want to stay around again?
CLEETUS SWITCH PANEL!!! you know " bald eagle" switch "do it for dale" switch maybe even a HOLY TOLEDO switch!
Congratulations 👏..Freedom!
Huge congrats to you guys! Watching you for years and seeing where you are now almost brought a tear to my eye!
So excited !
Big move he says... bruh that’s a huge move. Congrats!!
"Why you have so much loctite?" You can NEVER have too much loctite at your disposal. Those small bottles are just awful on big applications like a sheet of vinyl, leather or whatever. I'm sure there are special adhesives for every material but loctite is just good for every material to adhere on any other material and adheres quick so if you just wanna slap something together. Loctite.
James is that friend everyone wish they had
Man, doin Neighbor dirty with those Coyote parts. LOL.
Congratulations Cleet!
How bad is y’all’s tinnitus? 😂
Y’all should get Murder Nova to be you’re John Force Loud AF salesperson. He’s fast AF on the streets. NPK would be a great place to advertise too. I bet he’d test a couple parts that would make both you & Jackstand say DAYUUM! How’d he do that? 😲😂 👍🇺🇸💯
Do they recycle the metal shavings
Chinese aluminum, machined in America.
hell yeah brother
Man. Those elbows. If any part needed to be an additive process like 3D metal printing. That is it.
Well done guys!! This is awesome!! enjoy the ride
The month of freedom has now turned into the life of freedom
Cleet really does not like wearing welding gloves, congratulations guys, this is such a awesome move for you guys.
Harley parts... I searched and didn't see anything for my bike on the website. "hell yeah brother" clutch handle? "fire me up" air breather/cover? Just putting that out there. A feller might want to jazz his bike up too.
Let’s freaking Gooooo!!!!  Cleeter and Jackstand doing bog things. Started from the bottom now we here 🤘🏻🤘🏻🔥🔥🔥💪🏻💪🏻
Doug: Alright Cleet you've spent about 500k on parts in the last year, you trying to just come on board and streamline this whole process?   Cleet: Well hell yeah brother, fire me up!
This shits getting better and better!
Hell yeah brother! This is a great move for you and Jackstand. Much success Cleeter!
You could tour businesses and do videos on that and I’d watch it. It’s just entertaining! 😂
Hell yea brother!!!!
Congrats, obviously Motion Raceworks was feeling threaten by McFarland Fabrication and needed to join forces to stay on top of their game.
Now go and sponsor or boy Taylor Ray! 🤯
It was just the stinky fart I ripped that stunk like motortrend....thank goodness....great move guys! All the best!
As a machinist and a car guy I kinda want to move to Iowa. Motion, you guys hiring? Haha! Haas for the win!
"Jackstand Jimmy" branded tools. It needs to happen. Nothing to try and compete with the big guys. Instead, specialty stuff that you can't find anywhere else.
Hell Yeah Brother!!! Congratulations to the whole Crew!! Y'all busted your asses to get where you are!! Anything worth having is never cheap. #DoItForDale !!
Cleetur McSkeeter Race Car Parts!?!?!? Hell YEAH
I got goosebumps when cleeter started talking at the beginning bc I’ve watched these guys make this channel what it is from the beginning proud of y’all. Hell Yeah Brother
I knew it for the minute you said they didn’t pay for the Livery on the El Camino Smart move diversify your income Don’t  leave it up to YouTube and race purses well done fellas I must say this is the First half hour commercial I have ever watched I love it this is such a brilliant move good on you fellas when you break a lot of parts why not buy a parts company🤘🤘🤘🤘
🔥🔥🔥🔥
You need a Jack Stand themed Nitrous Bottle that comes in a Dr. Spray Em All Nitrous Kit.
I love machining; that’s what I do here I northern Ohio. Unfortunately I’m looking for a new job with 12+ years experience.
Nice job
We're the chip girls 😂😂😂😂 I'm dying
Freaking awesome! Very happy to see this announcement! Maybe some day I will be able to afford parts from you guys lol
Wait a minute...  What happened to aisle B??
Had me at Made In The USA!
I'm very proud of you guys congrats...
This is awesome. Does this have anything to do with Derek  at VGG using motion racework stuff  lately?
Congratulations to you guys....hell yeah brother 🤘😎🤘
Hellllll ya brother
I should've known......I believe a hint was given yesterday when talking about the Motion Raceworks stickers on the Elco. Congrats guys!!!
Y'all need done Jackstand Jimmy branding on some parts!! Like if you agree!!
Great job Garrett not once did he say I always we or us he is definitely a humble person. Good luck in this next endeavor of your life.
Have you though about being a salesman? You pretty damn good at it boy.

Congratulations Cleetus and Jackstand!!
i bet your father is so proud. diversify and conquer! having all your eggs in 1 basket gets you rich quick; having a few eggs in ALL the baskets makes a legacy. hats off to you and your crew!
Idk if this was bigger than the Freedom Factory announcement 🤷‍♂️. Still pumped for the guy.
Good Mash up of my favorite companies. Will be beneficial for both Cleetus and the Motion race works team. Millions of new ad views for them and a long term permanent gig for you! Proud of ya ole Cleet.
Congratulations ol'Cleeter. it is really and truly amazing to see where you started and where you have been. let alone where you are gonna go. no matter what you have been there with absolutely amazing content to make at least my bad day good watching you and Jackstand rip in some really bad ass cars man. Keep on Keeping on with all the fun things your florida man brain thinks up. let'er rip tater chip and remember always do it for Dale!!!
The sound of a v8 with the American flag busting out of the smoke clouds. Hell yeah. It dont get much more American than that. Keep grinding bro.
Great investment! I’ve worked in automotive all my life. 30 plus years and following the stock market is one of my main side hobbies. So I get it. Good job McFarland Inc 👍 🇺🇸💯 👏👏LET’S GO! 🤘MURICA!!
James has been rocking with cleetus forever. Making content, business ideas etc. So, hopefully he got a percentage of motion raceworks.
Next up: forza horizon 5 “freedom pack” with cleetus’s cars
So happy for you guys!!!
🤘🏻🤘🏻
Sweet
Congrats everyone on this deal!! This is going to amazing for all!!
Hey co-owners of Motion Raceworks, please hurry up and make your new throttle body in other bolt patterns, like 5.0l SBF, Coyote, etc. - thanks, from the rest of the not-LS-having gearheads
I never buy merch from YouTubers. Cleet is more than that and I am buying my first piece of merch to support this amazing move you made. Congrats!
Need to do parts for 4.3 v6...there isn't any one  making them
Good for u cleet and crew. .. bald eagles..🦅🇺🇲🦅🇺🇲🤘
hahaha 8:30 can we get a video of James just like squirting shit?
MOTION RACEWORKS HAS BOXERS? ❤❤❤
Entrepreneurial stats are maxed, Welding stats need some work, Congrats on the new venture
So what is going to be the bald eagle special now lol
Awesome news guys! Congratulations on your new business endeavor. I wish you guys the best and can't wait to see what you come up with working with motion. Excited for the future of this channel! Keep up the good work guys! 🇺🇸🤘
meh if the logo was smaller the on the valve covers id rock them... not a fan of the big logo
Hell yeah!!! Great news love it!!!
From a business perspective this is a huge move for Motion raceworks... The amount of advertising they are getting out of the deal (plus the i imagine hefty paycheck) is a smart move...
NO PART OF A CHEVROLET ENGINE SHOULD BE BLUE!!! 😤😤😤
this whole video is a lengthened version of the scene in talledega nights where ricky bobby says  "Hi im ricky bobby and if you dont chew big red then fuck you" except its cleetus and motion raceworks
Way to go! Awesome partnership
Oh thank God I thought you sold out 2 holly. next thing you know Freiburger would be in there doing stupid s***. I'm going to stop worrying now since you bought the freedom Factory you've been making super awesome moves👍 keep up the good work😍
EPA just confiscates the whole company
Boring ass vid
Love seeing all the Haas machines, I run them at work myself.
Can't go wrong on the 20% when you break more parts than anyone in the world 🌎 hell yeah brother
How about a Humvee 24ft intake and exhaust!! Motion race works edition.
How much does Jack Stand have in the YouTube business?
HELL YEAH BROTHER
I'm so glad you shit canned Cooper.
Have to say I kinda cheated.  Was scrolling instagtam.saw cleeters.post saying the vid was live...then the next post in my feed was motion announcing the cleetus line of parts
CONGRATS CLEETUS on your new venture praying for you to do well YOUR BLESSED NOT LUCKY give GOD some credit even if its just a little there are a lot of Christians in your followers
8:36  Savage...😆
That was the longest paid promotion ad I’ve ever watched... lol. Hell yeah brother. 🤘🏻
Hell yeah brother !!!
Is James a share holder too?
Congratulations my dudes you guys need to release some billet Jackson's with JACKSTAND JIMMY on them with a flag design lol🤣🤣
GEN2 LT1 valve covers needed! In blue with the Cletus logo, come on and support this mullet'd community brother!!!
What humidity and air temp sensor does mullet have on it
Day 1 of getting the freedom factory on the nascar track list
YO IMMA BUY ME SOME CLEETER PARTS
Such an inspiration!!!
Hell yea brother!!!!!
Guess I’ll be using Motion Race Works when building my street truck. Only thing that won’t be MRW will be my Texas Speed engine. Bow tie rebel
Bruh, I turned on captions for the video, and as soon as Cleetus did a burn out the captions read music 😂
Prices just went up 20%
Awesome guys! Love the ideas, skills, and ambition you share with the world
Y’all diss the chips.  Those are worth serious money.  That isn’t pop can aluminum.
Make a coyote valve cover show some love to us ford guys
big move for sure. I was expecting more tho. I'm just glad ya didn't sell out to motor trend. godspeed to ya cleetus
Well hot damn guys, that is quite a big move (understatement). I think a lot of other YouTube creators and other influencers in your position might have tried to con their supposed friends into some sort of "deal" whereby they don't put any real skin in the game for co-branding and still reap much of the benefit if it works out and lose nothing but reputation if it doesn't. I think it's a credit to your character that you guys are willing to put your own money on the line and be true partners with your long-time friends and sponsors to have a deeper collaboration.
Congratulations! That's so awesome!looking forward to getting some c5 parts! Been following you since the beginning and it's great to see you continue to expand your situation.  I'm a machinist and trying to get my own shop, and have developed my own stuff...
Congratulations!
Day 13 of asking for Freedom CROCS
surprised they even get 400 products out in a factory in iowa..  that whole state moves at its own pace... slow.
Wow. That's awesome. Congratulations
I'm with Ya !!! But the Reality of the Future is !Growling Greta The Smedodent & WEF, BAALGaterz👺🐉🐙🦑🦀and Their Billionaires that Make up Trillions of Dollars & Corporatism Overreach will Do everything they Can including Brainwashing the kids that CO2 is the Climate Cancer & all that are involved in the Petroleum burning foot prints, just look what they did with a Fake Virus in 1 year Shut down the World Economy, they have given the Time line 2025-30 ! We Gonna See the Wars that Divides The Worlds People' over Plandemics & Green Crazies
Today has been incredible. Two of my favorite channels have made huge moves. Honestly I feel like I'm part of both of them. It's an amazing feelings seeing people us audience consider family become something more than just a YouTube channel. So proud of you guys. Congratulations cleet and james!!
Bigstackd looking at that pile of aluminum shavings and salivating
My dad use to be a machinist before CNC machines were accessible to everyone. He used hand machining tools to make nascar blocks, pistons , valves, heads
go IOWA
So proud bud...keep the dream moving..never stop never say it's enough
So is James part owner too???
Congratulations guy's! That's awesome news!!
NOW its ALL about the Fame Fortune and MONEY SELL OUT👎🏼👎🏼
HELL YEAH BROTHER
Where AMERICA goes for auto parts!  (and where I trade all my GameStop stocks!!)
I need a turbo kit for my 62 Corvair Spyder!
This is awesome, congrats guys!
Hell yeah brother!!!! So much freedom!!
I’ve been here from the beginning. This made me shed a few tears. I’m so happy for and proud of you bro.
Proud to be a part of the Cleetus community, hell yeah bruuuuuther!
Congratulations
Congrats brotthhhhhhhhherr
Love it! Congratulations buddy! Car lovers working with car lovers for the love of working with cars and helping others. I feel a lot of businesses has lost touch with the people they support, it's not a about making money at the cost of your customers. It's about customers and you winning together 🤘❤️ we love what you guys do 🚀
Please please don’t leave out ecoboost engines Cleetus there already 99.99% of shops that will Deny them don’t be one please! Help out all racers
First line of car parts needs to be called "Cleetus in Motion"
Does James have stake in the channel yet?
I see some HAAS stickers in the background, does the company have something to do with the nascar team HAAS or the F1 team HAAS
So Motion have the V8 stuff covered from the looks of it. What about a Bunker Branding style business model, Motion have the skills what about making parts for other YouTubers like say Boosted Boiz/PFI/Vargas Bros etc branded bits to cover their target audiences?
Wow, and I thought Y'all were gonna get a motor built by Steve Morris.. Great move brotha, I'm sure both the Cleetus world and Motion will benifit!
Awesome decision guys.  Set you up for current time-frame and future as well. New parts, R&D, testing and advertisement.  Y'all are awesome.
Gratz guys.
Hell yeah brother!
Dude! That is absolutely great news I have been ordering stuff from them from years! literally the best company I’ve ever worked with.
Hell yeah I'm excited
Ol Doug is gonna have to step up his Nova game to keep pace with the El Camino
How do we convince cleetus to always daily vlog!!!
Well that is exciting news! Best of luck on the new partnership!
Can never go wrong with making SBC parts😎👍🏻
Not at all what I was expecting! Way more awesomer! Doing it for Dale!
LETS GOOOOOO!!!!
Billet aluminium is way of the future, although there is a shitload of wastage from a 18lb block of aluminium to just 0.9lb where does the rest go?
Hell Yeah Brother, Congratulations!!!!
Cleetus once again breaking history
Smart move guys.....👍👍👍👍👍👍
Congrats guys! 4:12 Did you purchase that firearm part through a licenced FFL?
Congratulations fellas!
You got me! I thought for sure you were going to announce that you had bought the drag strip and were going to annex it to the FF to make the brand new Freedom Complex. This announcement was definitely just as cool though. I’ve been dreaming about boosting my 2015 Mustang GT Premium with only 6000 miles on it, and now I know who I’m buying the parts from! I’m an older guy now whose sold all his tools, so the icing on the cake would be to have the FF racing team install the turbskie and allow me to participate in whatever way I can. If this sounds like something you’re interested in, please reply here or email me at: skyking4460@gmail.com
This is so cool! You guys are killing it! Congratulations and I wish you all the best in your new endeavors.
I thought you were making Jackstand a 49% partner.
So good.  So happy for everyone.
“You can cut these hands bud”😂 gotta love it
shits got me in tears man, congrats !
Motion Raceworks - McFarland Fab Edition
Big moves!!! So proud of you guys and so happy to see it since the beginning 🙏
Hell yeah brother congrats!
WOOOOO!!
Congrats guys, had to get a valley cover for my build.
I get this Stepbrothers vide from Cleet and Jackstand, "we're a package deal and here to f@*^ s&!/ up!".
So excited for you!!!!
FUCK YEAAAAAAA
in the middle of the petrol "endgame" ... i hope it works out positive for you all,
Hell yeah!!!  This is awesome, guys. I’m so happy for you. I’d love to have some hub caps for my Taurus to show off. 😍
Now we’re gonna start hearing a lot of “We’re gonna need to tweak that James” when test parts fail at the track lol
I’ve been looking for an LS swap kit for my 2010 Malibu
Congrats! Awesome move.
All those Haas cnc machines are made in California, USA. 🇺🇸🤘
Great video with a even greater decision
This partnership is motivating me to build my Vega sooner rather than later... This is incredible, nobody called this one.
Congrats!
sick !
Wow I thought we were getting Cooper  back this is wacky lol
Jackstand Jimmys Nitrous parts?!
Why would they give up so much shares?? Makes no sense..
Can we get a Hell Yeah Brother!
Everything touched by Mr. Freedom could become a special edition.
Cletus branded fuel rails would be awesome! make fittings with them so they can adapt to any size injector
Congrats boys.ummmm . Can we see racing now ROFL 🤣
Congratulations 👏👏👏
You should look at a furnace and press. Turn those aluminum chips back into billets. Instead of tossing 80% of the aluminum you paid for, use all of it.
Gotta keep moving forward and growing your business and brand. Youtubes not always gonna be there especially how corrupt they are and other social media censoring people and since liberals don't like freedom and burning fossil fuel gotta be careful
Kinda obvious now that i think about it but still wish it was the dragstrip.  The sticker on the car was huge and didnt make sense at the time.  This is great fot cleetus but doesnt mean much for us. Stupidest guess i heard was the having a kid one.  Wouldn't consider that big growth for the channel.
Congrats!!
Does this mean we will get an event in Iowa now?
Idiot can't build a car or an engine..... wants to design parts and build them? What in the actual F$%K! NO WAY!
Hell ya brother, can you guys make some og sbc valve covers and breathers?
I need valve covers with a jack stand on them for jack stand jimmy 🤘🏻
so I'm a machinist where do I sign up
how jack stand get his nickname and who gave him the nickname
Oh hell yea brother!!!!! Ole Dale would be proud just like the rest of us are for you and the channel.
Cleetus-branded car parts stores next?  You could encourage repairs and burnouts in your parking lots.  Congratulations!
Congratulations to the whole crew. Couldn't be happier for you all. That being said, I am not sitting through a 1/2 hour infomercial.
Right on!
Hell ya brother!!!!
Congrats guys.
Still sponsored by Summit?
This is freaking insane!!!  How in the world can you afford all of this?? You need to make some online courses and teach us
Nice machines!!! I use a lot of doosan.
Now you need to partner up with brands like kleenex tissue for people taken to gapelbees by cars having your products installed and depends adult diapers for those the sh*t their pants because your parts make them go too fast. CONGRATS on your success dude.
I never clicked on a notification so fast.   Congrats and hell yeah brother.
Holy toledo! Congratulations!! Everytime Garrett has said "we plan on doing this for the next 30 years", he fully means it. Man I'm so happy about this. Unbelievable.
Hell yea 💯 perfect match congrats boys!!
My guys getting it done! Congratulations guys!
Parts Bins!
If y'all ever need a machinist hit me up. I've been setting up amd running 3, 4, and 5 axis Haas, Moris, and Mazaks for the past 20 yrs. Lol
HELL YEAH, BROTHER! Doug and Co are amazing folks! Congratulations!!!!!
Motion boatworks? 👀
... and you know, they use Haas machinery which technically connects you guys to F1. Moving up in the world!
This is the only video ive skipped my way through
Did I just hear cleetus say “shit” on video??? HE IS human!
Cleeter, that you were able to work out a deal with Motion on valuation in order to make a deal happen...def shows you are very savvy business person. Kudos to you and James...
Im going to get hate for this but oh well 🤣 i know your 100%an ls guy but will there ever be any cleetus edition ford parts?
Dews up wheels down hot damn Cleet and Jackstand are in town! Congrats BROTHERS!!!  Now them stickers will get us 65HPs. I can feel my mullet jumping up and down with excitement. Hell I even had a Bald eagle fly 25 yards in front of my truck this morning on my way to the field. I knew today was gonna be a good day. Lunch is over and the hay wont cut itself yet. So I raise my Dew to you and the crews.  "Drive safe, burn rubber, and never forget where we come from. Heres to you..."
Hell yea brother ! BIG BOSS MOVES CLEETUR!!!
Great move cleet & jackstand. Now you can break parts and blame your self.
Wait for the motion freedom marine brand start out.
Hell yeah brother! Well done guys so pumped to hear the good new keep doing what your doing!!!
The good kind of motion sickness
Can't believe Cleetus didn't hop in the JCB power boom. They're fun.
Well.... that brand just went in the toilet!
LMK when you want to start 3d printing pistons. Machines arent quite big enough for whole blocks... yet!
Hell yeah!
Biggest move....yet
Effin awesome developments
this is awesome but I only have JDM cars to work on right now! get in Doug's ear about starting on some 1UZ parts!
So awesome!
Brother this is and amazing thing that you guys are doing. I cant wait to have the Cleetus Logo on my car parts
I'm finally gonna start working on my LS1 swapped c4 and this is so fucking awesome!
Surprised they didn’t call themselves the Chip n’ Dales dumping those bins out.
I’ll assume Cleetus says we then James is part of the picture. Those 2 make a great team and they both have great minds to bring massive ideas to the table. Congratulations to all of you involved!
hell yeah brother... congrats. ill be sure to check them out for any future parts purchase!!!!
At this point, I hope James is financially “involved” in the Cleetus Empire. He is so worthy.
Congratulations Brothers this is big time God is good my friends
Congrats guys. McFarland innovations is growing exponentially
Way to be brave enough to chase that dream. 👍
Congratulations guys it's great to see this channel go from strength to strength. 🇦🇺🇦🇺  Where is Copper though ?
Will I finally be able to say that I got a stage 2 bald eagle, fire me up giraffe, hell yeah cam????
I don't know about you but this video made some bald eagles fall out my eyes......hell yea brother and congratulations! I wish we had the level of freedom over here that you have there.
HELL YEAH BROTHER
Congrats guys!  That's freaking awesome. Smart move! 🇺🇲🏁🦅
Anyone remember when Leroy was naturally aspirated? Way to do it for Dale brother.
You'll have to teach Demo Matt how to do a burnout out of a building like that without hitting the door!
A Big BIG FUCK YEAH BROTHER!!
Are they hiring ? I live 20 mins away
👊🏻😎
Motion race works and McFarland Fabrication have merged!!!!!
Nice to see y'all investing in your future,  not to many do that
Right on bud. Love all the work and time y'all are putting in. Rooting for ya.
Also pretty jealous of Motion.  Dad and I have had our shop since 1989 and have yet to come up with a single product of our own.
Nelk and cleetus making big moves 🔥🔥
Congrats on the motion raceworks deal.... Can we just all give a clap for the fuck you customer camera they have lol  Also,any chance their hiring????
This is so sick!!

Big things going for some great people! 👍
Congrats on your NEW LIFE ADVENTURES!!!!
Dude that’s awesome man, making gains. Before you know it you’ll be running a track that builds race cars and manufacturers race car parts.
Hellllll yeahhhhhh brother!!!!
Remember that episode of Rick And Morty SIMPLE RICKS WAFERS, i was feeling the whole opening of CLEETUS video as his dreams are coming to life. the music was right on for the story. CONGRATS GUYS
Awesome 🤘
Leaving Cooper out of Cleetus McFarland was the best decision to date
This is awesome. Great move Garrett.
Huge congratulations !!!!! This is life changing for everybody involved
AMERICAN MADE PEOPLE!.. Bring Manufacturing and Production back to the USA!!!
Would they have a drive shaft for crew cab short bed 05 Silverado

Congratulations!!! Hopefully the Boxers came with the 20%!!! Love them🤙
Yeeeeeee haaaa, well done Cleetus and all you guys. Big fan of you guys.
Hell yeah brother that is so awesome that yall did that
ill be 100% honest. thats not a bigger move then buying a racetrack. now i am not saying it isnt a big move! but you over hyped it a bit high.
Omg that burnout was warbird level. Freaking ripped it.
Jack stand better get his own jack with his name on it!
Why is Seth Rogen's less successful Irish cousin running the CNC machines?
make some evo 8 parts
Congratulations brothers! I can't wait for the SXS parts.  What does this mean for the summit sponsorship?  I live 10 minutes from summit racing. So do I change who I get parts form now lol?....
Any job openings there🥲
I wonder if Cooper regrets leaving the team when he did. garret & Jackstand are making big moves and he still can't get his bump box working 😂
You should have used toast for the burnout 😔
Congratulations! That's a good move! Next step, buying at least a participation on Bradenton track.
2 boxers in the video... i'm in!
Also explains the big Motion stickers in MulletS
Congratulations guys.  as for something i would love to have is wrangler 4.0 valve cover. All the ones currently on the market are garbage and not made in America
looks like some amazing parts but unfortunately no mopar parts. see what you can do about making some mopar stuff.
Big Motion Raceworks guy
It was right in front of us the whole time
Mannn i love you good job were all proud!
McFarland freedom is expanding, I wonder if he will be doing big power burnouts at the White House within a couple of years.
Hell yeah! Congratulations! This is awesome
Cleetus McMagnate, amirite?
Nice guys that’s awesome. So proud of you guys
Brother that intro had me straight up emotional. So thrilled for the team 🤘 i’ve been following the channel for a long time and have witnessed the growth all the ups all the downs i guess what i’m trying to say is a huge congratulations 🤘🤘🤘 HELL YEAH BROTHER
When you buy so many parts... you get a share of the business.
Hire me
Awesome to see America making a comeback in manufacturing
Man y’all have room for a UMC1000.  Coulda just made parts there.  Seat of Fusion 360 and Bob’s your uncle.  Might need an ST-20 too.
Great move Cleet!! You guys rock!
There’s no new pond but this works too
AND WHAT'S THIS BUISNESS WITH A WHITE CORVETTE ON HOONIGAN HUH
I would like to see some import stuff.  Custom valve covers Honda B Series K Series  Toyota 2JZ... Nissan G35/37 Throttle Bodies for imports there are millions of imports on the road... 🤔💪👍💯🇺🇸
You need a drone for that
Go and petition for the RPM Act or Cleetus goes out of business.
So sick, Congratulations. I'm happy for you.
Get motion to make stuff for my shitty old mazda
Called it. Wonder what the valuation on 20% was.
Hell yea brother I'm so proud of you guy's. Game changer for sure. Next level here we come 🤟🤟🤟🤟
What a move!
Maybe one day we'll get to see when you design your own small blocks maybe one day🤔!!
that's great, Hopefully the EPA isn't going to fuck you!!
Brothers! Congrats! Love how the subtitles say -music- during the burnout😋
Man you guys were 2 hours from me! 😂
Congratulations guys on a big step forward
How yall keep affording insane amounts of stuff i will never know lmao . casually buys race track .. casually buys 40 crownviks ... casually buys 20% of a company
Hell yeah brother
the machining looks fantastic. would definitely buy non anodized versions of some of these parts just to look at it XD
Noisey ass haas lathe running in the background...
I got scared for a second I thought you sold out to motortrend
The doggo didn’t appreciate You touching his inventory 😂
Congratulations brother I don’t mean to get greedy on the reveals but why did Steve MORRIS build you a great big blower motor
Cleetus is the only person that can make a 30 minute commercial worth watching  Congratulations brother Merica hell yeah
OH MAN! The hint yesterday where Cleeter mentions to Kevin about how large the Motion Raceworks logos are on the side of the El-co! Dannng, we totally slept on that hint!  😂👍  🦅🇺🇸🦅
Congrats! Hoping Buick 3800 parts are coming soon!
The doggo didn’t appreciate You touching his inventory 😂
I’m so glad you dropped out of Law School Cleet….you’re killing the game…..hell yea brother!!!
So I guess that new addition will house all the bald Eagles?
Congrats!! Great way to diversify your portfolio. Godspeed.
Cracked open a Dew for this video. Hell yeah  😎 big moves. Looking forward to more kickass content!!
Fuckin mint brother!
Dude from using mini turbo whistles to this! Way to go. #godblessamerica
Living that American Dream! Congrats on the next step! Wishing you guys nothing but success! Cheers!!
Cleetus I really thought today was the day you were going to tell us why Steve MORRIS made that blower motor for you  a few months ago on his channel but this is a much bigger more amazing reveal but damn would you please tell us what that Steve Morris blower motor is for
So does james own part of that? Or just cleet?
American company producing parts in the USA with CNC machines from another American company, Haas. So much 'Merica!!
Proud 'father' right here, what a badass world of race cars we all get to play in, keep doing great things for our weird community.  Congrats Garrett, James, Doug, Andy, Brian, and crew - 1320Video is here to support you in anything you guys do!
Dang even War Bird was envious of that wheel speed. Cleet with an all timer in the Bald Regal. Congrats to you and James awsome move!
The curseing was such a good ad i enjoyed it more on top of everything.
When you brake so much stuff, its cheaper to buy an auto parts manufacturer than it is to buy auto parts...
Too freaking cool 👍👍🤙
He's living the life we all wish we had.
I'm saying it, billet tractor flaps!
How much did they pay you to put that sticker on Mullet.......nothing 😂
If you guys want to sift through the Motion site, check it out here! https://www.motionraceworks.com/collections/cleetus-mcfarlands-freedom-collection
Badass!!!! I love motion parts, but BRING BACK THE GUSHERS!!!
Love to see this stuff all freedom always ✌️✌️
Yooooooooooo.  Now this is a major year(s) of flex.... Cleetus is building an EMPIRE. Done through hard work, good business acumen, calculated risks, support of amazing people around him, and dedication that would make Napolean jealous.  HELLLL YEAHHH BROTHER. GET IT.
The online store still doesn't work for me.  Not sure why.  Is it set to only purchases from the US or somethin?
I wish I could get one of those valve covers for my jeep, would perfectly match the color I'm going to paint it.
Hell yea brother! Doing big things!!!
"oh these are ford parts nvm" Neighbor -"am i a joke to you?"
Congrats! :) i'm an educated CNC operater to, from Denmark, and to top of those 90 degrees albows you have to make the M logo as a toolpath! that looks so good, i have done the operation some times after i saw a video here on youtube where a 5 axis mashine turned a billet to a fullsize croos helmet, and saw the details on it, it was so cool! hope you understand what i'm saying, or els go see the video of the cress helmet beeing made. :) PS. sorry for my kind of bad english/american! ;)
Yessssir!!!!!!! What a move best ever !!! Let’s the freedom be free!!!!
Cleet said it best. Don't slack on your merch game. Exactly why he going in with motion race works.
Now the big Motion Raceworks sticker makes total sense
😎😎😎😎👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🏁🏁🏁🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅
So dope
When are you coming out with the jack stand Jimmy Edition
he basically bought florida. this is the equivalent.
Wait up, so now that you own Motion, does that mean you're adopting Douggie Fresh?
Lucas looks like a ginger Seth rogan
Congrats!!!!! This company is about to take off.  Not to mention Cleetus really bringing it with his commitment to the industry!
Blew out my headphones at the start of the burnout and I ain't even mad
imagine making an investment in gas powered anything in 2021. LOL
hell yeah brother. 🤘🏽🤙🏼
This is SIIIIIIICK
Do they machine parts for HAAS F1 team?
Wow wow wow. Congrats
Was hoping for a fetus McFarland surprise
Not really super impressed, maybe it’s because I don’t see the big picture or don’t have the need for any of the parts
Welp i know were ill be getting my parts from now on 💯 hell yeah brother! 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Yeahhh congrats guys!! Talk about some progress right there!! Go big or go home they said!
texas speed punchin the air rn
Hell yeah brother 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
HOLY MAC AND CHEESE BALLS. YOU HAVE MADE HISTORY. I am so happy for you and this will help the car community gain Bald Eagles and that is awesome. Congratulations 🍾
This video gave me goosebumps the whole time congratulations you guys truly deserve everything that's come your way ❤
Congratulations all!
Well I guess nobody thought this was gonna happen.
This is amazing. Congratulations boys!!! Time to order some freedom parts for my L94.
Cleetus , please make parts afoordable again! Make cars great again!
congrats to the motion racework and cleetus team!!!
Wouldn't mind seeing a steering column mount to dash bar for caged cars.. I had to make my own but asked motion if they had it first.
Make sure you open up a division in the EU, specifically, scandinavia. In Sweden, we love American V8's as much as turbo Volvos's, and have a reputation for boosting everything till it blows up. Especially a reputation for passionately CNC'd parts. If you look at the Stockholm Open on 1320, you will get the idea. There is a market, and a distributor on the same continent would create a dedicated following. Dual citizen out! :p
i knew this was the big announcement because of the 2 gigantic(er) than normal Motion stickers on Mullet!!!!! Good shit!!!! Congratulations!!!!!
Hell uea brother. You came a long way from working at 1320 to now. Stepping up the game in big ways.
Cleetus McPartland
Congratulations. Best wishes to you.
Very smart business move for both parties... cleetus makes a living off branding himself. If he is going to push a companies products that much, owning a share in the company is smart. And motion has expanded so much since cleetus started advertising them. Having cleetus as a share partner is a solid way of securing their future in the business. win win
now that was a burnout brother
The head machinists lightweight looks like Seth rogan
Now that you are 20% Iowa Boy I better see you at the Iowa State Fair sometime in the future!!
Motion Race Works is about to blow up!
Congratulations fellas!
Ima go home and get me Mountain Dew just to christen this new relationship
What about 350 small block Chevy parts?
I would’ve thought it was going to something with Mountain Dew, but that’s even better
Amazing! Yesss
I want to see the look on the news guy that did the story on the freedom factory purchase with cleetus. I am so happy for you guys. I feel like I literally know yall, and have never met in person. Hell yow bruther.

HELL YEAH BROTHER!!! Freakin awesome, you guys never fail to impress
We all did this!! Us together as one. Because we are loyal to the channel and won't stop watching and supporting. It's all about those bald eagles!! Hell ya brother 💯
HAAS, the best!!
well done Bud
YES DUDE!!!! Cleetus thanks for all you do you motivate me to live the life i wanna live

Brilliant!  Looking towards the future!

THIS is what the American dream looks like. A kid and his friend doing what they love and making a killing doing it
Next I wanna see Florida Man Engines 😂😂😂
Better than summits cheap ishhh
I’m gonna cry now
Get KSR Kevins brain and experience onboard with you making parts, and youll be unstoppable.
Cnc machine go, “Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehaaaaaa” 🤠🇺🇸🦅
When he says "we" does he mean himself and James or himself and the Cleetus McFarland brand?
Freedom in Motion ......  nice work chaps
Jump into the Godzilla swap market for Fox Bodies and classic Ford cars and trucks! We need twin turbo kits for Godzilla swaps!
Cooper punching the air rn
From now on, contracts should be signed with a meaty burnout!
Well done guys.. proud of you both.. onwards and upwards it is then.. much love from here in the UK..  👍
Congrats guys! Now I need to LS swap my E30... Need to USA made swap kit for that chassis...
Florida man wears safety glasses, you wouldn't want particles in your eyes. Doesn't wear a mask despite the higher chance of infection than metal particles in your face.
Need to make a set of motion raceworks jackstands. Called the “Jackstand Jackstands”. Jackstand tested. Jackstand approved.
I don’t even own a race car but I’m about to order some parts to support. Hell yea, keep on killing it
Anyone else baffled by the amount of waste in motion's mfg processes?
This just feels like a 30 minute Motion Raceworks ad.. and I am ok with this :D
Great job guys
As a machinist who lives this everyday and someone who has purchased Motion parts before, I can say hands down their products are TOP NOTCH quality! Congrats Guys!
Solid team up! I will now look to motion for race car goodies!
Fantastic
Whatever stops the Shadow Ledgends ads 😂😂😘😘
Congrats 👏
Damn just when a guy starts plotting on a ls bmw it’s meant to be
Makes sense to have boxers running the shipping department.
A lot of freedom in this video 🦅 🇺🇸
Congrats
Hell yeah. Congrats, guys.
Cleet stays inspiring us all.
So does that mean cleetus owns 20% of the motion raceworks nova Lol
congrats cleetus HELL YA GOD BLESS AMERICA
Securing your own future, working with real professionals. Love it. Congrats guys
So glad its not a tv show good grief cleet had me for a sec but last night when i saw the vid where kevin asked how much they paid for the sticker on mullet and you paused i knew the deal brother
Will summit racing still be a sponsorship if now you are part owner of a competitor to them?
Your whole career and lifestyle is in danger. When the dust settles, people will remember those who fought for the RPM act and they will take their business there accordingly. And you sure as hell wont be one of those. Your 3 min video on the RPM act on your SECONDARY channel is a joke. Good luck with your business endeavors but this is ignorance at its finest. Phock you if you dont speak up for all of us on your MAIN channel.
Go forth, and prosper, with great love.. your fans
Imagine being so self absorbed that you feel the need to tell everyone about your monetary investments
Mcfarland Raceworks!
This is the American dream right here in this channel
First thing I thought I hope he dont toss that block of metal at some one definitely do some damage to someone's body
THE BIGGEST HELL YEAH BROTHER!  THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!
HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!
What a great development, a synchronous move that will allow you to grow. Nice one!
OMG!  How freaking awesome!!  Can’t wait to use them on my build!!
The only thing motion raceworks is missing is a smelter to melt the aluminum scrap back down and make their own blocks of aluminum so everything would be done in-house
I think that's awesome now get the pricing so you do t have to be a millionaire to buy or build.
I think it’s a great choice brother for the McFarland crew and Motion 👏👏👍.   Now to the topic at hand  “ THE SUMMER OF FREEDOM “ would be 🔥 LETS GO
They need a smelter to put all those shavings in to melt them back down and make more blocks.
There u go I give u praise for making ur future and all ur dreams come true
That Motion Raceworks banner at the Freedom Factory just got a liiittle bigger!
It's an investment in America!!! Attached boy, Garrett!
I wonder what's gonna happen? California is looking at banning "garage built" or "modified from stock" cars.. other states are looking at the same thing and are pressuring the current Congress to pass a similar law
Hey brother BUCKY THE BUNNY WAS HERE!!! Cant wait to throw some cleetus sponsored race car parts on my ford ranger build
That intro was next level🇺🇸 so happy for y’all!
Congrats guys well earned.
Congratulations guys I think that's a very smart move, we all know that this YouTube thing may not last forever so it's a good thing y'all are investing for the future.
I’m not crying .. WE’RE ALL CRYING!!
Honestly I’m so happy for you guys. Huge moves in the right direction. Can’t wait for the steering wheel
If the EPA has its way your new business venture will be F'd. Might want to make sure the RPM act gets done.
Way to go guys!! You are proof that hard work pays off.
SO DOES THIS MEAN CLEETUS & JAMES CAN SPONSOR PEOPLE NOW? 🤔
Biggest? meh..
Make a "Let 'Er Rip" parachute handle...missed opportunity there!
My man!! I'm pumped!!
SAMSONITE! I was WAY off!  Congrats guys!
Congratulations! Looking forward to more videos and now performance car parts. Now if you want more cars to test parts on and are willing to help out a disabled veteran I have a car for you. It’s a factory black and white 2002 Chevy Camaro B4C police package car that is a former CHP EVOC demonstrator. It has a 10 point roll cage custom built by Chris Alston ( he dose all the cage work for the CHP EVOC cars). It needs a lot of help and I’m limited due to back/neck and hand problems. Unfortunately I was unable to continue being an aircraft mechanic after I left the military and now I’m a truck driver.   Here is how my Camaro was used by the CHP.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Jb5AcYWOw&t=43s  This is what a restored one looks like.  https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0112-120415/2002-chevrolet-camaro-evoc/
Awesome! Gonna go far with this business great job!
Cleet and James, congrats yall. Glad to see yall doing well. Hope everything goes well and the channel and MR thrive.
HECK YEAH!!!!
Is James included in this partnership with motion?
So were tsp?stay at?
lol Motion Raceworks must be truly desperate if Cleetus is their investor. 5 head move by MR though, gas cars are only going to get rarer and so is gas powered motorsport.
Lmfao I love it this video sounds like a tegridy farms ad
Awesome!!
Congratulations, I guess my truck will have motion parts soon!... Umm no it won't. Not much for 351w or truck stuff. Very expensive. Tell us when shit is on sale.
Congratulations to you guys and MotionRaceWorks.
#✌-out spicy🍕🍝  !
This goes without saying, Congrats to both of you.  Y’all deserve it!!!
They had to add on when Cletus came aboard..
If I say the name Cleetus and you don't know who I am talking about, your not my kind of people. I can show you the way though!
Motion x Cleet gen 3 hemi parts!!!
Hell yeah brother! #Cleetermcskeeter #racecarislife #motionraceworks

Well fire me up!
Hell yeah brother keep kicking ass guys let’s get this dude to 3 million subscribers
3mins of crap in the beginning to tell us you sold your name (like what most rich famous people do so its nothing new) so they can engrave it on random stuff and fan boys will cry over it and buy it  like it's a gift from God lol not hating or anything. I would done the same in your shoes lol bust of luck and make that paper!!!
(FREEDOM) Race Works ✌
Congrats brother yall have come a long way from whistles in c7 exhaust, reviewing bad ass cars to killing a certain unicorn. As well help start the careers of several great people and  channels. Your a generous and big hearted individual and this goes to show if you stay humble and follow your dreams while treating people right n of course making the leap of faith you can go far and live the American dream. So once again congrats,you have been a tru inspiration so keep up the good work and I look forward to seeing the "Cleeter built" line of parts lol
Make your own line of turbos, intercoolers, and radiators with fans
Congrats !!!
I'm just so proud Motion has proven you don't need to be offshoring to provide quality products at fair prices.  Congrats on this venture.
Hey Cleetus once the DDE/Daily Driven Exotics guys come back down to the states from Canada soon. You guys should have them come to the Freedom Factory with there Twin Turbo Hurracan and twin turbo Ferrari F12 and have them do doughnuts and drift them at the Freedom Factory!! @DDE @dailydrivenexotics
Glad to see your expanding but we want race content so don't overload us with work content.
Great job. Diversify and have something besides YouTube income. Keep up the great work.  Murica!
I said it before and I will say it again. Plenty of land at the freedom factory to build a test 1/4 mile drag strip. Maybe even add a Motion production plant or warehouse distribution center for us at the south...
Professional drag racer was my guess...
Would love to see a sick retro shift knob
I'm so proud to see all of you moving  foward and helping each other through it all..... godbless
congratulations cleeter u and ol jackstand will become good developers and testers cause we all know yall test the limits to these products lol
Damn right  ...hell ya brother!!!! That's why the motion sticker was so Damn big lol its 20% his lol 😆
oh new empire let's goo
YESSSSS! Awsome!!
Dang shoulda grabbed a McFarland racing long sleeve those are sick!!! Keep up the good work boys!!!
Motion McFarland race works ? Got a nice ring to it
Now all your freebies will be eating in to your bottom line!!
I declare that whenever u do a nasty burnout u gotta have that old glorious flag on the rear of the car loved it
Gave this a thumbs up as soon as you announced your news. Keep succeeding in life. God bless.
Was that a harbor freight digital torque wrench I just saw??
congratulations
I mean, i dont really want parts with your name on them..
great to see this happen for both of you
How can you not like made in the USA, but as a mopar guy, not much on the site I can use... I'm not ls swapping my cars lol
Awesome news!! Respect the hustle.
Why can’t you make parts with attachments we do it on guns. Good expansion!!
I wish the parachute handle said “slow down brother.”
Congrats guys! Sustainability is definitely a big question when it comes to doing YouTube full time so it’s cool to see you guys coming up with great ideas such as this and the freedom factory so you guys can stick around as long as possible
So cool 🔥me☝️everyone knows it’s the Motion that makes the potion work...
It was cheaper to buy a 20% stake than to keep paying for James to break parts...
Hell Yeah Brothers! Been a fan for a Long time Congratulations and wishing Cleetus, James and All of Motion Motor Works on your ventures of bringing us Freedom. Keep Ripping it. From a Bradenton & Old Desota Drag Strip of the 90s wish I was back down there. Let her Rip Tater chip.  An kick ass at Midwest  this week.
I could use a turbo kit for a ford ranger 👀
Hey ride by I have about 15 tubs of chips I need emptied lol
Do the sponsors own part of the freedom factory?
Congrats to both MRW and Cleetus.. starting a cnc shop myself it is very inspiring.
Support 🇺🇲
congrats guys, no better dudes on “the tube” you earned it!
Congratulations fellas!!!!!
Cletus you an jack stand were meant to be best friends in life I can't think of two other people that work together as well as y'all do
Congrats! I am very proud of you guys!  All the hard work and dedication to keep it fun, entertaining and educational is truly appreciated.
Yessir! Big moves and money moves baby💯
I cant wait to see the up and coming motion raceworks freedom factory manufacturing plant
holy shit was totally not expecting that. definitely thought mountain dew finally realized how much revenue you’re bringing them 😂 but damn guys this is fucking awesome news. that is a texas sized hell yeah brother on that one
HELL YEAH BROTHER 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Hell yea brother
Now that you've raced the packaging team, the boxers should have to challenge Holly to fetching and packing orders. Let's see who wins that deal.
Cleet, you're out their living the dream brother. Proud of you guys!
HELL YA BROTHER!!
Meh.  I was thinking a baby cleeter On the way.   Well done on the car parts dealy’o.  Keep making the awesome video’s
So Happy for you guys!!! Love that everything is made in the USA!!!
pretty cool, guys.  congratulations.   I felt sure that you and James were going to announce a domestic partnership, I just wasn't expecting this kind
BROOOOOO I KNOW WHO IM BUYING MY PERFORMANCE PARTS FROM NOW !!! HEEEELL YEAH
Congratulations! This is awesome news!
Cleetus buys part of motion race works and the freedom factory. Cooper still can't put a lift in his garage and get his 240 done. Really bet he's regretting leaving
Brought a tear to my eye, this is big boys and girls!  You guys made a good move.
Huge hell yeah brother.
I’m going to be honest, I thought it was gonna be a Mountain Dew sponsorship
Might want to send cooper one of those trans catch cans 😂
I was really worried the announcement would be some TV show that would take away from this great channel. Instead, it's an awesome announcement of a stake in an excellent company. I'm planning to build a car and gift it to my dad for his 75th here in a few years, and I definitely intend to use Motion Raceworks parts now.
No rice parts available. Potatos only.
His skid out of the garage was one of the best of his life
Congrats! What an awesome partnership, explains the massive motion raceworks sticker on the elco!
Now that’s freaking Rowdy! Let’s Goooooo
Between nelk and cleet YouTube gonna take over our life’s
I love how it’s always a ‘we’ thing with cleet, always bringing his friends with him
God Speed Brother
Awesome. Keep up the great work
Cleetus and James this is amazing guys. I am so proud of you guys and the fact that you have been growing your brand and company. I wish more people could see this and see how you don't just sit and maintain what you have. But you are constantly moving forward and growing. It makes me happy to see you growing Cleetus McFarland and Freedom Factory Brands. I don't understand why alot of people just stay content with what they have once they feel they have built there brand. They should be constantly growing it and you guys along with The Stradman and the Guys and Gals from DDE are constantly growing your Brands. Well done guys!
That's awesome you guys congratulations that a great move in the right direction. Game changer i don't think any one on tube you is doing this smart.
This gets me excited. Im running lathes, haas mills and edm machines all day. The possibilities are endless
Hell yeah brother
If the EPA gets its way, this business is doomed. The EPA is trying to stop us from modifying our cars.
Expand their product lines over to the Gen 3 Hemis and give us Mopar guys some love!
So now motion raceworks has boxers and one giraffe
Those valve cover and catch can NEEDS  to come with red hardware
Is James part owner of any pat of Cleetus
And here I thought they where adopting KSR
Love it. Great synergies!
79 malibu sheet metal drag wing. Tell Doug too stop slackin
Proud of you fellas!! Congrats to you all!! MURICA!!!
Come out with your own line of turbos now
I had no idea that Motion Raceworks was 30 minutes from my house.
I've watched from day 1! Yal are amazing people we need more like You! The dream is very much alive if you make it ! Much love.
Next up, stronger manual gearbox for leroy! 😅
Wow thats awesome congrats
😥
I kinda thought he was gonna say texas speed not motion raceworks.   Not that they haven't been there I just think of them naturally because I'm from Texas and  from their old location in Lubbock before they moved up in the world.   This is going to be great for yall and great for your fans.   It's a tricky balance of spending money on r&d and letting some jobs go but taking risk to try new things and trying to cover the cost in the end.    Some people don't realize this simple little part that cuts out in  30 min cost so much,  but it's the months and thousands of dollars of failures before that new badass part was made that makes your part work.
So much better than what I was thinking it would be 🤘🏼
Feed that boxer yo
Who immediately thought back to Kevin saying "It depends how much they are paying?" regarding the Motion Raceworks stickers on Mullet from the video the other day?  Thought Kevin acted funny when he asked that, now we know why
Congratulations
Holy Snappin ring-spanners Batman! this is freakin awesome, im feeling really patriotic and im a true blue Aussie. thats the effect your enthusiasm and great attitude has on us i am proud to support you guys. Keep sending it brother!
Imagine being able to shop in that warehouse in person and building a car you have parked outside on jackstands
A build-it-yourself log style turbo manifold kit would be amazing! It's been oddly difficult trying to get all the right size reducers, bends, metal types, etc.
So now I can hit you up for custom 3v parts? Haha great job my guy 👍 can't wait to see whats to come
Hope you guys weather the covid pandemic and motion stays profitable.
So exciting for y’all and Doug! Him and his guys seem to be super cool people too. Loved the video
Cleetus 2024!
Heel yeah Cleetus! Machining is my life!😎
Ohhh S.H.I.T. awesome collab. Cant beat anything thats made in house, in 'Murica.
Congrats brother,  how did Texas speed take the news?
voh.fyi wonderful
I consider these parts ......  150%...TESTED ! 😃🤣🤣
NELK makes their own seltzer, Cleet releases his own line of race parts who’s next to be different....🤔😂
Watching you do all this with your best friends is so freaking awesome and inspiring and emotional and fucking amazing dude 🤘🤘
You are changing the motorsports world. Glad to be a spectator.
You have exceeded every stock broker's wildest financial dreams while having more fun than all of them combined!  😎👍 Congratulations dudes 🎉
sorriest company ever now
When you break parts for a living, people always joke “aw man you should buy stock in xyz.”  Well, Cleet did one better.  This is fantastic.  Congrats!  Always moving forward!! TO THE MOOOOON!!!!
Awesome
very smart move by the professional florida man
Soo are we bringing  MCFARLAND FABRICATIONS to motion?!  Hell ya BROTHERS!! 🇺🇸
Congratulations guys!!! I'm confident this is just the beginning!
What a joke. Big news is COMMERCIAL.   When your automotive race car channel provides more commercial content than QVC
Congrats..... 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Hell yeah
Hell yeah brother!!! I was expecting to hear you guys were pregnant... This is way better!
So Kevin’s question on yesterday’s video was a combination of foreshadowing and an inside joke. Well played. Slow clap 👏
Congratulations!!! Making Boss moves!!!
Very exciting news, the next step in world domination.
I literally live 25 minutes from motion race works
Hell yeah, gotta invest in the future!
Sickest burnout I've ever seen on this channel!

Everything I get from Motion is some of the best quality parts I've ever used. A DumDum sucker in each box is a nice bonus too lol
James bought in just for the turbskies
Cleeter-boy needs to be a movie. Or atleast a video
Ratchet things to the next level!
Y’all gotta get Governor Desantis out to the freedom factory and have him rip around in neighbor

Love this deal. So glad its not going over to tv
They're following you because you smell like dog treats and mountain dew ! LOL.......Congratulations guys that is so awesome! I would never have guessed it before hand but after watching the mullets get unloaded and ready for race week the other night you mentioned that the MRW sign was just representing and that they didnt give you any money.....my scooby sense were tinglin !!!      That is such a great step for you guys and for them too as I am sure it will be HUGELY beneficial to both parties so a collaboration just makes sense ! Congratulations....good job....keep it up....and let's see how long it takes for you to start making your own brand mirror image turbos !
Is Motion publicly traded? I want to make money too!
I believe a wonderful synergy will emerge from the partnership with Doug and the boys at Motion Raceworks, congratulations to Cleetus and team. from another Aussie fan.
Wasn’t expecting this. But congrats! Just thought it would be something cooler. Do ya thing man make them business moves!
That's absolutely awesome. Congrats to all involved.
Love it my guys  who says racing only costs you money  cleet and jackstand prove you can make money making parts rite here in the USA   keep it up  and to Doug and gang  at motion race works congrats can't wait ti see where you all go from here    but I already know you are all going to the top and anyone who says hard work doesn't  pay off    here's the proof you  can  and ps   stop being lazy  and get after it
Brother How could you forget the Lab Coats!!
So awesome!  Congrats guys, keep crushin it! 💪 #MotionRaceworks
Yes strippers finally!!
HELL YA BROTHER!! SO stoked to hear!
Congrats! If yall make 85' El Camino parts I'll buy'em!
Big timeout for my skepticism.
That's Huge! Congrats. I wish I could've caught you when you flew into Cleveland.
Motion race works build race wheels please .
Hey Cleetus I am happy for you I have been watching you since the beginning. I have a black c5 vette like aka Leroy the savage lol!! I have a built 402 LS. I already loved everything you have done but now you have a place I can order parts from because I trust you entirely. You are down to earth, honest, friendly, and not to mention my special needs daughter loves you and cannot wait to meet you. Keep up the great work. Hell yea brother! Murica!!! Do it for dale!!! Let freedom sing....

Congrats guys!
Dude! Congrats!!
McFarland tuning taking the next logical step 👌
Smart bizz men
Looks like a solid investment. America needs more machine shops!
get then to make a fidget spinner that can handle the nitrous shot.
I was not expecting that
These Guys inspire me to think bigger with my own company. Thanks, let freedom ring.
Are they still partnered with Texas Speed?
Now cleetus can support himself  whenever he brakes something on the car I am happy to say that I want to make a drag car because of cleetus
So freaking proud to see Garrett keep growing as a person, creator and businessman.. Sending all the bald eagle screeches and best of luck to you and jack stand,  I'm excited to get to be here for it all and thank you for taking us with you on this journey :))
Dude congrats this is huge!
Next move, parts supply to uk & oz along with cleetus events.... I'm pretty positive Santa pod would happily host cleetus & cars
So are you sponsoring your own track now?
I'm freaking out. Went straight to comments to see what happened!!!!
I wanna hear jackstand crackin up more his laugh is awesome 😂 hope he’s not sensitive about it cause my buddies would make me laugh just to roast my laugh
Aloha and Congrats from Hawaii to Cleetus and the Gang!!  This has to be the most successful fastest growing channel on youtube!!
I bet Cooper is slightly annoyed he didn't hang around.
What percentage does James own?
Hell yes!! motion is about to be the # 1 supplier in my shop and i'm sure across the country!
Are cleetus and jackstan full business partners or does he still work for Cleetus
Lol I just want all that scrap aluminum 🤣
Cleeter, Jack Stand and Motion just tripled profits. :D
Now if we can keep Bidens EPA off our ass.....
Now they need to swap out that Dr Pepper machine with a Mountain Dew in the break room. Hell yeah!
LETS GOOOOOOO!!!! Best news I've heard this year!
I’m glad y’all are doing well good for you
Hell yeah man!
PFI Speed line of import parts?
Congratulation's !!
Gonna need to change that lunch room pop machine to a Mtn Dew instead of Dr. Pepper.
WOOOOOOOOO, 'MERICA! HELL YEAH!
BIG OLE FIRE ME UP! Did NOT expect this
Super exciting announcement! I'll be looking for things to buy from Motion. Prepare for expansion Cleet, just sayin'.
ive never gotten goose bumps from a you tube video.... UNTIL TODAY! HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!!
Damn ....I wish I knew how to YouTube
Yesss . I was wondering when you where going to make this move. So excited for the future
Would love to see some more companies doing decent big block stuff... hint hint...
All you guys are pretty much family so what took so long? Lol
Gaggle of dogs. Haha.
Well done boys!
Fuckin fuck yeah boysssss!!!!
He ain’t selling out, he’s buying in! 🤘🏻
Making moves!!! Nicely done dude this is going to take things to a new level
MRW is in Iowa.  Cleetus has been doing a video a day throughout May (month of Freedom) so was this recorded in April?
Now you need a warehouse at the FF. Imagine how many people need parts at the FF and the Dragstrip next door. No need to go shopping, got a parts store right there.
Congratulations on your investment and burnout.  Ha ha.    Oh and I went through a Machinist apprenticeship and operated and programmed CNC (Up to 5 axis) machines for years.  Now retired.
I couldn’t think of a better company to be affiliated with in the industry.
Get into the import game! K20/24 motor plates for S2K’s and BRZ’s would be a hot commodity!
Thats a big ol FIRE ME UP!
Whoever disliked this video should be prepared to square up
Congrats Guys that's Awesome!
Yesss! So this means an iowa cleetus and cars!?
There have been so many huge Youtubers who just look at the here and now, you guys truly are miles ahead of them(Literally at times) in making smart moves for the future. If Youtube were to go away tomorrow, you guys have a great foundation where others would just disappear. Well friggin' earned dudes, you guys are geniuses.
Dude im crying
Yea... gotta say I was worried this was gonna go pay to play... now... psh hell yea gotta get some motion raceworks... sales for Motion is about explode with the people in this fan group lol
My piss was Red, White & Blue after watching those Eagles Soar! God Bless Cleetus, and God Bless America!
@14:55.... splitting my sides here!
Cleeter is the king of big announcements
Cleetus & Cars Iowa, coming fall 2021?
I knew something was up when I saw the size of the motion race works decal on the el Camino yesterday
Me: where the  hose at? “Plus they got hose” Me: oh hell yeah
So much freedom, so much awesome. Every time we don't expect it you blow our minds randomly! Congrats, guys! =)
Congratulations guys.  Stepping it up yet again.
Im so proud and happy for you ive watched you since you first started and the channel has never ever let me down amazing content you've came sooo far. Keep it up and never stop growing youre my favorite channel ever....
Suddenly, Mullet's GIANT Motion Raceworks stickers that stand out like a thong in a pair of low rise jeans look a lot more at home. Congrats, fellas!
Hopefully this means more support for the corvette community!
The music within the 1st 5 minutes makes this video sound like a hillshire farm's commercial
from a 36 year old fan who has watched religiously since your first video, i have to say this is like watching my little brothers  make all of their dreams come true. i couldnt be more proud of two guys i have never met before. seriously gave me some emotions! WELL DONE!!!!!
Curious how the shared of Motion are split. Cleeter bought 20%. That doesn't mean the other 80% are controlled by 1 person.
When the guys up there are looking for another boxer send them my way at Bensonsboxers out of sapulpa,ok.
Been following since the beginning! Helped me through 4 deployments giving me something to look forward to every day! The most American and honest channel on YouTube! This is what America is about! FREEDOM AND HORSEPOWER! Hell yeah brother!
if garrett can do it..  every human can do it..  and even a couple of animals too..  :D     Congratz guyz...  taking McFarland Engineering a tad further..  :)
Motion and Power by the Hour are the best!
Congrats guys.
So was the blurred red stuff a new hydro brake setup? That’s my guess!...🤷‍♂️ All the best boys!
Proud of you guys, but maybe I am wrong, but Leeroy is the man that started everything that you have going now. And Mr. Leeroy has not gotten camera love in quite a long time. Leeroy is becoming more and more rare and I really miss that car.   Again, love you guys, just wish we could get more Leeroy action.
14:54 lmao
So how does the partnership between between yourself and jackstand?
Next is a Mountain Dew sponsorship!!
This must be pre Derick from VGG Hope this leads to some revival/destructive testing
HELL YEA BROTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You could have been 30% owners if Cooper was still around!
Congrats guys !
Very cool!
Nice work!!
Somebody told me you guys like my commercials.. well, here's a 30minute one..
THAT'S A BIG FIRE ME UP
McFarland Racing really upped its game with this purchase
The parachute handle should say "WHOA BROTHER!"    LOL
FIRE ME UP 🔥
Me: WELP... now I just GOTTA build a race car so I have to buy some Cleeter McSkeeter MRW parts My bank account: you can buy a sticker...maaayybbee a shirt...
You guys deserve this moment and everything that comes with it you guys are true motivators and inspirational
I don't think I can even afford that bolt on breather adapter... Those are some nice parts. Is motion raceworks hiring?
This is fantastic!
Wasn't he talking about how some law could screw up the racing life where you can't mode your vehicle so if that law gets pasted could the business go under?
I was fully prepared to be heartbroken today. Thanks for keeping it real Cleet. Made my year. 👊
Honestly was the right thing to do for them to sell some of the business to you guys.  Im sure most of their business comes from u and adam lz
I've always wanted a set of aluminum valve covers for a sbc or ls that look like the classic 60's Era Chevrolet valve covers that have the Chevrolet letters raised in thr classic writing for the old car look without the leaking problem
Motion breaking into the SXS game??? Congratulations my man! The whole Motion/Cleetus crew work awesome together, great people!
This was a great move by them to cement themselves in the car industry cause like it or not, I don't think think the youtube thing will be successful for another 20 years
You could have blown up your money on some McLaren or Lamborghini or whatever but no, my man is always spending his money wisely, well done, congrats!
Awesome
Cleetus is now sponsored by cleetus
This brought a fucking tear to my eye GODBLESS AMERICA GODBLESS MOTIONRACEWORKS AND GODBLESS CLEETERMCSKEETER CREW
So excited! Awesome news! Congrats to the both of you! Just please please don't forget about what made this channel great in the first place!
You know you really shouldn't be crapping on Ford seeing how your fleet has to rely on neighbor w quite often. Let's see you put together a fleet of caprices for the next freedom 500 it won't happen.
Smartest investment ever. He now has a full warehouse to receive and ship all his merch for him.
Congratulations guys! Can’t wait to see what happens next!
Congrats brother! Proud AMERICAN right here! Great to see you spreading the joy of BALD EAGLES and of course FREEDOM
Really doesn't matter, the entire economy is going to collapse in the next 3 years. Biden keeps printing........none of this will matter.
I'm definitely buying some ls stuff now
Extended lunch break hahaha
This is freaking awesome! I was around in the exhaust whistle days and to see where you've gone since then is nothing short of incredible! Never bought motion parts because I'm on a tight budget but now with this I think I'll save the extra money to support ol Cleeter and American manufacturing! Hell yeah brother!
Summit getting the boot from ppv sponsorship
Congratulations guys! Big moves!
Next is Holly
I’m sure nothing is gonna beat the return like the merch but adding another stream of revenue is never a bad diversity pays off in the long term
I get why he wanted to buy in, but why did MRW want to sell off 20%. From the looks of the shop, inventory, and shop addition it doesn't appear they needed an influx of cash.
Poor Cooper...
Im a machinist by trade and career path! Im a car enthusiast by life choice! My goal and dream is to work in a company like motion raceworks making custom car parts in a machine shop! Not gonna lie id love to end up in motion racewprks machine shop one day!
Y’all need to make boom tubes so we can bring Dale to the streets
Hell yea brother!!
Congrats on the new factory.
VGG was there not to long after this video cuz when he was there that addition had concrete.
Do they make sleeves?
Will the blue catch can fit a 2020 Mustang GT?
Did you ever make a video how you met James I remember a time when he was not part of the channel. What an amazing addition always liked having James around
Must of been a slow day if the dogs are just wandering around and not packing orders.
Awesome
First there was Summit Raceway, Now there's the Motion Raceworks Freedom Factory.
That's Some Slick Machinery Right There
Hell ya brother
When you show up to a board meeting and the other members just wanna know what you broke this time
This hit back to my childhood show dirty jobs....but just a proud co owner who makes ppls jobs a lot more comforting so to his presence
Hell ya Brother Congrats
I want 2 of those Cleetus catch cans so bad. Maybe in a week or so
I had a feeling something was going to happen with you guys and motion race works!!! Hell yeay
I’ve always thought you could wear thermal goggles to see in the smoke for burnout comps.
I Feel Like A Proud Dad Right Now, We Are All Proud Of You Son! Lol. Seriously Let's Goooo! Cleetus McFarland Channel Is Killing iT!
Please tell me the Cleetus steering wheel has an off center locating stripe
As a small machine shop owner, machinist, dragrace and cleeter fan. This is awesomem 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
What happens to all the shavings ? Are they used somehow
Congrats!
Love you cleet
Hell yeah brother!!! I can't think of a better way to expand both your awesome channel and Motion Raceworks!!!
now the giant sticker on Mullet makes more sense
We love too see it HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!!!
I guess Texas speed wanted to be it’s own company and not split it with anyone. Unless he has plans in the future to work with them more...I mean he has his own cam on their site so.
Little known fact: The dog breed "boxer" gets their name from their incredible ability to pack orders.
Awesome so happy for you guys
Congratulations. I can't believe how far you have come and i can't be more happy for you and the whole team.
Hell yeah Brother!!!!!  That is a great investment for everyone involved.
Awesome!
Hell ya brother keep on keepin on!
So did you trade a lock of your mullet for that 20%?
Now all you have to worry about, is the EPA.  They apparently idolize Nazis.
That intro was amazing
"Where dogs come to work!".  That's enough for me, sign me up!
I don't want to tell you your business, but....I think the race track was by the biggest thing to ever happen to your franchise by a country mile. Sure I can buy a part, but I dream of visiting the Freedom Factory. More events!!!! And if you have a milled Motion Raceworks bottle opener in the gift shop, you can have my money for that as well.
Hell yeah guys. Couldn’t be more proud
You guys have been workin so hard for all of us over the years so thank you for that. This is a smart move and you deserve a standing ovation today from all of us. Congratulations!!! I’m sure a bunch of us out here will be ordering all sorts of bald eagle bits from Motion! I know I will.  My petition is still going on for some Toast some spicy spicy Toast....
Bout to watch. Can’t wait!
Why the hell did this bring a tear to my eye. Your channel has got me through so many dark times im just so invested in you guys.   Thank you and GOODLUCK!!!
Good move for you. The way you break things you need a free supply of parts. 😛
That’s a sweet deal and you should also take advantage of those sweet jet boats and make your own Brand models because I want one, I thought I was done with boats but damn them things can go anywhere there’s water sign me up
woohoo bidness
Probably cost more. I'm not sure just geussing.
HOLY SHIT
Congrats you guys. It's all paying off! What a killer partnership
Hell yeah brother ! Always pushing to the next level🤟🏼
Looks like were getting billet exhaust whistles 🤣🤣
Where is the ruby red 🤔 but congratulations 👏.
well that explains the GIGANTIC MOTION RACEWORKS stickers on the side of Mullet.
I’d like to suggest that in addition to the “Cleetus” branded items that you also offer a “Freedom Factory” edition.
This is literally the best news to drop since the announcement of the bald eagle being our national bird!!!🦅🦅🦅
CONGRATULTIONS🎉🙏🍻🇺🇲🦅
Damn. Y'all are about to have to expand operations. haha. Great move for all involved!
Huge congrats to you Cleetus, for making big moves. I wish you much success 😁 hell yeah brother!!
Can I come work for motion? I got 6 more months of school and then I’ll have an engineering degree and I can make parts for you
Now get them to stop buying those garbage machines and get some Japanese or German production machines that will run circles around those.
🇺🇲Awesome!   The opening story gave me chills..  Nice work boys!  HELL YEAH BROTHER!! 🇺🇲
Cleetus McFarland is living the dream no truer statement has ever been said
Congrats guys. Setting yourself up for the future. Smart move
Damn. James droppin dimes!
Let's see some awesome fender covers!
Congrats..no more china shit coming into my house
Can we get shift knobs????
Well done Garrett! You need to get Castlemain Rod Shop on board as an Australian Distributor 🇦🇺🦘🇺🇸🦅
Welp no excuses now. Gotta build a racecar
Cleetus and jackstand congratulations  you have built an amazing community and shown us that you truly care about your fan's. You are the only youtuber I have ever bought merchandise from and I will continue to buy from because I like your message and what you stand for. God bless America and may you and yours stay blessed
Big respect for not selling out to Motortrend!  Always outta left field with the reveals!  Hell yeah bruthurs
Love that.
Noting better than Hot-Rodders supporting Hot-Rodders.  So many communities "eat their own" and strive to run on drama, bad attitude, and poor sportsmanship that it is a poor refection on the automotive lifestyle. I am glad the channels and people like Cleetus & crew and Brent & crew that put forth such great content - and not only do things that benefit themselves - but help out other people  that actually support the community instead of trying to burn it down for the likes/upvotes/etc.  Only great things happen when great people team up - and I can't wait to see what is in store . We already have the Cleetus / FF, KSR, Fasterproms, Pfi speed, etc - what a time to be be a hot-rodder!!!
That’s why he put the stickers on Mullet for “just because!” I know that was a hint to something lol
I saw multiple Hass stickers, do they make parts for the F1 team?
This is very cool. Also, burn-outs have jumped the shark big time.  Best of luck with the business.
You’re going to have to start wearing a diaper for all the money that’s gonna be falling out of your ass
When cleet tried to weld and it just POPPED off… IM WEAK🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was worried about what you were going to announce but now Im happy GREAT DECISION
You should revisit hoonigan. Ken has a sick electric race car. It would be sick if you made the first electric drag car in the 6s.
Great, now I just can't buy merch to support the channel, I have to buy a race car 👍 He'll yeah
So when are you getting a stake in Texas Speed?
MRW today: 50,000 subs. MRW tomorrow: 1.8 million subs.  HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!
You guys need to buy the dragstrip nextdoor!!!!
“Don’t slack on your merch game!” AKA have people pay you to advertise for you!
Congrats to Cleetus An his crew an jackstand also as well as motion race works !! Make a great team for sure !! 👍
LEGENDARY BALD EAGLE BURNER ON THAT ONE OLE CLEETER
Ol Cleeter unleashed every bald eagle 🦅 on that burn out  !!!! 😯 Congrats 🍾🎊🎈 on the partnership guys !!!
Hell ya boys Gitter done
Congrats my dudes, this is a really awesome step for you to make.  Happy to see you start to make long term investments in small business.  Not dogging on the Freedom factory, that's a different type of investment.
Good Idea. Bad execution.
Get some Cleetus and Friends!
Straight up killed it!
Did I just watch a 32 minute commercial? Hell Yeah I did.
HELL YEA BROTHER
Is both of yall or just you that are partners
Well done guys To the future
Yesterday kevin asked Garrett how much motion paid to have the sticker on mullet, little did we know Garrett actually paid a lot of money to put it there.
Congratulations  guys  #goals #livingmydream
Congrats man🔥🔥
We need Cleetus branded shiftknobs and covers👀
I saw this one coming with the Easter egg from the last video awesome
When is the Cleetus/Jackstand IPO???
Hell yeah Brother!! We're proud of you man. Let er rip tater chip!
Psst hey Garret, you put 2020 in your description :')
Texas Speed will probably be leaving soon.
This is badass! I'm really curious to know how much their sales go up for this... I bet it's gonna be a lot!
As a European I always laughed about the American Dream tale. But screw me he actually made it.  Congratulations
Congrats guys 🤙🙏
Hell yeah, brother! Congrats!
Next big announcement will be to be a part owner of Texas Speed.
Thank god its not a motortrend contract
HAAS F1😎
So much more than just a YouTuber, the future of our sport/car culture is right here with cletus!!
I CALLED IT!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS 🎉
Congrats on the partnership fellas. You deserve the best!
Nelk made their own alcohol now cleetus is making his own car parts. YouTube have evolved into something bigger
Not really exciting for us, you maybe - not us.
‘Merica in Motion
Cheers brothers 🇺🇸✊
Cleetus: sees laser cutter "......cAn i sTaRe aT iT?"
But what are they blurring?!?!?
does James own something to or is he still "just" an employe. just asking no offend
Cooper punching the air right now
Hell yeah brother! I knew when I seen them motion raceworks covering more real estate on mullet that KSR, I said to myself, something is going down behind the scenes between Doug and Cleet that we don’t know about. Congratulations boys!
Make more small block 350 chevy parts and you have my buisness
I ALWAYS wait until after work to watch. I stopped my day for this video!
Well done big move guys 👏👏👍👍
Amazing 👏  can't wait to buy stuff lol
Could we get some ForEd edition Ford parts?
That is some good news. America for Americans!!! God save the Republic.
Big things
I haven’t clicked on a vid this fast! Hell yeah brother!
Hell yeah great to hear Cleetus and the whole team congrats we are pumped for y'all and for the content and products. LONG LIVE MOTORSPORTS!!!!!
Motion about to be the next holley👌👌
This is insane. I’m so proud of you guys, I have been a huge fan since even before leroy. Makes me so happy to see you securing this position for the rest of your life. Love you guys
So still no dew sponsorship
I guessed something close to this yesterday I thought it was a sponsorship in a way it is just with more perks lol he’ll ya brother
Far out guys  exciting times ahead. Congrats & happy days.
Oh snap! Nice one guys, super impressed at all you've managed to build. Long may it continue.
Explains the decal on the Al's quarter panels. Q. What do you guys do with the chaff Alloy leftovers? We used to send them to recycling but you guys would have tons more than we did.
Change the name to McFarland race works.  Would be much easier for marketing
Congratulations! I don’t think the news could have been any better. Not only are you guys extremely entertaining but also very good business men
Not to throw shade Cleet but when Matt went to bunker branding he did a Way better job at keeping up with the packaging hahaha. We need to see you vs Matt now 😅
Probably a dumb question but say I called in to motion raceworks in order to get custom parts for a 4-cylinder engine. Would that be possible?
Now the motion race works stickers on mullet don't look big enough.
Congrats Cleet! huge move!
Holy shit.  I mean, holy SHIT!
The beginning of an era! What’s next a McFarland NHRA team?
Congrats!!
This makes me so happy. Unfortunately I don’t have my G body anymore, or I would be buying stuff like mad.
Congratulations Cleetus & Company!!!
Congrats to cleetus and jackstand
Hell yeah. Congrats, I am curious if jackstand got a percentage of that ownership? Out of curiosity.
You know it's been really cloudy here in Iowa recently.   Now I know why.  Epic smoke show!
I was on the phone with my buddy from Canada and hung up faster than you can say "ey bud I gotta go" when this popped up
You are succeeding because you always say “we”. There’s a selfless vibe the channel gives off, and the peeps watching can’t help but be drawn to. Congrats to you, jackstand, and the crew. Keep pounding.
Congrats to Both Parties. Your Hard Work has Payed TF Off. MRW & CMac Just Signed a License to Print Money...Very Smart. 10:41 - did Garrett use a VGGism of ‘Mind Bottling’ (not Boggling) here? this is hitting too close to home. Derek was just at MRW & now CMac is Co-Owner. Goddamn, I Wasted Time Getting my MBA
#Mcfarlandraceworks
HELL YA BROTHER!!!
Suddenly motion has to hire 10 more people just to pull orders.
Hell yeah brother
Congrats cleet proud of you brotha you james kevin cooper kyle all yall have been major inspiration and you just continue to grow love it bud keep it up
Cleet I'm so proud of you on this decision👍🏾 may god continue to bless you and the team👏🏾👏🏾
Heck yes brotha 😎🦅🇺🇲❤️
Well, I’m sold it Motion  parts  from now on. !!!👍🇺🇸🚀
Congrats! Im stoked for u guys and u desreve every bit of it!
Yup motion raceworks do it all.... let me see more doggos
Please make Jet pump parts! Outboard Jet is the only game out there for outboard Jet parts!!!! Make a better pump and sell to factory oems!!!
Congrats brother!! I know where I am buying my parts from now on!
Great news for Cletus, not so great for viewers, great parts but I don't think we need to see more advertising and additional branded products but maybe I'm wrong. Congratulations are deserved however, you started from the bottom and your heading to the top all self made, I love the channel and have great respect for what you have achieved.
Congrats on the new venture!!
Congrats to everyone involved!
When you smack a part after putting it in the machine, it's generally a good idea to say; "that ain't going nowhere.". If you do that, then you know it'll all be fine, lol.  Lol "I got dis" *part falls off*
Never clicked a video so fast.
congrats!!!!
next you should by the drag strip next door
“Why do you guys have so much loctite?”  Because parts getting chucked off that table tends to hurt
Congrats to motion race works they just came out like bandits hahaha well done sir
24:31 That's what she said.
Congratulations on the share purchase on motion Garrett, making great moves forward, hell ya brother
WOW ! CONGRATS
Hell yeah brothers
Good luck, youre awesome
No helicopters, no babeez, no sick seconds and it’s still some of the best news for both companies as well as fans! 🙂
Now y’all can make your own parts to build cars exactly how you want!
Burnout so good I had to grab a cold one after watching.
You're gonna have to get used to saying "we" instead of "they" like you do when you're talking about it.
I was looking forward to spending money until I realized they don't offer any hemi products...what a shame
Congrats guys!! Yall are taking the race world over.
Hell yeah brother!
Congrats guys!!! 🥳
The explains the visit we saw on the MRW Channel
You need to sell toy models of the cars, and jackstands by jackstand himself
90 thousand views in 15 minutes! Hell yeah brother!
YEE! YEE!
HELL YEA BROTHER!!!! CONGRATS!!!! Now BoostedBoi Kyle needs to buy a part of Motion, that way they have the Honda game on lock as well.
Not sure what is a better reason to move to Florida, The fishing or Cleetus and the FF???
congrats
Love it.  Such a brilliant move to invest in your future.  Hope for tons of success so you can keep expanding and giving great content to the community.  Stay blessed.
Wheres is jackstands name on the part we need a jackstant line of parts.
Cleetus Raceworks shirts anybody?
Crazy to hear cleet swear
You guys need to have the guys at Motion build a full billet crapper for Freedom Force One!
this is way more cool but I'm guessing this also means they didn't buy sick seconds 1.0
If jack stand had of put a part in his pocket after each machine as they turned around I would have died laughing lol
NOW PUT A FUCKIN DIAPER ON RUBY
Most won't understand how big this is for you but some of us get it good job boss
This "move" does not live up to the hype of the past few weeks at all.  The purchase and renovation of the Freedom Factory was way bigger news.
One day a giraffe wielding a star spangled banner will rule over the internet !
Hell yeah man if anyone was ever on the edge about buying parts from motion I bet this is all its going to take to seal the deal for a lot of people!
how about that EPA  thing  going on that wants to shut down the  automotive  upgrade  industry?
I have to give it to Cleetus and the team. It must be so hard not to say what's going on. They're making decisions that alter the direction of the rest of their lives. He buys the Freedom Factory and a 20% stake of Motion Raceworks and nobody knows anything about it till it's done. I go look at a new (to me) car and I have to tell some random stranger in Walmart 🤷🏼‍♂️.
The day motion race works sold out of everything in stock lol.
So stoked for you and James! Well deserved!
Well... they bought the new shop. Just not in Florida.
Congrats Cleetus and James!!
Couldn't think of 2 better companies to merge together Big things are gonna happen
Damn! I never knew how close I lived to motion raceworks. That's crazy!
AMAZING SO HAPPY FOR YALL
This means were not getting a baby giraffe?
Is James part owner?
next up a 20% in a tire company cause he is already responsible for 20% of most revenue with all them burnouts
Who in the world gives thumbs down to this? That's just stupid
Congratulations
God damnit, I love cleetus and all of the crew! Not gonna lie, this purchase has me a little emotional! I'm so happy for both parties and I hope yall keep KILLING IT!!!
Youtube really needs to make a “love” button! Welcome to IOWA 🤟🦅🇺🇸
this one hell of an EPIC move! Congrats!
Garrett is killing it!!! I am so happy this wasnt a tv channel sell out! I cant wait to watch motion blow up now between the freedom factory, and his channel they are going to be putting out some next level product!
Congratulations!!! You guys are going to be the mascots of the company!! A freedom giraffe and a nitros badger lol
Anybody else kinda have that feeling thats what was happening for the last couple weeks?
Man im speechless
WOOT WOOOT! Now Cletus doesn't have to wake anyone up in the middle of the night. 20% gets you a key right?
He is so freaking excited walking around in there.  Now the comment yesterday about the Motion Raceworks sticker on Mullet being too big have a whole different tune.
Did we all just enjoy watching a 30min commercial?.. Sure as hell did.
*Absolutely phenomenal!  Motion is hands down one of the best in the business. Parts are the best of the best but the people behind the business is second to none* 💪💪💪 #MURICA!
I just hope Garrett's ego doesn't swell up and he starts acting like he owns the whole place. 20% investment in the company is a big move but he is a partner he doesn't run the show. Good for MR I hope this move propels the company forward. They seem like great guys.
This is the way you invest in America! 👍🏻🇺🇲
so do they melt down the waste from the CNC machine and reform it into another block of aluminum for future parts? 18 lbs to 0.9 lbs is an incredible waste of natural resources.
Good investment! Glad to see you brought Jack Stand with you for the ride..
Congratulations brothers got to say love motion and there isn’t a more perfect fit for both now damet I need one of them catch can’t for the Silverado LOL 😂
Hell yes! I’ve been watching this channel since day 1! I’m so happy for you guys. Watching y’all grow and chase your dreams like you do, inspires the hell out of me. Way to go boys.
Now you just need to add an aluminum foundry, and make your own billet from the scrap.
If Cleetus cant break it then it has to be good. Congratulations guys!
I'd love to know how much of cleetus mcfarland does james own.. I happy for you guys!!
Lets goooo cleet and the gang!! <3
Congrats been following yall from The beginning! and hope one day you will see us at rocky mountain race week!
Super excited and proud as hell of you guys. Wish you nothing but continued success boys.
So proud of you guys
Its time for matt of demo ranch to become a gun manufacturer!!!!!!
Congratulations 👏🦅
Oh HELL YA BROTHER!! This is the 2nd best thing you brought to us and it's REALLY close to the Freedom Factory. Can't wait to get some parts and knowing it's coming from you guys and all of y'all I'm excited
HELL YEAH BROTHER
Nmkay
Love it but it needs more bald eagles!
I need you guys to make more dodge hemi parts!! i would love to buy some parts for my srt8.
I’m sold just on the boxers! Congratulations boys! Glad to see y’all making moves!!
I guess the prices were increased 20%! 😆
Hell yeah brother you and nelk boys are taking over. just sending it
I live by the Richard Petty museum in his hometown.  I feel like one day all our kids will be able to go to the Cleetus museum.
most of this video is ol' cleeter best of compilation from his visit to motion raceworks lmao. amazing.
Congrats from the Netherlands
One day you need to build an engine entirely out of the parts you've manufactured 🤣
Congrats brotha! Bigger and better things! 💪🏻
All good=== but still get the big hovercraft
The new addition is a jet boat building facility
Cleetus needs to fix the safety stuff on the fleet. Set the example lots of people watching.
yep, this is awesome
did james actually get a piece to? thats awesome you take care of the people that take care of you as well.
Billet Crown Vic parts!!!!
I just bought a motion coolant hose kit a couple weeks ago! hope I got in after the purchase went through XD
Congrats you guys
When you break so many parts that it's cheaper to just buy part of the parts company
W
Sick!!
Awesome 👌.  Might have to to dress up my 5.3 in my truck now
Nelk boys make a seltzer they can’t even send home to Canada and Cleeter gives us PARTS PARTS AND MORE PARTS! So much FREEDOM🥲
👍🇺🇸
Idea: bolt in harness bar, bolt in roll cages
Now these are the moves people want to see. it makes the future look very bright. also gonna have to start buying me some motion raceworks products
Ready for the new jet boat pumps that will come out soon
Anyone else kinda bummed it wasnt a baby announcement? Proud of you boys though! Lets GOOO!!!
👏👏👏👏
👍👍
Congratulations guys! Can't wait to see what creations you all come up with!
Living the freakin dream!
Chills.
Hell yeah brother. Nothing like expanding your career. Congratulations and keep up the good work.
Makes sense when the fleet is getting so big it's probably cheaper to buy part of the company than buy the parts.
Hell yea brother!
What happens to all of the scrap metal? Can it be re-used at all?
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Started from turbo whistles and duck calls to now being part owner of Motion Race Works now thats worth a mountain dew
Motion Race Works billet exhaust whistles. We need to see those being made asap. Haha
Amazing announcement just a shame the engines and cars you are making parts for are rare as rocking horse shit overseas. Congrats tho!
Hell yea brother
Congrats man, who gave that fan a mountain dew she's a ripper!
Hell yea brother
Nice
Famous last words.... you can’t cut these hands
Stepping it up HUGE. Dude went from a kid running an instagram page to the next Jegs.
Congratulations guys!!!
Interesting that VGG is working with MRR after visiting the FF.
I've got to say. This is a BOLD move with the EPA trying to stop cars from racing.
Cleet branded ford parts would be sick
Pieces falling into place...
Only cleet can convince me to watch a 30 minute video about race car parts, when my only vehicle is an 04 grand Cherokee...
Cleetus last year: I bought a race track LZ this year: I bought a whole compound Cleetus today: Oh yea? I bought the company that makes my cars go fast.  It's awesome how far the last 18 months have gone for the giraffe. Hell Yea Brother
I called it lol. I remember the video and said this is the moment you have to build your own parts. Congrats and let's gooooooo!
This is beyond cool seeing how Motion operates, but one thing. Going from 18 pounds down to 0.9 means a 5% utilization for that part. You don't have to do the 5 axis on that, there are other methods that would make that part far cheaper with same quality and function. Just a suggestion to help bring down your costs and the cost of the part for consumers. Congrats Cleet!
They should move them to Florida
On the parachute handle should’ve put Whoa Brother lol definitely happy for u guys tho
Motion race works definitely has got to start producing their own line of heads and engine blocks
Smart move i Like it
Congratulations from Australia 🇦🇺
That Motion sticker on Mullet is about to become a full wrap.
Hopefully Cooper got a piece too. He was a big part since the beginning
What a day. Cleetus posts this, and then Brandon Herrera posts the test fires of the ak50. Holy hell, it can't get much better.
What about coopa
Hell yeah brother
Does this mean “Doug from motion race works” is just “Doug” now? Or do we just call you “Cleetus from Motion race works”?
This is the longest Motion Raceworks ad I’ve have ever watched!
Garrett / AKA Cletus McFarland Congrats on buying into a kickass company I am so proud of how far you have come since the days with 1320 Video you have grown by leaps and bounds thanks for keeping it real w us from Sean in Vermont
He'll yeah right on but I like blue & black
I haven't seen anyone that correctly predicted this strong move. Congrats to everyone involved! I can't wait to see what kind of great products come from this. Wish everyone the greatest success! ✌🏻😎🇺🇸🦅
Hell yeah from Norway 🇳🇴.  Helvete heller kamerat👍
Congrats to the Cleetus team on partnering with Motion! Cant wait to watch Motion blow up with Cleet coming on board!
McFarland Fab is a real thing now 😳😳😳
Congratulations this is some killer news! This is huge. HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!
next up  freedom factory 80%lowers. 🦅
Both of yall didnt put the suckers in so somebody is getting cheated out of there sweet tooth.
This is awesome, congrats guys! 🤘🇺🇸
Yessir!!
Hell yea brother
Making another major step forward!
Yo cleetus I work in a machine shop and we're always looking for new kinds of work. We can do everything up too 4th axis milling. Hmu and I'll get you in touch with my employer. We're in central texas
Congratulations boys! Truly epic! 👍👍💪
This is awesome I’m a fan of Motion Reese works and I have some parts on my 69F 100 that I am building right now wish the valve covers came in SBF cleetus addition
Hell Yeah Brother!!!!
Congrats and best wishes on your new adventure.
From watching videos messing around with the c7 to owning a race track and now owning part of motion raceworks! Its insane to see how far things have come in a few years!
When cleetus says watch this burnout I hear instead watch the start of this burnout and listen to the rest lol
Free upgrades what else can you ask for
Nice to know Seth Rogan is doing well as the head machinist
NO WAY!!  CONGRATULATIONS MAN THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME.  HOLY TOLEDO!!
There couldn't be a better product tester
Proud of the the new family
Oh hell ya that’s awesome... can we make parts requests? Like Wilwood to brembo/Alcon caliper brackets?
I'm ok with this as long as there is no motor trend involved everything gonna be great for a while there last night I was preying they weren't gonna move to motor trend had me worried
time for motion to get 11 axis machines with bar loaders now....going to need the extra production lol...dump the haas, go japanese.
Epic!!!
HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!!!...... to be honest oh, I was afraid that you all sold out to Discovery or something and we're going to make a reality show. I know for sure that on Discovery once you sign up all their content is all your content is theirs. And that would end all of your YouTube and I don't like watching overdramatized scripted reality on Discovery
I knew there was no predicting what was going on. Awesome upwards move here!
Huge congratulations! Lookin forward to the future of my favorite channel
Wow, 50k views in 15 minutes. 😲
Congratulations boys!
We all had that feeling when he was testing the throttle body
Mmmm that blazer tho. My mullet is tingling . Congrats boys
Can’t wait to see what comes next! Congratulations!
Congrats on your new adventure
This made everything that was ever bad in life, actually okay .
This actually brought a tear to my eye. Dreams are a beautiful thing. Thanks guys.
HELL YEA BROTHER!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Yes! Kick ass!!!
Woot woot! Forward thrust!!!!!
I've been awake all night waiting to hear the news!
I thought there was something going on with Motion when I saw the huge Motion stickers on the side of mullet
the dislikes are from the EPA
congrats
“Check it’s vibe” 😂😂😂😂😂
Hell yea brother! Stoked for the future
Congrats!
The ev is the future
SOOOO PUMPED!!!!!
Hell yeah brother!!!!!!
WE MUST PROTECT THESE YOUNG MEN AT ALL COST BOYS!!!!!!
I was thinking the announcement was the development of a special fast growing grass for the infield at FF. Boy was I wrong.  Awesome news Cleetus and team! Thanks for your content!
Huge congrats boys well deserved 👍👍👍
Man I'm so excited for yall as well as the racing community.  The skys the limit for McFarland racing family such an innovator & entrepreneur.  Couldn't be happier for all of yall☝️❤
Do they melt the scrap aluminum back down and put them back into a block form to reuse all of the pieces or do they just dispose of them?
Helllll yea brotherrrrrr!!!
I been looking at replacing my holly valve cover for one those billet covers unpainted. Nothing wrong with the holly just want that billet finish
noting for James?? (:
so pumped for you and james!!!! Hell yeah Brother!
Congrats to all!
Do they make parts for h22
well done brother. your fans from Greece
An you guys are such an inspiration never thought I'd look up to someone so much
You Merican's are like God's to my nephew.  He had no idea you'd be in Ohio with advance notice,  or I'd have been on a mini road trip from Canton to Norwalk. I've never met a kid with more enthusiasm about cars & trucks. Maybe next time there is an Ohio visit I could surprise him with a little trip. I love your channel as well, although I'm burned out on cars lol. More of a Demo guy at this point in my life.  You fine folks make a lot of people cheese. Keep it up Brother. You're appreciated.  The humbleness & personality you guys bring to the table is far more than entertainment.  Hell yeah Brother. Thank u.
Wish my daddy was rich
Congrats to you and your families
The biggest of moves!!! hell yeah team! I <3 you guys, and I'm really excited that you have become such a force to be reckoned with.
HELL YEA CERTIFIED.
So u have 20% in hiring too ? I'd love to work there
How long before they do this same thing with Texas Speed lol?
Next on cleetus the freedom line of detailing supplies
Hell yeah man best of luck to you and the team
Love this
You can hear the baby Bald Eagles in the background! 28:22
Congrats guys well deserved and hope this works well for everyone involved
I really like your commitment to things Cleetus... its always "for life" ... love that!
Is MRW going to use Cleetus' investment to buy more (bigger/faster) CNC machines?
Congrats dudes. I was thinking you should have your own machine shop
I hope HAAS makes better CNC machines then f1 cars😂😂
I thought Cleetus and ksr performance and fabrication but Cleetus in motion 🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
Holy shit! Awesome!
Gentlemen......Well Phucking Done!!!
MMMMM that sweet sweet sound of a delicious machine shop, damn I miss it sooo much.
Hell yeah brother congrats cleetus
Congratulations boys, this was not what I expected. I honestly feared the worst but this is nothing but great news. Hell yeah brother 🤘🦅
Is Motion Raceworks American made? Damn good purchase boys
Welp I’d say Cooper fucked up by not staying with the boys
I did not predict this move, but this is super awesome! It's good to see you making smart financial moves to be able to make money post youtube whenever you decide to hang it up.
LETS GO!!!!
14:56 so that's how it's done aye 🤣🤣
Hell yeah brother!!!! This is amazing!  Congrats guys...Looking forward to the future with Cleetus and James!
Hell yeah, time to support our boy. Looking forward to buy something from MRW
HELL YEAH BROTHER
Newest addition to motion raceworks will be the jack stand Jimmy Nitrous system
God I was so scared this was some motor trend bullshit
Motion Raceworks abreviated is just like MacFarland Racing. MR
Fun “fact”: Did you know that these throttle bodies were stock parts on the Mercury Marauder! 😁
Can I get parts for my 97 Honda Accord? Ill buy whatever I can, while sporting my Murica Straw hat and bald eagle sunglasses. Cleet and team you all are the only group of people I can't WAIT to give my money to.
well I guess now we know why Mullet had the giant Motion Race Works sticker on it, but nothing else other than the KSR one.
So cool to see this parterneship taking off. Im a cnc machinist myself. I run a HAAS ST 25 and Okuma L470 daily! Keep up the awesome work guys
Personal R and D car, name it randy
How does anyone thumbs down this video LOL!?!?!  The steps to sustainability for the long term is key.  Good moves by Doug DeMuro and Cleetus the past year.
this is awesome for you guys, congrats. also, you really need to be miced up in all your videos sooooo much better. I can actually hear jackstand
Where your product come from Cleetus?  Is this American steel or imported shit?  We got enough imported junk cloggin our lines in this day.  Keep it in the USA man.
I think it's kinda cold that Cooper isn't a part of this.
What a cool pass!!!!!👍👍👍
That’s an amazing addition to both companies love excitement and y’all are going to dominate the racing world. Again congrats to all parties and just makes using motion parts that much better.
Oh hell brother!!!
Awesome Cleetus.  I/We are soo proud of how far you have come. You and the team deserve this.  Again...AWESOME  and CONGRATULATIONS!!! Love from NZ.
Congrats
Elbow andy
Does this mean your career as mechanic at JH Diesel is over?
I thought this would be him saying he bought Sick Seconds.. but this is cool too.
So happy for you guys! The beginning was just heartwarming though! That's wicked!!😁😊
Way to go Cleetus! Reinvesting into the company that helped you start it all is a super move! Very impressed! Glad for you and Motion Raceworks! Thanks for sharing!
those 90deg couplers  are $500 yikes !
The real question is will this stuff fit in your honda
Do I see a Roadkill style parking lot build with Finnegan coming soon?
Congrats Cleetus and James!!!!!!!
Congratulations dude,   I'll make sure you get my money when applicable.
I frickin love the tractor flappers
Dang professionals
Parchute handles should've said slow down brother 😁
That’s awesome! Congratulations guys!
That's one way to get your parts cheaper buy part of the company.
Nice i might get some Parts for my 1972 Buick skylark And my 1969 Buick skylark custom
Tbh this isn’t what I was expecting I really thought this was going to be something totally different, but now you have your hand in owning A parts company I think everything should be running 6’s by the end of the year hahah
Fire me up!!!! Man you are a true freakin legend. From whistles in exhaust to this. Goes to show you can never dream to big! True inspiration bro!!
I seriously thought cleet was gonna take 20% of the turbskis!
Been waiting on this video to drop lets gooooo
Now that you own part of motion race works when are you buying part of grass company
I sure hope jackstand is getting in on some of these generational wealth deals that cleet has been getting into!!
I figured you and jackstand were announcing your wedding
Man think is they did a Y shaped @11:13 on that  5 axis for the twin turbo cars
Will you be adding a golden retriever to the motion packing staff?
Dude yes amazing!
I wish people would make cool parts for very unusual cars.
Proud of ya guys!
Congratulations! This isn't the news I was guessing or even hoping for. #Motortrend
Does James get 5 percent in this deal or 10 percent
So proud of the success you have achieved.
Well hell yeah, brother!!!!!
That is HUGE! Best company in the business in my mind!
Great job guys can’t wait for the next level
So proud of what you guys do with the money you make from this channel. Instead of buying Lambos and mansions and giving away Teslas you invest in American manufacturing. Hell yeah brother!
Daaaaamnnn! Thats gunnna be a moveeee
Hell yeah brother. Great news!
“Can we get a video of James just like squirtin shit”😂😂
RIP me who thought you bought an actual Giraffe for the FF
O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light, What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there, O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream, ’Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave! And where is that band who so vauntingly swore, That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion A home and a Country should leave us no more? Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave, And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave. O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand Between their lov’d home and the war’s desolation! Blest with vict’ry and peace may the heav’n rescued land Praise the power that hath made and preserv’d us a nation! Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto - “In God is our trust,” And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
I thought you were buying a drag strip.
Now you just need Motion to start manufacturing Coyote parts :)
Holy shit. I live in DeWitt
Absolutley Beutiful<3
I used to build vertical mills 3 axis and 5 axis at Mazak USA in ky.
next you should do aircraft  and submarines and bikes as your next projects
If ya keep making smart business moves like this, I won't be able to call you a mullet wearin' hick !!
But what about Cooper that helped you get to were you are today??
30 minute ad for a  machine shop that will go down just like your race cars bc of rpm act. keep ignoring it, its working for you.
You need to send some of these things to Matt Happel.
Thank god it wasnt a pregnancy 🙏
this is like one of those deals that Cooper should have never left lol
"Just representin'" huh...? The stickers on the El Camino suddenly make sense.... XD  Congrats and good luck. Keep her flat and bring the roar!
When does Jackstand get his signature series????
Congrats cleet and jack stand!
Alrighty then, good thing i didn't do a real bet because i thought this video would be about something completely different. Either way, congrats you guys, the only way is up!
I’m a machinist and I wish I lived near motion so I could work there
Hell yeah now we can do a build on practically any car? Heck even a Toyota Camry
Congrats!!! Much needed and this will go a long way 😎🇺🇸
Hell yeah brother! Congrats on the big moves!
Hell yeah brother congratulations
smart business plan
Definitely a huge fire me up!!
What about cooper?
Man I bet that was best freedom feeling burnout you've ever done Congrats
Awesome!!! This'll be a great partnership!!!👍👍
I work at a propane and gas and welding company and every once and a while motion raceworks tanks come in so this is pretty awesome now
Hi from Canada, Good job friends , will love to work were dog's allow work too
You should make limited edition jack stan jack stands
Go fast in your beater with parts from Cleeter: Motion Race Works. cut scene and a wrap.
3:00 , this is actually how he signed the contract
Now you need to hold an event somewhere in the area for us folks up north!
I’m buy your stuff!
That block getting machined down to the tube reminds me of the looney tunes toothpicks made from a log. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn4k2TPIJf0
You guys are Rad!  Congrats!
good for you boys!
You need to back up I built this shit lmao!!!!
Nice and congrats!  Keep the pressure on!  Pass the RPM ACT!
Cletus goes Corporate Lol it was only a matter of time
Hell yea brother, talk about investing in what you love!!!!
This guy is the smartest business person on YouTube without question. His investment in the FF has unlimited potential, he has barely scratched the surface on that investment so far. This investment in Motion is another great move for the future and stability of his BUSINESS. I think my favorite thing about Cleetus is how he brings his people up with him, the way he appreciates and acknowledges James as an important part of his channel. Cleet has it going on, super stoked for him.
Kevin was being sneaky and dropping a hint when he asked how much motion paid for the sticker on mullet lol
damn i thought he got hid pilot license
Cleet is putting that half of a law degree to good use.
Happy for y’all.  Can I get a job
How long til Jackstand convinces them to make a billet nitrous bottle now that they have keys?
Best Rangers Work For Build Every Equipment For Duty, Nice Sliding Cars Show , Congratulation Be More Successful For Engineering Workshop Bro, .... God Bless All, ..... Cheerio.🌠☁️🚗☁️🌠👍👍👍🌠🌠🌟🌠🌠.
Smart to make ur investment b4 the wedding
It has to be illegal to have a Florida man in a machine shop. Owning part of the place is just unacceptable.
Congratulations 🇺🇸🎊
So happy for you !!!!!! Since I'm a machine mechanic  Love this
HELL YEA BROTHER!!! This is epic
When the dopey car YouTube Channels are buying Lambo's, McLaren's, massive houses and shoving it in your face (you paid for it), this guy buys a track for the people and race car parts for the racers.  You can think the Cleetus McFarland Shtick is stupid but this guy is smart enough to give back to his viewers.  I just finished watching Adam LZ fleet update, nothing wrong with just buying cars but that's not a long-term business model......this is.
Congratulations team Cleetus McFarland! This is fantastic news!
Congrats cleet can't wait to see where you will be in 20 years
RPM act will destroy you so  fast lol GL goober. you stayed out of politics with your 2.5 mil subs you chose to walk away from the rpm  act threat. LMAO the epa goes for shops that make parts too lol idiots.
great job making it happen
Hell yeah brother!!!
Awesome news. Motion race works is a great company and can only go further with you guys involved
Coulda sworn he was buying Florida
LoL could you imagine Cleetus doing and episode of undercover boss!!!  Be hilarious
Poor Cooper lol
Super cool. Best car channel for the world.
Well shiz, now he's got two Freedom Factories!
Developed By Us, Tested By Us, Proven By Us, Broken By Us, And Made In The USA
congratulations cleetus and james and next vlog about how cleetus meet madi ??

This mans craked the code. Invest in racecar parts reinvest everytime he breaks his racecar.
Clicked fasted then me burning sun rubber at a cletus n cars
Ladies and gentlemen, you're witnessing Automotive history! This won't just stop here! Cleet will be a big name in the American automotive history! Will get his own bio in the YT encyclopaedia (donut media).

You know you made it when you start sponsoring the businesses that used to sponsor you...
Oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave For the land of the free And the home of the brave 🦅🇺🇸
Motion raceworks sales after this video 📈📈📈
1st subject to discuss for motion RW is get rid of the junk haas machines and buy some mazaks

Motion Raceworks - A division of McFarland Fab
Mcfarland raceworks FTW!
love it. Good moves.
Big ups to liquid Richard and cleeter
Been waiting for this video
the greatest thing to happen since the invention of the race car
Cleeter making Made in America great again
Totally pumped for Cleet although I don’t do v8’s, so this isn’t as exciting for me.
FRIKEN FIRE ME UP
As much as I love this channel and respect Garret so much for his hard work and how he treats people, I hope the channel doesn't turn into a giant commercial. A episode like this one every once in a while is fine but I hope it isn't just a look at our new item all the time.
Cleetus trying to weld was hilarious. :Edit love the blue!
Ive been a fan since you guys put the turbo whistles on the c7  exhaust to watch this channel grow and never lose steam makes me extremely proud to be a fan I literally talk about the cars and some of the ridiculous stuff you guys do all the time. Congratulations guys
Was driving and got the notification.... I will say the pedal went down to the floor so I could get to my stop sooner lol
I had to watch it at 1.5 speed because if you’re not going fast you’re already last. Also, this is amazing.
" HELLLL YEAAAA!! BROTHA!! "
Let's goooooo
Great new! Great partnership!
Hell yeah brother this is the best collaboration and investment yet to date.
Didn't know that Florida Men supported Haas F1 team! ;p Hope they aren't supporting Mazipin though! lmao
Hell yeah brother!
Just when you think it can't get any better... Cleetus: *Hold my billet throttle body 90*
That 90 is very nice.   That'll be something I grab soon
AWSOME!!!!
Absolutely killing it!!
This is so much better than what I thought was coming
Okay second comment.  Can we start an auction for that axle piece( possibly wrong) that James and cleet welded
Just seems like a 32 min merch plug now
Rob dahm: I bought a CNC to build an engine Cleetus McFarland: hold my bartle skeet
Hell yeah I had a feeling it was a Matter of time before something happened between yall
Hell yeah brother! So pumped for you guys. That intro brought a tear to my eyes. I’m not happy with where I’m at as a dealership technician and want to make a change. Maybe I should just go for it and open my own place and try to grow my channel...
Kudos to you sir for investing in the America heartland.  Got some friends and family that have been machinist there whole career.  Its amazing the work and craftsmanship that go into making these parts.  Something about turning something out like these parts that gives you appreciation into the work that goes into all this!
McFarland Motion Machinists!!!
I waiting for you go buy Bradenton Motorsports
Goose bumps man! So proud of you guys! Hell ya brother
Good to see you investing in your local manufacturing operations
Yo cleatus I been following you for about 2 years now and I have to say you and James are thru inspiration you have taking everything and everyone with you to the next level everytime and this time uffff skies is the limit.
Wow congratulations on your  Successful move.we as your fans are very proud of your success in life and thank you for take us in the journey of your life
Will you make some cleetus valve covers for small block chevy’s? (Non-LS)
I mean it’s cool. But way more hyped up than it needed to be. FF was way more important and cooler. This is kinda like eh.
Cleetus proving everyday, that if you're too big to do the little things, you're too little to do the big things.
Like there products just wish they make Mopar stuff
5:50 Lucas...or _Seth Rogan???_
You know what - I can't even watch the rest. This is some terribhle camera work.
There's not gonna be anymore freedom left pretty soon.
Cleetus, I'm a professional mechanical designer and I need a new job. Hire me.
Hell Yeah Duddeeee! Congrats!
Hell yeah brother congrats
14:56 funniest sht ever 🤣👏😂. Congrats on your new collaboration 💪🏆
This is an amazing announcement!  Congrats fellas. I cant wait to see you guys go to the moon!!!!  Happy guy right here!!!!
Hell yeah brother
Awesome! Now get them to do Mopar/Gen III Hemi stuff!
Hell yes
Hell yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!
I guessed purchasing Texas Speed, wasn’t too far off.
Fuck yeah boys let's gooooo
When does the Florida facility open? 👀👀
Congrats boys, that's excellent.
38 miles from my house
Big move for your pockets, but not for the channel.. Gz.
Nice one boys!
"We don't check timing where we're going" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Enough to make a grown man cry 😢
"Cayote parts.. Oh nevermind" ahhahaa
I could see the conversation cleetus and James we want to do a burnout from the shop to the parking lot to permit motion ok u have to buy 20 percent and u can do it
Congratulations Cleetus, you have come a long way from the procharged leased Dodge Ram. I have enjoyed every minute of your content for years now. I can't wait to see what you do next. Thank you for all the entertainment. We love you guys!
Best of luck man
Exciting. BUT, what about the RPM Act? 🎃
This is stupid exciting guys! So happy and proud of yall!
Nice deal! is this going to affect your relationship with TSP?
BADASS!
This is the best partnership in the history partnerships!
So .... the baby will be name Motion or RaceWork? :P
Bad ass, definitely going to grow in a massive company!
Makes sense now. I'd always rep my own company on my car! 🤣
I'm so glad the announcement wasn't a TV show. WHEW!
Wow man. Good for you. So proud
That’s awesome
👍👍
Dude I think this is crazy awesome I remember back when you were just getting started with this channel. And to think that you have got this far really makes me feel like I can definitely do anything if I put my time heart and effort towards my dreams. I love this man congratulations you guys! ✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Demand for Motion Raceworks parts just increased.  Its crazy to see where you guys have gone, I was around for turbo whistles, duck calls, and Ed the neighbor.. we met at SCT ATL in 2016 (I think) and talked about grad school cause we were both students at the time. Awesome to see good things happen for good people.
This is so satisfying
Good for you bro.
Congrats to you Cleeter and Jackstand! This is a huge step and another building block to your empire.
Hell. Ya. Brother. One of the reasons i love this channel is that i see yall constantly making the next big step. Youtube might not be your revenue stream in 30years, so yall are making big moves to secure your future and i respect the hell out of that. Between the track and now this, yall arent going anywhere! 👌
Ok so now how's that dropping out of law school looks now. Thanks for letting us join in your SUCCESS.
Problem you’ll now have is anytime anything breaks/blows up (you know it happens lots) motion raceworks will be blamed as you’ll be totally associated with it…
The sticker on Mullet is not too big anymore LOL
Very good move guys been here since day one and seeing how much u guys have done is amazing and very motivating for people now and days. Keep it up 👍 shout out from northern Washington
Congratulations!  Is the Summit Racing van now for sale?🤣
Congrats to team Cleetus!
V-band clamps will forever be known as cleetus clamps.
If you need a great hook up on carbide tooling dm me I work for carbide depot and we would love to get y'all tooled. I'm so fucking excited for you
Cooper fucked up leaving 😆
Holy......shiznit.....
This is great and the bits done on phones/gopro's are watchable. Please leave Chris and his super-blur wobble cam to doing wraps.
I'll find a way to put some Cleetus parts on my H3 😂
Out of all the investments Garret has made for the channel, Jack Stand Jimmy has to be the best so far.
You had me thinking you might have sold out to some corporate network or something. I should have more trust in old Cleeter. Dude knows what's up. True Floridaman.
This is so badass. Way cooler than I could have imagined!
Incoming next beg for money video because we made a smart business decision followed by buying a jet powered roller coaster for Cletus' house
Couldn't be happier for you and your team!
I wonder how this partnership works? As far James share etc
Day 1 subscriber here. Every time I see your channel/empire advance it fills my heart. It inspires me so much to see you creating and living a life that you love while reminding me to do and be better. You show us how to have fun and be successful while remaining grounded and being a genuinely nice guy.  Fun first, business second. I see you. Putting fun first is actually the smartest business move you ever made for this channel. You deserve everything that comes your way and I wish you the best in this new venture. I will never not be a fan of this channel. I'm not a follower of ANYTHING. I don't follow sports or other youtubers or anything really. I focus on my own lane. But I follow you guys religiously.   Thank you for everything you do. Hell yeah brother!
I've never clicked on a video so fast
Congratulations guys, great move.
A lot of support from your fans, that's what you'll have on these big moves.
Awesome move, Hell Yeah Brother!
Congrats to both you and jackstand. I love how far you guys have come. I remember when you started with 1320 video, I hope you guys do nothing but bigger and better things.
Cleeter, you and James should go to the JRE podcast. It'd be so cool to hear the whole story of how it al picked up for you guys
God bless cleetus mcfarland and the entire mcfarland racing team
Being a former machinist and car lover this video is an absolute treat
HELL YEA BROTHER!!!
Boxer dogs 🕶
Does Motion make any products for an L76
Imagine the lawyer's face when he heard a freaking Giraffe was coming in to sign some papers on a business deal.
Yeah brother
Im just really happy for James, he was just a regular mechanic guy (nothing wrong with that) now hes going to be smth bigger
HELL YA BROTHER!  KEEP GROWING
Do they melt scraps down and then re mold them??
cooper deserves to be here
So freaking badass!!!!
Congratulations, brother. Well deserved and only you truly know how much hard work it took to get here.
Can’t believe they were 4 miles from my house and I didn’t even know 🙁
There goes all your Summit Bucks😂😂😂
It’s reasons like this that keep me a loyal fan this man isn’t just a YouTube tool he’s a businessman and he’s also humble. I’m in, as long as this channel is here, I’ll be here.
As if I didn't already wanted to get a gang of parts from Motion already, this makes me want to buy some freedom parts even that much more!!!! Hell yeah to growing brother!! 🤙🤘
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BIDEN BANS FREEDOM AND SCREAMIN' EAGLES?? -- "LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET INTO THE BLACK-MARKET!!"---- CLEETUS -N- JAMES
That's awesome 🤙
Bald eagles are screaming everywhere right now. Congratulations 👏
Only a matter of time before ole cleet and co have their own line of motors. I can dig it.
Love how he includes Jackstand in his dreams to do this as long as they can!
I feel like with the transition to EV picking up I wonder how smart this investment will seem in years to come.
So I guess this channel is R&D of Motion Raceworks.. 😅 without knowing it..
Yoooooo let's gooooooooo
That’s a big ol’ Fire Me Uppp!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
A lot of Paper Weights once Petroleum is Obsolete.
FREEDOM INTESIFIES
Cleeter and Jackstand, you badasses are living the dream of all us gearheads. Brilliant move buying into Motion Raceworks
Congratulations brother, been here before 1m, you put in the work you reap the rewards. I got goosebumps. Hell yeah brother, yall deserve it.
make sure they answer their email, since they never responded to mine
Andrew Hieber said it first 😎👏👏👏
Way to go congrats to u guys
Congratulations on the new business venture
Congrats, you guys have an impressive record of sensible moves where it counts, with a dash of dumb moves where it won't hurt nobody. No longer "All blown up", now you're "All grown up" :) but let's face it, also All blown up as well...
Hell yeah brother!!!! Congratulations guys!
Congrats dude! Made in the USA and tested full bald eagle by Cleetus himself, you know they are gonna hold up!
Can I get a valve cover for a 22 RE
McFarland Racing = MR Motion Raceworks = MR McFarland Racing shirt has MR on the front. Prophecy has been revealed.
Well done, a very significant and healthy decision for the channel and for the best damn version of Motorsport I've seen!  Go Cleetus and James. You absolute beasts!
I knew you weren't going to Motor Trend. I never doubted you. * *wipes sweat from brow* *
So McFarland Raceworks shirts are in the queue?
This is a big risk with the RPM act going through not a sure thing.
From owning your own track to change the game in racing to now producing your own parts #LEGENDARY
Nice!
Goose bumps
MERICA!
I guessed TV show. I'm happier with this. He'll yeah brother! 🇺🇸
Yeahhh you just became a multi multi millionaire
Hell Yeah!!  Motion Raceworks killin it everyday!!
What CAD/CAM are they using???
Man that's awesome. I'm a machinist but I make widgets, would be amazing to make automotive stuff.
Congratulations guys big moves live your dreams!
Man, now I see why you want the RPM bill signed. Congrats man!
I love how within the first minute there was almost 400 views already.    Great job team.  Lol
That's gooder than a goddamn...
Congrats Cleetus..This is a great bold move you and your team
Beyond the great content. Yall are really great at making business moves for growth. Been seeing that over the years.
Huge move Cleetus very cool & going to be massive for you & your team. Congrats 👏
Congratulations!!!  But I have to say the beginning of this video made me think of  Callahan Autoparts   a bit.  A big guy with a big dream.
Congrats Cleeter!!!!! So stoked to see how you continuously push forward in the most wholesome and awesome ways!!!
I figured he was having a kid
Dude! Love this!!!!! Congrats and we expect big things!!!!!
This is pretty badass
Glad you came to Iowa to support our local businesses! Keep up the good work! Also good luck this week on your racing!

Glad to be this early for once, so happy for you guys
Awesome.  This appeals to the older racing generation
Look at all that virgin concrete he's striping!
I have a 5 axis!!
Does the Bald rEagle still have Ruby's old heart in it or is it a different one?
chip fan in the valve cover segment :)
subtractive manufacturing is so time and material intensive.
WoW congratulations to you and the crew!!!! What a life!!!!!
Lettttssssss gooooooooooo!!!!!
It's funny how the RPM's changing his voice when he picks up that big chunk of aluminum
Sounds awesome :D my only query is that you seem to be setting up an automotive business when there is a switch away from petrol power to EV - new petrol powered cars aren't going to be sold again in the UK in about 9 years time. Just thinking about things long term!
i about shit my pants when you threw the aluminum cube, and the dude almost dropped it  hahahaha
Love to see you guys grow. When I met you we were both bachelors. Now my wife of 3 years and 14 month old son watch your videos. Btw Maddie is a keeper brother! So proud of your personal and business decisions. Had a blast at the Freedom Factory and you still treated me the same as you did years ago. If anybody deserves to live the dream, its people like you Garrett.
Congratulations.
«Doug is a pretty nice guy» from yesterday is more funny now. Kevin!
Congrats mate. Really happy for you and your crew. Let the Bold Eagles scream forever!!!!
Hell ya!!!
Hope Cooper doesn't regret certain life choices.
Hell ya brother!!!!!!!!!
Super excited for you guys! Smart move guys.👍
Hell yeah!
What happened to Cooper?
Where's the beef?
RIP Texas Speed, there’s a new sheriff in town. When are y’all dropping blocks?
Hell yeah, brother.  Thank you for all of the work you do.
America Frick yeah!!!
Im glad this was not another show~ youtube channel bullshit......    good for you to invest all this youtube money while it lasts.
You guys need to be machining your American made car parts with our American made cutting tools. We have some kick ass aluminum cutters we design in house
As someone who has watched since you bought Leroy...FIRE ME UP
The comment about the size of the MRW decal on Mullet and the "it's growing on me" make more sense :)
Owns 20% of the company, does 100% of the work :D
Excited for you guys. I was scared about the update.
“Let it rip brother, can I stare at it?”  Lmfao 🤣
He'll yea brotherrrrrrrrrrrr this is great!!!
Congratulations 🎉 Bro
I figure it out Monday with your car having Motion in big letters on your new camino
3 words "hell ya brother"
Thank God you didn't sell out like the roadkill guys.
Dam was hoping for a zoo lol but happy as hell for you guys cant wait to see how much bigger your builds get and how much faster you guys can go love you guys best of luck
You know the deal!
Motion Raceworks is about to change the game with the Cleeter stamp 💪🇺🇲
Keeping killin it cleet 🙌🏽
Hass logo on the the machines?
I would love to be the first to be sponsored by Cleetus/Motion race works on my Front yard LS swapped 98 Tacoma
Congratulations man so proud of you and James so proud so excited for your new adventure Motion weeks works is always had your back
Can we get parts up in canada?? Fleet I need your parts on my truck but what's the shipping and wait time gonna be like? I'm building my dream truck currently, my dad had the same truck down to the colour
Freaking legendary!!! Got goose bumps!! HELL YEAH BROTHER
Man this so awesome! Even more of a reason to buy from Motion!
This channel only makes power moves
“Can we get a video of James just like squirting shit” 😂😂
This is awesome!  You have one incredible partner in James Taal!
Hell yeah brother!!!!!! Absolutely amazing I knew it was something biggger than some damn helicopter lol
That’s huge! Good job and good luck!
That was a pretty solid opening burnout!!
Oh theyre boxer people i am sold
They should rebrand as Mullet Raceworks.
CONGRATS GUYS!!!!!
Ahhhh yep...then walks away 😂
congratulations guys, watched from the very start. now time for more memories. all the way from bonnie scotland
You, James, Doug and the motion race works team will make an amazing team and I cannot wait to see what comes of this
Congrats fellas!
Now I know what part manufacturing company to buy from when I turn 16 years old.
Made in the great USA. And this is where freedom rocks!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
NOYCE BROTHER 🇦🇺 .... HELL YEAH BROTHER 🇺🇸
Subscriber - Fan and CNC programmer for 25+ years!
I've been a machinist for 28 years.  I have 8 HAAS machines, 3 are 5th axis and a robot.  Dogs come to work as well.  Good job guys
God bless you enjoy the ride be safe blessing to your biggest family you just inherited.your blessed.
Let’s gooo
Did have a feeling it was something like this after seeing the huge motion stickers on mullet 😂
Better get some crown Vic parts
Hell yeah Iowa in the house.
🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪👍👍👍🚀🚀🚀🌚🌚🌚🤞🤞🤞
Hell yeah brother 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Hell yeah brother!
You did it. You guys are manufacturing bald eagles right here in the USA.
HOLY SHIT this is fucking HISTORY IN THE MAKING
At least you didn't pull a Demo move and hit the garage door burning out.
HELL YEAH BROTHER  well i know when i get my car where to get my parts from thanks guys for the videos and making life better for people love you guys keep up the good would and the bald eagles
Only 20% yikes..  I can see business problems down the road. Anybody that has owned a business and has had business partners knows what I'm talking about. So that being said, goodluck!
I gotta say Cleet, this is a big move! Motion is about to be booming harder than ever! What a smart move, the sky is the limit!!
MERICA!!!!! HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!!!!!!!!
Head machininst Lucas smiles like Seth Rogan.  I love it.
No wonder Cooper quit your channel. You're going nowhere ;)
I am SO happy this wasn’t another subscription based content money grab! You guys are the shit. Please be the shit forever ❤️
HAAS IN DA HOUSE
I was wondering what was up with the big motion sticker on mullet lol
All the guesses in the comments yesterday were so wrong congratulations  Brothers
Congratulations. Happy for you guys.    You guys should be proud of your accomplishments.  Keep digging.
What about Texas speed? They still with you?
I need a steering column for a second gen Chevy s10 motion only makes them for a first gen and third 😢
i was happy i was able to catch this before work
I hope the Haas machines perform better than the F1 team
Things like this really put into perspective just how beneficial hard work really is. I remember when you were just some giraffe of a dude filming shit with 1320 and now here we are.. Owner and ripper of your own track and officially putting out your own line of absolute unit pieces. Who tf is cutting onions in here!?
Typically, when a YouTuber says they have a "big announcement" it is virtually always a massive letdown. This did not disappoint. Congratulations gentlemen, this is in fact a big 'ol deal. Hell yea Brother!
Interesting move to buy motion race works shares as opposed to investing in the FF. Hopefully it generates more money in the long term for the team
Do you make valve covers for a small block Chevy?
I've been machining for years and live not too far from motionraceworks. I've thought about submitting an app before. This makes me want too even more now.
Hell yea brother 🇺🇸
Fastest I've ever clicked on a notification. So great to see where y'all are now compared to the track anouncer I met years back... This is an awesome move! Keep up the great work!
Cool, smart move. Invest in something that you can help grow. Cleet is on the board of something. Now drop the price 10% and increase volume, you might bring in more single unit dollars. On the Cleetus home grown parts series.
So your taking other people’s parts putting your name on it calling it yours sounds like you guys are selling out to me just went from freedom factory to Uncle Sams factory now ughhhhhh
Still funny to me people keep thinking these guys are going to sell out.
Cleatus for president!!
Congrats buddy.
Hell yeah brother!
Hell ya brother
Congrats! Doug and his team are fantastic people! For a nobody to feel like somebody when dealing with questions is refreshing.
Hell fu$#*ng yeah brother this is so awesome!!!!!
🤟🏻😜🤟🏻
Congrats that’s awesome
I've already been buying mostly all motion raceworks products, but now it's my main choice.
Very smart business move and that explains the stickers on Mullet
Huge news and im here 13 minutes after posted!!
congratulations brother
And here I was thinking Cleet was going to be a dad 😂
Would someone be so kind as to give me a TLDR? I’m at work and can’t watch for 6 hours! :(
BUD PLEASE JUST TAKE IN CONSIDERATION THAT YOUR NAME AND BRAND AND CHANNEL IS NOW 100% CONNECTED TO MOTION RACE WORKS IF THEY GET A BAD REP SO DO YOU AND PLEASE BE CAREFUL OF THE TAX MAN WEN THEY DO BAD BUSINESS THEY WILL COME AFTER ALL OF YOU BUT WHAT ITS WORTH TO YOU I WISH YOU GUYS ALL THE LUCK AND MAY GOD BELL THIS BUSINESS AGREEMENT TO THE BONE AND WE ARE VERY PROUD OF YOUR SUCCESS BUD🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Cleetus "What am I going to do with all this money so Uncle Sam does not take it all?"  Accountant "Invest in making more capital"
Soooo Coop may have messed up walking away.....
HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!!
Hell Yeah! Congrats! Love to see people invest in what they believe in.
I normally finish my day with a Cleet video, but this was so big I had to watch asap, great news.
Called it! Thats gonna be great for the channel and for motion race works! 2 great elements coming together for an awesome outcome! Now hopefully motion might start making a few ford parts for neighbor and the rest of us???
yay im excited for you
SO SICK!! 🤘🇺🇸
Hell yeah!
Was concerned you were selling out in a bad way. Thank the good lord and all the bald eagles, ever! Stay true, brothers! Much love!
So glad to see you guys growing and solidifying the Cleetus legacy. Awesome stuff.
Guess it's time to swap the frs to an LS.
Atta boy good for you guys so happy for you.
You put a little Easter egg in your last video. 😆 (How much are they paying you to have their stickers on your car?) 😆🤣😂
*CLEETUS IS SO DAMN PROUD OF YOU GUYS 🇺🇲*
Did he say MADE IN AMERICA
Stoked for this, not only made in the USA, but made in IOWA!
Awesome guys! Good luck! 🍀
Great move! Motion is a great company.
Was expecting a Dew full ride, but hey, this is still cool as fuck 👌👌🇺🇲
Smart business decision.  Well done cleet
Very Cool Bro
Hell yeah brother! AMAZING NEWS! 👏
Hell yeah brother Cleeter Mcskeeter!!!!!!!
FIRE ME UPPPP!!!!!
Thank god it’s not something with a negative side. Garrett knows business, as long as Jackstand Jimmy, his wifey, himself, and madi are happy, I’m as happy as a pig in the bog! JH wooooooooooo!
is it 7075 or 6061?
So glad you're not going to cable tv
Now, if the only made 2v 5.4 parts. Im trying to turn a turd into a princess 🤣
Congratulations guys very very happy for y’all success
Good luck guys!!!
Living the dream!
Congrats y'all now I need a car to put this stuff on 🤣
Hell yea Texas speed and motion race works are about to be tops dogs across the world
Hell yeah brother!
Wasn't expecting that he said something that will change the channel etc this won't change fhe channel and doesn't effect us at all lol just more money in their pocket but very good idea shoipd always invest money buy into companies of things you enjoy I wish I had the money to do that
Hell yeah
Hell yeah brother 🤘🏽🇺🇸🦅
McFarland Fabrication leveled up!
OMFG make Nissan sentra parts!!!
was expecting something a little more insane..
Hell yeah 🤜💥🤛🇺🇸
I noticed HAAS on a lot of those machines... Is MRW in cooperation with Haas F1?
Let’s freakin goooooooooo
Dude epic investment! Wish I could get a job there lol
So disappointed in what the announcement was I shut the video off. Who cares that you now own 20 percent of a company that will continue to do what they've been doing. Congratulations on adding to your portfolio and increasing your wealth, but honestly idgaf.
HELL YEAH BROTHER!
9:20 had me laughing so hard 😂😂😂
Okay that was waaaay smaller than what I expected after Cleetus hyped it up so much but somebody is definitely getting a nice chunk of cash upfront plus a revenue share for the parts. Good for him!
Shop needs some improvement...
I was wondering who would source my next build.  Now I know.
Big announcement guys
I buy a lot from motion race works and now I’m going to buy more much love cleetus and jack stand
HELL YEA BROTHER!!!
Man this is sick. I love to see you guys succeed. I've watched religiously since the Leroy supercharger build series and this is a wild ride
The suspense was killing me
That intro reminds me of Tegridy Farms on South Park That was friggin awesome man what a great move
Are you adding a link from the merch store web site to the motion race work website? So it’s one easier shopping
Not the biggest move ever like was baited but cool.   Next diversify into something non auto.   Commercial space with rental units for other trades and your shop would be a good play and diversifies from the racing world.
Hell yeah brother! This is what I’m talking about! It’s about time you guys got to be able to do this! Makes me happy for you two. Honestly. Been watching you guys improve for 3 years- loving every minute of it. Here’s to many more years- and car parts that need replacin’. Y’all deserve this 🇺🇸🦅
FIRE US UP DUDE!!!!!
Who knew Seth Rogan was pumping out racecar parts? 👀😅
Awesome move guys, 👏
That comment about the sticker makes sense now. Rofl
Most American thing i have ever seen🥲
Everything in Iowa is awesome welcome to one of the most underrated states in America!!!
I was thinking this because he had the stickers on mullet and I thought that was a little suspicious but good for you guys
MERICA!!🇺🇸
This made me so happy!! Congrats!!
You had me scared yesterday but this is amazing news! HELL YEA BROTHER!
You got to be kidding me!!! You're making the right moves!!!!!! Congratulations!!!
Haas in the house!
Hell yea brother
From stealing kyles corvette and sticking a lawn mower in the back, to this. Ultimate success story
Congrats Cleet and team!  I have been thinking about a build and was going to use MRW for parts but now I have no choice but to go through with it as I will now be supporting the man living my dream of owning a racetrack!
Whooooooo man I got the chills you are incredible man hell yeah
Gonna be frickin awesome need to make some crown vic parts hell yeah brother
That billet has me drooling :)
This is basically what i do all day cnc machining is so satisfying
So that's why the motion race works sticker was so big
thats bad ass congrats man
Congrats.  Two Amazing car people. Doug keep making the best Ls parts to date! Garret keep killing that you tube game! You have my support.
Need Gen 3 hemi stuff!
HELL YEAH BROTHERRRRR!!!!
Congrats and can't wait to see what the future brings!!
Cleet and James - WE NEED ALL THE PARTS Doug - Come invest with us
What a GREAT move! yeeeeeee yeeeeee!
Where the cnc turbowhistles at?
Wish you the best of luck.
This is awesome, super cool. Congrats!!!
Im soo proud of you been with you from the beginning Leroy is the best🤘
Let's gooo
And at the end of that awesome burnout someone needs to start singing the national anthem because that's American
Hell yea!!
Hell ya!
So that’s why Kevin asked if they were paying you last video 😂
Did James’s pockets make noise and his pants falling down when the tour was over ?
Hell yeah brother 🤘
Big Ups Down Under
This is gunna be legit!!! 🇺🇲💯 Just became a Motion parts guy only thing that could make this even better would be to have a location here in Florida!!! Lets Go 💯
Motion Race Works Legal team: Do we let him do a burnout now that he owns 20% of the company? PR team: Better do it!
I figured this had already happened behind the scenes since the fellas and Doug have been thick as thieves lately.
Congratulations guys, you deserve it, for all your hard work.
We need like a FLIR thermal camera to see what's going on during a burnout. Would be a nice addition for the burnout contests.
731st comment
This man is building a literal empire and it is awesome to watch.
American Men doing American Things with and American Company the American Way. Hell Yea Brother. Its nothing but blue skies in the future for Cleetus and Motion.
I thought the giant motion raceworks sticker on mullet was bigger than just showing support lol
So will they be changing their name to McFarland Fab?
I keep noticing the Haas logo everywhere. Is that just branding on the machines or?
Congrats
Explains the motion race works stickers on mullet lol
Cleetus and Cars = Mullets and Machining
Hell yeah YEE YEE
Thank God I was so scared we where about to get roadkill abandoned again.
I think you took us all by surprise on this one, congrats!
All I can say is HELL YEA BROTHER!! This is freakin awesome, I can already see my ls decked in cleetus mcfarland parts
I said it on last video….I win!
Heck yeah congratulations that's wicked news
Just don't push them to change it to "McFarland Race Works"
Cleet, you're truly an inspiration to the young generation
Ok, who called this? Not My Dew. Not buying a drag strip. He always surprises us!!!
Man you need to buy sick seconds that's the car that started it all you would do yourself a total disservice if you dont but it plus you will have one of the best engine builders in your corner Steve Morris. Plus it's the next evaluation in your racing game.
Congrates guy.   Wish I could get in business wise and sell motion parts
You know why they call Cleet giraffe when standing next to that master machinist.
Could have been 30% if Cooper didn't bail on the channel
HELL YEA BROTHER!!! I can still have a way to get my parts if this stupid green new DISASTER keeps up with their retarded regulations..
Holy hell that is nuts, very bold move but damn it's an intelligent one to move on a market you can show what's made and how well it lasts. Congrats guys you are just moving on the up and up goodluck with the future of it all.
Cleetus builds car parts for the American Working Man, because that's who he is and that's who he cares about
Not going to lie I was hoping it was Mt. Dew something... 😂
Great move, supply parts to dwindling Internal Combustion Engine aficionados, but eventually transition to performance components on electric vehicles is a must!
For a profit of course.      Just. Dsnt seem like grassroots Cleter. Seems more like a cash grab :(
I called it. Explains why you had the MR hat on, in The last episode, and the Camino was stickered up
Freedom Racing
It’s time to MAKE CAR PARTS GREAT AGAIN!  Hell Yeah Brother!
HELL YEAH CLEETER, RIP IT UP. Y'all need an IT guy?
Not the announcement I was expecting but still bad ass none the less
Liked the video before I even watched it
Explains the huge Motion raceworks sticker ! Congratulations!
Cleeter i been watching from day. I gotta say. Its good to see you doing what u enjoy and investing into yourself and company :) awesome job bro!!
So so so pumped for you guys. Keep up the good work. Raise hell, praise dale
"Hey guys I bought a percent of a company and now I'm taking credit for their parts and hard work"
No
:Chef_Kiss:
A big freedom congratulation
Congratulations guys! A perfect pair getting better everyday. HELL. YEAH. BROTHER!! High five from Long Island NY.
This is big news. Congrats Cleetus 👏👏👏
Now all Ol' Cleet needs is that Mountain Dew sponsorship and life would be good.
Now seeing this, it was expected and makes sense (both for the channel and business sense).  Congrats to you all!
Hell yeah brother loving it ❤️ from the down under 💯❤️🙌
Don't to get registered trademark.?
Happy for you guys. Cleet is out here making moves lol
“It blew up it blew up it blew up, I’m outta here peace!!”🤣🤣😭
Thought you were gonna drop the baby bomb lol. But congrats anyways to you all!
Sticker on the Elco is just right. 🤣
So Cool!!!!
I'm a CNC Programmer/Machinist. Can I get I job?
makes sense to me man good choice cant wait till i start my f150 build an to buy parts from motion
Of course I'm stuck at work with no internet connection lol
Happy y'all didn't go the Motortrend route.
What does this mean for the Texas Speed parts? I’m guessing this is just more so licensing his name than anything.
Can we just get some more build videos
Can we just get some more build videos
Cant wait till "jackstand designed, cleeter tested" parts are available for sale.
Had to pause at 2:31 Hell yah Brother love every second and everything you do
All the more reason to support the RPM Act, which provides the people's guidance to America's EPA.  It was always personal, but now it's business!
Is that 10% each or 20% each? I'm just curious
Cleeter you just gave me some gosh dang goosebumps. Killin it brother 💪🏼
Thank goodness, lol
And here am I'm thinking they were bout to announce cleeter jr. 😅🤣🤣
CONGRATS!!! It’s so exciting seeing you guys grow love the content keep it up see you guys Saturday at drift tonight can’t wait!!!
Congrats man making big moves 👍
When Kevin asked you about the motion race works on the side of El mullet, I had this gut feeling something was fishy lol. Hell yeah brother!
Way to not just fall into a groove and think the money will come forever from the track. You clearly read "Who moved my cheese?"
I am never going to financially recover from all the parts I will be buying
I knew it because he wasn't wearing an FF hat but an MW hat
That's a big Hell Yeah Brother!
While I kinda understand this move I'd have thought you'd actually get your own shop before doing something big like this since you clearly need the space with the lease on the shop you share with Jeremy running out soon and that shop also being a bit to small for all of your cars plus Jeremy's business and cars
5 dislikes were people fat fingering the like button.
Congratulations🥳
That’s awesome!!! Congratulations!!!
That’s awesome
Cleetus got his own race car parts and Nelk just got their own hard seltzer. Youtubers are getting smart with their money.
MCFARLAND RACEWORKS!!!
FIRE ME UP!
Now I need a job there. Life changing for sure.. I Love the content and the support for the racing world!!
Freaking stoked !!!
HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!  So happy it wasn't a TV show!!  Gonna be buying way too many parts for my racecar now lol
Do you house tractorflaps?
They don’t have any first dodge parts 318/340/360 ☹️
Wow ride on the backs of  other people original !
That's awesome for you and your team.
I KNEW IT!
Fire me up!!!
I'm so happy for you guys way to go Cleetus. Keep making us happy and proud of the channel. I've been here since the very first video and at that moment I would have never thought you could be serious enough in real life to grow a business the way you have and man might I say I've never been happier to be proven wrong. This channel is a household name in my home and we all love you guys.
HELL YEAH BROTHER 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Congrats Cleet and James!! Im hoping for the best towards the future and many successes for you guys!! Im really proud of you guys.
Congrats!!!

LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Next up BUY SHARES OF TEXAS SPEED
Bye bye Texas Speed..RIP What happened about the EPA ruling outlawed after markets parts by making it illegal to modify a cars engine?
32 minute video during month of freedom god damn Cleet you sure do hustle
HELL YEAH CLEEETER!  Watching your growth over the last few years not only makes me extremely jealous, but also happy for you.  Awesome stuff, looking forward to watching you build your future!
👍👍
Damn this is pretty cool. Is the freedom factory eventually going to be home to manufacturing and development for M.R.W.?
Hell yeah dude
Right in time for lunch break..
Mannnn i am pumped about this newest endeavor for you guys! Congratulations
That's really smart , now you have an other source of income. More freedom!!!
Congratulations big dog! I still remember you putting duck calls on the procharged ram 1500 🤣 good shit cleet keep the amazing content rolling!!!!!!!
I’ve never clicked faster
Brother, I have never been so proud of somebody I have never met!!!! Hell yeah brother let's go!!!!!!!!
That’s awesome man I’m happy to see you guys grow as much as you have and the part you play in the race scene. It’s been a beautiful ride this far!!!
That's a big hell yeah!!
First off, Damn! Secondly, HELL YEAH BROTHER!!! That is going to an amazing partnership!!
The big news is you bought 20% of motion works...... So this was a glorified commercial.  Right. So happy you're making even more money. Truly. Next time try not to hype it up so much like this is going to be some kind of awesome video. This was a fucking commercial
Congratulations boyz!
Dude this a crazy big fire me up bro!!!
I knew it. The 7 foot sticker on Mullet got me thinking. I mean, KSR built it. Why else would you display Motion? Congrats. I wish you all the success.
So happy for ya cleet and jackstand🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
YES SIR!!!! HELL YES!!!!!! IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS!!!!! Congrats boys. Love seeing how far you guys have come in these past few years. This is huge! Again. Congratulations Garrett and James
Next move, go with the Vargas brothes to Puerto Rico,
I think its really cool how loyal Cleetus is too the people that helped him get to where he is today.  That is a very rare quality in people today.  I'm sure Cleetus could say this is my channel and James is just an employee.  He doesn't do that though.  He and James are partners in this endeavor and I think that's awesome.
So awesome! Very proud of you guys!
Amazing work guys congratulations 👏
I only can watch a bit I'm at work but what about Texas Speed how does that work out for yo and your other sponsors?
Congrats boys yee yee gotta pin it to win it!!!!!!!!
LETS GOOOOOO
I don’t even own a race or drift car but I’m gonna have to buy something from Motion Race works to support the FREEDOM
Holy crap this is amazing!!!!
So Exciting! Looking forward to watching how it all works out.
Now that giant sticker on the side of mullet makes total sense. 🔥
Hell yeah!! To the next level 🤘🇺🇲🇺🇲
HELL YEAH! Congrats! I'm ready to see more videos to come.
My favorite part is these guys using a Quinn HarborFreight torque wrench. That’s awesome
Cleet always coming in with the rowdiest burnouts no matter the circumstance!!!!!
Hell yeah brother congratulations you guys have come so far from turbo whistles and nitrous powered fidget spinners lol 🦅🇺🇸 I’ve been watching from day one and your videos never cease to amaze me brother
Hell yeah brother
Hell yeah!!
Cooper while watching this video: why did i leave? Well ill continue with the gearbox.

Man, I'm just glad that it's not some dumb tv deal. That stuff seems to ruin everything
Hell yeah brother!
I clicked so fast on this video
And heres to motion raceworks going to the moon ❤
Good move sir. Can’t wait to see why y’all come up with next.
I don’t remember the last time I clicked on a video so fast!

So so cool 😎 and totally not what I was expecting the announcement to be 😦  Congrats guys
I've got goosebumps!!! That's a big fire me up!
Congratulations brother! This is Dale worthy!!
The music made it super cringe and hard to watch
The bit about James and the nitrous factory had me dying laughing
Hell yeah brother 😎

I remember when I saw a random dudes video of stealing 1320s corvette and getting a lawn mower. Now look where you are man. It's so inspirational
I'm happy for you and James cleetus

It had to be this or Texas Speed
A tour by Seth Rogan him self. 😆
The sticker on the elco wasn't big enough...
Hell yeah bother!
Yeeeesssssss. I was so scared it’d be motortrend despite you saying not leaving YouTube.
This is the greatest channel on YouTube.
Hell yea
Well that was underwhelming..... congrats I guess lol
Iv never been so happy for someone iv never met. Looking forward to using Cleetus parts on my Monte Carlo.🇺🇸🇺🇸
Congratulations love seeing you guys grow
Congrats cleet seeing you and everyone around you along with this Chanel grow over the last view years has been amazing to watch and I’m glad to be a part of the journey keep up the good work hell ya brother

HELLLLLLL YEAHHHHH BROTHERRRRR!!!!!!
Congratulations guys that is amazing hell yeah brother the future looks bright 😎😎 stay safe guys and thank you to the men and women who serve our country
Heck yeah! Welcome to Iowa Boys!
Last video hint Kevin: Did they pay you to put their logo on your car? Cleetus: Nope. Just representing.
Jesus man, I’d say this is bigger than the freedom factory.
I’ve been waiting all day and night for this 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I was hoping it would drop for lunch!
Helllllllll Yeahhhhhh Brother !!! I’m building a 6.0ls can’t wait to get some motion parts 😊
Yeas !
Great content thanks for sharing
I didnt expect this..
Seen your insta and went right to YouTube in class
Love it cleet!
HELL YEAH BROTHER! Living the dream and taking us along on the journey, who woulda thunk a simple Instagram post could have produced this? Keep it up guys/gals y’all are kicking ass and letting freedom ring 🇺🇸🇺🇸💪💪 🔔
At work! Where’s the spoilers???
James and cleeter keeping the racing in the usa alive by taking their nutty antics, making better parts for engines we have and even standing by them. Now cleetus fab. Cleetus fab, real race parts for real race car fans. Hell yeah brother! Congrats boys!
Lets gooooooooooooooooo
Congrats boys! That explains the big motion race works sticker
Hell yeah brother!!! So stoked!
THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!!!! You guys absolutely rock
2am in Australia, had to make sure I set an alarm to watch this asap
Yessssssss 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Awesome awesome awesome 😎😎😎
What an amazing partnership. How far we've come from exhaust whistles.
Helll yea
I appreciate the fact that Motion Raceworks flies an unadulterated American Flag. Thank you.
fuck yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! man i wish you guys the best!!!!!!!!!!!! you guys are the best
MADE IN THE USA!!!!   HELL YEAH BROTHER!!!
WOOHOOOO HELL YEAH! Congratulations Cleetus! Best of luck man
So, youll be spending more time in Iowa now? Hell yeah brother
Makes sense why motion is on the Elco now. 🤘
Taking McFarland Fabrications to a whole new level!
Perfect partnership
Y’all hiring machinists? That would be me dream job to work with your team building race car parts!!!
Hell yeah brother!!!! 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
They need some more bbc parts, continue their ls parts but move into the aftermarket bbc and old school muscle car parts.
Had to watch even tho I'm at work👌
If you need a cnc guy that's what I do for a living!!! Hook it up cleet
HELL YES! Proud of you guys!
In like 2 years you will own a nascar team
Am I the only one who got chills?
I'm guessing you guys will start making Billet Corvette t56 input shafts lol
The freedom collection! I like it
Dude I’ve never clicked so fast on a video
This makes Cleet’s reaction to Kevin’s question about how much Motion paid to have the sticker on Mullet that much better haha
Congrats on the deal boys!!! Awesome to see you all diversify and continue to do what you love doing.
Don’t think mullet can pull a six
Congrats guys hope the best!!! Keep it up!  Yeee yeeeeeee
On lunch break with 10% I hope I can make it through this one!!!!!
Congrats om making some huge life moves brother Love the valve covers and they look great and sure functions better than factory covers especially for the price.
Congrats. And holy bald eagles. Time for some new parts. 🦅🇺🇸✌️
VGG was just here
I know I wasn’t the only one getting misty eyed during that intro
When Kevin asked if Motion paid you for that  giant sticker on the side of the Elco. Lol. Nope u paid them for it
Now it makes sense when Kevin asked are you getting paid or just being a nice guy when he asked about then big motion stickers on mullet
Congrats ya'll!
I set an alarm and been refreshing every 30 sec for this!
It makes since why Cleet put the “Motion Raceworks” stickers on the El Camino for free now!
Cleetus is really doing it right. Between this and the track he is set for life after youtube.
That’s the American 🇺🇸 dream making your own stuff. Hell yeah brother!!!
heck yeah man!!! this is gonna be awesome!!
I thought it was gonna be: “we got our own tv show!”
I’m so glad he didn’t do what road kill did
What ever happens to the cleetus channel and brand you will always have my support love from the UK 🇬🇧 🇺🇲
I try not to cuss as a young 35yo father but fuck yeah guys!!!! Kick ass bud!
Keep moving forward big fella, takes balls to do what u do and keep succeeding. Massive fan from Aus and will continue to watch for many years to come 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Congratulations and good luck
LFG!
Been waiting for this video since he announced it. Longest wait ever. Lol
Ok so who were the guys you tagged lol
Congrats wow that’s big
this is not the announcement we expected, but the one we needed  best of luck in this new chapter!
Can I buy some 🤔
CLEETUS IM AT WORK WHAT ARE YOU DOING DROPPING A HALF HOUR VIDEO RIGHT NOW!?!
Im so fucking happy watching this! even though my life is shit! Big kudos from sweden
Video gave me chills so happy for you guys
i bet cooper feels like such a dope lol
Congrats man, those eagles are flying ever higher!
WELP, looks like I’m buying parts.
Yessir! This is a great move! Also an excellent choice to get in bed with Motion rather than simply slapping a label on the side of a box with a turd inside. Enough idiots already do that kind of thing. Now, just maintain outstanding quality control, and watch the cash roll in. This is a great marketing move for Doug, and a wise investment in motor sports for you guys. I’m super pumped to see you and James investing in the sports that got you here. We need millennial and generation Z support in all aspects of Motorsport, and you guys are doing a great job of making sure our generation carries on the hot-rod and performance culture. The question is… are you guys ready for electric? It’s coming. Making that transition, or at least getting involved in it is going to be absolutely key to the future of the all of this moving forward. Electric cars may be the saving grace of small tracks across the country that are being closed out because of noise ordinances from encroaching populations.   One step at a time… lol… my mind just keeps moving.    🦅 🇺🇸 🦅
Never clicked a video notification so fast in my life!!  Hell yeah guys!
I really hope we never lose cleetus to network television, if it comes to TV time, use your own domain please
