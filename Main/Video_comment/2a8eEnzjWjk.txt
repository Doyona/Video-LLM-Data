I live there 😮
Whom shall Fucketh off, Wilbur shall (JK I like WIlbur, please don't go)
4:32 Tubbo wasn't lying
are they dating ?
Wilbur is a real captain
1:09 thats German 🤦‍♀️
The fact I live on the Isle of Wight 😢
Me: Hey? Wil? Can I um I um Will: 😏 yea you can sit on my lap for a bit me: yay tubbo: hey Franny? Will: Don’t call her Franny-  tubbo: why? Can’t i Me: because that’s a me and Will thing only he can say it you: you’re blushing a lot? Me: Captain gold may I kick this simp off the ship? Will: Yes 👍 you: 🥺 wait my cookie 🍪
9:50 Wilbur makes Jack look so tiny omg
missed this
three years later i have just realised i was on that cruise. omd
my favourite part is when Wilbur just casually picks up Jack and throws him in the ocean
Wilbur is my favourite!
I wonder if will bit them
"FUCKETH OFF😤" Shakespeare words truely. Should be in Museum :,)
'moo' 'gesundheit' 'he's speaking french' 'the isle of wight is french' 'don't touch me' that's gotta be the most confusing 3 seconds of my life
6:20 does anyone know what song they were singing??? I want to add it to my tubbo/wilbur playlist 😭
4:51
The Isle of Wight is actually where the HMS accidentally ramed the RMS Olympic in 1911.
9:46 moments befor the yeet 9:57 :3
“Fucketh off”😂😂 I actually started rolling on my bed laughing😂
I love how everyone just favours Niki, I mean, even I agree she's the best
As someone that lives on the Isle of Wight I can confirm that we are French. Oui Oui Bagguette.  Also, That big boat isn't a cruise ship. It is a car ferry that goes between Portsmouth and the Island.  (I think I might of actually been on it at the time that you filmed this)
Willbur: jack.. hold this  Jack: what, why why am i holding this? What? What!? Willbur: you had a good run jack i think Jack: what do u mean!? what do you mean-  "i had a good run" what does this- Willbur: *innocently picks up jack cuz hes short ahh fack* Jack: WHAAAAAAA oh- Willbur: are u ready? Jack: what'd you mean "am i ready" Willbur: are u rea- Jack: no no no no no no no no I GOT LAZY😭😭😭😭
Now imagine Wilbur
I've watched this video many times (it's my favorite Jack video) and i just realized Wilbut is wearing the jacket Tubbo was wearing at the beginning
the way wilbur in this video changed my brain chemistry so many years ago 😭😭
i was eating doritos while they were talking about the dorito😭😭
wilbur - 'silence speaks volume' oh man this aged horribly
hELP WHAT?? THIS VIDEO IS GOOD ACTUALLY - LMAO
Seeing wilbur makes me cry he was my idol😢
The
To think I was living on the island at the time they were doing this shoot is insane lmao
Ah, yes, wilbur and tubbo are a team. I dub thee the buff bois. (And it's because tubbo can pick up tommy and wilbur can pick up Jack, so yes they are the buff bois)
It took me two years to release I wasn’t subscribed
WAIT WAIT QIAT WHAT 1:08 did he just speak Ojibwa? Istg wilbur said "bless you" in my language 😭
What are the two songs used during the chase?
TLDR; Based Gentleman Chad Wilbur Soot Demolishes Beta Cuck Incel Jack Manifold.
2:06 that’s a cormorant not a Dorito 😂
Literally did sail racing there- haha
Jack with hair can’t hurt you  Jack with hair:
Drink more sea water  Wilbur soot 2022
Jack is our fav racist ❤😇
“I like boys.”                            -Tubbo 2021
whenever wilbur is putting on a hat [any kind] he changes
I love how competitive Jack and Niki are but how chill Will and Tubbo are.
Im finding this soooo funny watching this in 2023 and living on the isle of wight
the fact that wilbur just picked up jack like a feather is terrifying
Williambur sootius W
Jack:I just got thrown in the ocean for that so if you don't subscribe, you're a bad person!!  Also Jack:I didn't forewarn her "If we lose" part  Boy please!!
I LIVE NEAR THAT DOCK
OMG JACK IS WEARING CROWLEYS GLASSES
4:30 welp, that aged well
That's the best pirate i've ever seen.
As mercury said traveling at the speed of light
i love quirky duo
Enjoyed watching my home city get bullied.
In between
bonjour
1:57 'SMOUTH'
Jack: Its so cold! I legit thought Will would say "Well, I'm so cold!" LMAO
as a catholic i must agree what wilbur said was true  🤣
Did they come from the Isle of Wight?
I want to see more of tubbo and Wilbur friendship
3:52  I absolutely love how unbothered and iconic Wilbur looks here
Siiiii buen videoooo dios te bendiga tubbo y ojala llegues a los 3M suscriptores
i know will and niki are NOT  a thing but i just- i cant help but ship them!!!!
As a catholic I feel great honor
I want Wilbur’s glasses they’re so cool
You can't throw Nikki in the water because it will show her private spots when she gets in the water
Wilbur is so hot and strong in this video😨 Tubbo is weird Niki is just excited for Jack to be thrown into the water Jack is just suffering
4:50 THIS BIT IS AMAZING OMG ‘fucketh off’ I *NEED* TO USE THAT NOW.
one of my biggest flexes is that I can drive a boat (I can't sail tho-)
1:59 jack:oh the blac-
OMG i used to live on the Isle Of White when i was younger.
Drink more seawater! -Wilbur soot 2021
Jack: "You know what happened to Freddy Mercury?" Me: "He died on my Birthday"
"Silence speaks volume"                                            -Wilbur soot 2021
Hopefully we all see why niki wasn’t thrown in, she would’ve never been back in a video with any of them. She was so mad😅, I’ve never seen niki that angry before
5:40
at 6:45 just niki holding onto jack
You wouldn't have been thrown in the water if you just accepted Wilbur's love for you
Knowing that niki doesn't want to be thrown into the water wilbur decided to thrown jack into the water then. 😂😂
"fucketh off" hahahahaha
Bydgoszcz
He saved nicky
Unsubscribes 😂
I live in portsmouth
2:26
r/boatrace still thrives
Why is it that every single Jack Manifold vlog I've seen thus far has just been Jack suffering and dying for content?
Tubbo "Look at that boay" "I like boys " line from Tubbo
Jack looks exactly like Scout from TF2. Argue with a brick wall.
tubbo: "i like boys" in the business that's something we call foreshadowing.
6:59 this is how riding a jet ski is like bc of the bounce and speed
Breaking news: bee boy eats a boat  7:01
WAIT IS THE BACKGROUND MUSIC “ DRIVING AND I’M SPEEDING AND I’M VIGOROUSLY MASTE- “ 6:05
These people have officially made my day a whole lot better.🤣🤣
I WAS ON THAT Ferie
Epic ending unlocked
Tbh ferry is a much easier form of transport. Me and my family usually just do this and stay in a static caravan in East Cowes but love the challenge Jack. Keep up the great work. 🥰
There's this on going trend with Wilbur and putting Tubbo through child labor, first the mule bits, now the desalination of the sea, and I am all for it
“Fuckef off” 🤣🤣🤣
oh i brought niki🤣🤣🤣
my parents are fighting rn so i’ll just put on my headphones and watch thsi
If you want to get revenge throw  Tubbo and Will's phone in the sea.
Will: We call that a Dorito  Me: Oh Hell Nah
omg jack actually has some hair in this
How has it been a year.
4:30
Fyi you don’t drive a boat, you conn a boat

Oh my god, this was Tubbos original coming out video
Good thing you didn’t bring ranboo because his weaknesses is water because he’s a enderman
Willbur is just a comedic genius
Wilbur: **throws jack in the ocean** Me: I want to do that to someone-
Omg I can’t fucking believe they were in Portsmouth where they are in the beginning of the video I live 10 mins away
i love the isle of wight
Jack "what have u last"  Me: MY RESPECT
It will forever tickle me hearing Wightlink called a cruise lmao
gesundhiet is German XD LOVE THE VID!!!
FUCKETH OFF -Jack Manifold    This is going to be my new quote.
Wilbur: Gesundheit Jack: Thats french Me a German: 😐
Not me being scared the whole time that Tubbo’s grandma might get thrown in the water
6:47 can somebody play the song from titanic
The way im tryna control my smile is tough bc im watching this infront of my parents and their religous and concerned abt anything
Also ferries are massive you don’t realise till you get on one and see the size of it.
Wait you do know that the island isn’t in franc right?
yoooooo a wild Dorito imma eat it m dorito
"Yours is the east and mine is the west," _"FUCKETH OFF"_
WILBUR CAN GERMAN?!
Jack: NAME ONE THING IV’E LOST Tubbo:past relationships Niki: the love or host
why did he call the ferry a cruiser?
5:09 Due to this clip, on my vaction to the  beach I shall drink seawater to desalinate it
God job 💣
I live on the Isle of Wight and I had no idea they were nearby that day lol
1:42 I was drinking water and the guy just didn’t respond
this aged well
im eating a loaf of bread rn while watching this =]
“wow that's a cool looking buoy... I like boys! well.”
No way I live there 😵😵
Wilbur will literally just do whatever he wants and it’s so funny
4:28
Bruh that castle I think I saw a vid about it and I don’t know I’d anyone know who theses people are but Sam and Colby went they and it’s a haunted hotel and London and they called it the queen Mary castle it is very haunted pls check Sam and Colby out
I’m past the ocean
tbh I was shocked they were going to the isle of wight as that's where I live LOL
I wish the original was still up with tubbo and Wilbur dancing along to Freddie mercury I know copywright but there is a video that is just them dancing that is still up soo but the bid is still really good tho
6:25 who remembers the bit when they were jamming out to Freddie Mercury? It got taken out:(
I wish I had Tubbo and Wilburs Boat man
Tubbo: "I like boyzzz" 🧐🥴
I can drive a boat and i am 11 years old. Lol
we are the bad person 😈
I wanted Tubbo and will to win because I prefer both of them to jack lol no offense but Nikki I wonderful
YOU NEEDED TOMMY IN THIS VLOG IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH FUNNIER
fUcKeTh oFF                           I can't 😂😂😂😂
Is it weird some of the videos are talking brittish
I really hope they don’t actually think the wightlink ferry is a cruise ship, as someone from the Isle of Wight it is anything but 😂 sitting on that for an hour just to leave a teeny little island is not an enjoyable experience!
The fact my house is in this video-
WHAT THE FUCK WILBUR
Why does tubbo say “I like boys”
Anyone else sad that they cut out Freddie mercury
the titanic looking part where niki was hugging jack was the best part
I knew in the very very very beginning when we started it was gonna be bad 😂
Give me a link to the Delfino plaza remix at the end
Gosh
"I like boys" *comes out as unlabeled*
I love this video
I live in Gosport ☺️
Jack Manifold is basically Tommyinnit non-child version
Willbur: east is the wst  Jack: fucketh ofeth
" Thats a good bouy... I like Boys" - Tubbo 2021    me: gae also me: im gae
i just love wilbur and tubbo in this video , i mean i love them anywhere but in this video they were like extra funny and kinda cute
NO BUT WILBUR JUST PICKS HIM UP- I would’ve thought it was romantic if he didn’t immediately drown afterwards- lol
‘that’s a cool looking buoy… i like buoys’ thats foreshadowing at its finest right there
The way that Wilbur just picked up jack liked he wieghd not even a pound
Wilbur is so cute with glasses omg
I <3 it if u and niki were a couple u 2 look soooo cute together lol
Jack: mouth... Wilbur: *SMOUTH.*
5:04   "Fucketh Off"                --JackManifold
the pick up just reminded me of hakachi otoko 18+ parts😭I'M SORRY LOL
I used to live there, I had picnics in that castle when I was a kid! This video is full of nostalgia lol
Boat drivers: yeah we’re going to isle of-  Wilbur: *DRINK THE SEA WATER. DRINK IT. DRINK MORE. DESALINATE DESALINATE*  tubbo: *chokes on saltwater*
bro really said fucketh off
9:42 just keeps getting better from there poor jack But that nod at the end got me😂🤣
I’ve been southhampton and I’ve seen all of that
I was in Isle of Wight then bro I could of seen em
i live on the isle of wight
Jack:fLiPeTh oFf
no tubbos we’re harmed in the making of this video 5:11
"I'm making him drink sea water!"  "What's it like?"  "Potassium!"   💀
Right so they called the people from the isle of wight french? Excuse me i am not french sir
Will:we’re like Romeo and Juliet! Jack: I don’t feel like that Will:although we are from different boats Jack:I’M NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM Will:wherefor art tho manifold. Yours is the east as mine is the west  Jack: FUCKITH OFF
As a sailing and boating instructor i can say that the guy on the jack's boat was pretty much doing his job with no fun and the guy on wilbur's boat just slammed full throttle and even went for a circulation to entertain. Would recommend sailing with this guy)
i live on the isle of wight so this was fun to watch! :) the fact Jack thought the isle of wight is France was hilarious for me :)))
I'm speechless but I don't need to say anything because silence speaks volume
Can you say to willbur "he need to learn german"
I remember going there
I just love that Wilbur was making up all these fake facts
I think a better title would add Wilbur, Niki, and Tubbo in it
3:22
"I FEEL" r/soothouse
I love how Wilbur threw Jack into the water because he was planning to throw Niki in. That wasn't very poggers of you Jack  Also, watching this made me think about when I went to Ocean City and went paragliding. It was so pretty and the boat ride was really fun. I also really like how fun the boat workers make it because really, it would be so more boring if they weren't entertaining.  :000 JACK YOU SHOULD DO A PARAGLIDING VLOG OMG
jack you forgot your life jacket
"F**keth off" 😂😂😂

Drink more sea water. -Wilbur Soot 21st of June 2021.
In every one of his videos, the people who are in them are 100 times more funny and they are only reason I watch them.
Imagine going on that cruise and seeing your favorite streamers in a boat    beside you 💀💀
ive watched this atleast 6 times i just love it too much
My happiness of seeing jack instead of Niki being thrown into the ocean👍
Everyone looks so pretty in the thumbnail then theirs tubbo *complete child*
Everyone is so pretty in the thumbnail then theirs tubbo *COMPLETE CHILD*
That got to be the best pirate I’ve ever seen
Wilbur 2021:"drink more sea water"
Wilbur stealing the hat and ranking people is honestly the most Wilbur thing he could do other than start another nation
Niki really got him with the "Love or Host"
So is Jack saying at the end that he got trhew into the water for us?
4:50 is my favorite part of the whole video it always makes my day when I see it 😁
9:49.       😳      🍄
I went to Florida and drank some salt
"FUCKETH OFF" - Jack Manifold
The „gesundheit“ was german
⟟ knew about this vlog the second it came out and I'm only just watching it now
We're not french 🤦🏻‍♀️😅
Poor willbur always got ignored😂😁
9:52 oh to be jack
*boat*
Wilbur slug dropping is hilarious
6:18wilbur puts in earpods
i just love how instead of wilbur letting niki get thrown in he throws jack instead
lol
Why is Wilbur always so hot?
Wilbur says bless you in german jack they aren't speaking English thats French
Huge shoutout to the boat captains who played along with the race and then went crazy and stoopid at the end
Its so funny that Wilbur does the slug drop :P
Just a time stamp for my edit later 5:42
I'm french
How is Wilbur so strong
9:58 jack manidrown :O
4:31:- Wow! thats a cool looking buyo! 4:32:- I like boys!! :)  What a powerful saying tubb
Why Wilbur speaks German?
I Love how most of the dream smp just roasts jack, and there is hardly anyone who likes him, hes one of my favourites lol ❤❤
9:52 Romeo and Juliet <3
Mean while Tubbo: life by the sea  Jack : ughhhh I video is over 😭😭😭
Did he know Gesundheit is german?
I used to go on the boat of my aunt and uncle. I miss that so much
4:29 I guess tubbo just came out welp there we go tubbos gay...
5:02 "yours is the east as mine is the west-" "fucketh off"
This is my father's acc
I changed my comment from a year ago because well, yeah
wilburs face after he threw him in to the water is just..
Uhmm gesundheit is germany
"Fuckith off!" That's my new favorite quote
Lol, at the end Niki is just so happy when he got thrown in the water XD.
“Is this fricking scooby doo!?” Tubbo “…YEAAA”
“FUCKETH OFF”
5:04
LOOK! IT'S SAINT CLAIRE!
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 <3
Not jack thinking putting wilbur and tubbo on a team is a good idea
Niki or jack: but they was like a mile after us
Wilbur standing up for Niki :) so wholesome (no, i am not shipping them)
FeUcKAtH AoOf
At least it was Niki and not tubbo's grandmother lmao 🤣😂😂
I know for a FACT he did NOT say SluG Drop.
jack saying "fucketh off" is imo one of the funniest bits
And me like lmanburg is back
1:57 smouth
So its either niki being thrown into the ocean or tubbos grandma
The fact wilbur didn't let jack throw Niki in the water is just so wholesome (no hate to jack or anyone)
But Wilbur slug drop tho lol😂 5:43
wilbur's marks are so funny
4:51 tho 🤣🤣🤣🤣
IM FUCKING FLAPPY HAND STIMMING WATCHING THIS I LOVE IT
aweee love how Jack just stood on the boat then Niki be huggin him
This was the video everyone realized Wilbur is hot
I didnt know that Jack has abs😳
Wilbur: "I'm making him drink sea water!" Jack: "What's it like?" Tubbo: "POTASSIUM!"
That was german for bles you
The moment Jack fell into the sea 9:58
One of the things that jack has loss is hair
Jack sad Willber smart  Niki confident  Tubbo I like boys 😯
i felt sick just from WATCHING this🤢
gesundheit=French Funny it's a german word either🙃
i love how wilbur just yeets jack and saves niki
Oh I know I'm had already
Its Just funny how jack said "if u dont subscribe ur a bad person" while he Just said that if he didnt win nikki would go in the water
Hahaha I live your videos jack
As soon as Wilbur put the hat on he became ✨captain big brain😫👌
wilbur be strong.
girl niki didnt deserve to be thwrown in the water so wilbur just stood up for niki and throwed jack in the water thats absolute karma
It would have been hilarious if Wilbur had fallen into the Sea when he threw Jack xD
im not france lol
Couldnt have thrown anyone into the water any better
Jack got thrown in soup
"fucketh off" -Jack Manifold 2021
as someone from the isle of wight, it is not france.
HAPPY NEW YEARS! WAS ON HERE FOR CHRISTMAS AS WELL!
This is strange because I have lived in portsmouth my entire life and still do and thats where they are also I have never met a famous youtuber
LMAO THE WAY NIKI JUMPED FOR JOY OVER JACK GETTING THROWN INTO THE WATER
Ah I remember when this came out 😌 still think jack deserved to be thrown on da water
Can we just talk about how the captain filmed Jack getting thrown in?
Tubbo's life by the sea original inspiration moment
Our motor for my families boat is mercury 🤦🏽‍♀️
I thought Tubbo was living and loving his life by the sea- why is he is sad he is drinking sea water
i just love how wholesome Wilburs and Nikis friendship
OMG I CANT BELIVE THAT THEY CROSSED THE PACIFIC OCEAN IN 10:22
Tubbo's LIFE BY THE SEA
I love this video so much lmao
Hold on.it is so fucking adorable that Will just picked him up bridal style
I could totally do that in lake Erie lol!
Ok that's my new favorite manifold video
If this tricks you pin me    Read more…
Will just talking to Jack is so funny because you can just see Willis mouth
How can I get in Brighton? Thats my biggest dream!!!
4:49  this is the best Jack Manifold clip ever.
Fun fact the ‘Dorito bird’ is actually called a shag, take that how you will
my battery is 69%. its a sign.
Missed opportunity for nikki and Jack to recreate the "I'm flying jack I'm flying!" scene from the titanic 😂😂😂
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
Wilburs glasess are just perfekt
the video in a nutshell "TODAY I AM A CAPTAIN" "I'M MAKING HIM DRINK SEA WATER" "LOVE OR HOST" "WHAT IS LIKE?" "POTASSIUM" "MMMMMMM" "THEY ARE JUST JAMMING AWAY" "MORE SEAWATER" "IT'S ALL COPYRIGHTED" "FRANCE" "TEAM REDDIT" "DESALINATE THE SEA" "WE ARE TALKING BOUT SCOOBY DOO" "IDK"
Damm will is so aggressive but it’s funny
Wow there in port solent near me aha.
wilbur: s m o u t h

"Drink more seawater"-Wilbur Soot 2021
fucketh off XD i cant i died
“Fucketh off “ My favourite quote of the year
tubbo: "i like boys" wilbur: *thinks* "what-"
Just realized Niki sounded like my fav. teacher in school-
Why no one talks about Tubbo:' give a quote' 'a good quote' *sound* Wilbur:'drink more seawater' its just so funny to me idk why xd ( 5:34)
I speak french
4:50 😭😭😭
You literally post this on my birthday
Really sad that we didn’t get a section of Wilbur just eating sand.
u all talking how strong Wilbur and Savage Niki is but don't talk how badass that last race between the boats I feel like the drivers are really giving it all
Romeo and Juliet more like Wilbur and Jack
You heard it here folks drink more sea water -Wilbur 2021
Wilbur once said: " DRINK MORE SEAWATER TUBBO!"
I- I'm happy that tubbo didn't loose his grandmother's urne-
9:51  ah yes this is what my siblings first words were
Niki: (Says f^ck) Everyone: OMG, SHE JUST CUSSED! Jack: F^cketh off.
wilbur and tubbo : *shipping jack and niki* jack :  "i dont know her like that!" also jack : *goes on date with niki*
Today I am a captin! *at the end GETS THROWN OFF BOAT*
Jack  that was german
Its nice to see wilbur saving his girl
this was so cool man
wilbur really just picked him up and threw him in like it was nothing
this video made me win a bet in cnn10 lol
jacks reasoning at end of video: I JUST GOT THROWN INTO THE OCEAN BC I LOST IF YOU DON’T SUB YOU’RE A BAD PERSON jacks reasoning at beginning of video: let’s throw niki into the ocean if we lose! she wont care 😚❤️
Wilber said gesundhite which means bless u, in German
Wait hold up how does Wilber know German
(5:34)  "Drink more seawater!!"                       - WilberSoot, 2021
Thats french
Wilbur: ‘Some romantic shake spear’ Jack: FUCKETH OF
tubbo just said potassium (maybe that's the where deltarune get its meme inspiration) potassium
“Potassium”-tubbo
tubbo: *i think we won*  niki: *sweating nervously*
Please come back to isle of wight I live in this hell hole   Edit : them calling white link a croisship is to funny
I would generously give them a jar of dirt so they can say "the line"
Wilbur protected his girl (Niki) bully throwing Jack in the water! 😍
I live on the isle of wight and when he mentioned it I literally screamed lmao
5:28 Kris get the banana
Where is gakmaster?
just come back from the isle of wight and the big cruise boat they saw was a ferry going from the island back over to portsmouth
Boat
Poor grandma got me laughing every time and wilbur saying to drink more sea water was hilarious
Me when I saw it two days after: Dang missed seeing Jack being thrown in the sea in person Now: haha enjoy
Tubbo: I like boys  Me the shipper misunderstanding and right away thinks RANBOO! (SHIIIIP)  {P.S. Tubbo and Ranboo sorry if your uncomfortable with this ship.. if you are I will try to take it down}
imagine going on a cruise and seeing your favorite youtubers on boats Lol!
I immediately lost it when he went ‘ fucketh off’

"F*cketh off!" -JackManifoldTV
Will picking up jack and throwing him is the best thing I’ve seen today
"Jack manifallintothesea"
this might genuinely be the most i've ever laughed in such a short amount of time oh my god.
6:23  pause here and you will see
Why does Jack look like a dad trying to bond with his kids in the cover clip lmfaoo
your video is amazing right now
I would have gone in the boat with the Yamaha outboard
Was Jack shouting ‘I’m king of the world!’ A The Office reference?
Wilbur: Wherefore art thou Manifold Jack: Here! The actual meaning of the line "Wherefore art thou" actually means why
Tubbo: Wow! that's a cool looking buoy!   I like boys!
I'm watching this in October and I live on the Isle of Wight so I'm so sad I didn't see them but great video guys ☺️😋🥰
i swear there humor always kills me
Tubbo's the real captain here B)
Its hard to look at Niki when shes sad
I like how when Wilbur puts on the captain hat, he became a chad.
when he said ,,gesundheit" that sounded actually like he was born in germany. Is he gerrman?? Btw i am
did jack have his phone on him when he was thrown into the water ? :o
I subscribed and shared ur channel to allll my 34 friends have a nice day jack
5:05 that cures my lung cancer
Say to Siri what’s a seal in french😅
Jack cut out the queen sing along :(
Wilbur: Gesundheit Germans: Dieses Video ist jetzt Staatseigentum von Deutschland 🇩🇪
The mushy chest singly expect because spear multivariately post for a faint fair sort. open, heavenly heavy hellish bass
Im a bad perosn didnt sub
wilbur making tubbo drink seawater reminds me of...            MULE BITS, MULE BITS, COME GET YOUR MULE BITS
1:45 i was watching this while i was studying and got a bit surprised when I heard my last name
possible flash warning, and love this lol
"Fucketh off" -JackManifold

Wilbur just yeeting jack in the sea😍
4:50 OOOOHHHH ❤❤❤❤❤
Wilbur: asks the boat driver if Wilbur helps drive the boat to show Jack, Tubbo and Niki* boat driver: silence* Wilbur: silence speaks volumes
The music at the end just slaps    The whole video was awesome too but that’s a given
10:05 cuz Wilbur loves Niki (jk
They are so stupid I love it
Soo the 1 add that HAD to pop up was “godaddy” *youtube what the heck*
I like that this is a vid of them doing essentially nothing the whole time. Just riding a boat . It was funny , but stakes were funky.
i love the fact that when jack was trying to throw niki in, wilbur just comes up and picks up up and throws him in
When tubbo said ‘That’s a cool buoy' 'I like boys'
jack:they gave up  willbur and tubbo: no not yet we just flex here
“Fucketh off”
I love how Nikki held onto jack like it was the titanic such great friendship
2:31 and that my friends, is when l'manberg started.
Ok but- jack got thrown in the ocean. IN HIS SOCKS 😳 i hope you have a spare pair buddy. I wouldn’t wanna walk in soggy socks 😂
The fact that niki wear a life jacket is very scary
Im a catholic
I love how Wilbur easily just picks him up and throws him
Tubbo: '" I like boys "
the only reason wilbur threw jack in the water was so niki wouldn't suffer in the cold
Am I the only person who likes being thrown into the water?
"yours is the east as mine is the west" "fucketh off" jksdjksdkjsdkjds i'cant
aww niki hugged jack
On 9:05 jack sounds like tommy when he say "STOP IT"
5:15
I actually can't believe that this was 3 months ago
My family whenever were talking about freddie mercury out of nowhere my papa comes and says “you know how Michelle Jackson die?He fell and broke his nose”and we all start laughing
"FUCKETH OFF" -Jack Manifold, 2021
You guys are so cute and Niki hugged jack and why nihachu  not go to the water
I've watched this too many times. I'd be an Wilburs and Tubbo. Just because they jamming it. Also rip Ze jack manifold cap

Fun fact Wilbur says Gesundheit but it's not french😂its German😂
Dude just hold on for dear life to Wilbur then you would drag him into the water with you
NIIIIIKKKKKIIIIIIIIIIII AAAAAAAA <3333
We got a live action JackManiDrown
JackManiDrown really became real..
Is no one going to talk about how tubbo Juat straight up said I like boys
When wilbur gets some sort of power he becomes the villain
Tubbo is CAP-tin
Anyone notice will and niki doing something in the background when tubbo was putting on the hat
i literally cant stop watching how Wilbur threw Jack into the sea. literally hilarious
Am I the only person who ships Wilbur and Niki
5:04 Fucketh off I AM DEAD
Niki will never be thrown... Everyone but her will thrown-
Wilbur having a great time being a captain xD The way he caried Jack and threw him to the water is just sooo....DAMN COOL
Tubbo is cosplaying Kokichi ouma
Tubbo like boys 🙂
5:34 that sound effect genuinely scared me
Tubbo: Give me a good quote Wilbur: Drink more seawater Tubbo: *Drinks Seawater* Wilbur: “I like child labor”
9:12 niki being the bad*ss.
pov: you watched this when it was first uploaded and saw the song moment of tubbo and wilbur and you rewatched it again: WHERE ART THOU SONG?!
wow the are da best team 👍👍😁
what's going on with those glasses/googles and where do I get a pair?  Edit: spelling
4:53 the ****eth off had me dying and its so underrated
Literally 2 years ago I've always wanted to move to UK and now i just realized how much more in love i am with the place 👌👄👌
I like wilbur but in the thumbnail he looks like the 'cool guy' from a 90's sitcom about sailing
Will completely threw Jack into the water-
Wilbur is 25 today
Awww the little gesundheit(bless you) of wil was so adorable
Love your videos
If I was thrown into the ocean I'll drown I literally cannot swim y'all can't see me float y'all see my d34d body floating
This is so asome coolllllllllllll
1:16 why do I feel like that's Markiplier's line?  2:10 that's it. thats my new way of avoiding ignorance 3:22 as a fan artist who's looking to draw some of these vlog scenes I feel called out (◐∇◐) 5:52 Niki you are such a mood 7:02 look at them flying! 7:57 look at them all jealous of this epic race 8:57 _dissapointment intensifies_ 09:58 he just yeET
Wilbur so strong
Wilbur is gigantic and absolutely towers over Jack. No wonder he could pick him up so easily.
I. Fucking. Love. Wilbur.
i can’t subscribe becuz i’m already subscribed lol

9:12 Niki just sweared
Niki is scary when she’s mad because she is normally happy.
Pfff I love how they were in Portsmouth where I'm from
this is some sea of thieves type of shit
tubbo is gay (confirmed)
I love how Wilbur and tubbos boat went in a full circle for fun and still managed to catch up
As someone who is a boating kid this was hilarious
Omg its so cute that Wilbur just so much protect Nikki✨💗🏳️‍🌈🖤🤍👑
Will: “gesundheit” jack: their not speaking english, they’re- that’s french
i wouldve pushed wilbur so f-ing far-
why did some of the parts remind me of Luca-
Watching this 2 months later made me sad cause the copyrighted music got cut out :(
8:13
why is everyone not talking about niki huging jack when the boat speeds?😳
Wow that’s a cool looking bouy I like boys 😃🤚 love that
Tubbo: is given one chance for free speech *accidentally comes out as gay in the first 3 seconds*
Fucketh of , my new favourite sentence
Any question =The Driver.................
4:50 - 5:05 Like Romeo and Juliet <3
Wilbur:gesundheit Jack:they aren't speaking English they are speaking French Me as a german:that's not French that german BAHAHHAA
“I had to take up smoking” me: is that bc you had cancer? /j (I just watched the jack manifold ‘searching myself up’
I wat you to do parasailing
the thumbnail looks like some kind of white family's family photo
x.x *The love or host!* im dead
Quote of the day "drink more sea water" -Wilbur soot
As someone who was born on the isle of white I can confirm it’s not french
The immense pea daily decay because dressing intracellularly pause save a tedious cockroach. exotic, kind ant
9:10 LANGUAGE!!
I am worse than a mean person I dislike the video I am on Wilbur side
10:12 anyone know the outro song?
I’ve been to the isle of white
POV: your back here to see if the dance bit was some weird fever dream or not
Gesundheit Is german 👯

4:26 2:52 9:55
jack: name one thing ive lost before mcc. mcc jack.
Wilbur: Gesundheit Jack: that's french Me: **Screams in German** ('Gesundheit' is 'Bless you' in english)
5:03 That Jack's "Fucketh off" was said in such an old english lady manner that I can't even XD

"FUCKETH OFF" -Jack Manifold
Oh god Wilbur is so fxxking handsome my beloved. Especially when he throws Jack into the water at the end scene. Jesus I’m falling love again

"I'm watching this like 5th time and i still have too much emotions :, )"

6:22
Im just looking at the boats and thinking about tubbos boat here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LK81MI2U2g&t=3s
Bruh why is Niki so short tempted in this video lmao Everyone is chilling and she is just angry
4:50
I’ve been on the st Clair to go to the Isle of Wight like 30 times
I only clicked on this cause of wilby foot
Niki and jack uwu
Niki swearing just feels illegal, and also anyone noticed how will and niki were still being so wholesome and adorable🥺
why does wilbur always enslave tubbo
fucketh off! made my day
Price of land which is opersit Portsmouth is gosport and that's were I live so I just burst out laughing when wilber said he renamed the spiniker tower 1🤣🤣🤣🤣
i bet if wilbur threw me, i would literally go to mars
wilbur almost the time: mmMmmM sEa WaTeR mOoReE  *tubbo  choking on the salty water bcuz of how bad it tasted and how much he was laughing*
*Gesundheit being an German world*  Jack: French.
Niki would look adorable in the sailor hat just saying facts she is so beautiful im honestly jealous of how beautiful she is I look up to her
Be careful Luffy is out and about
Oh no   Jack mani smoke
Wilbur looked so proud of himself for just dumping Jack in the ocean.
i love the fact that niki was bouncing around and smiling after jack got thrown in- i cant-
This is by far the best parody of the pirates of the Caribbean
HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
rip to the people who never saw the part where tubbo and wilbur put music on the speaker.
Wilbur gives main character energy and I'm here for it😂
I got a Tony Lopez ad during this video that just runied my mood tbh 🤣
Im concerned on how strong Wilbur is
Wilber is on steroids man
W; Wherefore art thou manifold? J; *FUCKETH OFF!*
He the soon to be new Mr Beast
✨'Fucketh off'✨ By far the best part of the video
Bruh literally every time I go somewhere they go the next day like wtf
Came back cause I loved the video until one day I realized that my favorite scene was cut out do to copyright really loved it when tubbo and Wilbur sang together
What glass is wilbur wearing
THIS IS HILARIOUS!! THE WAY WILBUR THREW JACK INTO THE OCEAN!
m a r r i a g e 9:53
Niki got genuinely angry, I feel so bad.
Did anyone else die when jack said fucketh off
I mentally died on "F*CKETH OFF" I think I stopped breathing
Lol Gesundheit is german🤗
Wilbur: TUBBO DRINK THE OCEAN  TUBBO: please spare me :(
9:40 You’re welcome 😂🤣♥️
Jack manifold is now addicted to smoking

"Poor grandma, I brought an urn”  Meme of the day
Jack mani-drown
Jack:”Bring something valuable on the boat with you!” Also Jack:*Brings Niki*          Subs without the “b”…
Guys pls i love the part were Jack stands up and Niki hugs him from behind😩 I want a friendship like this

When jack got thrown in 💀
I just realized who long Wilburs legs are. WHY ARE THEY SO LONG?!?!??!!?!
6:52 you know things are getting good when that music plays
This is my 5th time watching this video 😀
The best part got copyrighted this is a sad day
"Fucketh off" 🤣🤣
Niki gave Wilbur the death stair and at that moment Wilbur knew exactly what he had to do
I thought It was Bryce Hall in the thumbnail LMAO,
Am I the only one kinda freaked out by how long Wilbur's leg looked? That shits freaky why is it like that?
Why is nobody talking about this Tubbo: "That's a cool looking buoy" Tubbo: "I like boys"
Ah yes fucketh off quoted by Jack Manifold
I was in English our class was reading Romeo and Juliet. My teacher asked me why I was laughing so hard........5:04
props to the guys actually driving the boats for putting up w them
tubbo: I like boys me and my bf at the same time: same
Dude, "Fucketh off" killed me way more than it should have
Wilbur really just picked Jack up and yeeted him ✋😃
Why does it look so romantic when Jack is being HELD by Wilber? I thought he was straight, and was practically “with” niki
I live on the Isle of Wight!
9:43
I love wilbur in this one he like the older brother I never had
im sad jack had to cut the small music dance scene :(
sus
Why did Will look so cool after throwing jack in the ocean?!

When tubbo said "I like boys '' I died✋
I was literally on the ferry waiting to cross whilst they were filming this
9:48
I have been to the Isle of Wight it’s not french
10:56
If  gonna be honest I, need a little space to breathe, if I'm living and loving my, life by the sea.
Wait.. I saw a boat like that waving... OH SHI-
"fucketh off" yeah that's about right 😂😂😂😂
r/boatrace

No one’s talking about Wilbur’s socks
Tubbo is so, SO lucky he won... if he had lost, he would have thrown his grandmas urn
9:53   *princess carry*
I will never get over how easily Wilbur picked up Jack
"remember how i said bring a family heirloom" Tubbo: i brought my grandmas urn Jack: i brought niki 😃
tubbo   "i LiKe BoYs"
when you live in Southampton: 😃🥳
14,700th comment

I like Scooby doo

'drink sea water it's good for'                                          willbur

Jack sounds like gogy omg 😳
I need to see them all go tubing like that would be so funny especially with like everyone haha. Great vid Jack
THEY TOOK THE BEST PART OUT NOOOO
i hate everyone putting a link to tommy short vid thinking its unknow channel and we already know
I remember seeing a comment but i cant find it anymore so i'll paraphrase it here so hopefully people can see it. Wilbur saw how niki didnt want to go into the water so he threw jack in for her.   THAT IS TRUE FRIENDSHIP
Is it me or Niki and Wilbur are cute together
How did wilbur and tubbos boat gain so much speed at the end
Wilbur has taken the tile as the British captain jack sparrow.
tubbos gay
5:32 this is so funny
tubbo: i like boys  me asf: beeee whoooo you are for your prideeee
"me vs you to the isle of wight"  me who with water in my mouth living on the isle of wight: *spits water out*

WILBUR DEFENDS NIKI AND THROWS JACK
jack looks so small compared to wilbur lmao
Vilbur looks like fu*king unit compared to jack XD
Outro song name?
5:00 my favorite part was when jack said “FUCKETH OFF” 🤣🤣
I aspire to be a seeman like wilbursoot 🙂
Tubbo has made so many jokes about liking guys XD   (i dont think he actually likes guys tho)
I didn’t realise niki was taller than Jack?!
Did Will really said “Gesundheit “ (its german and means “bless you” ) 😱😱
“fucketh off” - mr. manifold 2021
I like Wilbur’s orange socks 🙃
Tuboos cough here is cute tho 😣👉👈 5:14
So, this is the first blog that I watched twice. This video is just amazing
are we gonna ignore that one piece of hair sticking up off tubbos head when he takes of the cap.
The quick bamboo evocatively clap because sack identically entertain qua a stormy feather. internal, judicious reminder
The end there with Wilbur just towering over jack makes wilbur look even taller than he is
Ah yes my  favourite shakespeare play, Romeo and Jack
Hows Tommyfishit
“Drink more seawater” - WilburSoot 2021
9:00 That death stare tho
“i brought niki” why is nobody taking about that💀😭
Wilbur safe niki aww
I hate how he had to cut the best bit of the video because of copyright 😭😭
I have been inspired to throw people in the sea
are we not talking about how macticly willbur though jack in the water
tubbo consumed around 1 million small bugs in the sea water
New sale everyone. Tubbo Seawater!
GOO TO BRIGHTEN PIER ON THE 16TH AUGUST PLS I BEGGGG
i live on the iow but i dont live in cows
Will is very strong and he’s a great friend cause he clearly saw Niki wasn’t alright with being thrown into the water.
7:58 OOOOOMMGGGG I LITERALLY saw my self on the FERRI OOMGG
6:29 epsilon is trash
"did you bring a valuable item?"  jack: oh i brought niki.
Will and Tubbo together remind me of Rick and Morty XDD ... Tubbo just does what Will says :D
9:00
This is why I admire Wilbur 1.Make your team mate hostage 2.doesn't give a fuck 3.stronk 4.probably taller than the eiffel tower
tubbo looks adorable in the sailers uniforn 😍😍
I'm  12  probably a better driver than you
dude wilbur just enforcing slavery upon tubbo-
BRB imma go cry I could’ve met all my comfort streamers so easily-
We aren’t french just to inform you Jack
Where is Gakmaster
is it just me or is it just that I wanna be tested in the water by someone
I am have not finished the video and I hope tubbo does not thro his grandma in the ocean if he does loos
does somebody know the name of the song they played on the speakers?
#RipJack'sMoney
4:32 I do too Tubbo I do too
Comfort video
wil just effortlessly throwing jack into the water is terrifying
Rip that music clip ayyyy
4:31 Another time stamp of one of my favorite parts :)
1:07 This is for me (And anyone else obsessed with this moment) :)
This is a daily reminder to come watch this video.
WHEREFORE ART THOU MANIFOLD????
Wilbur: Drink sea water it’s good for you  Me: Drinking animal piss is good for you?
For some reason I don’t like minx for some reason like I can see it like what
Tobbo: I like boyz.            Wilbur. :  laughing
Salt: Made of sodium and chlor Tubbo when he tastes salt: Potassium
alternative title: *wilbur trying to get tubbo to drink salt water*
Wilbur stronk
"why are you wearing two caps?" "I'm the *cap* tain"
I just went over that sea
Jack: if you don’t subscribe your a bad person   Me: I know I’m a bad person thanks for the reminder    Also sorry jack it’s just for me there no point to subscribe but I do love your content
4:53 yes
5:57 this is you
Were the bad people u tired to throw someone in the sea for views
Will. Hand over the gender. give it. right now
Here is a time stamp of Wilbur holding Jack 9:48 Thank me later
Welp, i’m a bad person then
Ah yes, i forget cormorants are called doritos by sea captains. English, a beautiful language. I guarantee Wilburs favourite comedian is James Acaster, just makes sense
9:51  The fanfics finna start acting up again
Wilbur being the badest of the group 😂😭😙💅
up the gosport
Nikki going “moo” is so funny 😂
Yes wil you saved Niki from the cold water and just threw another soul in
Imagine being on a peaceful cruise and then seeing jack, niki, tubbo and wilbur racing in little boats
I haven't touched grass in months but can't stop that back manifold grind 😪     Series fly I think I need help I just watch the kitchen gun song like 30 times in a row
5:33 dhmis vibes lmao
I’ve just realised that I steered my uncles boat in the same place as you. Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight are very nice places. Also this is where sidemen hide and seek on a private island was.
who’s here after they took the clip of them listening to freddy mercury out
Tubbo is the cap-a-captain
your not allowed to throw niki into the sea
poor jack hahahahahahahaha
Rewatching this video I totally forgot Jack started with the Captain’s hat.
these videos are really helping me with my thalassa-phobia
9:00 SHE LOOKS SO PRETTY OMGGGGGG
Hi
4:32
Where’s tommyinnit
sorry but Wilbur is the main character👏
The middle finger is ROYAL
3:00 should be a meme format
Yup, imma start saying “fucketh off”
I like boys -tubbo
"Fucketh off"  -Jack Manifold
Who else wants them all to go camping 😅🏕️
I just realised Wilbur was drinking Radnor water and I’m so happy
Wilbur. Your a legit icon.
9:53 why did Wilbur throw him in there like that? 😭
Lets be honest-without wilbur being there-it wouldnt have been the same UvU
Wilbur definitely picks up people for fun, convince me otherwise   "Fucketh off" ngfhjvcfujb
That's my home town portsmouth
We are not French
I feel bad for the boat drivers, they like just have to put up with their shit, but to be honest if I was the boat driver I would be laughing my ass off
i’m rewatchinG EDIT: j just noticed jack had to completely take out the part of tubbo and wilbur were singing queen bc of dmca
tubbo just wants to be captain! let him be captain
"I like boys"              - Tubbo, a 16 y'o *_boy_*
It will be funny if wilbur jumps to the other boat and pushes the other boaters out and hijack it
My family is Catholic
_"what did you bring"_ _"I brought Niki and Will"_ Niki and Wilbur are apparently things now
The boats we rode werent as fancy as these Lmao, AFTER THE RIDE WE WERE COVERED IN SEA WATER.
Tubbo: we are the champions my friends!  Dream, quackity, george, karl: flashbacks
2:58 Jack: "I have no fears of loss! I've never lost anything ever! Name one thing I've lost." Tubbo: "Past relationships!" Niki: The Love or Host! Me: *h a i r .*
Hi Jack manifold you're so funny to me Myer like you wash you every single day I am 11 years old
Me eating Doritos while will says we call that a dorito: he is watching me 0-0
niki is beautigik
Wilbur forcing Tubbo to drink sea water gives me the same vibes as 𝗠𝗨𝗟𝗘 𝗕𝗜𝗧𝗦
Like son like father  Fundy: jack mani drown *in mc* Wilbur: JACK MANI DROWN *irl*   You can’t tell me they have a good relationship (fundy and wilbur)
Tubbo and Wilbur going insane Niki and jack:💓👍
6:52 *plays Pirates Of The Carribean*
Wow! Wilbursoot is strong!

Damn  they  really took out the Freddie Mercury song
"Thats gotta be the best pirate i've ever seen." "So it may seem.."

“We’re like the turtles in finding nemo” *too funny wilbur*
Imagine jack doing the titanic scene with will💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 Edit: He did it with niki!☺️☺️☺️
This isn’t anything to do with the vid but why does jack look like number 4 fr9m number jacks

I love in the end when Wilbur throws Jack off the boat. I want to redraw this picture, and I might actually do that now.
me :*german* wilbur:gesundheit me:*shocked*
the mule bits shop expands trade.
Captain manifold ✨✨
Wilbur just picked up Jack and just threw him to protect Niki. It reminds me of the time techno protected Tommy from dream like an absolutist boss.
*Shit* I am Catholic lmao
Mr Manifold Needs To Be A Captain, I'm Saying This Because Reasons  (Edit) Yeah Wilbur Is A Bad Captain: I'm Joking :)
Pfffft lmao 3:01
the Romeo and Juliet part is true literature
My loud washing machine came up in the suspense part
Wilbur and Tubbo just f*ckin' rubber banded lmao
Will is so smug omg
srsly niki is so pretty
I love how chill Wilbur was about this like Jack was genuinely concerned about winning while Tubbo and Wil were just vibing
6:22 nooo it's actually cut out
No one:   Wilbur: Gesündheit.
The boat drivers look confused the whole time
1:06
rip singing part, you will be missed </3
Lol tubbo likes boys
Tubbo and Wilbur relationship on camera is needed more in the world.     I love how the entire time until the end they didn't care about the race.
Noooo You guys took out the best scene!!! I literally came back just to see the shot with Tubbo and Wilbur jamming to Queen. It was such a awesome shot and edit. R. I. P to the people who will never see.
JACK MANIFOLD BEING HELD LIKE A BABY SUPERMACY

Me: don't throw Niki off the boat! Throw Jack!  (Wilbur thows jack off boat) Me: yes
This comment was copyrighted “spongboy”
Cassawsys we are cassawsys
“Poor grandma 😔” Huh? “I’ve brought an urn”
WHY IS JACK SO SMALL
me watching once the it came out: *jamming to Freddy mercury*  me watching now: Where's the Freddy mercury?
Jack did u drop the camera at the end!?
I love that Wilbur noticed Nikki genuinely didn't want to be thrown into the water so he did it to Jack instead lol friendship goals honestly
*Jack pointing* Wilbur: “Don’t touch me” Time stamp: 1:16 Such a sibling thing
jack manifold never got out. thats his evil twin brother
Wilbur kinda a SIMP
we are like romeo and juliet! though we are from different boats-  im not in love with him.  where thou art thou manifold?!  here! yours is the east as mine is the west!  fucketh off!!
i was supposed to go to the isle of wight on the 20th of June! tbh i wish i went cause i could've seen u!
The stare from niki at the end was terrifying. Wilbur being tall and superior is terrifying.
“What other mysteries do you have today?” “Mysteries?! This isn’t Scooby doo”
Where's Tommy
I live on the Isle of Wight
"Fucketh off."  - JackManifoldTV 2021
seeing Jack get yeeted into the sea by Wilbur was the most satisfying sight to see       also that was better than Tubbo's URN GOING INTO THE SEA!

It was never meant to be

The pure satisfaction Niki had in her face was priceless man I loved it!
1:09

It's weird to think that I live in Portsmouth.

Jack mani fall off boat
FÜR DAS DEUTSCHE VATERLAND
REDDIT SUPREMACY
Wilbur save niki from getting thrown in the water.
yo, jack lost the gopro
Isle of white is English
I have never seen niki swear today was a blessing day hearing her swear
* nihachu swore * willbur: she just swore.
Tubbo: “ I like boys “ “ welp- “ Me: “ I KNEW IT “ also me: “ dying of laughter “
_silence speaks volumes._
wilbur: urs is the east as mine is the west jack: fucketh off pls 😭
Jack is tiny compared to will XD
Why is Wilbur so tall lol
Jack: Theyre are the ones to blame! Niki; So you have chosen... death  creds to patrick schneer for the idea
"what is it with women valuing that?" LMAO
Jack Hairifold
every like = one more cigarette to fuel jacks smoking addiction 🚬
Did you get a woppa
The real fans remember the short bit of don’t stop me now that was played
TUBBOO!!!
Skipper soot XD
I know how to drive a boat but my parents and grandparents do not let me park the boat also I am 11

Who remember when he release this vlog they put Freddy mercury song
6:23 Love the fact they had to actual cut that whole queen bit out 🤣
Clicked for Wilbur, stayed for Wilbur
i just love niki swear Xd
Cutest hug ever🤧🤧
Wilbur saying don't touch me got me uncle vibes
Who else rewinded the part where Wilbur threw jack in about 10 times.
"Did you bring a valuable object",  "Yeah, I bought an urn",  "You realize if you lose you have to throw that in the ocean",  "What did you bring?",  "oh I brought Niki"    *jazz music stops*  "and I brought Wilbur for you"  *jazz music restarts*
that single circle moment was such a massive flex
Jack Manicold
I almost never hear Niki swear.
WILBUR JUST PICKS JACK UP LIKE IT'S NOTHING AND T O S S E S HIM IN I LOVE THAT
We had wilbur and jack moments *POG*
I would like to take a moment for Isle of Wight appreciation
I hate this guy. He thinks he's funny which is so sad since he's the most dull person I've seen
Omg, I had no idea you were in Portsmouth. I love it down there. My sister goes to Uni there. It’s so lovely. Especially to hear you guys were down there then.
How dare u get rid of my favorite part of this vid😑
If only gogy was there Jack and Nihachu would've won
THE LOOK NIKKI GAVE AT 8:59 OMFG
Wilbur:That's a sign of pollution Jubilee line + Saline Solution
Wilbur forces Tubbo to drink sea water and kill mule...  What a good relationship!
OMG IM GOING TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT ON MONDAY
Yay
dorito
Are we not going to talk about how the driver of Jack Manifolds boat looks a bit like Nico Rosberg?
Wait I've never seen a Niki video without Wilbur Coincidence I think not
“That’s a Dorito.” The shag: 👁👄👁
hasn't got mouth in it, mate... smouth.
Pog
Wilbur is so tall LOL! Wilbur: Height of an ender dragon standing on 2 feet. Jack: size of a rabbit on 2 legs :,)
ojkojkojkojkojkojkojkojkojkojkojkojkojkojkojkokojkojkojkojkojkojkojkojkojkojk                                                                                                                                                              hi
9:52 THIS IS GOING TO BE A SHIP IMAGE I SWEAR😭

Jack be looking like Scout from tf2
The image of Wilbur lumbering over jack at the end is horrifying
Nice man
rewatching this vlog, not knowing that the singing part was cut off. bye im going to cry now- f*#^ copyright
“Fucketh off” XD I CANT LOL
Can we talk about wilbur's leg? *fangirl noises*
niki said a swear word
WHY IS NOBODY POINTING OUT THAT JACK LOST THE CAMERA AT THE END BAHAHHAHAHA
I still can't get over the fact Wilbur and tubbo demolished jack in the race while being behind them for most of the race
Jack at the beginning of the video: I’m the captain Tubbo only 28 seconds later: I am the captain now
and this is how astronaut in the ocean was made.
If you don’t subscribe, your such a bad person.
Funny thing Isle of Wight isn’t even across the channel
they were literally in my city and i missed them );
9:10 made me laugh so hard, for no apperent reason
O
to think that 3 weeks ago i was on holiday at the Isle of Wight and three weeks ago this video was made makes me hate the world and everything on it.  i will go commit arson now....
Why did wilbur and tubbos bost do that loop thingy? I think ibe seen it before but like whats the practical reason
Jack: I could throw Niki in the water Wilbur: Not if I throw you first
Ok, but why haven’t I seen anyone talking about how Wilbur carried Jack bridal style with *relative ease?* Like, I know that he’s short and has to hair weight, but Will is still picking up a fully grown adult male. He’s also broken through his window by straight up palm striking it trying to catch his camera. Has no one thought about how strong Wilbur is? I’m scared
WAS THE DRIVER OF JACKS BOAT SMALLISHBEANS????
“Fucketh off!”  -Jackmanifold
9:58 jack mani-DROWN
Drink more seawater  -Wilbur Soot

BRUH WHY DID U TAKE UP SMOKING >:[.   I SHALL UN SUB.   (jk)
Wilbur forcing Tubbo to drink sea water has the same vibe as Mule Bits
My mom works for Mercury
Jack: I'm going up starboard Also Jack: *continues to not go starboard*
4:51
"From the east and from the west..."  *"FUCKETH OFF"*
what have i lost nothing   name one thing that i have lost  past relationships   but he has never had any   love or host   well it was going to go any ways
Plz make more vids on the isle of wight
niki hug Jack
Rip the iconic clip of wilbur and tubbo blasting don't stop me now
Wilbur protect Wilbur attack Wilbur throws Jack Manifold into the ocean Wilbur protect Nikki
at 6:20 I think there was a part which is now cut out due to copyright:( it was tubbo and Wilbur jamming to Freddy Mercury’s song. I think it’s called “don’t stop me now”. It was so wholesome… sad it got cut out
Not gonna lie though the super Mario sunshine remix at the end had me hyped af
Why is Wilbur so toll and lanky
Captain *Baldman*
I would've loved to see aqua Nikki tho
Can we just appreciate how Will and Tubbo won even tough they did that little circle At one point lmao-
3:19 look how long Wilburs legs are-now km scared-
mamas
I’m not subsrcribing to a smoker TwT  Wait I just did-
9:37  wilbur is jelous
At. The end it sounds like someone broke the door 😂
FAVORITE 6:45
Wilbur says "gesundheit" so cute omg ^^ btw i am a girl from germany ;3
Nihachu and will should team and jack and tubbo teamed
POV: ik ur blushing cuz niki and wilbur are sitting next together
OMG THAT WAS THEM 😂😂😂 I was in the Wight link😂 I didn't know
Just realized that there no more   Wilbur Soot and Tubbo jamming to don't stop me now😢
Tubbo- I like boys  Is he gay? Confirmed???  Jk (͡°͜ʖ͡°)
I came back and they took out the jam session!!! :'(
9:50
Pokemo you have any quackity
stronk wilbur
my goal in life is to be ragdoll thrown by wilbur soot just like jack manifold was
The question we’ve all wished to answer… where fore art though, Manifold?
PLEASE I THOUGHT WILL WAS BRYCE HALL ON THE THUMBNAIL😭😭😭😭😭
I'm kinda glad that jack lost because tubbo would have said bye bye to grandma
Im sad that jack took out even that little bit of the Dont Stop Me Now portion
See how wilbur just behaved when niki is there-
the fact they actually had to edit the video because of the copyrighted music is so funny to me
6:19 did he edit it? cause i swear that bit was longer
god, how are wil's legs so long??
Noooooo now they completely took out the Freddie Mercury clip, at least before we got a tiny clip, it was amazing  So sad😪
I went to the ocean and my little brother  drank the water because of this video
DONT STOP ME NOW!! CAUSE IM HAVIMG A GOOD TIME IM HAVING A BALL,IF YOU WANNA HAVE A GOOD TIME JUST GIVE ME A CALL
When niki hold jack
"F*cketh off"
cringe
4:33 whatdidhesay
Hmmmnnm

Omg I love this Vlog man
Willbur: Gesundheit (german)  Jack: They’re not speaking english, thats french
9:10 Niki swore
Drink more seawater. It's good for you.                   -Wilbur Soot       So inspiring.

This is great
Tubbo: wow that’s a cool looking bouy   Also tubbo: I like boys
E
Wait if you guys are in PR just saying you should go to Edith San Juan and maybe go to the beaches
The faded starter intraspecifically need because bankbook macropharmacologically prick next a encouraging warm. tasty, needless network

How did Wilbur pick Jack up so effortlessly jesus
POV: You like races
Where’s gakmaster?
The chosen ones heard Tubbo and Wilbur singing Don't stop me now.
"Drink more sea water" - wilbur soot
The Way Wilbur says mouth 😂
The glare Nikki gives jack at 9:00 and the way he cowers from it
Ok but like am I the only one that had a flashback to The Mule Bits shop when Wilbur forced Tubbo to inhale sea water?
Back in my day, we swam the crossing and ate the girl... this generation is so PC
Jack - name one thing I've lost Toby - past relationships Niki - the love or host
Everybody gangsta til Niki gets mad
*Nikki swore* Will: she swore x2 Also will Ok then lets throw the lil man down the sea
Thank you for helping me when I was not ok and when i had panic attacks, you don't know me and im just a fan but thank you❤🙏😔
Good run captain
It is sad that he now cut out the part with Tubbo and Wilbur jamming away
Wilbur is so hot but he hates anteaters >:

Guys guys, imagine the video having Captain's Call song by Derivakat, 😂 it's so amazing
Me: a catholic 👁👄👁
"fucketh off" - Jack manifold 2021 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wilbur is so strong. First he carried George on his back, then he picked up Jack-
Poor grandma- 😭👵 💀 0:42
I’m scared Wattpad writers will write “Romeo and Juliet, willbur x jack manifold, love separated by boats”
"They're not speaking English. They're speaking french."  After Wilbur literally said the german word for Bless you. As a german, I'm equally triggered AND amused!
fricketh off
"I like boys" ~Tubbo,2021
Into the Drink
I love these wholesome videos of just, friends doing things most dream of.. good luck you guys and keep enjoying every moment of your time together!
jack is growing hair 😟
‘Fucketh off’ lmao 😂
5:43 ah yes s l u g drop
Nooooo they cut out the part with don’t stop me now
based on every vlog, i have to say wilbur is the strongest
Alternative title:Wilbur being simp for 30 seconds
I never heard Niki swear-
WILL RANBOO BE IN THE STREAMS?!?!?!
I laughed so much that I am currently having a coughing fit and it’s worse because my brother is asleep so I’m trying to be quiet. Comment f so I don’t die.
Wilbur: Trying to romance Jack Jack: Fucketh off😭 Everyone take notes, your future relationships depend on it.
I love how Wilbur's boat did a whole loop and still won
I forgot how tall Wilbur was then I saw him throw jack in the water like he was a small child
Fun fact  They had a speaker system. I guess they cut that out after it was posted.    (I watched this as soon as it was posted)
6:43 this is wholesome and cute and I love it.
Today I found out Wilbur is strong enough to throw Jack Into the sea...  Could he throw Techno?
“I like boys”. That deserves to be in the quote book
*We have the vlog team*   Wilbur. Jack. Niki. Tubbo. Tommy.    *This comment has no purpose*
ive been to isle of wight
I NEED THE SONG FROM 7:00
The pointless elbow finally request because food admittedly blot among a cagey dance. productive, gullible gusty fly
"Fvcketh off" Truly inspiring 😂
And once again, Wilbur has come to save Nikki. This time, from being tossed into the ocean.
What's new Wilbur Doo, they're coming after you, in their fellow racing boat
I thoroughly enjoyed the part when Wilbur threw Jack into the sea like he was a matchstick and didn't do it to Niki <3 such great friends
PORTSMOUTH
<3
jack manifall off boat
Willbur is the true captain.
Was anyone else here before Jack cut out Wilbur and Tubbo singing "don't stop me now"?
6:23 It used to have more here, right? I liked that part...
The descriptive platinum physiologically long because hamster prudently saw opposite a polite direction. fancy, cute cork
6:23 i was lucky to see this before it was removed
YOHHHHH THEY REMOVED THE BIT WHERE WILBUR AND TUBBO WHERE SINGING
Wil and Tubbo's captain was a Chad
Ok but Niki is so pretty 😩
Fun fact: I used to live in the Isle of Wight then I moved to South Africa
https://youtu.be/BjDebmqFRuc
Everyone is talking about how savage Niki was but Im literally obsessed with the fact Wilbur is so strong. First he carried George on his back while running, he picked up Jack easily, he picked George and Tommy from water a  couple times, and also we know he threw Niki, so he must be really strong. I didnt know gym works THAT well.
"Wilbur picking up Jack and throwing him to the sea"  "Fundy throwing Jack and putting water on him"  Like father like son.
OoOoO WILBURS PHONNEEE
The spicy branch hemodynamically like because education genotypically number onto a thick governor. sloppy, like dorothy
Mule bits....
Jack: name one thing I've lost. Nikki: THE LOVE OR HOST!
The Instagram makes more sense now lmao
Dude the bit when tubbo and wilbur were singing got skipped i am going to go cry now
4:28 S.S. Krill
Me the whole video 😃 literally help I cannot stop smiling 😂 I love videos like that it’s hilarious
wilbur is such a simp he literally threw manifold into th sea so niki didn’t have to AGDUHSJXNJSJD
Jack like nolan from mrbeast
Why Wilbur looks jealous
bruh wilbur is so tall compared to jack
Wilbur and Tubbo look like they’re just having such a good time
I could have sworn there was a part where wil n tubbo sang
WILBUR IS A SIMP
HE EDITED SO WE DIDNT SEE WILBUR SING WITH TUBBO  :(((
“I HAVE TO GO INTO THE FUCKING WATER” 👁👄👁
Team reddit lollllllllll
They cut out any Freddie Mercury,  there use to be some
“Fucketh off” I have never heard a more perfect sentence
WILBER SIMP CHECK
Jack is so small next to Wilbur
MY SISTER SAW YOU SHE WAS ON A FERRY. imso jealous im crying
When your grandma uncle and cousins live in the isle of white but u live on the main lands😑😭😭😭😭
HAHAHAA WILBUR RLLY PICKED HIM UP AND THREW HIM IN
5:04 "FUCKETH OFF"
Everyone ok: Yes! WE DIDNT DROWN Niki on the other hand: I HAD TO GK INTO THE *the bad word* WATER

How Wilbur just picks up Jack bridal style though
Wow, that's a cool lookig buoy.. I like boys!  - Tubbo 2021
At one point they just went “let’s sacrifice Niki to the sea”
awwww when niki put her arms around jack just awww
Wilbur threw you so dramatically lol
i love how wilbur just admitted he loved the smell of gasoline- burning stuff wilbur?
Only the real ones remember the Fredie Mercury bit... o7 it was so funny tho

Seabur
Okay I admit that I don't know much about how human strength works but Wilbur just straight up picked up jack effortlessly and yeeted him into the ocean, Wilbur is just ripped

Nikki curses Jack: 😰" she just said a swear word"
I love Jack’s accent holy—
HAVING A GOOD TIIIMEE
the fact that u dont need any special camera gear to film videos and just ur iphone
I never considered how tall Wilbur or how short manifold was until they stood next to each other
The way Wilbur just manhandled jack and threw him into the water  🤣🤣🤣
POV : *You are me when i wanna compliment a guy and tell him that i'm gay btw* 4:30
Comfort video moment<3
NO THE FREDDIE MERCURY SCENE WHY COPYRIGHT HOW COULD YOU
"silence speaks volumes" 😔🤙🏻
pretty sure they updated when they were playing don’t stop me now and there’s no part of them singing to it:,) it was my favorite part
I often get Doritos confused with lays
6:46 yay titanic reference go boom
"drink more sea water" thats my idol
Idk why but is it me or he looks like Milly but boy adult version?
Wilbur should have been Captain
you do know that seawater has pee in it
Wilbur being romantic Jack rejects him Wilbur throws him in the ocean
Rip the clip where Wilbur puts the song on speaker.
NOOOO MY FAVORITE BIT WAS CUT :(
Lol😂
YEAH, DA SCOOBY
Wilbur : more sea water tubbo
Sus
Jack manifold is the coolest

NO JACK CUT THE PART WHERE TUBBO AND WILBUR SING FOR A LITLLE BIT
SHIIIIPP
The secretive semicircle adversely step because burglar indirectly suffer down a abandoned chive. disagreeable, abashed height
I can actually drive a boat
you guys need an innit
tubbos and wilburs captain has a massive brain
Dream is the one driving JAHSJSHSJS JK
Jack and nikki is so cute not gonna lie
Did any one see Wilbur pink socks no hate I think it is funny
that was such a good video
u know that isle of wight is still UK right?
I think tubbo just gave me an amazing way to come out.
aw man they removed the tubbo and wilbur jaming out it was crazy tho
C’mon Why did the Freddie Mercury part get cut out :(
I didnt realize will was that tall 💀
The savory tanzania ultimately rhyme because half-brother cosmetically harass into a present modem. late, tired mirror
"I like boys" :- A legend, while snorting saline water.
5:13 My mom forcing me to eat my vegetables when I was a kid:
I love in Portsmouth
Wow jack is such a g he took up smoking for us
He went from Jack Mani-fall off bridge to Jack Mani-fall in water
1:02 FORESHADOWING oh my god
the biggest loss from this video was the captain hat
Wilbur is so incredibly tall lmao
Tubbo: “WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS MY FRIEND” Jack: “SHUT UP”
WILBURS STRONG
Why is no one talking about how Tubbo brought an URN
ITS A BOAT
why did you throw nihachu in the water
wilbur carries every video he’s in
This is the best video I've ever seen
"Smouth"  -Wilbur Soot
This was very odd
this was very odd
I will be rewatching this vlog every day until I die
I guess im a bad person
Jack: "Ive never even heard of Mercury!" Me: What about the Planet Mercury XD Jack: “Name one thing I’ve lost” Tubbo: “Past relationships” Niki: “The love or host” Jack: Immediate c r y
(Me being Catholic)😰
HairlongManifold
"Dad, why is my sister named Rose?" "Because your mother likes roses." "Thanks, dad!" "No problem, *wilbur soot and tubbo jamming to don't stop me now."*
I’m I the only person who thinks jacks hair looks like 011/Elevens from stranger things season 1  😂
Jack: "Why are you wearing two caps?"  Me: Cuz he's the CAP-tain
Imagine living on the island and was on the ferry they went past :(
I ship niki and wilbur so much
I AM LATE
Not my favourite you tubers being in my home town 😳
Seawater is basically the sea creature's toilet :)
omg the isle of wight is sutch a nice place to visit
Well i guess i am a bad person
Jack and Niki: *Team Rocket wanting to win* Wilbur and Tubbo: *chaotic brothers chatting*
I have a high fear of riding boats This is making me have more confidence
Can someone teach me how to add the @ links to other channels. Thanks in advance

That last scene made me realize how fucking short Jack is and how tall Will is, jesus.
This is we’re I live in Portsmouth
2:39  There is actually double meaning of this joke, if you know Polish. "Herring" is "śledź" in Polish, but the word "śledź" means both "herring" and "follow", which is actually what drones do
"silence speaks volumes" -wilbur soot 2021
6:20  Tubbo & Wilbur listening to Freddie Mercury
Tubbo & Wilbur : **waves in excitement** The people in the ship: 🧍‍♂️
Wilbur was a bit gea in this vid

''I have no fear of loss''               but i got no but i got no kakorrhaphiophobia ,phobia,phobia =]
Everyone's talking about anything but no one really talked about Jack looking like Scout from TF2
just a video of tubbo following jschlatt footsteps
tubbo: im the captain!  jschlatt watching: no im the captain- **child attraction noises**
RIP Jack Manithrown-of-dock  He lived a good life as a man of the grind. Unfortunately, he was swept off his feet. You will never be forgotten, Jack Manidrown.
alternative title: niki and jack being two pretty best friends
Team Willbo when they speed up: I AM SPEED
A
how come i dont get to be thrown into the water :<
Niki: is supposed to be thrown in the water Wilbur: have no fear milady
Wilbur carrying the whole vid
7:07 *titanic music intensifies*
where's tommyinnit, this could be 1000% funnuer
If you don't subscribe you're a bad person.  -Jack
someone said that techno have more content on other people's channel than his own and wilbur is starting to follow
rule: bring something valuable. if you lose, you'll throw it into the sea  tubbo: brings grandma's urn jack: brings niki
The humdrum cocoa excitingly advise because harbor coherently stuff athwart a miniature shallot. tested, devilish interest
5:21 that’s what she said
“Fucketh off”  ~Manifold 2021
Tubbo: GIve me a quote! Wilbur: *Drink more seawater.*
Name one thing I lost Past relationships *the love or host* _Violated_
jack predicted the copyright in the video 😌
I just got back from racing boats for a week and I saw this was posted while I was in the middle of a race
god that made my day
This is one of the best videos i  have seen
R.i.P Tubbo for Drinking Sea water
No one: Jack: "Do you know what happened to Freddie Mercury?" Tubbo: "You have a piano on the back of your boat!"
"Drink the seawater," - Wilbur Soot, 2021
“HIII TUBBO” “HIII WILL”
Me:Jack you are the one who needs to be thrown in the water considered you are the "Captain" of the boat. :D
Niki "I have to go Into the fucking water" The boys "OMG SHE JUST SWORE" Me "it's not the first time :>"
Officially not a bad person
*Wilbeo and Jackiet*
You had a good run
I love how Wilbur and Tubbo where just bonding
6:39 is where the best part starts lol
Tubbo is tiny man :3
silence does in fact speak volumes
barotrauma in a nutshell
As someone who is from the IOW....we're not French 🤣
Imma be honest I only watched this for Wilbur and Tubbo
Gesundheit is not french it’s German and it means health
my friends telling me so fake story about what the did this summer
Wats the name/model of the glasses that wilbur uses
are we just not gonna talk about niki's absolute RAGE at the end?
I generally got tense and sceared when niki swore
1:45 I LIVE IN FUCKING PORTSMOUTH! POGGARS!
Rename it to "I raced across the channel" not the Ocean
I need to see the full clip of when they were playing don't stop me now, it literally makes me so happy
"I like boys"  lets get the fanfic started
cool
“did you see me slug drop?” i am deceased
Mays
Wilbur saved Niki from being thrown in the water. *sniffs* So wholesome.
junkook
That titanic moment with Jack and Nikki was iconic
i can see where i live rn freaking out xxxxx
YOOOO IVE BEEN THERE
wilbur is the chadest of chads for casually picking up jack bridal style like he was nothing, that was actually very epic
Last time i checked jack had no hair
3.05 poor Jack🥺
Wilbur: ah drystack good cinema that is  Me: um that's... Oh Wilbur
BIG UP THE PORT OF MOUTH
Okay but can we talk about how strong Wilbur probably is. This seems like a win for Wimbler Scoot
Wilbur and Tubbo are literally THE iconic duo
there’s no way that you are in porstmouth why are you going everywhere i’ve been
This vlog was one of my favorite vlogs but just imagine if they could of used all the clips of Tubbo and Wilbur listening to music on the boat, that would've been so cool haha
-Gesundheit -they‘re not speakin english they‘re- that’s french Germany: 🙂🔫
I started laughing hysterically at the “Fucketh off”  Mum I’m famous ✨👄✨
4:32 Beeduo
YAHHHHH POGGERRRSSS
I MISSED YOU GUYS BY A COUPLE DAYS IM ACTUALLY PISSED RN AAAAAAAAAAAAA
Wilbur: Wherefore art thou Manifold Jack: Here! Me: ?? Jack that wasn't the question
What is with tubbo and queen .-. First this then the ranboo stream last night
Somebody: you are now a cow Me: hello I’m Henry and my fathers name is tommyinnt👁👄👁
My class would have gone to the Isle of white this year but we couldnt because if covid 😭😭😭😭 The good thing is that we get to do laser tag 😜☺️
I LOVE PORTMOUTH I ALWAYS GO THEresee
The gang
the height difference between wilbur and jack is terrifying
whats the pirate music that played during the race????
“Drink more seawater”  *Salt content in the oceans drop to 0*
why can i smell the water
When Wilbur and tubbo are dancing with the hats is so cute and funny
jack ruins his whole relationship because of a challenge
What u know abbout rollin down in the deep😳
Jackmani-thrown? Jackmain-thrown off boat? Jackmani-drown-
Jake what do you know abote faling down in the dipe
The whole condition baly command because ikebana specifically spray past a ugliest accountant. cluttered, pricey slash
God damn I just now realised how fucking long Wilbur's legs are when he put them up on the seat ಠ_ಠ Edit: holy crap I didn't expect this to get so many likes ;-;
he’s growing hair the manifold is growing hair 😭😭✌️
LOL JACK IS SOOO SHORT 😂😂😂
Gesundheit :D
wilbur is such a massive chad in this video
It's funny because I sail (flex), and I knwo that small boats make way for larger ones, therefore that boat had all the right to cut across, although it was a tad close.
jack in the ocean.. i feel uneasy
Saw the thumbnail and "damn, if that is not the whitest looking group of people I've ever seen in my whole damn life" ...makes more sense now I see that they're British. 😂   From another person with western European genes... please wear good sunscreen and reapply it often out there on the water lol
“yeah so we’re going to the Isle of Wight” “are we going to cows?” “moo” i appreciated that -a cattle farmer
Nikki is literally the prettiest person ever

Tubbo is still the Ass captain XD

5:58 w o w xD *takes ss to make memes*
Castaways we are castaways

Everyone in the comments is quoting the video, and here I am just enjoying the Super Mario Sunshine soundtrack
"That’s a cool looking boy! I like boys!"                                        -Tubbo

"Drink More Seawater" ~Wilbur Soot 2021
God is merciful and caring , he sent Jesus Christ to be your salvation to eternal life .this world is falling apart and all who are have not accepted Jesus Christ as savior will fall also , but Jesus saves ! Today is the day to make that choice , you may not see tomorrow .
how did you not get copyrighted for using queen but i get copyrighted for using the music that came from the microsoft video editor wtf youtube
The drunk congo habitually fill because refund regrettably smile into a staking hexagon. square, receptive humidity
is no one gonna talk about Wilbur forcing Tubbo to drink seawater?
oh no don't worry about wilbur just casually picking up jack like it was just about nothing, how strong is wilbur or how light is jack???
9:20 the death stare Amazing 😂
I love when jack pointed to Niki she didn’t say anything to her teammate then Wilbur immediately said hi to Tubbo. And they way Tubbo just listened to Wilbur was cute, also Wilbur is an icon. Wilbur and Tubbo together are so cute they are like brothers ❤️
wilbur and tubbo jamming to freddie mercury is everything-
✨
Nobody: The people driving the boats: 🥲 👁👄👁                                                            💧    💧
4:30 that’s a cool looking buoy! I like boys  HAHAHAHA
Wilburs legs are LOOOOOOONG
Wilbur's strength is somehow too powerful to comprehend. I can't believe he just casually picked up jack and threw him like he was a bag of chips
I'm so confused on what type of thing Jack and Niki have going on like are they together or not EXPLAIN!!
i can name something jack manifold lost…         his hair
aw poor niki
did niki lose weight
Can we talk about how Wilbur has RADNOR water
Tubbo- “What a cute looking buoy. I love buoys” Bahaha omg
"Tubbo more seawater!! mmm! It's good for you!"  *nervous flashbacks to mulebits*
jack shouldve titled of the video " I rolled across the ocean"
The most funny part : 6:38
I can't be the only one who cheered when Jack got thrown in instead of Nikki right?
When Tubbo starts drinking sea water I remember accidentally swallowing a lot of sea water. It was very very salty
THE GRIND NEVER STOPS
“Drink more sea water” -Wilbur Soot
I LITERALLY JUST REALIZED JACK IS GROWING HAIR!?
Wheres Wilbur's brother THOMAS
6:35 this is so wholesome
6:40 WHATS THE SONG
That building that Wilbur changed to Reddit gold was actually a tower my god fathers friend painted lmao
Jack and Nikki: the front of the class Wilbur and Tubbo: the back of the class
7:05 The titanic remake was so sad It has a very important message
My teacher once made my class drink salt water to learn the differences of a lake and the ocean
JackBaldifoldTV
10:14 oh to be jack manifold
10:07  Wilbur: Ur not that guy trust me ur just not that guy  Jack: and you are?  Wilbur: absolutely *throws Jack into ocean*
Wilbur yeeting Jack is very pog.
I've been to the Isle of Wight...    *i dont think they want to go there*
"Name on thing I lost" "Past Relationships" "The Love or Host" Jack: *B  I  G   C  R  Y*
Everyone better sub to jack for Wilbur holding jack bridal style
Lmao imagine Gakmaster just showing up in one of the vlogs
Niki looks way much more stronger than Jack xD
Why is nobody talking about tubbo saying I like bois
Imagine having lungs That don’t immediately freeze up when you go into cold water quickly
THE WAY WILBUR JUST PICKED UP JACK WITH NO EFFORT- I-
The reason Tubbo has two caps is because he’s the CAPtain… see- see what I’d did there?
“ I like boys.”                  ~ Tubbo , 2021
Repent follow Jesus
Best vlog every!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh just imagine dancing and singing to Don't Stop Me Now on a boat with your friends- I can't imagine how surreal and lovely that feels
What with the links in every replied section?
Niki: You're going to throw me in the ocean? ;-; Jack: Yeah! And I didn't tell you! Wilbur: Don't worry Niki, I got this. Jack, move over here. Jack: Wha? What? Why? Wilbur: *picks up Jack* Jack: Hold up- wait a second- no no no no! Wilbur: *throws Jack into the ocean* Tubbo: *laughs*  Yep, basically this
mOWth  SMOOTH
I swear to God, Jack's channel is turning into those adventure channels- 😂
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW NIKI HUGGED JACK FROM BEHIND ON THE BOAT LIKE THATS SO CUTE (not shipping)
Tubbo: wow! that's a cool looking buoy!........... I like boys!
Pirates of the Caribbean deleted scene
You know when wilbur gives u the camera and says “you had a good run” that your about to get thrown ( he did it to tommyinnit to btw)
Shipping Wilbur x Jack 😍🤌🙄🦶
This is literally the best video ive ever seen so far😂
captain jack sparrow
So yeah I know Wilbur said they should do fanart of him casually lounging in the boat but, please. I need fanart of Wilbur chucking jack into the ocean. thank you.
The fact that Wilbur could technically pick almost anyone of us up and throw us into the ocean terrifies me.
steel ball run anime is crazy
I love these vlogs so much
Wilbur definitely is main character vibes in Jack and Tom's vlogs 😭
Aaaa
All Danny Duncan viewers will now that damnet, you don't drive a boat, you Conn it
Jesus gave me peace love and mercy when I did not deserve it. He let me go of hate and burden on my heart. This is why I KNOW JESUS CHRIST is my Lord and Savior✝️❤️✨
The Captains Is just chilling and confused
Drink more seawater, Its good for you. -Wilbur
Jack complaining about being throw in the ocean by Will “Camera turns to Will” head bob from Will telling us he did it and he saved Niki from having to do it Oooo crush action from Will Oooo we will never know!
Anything Wilbur does seems so natural and intended that I didn't even realize his glasses are the shape that they are until halfway
“We’re like Romeo and Juliet” “I don’t feel like that!” “Although we are from different boats” “I’m not in love with him” “Wherefore art thou Manifold. Yours is the East as mine is the West!” “FUCKETH OFF!” By far the best lines ever. 😂
*are we not gonna question how small jack is when being held by wilbur?*
Wilbur are those doc/
90% of the comments are just   jack: name one thing ive lost   tubbo: past relationships   niki: love or host   jack: *visible pain*
5:01
jack and tubbo is GAY.
i think wilbur noticed niki wasn’t alright with being thrown in, so wilbur casually played it off and made jack fall in, god i love their friendship so much.  edit: can y’all stop being so rude in the reply’s? i just thought it was nice of him- and yes, i’ve been made aware that it’s scripted, you all can calm down now :’)
Jack: “Name one thing I’ve lost” Tubbo: “Past relationships” Niki: “The love or host” Jack: c r y
Realizing that the sea is a home of 2000 types of germs
In titanic: jack don’t let go The wilbur version: jack let me throw you in
Ngl I was singing along to “don’t stop me now “
Why is Tubbo always tortured by Wilbur or Tomm
THE SOCKS
Jack and niki: *actually competing and working hard* Wilbur and tubbo: *chillin, having a good time and still winning* Also Wilbur and tubbo: “HAVIN’ A GOOD TIME, HAVIN’ A GOOD TIME”
Wilbur is a mood
Strong man wilbut
3:11 is such a perfect time for ricco harbor
Woah I’ve never seen tubbo and Wilbur in the same place
where is tommy it will be more funnier.
my mom just left me but that manifold grind don’t stop
tubbo: b u o y s tubbo: tubbo: I LIKE BOYS
Look at how sassy wilbur look when throwing jack in the ocean😂
How easily Will picked up Jack is just hilarious.
This video: is basically awesome
10:30  He looks kinda like the kid from monster house 😭
Nobody:  Literally nobody: Tubbo and Wilbur singing on a boat:
6:25 for anyone wondering
poor tommyinnit :(
no cause i blushed when wilbur picked him up. im a literal wilbur simp and IMAGINING THIS RIGHT NOW.
Can we just admire how capable Wil is to pick up jack and throw him in the water

Thumb Nail looks like a family picture ngl
I’m pretty sure that the background music half way through was the pirates of the Caribbean

Silence speaks volumes

10:03 willbur lifts up Jack
Seeing that much hair on Jack feels illegal.
Ngl when she said she failed to set up LED lights I was dead laughing
nobody: wilbur: casually picks up jack and throws him into the water
You do realize if you lose you have to throw your important thing in the sea?     *Poor Grandma*
FCEL up 5% while AMC is kind of out of my price range right now, but I’m putting all my profits back into AMC little by little
LMFAO Wilbur just yeeted Jack into the sea without any hesitation
"Fucketh off" had me dying
I has thy poem,  Roses are red, Vileotes are blue, This poem is like poo, Jack says fucketh off.  I should be a poet.
A Ti que está leyendo este comentario Dios te bendiga siempre
Love the part when they talk about Freddie Mercury
Jack: “I’ve never lost anything” Tubbo: “past relationships” Niki: “Love or Host”  Jack: *Visible Pain* Jack: “I’ve lost things in the past” 😂😂😂
"fucketh off" 💀✋🏼
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🔻
Wilbur: Makes a poem for his love of Jack  Jack: Fucketh off
“WHAT US THIS SCOOBY DOO??”
4:33 We've been knew
THATS GOSPORT I LIVE IN GOSTPORT
“imma walk up to starboard”  walks to the bow
WHERES TOMMY
Wilbur telling tubbo to drink sea water is giving me mule bits vibes
I SAW THAT BIG WHITE THING AT THE START CUZ I WAS THERE LITTERLY LAST WEEK
WHAT I WAS THERE LAST FUCKING WEEK
Twatdom at its highest level. Clickbait title. You will not have a good life.
Not a surprise Tommy isn’t here😂
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I feel like jack has a crush on niki
Fundy: *JACK MANIDROWN*  Wilbur: *Throwing jack into the water*  Like father like son ig 🦊👏
*Those are the best pirates I've ever seen..*
0:10 tubbo
Titanic but better version
Wilbur just keeps throwing people or at least pushing them into water
Will looks so proud of himself 10:27
WHY IS MY CHILDHOOD HERE IM SCARED
Sheeshh
nice
“ this must be the best damn pirate I have ever seen. So it would seem
The fact that I recognise this is scary No bc I grew up here why is my childhood here
did they do that bc niki's clothing wouldve been see  through otherwise. they didnt realise that and now jack was thrown in. (or maybe they planned to throw jack in anyway. either way jack failed)
fucketh off is now my favorite manifold quote
🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
🖤🖤🖤🖤
“f*cketh off” must be my favorite quote
No one gonna talk about the way Wilbur holds Jack--- it's adorable -- and the fact he threw him in the water to defend Niki-- Wilbur's the best
Jack: Name one thing i lost! me:....... hair
He protecc He attacc  But most importantly Wilbur got nikis back
At The End Wilbur Sticking Up For Niki Was So Sweet-  Also I Loved Watching Jack Get Thrown In The Sea.
It’s videos like this that make me want to have friends
Wilbur has officially changed sides from eating sand, to drinking sea water
why is no one talking about 7:06 :")
i keep coming back for "fucketh off" and "...i've lost things in the past"
True royal navy
* vine thud effect * *automatic like*
I love how you don't give a fuck about the enviroment. Pollute that shit some more.
I literally saw my house in this video I really wish I was there at the timeeee
Jack: im quite strong actually  Me: oh no poor niki- Wilbur: **tosses jack to the water**
Drink more sea water  -Wilbur Soot 2021
"oh there boat is bounchin'! they're airborn!"

Captain Jack Spar- Manifold!!! Yeah Manifold!
Ah yes freddie mercury sounds a lot like queen
I love this!😩
why was this literally so entertaining aha
Wilbur would be the pirate captain
Bring a valuable item to throw: Wilbur sounds good to throw
My brother has the same sunglasses as Wilbur and I freaked out when I realized!
Seems that Tubbo is finally the Ass Captain lol
Oh no Tommy the Comedy master isn't here wihh tubbo and Wilbur
Is no one talking about how nikki actually looked intimidating when jack said "I'm very strong" and jackals genuinely looked scared  Edit: dont ask about the jackals part I just thought it was funny lol
Ayo was that Scout from TF2?

ILL NEVER LET GO JACK
"Fucketh off" - A wise man in the 1880's
Very funny content Mr. Manifold I have left a like.
3:05  5:04 9:20 BRO NIKI'S DISAPPOINTED FACE MADE ME FEEL SO GUILTY
i like boys
The voracious offer semiannually deliver because coal lamentably wink excluding a mean nigeria. mature, defiant continent
1:54 "The city's Old English Anglo-Saxon name, "Portesmuða", is derived from port (a haven) and muða (the mouth of a large river or estuary)" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth Jack you were right
My guy called the solent the channel🤣
GAy TuBbo?!? 4:32
If you fell off, this would’ve been #1 on trending, I bet.
Niki has roasted wilbur in an techno stream and now jack, tubbo watch out.
Niki: Not wanting to go in the water  Wilbur: your wish is my command  THROWS JACK IN
Istg if this is port solent im going to isle of white rn
6:41 just putting this here for me
Yes
Gesundheit
The way the driver ignores Wilbur gets me every time
7:05
THEM BEING TOGETHER MAKES ME SO HAPPY ISTG
Can someone tell me what that song was that they used at the end i loved the beat. Thanks
10:32 why is the way Wilbur throws him so funny
"fucketh off" Jack Shakespeare over here spitting lines
This is my favourite vlog ever big up cowes
Jack went from being a 'Captain' to Wilbur's Cabin Boy within 90 seconds...
jack's growing some hair
Aww, he said the most valuable thing he bought was Niki! That’s so cute!
https://youtu.be/yyP4sFuCXLc
Pov: Wilbur and Niki arent dating.  I'm not even shipping them, they just sus.
Niki's "hey!" at 4:21 sounds like Navi from legend of zelda
IM FROM COWES I SAW MY HOUSE :DDD
The earthy collar logistically wander because pet clinicopathologically practise about a heavenly heavy hellish ethiopia. sore, public fiber

Didn’t they already do this in Minecraft?
this is so good
WAIT GUYS HE HAS HAIR HELP
tubbo looked like kokichi ngl in his captain suit😀
Me being a Catholic 💀
Jack: if you loose you get thrown in the sea Niki: mmmmm no
I can drive a boat 🚣‍♂️
I was imagining some sort of top gear crossing the channel type thing. Massive waves and possible destruction. Nope. Mislead
Heh 2 caps for the Cap-tain
I live near ther
Such a vibe when tubbo and Wilbur jammed out
Captain Tub's!
Tubbo: Gove me a quote  Wilbur: "drink more seawater" -Wilbur Soot
I LOVE HOW WILL JUST PICKS JACK UP AND THROWS HIM IN-
Behind that smile,I know tubbo is scared for his life
I'm a simple person If I see Nikki in the thumbnail, I click the video
But if I’m sincerely honest in my humble opinion, without being sentimental, and of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my direction but rather looking into this serious matter with a perspective distinction and without condemning anyone's point of view, I honestly think and feel that I have nothing to say.
Wilbur: DRINK SOME SEAWATER TUBBO  Me: *flashback to mule bits and Wilbur telling Phil's chat to eat **_s a n d_*
I love the slow no of will throwing in Jack at the end. Will is just so chaotic and the fact the he has the strength to throw a person into the sea should be illegal.
That tubbo smile tho
Ignore this comment I just gotta do some shi later 3:49
Drop the entire clip of Wilbur and Tubbo jamming to Don't Stop Me Now you cowards
The race wouldve been better with pirates and the Caribbean songs
5:04 listen to manifold
Wilbur and Nikki are allways together maybe they are couples
10:22  Even the sailor was recording Jack
no one: me: *realizing just how FUCKING TALL wil is* Jack: *now a fish man*
E
for queens song they used a sheet music  boss video so they won’t get copyrighted. that’s pretty cool
what so ever the race is but tubbo and will had a LOTSSSS OF FUN on ride And they literally WON
“I like boys” -Tubbo 2022
ok but we have to admit one thing: Niki was fuckin brave af like all those guys and their short hair can just chill but long hair+wind is no good match massive respect for Niki for always looking FABULOUS
You know like when you pick up a domestic rabbit and they protest a bit but once you get them off the ground they just kinda accept it and let you do whatever? Wil picking up Jack kinda reminded me of that mans was just like “yeah alright this is happening I guess” lmaooo
Real Life's Funniest Pirates!
Niki was never seen again
10:18 Ahhh...Jackmanifall fall off Boat....Jackmani drown
https://youtube.com/shorts/jbTMNuGTI2g?feature=share
HAIR
6:35 i dies of laughter😂
I was hoping Niki would just push Jack in when he tried to throw her but Wilbur picking him up like a small child was way funnier.
Pin this if you almost died
I would have liked to see Wilbur thrown in the water. But I know that everyone would have died
Woww 😍
Feels like an astronaut in the ocean
Dang Queen is so good. Both the band and The Queen. RIP Freddie Mercury

When wilbur threw jack in the water jack really did say under da sea!
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
rip bald guy
I LOVE HOW THEY'RE JAMMING TO DON'T STOP ME NOW
Wilbur: "Wherefor out thou Manifold"  Jack: "Fucketh off"

“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
The Twitchsters have started to take over Youtube. Their videos are much more entertaining tbh. Youtubers need to up their game.

Jack looks like brirtish idubbz
“fucketh off” IM ROLLING BAHAHDVDBD
when wilbur made tubbo drink sea water it gave me the vibe when wilbur made tubbo sell mule buts iykyk
I love wilburs glasses
At 5:40 when Wilbur does the "slug drop" look at the boat driver/captain just look back at him with the death stare.
Is it just me or does JackManifoldTV with a hat and a red shirt look like the TeamFortress2 Scout?
'Gesundheit Its french- *Cries in French*                     I subscribed- *Who's bad now*
fav bit was 6:30
I can barely watch these videos due to second hand embarrassment
Why are you guys not uploading new videos?
NUMBER 8 ON TRENDING BTW BIG EYUP

Jackmanidrown

"Jackmani-drown"
Tubbos obsessed with being with being captain lol

“She just sweared”
"Name one thing I've lost!" Your hair?
Was Tommy in school again
Now this is speedrunning.
Portsmouth is the mouth of the river Ports
Niki cut her hair
Im a bad person
this channel is growing faster than my internet
Will was literally me when he threw Jack in. I'm the relatively strong one in my group, so pickup my friends bridal style isnt uncommon. So simply "Yeet"
this made my day
If I lived in Shakespeare time I would have used "fucketh off" so much
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
When you wish you were there
Everyone cares about Jack, so Wilbur threw him into the ocean
wilbur date nikki already
Did anyone notice wilburs Jojo pose after he threw jack into the water
Wilbur throwing Jack into the water is my favorite part. Nikki is to pretty to be thrown in especially after putting time into makeup like come on we don't want to ruin all her work!
Jack:thats the whole agreement  Niki:u can’t throw me into the ocean  Jack:just-  Ad: **st cream now use my skin is all clear from st**
Nihachu, Jack Manifold, Tubbo and Wilbur: **Having fun** Tommy: **Crying**
"you've had a good run jack" * yeets the bald man into the ocean *
Grandma wasn't thrown into the sea.. OK GOOD
Rip Jack at the end
Wilbur strong
3:01 oof
Imagine wilbur being a simp for niki
"silence speaks volume"
JACK MANI-DROWN
Absolutely beautiful
As a sailor i can confirm that drinking sea water is great for your health 😃
As someone with Thalassophobia, I literally stared crying when will threw jack in XD.
5:34 Wilbur: Drink some seawater Tubbo: * instantly inhales seawater*
When they started bouncing i just lost it
4:32 Tubbo: I like boys Me: It's okay body🤝🏻

Nobody gonna talk about jack not coming back out with the camera? He got thrown in with it and never came back up with it
Why does Will look like Thermite
DRINK THE SÁÈ WOTAH
props to the sailors.
Tubbo 😭😭😭😭
"Gesundheit"  "They're not speaking English, they're- that's French." Me in french class rn : *cries in french*
Why would you drink the water it is filled with contamination
I love how Wilbur just walked in to protect Niki from being thrown off the boat
Jack: “I don’t think the bit’s that funny, Wil I-“ Wilbur: **Proceeds to throw him into the water then claps** *”I beg to differ”*
5:04 HAAHH

Everyone being short but Wilbur the tallest oop
I know what would happen if tommy was there

Addiction. pog
JACK-MANIDROWN
The one lady waving on the cruiser at 8:18 just made my day
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)
As an allied member of the LGBTQIA+ community, I support tubbo.
THE CLOSEUP OF TUBBOS MIDDLE FINGER IS SENDING ME
JACK MANIDROWN😍😩
Tommy puching the air rn
I hope tommy and Phil is there that would be so funny and fun
Wilbur is definitely the best 6’5 British captain ever (I loved when he threw Jack out of the boat)
Nice place stay safe always
L,manburg irl?
i think this is my favourite vlog ever
they are in my hometown 😎
2:33 dang I'm a Catholic  What did I ever do wrong besides wear red shorts?

Congrats on getting top 10 on trending!!! :D
I cant believe jack didn't expect wilbur to commit to the bit.......................... you have to commit man
"DONT SLOW DOWN JUST RUN INTO THEM ITS FINE" they might have won if this had in fact happened.... just saying boat driver of jack manifold and nikki

I bet nobody is expecting what I'm saying next...    Pingas
Tubbo: I like boys the first thing that came up in my head Tommy x tubbo

PFT WILBUR CASUALLY THROWING JACK OFF THE BOAT
I love how will is twice his hight so there was nothing he could do about it
Wilbur said fly my child
Damn. Wilbur really is long
That was the first time I heard Nikki nihachu swear:>
Wilbur: Tubbo more seawater!     Tubbo: No     Also Tubbo: * Drinks seawater *
Tubbo the sailor boi
At the 3:33 minute mark is the moment I realized just how long Will’s legs are
10:13 throw the baby
Please someone tell me what kind of glasses Wilbur is wearing
If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe He was raised from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
i wish tubbo yelled were keeping  grandma today

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." -John 3:16

"Drink more sea water" - Wilbur Soot
EPIC WOW
Anybody else hear LEGO pirates of the Caribbean music?
I'm going to drink salt water now, I must go.
Don’t ever come to the Isle of Wight again, theres to much old people. They could sue you 😐
The fact that they were all literally in my town kills me inside
Excuse you, I'M the captain
This just though me that shyness brings nothing and LITTERALLY LIVE YOUR FUCKING LIFE TO THE FULLEST
Did he lose his gopro?
4:33 same tubbo, same
Wilbur throwing jack into the sea was the content I never knew I needed
AND THAT IS THE STORY OF NIKKI AND WILBUR'S NEAR FRIENDSHIP DEATH 😃
did tubbo just come out🗣
“gesundheit” “they’re speaking french”  i mean it’s german but close enough
*"Give me a good quote"*  "Drink More Seawater Tubbo."
Wilbur: "drink some more seawater!" also Wilbur: "did you see me slut drop?"
"We cant hear you I'm sorry,were talking about scooby doo!" Wilbur is such a icon 😭.
after the last line, it felt very good not to subscribe
Jack:spreads his arms out Niki:hugs him     Inside of jack Jack:I feel it coming.
Tubbo being a narrator: thats a nice bouy. I like boys- well- 😃
Yo, I just wanted to say that, we have all sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God. Jesus died on the cross for the forgiveness of sin and rose from the dead proving He had power of sin and death. As long as you repent and truly accept him as your Lord and Saviour you will be Born again (saved); go to heaven🙏❤️   Our sin is breaking Gods law e.g: the 10 commandments. Most of us have all Lied, Stolen something, Looked at a woman with lust, used Gods name in vain etc. These are only 4 of the 10 commandments and just one of them separates us from God for eternity since God is Holy and it stops us from entering his kingdom when we die. Anyways Jesus took our punishment, so that we can have eternal life as long as we trust in Jesus for our salvation and not our selves, it’s a gift from God which no man should boast about. Once someone truly trusts in Jesus, they are born again and a completely new person spiritually speaking, and anyone around them will most likely say they see a different person e.g: they do good things now instead of bad.  How to be saved - Agree with God that we are in need of His help and that we cannot save ourselves. Recognize what Jesus Christ has done in our place on the cross and accept the gift that He offers us by trusting in Him alone for salvation. Receive the ability to turn away from our sin and towards God because of His help   Hope you all have a nice day God bless you all and your families❤️; remember Jesus loves you❤️  https://youtu.be/1IhHfc61aJk https://youtu.be/XdlhJiEDqJ8
8:15 HE CALLED THE FERRY A CRUISE I-
I literally didn’t stop laughing for the whole video 😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/zbFfvGZ805M
E
Tubbo: "Look at me. I'm the captain now."
*big strong.. like water!*
i am the captain now ☺️
WHERE IS TOMMY
I imagine an adventurous trip with sharks like in horror movies
I crushed my finger in an escalator door on spinnaker tower once, small world.
Dude strong Wilbur
My mate saw you dancing on the boat and thought you were some random ppl but then when she found out that it was you guys she was sad bc she didn't meet you tbh I wash I was there like sm
why is wilbur so massive compared to jack
“Wow that’s a nice looking buoy! I like buoys”
How is Niki so cute!!!
CAN I GET A WHOOPER
Is will and niki dating
I like how the whole world stoped when nikki swore 😂
I love wilbur sm
Imagine they also brought tommy
Poor Niki almost had to be thrown in
Jack didnt even light his pipe  and he claims himself a captain
okay but the clip where they start playing “don’t stop me now” was so fucking cute
Looks like I'm a bad person
Jack: “Name one thing I’ve lost”  Niki: “Love or host”   immediate tears
nikki was so upset at the end when she thought she had to go into the water 😩😩😩😩😩
4:55 to 5:05 had me dying of laughter
This was basically tubbo and Wilbur having a good time while racing against Nikki and jack
ALL THE BOIS IN DA SEA!
DO YOU KNOW HOW DEPRESSING IT IS TO LITERALLY LIVE IN PORTSMOUTH AND HAVE MISSED NICKI 😐
https://youtu.be/K37Z2kWDwc0
Wilbur really said: Nikki in ocean? Nahhh   NOW JACK IN OCEAN? I CAN GET BEHIND THAT IDEA
hello fello manifolders 😻😻😻
THE BEST PART OF THE VIDEO IS WHEN WILBUR AND TUBBO SANG “DONT STOP ME NOW”

Check out #moosetape album by #sidhumoosewala
“fucketh off” i’m going to start saying that now/srs
What was the name of the song that Tubbo and Wilbur were listening to? ( if you know )
90% of the vid titles in this channel has Tommy 75% is "Never take Tommy"(i agree just let him be at home without women) And the last 10%is just actual titles
my new comfort video
Can someone tell me the outro song?
JackManidrown XD
U know it's serious when Niki swears
Jack looks 12 when he’s being carried by Wilbur 😭
Jack-mani-fall in the ocean
Me, a Catholic *sweats* 2:31
Wilbur throwing Jack in the water made me feel things i don't know about you guys
I did not realize Wilbur was that tall until he picked up Jack like he was a fucking teddy bear
This  Video is in the German YouTube Trends, and i think that is funny
The funny thing is I was on that same Saint Claire Ferry to the ilse of wite
Poor Tommy’s probably stuck in college 😂
Jack have you seen Moana? I just watched Moana on an inflatable projector in a lake
The fact I live in Portsmouth makes me wana cry my eyes out
random fact i just thought of: me and my friend named something after you. we can't remember what it was, but we named it after you.
Niki is savager than tubbos grandma at 3:00
The way Wilbur just picks Jack up and throws him away 😭🤚
The fact that Wilbur can carry jack is hilarious he just oozes masculine passion
greetings, british man.
NO NO NO MY ONLY CHANCE TO SEE YOU GUYS AND I MISSED IT 🙄 YOU SHOULVE TOLD US THAT YOU WERE SWINGING BY ON YOUR BIKE I WOULDNT BOUGHT THE FLAG AND SHOUTED IVER TO YOU GUYS 🤬😕
9:30 Nikky(in a perfect British accent) : I have to go into the F--king water! Wlbur and Jack:  ...  ShE SwOrE!
The difference between will and tubbos height is sad
i love this group.
This isn't the first time I've seen a Jack get yeeted off a boat.
The people who dislike 846  (Where little kids)  That did not see *tommyinit*
Phil Wilbur’s in one of those moods again😭
broooo I didnt know you were off Island I would've swam to yous
"Fucketh off"  As a literature student, i find this very ammusing
The bit where he got thrown in the sea us just, amazing I laughed so hard I started coughing
You went ast my home
7:07 WHEN NIKKI AND JACK DID THE TITANIC THING- AAWWWWWW
This is why tubbo is my favorite mcyt
THAT'S NOT FRENCH THAT'S GERMAN
Manifold Manifold  where are thou Manifold  You can add anything with an "ith" and it makes it fancy for example "f**kith off
When Wilbur was carrying jack it looked like a fatherly son moment
I would die to have mates like this
Tubbo :  “I like boys.”   We know 😩
tubbo saying he's a captain part 2
I saw niki and I was like fuc ya
wilbur and tubbo are the best duo i cant
Im chatolich
i live on the isle of wight
I just noticed the height difference between jack and everyone else 🤣
Quote of the month: Drink more sea water.                                             -Wilbur
Niki and Jack are the focused team and Tubbo and Wilbur are just chaotic... yet they won.
I imagine this trip being a horror movie
Jack: Name one thing I’ve lost  My tics: L’manburg good sir
Come o Brasil
Tubboat confirmed?

Titanic the reboot: 7:03 Starring: Jack Manifold Co-Starring: Niki Nihachu
Tubbo and Wilbur: *singing a queen song* Niki and jack :HOW HAVE THEY GOT A SPEAKER 🤯🤯
At my grandmothers funeral there was a gravestone with the surname "Manifold"... now I know why he keeps becoming a memorial account😃
The whole video is just them fighting
You do not realise how close I am that I can shout hello and they’ll hear me I’m so sad right now :(
Oh dear tommyinnits not there

You don’t drive a boat you con a boat
7:08 damn Jack.

Good but it would be way better with tommy
Wilber: Don’t touch me  Me: *flashbacks to Unus Annus*

5:00   Will: yours is the east as mine is the west Jack: *leans foreard* fucketh off!
10/10 to the boat drivers, hope they got a decent time with these mad lads of the British guys and Niki
fUcKeTh OfF-
I'm glad Niki wasn't thrown in bc she's wearing a white shirt and ppl on the internet are creepy. :(
I live in Portsmouth :')
#lraq 💜
The Isle of Wight is NOT part of France, it is an island of the coast of England and is part of the United Kingdom. Even if they were riding across the channel, that is a channel, NOT the ocean. Fucking clickbait.
I just started YouTube…
You know what makes my personality: Wilbur Soot  and Tubbo mixed
Drink more seawater -Wilbur soot 2021
No one: Absolutely no one: Wilbur:drink more seawater
Wilburs legs are so long jeez
omg when they started playing freddie mercury and then played it through the speakers and then started shouting singing it and we had the shot of the boats from above.. that. that was my favourite part.
Yoooo
“I like boys”
“I'm ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ Sᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡᶦᵏᵉˢ ᵗʰᶦˢ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ”
This video was amazing Jack Mani-fall in water!!!
There are two reasons why this is number 8 on trending 1- Nikki swore 2- Jack was thrown into the ocean
when jack and niki did the titanic thing made me wish i had more close friends 😭☝
Do I see hair on his head?
Wilbur is the main character 😂
Was Tommy grounded??
i ship jack and niki together 7:05 the hug tho
Jack mani drown?
them singing queen has my heart
i'm sorry but i lost it when wilbur picked up jack and threw him in the water
FUCKITH OFF!  -Jack Manifold, 2021   (Alsom at the end of the vid, Wilbur is legit proving to *all* the fanfic writers that he is very capable of picking someone up so all their scenes like that are TRUE)
Man got more views than subs
this is like tommy's mod videos but irl 💀
I love how Wilbur save Nikki from being thrown into the water
iconic bestfriends yall
Tommy at college be like :🧍🏻‍♂️
imagine being on a cruise, then suddenly jack, tubbo, wilbur and niki all just zooOooom past you on boats
Is everyone gonna ignore the fact that tubbo snorted sea water
BY FAR Jack's best vlog
Jaws the shark was lurking in the dark in the depths of the sea one day on a lark.
"fucketh off" - jack manifold 2021
Ahh yes, next time we see a building, think of Reddit gold👏👏👏
Jack: To be honest, THEY'RE the ones to blame Niki: "Death Stare" "Also Swears"

Jack gave up smoking how dedicated
WILBUR JUST PICKED UP JACK LIKE HE WAS HIS LITTLE BROTHER PLS FHUAISFJ

"Fucketh off" and "I like boys" those two lines had me dead
Vlog Wilbur has bde

The fact that people actualy made a subredit called Boatrace
Lol when Wilbur makes the kissy face across the boat he was acting like a 7 year old
Tubbo is like Morty and Wil is like rick
O
I love how Wilbur just picked Jack up with no problem
that video made me happier than i've been in a while wtf
I wanna see the actual sail on a sail boat alone
This was funny 4:50
TNT duo? Nahh Jack and wilbur are the new best ship (don't take thus serious)
HIS HAIR
Tubbo should've said *I am da Captain now* after taking the Hat.
jack be looking like willy wonka in them glasses
I lov them sooo much
Jack: I've never lost anything ever! Name one thing I've lost! Tubbo: Past relationships Niki: the love or host Jack: cries for his fallen pride
Not me vibe ing to the outro music
3RD ON TREDING YES JACK
I WAS GONNA GO TO PORTSMOUTH  :(
i love all of their vlogs
Did the GoPro survive tho?
jack: starts to get addicted to smoking  me: eats grenades as if they were apples
"You can't just throw me into the sea" -"I'm quit capable, I'm very strong so I reckon I probably could"
amazing vid, loved the ending! <3
Jack: did you bring a valuable item? Turbo: yeah, I brought a family heirloom. Jack: alright, the loser has to throw their item into the water. Turbo: Poor grandma 😂
My respect has gone up:)
When will picked up Jack bridle style I was like: 😳
i live here omgg, come back i want to meet u
Lol Wilbur looming over jack
everyone: "Wilbur is a good friend... he cares for his friends" Wilbur: "DrInK tHe SeA"
Jack: you can’t really blame me for this one Niki: *gives him a death glare* Jack: oh.. oh god
POLSKAAAAA
wherefore art thou manifold ❤️
yessir
Jack:WHY?!It's so cold!!! Wilbur:*agrees shaking head like a pshycho*
9:20 I see the killer instinct in her eyes
When jack was the least of the video
i live in east cowes :) could've seen them wooo
5:04 a best moment, hoorah
Imagine just being on that cruise ship and being like “is that jack manifold, Wilbur? Niki, Tubbo?!
Wilbur definitely did not say “slug drop”
Wilbur looked so amused after throwing Jack in lol
@Wheatskins UR EDITING IS AMAZING
I’m a bad person

Thank god for will being the only entertaining person in that video.. :d
3:13 THE LEG IS KILLING ME 💀
Ok Wilbur is TOO tall
We need to have a video where all the boys (Tommy, Tubbo, Wilbur, and Jack) go tubing 😂
5:03
“Drink more seawater” -Wilbur Soot 2021
What is the Freddie mercury song called??
Tubbo and Wilbur's captain: *does 360* Nikki and Jack: "THEY GAVE UP WE ARE GOING TO WIN!!!"   not even a few mins later: "WEEEEEEEE ARE THE CHAMPIONSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS MY FRIEND~~~~~~~"-tubbo
“F*ckth off”  ah yes one of Shakespeare’s many famous quotes
I don't know why nobody is talking about tall mf Wilbur holding small mf Jack, but I'm deffo drawing it. And then drawing the moment Jack dies in the water.
Nikki:moo Will:Gesundheit Me german: ya... Why Not yes
No one: Me: silently clapping when Jack got thrown in the water cuz my mom was in the room
*If you don't subscribe you're a bad person* The recommended video: *I forced Tommy to play a horror game..*
Tubbo :I like boys!.my friend that’s a boy : me to!
jack and niki's friendship is probably my favorite duo. it's so wholesome and just fun. :)
ok
What do you think the drivers thought when they look back to a grown man screaming at a child to drink more sea water?
IM VERY SAD IF I JUST WALKED LIKE FOR 2 MINUTES I WOULD OF MET U ALL OMG 😭😭😭
That is the most British boat ive ever seen and I love it
“We call that a dorito.” *spits out water*
jacks growing his hair!!
I am literally terrified because of how strong Wilbur is
Jackmani-drown :3
Wilbur throwing jack overboard was basically "How To Flex On a Girl: An Essay by Wilbur Soot"
THEY LITERALLY JUST THREW JAVK IN LOL
3:20 his legs are so long so omfg
The deleted “don’t stop me now” clip was beautiful and tubbo jamming
Lol my cousin is 11 years old and she can drive a motor boat and she’s qualified xd
Tubboat
Oh come on you deserved it
This video was really entertaining but idk why
Gesundheit! "They are not speaking English... Thats french!" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🇩🇪
it's so terrifying that Wilbur picked Jack up so easily
I LITERALLY LIVE LIKE 5-10 MINUTES AWAY FROM WHERE YOU WERE AT THE START OF THE VIDEO
ya know what scares me the most? wilbur is capable of EASILY picking up jack- jack is 5’9- i’m 5’3... I CANNOT EXPRESS TO YOU HOW SCARED I AM OF THIS MAN NOW PAHAVAH
mans got hair!!!
Rip GoPro
OMG CUTE „Gesundheit“
Jack back with another banger vlog :)
Haha at the end I thought Wilbur was gunna pick up Niki and throw her.
5:40  Around 90% of whale sperm is lost in the sea during reproduction, which means there is a high chance when you drink sea water… well… you know where this is going…
Wilbur just said:How about we respect the ladies and throw Jack
Can we talk about that I can see the Isle of Weight from my house
JACKMANIDROWN?????
It's a bad month
Good Video
JackManiDROWN
Where is tommy?
I’m going to the isle of white in October pog !
Not tubbo drinking the dead
Jack: name one thing that I’ve ever lost   Me: hair…
This was genuinely one of my favorite videos with any of them in it
what is that outro song
Wilbur really just picked Jack up and threw him in the ocean… oh my god.
imagine if tommy , gogy and ranboo  just showed up out of nowhere swimming towards the boats
Wightlink is a boat not a cruise 😒
Jack *M A N Y F O L D S*
Why simulator is this? The graphics look so good
Imagine how much more poggers it would have been if Niki and Wilbur were on a team 😢
Hello, We have Gym training videos, Arm-wrestling training. How to lose weight & build muscle at home without equipment. Plus Nutrition tips for muscle building. Detailed but Short (2,3 minutes, no time wasting) We'd appreciate, if you checked us out
u say u took up smoking but i took up professional boating
Captain manifold *amazing*
Jack can’t mess with Niki when Will is there
nikis death stare LMAO
the boy boat
"hey alexa play pirates of the carribean music"  *plays epic pirates of the english channel music*
Why is Wilbur so lanky
I live on the island
I love how wilbur belittled Jack and just carried him
Tubbo, you're on water too much. The pond video, the waterpark video, and this- he ain't bee boy now he's Waterbee dude now
I like how I literally just got off a boat and came on to find this video
i am catholic and i am now an atheist.
Wilbur is gonna make a new nation on sea?-
7:07
just imagine how chaotic it would be with Tommy there, I think he might fall off the boat because he can’t stay still- this video honestly makes me so happy and it looks like so much fun 😄 especially the end where Wilbur picks up jack and throws him in the water 😂
"I raced across the ocean" Me: How did you surivive
Niki and jack doing the titanic move : :D  Me : now all we need is an ice mountain :)
10:09 hahshahsh i love this wilbur looks so intimidating lol
https://youtu.be/JJZ5iFUN1I4

JACKMANIDROWN HAS COME TRUE
HANG ON A MINUTE. HE'S GOT FUCKIN HAIR BOIIIISSSS
Boat race: exist *sharks joinedthe game
I raced across the ocean = i am a rac*=× on the ocean
УИЛБУР ГЕЙ (простите)
The highlight for me was probably when Nikki swore, jack got thrown into the sea and wilburs smile when he saved nikki from being thrown and after he threw jack!
Willbur is literally Niki's guard
The fact that Wilbur just casually picked up jack terrifies me…
DUDE I LITERALLY LIVE RIGHT NEXT TO THAT
It was so sus the way Wilbur held Jack
Jack did u bring ur TV on a boat race that's make u Jack manifoldtv
Imagine you’re on a cruise and you see Jack, Wilbur, Tubbo, and Nikki speeding by on boats
Tubbo and Wil are straight up just jamming out.
Jack: “I can’t drive”  Tubbo: *I AM DA CAPTAIN NOW*
We have 2 sets of eyes – our natural eyes we use to see the world and our spiritual eyes we use to see the ways of God. Our access to the kingdom is through our spiritual eyes of faith, prayer, learning God’s word and relationship with our Father.   To receive from the kingdom requires you to see through your spiritual eyes and not your natural eyes. Take time to exercise your spiritual eyes. Let God teach you the dance of closing your natural eyes to let your spiritual eyes dictate your walk, ways, and response. The things your spiritual eyes can perceive can lead to creative ideas, a vital   solution, guidance, peace, healing, better understanding... and so much more in our realities.    Practice closing your eyes to doubt and your understanding. Open your spiritual eyes of faith and allow yourself to rest in the ways, and leading of God. With each time your ability to walk with God gets stronger and clearer.
This comment section is a lot like the ocean. Filled with trash/spam.

Wilbur with Tommy: hugs and big brother vibes  Wilbur with Jack: don't touch me you filthy creature
jack: youre going to have to throw what you brought to the sea tubbo: "ive brought an urn" jack: "ive brought niki" 💀
these guys are going everywhere, from London to Matlock to Portsmouth!
niki is legitimately breathtaking
I bet those people on the cruise never knew that tubbo_ Wilbur soot jack manifold and nihachu passed them on that very day
Tubbos team: The weals on the boat go round and round, round and round. Tubbo: wait wa-... SCOOBY DOBY DO WHERE ARE YOU, WERE COMING OUT TO FIND YOU!!! Jacks team: I am The captain and we will win the race
YES YES YES
I AM DE CAPTAIN NOW
:)))
Jack missed a big opportunity to play he's a pirate when they were racing. Or did he. I don't know. If he did then please let me know
Hi you are so funny
this is actually wholesome
Their height different between wilbur and tubbo though..So cute💓
They were near me lmao i live on the chalk hills
yamaha is the brand of my saxophone, apparently they make boats to
wait did jack loose the go pro in the water?
when your son cant drown him the dad will do it
I live in Portsmouth I've been to the top of the castle in "Castle mouth"
Will is the best/worst adult friend we all love. Can't belive he just picked up Jack like a bride and yeeted him into the ocean.
Just imagine they vlog on Wednesday only just to prevent Content Tommyinnit to join their vlog because we all know why
9:19 sheesus the stare from Niki is so powerful
Actually the Isle of Wight is British but ok jack
Notice how even the captains that drove were also filming when Jack was thrown into the sea
JackManiDrown

i rewatched this and i realized wilbur got a new phone uaye
LMAO xD
who else was jamming out to queen😂
I got mule bits vibes from Wilbur telling Tubbo to drink the sea water
THE WAY WILBUR JUST PICKED HIM UP-
tubbo saying “i like buoys” is the highlight of this video. we’re proud of you tubbo
Jack: "I'm going to walk up to starboard" Also Jack: *Walks to the bow on the port side*
Jack can you play lunch lady with tommy again and maybe with tubbo and gam
Is this the first time wil and niki met? (I just realized its not)
I can’t get over how BLUE that water is down where I live our water is brown ;-; but it’s still great for fishin
its ocean jack
Now I know why tommy make a pirate video...
The fact that Wilbur was basically ignored by the person driving and just said 'Silence speaks volumes' every time is just so good
Every video Niki is slowly becoming more and more British lol
Tubbo saying hes the captain makes me think of Tommy's last vid XD
jack: "we are winning, EASY"  wilbur and tubbo's captain: no lol
*Gets saltwater in his mouth* "That's a sign of pollution, it tastes of salt"   Wilbur showing us why he has 10,000 IQ
tubbo just smiling in the thumbnail just look like a teethless gramdma
tommy watching this “🥲”
"i've brought an urn, sorry grandma"  "i- i've brought niki" well..
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW JACKS HAIR IS GETTING LONGER
Jack and Niki: *epic boat racing music* Tubbo and Wilbur: DRINK SEA WATER.

America vaccine doesn't work?   America vaccine make 62 people dead in Taiwan!  the problem is America vaccine doesn't work how to stop corona virus?
When Niki swore everyone was like WHAT SHE SWORE
hihihihi, they are so funny. the boy is handsome and the girl is beutifullll 😍😘😍
Tubbo: Look! It’s Saint Claire!  Me named Claire: confused stonks
For future me the time stamp is 6:23 where Wilbur and tubbo are singing  And 7:11 is where Wilbur and tubbo speed up and the true race begins   (Also if anyone is willing to animate these I would love that)
Tommynotinnit
It’s my birthday

https://youtu.be/CQdjBAPQ9B0
https://youtu.be/U9YKqlhIej0
OwO great vid
I’m surprised no one made a “tides in the ocean” joke!
Jack: i am captain Tubbo: no i am Willbur: get side kids
5:43  Will: "I'm having a lot of fun." :D Tubbo: "I can tell." :) I can't. It's literally too wholesome.
The fact their boat driver KNEW he was fast enough to win so he did a spin just to prove it- bold man, I like it
Why is no one talking about Jack’s “fucketh off” like I’m orbiting rn
Is that WILBUR SOOT???
Tubbo is the CAPtain 0:25
I think jack have a crush on niki :D
10:11  I can see a new smp ship
The way Jack got thrown in the water really got me laughing!
Expectation Captain-Jack The Pirates assistant-tubbo,nihachu,wilbur  Reality Captain-everybody Assistant-non

Im so confuse on why niki keeps changing his hair color
"i even took up smoking"
tommyinnit sure is crying now that he couldn't be with you
Jacks hair is growing fast
Good work on the camera angles in this vlog, the multiple angles were cut pretty well and the addition of the drone shots was super cool!
I love how they all went from playing on a block game to meeting up regularly
Wiki, Wilbur niki
I love these vlogs way too much
4:30  Tubbo : wow that’s a cool looking boy, I like boys.

I love how this video just hijacked the boat race subreddit
NOT THE SOCKS- THE WET SOCKS AT THE END NOOOOOOOOO
No one talks enough about the production value of this video, I just sat there going "this is so damn cool" for 10 mins straight
Jack is so short compared to Wilbur LMFAO
oop
Me (A Catholic) :(  2:35
the ‘fucketh off’ GOT ME
sea water is salty
The real punishment was having wet socks.
Mhhhmmmm potassium
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
"if you don't subscribe. ur bad person“  Me: *Subscribe*
wtf is this? 😒
“All the wrongdoers, all the Catholics” Me as a catholic: 0.0 ..okay moving on..

Tubbo I love your content but please from one person to another please put on sunscreen. You only have to put it on once every two to four hours if it’s really good. It can also prevent things like skin cancer happening in the future. If you don’t like the pastiness of regular sunscreen you can always use the spray on stay safe :)

One of my favourite quotes  Jack Manifold: "just ram into it, it's fine, i'll pay insurance"

We need a blog with tommy
Wilburs best advice, just eat the beach.
Two boat teams, both alike in dignity, In fair somewhereinBritain, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil motor oil makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal hats of these two foes A pair of star-cross'd racers take their life; Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their race bury their drivers' strife. The fearful passage of their joy-mark'd ride, And the continuance of their drivers' rage, Which, but their friend's end, nought could remove, Is now the ten minutes of our video; The which if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
"I have to go in the fucking water!" -Niki Nihachu 2021
Who else got a takis ad with Ninja in it?
Wilbur being on "team Reddit" is just Soothouse 2
wilbur making tubbo drink sea water reminds me of that scene from harry potter and the half blood prince where harry and dumbledore have to do that drinking stuff
A boy asked a girl in a library: "Do you mind if I sit next to you"? The girl replied with a loud angry voice; "I don't want to spend the night with you !! Everyone in the library started looking at the boy and felt embarrassed. After a few minutes the girl walked calmly to the boy's table and said: I study psychology and I know what the man is thinking, I suppose you felt ashamed, right? The boy answered out loud: $ 300 for one night That's too much! and all the people in the library looked at the girl in shock and the boy whispered in her ear, "I study laws and I know how to make someone guilty ... 🤭    If you like the comment, please "write" on my channel ...  I know I misspelled spelling and grammar 🤗 But YouTube doesn't allow promotion ... It only takes 5 seconds, thanks ❤️🙏🏻 [If you don't want to sub ***** e, that's fine, but don't spread the hate 🤗❤️ ’]
4:55 - 5:06 still a better love story than Twilight tbh.

Wait, did manifold really travel from England to France just to be thrown in the ocean
Tubbo looks like a Boy Scout
Genuinely speaking, I am slightly scared of Wilbur as he is a giant of a man, standing at 6'5, and him picking up and throwing Jack Manifold overboard that easily did not help me reduce that fear.

thank you for the vlog jack manifold
I think these vlogs are better than actual minecraft video's ngl
Please pray for my mom who's in the ICU on a ventilator fighting for her life against this virus for 5 weeks now and not looking good with multiple infections. Her name is Doris. I don't have much family and we're very close. If you can take a second to pray for her please.
That whole turnaround bit reminded me of the good ol' days of SMP Earth, when Phil lapped Technoplane multiple times for the flex
I’m honestly glad vlog meta is coming back but like good vlogs
Tubbo: so what other mysteries do you have for us today? Wilbur: what is this? Fucking scooby do?!
Just like the titanic jack was released into the sea
Why am i watching a kid drinking seawater?
Jack: “Name one thing I’ve lost”  Niki: “Love or host”   *immediate tears*

for all the people speculating if Wilbur would be good at tossing people, now we know
5:00 really made me laugh hahaha
rad or not
Oh no
Being terrified of Wilbur because of two reasons. Man is very tall and he can pick someone up like that and throw them into the water.  I am very short despite being in high school, like me and him have a whole foot different as my height was stolen from Ranboo,(just like he stole my gender too) and I can't swim at all.

First the mule bits and now sea water when will wilburs reign of terror over tubbo end?
Tubbo asking his parents to do this "mum dad can I go on a boat race with my adult friends across the UK France channel?"
3:51 Wilbur looks so epic🤣
John 3:16-18  Jesus loves you, and died for our sins.  Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Repent before it is too late. Please i plead with you for the sake of God THERE IS NO PROMISE OF TOMORROW, REPENT REPENT REPENT.  .

Niki: fuck The boys: *uh oh*
JACK MANIHAIR POG
9:15 Niki’s death stare is horrifying
This entire video is basically the definition of  "Look at me, I'm the captain now"
"Literalmente el 99% Porciento de personas No me apoyarán pero tengo Fé de que algún día podré ser reconocido"........

Will: "Yours is the east and mine is the west" Jack: "Fucketh off!" Me: dies  Edit: WTF 650 LIKES- THANK YOU Edit 2: ok why does it keep going up- Thank you still!

I thought Wilbur was gonna pick Jack up from under the arms and yeet him while he was talking to Niki.😂
When he said today I am a captain he sounded so much like gogy
jack is an extremely tiny person
THIS SEEMS SO COOL
As soon as Wilbur enters frame at the end he just dwarfs the Manifold and makes him look like a child
very good content
i think the bit’s funny for that jack
I really love the vlogs

Captain Puffy: Why am I not invited
oh to be held and thrown by Wilbur soot.   that’s not even like a simping thing or anything, I just feel like it’d be fun
10:18 yeeeet
Why are only White countries expected to be multiracial and multicultural? Why are only White people expected to become minorities in the countries that their ancestors founded? Why is "diversity" only being promoted in White countries? The promoters of diversity and multiculturalism claim that they are anti-racist, but what they actually are is anti-White. Diversity is a codeword for White genocide. Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.

I love this
I think tubbo is secretly a wizard, he just makes random things appear out of nowhere
who else thinks that wilbur and niki should have been on the same team :)
Wilbur threw Jack into the water instead of Niki. Such a gentleman.

If Nikki, Wilbur, Tubbo, and Jack are on the boat? What happen to tommy?
"Reddit Gold" the fact that Wilbur's real last name is Gold scares me
wilbur and tubbo jamming to freddie murcury is hilarious

Drink more sea water                         -Wilbur Soot
I'm 99% sure the people driving the boats were like "what the fuck???" The entire time.
epic
I forgot how scary Niki can be ((O.o)) lmao
His hairbis growing in nicely
Tubbo with his red cheekssss
“Fucketh off” had me dying loooooooool
#1 on Trending. Leggo
That moment when they does lets do Minecraft irl
The fact jack went in with socks on triggers me
Jack told tubbo if he lost, he had to throw a valuable into the sea. But when jack lost, he tried to throw nikki into the sea, does that mean nikki is valuable to jack?

The thing that got me was when Wilbur picked up Jack, it was adorable, tho I do not ship it was still cute :3
Damn, Wilbur just casually lifting up Jack Manifold. Either Wilbur is that strong or Jack is that light. Or both.

Took him less than half a day to get #1 Trending.

Niki's look of disappointment, I wish to never see that again, it actually scared me

Tubbo: I like boys

niki was not about to take any of their shit lmaoo
“Fucketh Off”   -Jack Manifold 2021
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen

Jack,the sea ia super good
And Niki was left on the boat dry while Jack was wet as the ocean itself
DUDUDUDU

This is the equivalent of a Tommyinnit Minecraft mod video in real life but without Tommy
Not the Freddie Mercury comment 💀
Yes
Budget Pirates of The Caribbean   Worth every penny
Freaking funny XD
this is the most epic vlog i have ever seen
LOL
Tubbo:asking if Catholics are dead. Me (im Catholic): i-
i think wilburs glasses were the best part
Does anyone know what the outro remix is? It SLAPS
Who else realized Jack came out of the water with no camera after he got thrown in WITH one? 🧐
Wheres tommy, why isnt he with them?
Tubbo : I like boys  *TommyInnit joined the game*

Watching this making me miss the sea
britain is so depressing, even the oceans are depressing.
NO WAY IS HE ACTUALLY IN PORTSMOUTH, IM FROM PORTSMOUTH. IVE BEEN TO ALTON TOWERS AND THE WATER PARK THEY WENT TO W TOMMY. HONESTLY WHT IS THIS COINCIDENCE. sorry i’m just excited cuz i don’t acc live in england just when i visit it’s crazy to think i’ve been to or are from where they are

Hello my fellow jack manifold enjoyers
Jack: I dont think this is- Wilbur: Hehe * YEEET *
Tubbo: I like boys  Me: wait-😳 Nikki: swears  Me: That was unexpected 😀 Jack: *Is picked up like a baby and thrown in the sea* Me: I just KNOW that mans is cold asf😷 Can we get some F’s for jack😔
I like how Wilbur go like "YES THATS MY WORK" when he nod his head at 10:26
Why does it look like jack is light as a feather ... wilbur just casually picked him up and thre him in
WE NEED U GUYS AND GEORGE TO GO TO A CONCERT
Now THATS content that makes me have a laugh :)
Don’t touch me
Wilbur's so strong though what the heck. He gave a piggyback ride to George up a hill and then princess carried a full-grown man. This cannot be normal, especially for someone who plays video games for a living.
Tubbo: Just ram that boat i will pay for the insurance The Boat Owner: Bold of you to assume I have insurance
the shameful manifold was thrown into the sea. long live the king
Yes jack u growing ur hair
jack: ez tubbo and wilburs captain: I have been using 1% of my power all this time
the moment i see wilbur and niki and the same video, I know its gonna be very wholesome andvery funny. perfect combo. no, im not shipping them together.
https://youtu.be/-RAglyw6ySk
wilbur was wilding in this video and i love him for it
it would be better if a shark pass by the boat
You do realize that Freddie Mercury made sure that his songs are free for anyone to use right, beyond copyright? PS, Don tell anyone that this is an epic prank

FUN FACT  Did you know a whales ejaculation can blow a humans head clean off?  Another fun whale fact, did you know, that a whale ejaculates over 400 gallons of semen, and only a small 10% get into their mate, so over 360 gallons of whale semen is dropped into the sea.   Hmm, wonder why the sea's salty...  Poor tubbo

7:06 ahem excuse me? I know we’re on a ship and everything but that doesn’t mean you have to make yourself get shipped ;-;
Crazy that I live right near there
That was awsome. How did you loose!? Tubbo and will did a doughnut!
"name one thing I've lost-" "past relationships" " *The love or host* "  DAMN-
That’s got to be the best pirate I’ve ever seen So it would seem 7:50
7:06 I love how it should be the other way round because the line is “dont let go of me, Jack!”
Cool
I drank sea water before,    I kinda liked it?
CONFIRMED TUBBO IS GAY HE LIKE BOY
Confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart Jesus died on the cross for your sins, was buried, and was raised from the dead on the 3rd day.  Please get saved before it is too late. God bless you all in Jesus name.❤

Tubbo would be the best fucking captain
Niki is very pretty and funny :)
Captain Wilbur saved stowaway Niki

“I like boys! oop-“                 -Tubbo_ 2021
Niki hugging jack just like in the titanic movie but rose is the one hugging jack which is the opposite lmao 😂
I'm not subbing cause A. I don't support smoking and B. I'm already subscribed
When he said “Today I am a captain” I said “ okay Popeye over here”
4:12  tubbo: “what other mysteries do you have for us today?” Wilbur: “MYSTERIES?! WHAT IS THIS FUCKIN SKOOBY DOO?!?”
The fact that Wilbur can pick up Jack that easily and hold him like a baby is terrifying to me-
niki was jumping out of happiness HAHAHA
Where is *Gakmaster*
watching this during the most important exam <3
Manifold #1 trending
Yo can I join your friend group

Jack is the best captain ☆~☆
Jesus there was a lot of queen and I like it in this vid
OH MY GODDD XDD WILBUR THREW JACK INTO THE SEA WHAT ABOUT THAT SHARKS ABOUT TO GET HIM😂😂
yo, I've been there! Edit: Portsmouth, I've been to Portsmouth
“Wherefore art thou, Manifold?!”
Daaaaaamn, everyone looks so good in the thumbnail
Wilbur being very aggressive towards manifold then very quickly became his self in Tommy's mod vids by calling a bird a dorito "in the trades"
tubbo: i like boys   me confused: did he just come out??
Damn...now I see clearly of how long Wilbur's leg is 3:19
9:18 I felt that glare though my screen
That was funny as fuck when they started playing Don't stop me now by Queen
DA HAIR'S GROWIN'
i love how the atmosphere changed when niki swore lmao
1 on trending he’s on the algorithm grind!
the fact wilbur so easily picked up jack i-
did you see the hight diffrence from will and jack????
As a civilian of portsmouth i can confirm wills story is 100% accurate, Mr.Smouth is the cult leader here.
Fucketh off -Jack "The Grind never stops" Manifold, 2021
"That's a cool looking buoy! I like boys! :D WAIT WAIT-"
This is my new favorite video ✨
Tubbo and wilburs boat go speeeeeed
captain manifold
Where is tommy
Niki literally just said "moo" and I'm going HEART EYES
The thumbnail looks like niki and wil took their 2 son in vacation😂
Why did Wilbur throw jack in the water like he owns the place LMFAO-
That Captain's outfit looks so big on Tubbo !!!
Petition for Jack to release the full clip of them singing:
tubbo is just suffering
"fucketh off" just about made me choke
He wasn't joking when he said no more of Tommy
As someone who literally works at a harbor, this video makes me very happy :)
I died at *"FUCKETH OFF!"* LMAO
People on the big boat: WOW I did not know we get to see Some Dream SMP members on boats! The members: they probably want to ram us
I love how the drivers are vibin too
Sorry guys, I still can't get over on how Wilbur just princess carry Jack... 🤣😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RicZAIyf7I
Watching Wilbur just pick up jack and throw him into the sea is absolutely hilarious
Mooo
Jack: Name one thing I’ve lost. Me: All your stuff in Tommy’s new video cause you got blown up by tnt. Your wives. Your love life. Your sense of humor. Your brain cells. All your friends.
How I came here?
Will: are we going to Cowes? Niki: moo Will: gesundheit
JACK MANIDROWNED
Wilbur being swag the whole video makes it more better
Only tubbo would bring his grandmas urn on a boat 😂😂😂 that’s why I love the dream Smp
Popeye 2.0
https://youtu.be/w6csBBw0MLQ
they didn’t desalinate the salt water, they desalavated the salt water
I literally lost my mind laughing when the boat started jumping 7:20
NO PLS HE JUST YOTE HIM???
so many fanarts to be expected....will being captain is ✨wholesome✨
Yes! That was awesome!!! We need more vlogs like this! 😂🤩
Honestly I would just jump In the water for fun
You Know Nikki's serious when she swears

2:30 how does the boat flies???
WILBURS WEARING THE GLASSES
my favorite part is 10:18
yayyy i missed the notification but im here!!
Bruh I was supposed to watch an Ear infection video bc my ear has an infection I guess this is more important than my ear JackManifold all the way no matter if I lose hearing on one side of the ear lol
4:43 god rest his soul o7
Omg I think it's dream😌
HAHAAH WILBUR DEFENDING NIKI AND THROWING JACK IN INSTEAD     WHY IS WILBUR SO STRONG THAT IS TERRIFYING
Lol tell me I’m not the only one who’s really tempted to draw Wilbur and Jack at 9:55.
BOAT pog :>

7:03 that guy face
He is the captain now
"Wherefore art thou Manifold?" -Wilbur Soot 2021
I find this very ironic to me seeing as I was also on a boat today but instead of having fun and racing I got sunburned
Not me supreme he sucks
*fuketh off*  will definitely be my new bio
AM I THE ONLY PERSON WHO WAS TAUGHT HOW TO DRIVE A BOAT ILLEGALLY AT THE AGE OF 10???
I just realized that all of these vlogs are becoming an MCYT remaster of The Backyardigans... they just do something different and fun every episode
no thank you for the smell of a 2 stroke
Mans just yeeted him into the ocean
Captain Jack and the crew of Tubbo,Wilbur, and the lovely Niki (edit : I wasnt expecting tubbo in a full captain's suit and them slowly all becoming captains 😂)
“Drink More Seawater”-A Great Influenced
Seeing Wilbur and Niki in the same room makes me anxious. I don’t ship them, it’s just that I’m bi, and I have trouble deciding who I like more on a daily basis. So seeing them both irl is like a bi panic attack for me XwX
when tommy seeing this video and realized that he was not invited 🙃
It's funny how I dreamt of Nikki and Jack and they're teammates in this video
Jack Manifold Television
Jack: "I am a strong man" Wilbur just casually picking him up
Silence speaks volume
idk why i laughed so hard when wilbur picked up jack bridal style
Jack: That’s French.  I guess I’m not French anymore
Wilbur is just like nah we ain’t throwing Niki in the ocean so he just yeets Jack
Silence speaks volume
Can confirm as a resident of Portsmouth that the mr smouth story is 100% accurate
"Drink more seawater." -Wilbur Soot 2021
Jack: We are throwing Niki in.  Wilbur: *N o*
“I would appreciate some communication” “What is it with women and valuing that?”  💀
10:13 TIME TO DRAW
4:33 People who do fanart: AAAAAAAAA
Jack where did the little hand held camera go, it's not in your hand when you got back on the boat, did you lose it in the ocean?
Tommy:minecraft version Jack:Irl version
"Drink more seawater" - Wilbur 2021
“Fucketh off” 😂
3:23 HOLY CRAP LOOK HOW LONG WILBURS LEGS ARE!!!
Would anybody mind telling me what that outro's title is?
manifold and soot, greatest romance of the 21st century
i read the title and thought it was the entire atlantic
“Drink more seawater”- William Gold 2021
Jack is on his captain puffy arc
Great timestamps for me: 1:40 2:08 4:29 4:50 6:16 6:39 7:06 9:17 10:05 holy fuck he's tall
omg i cant not belive my eyes
Jack: I can't drive a boat...  Tubbo: I am the captain now!
The boat driver :  what's wrong with this people-
This is a good video to eat cereal to
LMAOO  Niki: i have to go into the fucking water!  Wilbur: she just said a swore 😯😯
Lol
WILBY<33
WILBY<44
10:17 Wilbur really just said yeet-
6:43 the best 2 seconds of footage of this video.
captain whoppa
6:38 Who else got movie vibes from this?
Poor Tommy he didn't get to go
Tubbo: "wow that's a cool looking buoy^^ i like boys"
"tommy punching the air*
The way Wilbur just hoists Jack up and effortlessly tosses him into the ocean like a whole 4 feet away from the boat really gets me. I love Wilbur picking people up.
Jack - "Did you bring that valuable item i told you to bring?"  Tubbo - "yeah, what did you bring"  Jack - "Niki"  Niki in the back - 😐
jack got thrown in the ocean with his socks on that's probably the worst part
Jack and Nikis friendship is so wholesome….Until she gave him the look. Then I feared for his life
When Tommy Is In jacks video: 1M subscribers
HE HAD HIS SOCKS ON WHEN HE GOT THROWN IN 😭NOOO
Ngl jack- you look kinda cute🥺
"fucketh off" 💀
The fact that they were ten minutes away from me makes me want to cry
This is definitely my favorite vlog so far
I like boys -tubbo 2021
yoooo the freddy murcury bit was getting so good, fuck copyright i wanted more of that.
mmmmm seawater...
Wilbur making Tubbo drink sea water equivalent to Wilbur talking about eating sand
mule
I love how Wilbur just causally just throwed Jack in the water 👁👁
I love how everyone slowly lost their minds in the sea
its so dramatic
Where is Gogy??🥺
My volume on the lowest volume cause my niece is sleeping😃 haven't finished watching but i know it's gonna be good
its just occured to me that jack had socks on when he was thrown in. not shoes.  *just* socks.
when wilbur started playing queen i about died
Well he also lost sooo it’s fair that makes three loses mention in this video 🤣🤣🤣
*silence speaks volumes*
The part where Wilbur just carries Jack is so funny
pog
tubbo and wilburs captain understood the assignment
the editing in this makes me so happy thank you wheatskins!
At my family members b day party and havin a shite time but that Jack manifold grind just won’t stop 🦾😎
niki and jack have the most amazing friendship
lets acknowledge how amazing they are for putting queen on full blast in the middle of the sea
Great video jack !
4:30 happy pride month
YOO
I was today years old when i realised how damn long Will's legs are.     Im scared now.
Wilbur: "gesundheit" Jack: *they're not speaking english..thats french*
Land ho!
The end was my favourite cuz Jack was thrown bridal style by Wilbur into the ocean hahahahahahah
I’m a simple man, I see niachu and Wilbur on the thumbnail, I click on the video
tubbo is snorting seawater like my cousin snorting the white powder he found in an alleyway.
‘Silence Is Volume.’ Good Quote 🤧✨
This is officially my favorite Jack Manifold vlog.
looking to see more vlogs!!!
This is probably my favourite vlog ever
jack i have an important question..                                        did you get a whoppa
I’m going boating soon! If anyone throws me into the lake, I’ll probably drown though lol
HELP WHY WAS TUBBO JUMPING LIKE THAT—
I was wheezing like dream during this especially when willbur through Jack into the ocean XD
“Name one thing I’ve lost” “Love or host” Dang, Niki, he said that with confidence. Way to encourage a friend
7:04 The drivers face looks so disappointed 💀
Am I the only one who thinks the guy driving the boat of jack look likes smallishbeans
Funniest video yet keep up the good work big man
For some reason I read the title as "I rained tacos on the ocean"
4:50 when wilbur blew a kiss i DIED
Tubbo: I’m the captain **flashbacks to that one Tommyinnit pirate video—**
Wilbur seems very proud of himself after he threw Jack into the water!😂
He made the tommyinnit video they sail
i feel like in every vlog the people doing their jobs hate it there 😭
3:00 I SEE A DREAMER AND HE'S RIPE FOR THE SLAUGHTER-
9:30 NIKI SAID BAD WORD 😨😱😨😱😰😱😰😱😫😩
If Tommy was there, he would of throwed Tubbo in the ocean 🤔
Wait, so if it really is Romeo and Juliet, wouldn’t it be Tubbo and Nikki, since the leaders seem to be Wilbur and Jack, so they’d be the best friend and the cousin, and Tubbo is Juliet, and Nikki is Romeo
Boat
“Name one thing I’ve lost” “Love or host”  And that is why the ocean is saltwater, from the salty tears Jack cried from that cold burn
Poor Tommy, his 2 bestfriends on a boat and he’s just at collage lnao
Imagine if Tommy is with them.
Where is the GoPro?
Wilbur being protective of Niki while also making an excuse to throw the Manifold into the ocean is the best thing I’ve seen all month
Tubbo: I like boys Me:Thats kinda gay tho-
5:42 6:42 wilbur's inner stripper
7:05 Are we just going to ignore the fact Niki hugged Jack 😂
L
4:33 just shows how awesome tubbo is lol
Poor Tommy
Ayyeee, Jack has hair
My uncle works for Mercury the mother brand
Tubbo: "I like boys"  Tommyinit:
Im having the feeling that they hate Tommy      Or maybe he's on *HELL* Collage   Ayo jack sounds like george
wilbur saved nikki and i am crying harder then jack
I feel like the most uncomfortable part of getting thrown in would be the socks
I been to the place they were
wilbur just saying silence speaks volume LMAOOOO
Tubbo brought his Grandma and    Jack brought Niki Both great sacrifices
Whats with nikki and jack with Wilbur
If my mom could stop smoking..
One word: Astronaut
AHHHH YESSS
I'M SO HAPPY MY COMFORT STREAMERS KNOW FREDDIE MERCURY!!!!
if we thought wilbur was gonna let jack throw niki into the ocean then i dont think we really know wilbur lmao
imagine someone on the cruise recognized them

This is literally my favorite video of all time
Tubbo : "I love boys !" Fanfictions : *Indeed....interesting.*
"Name one thing I've lost!" "The love or host!" no, no Niki's got a point
Petition for Jack to put a link to the “don’t stop me now” footage because I really want to see the whole thing
Niki was jumping up and down when he got thrown in she looks so happy
WILBUR PICKED HIM UP OH GOD THAT PICS GOJNA BE EVERYWHERE
Cue the Pirates of the Caribbean music
_moo_
thats a cool buoy i like boys  LMFAO good way of coming out /j
Theyre so cute together i just cant
Drink sea water  - Wilbur Soot
Wilbur really saved Niki right there.

Nikki's look at jack near the end spoke volumes
Wilbur and Jack did looked like a captain tho

At 7:24 my brain was like LUCKY THAT IS THE FUN PART WHEN YOU RIDING A SPEED BOAT(that what the boat is call)
this is great 😌
niki my beloved
Tubbo does have captain experience I know this because he was a pirate in a past life(the Minecraft pirates video with tommyinnit)
How long will you guys be there :0
Wheres gogy?
i like how wilbur just picked up jack like he was a baby
Someone please draw Wilbur carrying Jack PLEASE!😩
They won because tubbo drank the sea water
the height difference between jack and wilbur is just wow
JACKS HAIR <333
I got a mule bits vibe from this
lmao
10:11 giant man hurls you into the sea killing you instantly :)
Why does wilbur looks like a handsome dumped man?
5:09 this whole bit reminds me of the mule bits LOL
Is Tommy mad that he’s not with you guys
Popie 💛
Favorites bits gotta be wilbur with hand on hip waving goodbye to Jack and niki as him and tubbo sail off AND Wilbur throwing Jack in the sea MANZ IS STRONG
Wilbur came here to vibe, and he's vibing 😎😎😎
i just realized jack has hair hes actually growing it guys
my fav vlog ever
You guys are looking so good☹️😭❤️
4:32 ayo that’s a little fruity 😟 /j
Wilbur: “I’m making him drink sea water!”  Jack: “what’s it taste like?”  Tubbo: *”POTASSIUM!”*  ( pretty certain that’s the opposite but okay )
never in a million years did i think i'd get to see wilbur pick up jack manifold bridal style and yeet him in the ocean.
WHY DOES WILBUR REMIND ME OF COUNT OLAF-
Wilbur and Tubbo single-handedly became the *saline solution*
“Wow that’s a cool looking buoy!… I like boys.” Once again tubbo supporting gay ptide
I don’t know about y’all but I’m absolutely loving this kind of content
NIKI LOOKS SO PRETTYYY💖🥺
That was quality content not gonna lie
WILBUR SAVING NIKI FROM BEING THROWN INTO THE SEA THOUGH AHHHHHHHHHH
jacks hair is getting longer😳
Why did I read the title as “I raked across the ocean”?
Jack: I am strong niki so I could easily just pick you up! Wilbur: *Im about to end this mans whole career*
Why does Wilbur make Jack looks so small 😭
Niki frowning is officially my worst fear and Im horrfied
Unrelated, but Jack, you need to turn off link sharing, or turn the automod WAY up on this channel
wilbur just.............. throw jack in the fucking ocean........
How the one driver had his phone recording jack lol
I love how minecraft youtubers have now become great friends and meet up in RL to have some fun  It's great!
Not jack thinking Niki would be in the ocean lmaoooo
Oooo that Delfino Plaza remix at the end hit different
Wilbur and Tubbo did really “Travel with the speed of light” on Mercury
Wilbur: gesundheit Me: laughs so hard in dutch
3:08  I've lost things in the past 👁️👄👁️
i love this vlog sm
YES THE ENDING POG
omg jack's hair have grown
Ur hairs growing JSJRJSJKE
It’s a salivated solution
I took up smoking for YouTube
Yes throw Jack in never throw Niki in 😌✋🏼
Niki : you can’t just throw me into the water Wilbur shows up Wilbur : throws jack * Me : WHAT me : I ship Wilbur and Niki OwO
imaging being on a cruise and then looking at the window and seeing jack tubbo and wil and nikki
OMG THIS VLOG WAS SO FUNNY, NOT EVEN 2 SECONDS IN AND I STARTED LAUGHING Well done Mr Manifold!!
my naviphobia really said no to this
Fanartists LETS GOOOOOOOO!
Wilburs little clap once he throws Jack overboard speaks volumes. That man’s a sadist. Great video, lots of fun :)
Imagine just seeing Tubbo and Wilbur fly by on a boat
Tommy: traitor
Now tubbo really became tubboat
tubbo and wilbur seemed like they were just having fun hanging out
5:40 he did not say slug there...
“Today I am captain”
Jack rlly went flying LOL
Wilbur protected Niki from being thrown in. What a gentleman
I still can’t believe my friend Emily said you went to her school garaboldy and she DIDNT be friends with you
wilbur just threw him in- no regrets
ok after finishing the video ive come to the conclusion none of these people are sane.
5:09 this is giving me mule bits energy
WILBUR AND TUBBO CONTENT LETS GOOOOO
mack janifold
jack ur videos are 100% hilarious ✅
TUBBOS THE CAPTAIN
Hey I live there..... huh Welp that’s what I get for being lazy
Earlier my grandfather said he was watching a video where the was a man and some kids in a boat swearing left and right so i was like "wait... lemme just listen in..." but i couldn't hear anything over the fan :/
the moment with sea water is very strange.  upd: i meant when they tasted it
Why is there so much spam here I just wanna have fun in the comments-
YESSS GOD TIER VLOG
WHOPPER
10:13 Jack and Wilbur was reinacting Romeo and Juliet minutes ago and decided to extend it—
Tubbo is looking so adorable in captains outfit:)
Good old Porchester Castle
"i've brought an urn, sorry grandma"  "i- i've brought niki" well..
Rip Tommyinnit
i love tubbo and wilbur together lol
QUEEEEN

I like the outro song and also what is your hair length?-
Astronaut in the ocean
I would like someone to pick me up and launch me into the ocean like wilbur does to jack I just think itd be neat
Okay but someone needs to draw jack and Niki at 7:07 cause their friendship is so cute ;-;
7:06 Wow Titanic but Jack and Niki
I don’t care if it’s copyrighted we need the Wilbur tubbo don’t stop me now footage
I remember that Tubbo kept on saying ''I am the captain!" Multiple times in Tommy's video "Minecraft's funniest pirates" and i guess he's a pirate in real life now.
Jack is the best
this had no business being this funny
I am watching this while at the beach
sacrifice the one you brought for when the punishment? no. sacrifice the man who lost the  lost or host?  yes.
“Fucketh off” Drink the sea water tubbo
Living in Portsmouth and watching this felt really weird especially by my fav youtubers :0
Tubbo: “i like boys!😀…….wait.”
Wilbur and Niki Qre together :D
7:05 oh hey it’s that one Titanic scene
Tubboat irl
niki naming that jack lost love of host BROOO
Dont forget to drink more seawater kids
Why are you doing in Portsmouth people?
I honestly wanted Niki and Jack to win
LMAO wilbur: oh! your engines a yamaha? *yikes*

5:03 “Fucketh off!” 😂😂😂
oh my god i cannot believe that wilbur soot who made an appearance on the jack manifold channel has bought that building and renamed it reddit gold oh wow
"Wherefor art thou, Manifold?" "FuCkEtH oFf!!"
I LOVE THEM SO MUCH.
So now he eats sand and drinks sea water

jacks channel is so under rated
Jack: _i am a strong man_ Wilbur: *picks him up with no problem and yeets him into the water*
Catholics were the ones who hanged people, others were the hanged ones
Sounds like a very manifold thing to do.
I was not expecting wilbur to just pick jack up like that but it was absolutley hilarious
*wilbir casually protecting Niki*
Since when did Jack have hair tho-
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO THROW NIKKI IN
Jack is so funny 😂
I’m srry but who is smaller Nihachu or Tubbo
Tommy punching air right now

You mean to tell me that jack,niki,Wilbur and tubbo were CLOSE to my house
HIS HAIR IS GETTING LONGER
J: “name one thing i’ve lost!” T: “past relationships!” N: “the love or host” *sad silence* J: “…i’ve lost things in the past!”
Minecraft stans are prob gonna drink seawater now.
Oh tubbo trying to be the captain again
TUBBO IN A FULL CAPTAIN'S OUTFIT IS THE MOST ADORABLE THING!!! 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺           Edit: Not an obsessed fangirl tho.
Wilbur is a massive chad

Wilbur being tall in this video is hella scary wth-
How Wilbur was doing immaculate poetry then Jack says: Fucketh off!  Me: XDDDD 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂

How to Get Copyrighted: Give 2 of your Dumb Friends a Speaker And make them listen to Freddie Mercury
4 drunk f***s vibing on a boat🍾🥂
"yours is the east as mine is the west" "fucketh off"
Ngl that looked so fun
Alternative title:Re enacting Romeo & Juliet and Titanic
Wilbur just picked Jack up like he was nothing, mans got princess carried and yeeted into the sea lol
I love this video 🤣
I live in the town opposite Portsmouth. I recognised way too many of the buildings.
I *want* friends like this.
jack is always bullied and it is funny
castaways, we´re castaways
d-day pt. 2
fun fact, when the nose of a boat goes out of the water at high speeds it's called planing :)
Even irl captain tubs is being bullied *sighs*
the way jack looks like a child in wilburs arms LMFAOO
6:30 i am disappointed I didn’t do this because I was on a boat and the engine was a Mercury saddens
Wilbur gets any sense of status or authority it goes to his head so fast
I remember when this only have 600k subs... Now look at it
Underrated
*Wilbur just casually picked up jack like he was a CHILD*
I love how Wilbur like protected Niki😭✋
Ugh I need a Wilbur Soot in my life
They should have gone to isle of MAN 🇮🇲
Can I just turn into a fish and just jump on  QwQ💜
"yours is the east as mine is the west" "fucketh off"
Wilbur telling Tubbo to “drink sea water” is bordering along the lines of the mule bits incident in terms of energy. XD
copywriting....
The whole Romeo and juliet bit is my favorite
This was very pog
I literally was in cowes today 😩
So ur telling me I could’ve seen them ffs. Anyone from iow <33
5:04 best line in history
I really haven't met anyone as funny as this group of people
Jackmanifall off boat
This is my favourite jack Manifold video ever :) they're all good but THIS ONE
the clip of wil and tubbo with the speaker system is so wholesome i want more
poor jack HAHHAHHAH
*Pirates of the Caribbean theme starts playing in the background.*
4:33 same tubbo, same
9:20 The look on Nihachu's face when he starts making all the excuses, I can relate.
Lol
THE END I CANT TTHBBUT4BK
Ok that thumbnail is so cute. HOLY-
I have cousins in cowes
Captain Wilbur has gotta be the best pirate I’ve ever seen.
the number of bots in this comment section...
HA
Your not the captain Tubbo!
JACK WITH HAIR
I was just on a boat    I am sunburned        AH-
The best quote is this video is "fucketh off"
I’m early but don’t know what to comment. Totally early.
Jack... ur head.... your growing hair
Drink more seawater  - Wilbur 2021
The way Wilbur lifted Jack and then threw him in the water was just epic
THE SOCKS JONATHAN, THE SOCKS.
I think that’s the only time ever I’ve seen Niki upset
They just went to my hometown and i had no clue, mental break time
Can I just say. Niki is the cutest thing on earth
Like the music what’s the name of it
Tubbo: Wow that’s a cool looking buoy  Also tubbo: I like boys 😎
“you don’t drive a boat, you conn it”- papa jim 2021
Please Wilbur and Tubbo singing Queen killed me that was my favorite moment omg
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is why Wilbur Soot is my favorite, 10:00
the ocean is a ✨ saline solution ✨
Am I the only one wondering why tommy is never in the vlogs with them
"Drink more seawater" -Wilbur Soot 2021   This quote was sponsored by Fresh Water
picking up jack and just lobbing him into the sea might be the best thing i’ve seen wilbur do
I’m literally at Hawaii and all I’m doing is watching jack manifold
" thats a cool looking buoy ! "   *" i like boys ! "*
When jack got thrown into the ocean why did I think “swim fishy swim”
waiting for a "Me, Ph1lzA, and Karl Jacobs flew jetpacks"
Atleast without tommy the vid is 1000x funnier now
I like boys!  "what"
My family usually go to isle of wight (ik I spelt that wrong) every year but coz of covid we didn't go but if we went I probs would of seen them and now I wanna cry  🥲
Can somebody please tell me what those glasses are if you would you would be a very nice person ( I sill subscribe to ur channel if u do I promise)
Serotonin level when Wilbur threw Jack in the sea 📈📈📈📈
Wilbur the gentleman, throws jack in instead of niki
jack should've come up from the water and jumped back in pushing niki with him
When Wilbur is talking captain niki has her head in her hands 😂
6:41 THE WAY I STARTED JAMMING WITH THEM
wilbur is so strong omfg
I loved when Niki went "The Love or Host" and Jack literally rubbed his eyes because of how much of a truth that one was lmao
4:21 Niki is Navi from the legend of Zelda.
when you internet is bad and you can't watch the vidio vidoi how tf do say vido bro :(
3:03 they did him like that
Wilbur actually threw jack manifold into the sea IM DIEING OF LAUGHTER 🤣
What is the song?
Is so dedicated to thrown niki in: calm Gets thrown in by beanstalk man: panik
Omg when they had Freddy mercury on is lmao
I want the copyrighted clip O_O
The fact that I was gonna make a Don't Stop Me Now Alivebur animatic and Wilbur started playing it in this video-
for some reason i really like this video
POG
Niki hugs Jack. . . Wilbur throws Jack in water.
JACK HAS HAIR AND ITS THE FIRST TIME IM SEEING IT
please PLEASE tell me that Jack and Niki  are dating
Cinematic master piece LIKE WHY DID IT FEEL LIKE A SCENE FROM A MOVIE AT 6:24
4:22 nikki kinda sounds like navi
*fucketh off* is my new favourite phrase
YES WILBUR GO!!! I do feel bad though you just got chucked in the sea....ok it was funny. Can't wait for the next vid and I love all you do🤗🤗🤗
wilbur was an icon in this video
I have to admit, the way Wilbur chucked Jack in was quite satisfying.
i just had 6 anxiety attacks please stop
1:04 i swear every millennial calls lakes/oceans drinks
"you spin me right 'round baby right round like a rec-"  anyone? no? alright
WAIT ⟟ JUSG NOTICED JACK IS GROWING HIS HAIR OUT 👍👍👍
5:03 had me cryng😭😭😂😂😂
*Fucketh off* I died
*where’s tommy*
i like when you got thrown in the ocean
Ah yes tommyinit’s new pirate mod video irl
VLOGGGGGG
i don’t think the go pro was recording 🤨🤨🤨
*The city's Old English Anglo-Saxon name, " Portesmuða ", is derived from port (a haven) and muða (the mouth of a large river or estuary). In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a warrior named Port and his two sons killed a noble Briton in Portsmouth in 501.*
NOT THE "IM STRONG" AND TGEN WILL JUST SAY YEEEET
Wilbur just acted so calm while throwing Jack into the sea, and he picked him up like it was nothing!
his hair has already grown a lot. rip baldmanifold
i feel like a manifold in the ocean
LIVED THIS VLOG
"FUCKETH OFF" "I like boys" added to wattpad

i think all of them are iconic-
THIS IS THE MOST BEST VLOG EVER
Don’t stop me cause I’m having a good ti-  there goes Jacks add revenue press F in the chat.
THE SHEER SIZE DIFFERENCE IS SO APPARENT WHEN WILL PICKS JACK UP LMAO also poor jack got thrown into the sea with his socks on

YOU HEAR ME GUYS? WILBUR AND TUBBO CONTENT, TODAY IS THE BEST DAY IN EXISTENCE
3:00 Jack: “Name one thing I’ve lost” Tubbo: “past relationships” Niki: “love or host”
Why do i find it entertaining that i have been to most of the places in this video- on holiday though, i dont live in england. I live in a different part of the uk :D Also the glass floor in Spinaker Tower is weirdly terrifying-
veri funi (:
Imagine how kind those captains would’ve been to race each other to get pure psychopaths to an island to win a race 😭😭
Fucketh off  - Jack Manifold  2021
Why are there so many bots?
Fucketh off  - Jack Manifold  2021
I just want to say that I feel slightly robbed of Tubbo in the boat going "you spin me right round baby right round"
supreme editing this video is pure energy encapsulated!
Jack manidrown is real
What I would do to be able to watch Wilbur and Tubbo sing to Freddie Mercury
“fucketh off!”
I was gonna feel bad for niki but she didn’t go in and I don’t feel bad for jack
Very very good run
Im happy their having so much fun out of Covid 19
Not the same without tommy
I guess they are true _cap_ tains
I started choking on my ramen because these people make me laugh so much!!
Wilber: Desalinate the water Wilber: drink more sea water Tubbo: inhales the water
4:30 Tubbo- are we gonna ignore that-? Yes? Okay
The glasses makes everything Wilbur does hilarious
He was in socks
yeah wilbur would never through niki in :> also it was so cute when niki put her arms around jack🤍
Niki talking with Manifold unaware of the "if you lose" agreement   Jack : We gonna win this Niki  Niki: what if we lose? wait-you told me a while ago that you where gonna throw me in the sea if we lose- Jack : ... Niki : nahh you're not going to throw me into the sea  Jack : Niki : Niki : *You're not gonna throw me into the sea, right?*
i love pirates of the caribbean
allá está súper soleado, y acá yo en Chile me estoy cagando de frio
LMAO I'VE WATCHED THE VID LIKE 2 SECS AND IM LAUGHING
Doing a whole 360 and still passing Jack's boat was the biggest flex I've seen
I've acctually done that and been there
OMG
I love this video
4:33 i like boys 😁👍
jack manidrown
Are we gonna talk about how tubbo and wilbur get along so damn well.
My only thought the whole video: does the driver even know there racing?
Will is strong he just picked up a full grown man Holy cow.
The vlogs are escalating
HAIR
Jack Manidrown
Are you telling me. The JACK MANIFOLD. Can't handle being thrown into the ocean? Wow, ok XD
THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD VLOG ! <33
Bro you should of brought Puffy. She would be a great captain.
"i railed the ocean"
Me: tells a joke  Wilbur : Silence speaks volume
What a great thing to do on Father's Day! Can anyone else relate?
1:10 "Thats french" JACK THAT WAS GERMAN😭✋
Niki was just fuckin terrifying in that losing shot
This was so fun to watch
Jack has hair,,,,
*Fucketh off*   My favorite quote
“Name one thing I lost “ Niki: love or host Jack:🥲
4:31 tubbo do you have something to share with the class
10:16 and yet people ask me why im scared of wilbur
POG!!! :D

what is the name of the sunglasses that will was wearing when they first got on the boat.
What kinda sunglasses is Wilbur wearing? They look cool af😎
I feel bad for people who don't watch jacks vlogs. They will never be able to witness greatness

Imagine they were just there racing and the phone slipped off their hand 😂😂
6:34 this part made me so happy omg
“thats a cool looking buoy! i like boys!” had me crying laughing 😭
niki just suffers from secondhand embarrassment this entire video
Will protecting nikki is everything
*FuCkEtH oFf*  Ah yes
The isle of white is closer to France then to England but it belongs to England
"Drink seawater" - the man that eats sand 👍🏼
2:32 Irish gang rise up 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
5.33 this just reminds me of the Natural disasters mod video where Wilbur forced tubbo to work for him at the mule bits shop.
its like going on a roadtrip and there are two cars. wilbur and tubbo OBVIOUSLY got the fun driver
Omg look at Tubbo in the captains hat 🤭 0:25

This video makes me so incredibly happy lol
i love how every time tubbo is on a boat he thinks that he’s the captain
I don’t subscribe for the fact that all of there viewers won’t be subscribed. Even if every single person who watched this video was I would not be. I hold power in that for no reason and honestly it’s kinda sad.
Jack Manifold: Name one thing I’ve lost Niki: *The love or host* I find it very amusing and fitting that Niki was the one who said this
Good as always the editing and clips never fail to make me laugh
“Fucketh off” I cant-
0:26 he's the *CAP* tain... No ok...
4:33 interesting
The fanfic writers have been fed today

not watching this is a crime
It's so weird seeing him with hair
“i like boys” me too, tubbo, me too
Wilbur's Driver just started showing off at the end xD
Jack maniocean
Wilbureo and jackiet, the most tragic love story of the century
Wilbur is so strong First: Threw Niki bc she said she was strong. Second: Held George on his back and ran up a hill. and now he picked up jack
This so cool
lmao i love how wil was carrying jack like they were lovers
6:30 THE BUILDING BEHIND THEM IS SPINIKER TOWER AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
UR GROWING HAIR JACK!!!!!!!
Niki: you are not going to throw me in the water Jack: but that was- Niki: *glares intensely*
Happy Father’s Day to Jack Manifold because we don’t talk about how much Jack Manifold is the dad friend in every vlog
Nikis look at Jack when they loose
Okay everyones talking about how savage Niki is but I can't get over how absolutely  terrifying it must be to have Wilbur  towering over you, say you had a good run and just yeet  you into the bloody ocean.
Not again
7:05 was so sweet, i wish i was friends with niki 😭
I’m so happy about these vlogs bc everyone involved in them are like my favorite people ever (minus ranboo my beloved)
my day was terrible but all of you made me smile so thank you :)
I can't believe you were in Portchester that's where I live
I know where they are
good video Jack :D very fun to watch
WHY IS WILBUR MAKING TUBBO DRINK SEA WATER I-
okay but wilbur holding jack was kinda fruity
Alternate title: jack, will, tubbo and Niki get ignored by 2 sailors
nice
Did Jack just lose his gopro and hat at the end?
Ah miss Nihachu is so pretty
yooooo
Wilbur Soot once said... 	“Drink more seawater”
*Nicki and Jack being competitive*    And then there's tubbo and Wilbur taking about Scooby Doo

Here they are, all my favorite YouTubes, and together! ❤️
Yoooo I just realised that I was there I swear to god if someone comments who asked
Wayyyyy I live on the Isle of Wight

They’re not speaking English, that’s French.  Meanwhile it’s German…
Ok but Wilbur in a captains hat *chefs kiss *
Banger vid
…atleast it wasn’t niki right 😂😂😂
I don't know here jack's hat is at the finale wh
Jack really got threw into the sea, I think that’s hilarious
The fact that Wilbur can just PICK UP Jack Manifold is horrifying and I’m now more scared of Wilbur than I would have ever previously expected
what’s going on here
3:19 WHY IS WILBURS LEG SO LONG LMAOO
E
Yaayy! I love vlogs!!
done i guess
4:37 Maybe thrown?!?! Hell nah.
epic!
Wilbur holding him bridal style was everything

They are in Portsmouth, my hometown. This is so cool
Ello

JACK GOT YEETED
tubbo: i like boys-

6.9k comments. nice
For the people who want to replay this >:) here: 10:18
where can I buy wilburs sunglasses?
yeaaa
Might of missed this but idc it's still good!!!
I saw this and said "uh oh" ....let's see how this goes. Edit: uuuuh so I watched it all now, I had quite a good laugh. Amazing. Tubbo and will are adorable together.
I am the captain now
Next time they are gonna buy private jets
Will looks so proud of himself tossing Jack in the sea xD
Ok I'm just impressed wilbur lifted jack up that easily that requires some strength
Back home after travelling to Portsmouth today—
7:20 the most intense boat race i've ever seen
Wilbur just got out of eye surgery
HE WAS WEARING SOCKS!!!
Tommy is going to be in the comments saying that he could of came and made it 10000% funnier
Guys now you HAVE to sub he just got thrown into the water with socks on 😟
jack manidrown
WILBURRR
wil:” yours is the east as mine is the west”  jack: “fucketh off”
Wilbur: “you’ve had a good run” *wilbur proceeds to pick up jack in bridal carrying position*  Me: you wish that was you huh
Why does Jack suddenly look not bald
Jack is an astronaut.
The best bit: Wilber Soot lifting up Jack Manifold and throwing him into the water instead of Niki
I forgot how much taller Wilbur is than jack
PLSS WILBUR PICKING JACK UP
6:48 proper scared me
"i like boys"
Now Tubboat it's not only a fiction
Wilbur is ded
My fav shot in this whole video is wilbur snd tubbo swinging their hats around while freddy mercury plays in the background
Jojolion real????????
I think it’s hilarious seeing what rich kids will do with money compared to rich adults. Like these guys have just gone on a month long extreme sports spree with way too much candy and that’s totally relatable IF I was rich
mate this was an absolute banger
"I've never lost anything ever. Name one thing I've lost." "Past relationships." "The love or host." Ok but you didn't have to murder him-
I can legit imagine the racing part being in a movie
I grew up in a city named Portsmouth but its in the USA so bash if you need
ITS FUCKING MONTERAY
I wish I had that much fun
Love your videos keep it up
This now one of my favorite vlogs!!!
I kinda need the full Freddie Mercury song edit thoughh
Jack with hairrrrrr
It’s a good day when Jack Manifold posts 😩👍
I want Wilbur to throw me into the sea
Tubbo and Wilbur just jamming to don’t stop me now and being behind jack and Nicki and still winning
The whole video:   A whole Scooby-Doo-adventure-titanic-air-PolluTitInG-FreDdy-MerCuRy-VibIng-bOaT-rAcE.
00:19 *yeah cos ya don’t drive a boat, ya steer it!*
5:43 🤔🤨
4:58  Wilbur: Wherefore art thou Mainfold? Yours is the east as mine is the west  Jack: *fucketh off*
5:02 "fucketh off!" FKING UNDERRATED HOLY SHIT
PLEASE TELL ME THE TUB-BOATS PLZZZ PLEAS P,EASEPELae PEASE
Wil's smile after Jack gets out is so sweet, I'm glad they're enjoying their release from quarantine.
This is so funny lol
Cool copycat

Me over here: “bRuH he is unnaturally tall” “It’s just like Romeo and juliet except romeo kills juliet and get really happy” “It’s like titanic but jack dies- I didn’t watch the movies, i think he does die”
This wasn’t 100000 percent funny cause Tommy innit Isn’t here. But I will admit it was %100 funny
Only Jack manifold would get a smoking addiction for us, love him for that
Castaways, we are castaways
Tubbo in boat what will he do
That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen
The fact that I’ve been to spinnaker tower and where they are now feels weird now.
This vlog is 1001% funnier than Tommy's last vlog
Jack gotten thrown in the water was funny lol 😂
This is the vagest vlog ever
Wilbur went into his mansplaining arc for a second
Now we wait for all of them to meet up
One quick question,is Jack and Niki brother and sister? they looks like it
Wet haired Jack 😩😩😩

JACK MANIFOLD GROWING OUT HIS HAIR, POGGERS
Tubbo on Tommyinnit's pirate video : I am Captain Tubbo in this video : I am Captain          A child never becomes a captain...😅😅
I’m late
The fact that Wilbur was basically ignored by the person driving and just said 'Silence speaks volumes' every time is just so good
Wilbur and Tubbo captains understood the assignment
Tubbo: So what other mysteries do you have for us Today? Wilbur: mysteries? What is this scooby Fucking doo?! Tubbo: Yeah!  Ah yes Scooby Doo
Jackmanifol off a boat 😅😂
"Wow that's a cool looking buoy..."      "I like boys".....      .....😶
Why did I hear that as “she has been demoted to castaway” 💀
I got a burger ad before this i just went BUT IS IT A WHOPPA

Moim flexem jest to że oglądałam to gdy było tu 15k like
WAIT NO CAPTAIN WILBUR
Gesundheit. FRENCH
lol i can see the fanart and fanships coming 7:05 XDXD, but seriously theyre wholesome friends.
Wilbur and Tubbo blasting Queen is just the best thing ever. Like I’ve been on a boat before and if you have the right song then it’s major vibes and to could just feel that
I like boys
Why can’t I remember where the music is from at 0:27
HELP I CANT STOP LAUGHING THIS WAS SO FUNNY
I am terrified of Wilbur now :))
I live on the isle of wight
I LIVE IN PORTSMOUTH IM SO SAD I MISSED THEM
HE HAS HAIR
tubbo: that's a cool looking bouy! i like boys! is this tubbo's coming out??? /j -for legal reasons, this is a joke, please don't cancel me twitter-
yes
Say what now
i fucking love this clip 6:42
title: Tubbo claiming to be captain again, but this time in real life instead of mc.
i'm having a good time
Did jack lose the go pro when he got thrown?
YES WILBUR . MERCURY IS INDEED BETTER THAN YAMAHA. I
Wilbur and Tubbo are dumbasses in the real world
oh boi the hair is starting to grow out this is so strange
3:02 niki I-
Why is Tubbo always the captain now?
2:32 I'm Catholic...
Throw them all in
I LOVE THIS!!
YOU WERE IN PORTSMOUTH?! I WISH I CALLED IN SICK TO WORK
Now instead of saying oh my god or holy crap, im gonna say “HOLY TUBBO”
omg the height difference between Wilbur and Jack is just too funny
Jack Manifold this is starting to look like a Mr Beast video Jack Manifold
Great vid jack
"I have no fears of loss. I've never loss anything ever. Name one thing I've lost "  Tubbo: "Past relationships."  Niki: "The Love or Host."   Jack: *wipes away tears*  "I've lost things in the past."
Wilbur picked that man up so easily
mod video irl
HAIR 😩
Jack and Niki are platonic soulmates    Change my mind
Yeah u re livin’ the life
HE CHANGED THE THUMBNAIL
Im glad to see Nikki in the videos, she is finally being in people videos
Omg he has hair!
when they started belting don’t stop me now i felt that
when I saw the title, I thought it was in Minecraft… not irl 😭
Lmao, Niki's disappointment with Jack when they lost
its called the sea
Will just full on dice rolled Jack into the ocean
Tubbo : "what a nice boy" "I like boys" Me: :O
What is the name of the song that Wilbur was playing? the copyright one
best vlog ever.
Your best vid yet mate!
the "oh my god" when niki death stared jack was the best thing ive seen all day.
YESH ANOTHER VLOG
When Jack got YEETED by Wilbur XD I
This is the best vlog so far
this was such a good video omg
Always hilarious Jack!!!
Jack being held by Will like a damsel in distress: I don’t find this bit very funny
i love buoys
Wilbur really said: gezondheid and it was dutch
name one thing i've lost: i fear no man, but that thing.... *the love or host* it scares me.
Pog
Its like Pirates of Caribbean but instead of Caribbean its pirates of Jack Manifold
omg he actually fell in
Gives me drop dead Fred vibes
What is that song called at 7.20?
Jack with hair scares me
I wonder if I’ll ever have the answers. It has been so long. Help me.
4:05 I have been up the spinikar tower it did not end well I don't like hights
4:32 ptide 🏳️‍🌈
Jack manifold with hair?! Pog
the little head nod wilbur gave after throwing jack fucking sent me 😂
I’m late
9:50 onwards will live rent-free in my head for the next 52 years... and i regret nothing
Wilbur picking up Jack and throwing him in the ocean is a sign of dominance
wilbur's cackle when tubbo said, "I like boys" fuels me
"They don't want to wave back they're too old" that's a tubbo moment right there ladies and gentlemen and everything in between
0:25 what are Niki and Wilbur doing there in the background...?🤭
Tubbo's grandma's urn lives another day.
Will in this video looks like a dreamworks villain
Wilbur should become a full-time captain
I really enjoyed this one
I'm not shipping I swear but I love the friendship between niki and will 🥺❤️❤️
Lol
gesundheit
That Mario music in the background in each video is making it even more fantastic while watching
The 163 dislikes are from the people on the bigger ship
“Fucketh off” - Jack
Never realized how short tubbo was intel he was right beside wilbur..
Manidrown
pog
Can't wait for the fanart ✨💜
The st Claire is a ferry, not a cruise liner. It runs between postmouth and wooton on the Isle of Wight. Also racing across the Solent is hardly “the ocean” i can sail across it in well under an hour.
LETS GOOOOOOOOO WITH THE BANGER VLOGS MR MANIFOLD!!!!
XD
BAHHA JACK AND NIKIS TITANIC SCENE
*If wilbur's legs are that long, Ranboo's legs are..*

"i like boys"- Tubbo
"Gesundheit" LMFAOOO

When someone tells Minecrafters to go outside
My question is where did the go pro go when jack was thrown in
Jack's hair is growing, but the way its growing..

Drink more sea water- wilbur soot 2021
I have an unhealthy addiction to queen so whenever they played the first best I immediately new what it was 🤣
tommy would be loving the sea cause he needs salt
9:20 NIKIS LOOK AT JACK IM CRYING
This is golden
Everyone's a savage here Literally me: Um yes Sea water, it is good for you
SIIIIIIII
This is a boat moment
LMAO SCARY NIKI AND BUFF WILBY AHAHHAHA
Tubbo shipping Jack and Niki is just  *so pure..*  Edit! People in the replies, no I do not ship them!
I like how they are both so much older than me and can’t drive a boat but I can
Awww jacks valuable item was niki
When Will carries Jack bridal style, the artists be like *yes more food*. And I’m all for it, please artists do it- or when jack gets throw into the water XD
“Fucketh off” so inspirational
Your lying if you say that Niki isnt pretty
Dude this looks like they are all having the time of their lives.
Wilbur picked him up like a small child damn
this was actually very very very good quality
5:04 "Fucketh off"                                   - Jack (Romeo) Manifold
That’s a cool lookin buoy*I like boys* 😂
the fact that jack thinks wightlink is a cruise is too perfect. the amount of time it takes to get across the water is basically a cruise
Wilbur and Tubzo jamming to “don’t stop me now” by Freddie Mercury is just me
i loved every single second of this video
We added the pirate mod to real life and this made it 1000 percent funnier
I thought I was in the wrong channel but it's actually true0-0
POGCHAMP       pogchamp
Do another race but dis time more throwing people in ocean
*Strongbur*
Me totally not calling jack “jackass”

Rip the camera that jack lost when he got thrown in.
I’ve been where you are

Jack Manifold: "Name 1 thing I've lost."  Tubbo: "Past relationships." Niki: "The Love or host."
Bruh I started getting hyped when Don't Stop Me Now started playing but then they had to cut it out cuz of copyright... that sucks.
TJATS MY CITY PORTSMOUTH 😭😭
Wilbur: recites Shakespeare  Jack: ~fucketh off~
Tubbo; I like boys! Tommy; *Did I stutter?*
the fact they were so close to where I live is so sad ☹️
Jack ManidRoWn
Jack being treated like the prince he is :  4:49 - 7:05 - 10:11
I don't know why, but I just lost it when Wilbur just picked Jack up like a baby and threw him in the ocean.
WILBUR CARRYING JACK MANIFOLD IS A GREAT SIGHT
only ogs know he changed the thumbnail
OMG THEY WENT SO CLOSE TO MY CITY IM CRYING-
haha omg this video was wholesome!
"i like boys" :v tubbo pls jajajajaja Woah Wilbur is so strong 😏 i like it ❤️❤️

Holy shit Tubbo in my hometown, this is a great Portsmouth moment
i love how wilbur was just able to pick up the manifold so easily
i love how wilbur was just able to pick up the manifold so easily
The thumnail was different wasn't it?
Jack: Name one thing I've lost Tubbo: Past relationships Niki: *The Love or Host*  Jack: *cri*
This video is my main source of serotonin.
Niki and jack did the tytanic thing on a boat
Jack: name one thing I’ve lost  Me: His hair  Niki: love or host (Holy honk I didn’t think I’d get that much likes)
I am very surprised Wilbur did not consume sand throughout the entire of this video
“I like boys” -Tubbo, June of 2021
Hiiiiiiiiii
another great vid
Mmm seawater😋
1. It is German 2. WTF WILBUR CAN SAY GESUNDHEIG?! 😲😲
I love how happy Nikki is when Jack was thrown i into the water XDDDD
did you get a woppah.?
great vlog mr. manifold :)) this was very chaotic
"F*cketh off" is probably my favourite Jack Manifold quote after watching this video
4:30 happy pride month ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I like that Wilbur shows his dominance over all his friends by throwing them. First Niki, then Jack.
Wilbur just fucking picked up manifold like he was a feather
the image of wilbur carrying jack bridal style will be forever burned in my mind
6:40 as short as it was,that was by far one of the best scenes
5:42 i-
lmao where is tommy
SHACK MANIFALL
Well, that looks FUN.
Jack manifold, more like jack manifolded!
Shout out to the two captains, who had to see all of that first. /j Loved this vlog, Jack❤️
This is a good video jack manifold
I can’t tell if Wilbur is strong or if jack is light.
I like the part where jack gets thrown into the ocean
Quote of the day “drink more sea water”
as someone who lives in cowes on the isle of wight this made me cry a tad

"Did you see me slut drop?' LMAOO

Wilbur's little nod and smile while the camera was panning towards the end of the video was 👌
That was cool whats the outro music
OMG Yess i loved this blog it was so good i hope u had a good swim too!!
The way Wilbur holds Jack before he throws Jack in
I never thought the thing that would cure every mental illness I have including dyslexia would be Wilbur holding jack bridal style
Gutted cuz I live near gunwarf and I would loved to have met u 3:59
I love wilburs bright orange socks
Wilbur and Tubbo’s captain though. That guy went full show off lol
this actually made me laugh??? out loud???
Today was my first day actually being on a boat lol
“God rest their souls.”   Tubbo: “are they dead?”
Is that capture jack sparow
good job wheatskins, outro music on point

New title: tubbo and wilbur jamming while losing.

The outfit is so tubbo
Jack:there's nothing I've lost Tubbo:past relationship Niki:love or host 😂😂😂

This video would have been so epic with Pirates of the Caribbean music
Love this video by far 👏😂
the way wilbur picked up jack so easily has me crying
The fact that they filmed this about 20 mins away from me is amazing
did wilbur just....... nvm
HAHAAHHAHA why did will pick jack up like its an everyday thing😩

Did anyone notice he brought niki so if he lost he’d throw her in?
Ver pog video
These vlogs are just getting funnier and crazier. How
Jack's channel has grown so much
Holy f
Where can I see the POV: Wilbur Soot Throws You Into The Sea
The drone shots are sick!
Damn, Wilbur really just simped for Nikki hard

fucketh off is now my favorite manifold line

1:00 that literally means "gangster" in Hindi o.o
I love the way Wilbur picked up Jack 😂😂😂
They litterally left down the road from me!!! Ahhhhhhh
6:18
0:23 HIS HAIR HAS GOTTEN SO LONG
5:56 just a royal navy ship photo bombing the video

THIS IS SICK
Respect for Wilbur and Tubbo playing my favorite Song of all time!
While u were in the sea did u see a drown?
Me: *hears isle of wight* "oh i love it there" Me: *suddenly realises* "waiiiittt I live in these areas...so weird to hear youtubers visit these area's" xD   Really puts into perspective of how human "well known youtubers" are just like the rest of us ^_^  I hope you guys had a wonderful time!  Wilbur - "castlemouth" Me - "fairly certain that's portchester castle...might be wrong, but pretty sure" xD
that's a good one guys. Didn't think I needed Wilbur and Jack reenacting Romeo and Julia. And I'm still not convinced I do but I got it anyways. Great
"fucketh off" is the best thing jack manifold has ever said
IM NOT FRENCH
I didn't know I needed Wilbur casually yeeting Jack into the ocean in my life but apparently I did because that was amazing.
Horse back riding with Wilbur and GogY with tubbo and tommy
ivhgv
I also want a friend group like they have, like damn🥺

*Gets saltwater in his mouth* "That's a sign of pollution, it tastes of salt"   Wilbur showing us why he has 10,000 IQ

Great. Love it.
I’ve only seen half of the vlot jet and I can already say this is a piece of gold!

alternative title: 24 year old man makes a bee child drink seawater   also known as    *saline solution*
MY HOUSE IS IN THE BACKGOUND WTF
Anyone who doesnt know wilbur is 6'5 (200cm) must think the rest of them are MIDGETS like holy hell ksgsjagsj
its the fact that wilbur was strong enough to lift jack up and throw him like a baby for me, like, i just want to know how light jack is now

Tubbo’s and Wilbur’s boat near the end:  LEMME SHOW YOU SOME REAL SPEED
My sister just came to me and said "that's Jacki Miniboi!" I'm actually wheezing 😀✋
LOL i live on the iow xD
sad fact. I'm younger than Jack and I know how to drive a boat because I raced on them. Bruh ... and I wasn't eighteen. (I almost destroyed the ship ... yes. My coach hates me for it) 😂.

4:32 Tubbo, our gay icon ✨😍🏳️‍🌈
The Freddie Mercury bit is so wholesome and they’re genuinely having so much fun, it’s so sad Jack couldn’t keep it in. Copyright ruins the fun of videos

Niki hugging Jack is so wholesome I can't-
9:27

Nikki: "This is the most wholesome moment today."  Also Nikki: "I HAD TO GO TO THE FUCKING WATER."

That was amazing XD the way Wilbur threw him into the ocean
WHAT A NICE VIDEO JACK KEEP IT UP!!! It was so fun to watch!!!!

This video was superior to all others
BRUH WILBUR JUST PICKING UP JACK LIKE THAT, I CANT-
Wish we get a full version of Don't Stop Me Now featuring Tubbo and Wilbur Soot!
I literally cried of happiness when i heard him say hes going to the isle of white lmao im 5 miles away from the cost

7:54
The new Pirates of the Caribbean
MY THERAPY UPDATE !!!
oh my god this was so chaotic from start to finish i love it
When Wilbur said the land of ho all I thought of was westward ho in Devon in the uk
*these vlogs are the cure to my sadness*
May the GoPro R.I.P 😓
The dynamic between these four sent me  Wilbur: The big brother who misses being a child Jack: The younger child who's mischief gets punished by the big brother Niki: The responsible one who didn't sign up for any of this Tubbo: The youngest child for plot purposes
can we acknowledge the fact at how easy it was for wilbur to pick up jack
7:18
Now all tubbo needs to do is spin the boat around and sing “you spin me right round”
This felt like a jack and Wilbur romance
jack and nihachu is almost equal to Wilbur and nihachu
LMAOO these are so fun to watch omll
i agree jack, niki is an extremely valuable item
this is one of my favorite vlogs of all time
Sure good to see portsmouth and the Isle of wight again after a year or 2
Omg Jack has hair
Niki looked like she was about to kill jack when they lost LMAO
Will: Gesundheit Jack: they not speaking English, they are speaking FreNcH *no it is german*
i’m pretty sure i was actually in the isle of wight at this time and for that i am very sad
‘Slug drop’ 5:42
10:13 I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who wouldn't mind being Jack here! ;-)
Is this the first time will and Tubbo met in real life?
9:20 d e a t h s t a r e
aka Wilbur Soot Fancam
Incredible
6:38
This explains Wilbur's reddit better. Everyone was confused.
Go Captain soot looks kinda
I love how one of the captains of the boats also filmed jack getting thrown lmao
This is the funniest video I’ve ever seen well done jack
"Wow! That's a cool looking boy! I like boys." - Tubbo
Niki:I have to go into the FUCKING water!! 😡 Wilbur:Did you not have fun Niki?  Also Wilbur:Yeah, that ain't happening *throws Jack into the water*
Will: "We call those doritos"  Me: "I'm hungry now"
PLSSS WILBUR LOOKS SO TALL COMPARED TO JACK 😭 he looked so small in wilburs arms 💀
this is literally the best vlog ever,  all of the bits were golden omg
I live about an hour from Portsmouth. Always have to swim in the sea when I get the chance, even in the winter XD

7:06 in a parallel universe, Jack and Rose didn’t go on the Titanic, because they were broke. So they just filmed it on a small boat. (Colorized c.1911)
Willber was flirting with Jack and then carried him in bridal position.... Romance is in the air❤️💐  (lol)
I was waiting for Wilbur to make a saline solution joke…
Jack a little life lesson the Isle of Wight is nowhere near France
did tubbo just come out

“Silence speaks volumes”                            -Willbur soot, 2021
3:43 I was like: don’t touch my idol. They didn’t say anything so it’s good. 😂
can you imagine working as a boat driver, and most of your experience is either partiers, tourists or nature enthusiasts, and then one day you turn up for work and you're greeted by a 6,5 man who forces people to drink sea water, a 17 yr old deaf boi, an angry British man, and a sometimes wholesome sometimes savage German girl.     How scarring.
I did this like 2 years ago with 3 of my friends and my team mate was bout to get pushed in when I just fove in. Was cold
6:30 the song here is Dont stop me now by Queen im pretty sure
Jack knew you had to throw in whatever you brought if you lose so he brought Wilbur and niki. Great friend right there 😨👍
*THEY HAVE A SPEAKER SYSTEM?!* One song later. *it’s all copyrighted*
i have no reason to comment apart from the fact i want bots to reply
Here from tubbo ⬇️
YOOOOOOOOOOO
Jack and niki were having a good time🤨😏
you are old jack manifold. you are a old man and you are very bold
Did he lost the camera in the sea when he got thrown in the water?
Jack looked so small when Wilbur picked him up 😆

Great Blog Jack,how was the swim? Lol  But honestly Will picking up Jack too throw him in instead of Niki is adorable and hilarious
so proud of tubbo for coming out, very cool
Lol
Isn't this the first time Wilbur and Tubbo are meeting irl
This really is one of my favourite vlogs so far :DD The "fucketh off" line caught me so off guard i wheezed
Niki + Jack titantic scene can make a grown man cry and that's fine.
Quack
Wilba is so strong
7:25 wow they are having a journey 🤣 7:58 I love how they are chilling and don’t even care about wining. While jack does and is losing. Tbh I feel like the boat drivers just did it on purpose. 8:19 lol the people just don’t care 8:26 awww tbh if I was in Nikis position I would feel the same probably. 9:31 dude she shouldn’t need to wth jack. Also I thought that was a bit, is it actually gonna happen.Also can’t blame her for swearing guys 🤣. 9:50 lol it’s obviously gonna be jack ayyy Niki doesn’t have to 🤣 10:13 🤣🤣🤣 lmao Wilbur also tbh I feel like he probably hated Wilbur doing that. But I feel like jack just rewatching this was like, well at least Niki didn’t have to or just laughed. 10:22 we love ya jack 🤣 ,listen at least it wasn’t Niki. Lol tbh I don’t even watch Niki.
Ok
This is how many people live on the Isle of Wight and are flipping out rn :D ⬇️
Niki: *"I'm Very Happy To Be Here."*  Me: *"That Was Beatiful"*
The way Wilbur just cradled jack manifold lmao
i just looked up there is an island called isle of man

Who else thought when Wilbur was like “You had a good run, Jack” and he stood behind him just the pure height of him and those words are just terrifying and too intimidating-
the fact that ur so near my house makes me wish i went outside that day
gotta say Manifold really upped his game with cinematic shots, gotta appreciate that
wILBUR GOT NO BUSINESS MAKING MY JAW DROP WITH HOW EASILY HE LIFTED JAC WTF
I’ve been to the Isle of Wight before
Isle of wight

Jack should grow his hair out then stream him and Tommy while Tommy shaves his head
“Look at that bouy!” “I like boys!” TUBBO ARE YOU JOKING?
VERY POGGGG
The true captain wears 2 caps 😎
Big Wilbur threw off small manifold with ease
Eats jazz weerd 2 sea width out Tommy...
Niki is such a sassy woman sometimes.
Inhale the sea water
We did it Reddit
Will being huge 10:11 lol The bit was deffo worth it for me! Hilarious af
3:22  Wilbur: "This is what the Fanart need to be"  Artist : *Intensively opening their drawing software*
The Reddit fan art for Wilbur holding jack is going to be extremely traumatic to me

Speed changes like tides in the ocean
I love this video 😁😁😁 and everyone in it
Tubbo is the ASS Captain

MANIFOLD OVERBOARD
Wilbur just straight up said Jack manifold, dont touch my woman
AWESOME!!! Love this vlog
This is probably my favourite video ever. Such a good group
Im letting my hair develop because I am dyeing my hair. Good job Jack for falling into the ocean and Niki has a stare that scars me for life 10/10 would recommend watching to see Jack get thrown.
wilbur scares me sometimes
Noce 👍
6:40 the hat part is so cute to me and idk why Oh noooo it got edited out cuz of copyright :c
Will and jack in nutshell

He threw him in with his socks on now he’ll have wet socks that’s the most evil thing Wilbur had done
'Pirates of the Channel'
6:39 bro, i just had to wacth this bit like 6312 times. i love it, dont know why tho-

DID YOU GET A WOPPER
Good Video, thank you for the content
when willbur threw jack in the water besides Niki I almost screamed that was so cool
Quotes “Poor grandma, I brought an ern” “They know their ship is bigger then ours” “Fucketh off” “I did bring a valuable item” “Are we going to cowes” “We can be just like best mates”(like that was gonna happen) “All the wrongdoers, all the Catholics” “Name one thing I’ve lost” *instant regret* “Drink more seawater”(thx) “I like boys” “Did you see me slug drop?”
then blasting music then dancing was just so amaixng and i wish i could do that with friends
Tubbo: “they could easily just ram us and kill us all.” Niki: “I think that was my favorite moment of the day, so wholesome.”
2:33 I’m catholic 🥲
Funny how I also raced across the sea, but against no one
no one:  not even the whoppa:  wilbur: *team reddit*
Sus
our champ wil thanks for throwing jack in the ocean 💪💪💪
i swear wilbur’s legs are so incredibly long- me and my 5’2 self could never 😭😭😭
Wilbur be looking like Dr. roboto when he was throwing jack off the boat.
jack wight link is not a cruise its a ferry
"drink more seawater"                                                             - Capt. Wilbur Soot, 2021

7:05 (time stamp)
Tubster the grubster
"Drink more sea water!" -Wilbur soot, a 24 year old man.
I see a lack of Tubboat jokes. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.

Jack: “name one thing I have lost” Tubbo: “past relationships” Nikki: “the love or host” Jack: *takes off goggles and wipes a tear than puts goggles back on and continues*
seeing Wilbur and Tubbo get hype to Freddy Mercury together at 6:39 gave me so much serotonin 😭
*Tubboat*
Niki’s death stare is so powerful

Tubbo: “I like boys”  HMMMMMMMMMMMMM wait a minute
Manifold: Hello guy i can't even ride boat Also Manifold: *Ride boat in minecraft*
The height difference between wilbur and tubbo is probably the difference when ranboo and him meet up
at 2:47 just beautiful
me: "I was impatient and looked at Wilbur's dms on sunid.Me that made me cry" then: "I should not have done that" I hope the situation changes
FINALLY SOME MORE NIKI AND WILBUR IRL CONTENT I LIVE FOR THEIR FRIENDSHIP

AHHH THE GRIND IS STRONGER NOW
This is by far my most favourite Manifold vlog yet
r/Boatrace my beloved
Daaaaaannngg Niki is a savage Then we have wilbur which is either  a. Really strong  or  b. Averagely strong and Jack is just really light
Jack: Lets bring something valuable item to us  Also Jack: *brings Nikki*  Nikki: IM A FUCKING ITEM?!!

"i have to go in the FUCKING WATER"  -Niki Nihachu -2021

Wilbur has asserted his dominance Jack it may be another loss
The way Wilbur so easily picked up Jack 😭
Wait is jack letting his hair grow?

“Is there any room in there?”  Tubbo: 𝗺𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗹𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗲𝘀
The only thing that I miss in this video is Tommy randomly showing up sabotaging the race
LETS FRICCCING GOOOOO
Wilbur just picking up Jack and just chucking him into the sea is one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time lmao
“Drink more sea water” Wilbur Soot, 2021

Jack manifold hair reveal
the amount of happy stims Wil carrying Jack and throwing him into the water gave me is so unbelievable
Loved the last clip-
Will telling tubbo to keep drinking the sea water reminded me of harry telling dumbledore to drink the water to get the necklace 😂😂
I'm for team reddit
The cutest moment in this video is when Jack stood up and Niki hugged him from the back. So wholesome
BDSN NIKI IS GRADUALLY SOUNDING MORE AND MORE BRITISH
We soon will be able to say “nice hair manifold”
10:12 rockabye baby on the tree top when the wind blows the cradle will rock when the bow breaks jack manifold will fall  Down will come jack  Cradle and all
Ok, is it just me or is wibur just cooler on a boat

Captain manifold
First it was the Sand and now the Seawater! No wonder Will had a child with a Fish
Jack: fucketh off  English teacher:🤤🤤
6:41 is the only acceptable way to react to queen songs

“Wow that’s a cool looking boy, I like boys.”
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU WHEN I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW OF THE FERRY!!!!! I WAS ON THE ST CLAIRE AND SOME RANDOM BOAT DID A LOOPTY LOOP!!!!!!!! BROOO

Tubbo: "Give me a good quote" Wilber: DRINK MORE SEA WATER
smoking is bad jack
Awe Will and Tubbo look great in their outfits
Ocean man
Beautiful
Anyone going to mention how tall Wilbur is?
6:39 my fav part
Is it just me or is this basically tommyinnit but his name is jack manifold
YESSSSS
I still find it very intresting that when anyone are saying to tubbo ,,Do (Insert random thing). He does it, complains about not wanting to do it, but still does it
Wilbur towers over Jack so much holy shit

He's racing across the sea for his whoppah 🥺🥺
The glasses look great on you, Will.
HELLO JACKEROO! HOW ARE YOU! I SEE U POSTED AND ME YET AGAIN IS STALKING UR YOUTUBE! (as a joke) HOPE U HAVE A LOVELY DAY! dunno why im using all caps but HEYYYY
9:28 Small
I understand why Jack kept his socks on but going into the ocean with socks on must’ve felt so cursed
Can boblove Nikki swore
Bring tommy
Jack, you lose the camera in the sea
this is sick
tubbo should have spun the boat right round like a record baby :’)
In jacks last couple videos with Nikki I’ve noticed and Pattern that they are always        together…….           Jack+Nikki ????????
"What is it with women and communication?"       I actually can't answer that - a woman
YES
Jack is growing hair
THE NOD OF WILBUT AFTER HE GOT JACK IN THE WATER😂😂😂
Yeaah a video at my birthday
I count 5 Freddie Mercury Jokes, though 1 is debatable.
anyone else swears :     niki swears : SHE JUST SWORE she just swore
AYOOO
Strongvur?
the pirate mod was so funny they made it irl
10:13 this might be the most cursed image involving jack manifold and wilbur soot ive ever seen
I forget how short jack is until i see him next to tommy or wilbur
Jack looks.so smal compared to Wilber lol
as a french fan i can tell that's definitely not french
Was waiting for Tubby to go "You spin me right roung right round like a record baby right round round round round-".
really nice video
I LOVE THIS
Im happy for you tubbo 4:31
10:13 Everyone: *talking about how tall will is and how jack just like shrunk*     my brain: *......titanbur......:)).....*
I’m early again
Captain Manifold >
Nice video jack
Can we just talk about how short tubbo is to wilbur and will be to ranboo
When you were a 15 minute drive away from your comfort streamers

I love this
I was Cracking up
yamaha is way better than mercury
I guess this really is *saline solution* 😏
10:17 "ThAt MaKes YOu loOk A BiT GAy boB"
Adorable thumbnail:D
Tubbo on a boat what will he do
Why the hell does niki sound more bri’ish
:D
DID YOU GET ⏃ WHOPPA
Alt Title: 4 Friends play fast and furious but with boats
Wilbur towering over Jack was just too funny
9:16  Jack: *trying to explain how it isn't it fault they lost* Niki: (looks into his soul) Jack: oh my god 😰
Did you get whoppa
NEW VLOG YES
Niki supremacy
0:59 TF2 soldier: GIVE ME YOUR HAT!

R/boat race
Tubbo and Wilbur really said SPEEEEEEED
😄😆
_Tubbo and Wil meeting for the first time irl_ Wil: Drink some seawater Tubbo B) Tubbo: Ok :D
“I like boys”  -Tubbo 2021
Jack manifold? No it's jack mani-drown
10:14 lmao the way wilbur just carry jack😂
woah
Tubbo and Wills dynamic is one of my favourites. A person who just spits bs out of his mouth constantly and a child who just takes it all as truth without asking any questions. It’s so great
Tubbo's gonna go home fucking blue from all sea water Wilbur told him to drink
“Drink more sea water”                                 - Wilbur 2021
"Drink more seawater"  Wilbur - 2021
When they wanted to throw niki in while she was still wearing that life jackets I was just stressing (those blow up when you hit the water and are quite expensive to ‘refill’)
cool
Jack getting thrown into the water made my day. And I’m sick and can’t really breathe so it made me very happy.
„Gesundheit“ means bless you 😂
Hiiii
it’s 1 am but i cant stop that jack manifold grind.
Guys tubboat is cannon
jack will sound like 100 gecs when they race in an airplane
Kinda scary that Wilbur just picked up Jack like it's nothing low key
"I like boys"  - Tubbo
[Jack] "I've lost things in the past" Dude you can't lost things in the future
Who else wants to see the full clip of tubbo and wil just vibin to freddie mercury?
😩👌
"I've got a very bad addiction now"              Me : to the fishy boat of some sort?          Clearly I'm not good at jokes
First it was sand now it’s seawater
Gee
If tommyinnit was here: *Constant screaming
Hmmmmm Banana          C       O        O        L
55 mins ago somewhat early
I WAS LITERALLY JUST THERE THIS MORNING AND I SAW SOME WEIRD PEOPLE WITH THOSE HATS ON SO I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOU LOL 😂
My sister is currently freaking out because we live on the iow(isle of wight) haha
are you staying on the iow? i live there and i’d love to meet you
Whahaahahah I love this
"I told you to bring a valuable item" "(...) What did you bring?" "Niki"   Aw.
y’all heard wilbur the fan art on reddit.
What in the world are you Sherlock homes with that pipe? 😂 😆 XD
jack: it's technically not my fault because i wasn't driving niki: gives death stare jack: 🏃
The absolute magnitude of fanfics this video fuelled is ungodly.
I'm gonna confiscate that-
Watching this when it's 55 minutes old.
No one:  Not even Wilbur:  Niki and Jack: re enacting Titanic
Pourtsmouth pogggg i love that place
Niki is becoming more British HSHSBSJSB
why did you go the day i decide not to go to the isle of wight we are going tomorow
Kinda early ig
AWWW WILBUR DEFENDED NIKI ❤️❤️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Bilbur Smooth
jack manifold has hair now WTF
Tubbo and Wilbur friendship in this video🤲💖
NAHHHH I WAS WAITING FOR JACK TO HUG EVERYONE AFTER BEING THROWN INTO THE SEA
7:28 Ultimate Flex right here.
half of this video is just jack jealous of tubbo and wilburs fun on the other boat
cool
‘Wherefore art thou Manifold’ Even Shakespeare is amazed of how accurate it is 🥰
Can we talk about Wilbur picking up Jack like nothing happened? I mean-
am i the only one who’s surprised they didnt drop the phones? maybe im just clumsy af so that something only i could do
54 minutes ago squad-
Ok, ok, hear me out, There is around 3.6 * 10^16 tons of salt in the ocean. So theoretically if Tubbo could somehow miraculously remove 1 ton of salt from the water per second, the ocean would be salt free in a bit more than a billion years.  Thanks for reading, do your part, eat salt. :)
Finally a vlog without TommyInnit.
I love how Wil just went "jack hold this" and proceeded to pick him up and toss him in the water that was great
7:12 v thech kicked  in bro
Its the fact that he threw Jack with SOCKS for me 😀🔨
I may be in church but I can’t stop that jack manifold grind
Wilbur
Jack: name one thing I lost  Tubbo: past relationships Nikki: love or host  Also Jack: :'(
"i brought an urn" "i brought niki"
Tubbo and Wilbur listening to Freddie Mercury
HIIIIII
THE ISLE OF WHITE IS SO CLOSE TO MEEE  1:47 I LIVE THERE I LIVE IN PORTSMOUTH AHHH  6:30 OMGGG

1:12 " It's french " Being french myself I'm pretty sure it isn't lmao XD
THIS IS MY FAVORITE VLOG
I see Wilbur? I click.
Freddie Mercury vibing :
"i like boys" Tubbo 2021
OMG WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THE BOAT HAD A SPEAKER SYSTEM
“It’s across the channel, it’s French!” “don’t touch me. 😤”
1:10 uhm thats dutch not French
- I would appreciate some communication - What is with women and valuing that? I-
Why is wilbur so intimidating
Don’t stop them now
That's was awesome, also holy shit Tubbo is so small next to Wilbur!
Ok but the fact that Wilbur just picks him up
wilbur  woke up and choose violence
It’s my birthday today
youtube keeps unsubscribing me but im back again !
44 minutes late
I’m on a roll with being a little early✨
I'm crying THEY WERE JUST LISTENING TO QUEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A RACE😭😭😭😭
I'm waiting to see three brits and a german ride near the ocean         (I live in the US lmao also /j)
I cant stop thinkimg of Tommy latest video about pirates
the titanic scene is funny because his name is jack and he got whacked into the ocean lmao
The reason Jack lost: Jack: What is it women and valuing that? 😜/j
Boaty boy
"You had a good run, Jack."  THIS WILL BE FAMOUS I'M CALLING IT NOW
Sea ppl
Jack: Name one thing I’ve lost. Tubbo: past relationships! Nikki: The Love or Host Jack: . . . *sobbing*
Is this pirates of the Caribbean?
jack manifol off boat
Will picking up jack terrifies me on how like willingly he is to just throw someone
Jack: Fucketh off Technoblade: you just became an orphan
Jack Manifold vlogs are something that I can watch whenever I’m down and I already know that they’re gonna cheer me up.  Some of the best content on YT
Dang wilbur really just threw Jack like a piece of meat 😂
I woke up to the notification “I raced across the ocean” and I thought I time traveled
loving this vlog style stuff you lot are doing
✨Clips of this vid that reminds me of the movie, Titanic ✨  7:07 - Jack and Rose first kiss (Instead, it’s Jack and Nihachu)  8:04 - The Small boat next to the Titanic (clip is in the beginning of the movie)  10:12 - Rose tossing her necklace into the ocean (Wilbur represents rose and Jack represents the necklace 🤣🤣🤣)  1:46 - Titanic docks off the pier  Edit: Think of the scene around them. Don’t focus on their conversation. If you focus, it will look like what it appears In the movie.
Will picking up Jack gives me so much serotonin.
wilbur: seawaters good for you me: u sure about that...
I LIVE IN PORTSMOUTH AND I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I SAW WHERE THEY WERE OMG
60k likes vs. 60 dislikes
I’m kinda early ig
Hello manifold
he go fast?
will @ jack: y e e t
can we talk about the height diffrence between wilbur and jack thats terrifying
Can we talk about how casually will threw jack in
Jack the popeye am I right laddis
Off to committee some water crimes
„You know what happened to Freddy Mercury?“  Yah, he popped off
TUBBO WILBUR MET UP WAAAAA
you guys made niki swear....
:3
I love your vidios
TUBBO MORE SEAWATER!
Wait,tubbo looks so fine in that outfit✨
Gesundheit i agree, thats french.
Wilbur picking up and throwing Jack was the funniest and happiest thing I’ve ever seen
I got a haircut
please JACK MANIFOLD GETTING LIFTED UP SO EASILY LIKE THAT IS SO FUNNY TO ME FOR SOME REASON--
It’s weird being able to see the fuzz on top of Jacks head
10:27-- will is my favorite of all time
Boy
Wilbur do be throwing Jack in the sea bridal style.
*Wherefore art thou Manifold*
Wilbur with his height and strength, being able to pick up Jack, that alone is capable of ending the Manifold grind...
JACK YOUR HAIR
Don't leave Tubo alone with Wilbur....
Jesus Wilbur is really strong- can I be strong like Wilbur qwq
How easily will picked up jack and threw him in the ocean was extremely funny to me
Niki and wilbur is getting kinda sus😏
THAT WAS SO NICE!!! I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS VIDEO
Meow :>
hey i love your content
The way Will throws Jack in the ocean is so funny for some reason
Hi
Yes boat.
Was Tommy at college again?
The Big Manifold got water'd
Yaaay
Not me being seasick xD
5:58 lmao tubbo gives jack a middle finger I can't 😂😂
He picked him u effortlessly. Wtf the tubbo flipping him off was so funny
I would pay a large amount of money to see them all vibing to dont stop me now on a boat
I see jack likes demonitisation
4:49 WILBUR AND NIKI
Tubbo: "I'm the captain 😌😌✨" Schlatt in the distance: "YOURE NOT THE CAPTAIN. Don't me have to bring out the Tubbo stick-"
Jack said the song was copyrighted, but I saw some other guy used the almost the whole song in a different video.  Then again, maybe it's because the video was made 4 years ago.
I DIED AT WHEREFORE ALT THOU MANIFOLD
jack manidrown
pls pin
Jack you are jesus
This entire video my brain was just remembering all the times i lost in boat racing with one of the organization 13 members in kingdom hearts.
why tho
Tubbo and Wilbur's boat towards the end there reminded me of the way my grandpa drove his speed boat Because he would drive it as fast as possible, with it bouncing up and down And he would drive over the wake of the boat (both of his own boat and others boats)  He would try to make my and my sibs as drenched in water as possible
10:13 man, i just wanna be held by wilbur like how he did with manifold
Yoooooooooooooooo pog
captain jack
It's just the way Wilbur just picked up Jack and tossed him like he was nothing
b o a t
JACK HAS HAIR?!
Wait I literally live here
poor tommy, I guee no kidw allowed
*intensely starts playing pirates of the caribbean music*
Ayup
did jack drop the camera at the end??
The is 2/10
thats fuckin fast
thats amazing
"Silence speaks volume"
YOOO NEW JACK VLOG
every night in my dream~~
Fucketh off is my favourite quote now
I want what wilbur and jack have
THEYRE ON THEIR WAY TO PICK UP THE REST OF THE SMP 😮
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE *TURN IT UP*
THAT LOOKS SK FUN, I WISH I WAS THERE😫
castaways we are castaways ahoy
Girl bosses
3:19 WILBUR IS FREAKING TALL
pog (that's all i have to say)
im also in a beach , a boat and in an island And u posted this video What a coincidence
Imagine being on the cruise and waving to a boat, not even realizing it was Tubbo and Wilbur Soot
YES WE SEE MY CUNTRY😽🔥💜💐🎉
Tubbo drinking ocean water was the whole mule bits situation all over again, okay but Wil carrying Jack-
Jack is turning into Tommy
Hearing Niki Swear be like: ⚪👄⚪✋
WILL'S SLUG DROP THO
TubBOAT
10:32 replay button :]
"drink more sea-water" -Wilbur Soot 2021
WILL CASUALLY PICKS UP JACK BAHAH
guys add this to the quote book: DRINK MORE SEAWATER
"Yours is the east as mine is the west." "Fucketh off."
I just knew this vlog because of a tik tok edit😭
The fact that Jack does crazier vlogs than Tommy, the guy who aggressively advertised his vlogs everywhere is funny
Wilbur: picks up jack Fanfictions writers: hehehe...
I'm sorry but this part 10:13 gives me so much Romeo and Juliet vibes for some reason 😂 (Just specifying I don't ship them I said this as a platonic joke)
I wish I was there...🥲😪😭
Captain tubbo is canon
Hi
I don't think Jack knows what starboard means, since he said "I'm walking up the starboard" Lmao
This is why im subed to jack
I never thought I'd see Wilbur Soot throw Jack Manifold into a body of water. What a good day.
3:19 HOLY SHIT His legs are fucking long😳
5:35 “drink more seawater.”     -Wilbur Soot, 2021
this entire video was so fucking funny
NOOOOO I'm latee
I’m still shocked that Wilbur can very simply pick up Jack
What was Niki's favourite moment?
Tubboat
Notification system: jackmanifoldTV uploaded a new video 1 minute ago Me: OH HAY ILL BE THE FIRST TO COMMENT!! 13k people: No.
hey jack did you get a whoppa
Yay nikki didnt have to be thrown into the water but jack did how strong can wilbur be he piggybacks gogy yeets nikki somewhere CARRIES JACK AND THROWS HIM WOW
Tubbo:"Wow... That's a cool looking buoy"  Also tubbo:"I like boys..."
bro i’m so excited for all of these vlogs to come out
Tommy really missed a lot, huh?
a
*Minecraft pirates flashback*  Tubbo: im a the captain
one of my favourite things i think i have ever watched tbh smiling the whole time
“Wow a boat!”
45 minutes ago😙
Wilbur and Jack the new Romeo and Juliette
holy shit I live on the Isle of white I wish I saw you guys when you where there
That's my comfort vlog 😩✨
Hello
will is an actual giant
manifold in the ocean
the whole video is actually just “solving life mysteries with wilbur soot on a boat”
I like boys
Poggers! I love Mr. Mercury!
_jack has hair 😳_
Hegemony
wilbur carrying jack bridal way is my new favorite scene
4:33 gaybbo
Wilbur : ships Niki and jack  jack : we dont know each other like that?! also jack and Niki 2 minutes later : Niki hugging jack for dear life busted!
THE WAY WILL SO EASILY JUST CHUCKED JACK INTO THE SEA SENT ME
At first i was like at the thumbnail who the heck that is? Wait is that wilbur-
Man, I want friends like this
Jack the capitan
will just scooping jack up like he weighed nothing is absolutely terrifying- but the fact that he did it so niki wouldn't get thrown in is the best
5:57 tubbo 🤣
jack untake smoking or i will unsubscribe
wills legs are built like toothpicks
Drinking the seawater will make you more dehydrated LOL
10:17 ngl, that would make great fanart
He got hair!?
well I'm glad covid is going down because we get stuff like this!
why is jack the driver when he can kill people😂
Niki bringing up the Love or Host...damn that’s cold.
Idk why but I really wanted that wilbur ends up in the Ocean, was really hoping it would happen xD
THEY WERE LESS THAN 5 MINS AWAY FROM MY HOUSE AND I DIDNT SEE THEM WTFFFF
wilbur: "quotey quote quote" jack: "quote? nah quote quote"
wil looks so proud of himself 😭
LMAO
the true great masterpiece of the seventh art 5:58 is tubbo flipping them off
the isle of wight is not france jack, its britain and it is across the solent not the channel
“I raced across the ocean”!  Me, after waking up a few minutes ago: Ah, it’s another one of those videos~  edit: oh wow, this did pretty well- thank you!~
I'm surprised tommy isn't in this vid lol
"Tubbo more sea water" Wilbur - 2021  Jack's Vlog
i smell the fanart of wilbur holding jack i can sense it.
Captain Jack Manifold has been dethroned
Bad video, 1/10 gakmaster didn't appear in the race

“Silence speaks Volumes”                         -Wilbur soot 2021

Tubbo and Wilbur listening Freddy Mercury is such a MoOd

Jack Manifish
the final shot of wilbur throwing jack in was UNREASONABLY pretty
Captain tubbo :D
S M O U T H
whats that outro soundtrack
wish I had friends like you guys
jack: "name one thing I've lost" niki: so you've chosen death
These vlogs are so entertaining to watch, I wish I had friends I could hang out with right now. Where art thou, my Manifolds?
Niki can be adorable and scary
Why Wilbur everytime he got the camera likes to zoom into people face?
My boy manifold started smoking for our entertainment... What a chad
Will is so like man i cant-
Ah yes, 10 minutes of everyone bullying jack. Quality content.
Tubbo : I like boys  Jschlatt : I’m so proud
I would LOVE to see more vlog content!
the fact that wilbur and tubbo are just vibing while jack is scheming against them is great
boats.
YES
i always wanna be on the sea and i feel so freaking jealous, all i wanna do is sing shanties
Great vid, Jack. I'm loving these IRL Vlogs you all are doing.
jack manifall into the ocean
Where’s Tommy :(
Jack look at tubbos and maybes tommys baby pictures. Also if you lost you would through niki off-
I swear Niki & Jack are the best duo ever, and you can't convince me they aren't
We want to be like Wilbur, I like he keeps his cool with a girl along with his friends ❤
Meanwhile tommy just stuck in the college
you’re telling me jack, tubbo, nikki and wilbur visited my city and i didn’t even know about it? 😐
WOPPA in the ocean        what you know about rolling down in the deep
You can see Schlatt rowing 🚣‍♂️ out there somewhere
Wilbur just fucking yeeted him off the boat
me seeing them from the isle of wight
Mans were really jamming to Freddie Mercury on a boat in a race
wait till he finds out showering exists
wilbur throwing jack into the ocean was bound to happen.
I’m late 😭
Can't Wilbur just be in all future blogs?
Where is captain puffy!?
Jack: "name one thing I've lost" Niki: "the love or host"
I will use "fucketh off" from now on all the time
PogChamp
yooooo
did this man say he stopped smoking? y u even smoking at the age of 18
My mom came in and asked what I was laughing at. I said something along the lines of “Wilbur threw Jack Manifold overboard cause he lost.” She left after that…
i love this content sm
Jack's hair-
Wilbur picked Jack  ✨flawlessly✨
_ITS 3AM MY MOM TOLD ME TO SLEEP BUT I GOTTA WATCH THIS_ *2:34** LMAO BUT IMA CATHOLIC* _6:45__ the titanic_
That was awesome :D
DAMN WILBUR
This is the best vlog EVER
Fucketh off, I'm wheezing
Wills *Gesundheit* was my Highlight :D so cool
That was awesome :D
LEL
“I even took up smoking”  Now that is dedication
E
The great shot of Tubbos finger flipping off Jack Manifold
7:03 that's a whole new definition of "I'll never let you go, Jack" from Titanic
I LOVED THIS VLOG, SO MUCH.SUBSCRIBED!
J-"did you bring your valuable item?" T-"yeah, I brought a family heirloom" J-"you know if you lose you have to throw that in the sea" T-"poor grandma. what did you bring?" J-"I brought Niki" you... y-you what?
Lol it's night in our world here ._. --_-- oh come on I wanna go out side but I can't go out side cuz there some Lot's of ghost here --_-- ._.
Seeing Wilbur just pick up Jack and throw him off is really funny and also is just a power move.... so now the question is, is Jack just light or is Wilbur strong?
TO me the funniest part was just Wilbur holding jack like a baby
"drink more seawater"  never have i been more inspired.
they're living the dream
lil baby man
Jackmanifall into water *weeezzzz*😂😂 Will Wilbur find his love, the fish today..who knows
Caption manifold
captain wilbur is the funniest but ever
“fucketh off” is my new catchphrase
I love how wilbur keeps on telling tubbo to drink sea water
Love a Jack Manifold video on my birthday :)
34 minutes ago and the front i alredy
Sees Wilbur tower over jack at the end My brain: jack manismall
new comfort video: ☑️
Yes
Jack and Nikki make the best team, Wilbur and Tubbo make the best duo singing team
anybody know what the song that starts a t 6:50 is called?
Jack manifold took up smoking:)
Ah yes "France"
Fun fact! "Wherefore" actually means "why", not "where"; Juliet is bemoaning that Romeo had to be a Montague. This is the same monologue as "a rose by any other name would smell as sweet", because she's trying to convince him to overlook their families' feud, and allow one of them to renounce their name so they can be together
THE END OMG PAHAHAHHA
Jackmanidrown
Captain Will, Jack and Tubbo
This video is a masterpiece
i think jack getting flung might be my favourite thing ever
NIKKI MY BELOVED
The fact that Niki is 5'7 and is taller than Jack makes my day better.
It doesn't taste like potassium it tastes like sodium because the periodic table song says neon to light up your signs, SODIUM FOR SALTY TIMES
*Wherefore art thou, Manifold!?*  Ah yes, Classic.
Bro the end..... so satisfying /j      At least it wasn't Niki My Beloved..... Jack don't worry u are my beloved too <3
The CAPtain, that’s why tubbo got 2 caps
youre the best
its like the tommyinnit minecraft pirate video but real life
His hair…
AND YET ANOTHER BANGER VLOG
When will picked Jack up it looked like he was carrying a baby LMAOO
THE BEST VIDEO EVER LOVED IT SO MUCH
Ayyyy earlyyy
Captain Puffy?  Nah its Captain Jack Manifold now!
Early
The ‘having a good time’ song was just salt on the wound
I love how at the end will just casually just picked jack/you up XD
“Drink more sea water” Wilbur Soot, 2021
God we love the vlogs man keep it up!
i think mr manifold liked the sea
Why didn't I get a notification...
The people who wanted to see niki in the water: (sad sexn't noises)
what was that outro music pleas drop a link
Sadly from the looks of it tubbo is now gay.
I love this. I love this to pieces. Mannn that was good! (Loving the Wilbur content. Thanks for being the legend Will!)
10:18 PLEASE WILBUR LOOKS LIKE A PROUD DAD AND JACK IS HIS SON LMFAO
SUCH A SICK VIDEO !!
I came at the speed of my mom's slipper to my face after she finds out my exam scores.
Wilbera and jackulet
I think it’s funny that Niki, Will’s ex, hugged back in front of Will
always drink sea water
Okay but tubbo looks like a pixar main character
Next it’s who can fly to space first  Cold War part II
im on the back of the boat
Jack:I’ve never lost anything in my life Niki:love or host Jack:*wipes up tears*
That pipe gave me anxiety
Wilbur and tubbo's friendship is priceless
I LOVED THIS VLOG ((:
I wonder how jack felt in the last twenty seconds of the video
My grandfather knows how to drive a boat and he was even the captain of one of the most famous ships in my city (the Bell of Louisville) for a little while He also owns two boats He's teaching me how to drive them
Did they title this wrong? It should say ‘everyone bullying Jack for 10 minutes straight’.
Jack got yeeted for the bit, that's commitment right there! I can respect that
Tubbo: "I'm the Captain." Me: *flashbacks to Tommy's pirate video* My mind: oh no-
Wilbur’s leg is so freakin long oh my god—
jack  you are not in love with him but you are in love with her
Tubbo is actually the Ass. Captain
But did he get the WHOPPA?
By far his best video
Seeing Wilbur throw jack in the water is the best thing I've seen In awhile. It's also a reminder that no matter how childish he acts sometimes he is a 6'5 grown man.
holy shit the serotonin this video gave is just insane. the camera editing along with the drone's was very neat! <3
I can't resist to look away niki's beauty
Hi Will!-tubbo
tubbo looks cool in a caption outfit
Just can’t stop the jack manigrind!!
Yes Wilbur throw him
I’m at the end of the video looking at moist manifold
If pirates we're on steroids
Now these are content creators.
Drink more seawater   -Wilbur Soot
Nice minecraft shaders any links
the "i like boys" made me wheeze shdghsds
they've remade the minecraft pirate video irl this is incredible
I subscribed for Jack’s smoking addiction
The size difference between Wilbur an jack it BIG 🤣
Jack really thought we wouldn’t notice that he’s actually a pirate that has committed many war crimes…
This made my fucking day I swear
POGH!!
Tubbo whenever a boat is involved : I'm the captain  Literally everyone else : You're not the captain, Tubbo.
wilbur was so effortlessly amazing in this wtf?
It’s the pirate mod in real life
He has replay mod 2:30
**Pirates of the caribbean music intensifies on wilbur and tubbo’s boat**
OMG IM IN PORTSMOUTH
10:13 me just thinking of how gay that looked of wilbur just picking jack up-
im sad cause i was legit right where they were that for the whole week and i didn't see them.        so sad
It's 12 in here Jack Manifold 😟
Jack’s hair is growing out and it’s scaring me it’s like entering a new jack manifold era
god Wilbur is a giant
“I would appreciate some, like, communication?”  *What is it with women and valuing that?*
You should do a vlog at Blackgang Chine or Robin Hill of you ever go over to the Isle of Wight again, they're great fun!
AM I EARLY!?!?!
greg
go on a cruise
Personally I think Jack is extremely underrated. He is my favorite content creator.
these vlogs are the best thing in the whole year
“Fucketh off” true poetry
Captain Manifold
JACK MANIFOLD HAS HAIIIIRRRR
https://youtu.be/FpFztrJbksg
the ending music was a straight vibe

Happy Pride Month xD This was a wild trip
Jack Manifold did in fact lose his first canon life to Wilbur Soot, this is accurate
THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD VLOG
Tubbo: I like bouys (boys)  ITS COMFIMED TUBBO IS GAY

WILL PICKING UP JAKC SHAHSH
Will just did the biggest alpha male move there Tommy would be impressed and Phil would be proud 😂
He's jack sparrow

Ice is nice
“fucketh off” shakespeare would be proud
I wheeze when wilbur said "we're like romeo and juliet" to jack
"Shes a stowaway" ... CaStaWaYs, wE aRe cAsTawaYs
DAYYYUUUMM Wilbur is strong!!!!
Jack is so smol will lifted him like he was nothing
YEAHHHH
The Freddie Mercury references were top tier
Embracing myself for comments about Captain’s Call
6:23 I came to watch the video for my favorite part, they cropped it out. I'm sad.
Jack: "i haven't lost anything in the past!" Jack literally 5 seconds later: "i have lost somethings in the past"
VERY COOL BIG MAN, BANGER VIDEO! MY FAVOURITE PART IS WHERE THE MANIFOLD GETS THROWN INTO THE WATER. VERY HUMOROUS INDEED! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
We sailing bois
I really wish I had friends to do this with, it looks like so much fun
0:53 wow Jack said that Niki is an object /j
imagine you’re on a cruise and you just see four massively popular children that stream on twitch just zoom past you yelling and waving
british people speaking shakespearean english is the best
Ive been hearing mario music during the video
I love how will just picks up jack bridal style like it's nothing
Captain Jack
10:12 Jack looks so tiny lmfao
Boaty McBoatrace
Niki sounds so british in this video.
“woah, that’s a cool looking buoy.. i like boys!” -tubbo, 2021
happy Father’s Day Phil
5:33 we know tubbo we know
fitting for 1st day of summer and fathers day.
Setup, rising action, climax & resolution:
Tubbo: What did you bring to throw? Jack: I brought Wilbur and Niki Me: *looks over at cat*
the fact that i'm listening to captain's call by derivakat rn-
oh how theyve grown up who once were minecraft ytbers//streamers are now sailing the huge ocean of ✨france✨
why did jack look like an actual 70’s captain
the best captain ive ever seen my entire life
Jack looks like a stereotypical ass. captain-
ayo i know that placeeeeee!!!
Drink more seawater kids. Drink more seawater...
F U C K E T H  O F F 😌✨
"Today, I am the captain"  "Okay what are the orders will you give us today captain"
NIKI NIHACHU
Jack actually does look like a captain
i love how Wilbur was just like “nope” and threw Jack in
Captain Jack Sparrow
32 mins🤙
Wilbur saying "gesundheit" and jack thinks its french, my german heart is crying
the way that none of them can drive a boat but i’m literally ten years younger than wilbur and can legally drive a boat 🙂
this was really funny!!
Jackmanifalloffboat
I suggest you go rowing but like in proper rowing boats like the really thin ones with out bored riggers
That thumbnail looks like a happy family picture ngl
How Wilbur just picked Jack up so easily and chucked him in the water terrifies me
I would have been just like tubbo and willbur the entire time 😭😭
jack manifold you're so cool
TUBBO HOLDING UP THE MIDDLE FINGER LMFAO
NO BEACUSE I LIVE IN PORTSMOUTH ANF I HAD A CHANCE TO MEET THHEM CJSNC S
*poor grandma*
would have been more hilarious if they were both thrown in the water
jack manidrown </3
I didn't know that Wilbur could carry Jack
Can we take a moment to notice how good jacks hair looks already?
OMG I WAS LITERALLY AT THAT CASTLE
Will just picked him up and threw him in, effortlessly. Im terrified
Tommy’s mc pirate mod in real life! Lmao
OHHH
YAY ITS SCOOBY DOO
I love your content you should have more subscribers
captain jack manifold
"Drink more seawater" - Wilbur Soot 2021
YAY ITS SCOOBY DOO
Impressive
“ fucketh off “  i’ll be using this
I LOVE THIS
30 minutes ago and there's already 150k views
I can't believe Jack didn't use his biggest pun.  He could have said "I am Jack Sparrow"... Would've been so cool.          Is it only me?
Jack: name on thing I have lost Niki: love or host Tubbo: past relationships
LMAO I LIKE HOW TOMMY AND WILBUR DONT LIKE BEING TOUCHED BUT THEY WOULD TOUCH EACH OTHER
honestly i wish tubbo would've brought benson
JackManiDROWN!
WOOO GOOD VID LMFAO
I cant belive I've been to a place that the manifold has omg
jackmanicaptain
Jesus fuck this video just got spammed with bots
the fact that jack aint lying that he will grow his hair....ayeeeee
Wilbur and Tubbo just jamming it away to "Don't Stop Me Now" is definitely my favorite thing in the video
its so crazy to see jacks hair growing out im so not used to it lol
WHY did i just realize the height difference between Niki and Wilbur 💀
BRO THAT WAS SO FUCKING FUNNY
THAT WAS A FUN VLOG
Captain manifold sailing to the slime island to meet slimeciccle so both of them could defeat slmccl
Makes me want to play Mario sunshine ☀️
The sheer fact that Wilbur can pick up Jack scares me
The fact that Will can actually pick up Jack is terrifying
The fanart is wilbur letting it rip with the "wrong aerodynamics".
Can someone, literally anyone, tell me if wilbur and niki are dating?
niki is the captain no doubt, she is drop dead gorgeous, she curses like a captain, she looks like a captain, shes a frikin savage at that, do i need to explain further
this is so great good job jack manifold
wilbur being the oldest and the tallest and tubbo being the youngest and the shortest fits well
Beautiful
Fun fact: The weird black bird is actually called a Shag
SHEEEEEEESH
R.I.P to Jack man lmao
Jack and Niki seem in love
Is tubbo gay? Like he makes jokes like that a lot is he hinting towards something I mean there’s absolutely nothing wrong if he is I’m just wondering?
Who else had loved the blogs so much recently
Is it me or is Nikki's accent more British?
AYO
"Name one thing I've lost" Niki: *love or host*  Me: Danggggggg
wilbur is so large.
They’re going so fast! How did that happen??  Tubbo and Wilbur: *The power of Freddie Mercury.*
I love how in the start jack is just smoking a cigarette
i thought being thrown in was a bit....
Boat
this vlog was genuinely so high in production and every little detail was really entertaining i seriously loved it
wherefore art thou manifold
sea
I've been boating ever since I was born.  We've gone on boat rides that last all day, and we put tubes behind the boat a lot, too.  I can't tell you how many times I've been thrown in the drink.  This was really funny yo watch!  You'd be a great captain, Jack, but I'm afraid your crew would start a mutiny against you!
WILBUR CARRYING JACK AND THROWING HIM IN THE WATER 🙏👏 YEP

JACK WITH HAIR LOOKS ILLEGAL
I called it on Wilburs post that you went sailing
Is it me or is Jacks hair growing

5:40 first telling Phil to eat sand and now telling tubbo to drink sea water? What’s next, telling Tommy to chew shells?
“We will singlehandedly desalinate the sea.”  *I think that’s going in the quote book.*
POMPEY!

4:29 "wow! That's a cool looking buoy! I like boys!" -Tubbo The shippers will remember that
These guys make everything entertaining
Can we just acknowledge for a second how strong Wilbur is
4:50 Shippers be like: WIlbuR x nIHAchU cOnfiRMed?!1!!!11
This has infact been added to my "HAPPY NOISES" playlist and ill be re watching this for so long
ayayayyaya      o
Watching people get thrown in the water so effortlessly is pure comedy.
Will just picking up jack while also being a foot taller is so funny to me
i like how tubbo thinks hes a captain in this video and tommys video lmao
the ease with which Will picks Jack up and chucks him into the water is scary...
LETS GOOOO
OK BUT WILBUR FREAKING HOLDING JACK IM THE BRIDAL POSITION??? EXCUSE ME WHAT??    Idk why that so funny to me
KING MANIFOLD I AM EARLY
AYO WAGWAN JACK. YOUR CREPS LOOKIN KINDA DEAD STYLL. THEY ALSO LOOK MY SIZE ASWELL DRILLA. BUST ME THEM CREPS RIGHT NOW G

The way Wilbur can effortlessly carry Jack
BRO IM EARLY!
Jack Manifold is by far: the funniest man alive
Im sorry, i had to go with team reddit, because i am a reddit addict
GREAT VLOG, MR.MANIFOLD!
I like how small everyone is compared to wilbur and how it seemed so easy for him to lift up jack lmao
i was expecting technoblade to tail them with a wither with him
I wouldn’t be surprised that jack might get lost in the Sea? Lake? Ocean?
“Name things I’ve lost” “The love or host” “Past relationships” *Hair*
Jack looks like a drag queen de-dragged, in the best way.
the height difference between Tubbo and Will is terrifying lmao
Wilber x niki
subscribe to pay for jacks lung cancer bills
Fastest 10 mins of my life, but I enjoyed it a lot
The way Wilbur picked up Jack had me dying
poooooooooog
Jackmani-fall in water💦💧
in this video team rocket desperately tries to gain the lead against reddit users in a boat race
ahhh wilbur my favorite sailsman
🎃
I loved the moment wilbur picked jack up. He looked like a damsel in distress 😂
I mean cool idea
JACK HAS HAIR OH MY GOD
niki is slowly becoming more and more british, its the manifold influence
Glorious boats ngl
Just love the Wilbur and tubbo jam session here
jack: "today im the captain" the only thing he is is that hes a popular bald (not for long bald) influencer
They are all maturing into Tommy , like somehow
Wilbur really said "no".

I actually gasped when Nikki swore, i was like: OMG WHAAAAT
Jack Manifold:"Fucketh off"  I'm dead🤣🤣

Tubbo: I like boys! That's why your in a relationship with ranboo ^^
Wilbur is huge compared to Jack lol
this is definitely going in the serotonin playlist thank you so much jack manifold  (you getting thrown in the water was a pretty big part of it <3)
Wilbur:Throws Jack like nothing*🤣
Tubbo look's soo happy ^^
Jack your hair is already growing…
Wilbur used that reverse card and said 'no you get thrown into the ocean' 😂
Oh my God This is AMAZINGGGGGGGGGG
Willbur be like ________ a stick
the vibes here are immaculate. my face hurts from smiling lol
“Give us some Tubbo narration” “Wow, that’s a cool looking buoy! I like boys!” **Inserts laughing**
That second shot of Jack getting tossed into the water is pure gold
Hearing niki swear I’d weird
niki's so perfect 😭
YO JACKS GROWING HAIR
Moral of the story: sea water is very good for you.
Its 1 am and i was waiting for a upload and here it is :D Great video as always ❤
Welcome to my city 🙂 (Portsmouth)
In our country it's 12:51 am and I'm watching this
tommy rn :   :')
As someone from the isle it’s nice to felt seen, not many realise we are indeed a part of England due to our small size on the map
Earlyyyy
HELLO CAPTAIN JACK🌊🚢⛵🚣‍♀️⛴
3:48 Wilbur wants to “desalinate the sea”?? What happened to “Saline Solution to all your problems”?? I though you were a fan of saline
Why us there so many bots? 😰😰😰
MY GOD this looked like so much fun!!! Truly a great vlog Jack!
this was absolutely hilarious
7:05 *Yes* 10:11 *yEs* Will is soo strong-
Tubbo and Wilbur in the beginning of the video: “I am the captain now” meme
Where is Tommy?!?!! 🤓
Am i allowed to make clips? Because i just made 5 clips of this
"They're speaking french"
That lookes so fun
Ik it's a bit stretched out but the loser was to throw something they care about into the ocean...either Jack loves himself or Jack cares about how Wilbur feels about him 🤔
this is just 10 minutes of jack getting bullied
i totally didn't screenshot wilbur holding jack
I was NOT expecting the ending to be honest - I bet that go pro is gone tho huh
Captain tubbo
No one: Wilbur: *Yeets Jack off the boat*
Wish Tommy was there too
I'm Joining The Dream SMP See You Soon Jack!
10:14 the way they look into each others eyes. I want that <3

He started smoking, then he got thrown into the sea... just subscribe already.

Lovely Highlighted Quotes: 2:59 4:30 4:55 5:34 6:28 10:05
Poor tommy...
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT JACK'S HAIR!??!
I'm having flashbacks to Tommy's pirate video with all this captain talk-   Who brought the Tubbo stick?
wilbur picking up jack was rlly an experience
"fucketh off" i died-
Egg
Woppah
You must love super Mario sunshine
Schlatt: Tubbo you're not the captain! Jack Manifold: Tubbo you're not the captain!  ah yes.
Will and Niki have such a wholesome friendship(not shipping)  I miss them 🥺
YOOOO
are we going to ignore how wilbur carried jack in one swoop
5:04 I’m dead
GREAT VLOG JACK MANIFOLD
damn i couldnt stop laughing after jack got thrown in, and i dont laugh at many things
all i do is live in fear of wilbur soot
ayoo im early
Tubbo and Wilbur have such an underrated dynamic and this video proves it. I love their interactions.
Why nikis face turned into red 👀
10:00 I'm saving this
good video, i enjoyed.
Once again my recommendation is faster than my notifications
Tubbo and Wilbur are literally one of my favorite duos. Not only are they super funny, the height difference never fails to make me laugh XD
This. Is. Amazing.
Jack is person number two that Wilbur has just picked up with no issue, that is genuinely terrifying to me. This video was great and I loved it a lot
Mans upgraded from sand eating to seawater drinking-
7:06 RARE FOOTAGE OF JACK AND ROSE IN THE TITANIC‼️😱😱 *REAL* *NOT FAKE*
Happy Pride everyone, Tubbo likes Bouys
ajck manifold looks like popeye
These meetups are just everything <3
Wilbur: god rest their souls...   Tubbo: DiD tHeY dIe??
6:38 MY FAV PART
tubbo: "im the captain" looks like tubbo hasnt left his pirate arc from tommy's mod videos
1:09 for people who dont know what Gesundheit means it means bless you or health sorry if its wrong :D
jack manifold really has hair omg
wilbur and tubbo singing on a boat is a complete vibe
Wilburs out fit looks so nice there’s not bright colours and what do I see bright orange socks awesome
i was like nooo you cant throw off nikii
GHAT WAS INCREDIBLE
I laughed out loud when Tubbo said 'poor grandma.' I'm in a car. With all of my family. AH-
Wilbur: “listening to queen” Me: I see you’re a man with good music taste as well
Willbur: it's there that they planned the executions for all the wrongdoers all the Catholics    Me a Catholic: 👁️👄👁️💧
That was such a fun video to watch ,well done jack manifold 👏
On my birthday :0 YESSSS
Watching them having fun with each other makes me realize how lonely i am 😀🙂😟😰😭😭😭😭
I was confused of why poor Tommy wasn't there🥺 I think he would of had fun
Today on: we can’t leave Wilbur alone with tubbo because he WILL subject the boy to atrocities
Jack: Niki has to be thrown into the water.  wilbur: *And i took that personally*
I just got the sailor hat in stardew valley so my character really looks like jack AHAHAH
i really thought wilbur woudlve like fireman carried him
"Drink more seawater" EAT SAND AND SLURP IT DOWN WITH SEAWATER
Wilbur: we’re talking about scooby-doo Jack: i don’t care   *Jack where is your culture?*
Niki grabbing Jack at 7:05 was so cute!! They are one of the best duos!! <3
I love how Wilbur threw Jack in the ocean without hesitation
1:08 Gesundheit
Wilbur and Niki: "Gesundheit." Jack: "They're not speaking English, that's french."
6:35
“Manifold, Manifold, where for art thou, Manifold” “Fucketh off, dear Soot and refuse thy race. And if thou wilt not, be but throwneth into the fucking sea”
This reminders me the Minecraft vid that Tubo found a boat and he went crazy
IM EARLY    I had to sleep(its 12: 52 rn) cuz i have zoom call tommorow at 7:00AM, but i cant stop that manifold grind it aint stop          Your so rich lol

Wilbur picked Jack like nothing up😫✋🏻🥲

He is not mean jack by Juliet he means Niki🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Was about to film, but no, Jack Manifold is here.
Manifold lost the 100k of gift cards to tubbo

Wilbur making Turbo drink sea water reminds me of the Mule Bits
They did the TITANIC thing that i mentioned on the last video!! 🌊

wilbur is fucking MASSIVE
from them reinacting Romeo and Juliet to Will princess-carrying Jack into the sea, they really had a whole lovers-to-enemies arc
Why is Nikki so scary when angry 0.0
can we just appreciate the cinematography like there are drones and all which is cool
awesome work as always, jack manifold
I love how all the Jack Manifold vlogs are just him getting bullied for about 10 minutes
Nice video

⟟ love this
The joy in Jack’s voice at 7:34 only to find out minutes later that they were not only being lapped but also losing with -style points
Tubbo with a captain outfit and shorts is just so adorable 🥺
No one talking about the hair…?
Woah this is so cool
I’m sorry but I just tried to persuade my older sibling to agree to getting the food I want by showing them a picture of jack and then saying “maybe I can persuade you with the power of the manifold” and they looked like they wanted to hit me.
Where'd the tripod go?
What happened to the hat i wonder?
Woah- 20 minutes early? 😩😩😩
20 MINUTES AGO MY RECORD OMG
Jacks videos are getting so good
Big up, actually from the isle of wight

I already know tubbo saying "I like boys" is going to be taken out of context so bad by dumbass people
So no one's talking about how wilbur just effortlessly threw Jack into the ocean?
“No one likes a show off, captain” LMAO
Wilbur threw Jack instead of Niki... I'm so happy rn
Tubbo: *I like boys* 4:30

No one is gonna talk about why can Wilbur carry him ok

ARE WE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WILBUR PICKED JACK UP SO EASILY-
Jack: Name 1 thing I've lost Niachu: The love or host Lol that cracked me up
Hello Jack✌️❤️
Imagine watching withem with 70k people
DUO MOMENT
Early to a jack manifold video… I think so
Manidrown
“hey girl, i am in the water”
THEY WERE IN HAMPSHIRE AND I DIDN’T KNOW. WHAT IS HAPPENING
HOW DID WIL JUST PICK HIM UP LIKE THAT WHAT
Jack Mani-drown
Ok
“Drink more seawater.”          -Wilbur Soot
Wilbur just throwing Jack in though 😂
hihi
Strongbur
I lost it with the Freddie Mercury music
As someone who is deathly afraid of water, when I tell you I SCREAMED when Wilbur threw Jack I mean it.
wilbur really singlehandedly threw jack into the water bride style
Captain Jack
rose and jack look different here
Niki and Jack are the best duo
You can't stop the captain manifold grind
Jack may smoke to be to be the captain he'll never but he can't stop that jackmanifold grind
I LIVE ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT OH MY GOD
Banger video. Very funny

I forget how big wilbur is
I used to live in Portsmouth! :O

"I like boys"

Jack Manifolds!
This awesome! Niki and Jack best duo until Niki had to be thrown in the ocean.   Good thing it was Jack that was thrown. Not my queen.
If wilbur is the captain, tubbo is the first mate and jack is scrubbing the deck, then what is Niki
Captain Jack
I had so much fun watching this omg
Watching this while at the beach
I loved Wilbur just lifting Jack like a child LOLOLOL
THIS WAS ACTUALLY AND POSSIBLY THE BEST VLOG YET

wilbur making tubbo drink sea water reminds me of the mule bits bit 💀
I’m technically supposed to be working on an essay but this was worth it

Jackmanidrown
3:21 Artists you know what to do.
Imagine being on cruise and seeing your favourite youtubers speed by in boat.

Why do I like this video so much
Wilbur-  You don't have to manipulate kids in every video /lh
Jack ManiDrown

wilbur literally has the ability to chuck a grown man into the english channel... what the fuck

THE WAY WILBUR JUST THREW JACK IN AHAH
I don't know why, these people are so fucking funny- They could legit do nothing, and managed to make me smile.

Wilbur throwing jack into the water is the funniest thing to me. The way jack was like ‘I don’t think the bit is that funny’. Wilbur really said yeet 😂
So jack is a raging nicotine addict now?

the slowmo of jack being thrown in at the end is both beautiful and hilarious 😭😭
wilbur threw him like a baby i still cant stop laughing with that image in my head
3:04 niki is a savage lmao
Ok nobody gonna talk about the height difference of Jack and Wilbur 😂
When they started singing Freddie Mercury, I lost it

Jack and Niki recreating the titanic at 7:06 is officially my favourite duo moment
THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD VLOG I LIKED IT VERY MUCH
MI REY
NOT JACK BEING TROWN INTO WATER IM WHEEZING

subscribing since jack had to endure both lung cancer and hypothermia in this video
me: "I was impatient and looked at Wilbur's dms on sunid.Me that made me cry" later: "I should not have done that" I hope the situation changes

“F**keth off”   —Jackmanifold 2021
I went as early as I could get but when I checked 2.1k Already went FIRSt
I manifested a vlog and it just appeared, it’s the perks of the manifold grind
what you know about rollin down in the deep when your brain goes numb you can call that mental freeze
The love or host
Fun fact: bird saliva is actually a popular delicacy! Another one: chocolate supplies are running out :( Okay I’ve said this one in the past, but people thought it was cool so did you know that too much nutmeg can actually get you high? Another chocolate one: chocolate is actually just as healthy as fruit is! Yet another chocolate one (last one I promise lol): chocolate gives you a chemical which scientifically makes you happier for a short amount of time!
Captain  J. Manifold
Tubbo is so small by the wilbur haha i love they
I too like boys tubbo
oh no poor grandma...
Jack: "whats one thing ive lost Tubbo: "Past relationships" Niki:"Love or host" they really said that lmao    Why tf does this have like
Wait was this the vlog that tubbo vlogged it sideways lol?
Wilbur's long lanky legs. That's it.
Captain jack 💪🏻

I’m suppose to be attending my moms funeral but.. CANT STOP THAT MANIFOLD GRIND
The fact that Jack is only 20 months older than Tubbo is terrifying. Jack's out here looking 20 and Tubbo looks like he's 15 lol. Puberty sure works in mysterious ways lol. I will never get over how different they look
