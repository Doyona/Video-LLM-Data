The start of a disaster 😭
Beautiful lady
I think people - including Truss and Kwartang - just got used to the idea the government could pay for everything like they did in covid, forgetting that it was sourced from borrowed money.
Funny that Liz Truss lists “standing up against Russian aggression” as one of Johnson’s achievements. Just over two years on and she shills for a President who is seeking appeasement to end the war in Ukraine.
Looking back at it, she never did any of this and only lasted a couple of months. There will be one thing I will remember though, Borris was a character, his hair legendary, and his bicycle. Probably not what happened in Russia though.
Just unbelievable thanks to Liz my mortgage is up a grand a month forcing me to work a additional 60 hours a month.If I’m sick or can’t work if I miss one payment I’m out homeless.I CANNOT HIDE BEHIND WEALTH TELL PEOPLE TO CEASE AND DESIST.
🌍❤️
😆😂🤣
Gone with the wind
The last prime minister to say to form a government in the name of Queen Elizabeth 🥲
I decided to come back to watch this after Kier got elected as PM and after watching Liz get voted out of her own seat! 🤣  It's amazing how drastically certain things can change in such a short time period...lol  She will now(hopefully) remain irrelevant into the future - other than the fact she crashed our economy overnight and was beaten by a lettuce in longevity as PM :D
Watching after Keir made office button
Hi from 2024 💀💀💀
Never trust anyone who talks out the side of her face. If ever I met her I'd have no hesitation in straightening it out for her. She is a tnuc.
You fuked up, shortest PM reign in UK history!
Hello ma'am Liz Truss,❤
Put simply - she did manage to achieve f@ck all in the shortest time possible - impressive...
WHO'S DELIVA  🤯🤯🤯
59 DAYS OF DETERMINATION ..  WHAT DID SHE ""DELIVER"" SHE USES THAT WORD ALOT  🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
FUNNY THEY SAID CUT TAX WHEN EVERYTHING BECAME MORE EXPENSIVE  (ALONGSIDE ULEZ AND TAX FUNDED HOTELS 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
A shambles of a woman, complete failure and fraud..
Schnell jrmand anderes an pult
Lange worte wenig getan jahrestückblik dave hat mehr geschafft

Gone for good.  And so has Liz Truss.
I love you Liz Truss ❤😍😍😍
you have a bold plan but you have no time lady

Nobody will believe this until it's correct, so I'll type it out here now so that it's on record.   In around 2026, Starmer & Reeves will be getting desperate. The economy will be on its very knees, even more so than it is currently.   They'll deliberate in private for months, and one morning - possibly at Labour conference 2026, Starmer will reveal his new & exciting 'economic plan.'   It'll be Trussenomics.   Don't be surprised when it happens. Reeves just plagiarized entire articles for a recent book of hers. So it's already in her character.  Starmer is a prolific liar, so it's in his, too.   I was right about the war in Iraq being wrong, I was right about lockdown being wrong....and I'm going to be right on this one.   I look forward to the replies in 2026.
Can we have her back please?
Top 3 countries by intelligence :  3th: England.  2th: England.  1th: Wales.
Guarantee if she was still pm we woukd be in full scale war with Russia by now she was so committed to go to war with Russia thank heavens god took her out of the picture

Book : Britannia Unchained: 2012  Joint Authors : Liz Truss, Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab & Chris Skidmore.  Quote   ‘....... the British are amongst the worst idlers in the world’.....
Bla bla bla, bla bla bla ......the failure of the year
Liz Truss: Boris, if you think you tanked the economy with Brexit; hold my beer.
Meanwhile... two months later...
She will save us all. Wake up people. They are all the same puppets

Hilarious.
Congratula - oh...

Interpreting is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo difficult help
AHH way back in time at the beginning of Truss's reign... So long ago there was a monarch on the throne that outlasted 15 Prime Minister's.... And now a Prime Minister finding hard to outlast a friggin choc ice!
Someone will have tears walking out of office.
Now l was on the verge a giving up...Along came Truss and really messed things up....Truss believes she can fly   Truss believes she can touch the  sky . Her PMQs is laughable,  she pulls the country into total free fall
😄

Three big chocchors is civilised again.
LOL did she just says freedom around the world, can you explain for us please why you support Israel colonation
Do we need another marital traitor. We have enough of them...
A falling country lost its common sense, choosing a fool as PM in a very critical time.
The Conservatives will lose the next election, whether or not they keep Liz Truss till then.
Hahahahaha. Average UK citizens are screwed with Tories in charge.
What a load of shite!
I thought Rishi sunak will be the PM
😂😂😂😂😂

She must be an Idiot. Britain's New Government looks Ghetto. Is she secretly trying to destroy Britian?

The British are strong.  Unfortunately England is no longer full of just British people.  Good luck with that.
Нормальный Лидер довно ушол бы, ради жизни своих граждан
Им враг сам Зеленский.
Россия им не враг. А именно Украинскому народу.
То что делают Российские войска, в Украине. Будет только лучше для Украины. Вам что этого не понятно?
ЕС должны снять все санкции. Хватит вести себя безобразно. Сколько можно посылать разных уродов в Украину. Этому нужно ставить конец. Вам же писал не раз Россия не кому не враг. Вы не понимаете.
Boris didn’t deliver the Brexit we voted for, he kept us in on some issues
In Liz we trust!!!
Именно в этом и заключалась доверие к вам. Вы подводите. Я не привык быть униженым.
Ты должна снять все санкции, и повлиять на ЕС.
Я вам доверился, ты готова снять все санкции с России??? Вопрос???
Ты не оправдывает мои доверия, ты меня придаёш.
Я тебе даю последний шанс. Я завтра поеду и посмотрю. Понятно?
Politicians 💰💰💰💰 poor people ⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️
Ты нахуй ничего не поняла, я вам не Путин и не Зеленский и не Кадыров. Ты что не понятлива??? Нахуй пошли. Понятно?? Я тебе говорил забрать ихние жизни, я жду!??
Слушай внимательно, придёт время, и я поеду по всем местам, которые войдут в состав России. И где я увижу беспридел, и Чеченцов, будут не только стоять раком. Но и умереть как последние шакалы. Понятно???
Я тебе писал что ты должна избавится от всех серых цветов. С кем играеш???? Мне нужна независема я экономика. Тебе понятно??? Нет я найду тебе замену Понятно???
Не вынуждай меня, проклинать вас, не надо быть шестёркой. Тебе понятно? Я тебе не Путин и не Зеленский и даже не Джонсон. Тебе понятно??? Нахуй пошли, вы все ниские подонки. Как и ваша ебаная экономика. Боитесь? Бойтесь в рот буду вас всех иметь.
She did a twerk after the speech but the bbc didn't show it
I’m so excited to imagine Maisie Williams playing Liz Truss in The Crown season 10.
The parade continues with another iron maiden and Britishit(sic) politics. More insinuations, accusations, and lies about China forthcoming.  Stay tuned.
People say population was primitive 3000 years ago.   Those ancestors would say the same for todays crowd cheering the democratically chosen “leader” who wouldn’t hesitate to push the “nuke them” button. Back to primary school, please! Back to school.
Liz Truss makes Keir Starmer interesting to hear
Shame shame prime minister of Britain shame on you. A big failure, terrorist are roaming on roads of Britain  and you could not handle the law and order of your country
Sure i am. You'll drink and drink and drink to Thatcher the stink.  So the rich get richer and poor get poorer all we want is medicinal compounds
Another priminster that doesn't give a damb about the working class  God help us

She won't do anything since she's just a puppet. The only way to stop inflation now is to completely reset everything which is happening.
She has promulgated the idea that Europe shouldn't be dependent on Russia's energy. As a result of cutting off Nord stream pipeline's supply again to Europe by Russia, the prices have spiked throughout the continent. What's she going to do about this issue? She has now conjoined hands with Biden to aide Ukraine to get its territories back, and the efficacy of this has helped Ukraine get some of its eastern territories.
What would you have to say about electricity crisis?
Lisa is a moron. Is there any thought in your dumb head at all?
Good grief... another Boring Bias female PM

I don't believe a word of it
She looks physically strong af. Solid forearms. Anyone know if she lifts weights?
Do people know that stoke council won't pay people their £150 council tax rebate for the energy crisis if people have a building society account or a post office account?????? Why does it have to be a bank account only ??????? Or do the government already know about this scam because they're part of it. 🤔
because God loved the world so much that he gave his only son Jesus Christ for all mankind so that any man who believes in Jesus Christ may inherit eternal life through him if we confess our sins Jesus Christ is faithful and just to forgive us and only through Jesus can we inherit eternal life32
Let's see if she will get rid of the monarchy as she promised years and years ago.
❤️👌
Can never get anyone younger in office can't they ?
This dumb a$$ says she’s willing to use nuclear weapons over the Ukraine proxy war ? Are you kidding me ? How about ending the f’cling war ? Nope, instead you’d wipe out half the f’cling planet. You can’t get dumber than this air head. Disgusting.

I’ll miss making fun of boris.
Safety and secure a genuine life is the main concern, power struggle will make it worst. Lets pray that more common ground can be achieve between countries.
Bojo turned out to be one of the most useless prime minister's in the last century. He's presided over the continued destruction of the British culture, society and the countries morals. Truss won't do anything either. All talk about irrelevant shite and not a word about uncontrolled illegal immigration, homelessness, crime, grooming gangs, political corruption,  NHS mismanagement, returning the UK to energy independence, scrapping the ridiculous green policies, wasting billions on "foreign aid", over regulation, leaving the echr, indoctrination of our kids by schools in such things as CRT, scrapping net zero nonsense but improving broadband is the priority that will save all the countries ills   She's going to be just another Muppet in the house of puerile children.
Have a short while ago seen our new PM referred to as "Trussolini".

Что происходит, веть как и писали раньше. Никто не должен обедать. Короля. Кто такой Асмана. 😂
Damp squib libral candidate and weak candidate with no polocies which will make any difference to fix boris's bomb site legacy.  It is no point in announcing in parliment that the blind and disabled will receive necessary help to the blind and disabled of 10000 to meet utility bills of 9000  this winter.Its on no point in announcing increase in income for the blind and disabled when this government has cut their incomes by 170 %since 2010.  There are two urgent issues to address today  Increases in icome for the severely disabled and blind numbering 1.8 circa million by 170 % which complies with laws passed by parliment.  Levelling up means increaseing income levels by the 39% inflation which only the severely disabled and blind will experience in October.  It is becomming clear that Mrs Coffee has lied to parliment, is in breach of the ministerial code and must resign immediately.This on going failure relates to announcements she made in parliment in january in reply to the Joseph Roundtree foundation in December last year.  The termination of the Post office ayment system on the first of june 2022 has stopped the payment of benefits to numerious very vulnerable people with no plans to replace it with any co ordinated plan to replace it.  Concequently the most vulnerabe blind and severely disabled in this cuntry have not receive any income since the 2nd June dispite promises to parliment and warnings from the courts.  Clearly the most vulnerable are starving through this governments incopetatance dispite been warned. She has no quarter to accuse the Chinease premier of Genocide when she is miered in her own preventable genocide of theblind and severely disabled UK citizens.  She must resign for misleading parliment, and call a general election.The voters have not voted for jaw dropping abuse of severely disabled and blind UK citizens in 2022.  As simply red  said this is a nation ;emergency she has go to go immediately there is nothing this government has the ability to do for the UK people anymore after a failed week in power.

She is a sociopath as she stated she would use nuclear weapons.  How does humankind get rid of this nutjob?
Too early for me to criticise this women let's see what she is capable of
The fact that she's pretty bad at public speaking. there might be a slight "hope". Usually all politicians are all talk and no work
What a shame. She doesn't know the geography of the world. She can't comprehend the question.  This woman will create more problems for the UK than a bad hair day clown. She will make the UK very poor. The UK is already a poor country, but she will make it to be a very poor country.
She s very trumpian
When I worked with Liz Truss she played politics and pandered to radical ideas – we’re in for a hell of a ride  By Neil fawcett.
Nice Tits !
This is like we are blitzing ourselves, we do not need hitler to do it, we assert our right to be quite bonkers
I hope we don't enter a trade war with the EU and sour our trade relationship with the US because of not honouring an international trade agreement that we substantially co wrote. After the cost of living crisis this issue is the next single most important thing the government has to deal with right now and there is very little talk in the media about it. if we do worsen trade relations with the EU and US at this critical time for the economy then the cosy of living crisis may just get worse. Perhaps the NI protocol does need reform but not just now and not in this damaging way.
She's going to subsidise wealthy pensioners. Meanwhile my school cannot afford the heating bill so we no longer have any mental health support.
Hopefully the two years is up quickly this woman sends nothing but bad vibes out
So sad with the lost. But i think is times to ending royal families we don't need no more kings or queen. And let she becomes last queen's . Times to change. This earth soil not belong to any family.
how come this bibble managed to get to here when she can't do a speech without reading a card. how come she has nothing of consequence to say? we must have entered the end times
Mad World
Stunning 😊😊😊😊😊
Looks like a karen
She’s clueless. Western “leaders” are beyond pathetic.
Why the England didnt take Mr.Bin on prime minister position ? Like Ukraine did ))) 😁😁😁
Stop the 40% tax band on earnings up to £65k. Step one.  If you can’t do that then you’re as good as your word when you were a young liberal. I see you breaking and being used as Cannon Fodder.
How can she cut taxes and improve healthcare and education. Is she just going to borrow money?
When she's no longer the Prime Minister in the UK can she come to America and be president? Please.
Man, she has a nice rack on her.
OK people get your bingo cards ready let's see how much she screws up as so far the last bunch of em have made things worse and worsr
Geography illiterate
She just tries sooo hard to be confident in her speeches it’s just cringe
There is a video going around that says she hated the queen on tiktok. She said it her self. I ask all to do ur research on when she gave statements when she was young about the queen. The king needs to disband the west minster and take back control. The country is sinking. They messed up the country. Energy crises 5 % from Russia isn't hurting us. We can buy from dubai. This is misleading. Police needs to investigate if she had anything to do. Managed to download it from tiktok
Dont trust torys. They have decimated public services in north. We arecstruggling to provide basic services and are going bankrupt. We have frustrated public having a go at us daily as they dont realise wehave lost 50% of our staff with some services now ran by just one or two exhausted people.  Government buildings are being filled up so look full..when in fact tgey are filled up.with private sector firms renting space or nhs.  The billions spent on undergroundvand thevmps slow liw tech nothing like japans bullet train that is costing billions prob as mps have shares in the companies building it..means none of our taxes spent on north...austerity was just a stripping north of all our assets ..like librarys..government buildings and jobs and it was all sent to london....
Would like to see Dr Evil sat opposite that backstabbing witch telling her to zip it. Two months of having to put up with those self bloated peacocks strutting about while watching the country going down the sink.  Drag them out of office immediately.  Self centered disrespectful arrogant jobsworth 'karen's'.

Well, she's smarter than a Joe Biden, although that doesn't mean much.
Nah bro I am I Tripin or is she hating on borris
우리나라의 5.60세대들의 장기요양으로 노인복지를 하는 여자들은 어르신들과 장애인들이 대상자들이고 치매란다. 타킷은 러시아란다. Ok? 두마리 토끼를 잡겠다고 하면? 어디까지? 건설업까지. Ok? 영국의 당선된 총리는 무엇을 말을 했는가. 보건과 에너지. 엘리자베스 살아생전에 그 안에 다 있었느니라.
I don’t know her as French person but she seems to have good intention for the U.K. I wish her good luck
Good luck with her. You’ll be looking for a replacement in 6 to 9 months.  So dumb she hurts my brain…
That armoured 5 litre  Range Rover Sentinel looks a bit of a Beast.
Sounds all wonderful, hope she is honest and carries through her promises. Here in Canada we too got a beautiful speech from our prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Only to have him turn into a Tyrannical bias Dictator.
The fact she already Implemented a cabinet based on woke points mean this is going to be a disaster
Borris was bad but people will wish they never got rid of him
A Liberal Democrat A Remainer  A Hypocrite
Least trust 🤣🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
Oh god!🤦‍♂
Now, let´s waiting for a new book: "The Thacher Factor" . And after, a new minister? Stop it!!
Why not indian
Tv licence council tax housing prices     and imagration  are you going to tackle that ...
Not a single mention of the invasion force that has been hitting the south coast for the past 2 years ....Another globalist clown
Crazy to think that this was a few days before the death of the Queen of England
This doesn't look good, unfortunately. It's the mean, ruthless little mouth. Over and out.
Johnson delivered the Covid vaccine? Empty words. Repeating Brexit phrases. People applauding.....
Spades in the ground hmmm
Who's shouting in background
All just words, the action will wait to be seen
Well she can't be worse than Boris... right??
It's been a week energy bills are through the roof. She's a walking talking piece of shizt just like every other pm
She hates the monarchy get her out horrible woman
Her words sound like she'd want to rejoin the EU, I mean, giving work to people etc. etc. But we know it's not going to happen =p
Have to fight for freedom.If not? More and more again nothing changes.maybe more gender rainbow toailetts possible .Wake up Britain
Best Geoff boycott impression ever 😂😂😂
God. I really disliked that speech - Truss's vocabulary was infantile and limited, truly shocking for a woman of her status. I have seen better written by primary schoolers.
There are so many people that want to put the UK down and yet seem to be ignorant to the damage they do to the UK economy. Are they really that ignorant or are they just trying to promote their political party regardless of the cost to all of us? Enemy countries must be in disbelief regarding the disloyalty of some UK citizens
The wrong Liz died
The last act The Queen performed before her departure was confirming Truss. What was the sequence of The Queens death?
""history will see him as a hugley consequential  prime ministe !"  i see what you did there Lizz
RIP....  Thief of kohinoor
Then the queen dies
£100k from BP
I happy that she's become our prime minister 👍👏
Wow she seems great compared to the crop of western leaders out there today!  Cheers from New Jersey.
Don't be just a talker, be a doer
Help out in hartlepool and around there  🙏
Cursed PM
She’s going to do terrible
She’s got the skyler white Karen hair cut
I can’t believe they made this arrogant idiot prime minister hope it’s not for long
You won’t get anywhere with your anti Russian personality, bring peace to this world War only bring deaths and blood and poverty, UK has interfered enough in world matters in many wrong ways, change that, make world a better place for all. There is enough for everyone. Reform your country’s foreign policy woman!!!!
Truss' objectives all sound wonderful and I hope the majority of people in this country will cooperate, so her plans can be put into action. HOWEVER, as for her plans regarding the NHS and making sure 'everyone will get a doctor's appointment', that will certainly NOT be possible, unless people in this country start changing their lifestyles for a healthier one! Stuffing yourself with meat, dairy products, sugary drinks and all other kinds of crap will make you overweight and ill, and you can't expect the system to pay for your ignorance. So everyone, start living healthier and more mindful and then, maybe then, Liz Truss objective will have a chance to materialise!
Hate to say it being a feminist and all but she is going to do nothing for energy bills etc... She couldn't even deliver a decent sincere speech for the Monarch today... Really hate to say this but Boris could and would have done better
That's such a terrible speech.
Respect for Britain on continuously and consistently embracing women as capable leaders who can take the reigns of running a country in partnership with its citizens🙌🙌🙌👌
Your words about borris are true I welcome the new iron lady strong words strong leader 💪
They are Kohinoor thief 🤣
Believe it when I see it.
💃🎉
Keep off Africa resources and African children as you build your nation
She’s a World Economic Forum puppet unfortunately.
Terrible shoein.
Disgusting lady
How does she expect to put the nhs on a firm footing whilst implementing more tax cuts? Through magic? The entire problem with the nhs is the lack of funding in crucial areas, this issue will just get worse
Jesus this is hell of a coincidence A new prime minister and 2 days later a new king?
And now the queen is gone
Imagine the longest ruling monarch in british history dying on your 3rd day as PM. I'd just quit honestly.
Uk new dog coming 🐕🐶🦮👎
Uk is officially doomed....
The only thing I like about her is her accent. Also she speaks well and clearly.
Rewatched the beginning of this just to see her massive tits bouncing around.
Around the world?  Hope that includes Israel as the Middle East threatens its very existence.
what happen? did u guys have election already? suddenly new PM
IS SHE DEAD BBC
'We have huge reserves of talent, of energy, and determination.' What a relief...what we don't have are reserves of money!
She really loves pizza guys
Pray for the queen
The new British PM has started on a strong footing.  Energy affordability intervention by Government is always a good move,  both to ameliorate  expenditure burdens of the populace,  and to maintain a grip on clean energy.  If people are overwhelmed by energy bills,  it is much more difficult to keep focused on clean,  environmentally friendly energy sources, for the preservation of the Earth, its inhabitants and its resources.   Support for charities mentioned elsewhere is a humane move,  assisting to counterbalance perceived stringency of Conservative and Unionist Party financial policies.  Added to this, support for NPOs, including churches and other religious organizations,  and NGOs also assists to put a human face on the broader economy, together with self-employment,  freelancing,  and an up to standard informal sector of the economy.  Unfortunately,  large salaries will not solve the problems of humankind,  because the more people have,  the more they spend and borrow.  What will assist to transform the economy from a self-seeking jungle of grossly unequal salaries for equal human beings,  with equal needs and rights,  will be equal human living amounts for all, albeit with unequal allowances,  perks and privileges relating to education,  qualification, position,  seniority,  and the like.   That is a significantly better jungle than one in which massive inequalities are all called salary.   Those aspects of life that generally do not fit conveniently into personal income,  such as education,  housing and mobility,  can be provided based upon rung by rung success, and tax contributions.   In this regard,  reducing the ordinary person's tax burdens is always a good idea.  Suppose the British Government would like to reduce taxes by 20%, it could instead reduce taxes by 18-15%, for example, and utilize the extra 2-5% on education,  medical services,  etcetera,  which would assist the majority of persons more effectively,  these not being sufficiently empowered in these areas by the Tax reductions alone.   Heavy taxes the world over are symptomatic of hypermilitarism of societies  - and also of the continuing attempts of the financially disempowered majority to guarantee a workable share of the pie, particularly in areas such as state education and medical institution (hospitals,  clinics,  etcetera) provisions!   No political party is perfect,  and the  number of leaders over a time span need not be held against those in power.   A cricket team in which each player scores upward of 20 or 30 runs, on average, can win just as well as a cricket team comprised of a few "centurions" and mostly weaker batters,  according to the conditions being faced on the pitch.   God bless Liz Truss and her "cabinet" as they rise to the occasion,  in order that inflation may subside through sensible,  sensitive economic measures!  God bless Great Britain, her Majesty the Queen,  and her Majesty's Government!  God bless planet Earth,  somewhere upon which I continue to dwell!
I take it you didn't believe me. Anyway. To start with, in order to find the substance that was given to Lilibet's grandmother, you need to find those who created the play in Salisbury. After all, the substance that it was given from the same laboratory in the UK. You will no longer be able to interrogate Lisey, because she is a member of the government, and she only indirectly participated there and can only pass as a witness, although she can help find other participants in the conspiracy. But here is the former boss, a crazy cyclist, here he got up to his elbows, by the way, there are conspirators and in MI6 check those who were related to environmentalists and cooperate with the United States. And also check the health of William (I don’t know how they are going to remove him for him) and George was given a drug that affects the brain and can cause a decrease in development in the future. The point is - some people who have great power in the United States, and in Britain, need to change power on the throne until 2024, until the elections in the United States are held. To do this, you need to get rid of your grandmother and imprison Uncle Charles (because they have a lot of compromising evidence on him), then restore Harry to the throne, and after the elimination of the nearest contenders, Harry will sit on the throne and Meghan will lead the country, who was specially thrown into Harry's bed. Although you may not believe
Tackle what is holding Britain back.......... politicians 😁
Yes, Brits, you can go lower than Boris.
LIZ TRUSS IS WAY BETTER THAN BORIS JOHNSON.
Long live truss, I trust you
Welcome to building no 10
Same sh*t different day. I'm sick of hearing the tories telling us how great things are going to be. You have been in power for years and nothing has changed, not for the better anyways. Look at the absolute shambolic state this country is in. Tories don't care about the average person and are so out of touch. The tories have been in power for years and had there chance to keep their promises and deliver but they have not. They have sunk us. Worst government ever! Whoever thinks Boris did a good job regarding Covid is absolutely nuts! The tories need to be removed and a new government formed. If thing's don't change there is going to be a revolution. As a nation we have sat back and let them destroy this country. We sat and did nothing. It's time for us to stand up and be heard.
About time this is a leader do us proud lizz you deserve it 👏
Is this Truss the foreign minister who was mocked by Lavrov as an idiot? An idiot who jumps in just by setting a trap. The idiot who clamored for the use of nuclear weapons on Russia without even knowing where Russia is? lol!
Not allowed to read from a piece of paper anymore. Oh I hope her dad loves her.
Don’t like her already
We are coming   ☠️☠️☠️
The past few weeks we're literally UK prime minister battle Royale.
2 days "on the job", first 2 speeches (internal party acceptance & this one), 2 languorous tributes to his disastrous predecessor. Even if she owes a debt to him, if she had an ounce of political intelligence, she should be distancing herself from the mess, and push ahead with her new plan. This does not give me the feeling that she is intellectually and politically autonomous - NOT the stuff to make a PM. Time will tell, sooner rather than later.
A new political scene in british politics, a slut has been chosen as prime minister..
Did you know that this woman and her husband have recently been heavily investing large amounts of personal wealth into these energy companies so she has a personal goal to keep prices as high as possible, also her energy bills are payed by tax payers money. Join DON'T PAY UK. A charity set up to get prices reduced to an affordable level
More false promises from a political puppet "the United face of the elite"
The beginning of the end... What a walking disaster!
She missed out the bit where Ukraine have , and continue to, bomb the citizens of the Donbass  for the last eight years but don't the facts get in the way hey
Every MP needs to support the present Prime Minister because of difficult times and everyone should hope to do something good together.😊💕👍🤝🇬🇧
The clowns are in charge of the circus
Something is wrong with country of William Shakespeare!  One clown left, another came!
The collective west is losing and Putin is winning. Germany 🇩🇪 isn't laughing now.
Everyone commenting the same crap they do everytime they elect a new puppet. “Excited to see what they’re going to do for the country”. When are people going to realise it doesn’t matter who you vote for?
Gosh she's awful! She's like a malfunctioning Stepford wife, she has the charisma of a wet sponge! 😳
Is she superwoman or something? “I’ll do this I’ll do that I’ll make sure people get their doctors appointments” Lol Sooner or later she will realise it’s easier said than done and the public will realise they all spout the same shit to create a fantasy halo above their head when the truth is, she’s as powerless as the last one
She is gonna tax the working class with energy bills by making it go up and cut tax for the wealthy
Prime Minister Karen 😂
I would comment on how wooden this speech was but I could get sued for defamtion by the lumber industry.
Liz Truss🙌
Liz Truss👍
Starting up her new job by kissing the a$$ of her predecessor. Yeah, she'll fix Britain good . . .
is there something wrong with her? she seems to walk crooked and/or her arms are stiff
Yes, she'll succeed in delivering  blackouts, food shortages and riots, as planned by her masters in W*F. That and fleecing the public. Lies as soon as she opened her mouth. Just watch her start protecting all these big compa6that lobby Government. Oh wait, didn't Shell donate to her campaign!!!@
bbc, you want us to believe shes better than the buffoon? 🤗
Welcome new PM…
Hooooray for another Margaret Thatcher!!! Hooooray for senseless feminism!!!   Who gives a damn about one’s ability to do the job, as long gender quotas & racial quotas are filled, it’ll be fine. Hoooooray!!!
I like the hairstyle and that grey car...
Russia forward
Not impressed by her ambitions. No mention of any commitment to reducing gas emissions for the security n well being of future generations. Sad.
Best of luck from Bangladesh, Congratulations.
The main questions to be answered are: Will she be a lackey of the US? and follow the footsteps of booris Will she serve the interest of WEF?  Will she serve the will of the people instead of the rich? Work in the best interest of UK citizens? Tax cuts? or sales pitch?
Another WEF puppet. God help us
We pronounce her name slightly different here it's,  Miss Trust.
School presentation vibes
School presentation vibes
GOOD LUCK PRIME MINISTER! LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!
bro, im in mexico and im seeing this drama getting juiced up for these economy war.
Another puppet !
We are glad that you believe in freedom! Freedom for Ireland Freedom for the Falkland Islands  Freedom for Canada Freedom for Australia Freedom for Gibraltar Freedom for Bermuda Freedom for the Cayman Islands  Freedom for the Virgin Islands  STOP English dictatorship, Nazism, racism and colonialism Freedom for all ✊
Well that was somewhat underwhelming...
oh shut it
We need to buy 7 day peace shield in order to survive this kingdom war. 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 We need to upgrade our military base hospitals  science & upgrade our castle.  🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
4 Prime Ministers in 6 years. That's an average of a new Prime minister every 1.5 years.  Edit: + Maybe 1 Monarch dead  Reminds me of the Persian empire having 12 Kings in a few years just before it collapsed.
🤡🤡
No! we cannot have security abroad without security in your back yard! Deal with your own back yard before you start wagging fingers at the world!🙂
I'm Understand..🙏🙏🙏...
🥱 blah blah blah bollocks
they dont even pretend to care anymore, she was reading through that underpaid interns speech like it was a school project
Tax cut...!!! Approach of populism..
If liz does what she says on tin then we have a good PM
Thank fook they didn't let that brown thing in, that would of been the last straw, I'm already digustedd by the lack of care for actual British ppl, the country's gone to shit letting all these forgeiners and brown things in!!!
Donkey
What a complete an utter travesty that someone as corrupt and self serving as Truss can become prime minister. I'm so sick of this sham they tell us is democracy. Everything is done for the rich and big business while the rest of us are ignored.
God bless the UK,❤
🥇Russia Victory🥇🇸🇮🇰🇿🇧🇾 Ukraine fack you💩💩💩
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

Привет всем британцам из России! Мы тоже хотим, чтобы был мир во всем мире! Украина 8 лет бомбила свои города! Бомбила тех, кто не признал государственный переворот в 2014 году. Эти территории Украина объявила зоной антитеррористической операции: бомбили, не платили людям пенсии и социальные пособия! Пенсии и социальные пособия платила им Россия! Россия отправляла гуманитарную помощь этим территориям. Мы на работе и самостоятельно отправляли людям деньги, чтобы они могли жить! Многие оттуда переехали жить в Россию! Путину пришлось начать это! Путин очень мудрый политик, он никогда никому не угрожал. А эта дама, ещё не стала премьер—министром, а уже заговорила о ядерном ударе! Так нельзя! Просто нужно вести обоюдную торговлю и все! Нам очень жаль, что ваше правительство не заботится о своих гражданах. А здесь мы сами разберёмся!
waiting for the next video
Liz has bipolar disorder, she's a sick person, she just hides it.
hawayu
I'm curious as to how she is going to tackle the energy price crisis??
No one could clean the leaves on the street before the speech? Looks messy
Well a new PM hit's number 10, and as usual, makes some bold statements and promises, in another 12 months we will see if she manages what she says, I actually hope she can, but tbh, all I'm hearing is the same words spoken by a different face, I do hope I'm wrong and she has the power to "actually" do something about, the shite state the UK is currently in, especially the energy prices, which are just money hungry companies profiteering off the back of the Russia/ Ukraine conflict, without a second thought for the poor end users, already cash strapped.  But, Liz, one point of contention don't worry about building "new" roads, just get the ones we already have repaired, so we can actually drive on them without feeling like we are driving on third world roads, ohh and cancel HS2 it's just getting beyond a joke now, with ever more rising costs.
Yet another austerity promoting Tory to deliver a "strong and stable" government. Only this one looks more soulless than a barbie doll
History will remember Johnson HOW? As a myopic bumbling liar and an incompetent hypocrite.
Hope is best soon as possible for everyone .@ Liz PM
Very super dear New UK PM LIZ  TRUSS हजुरलाई धेरै धेरै हार्दिक शुभकामना छ super smart great West Minister Model very good luck🗻🐷🐂🐃🐒🐎🐐🐩🐕🌋🏝🌎🏔🏕⛱🏕🗻
Seriously, great speech liz👍👨‍💻
No change then, total bs and empty promises as usual
congratulations Truss on being the new Prime minister of United Kingdom. Supported from Malaysia 🇲🇾🍻🇬🇧
She only pursued politics because she didn't make the cut for The Spice Girls. She was actually going to be the fifth Spice Girl - Dim Spice, but their record label wisely ditched the idea - true story.
why do I keep hearing benny hill theme song, even though it isn't playing out loud at the moment?
Well, there we go. Speaking of BoJo. He delivered the vaccine! Yeah right, he didn't have any choice, and you too Liz with have your strings attached soon.
pretty clear the only way to save the uk economy is to remove ridiculous russia sanctions that caused this mess in the first place.
great!!! UK is going to the hell for sure~~~~
Que Dios Bendiga la Ministra Liz Truss.
Finally a PM with a good diction and a fake plan
Freedom, Enterprise and Fair Play  Freedom - Built colonies to suck the life out of half the world.  Enterprise - Yeah, the colonies that looted the natives of even basic familial happiness  Fair Play - Yep, they did fair by cutting hands of artisans, trading at gun points and betraying the whole World.  Meanwhile, Russians have done more to keep the International peace and Britain has funded terrorism in South Asia. I can ot imagine how do these people have the guts to do anything at all.
Security? Where's the security in the UK? MPs murdered... people stabbed more than ever before... terrorist bombings... any Tom, Dick and Ali economic chancers rolling up uninvited to our shores & put in hotels for God knows how long.. Talk is cheap Liz.
It is about time that Governments did what the Majority wants and not cow down to what the Minorities want.
Good Luck Madam Truss,The New PM,UK.
Divert money of politicians from sri lanka,  India and Pakistan swiss bank to UK
No... we don't need to build f roads
British English is the gold standard of English. Period.
Congrats to Liz Truss. May God bless England once again.
A good of her to won election to be a prime minister of England/she is better than Sunak
i always say it the English are the greatest enemies of France, it's not Germany at all. as an "Englishwoman" said when speaking of the French I will retort the same thing to you the roast beef “England would be wonderful if there were no English people
Less Trust
Wtf does broadband have to do with anything!?
When she said tax cuts and the camera panned to a bunch of suits nodding in approval.  Yeah, we know who's going to benefit from that don't we.
you guys have a lovely new piece of toilet paper to wipe your arse with. Boris was flushed, she will be too. Bla Blah Blah lies.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰

People will see Boris Johnson as a hugely constipated individual.
The conditions at No.10 Downing Street are a bit shabby. Just like a street office in China.
You Brits are truly queen controlled. Even the DPM is female. What happened to all the guys? No balls to take up the challenge?
Huge respect from Vietnam. Welcome this Liz Truss The new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom! 🇻🇳🇬🇧
Congratulations to Liz Truss on becoming the new PM of England :) In view that my dear friend Vladimir Putin was slightly impolite towards her election victory, we would like to encourage Vladimir Putin to work something out with Liz Truss to restore Peace between Russia and Ukraine. Perhaps French President Macron can also be of assistance, by arranging a get together will all concerned parties, so that Peace and Prosperity can be restored in the International Community :)
When will you step down?
There you have it guys…. Our once great country is now being run by geography teacher.
Can anyone please remind me what is the purpose of the royal family in the UK? Because if the royal family allows this person to lead the UK, I feel there is none...
Hoping the Best for the new Prime Minister's Career
Let's all give her a chance
Another corrupt conservative that stands by the organisations corporations and industries and pretends support the public . The law should be that no POLITICIANS should be involved in any organisation corporation or industries or involved in any investment or shares or involved in any high profile people this should be made law and the penalties for breaking this law should hold a life time imprisonment without privileges especially contact with other prisoners .
🙏🙏
Not many people have confident in you.  This is from the UK poll.
Will uk become worse with each prime minister. Of course it will. As she is merely a puppet under control from you know who. Lord voldemort.
I am very amaze on how UK find to have a leader worser than Boris and yet I will not be close to be surprise again for finding another Prime Minister that will be worst than Truss. It seems that Europe has abundance of 🤣
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
another idiot in power
Boris Johnson achieved none of those things, what planet is she on, she's there only because he was an ineffective and corrupt PM, there is absolutely nothing to attribute to that man
She is a zionist lady..may be uk can destroy by her...
You wanted peace by electing this Being who came straight from the planet of Love? You will have the war and you will have deserved it!
Expect by the next year or so not to have lizz anymore
Well, she didn't stutter once so I suppose she's a step ahead of BoJo
I give her a year!
If you have any grit then why don't you tell so-called President Biden to reopen America's pipelines and refineries so you don't have to be dependent on Russia?
The moment she says less taxes that's how u know she's only serving the rich. And make sure the poor and vulnerable are sent to the gulag to earn thier "handouts".
Just get your autumn booster and eat Ze bugz and be happy
Good luck while cutting taxes, increasing spending and fighting inflation at the same tine...
Wow, she's a babe...😉
For the sake of this country, I want her to be good, but realistically, I don't think that's happening.
I wonder how she's going to tackle energy issue and bills.
She’s a MILF
They speak of Brexit like it's something good.
Sanctions on Russia are causing more harm to Britain and Europe than the war itself.      The Czechs know this..
Liz Truss is the PM. Our Prime Minister is Liz Truss. _Liz Truss_ . *Liz Truss* . Jesus creeping Christ. Liz Truss.
Better om the eye than the other two
3:35 Americans learn how even Conservatives in the UK support universal healthcare
Good luck to her. May a new Maggie thatcher come out of her and change Britain for the better once again.
Lol the thing is a lier.
Innocent girl
I disnt see any wrong in boris...he is so good,and preethi and rushing they all tried their hard to make uk strong in covid time and also tried to protect country
Nice knockers
Don't know her but gladly it was not an Indian. 🤣👍
stand against putin
I think Liz Truss will meet roughly the same fate: she will screw up, make a mess of things, be removed from office, and then be shot in broad daylight by some annoyed Englishman who can't pay his electricity bill. It is already obvious that half of Britain hates Truss, and Nicola Sturgeon has so bluntly declared that Liz Truss is a fool and Scotland will be free. Britain is slowly but surely heading toward its disintegration because the Anglo-racist political class has lost any grasp of reality. All that is left is a game of petty ambition. And this is always a sign of the end.  All in all, expect disaster. With Liz Truss it is bound to happen. And these will be the last days of Britain going down after the Daggers hit.
Manchester United will be champion this season 100%. Congratulation to new Primer minister.
Thousands of promise, we will see one year from now
Does she mention about the Asian civilization 🧠
get Britain working again, building solar, hydro and wind farms, becaome a more self sufficient nation. bring farming back , let's help them out more
Pure British should be a PM in all time.
Boris was a car accident. Liz, this is a 911 call

Sounds like she is coming from another plannet😄
Promise is one thing .....
Based on almost two centuries of detailed data on taxes and trade, Patnaik estimated that the UK withdrew a total of about $45 trillion from India between 1765 and 1938. This is a staggering amount. For comparison, $45 trillion is 17 times more than the total annual gross domestic product (GDP) of the United Kingdom today. Where's the money, Lizz?
Congratulations Liz From Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
I didn’t vote for her. I never voted conservatives. I voted Boris and never asked for him to be removed.  This is the meaning of madness.  At least the snake did not win.  But with all on the horizon putin, China , looming recession what we don’t want is a puppet.  I dont have a clue who this woman is - but we shall see.   To get rid of an elected PM because He drank beer with friends during covid us the redefinition of entitlement. Gob tell putin that and watch the news next day off how your entire family jumped it the window Same day.   Democracy is great but here we don’t seem to have any respect for our leaders.   Anyone including our enemies can just put some propaganda on Tv and papers about our leaders and just line that He is gone.   That makes us weak. That makes us vulnerable. We as a nation should stand behind an elected leader come what May. He was voted in by b the people and ONLY THE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE POWER TO REMOVE HIM.   This situation is really worrying especially when we know that the v real person laughing today is PUTIN.
most undeserving
Nonsense.
worst than the other crazy " conservative" sad 😔 😱🥶😱🥶😱🥶😱🪦⚰️🥶😱🥶🪦⚰️⚰️
Truss 👎👎👎
Words seems more powerful than actions 🤪
She’s NOT gonna lead the UK successfully in the right direction.
Now there is a speech! Can you somehow also become President of the US as well?
God bless the Queen, God bless Britain 🇬🇧!
Good
We wish you success and success, but a question about the people you accused of terrorism and they are innocent people. Do you look forward to the rehabilitation, and thank you
The personality of a bag of flour,the mental acuity of a quite stupid bag of flour. Not my words but I like it.
Iam king
Boris was hugely something.
0:17 that bounce tho
Welcome to war world III 😂😂😂😂😂😂 pure psychopath on cocaine and steroids. She is the world's most dangerous person. And must be taken out so she doesn't do more damage to the rest of the world. Send her to retirement
Lovelies speech, we will see.
In Truss we Trust! Good luck from Bulgaria!
If she's starting by praising doris then your fucked
Vote Lib Dem back into the EU
Go back to the village you crawled out of
'C~Grade' actresses and actors who canʻt even remember 5 minutes worth of a generic speech so they read it off paper.  Puppets of the elite to distract the masses with lies and stage performances.
Work hard for your people congratulations
Pondlife Lizzy the 🦎 Lizard
She couldn’t run a corner shop
Pondlife
She’s pondlife at its lowest ebb. Delivered Brexit😂😂😂😂 She has no saving graces at all. We will line the pockets of our corporate mates. Freedom and democracy she says😂😂🧛🏼‍♀️🧛🏼‍♀️
A highly cuntsequential prime minister.
First things first, she needs to sort out the cheese crisis. National disgrace that we're importing so much.
God help us , who really finds these goons.such ugly creatures inside and out.
Different face, same problems, no solutions
Nothing wrong to see the prime Minister, greet her male partners. but what is the huggings for?🤗 wont the elbo greetings work better, it reminds me of the American Presidential men shaking hands with every one they get in contact with. maybe the elbo greet is more suitable. or fist to fist, or a nod  of the head, or maybe as the Queeny Queen does 🤗 she might get a cold easily with all the hugging 🥰
You'd think she was taking over from a different party - but it was the Conservatives - her party - that caused this disaster. Banging on about Russia will get us in trouble.
Manny manny congratulations to new PM of UK …. She deserves this position 👍🏻👍🏻
Elizabeth the Second to Liz the Worst
Her English speaking is way clearer than Johnson. English learners should like her.
UK for Brits
Liz Truss`s use  people of Color  to run British government is not to enhance the value of people of Color.. Liz Truss`s using People of color to run the British government as a scapegoat in Britian`s crisis
My gut feeling says that she is going to destroy UK. Time is going to show whether it is right.
this is noncens. first she said that she cut off the taxes, then she said that they will build new schools and stuff. where from the money will come?
Liz Truss won`t be to survive winter 2022
Liz  Trust will deliver as she said. She will make Britain work again
idealistic hopes but that's OK...................
She will do wonderful as prime Minister may God bless her.
Oh dear. Is anyone else hearing Jen from IT Crowd in her?
Inchallah amen 🙏🏻
Whether it's Tories or Labour: it's all the same WEF-crap, produced by those big money mouth pieces such as Truss.
She's going to sign off on fracking everywhere.
:O
people better fry chips in petrole because cooking oil price is 3 times heigher then petrole  hahahaq
What the f, go develop your own country, Russia is doing better than u
She really doesn't like Putin
How much wood would a woodpecker peck if a wood peck would peck wood. Rule Britannia. Etc. 🇬🇧🖤😀
The UK is going down the tubes. No doubt.
Sounds like some eno who just left.
Time to start panic buying bog rolls again!
That speech was banal and insipid. I hope her skills as a politician far exceed her ability as an orator.
Whoever was playing ‘Mad World’ in the background throughout this speech is on my wavelength 😂
Brilliant, the self destruction mode begin
All the British public does is tear down any leader they have. Just because. How long is she gonna last? My Cell Phone lasted longer than Boris Johnson.
Interesting
02:20 she says "we can't have security at home without having security abroad", so from that point of view russia has right to invade ukraine becase that is their security issue??
Say what you will about Boris Johnson.. he was not as dull as drying paint.
Empty words and false promises.
wE UNION again?
BOB GELDOF blasted Britain First for playing the national anthem, a bigger piece of SH*t  would be harder to find,.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰
You can tell its all lies as her mouth is moving
Another imbarasment running the Country 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
She'll be gone by Christmas because her own MPs don't want her.
Increased energy bills have been caused by lack of infrastructure and Brexit - Not the war in Ukraine with Russia. - That’s misinformation.
Wonderful 👏
Wow 👌 👏
Uk messed up
🤣🤣🤣 women cant rule country
Very lacklustre speech
Imagine having a more gormless PM than Boris Johnson
United Kingdom must withdraw sanctions against Russia. Don't push the world into economic crisis. Use common sense instead of "backing" Ukraine for some social media likes and comments
This person has no morals, no scruples, she changes her view as the wind blows- from Lib-Dem Lefty to Tory Right Wing .
Let's hope she stands by her word and stops  the tax increase we got stung with for national insurance and cap energy costs ... let's  see lizzy baby .. do right by the great british people.. and for once be a noble politician and not a lying ass hole like most of them. God save the queen xx
wait wait...you missed the moronic "sanctions" part that have contributed to this world wide global problem.
Here we go again, bunch of lip service and no outcomes
BOOOORING!
It's interesting to see that the worse off they are, the more the british love their politicians. "Just have happy thoughts" Truss says, and everyone is on board, smiling like the idiots they are. Empty words and empty minds have always rescued the british people in time of need.
Listening same speech from last 2 months
She is not capable I'm worried will UK be the next Sri Lanka
Nice boebies
Wasn't another woman should be in this position? I lost track, but as I remember a brunette, slender woman from the news.
I'm a conservative voter but regardless of who you vote for, you won't get what you want with regard to lowering taxes and making things easier financially.  The world is a shit state and the conservatives ain't going to get us out of that and labour certainly won't.  Well labour could but they will make things way worse long term.
Just another one who waffles on about what they are going to do, but don't.  The Country is going backwards and she probably going to make it worse. I dread to think what state we will be in, in the next few years.
I don’t care who gets in as long as they get shot of every single boat migrant in this country it’s a total joke how these freeloaders getting hotels whilst veterans on the streets
Naive silly person. Time will tell but I predict a disaster. British female Trump.
A collection of farts in a balloon Tremendous
How about illegal immigrants!!!!! New PM ?? The energy crises are not due to Putin. Build electricity powers...use north sea oil to help your people, there is so much needs reform in the country, let's hope that you will deliver some of it..
I am glad the brits finally selected a British person to be priminister instead of a foreigner who has 💩 skin from INDIA. Liz Truss is white, who represents the only real native british people on the British island!
More platitudenous flagwaving bollox.! ...this vacuous mouthnoising puppet of 55 Tufton street and the ERG will do what she's told 'til the next right-wing lunatic waiting in the wings is ready to take over.
France is the only country in the world that owns the HAVANA technology.  They used me in the city of Vesoul 14 rue du docteur Doillon.  After I reported to the US CIA on the Internet, they paid spetsnaz to kill me.  (to research the neighbors who lived after 2.2 2021 especially those who belonged to the RENTILA organization);)))
This is hilarious
No emotion in the atmosphere at all..
Makes me sick.
So everything she said...we will do....boris could not do?
Tax cuts plus increased spending. How's that going to work?
Ya need to help ya people not stave them to death
Absolutely fantastic turn of events! Looking forward to a labour government after the next general election.
😍🤞🏾
Все думали, что уже дно, а тут вдруг снизу постучали. Моё сочувствие британцам, худшей кандидатуры трудно представить: дурно воспитанная и необразованная особа!
покажи европе кузькину мать, товарищ Лиза
Where is Rishi?
Thank god it wasn't Sunak, the economy-destroying US billionaire.
Jesus, I'm sure she has horns 👿
How embarrassing
What a boot! A total dog who is so low level, she couldn't grow a mushroom in a dark room. Tax cuts??? What effing planet is she on?
Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss. Working culture is lazy she says. Our Prime Minister
😍😍😍🌹🌹🌹   *_Liz Truss_*   🌹🌹🌹😍😍😍
I hope she better then btois Johnson
All these "people," cheering for her. I fear we have no hope.  If you can best to look for overseas visa's.  I lived in Germany from 2017 to 2021 and the difference in quality of life is crazy.  I hope the majority find some stones and force change.
Big pineapples are juicy😍🍍🍍
Boris for foreign secretary! Lol 😂
Who elected this clown? Oh.. not many people
Wow, truly talented I've hardly noticed any difference!
Не хочу никого обидеть, но это косплей великой Маргарет Тетчер
What about  Larry's speech, the most important cat in UK?
Empty promises from an empty politician.
What about illegal immigrants, not a bloody word !!! Tells you every thing!!!
Deliver ...deliver ....deliver.....reminds me of my past life as a midwife
She is here to ruin institutions and benefit her Godfathers. Lame politics and this party is representing Britain as weakest n lost
you thought boris was bad  now watch what happens with truss in the hot seat, the nightmare continues..
Clueless PM Country going downhill Time to go to the US
Cruella-Deville Braverman as home Secretary Therese Coffey healthy secretary? missing her scarf and drinking tea 😢 Liz-mistrust.....well...🥱
надеюсь, это будет новая Маргерет Тэтчер. нечего потакать социалистам
The new Thatcher 😶🚨😱😱😱
People in uk should give her chance to prove herself..at least she highlight a vision what will she do in her administration..
Delighted to hear she plans "to get spades in the ground" to tackle the energy crisis. And not a word about the climate crisis on her to-do list. Where the hell is her sense of priorities?
So excited to see what she is going to do with energy bills. People should not have to choose between staying warm and feeding their family.
Out with the old and in with the new while the whole world laughs
Is that big building she went in, is that the    Prime minister mansion?
At long last we have a lib dem PM
Liz Truss c'est la femme qui était contre le Brexit, contre la monarchie et qui avait une relation adultère avec Mark Field ... et qui est devenue pro Brexit, pour la monarchie et amoureuse de son mari etc .... ?????? Je vois surtout une girouette. Par contre elle est toujours anti-français.
I give her about 6 month in PM, not so smart person, weak politicians in UK
She got a pair of bangers on her the girl 👀
So why havnt they ‘tackled’ it in 12 years ! NO MORE LIES
Last Election Tory Scum accused Jeremy Corbyn of a magic money tree . Our great great grandchildren will be paying this borrowing off
God bless her. There’s not one color she can wear that looks good on her.
It just sounds a bit weird every time a new PM gives a speech about how things will change and yet they’ve been in power for 12 years now… are they implying that they’ve been doing nothing this whole time?
I don’t Truss a word she’s saying
Modern Britain. Cashless and facial recognition
I,ve heard all this bolloxs a million times over. Its like an old fashioned record player with the needle stuck on the same groove Its all bolloxs.
If Brains was Dynamite Liz Truss wouldn’t have enough to blow her hat off
Lizzy  is secretly in love with Putin, and has also a crash on Macron. UK comedy in progress  as usual!
What if you died tonight, what would you do, what after death, were we created in vain, why were you born in this family, why not this, why you look like this and not like this, where do you go when you sleep and where were you before you were born, and the wonders of metabolism and heaven existed like this without a creator.. who brought Adam And what was the constraint of that.. Ask yourself... God is one, God has no equal, God has no children.. Say, I seek refuge in God from the accursed Satan, and search for GodIslam is a religion that calls to the worship of God, the One, the One, who has no partner, the King, and Muhammad is the Messenger of God, and the last of God’s messengers to people after the Messenger Jesus, son of Mary, after the Gospel was distorted. Reckoning and resurrection after death and Islam is the religion of tolerance and it is firmly established in the lands that have been conquered because it came with mercy for people and the light Islam and the Qur’an illuminate the heart and the pleasure of eternal happiness that does not end Islam is the religion of God and whoever does not enter Islam will not enter Paradise. You must read the Qur’an to learn what is in it and ask God for guidance The path of truth, and to know that you were not created in vain
So this great country that blojo left is effectively in the shit that lizzie now has to sort out. I mean are we supposed to be stupid 🤔
All politicians are the same . Expect nothing , get nothing . These empty words will soon ring hollow .
hoe president suits so good  to england
this will be a footnote
Well, we've had two of the worst PM's in British history. These things come in threes.
Build a bomb shelter for your new kettle!  As if the safety and economy of the UK couldn't have gotten even worse.  She will give the entire bank to Zelensky to piss away!
Boring
The first speech of nothing but lies.
*ELECTION NOW*
Just writing down her name for Pointless.
puppet leader of a puppet country. what a joke!
her lack of charisma wouldn't matter if she were any good. But she isn't.
i can already tell that this is not going to go well
I love the fact that first day in the job millions are calling her a dizzy moron
Many many Congratulations to new elected Britain Prime minister and remain always under the Allah blessing in every manner what so ever nature. Ameen.
We're living in a parallel universe now where the dregs rise to the top
Hmmm yes broadband that’s what the country needs… that and tax cuts…. A universal income is what is needed
"A big cheer..."  Yeah, because you were only broadcasting the sounds from the mics next to the assembled Tory MPs. The punters outside the corden were booing.
More chit chat and no action, Political circus clowns parade
She looks so stupid! Even more than Johnson! One would think this would be impossible! WOF sure knows how to pick 'em!
Another puppet that will have the same economy wrecking agenda pushed on us by her elite puppet masters.  When she says ‘we’, it doesn’t include her enemies, the general public!!!
Sir, What is this?  Why are you not reporting anything about Corona?  Why are you not showing any interest ?   So far 65 lakhs people have  been killed by this Chaina made artificial virus infection  operation all over the world.  Sir , this is Chaina planned artificial virus infection.  Chaina Government is planning to become the only Super Power and Big Boss of the World  by destroying all the economic sectors of the major cities of strong and progressive countries especially America and India through this artificial virus infection operation.  Please see how the artificial pandemic spread.  It was not spread slowly. It exploded in a single day  in the city of Wuhan  where the   Laboratory is working.  Thousands of people were suffered from this virus infection all over that city. Suffered from excessive fatigue, suffered from fever  cough cold and nasal breathing problem, sufferred from low oxygen levels.  More than six hundred people died in groups on the first day. Thousands of people died on the second day as well.  Note this Sir,  So far 10 lakh 40 thousand people have been killed by  the infection of this corona virus in the cities of America, the strongest country in the world.   So far 5 lakh 28 thousand people have been killed  in the major cities of our progressive country India. But note this.  The infection of this virus has started from China. But in China  the number of people who have died from this Corona infection is  just  five thousand.  No major cities of Chaina were affected by this  virus infection. No expert around the world has noticed all this till date. The full attention of all the experts has been focused on the artificial corona virus till date. The Chinese government is not allowing any country to test the city of Wuhan where this Corona virus first appeared. Acting as if they have nothing to do with this virus.  Sir, Our proud doctors of India know the life saving weapon and simple treatment method to completely cure this artificial Corona infection. Dry ginger powder researched by Dr Hitesh Jani, Retired Principal of Ayurveda College, Jam Nagar,Gujarat and currently working as Head of Ayurveda Institute Lokaryuveda, works as a life saver against Corona infection. When suffering from nasal breathing problem due to Corona infection, applying a pinch of dry ginger powder to the nostrils will immediately start normal nasal breathing. The virus dies instantly. Infected people will get immediately saved from the danger of dying.  Further the treatment suggested and given by Dr P Daven, Virus expert, Kannur, Kerala, the patients get completely cured. But our misfortune is that till now we have not been able to convey this to the whole world.  More than 65 lakh people around the world have  been killed  from the infection of this artificial virus due to the cunning crazy treatment method devised by the Chinese Mafia.  Sir,  I am having the  2 video clips which explains the treatment suggested by  Dr Hitesh Jani,  Jam Nagar, Gujarat and Dr P Daven, Virus expert Kannur, Kerala.   2 years back  during the first Lock down period, I was seriously infected  twice with the Corona virus.  Fully cured by the treatment taken  as per the above mentioned  2 video clips.  My wife and son were cured by a friendly doctor with proper treatment.  BENGALURU  Date: 06-09-2022
She keeps on about delivery when she can't even deliver a speech Monotone voice and banal vocabulary
"I'm going to start my premiership firstly by applauding the previous PM whose woeful & disgraceful actions is the reason why I am standing here now."
I wonder what the price tag on the NHS will be, probably break it into nice juicy cuts first, give them different names, and the stripped skeleton that will be left will still carry the name NHS and of course, they'll claim they never sold it. See you all here in 18 months.
Strap in.  This is going to get crazy and by the end, you're going to be dreaming of a simple time when Boris was in charge and you only had to worry about a PM that lied and broke his own rules, even after Labour take over.  I'd start squirreling away every spare penny and be extra vigilant because scams are going to be everywhere.
Dont let us down Liz show us that our government cares about people first.
What about the cheese?
Similarly dillusional as the previous one. It could almost be funny, if it would not be so tragic and dangerous... Let's hope she will remain even less time in office then BJ
The UK has huge reserve's of talent but clearly none in the Tory party if this clown for the job!!!🙄🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
THIS IS A NEVER ENDING HORROR FILM. IT'S ONE LYING TORY BUFFOON AFTER ANOTHER. TRUSS IS FULL OF BS, SHE'S GOING TO CARRY ON THE SLAUGHTER OF THE MOST VULNERABLE AND POOREST OF SOCIETY. STILL WANT TO VOTE TORY?😞
Worse than boris, going to try live up to Thatcher and thats not a good thing 😕
Brexit isn't finished and even if it was which it isn't what the hell you talking like its a good thing???🤔🙄😂🤣🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ Its been a complete disaster on every level!🤦🏻‍♂️
Yada yada yada ..Blah Blah blah
we’re doomed
Well I can easily say most of that is bull****.
Where is "The cause of World War 2"?
Buzzzyyy LIzzzzzzyyy
Woww new prime minister ...to replace xs p.m Boris Johnson ...in 2022
She is a much dumber and grayer version of Margaret Thatcher. Exactly in keeping with the UK today. Good luck.
To many miserable winging pessimists,  get over it and support your country
Congrats madam Plenty of work to do.
So sick of these right wing Tory extremists.. Ideoligcal zealots...the perpetual shuffling of these no-marks around as the country falls apart. Treating this whole charade like some kind of coronation. It's sick.These people are ill. 12 years of Tory mis-rule... shameful.
Stop immigrates from India tanks 😁
Well Britain its been good knowing you unfortunately your about to be driven into the ground.
Each cook should learn how to govern the state - Vladimir Lenin. But it doesn't mean that she should be let to do it
World have to have remember Pakistan war crimes in Afghanistan 🇦🇫.
Wishing you well PM Liz Truss!!
World have to think about Imran Khan of Pakistan war crimes in Afghanistan 🇦🇫 please.
“Consequential” what she’s actually meant was “Disappointing”
Let’s hope she deals with the immigration crisis and stop this huge waste of money and spend it on the hospitals and roads and the elderly and stop giving it away to immigrants
Liz truss is going to ruin the United kingdom and us people
Why Blame Putin? Blame yourselfs. People suffering from the cost of living because the gov is greedy. Full Stop
Haziest bluster. Ersatz bulshite. Elizabeth Truss.  Anagrams can reveal hidden truths.
I wonder if Liz will give Gove one now..... I mean a job in the cabinet of course!  😀
Russia only supply UK 3%
Good luck and god speed PM Liz Truss. The people of the UK are supporting you... well, I am.
Congratulations
🇺🇸 HER unedited speech.....  i want to thank the great USA for allowing me to be their puppet PM of UK.  I will make sure the USA needs are place before the UK!  I will sacrifice myself and the UK citizens for the greater USA.    God bless CIA, USA Banks, USA military,  then the queen!   🇺🇸
Spoiler Alert: She won't stand by anything she's said, she like all the other Front Bench Politicians are controlled Puppets of the elites and are actively working against the interest of their constituents.
Great speech. Wish we had a prime minister like that.
She didn't really need to do a long speech. She will win the next election just by spouting two words repeatedly: TAX CUTS. People deserve the government they get
Congratulations 🎊 👏 💐 🥳
Well she talks a good talk let’s see what she delivers because the British people are very unforgiving and if she doesn’t bring up what she says she’s out and see what the Conservatives for ever the health service doesn’t need more money the health service needs help to reform and get rid of the trust system go back to a system of district health authorities and all the money that I saved ploughed back into the health service to pay for medical workers not more managers
Hopefully she'll be the last Tory to kick out of Downing Street before the adults are put back in charge.
Good luck Liz!! Hope you succeed!! 🇬🇧
Boris Johnson is a clown and Rishi sunak should have won, UK is doomed since Rishi didn't win
Uninspiring
А что в Англии больше нет адекватных политиков пообнищали если выбирают таких не умных как трасс мне вас жалко
Good luck, PM Liz & keep up the great win!
That heavy down pour was  to wash away all the turds, but they were too large to be washed away
Her obsession with Russia and in particular Putin is extremely dangerous,  she would have us at war on a whim this one, this is going to get bad.
She got a fine pair of jugs 🤣
Bu bu bull 💩 and why the hell is broad band such a big deal , get those minds controlled
A bunch of rich toffs chose our leader for us in lieu of any actual democratic process, who actually cares? Why do British politics feel more like a reality TV show where all you can do is watch helplessly and hope someone makes the right choice than something people actually have any say in?
Greetings BBC,      Thanks for The Valuable Share of Hon UK PM Mrs.Liz Truss Introductory Address which is Simple,Elegant,Thoughtful, Wellspoken in all aspects .                God bless The Royal Family, Hon PM(UK), UK and All.     With regards,                       RanjithJoseph (R.J)
and now thats 3 female PMs from the conservatives, and 0 from any other party.
Corruption and lies. She blames Russia for energy crisis, yet our neighbours pay 4% increases Vs 150%.
Its pass time you English stop electing women to high office It clearly doesnt work and they eventually ruin everything
That Blustering Bilious Bully of a Bumbling Bufoon, Bozo BoJo,  just had to Go !
Great  speech  only if true 👍 👏
I think Janet browns Margaret thatcher impersonation is better.
After 12 years of Tory rule she "plans to deliver" what were they doing for the last 12 years?
"highly consequential prime minister" is an interesting way of phrasing it
Let me tell you something my friends this world is going to claps four corners of this earth it will be demolished
More bollocks
I hope she does well but I have a horrible gut feeling this is not going to be a good few years for our country
Thank god that pa**jet is not the president of UK
Thank god that pa**jet is not the president of UK
Goverment are deluded they say same thing .. Britain is great, British people are stronger , nhs will be better blah blah blah and to finish it we will make the streets safer .... haha good luck with that this country is crime ridden to the core
UK prime Minister it's same like CEO of the company, still company CEO has more welcome arrangements then UK prime minister.
Building roads, homes, schools and making broadband faster through tax cuts and reforms for the rich? That's an excellent plan 👍🏽 🥂
With love from Ukraine 💎
Liz you are Margaret Thatcher came back in spirit kick butt you can sort it
Yeah call another election shortest PM in history lol
Pretend democracy
The speech was nearly stopped by rain, it was a case of 'you put the lectern in, the lectern out - in out, in out and shake it all about'!
Democracy is an illusion
WEF puppet
Another bs er
I don't believe anything she said," She is the same dog with a different collar"
I miss boris
I am a Zookeeper in Atlanta and I regularly feed the Hippos day old Sausages so they have a taste of their home. I put strings on the sausages and swing them around the Hippos they get so Mad at me and Scream but it's an obsession sometimes the hippos try and Break out of their Cages but I keep swinging those hotdogs in Wide Circles over their heads. Luckily my Boss doesn't know I do this or my Coworke
Can She get us back in to Brexit like undo the brexit job
Good luck in forming the Government. Stronger future. Great economy. Working together.
In Truss we (have no) trust.
God Bless🙏 United Kingdom🇬🇧
Congratulations Liz and I am confident you will lead us out of this crisis we find ourselves in. You are the one to reverse years of damage caused by the tory government. The most vulnerable are relying on you 🙏
Another sell out prime minister.  That will cause WW3.👎
Such A Great 👍👏😀honour Liz Trus As UK's🇬🇧  Next Prime Minister 🌷🌹🌸💐
The same illusion that your ideals are people's ideals.  I hear Putin.
Hurry up the next general election
Why drag Russia to this exhibition? yet again
God Bless Truss...
Second  congratulations 👏 liz truss  welcome 🙏 to number 10 downing Street
Disaster! Liar! She know what is wrong but not one word about how she is going to do it.
What’s the over under on her short stay at the top spot?
We in deep shit 😂
يارب أتوسل إليك بحق إسمك الأعظم أن ترزق صاحب اليد التي تدعمني با متابعة ورزق لا ينتهي وتوفيق لانهايه 💛🕊️.
